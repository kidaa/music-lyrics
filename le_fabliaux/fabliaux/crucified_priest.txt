THE CRUCIFIED PRIEST A short exemplum about Roger, the suave, enfranchised master carver, I now propose to undertake
He had the skill one needs to make statues and crucifixes; he, 5 no mere apprentice, artfully carved sculptures in the finest fashion
His wife, carried away by passion, had taken a priest as her lover
Her husband told her as a cover 10 he had to go to market, so he'd bring a statuette in tow to drop off for a tidy profit, and she agreed promptly enough—it elated her to see him leave, 15 and he was not slow to perceive her joyful look, by which he knew she had in mind to be untrue, which was, for her, by now tradition
Then he lifts up into position 20 a crucifix as a pretext and steps out of the house, and next goes into town and cools his heels and waits around until he feels that it's time for their tête-à-tête
25 Shaking from spite and all irate, he hurries home
When he got back, he looked in on them through a crack and saw them sitting down to dine
He called out, but it took some time 30 before someone let him inside
The priest had no place he could hide
He said, "Lord! what shall I do now?" The lady said, "I'll tell you how
Go in the shop, take off your clothes, 35 and, standing still, assume a pose among my husband's holy carvings
" Right willingly, or with misgivings, the priest obeyed her then and there: Without his clothes, completely bare, 40 among the images he stood as if he'd been carved out of wood
Seeing he isn't in the room, the good man is led to assume he's hidden with his sculpted figures
45 Being intelligent, he figures that first he'll drink and have a bite as if he thinks things are all right
After his dinner, when he'd done, he went and got a whetting stone 50 and started sharpening a knife
The sturdy carver told his wife, "Now, lady, light a candle quickly and come into the workshop with me, where I've some business to prepare
" 55 No word of protest did she dare, but with her husband made her way directly to his atelier, holding a candle to give light
The master carver soon caught sight 60 of the priest with his arms stretched out, whom he could spot beyond a doubt, seeing his hanging balls and cock
"Lady," he says, "I've made a shock- ing image here by not omitting 65 those virile members
How unfitting! I must have had too much to drink
Some light! I'll fix it in a wink
" The terrified priest never stirred
The husband, you can take my word, 70 cut off the prelate's genitalia and left him nothing, without failure, to warrant further amputation
The priest, feeling the laceration, took to his heels and ran away
75 The worthy man without delay cried after him with piercing shrieks, "Good people, catch my crucifix, which is escaping down the street!" The priest had the bad luck to meet 80 two fellows carrying a barrel
He'd have been better off in Arles, because one rascal in that band who had a crowbar in his hand swung at his neck with it and struck 85 him down into a pile of muck
When he'd been beaten to the ground, just then the good man came around and dragged him home, where he was forced to buy his freedom, and it cost him fifteen pounds
He made him pay it right then, every last denier
This parable has demonstrated, no matter who is implicated, in no case should a clergyman 95 mess with the wife of any man or hang around her
I allege he'll leave his balls there as a pledge, just as the priest, Father Coustenz, left his three hanging ornaments
