HOW THE PRIEST READ THE PASSION STORY I've something wonderful to tell, a rarity, a nonpareil, about a priest, and none too smart
It was Good Friday, at the start of God's service, and the priest had 5 put on his vestments and was clad, and all the people were in church
He'd lost his straws and had to search for his place
He began to look through all the pages in his book, 10 but he'd have hunted in this fashion till Doomsday and not found the Passion
The peasants were all in a hurry and starting in on grumbling, for he was making them prolong their fast
15 It would be dinnertime at last when the Divine Service was done
But why should I go on and on? They all sat there and fidgeted, and so here's what the prelate did: 20 He launched into a reading now, at first quite loud, then very low, "Dixit Dominus domino meo
" (As for a rhyme in -o, I can't find any, nor make head 25 or tail of all this
If I said it as best I can, I'd do better
) The priest went following the letter of his text as blind Fortune led till Sunday vespers had been said
30 He wanted, I need hardly state, to have a full donation plate, so he cried "Barrabam!" aloud
No town crier has ever crowed a ban with such a booming yell, 35 and everyone who heard him fell to beating his breast in contrition
He had them in a good position, honest to God, in Whom no guile is found! The priest, who all the while 40 went reading straight on through his Psalter, again starts crying helter-skelter, this time with "Crucifige eum!" The church resounded with his mayhem, and every man and every woman 45 heard him and prayed to God in common to save them from eternal torments, but his clerk is fed up and comments to him, "Fac finis
Make an end
" The priest replies, "I won't, my friend, 50 until I reach the miracles
" The clerk immediately tells him lengthy Passions do not sit well and he will not benefit by overtaxing his flock's patience, 55 so when they'd given their donations, he quickly polished off the Passion
My fabliau shows in this fashion that, by the faith I owe Saint Paul, talking nonsense and folderol 60 equally well exemplifies a fool, just as someone who's wise will speak sense when he goes about it, and no one but a fool would doubt it
