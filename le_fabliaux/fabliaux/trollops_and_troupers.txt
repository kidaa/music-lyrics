TROLLOPS AND TROUPERS When God first made and filled the earth with people and throughout its girth all creatures that belong there, then He set up three orders of men to live on earth by His decree: 5 the clergy, knights, and peasantry
Each has his place
He gave the rights to own and govern to the knights, and to the clergy tithes and alms, and last of all He gave the farms 10 to peasants to be sown and tilled, and thereupon, His task fulfilled, He left His creatures and withdrew
As He was leaving, into view there came the profligates in hordes, 15 the entertainers and the bawds
He'd not gone far when they approached Him, began to cry out, and reproached Him: "Where are You going, Lord? Do say a word to us! Don't leave us! Stay! 20 We're given nothing and are slighted, though for the others You've provided
" Hearing them, our Heavenly Sire looked on them and deigned to inquire of Saint Peter, who's standing near, 25 about those people over there
He answered, "They're a surly race also created through Your grace
Like those who place their trust in You, they're clamoring that for them, too, 30 You see fit to make some provision
" Our Lord corrected the omission, but spoke no word to them; instead He went straight to the knights and said, "You lords to whom I gave all lands 35 to rule, I now place in your hands the entertainers as your charge to live among your entourage
Be generous and openhanded with them, for I, your God, command it, 40 and do not treat them with disdain
And you, My clergy, shall maintain the harlots under your protection in accordance with My direction
" In keeping with the Lord's decree, 45 the clergy supports harlotry, holding these women in esteem and making sure they get the cream of all of Mother Church's riches
Contrariwise, my fable teaches, 50 if you have understood it well, as for the knights, they'll go to Hell
They look with scorn on the performers, who must live poorer than a dormouse and go about without a pair 55 of shoes, while whores get furs to wear and well-lined cloaks and fine attire
The entertainers for their hire get little enough of their lords
For all their fine and noble words, 60 they give them only worn-out garments and toss them, as they would to varmints, of their fine dinners, scraps and messes, while harlots often change their dresses, sleep with their priests, and what they're fed 65 is counted in the overhead
The priests do this for their souls' sake, whereas the stingy knights forsake the entertainers, and are damned for violating God's command
70 Not so the priestly class, because they're generous and serve their whores; their actions are my evidence
They lay out the inheritance and the wealth of Christ crucified, 75 keeping their mistresses supplied out of their rents, tithes, and donations, and merit our congratulations above all others for this act
If what my fable tells is fact, 80 the clergy is assured salvation and the knights will go to damnation
