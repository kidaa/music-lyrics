3. THE THREE ESTATES Two knights go riding on their way on a piebald and dapple gray and stumble on an open space among the trees, a shady place decked with flowers and herbs as well.They stopped and rested there a spell. One of them said, "By God I swear, how fine to have a picnic here! You'd need only a jug of wine and pasties and things on which to dine, and 10 your feast would be at least as gay as in a great hall on the high dais." Then they have to be moving on. Two wandering scholars, out for fun, came by and saw the lovely scene. 15 Speaking as clerics do between themselves, one said, "Who got to spend some time here with a lady friend would spend it with her pleasantly." The other said, "He'd have to be 20 weak-hearted and easily daunted not to get everything he wanted." But they could stay no longer then. Two peasants then came barging in. From market they were coming back 25 with spades and threshers on their backs. When they had sat down in the pleasance they started speaking just like peasants: "Hey, Fouchier, from the looks of it this is the perfect place to shit. 30 Let's take a dump right now, old pal." "Upon my soul, we may as well." Then each of them squats down and strains. This story patently explains that there's nothing on earth as pleasant 35 as taking a shit for a peasant, and therefore a peasant befouls the fairest spots and moves his bowels there for delight and recreation, so in light of my obligation 40 to those good folk, what I propose is that peasants go shit through their noses. A peasant, whatever I say, is one whose heart makes him that way, whose deeds show his vulgarity, 45 however high his ancestry. God turn our steps from infamy and save the present company!
