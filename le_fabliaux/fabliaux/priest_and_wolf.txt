THE PRIEST AND THE WOLF A priest who lived in the Chartrain loved the wife of another man, a peasant, but he caught on to't and dug a pit along the route the priest took when he came their way
5 That night a wolf happened to stray by in the dark and tumbled in, and the priest likewise, for his sin: As was his wont, he came a-calling; before he knew it, in he'd fallen
10 The wife, annoyed she had to wait for her priest, who was running late, called for her maid, whom she directed to go find out when he's expected
On her way the maid passed the pit, 15 and she as well fell into it
The peasant, waking early, thought he'd go and see what had been caught
He found his pit full, and he swore that he'd give all of them what-for: 20 He killed the wolf, gelded the priest, and told the maid she was dismissed
On those three grave misfortune fell, but for the peasant things went well: The wolf who feasted on his flock, 25 along with the prelate who took his wife's virtue, paid in full measure, one for his meal, one for his pleasure
