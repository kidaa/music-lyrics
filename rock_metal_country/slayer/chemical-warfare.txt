[SLAYER - 1984 -  Haunting The Chapel ]
[Hanneman/King]

Tragic minds are terrified
Life as if a grave
Silent death marks high and full
The wings of revelation

Haunting death from chemicals
Errant is as one
Annihilation must be swift
The soil with our destruction

Counts on the throne must be watching from Hell
Waiting no bastion of side
Soldiers defeated by death with the spell
Bodies lie dormant, no life
Rising, betook with the lands where they fell
Demons are ready to die
Laughing to see where the sleeping souls lie

Chemical warfare

I will miss your fucking peace, lined up in death row
Generals with their slaughtered beasts, diminished from this
hell
Banished from the dying world, loath of Hell awaits
Dark, some more helpless pray to immortality

Counts on the throne must be watching from Hell
Waiting no bastion of side
Soldiers defeated with help from the spell
Bodies lie dormant, no life
Rising, these souls, from the lands where they fell
Demons are ready to die
Laughing to see where the sleeping souls lie

Chemical warfare

Fuck it up

Limbs you take
The torture just as truth entitled fights
Terminate
Humans' amputations due
Men fall
Deadly give the reason to the need
Sacrifice
Still the soul has left the corpse to Hell

Ahahahaha

Mummied by regions, lying in dusk, fall victim to this game
Bloodshed my corpse, reigning in lust, taking with all thee of
blame
Fall stead thy spirit, farther they fall, soon they will join
us in Hell
See the blood burning, the gates are ablaze, Satan is eager to
burn

Counts on the throne must be watching from Hell
Waiting no bastion of side
Soldiers defeated with help from the spell
Bodies lie dormant, no life
Rising, these souls, with the lands where they fell
Demons are ready to die
Laughing to see where the sleeping souls lie
