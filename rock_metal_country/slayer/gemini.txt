[Music: King, Lyrics: Araya C1996 Molosser Music/SS810 Music ASCAP]

Endure the pain
you know my name
I am your soul insane

I am no one
no one who cares
I am your soul despair

Your fear deceives
vulnerability
leaving an easy prey

Consume your mind
a power so divine
will take you and rape you blind

Gemini master of demise
your death is my salvation
to a kingdom mine
my lord is my light
the master of darkness
your death is my salvation
to a kingdom mine

You look at me with eyes of fate
and see the graphic truth

Your ignorance cannot shield you
from your naked abuse
numbling of your moral sense
facing reality
That life is unconditional
and death is only the beginning

The pain will never end...

Walking slow, breathing heavy
you could see death sweat
how it shined
an argument out of control in my mind

I am here for the sole purpose of your death
walking slow breathing heavy
you can see death sweat.

I am here for the sole purpose of death
look into my eyes and see the revelation of your demise
feel the pain that stares at the center of your heart
reflections of my soul
reflections of the dark
