Disintegration you bastard

I've done overdose it doesn't mean shit
One time what about you it doesn't bother me a bit
My body is a weapon and my mind is decay
And all you stupid assholes are here to see me die

Disintegration [6x]

I don't need you now so why don't you go away
Your day will come real soon and your mind will be
And everyone will fuck you, you're such a fucking whore
And when I see you standing there
I just don't want no more

Disintegration [6x]

Free Money

I don't want your problem
Sopping all the time
I can't even go
When I don't even have the time

I want everything and every thing wants me
I want everything and every thing comes out of me

I want free money [4x]

Life is slavery working 9 to 5
Waste your time working
You might as well die

I want everything and every thing wants me
I want everything and every thing comes out of me

Life is slavery working 9 to 5
Waste your time working
You might as well die
