What happened to you
You're not the same
Something inside your head made a violent change

It's call it religion
You're full of shit

Was she really worth it
She cost you your life
She'll never leave your side
She's gonna be your wife

It's in yor head [3x]
Filler

You call it romance
You're full of shit

Your brain is clay
What's going on
You picked up a bible
And now your gone

It's in your head
It's in your head
It's in your head

You call it religion
You're full of shit

You never knew
You never did
You never will

You call it religion
You're full of shit

I Don't Want to Hear It

I don't want to hear it
All you do is talk about you
I don't want to hear it
Cause I know that none of it's true
I don't want to hear it
I'm sick and tired jof all your lies
I don't want to hear it
When are you gonna realize

I don't want to hear it
I know you're full of shit [4x]

I don't want to hear it
All you do is talk about you
I don't want to hear it
Cause I know that none of it is true
I don't want to hear it
I'm sick and tired of all your lies
I don't want to hear it
When are you going to realize

I don't want to hear it
I know your full of shit [4x]

Shut your fucking mouth
I don't care what you say
You keep talking
Talking everyday
First you're telling stories
Then you're telling lies
When the fuck are you gonna realize

I don't want to hear it
I know you're full of shit [4x]

Ah, shut the fuck up
