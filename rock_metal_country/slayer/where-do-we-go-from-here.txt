Where do we go from here? 
Where do we go from here? 
The battle's done, 
And we kind of won 
So we sound our victory cheer 

Where do we go from here? 
Why is the path unclear? 
When we know home is near 
Understand 
We'll go hand in hand 
But we'll walk alone in fear 

Tell me 
Where do we go from here? 
When does the end appear? 
Heh. Bugger this. 
When do the trumpets cheer? 
The curtains close 
On a kiss god knows 
We can tell the end is near
