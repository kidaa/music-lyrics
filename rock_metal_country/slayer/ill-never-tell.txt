My Angel's missing.

I'll see her when I leave L.A.

An Amtrak engine

hit her car and left her crazed.

I know my angel will make it.

She's got my love and she'll take it.

-Chorus:

Hey! somebody! Hey! somebody!

Hey! somebody! Hey! somebody!

Hey! somebody! Hey! somebody!

Hey! somebody!

A lifetime of confusion.

She won't cross those tracks no more.

She's spinning through

an unconscious universe alone.

I know my angel will make it.

She's got my love and she'll take it.

-Chorus:

Hey! somebody! Hey! somebody!

Hey! somebody! Hey! somebody!

Hey! somebody! Hey! somebody!

Hey! somebody!

Call an ambulance and get my girl out of that fucking car.

-Solo:

Hey! somebody! Hey! somebody!

Hey! somebody! Hey! somebody!

Hey! somebody! Hey! somebody!

Hey! somebody! Hey! somebody!

Hey! somebody! Hey! somebody!

Hey! somebody! Hey! somebody!

Hey! somebody! Hey! somebody!

Hey! somebody!
