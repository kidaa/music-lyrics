Spike

I died 
So many years ago 
You can make me feel 
Like it isn't so 
And why you come to be with me 
I think I finally know 
mmm-mmm 

You're scared 
Ashamed of what you feel 
And you can't tell the ones you love 
You know they couldn't deal 
Whisper in a dead man's ear 
It doesn't make it real 
That's great 

But I don't wanna play 
'Cause being with you touches me 
More than I can say 
And since I'm only dead to you 
I'm saying stay away and 
Let me rest in peace 

Let me rest in peace 
Let me get some sleep 
Let me take my love and bury it 
In a hole 6-foot deep 
I can lay my body down 
But I can't find my, sweet release 
So let me rest in peace 

You know, 
You got a willing slave 
You just love to play the thought 
That you might misbehave 
Till you do, 
I'm telling you 
Stop visiting my grave 
Let me rest in peace 

I know I should go 
But I follow you like a man possessed 
There's a traitor here beneath my breast 
And it hurts me more than you've ever guessed 
If my heart could beat, it would break my chest 
but I can see you're unimpressed 
So leave me be and 

Let me rest in peace 
Let me get some sleep 
Let me take my love and bury it 
Im a hole 6-foot deep 
I can lay my body down 
But I can't find my sweet release 
Let me rest in peace 
Why won't you 
Let me rest in peace?
