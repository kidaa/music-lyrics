Father forgive me
Mother forsake me
I think they've all become to strong
Brother believe me
Silence is deadly
And it's giving me the strength to carry on
Time has come, now I'm blind deaf and numb
Your killing me, your killing me
When I look into your eyes I can see it's
The world that you despise
And your giving me the strength to carry on
Forgive me...
Look for the devils in their eyes,
Laughing, the blood has long been dried
To hide in your disguise it goes on and on and on....
Wallow, pearls before swine
If the liar deceives you
The the sin will appear true
Even if it leads me to the end
Killer accuse me
The devil breathes easy
Giving me the strength to carry on
Time has come, now I'm blind deaf and numb
Your killing me, your killing me
When I look into your eyes I can see it's
The world that you despise
And your giving me the strength to carry on
Look for the devils in their eyes,
Laughing, the blood has long been dried
To hide in your disguise it goes on and on and on....
Wallow, pearls before swine
Now you've blown away the sun
Darkened eyes and bitten tongue
Now you've blown away the son
