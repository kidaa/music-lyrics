Buffy

Life's a show and we all play a part 
And when the music starts, 
We open up our hearts 

It's all right if some things come out wrong. 
We'll sing a happy song 
And you can sing along. 

Where's there's life, 
There's hope. 
Everyday's
A gift. 
Wishes can 
Come true. 
Whistle while 
You work. 
So hard 
All day. 

To be like other girls 
To fit in in this glittering world. 
Don't give me songs. 
Don't give me songs. 

Give me something to sing about. 
I need something to sing about. 

Life's a song 
You don't get to rehearse. 
And every single verse 
Can make it that much worse. 

Still my friends 
Don't know why I ignore 
The million things or more 
I should be dancing for. 

All the joy 
Life sends. 
Family
And friends. 
All the twists 
And bends 
Knowing that 
It ends. 
Well that 
Depends

On if they let you go, 
On if they know enough to know 

That when you bow 
You leave the crowd. 

There was no pain, 
No fear, no doubt 
Till they pulled me out 
Of heaven. 

So that's my refrain. 
I live in hell 
'Cause I've been expelled 
From heaven. 
I think I was in heaven. 

So give me something to sing about. 
Please give me something. 

Life's not a song. 
Life isn't bliss. 
Life is just this. 
It's living. 
You'll get along. 
The pain that you feel 
Only can heal 
By living. 
You have to go on living. 
So that one of us is living.
