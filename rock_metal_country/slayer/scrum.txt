No blood no glory
All pain and fury
A demonstration
Of domination
Show of pure intimidation

[Lead: King]

Full contact why I live and breathe
Side stepping all the human debris
Head strong I know that I'll prevail
Face down in my arena you will fail
Head to head eye to eye
Human pile of proven pride
Ripping flesh spitting teeth
Sacrifice for victory
Base line Goal line
Overtime Killing time
Relentless brotherhood of discipline
Centuries of tradition is to win
Head first into battle feel the rush
Living on adrenaline your try is crushed

[Lead: King]

No blood No glory
All pain And fury
Head to head eye to eye
Human pile of proven pride
Ripping flesh spitting teeth
Sacrifice for victory
Base line Goal line
Overtime Killing time
