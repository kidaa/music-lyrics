I want to
Invite you
Welcome you
To my hate
To my scorn
To myself
Saturate you
Infest you
Betray you
Stimulate you
So eager for my lies

For my lies... Lies

Lies in the name of God

[Lead: King]

I take you
I play you
Invade you
Lacerate you
I scar your
Innocence
Masticate you
Ingest you
Become you
Defenseless
I fill your emptiness

With my lies... Lies

Lies in the name of God
In this world of shit I exist
Perfect world conforms I resist
Disconnect the nerves from the spine
Desecrate the walls of the mind
Through these eyes no love is alive
Through these eyes unrest never dies
Through these lies compassion is lost
Through these lies await the Ungod
Antichrist is the name of God
Antichrist is the name of God
Antichrist is the name of God
Antichrist is the name of God

[Lead: King]
