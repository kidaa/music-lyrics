Buffy, Giles, Xander, Anya, Tara, Willow 

It doesn't matter 
What can't we face if we're together? 
What's in this place that we can't weather? 
Apocalypse 
We've all been there 
The same old trips 
Why should we care? 
All: What can't we do if we get in it? 
We'll work it through within a minute 
We have to try 
We'll pay the price 
It's do or die 
Hey, I've died twice 
All: What can't we face 
What can't we face? 
If we're together? 
What's in this place 
That we can't weather? 
We're together 
There's nothing we can't face 
Except for bunnies
