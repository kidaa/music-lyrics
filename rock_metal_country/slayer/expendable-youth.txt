[SLAYER - 1990 -  Seasons In The Abyss ]
[Lyrics: King / Music: Araya]

Gun down cold on a raw deal
Home turf my battlefield
In no one's way caught in a crossfire
Stray bullets can kill

[Chorus:]
Expendable youths
Fighting for possession
Having control... the [sings  a ] principle obsession
Rivalry and retribution
Death the only solution

Injured soul lies on the ground [sings  Injured soul on the hard ground ]
Head blown off face down
Lying in a pool of blood
An accidental death homicide

[Chorus]

[Solo: Hanneman, King]

Struggling to survive
The [sings  This ] drug induced warfare
Having control... and [sings  or ] principle obsession
Expandable youth... fighting for possession
Violence is only a friend

[this is printed but he sings the ordinary chorus:]
Expendable youth
Fight for possession
To have control... your principle obsession
Rivalry and retribution
Death the only solution
