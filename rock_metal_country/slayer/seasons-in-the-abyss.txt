[SLAYER - 1990 -  Seasons In The Abyss ]
[Music: Hanneman / Lyrics: Araya]

Razors edge
Outlines the dead
Incisions in my head
Anticipation the stimulation
To kill the exhilaration

[Chorus:]
[part 1]
Close your eyes
Look deep in your soul
Step outside yourself
And let your mind go
Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die

[part 2]
Close your eyes
And forget your name
Step outside yourself
And let your thoughts drain
As you go insane... go insane

[this verse has changed place with verse 3]
Inert flesh
A bloody tomb
A decorated splatter brightens the room
An execution a sadist ritual
Mad intervals of mind residuals

Close your eyes
Look deep in your soul
Step outside yourself
And let your mind go
Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die

Close your eyes... and forget your name
Step outside yourself... and let your thoughts drain
As you go insane... go insane

[Solo: King, Hanneman]

[this verse has changed place with verse 2]
Innate seed
To watch you bleed
A demanding physical need
Desecrated, eviscerated
Times prostrated [sings  perpetuated ]
