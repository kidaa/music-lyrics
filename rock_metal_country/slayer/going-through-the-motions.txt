Buffy, Demons 

Every single night the same arrangement 
I go out and fight the fight 
Still, I always feel the strangest estrangement 
Nothing here is real, 
Nothing here is right 
I've been making shows of trading blows 
Just hoping no one knows 
That I've been 

Going through the motions 
Walking through the part 
Nothing seems to penetrate my heart 
I was always brave and kind of righteous 
Now I find I'm wavering 
Crawl out of your grave you'll find this fight 
Just doesn't mean a thing 
She ain't got that swing 
Thanks for noticing 
She does pretty well with fiends from hell 
But lately, we can tell 
That she's just 

Going through the motions 
Faking it somehow 
She's not even half the girl she... 
ow 
Will I stay this way forever? 
Sleepwalk through my life's endeavour 
How can I repay you? 
Whatever 
I don't want to be 

Going through the motions 
Losing all my drive 
I can't even see 
If this is really me 
And I just wanna be 
Alive
