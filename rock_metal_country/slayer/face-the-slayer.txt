[Lyrics - King; Music - Hanneman, King]

A misty night, a perfect night
Beneath the cold of the frozen star
You feel the fright, you know I'm near
You never should have come this far
I am alive, you can't kill me
I will survive eternity

Go through the fire walk past the dead
Lost in my eternal maze
Your heart pounds through the mist filled air
Your concentration breaks for me to strike
You've cowered down, you've broken the chain
Now I can freeze your burning eyes

You see me lift the axe, as it plunges through your shield
You now begin to panic as you see your chances grow slim
Your running through the endless maze
You Turn and I'll be there
A force too strong for you to fight
Your end I'll see tonight  I'll see your end tonight 

You think you can destroy me You'd better think again
I am eternal terror my quest will never end
I'll trap you in the pentagram
And seal your battered tomb
Your life is just another game
For Satan's night of doom
