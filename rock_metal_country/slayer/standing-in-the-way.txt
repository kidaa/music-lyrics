Giles

You're not ready 
For the world outside 
You keep pretending, 
but you just can't hide 
I know I said that I'd 
Be standing by your side 
But I 

Your path's unbeaten, 
And it's all uphill 
And you can meet it, 
But you never will 
And I'm the reason that you're standing still 
But I 

I wish I could say 
The right words 
To lead you through this land 
Wish I could play the father 
And take you by the hand 
Wish I could stay here 
But now I understand 
I'm standing in the way 

The cries around you, 
You don't hear at all 
'Cause you know I'm here 
To take that call 
So you just lie there when 
You should be standing tall 
But I 

I wish I could 
Lay your arms down 
And let you rest at last 
Wish I could 
Slay your demons 
But now that time has passed 
Wish I could stay here 
Your stalwart, standing fast 
But I'm 
Standing in the way 
I'm just standing 
In the way
