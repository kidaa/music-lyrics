Unknown are the caverns of the mind
New realms of affliction lurk inside
Unbound massive mental energy
Your last breaths taken from you easily

[lead: Hannemann]

Mind control, pain unfolds
I own all your sensations
Weakening, reasoning
Mesmeric full demolition
Hypnotized - victimized
Behold the threshold to the web
Screaming souls fear echoes
Piercing boundaries of the dead

[lead: King]

Penetration of the windows to your soul
Deterioration of the mind, no self control
Temporarily comprehend no memories
Hollow carcass of a man is all I leave

Execution but a thought in the end
slowly erasing your life and what has been
Passing victims in the land of secrecy
Cerebral death can come to you in your dreams
