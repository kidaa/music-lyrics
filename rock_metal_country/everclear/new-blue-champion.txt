I don't want to hear you say you're sorry 
I don't want to hear you say we can start all over again 
I think you must think that I am stupid 
Well I might be stupid for the rest of my life 
But I'll never be stupid to you again 
I just want it all to go away 
Yeah, just go away 
Yeah 

I can see the light above me 
I hear the sound of a brand new song 
I don't want to hear your preaches 
Cause I know what's right, I know what's wrong 
I can see the light above me 
I hear the sound of a brand new day 
I'm not going to settle for less 
I don't think things are going to change 
I just want it all to go away 

I don't want to hear about your damage 
I don't want to hear you say that you think I'm damaged too 
Because I know you know that the damage in me 
Is from the horrible things you say and do 
I know that the damage in me comes from the damage in you 
I just want it all to go away 

I can see the light above me 
I hear the sound of a brand new song 
I don't want to hear your preaches 
Cause I know what's right, I know what's wrong 
I can see the light above me 
I hear the sound of a brand new day 
I'm not going to settle for less 
I don't think things are ever gonna to change 
I just want it all to go away 
Yeah, just go away 
Yeah, I don't want to talk about it 
I don't want to hear your lies 
I don't want to talk about it 
And I dont understand why you do not realize 

I don't want to hear you say you're sorry 
No, I don't want to hear you say we can start all over again 
Whoa, I can see the light above me 
I hear the sound of a brand new song 
And I don't want to know your reasons 
Cause I know what's right, I know what's wrong 
I can see the light above me 
I hear the sound of a brand new day 
I can picture the lives without you 
And I don't think things are ever gonna change 
I just want it all to go away 
I can see the light above me 
The sound of a brand new song 
I don't want to know your reasons 
Cause I know what's right, I know what's wrong
