It can come from out of nowhere,
hit you when you're safe and warm.
Take it easy, my star your time is gonna come,
your time is gonna come. 

Yeah, you got those crazy blue eyes.
You got those crazy blues.
All those pretty smiles,
I can see them laughing at you.
Your time is gonna come, your time is gonna come. 

I don't wanna be your punching bag,
your complacent little princess all tragic and sad.
I'm not gonna let you overwhelm me anymore.
Yeah, you say you got this bad thing, you say you've got it bad.
You have broken every heart of every friend you've ever had.
Yeah, the time is gonna come when all your friends just go away.
I wonder why you stick around, sometimes I wish you would leave.
You say you love me forever, then you spit on me.
Your time is gonna come,
I swear your time is gonna come. 

I don't want to be your whipping boy.
Yes, your happy little loser, someone you can ignore.
I'm not gonna let you overwhelm me anymore.
I'm not gonna let you hurt me anymore.
I'm not gonna let you hit me anymore.
No, I will not let you kick me anymore.
I will not let you overwhelm me anymore. 

It can come from out of nowhere.
I don't want to be your simple saving grace,
just another little victim with a happy face.
Someday, someday soon, somebody's gonna come,
I hope they do this to you. 

I'm not gonna let you overwhelm me.
I will not let you hurt me anymore.
No, I will not let you hit me anymore.
I will not let you twist me anymore.
No, I will not let you turn me inside out.
