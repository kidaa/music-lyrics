I will live, I will live
Maybe for a year or two, maybe for a year
I will die, I will die, I can rest secure in that
I am awful sure that this thing ain't no accident 
And I just can't believe that AIDS is just some act of God
I will reach for you, I will reach my hand 
No one will reach for me, no one will touch my skin
Yes I will accept, I will accept my pain
I don't deserve to die like this, no one deserves to die like this 
Sometimes I get so mad I just want to break the world
I will not be denied, I will not be ignored 
I'm not invisible anymore 
I will not be denied, I will not be ignored
I'm real, I won't go away
I am not invisible anymore 
Sometimes I get so mad I just want to break the world
