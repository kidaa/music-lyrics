It's just like science fiction 
Who knows what the fuck they're talking about 
There's always one in every crowd 

There is always one in every crowd 
You can hear the voices when you're alone 
They sound like middle-long, middle obxious and loud 
Don't let go, don't listen to the sound of those people you know 
Slowly falling apart 
And falling down now 
Everything is falling down now 

When I think I'm alone 
I watch the news on my girlfriend's tv 
It's like a bad B movie 
All sometimes I can't comprend all the stupid things that I see 
So don't let go, 
Can't believe your eyes 
Whatever they may show you 
Just makes you want to cry and you don't want to know 
That you need to remember that life is always getting better 
So don't let go 

There is always one in every crowd 
You see them when you think you're alone 
It all just seems like science fiction 
Nobody knows what they're talking about 
So don't let go, don't listen to the sounds of all those people you know 
Slowly falling apart 
And falling down now 
You need to remember 
Life is always getting better 
Life is always getting better 
Life is always getting better 
For a while
