You do that Romeo
Be what you wanna be
Look like you runnin' in place
Do that stupid dance for me
Do that Romeo
That go-go Romeo
I see you twist and turn
You look so stupid, happy, and numb
Be my Romeo
Please be my voice in this world
I can't sing the songs that you sing
I can't find the gorgeous words
Will you be my Romeo
My go-go Romeo
I see you twist and turn you look so stupid
I feel just like a local god when I'm with the boys
We do what we want, yes we do what we want
I feel just like a local god when I'm with the boys
We do what we want, yeah we do what we want
Be my Romeo
Tell me all about your love
Tell me all about your pain
Baited breath and rubber gloves
Be my Romeo
My go-go Romeo
I see you twist and turn you look so fuckin' stupid
I feel just like a local god when I'm with the boys
We do what we want, yes we do what we want
Summer days can lead to the bad times
The world gets larger everyday
Yeah, yeah, the summer days can lead to the bad blood
That leaves me feelin' stupid, happy, and numb
Stupid, happy, and numb
I feel so stupid, happy and numb
Stupid, happy and numb
I feel so stupid
I feel just like a local god when I'm with the boys
We do what we want, we do what we want
