Never said I was innocent
I will burn in Hell for the things I've done to you
Never said I was anything good
I should die from the shame from what I put you through
Let me be the one to bring us back from the dead
I will take the blame for everything
You know I just wanna help you forget
We are still living on broken glass
We are still numb because it just keeps happening
All your friends, they can kiss my ass
They only see the simple things that they wanna see
Let me be the one to make the pain go away
Shave my skin and show a brand new face
You know I just wanna know that you're okay
You don't have to like it but the swing is in my hands now
Sometimes I think
The power is better than a hard drug
Sometimes I think
The power is better than anything
Sometimes I think
Letting go is just like giving up
Sometimes all I think I wanna do is die inside
All I wanna do is die inside
All I ever think about is you and me falling apart
Never said I was innocent
I will burn in Hell for the things I have done to you
Never said I was anything good
Na na na na
Let me be the one to make the pain go away
Shave my skin and show a brand new face
You know I just wanna know that you're okay
Let me be the one to bring us back from the dead
I will take the blame for everything
I just wanna help you forget
Sometimes I think
Letting go is just like giving up
Sometimes all I think about is falling apart
