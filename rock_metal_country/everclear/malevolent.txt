Maybe I went too far this time
I just go crazy when she says no
Angel turns away pulls her dress back down
Slowly washes her face 
Takes the bus to her job downtown 
She said, I'm OK, don't worry about me
Now she thinks for herself, hey what just happened to me
I told him that I thought it was over, I told him that I wanted to leave
He used to touch me so nice when we first met
I never dreamed he would hit me, I never dreamed he would hold me down
She said, don't worry about me, I won't worry about you 
I don't want to be friends
She said, I'm OK
Just leave me alone
She said don't worry about me, I won't worry about you 
She said, I'm OK, don't worry about me
I don't want to be friends
Just leave me alone
Don't worry about me
