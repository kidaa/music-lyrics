I used to know a girl
She had two pierced nipples and a black tattoo
We'd drink that Mexican beer
We'd live on Mexican food
Yes, I wish I could go back
Yes, back in time
Esther used to be the kind of girl that you would never leave
She'd do anything to give me what I need for my disease
She'd do anything
I can hear them talking in the real world
But they don't understand that I'm happy in hell
With my heroin girl
I am losing myself in a white-trash hell
Lost inside a heroin girl
They found her out in the fields
About a mile from home
Her face was warm from the sun
But her body was cold
I heard the policeman say
Just another overdose
Esther used to be the kind of lover you would never leave
She'd do anything to give me what I need for my disease
She would do anything
