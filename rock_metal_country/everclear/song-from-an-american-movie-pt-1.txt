The only thing that ever made sense to me
Is the words to a song from an American movie
The only thing that ever made sense in my life
Is the sound of my little girl laughing
Through the window of a summer night

I sit alone in the back yard
Wishing I could be inside
Just the sound of my little girl laughing
Makes me happy just to be alive...
