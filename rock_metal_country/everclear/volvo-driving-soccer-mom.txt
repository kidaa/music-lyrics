You know I used to be a bad girl 
I got busy in the bathroom at my high school prom 
Yeah I used to be a dancer at the local strip club 
But now I know my right wing from my wrong 

Yeah, yeah 

I really used to be a bad girl 
I had a threesome with my sister and her boyfriend Tom 
I know I used to be a real wild child 
But now I am a Volvo-driving soccer mom 

Na-na na-na na-na na-na na-na na-na 

I really used to be a bad girl 
I got busted for possession of my wizard-shaped bong 
I used to love to do the things they tell me not to do 
But now I'm different--now I sing a new song 

I really used to be a bad girl 
I got gang-banged in the bathroom at my high school prom 
Yes, I used to be a real wild child 
But now I am a Volvo-driving soccer mom

Where do all the porn stars go 
When the lights go down? 
I wonder where all the porn stars go 
'Cause when you need one, they are never around 

I think they moved out to the suburbs 
And now they're blonde, bland, middle-class Republican wives 
They all have blonde, bland, middle-class Republican children 
Blonde, bland, middle-class Republican lives 

Where do all the porn stars go 
When the lights go down? 
I think I know where all the porn stars go 
They all become Volvo-driving soccer moms
