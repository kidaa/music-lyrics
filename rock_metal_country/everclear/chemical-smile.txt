She lost her focus yesterday
She lost her focus in the sun
She sits and stares at it for hours
She says she likes to go outside
She gets hung up on the wind
She gets lost inside the happy noise
Sometimes I don't understand her
Sometimes I don't want to understand her
She says no, no, no, no, no, no
She don't want no double life
She says I should know why
She seems happier at night
Her color TV and her chemical smile
I don't wanna know the reason
I don't wanna know the reason why
She says, she says, she says, she says, she says
Jesus owes her money
She says, she says, she says, she says, she says
The angels are her friends
What the hell does that mean
She's got the chemical smile
Yeah she's got a chemical smile
Yeah she's got the chemical smile
Baby's got a chemical smile
She says, she says
