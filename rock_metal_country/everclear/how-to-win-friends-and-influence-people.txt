It's a beautiful day

If you look up in the air
you can see the sky

It's a beautiful day

if you stare at the sun
you will burn your eyes

I do not believe in the lucky numbers
I do not believe in wishing on a star...
to tell you the truth
people love to tell you things that will break
your heart

yes people love to break your heart

people love to break your heart

i do not believe in the things that i cannot see
I do not believe in the pretty disguise...
to tell you the truth
I know they want me to believe that they
know whats best for me
yes, you know that its true
people love to hit you when you close your eyes
people love to hurt you when you close your eyes

and you will never see it coming

it's a beautiful day

it's a beautiful day 
look up...the sky is down

it's such a beautiful day

look up...the sky is down

it's a beautiful day
look up...the sky is coming down

its a beautiful day
look up...the sky is coming down

its a beautiful day
look up in the air

you will never see it coming
