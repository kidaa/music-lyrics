Right now, day one, I fall soft
When I fall I always fall on you
Face first, head down, eyes closed
Arms out to break my fall, we fall down
Like a world of noise we get lost
Inside the length of our own time
And the laughing world will never forget
It's when you jam that I jet
I jet
I see, I want, I reach
I fail to hold the things that I need
I turn, I reach for you
Wanna touch our life before it fades
Like a burning car in the sun
We flame for the all in plain view
And the laughing world will never forget
It's when you jam that I jet
I jet, I jet, I jet
And the laughing world will never forget
Laughing world will never forget
It's when you jam that I jet
I jet
