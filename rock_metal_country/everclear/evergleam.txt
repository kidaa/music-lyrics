Evergleam and I know why God is good and Jesus loves me
Heaven lives and I know where
Sounds to me a not so easy chair
Falling free and living down
Stringing out and over happy
Evergleam and I know why it isn't real and I'm not going to break
Don't die, don't give in, no way no way
Please don't leave me
Evergleam and I know how pulling hair and breaking voices 
Giving in won't stop the noise 
Spinning wills don't give you choices 
Take away the spark inside, you take away the shining prize 
Evergleam and I know how it isn't real and I'm not going to break 
I'm not going to break
Evergleam, everywhere, ever weird, everyone
I'm not going away, I'm not going away
I won't see you there
I'm not going away, I'm not going to break
No way
