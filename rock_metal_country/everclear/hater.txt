"Yeah, live and let live mother fuckers. I'm going to do me, you do you.
You're all a bunch of haters."

I don't like the way that you talk to me
When you tell me how it's going be
And I don't like the way that you smile at me
When you tell me what is wrong with me
Sometimes I wish you would go away
Go away and never ever come back
I don't like the meaning that makes the things you do
It makes me want to hate on you

Yeah it's got me sad
I'm kind of stressed
You got me feeling anxious
I'm always depressed
And I don't want to play this game of tug of war
I don't want to be with a hater like you anymore

I don't want to be with a hater like you anymore
No I don't want to be with a hater
You are such a hater

I don't like the way that you never took the blame
For absolutely anything
And I don't like the way that you put me through hell
For all those things you do yourself
Sometimes I wish I could disappear
All the way into a happy new life
I don't like the way that you're always telling lies
You talk about me all the time

I hear you talk
You a such a bore
I see the way you look
I think you look like a whore
I know you know I know the way your working for
I don't won't to be with hater like you anymore

I don't want to be with a hater like you anymore
I don't want to be with a hater like you
Hater. Hater
I don't want to be with a hater like you
Hater. Hater
I don't want to be with a hater like you anymore
Anymore...

I don't want to play this game
No I don't want to play these games

Your a hypocrite
Yeah you lie to me
You use words you don't understand
You embarrass me
Yeah your beautiful in a ugly way
Hey the sex was never that good anyway

Its got me down
I am super stressed
I'm taking medication
I'm always depressed
I don't want to fight you in this tug of war
I don't want to be with a hater like you anymore

I don't want to be with a hater like you anymore
I don't want to be with a hater like you
I don't want to be with a hater like you
I don't want to be with a hater like you
Hater
