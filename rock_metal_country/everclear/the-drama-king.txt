She left him a note on the dining room table
She finally had the last word the day that she went away

She left him a note
She hated confrontation
It was impossible to say to him everything she had to say

I am losing my mind, nothing seems right
I do not know who I am anymore
I am losing the fight
I hate my life
I wish that it was easier to be in love

She cries herself to sleep on the floor of her apartment
She found herself a new place about a half a mile away

She drinks herself to sleep
She gets lost inside the darkness
She is making up for lost time every night and every day

I am losing my mind, nothing seems right
I do not know who I am anymore
I am losing the fight because I hate my life  
I wish that it was easier to be in love

You make me want to scream sometimes
No more drama, no more pain
We argue about the same things over and over again

No more drama; I cant take the constant strain
I don't understand why being with you is so goddamned hard
So hard

He found the note when he came home to the empty house
He knew that this was coming  the first time he had seen her face

He walked right out the front door in no particular direction
He had to find the reason why these things always end this way

I am losing my mind, nothing seems right
I don't know who I am anymore

I am losing the fight because I hate my life
I wish there was an easier way
to be in love

I am out of my mind, nothing seems right
I don't know who you are anymore

I am losing this fight because I hate my life
And even though I'm leaving
I am still in love with you
I am still in love with you
I am still in love with you
I am still in love with you
