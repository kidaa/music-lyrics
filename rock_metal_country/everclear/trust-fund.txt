I know a couple who are in love living in the best of times 
A truer-blue love you will never know 
Run from pain they'll never realize
Sheltered from it in a loving glow
Young and happy and oh-so politically correct 
Just get it if you need it now 
Just buy it if you need it in your life 
Don't you worry if it all runs out 
Don't worry 'cause it never will
I know a young girl living in the shadow of
The kind of life that she could never make 
She takes it all and gives it back in love
To handsome artists in her native state 
She is the angel of the loser and the disenchanted soul 
Just get it if you need it now 
Just buy it if it makes you happy 
Don't you worry if it all runs out 
Don't worry because it never will
