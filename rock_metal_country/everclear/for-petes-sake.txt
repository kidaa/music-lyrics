We had a mutual friend and he said
You've been talking again
I'm not responsible for your life falling apart
I'm not responsible
You and me could have been the best friends
That we'd never had
You've done everything that you could to damage me, damage me
I'm walking away
I'm closing my eyes
I'm letting it go, letting it go
Hey I'm telling you now
I'm drawing the line
Don't say it again
Just keep it inside
It happened to me, in love with the same girl
Nobody's fault, yeah nobody's fault
Hey maybe for the first time act like a grown man
Yeah keep it in
You and me could have been the best friends
But we'd never had the best friends
I'm walking away, letting it go
I'm closing my eyes
I'm telling you now
I'm lonely again, just keep it inside
Hey, it happened to me, in love with the same girl
It happened to me, me over you
Hey maybe for the first time act like a grown man
Keep it in
Yeah keep it in
