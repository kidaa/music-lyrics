See you roll your eyes 
You know it makes me smile 
Yes you are like the sun to me 
All bright as liquid fire 
I feel so powerless 
Hold you up above the world 
Yeah you are quite a lot of trouble 
For such a pretty little girl 

I know I'm never home 
I'm always miles and miles away 
Here I'm runnin' out of time 
Say the things I need to say 
I call you on the phone 
You will not talk to me 
Yeah you just don't understand 
You are my everything 

Anna, Anna 
Tell me what you want 
Tell me what you need 
Anna, Anna 
You are never alone... 

I like to watch you play 
When you don't know I'm there 
I watch you in your sleep at night 
Reach out and touch your hair 
I wanna make this world 
Be just how you want it to be 
Yeah you just don't understand 
You are everything to me
