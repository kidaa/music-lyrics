Baby go to bed and put out the light
We both know if we talk anymore
We're gonna end up in a great big fight
You can have your way again
Yeah, you believe what you wanna believe
You can walk all over me tomorrow
But tonight can we both just pretend to sleep

I think we're headed for a big fall
I think we're headed for a bad time
Ooh yeah you're gonna go downstairs 
And sit in that chair you like
Gonna put a John Prine record on
I think we need to slow it down for a while

Yeah I wish we had never bought a king size bed
Yeah only damn thing that it's ever been good for
Plenty room for the real good sex
I lay in bed in the dark and all that I can see
Yeah, is the distance that grows between us
You seem so far from me

I think we're headed for a real big fall
Yes we're headed for a bad time
Yeah gonna go downstairs 
Sit by myself all alone in the middle of the night
Gonna put a John Prine record on
Yes we need to slow it down for a while
Gonna go downstairs 
Smoke cigarettes in a thrift store chair tonight
Gonna put a John Prine record on
Yeah we need to slow it down for a while
We need to slow it down for a while...
