guess who just got back today
those wild eyed boys who'd been away
haven't changed, hadn't much to say
but man i still think those cats are crazy
they were asking if you were around
how you was, where you could be found
i told them you were living downtown
driving all the old men crazy
the boys are back in town

you know that chick who used to dance a lot?
every night she'd be on the floor
shaking what she'd got
man when i tell you she was cool
she was red hot
i mean she was steaming
that time over at johnny's place
well this chick got up and she slapped johnny's face
man we just fell about the place
if that chick don't wanna know forget her
the boys are back in town, spread the word around

friday night they'll be dressed to kill
down at dino's bar and grill
drink will flow and blood will spill
if the boys wanna fight
you better let 'em
that jukebox in the corner blasting out my favorite song
the nights are getting warmer, it won't be long
it won't be long 'till summer comes
now that the boys are here again
