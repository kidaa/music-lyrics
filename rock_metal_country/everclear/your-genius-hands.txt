I have seen you shake
And I know what it cost you
I have heard your words
I am big on your noise
My eyes aren't big enough
'Cause I can't see your hands
I can't see what you hold
I am growin' now
As I watch you fade
Now I know what you know
And I'll break the chains that you have made
This chain you've made for me
Yeah, I will pull you down
I know I'll fail in style
I long to touch your genius hands
I am growin' now
As I watch you fade
Now I know what you know
And I'll break the chains that you have made
This chain you've made for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I will pull you down
I know I'll fail in style
I will, I swear
I'm gonna shake your genius hands
