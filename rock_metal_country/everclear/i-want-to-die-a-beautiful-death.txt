Everybody here in the small town 
Looks used and abused today 
Everybody here is looking outside 
Man, seems like nothing ever changes 
Everybody they just want to have a good time 
Everybody they just want to forget 
Everybody wants to feel like they did when the sky looked good 
And the world was perfect 

I don't care 
I just want to die pretty 
I just want to get lost in the motion 
I just want to get lost in my beautiful self 
I just want to get lost in the city 
I don't want to live forever 
I want to die a beautiful death 

Yeah, I got to get the hell out of this town 
Everybody's looking upside down 
Everybody is looking for the same thing 
Really seems like nothing ever changes 
Everybody they just want to buy a slow ride 
Everybody they just want to get buy 
Everybody wants to feel like they did when the sky looked high 
And the world was simple 

I don't care 
I just want to die pretty 
I just want to get lost in the motion 
I just want to get lost in my beautiful self 
I just want to get lost in the city 
I don't want to live forever 
I want to die a beautiful death 
I want to die a beautiful death 
I just want to die a beautiful death 
I just want to die a beautiful death 
I just want to die pretty 

Oh, oh 
I just want to die pretty 
Just want to die pretty 
Sometimes I just want to die 

I just want to get lost in the moment 
I just want to get lost in the city tonight 
I just want to get lost inside myself 
I don't care about nothing 
I just want to get lost in the motion 
I just want to get lost in my beautiful self 
I just want to get lost in the city 
I don't want to live forever 
I want to die a beautiful death 
I want to die a beautiful death 
Yes, I want to die a beautiful death 
I just want to die a beautiful death 
I just want to die pretty
