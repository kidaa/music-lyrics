Shake that dust from the small town
I turn and follow the western wind down
Go and pack up my shiny things
And go, yeah just go
I'll find a new life in only L.A.
Yeah, stupid happy with everything
I pulled myself down so easily
I know, I know
Met Electra when livin' down
Saw her spinnin' around and around
Never knew much about her past
I knew enough that I didn't ask
I know, I know
Livin' isn't a simple thing, I know
No one said it's supposed to be, I know
Livin' isn't a simple thing, I know
No one said it's supposed to be
I know, I know 
Livin' isn't a simple thing, I know
No one said it's supposed to be, I know
Livin' isn't a simple thing for me
I know ways to make it easier
I know
July she lied, July she lied
July, July, July
Livin' isn't a simple thing, I know
No one said it's supposed to be
Livin' isn't a simple thing for me
I know ways to make it easier
