Do you remember when we were hungry
Do you remember when we were cold
Do you remember when we were happy
Do you remember Do you remember

Do you remember when we were lucky
We were livin' the life almost every night
I would wrap you in my thin white arms
Sit and watch the stars glide

Yeah, do you remember when we were the losers
Do you remember when we were the lame 
Do you remember when we were the lepers
Do you remember Do you remember

Do you remember when we were strung out
Eatin' top ramen, macaroni and cheese
We would get so lost in that basement room
Let the Otis Redding sing us to sleep
I wish I had one more life

I don't wanna be wasted
I don't wanna live inside this daydream anymore
I just wanna be happy again
I don't wanna be wasted, I dont wanna be blind

I don't wanna be wasted
I don't wanna live inside this daydream anymore
I just wanna be happy again
I don't wanna be wasted, I don't wanna be blind
I don't wanna be wasted, I don't wanna be blind
I don't wanna be wasted, I don't wanna be blind

I wish I could be like all my heroes
I wish I could be like all yours too
I wish I could sing like Otis Redding
I wish I could play this guitar in tune

Do you remember when we were hungry
Do you remember when we were cold
Do you remember when we were happy in a way
No one outside could ever know
I wish I had one more life
How I wish I had one more life to live

I don't wanna be wasted
I don't wanna live inside of this daydream anymore
I just wanna be happy again
I don't wanna be wasted, I don't wanna be blind

I don't wanna be wasted
No, I don't wanna live inside of this daydream anymore
I just wanna be happy again
I dont wanna be wasted, I don't wanna be
I dont wanna be wasted, I don't wanna be
I dont wanna be wasted, I don't wanna be blind
No, I don't want to be blind
No, I don't want to be blind
