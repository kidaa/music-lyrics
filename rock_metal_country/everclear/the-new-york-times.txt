Oh, 
It makes no sense to me 
Yeah, I was living in a different world when I heard the news 
I keep having the same bad dream 
And it makes me want to hurt all the people who have done this thing to you 

When I see your face, I can see you smile 
Read all about you in the New York times 
When I see your eyes, I can see your light 
When I think about what happened 
It makes me crazy 

It makes no sense to me, 
This eye for an eye thing, 
It has gone too far 
I don't know anyone who doesn't hurt inside 
I would like to believe we could learn from this 
And maybe some day we can make things right 
I want to believe in this world 
I want to believe in this life 
I want to believe in a world that does not seem real 
When you read between the lines 

When I see your face, I can see you smile 
Read all about you in my New York times 
When I see your eyes, I can see your light 
When I read about the world 
It makes me crazy 
I want to believe in this world 
I want to believe in this life 
I want to believe in a world that does not seem real 
When you read between the lines 
Gotta read between the lines 
Whoa, gotta read between the lines 
I really want to believe I can make things right 
I want to believe I can learn to feel alright inside 
I want to believe I can learn to make things right 
Oh, I want to believe in this world 
I want to believe in this life 
I want to believe in a world that does not seem real 
When I read the New York Times 

I see your face, I see your smile 
Read all about you in the New York Times 
I can see your eyes, I can see your light 
When I think about what happened 
It just makes me crazy 
When I close my eyes 
You seem so alive 
I really think about you 
I want to believe we can make things right 
I want to believe 
I want to believe 
I want to believe 
I want to believe 
Oh, I want to believe in this world 
I want to believe in this life 
I want to believe in a world that does not seem real 
When I read the New York Times
