She was an American girl
Raised on promises
She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life
Somewhere else
After all it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
And if she had to die tryin'
She had one little promise she was gonna keep
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl
It was kind of cold that night
She stood alone on the balcony
She could hear the cars roll by
Out on four forty one like waves crashing on the beach
And for one desperate moment there
She crept back in her memory
God, it's so painful when something that's so close
Is still so far out of reach
