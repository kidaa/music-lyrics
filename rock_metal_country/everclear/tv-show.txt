I walk around in the market, late at night 
I walk around in the empty aisles 
And I don't know why 
I need to be, close to the light 
So I walk around in the middle of the night 
I drive around in the neighbourhood 
I want to lose my house 
I drive around on the freeway, 
I guess I want to lose myself 
Turn the key, turn the dial 
Listen to the radio and just drive for a while 
Yeah, I got no place to go 
I wish I could come home 
To a life that looks like a TV show 
Wish I could see my television family waiting for me 
Where no one fights, no one screams 
No one lies, and no one leaves 
I don't care how the story ends 
I want to feel like I'm living again 

I drive away from the city 
Need to see the sky 
Drive away from the bad things 
That made me close my eyes 
Leave it all, in the past 
Drive away going nowhere fast 
Yeah, I got no where to go 
I wish I could go home 
To a life that looks like a TV show 
Wish I could see my television family waiting for me 
Where no one fights, no one screams 
No one lies, and no one leaves 
I don't care how the story ends 
I want to feel like I use to feel 
I want to feel like I'm living again 
Whoa, I'm living again 
Whoa, I'm living again 
Whoa, breathing out and breathing in 
Whoa, I'm living again 

Walking away from the circle 
Need to find myself 
I think I need to start over 
Need to start making sense 
Breathe out, breathe in 
I wish I could start all over again 
I wish I could do it all over again 
I wish I could come home 
To a life like the one that I use to know 
I wish I could some day see everything back the way it use to be 
Where no one cries, no one screams 
No one hits you, and no one leaves 
Everybody knows how the story ends 
All the bad guys lose and the good guys win 
I wish I could do it all over again 
Ooh, I want to feel some day I can really start living again 
Whoa, I'm living again 
Whoa, I'm living again 
Whoa, I'm living again 
Whoa, I'm living again
