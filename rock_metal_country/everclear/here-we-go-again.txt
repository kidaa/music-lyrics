"Here we go again!"

You know I like to watch you sleep
No I don't wanna touch you, you'll get mad at me
No I don't wanna think about the bad times
Anyone could have a bad year

Now I don't want you to show me
Do not want you to know me
The way I used to be
All these good things we have
Would not mean a damn to me
And I don't wanna hear those words you feel you have to say
When you find out how I used to be
Back in the day

Yeah, you know I like the way you slide
Yeah, yes I like it when you do that slow glide
Now, please don't badtalk all those good times
Don't ask for answers, baby, that you do not want to hear

Now I don't want you to make me
Do not need you to break me
Of all my childish ways
I'm still the same, you know
Dumb, rock hard, and good to go
I still hear them voices calling me from back in the day
Oh baby can't you see there ain't no place I'd rather be

Then watchin' dirty movies
In that happy room with you
Sleepin' on a mattress in the corner
Eating Chinese food
I hear that voice in my head
Say here we go again

Now here we go again

I know you like the way I rock
Sometimes I just need to drown out all that bad talk
Yeah, I could not care less what your friends say
Someone's always talkin' shit about the old days

You do not need to remind me
That I left it all behind
Those things I used to do
I don't want that other life 'cause I am so in love with you
I can barely hear it calling me from back in the day
Oh baby can't you see there ain't no place I'd rather be

Then watching dirty movies
In that happy room with you
Sleepin' on a mattress in the corner
Eating Chinese food
I hear that voice in my head
Say here we go again

Yeah here we go again
Oh baby here we go again
I know, here we go...

Baby baby can't you see

Yes I know you got some doubts
I know you don't believe
I know you think I'm crazy
Yeah but I know you're just like me
When I hear that voice inside me
Makes me want to jump right in
Sayin' here we go
Here we go
Here we go
Here we go again

Let's go watch some dirty movies 
Yes in that nasty little room
Sleepin' on the mattress while we eat that greasy Chinese food
I hear that voice in my head
Say here we go again

Baby, here we go again
