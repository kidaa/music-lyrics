scary john gets his strong arm on
he can break me and make me
happy with his blackjack

scary john has the heavy hand on
he smiles without his eyes
nice and easy with his blackjack

don't tell me that
you didn't see this coming down

please dont say that this
isn't what you wanted now

scary john gets his strong arm on
he can break me and make me 
happy with his blackjack

scary john
always knows what's goin on
he is everywhere
happy with his blackjack

please don't tell me that
you didn't see this coming down
please don't say that this
isn't what you wanted now

everything is simple in the
white and the black

you will never have to be afraid
when you are happy with the blackjack

i hope you are happy with the blackjack

scary john

that this isn't what you asked for

everthing is simple in the
white and the black
