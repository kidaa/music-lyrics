You pull me down
To the floor
Of our apartment

A little while later
We are laughing at our
carpet burns

I like the way that it
glows outside
As the room gets darker

How I wish we could stay
like this
While the rest of the
world turns

There has never been a time
When I didn't want to be
your boyfriend

There has never been a time
When I didn't want to know
your name

Free falling from a work
in progress
Free falling from a life on hold

There has never been a time
When I didn't want you

My good lover
Is my one good thing
these days

You help me keep it all
From slipping away

I swear I'm going to
Marry you
Someday someday

I am all alone
And it seems like
All I do is wait
We spend hours on the phone
But it's never the same

No, nothing good ever does
come easy
Nothing good ever comes
without a fight

I am all alone
And I wish I was home
With you tonight

Yes, my good lover
Is my one good thing
these days

You help me keep it all
From slipping away

I swear I'm going to
Marry you
Someday

My girlfriend is like
Magic in the hand
When I lose my sparkle
She's the one
that understands

I know I'm going to marry you
someday

I swear I'm going to marry you
someday

I swear I'm going to marry you...

Someday
