I am dreaming of a Michigan girlfriend
All bright-eyed and happy in pain
I am dreaming of a Michigan girl
See her come around
Fall down, break & scatter everywhere
I close my eyes and I can see her waiting
I am pleading for a Michigan dream girl
I am pleading for a Michigan girl
See her come around
Big lie wrapped inside her little glove
I close my eyes and I can see her waiting patient for me
I cover my ears
I clear my mind
She starts to fade
I am dreaming of a Michigan girlfriend
She's starting to fade
I am dreaming of a Michigan girl
I close my eyes
I see her waiting oh so patient for me
I cover my ears
I close my mind
She's starting to fade
