Here he comes, here comes Speedracer
He's a demon on wheels
He's a demon and he's gonna be chasing after someone
He's gaining on you so you better look alive
He's busy revving up the powerful Mach-5
And when the odds are against him and there's dangerous work
You can bet your life Speedracer will see it through

Go Speedracer
Go Speedracer
Go Speedracer, go

He's off and flying as he guns his car around the track
He's jamming down the pedal like he's never coming back
Adventure's waiting just ahead!
