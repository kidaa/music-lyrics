Here is the money that I owe you 
So you can pay the bills
I will give you more when I get paid again
I hate those people who love to tell you
Money is the root of all that kills
They have never been poor
They have never had the joy of a welfare Christmas
I know we will never look back
You say you wake up crying
Yes and you don't know why
You get up and you go lay down inside my baby's room
I guess i'm doing ok
I moved in with the strangest guy
Can you believe he actually thinks that I am really alive
I will buy you a garden where your flowers can bloom
I will buy you a new car, perfect shiny and new
I will buy you that big house way up in the west hills
I will buy you a new life
Yes I will
I know all about that other guy
The handsome man with athletic thighs
I know about all the times before
With that obsessive little rich boy
They might think you're happy
Yeah maybe for a minute or two
They can't make you laugh
No they can't make you feel the way that I do
I know we can never look back
Will you please let me stay the night
No one will ever know
