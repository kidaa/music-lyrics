Yes, I think it's safe to say 
I feel good about the place 
That I've been made in the world today 
I get all sticky inside 
When I close my eyes 
And I open up wide 

I see pictures in the clouds 
So obscene I gotta laugh out loud 
I look back to find my way 
Reminisce and laugh about the good old days 

Yeah, when I saw my brother above me 
I remember the words he said 
When you dream you hit bottom 
Chances are good you're gonna wake up dead 
I'll be up on top when the sky falls down 
And it all goes wrong again 

Yeah, I will be sitting on top 
When It All Goes Wrong Again 
Yeah, I will be sitting on top 
When It all goes wrong. 

Yes I think it's safe to say 
I feel good about the sins 
That I inflict on my own skin 

I pay money to cut and burn 
Pictures like the lessons that I need to learn 
I see faces on the ceiling 
I see them move, I hear them singing 
I lay back in here by myself 
I think about the time that I've spent in hell 

When I saw my brother below me 
I remember the words he said 
When you leave you wake up happy 
Then you'll sleep right in your own warm bed 
I'll be singing in the rain when the bad dreams com
And It All Goes Wrong Again

Woh, I will be singing in the rain
When It All Goes Wrong Again
Woh, Woh I will be singing in the rain
When It All Goes Wrong

Where are you gonna be 
When it all comes down 
What are you gonna do 
When it all comes down 
Where are you gonna be 
When It all comes down 
What are you gonna do 
When it all comes down on you

I'll be sitting on top of the world 
When It All Goes Wrong Again
I'll be sitting on top of the world
When It All Goes Wrong Again 
I'll be sitting on top when the sky falls down 
And It All Goes Wrong Again
Woh I will be sitting on top when it all goes wrong again 
Woh, Woh I will be sitting on top when it all goes wrong again 
Again and again 
I will be sitting on top when it all goes wrong 
Yeah, when it all goes wrong again 
Aw, when it all goes wrong again 
Oh, When it all goes wrong again 

When it all goes wrong again 
When it all goes wrong again 
When it all goes wrong again 
When it all goes wrong again 
When it all goes wrong again 
When it all goes wrong
