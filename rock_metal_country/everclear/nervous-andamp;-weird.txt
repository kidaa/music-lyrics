You know I want to be the way you want me to
Big hearted and tall enough to cover you 
I would break in half if you said it loud 
Splinter out of myself just like mercury 
I think it's better now than how it used to be 
You were lying in bed and I would levitate 
I think it's better here than where we used to be
I wish I could go out into the Oregon sun: to be alive in the day
I'd smile at everyone
I remember you back in '83
You were dressing insane, you were my everything
You were so different from all those other girls 
A blind Electra in drag, so cool and casually lame
I think I'm better now than how I used to be
Always nervous and weird, scared most of the time
I think it's better now than how it used to be 
Always up in the night, afraid to live in the day
Afraid of being afraid
Now I sit alone when you're not around 
I read aloud just to hear a friendly voice 
I see you scary dolls, they all look at me 
From the corner of my eye I see them shake their heads
You know I want to be the way you me to 
Big hearted and tall enough to cover you
I wish I could go out just to be alive in the day
