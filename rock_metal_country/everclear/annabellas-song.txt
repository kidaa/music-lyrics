I see you roll your eyes
You know it makes me smile
You are like the sun to me
Bright as liquid fire
I feel so powerless
To hold you up above the world
You are quite a lot of trouble
Such a pretty little girl
Such a pretty little girl

You know I'm never home
I'm always miles and miles away
I feel I'm runnin' out of time 
Say the things I need to say
Call you on the telephone 
You will not talk to me
Yeah you just don't understand
You are my everything 

Anna, Anna
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
Anna, Anna, you are never alone
You are never alone

Anna, Anna
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
Anna, Anna, you are never alone
You are never alone

I like to watch you play
When you don't know I'm there
See you in your sleep at night
Reach out and touch your hair
I wanna make this world
Be just how you want it to be
Yeah you just don't understand
You're my everything

Anna, Anna
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
Anna, Anna, you are never alone
You are never alone
