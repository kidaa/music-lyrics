This is a song about Spike
He is a bad ass guy
Who just happens to be
A really good friend of mine

Everyone I know...yeah
Who knows Spike too
Would agree when
I say the words
That Spike is cool

The problem with
my friend Spike
He has fallen into
a true love with a nice girl
Who has gotta lot of tattoos

He always talks crazy
Whenever she calls
He always talks like a baby
It's obvious now...
She has got him by the balls

She has got him by the balls...
She has got him by the balls

My weird little brother...James
And his ex-girlfriend
They would talk in those
ridiculous voices
We would all be hanging out
getting drunk in
the neighborhood
And they both would make
those ridiculous noises

He would always talk crazy
Whenever she calls
He always talks like a baby
It is obvious now
They have got him by the balls

I hate you
when you talk like that
I wish you could act like a
grown man

they have got you by the balls

I hate you
when you talk like that
I wish you could act like a
grown man

they have got you by the balls

I hate you
when you talk like that
I wish you could act like a
grown up man

they have got you by the balls

You will never see me...
walking that walk
You will never catch me...
talking that babytalk

you know it's true...
they've got you by the balls

Which brings me back to Spike
A good guy to have in a fight
Unless he was
With his girlfriend
Obnoxious on Saturday night

You know he couldn't care less
What anyone thinks
He does not give a damn
No, because he has no shame

He looks so happy
Just like everything is fine
He is oblivious to the fact
That he has no spine

He always talks crazy
you have no shame
Whenever she calls
you have no shame
He talks like a baby
you have no shame
It is obvious...
they have got him by the balls

I hate you
when you talk like that
I wish you could act like a
grown man

they have got him by the balls

I hate you
when you talk like that
I wish you could act like a
grown man

they have got him by the balls

You will never see me...
walking that walk
You will never catch me
....talking that babytalk

you know it's true...
they've got you by the balls

I am not going to let it
get to me

They've got you by the balls
