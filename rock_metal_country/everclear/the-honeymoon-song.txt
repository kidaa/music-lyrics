One, two, three
Two, two, three

You know I love you baby
And I know you love me too
But the fun that day 
Didn't start until
We left on our honeymoon

Stepped off the plane into a warm sunny day
Then we got leid together
The sun shines down on a lonely town
Where the fish all smile 'cause they know us

Our wedding day was warm and sunny
Our friends and family came from out of town
We said I do, then ate some food
And smiled 'til the sun went down

We'll take the zodiac, the Cadillac 
Around the north shore and then we'll head back
The sea turtles come to greet us

So let's get loaded tonight
We'll drink on the flight
Back home, the honeymoon is over

You know I love you baby
And I know you love me too
But the fun that day 
Didn't start until
We left on our honeymoon

We're on our honeymoon
We're on our honeymoon
The fun that day 
Didn't start until
We left on our honeymoon
