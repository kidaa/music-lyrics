I'm a street walking cheetah with a heart full of napalm
I'm a runaway son of a nuclear A-bomb
I am the world's forgotten boy
The one who searches and destroys

Honey please help me out
Somebody gotta save my soul
Baby please plea for me 

Look out honey, 'cause I'm using technology
Ain't got time to make no apology
Soul radiation in the dead of night
Love in the middle of a fire fight

Honey gotta strike me blind
Somebody gotta save my soul
Baby please take my mind 

I'm the world's forgotten boy
The one who's searchin', searchin' to destroy

Look out honey, 'cause I'm using technology
Ain't got time to make no apology
Soul radiation in the dead of night
Love in the middle of a fire fight 

Honey please strike me blind
Somebody gotta save my soul
Baby please take my mind

I'm the world's forgotten boy
The one who's searchin', searchin' to destroy
