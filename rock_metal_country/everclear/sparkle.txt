I remember when you seemed real shiny with the sweat of your voice
Shaky hands super loud and teenage mouth
We were all charmed and taken with your talk 
Now I shudder when I hear the rhythm of your walk 
Now I've got no place to go, I've got no place to go 
I've got no one, nowhere, no one 
I have given up on the sparkle that I saw in you
I have sinned the sin of wanting more 
The belly fire pulls the spirit from the corporate whore 
I'm embarrassed by the plaid you wear 
If I were you I'd hide behind that stupid bleach blonde hair 
Now I've got no place to go, I've got no place to go 
I've got no one, nowhere, no one 
I have given up on the sparkle that I saw in you 
Yeah that simple minded sparkle that I thought I saw
Yes I have wondered why you changed 
I liked it when you were super loud
I wonder if you're giving in, tell me why you're giving in
