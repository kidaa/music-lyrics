I take your word like it was gospel, I'm so eager to please
Yeah I like it when you talk to me
It feels so good inside your shadow, it's the place I need to be
Yeah you know I need to climb you like a tree
There is this place inside where all the good things die
Sometimes I feel like a whore
I hate the way I am around you, I'm so nervous and weird
Sometimes I feel like I'm breathing underwater
You treat me like I am on fire, like I'm something to eat
You make me hate what I see when I see me
Yeah I dream of the day when I learn how to make you pay
Someday I'll teach you to beg, someday, someday
Yes I live for the day when I can hear you say
You make me feel like a whore
Yes I dream of the time when I can make you mine
Maybe then I'll feel half alive, more alive, so alive
There is this place inside where all the good things die
You make me feel like a whore
