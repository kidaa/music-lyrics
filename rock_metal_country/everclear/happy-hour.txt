Hey, makes me wonder,
Why I just let them slip away,
I'd trade my family and my friends,
For an endless happy hour
I know, sometimes I talk too much
Hey, have a drink with me,
And I will tell you what I think,
Yeah I know I look like I am just some drunk to you,
But I know who I was,
And I know who I am
Hey, hey,
Hey makes me wonder,
How I just do it every time
Yeah, pushin', pullin',
Until they just slip and fade away
I still know who I am
Hey, Hey, Hey, 
Hey, have a drink with me, 
And I will tell you when I'm done,
Yeah, trade my family and my friends
For an endless happy hour 
I still know who I am
