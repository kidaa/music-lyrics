I'm not the only one, the only lonely one
You know who you are, afraid to lose your hearts
You sit in the corners of a world gone square
You can see them but to them you'r not there
Did you ever wonder why you'r stranger than - close?
I'm not the only one who's tired of the gun
There must be something more than marching off to war
Bleeding in the trenches 'neath a 90 lb pack
18 years old and never coming back
How can their dying ever make us feel - free?
I'm not the only one trying to get ahead
Working everyday harder than I'm paid
Going through changes - working my job
Thinking things be better if I get on top
With everybody yelling ";Hey, what about me/me?";
