I've been dragged through the mud
Told I ain't enough 
Done a lot of hard livin' in a world that's sometimes cold 
I been pitched and taken in 
My future's looking grim 
Somehow I disconnected along that road
But try as I may  
I can never be the same
This time I'm here to stay
Ricochet
Seen the walking side of death 
The eyes that never rest
Been waiting in a line for the call that never comes
But kid, don't hold your breath
You're only second best
Ain't personal just business being done 
With a paralysing gaze 
I walked onto the stage 
Could I really be the outcast coming home 
As I turn to look at you 
The way you've fallen too 
I hope I can take it when it goes
