Threw my coins out on the wind
Crossed my fingers and tried again
Straight ahead, a collision course
I can't control it anymore
Fate is but a rendezvous
Paths I followed to get to you
Wore my boots down to the heels
How bitter disappointment feels
Out in the blue
Memories like fires glow
Can we forget them, I don't think so
Marched in lines against the odds
I can't forgive the things I saw
Teardrops fall and arrows fly
How many times I've watched you cry
Promises I broke to you
All the things I'm going through
Out in the blue
Oh captain, steer me clear
Make the nightmares disappear
Some things better left alone
Let someone else carry the load
Every year takes its toll
Time keeps cutting at my soul
I know you're out there just like me
Is this the way it's supposed to be
Out in the blue
