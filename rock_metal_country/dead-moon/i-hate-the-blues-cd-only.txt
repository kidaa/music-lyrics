You know my life would be easy
If people would leave me alone
Stop steppin' on my fingers
That I've been workin' to the bone
Maybe then I could get back with you
God damn I hate the blues
I've tried to put 'em in a bottle
Some people pu 'em in their arm
Either way they're gonna kill you
Slowly eat away your heart
If only I could stop the thought of you
God damn I hate the blues
I never learned to listen
To the promises I'd made
I never thought you'd stay away
Leaving me to take the blame
I never thought you'de follow through
God damn I hate the blues
