I remember you a long time back
How you been doing, is that a fact
Times have changed but it don't show
You still look good but I guess you know
Love comes once then it goes
A lot of time in between
I thought of you, did you think of me
All my dreams like Mexico
Turned into dust, rose like smoke
'Cause love comes once then it goes
How long's it been, don't really know
I was on the move out there on my own
Maybe I was wrong who ever knows
Which bend we take, the lonely road
Love comes once, than it goes
