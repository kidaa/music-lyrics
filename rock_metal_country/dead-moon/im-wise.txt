You nag me and you haunt me
And you tell me dirty lies
You think you've pulled it off
But for some time I've realized
That everything you do is to drive me from my mind
I've been listening to the silence for your tiptoes in the night
I'm wise, wise to you
You've never faced the day when judgement comes to town
You've been dealing from the bottom, dealing dirty, deep, and down
You got yourself a boyfriend who'll be comin' 'round tonight
While I'm outside aworkin' and doing overtime
I'm wise, wise to you
You think it's sugar powder 'cause everything's so sweet
When you melt away the glaze of all the people that you see
The more I'm educated, the more I hang on the cord
You can cut the lies 'cause I know what's going on
I'm wise, wise to you
