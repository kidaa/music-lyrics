You own the stations and it's one against one
Turn it up or get it off
You've got the power and the money and the guns
So what's the deal ? It's only bucks
You say your cause is the wreckage of the judged
Do it right or cut it out
You use excuses like you're working with a crutch
Don't play dumb, so what's one
So this is your page, shot down twice
Afraid to take chances that can burn up your life
And you hang in the balance 'cause nobody cares
I've seen your ways, they're going nowhere
Break out the jack, you could've been a rolling stone
You've gotten older but you still feel like a kid
Go back to back, do what you did
You're just a passenger and life is but the course
Break some rules, be a force
Back to back
