I've crossed the line 
I've bent the rules 
Home of the brave 
Red, white, and blue 
I've fought the fire 
Running through my head 
Stood by and watched 
Believed in what they said 
I'm 40 miles of bad road 
A riverbed of potholes 
I know, I know, I know where 
the money goes 
Down a shaft of ratholes 
Lowered by my ankles 
Where dear dogs lie in the 
afterglow 
I've walked the cage 
I've been in cuffs 
I've done the time 
Enough is enough 
I know my rights 
Know when I'm wrong 
But nothing seemed to matter 
Until you came along 
I've wrapped my wounds 
I've closed my eyes 
Escaped to nowhere 
Turning back the tide 
I asked the sage 
What it's gonna take 
To get out of Jordan 
With everything at stake
