There's a point of no return
Where we never seem to learn
We can't have all we wanted
oh, you can see it in our eyes
When nerve begins to die there's no use in pretending
And I go to my room, lock the door To run away from myself
I've got an anger deep inside
Something I can't hide
I don't know what I'm after
It seems I'm always out of turn
And I guess I'll never learn
Who's to blame or what's the matter
So I go to my room, lock the door
And plan my escape
To run away from myself
It's not the warning that I hear
That makes me disappear
Down that narrow stairway
I don't know what I'm looking for
But I know I need it more
Just to know someone is waiting
So I go to my room, close the door
And plan my escape
And run away from myself
