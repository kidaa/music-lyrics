Stranded in the mystery zone
Talks to the buzy tone
His guns are cocked
He's ready for demolition
God it's a bloody mess
And I must confess
He's a hair trigger
Waiting for the final solution
And perfect blue, what are you gonna do
Until it rains, don't watch for storms
Don't count your casualties until there's a war
Clutches the crutches of hate
Ticking like a bomb he waits
Trying to hold on to what he came for
Diming on the 9 to 5
Just to keep alive
Soldiers the shadows on his shoulder
