Bad blood stirring in the boiling pot
finger on the trigger of a gun
an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth
It's an old web being spun
born from the seeds of anger and hatred
do it to them like they do
it's only revenge and the worst of it all
it all comes back to you
Envy treads at the breaking edge
wheredogs begin to wail
sarrow imprisoned the widows eyes
like arrows too, they fell
trying to balance the scales of injustice
do it to them like they do
it's only revenge and the worst of it all
it all comes back to you
the hounds pursue the weary step
as silver etched the sent
chasing down the passions of mans convictions
escaping time he'd never spent
half starved and running
he'll pay for his blindness
racing the bullets of hate
thirteen steps an a dead mans walk
it's always been this way
it all comes back to you
