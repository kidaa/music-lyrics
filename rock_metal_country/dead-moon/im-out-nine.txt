Runaway horses under my hood
can't catch me when I fly
blue sky over me, six feet under me
touch me when you cry
I caught sight of you, I've got altitude
in my clouded eyes
isn't that mainstream? Finding you empty
socially I'm out nine
Innocent highway, stranger than my way
turn me like a page
taken a wrong turn, deafly won't be heard
damaged but I'm ok
checking the chamber, nervous I came here
looking through colored blinds
careful don't miss me, going out easy
socially I'm out nine
