Cast from the heart of deceit
The struggling arm of defeat
The army of doom marches on
From out of the night traids to dawn
War baby
Oh you without face, without form
Who force us to fight in your war
It's easy to see what is not
Believing it's something we've got
War baby
you've raped and invaded, degraded us
When will you stop?
You raise us, protect and defend
Slaughter our thoughts with your pens
Train us with treacherous
While whispering we are too young
War baby
