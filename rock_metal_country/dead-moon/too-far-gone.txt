Down to Dixon, razor's edge
Cuts like water, runs so red
And now, too far gone
Asked myself ";What the hell went wrong ?";
Too many windows, looking in
They can see you but you can't see them
And now, too far gone
Asked myself ";What the hell went wrong ?";
Into the white room, tracks on the wall
Maybe it's a nightmare, really nothing at all
But now, too far gone
And I asked myself ";What the hell went wrong ?";
Ain't no reason for you to feel had
I gave it my best shot, it just went bad
And now, too far gone
And I asked myself ";What the hell went wrong ?";
