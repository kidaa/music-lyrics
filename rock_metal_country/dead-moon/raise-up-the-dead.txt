Out on the wing of another life
Reaching to raise up before you climb
Think you've got it made, I don't know why
Sooner or later, you're gonna fly
Into the night to raise up the dead
Put me on trial before I talk
I gotta get away before I walk
Running from a chainsaw in a dreaded dream
Your mouth's moving , they can't hear you scream
Into the night to raise up the dead
Can you see the rings inside their eyes? 
Did you know that justice was never blind? 
I know what the world is coming to
I've got a place in my heart for you
Into the night to raise up the dead
