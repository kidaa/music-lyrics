Is anybody really free, prisoners of 
the strange society 
Why is it we're forced to be products 
of the new reality 
Drifting through time and space 
and all the while 
Feeling out of place 
I'm out of reach 
Waiting for the time to come 
And every second always on the run 
Looking for love once more 
Then turning back and closing every door 
Thinking that what might have been 
Had that itch not gotten 'neath your skin 
Praying to an idol sign 
Believing this can keep your dream alive 
Worried 'bout the waste of youth 
Hoping that with age there will come truth 
Dying to get out in time 
Before the shadows start to cloud your mind
