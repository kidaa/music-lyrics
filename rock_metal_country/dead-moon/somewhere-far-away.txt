I don't know what happened
But somehow I got lost
They'd showed me all of the pitfalls
The lines I shouldn't cross
But I was young and so unstrung
Living day by day
If you ever feel you don't want me
I'll be out there somewhere far away
How much does it matter
Battles won or lost
When you add up all of your failures
How much does succes cost
You and me fell like Portland rain
Orphans gone astray
If you ever feel you dan't want me
I'll be out there somewhere far away
How vaguely time remembers
How slowly we forget
We all pass through this wilderness
Never know where we'll be sent
I don't know all the reasons
Why you've always held my gaze
If you ever feel you don't want me
I'll be out there somewhere far away
