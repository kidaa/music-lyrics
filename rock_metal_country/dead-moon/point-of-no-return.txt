I used to ride the world thinking I could do no wrong
I used to feel that I could fall and still get on
You've got a way about you girl I don't understand
How you can turn a crowd and still care who I am
[chorus] 
I'll walk the fire with you 'till the point of no return
I used to press my eyes into the looking glass
It always seemed to see the future from the past
Your only halfway there before you realize
You need to take a look into this strangers eyes
[chorus] 
I'll walk the fire with you 'till the point of no return
Within a race for courage the clouds were breaking down
We left nothing behind and nowhere to turn around
I had to hold you close just to make it through the night
And we closed our eyes to all the things that might
[chorus] 
I'll walk the fire with you 'till the point of no return
