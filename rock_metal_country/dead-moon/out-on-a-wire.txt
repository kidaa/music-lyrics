Get some sticks and a set of wheels
Get to where it's going on
I'll bet with strange that's just like me
I can feel like I belong
Gettin' it straight - gettin' it set
Maybe someday they won't forget
That I'm out on a wire
I tried so hard to be like
To fit into your plans
But school for me and reality
Are hard to understand
Gettin' it cut - getting it straight
Being on time without being late
I'm out on a wire
It's tough for you to think like me
In a life with your demands
Your rules and laws just crowd me in
I've got nowhere left to stand
You've pushed and held, am I so wrong
To break away and go beyond
I'm out on a wire
