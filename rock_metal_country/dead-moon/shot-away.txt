Like a falling star
Remember who you are
If life is but a dream
Somewhere in between
Time moves on so fast
We take off and we crash
Before the gates are closed
It all comes rushing past
Shot away
We'll all meet here again
We can't remember when
A glimmer in an eye
That makes you wonder why
It came and then it left
It left no evidence
It brushes up so close
Then whithers like a rose
Shot away
So babe, let's make the most
Remember all of those
No matter where they are
They'll never be that far
With crashes on the wind
Here we go again
Watch the falling star
And wonder who they are
Shot Away
