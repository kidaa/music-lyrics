Thunderbolts and nightsticks
Coming out of the sky
Flames overhead
Rain until you cry
My baby's on the highway
Come in from the cold
Never going home, never going home
D for disaster
E for my eyes
A for my anger
D before I die
M for Mona
O oh good
O oh good
N for the night
Dead Moon Night
Call me if you need me
Down in New Orleans
Can't release the victims
Have you seen what I've seen
In New York City
Don't you cross the line
Guard it from the light, guard it from the light
Hazard on the highway
Breakin' down slow
They thought she was lookin'
Now I'm all alone
I'm often abandoned
Won't you take me home
Now I'm all alone, won't you take me home
