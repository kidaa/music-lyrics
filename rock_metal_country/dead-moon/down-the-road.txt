Stranded in the storm trying to see through the rain
Looks like my life's coming 'round again
I wouldn't stop it now even if I thought I could
I was one of the remnants from a burned out scene
Trying to recover from the years between
What they didn't want then is what they think they want now
Down the road, down the road
I can still remember being here a long time ago
I'd been pickin' up the pieces from another hard fall
Waitin' by the phone for an overseas call
They wanted my past and they wanted it now
I could sense it in the air, feel it in my veins
Something was coming to take me away
I'd been lost for so long, maybe it's the price we all pay
Down the road, down the road
I can still remember being here a long time ago
I looked in the mirror trying to see
What it was they had killed in me
And why can't I no longer believe
I wandered around and I swore by God
I would never give in no matter how hard they fought
I've waited too long to have it any other way
Down the road, down the road
I can still remember being here a long time ago
