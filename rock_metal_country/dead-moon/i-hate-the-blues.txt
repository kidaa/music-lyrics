You know my life would be easy
If people would leave me alone
Stop steppin' on my fingers
That I've been working to the bone
Maybe then I could come back to you
God damn I hate the blues
I've tried to put them I a bottle
Some people put' em in their arm
Either way they're gonna kill you
Slowly eat away your heart
If only I could stop the thought of you
God damn I hate the blues
I never learned to listen
To the promises I made
I never thought you'd stay away
leaving me to take the blame
I never thought you'd follow through
God damn I hate the blues
