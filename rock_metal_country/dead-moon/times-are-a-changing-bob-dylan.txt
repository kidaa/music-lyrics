Come gather 'round people wherever you roam
And admit that the waters around you have grown
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth savin'
Ahh you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone
For the times they are a-changin'
Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen
Keep your eyes wide the chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
There's no tellin' who that it's namin'
The loser now will be later to win
For the times they are a-changin'
Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
Don't criticize what you can't understand
Your sons and daughters are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly agin'
So get out of the new one it can't lend your hand
For the times they are a-changin'
