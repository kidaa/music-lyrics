I tried to stop the tide
I tried but I can't hide
I tried to resist you
I tried to follow through
I tried to let you go
I tried but I just want more
I tried and tried to steal away
But you played on me
I tried to pass the time
I tried to get you off my mind
I tried to become cold
I tried to tell you no
I tried and tried to steal away
But you placed on me
I tried to look away
I tried not to see your face
I tried to forget you
I tried but it's just no use
I tried and tried to steal away
But you played on me
