Your situation's on the top of my head
I don't know what to do
I know it's painful but it's got to be said
These things you're going through
Oh, you can't do that
You always had a way of keeping things in It's just the way you are
It's only lately I don't know where you've been
I'm afraid you'll go to far
Oh, you can't do that
I miss the way we were before we got lost
It will never come again
I'm only trying to get the wires uncrossed
Before it all ends
