Day after day we threw our cares away
Waiting for tomorrow, never living for today
We lined up in the trenches, holding higher ground
We looked away for answers but nothing could be found
chorus
And I swear, we won't keep standing still
Here to take your heat
The rain's about to fall
We're taking to the streets
Day after day nothing ever changed
Was it any wonder we all began to stray
Some of us for money, some of us for fame
Our goals were so impossible no one could take aim
Day after day the hours wore away
Regretting what we'd missed, closer to the grave
We're the broken generation, we don't know who we are
Fought for every losing cause and now we hide the scars
