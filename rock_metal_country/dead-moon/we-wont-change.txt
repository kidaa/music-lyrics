Deep in my heart, right from the start
We had the look, we never took
people want to know how come we stay the same
But we won't change - not like that
We never knew what we would go through
Time could stand still but we never will
people want to know how come we stay the same
But we won't change - not like that
Straight from the soul, how could they know
We'll never do what they want us to
people want to know how come we stay the same
But we won't change - not like that
