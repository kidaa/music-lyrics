Crashing throug the twilight spell
Miracles are not for sale
Maybe I'm ahead of the fall
Drifting out of paradise
Taking exit 95
It's to close to call
I'm not afraid
Crossed the unidentified
Discovered that I'm terrified
Baby, there's no way out
Hope is such a sorry state
Just another face in the crowd
I'm not afraid
Disgusted by the point of view
That everyone must be like you
Running while the rest of us crawl
Buy your way or play your game
I've seen your act it's really lame
I'm a social default
I'm not afraid
