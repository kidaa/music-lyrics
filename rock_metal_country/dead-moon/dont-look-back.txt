You were willing, you were much too wise
You were willing, now it's gone inside
Don't look back
You were simple in your little games
You're so simple now it's all the same
Don't look back
Don't look back on those times you had
Don't look back you might feel so bad
In a minute or an hour or two
In a minute we'll just see 'bout you
Don't look back
You were easy in your little ways
You're so easy now you lost the game
Don't look back
