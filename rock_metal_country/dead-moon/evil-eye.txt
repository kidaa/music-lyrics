I am so bad because of you
There ain't nothing that I won't do
I'll buy you clothes and ruby rings
But it takes money to get those things
So I lie and I cheat
I rob and I steal
I try to hate you woman, but I never will
Love won't die, no matter how hard I try
My woman's got an evil eye
I am so weak, I must admit
Got love bad but I can't quit
Bought you a Cadillac with all the frills
I bought you that, you want more still
Work all day, work all night
Oh, little baby, you trest me right
Bought you a house high on the hill
I bought you that, you want more still
