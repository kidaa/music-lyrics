In my way, I've had my day
I've touched it all and watched it as it fell away
Pressed my face to glass before I broke
I'm on my own
And as I lay in a twlight spell
I could sense something was coming as the comets fell
Out there something's moving in the lights
I'm on my own
A metal gray that glides away
The silver beads of heat that weld the night to day
That weightless, sinking feeling without time
I'm on my own
