Shadows fell into our eyes
Strangers we would seldom call
You and I like every teen
Were up against the wall
We couldn't see the end in time
Dying to get out
13 going on 21
They will never stop us now
Going our way
13 Years in a wirebound
Just let the fire burn
They don't think we can make it here
They gotto another thing to learn
Desperately I tried my best
To hold myself in tact
13 going on 21
We're never ever gonna look back
Going our way
Teenage eyes were open wide
Don't you think we know by now
How foul and plagued our future cries
From what you've handed down
We can't explain the distant crash
Alter or defuse
13 going on 21
We're learning by watching you
Going our way
