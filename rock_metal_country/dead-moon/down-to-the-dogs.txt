My brain's been hammered and my nerves are shot
I caught the fever and the shakes won't stop 
Even the doctors don't know what I got
I'm going-----
Woke up in the morning, head twisted tight 
Been out with the nightcrawlers, trying to find my life 
Damned if I do- damned if I don't 
One thing for certain little girl, I'm running out of rope
Down to the dogs
Down to the dogs
Woke up in the morning little girl going 
Down to the dogs
Got wrecked on Monday, jacked-up for a week 
By the time I came up from down under, I could hardly speak 
I lost my job, my life's a mess 
I feel like Rocky's bloody hammer's coming down on my chest 
[chorus repeat]
