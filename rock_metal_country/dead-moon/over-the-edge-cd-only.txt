Innocence, yeah, we got no choices
We are the victims of a thousand voices
Say we're bad 'cause we do what we do
They don't know the way I feel about you
And every day there's a dark stranger
Who tries to lead us into danger
I don't know what I'm gonna do
They don't know what I'm going through
Over the edge
I look at you and your eyes are on fire
We both know we're going down to the wire
Touch me baby and I feel like thunder
We are the modern world from down under
I looked at you for the very first time
You're like a river running through my mind
They say we're young, we don't know what we do
But I can't make it if I can't have you
