Castaways, gypsies of the dawn
Angels out of darkness with
nowhere to belong
Bound together, we've been cast
into the storm
Castaways, children of the damned
Abandoned by the future and the
past can't understand
You've never had a change since
your journey began
Castaways, misfits out of time
Tomorrow it won't matter and
yesterday's behind
You won't live forever, you've got
tombstones in your eyes
