Looking at my face in a photograph
I was only 17
Been a long time since we looked like that
But you're the same boy standing by me
So I'll close my eyes in thoughts of you
Thinking it might be through
But I've got my pride though I'm alone tonight
Do you remember when we said I do
I won't be the one who walks away
I won't be the one who fades
I won't be the one who walks away
I won't be the one who pains
Standing in the rain as they lowered the flag
Wondering where the spirit was bound
Thinking I could never feel that lost again
But that was then and this is now
I just wanted you to know I can't let go
I'll be here if you still want me
I'll be waiting in the shadows of the unlit side
Where the lost souls are being set free
