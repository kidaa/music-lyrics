How many times have I said it before
You can't keep coming back once you walk out that door
I don't know why I take it time and again
You're like a building on fire
Rockets in the sky
The heat of the city that's burning in my eyes
I never should have fell for you
Let you do me like you do
And I can't, I can't get a fix on you
How can you tell me in the dark of despair
That I'm the only one who ever really cared
How many times have you said it to the others
Things being said, talk going down
There's been rumors in the alley and they're gettin' uptown
I never shoulda listened to you
Every lie you tell's like the truth
And I can't, I can't get a fix on you
Every time I get the courage to kiss it all goodbye
I start thinkin' 'bout the moments you keep creepin' in my life
Every time I tell you this will be the last time
The building catches fire
The rockets in the sky
The heat of the city starts burning in my eyes
I never shoulda fell for you
Let you do me like you do
And I can't, I can't get a fix on you
