I met her on the avenue
She wanted me, I just wanted you
She whispered low, her skin was soft
She pulled the cord and slowly took it off
Say it isn't so
She told me things i nedded to hear
Dream your dreams before you disappear
She closed her eyes, turned away
I love you babe, there's nothing more to say
Say it isn't so
They say that time can heal the wounds
Don't they know that someone's got to lose
As she left, a silent stare
As if to say does anybody care
Say it isn't so
