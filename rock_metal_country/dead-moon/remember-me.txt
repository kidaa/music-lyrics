I clutched at the broken strings 
As you let go of me
And in my darkest hour
I never thought you'd set me free
And now that you've gone beyond
You think I don't belong
It's not easy to pretend
Remember me
I was in the crowded season
When the leaves began to fall
I was in the mainline then
You were up against the wall
I couldn't see the end was near
You told me what I wanted to hear
It was easy to pretend
Remember me
And as I walked away
The changes that I saw
At once I was sure you'd made it
Just to see me crawl
And I remember you
Sooner or later I swear
I'll be taken on that long hard ride
Down to those sunset towers
Where you can hear lost angels cry
Falling like fire and rain
Back to my seeds again
It's so easy to pretend
Remember me
I remember you
