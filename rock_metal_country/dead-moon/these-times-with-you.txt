I had to trace the clouds with the dark side looking in 
I couldn't play the lie, it's just the way it's been 
I never wanted to clear the pages in my life 
I just came across to try it one more time 
I wanna live these times with you 
I couldn't find the road, the signs had been wiped out 
I couldn't hear you after silence stunned the crowd 
I was ready for change before it slipped away 
I wanna steal the heart that holds the break of day 
I wanna live these times with you 
With some false delay before we take the fall 
We seem to capture the pain before we face the wall 
I never understood the things that cause our plight 
I guess shadows falling down won't make things right 
I wanna live these times with you
