The red sky's moaning and the wind is blowing hard
Better take warning 'cause this time it's gone too far
We been smokin' it more but enjoyin'it less
We better stop using or there'll be nothing left
The eyes of defiance are slowly being crushed to death
There's a fire in the western world
House in shambles, trip wire under the door
18, wasted, trying to hide the crack in the floor
Don't know what you're doing, don't really care
School's just a miss-hit going nowhere
You're running for your life while the scandal's
are burning the stairs
There's a fire in the western world
Can't you hear the rooster crowing in the dead of the night
Don'tcha wanna trash'em, jackboots step out of line
It's a concrete jungle, stones and tears
Quickly becoming what everybody fears
It ain't just color the message keeps cuttin' clear
There's a fire in the western world
