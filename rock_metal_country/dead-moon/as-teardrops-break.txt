Why everybody else is still counting out the days, I don't know
Me, I'm still racing with the hours and I know I can't go
It's never been easy 'cause I've always been late
After all these I'm still the same
Maybe it's the way I was brought into the world, a cold night
It's always been harder for me to be wrong than be right
Maybe unfounded but important to me
That after all these years I have the same old dream 
Fell into the weary-gone arms of the man I still hold
Seems we only just got started and we've got a long ways to go
It's never been easy but it's the best it could be
For after all these years I'm still me
