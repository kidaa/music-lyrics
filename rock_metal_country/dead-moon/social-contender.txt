Logically appraise the situation
Sizing-up the ones who'll do you good
Realize it's not merely position
That gets you to the top that's understood
chorus
You can't live with yourself
So live off someone else
You say your one of us
But you're really one of them
So don't pretend - social contender
This rule by ladders hazardous ascent
Your path is strewn with others who have bent
Ambition hides from view those who are falling
Convince yourself you'll not be like those crawling
Laughing in the face of their distress
Believing they're impressed with your success
You'll find out the street you travel narrows
Poisoned by the edge of social arrows
Social contender, social pretender, social defender
