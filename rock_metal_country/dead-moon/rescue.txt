Words: Toody 
I wanna rescue you
Fill all the empty spaces that you're falling through
Hold you up when your skies turn gray
Stand by you no matter what they say
You've done the same for me, I'll do the same for you
[chorus]  
I'm takin' a chance and I don't know why
Can't do it alone 
I wanna know your dreams
The roads that you've traveled and what you've seen
All the good and all the bad
What makes you smile, what makes you sad
Just let me in I'll open up to you
[chorus] 
I'm takin' a chance and I don't know why
Can't do it alone
I wanna rescue you
Make up for everything that's ever hurt you
Be a family and a world in two
Find your course I will follow you
Thank God the search for me was the search for you
[chorus] 
I'm takin' a chance and I don't know why
Can't do it alone
