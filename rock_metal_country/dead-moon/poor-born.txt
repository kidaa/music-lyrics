I was poor born out in tin town
I'd sing along with Jerry Lee records
Trying to get my moves down
I was skinny, I was big-nosed
The only thing I had on my mind
Was trying to do the ";please don't";
I'm pissed off, pissed off, pissed off
It's just the way I am
I was wasted, I was dumb-struck
I'd wake up in the bottom of something
Being loaded in a dump truck
I was so gone, I was dead-eyed
I've been screaming at the top of my lungs
Since 1965
I'm pissed off, pissed off, pissed off
It's just the way I am
I've been rocked out, I can't cool down
I've got a woman who still makes me crazy
With the shake of her nightgown
I'm still nervous, I ain't been broken
I'm still churning and burning inside
And I can't stop smokin'
I'm pissed off, pissed off, pissed off
It's just the way I am
