Maybe we were meant to be like a heartbeat turning black 
Wasted like the colors mixed while thieves steal out the black 
It's like a broken smile, a step apart that gives you style 
It doesn't need explaining you know it's fall when it starts raining 
It's just the way it is 
Touching through an open flame and sparks begin to fly 
Looking for another way but you can't help passing by 
It's not your enemy, it's the sense somehow you won't be free 
It's only rank and file, trampled love, and walking wild 
It's just the way it is 
Within the crystal pains that we shattered long ago 
Alone with what remains it's hard to let you know 
In a no-win fight, I guess two wrongs don't make a right 
We're in the dash between the way we are and what we've been 
It's just the way it is
