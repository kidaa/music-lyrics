We ain't got the feeling and dreams not at all
For those who come lately are in for a fall
We're told of our outcome in silent rage and anger
We're bent out of focus facing the chasing danger
Miles away, miles away, we're miles away
But the clouds of dawn will soon be gone
Hold it too close you'll squeeze it to death
For those who push hardest soon run out of breath
I know there's a reason for moments of sadness weeping
It's the pain of a lifetime, it's all we have worth keeping
Lose your illusions and you'll lose your chance
For those who control love have no romance
But I still don't know you for all the time we're taking
You're still in my eyes babe, the future's ours for waiting
