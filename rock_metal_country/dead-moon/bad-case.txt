When your friends all kill you- put your cannon on the line. 
Doing the last chaser-your already ripe. 
Fear not the link from the chain. 
It's O.K. - it's all in the game. 
[chorus] 
Gotta bad case of love 
Bad case of love
Bad case of love 
cut off relations 'cause you can't get enough. 
When you turn on Gods speed, children of the night. 
You know I'll be watching 'cause I'm already tight. 
Too many to charm, so many dreams. 
Going home alone- I don't know what you mean. 
[chorus] 
Gotta bad case of love 
Bad case of love
Bad case of love 
down to the canyon 'cause you can't get enough. 
You can face off like a child, God don't understand. 
The moon falls - she loves another man. 
She's got all the weapons, you know you're gonna lose. 
Don't let it tear, you better start singing your blues. 
[chorus]
Gotta bad case of love 
Bad case of love
Bad case of love  
don't rush the colors 'cause you can't get enough
