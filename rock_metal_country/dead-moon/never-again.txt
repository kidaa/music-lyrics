I tried to tell you that there's always 
two sides to the blade 
I saw my future cave in from the roots of decay 
The dark cloud started dancing all over the sun 
Whatever it took to make my blood run 
I had a ways to go 
Sorrow that you'll never know 
But lately it's beginning to show 
And I tell myself never again 
The armies of doubt were playing war in my head 
I couldn't recover from the things that they said 
Crash landed in the safehouse under the stairs 
Last place on earth where anyone cares 
Never dreamed I'd fall to this 
Something that I couldn't resist 
And now I just clench my fists 
And I tell myself never again 
Run silent, run deep, run as fast as you can 
Let the rest of the world slide through your hands 
Old habits die hard like a fatal disease 
They cut you so deep, you can never come clean 
I've got a past to pay 
I got demons to face 
I can't just run away 
But I tell myself never again
