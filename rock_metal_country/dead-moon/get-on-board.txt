Suicidal cement screams
I seen 'em all inside my dreams
I see them coming through my head
Make me wish I was dead
Ghosts chase silent foes
I never knew I'd get aboard
Cover me in ice
Til the edge og time
Can you see the stream, drowning in
the deep
Something so bad
Can you see the ship, sacrifice
myself
Grab you instead
Get onboard
Painted child seldom seen
I've gone another way to be
Put the mark upon my head
Make me wish I'm dead
The servants never called
The dog's been put in chains
They can't hear you anymore
They've all gone straight
No matter what they say
I guess it's really sad
To never get across
I looked into the eyes
The same as before
But I just got lost
Get on board
