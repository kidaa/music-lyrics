Into dark waters flow - bad dreams of long ago
Children who never knew - what doors would open to
Flights taking weary souls - life shakes of bitter cold
Love tears on golden shores - teenaged, no more
chorus
What made you take the trip
How could you go so quick
Out through the open door
I wish I'd loved you more
D. O. A.
Pure as the driven snow - innocence now quickly goes
Hard pressed between the folds - inside the overcoat
Warm hearts and homeless bound - beware the city sound
Lying there below the street - broken, hard and beat
In cries of angels fall - in time you hear them all
Each face a deeper down - each heard a highway sound
Bound for the twilight flash - in tears the blinding match
A moments flame now cold - I knew her long ago
