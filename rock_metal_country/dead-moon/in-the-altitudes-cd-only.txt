I've been noticing some changes
It's not so hard
Took a long time to get here
We came from so far
And if I had it all to do again
I wouldn't change a thing
And I still want you
Love in the altitudes, no one but me and you
At the age of temptation
You were so young then
I was looking for relation
You were looking for a friend
And your hair was long just like now
In the room we fell into
And I still want you
Love in the altitudes, no one but me and you
I've seen the pages, the haunting lie
Someone discouraging me
They said you'll lose interest
And you'll get tired of me
But I ain't worried, you know it girl
It's been so long it seems
And I still want you
Love in the altitudes, no one but me and you
