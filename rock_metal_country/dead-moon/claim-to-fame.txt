Don't you worry 'bout hurting me
I've been hurt before
Don't you worry 'bout using me
I always knew the score
Don't get excited
When I come and go
My claim to fame baby was a long, long time ago
Did you get what you wanted
Are you through with me
I can feel your nails cutting
I bleed so easily
The angels of mercy
Never rescued my soul
My claim to fame baby was a long. Long time ago
I can't stop the burning in my soul
So don't get excited
'Cause it's only me
The same guy you've been laughing at
Continuously
But I ain't no threat now
We all come and go
My claim to fame baby was a long, long time ago
I can't stop the burning in my soul
