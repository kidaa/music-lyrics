There's a street that only ends alone
A place you go to find your soul
Where the paralyzing screem
And the echoes dark between
Wait in the shadows, 
Your entering the streets of despair
It's a dead end - the final report
A break-down, the last resort
It's the faces of a few
That everybody knew
Waiting in the shadows -
Your entering the streets of despair
It's a street that only goes one way
Down the narrows where the neons say
Life is only but a dream
And you're playing out a scene
Waiting in the shadows -
Your entering the streets of despair
