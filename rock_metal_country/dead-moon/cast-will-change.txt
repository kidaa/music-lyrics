Wish I'd been born on a Georgia farm
Wish I'd never seen the city's harm
Wish I'd been sown like an innocent seed
Stranded in the country 'stead of on the street
Sooner or later the cast will change
Watched my face as it turned to stone
Thinkin' things be better if I went back home
My friends ain't different, it's me that's changed
To wait so long and feel so strange
Sooner or later the cast will change
Some may come and some may go
Nothing lasts forever don't you know
I've been waitin' such a long, long, long time
Had a lotta people try to break my stride
Sooner or later the cast will change
