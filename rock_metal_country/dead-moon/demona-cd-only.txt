I thought I could avoid you but I was wrong
What seemed to be so innocent has long since gone
You took me to dependency, I tried to get clean
I'm not the only one who sais it can't happen to me
You've got your colors over my eyes
I've tried to walk the narrows but it's no use
I find myself surrendering in dreams with you
Into the elevations where everything's clear
Demona comes in shallow light and disappears
She wraps her colors over my eyes,br> 
I've stood in open windows and watched the sky
I've waited to be rescued and then I've cried
your eyes are so beguiling you whisper to me
And in that silent chamber you came over me
You wrap your colors over my eyes
