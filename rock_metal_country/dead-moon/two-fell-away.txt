I have been through this before
It can't hurt me anymore
Where does it start to end
Why do we then pretend
Someone who still believes
But that ain't me
I'm still shipwrecked and confused
Why does someone have to lose
Awaiting that nowhere flight
Watching as you go by
Someone's about to leave
But that ain't me
And on the pilot's screen
You rid your life of everything
You're on your way
And as the trapdoor closed
I said my prayers before you rose and fell away
Fell away, fell away, o no no no
Time forgets, I never will
And I can't help the way I feel
Strange how we seem to know
Which way our lives will go
Someone's about to leave
But that ain't me
