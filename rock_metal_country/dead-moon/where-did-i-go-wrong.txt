My eyes on the fire
It's burning me down
I tried to walk away but
that's all over now
I promised you'd be
The better part of me
But when I cut the ties
I thought I'd be free
And when I tried to tell you
That I would soon be gone
So tell me babe
Where did I go wrong?
I followed that dream
The one fools only seek
I thought the world of you
But, I thought more of me
