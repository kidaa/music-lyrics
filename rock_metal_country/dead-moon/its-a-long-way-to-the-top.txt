Young/Young/Scott - arr. Dead Moon 
Riding down the highway 
Goin' to a show
Stoppin' on the by-ways 
Playing rock & roll
Gettin' robbed, gettin' stoned
Gettin' beaten, broken bones 
Gettin' had, gettin' took 
I'll tell you folks, it's harder than it looks
[chorus]  
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock & roll
If you think it's easy playing one night stands 
Try playing in a rock & roll band  
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock & roll
Hotel, motel makes you wanna cry 
Ladies do the hard sell, know the reason why 
Gettin' old, gettin' gray 
Gettin' ripped off, underpaid 
Gettin' sold, secondhand 
That's how it goes playing in a band
[chorus]  
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock & roll
If you wanna be a star of stage and screen
Look out, it's tough and mean
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock & roll
[chorus]
