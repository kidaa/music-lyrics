It's a new game, causing pain
You know I've got you on my brain
It's the kind of hell you'll never know
Girls like you just turn me cold
But I guess you found my weaker side
Resistance, God how I tried
But I've got it bad I must confess
To tell the truth I've done my best
But you treat me like poison
Even with the lights on
Guess I might as well be dead
Oh, I'm in the graveyard
Tried whiskey to ease your hex
It made it worse, my life's a wreck
The pills I took to numb my pain
Only brought visions of you again
I'd put the noose around my neck
But the way I feel, I'd probably break
Love must be an evil curse
I've tried to fight, It just gets worse
Your love is like an endless hell
What you do to me you know too well
You won't give me the time
I'm on the firing line
Convicted and disposed
You look but eyes are closed
