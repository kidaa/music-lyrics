Downtown to the courthouse 
For some pass-the-buck justice 
It's a knock-down, drag 'em out, beat 'em up, mace the crowd 
Strip search, busted 
Can't control the fire 
Coming through barbed wire 
It's a junkyard, live hard, bear the scars of broke and charred 
Sellers and buyers 
So when all is said and done 
Watch out, 'cause here they come 
Shadows of the night 
It's the last of the old ways 
It's the wave of the new age 
Computerized, digitized, money markets, mechanized 
Internet highway 
Infected by the needy 
Neglected by the greedy 
Chaos, blood loss, nickel bagging debutants 
Looking for a freebie 
We got radio silence 
Another act of violence 
Backstage, spray paint, security in rollerskates 
Beating on a new dance 
Going down on a choker 
Stun gun smoker 
Open range, who's game, shoot until the scream of pain 
Never getting older
