Like the river running through my hands, time slipping through the sands
Never thought I'd love you more than everyone who came before
[chorus] 
So when the world starts to cut me in two
I close my eyes for you.
I only want to be your man
Waiting for the rain to clear, wonder if you know I'm here
Your fire's running through my veins, trying to keep my head on straight
[chorus]
So when the world starts to cut me in two
I close my eyes for you
I only want to be your man
Watching for the storm to come, you and I were on the run
Seems like I always knew, forever it would be with you
[chorus]
So when the world starts to cut me in two
I close my eyes for you
I only want to be your man
