You are a spectacle
You upon your pedestal
Electricity flows trough your veins
You forget why it was from where you came
The midnight sermon, the morning rain
You're touching down on earth again
Crashdown, crashdown
Into the light
You are the destiny
You are eternity
Children, how can you know
You've come so long ago
This lightway corridor
Flash lightening thunderstorm
Into the light
