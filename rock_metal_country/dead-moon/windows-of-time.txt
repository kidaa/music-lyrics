The windows of time are frozen
Where are the teardrops going
Another heartbeat is slowing
Plain as day, something is broken
And the wheels inside my head are turning
Like the lines I keep relearning
I can't stay, no I can't stay
This time I have to go
I thought that we would last forever
Superstitions never say never
And I feel I've been abandoned
With a lack of understanding
I might regret the steps I'm taking
I can't stay, no I can't stay
This time I have to go
Out of the cape of disappointment
Where I'm bound, I don't know yet
The winds that change direction
The harbors of rejection
And the blade inside of me is twisting
I've spent my live resisting
I can't stay, no I can't stay
This time I have to go
