You used to carry the flag
You were the soldier
You used to head the point
You were the older
You used to fight for peace
War was no stranger
You used to walk the line
Right into danger
The wind cries
Dead in the saddle
You used to hold me up
When you were younger
You had the coldest eyes
They put me under
You weren't they only one
Who felt like crying
You weren't the only one
Who felt like dying
The wind dries
Dead in the saddle
You used to stare the night
For distant thunder
You used to have a look
That made me wonder
You held the hand of death
When you rode into battle
As you rode like the wind
You could hear deaths rattle
The wind cries
Dead In the saddle
