There's a red light on the hill
And a bridge out going down
There's a city limits marker
Of an unfamiliar town
With my head slightly bent
I can see it in the light
Unknown passage
Cuttin' like a knife through the night
Headlights on the highway
There's a mist coming down
I can hear someone crying
I know that sound
It's the morning before daybreak
A hundred miles down the line
Unknown passage
Cuttin' like a knife through the night
Asked ";Where are you going ?";
Somewhere far away
She was standing at the window
I won't forget her face
With my suitcase and my old car
I'm driving somewhere blind
Unknown passage
Cuttin' like a knife through the night
Cuttin' like a knife through my eyes
