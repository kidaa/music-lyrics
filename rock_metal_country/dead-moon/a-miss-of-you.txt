I used to be so, so down
I thought I had been changed
So when I found you were running around
I too tried to play that game
I know the way now
This time it won't take long
We used to run around two by two
We tried to break our hearts
And in the mornin' when the corners are jaded
I too began to fall apart
So if I seem unable to cope
It's for a miss of you
If what we were was only for once
You were always worth the view
