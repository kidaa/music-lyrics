Lovesick, I can't kick it 
I came in on a one-way ticket 
I can't zip it, my brain's dead 
Going 90 with a bridge out ahead 
Watch out girl, you're gonna love me to death 
I can't eat, I can't sleep 
I been under the weather all week 
A vaccination won't make it stop 
There ain't no remedy for what I've caught 
She's got a doll, she sticks the pins 
I look like something that the cat dragged in 
I got the symptoms, don't know the name 
Been to hell and back and nothing's changed
