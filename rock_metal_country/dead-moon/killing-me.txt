Sinister love came knocking on my bedroom door
I had this kind of thing happen once before
Spent most of my life in recovery
So tell me, tell me babe
Why are you killing me
Seen a lot of bad trips coming and I've been on a few
Got a nightmare premonition that you're real bad news
Behind your looks there's another side nobody sees
So tell me, tell me babe
Why are you killing me
I shoulda been smart and got out while the gettin' was good
I woulda been better off if only I could
But you made me love the side of you nobody sees
So tell me, tell me babe
Why are you killing me
