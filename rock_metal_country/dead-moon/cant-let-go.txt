Ain't it strange how we risk it all
For one last shot befor the curtain falls
Cause you know I can't let go
It's a crazy feeling that we can't control
This sound of freedom called rock and roll
And you know you can't let go
It can wreck your spirit, ruin your live
But you pay the price to reach that high
Cause you know you can't let go
For every bad moment when you've had enough
You tell yourself just one more touch
Cause you know you can't let go
As you stand on the stage and bare your soul
Your nerves are shot and the crowd's turned cold
But you know you can't let go
For in that moment, the blink of an eye
It can make you smile or make you cry
Cause you know you can't let go
In wreckless world of one night stands
Uncertain futures and broken plans
But you know you can't let go
It's the rock rebellion, the teenage heart
You're gonna be replaced, it will tear you apart
But you know you can't let go
