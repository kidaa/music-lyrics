To the way things might have been
To roads that never end
Why do we all pretend? 
Through a pane of colored glass
I watch as chances pass
Knowing they won't last
[chorus] 
So why's the road become so narrow? 
Maybe I'm a broken arrow
Falling slightly down to nowhere
Take me now if only somewhere
In a sky of scattered blues
I watch them break in two
The way I used to do
From a sea of wasted rhyme
I ask myself sometimes
Are any thoughts really mine? 
[chorus] 
To nowhere down
