It's the 
It's the common cause
It's the bloody cross
It's a sabotage
It's a bomb threat
It's a code red
It's a thousand dead
It's a twisted thought
It's a fever caught
It's the kill and rot
It's the terror reign
It's the devil's game 
It's the wrath of Cain
It's the taking of time, taking of time, 
taking of time, time, time
Murder in the sky
It's the sleeping lie
It's a suicide
It's a trash and burn
