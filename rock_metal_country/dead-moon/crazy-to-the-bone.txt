Baby, baby, baby, come home on the midnight train
I been so long from you I can't remember when
I need you, little girl, 'cause I'm leanng on the wicked ledge
No matter how I try to get you outa my head
Time's running in on me
I don't care about security
Please won't you come on home
'Cause I'm crazy, crazy, crazy for you down to the bone
Baby, baby, baby, through the eye of a hurricane
That's how far I'd go to see you again
The mystery telephone caller's dead on the line
Tried to get a message to you but it's been all night
Baby, baby, baby, come home on the midnight train
I'll be waiting on the platform to get you in my arms again
I never through you mattered, mattered as much as you do
I never thought being alone was being without you
