On another plane- I'm out of here babe
I'm sick and tired of making the grade
If I threw you a lie could we still be that close? 
Another bridge to cross, it's just the way life goes
On a distant cry, I'm holding my own
It's only time but it's begining to show
I'm never the same, how does anyone know? 
I only have so much, it's just the way life goes
