You're not the man who gave me everything
I've ever wanted 
You're not the man
Who stepped inside my life
And haunted every, every day 

You're not the man
Who said he'd never leave
Couldn't breathe
And could not sleep without me 

This was someone who you left behind
A long time ago 

You're not the man
Who would bleed for me
But never shed a tear
You're not the one
Said he'd always be near 

You're not the man
Who threw me a lifeline
And you're not the man
I am so proud to call mine 

And you're not the one
Who said he'd never leave
The one who made me believe in me
That was someone who could do no wrong
But you lost him 

You're not the man
Who would bleed for me
But never shed a tear
You're not the one
Who said he'd always, always, always be here
said he'd always always be near 

But don't get me wrong
Although it seems sad
It's not all bad
You see
I'm not the little girl I use to be 

You're not the man
Not the one
Who said he'd always, always, always be near 

He was everything you see
He made me believe in me
Said he'd alway always always be here
