Got to find out what I meant to you
You're the one who broke my heart
Got to find out what I meant to you
You're the one who broke my heart 
When I met you boy
You were as sweet as cherry pie
That smile in your eye
You were as wild as friday night 

I should have known
However hard you tried
Change would come and strangle it
It was bound to die 

You were sweet as cherry pie
Wild as friday night
Sweet as cherry pie
Wild as Friday night 

Gotta find out what I meant to you
Your the one who broke my heart in two
Gotta find out what I meant to you
Oh Boy 

Gotta find out what I meant to you
Your the one who broke my heart in two
Where were you just when I needed you

You gave me your soul
For at least a day
Listen boy there was a time
When I wanted you to stay 

You knew the cost
It's you who's gonna pay
I'm stronger now I loved you then
I ask you anyway 

You were sweet as cherry pie
Wild as friday night
Sweet as cherry pie
Wild as friday night 

Gotta find out what I meant to you
Your the one who broke my heart in two
Where were you just when I needed you
Boy 

Gotta find out what I meant to you
Your the one who broke my heart in two
Ooh I needed you 

Baa do do do do, do do, baa do do do
Baa do do do do, baa do do do 

Baa do do do do, do do, baa do do do
Baa do do do do, baa do do do 

You were the only one you were the only one
You're a son of a gun
You were the only one you were the only one
Oh Boy, you broke my heart 

Sweet as cherry pie
Sweet as cherry pie 

Gotta find out what I meant to you
Your the one who broke my heart in two
Gotta find out what I meant to you
Oh Boy 

Gotta find out what I meant to you
Where were you just when I needed you
Gotta find out what I meant to you
Boy 

Doo doop doo doop
Doo doop doo doop
Doo doop doo doop
doo doo doop doop doop
doo doo doop doop doop
Where were you when I needed you 

You were the only one you were the only one

You were the only one
I'm feeling stronger now I loved you then
So I ask you anyway 

Gotta find out what I meant to you
sweet as cherry pie You broke my heart
sweet as cherry pie
Gotta find out what I meant to you
You tease me 

You were the only one you were the only one
as cherry pie
Son of a gun
You were the only one you were the only one
