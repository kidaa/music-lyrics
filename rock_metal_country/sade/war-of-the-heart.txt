I could aim
But I could not fire
Got a bullet to spare
To kill my desire 
Who's calling the shots
One of us must make the Peace
To have or to have not
The fire has got to cease 

I'm loaded
Don't know where to point this thing
It's a sin
How we hit where it hurts 

Who's calling the shots
One of us must end this masquerade
To have or to have not
Let's heal the wounds that we've made 

It'a a war of the heart it's a war of the heart
It's a war of the heart 

Got a bullet to space, don't wanna send it your way 

Who's calling the shots
One of us, must make the peace
To have or to have not
The fire has got to cease 

It'a a war of the heart it's a war of the heart
It's a war of the heart 

I'm loaded
Don't know where to point this thing
it's a sin It's a sin
How we hit where it hurts where it hurts 

One of us
Gotta end this masquerade
Got to heal the wounds that we've made
I've got a bullet to spare
Don't want to send it your way
If you want to end it
If you want to end it just say 

It'a a war of the heart it's a war of the heart
It's a war of the heart 

Got to end this masqurade 

I've got a bullet to spare
Don't want to send it your way
If you want to end it
If you want to end it just say 

It'a a war of the heart
It's a war of the heart
It'a a war of the heart
