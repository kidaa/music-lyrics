Frankie, didn't I tell you
You've got the world
In the palm of your hand
Frankie, didn't I tell you they're running
At your command 
You know the tricks
As if they're your invention
It wasn't your intemntion
Frankie to fall in the trap you made 

Oohh it's a crying shame, Mmm
You left a trail of destruction
Heart breaker you know now
They really did care cause it's your first affar 

Frankie, didn't I tell you that the lion
Would come in for the kill
Frankie, didn't I say he had power
Over your sweet skill 

So where is the laughter
You spat right in their faces
Didn't I tell you frankie
That you might run out of races 

Oohh it's a crying shame, Mmm
You couldn't win the game
Heart breaker this time this time
It's your first affar 

Frankie, frankies first affair it's your turn to cry
Frankie, frankies first affair

Cause it's your first affair
