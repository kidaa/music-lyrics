I know that lately
Things haven't been so good
I always said
If I could ever help you I would 
Ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh, I love you
For a thousand years
Ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh, I'm here
To wipe away the tears 

I will be your friend till the end of time
I will be your friend I'm here to make you smile 

When your fallin apart
I pick up each piece
Build a wall around your dreams 

The punches to your heart
Melt away when you never thought they'd heal
So trust in me
These are the words I tattoo on you
If hercules can pick you up
I will I really am true 

I will be your friend untill the end of time
I will be your friend I'm here to make you smile 

Ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh, I love you
For a thousand years
Ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh, I'm here
To wipe away the tears 

You've got so much to give
I'll tell you just when you need to know
Get out and live
Pick you up when you're feeling low 

So here's my hand
Trust in me I really am true
You've got to understand
There's nothing
I wouldn't do 

I will be your friend untill the end of time
I will be your friend I'm here to make you smile 

I will be your friend untill the end of time
I will be your friend I'm here to make you smile 

You've got so much to give
Ooh Ooh ooh Ooh
Get out and live
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh 

I will be your friend untill the end of time
I will be your friend I'm here to make you smile 

The Punches to your heart
When your falling apart..
