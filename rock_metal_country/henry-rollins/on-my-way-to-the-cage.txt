On my way to the cage
I'm getting taught a lesson
On my way to the cage
I'm choking on the medicine
On my way to the cage
I'm stepping hard on four leaf clovers
On my way to the cage
I'm learning the same thing over and over

On the way to the cage
I heard the crowd roar
Thoughts of you were long behind me
I couldn't ask for more
The lights are almost blinding
Come closer, see yourself in my eyes
Fear me

On my way to the cage
The taste of blood is in my mouth
On my way to the cage
The fear is in their eyes
On my way to the cage
My animal blood is pure
On my way to the cage
No regrets and no last words

Chorus

I've got your world inside my fist
I've got your mind on a string
I've got your soul on a leash
You put yourself above me
But there's something that you've missed
You always say you hate me

But you watch me anyway
It's a pain you can't resist

On my way to the cage
I'm larger than life, laughing at death
On my way to the cage
I'm tripping on pain and feeling fine
On my way to the cage
You're paying your price and I'm paying mine
On my way to the cage
I'm watching you cry and wave goodbye
