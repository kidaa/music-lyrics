I want to touch your neon chemical
I want to make you need like an animal
The way you rip my head up
You're my main incinerator
Kick the door down when you come
Tear the roof off when you leave

The scene should be flashing
As you re-appear
Slip into something dangerous
As something I can fear
Lie and say you want me
Lie and say you will
Tell me all the stories
How you love and how you kill

Love me as you kill me
I want to see destruction
I want to feel extinction

Will you smile when the sheets get soaked in blood?
When the saints come crashing in?
Could you do some damage to the shape I'm in?
Ruin this ruin and go to the end

Leave your mark on me
Make an impression
Don't warn me before you cut

The moon reflects off your tools
Love me long
Don't slave me
Don't spit on my blood after I'm gone
