Yea I'm running hot
I'm running hot 
I'm running hotter and hotter and hotter 
As the years go by I can't deny the flame that burns inside me
Many times I wonder why I still act the same way 
Something burning inside, I get hotter and hotter 

Got green lights standing in my way
Hotter and hotter, hotter and hotter, hotter and hotter, oh Yeah 

I refuse, I refuse
To standing around being abused 
I'm already gone when you turn your head
Don't point your finger of blame 
You see me burning like the sun in your eyes
And you want to slow down but I just have to fly
I'm hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter as the days go on, man 

Hotter and hotter
As the days go on
Year after year after year after year
I'm on fire
You can't stop me 

No need, no need to ever burn out. I'm scorching and torching no time for front
porching. 
Hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter... and hotter 
Hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter


The days go on and the years go by and I'm hotter and hotter and flying on by
Better looking less of same I'm on my way to up the road to the next thing 
You see me burning hotter and hotter and the years go by
You wonder to yourself how come that man hasn't burned out
Don't ask me why 
Got ..... in front of me

Getting hotter and hotter you see
Hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter...oh yea
Hotter and hotter and hotte and hotter and hotter you see
Hotter and hotter and hotte and hotter and hotter you see
Gasoline for breakfast, Napalm for lunch
Hotter and hotter and hotte and hotter and hotter... yea ... yea ... yea
