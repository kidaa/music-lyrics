See me - Put yourself in my place
Be me - Put my eyes in your face
Maybe then you'll see why this place terrifies me
And why I've got to get myself away
So hard to deal with the ones who can't feel
They continually blow my mind

No need - I've been burned enough times myself
You're like me - Sometimes you scare yourself
The things that you think
And the way that you feel
Makes you think you're all alone
When you go outside
And try to find a familiar mind
It really lets you know that you're on your own
So unknown

When those walls close in around you
When all about you doubt you
When the world can live without you
Get a grip and keep it
You see how hard they'll shove you
Hate your guts and tell you they love you
Get a grip right now
You see how far you get pushed
How long they'll hold you down
Feed you lies
Drive you insane
Give you poison to kill your pain

Know me - I see the fear in your eyes
Pull back - There are some things to realize
So hard to deal with the ones who aren't real
It's unbelievable what they'll put you through
Twist you up inside
Filthify and punish your mind
You don't have to live like that
You've got to get your self respect
Jump back, get your self respect
You've got to jump back
Keep your self respect intact
You've got to keep it like that
Your self respect
