Don't like to think too much, it makes me think too much,
it keeps my mind on my mind
Don't wanna see too much, it makes me see to much
sometimes I'd rather be blind

All the things that they're saying & doing
when they pass me by just fills me up with noise
it overloads me
I wanna disconnected myself
pull my brain stem out and unplug myself
I want nothing right now, I want to pull it out

Chorus:
yeah, I want to pull it out, yeah
I wanna break it all down, hey, I wanna pull it out
yeah, yeah, disconnect myself, disconnect myself
I wanna see it go down, yeah, disconnect myself

A thousand miles an hour going nowhere fast
clinging to the details of your past
talking 'bout your damages and your wasting my time
wanna be the king of pain, stand in line
all the numbers and the colours and the facts
backed by the rumours and the figures and the stats
I think I'm gonna download my mind

Chorus

Too damn bad if at the end of the day the only thoughts
in your brain are all the things that they say, what a waste
Too damn bad if at the end of the line you got no idea
what's on your own mind, you got no one to blame but yourself
Too much to know, too much to see
it might mean something to you but it's nothing to me
its just another ad for someone's version of how they think it should be

I wanna disconnect myself, pull my brains damn out, unplug myself
I want nothing right now, I want to pull it out
