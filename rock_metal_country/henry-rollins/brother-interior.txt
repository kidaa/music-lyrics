The lonely path I walk
To the end of the line
Let all my dreams be yours
Your nightmares mine

I call your name out
So I know I'm not alone
The brother interior
Inside my soul you're sewn
I won't be calling for long 

Deep in my coma 
Darkness is all I see 
In the shadow of death
You light a way for me
My only brother
Why did you have to die?
You're always shining 
The brightest star in the sky
I won't be crawling for long 

Every day is a blessing 
Every day I learn
Every night is a mission
And every time it's a lesson that burns
I now something better waits for me 
Till then I live in memories 
I won't be burning for long
