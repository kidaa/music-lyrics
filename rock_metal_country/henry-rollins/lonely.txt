I hate the world that I think hates me
Punch holes in the wall you know that hurts me
Feel dark and cold alone it burns me
Wish someone would come and touch me
Walkin' alone in the prison yard
Seein' eyes that seem to see me so hard
Crawlin' like a snake right back in to my room
Feelin' like a dead man rolling around in my tomb
There's nothin' like findin' someone when you're lonely
Makes you wanna feel so all alone
There's nothin like finding someone when you're lonely
Makes you feel so...
Walk in to a crowded room I start to freeze
Words fall short now turns to what it's time to leave
Never happy, never sad, I can face
Can't stop lookin' I keep walkin' from place to place
There's nothin like finding someone when you're lonely
Makes you wanna be so all alone
There's nothin' like finding someone when you're lonely
Makes you feel so...
Aww, yeah!
Hear no sounds they seem to keep me sane
Knife in eyes and point me at my prey
Reachin' out of my soul it's senseless
Reachin' out of my mind it's useless
I feel the mute frustration when I see your eyes
Mute is a way but Isolation iyt hurts to try
I reach out my hand - it turns to stone
I get up, walk out the door, I'm better off alone
