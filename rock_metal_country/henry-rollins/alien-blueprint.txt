You reached out
You got burned
Made tough by the lessons you learned
You never thought they could be so mean
Be so hard and cause you so much pain
Like a fool
You tired again
You really wanted to be their friend
But looking back you see they just wasted your time
Self loathing
The anger inside
You covered it up with pride
You always found a way to blame it on yourself

So mad
So mean
The pain remained unseen
All that time spent up wanting to explode
What they did
The things they said
You wished that you were dead
Anything not to deal with them
They made you hate
You couldn't wait
To go out and do something great
Turn around and throw it right back in their face

Looking back you get yourself together
Looking back you see the hatred inside
Now you see that you get to change your mind about yourself
And get to move on
Looking back you see you just wasted your time
Looking back you can see all you've got is yourself
You can tell by the look in their eyes

Now you see
How you are
The wisdom mixed in with all the scars
Watching all the fools
They never knew
They never do
It was always up to you
You gotta get it for yourself
You never were
One of them
They could have never been our friends
The best revenge is to always survive yourself
