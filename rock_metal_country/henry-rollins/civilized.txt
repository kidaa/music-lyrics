I'm sitting in my room in your prison doing time
Bars on my windows because your not so good at crime
Standing on the corner with nothing in your head
Shirt on your back and a gun in your pants
Thinking you're the man but you're only a stand in
Standing in line to be the next bad guy
I see what you do when you use what you got
But what do you do when you do what you want

You're so civilized
You get brutalized
I see you get yourself cut down

Getting your mind off some guy's record
Making his money off fools like you
Singin' about killing like it ain't no thing
But you'll do the time when you live it for real
Paying his way from your Death Row cell
You're the last one to see that you got sold out
I hear you say you hate pigs so much
Then why the hell do you act like one

A gun in your hand makes a fool out of you
A gun in your hand makes a target out of me
Freedom?
You want your freedom
You can't handle freedom
You're dying for it
