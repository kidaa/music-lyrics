I should have seen my end coming from a long way off
My friend said man she'll give you the blues, don't get caught
But I went ahead and told myself a bunch of lies
And spent night after hammered night getting back my mind

I am a fool when I think I need you
I'm a fool to believe
My heart is so wide open
I'm so easy to deceive
I'm a fool I'll keep believing
Like a fool I'll believe it all
I'm a fool who'll keep on coming
And like a fool, I will crawl

I waste time in my mind thinking of you - I'm a fool I know
And it hurts to take the pain over and over - I'm a fool I know
I keep wrecking myself when I should be healing my wounds
I'm a fool I know
Self mutilation is the only thing that I know - I'm a fool I know

I've watched your front teeth sharpen and I've felt your muscles flex
You have the kind of eyes that turn mere mortals into wrecks
I know first hand so well all the hard times you direct
Seduced rejected reduced ejected again
