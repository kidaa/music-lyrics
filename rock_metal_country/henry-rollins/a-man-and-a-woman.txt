A man and a woman locked in a hot apartment prison
They're in love, love
He's beatin' that woman's head against the fridgerator door
Slammin' that woman's head against the fridgerator door
They're in love, they're in love, they're in love
He's beatin' that woman to an inch of her life
Beatin' that woman to an inch of her life
Beatin' that woman to an inch of her life
The heed and the hate, the heed and the hate, the heed and the hate
The heed and the hate make the windows sweat, make the windows sweat
Makes the walls moan, moan, moan, moan
Now outside in the hallway al the neighbors 
From all the other apartment building rooms have gathered in the hallway
And they're all out there armed with their baseball bats and brooms
Listening to the man beat the woman to an inch of her life
Now all the wise guys are in the back takin' bets
The one man says, 
"I say, he's gonna kill her, my money's down that says he's gonna kill her."
And the other man says,
"He's not gonna kill her, he's gonna beat that woman to an inch of her life,
beat that woman to an inch of her life, beat that woman to an inch of her 
life, beat that woman to an inch of her life. That's where my money is, so
put your money down, put your money down, put your money down."
A little while later the cops come
And they come up the stairs 
And they see all the people gathered in the hallways
With their baseball bats and brooms
See the wise guys in the back throwin' 5 dollar bills back and forth
And they say,
"Alright, which room is it?"
And a few of the people point to the room at the end of the hall
The cops go over there and they kick the door in
And they see the man beatin' on the woman, slammin' her head up against the 
wall, beatin' that woman to an inch of her life.
And they say,
"Hey man, why you beatin' that woman to an inch of her life, why you beatin'
that woman to an inch of her life, why you beatin' that woman to an inch of
her life?"
And, the man says, get this, the man says...,
"That's no woman that's my wife, 
That's no woman that's my wife, 
That's no woman that's my wife, 
And when she screams she turns on all the apartment lights on."
