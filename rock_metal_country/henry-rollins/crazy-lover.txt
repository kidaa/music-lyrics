I've got money to spend
Time to waste
Come on baby, let's get straight
Just me and you, that's all
We two can really have a ball

Chorus
I'm a crazy lover

Those two cats may brag how sweet they are
But baby, baby I know the score
I'm sweeter than the peaches that come in the can
I'm even super than superman

Chorus

I'm hotter than the sun on the 4th of July
I can sweet talk you mamma, make you want to cry
Like dynamite baby, by the load
An' just a kiss from you mama I'm libel to explode

Chorus

I'm dressed to kill baby, don't you know
I've got a brand new car and a while lot of dough
I want you with me everywhere I go
So listen to me mam 'cuz I'm telling you so
