You say your job is a pain
It's pulling you down the drain
I think you'd rather complain
Than quit it

He knocks you to the floor 
But you go back for more when you could walk out the door
He's a loser honey, leave him 

Win lose or draw
I want it all
Life's so short
No safety net

You get what you get
What you settle for

You say your town is too small, you live your life at the mall
You can't have it all until you leave it behind you
And you wait for the day when luck will come home to stay 
You never get your way 
You go out --you make it 

Win lose or draw
I want it all
Life's so short
No safety net

You get what you get
What you settle for

Don't justify your complacency to me
That's not an adventure, that's a job
You say you lack what it takes
You say your face lacks a face
There's a fact you gotta face
They broke the mold when they made ya

Living under a cloud
Living quiet or loud
Another face in the crowd
Or one in ten million 

Win lose or draw
I want it all
Life's so short
Win lose or draw
I want it all
Life's so short, life's so short, life's so short, life's to short man
