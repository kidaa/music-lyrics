Hard times, got hard times, hard times
Got blues, got blues, you got, you got, got, got, got, got, got, got, got
Yeah! Blues! 
You got "My boss, man, is a bastard and I wanna kill him" blues.
You got "My boyfriend's a motherfucker 
and I wanna cut his balls off and shove 'em right down his throat" blues.
Can't take it, can't take it no more, can't take it, can't take it no more
Blues!
I got gun in my mouth blues
I got gun-in-my-mouth blues.
Lookin' out my window, sun comes up, sun comes burnin' down
No answer, no answer, no aswer, no answer, no answer, no answer, no answer
I'm alone in my room, but I'm not by myself
I'm alone in my room, but I'm not by myself
I've got my hands wrapped 'round my gun
I've got my hands wrapped 'round my gun
No answer, no answer, no answer, no answer, no answer, no answer, no answer
Can't touch me, can't touch me, can't touch me, can't touch me, can't touch me
Suck in.
Pull it, pull it, pull it, pull it.
