I see you from across the room
Is there something on your mind? 
I'm thinking about taking the round about route
I'm thinking about the straightest line 
Is it me, or is me and you? 
Give me some indication so I'll know what to do

Love's so heavy
Love's so heavy
Can you catch me as I'm falling past your window pane?
Love's so heavy
Catch me as I'm falling 
Love is so heavy

There's always something that keeps us far apart
Seems like it's already over before it even starts
You said, she said, he said, I said 
No one said a word
Is it something that I did or something that you heard?

Love's so heavy
Love's so heavy
I'm getting knotted up
Not again
Love's so heavy
Love's so heavy
Catch me as I'm falling 
Love is so heavy

Look out

I never knew you like I wanted to
The things you said meant a lot to me
I wonder what they meant to you
So much I'd like to tell you
But I know you don't wanna know
Every time I want to be with you
Is the time that it's time to go
Oh well 

Love's so heavy
Love's so heavy
Oh...ha...
Love's so heavy
Love's so heavy
Catch me as I'm falling 
Love is so heavy
It's so heavy
