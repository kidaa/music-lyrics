It's hard to get high
And it's hard to get thru
It's hard to hear me
When I'm talking to you
You see these hard eyes
You know what I mean
These eyes got hard
After what they've seen

I'm that hard man
So good to find
I'm that hard man
With an iron mind

I got hard
I stayed hard
Can't keep me down
Because I'm hard
I keep moving because I'm hard
I keep burning because I'm hard

I'm going over
Not getting by
Hard sense makes sense

Real pain is what I reach
The real this is what I keep
I am because I'm hard
I will because I'm hard
