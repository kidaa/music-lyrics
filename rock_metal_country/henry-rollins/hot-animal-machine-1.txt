Looking at the bottom, what do I see
I see the bottom staring back at me
You have to part animal part machine
If you take a good look around you'll see what I mean
I won't take, I won't break x5
Seeing fear in their eyes
They won't rest easy until the other dies
You have to be part animal part machine
If you take a good look around you'll see what I mean
I won't take, I won't break x5
Sitting in a hot prison going insane
I gotta stay un depressed gotta try to maintain
You have to be part animal part machine
Take a good look raound you'll see what I mean
I won't take, I won't break x5
Bars on the windows locks on the door
Drugs in the cabinet, drugged to the door
You have to be part animal part machine
If you take a good look around you'll see what I mean
I won't take, I won't break...
