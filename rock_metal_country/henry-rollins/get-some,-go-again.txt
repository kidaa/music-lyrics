One look in my eyes and you know what I came here for
One look in my eyes and you know what I came here for
Take a look at my eyes and you know what I came here for
Take a look at my eyes and you know what I came here for

I do a lot, I do a lot, I do a lot of stuff
I like it when, I like it when, I like it when it's tough
One look in my eyes and you know what I came here for

I don't live to please you, I just want to walk the line
I don't live to love you, I just want to walk the line

Man is just an animal underneath the sun
I'm nothing but an animal underneath the sun
Your woman looks good and I'm gonna see your blood tonight

Inspiration don't you tell me that you got none left
Inspiration don't you tell me that you got none left
I like it when it's over and another one's begun
I like it when it's over and another one's begun

I look at my watch and it always says it'stime to go go
