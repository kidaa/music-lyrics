I am the man from a human choke hold
I am the product of your restraint
I watched the years pass by me
Never once did I complain
Never once did I say no
Now I watch myself explode
My body is scarred by age
Now you get to taste my rage
From the wreckage of humiliation
I got my self respect
I pulled myself together
What the hell did you expect
You should see the pain I go through
When I see myself I see you
Everything that you did I do
When I see myself I see you
Rage

I'm just like you
My flesh isn't my flesh
My blood isn't my blood
