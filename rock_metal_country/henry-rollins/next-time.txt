I saw this cat leave my pad
And this made me awful sad
But in the mean time I was gettin' mad
And I said,"Baby what explanation do you have?"
She said, "Mmmmmmm, Next Time"
What do you mean Next Time?
No next time baby, that ws the last time 
I got my hat and headed for the door
I knew I wouldn't be back there no more
And the landlord came up a real cool jed he said,
"Hey buddy, how bout the rent?"
I said, "Mmmmmmmm, Next Time"
What do you mean Next Time?
He said no next time, you gonna pay me right now
Now after the confusion had all died down
I figured I'd better get outta town
But when I arrived at the airport
There stood a man with a notice sayin'
Bail ya to support
I said, "Mmmmmmm, Next Time"
What do you mean Next Time?
He said no, next time, you comin' home right now
They took me to see an old friend of mine
Yeah district court, room 229
Just say your payments are way behind
I said, "Don't worry daddy, it won't happen next time."
And he said, "Mmmmmmmm, Next Time."
What do you mean Next Time?
Ain't gonna be no next time, cuz you goin' to jail right now."
