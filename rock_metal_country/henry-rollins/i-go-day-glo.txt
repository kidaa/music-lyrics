What do you know?
Same as I know
How do you feel?
Same as I feel 
Same old talk is going round and round
All the smiles are turning into frowns 
When they say low and I say high
When they tell me that I better
I know it's all a lie
I know it's all a lie 
I know it's all a lie 
I know it's all a lie 
I know it's all a lie 

See them lined up
Bus stop wind up
Same day same time
Time to change up 
Same old talk is dragging round and round 
Pulls the smiles down into frowns 
Look in the mirror, see your shining eyes
You know right then that you will never die
You'll never die
You'll never die
Will never die 
Will never die
Ah look out man 

Like I said
Brain like halo
I go day glo
They say go slow
I say hell no 
Same old talk is going round and round
All the smiles are turning into frowns 

Off to the races
On with the show
Show me the next place
I really wanna go
I wanna go
