I wanna know, why the people are everywhere... and...
I wanna know, where to go if I get scared... and...
I wanna be, in a place where no one cares, and... 

I, I, I wanna know you!
'Cause you're so damn cool!
Yeah, you're so damn cool! 

I wanna feel like I'm floatin' in the air... and...
I wanna know if the sun'ss gonna bleach my hair... and
I wanna know why life's so unfair and... I wanna know you!
Because you're so damn cool!
Yeah, you're so damn cool! 

Who knows what I'm feelin' inside of me!
And who knows if I'm feelin' all right!
Who knows what I'm feelin' inside of me
Who knows what is runnin' around in my brain 

Now that I'm done and I seen it
And don't think that I'm tryin' to complain
Don't think I'm lyin' 'cause I mean it
n' all you people out there don't look at me to lay
all of your blame 'cause you need me
and you want me to go down
in flames with the rest
But I'm so sick of denyin'
What is runnin' around in my brain
