My cup runneth over
Like blood from a stone

[CHORUS]
These stand for me
Name your god and bleed the freak
I like to see
How you all would bleed for me

When the pig runs slower
Let the arrow fly
When the sin lies bolder
I'll pluck out thine eye

[CHORUS]

If you scorn my lover
Satan got your thigh
If you steal in hunger
I will kick you when you try

[CHORUS]
