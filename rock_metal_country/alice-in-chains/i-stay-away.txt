Yeah, I want to travel south
This year
Aaah, Woah, Woah
Won't prevent safe passage here

Why you act crazy
Not an act maybe
So close a lady
Shifty eyes shade

Yeah, hey Yeah, tears that soak
A callous heart

Why you act frightened
I am enlightened
Your weakness builds me
So someday you'll see

I stay away
