A Good Night, The Best In A Long Time
A New Friend Turned Me On To An Old Favorite
Nothing BetterThan A Dealer Who's High
Be High, Concince Them To Buy

What's My Drug Of Choice
Well, What Have You Got
I Don't Go Broke
And I Do It Alot

Seems So Sick To The Hypocrite Norm
Running Their Boring Drills
But We Are An Elite Race Of Our Own
The Stoners, Junkies, And Freaks

Are You Happy I Am, Man
Content And Fully Aware
Money, Status, Nothing To Me
'Cause Your Life Is Empty And Bare

You Can't Understand A User's Mind
But Try, With Your Books And Degrees
If You Let Yourself Go And Open Your Mind
I'll Bet You'd Be Doing Like Me
And It Ain't So Bad

Say, I Do It Alot!
Say, I Do It Alot!
Say, I Do It Alot!
Say, I Do It Alot!
