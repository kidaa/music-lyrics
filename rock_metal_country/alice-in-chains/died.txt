I could climb until I reach where angels reside
Ask around to find out where the junkies applied
You just up and left me on this rock all alone
It's my fault for knowing not what I should have known

Ohhhh Oh Oh
My heart is tired of beating slow 
Ohh Ohh
It's been depleating since you died
Died
Since you died
You died

I could drop until I touch the sinister side
Visit all attractions flippin' back and aside
Still you leave me rotting on this rock all alone
It's my fault for knowing not what I should have known

Ohhhh Oh Oh
My heart is tired of beating slow 
Ohh Ohh
It's been depleating since you died
Died
Since you died
You died

Ohhh Oh Oh
My heart is tired of beating slow 
Uhh Ohh 
It's been depleating since you died
Died
Since you died
You died

I could climb until I reach where angels reside
I could drop until I touch the sinister side

Ohhhh Oh 
My heart is tired of beating slow 
Uhh Ohh
It's been depleating since you died
Died
Since you died
You died
Died
You died
Died
You died
