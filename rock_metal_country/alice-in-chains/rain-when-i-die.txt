Is She Ready To Know My Frustration 
What She Slippin' Inside, Slow Castration
I'm A Riddle So Strong, You Can't Break Me
Did She Come Here To Try, Try To Take Me

Did She Call My Name
I Think It's Gonna Rain
When I Die

Was It Something I Said, Held Against Me
Ain't No Life On The Run, Slowly Climbing
Caught In Ice So She Stares, Stares At Nothing
I Can Help Her But Won't, Now She Hates Me

She Won't Let Me Hide
She Don't Want Me To Cry

Will She Keep On The Ground, Trying To Ground Me
Slowly Forgive My Lie, Lying To Save Me
Could She Love Me Again, Or Will She Hate Me
Prob'ly Not, I Know Why, Can't Explain Me
