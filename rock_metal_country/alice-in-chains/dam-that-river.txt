I Broke You In The Canyon
I Drowned You In The Lake
You A Snake That I Would Trample
Only Thing I'd Not Embrace

Oh, You Couldn't Dam That River
And Maybe I Don't Give A Damn Anyway
So You Couldn't Dam That River
And It Washed Me So Far Away

I Pushed And Then You Stumbled
I Kicked You In The Face
You Stare At Me So Hollow
Got To Keep That Killin' Pace

Oh, You Couldn't Dam That River
And Maybe I Don't Give A Damn Anyway
So You Couldn't Dam That River
And It Washed Me So Far Away

I Burned The Place Around You
I Hit You With A Rake
You Piss Upon My Candle
So Proving You're A Fake
