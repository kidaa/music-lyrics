What The Hell Am I
Thousand Eyes, A Fly
Lucky Then I'd Be
In One Day Deceased

Sickman, Sickman, Sickman

I Can Feel The Wheel But I Can't Steer
When My Thoughts Become My Biggest Fear

Ah, What's The Difference, I'll Die
In This Sick World Of Mine

What The Hell Am I
Leper From Inside
Inside Wall Of Peace
Dirty And Diseased

Sickman, Sickman, Sickman

I Can See The End Is Getting Near 
I Won't Rest Untill My Head Is Clear

Can You See The End 
Choke On Me My Friend
Must To Drown These Thoughts
Purity Over Rot

Yeah, Though I Walk Through The Valley Of Rape
And Despair
With Head High And Eyes Alert
I Tread On A Plane Of Many

We Who Are Of Good Nature And Intention,
But Cannot Touch On The Dark
Recess Of Memory
And Pain Learned, So Come Walk
With Me, Feel The Pain, 
And Release It

What The Hell Am I
Worn Eroded Pride
Saddened 10 Mile Wide
I'm Gonna Let It Slide

Sickman, Sickman, Sickman

I Can Feel The Wheel But I Can't Steer
When My Thoughts Become My Biggest Fear

Ah, What's The Difference, I'll Die
In This Sick World Of Mine
