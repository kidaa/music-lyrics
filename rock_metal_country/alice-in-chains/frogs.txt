what does friend mean to you
a word so wrongfully abused
are you like me, confused
all included but you
alone...

the sounds of silence often soothe
shapes and colors shift with mood
pupils widen and change their hue
rapid brown avoid clear blue

why's it have to be this way
be this way

flowers watched through wide
brown eyes
a chid sings an unclaimed tune 
innocence spins cold cocoon
grow to see the pain too soon
