I Believe Them Bones Are Me
Some Say We're Born Into The Grave
I Feel So Alone 
Gonna End Up A Big Ole Pile A Them Bones

Dust Rise Right On Over My Time
Empty Fossil Of The New Scene
I Feel So Alone
Gonna End Up A Big Ole Pile A Them Bones

Toll Due Bad Dream Come True
I Lie Dead Gone Under Red Sky
I Feel So Alone 
Gonna End Up A Big Ole Pile A Them Bones
