Am I too contagious
Full of sick desire
Am I that I promise
Burning corpsed pyre

Then some dude came down to touch the Mother
Mother touched, and dude ain't here no more

Am I your reflection
Melting mirror smile
Am I worth the value
Do my love defile

Then some dude came down to touch the Mother
Mother touched and dude ain't here no more
Ain't no day the sun don't crack
Try brand some name across my back so you care
Find someone to tell you

[CHORUS]
Sunshine...sweet love my labor
Don't mind...I don't care no more

Can you face the queston
Is my soul entire

[CHORUS]
