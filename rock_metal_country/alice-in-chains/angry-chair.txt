Sitting On An Angry Chair
Angry Walls That Steal The Air
Stomach Hurts And I Don't Care

What Do I See Across The Way
See Myself Molded In Clay
Stares At Me, Yeah I'm Afraid
Changing The Shape Of His Face

Candles Red I Have A Pair
Shadows Dancing Everywhere
Burning On The Angry Chair

Little Boy Made A Mistake
Pink Cloud Has Now Turned To Grey
All That I Want Is To Play
Get On Your Knees, Time To Pray Boy

I Don't Mind, Yeah
I Dont Mind, I-I-I
Lost My Mind, Yeah
But I Don't Mind, I-I-I
Can't Find It Anywhere
I Don't Mind

Corporate Prison We Stay
I'm A Dull Boy, Work All Day
So I'm Strung Out Anyway

Lonliness Is Not A Phase
Field Of Pain Is Where I Graze
Serenity Is Far Away 

Say My Reflection And Cried
So Little Hope That I Died
Feed Me Your Lies, Open Wide
Weight Of My Heart, Not The Size

Pink Cloud Has Now Turned To Grey 
All That I Want Is To Play
Get On Your Knees Time To Pray
