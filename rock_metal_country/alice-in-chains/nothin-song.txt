began this take at 7:38
head hit the board, enough that it aches
wonder should i be workin so late
began this take at 7:38
head hit the board, enough that it aches
wonder should i be workin so late
wonder should i be workin so late

the nothin' song sticks to your mouth
like peanut butter on the brain
nothin' ever stays the same
nothin'
yeah, nothin'
nothin' 
nothin'

went outside to give all a break
wearing cowhide steak on a skate
back inside Sam throw away your cake
went outside to give all a break
wearing cowhide steak on a skate
back inside Sam throw away your cake
back inside Sam throw away your cake

[chorus]

Gotta finish so i can awake
feed the cat or she spreads all the waste
snap her neck or trade in for new make
Gotta finish so i can awake
feed the cat or she spreads all the waste
snap her neck or trade in for new make
snap her neck or trade in for new make

the nothin' song sticks to your mouth
like peanut butter on the brain
nothin' ever stays the same
the nothin song sticks to your mouth
