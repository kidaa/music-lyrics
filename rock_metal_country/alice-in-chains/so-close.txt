Why are we here again
It's the same ol' sit down roll around
Chewed up pen

Nothin' thrilling me too much, yeah
Nothing thrilling me

Yeah, so close now
Yeah, so close now

Man, I nearly snapped my twig
Then again I nearly snapped
A few of you

So I hear you think highly now
So I hear you think

Yeah, so close now
Yeah, so close now

Why
Why
Why
