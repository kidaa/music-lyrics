Scary's on the wall
Scary's on his way

Watch where you spit
I'd advise you wait until it's over
Then you got hit
And you shoulda known better

And we die young
Faster we run

Down, down, down you're rollin'
Watch the blood float in the muddy sewer
Take another hit
And bury your brother

[CHORUS]

Scary's on the wall
Scary's on his way

Another alley trip
Bullet seeks the place to bend you over
Then you got hit
And you shoulda known better
