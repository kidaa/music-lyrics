In the darkest hole
You'd be well advised
Not to plan my funeral before the
Body Dies

Come the morning light
It's a see-through show
What you may have heard and
What you think you know

Let the sun never blind your eyes
Let me sleep so my teeth won't grind
Hear a sound from a voice inside

Sure to play a part
So you love the game
And in truth your lies
Become one and same

I could set you free 
Rather hear the sound
Of your body breaking
As I take you down

Let the sun never blind your eyes
Let me sleep so my teeth won't grind
Hear a sound from a voice inside

In the darkest hole
You'd be well advised
Not to plan my funeral before the
Body dies

Let the sun never blind your eyes
Let me sleep so my teeth won't grind
Hear a sound from a voice inside
