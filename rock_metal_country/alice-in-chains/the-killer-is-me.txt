Layne: Thanks. I think that's it.
Crowd: No! No!
A guy: Booooh!
Layne: Hey fuck you man!
Crowd: Laughs, noise. Be good! Good boys.
Layne: Okay, one more!
Jerry: This is huh, something we were screwing around with at 
soundchecks, we're gonna just give it another shot here, try this out, 
see how it sounds.
Goes something like this, wrote a song about it, wanna hear it? Here it 
goes!

 That senator don't love no drug program, he been a dopehead for thirty 
years... There ya go... The senator don't like no women, he prefers 
young boys in leather... 

Jerry: It's called The Killer Is Me

The Killer Is Me
New song! By Jerry Cantrell
This track is incorrectly listed as  Killer Is Me  should be  THE Killer Is Me 


Don't need a gun
Pointed at me
No need to run
The killer is me
The killer is me
So the sun
Shines upon me
I'm havin' fun
The killer is me
Insane the mind
In the name of me
Can't find the time
To let things be
Insane the mind
In the name of me
Can't find the time
To let things be
Let things be
Oh yeah... Can I start over
Oh yeah... Can I start over
And get over it
So the sun
Shines upon me
I'm havin' fun
The killer is me
The killer is me
The killer is me
Oh yeah... Can I start over
Oh yeah... Can I start over
And get over it
Let things be
Jerry: Thanks, that was really fun!
Layne: I wish I could just hug you all! But I'm not gonna.
