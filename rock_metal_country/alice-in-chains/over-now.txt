yeah, it's over now
but i can breathe somehow
when it's all worn out
i'd rather go without

you know it's been on my mind
could you stand right here
look me straight in the eye and say
that it's over now

we pay our debt sometime

well it's over now
yet i can see somehow
when it's all gone wrong
it's hard to be so strong

we pay our debt sometime

guess it's over now
i seem alive somehow
when it's out of sight
just wait and do your time

you know it's been on my mind
could i stand right here
look myself in the eyes, and say
that it's over now

we pay our debt sometime
