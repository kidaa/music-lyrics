Ain't Found A Way To
Kill Me Yet
Eyes Burn With Stinging
Sweat
Seems Every Path Leads Me To 
Nowhere
Wife And Kids And Household Pet
Army Green Was No Safe Bet
The Bullets Scream To Me From Somewhere

Here They Come To Snuff The Rooster
Yeah Here Come The Rooster
You Know He Ain't Gonna Die

Walkin' Tall Machine Gun Man
They Spit On Me In My Homeland
Gloria Sent Me Pictures
Of My Boy
Got My Pills 'Gainst 
Mosquito Death
My Buddy's Breathin' 
His Dyin' Breath
Oh God Please Won't You Help
Me Make It Through
