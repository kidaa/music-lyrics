Hey Ah Na Na
Ignorance is spoken
Spoken

Confidence is broken
Broken

Sustenance is stolen
Stolen

Arrogance is potent
What I see is unreal
I've written my own part
Eat of the apple, so young
I'm crawling back to start

Hey Ah Na Na
A romance is fallen
Fallen

I repent tomorrow
Tomorrow

Is suspended my sorrow
Sorrow
