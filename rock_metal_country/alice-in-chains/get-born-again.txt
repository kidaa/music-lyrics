Sad suffering
I knew him when
Fairweather friends of mine
Trying not to think
I merely blink
Hope to wish away the lines

I...

Can you protect 
Me when I'm wrecked
I pretend you're still alive

I... Yeah...

I choose the day
Warm, damp and gray
Thick fog will hide our smiles

Clear all your sins
Get born again
Just repeat a couple lines

I... Lies... 

Yeah

Can you protect 
Me when I'm wrecked
I pretend you're still alive
I choose the day
Warm, damp and gray
Thick fog will hide our smiles

Sad suffering
Get born again
Sad suffering
Get born again
Sad suffering
Get born again
Sad suffering
Get born again
Sad suffering
Get born again
Sad suffering
Get born again
