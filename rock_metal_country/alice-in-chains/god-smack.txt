Care Not For The Men Who Wonder
Straw That Broke Your Back, You're Under
Cast All Them Aside Who Care
Empty Eyes And Dead End Stare

Don't You Know That None Are Blind
To The Lie, And You Think I Don't Find
What You Hide

What In God's Name Have You Done
Stick Your Arm For Some Real Fun

For The Horse You've Grown Much Fonder
Than For Me, That I Don't Ponder
As The Hair Of One Who Bit You
Smiling Bite Your Own Self, Too

And I Think That You're Not Blind
To The Ones You Left Behind
I'll Be Here

So Be Yearning All Your Life
Twisting, Turning Like A Knife

Now You Know The Reasons Why
Can't Get High Or You Will Die 
Or You'll Die

So Your Sickness Weighs A Ton
And God's Name Is Smack For Some
