I could use some
Time to curl away
My aggression
Is where you stake
Your claim
Why I question
This curve on which you grade
My conception
A joke Or latest craze

I try to get away
And yet I stick around
So fall and crawl away
And brush away loose ground

My intention
Can I arrive at eight
Lie and dream some
Surprise you guys I'm late
All right, correction, forgetting something
Wait

Brush away loose ground
Brush away loose ground
