Heatbreaker, feelin' alright
Body over...mind
It's slower, reduction is addictive too
Personality overview

[CHORUS]
I can see what the cost will be
You know I don'T need you
I just can't put you down
I can see what it all means to me
Honey I don't need you
I just can't put you down

Hard drinker...feelin' all right
Your maker...mine
It's slower...reduction is addictive too
Personality overview

[CHORUS]

Put you down, down, down, gon put you down
Put you down, down, down, gon put you down
Put you down, down, down, gon put you down
Put you down, down, down, gon put you down
Everything you buy is for the jingle
Every time you lie it's all the same
And if you need a rhyme to kill the singer
Shoot me dead before I may be through
