New York City ain't no kind of place 
For a country girl with a friendly face 
If you smile people look at you funny 
They take it wrong 
The greenest state in the land of the free 
And the home of the Grand Ole Opry 
Is calling me back to my Smoky Mountain home 
I wish I had my old fishin' pole 
And was sitting on the banks of the fishing hole 
Eating green apples and waiting for the fish to bite 
Life ain't as simple as it used to be 
Since the big apple took a bite out of me 
And Lord, I'm so Tennessee homesick that i could die 
Chorus: 
But I ain't been home in I don't know when 
If I had it all to do over again 
Tonight I'd sleep in my old feather bed 
What I wouldn't give for a little bitty taste 
Of Mama's homemade chocolate cake 
Tennessee homesick blues running through my head 
Mama you can fluff my feather bed 
Just as soon as I can I'm gonna head 
Back to the Tennessee hills and it better be soon 
Daddy you can load the rifles up 
We're gonna load them dogs on the pickup truck 
And take off to Calhoun Country and catch us a coon 
Repeat Chorus 
Eatin' grits and gravy and country ham 
Go to church on Sunday with dinner on the grounds 
Tennessee homesick blues are runnin' through my head 
Repeat Chorus 
Good Lord have mercy on a country girl 
Tryin' to make a living in a rhinestone world 
It's hard to be a diamond in a rhinestone world 
With Tennessee homesick blues runnin' through my head 
I've got those Tennessee homesick blues runnin' through my head 
Tennessee homesick blues
