I'll do everything I can to make you proud to be my man 
And I'll fulfill all you fantasies 
I guess we're promising a lot, but for now it's all we've got 
And I'll stand by you thru our rockin' years 
1st Chorus: 
Rockin' chairs, rockin' babies, rock-a-bye, rock of ages 
Side by side we'll be together always 
And if you'll hold me tight when you love me 
That's all I'll ask of you 
And I'll stand by you thru our rockin' years 
I'll be your friend, I'll be your lover 
Until the end, there'll be no other 
'Cause my heart has only room for one 
Yes, I'll always love you, and I'll always be here for you 
And I'll stand by you thru our rockin' years 
Repeat 1st Chorus 
2nd Chorus: 
Rockin' chairs, rockin' babies, rock-a-bye, rock of ages 
Side by side, we'll be together always 
And, yes, I'll always love you and I'll always be here for you 
And I'll stand by you thru our rockin' years, and I'll be here 
And I'll stand by you thru our rockin' years
