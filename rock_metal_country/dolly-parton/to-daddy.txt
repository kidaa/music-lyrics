Momma never seemed to miss the finer things in life 
If she did, she never did say so to daddy 
She never wanted to be more than mother and a wife 
If she did, she never did say so to daddy 
The only things that seemed to be important in her life 
Was to make our house a home and make us happy 
Momma never wanted anymore than what she had 
If she did, she never did say so to daddy 
He often left her all alone 
She didn't mind the stayin' home 
If she did, she never did say so to daddy 
And she never missed the flowers 
And the gifts he never gave her 
If she did, she never did say so to daddy 
Being took for granted was a thing that she accepted 
And she didn't need those things to make her happy 
She didn't even seem to notice 
That he didn't kiss and hold her 
If she did, she never did say so to daddy 
Chorus: 
One morning we awoke 
Just to find the note 
That momma carefully wrote 
And left to daddy 
And as he began to read it 
Our ears could not believe it 
The words that she had written there to daddy 
She said our kids are old enough 
And they don't need me very much 
So I've gone in search for love I need so badly 
I have needed you so long 
But I just can't keep holdin' on 
She never meant to come back home 
If she did, she never did say so to daddy 
Tag: 
Momma's gone 
Good-bye to daddy
