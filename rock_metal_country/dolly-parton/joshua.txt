Well a good ways down the railroad track 
There was this little old rundown shack 
And in it lived a man I'd never seen 
Folks said he was a mean and a vicious man 
And you better not set foot on his land 
I didn't think nobody could be that mean 
So I took me out walking down the railroad track 
I was a-gonna go down to that little old shack 
And just find out if all them things I'd heard was true 
There was a big black dog laying out in the yard 
And it growled at me and I swallowed hard 
And I heard somebody say well who are you 
Oh and there he stood in the door of that shack 
His beard and his hair was long and black 
And he was the biggest man I'd ever seen 
When he spoke his voice was low and deep 
But he just didn't frighten me 
'Cause somehow I just knew he wasn't mean 
He said what you doing snooping 'round my place 
And I saw a smile come across his face 
So I smiled back and I told him who I was 
He said come on in and pull you up a chair 
You might as well since you already here 
And he said you can call me Joshua 
Joshua Joshua 
Whatcha doing living here all alone 
Joshua Joshua 
Ain't you got nobody to call your own 
No no no no 
We talked 'til the sun was clean out of sight 
And we still talking when it come daylight 
And there was just so much we had to say hey 
I'd spent my life in an orphan's home 
And just like him I was all alone 
So I said yeah when he asked if I'd stay 
Oh we grew closer as time went on 
And that little old shack it was a happy home 
And we just couldn't help but fall in love 
That big black dog and that little old shack 
Sitting down by the railroad track 
It's plenty good enough for me and Joshua 
Joshua Joshua 
Why you're just what I've been looking for 
Joshua Joshua 
You ain't gonna be lonesome anymore 
No no 
Yodel-a-he-ho 
Me and Joshua 
Me and Joshua 
Me and Joshua yeah yeah 
Me and Joshua
