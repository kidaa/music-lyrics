I used to think maybe you loved me 
Now, baby, I'm sure 
And I just can't wait 'til the day 
When you knock on my door 
Now every time I go to the mailbox 
I gotta hold myself down 
'Cause I just can't wait 'til you write me 
You're coming to town 
Chorus: 
I'm walking on sunshine, woh, oh 
I'm walking on sunshine, woh, oh 
I'm walking on sunshine, woh, oh 
And it's time to feel good 
It's time to feel good 
I used to think maybe you loved me 
Now I know that it's true 
But I don't want to spend my whole life 
Just a waiting for you 
Now I don't want you back for the weekend 
Or just for a day, no, no 
Baby I just want you back 
And I want you to stay 
Repeat Chorus 
Walking, I'm walking on sunshine 
I'm walking on sunshine, woh, oh 
I'm walking on sunshine, woh, oh 
I'm walking on sunshine, woh, oh 
And it's time to feel good 
It's time to feel good, now
