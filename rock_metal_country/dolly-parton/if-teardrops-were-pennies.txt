Wagon and Dolly Parton
An acre of diamonds I'd offer to you
A solid gold mansion, an airplane or two
This whole world would be yours to have and to hold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
Chorus
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
I'd have all the riches my pockets would hold
I'd be oh so wealthy with treasures untold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold. 
The tears that have fallen won't buy you a thing
The heartaches you caused me won't pay for a ring
The love that I wanted would not have grown cold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold.
Repeat chorus
But teardrops aren't pennies
And heartaches aren't gold
