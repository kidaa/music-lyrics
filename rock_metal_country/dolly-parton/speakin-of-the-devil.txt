He's got a way of walkin' 
He's got a way of talkin' 
A way to fascinate me all the time 
And he's got a way with women 
A way to keep my head a swimmin' 
He's got away too many times 
Chorus: 
Ooh, speakin' of the devil 
Well, here he comes now 
Lookin' like an angel 
Got my defenses down 
He's got me dreamin' 
Got me schemin' 
Ooh, speakin' of the devil 
He is drivin' me wild 
With that wicked little grin 
And that fire in his eyes 
He's got me dreamin' 
Got me steamin' 
Ooh, speakin' of the devil 
It feels mighty close to heaven 
And I'd go through hell to make him mine 
He's got his spell upon me 
Got to be his one and only 
Burning with passion and desire 
Ooh, I'm caught up in all his magic 
It surely would be tragic 
To never share the heat 
From all this fire 
Repeat Chorus Twice 
Speakin' of the devil 
Speakin' of the devil 
I'd go through hell to make him mine
