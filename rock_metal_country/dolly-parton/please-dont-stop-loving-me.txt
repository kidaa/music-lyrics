Please,Please dont stop loving me
Or I couldn't make alone
Please,Please dont stop loving me
Or I couldn't make it when you're gone
You bring me the sunshine
When I is inside
And when I'm in darkness
You bring me the light
You opened my yes when I 
Couldn't see
So please, o-oh please 
Don't stop loving me-e
Please,Please don't stop loving me
Or I couldn't make it alone
Please,Please dont stop loving me
Or I couldn't make it when you're gone
You bring me the sunshine
When I is inside
And when I'm in darkness
You bring me the light
You opened my eyes when I
Couldn't see
So please,o-oh please
Don't stop loving me
