There is a house down in New Orleans 
Down in the Vieux Carr'e 
A house they call the rising sun 
Where love and money are made 
My father he was a gambler 
Mother died when I was young 
And I've worked since then 
To please the men 
At the house of the rising sun 
There is a house 
Down in New Orleans 
They call the rising sun 
It's been the ruin of many a good girl 
And oh God, you know I'm one 
So mothers you go telling all your daughters 
Not to do what I've done 
To live a life of sin, shame and strife 
In the house of the rising sun 
There is a house in New Orleans 
They call the rising sun 
It's been the ruin of many a good girl 
And oh God, you know I'm one 
Oh God, you know I'm one
