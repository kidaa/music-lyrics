Chorus: 
You'll never be the sun turning in the sky 
And you won't be the moon above us on a moonlit night 
And you won't be the stars in heaven 
Although they burn so bright 
But even on the deepest ocean 
You will be the light 
You may not always shine 
As you go barefoot over stone 
You might be so long together 
Or you might walk alone 
And you won't find that love comes easy 
But that love is always right 
So even when the dark clouds gather 
You will be the light 
And if you lose the part inside 
When loves turns round on you 
Leaving the past behind 
Is knowing you'll do like you always do 
Holding you blind, keeping you true 
Repeat Chorus
