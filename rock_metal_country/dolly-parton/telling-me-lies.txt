They say a woman's a fool for weeping 
A fool to break her own heart 
But I can't hold the secret I'm keeping 
I'm breaking apart 
Can't seem to mind my own business 
Whatever I try turns out wrong 
I seem like my own false witness 
And I can't go on 
I cover my ears, I close my eyes 
Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies 
Telling me lies 
You told me you needed my company 
And I believed in your flattering ways 
You told me you needed me forever 
Nearly gave you the rest of my days 
Should've seen you for what you are 
Should never have come back for more 
Should've locked up all my silver 
Brought the key right to your door 
Repeat Chorus 
You don't know what a chance is 
Until you have to seize one 
You don't know what a man is 
Until you have to please one 
Don't put your life in the hands of a man 
With a face for every season 
Don't waste your time in the arms of a man 
Who's no stranger to treason 
Repeat Chorus
