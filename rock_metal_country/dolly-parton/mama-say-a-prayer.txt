The bright lights of the city are a pretty site to see 
Perhaps they're extra pretty to a country girl like me 
Temptation waits at every turn and it won't let me be 
So mama when you pray tonight 
Say a special prayer for me 
I miss your tender good-night kiss of love and understanding 
The good-night kisses I get now are cruel and so demanding 
So mama when you pray tonight 
And while you're on your knees 
Mama say a special prayer for me 
The nights get cold and lonely 
When you're faraway from home 
And lonely makes it easy for a good girl to go wrong 
Evil eyes search through the night for lonely girls like me 
So mama when you pray tonight 
Say a special prayer for me 
I miss your tender good-night kiss of love and understanding 
These good-night kisses I get now are cruel and so demanding 
So mama when you pray tonight 
And while you're on your knees 
Mama say a special prayer for me
