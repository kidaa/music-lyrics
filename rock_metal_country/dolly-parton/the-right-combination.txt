Two people, together
It was just a dream until you came along
My heart was waiting just for you
Tomorrow, forever
We both heard these promises for far too long
And now you make the words come true
So touch me now
I need to have you close tonight
And show me how
You can me feel this way
# You and me, we are the right combination
For love, we're all we need
It's just you and me, we make the right combination
Straight from the heart, love is the key
Can't keep it, a secret
Everything I feel is written on my face
I can't hide my heart from you
You hold me, is magic
In your arms the world becomes a better place
Now I know what love can do
Here we go
Exactly where the road will lead us
I don't know
I just know that you'll be there
# You and me, we are the right combination
For love, we're all we need
It's just you and me, we make the right combination
Straight from the heart, love is the key
And whenever you, I'm there
Every stumble and fall, I share
I'll be yours through it all
Coz I care, about you baby
It's so easy to see, so strong
Now I know you and me, belong
I'll be by your side forever....
# You and me, we are the right combination
For love, we're all we need
It's just you and me, we make the right combination
Straight from the heart, love is the key
