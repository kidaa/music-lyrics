You may not know me now 
But I have been around 
You'll never see my name on any pages 
I'm just the common man 
The fool who understands 
The pain you go through 
When life takes you under 
So, sing for the common man 
A song for the common man 
He paid for the song with the sweat of his brow 
He will survive, he will survive 
You may not know my mother 
My sisters or my brothers 
Yet everyone has given for the other 
You know the working man 
He builds what others plan 
So, everyone of us should sing his story 
So, sing for the common man 
A song for the common man 
He paid for the song with the sweat of his brow 
He will survive, he will survive 
Dat after day 
He keeps working away 
In offices, factories, and farms 
Year after year 
He sheds tear after tear 
He will provide, he will survive 
So, sing for the common man 
A song for the common man 
He paid for the song with the sweat of his brow 
He will survive, he will survive
