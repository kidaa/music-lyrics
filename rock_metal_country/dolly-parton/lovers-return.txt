And so you have come back to me 
And say the old loves growing yet 
You've tried through all these weary years 
You've tried so vainly to forget 
Chrous: 
Oh no, I cannot take your hand 
God never gives is back our youth 
The loving heart you slighted then 
Was yours, my friend, in perfect truth 
Come close and let me see your face 
Your raven hair is tinged with snow 
Oh, yes, it is the same dear face 
I loved so many years ago 
Repeat Chorus 
Farewell, I think I love you yet 
As friend to friend, God bless you dear 
And guide you through these weary years 
To where the skies are always clears 
Repeat Chorus
