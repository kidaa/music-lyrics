I can see you're disappointed 
By the way you look at me 
And I'm sorry that I'm not 
The woman you thought I'd be 
Yes, I've made my mistakes 
But listen and understand 
My mistakes are no worse than yours 
Just because I'm a woman 
So when you look at me 
Don't feel sorry for yourself 
Just think of all the shame 
You might have brought somebody else 
Just let me tell you this 
Then we'll both know where we stand 
My mistakes are no worse than yours 
Just because I'm a woman 
Now a man will take a good girl 
And he'll ruin her reputation 
But when he wants to marry 
Well, that's a different situation 
He'll just walk off and leave her 
To do the best she can 
While he looks for an angel 
To wear his wedding band 
Now I know that I'm no angel 
If that's what you thought you'd found 
I was just the victum of 
A man that let me down 
Yes, I've made my mistakes 
But listen and understand 
My mistakes are no worse than yours 
Just because I'm a woman 
No, my mistakes are no worse than yours 
Just because I'm a woman
