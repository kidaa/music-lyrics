When troubles surround us, when evils come 
The body grows weak 
The spirit grows numb 
When these things beset us, God doesn't forget us 
He sends us His love 
Chorus: 
On the wings of a snow-white dove 
He sends His pure sweet love 
A sign from above 
On the wings of a dove 
When Jesus went down through the river that day 
Well, he was baptised in the usual way 
And when it was done 
God blessed His son 
He sent him His love 
On the wings of a dove 
Repeat Chorus Twice
