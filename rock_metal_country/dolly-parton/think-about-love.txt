I can't forget you 
Ever since the moment that I met you 
You've been on my mind 
And I need to somehow let you know 
That I think about you all the time 
Chorus: 
So when you think about love, think about me 
I can give you more than you'll ever need 
Sooner or later every heart needs some company 
When you think about love, think about me 
When you think about love, think about me 
We were strangers 
Now I'm already wrapped around your finger 
Oh whats a heart to do 
'Cause it lingers 
And the thought of you 
Wantin' me as much as I want you 
Repeat Chorus 
Makes me blue 
I'm not holding you tonight 
Cause only you can satisfy 
This heart of mine 
Repeat Chorus Twice
