Well I met a boy from Grassy Branch
Fine as he can be
I met him at the big barn dance
And he took a shine to me
Sky-blue eyes, a big wide smile
And tall as a sicamore tree
He's real smart with a real big heart
And he's gonna marry me
He's gonna marry me
And we're gonna go to town
We're gonna buy some real good car
And we're gonna drive around
We'll hold hands an' touch 'n' hug
He talks so sweet to me
Cause he knows a lot about love and stuff
And he's gonna marry me

His momma don't like me one little bit
But you know I don't care
Let her pitch her hissy-fit
Cause I ain't a'marryin' her
He's always been a momma's boy
It's just plain jealousy
She's as mad as an old red hen
Cause he's gonna marry me

Oh, an' he's gonna marry me
An' he's gonna buy me a ring
We're gonna be so free
Cut momma's aprin strings
He's gonna build me a pretty little house
Have a pretty little made-for-three
Cause he done kiss me on the mouth
An' he's gonna marry me

Yeah, he's gonna marry me
He's gonna buy me a ring
We're gonna be so free
Cut momma's aprin strings
He's gonna build me a pretty little house
Have a pretty little made-for-three
Cause he's done kiss me on the mouth
So he's gotta marry me
Yeah he's done kiss me on the mouth
And he's gonna marry me
