Oh have you seen my dear companion 
For he was all this world to me 
I hear he's gone to come far country 
And that he cares no more for me 
I wish I were a swallow flying 
I'd fly to a high and lonesome place 
I'd join the wild birds in their crying 
Thinking of you and your sweet face 
Oh have you seen my dear companion 
For he was all this world to me 
But now the stars have turned against me 
And he cares no more for me 
Oh when the dark is on the mountain 
And all the world has gone to sleep 
I will go down to the cold waters 
And there I'll lay me down and weep 
Oh have you seen my dear companion 
For he was all this world to me
