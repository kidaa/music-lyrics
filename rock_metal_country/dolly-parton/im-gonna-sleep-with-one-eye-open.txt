I just found out today 
The little game you play 
While I been sleepin' all my life away 
You been steppin' so they say 
Between midnight and day 
So I'm gonna sleep with one eye open from now on 
Chorus: 
From now on, all night long 
You won't have a chance 
To treat your momma wrong 
You been steppin' so they say 
Between midnight and day 
So I'm gonna sleep with one eye open from now on 
There's a honky-tonk down the road 
Just about a mile or so 
And I understand that's where you spend your time 
Baby, I got news for you 
Your little game is through 
Yeah, from now on baby 
You better tow the line 
Repeat Chorus 
You thought you were bein' smart 
Breaking my little heart 
And leavin' me to spend my time alone 
Well you'll find out today 
It just don't work that way 
You've started a little game that two can play 
From now on, all night long 
You won't have a chance 
To treat your momma wrong 
You been steppin' so they say 
Between midnight and day 
But you better sleep with one eye open from now on 
Yeah an' I'm gonna sleep with eye open from now on
