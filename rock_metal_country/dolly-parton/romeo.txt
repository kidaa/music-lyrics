A cross between a movie star 
And a hero in a book 
Romeo comes struttin' in 
And everybody looks 
'Cause he's just got that special thang 
That everybody needs 
And everybody wants him 
But not as bad as me 
Hey, Romeo, where art thou 
Get out here on the floor 
I want to dance you darlin' 
'Til you forget wherefore 
Let's two step to a new step 
We'll keep it all in line 
And we'll call this the Romeo 
'Cause you're so mighty fine 
Chorus: 
Romeo, Romeo, Romeo come dance with me 
That sexy little body 
Beats all I've ever seen 
I ain't never seen a cowboy 
Look that good in jeans 
My temperature keeps risin' 
Every time we meet 
I may not be in love 
But let me tell you 
I'm in heat 
Chorus: 
Romeo, Romeo, I just know I'll get you yet 
Romeo, Romeo, I want to be your Juliet 
So step it high, step it low 
Step it out and in 
Step to the side and let it slide 
Then steppin' up again 
Step on toes, it all goes 
Steppin' as you please 
But I'm one step away from love 
So don't step out on me 
Chorus: 
Romeo, Romeo, Romeo with the magic feet 
So step it high, step it low 
Step it out and in 
Step to the side and let it slide 
Then steppin' up again 
Step on toes, it all goes 
Steppin' as you please 
But I'm one step away from love 
So don't step out on me 
Tag: 
Romeo, Romeo 
I just know I'll get you yet 
Romeo, Romeo 
Won't you be my Juliet 
Romeo, Romeo 
Romeo, Romeo
