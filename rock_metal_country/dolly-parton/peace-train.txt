Now I've been happy lately 
Thinking about the good things to come 
And I believe it could be 
Something good has begun 
Oh, I've been smiling lately 
Dreaming about the world as one 
And I believe it could be 
Someday it's going to come 
'Cause out on the edge of darkness 
There rides a peace train 
Peace train take this country 
Come take me home again 
Now I've been smiling lately 
Thinking about the good things to come 
And I believe it could be 
Something good has begun 
Chorus: 
Peace train sounding louder 
Ride on the peace train 
Ooh-wah-ee-ah-ooh-ah 
Come on peace train 
Peace train holy roller 
Everyone jump on the peace train 
Ooh-wah-ee-ah-ooh-ah 
Come on peace train 
Get your bags together 
Go bring all your good friends, too 
'Cause it's getting nearer 
Soon it will be with you 
Now come and join the living 
It's not so far from you 
And it's getting nearer 
Soon it will all be true 
Repeat Chorus 
Now I've been crying lately 
Thinking about the world as it is 
Why must we go on hating 
Why can't we live in bliss 
'Cause out on the edge of darkness 
There rides a peace train 
Where peace train take this country 
Come take me home again 
Repeat Chorus 
Final Chorus: 
Peace train is sounding louder 
Ride on the peace train 
Ooh-wah-ee-ah-ooh-ah 
Come on peace train 
Peace train holy roller 
Jump up on the peace train 
Ride - ride on the peace train
