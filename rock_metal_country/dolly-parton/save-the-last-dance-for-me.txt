You can dance 
Every dance with the girl who gives you the eye 
Let her hold you tight 
You can smile 
Every smile for the girl who'd like to treat you right 
'Neath the pale moonlight 
But don't forget who's takin' you home 
And in who's arms you're gonna be 
Oh, darlin' save the last dance for me 
Oh I know 
That the music's fine like sparklin' wine 
Go and have your fun 
Dance and sing 
But while we're apart, don't give your heart to anyone 
Baby don't you know I love you so
Can't you feel it when we touch
I'll never ever let you go
Oh, I love you so much
And don't forget who's takin' you home 
And in who's arms you're gonna be 
Oh, darlin', save the last dance for me 
You can dance 
Go and carry on till the night is gone 
And it's time to go 
If she asks 
If you're all alone, can she take you home 
You must tell her no 
And don't forget who's takin' you home 
And in who's arms you're gonna be 
Oh, darlin', save the last dance for me 
And don't forget who's takin' you home 
And in who's arms you're gonna be 
Oh, darlin', save the last dance for me
