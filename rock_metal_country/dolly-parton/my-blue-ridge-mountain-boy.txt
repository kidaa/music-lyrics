From a shack by a mountain stream 
To a room in New Orleans 
So far from my Blue Ridge Mountain home 
The men I meet ain't warm and friendly 
Like the one in old Virginie 
Oh they ain't real like my Blue Ridge Mountain boy 
I was just a little past eighteen 
When I came to New Orleans 
I'd never been beyond my home state line 
There was a boy who loved me dearly 
But I broke his heart severely 
When I left my Blue Ridge Mountain boy 
Life was dull in my hometown 
Lights were out when the sun went down 
And I thought that city life was more my style 
But nights get lonely away from home 
And it's easy to go wrong 
The men ain't kind like my Blue Ridge Mountain boy 
New Orleans held things in store 
Things I'd never bargained for 
And every night a different man knocks on my door 
But late at night when all is still 
I can hear a whippoorwill 
As I cry for my Blue Ridge Mountain boy 
Oh but I can never go back home 
Since the boy I love is gone 
He grew tired of waiting for me to return 
They say he married last October 
But I never will get over 
Oh the sweet love of my Blue Ridge Mountain boy 
Blue Ridge Mountain boy
