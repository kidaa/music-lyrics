I thought I saw the promise of forever in your eyes 
I thought that I was sure of what I saw 
You led me to believe that I was special in your life 
So I left my heart wide open for the fall 
What a heartache you turned out to be 
Chorus: 
What a heartache, what a heartache 
Love ain't always what it appears to be 
What a heartache you turned out to be 
I thought I'd found a safe and lovin' place inside your heart 
And I was warm and willing anytime 
The same soft lips that kissed me sweet 
Were lyin' from the start 
But I swear I thought your love was genuine 
What a heartache you turned out to be 
Chorus: 
What a heartache, what a heartache 
Like a switchblade that cuts quick and deep 
Ooo, what a heartache you turned out to be 
Bridge: 
It just goes to show that you never can tell 
I really thought that I knew you well 
I still can't believe I could be deceived so easily 
Are all these wishes I'm wishin' to myself 
Like rusty coins in a wishin' well 
Wishes come true, they come false as well 
It's too late for you and me 
Oh, what a heartache, ooo, what a heart break 
Love is two-faced and easy to believe 
Chorus: 
What a heartache, ooo, what a heartache 
What a mistake to think I could believe 
Ooo, what a heartache you turned out to be 
Oh, what a heartache you turned out to be
