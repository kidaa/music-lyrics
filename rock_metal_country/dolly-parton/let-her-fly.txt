There's a wreath on the door 
She don't live here no more 
As of today, she flew home 
And we all gathered here 
In sorrow and tears 
It won't be the same with her gone 
There's a place on the hill 
That's peaceful and still 
Where she'll sleep beside daddy again 
The ole' family tree is shedding its leaves 
But we'll all met in Heaven again 
Chorus: 
Oh, she's an angel 
Let her fly, let her fly 
She's gone home to glory 
To her home in the sky 
When God sees her comin' 
Heaven's choir will smile 
And sing, ";Oh she's an angel, let her fly, let her fly 
Ooh, she's an angel, let her fly"; 
She used to rock me when I was a child 
Sing ";Rock of Ages"; and ";In The Sweet Bye And Bye"; 
Her life wasn't easy, oh but how hard she tried 
You know she's an angel, Lord, so let her fly 
Repeat Chorus

Let her fly
