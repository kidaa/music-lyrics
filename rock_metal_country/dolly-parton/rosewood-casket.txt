There's a little rosewood casket 
Resting on a marble stand 
With a packet of old love letters 
Written by my true love's hand 
Go and bring them to me, sister 
Read them o'er for me tonight 
I have often tried by could not 
For the tears that filled my eyes 
When I'm dead and in my casket 
When I gently fall asleep 
Fall asleep to wake in heaven 
Dearest sister do not weep 
Take his letters and his locket 
Place them gently on my heart 
But this golden ring that he gave me 
From my finger never part 
Repeat Chorus
