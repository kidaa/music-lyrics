Trouble, we have known trouble 
In our struggle just to get by 
Many times the burden's been heavy 
Still we carried on side by side 
Chorus: 
And when we're gone long gone 
The only thing that will have mattered 
Is the love that we shared 
And the way that we cared 
When we're gone, long gone 
And when we're walking together in glory 
Hand in hand through eternity 
It's the love that will be remembered 
Not wealth, not poverty 
Repeat Chorus
