Here you come again 
Just when I'm about to make it work without you 
You waltz right in the door 
Just like you done before 
And wrap my heart 'round your little finger 
Here you come again 
Just when I'm about to make it work without you 
You look into my eyes 
And light those dreamy eyes 
And pretty soon I'm wonderin' 
How I came to doubt you 
All you gotta do 
Is smile that smile 
And there go all my defenses 
Just leave it up to you 
And in a little while 
You're messin' up my mind 
An' fillin' up my senses 
Here you come again 
Lookin' better than a body 
Has a right to 
An' shakin' me up so 
That all I really know 
Is here you come again 
An' here I go 
All you gotta do 
Is smile that smile 
And there go all my defenses 
Just leave it up to you 
And in a little while 
You're messin' up my mind 
An' fillin' up my senses 
Here you come again 
Lookin' better than a body 
Has a right to 
An' shakin' me up so 
That all I really know 
Is here you come again 
An' here I go 
Fade: 
Here I go 
An' here I go 
An' here I go 
Here you come again 
An' here I go 
Here I go 
An' here I go
