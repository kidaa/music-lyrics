Got a crazy, restless feelin' 
I cannot be consoled 
Got an itchy urge to up and run 
I think I've lost control 
You do something to me 
Something that I really can't explain 
I ain't felt like this since I'ze a kid 
And I never thought I'd feel this much again 
Chorus: 
I've got that runaway feelin' 
Like to grab you up 
Just run off, footloose and fancy free 
Yeah, that thought's appealing 
That runaway feelin's let my feelin's run away with me 
I get all swimmy-headed everytime I look at you 
Though love has blurred my vision, I still enjoy the view 
Like Elvis and his hound dog, in a deep fog 
I keep a'runnin' after you 
I thought I'd been in love before 
But before doesn't matter anymore 
Repeat Chorus 
Ah, run with it, boys 
Repeat Chorus 
Tag: 
I've got that runaway feelin' runaway 
Runaway feelin' runaway 
Won't you run away with me
