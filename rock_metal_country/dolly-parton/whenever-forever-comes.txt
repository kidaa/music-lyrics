Whenever forever comes, when darkness shall hide the sun 
I'll still be shining with love for you 
When glory bells chime, my love will ring true 
Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my love will be yours always 
Whenever forever comes, when all things are said and done 
I'll still be feeling the same way I do 
I'll be there for you and still wanting you 
God gave you to me, and me to you 
And you will still be the one whenever forever comes 
We'll float on a cloud through eternity 
You'll gather the stars, you'll give them to me 
I'll give you the moon and we'll replace the sun 
Whenever forever comes, whenever forever comes 
What would I have ever done had I not had you to love? 
You've given me more than I ever dreamed 
Loving you more every day, so it seems 
Greater than all other loves I have seen 
Its essence will linger on whenever forever comes 
We'll float on a cloud through eternity 
You'll gather the stars, you'll give them to me 
I'll give you the moon and we'll replace the sun 
Whenever forever comes, whenever forever comes
