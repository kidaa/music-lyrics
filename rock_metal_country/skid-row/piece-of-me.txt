Sleazin' in the city
Lookin' for a fight
Got my heels and lookin' pretty
On a Saturday night, night, night

Good God, bless my soul
I need a fix of rock 'n roll
Come on baby you gotta wait and see
You better hurry 
To get a piece of me

Caught a lonely lady
Crying on a cigarette
I got nasty, nasty habits
And that's all she's gonna get 

One for the money, two for the show
So 'round and 'round and 'round we go
Take a look at what-a you might need
You better hurry 
To get a piece of me

I don't have looks, I don't have money
But I know one thing's for sure
One night ain't enough of my love
She wanted more, more, more

Sleazin' in the city
Lookin' for a fight
Got my heels and lookin' pretty
On a Saturday night, night, night

One for the money, two for the show
So 'round and 'round and 'round we go
Take a look at what-a you might need
You better hurry
To get a piece of me
To get a piece of me
