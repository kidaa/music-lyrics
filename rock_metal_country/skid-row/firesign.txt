Bach, Bolan, Hill, Snake
Sailing ships go through my mind
Past wreckage on the way
Glory seekers fall in line
Getting closer
Summer laugh, some will cry
What will summer bring !
Some will take her by the reins
And ride the suffering

Bridge
On a carousel through my yesterdays
Doubt sees the obstacles
Faith sees the way
Repeat 2x

Chorus
All the ways you kill me
Theyve begun to thrill me
Nothing there fulfills my firesign
Brotherhood betrayal,
Sabotage to no avail
Nothing there can kill my firesignBeaten, burned, Ill take the fall
And get up right in your face
Walk all over what I believe
But Im still here, you disappear
Without a trace
No need to follow, no need to lead
No need to leg or borrow
I just need to be me

Repeat Bridge 2x

Repeat Chorus 2x
