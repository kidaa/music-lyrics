Snake
What was it you once said
That there would be things in life that couldnt be
Not for a second did I believe you
Not for a minute did I believe that

Within your need you lie alone
This empty space you call your home

Chorus
If you just let me in
I wouldnt let you break down
Im breaking down

As if you thought the rain could wash away the day
And could heal you
Not for a second did I believe it
Not for a minute did I believe thatWithin your need you lie alone
This empty space you call your home

Repeat Chorus 2x

What was it you once said
That there would be things in life that couldnt be
Not for a second did I believe you
Not for a minute did I believe that

Repeat Chorus 2x
