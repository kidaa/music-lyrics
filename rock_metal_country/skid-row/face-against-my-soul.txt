Affuso, Bach, Bolan, Snake
How can I see tomorrow if you keep me in the dark
When will I see forever if you damn me from the start
There must be a way to get through to your
Blackened heart

You build a wall inside a wall and theres no door

Chorus
Lay your body by the water
Press your face against my soul
Wading through all your convictions
We can come in from the coldSearching greener pastures, finding desert sands
Cycles on the treadmill turn up empty hands
Do I have to bloodlet just to get another chance

Inside of you theres a view that sees me there

Repeat Chorus
