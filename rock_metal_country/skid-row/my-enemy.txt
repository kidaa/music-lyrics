Affuso, Bolan, Hill
Play the fence, one way youre gonna fall
Sometimes I dont know who you are at all
Your opinion is something that youve got inside
But I see the loyalty has up and died

Your skeletons
My skeletons
Life is only getting shorter

You can be my enemy and I dont care
Keep throwin stones at yourself

Stories run in circles that have no end
I hit on luck, then you bum me out again
Theres a way that you keep the truth in check
Scratch the surface and treat it like a broken neckKeep the peace when face to face with the scene
Got a hunch that aint what you really mean
Weathers fair, does that change where you stand ?
My back is turned and the knife is in your hand

Your genocide
My genocide
Like is only getting shorter

You can be my enemy and I dont care
Keep throwin stones at yourself
You can be my enemy and I dont care
You try too hard and I can tell
