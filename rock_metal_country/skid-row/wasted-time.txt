Sebastian Bach/Rachel Bolan/Snake
You and I together in our lives
Saacred ties would never fray
Then why can I let myself tell lies
And watch you die every day

I think back  to the times
When dreams were what mattered
Tough talking you naivete

Yo said you never let me down
But the horse stampedes and rages
In the name of desperation

Chorus:
Is it all just wasted time
Can you look at yourself
When you think of what
You left behind
Is it all just wasted time
Can you live with yourself
When you think of what
You left behind

Paranoid delusions they haunt you
Where's my friend I used to know
He's all alone
He's buried deep within a carcass
Searching for a soul

Caan you feel me inside your heart
As it's bleeding
Why can't you believe you can't be lovedI hear you scream in agony
And the horse stampedes and rages
In the name of desperation

Chorus

You saaid you never let me down
But the horse stampedes, it rages
In the name of desperation

Chorus

The sun will rise again
The earth will turn to sand
Creation's colors seem  to fade to grey
And you'll see the sicklly hands of time
Wil write your final rhyme
and end a memory

I never thought you'd let it get this far, boy
