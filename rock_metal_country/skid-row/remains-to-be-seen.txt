Bolan, Hill, Snake
Shy a quarters headroom 
I saw the
Half-moon was burning down
Play with your reflection cause
An infection is going around

Dive head-on into me,
Dive head-on into me,
Dive head-on into me,
Dive head-on into me.

Meet my neighbors widow, a black and
Bluedoe, shes up a tree
Trip, the lightning spastic
Captain Fantastic.  The nineteen seventiesDive head-on into me,
Dive head-on into me,
Dive head-on into me,
Dive head-on into me.

Bury the news with the views from behind the door
Rattle the bones with the drones at the 
Corner store -- see them for myself

Commies, kinks and masochists
Weirdos, love and homicide
Witches, freaks and 45s
Kick a painted pony let the spinning wheel ride
