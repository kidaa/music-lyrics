Bolan, Snake3:10
She blew my mind behind the wrecking machine
She was a shitload of trouble called the Subway Queen
Had a hip with bad habits and a shake that was a bit obscene

One night I caught her running out the cellar door
There was about a million people lying flat on the floor
For such a sweet little lady I would swear she's rotten to the core

She got her hands in the cookie jar
Smiling like an alligator
Makin' headlines in the back of her car
Tight-lipped now but sink ships later

I know a thing or two about -- sweet little sister
Her mama kill her if she knew what she do -- sweet little sister
She'll love ya black and blue -- sweet little sister
Mona Lisa with a new tattoo
She's my sweet little -- sweet little sister 

Every quittin' time is another disease
Too many cowboys ridin' high shootin' low at the knees
The back hand boogie is the price you pay for being the squeeze

The pettin's getting heavy got her tongue in her ear
her friend is doing time for kickin' ass on a queer
They're in a mental state and all their friends are here

She's tellin' lies through her burgundy lips
Angel on a mission of mercy
She'll get you dancin' with the crack of her whip
Take you up to heaven in her rocket ship

I know a thing or two about -- sweet little sister
Her mama kill her if she knew what she do -- sweet little sister
She'll love ya black and blue -- sweet little sister
Mona Lisa with a new tattoo
She's my sweet little -- sweet little sister 

She got her hands in the cookie jar smiling like an alligator
Makin' headlines in the back of her car
Tight-lipped now but sink ships later

I know a thing or two about -- sweet little sister
Her mama kill her if she knew what she do -- sweet little sister
She'll love ya black and blue -- sweet little sister
Mona Lisa with a new tattoo
She's my sweet little -- sweet little sister
