Bolan, Snake3:10
Six foot one and lonely
Dressed in spaghetti rags
Standing at the bus stop
With her alligator bags

What can u do?
No, no, no, what can I do
I better see a doctor
'Cause I think I'm getting hooked on you

I ain't much for talkin'
But all I got to say is

Here I am
Close your eyes and I'll be Superman
Here I am
Come and take my lovin' while you can

She broke a million hearts
On 2nd Avenue
With her German cigarettes
And designer attitude

What can u do?
No, no, no, what can I do
My love's been goin' blind
Since the first time I laid eyes on you

Ain't much for conversation
But I got to let you know

Here I am
Close your eyes and I'll be Superman
Here I am
Come and take my lovin' while you can

You don't need a crystal ball
To see she's got it all

Here I am
Close your eyes and I'll be Superman
Here I am
