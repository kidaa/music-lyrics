Caught the mother jack knifin
A little bit low lifin
Goin twenty paces with the medicine man
Runnin from the girl in pigskin
A little gun shy but shootin
Hidin in the kitchen with his head in his hand

Bleed, me -- why cant you say what you mean ?

Chorus
How far has it gone, it didnt take you long
To put your hand in the medicine jar
In your private hell, now youve found yourself
In the hands of the medicine jar

Sittin here with all your bitchin
Cookin up a new addiction
Prayin that the light of day aint wakin the dead
Droppin like a bomb on Hiro
Shakin like San Francisco
Only to be diggin out to do it again

Bleed, me -- why cant you say what you mean ?

Repeat Chorus

Make it go away, make it go a--way

Caught the mother jack knifin
A little bit of low lifin
Goin twenty paces with the medicine man
Droppin like the bomb on Hiro
Shakin like San Francisco
Hidin in the jungle with your head in the sand

Repeat Chorus 2x

One step from bein free, what did you think
Youd see at the bottom of the medicine jar
