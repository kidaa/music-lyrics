Bolan, Hill, Snake
Jesus knows my story, he kows the position that Im in
A hooker knows the feeling to get fucked the way Ive been
Turn my insides out; your mouth drank my water

Chorus
You look at me like Im subhuman
You talk to me like Im subhuman
Youre treating me like Im subhuman
Youre jumping into the subhuman race

Brothers hear my story, but dont take no pity out on me
A soldier knows the feeling to get pushed out in a field
Taking liberties; burned by your dictation

Repeat Chorus
