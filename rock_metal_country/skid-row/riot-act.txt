I never wanted to be President
'Cause it's nothin' but an ego trip
I didn't want your education
'Cause it's nothin' but a pile of shit

You bore me to death so shut up for
God's sake

Stop readin' me the riot act
While my brains are still intact
You say it's raining, but you're pissin' down my back
So stop readin' me the riot act

I couldn't listen to a word you said
This goin' nowhere thing is wearin' thin
When your sex, your drugs and your valedic'
Is just the spit I wipe off my chin

I'd rather go nowhere than not know where it's at

Stop readin' me the riot act
While my brains are still intact
You say it's raining, but you're pissin' down my back
So stop readin' me the riot actI never wanted to be President
'Cause it's nothin' but an ego trip, yeah
I didn't want your education
'Cause it's nothin' but a pile of shit

You bore me to death so shut up for
God's sake

Stop readin' me the riot act
While my brains are still intact
You say it's raining, but you're pissin' down my back
So stop readin' me the riot act

Stop readin' me the riot act
While my brains are still intact
You say it's raining, but you're pissin' down my back
So stop readin' me the riot act
