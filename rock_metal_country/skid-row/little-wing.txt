Well she's walking
Trough the clouds
With a circus mind
That's running wild
Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams and
  fairytales
That's all she ever thinks about
Riding with the wind

Oh, when i'm sad
She comes to me
With a thousand smiles
She gives to me free

It's alright she said
It's alright
Take anything you want from me
Anything..
