Bolan, Snake
Slowly I heat the love thats found its way
Onto another path in times of change
Crossing a bridge unknown
Hoping our strength will hold 
Should they both let go then let me lay
... Let me lay

Chorus
Show me a sign
To a light that shines
One direction into another
Sheltered peace of mineSomewhere I lost a piece of memory
Somehow I know my legs will carry me
Searching for circles end
Hoping the wounds will mend
Should this scar, then it was meant to be

Repeat Chorus 3x
