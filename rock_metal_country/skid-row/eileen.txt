Affuso, Bach, Bolan, Snake
There are things we cannot see that hang
Within her sight
There are people we wont remember that
Dance with her at night

Chorus
Eileens calling me
To sit awhile and talk to trees
Eileen cant you see
The songs you sing are scaring me

Eileen, EileenShe romances with the moon
Full and alone
Its really a street light
Its something we all know

Repeat Chorus
