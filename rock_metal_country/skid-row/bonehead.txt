Bolan, Snake
Is there a problem ? The laugh of the rich man
Has got you crying poor
Are you as heavy as hell in a handbag
Or just a virgin whore ?
If the weight of the world is on your shoulders
Then carry it for a day
Do you try for peace or peace of mine;
Is reality in the way ?

Enter the martyr out through the in door
The savior has arrived ?
Is all your anger force of habit
And keeping you alive ?
An empty shotgun shooting your mouth off
Somethings on your mind
The cheap messiah of persecution
Is alive and doing fine

Chorus
I wont leave if you stay, I dont buy what you say
If youre a new God let me see a miracle
I wont leave if you stay, I dont buy what you say
I cant say that youre a fool, but if youre a new God let me see a miracle.
