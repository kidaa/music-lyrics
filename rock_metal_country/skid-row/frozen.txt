Bolan, Snake
As I stare into the fire
All my thoughts go up in flames
Here I stare into the fire
Ill be waiting on the rain

The box I keep myself in, closes out my air
So I build a fire, so I can sit and stare

Chorus
Can it be Im frozen
Can it be Im frozen
Can it be Im frozen
Can it be Im frozen

As I stare into the weather
My eyes drying from the cold
As I stare into the weather
I sense my thoughts growing old

Repeat ChorusI listen to the prophets predict the stem of tides
I stare into the weather thats keeping me inside

Repeat Chorus

As I stare into the fire
Will the prophets change my mind
While I stare into the fire
All the colors treat me kind

Ill dust away the fallings the winter leaves for me
Ill stare into the fire and set tomorrow free

Repeat Chorus
