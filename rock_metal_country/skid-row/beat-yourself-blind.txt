Bach, Bolan, Hill, Snake
Give a minute cause Im wrapped in superstitution
Pour me a chemical to take away the edge
Dont make up anything thats breaking all your fingers
Just slap around a bit of what it takes to pledge

Carry out another stone as a slave
Ask general-know-it-all Whos juggling the earth ?-
Tease all the natives that will walk across your grave
And shove aside your nation all for what its worth

Chorus
Beat yourself blind Repeat 6x
An open eyes and a closed mind

Look at the suit in suspended animation
A faded outline that used to be a man
A piece of paper thats fallen out a window
Has got a better chance to know where it will land

Repeat Chorus

To bleed in vain, to bleed in vain -- under my eyes are painted skies
Down at the boneyard, theyre diggin up the relics
Handfuls or parasites thrown into machines
I got the phone call theyre tearin down the mission
The zombies had a ball, but dont know what it means

Beat yourself blind
