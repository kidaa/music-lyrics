[ALL] Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel...
Born is the king of Israel

[JC] The first Noel
The angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields where they lay
In fields where they
Lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep

[JC   ALL] Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel...
Born is the king of Israel

[JUSTIN] They look...ed up 
And saw a star
Shining in the east beyond and far
And to the Earth
It gave great light
And so it continued both day and night

[JUSTIN   ALL] Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel...
Born is the king of Israel

[JC] ?Despite...the light...of that same star
Three wise men came from country far 
[JUSTIN] To seek for the king was their intent
And to follow that star wherever it went

[JC   ALL] Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel...
Born is the king of Israel
Born is the king of Israel
