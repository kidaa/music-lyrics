[CHRIS] Feel the magic in the air
Christmas is all around
It's something about this special time of year
A blanket of snow falls
Down from the sky
Voices of angels
Open our hearts so we can open our arms

[JC] And we'll all join hands to celebrate the goodness
That shines inside of everyone

[JC] I must have been a part of some grand design
Guess it's Christmas time...

[CHRIS   JOEY] See the face of the little boys and girls
Singing their first noel
A sweet refrain heard all around the world
A song of forgiveness
Comforting peace
A time to remember
What life really means life really means
The important things important things...

[JC] And we'll all join hands to celebrate the goodness
That shines inside of everyone

[JC] I must have been a part of some grand design
Guess it's Christmas time...
Guess it's Christmas time...

[CHRIS] Open our hearts so we can open our arms

[JC] And we'll all join hands to celebrate the goodness
That shines inside of everyone

[JC] I must have been a part of some grand design
Guess it's Christmas time...

[JC] I must have been a part of some grand design
Guess it's Christmas time...

[JC- very softly spoken] Merry Christmas
