I never believed in dreaming
It never got me very far
I never believed that love could find me
Like an arrow through the heart
I never believed in miracles
Or building castles in the air
Not until that day I found you
Turned around and you were there

From the day you came 
You gave me a whole new point of view
I've been touched by an angel
It's impossible but true

I believe in you
I swear that forever from today
No one will ever take your place
I believe in you 
I believe in you - oh yeah
And I believe our love will last 
Always Oh yeah

I never believed in fairytales
Though sometimes I wish I could
I never believed that golden slippers 
Could ever find the perfect foot
I never believed in magic
Or that wishes could come true
But your very first kiss
Changed all this
Something only you could do - yeah

You made me a believer
You made me trust again
You showed me there's a pot of gold
In every rainbow's end

I believe in you I believe in you 
I swear that forever from today
No one will ever take your place
No, no, no, no no
I believe in you I believe in you
And I believe our love will last 
Always Always yeah

Only love Only love
Sets you free
And if it's up to fate
Then you're my destiny Yeah

Now I know Now I know
Now I see
Anything can happen Anything
If you just believe

I believe in you I believe in you, baby
I believe in you, baby
I swear to forever from today 
Forever - Forever
No one will ever take your place
No one's gonna take your place
I believe in you 
I believe in you, baby - I believe in you
And I believe our love will last 
Believe our love will last - Will last
Always Oh ohhh
I believe in you I believe in you
I swear to forever from today 
I swear - I swear - Forever
No one will ever take your place
No one's gonna take your place
I believe in you 
I believe - I believe in you
And I believe our love will last 
Is gonna last - is gonna last - is gonna last
Always Oh ohhh

I believe in you I believe in you, baby
I believe in you - Believe yeah
I swear to forever from today
Forever - Forever
No one will ever take your place
No one's gonna take your place
I believe in you

Can you believe - Can you believe
And I believe our love will last 
Always.
