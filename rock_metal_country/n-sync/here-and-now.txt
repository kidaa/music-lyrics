Here and now
Is the way I live
Unafraid of what life gives 
And there've been times in my life 

I couldn't see the difference
In pain, or in joy
Or in sun, or in rain
It just seemed the same 

But I'm only human
Rendered by ambition
But I'm going to make it count 

Here and now
Is the way I live
With an open heart and mind
Here and now 

So many intentions
In life I could have followed 

But one of those paths must lead to eternal love 
Here and now
Is the way I live
Unafraid of what life gives
Respect things I don't understand 
All Here and now
So many intentions
In life I could have followed
But one of those paths must lead to eternal love

Here and now 
Here and now
