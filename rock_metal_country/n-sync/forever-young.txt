Forever Young... 
Let us live eternally 
We can reach our desting 
We will feast in harmony as one, forever young 
Though they teach us sacrifice 
We weill never compromise 
We are here until our work is done, forever young 
Forever Young... 
Whatever may come falling down 
Will never break our solid ground 
A million hours until the game is won, forever young 
Until we're learned what love can bring 
Well our immortal voice will ring 
And through the clouds we'll always find the sun, 
Forever young 
Forever Young... 
We're the future of the world 
With love let's take our stand 
For all that we believe, forever ever young 
Forever Young...
