Operator

Uhh, yeah
I'll, I'll, I'll never stop

I don't know
Do you believe me
After all that's said and done
All the lies
How I regret them baby now

I am the loser
And you're shinin' like the sun
Tell me why can't I still be the one, alright

[Chorus]
I will never stop until you're mine
I can wait forever till the end of time
'Cause my heart is in your hands
Don't you understand
I'll never stop

I'll never stop

How could I ever 
When my heart is in your hands
And I know
Baby there is no turnin' back

You'll say that I'm crazy
And I kind of understand
How I wish for this lament to end
Oh, yes
[Chorus]

Yeah, I'll, I'll, I'll never stop

Girl you believe me
And my heart is in your hands
Don't you understand
I'll never stop

I will never stop ohh
Till the end of time I can wait forever
Always in your hands my heart is in your hands
[Chorus]

Please, hang up and try your call again
Please, hang up, this is a recording
