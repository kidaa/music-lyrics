When the visions around you 
Bring tears to your eyes 
And all that surrounds you 
Are secrets and lies 

I'll be your strength 
I'll give you hope 
Keepin' your faith when it's gone 
The one you should call 
When you're standing here all alone 

Chorus: 
And I will take 
You in my arms 
And hold you right where you belong 
Til the day my life is through 
This I promise you 
This I promise you 

I've loved you forever 
In lifetimes before 
And I promise you never 
Will you hurt anymore 

I give you my word 
I give you my heart 
This is a battle we've won 
And with this vow 
Forever has now begun 

Just close your eyes 
Each loving day 
And know this feeling won't go away 
Til the day my life is through 
This I promise you 
This I promise you 

Over and over I fall, Over and over I fall 
When I hear you call, 
Without you in my life baby, 
I just wouldn't be livin' at all 

Chorus 

Just close your eyes 
Each loving day 
And know this feeling won't go away 
Every word I say is true 
This I promise you 

Every word I say is true 
This I promise you 
I promise you
