Yeah yeah.. oh hmm I don't know how
I don't know why
But girl it seems
You've touched my life
You're in my dreams
You're in my heart
I'm by myself 
When we're apart

Something strange has come over me
A raging wind across my seas
And girl you know that your eyes are to blame
And what am I supposed to do
If I can't get over you
I come to find that you don't feel the same

Cause I'm fallen 
Girl I'm fallen for you
And I pray your fallen too
I've been fallen fallen
Ever since the moment I laid eyes on you

I loose my step
I loose my ground
I loose my self
When you're around
I'm holding on for my life
To keep from drowning in your eyes
Girl what have you done to me 
To make me fall so desperately
To think that I don't even know name
No, no
How am I supposed to live 
If I can't get over this
You decide you don't feel the same

Cause I'm fallen fallen
Girl I'm fallen for you
And I pray your fallen too
I've been fallen fallen

Will you stay or will you go
Heaven, heaven knows what my future holds
Questions, questions linger on my mind
Day break from day break to dark of night
I'm fallen I don't know what's come over me

Can't you see that I'm fallen fallen
Girl I'm fallen for you
And I pray your fallen too
I've been fallen fallen
Ever since the moment I laid eyes on you
