Baby, baby we can do all that we want 
We get nasty, nasty 
We get freaky dicky, uh, uh, uh 
Baby, baby we can do more than just talk 
Cuz I can hear ya, hear ya 
And I can see ya, see ya, uh, uh 
Baby, baby, we can do all that we want 
We get nasty, nasty 
We get freaky dicky, freaky dicky 

[Chorus:] 
Digital, digital get down 
Just you and me 
We may be twenty thousand miles away 
But I can see ya 
And baby, baby you can see me 
Digital, digital get down 
Just what we need 
If we can get together naturally 
Than we can, we can get together on the digital screen 

Everytime I'm sittin' home alone, girl 
I can't wait to get you on the phone, girl 
So pick it up, baby 
I can see everything you do 
I love the things you do for me so late at night 
You turn me on, baby 
It's like I'm right there next to you, yeah 

[Bridge:] 
Can we get connected 
I need some love and affection, baby 
I'll call you on the phone 
I hope that I get through 
If you're in the mood and I'm not home 
Here's what you do, leave a message 
You know the kind I like to get back to 

[Repeat Chorus] 

I lose my mind just when you're speakin' 
I see you on the screen I get to freakin' 
So get down, baby 
And I'll get down for you 
I get so excited when I'm watchin', girl 
I can't wait to see you touch your body, girl 
It's just me and you 
So we can do what we gotta do 

[Repeat Bridge] 

[Repeat Chorus] 

Digital, digital, digital, digital get down, get down 
Digital, digital, digital, digital get down, get down

Baby, baby we can do more than just talk

Baby, baby we can do all that we want 
We get nasty, nasty

Baby, baby we can do more than just talk 
Cuz I can hear ya, hear ya 
And I can see ya, see ya, uh, uh
