If I'm not the one you want
Take your time to figure out
I'm starin' at your picture every night
The sight of you still lingers in my mind
I wonder if you're lonely, feel alright
And the sun has come out of the clouds
And sometimes when I listen to our song
The nights seem so long & far too long
I wanna call you up cause in the end
I'll keep writing letters to my garbage can
[Hook]
Lately feels like I'm goin crazy
Baby Come and lay down beside me
[Chorus]
If I'm not the one you want who's she
Take your time to figure out and you'll see
If I'm not the one you want baby
I'll be the one you need

It fells like on you I can depend
I wish I could turn back the hands of time
Enough of building castles in the sand
Why can't we be forever
[Hook]
[Chorus]
