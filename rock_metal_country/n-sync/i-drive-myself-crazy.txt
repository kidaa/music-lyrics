Lying in your arms 
So close together 
Didn't know just what I had 
Now I toss and turn 
'Cause I'm without you 
Now I'm missing you so bad 
Where was my head? 
Where was my heart? 
Now I cry alone in the dark 

I lie awake, I drive myself crazy 
Drive myself crazy thinking of you 
Made a mistake when I let you go baby 
I drive myself crazy wanting you 
The way that I do... 

I was such a fool 
I couldn't see it 
Just how good you were to me 
You confessed your love, undying devotion 
I confessed my need to be free 
And now I'm left with all this pain 
I've only got myself to blame 

I lie awake, I drive myself crazy 
Drive myself crazy thinking of you 
Made a mistake when I let you go baby 
I drive myself crazy wanting you 
The way that I do... 

Why didn't I know it? 
How much I love you baby 
Why couldn't I show it? 
If I had only known 
When I had the chance 
Oh, I had the chance 

I lie awake, I drive myself crazy 
Drive myself crazy thinking of you 
Made a mistake when I let you go baby 
I drive myself crazy wanting you 
The way that I do...
