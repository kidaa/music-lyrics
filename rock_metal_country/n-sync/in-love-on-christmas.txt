Christmas time
Is so special
When you're kissing me
Under the mistletoe
Exchanging love and gifts
Sitting in front of the tree
Me holding you
And you holding me

We'll share
I've prayed
To be loved
On Christmas
Because Christmas love gives me that feelin'
We'll share
I've prayed
To be loved
On Christmas
Because everybody should be in love with somebody on Christmas

Last year, Christmas
It happened without us
I was all mixed up and confused
I didn't know what to do, baby
I never thought I'd feel this way
I always thought Christmas was a happy day
I always prayed that Santa'd pack love on a sleigh and send it my way

We'll share
I've prayed
To be loved
On Christmas
Because Christmas love gives me that feelin'
We'll share
I've prayed
To be loved
On Christmas
Because everybody should be in love with somebody on Christmas

What a beautiful time it is
A time to open gifts
And play with all the kids
Yes it's Christmas
Yes it's Christmas time again
Girl I love you
Yes I love you
It's Christmas time again
To be loved
On Christmas
Girl I love you baby
Yes I love you baby
What a beautiful time it is
A time to open gifts
Yes now it's Christmas time
Now I am yours and you are mine
Oh when you kissing me
Right under my Christmas tree
Baby come close to me
'Cause this is how it should be

We'll share
I've prayed
To be loved
On Christmas
Because Christmas love gives me that feelin'
We'll share
I've prayed
To be loved
On Christmas
Because everybody should be in love with somebody on Christmas
