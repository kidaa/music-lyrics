[JUSTIN] It's that time of year
Christmas is here
Everybody's back together again
Speading the joy
Spreading good cheer
Toasting to another year's end
So thankful for
All of our friends...oooh...

[CHRIS] When the party is over
The night's just begun
I promise the best part is
Yet to come

[JUSTIN] We slow dance together
Two become one
That's what we've waited all day for...

[ALL] No one else but me and you
Nothing I would rather do
Than hold you all through the night under my tree
Bring along the mistletoe
Keep the music nice and low
I'll show you how good it could be...
I wish that Santa could be here to see

[JUSTIN] It's beautiful under my tree...

[JC] The fire's aglow
We've got Nat King Cole
Singing us a song from his heart
Sleigh bells and snow
Makes us feel close to the stars...

[JC]When the carols are sung
And the fire has died
The ember still burns with the love in our eyes
Cherish the moments
Savor the nights
That's what we've waited all day for...

[ALL] No one else but me and you
Nothing I would rather do
Than hold you all through the night under my tree under my tree...
Bring along the mistletoe
Keep the music nice and low
I'll show you how good it could be...
I wish that Santa could be here to see

[JC] It's beautiful under my tree...

[JUSTIN] No one but me
No one but you
Sweet rendevous
under my tree...
No one but me
No one but you heyyeah...

[ALL   JC] When the party is over party is over
The night's just begun night's just begun...
I promise the best part is
Yet to come

[JC] We slow dance together
Two become one
That's what we've waited all day for...waited all day for

[ALL] No one else but me and you
Nothing I would rather do
Than hold you all through the night under my tree whoooa...under my tree...yeah
Bring along the mistletoe
Keep the music nice and low
I'll show you how good it could be...
I wish that Santa could be here to see
I wish that Santa could be here to see

[ALL] ooooohhh...No one else but me and you
Nothing I would rather do
Than make all your dreams come through under my tree under my tree...
Such a closing rendevous closing rendevous...
Just relax enjoy the view
I'll show you how good it could be...
I wish that Santa could be here to see

[ALL] It's beautiful...beautiful...beautiful...under my tree...

It's that time of year
Christmas is here...yeah, yeah, yeah

Filled with laughter and cheer...
