That's the way love goes... 

Ooh.. that's the way, ooh ohh.. 
Ooh.. 

Like a moth to a flame 
Burned by the fire 
My love is blind 
Can't you see my desire? 

That's the way love goes 
My love is blind, can't you see my desire? 

That's the way, that's the way, that's way love goes.. 

Don't mind if I light candles 
I like to watch us play and 
Baby, you've got on what I like 
That's the way... 
Come closer baby, closer 
Reach out and feel my body 
I'm gonna give you all my love 
that's the way love goes 

Oh sugar, don't you hurry 
You've got me here all night 
Just close your eyes and hold on tight baby, hold on tight 
Oh baby, don't stop, don't stop 
Go deeper baby deeper 
You feel so good I'm gonna cry cry.. 
Oh I'm gonna take you there 

That's the way love goes 
That's the way love goes 
that's the way.. that's the way... 
That's the way love goes 

That's the way love goes ooh! 
That's the way love goes... 
That's the way love goes 
That's the way love goes 
That's the way love, that's the way love.. 

That's the way love goes
