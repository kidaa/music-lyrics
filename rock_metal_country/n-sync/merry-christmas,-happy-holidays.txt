When the snow is glistening on the trees outside
And all the stockings are hung by the fireside
Waiting for Santa to arrive...

Cause everybody knows
It's Christmas time, and
All the kids will see
The gifts under the tree
It's the best time of year for the family

Feel the love in the room from the floor to the ceiling
It's that time of year

And with the blessings from above
God sends you his love
And everything's okay
Merry Christmas, happy holidays
