Baby you're not the only one...
Oh oh oh yeah
Hey yeah

[JC:]
I see the things he does to you
All the pain that he puts you through
And I see what's really going on
Staying out at night while you're by the phone

Take it from me
It's a lesson to be learned
Even the good guys get burned
Take it from me
See I would give you love
The kind of love that you've only dreamed of
Baby you're not the only one
You don't have to be afraid to fall in love
And I know that you've hurt in the past
But if you want it, here's my heart
No strings attached

[Justin:]
He doesn't give you the kind of attention
That a girl like you needs that a girl like you needs
Cause he always looks around
His eyes wander 'round
He doesn't see you like I see

Take it from me
It's a lesson to be learned
Even the good guys get burned
Take it from me
Baby I would give you love
The kind of love that you've only dreamed of yeah
Baby you're not the only one baby you're not the only one
You don't have to be afraid to fall in love to fall in love
And I know that you've hurt in the past hurt in the past
But if you want it, here's my heart here's my heart
No strings attached

Take it from me
[JC:] It's a lesson to be learned
Even the good guys get burned
Take it from me
[JC & Justin:] See I would give you love
The kind of love that you've only dreamed of
[JC:] So if you want to take a chance with me ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

If you baby take a chance with me
I'll be everything you need everything you need
Because it's our destiny

[Mixing of chorus and "If you...take a chance with me"]

Baby you're not the only one baby you're not the only one
You don't have to be afraid to fall in love you don't have to be afraid
And I know that you've hurt in the past know that you're hurting
But if you want it, here's my heart if you want here's my heart
No strings attached
