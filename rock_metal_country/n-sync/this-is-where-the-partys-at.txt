Yeah,
This is Where the Party's At
this is where the party's at
C'mon babe... this is where the party's at..

Monday morning to Friday afternoon
It's stressing you out
But tonight, the weekend comes around
and it's time to break out

Everyone needs some time, 
Time to get away
Then it can free your mind
and free your soul

This is you night to shine 
if you want to play
Baby Its ok to lose control now

If you wanna groove now
This is where the party's at
Gotta make you move now
This is where the party's at
Everybody's gettin in the zone
This is where the party's at
Everybody, c'mon
This is where the party's at

Tonight we'll make you groove
Forget your problems
Forget all your fears
Whatever you wish
Your secret fantasies
We'll take you there

Throw all your hands up high 
So that I can see 
Dance like you just don't care 
Raise you hands - Let's raise the roof 
Whatever you want to try It's all good with me no, no 
It's all good with me 
There ain't nothing you can't do now 

If you wanna groove now
This is where the party's at
Gotta make you move now
This is where the party's at
Everybody's gettin in the zone
This is where the party's at
Everybody, c'mon
This is where the party's at

Everything that you been missing in your life
You can find inside the song
And that's all that really matters tonight..
So let's party all night long

C'mon now
Pump it up
To the left
Pump it up 
now to the right
Pump it up
Everybody
Pump it up
C'mon
Pump it up hold it up
pump it up let me see ya
Pump it up here we go
Pump it up

[repeat x3:]
If you wanna groove now
This is where the party's at
Gotta make you move now
This is where the party's at
Everybody's gettin in the zone
This is where the party's at
Everybody, c'mon
This is where the party's at

This is Where the party's at..
