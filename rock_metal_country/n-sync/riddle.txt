What's the riddle of it all 
What's the riddle on her mind 
I't impossible to find 
I am out to find the solving key 
To this woman's mystery 
I need to see her more than I dream her 
More than two secret eyes 
What is going on what is going on in her life 
What is showing up what is showing up in her smile 
What's the riddle of it all 
What's the riddle on her mind 
It's impossible to find 
What's the riddle of it all 
What's the riddle on her mind 
It's impossible to find 
She, she breezes in, yes I can win 
It seems I conquer all my soul 
So I can reach her heart cause she's 
Too far from being touched 
What is going on what is going on in her life 
What is showing up what is showing up in her smile 
*Chorus* 
I am only scared from wonder 
From delirious I'm running 
Tell me where's this source of magic 
This hide and seek makes me an addict 
*Chorus*
