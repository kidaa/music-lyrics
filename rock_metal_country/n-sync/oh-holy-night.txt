various ooohs and ahhhs
Oh holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
aah...oooh
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till he appear'd and the soul felt its worth.
The thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night...divine
Oh night when Christ was born
Oh holy night
Oh night divine
Oh holy night
Oh night divine

The thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night...divine
Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine
Oh night divine

Oh holy night
Oh night divine

Oh holy night when Christ was born
holy night when Christ was born
