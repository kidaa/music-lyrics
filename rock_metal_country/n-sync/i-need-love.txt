I just tell you how I feel
I just wanna have a love that's real
How can I stop this burning desire 

I can see that you are the one for me
You're the only one I really need
I need a love that burns like a fire 

All I wanna do is give it a chance
Everybody needs a true romance
I would give anything to be with you 

I will give you all the love you need
If you only give your love to me
What would I do if I were without you 

I need love
You need love
We all really need love 

All I want
All I need
We all really need love
