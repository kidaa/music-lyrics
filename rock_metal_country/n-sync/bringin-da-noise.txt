Bringin' da noise
Bring down the house
We came here to turn the party out 
Say come on, come on
Let's raise the roof 
And give `em proof
That we can get loose ya'll

[JC:]
We need to get down
The scene is set so right
Everybody's in the house tonight tonight
Lose your mind
Let your body take control control
You've got to feel it in your soul in your soul

I've got that feeling baby
You know it drives me crazy
And all I wanna do is hit the floor
I wanna shout it ya'll
So make it louder ya'll
[JC:]
And turn it up some more

[repeat x2:]
Bringin' da noise
Bring down the house
We came here to turn the party out 
Say come on, come on
Let's raise the roof 
And give `em proof
That we can get loose ya'll

Bringin' da noise
Bringin' da noise

[JC:]
Just shake it girl shake it girl
And enjoy the ride
Do what you feel inside
Cause it's your world..
All you want and more
So baby go and get yours get yours

I've got that feeling baby
You know it drives me crazy
And all I wanna do is hit the floor
I wanna shout it ya'll shout
So make it louder ya'll loud
And turn it up some more more more more

[repeat x2:]
Bringin' da noise
Bring down the house
We came here to turn the party out 
Say come on, come on
Let's raise the roof 
And give `em proof
That we can get loose ya'll

Bringin' da noise

You know it drives me crazy
And all I wanna do is hit the floor

We came here to turn the party out 
Say come on, come on
Let's raise the roof 
And give `em proof
That we can get loose ya'll
