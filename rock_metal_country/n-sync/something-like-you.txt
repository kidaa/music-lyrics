So many times I thought I hold it in my hands
but just like grains of sand
love slipped through my fingers
so many nights I asked the Lord above 
Please make me lucky enough to find a love that lingers
Something keeps telling me that you could be my answered prayer
you must be heaven sent, I swear
cuz...

Something happens when you look at me I forget to speak
something happens when you kiss my mouth my knees get so weak
could it be true is this what God has meant for me
cuz baby I can't believe...that something like you could happen to me

yeah yeah...something like you

Girl in your eyes I feel your fire burn
oh your secrets I will learn
even if it takes forever
with you by my side i can do anything
I don't care what tomorrow brings as long as we're together
my heart is telling me that you could be my meant to be
I know it more each time we touch
cuz...

Something happens when you look at me I forget to speak
something happens when you kiss my mouth my knees get so weak
could it be true is this what God has meant for me
cuz baby I can't believe...that something like you could happen to me

Something magical something magical
something spiritual something spiritual
something stronger than the two of us alone
something physical
something undeniable undeniable
nothing like anything anything that i've ever known
cuz...

Something happens when you look at me I forget to speak
something happens when you kiss my mouth my knees get so weak
could it be true is this what God has meant for me
cuz baby I can't believe...that something like you could happen to me

Something happened...ohhhh, can't believe that you happened to me
hey yeah...
