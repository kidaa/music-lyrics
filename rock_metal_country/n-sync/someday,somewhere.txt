When clouds above you
Start to pour
And all your doubts
Break like a storm
And you don't know
What you already know
Let me help you find
What you've been searching for

*CHROUS:
Somewhere
Somewhere there's a fields and a river
Somewhere
You can let your soul run free
Someday
Someday let me be the giver
Let me bring you peace
Somewhere
Somewhere there's a break in the weather
Somewhere
Where your heart and spirit go free
Someday
Someday it'll be for the better
Let this bring you peace*

Girl I know you
Think no one see's
The weight on your shoulders
but you cant fool me
and aren't you tired
of standin' so tall?
let me be the one
to catch you when you fall

*CHORUS*

Let me bring you joy
bring you joy
Let me bring you peace
bring you peace
Take these tears that you cry
and trust them to me
Let me give you hope
give you hope
Be the one constant love
that you've never known

*CHORUS*
