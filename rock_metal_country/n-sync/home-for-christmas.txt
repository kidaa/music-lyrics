Crossing the ocean with my window view
Thinking of the time I spent with you
And I close my eyes
I see the family
Making out their wish list
All dressed up for Christmas
On my own for too many years
I miss the happiness
I miss the tears
When I close my eyes
And I'm all alone
I think of all the love we shared
When I need a friend
Or a helping hand
I know that you will all be there
I've been gone for too many holidays 
But you can light the fire
Cause this year this year
I'll be home for Christmas Day

I see the children playing in the snow
Precious memories I used to know
When I see the love in the mother's eyes
Always there to teach us
The real meaning of Christmas
On my own for too many years
I miss the happiness
I miss the tears

When I close my eyes
And I'm all alone
I think of all the love we shared
When I need a friend
Or a helping hand
I know that you will all be there
I've been gone for too many holidays 
But you can light the fire
Cause this year this year
I'll be home for Christmas

It doesn't matter how alone you think you are
Something happens to you
When you see that shining star

When I close my eyes
And I'm all alone
I think of all the love we shared
When I need a friend
Or a helping hand
I know that you will all be there
I've been gone for so many holidays 
But you can light the fire
Cause this year this year
I'll be home for Christmas

When I close my eyes
And I'm all alone
I think of all the love we shared
When I need a friend
Or a helping hand
I know that you will all be there
I've been gone for so many holidays 
But you can light the fire,
I'm sending a wire 
That this year
I'll be home for Christmas Day
