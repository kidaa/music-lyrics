You know we don't care at all
let me see you up, up against the wall

I was just doin' my thing
Hanging out at the spot
You know the place we go
The music's john blaze hot
And everybody was feeling the DJ the DJ
Smoke cleared and I saw a beautiful lady

The lights went low 
and the disco ball came down
She walked up to me slow
and you know what happens now
The girl was fine and she knew she was game
What more do I have to say

She took my hand
We never said a word at all
She starting grinding
Shorty had me up against the wall
Ask me about tomorrow
You know that I don't care at all
I just got caught up when
She had me up against the wall

You know we don't care at all
Just get caught up when you're up against the wall 
We don't, we don't care at all you know we don't care at all, let me see you up, up, up against the wall

It's almost 2 o'clock
It's time to make my move
The after hours spot
Is where I'm going to
Cause I gotta have some more
Looking for somebody to hit the dance floor
And lucky for me
I see a fine young lady's eying me
The lights are low
and our friends were all around
I walked up to her slow
and you know what happens now
She turned around
and she worked in the worst way
What more, do I have to say

She took my hand
We never said a word at all
We starting grinding
Shorty had me up against the wall
Ask me about tomorrow
You know that I don't care at all
I just got caught up when
She had me up against the wall
Shorty had me up against the wall

Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the cutest one you saw
She's underneath the disco ball, the disco ball, the disco ball
Standing next to strobe lights
Dancin' hot, looking tight
The freak show do come out at night, out at night, night, night, night..

What more do I have to say
She took my hand
We never said a word at all
We starting grinding
Shorty had me up against the wall
Ask me about tomorrow
You know that I don't care at all
I just got caught up when
She had me up against the wall

She took my hand
We never said a word at all
We starting grinding
Shorty had me up against the wall
Ask me about tomorrow
You know that I don't care at all
I just got caught up when
She had me up against the wall
Shorty had me up against the wall

I just got caught up when you had me up against the wall
We don't, we don't care at all
You just get caught up when you're up against the wall
We don't, we don't care at all
You know we don't care at all 
Let me see you up, up against the wall
We don't, we don't care at all
You know we don't care at all 
You just get caught up when you're up against the wall
We don't, we don't care at all
You know we don't care at all 
Let me see you up, up against the wall
