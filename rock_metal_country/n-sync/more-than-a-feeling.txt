I woke up this morning and the sun was gone 
Turned on some music to start my day 
I lost myself in a familiar song 
I closed my eyes and slipped away 
More than a feeling 
More than a feeling 
Well it's more than a feeling 
When I hear that old song they used to play 
I begin dreaming 
'Till I see Marianne walk away 
More than a feeling 
More than a feeling 
*Chorus* 
Close my eyes and slip away
