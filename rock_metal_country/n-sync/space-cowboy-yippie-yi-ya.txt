Riprock, AG
Come in over
Yo, turn me up
I wanna be heard
See, I'm talking bout the future y'all
And the future looks bright
'specially when we rip in half 
Here it comes, millennium
And everybody's talkin' bout Jerusalem
Is this the beginning or beginning of the end
Well, I've got other thoughts my friend

See I've got my eyes on the skies
The heavenly bodies up high
And if you're in the mood to take a ride
Then strap on a suit and get inside

If you wanna fly, come and take a ride
Take a space ride with the cowboy, baby
If you wanna fly, come and take a ride
Take a space ride with the cowboy, baby

We don't need all these prophecies
Telling us what's a sign, what's a sign
Cause paranoia ain't the way to live your life from day to day
So leave your doubts and your fears behind

Don't be afraid at all
Cause up in outer space there's no gravity to fall
Put your mind and your body to the test
Cuz up in outer space is like the wild wild west

If you wanna fly, come and take a ride
Take a space ride with the cowboy, baby
If you wanna fly, come and take a ride
Take a space ride with the cowboy, baby

[Left-Eye of TLC]
Boom and never let you try to stop me
Born to fly sky high up to the top see
Nothing to fear, no doubts and no tears
Millennium sound to motivate the future years
And you can either be scared or get prepared
Against all odds I bet you never would've dared
To make these moves and take flight like me
To come through for the world prophecy
Space connect to overthrow your interception
Ready or not make it hot
That ain't no question
Get *N Sync and put your head to the sky
Keep the faith
One love from Left Eye

If you wanna fly, come and take a ride
Take a space ride with the cowboy, baby
If you wanna fly, come and take a ride
Take a space ride with the cowboy, baby

If you wanna fly, come and take a ride
Take a space ride with the cowboy, baby
If you wanna fly, come and take a ride
Take a space ride with the cowboy, baby

If you want to fly
Come and take a ride
Take a space ride with a cowboy
