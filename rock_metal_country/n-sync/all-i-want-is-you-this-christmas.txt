[CHRIS] Snowy night
Where it's warm here by the fire
Here with you here with you
I have all that I desire
It's been a long year, 
But somehow we got by...
Now it's Christmas eve 
And love is on our side

[CHRIS] I don't need a hundred gifts beneath the tree
Don't you know the best thing you could give to me
Nothing else will do...
All I want is you this Christmas this Christmas this Christmas

[JOEY] Children sing children sing...
Christmas carols at our door
Spreading joy spreading joy...
That's what Christmas time is for
[JUSTIN   ?] Though we don't have much you've got me and I got you...yeah, yeah, 
yeah
And with a little faith...miracles come true

[JUSTIN] And I don't need a hundred gifts beneath the tree
Don't you know the best thing you could give to me
Nothing else will do...
All I want is you this Christmas this Christmas this Christmas

[JC] And I don't want the love of any other girl
I want only one thing in this whole wide world
Nothing else will do...
All I want is you this...Christmas this Christmas this Christmas

[JC   ALL] Cheek to cheek
The lights are low
A kiss beneath the mistletoe
[JC] Your face lit by the fire's glow
That's all I want tonight...

[JUSTIN] And I don't need a hundred gifts beneath the tree
Don't you know the best thing you could give to me
Nothing else will do...
All I want is you this Christmas this Christmas this Christmas

[JUSTIN] Nothing else will do...
All I want is you... 
This Christmas...yes...
