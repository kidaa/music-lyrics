Oh, hey yeah yeah..
Girl when we started baby we were friends 
But that's not how this fairy tale is gonna end 
See I was thinking then it clicked one day 
That no one else has ever made me feel this way 
The next time I saw you girl I knew I had to try 
To tell you everything that I was feeling deep inside 
And listen good cause what I say is from my heart 
So if you're ready

You see I toss and turn when I'm alone 
And I just cant wait til you get home 
Waiting for your call cause tonight we're gonna do it all 
Girl it's just the two of us 
Cause I'm thinking about you day and night 
And I just can't get you off my mind 
When you get a minute baby I was thinking we could hook up 
It's just the two of us, the two of us 

Cause in a room full of people you're the only one around 
And nothing in this world could ever bring us down 
Baby I'll be there telling you I care 
This I swear 
Girl its just the two of us, the two of us

Baby I wonder if you feel the same as I do 
I wonder if you're going through the things I'm going through...
I sent you flowers on a Saturday
inside's a letter with a message and no name
See I just love the feeling, knowing I can make you smile
and I haven't felt that about someone in quite a while
Just listen to these words I have to say
Just take a chance..

You see I toss and turn when I'm alone 
And I just cant wait til you get home 
Waiting for your call cause tonight we're gonna do it all 
Girl it's just the two of us 
Cause I'm thinking about you day and night 
And I just can't get you off my mind 
When you get a minute baby I was thinking we could hook up 
It's just the two of us, the two of us 

Cause in a room full of people you're the only one around 
And nothing in this world could ever bring us down 
Baby I'll be there telling you I care 
This I swear 
Girl its just the two of us, the two of us

It just gets better with each day baby someday
I always wanted to tell you
But I was so afraid

You see I toss and turn when I'm alone 
And I just cant wait til you get home 
Waiting for your call cause tonight we're gonna do it all 
Girl it's just the two of us 
Cause I'm thinking about you day and night 
And I just can't get you off my mind 
When you get a minute baby I was thinking we could hook up 
It's just the two of us, the two of us 

Cause in a room full of people you're the only one around 
And nothing in this world could ever bring us down 
Baby I'll be there telling you I care 
This I swear 
Girl its just the two of us, the two of us

Ohh.. hey yeah yeah..
