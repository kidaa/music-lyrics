She was my once in a lifetime 
Happy ending come true 
Oh, I guess I should have told her 
I thought she knew 

She said I took her for granted 
That's the last thing I would do 
Oh, I'll never understand it 
I thought she knew 

I thought she knew my world revolved around her 
My love light burned for her alone 
But she couldn't see the flame 
Only myself to blame 
I should have known 
I should have known 

A heartful of words left unspoken 
Now that we're through 
I'd tell my soul to have this silence broken 
Oh, I thought she knew 
I thought she knew 

I thought she knew my world revolved around her 
My love light burned for her alone 
But she couldn't see the flame 
Only myself to blame 
I should have known 
I should have known 

She was my once in a lifetime 
Happy ending come true 
Oh, I guess I should have told her 
But I thought she knew 
I thought she knew, yeah 
I thought she knew, ooh 
Ooh, I thought that she knew
