Dreams come true dreams come true
Dreams come true oh oh oh yeah
Dreams come true na na na na na na
Dreams come true
They do they do
When you when you

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires
Will come to you
It will come to you

If your heart is in your dream your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do

Oh fate is kind
She brings to those to love
The sweet fulfillment of
Their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dream comes true
When you wish upon a star
Your dream
Comes true

Dreams come dreams come dreams come true
Dreams come dreams come dreams come true
It is your star
Dreams come dreams come dreams come true
Dreams come true
Make a wish yeah
Your dreams your dreams come true
