Kiss me at midnight
  5...
hey yeah...
  4...
oh...
  3, 2, 1! 
Kiss me at midnight 
Dance until the morning light
Party into the New Year
All of my friends are here
And when the timing's right
Kiss me at midnight

Kiss... 

I've been waiting for the special night
To be with you
The colors of Christmas are still shining bright
And I know what we're gonna do
Anticipating, music is playing
The magic is in the air
All through the season
Yo've been the reason
I have so much love to share

Kiss me at midnight 
Dance until the morning light
Party into the New Year
All of my friends are here
And when the timing's right
Kiss me at midnight

Kiss...
Kiss me at midnight
Kiss...

We've been making promises in the dark
Our resolutions
As a brand new year is about to start
And we're together.
Celebrating, no more waiting
Our time has arrived
The beat in my heart
As the countdown starts
Just look into my eyes
Kiss me at midnight 
Dance until the morning light
Party into the New Year
All of my friends are here
And when the timing's right
Kiss me at midnight

Baby, it's New Year's Eve 
Time we can believe
In making wishes
Dreams come true
Just for me and you

break
Kiss me at midnight 
Dance until the morning light
Party into the New Year
All of my friends are here
And when the timing's right
Kiss me at midnight

Kiss me at midnight 
Dance until the morning light
Party into the New Year
All of my friends are here
And when the timing's right
Kiss me at midnight

to fade Kiss me at midnight 
Dance until the morning light
Party into the New Year
All of my friends....
