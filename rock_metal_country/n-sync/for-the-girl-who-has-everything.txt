Hey....ohhh...
You drive a pretty car - you know how fine you are
And nobody needs to say it.. no way..
They love the clothes you wear - they compliment you and I
Just love the way you play it...

But the only thing you dream of - money can't buy for you..
Ohh..
And in my dreams I make your wish come true 

For the girl who has everything 
I bring you love

Cause the girl who has everything can't get enough
Of my love

Why do you run and hide - Say what you feel inside say what you feel..
Why must you always fake it oh yeah..
Girl you need to understand
Your heart is safe within my hands and
I promise I'll never break it...ohh.. 

I know that you still dream of what money can't buy for you
And in my dreams I'll make your wish come true 

For the girl who has everything
