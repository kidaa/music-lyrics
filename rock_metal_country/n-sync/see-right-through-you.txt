Tell me what kind of girl would want to play me
Tear me down and try to break me 
Baby how could you betray me 
After all I've done for you 
Took you there, bought you this 
Now that's not enough, babe
Better get your story straight 
Tell me why you wanna play 
I've had enough 

These games they gotta stop
About to get pissed off 
You had to keep leading me on baby
You thought you had me fooled but I see right through you 

Look into my eyes
Tell me what you see 
I see a man who thought you loved me 
you played me like a fool but I see right through you 
I look into your eyes
I'll tell you what I see 
I see a girl who ran game on me 
Thought you had me fooled but I see right through you 

Tell me girl what's his name
What he do to take you
Does he freak you the way
That I do
'Cause you know that
I know how to
I know how to
When he leaves you
Don't come crying back to me
'Cause I'll be moving on you see
And you'll be just a memory
I think I've had enough

These games they gotta stop
About to get pissed off 
You had to keep leading me on baby
You thought you had me fooled but I see right through you 

Look into my eyes
Tell me what you see 
I see a man who thought you loved me 
you played me like a fool but I see right through you 
I look into your eyes
I'll tell you what I see 
I see a girl who maybe lonely 
Thought you had me fooled but I see right through you 

Thought you had me fooled 
See right through you

Tell me baby does he do it, do it like I do
Does he really love you, love you like I do
Now you're crying cause you can't believe that we are through
I don't care cause I see right through you 
Let me tell that if this is how it's gonna be
After all that we been through
What you mean to me
You won't do this to me
Cause I now see right through you 

Look into my eyes
Tell me what you see

I see a girl who maybe lonely 
Thought you had me fooled but I see right through you
