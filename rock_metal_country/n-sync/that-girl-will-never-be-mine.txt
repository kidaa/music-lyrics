That girl will never be mine

First time I saw her at the front door
That girl, her face on every billboard
Hands down, you won't believe the way she laid her eyes on me
Six feet, I spot her from the cat walk
So fly, we got into a small talk
Too bad she had to move along
One smile and she was gone

Can't explain
I never thought that I was gonna lose my head
Call me insane
There's got to be a way

How can I get next to her
Now tell me how it's gonna be done
Will I win or lose this one
Don't care about the fact that
She's in a different league
They say it's no use that I try
That girl will never be mine

Next thing, she's livin' in my TV
That girl, stealin' every daydream
Tough luck, she had to be a star when I'm just same old me
But last night, I ran into her briefly
Guess what, she really wanna see me
They said that I was out of line
Who's wrong, who's right this time

Can't explain
I never thought that I was gonna lose my head
Call me insane
There's got to be a way

How can I get next to her
Now tell me how it's gonna be done
Will I win or lose this one
Don't care about the fact that
She's in a different league
They say it's no use that I try
That girl will never be mine

That girl is freakin' me out
Don't care about the fact that she's all that
That girl has blown out the doubt
There's no way for me to stop

That girl tearin' up the big screen
That girl stealin' every daydream
Tough luck, she had to be the one for me
She will be mine
No matter what they try to say
There's got to be a way

I wanna get next to her
Now tell me how it's gonna be done
Will I win or lose this one
Don't care about the fact that
She's in a different league
They say it's no use that I try
That girl will never be mine
