U Drive Me Crazy
Why are you messin with my mind
U Drive Me Crazy
Why are you tellin' all these lies
U Drive Me Crazy
Stop doing all these things to me
U Drive Me Crazy
`Cause all I want is to be free 

I'm feelin' weak,
I cannot sleep 
My head is burning,
I feel cold down to my feet
I wanna yell,
Somebody help
Is there a guilt for what I've got
Somebody tell me

I need your lovin' face
I need your sweet embrace
`Cause you are my only medicine

U Drive Me Crazy
Why are you messin with my mind
U Drive Me Crazy
Why are you tellin' all these lies
U Drive Me Crazy
Stop doing all these things to me
U Drive Me Crazy
`Cause all I want is to be free 

You're on my mind,
I'm so uptight
I feel sensation in my head,
Down to my spine
Goin' insane
Can't stand the pain
Is my condition permanent
Somebody tell me

I need your lovin' face
I need your sweet embrace
`Cause you are my only medicine

U Drive Me Crazy
Why are you messin with my mind messin with my mind baby
U Drive Me Crazy
Why are you tellin' all these lies tellin' all these lies
U Drive Me Crazy
Stop doing all these things to me
U Drive Me Crazy
`Cause all I want is to be free

24/7, You are on my mind
I'm going crazy
You are the cure and you know but you don't care
Girl, you're driving me insane...

[Rap by Tony Cottura]
You can say what you want to,
Do what you want to
As long as you love me girl,
I won't front you
You're the sweetest thing
Let me be your man
Let me hold your hand
Or let me be your friend
Meanwhile I will set the house up on a hill
Girl as you know it's all about the dollar bill
Gonna treat you like a queen,
Like a lady
Chica, chico you drive me crazy

You're always on my mind
I need you all the time
So come and get with me
`Cause darlin' you're the one I need
Someone to hold me tight
`Cause I can't sleep at night
You are my fantasy
Girl, you drive me crazy

U Drive Me Crazy
Why are you messin with my mind
U Drive Me Crazy
Why are you tellin' all these lies tellin' all these lies
U Drive Me Crazy
Stop doing all these things to me
U Drive Me Crazy
`Cause all I want is to be free

Crazy... Why are you messin with my mind
Crazy... Why are you tellin' all these lies
Crazy... U drive me Crazy
Crazy... `Cause all I want is to be free
Crazy
