Well it's not far down to paradise
At least it's not for me
And if the wind is right you can sail away
And find tranquillity
Oh the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Baby believe me, oh

It's not far to Never-Never Land
No reason to pretend
And if the wind is right you can find the joy
Of innocence again
Oh the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Baby believe me, oh

Sailing takes me away
To where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream in the wind to carry me
Soon I will be free

Fantasy
It gets the best of me
When I'm sailing, sailing
All the world in a reverie
Every word is a symphony
Won't you believe me
Oh

Sailing takes me away
To where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream in the wind to carry me
Soon I will be free

Its not far back to sanity
At least it's not for me
And if the wind is right you can sail away
And find serenity
The canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Baby believe me

Sailing takes me away
To where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream in the wind to carry me
Soon I will be free
