If I wasn't a celebrity
Would you be so nice to me
If I couldn't have cheese like everyday
Would you still wanna be with me
If I couldn't buy you diamond rings
And all those other expensive things
Would you be so into me
If I wasn't a celebrity

Lately
Ive been doing a little thinking
'Bout the things
That satisfy you
It's making me wonder
'Bout the things that
You see in me
I hate the way
You like to say your
Man's a celebrity
Baby what's the deal
I thought you wanted me for me

You gotta say what you mean
You gotta mean what you say
Cause you keep pushing me away
'Cause I ain't got
No time to play
So I say

If I wasn't a celebrity
Would you be so nice to me
If I couldn't have cheese like everyday
Would you still wanna be with me
Baby, if I couldn't buy you diamond rings
And all those other expensive things
Would you be so into me
If I wasn't a celebrity

Celebrity, celebrity
Celebrity, celebrity
Celebrity, celebrity
Celebrity, celebrity

I'm glad you're having a good time
Living the life that
I laid out for me
Constantly splurging
Spending my money
On everything you see
It would be different
If you had something,
Maybe like a
J-O-B
You need to
Get your thing together, yeah

You gotta stop running games
It ain't about my fame
Cause you know if things weren't this way
You'd be gone a long time ago, so I say

If I wasn't a celebrity
Would you be so nice to me
If I couldn't have cheese like everyday
Would you still wanna be with me
If I couldn't buy you diamond rings
And all those other expensive things
Would you be so into me
If I wasn't a celebrity

If you really loved me
You'd try and show me
That it ain't even about my name
But you tried to use me
And lied to fool me
So it can never be the same
So now, I'm, leaving you behind
I've found somebody
Who can love me for me
And that's all I need, yeah, oh

Celebrity, celebrity
Celebrity, celebrity
Celebrity, celebrity
Celebrity, celebrity

If I wasn't a celebrity
Would you be so nice to me
If I couldn't have cheese like everyday
Would you still wanna be with me
If I couldn't buy you diamond rings
And all those other expensive things
Would you be so into me
If I wasn't a celebrity

If I wasn't a celebrity
Would you be so nice to me
If I couldn't have cheese like everyday
Would you still wanna be with me
If I couldn't buy you diamond rings
And all those other expensive things
Would you be so into me
If I wasn't a celebrity
