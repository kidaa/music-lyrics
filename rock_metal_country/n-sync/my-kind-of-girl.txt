When I was younger 
I never went too far 
Held my feelings 
I never even wanted to start 

So when I met you 
I didn't know what you were gonna do in my heart 

When you talk I hang on every word you say 
When you move you're like the breeze on a summer day 
When you smile the sky turns from grey to blue 
That's what you do 

And you're the kinda girl I think of 
And you're the kinda girl I dream about 
My heart is tellin me I need you in my world in my world 
Cos you're my kinda lady 
You're my kinda girl 

When I'm not with you 
Wherever you are 
Baby, I'm countin'
the moments 'till I'm back in your arms 
All I want is to have to here with me 
Every night every day 

When you talk hang on every word you say 
When you move like the breeze on a summer day 
When you smile the sky turns from grey to blue 
That's what you do 

And you're the kinda girl I think of 
And you're the kinda girl I dream about 
My heart is tellin me I need you in my world my world 
Cos you're my kinda lady 
You're my kinda girl 

Baby girl, I need you here by my side 
And if you're there everything will be all right 
Cos this is the time for us this is the time 
Baby be mine baby be mine 
And you're the kinda girl I think of I think about 
And you're the kinda girl I dream about you're the kind of girl I dream about yeah 
My heart is tellin me I need you in my world 
Cos you're my kinda lady 
You're my kinda girl 

My kind of girl, My kind of girl, My kind of girl, My kind of girl...
