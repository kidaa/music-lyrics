[Pinball machine noises]
The game is over 
Ahhh yeah 
Ahh yeah

Invincible
Is what you think you are
But you're so typical
Though you think that you're a star
You act like
Everyone revolves around you
Baby you dropped the ball
And now the game is through

'Cause you tried to play both sides
You got caught up in your lies
And now you're running
You're running out of time

You played yourself
But did ya, did ya
Think you could really
Find love from someone else
You making moves
You gonna lose
You know you played yourself
And now you thinking, thinking
You can get one by me
But you'll never win,
But you'll never win
Try again
'Cause the game is over

Take it personal
'Cause I did
When you cheated on me
You may be beautiful
But there's more
That the eye can see
You're so predictable
The way you calculate each move
Heads I win
Tails you lose
Because you don't have
The right to choose

'Cause you tried to play both sides
You got caught up in your lies
And now you're running
You're running out of time

You played yourself
But did ya, did ya
Think you could really
Find love from someone else
You making moves
You gonna lose
You know you played yourself
And now you thinking, thinking
You can get one by me
But you'll never win,
But you'll never win
Try again
'Cause the game is over

Yeah

Woo

How could you think that
You could do me like that
Running behind my back
How could you do me like that
Now the game is over
How could you think that
You could do me like that
Do me like that
Do me like that

You played yourself
But did ya, did ya
Think you could really
Find love from someone else
You making moves
You gonna lose
You know you played yourself
And now you thinking, thinking
You can get one by me
But you'll never win,
But you'll never win
Try again
'Cause the game is over

You played yourself
But did ya, did ya
Think you could really
Find love from someone else
You making moves
You gonna lose
You know you played yourself
And now you thinking, thinking
You can get one by me
But you'll never win,
But you'll never win
Try again
'Cause the game is over
