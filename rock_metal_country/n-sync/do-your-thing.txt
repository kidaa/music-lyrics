Waiting, for your peice of the pie 
to drop out of the sky gotta go get it
Hesitating, for somebody else 
to run and pass you by never get your time

[hook]
There ain't no excuse for losing your feet
Drowning in your defeat, on this road of life
there ain't no excuse for coming up short, the ball is in your court
so reach up and touch the sky

[chorus]
Are you doing your thing and doing it well
Are they looking at you hating singing oooohhh
Ar you doing your thing and doing it good
do your thing thing oh, do your thing thing oh

do your thing Do Your Thing, oooohhhh oh.......

Keeping yourself from taking 
on your perfect dreamyou had to be open
And being something 
somewhere that you read in a magazine but you never let you shine

[hook]
There ain't no excuse for losing your feet
Drowning in your defeat, on this road of life
there ain't no excuse for coming up short, the ball is in your court
so reach up and touch the sky

[chorus x2]
Are you doing your thing and doing it well
Are they looking at you hating singing oooohhh
Ar you doing your thing and doing it good
do your thing thing oh, do your thing thing oh
Believe can nobody do it better than you, 
believe can nobody do it better than you

Are you doing your thing, well
Are you letting your dreams, come alive
Are you doing your thing, good
Believe can nobody do it better than you, 
believe can nobody do it better than you

[rap]
Gotta walk, gotta break, gotta call, gotta take, 
everything that I bring, never do fall
Gotta hump, gotta bump, never sit on a stump, 
never quit on a swell of a lump
If you really want it bad
you can't ever drag your feet to the beat of the sound of defeat
even if you got heat
Whoa
Never take your mad off to defeat, so...
