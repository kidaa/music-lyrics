Could it be you
I've been searching so hard to find
Tell me how could I have been so blind
You were here all the time you were here all the time
Could it be you 
You never looked as good to me
As you looked tonight
It's like I've seen you for the first time 
Though a lover's eyes

How could it be how could it be
That I never knew I never knew
It's always been you that I've been looking for I've been looking for
You were always right here by my side.. oh yeah...

Could it be you
I've been searching so hard to find
Tell me how could I have been so blind
You were here all the time oh yeah

Could it be you
The girl I've always had dreams about
The one I just can't live without
Is it so tell me now
Could it be you

Can you imagine what it's like
To always live without love
I need to have you in my life
I think I know that now

My open heart my open heart
Can make you a part make you a part
A part of this love that I've been keeping I've been keeping for
And I might just give it all to you oh oh..

Could it be you
I've been searching so hard to find to find
Tell me how could I have been so blind so blind
You were here all the time here all the time

Could it be you
The girl I've always had dreams about I've been searching
The one I just can't live without ohh..

Though they might be sweet
They can't compare to you
So I'll search no more
What I'm looking for

Tell me how could I have been so blind so blind
You were here all the time please tell me baby, baby..

The girl I've always had dreams about dreams about 
FADES...
