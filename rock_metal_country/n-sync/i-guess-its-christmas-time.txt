Feel the magic in the air
Christmas is all around
Somethin' about this special time of year
A blanket of snow falls down from the sky
Voices of angels
Open our hearts so we can open our arms

And we'll all join hands
To celebrate the goodness
That shines inside of everyone
It must have been a part of some great design
Guess it's Christmas time

Seein' the face of the little boys and girls
Singing their first "Noel"
A sweet refrain heard all around the world
A song of forgiveness, comforting peace
A time to remember, what life really means life really means
The important things important things

And we'll all join hands
To celebrate the goodness
That shines inside of everyone
It must have been a part of some great design
Guess it's Christmas time...

Guess it's Christmas time...
Open our hearts so we can open our arms

And we'll all join hands
To celebrate the goodness
That shines inside of everyone
It must have been a part of some great design
Guess it's Christmas time...

It must have been a part of some great design
Guess it's Christmas time...
