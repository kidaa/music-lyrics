I was making a list
I was checking it twice
In the middle of this 
I got tears in my eyes
For in my foolish heart
There was one simple truth
The only gift I wanted was you
I was trimming the tree
I was stringing the lights
While the radio played "Silent Night"
There were present you sent
Though there were quite a few
The only gift I wanted was you

You need to be home with me
Alone with me
Holding me next to the Christmas tree
Kissing under the mistletoe
As candles blow
Please come home soon
It's not the same without you

As the bittersweet night
Had come to an end
I was saying goodbye
To our family and friends
And they all wished me well
And I knew that I knew
The only gift I wanted was you

You need to be home with me
Alone with me
Holding me next to the Christmas tree
Kissing under the mistletoe
As candles blow
Please come home soon
It's not the same without you

Deck the halls with boughs of holly
la la la la la la...

The only gift I wanted was you
You need to be home with me
Alone with me
Holding me next to the Christmas tree
Kissing under the mistletoe
As candles blow
Please come home soon
It's not the same without you

I was making a list
I was checking it twice
In the middle of this 
I got tears in my eyes
For in my wishful heart
There was one simple truth
The only gift I wanted was you
