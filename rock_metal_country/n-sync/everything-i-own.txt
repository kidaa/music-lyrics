You sheltered me from harm.
You kept me warm
You kept me warm 
And you gave my life to me
You set me free, 
You set me free 
The finest years I ever knew 
Were all the years I had with you 

I would give everything I own, 
I'd give up my life, my heart, my home.
And I would give everything I own, 
Just to have you back again. 

You taught me how to laugh, 
What a time
What a time
You never said too much,
But still you showed you cared,
And I knew from watching you. 

And nobody else could ever know
The part of me that can't let go. 

I would give everything I own, 
I'd give up my life, my heart, my home.
And I would give everything I own, 
Just to have you back again. 

Is there someone you know,
Loving them so,
You're taking them all for granted.
You may lose them one day, 
Someone takes them away, 
And they don't hear the words 
You long to say

Give up my life, give up my heart
Everything I own [Repeat]

You know baby, my love for you will
always stay true. That's right. 'Cause
there is no me without you. And I would give everything
Everything I own Nobody can love you, love you 
Love you, love you like I do

I would give everything I own, 
I'd give up my life, my heart, my home.
And I would give everything I own, 
Just to have you back again. 

Just to have you back again.
