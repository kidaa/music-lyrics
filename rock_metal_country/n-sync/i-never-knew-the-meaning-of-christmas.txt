Lookin' back on childhood days
I can't believe my foolish ways
Thought that Christmas only came from a store
Had to know what was there for me
Underneath the Christmas tree
I didn't know that there could be so much more
But in all of the rush
I was missing so much
Girl you made me finally see
That I never knew the meaning of Christmas
'Till you came into my life
I was lost in the dark
'Till you opened my heart
Like an angel shining bright
I wished on a star
And girl here you are
Suddenly I realize
That I never knew the meaning of Christmas
'Till I looked into you eyes

Comin' home for the holidays 
Seeing friends from around away
There was always something missing for me
On a sleigh ride caroling
Didn't really mean anything
Without that someone who can make it complete
While the snows falling down
There was joy all around
'Cause girl your love has shown me the way

That I never knew the meaning of Christmas 
'Till you came into my life
I was lost in the dark
'Till you opened my heart
Like an angel shining bright
I wished on a star
And girl here you are
Suddenly I realize
That I never knew the meaning of Christmas
'Till I looked into your eyes

Fa la la la la...
Sing it la la la la
la la la 
Fa la la la la...
Sing it la la la la
la la la..

But in all of the rush
I was missing so much
Girl you made me finally see..yeah

That I never knew the meaning of Christmas
never knew, never knew, never knew...
'Till you came into my life
I was lost in the dark
'Till you opened my heart
Like an angel shining bright
I wished on a star
And girl here you are
Suddenly I realize
That I never knew the meaning of Christmas
'Till I looked into you eyes

That I never knew the meaning of Christmas 
'Till I looked into your eyes
