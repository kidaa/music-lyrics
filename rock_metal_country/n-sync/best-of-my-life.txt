Girl, don't say that it's over 
Cause you are a part of me 
Girl just hold on and please 
Tell me, what is wrong with us 
Could it be that you're lonely 
Could it be that I didn't care 
And tell me please girl that you are still feeling for me 
Girl, where is the love 
That we used to know 
Our love 
All these beautiful days 
That we used to share 
Lord, tell me please what can I do 
I will give you 
The best of my life 
Yes, I'll give you 
All that you need 
Anything that you want 
I will give it to you 
*Chorus* 
And you know that I miss you 
And you know, I can't live without you 
I'm praying each day that your love will 
Come back my way 
In my dreams I still hold you 
In my dreams are you still with me 
Please don't hesitate 
Cause girl I can't wait for our love 
Girl, where is the love 
That we used to know 
Our love 
All these beautiful days 
That we used to share 
Lord, please tell me what can I do 
*Chorus*
