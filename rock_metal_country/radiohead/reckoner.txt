Reckoner
You can't take it with you
Does it for the pleasure

You were not to blame for
Bittersweet distractors
Dare not speak his name
Dedicated to all you
All your needs

Because we separate
The ripples on a black shore
Because we separate
The ripples on a black shore

Reckoner

Dedicated to all you human beings
