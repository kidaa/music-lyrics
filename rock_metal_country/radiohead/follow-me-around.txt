I see you in the dark
Falling down the fastlane
Coming out to me

Warm lights belong to me
Crawling out to me
Crawling out to me

You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around

Even when you're coming down
You are standing for the world
And I can see you now
And I'm being there, to come down

You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around..
