Please forget the words that I just blurted out
It wasn't me, it was my strange and creeping doubt
It keeps rattling my cage
And there's nothing in this world will keep it down

Even though I might, even thought I try, I can't
Even though I might, even thought I try, I can't

So many things that keep,  that keep me underground
So many words that I, that I can never find
If you give up on me now I'll be gutted like I've never been before

And even though I might, even thought I try, I can't
Even though I might, even thought I try, I can't

If you give up on me now I'll be gutted like I've never been before
And even though I might, even thought I try, I can't
Even though I might, even thought I try, I can't
Even though I might, even thought I try, I can't
Even though I might, even thought I try, I can't
