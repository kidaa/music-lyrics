In my mind
And nailed into my heels
All the time
Killing what I feel

And everything I touch
all wrapped up in cotton wool
all wrapped up in sugar-coated pills
Turns to stone
Everything I touch
all wrapped up in cotton wool
all wrapped up in sugar-coated pills
Turns to stone

I am fused
Just in case I blow out
I am glued
Just in case I crack out

And everything I touch turns to stone
Everything I touch
all wrapped up in cotton wool
all wrapped up in sugar-coated pills
Turns to stone
