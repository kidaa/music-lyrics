I never wanted anything but this
I tried hard, worked hard
I ran around in domestic bliss
I fought hard, died hard

Everytime you're running over me
Everytime you're running I can see

I'm not a vegetable
I will not control myself
I spit on the hand that feels me
I will not control myself

I never wanted any broken bones
Scarred face, no home
Your words surround me and I asphyxiate
And I burn all hate

Everytime you're running out on me
Everytime you're running I can see

I'm not a vegetable
I will not control myself
I spit on the hand that feels me
I will not control myself

The waters break, the waters run all over me
The waters break, the waters run
And this time you're gonna pay

I'm not a vegetable
I will not control myself
I spit on the hand that feels me
I will not control myself..
