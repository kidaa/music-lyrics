Bummed out again by your only business friend
The smell of fear is thicker than you think
Don't do it
Don't jump

Changed shape to fit
In the end you just feel sick
A million love songs under anaesthetic
Hey don't do it
Don't jump

Lewis
Save yourself the pain
You'll never get there
Lewis
Save yourself the pain
It never really mattered

We never noticed
We never understood
He just get crushed to fit
He never even smelt out the best
It's the best
It's the best day of your life

Lewis
Save yourself the pain
You'll never get there
Lewis
Save yourself the pain
It never really mattered
No
I swear
I swear
I swear

Oh
Mistreated
A low corporate
Mistreated
A low corporate

I don't wanna to talk about it
I don't wanna to talk about it
I don't wanna to talk about Lewis, Lewis, Lewis
I don't wanna to talk about Lewis, Lewis, Lewis
