I wrapped you inside my coat
When they came to firebomb the house
I didn't feel pain, 'cause no one can touch me
Now that I'm held in your spell

A beautiful girl
A beautiful girl can turn your world into dust

Sell me a car that goes
Sell me a house that stands
I never cared before, I never cared before
I never cared before, before, before, before

A beautiful girl
A beautiful girl can turn your world into dust

A beautiful girl
A beautiful girl can turn your world into dust

I stood in front of her face
When the first bullet was shot
