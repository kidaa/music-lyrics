This is just a nightmare
But soon I'm going to wake up
Someone's gonna bring me around

Hiding from the bombers
Wading through the fields
Running in the half light

Running to ??
Just like everybody
Could ??

Running through the underground
And this is your warning
4 minute warning

I don't wanna hear it
I don't wanna grow old
I just wanna run and hide

Now I'm in a nightmare
But soon I'm gonna wake up
Someone's gonna bring me 'round

This is your warning
4 minute warning
