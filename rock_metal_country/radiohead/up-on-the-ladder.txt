I'm stuck in the tardis 
Trapped in hyperspace 
One minute snake charming
The next in another place

All the right moves and 
Earn the right percent
Watch me dance like a puppet 
You can almost see the strings

Give me an answer
Give me a sign 
I've been climbing up this ladder 
I've been wasting my time

So long, so long
So long, so long 

Up on the ladder 
No time to escape
Up on the ladder
Away for fucking sake

Up on the ladder
Try to call out your name
Up on the ladder
You're all the fucking same

Oh, you let the people down
You let the people down
You let the people down
