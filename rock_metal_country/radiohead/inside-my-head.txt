What do you want from me now you got me
Now my fingers bleed now they stare at me
I'm a coward now
I hold my peace

Now you tie me up to your feather bed
And I twist and turn in a Chinese burn
You won't let go
You won't let go

You're inside my head
Inside my head

What do you want from me now you got me
Now my energy you suck from me
And I'm holding on for dear life
Quit smothering me
Quit laughing at me
I've got a disease, an english disease
It will not go
It will not go

You're inside my head
Inside my head

Whatever you put in that syringe
Whatever you really said to him
He's sitting there inside of me
And you bother me, you possess me
You're there again, ahead of me
I won't let go
I won't let go

You're inside my head
Inside my head
Inside my head
Inside my head
