There are things to talk about 
Be constructive 

There are weapons, we can use 
Be constructive 
With your blues 

Even when they tore the wall down 
Even when they tore the wall down 

Why don't you quiet down 
Why won't you quiet down 
Why don't you quiet down 
Why won't you quiet down 

We are the dollar and cents
