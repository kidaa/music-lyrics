Seen all the good things and bad
Running down the hill
All so battered and brought to the ground
I am hungry again
I am drunk again
With all the money I owe to my friends

And when I'm like this
How can you be smiling, singing
How can you be sure
How can you be sure

If you walk out the door
Will I see you again
If so much of me lies in your eyes
I am hungry again
I am drunk again
With all the money I owe to my friends

When I'm like this
How can you be smiling, singing
How can you be sure I don't want you
How can you be sure I don't want you
How can you be sure I don't want you
How can you be sure I don't want you

I don't want you, I don't want you anymore
I don't want you, I don't want you anymore
