It's funny how
To drive your stupid car
It's funny how
'Cause I never get that far
And you put my brain in overload
And i can't change gears
I cannot see the road

You got concrete eyes
And I cannot see your face
And I failed in life
'Cause you crushed me with your hands
And you put my brain in overload
I can't change gears
I cannot see the road
