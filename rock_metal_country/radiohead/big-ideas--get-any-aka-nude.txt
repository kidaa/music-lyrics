Don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
You paint your house white and feel the noise
But there'll be something missing

And now that you found it, it's gone
Now that you feel it, you don't
I'm not afraid

She stands stark naked and she beckons you to bed
Don't go you'll only want to come back again

So don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
You'll go to hell for what your dirty mind is thinking

And now that you found it, it's gone
And now that you feel it, you don't
I'm not afraid

Alternate lyrics for the first line of the second verse:
she kisses you with tongue and pulls you to the bed
don't go you'll only want to come back again
