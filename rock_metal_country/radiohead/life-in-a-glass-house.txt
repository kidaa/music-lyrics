Once again, she is smashing up her house again
She is throwing things through windows
She is mad at someone else again,
It is now a broken home

Once again, I am so low with my only friend
He is smashing up his house again
You are throwing things at me again
And I'm wrecked up all inside

Well if I stop that singing now and shout
Well if I stop that singing to you friend
Well if I stop that singing now and shout
Someone is standing there

There I'm home, once the feet inside shout it out
Once a beating when I make my way out
Once a beating when I'm home inside
There is nothing wrong at all

Well if I stop that singing now and shout
Well if I stop that singing to you friend
Well if I stop that singing now and shout
Someone is standing there
