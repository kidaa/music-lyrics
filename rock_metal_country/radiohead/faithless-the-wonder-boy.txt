I've had these jeans since I was born
And now they're ripped and now they're torn
And all my friends have skateboards

I want the toys of other boys
I want a knife and a gun and things
But Mum and Dad will not give in

And I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
No I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in

And now I know just what it is
It's got disease and it's got my head
It always runs where I hide

Too scared to talk, too scared to try
Too scared to know the reasons why
And all my friends say bye bye

And I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
No I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in...
