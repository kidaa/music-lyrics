Come on, come on
You think you drive me crazy
Come on, come on
You and whose army?
You and your cronies
Come on, come on
Call your own empire
Come on if you think
Come on if you think
You can take us all on
You can take us all on

You and whose army?
You and your cronies

You think it's so easy
We want to know
We want to know
I'm so sad
I'm so sad
I'm so sad..
