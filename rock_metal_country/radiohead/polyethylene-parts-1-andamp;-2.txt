Go    
Tears of Joy Disjointed 
This is joy  
We'll scare ourselves  
Now Scare ourselves 
Will scare ourselves  
Of all that you wanna be    
Just go paid and now you're going    
How long should you be 
How inside you please 
Out on Saturdays  
If I get scared I'll just call you    
And I miss your glow as I unsettle 
And I'll miss your glow as I unsettle   
Oh and I'll always feel Oh but I'll always feel   
I will always be  I will always feel   
Right, One, Two, Three, Four    
So sell your suit and tie 
So sad you seem tired 
So sell your sin inside 
So sad your sitting tight. 
And come and live with me 
Well come and live with me   
Leukemia Live with Me   
Schizophrenia Something in your   
Polyethylene    
There is no signicant    
Risk to your health    
She used to be beautiful once aswell    
Plastic Bag Middle Class Polyethylene    
Decaffeinate    
I'll let it Unleaded   
Keep all surfaces clean    
If you don't believe me If you don't believe this   
Sell your soul Sell yourself   
If you don't get into it no one will
