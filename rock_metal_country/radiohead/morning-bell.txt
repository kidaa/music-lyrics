Morning bell
Morning bell
Light another candle
Release me
Release me

You can keep the furniture
A bump on the head
Coming down the chimney
Release me
Release me
Please........
Release me
Release me

Where'd you park the car
Where'd you park the car
Clothes are all over the furniture
Now I might as well
I might as well
Sleepy jack the fire drill
Run around around around around around....

Cut the kids in half [x3]

The lights are on but nobody's home
Everybody wants to be a
The lights are on but nobody's home
Nobody wants to be a slave
Walking walking walking walking...

The lights are on but nobody's home
Everybody wants to be a
Everyone wants to be a friend
Nobody wants to be a slave
Walking walking walking walking...
