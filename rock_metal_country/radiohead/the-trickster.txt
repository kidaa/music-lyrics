Rust in the mountains
Rust in the brain
The air is sacred here
In spite of your claim

Up on the the rooftops
Out of reach
Trickster is meaningless
Trickster is weak

He's talking out the world
Talking out the world
Hey, hey, hey, this is only halfway
Hey, hey, hey, this is only halfway

I wanted you so bad
That I couldn't say
These things fall apart

We wanted out so bad
That we couldn't say
All things fall apart

We're talking out the world
Talking out the world
Hey, hey, hey, this is only halfway
Hey, hey, hey, this is only halfway

Truant kids
A can of brick dust worms
Who do not want to climb down from
Their chestnut tree

Long white gloves
Police check carefully
Escaped from the zoo
The perfect child facsimile is

Talking out the world
Talking out the world
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
