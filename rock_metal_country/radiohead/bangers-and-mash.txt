Bit me, bit me, bit me, oh
I've got the poison, poison, poison now
I'm standing in the hall
Kicking out the wall
It's all been said to comfort you

Bangers in the mash
People lose for cash
??

Whatever turns you on
Whatever gets you off
Chief of police, the vice-chancellor 
??
You're dancing to my little red book 

Bit me, bit me, bit me, oh
I've got the poison, poison
And I want more
Get you an armoured car
They're gonna throw a rock
Stare into the light
The pyramid is power
If you are on the top
??
If you stare into the dark,
The dark will stare back
Back into your soul 

I want to thank you, thank you, thank you all
I'm having such a good time, a good time, had enough?

I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down when I go down 
I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down
I'm standing in the hall
Kicking out the wall
Bit me, bit me, bit me, oh
Bit me, bit me, bit me, oh
I've got the poison
