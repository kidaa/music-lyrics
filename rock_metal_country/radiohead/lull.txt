You stop the crowd
I cried out to break the spell
You wake and smile
I just snapped and lost control

Distracted by irrelevance
The stress and the tension
The stress and the tension
I'm in a lull

There's nothing so dull
As talking, talking 'bout yourself
But what I meant to say
I'm sorry that I lost control

Distracted by irrelevance
The stress and the tension
Crawling through the keyhole
I'm in a lull
