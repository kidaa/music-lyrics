Sometimes I think I've got it good
Sometimes I feel misunderstood 
I'm living in a bubble of hot air
That I blew right out of my mouth
Spending my time with these stupid jerks
I kick right out of my house. 

Sometimes I'm honest, you think I'm rude
Everything is tried, but nothing is true
Sometimes I, yeah, sometimes I, oh, sometimes I steal
Cuz there are times I feel misunderstood 

Well I've learned my lesson,
What's next, for God's sake. Sometimes I feel misunderstood, 
Cuz there are times I like it just a little crude 

She's lost her place
She's fallen from grace
She's got to save face,
Pick up the pace, no 

Sometimes I think I've got it good
Then everything is...tried, but nothing is true
