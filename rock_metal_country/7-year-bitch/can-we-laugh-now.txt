Said love
Fear
And emotion
Stay separate
But can we laugh
When humor within us
That is key
Can we ever see eternity
Or do we bore ourselves to death
Eternity
Eternity 
Time
Time goes by and nothing changes
Have you ever seen a cop that smiles
Still playin' with rattlesnakes
Cuz jokes like that
But here we are
With limitations taking place today
Can we laugh at ourselves
Or do we fool ourselves today Oh what
Time goes by and nothing changes again
Have you ever seen a cop that smiles
Well here we are 
With limitations sticking day to day
Still playin' with rattlesnakes today
Still playin' with rattlesnakes today
Still playin' with rattlesnakes today
Still playin' with rattlesnakes today
Still playin' with rattlesnakes
