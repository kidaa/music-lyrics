It's too late
To fall in love with Sharon Tate
But it's too soon
To ask me for the words I want carved on my tomb 
So I think it's time that you all start
To think about gettin' by
But what about that need to go out and find somebody to love 

It's too late
There's no one left that I even wanna imitate
You see, you just don't know
I'm here to give you my heart
And you want some fashion show 

But it ain't no contribution
To go and rely on an institution
To validate your chosen art
And sanction your boredom
And let you play out your part 

It's too late
You know when they got nothin' to give
They only part their legs for what's negative
And they're so decadent . . .
Until their daddy's money from home's all spent 

So I think it's time, 'cuz it's too easy
To rely on worshipping strangers and devils in bed,
Though they do get good drugs, and they do give good head 

It's too late
You shoulda realized I was worth the wait
Ah, but you didn't hesitate
When she took you off, you let her seal our fate 

So I think it's time
that you all start
To think about gettin' by
Without that need to go out and find
Somebody to love
