I'm tired of you always put me down
Push me around
Tell me what to do
Tell me I don't care about you
You drive me up the wall
Out the window
Down the street
To another block
To another house
You're drivin' me away
You're drivin' me away 
Whadya talkin' about?
Whadya thinkin' about?
Whadya thinkin' about?
Nothin'
Nothin'
Nothin' 

Why can't you love me like I want you to?
And leave me when I die
Why can't you hold me in your arms tonight?
And sing me a lullaby
Bye
Bye Why can't you promise me a tomorrow?
And never say good-bye
Why can't you look me in the eye?
Why can't you?
Why can't you?
Why can't you?
Why can't you try? 

Tired of you always put me down
Push me around
Tell me what to do
Tell me I don't care about you
Whadya talkin' about?
Whadya thinkin' about?
Whadya thinkin' about?
Nothin'
Nothin'
