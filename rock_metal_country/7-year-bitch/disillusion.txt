It cuts a walk I don't bleed
It reaches and pierces my need
'Cuz it cuts a walk I don't bleed 
And it reaches and pierces my need 
And it seems so far away
And it seems like yesterday
But I've made up my mind
As regret crawls up my spine 

It cuts a walk I don't bleed
It reaches and pierces my need
'Cuz it cuts a walk I don't bleed 

And it reaches out into eternity and this is my soul
It cuts but I don't bleed
It cuts
'Cuz I need
'Cuz I need And it seems so far away
And it seems like yesterday
And it rains in the sunshine
As regret crawls up my spine 

It cuts a walk I don't bleed
It reaches and pierces my need
It cuts a walk I don't bleed
It reaches and pierces my need 

'Cuz I'm mean
'Cuz I'm mean
'Cuz I'm mean
