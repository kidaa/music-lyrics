I toss and turn you presence disturbs me
Seethe and burn you ignite me
You move away but not too far
You move away but not too far
I need to know just where you are 
'Cuz I keep track of my friends
And I keep track of my enemies
Who is who, who is who it changes daily 

And you loved her truly yet you loved her cruelly
You loved her truly but you loved her cruelly
You love her 

I see you icy blue
cold and indifferent
No emotion no commitment
I see she and she sees a red red sea
Bleeding for life now she's bleeding to death
Feeling the power and the pain
So much loss she tries harder to gain 

And you loved her truly yet you loved her cruelly
You loved her truly but you loved her cruelly
You love her 

Are you gonna let him, let him love you to death?
Are you gonna let him, let him love you to death?
Are you gonna let him? 

'Cuz if he can't break your heart well maybe he'll bust a couple of ribs 

I toss and turn your presence disturbs me
Seethe and burn you ignite me
You move away but not too far
You move away but not too far
I need to know just where you are
'Cuz I keep track of my friends
And I keep track of my enemies
Who is who, who is who it changes daily 

I see you icy blue
Cold and indifferent
No emotion no commitment 

Are you gonna let him?
Let him love you to death?
Are you gonna let him?
Let him love you to death?
Are you gonna let him, let him love you to death?
Are you gonna let him? 

And he loved you truly yet he loved you cruelly
He loved you truly but he loved you cruelly
