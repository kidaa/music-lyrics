I'm still recoverin' from you whiplash love
Hit and run
It's not like I was taken for a ride
We never even got inside
Hit and run 
So when in lust you trust
You're gonna get left in the dust
Oh when in lust you trust
You're gonna get left in the dust 

Not like your just crusin' round the clock
You're travelin' at the speed of light
Now you're up there with all those other stars 

Well twinkle, twinkle little star
Yeah twinkle, twinkle little star
'Cuz now I wonder where you are?
Oh now I wonder where you are?
Yeah now I wonder where the hell you are? SCREAM
Been hit
Whip
Lash
Break
Stop 

Oh I'm recoverin' from your whiplash love
Hit and run
My mouth's wrapped 'round another bottle
And your foot's like lead on the throttle
Hit and run 

So when in lust you trust
You're gonna get left in the dust
Oh when in lust you trust
You're gonna get left in the dust
