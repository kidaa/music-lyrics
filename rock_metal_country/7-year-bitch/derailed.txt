Horrible memories are back again
My horrible memories
They haven't a friend
Sayin' it before
Now do it again
Memories of tragedies
Memories you scare me
I'm gonna inebriate them
I'm gonna inebriate them 
I will get it
And I will use it
To my advantage
Right up to the brink
Of damage 

I will suck from it
Every juice
Every drop
Put to use 

You don't know shit
So leave me be
I wanna wallow
In self pity 

It's happy hour on a sad train
I need these drinks to dull the pain
So don't you question how do I cope
Oh can't you see there is no hope
No reason though it rhymes
21 hours just me and mine I will get it and I will use it to my advantage
Right up to the brink of damage 

You don't know shit
So leave me be
I wanna wallow
In self pity 

It's happy hour on a sad train
I need these drinks to dull the pain
So don't you question how do I cope
Oh can't you see there is no hope
No reason though it rhymes
21 hours just me and mine 

My horrible memories are back again
