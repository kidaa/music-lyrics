Guns in the desk ??
Said I don't wanna talk to people outta my hands
Gun was on the floor I had a healthy mind
Now I'm in the sixteenth [pre]cinct tonight 
I wanna gun
Give me a gun
To see your fear
And watch you run 

Well you think you're cool
And make us look like fools
With your stupid-ass bullshit
And your macho rules
But turn it around
And point the thing at you
You might have a ??
Or something too I wanna gun
Give me a gun
To see your fear
And watch you run
