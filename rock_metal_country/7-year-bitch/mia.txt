Matter of fact
No fact
No matter 
Who do you suspect
Who is not afraid to die
Who would tell such a lie
Who runs away
Who do we fear? 

Somebody just like you gonna rape and strangle you?
Would you mutilate yourself?
And who would be so shocked by the brutal murder of a killer? 

Will there be hundreds mourning for you?
Will they talk of the talent and inspiration you gave?
No
Who besides your mother will stand in sorrow at your grave? 

Mother may I?
Momma Mia 

I'll see ya
I'll see ya
I'll see ya 

I can't see
I can't see
I can't see
I can't see 

It's dark here
No direction
Just aggrivation
Aggrivation over losing you
To who
No justice
No clue 

And the core of this agitation is my aggrivation
Yeah the core of this aggitation is my aggrivation
I come down and upon despration
I crawl inside and look out 

Look out
Look out 

I can't see
I can't see
I can't see. 

Some things don't come full circle
Circle
Circle 

Pace
Pace
Pace
We walk in place 

No fact
No matter
Society did this to you?
Does society have justice for you?
Well if not
I do 

Because the core of this aggitation is my aggrivation
Yeah the core of this aggitation is my aggrivation
I come down and upon desperation
I crawl inside and look out 

I can't see
I can't see
I can't see
I can't see
I can't see 

Socitey did this to you?
Does society have justice for you?
If not
I Do
