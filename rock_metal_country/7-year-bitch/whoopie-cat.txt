She said she's like that now
You know she's like that now
She said she's like that now 

She's so mean, ?I said ";Sounds fun.";?
'Cuz she's been seen in a ?white skirt?
'Cuz she's the queen of the back stroke
But it's not funny, no it's not a joke 

Did you hear what she did?
Did you listen what they said?
Did you hear what she did? 

Did ya?

Did ya? 

She's so mean, ?I said ";Sounds fun.";?
And she's been seen in a ?white skirt?
Yeah, she's the queen of the back stroke
But it's not funny, no it's not a jokeSome things you say, but I don't talk back
Some things you do, but I don't react
Some things you want, but I won't give back
'Cuz you don't get it, no you don't get it! 

He said ";I had a dream.
I had a dream about you.
And in my dream you were so mean.";
