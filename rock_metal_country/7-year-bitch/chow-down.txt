Her eyes were on you
She counted on you
You ran with her
Your baby and you
And you slept with her
??Who wants it from you??
Who wants it from me
Who wants it from me 
I don't think that baby's too young and too weak
Your momma should have chowed down
Cuz now you're a creep
Retreat
You're too weak
You're defeat
You're dead meat 

Someone goes down
What will we do
And frankly
I can't imagine having a baby with you
Especially when you say ";I'll marry you if you want me to.";
";Do you want me to?"; 

You come in and lay down your hundred dollar bill
Said don't worry baby. 
I know how you feel
You come in and lay down your hundred dollar bill
Said don't worry baby
I know how you feel
How you feel 

Is that how you ask me for my hand
My hand inside your head
Is that how you ask me for my hand
My hand inside your head 

??I?? grew on you
She counted on you
And you ran with her
Your baby and you
And you slept with her
She wants it from you
It wants it from me
It wants it from me
It wants it from me
It wants it from me
It wants it
Wants it
Wants it
Wants it
