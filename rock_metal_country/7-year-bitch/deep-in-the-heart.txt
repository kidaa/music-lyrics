I've got a certain kind of feeling
As he stepped outside that door
Instantly I want something
But I don't get no more
Please give me more 
I want some more 

Got a certain kind of feeling
As he stepped outside that door
I didn't think he'd leave so fast
And then he shut the door
He shut the door 

I want some more
Please give me more 

Just a wave goodbye
You know it felt so wrong
I don't know if his heart is breaking
Or if his heart is gone
Is it gone? I want some more 

I've got a certain kind of feeling
As he stepped outside that door
Instantly I want something
But I don't get no more
Please give me more 

I want some more
