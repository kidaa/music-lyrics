Bringing down the rain from up above
And shine a bright light on a sore subject
The colors they are bending
They're bending over backwards to grant us wishes 
Almost
But they don't quite reach
Almost
It's not quite what we expected 

It's fading too fast
It's fading too fast
It's fading too fast
It's fading too fast 

I suppose it should all be documented and dated
The facts aren't straight and the feelings are hellbent
Alcohol's a truth serum and the truth is I fucked up The truth is
It's fading too fast
The truth is
It's fading too fast 

It's not quite what we expected
It's fading too fast
It's fading too fast 

But we cannot blame it on the alcohol
The truth is everything I do irritates you
I only need one eye to see the other one confuses me
