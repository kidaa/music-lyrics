I'm on a bus with a street car's name
My desire is not the same
I can't get off, no, I can't return 

This is the midst of my spin
Accidents happen in slow motion
Don't wanna stop, don't wanna feel the pain
He would have killed me and my friends
'cuz that's how he deals, that's how he deals with pain 

Oh god
Oh god
Oh god
I need some chemicals
I'm too emotional 

Oh god 

I need some chemicals
I'm too emotional
I need some chemicals
I'm too emotional 

I think he forgot that we should be friends
I think he forgot to call me again
He would have killed me and my friends
'cuz that's how he deals, that's how he deals with pain 

Oh god
Oh god
Oh god AAAAHHHHH 

Accidents happen in slow motion
Accidents happen in slow motion
I need some chemicals
I need some chemicals
I'm too emotional
I'm too emotional
I need some chemicals
I need some chemicals
I'm too emotional
I'm too emotional
He would have killed me and my friends
And accidents happen in slow motion
Accidents happen in slow motion
