We're fucking poor
We're very poor
We're really poor
We're fucking poor 
Bush pull out
Like your father should have
Continue to ignore
We're gonna take it to the streets
We'll start a fucking riot
I wanna fucking riot
It's time to fucking riot
Who wants to fucking riot? 

No fucking war
No fucking war
No fucking war
No fucking war 

Dance and sing, plead
Pray for peace
But they won't hear you
No not in the least
You're in reach and
You've got to shove
Cuz silence
Is defeat
Yes silence
Is defeat We're very poor
We're fucking poor
We're really poor
We're fucking poor 

Bush pull out
Like your father should have
Continue to ignore
We're gonna take it to the streets
Start a fucking riot
I wanna fucking riot
It's time to fucking riot
Who wants a fucking riot?
