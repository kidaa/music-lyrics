Who is Jack?
Jack is in your head
Who is Jack?
Jack is in your bed 
And Jack's been reading, Jack knows everything
And Jack's been havin' little daydreams
And Jack wants to keep your fingernails clean
And Jack is sitting at your breakfast table 

Jack is all around
But you, you can't see
And Jack knows what you like
And Jack knows what you hate
And Jack gets jealous when you slip out on a date 

And Jack is sittin' at your breakfast table
And Jack will see that you're all alone
And Jack is sittin' at your breakfast table
And Jack will see that you're all alone 

Who is Jack?
He's all around
But you can't see
'Cuz Jack protects you
And Jack is the enemy
Who is Jack?
You're caught in his web
Who is Jack? 

And Jack's been havin' little daydreams
And Jack wants to keep your fingernails clean
And Jack is sittin' at your breakfast table 

Who is Jack?
Who is Jack?
Who is Jackkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk????????????????SCREAM
