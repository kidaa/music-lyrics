I want it
Give it to me
I love it 
Don't give it to her
You've gotta give it to me 

I want it
I saw it first
I want it worse 

I love it
Give it to me 

I love it
I love it
Give it to me 

So maybe I didn't see it first but I'm the one who wants it worse
I don't even know what I'm wantin' yet but I know I'm wantin' somethin'
I don't even know what I'm missin' yet but I know I'm missin' somethin'
And if this is my name does it have to be my life
'Cuz I'm not gonna sit around while your with your wife 

I want it
Give it to me
I love it
Don't give it to her
You've gotta give it to me 

Me, me, me
Me, me, me 

Yeah I wouldn't know when to share and I'm suprised that I shoud dare
Well I'm the bitch and you got the itch I'm sorry said go fish
Yeah I'm the bitch and you got the itch I'm sorry said go fish 

She didn't have it
He didn't have it 

I will have my cake and I will eat it too just like you
You better watch out what you're wishing for
I will have my cake and I will eat it too just like you
