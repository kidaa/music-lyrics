You kissed me once
And you kissed me twice
With your mess of slobbering lips 
With dribble in my brow bra??
I wait until you turned around
And wiped it on my pant leg 

Oh now I'll sign this paper for everyone to see
And now I'm up here singing for everyone to hear
Now I'll sign this paper for everyone to see
Now I'm up here singing for everyone to hear 

You
Especially you
It's all for you
It's because of you 

My lungs are filled with smoke
Eyes light and hazy from too many tears
Red and glossy from too many beers
And my stomach shapes into one big knot
My stomach shapes into one big knot 

Oh now let's stop hangin' around this lame town
Take another lookin' at your stupid frown
Looking down, down, down at the ground
Looking down, down, down at the ground 

You gotta turn the other way to avoid that clown
I gotta turn the other way to avoid that clown
I gotta turn the other way to avoid that clown
I gotta turn the other way to avoid that clown 

And I'm amazed at the gamut??
Oh I'm amazed at the clarity
Yeah I'm amazed at the rage in me 

Crushing
Crushing
Crushing
I'm getting crushed
From loving you too much 

You kissed her once
And you kissed her twice
Now I can no longer be so nice With the fury on my brow
It's all your fault jerk
What's that sittin' on your pant leg? 

Yeah now I'll sign this paper for everyone to see
And now I'm up here singing for everyone to hear
Now I'll sign this paper for everyone to see
Now I'm up here singing for everyone to hear 

You
Especially you
It's all for you
It's because of you 

My lungs are filled with smoke
Eyes light and hazy from too many tears
Red and glossy from too many beers
And my stomach shapes into one big knot 

Crushing
Crushing
Crushing
I'm getting crushed
From loving you too much 

Oh now let's stop hangin' around this lame town
Take another lookin' at your stupid frown
Looking down, down, down at the ground
Looking down, down, down at the ground 

And I'm amazed at the gamut??
Oh I'm amazed at the clarity
Yeah I'm amazed at the rage in me 

My stomach shapes into one big knot
