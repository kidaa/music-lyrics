She came down the staircase
Climbed into a dumpster
She grabbed an index card and she taped it to her forehead and it read
Poor white trash
She grabbed a gun, put it to her heart and pulled the trigger
Now she's dead 
It's just a thought
Don't you look at me that way 
Now they're talkin' to me and I'm talkin' back again
Now they're talkin' to me and I'm talkin' back again 

Sorry
Sorry baby
I'm so sorry
Sorry baby
I'm so 

I'm looking through a plastic bag
It's on my face
It squares my head
A little moist hot head sweat
Some little beads of brain
A little mind rain
It's just a thought inside my head
Those little voices, they're talkin' to me
Don't you look at me that way, that way 

Now they're talkin' to me and I'm talkin' back again
Now they're talkin' to me and I'm talkin' back again 

24,900 miles an hour to break away from this earth spin
So want me to start running right now
Right now
24,900 miles an hour 

I need a baseball bat
I'm gonna trash this office 
These people, they're fuckin' with my head
I can't move
And they left me here
Strapped to this bed 
It's another thought inside my head
Those little voices, they're talkin' to me
Don't you leave me here this way 

Now they're talkin' to me and I'm talkin' back again
Now they're talkin' to me and I'm talkin' back again 

Sorry
Sorry baby
I'm so sorry
Sorry baby
I'm so 

Oh how do I hear
In this little afterthought
And my little aftershock
Behind the cheerful stare
I wake up from the nightmare
And I just grew aware
A little too late
