Left you, jest you??Smoke screen in your shakey ground?? 
And I can rest my head
When I feel the need
It's just I'm not around 

So quit your crying
And your complaing
You got explaining to do 

I'm sick of trying
And I'm blaming
You got it coming to you 

So look at now baby
And all is coming in??
You wipe your tears 

Don't you pull this crap with me now
I've known you too many years 

Am I crying? 

Just relax
I'll knock you out
Here today
Gone tomorrow
Fly away 

Go play
Go play 

And I can rest my head
When I feel the need
It's just I'm not around 

So quit your crying
And your complaing
You got explaining to do 

I'm sick of trying
And I'm blaming
You got it coming to you So look at now baby
And all is coming in??
You wipe your tears 

Don't you pull this crap with me now
I've known you too many years 

Am I crying? 

Just relax
I'll knock you out
Here today
Gone tomorrow
Fly away 

Go play
Go play 

'Cuz when it comes around
It goes around, around, around, around 

And when it comes around
It goes around, around, around, around 

And it's never, never, never,
Never, never, never, never
Gonna stop 

And I can rest my head
When I feel the need
It's just I'm not around 

Never
Never
Never
Never
Never
