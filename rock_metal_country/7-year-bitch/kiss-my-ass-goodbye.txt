Well you could kiss my ass goodbye or you could sit and watch me cry
It don't make no difference to me
'Cuz I call you slime I call you scum if this is your idea of fun
Are you fakin' misery fakin' pain and then you walk away from blame
So get under my skin or on my nerves then you'll get what you deserve 
'Cuz I'm sick of the flappin' lips and the waggin' tongues
And the ears that {?} 

Now tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Something I don't already know 

'Cuz I'm sick of the flappin' lips and the waggin' tongues
And the ears that {?} 

Now tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Something I don't already know

And you can teeter on the punch line next to me

So get under my skin or on my nerves
