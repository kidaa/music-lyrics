Livin' life dealin' you've got feathers in your head
Pack up your home, pack it up and take your bed 
Now that I can see you're nothing but trouble
You slept like an angel, woke like a devil 

The history of my future's like a picture of my past
It's elastic, you can stretch it, and I snap 

I wanna believe, I wanna believe, I wanna believe
I wanna believe but I'm having trouble
You slept like an angel, woke like a devil 

If
If your gonna lie
Lie down
Down next to me
Don't lie to me 

If your gonna lie down next to me don't lie to me
If your gonna lie on top of me don't lie to me
SCREAM 

So don't talk about a feeling you will never understand
Just pack it up and leave and take the rings from my hand 

I wanna believe, I wanna believe, I wanna believe
I wanna believe but I'm having trouble
I slept like an angel, woke like a devil
