I know damn good and well
And I told all three of 'em to go straight to hell
I said damn, youre ornery
Good, I'm glad youre gone
Well we been trying for way too long 
So long
So long 

It was an affair
A moment
A singular event 

We're all adults here
We got the go ahead
And so we went ahead 

Don't let your emotions get in the way of a really good time
Don't let your emotions get in the way of a really good time 

They said you should know better
I said I do
I know the best
And perhaps my best
Is what you detest
