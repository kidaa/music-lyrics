You ain't got the right tellin' me I'm uptight
And I'm not obligated to give in 'cuz you're frustrated
No, my revenge is death, 'cuz you deserve the best
And I'm not turned on by your masculinity
Dead men don't rape
I don't have pity not a single tear
For those who get joy from a woman's fear
I'd rather get a gun and just blow you away
Then you'll learn first hand
Dead men don't rape

You're getting sucked into society's sickest
Don't go out alone you might get raped
But not by a dead man 'cuz
Dead men don't rape

You ain't got the right tellin' me I'm uptight
Dead men don't rape
