So you wanna go to bed with me
Why don't you climb in my head with me
Knew what I was thinking
Your dick it would be shrinking 
So you wanna go to bed with me
Why don't you climb in my head with me
Knew what I was thinking
Your dick it would be shrinking 

Oh baby you look great
And darling do you date?
Honey are you lonely?
You smell lonely to me
Yeah baby you smell lonely to me
What goes on in the mind of a man like you?
To make you say the things you do 

Yeah baby you look great

Baby you smell lonely to me
Yeah baby you smell lonely to me So you wanna go to bed with me?
Why don't you climb in my head with me?
Knew what I was thinking
Your dick it would be shrinking
