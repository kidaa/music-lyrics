Calling elvis - is anybody home
Calling elvis - I'm here all alone
Did he leave the building
Or can he come to the phone
Calling elvis - I'm here all alone

Well tell him I was calling just to wish him well
Let me leave my number - heartbreak hotel
Oh love me tender - baby dob't be cruel
Return to sender - treat me like a fool

Calling elvis - is anybody home
Calling elvis - I'm here all alone
Did he leave the building
Or can he come to the phone
Calling elvis - I'm here all alone

Why don't you go get him - I'm his biggest fan
You gotta tell him - he's still the man
Long distance baby - so far from home
Don't you think maybe you could put him on

Well tell him I was calling just to wish him well
Let me leave my number - heartbreak hotel
Oh love me tender - baby dob't be cruel
Return to sender - treat me like a fool

Calling elvis - is anybody home
Calling elvis - I'm here all alone
Did he leave the building
Or can he come to the phone
Calling elvis - I'm here all alone
