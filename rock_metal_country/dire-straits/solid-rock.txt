well take a look at that
i made a castle in the sand
saying this is where it's you know
couldn't understand now
if i realised that the chances were slim
how come i'm so surprised when the tide rolled in

i wanna live on solid rock
i'm gonna live on solid rock
i wanna give i don't wanna be blocked
i'm gonna live on solid rock

well i'm sick of potential
i'm sick of vanity now
i'm sticking to essential reality now
i don't know what's worse
try to make a silk purse
living an illusion living in confusion

well a house of cards
was never built for shock
you could blow it down in any kind of weather
now two solid rocks two solid blocks
you know they're gonna stick 
yeah they're gonna stick together

because the heart that you break
that's the one that you rely on
the bed that you make
that's the one you gotta lie on
when you point your finger cos your plan fell through 
you got three more fingers pointing back at you

i wanna live on solid rock
i'm gonna live on solid rock
i wanna give i don't wanna be blocked
i'm gonna live on solid rock
i'm solid rock now
