Where do you think you're going
Don't you know it's dark outside
Where do you think you're going
Don't you care about my pride
Where do you think you're going
I think that you don't know
You got no way of knowing
There's really no place you can go

I understand your changes
Long before you reach the door
I know where you think you're going you
I know what you came here for
And now I'm sick of joking
You know I like you to be free
Where do you think you're going
I think you better go with me girl

You say there is no reason
But you still find cause to doubt me
If you ain't with me girl
You're gonna be without me

Where do you think you're going
Don't you know it's dark outside
Where do you think you're going
Don't you care about my pride
And now I'm sick of joking
You know I like you to be free
So where do you think you're going
I think you better go with me girl
