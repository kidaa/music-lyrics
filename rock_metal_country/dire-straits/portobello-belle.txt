Bella donna's on the high street
Her breasts upon the off beat
And the stalls are just the side shows
Victoriana's old clothes
And yes her Jeans are tight now
She gonna travel light now
She's gonna tear up all her roots now

She got a turn up for the boots now
Yeah she thinks she's tough
She ain't no English rose
But the blind singer
He's seen enough and he knows
Yes and he do a song
About a long gone Irish girl
But I got one for you Portobello Belle

She sees a man upon his back there
Escaping from a sack there
And Belladonna lingers
Her gloves they got no fingers
Yeah, the blind man he's singing Irish
He gets his money in a tin dish
Just a corner serenader
Upon a time he could have made her, made her
Yeah, she thinks she's tough
She ain't no English rose
Ah, but the blind singer
He's seen enough and he knows
Yeas and do a song
About a long gone Irish girl
Ah but I got one for you Portobello Belle

Yes and these barrow boys are hawking
And a parakeet is squawking
Upon a truck there is a rhino
She get the crying of a wino
And then she get the reggae rumble
Bella donna's in the jungle
But she is no garden flower
There is no distress in the tower
Oh, bella donna walks
Bella donna taking a stroll
She don't care about your window box
Or your button hole
Yes and she sing a song about a long gone Irish girl
But I got one for you Portobello Belle
