Standin' on the corner of toulouse and dauphine
Waitin' on marie-ondine
I'm tryin' to place a tune under a louisiana moonbeam
On the planet of new orleans
In a bar they call the saturn
And in her eyes of green ain't somethin' that she said in a dream
Inside of my suit I got my mojo root and a true love figurine
For the planet of new orleans

New orleans, the other planet with other life upon it
And everythin' that's shakin' in between
If you should ever land upon it
You better know what's on it
The planet of new orleans

Now I'm tryin' to find my way through the rain and the steam
I'm lookin' straight ahead through the screen
And then I heard her say, somethin' in the limousine
Taking a ride across the planet of new orleans

If she was an ace and I was just a jack
And the cards were never seen
We could have been the king and the queen
But she took me back home to her courtyard
Where magnolia perfume screams
Behind the gates and the granite of the planet of new orleans

New orleans, the other planet with other life upon it
And everythin' that's shakin' in between
If you should ever land upon it
You better know what's on it
The planet of new orleans, with other life upon it
And everythin' that's shakin' in between
If you should ever land upon it
You better know what's on it
The planet of new orleans
The planet of new orleans
