she gets the sun in the daytime
perfume in the dusk
and she comes out in the night time
with the honeysuckle musk
because she smells just like a rose
and she tastes just like a peach
she got me walking where the wildlife goes
I'd do anything to reach her

and she was made in heaven
heaven's in the world
is this just expresso love
you know i'm crazy for the girl

she call me just to talk
she's my lover, she's a friend of mine
she says hey mister you wanna take a walk
in the wild west end sometime
and i get trouble with my breathing
she says boys don't know anything
but i know what i want
i want everything

well i feel so good cos i feel so good
and i feel so good cos it feels so right
i was made to go with my girl
like a saxophone was made to go with the night

and she can raise one eyebrow
put her hand on my hip
and i close one eye now
sweat on her tip
and i surrender to the fever
she love me so tender i got to believe her
love expresso love's alright

i don't want no sugar in it
thank you very much
all wired up on it  all fired up on it
expresso touch
hey maestro expresso
it's just another one just like the other one
hey maestro expresso
is this another one just like the other one
