les boys do cabaret
les boys are glad to be gay
they're not afraid now
disco bar in germany
les boys are glad to be
upon parade now

les boys got leather straps
les boys got ss caps
but they got no gun now
get dressed up get a little risque
got to do a little s   m these days
it's all in fun now

les boys come on again
for the high class whores
and the businessmen
who drive in their mercedes benz
to a disco bar in old munchen

they get the jokes that the d.j. makes
they get nervous and they make mistakes
they're bad for business
some tourists take a photograph
les boys don't get one lough
he says they're useless

late at night when they've gone away
les boys dream of jean genet
high heel shoes and a black berret
and the posters on the wall that say
les boys do cabaret
les boys are glad to be gay
