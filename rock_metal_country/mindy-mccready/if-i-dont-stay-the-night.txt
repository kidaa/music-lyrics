Sunny Russ
There's a warm breeze
Blowin' on the back porch babe
Listen close you'll hear the rain
The whisper in your voice is making me weak
Your love speaks my name
There are many ways I want to love you
But only when the time is right
Will the rain wash your love away
If I dont stay the night
Being here with you this way
I feel my soul start to break
Can't you hear the storm outside
Well its nothing like the thunder in my mind
There are many ways I want to love you
But only when the time is right
Will the rain wash your love away
If I dont stay the night
Longing for love I could compromise
But how would I be in the morning light
Pain meets harder as I close the door
And step into the night
If your love is real let it stay
If I dont stay the night
There's a warm breeze
Blowin' on the back porch babe
If your love is real let it stay
