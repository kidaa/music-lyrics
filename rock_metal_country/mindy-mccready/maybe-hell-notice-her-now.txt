Mindy McCready Featuring Lonestar's Richie McDonald
Tim Johnson
She wrote, ";I feel just like that painting collecting dust on the wall
And every day you walk right by me and don't know I'm there at all
And I can't think of one single reason why I should be hanging around";
She signed it, ";I hope that you'll miss me";, and she drove herself out of town
Maybe he'll notice her now, maybe he'll open his eyes
Sometimes it takes somebody leaving for a man to realize
Maybe he'll tell her she's the only thing that he can't live without
Now that she's gone maybe he'll notice her now
When he came home late that evening, he called her name down the hall
He saw the outline of the painting that used to hang there on the wall
And in its place on the nail was a letter, he read it out loud to himself
And the loneliness began to take over and for once he knew just how she felt
Maybe he'll notice her now, maybe he'll open his eyes
Sometimes it takes somebody leaving for a man to realize
Maybe he'll tell her she's the only thing that he can't live without
Now that she's gone maybe he'll notice her now
He called her up, he said I have been such a fool
She said I will come back and boy I still love you
Maybe he'll notice her now, maybe he'll open his eyes
Sometimes it takes somebody leaving for a man to realize
Maybe he'll tell her she's the only thing that he can't live without
Now that she's gone maybe he'll notice her now
I'm coming home, maybe you'll notice me now
