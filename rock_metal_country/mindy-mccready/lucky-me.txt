I'm not angry
Why should I be angry
I'll have another glass of wine
You're late an hour
Really whats an hour
In the larger scheme of time
Yeah you're right I don't deserve you
Yeah there's no pleasing me, yeah sure
You could have anyone you want
You're too good to be real
You're every woman's dream
Lucky me
Count my blessing
I shall count my blessing
Let me see where should I start
One, you're really handsome
Two, you're really handsome
Three, I never get that far
Yeah you're right I don't deserve you
Yeah there's no pleasing me, yeah sure
You could have anyone you want
You're too good to be real
You're every woman's dream
Lucky me
Shhh keep my voice down
I should keep my voice down
God for bid someone should hear
Oh I'm so sorry, really really sorry
Can you please forgive me dear
Yeah you're right I don't deserve you
Yeah there's no pleasing me, yeah sure
You could have anyone you want
You're too good to be real
You're every woman's dream
Lucky me
Yeah you're right I don't deserve you
Yeah there's no pleasing me, yeah sure
You could have anyone you want
You're too good to be real
You're every woman's dream
Lucky me
Lucky me
Lucky me
Lucky me
