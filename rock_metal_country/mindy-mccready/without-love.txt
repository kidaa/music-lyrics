Bobby got down on his knees, said ";Becky would you marry me";
He slipped that ring up on her hand
She ran home to show her mom, said ";Look here what I've got on";
That diamond sparkled on the band
She looked her daughter in the eye, said ";Girl you are so young
I just pray that in your heart you know that he's the one
'Cause without love it don't mean a thing
It's just a rock on a golden ring
You could take it down to an old pawn shop or toss it in the sea
'Cause without love it don't mean a thing";
Five years down a rocky road, Bobby had some doubts you know
He said ";I'm not sure I feel the same";
She packed up her old suit case, note said ";Bobby, here's your space
I can't stay if your heart's really changed";
He found the ring beside the pen and tears illed up his eyes
It read ";P.S., Don't you realize
'Cause without love it don't mean a thing
It's just a rock on a golden ring
You could take it down to an old pawn shop or toss it in the sea
'Cause without love it don't mean a thing";
He found her at her mama's house, said ";Girl you gotta change your mind
You were talking about your ring, but I'm talking about my life
'Cause without love it don't mean a thing
You're my rock, here's your golden ring
I'm begging you to take it back, baby now I see
That without love it don't mean a thing
Oh, now without love it don't mean a thing";
