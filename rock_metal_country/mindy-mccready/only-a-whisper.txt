You can paint our names on the water tower
For half the county to see
You can spend your money on billboard signs, honey
If you feel the need
I'll be impressed, but I like it best
When your love for me is
Only a whisper
Only a whisper
You can proclaim love from the top of a truck
In the middle of downtown
A 50,000 watt radio spot
Will get the word around
I'll be flattered, but the truth of the matter is
The most romantic sound is
Only a whisper
Only a whisper
You feel so good about it, you're bout to bust to shout it
Want everyone in the world to know
I like it when it's private
I like it slow and quiet
Baby, bring it to me sweet at home
I like it most when we're up close
And you let all that passion go
With only a whisper
Only a whisper
You feel so good about it, you're bout to bust to shout it
Want everyone in the world to know
I like it when it's private
I like it slow and quiet
Baby, bring it to me sweet at home
I like it most when we're up close
And you let all that passion go
With only a whisper
Only a whisper
Only a whisper, yeah, only a whisper
Only a whisper, only a whisper
Only a whisper, only a whisper
Only a whisper, only a whisper
