Once I had flowers at sunset, breakfast in bed
And I hated myself for what I never felt
I couldn't love him
And I had fire in the midnight
Passion that brought tears to my eyes
It was like a joke I couldn't get enough
But he didn't love me
I want to know why I can't have both
Someone that soothes my heart, burns my soul
Something that I can trust but can't control
All I need is someone who brings me thunder and roses
Thunder and roses
I want to be safe and warm
In a beautiful storm
With somebody who shakes me
And knows how to take me away from this world
Candles that burn all night
A lover that looks into my eyes
A man that loves me and knows how to touch me everywhere
I want to know why I can't have both
Someone that soothes my heart, burns my soul
Something that I can trust but can't control
All I need is someone who brings me thunder and roses
Something that I can trust but can't control
All I need is someone who brings me thunder and roses
Thunder and roses
Something that I can trust but can't control
All I need is someone who brings me thunder and roses
Thunder and roses
