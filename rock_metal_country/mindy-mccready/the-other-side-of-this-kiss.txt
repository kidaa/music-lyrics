I've got a feeling, call it intuition
I've got a feeling we're getting into something more
You've been talking telling me your secrets
Baby, that's just a crack in the door
I wanna know what's on the other side
Come on baby now don't be shy
I wanna know what's on the other side
Of this kiss, that look
I wanna read you baby, like a book
So close, to those eyes
I wanna know what's on the other side
Of this kiss
I got a vision, you and me together
I got a vision, wants to turn into reality
Show me your heart, show me your emotions
Show me parts of you I can't see
I wanna know what's on the other side
Come on baby now don't be shy
I wanna know what's on the other side
Of this kiss, that look
I wanna read you baby, like a book
So close, to those eyes
I wanna know what's on the other side
Of this kiss
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I wanna know what's on the other side
I wanna know what's on the other side
Come on baby now don't be shy
I wanna know what's on the other side
Of this kiss
I wanna know what's on the other side Of this kiss
I wanna know what's on the other side Of this kiss
this kiss, that look That look, those eyes
This kiss
