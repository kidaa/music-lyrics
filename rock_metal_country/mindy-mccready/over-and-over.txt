Time is a shadow
Life is a dream
The only thing that seems real baby
Is you and me
I'd think someday I'd feel this way
Now it's hard to believe
You touch my soul and I lost control
Whats happened to me
I'm falling over and over and over and over and over again
Just kiss me over and over and over and over and over again
I want you over and over and over and over and over again
The night is lover, the stars are glass
We come together
Shine on our path
Lost with you inside this room
In a million ways
Look in my eyes
Lets make this night go on for days
I'm falling over and over and over and over and over again
Just kiss me over and over and over and over and over again
I want you over and over and over and over and over again
Over and over and over and over and over again
Over and over and over and over and over again
I'd think someday I'd feel this way
Now it's hard to believe
You touch my soul and I lost control
Whats happened to me
Lost with you inside this room
In a million ways
Look in my eyes
Lets make this night go on for days
I'm falling over and over and over and over and over again
Just kiss me over and over and over and over and over again
I want you over and over and over and over and over again
