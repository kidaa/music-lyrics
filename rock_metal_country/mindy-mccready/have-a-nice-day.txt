Lynn Chater/Kerry Chater
She puts the coffee on the counter before he takes his seat
And slides the sugar closer to him, she knows he likes it sweet
And then she lingers with busy fingers waiting for his smile
They talk about the rainy weather, she's thinking all the while
What she wants to say is
";I could love a man like you, Oh how I wish you knew
I have seen you're good and kind, strong enough for two
You could sweep me off my feet and carry me away";
But all she says is ";Have a nice day";
They talk about how unemployment is finally coming down
The factory that's gonna bring some life back to this town
She wonders if his words mean more than what it really seems
And she's still looking for the courage to say just what she means
What she wants to say is
";I could love a man like you, Oh how I wish you knew
I have seen you're good and kind, strong enough for two
I'm more woman than I can show you in this old cafe";
But all she says is ";Have a nice day";
He winks once then he's gone, she's got time to kill
And in her dreams she's leaving with him, she knows some day she will
What she wants to say is
";I could love a man like you, Oh how I wish you knew
I have seen you're good and kind, strong enough for two
I'm more woman than I can show you in this old cafe";
But all she says is, all she says is
All she says is ";Have a nice day";
