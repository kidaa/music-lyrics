Mark Germino
If there was anyway out where I could slip away and take my heart with me
If there was anyway out where I could slip away and leave my mind at ease
'Cause if my head was on right you wouldn't be sitting here tonight watching me shakin' it
But if my heart was in tact you know I'd let you have the first crack at breakin' it
If you were anything less than what you are to me well I would have a reason then
For calling it quits instead of having these fits over where you've been
If the love that you stole wasn't still the best that I've known I wouldn't be takin' it
And if my heart was in tact you know I'd let you have the first crack at breakin' it
If my body didn't move every time my head didn't turn I wouldn't be thinkin' it, oh no
And if my heart was in tact you know I'd let you have the first crack at breakin' it
Oh, if my head was on right you wouldn't be sitting here tonight watching me shakin' it
And if my heart was in tact you know I'd let you have the first crack at breakin' it
