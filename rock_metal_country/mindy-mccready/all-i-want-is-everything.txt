Matraca Berg/Marshall Chapman
All I want is everything
On a silver platter, in a champagne glass
All I want is everything 
And that shouldn't be too much to ask
All I want is everything
All I want is everything
All I want is a Cadillac
The kind that Elvis drove 
He'll be riding in the back
You and me baby behind the wheel
All I want is everything
All I want is everything
It's a big ol world
It's a big ol world
Big enough for a pretty girl, yeah
All I want is all your lovin
To feel the earth move when we kiss
I don't need me a big ol diamond
Baby I'll take it if you insist
All I want is everything
All I want is everything
It's a big ol world
It's a big ol world
Big enough baby for a pretty girl
All I want is everything
All I want is everything
All I want is everything
All I want is everything
Ooooh yeah
