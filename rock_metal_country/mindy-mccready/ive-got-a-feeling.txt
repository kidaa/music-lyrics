I, I, I've got a feelin'
And I, I, I'm gonna hold you tonight
I, I, I've been dreamin'
Of holding your sweet body next to mine
Oh baby it's sure been a long time comin'
Oh take me to that place that you've got hidden
In your e,e,eyes dark and yearning
Time is given to desire
M,m,my mind is spinning   my mind is spinning
Thinking about what's about to be mine
Oh baby it's sure been a long time comin'
Oh take me to that place
The two of us just one heartbeat
Your love it's so easy oh, oh
I,I,I've got a feelin'
And I,I,I'm gonna hold you tonight
I,I,I've been dreamin'
Of holding your sweet body next to mine
Holding your sweet body baby
Holding your sweet body baby
Holding your sweet body next to mine
