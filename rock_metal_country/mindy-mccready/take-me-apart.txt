Hey thanks a lot for invading my life
Took a sweeter smell in those soulful eyes
You see into mine where I hide
I lost in you, it gets lonely sometimes
You really messed me up
You play with my mind
You keep me guessing most of the time
But baby you shake me
You know how to take me 
To all those places that make me crazy
Now I know how much you really want to 
But you hesitate, don't you?
Take me apart, shine in my heart
Steal my love see if I care
Take me apart
Here in the dark
Kiss by kiss
Finish what you start
Now I'll never be the same
So take me apart
Hey thanks a lot I'm feeling better
I feel like flying round the universe
You inflate my soul
You got me going
It feels like heaven when I'm in your arms
Now I know how much you really want to 
But you hesitate, don't you?
Take me apart, shine in my heart
Steal my love see if I care
Take me apart
Here in the dark
Kiss by kiss
Finish what you start
Now I'll never be the same
So take me apart
Now I know how much you really want to
But you hesitate, don't you?
Take me apart, shine in my heart
Steal my love see if I care
Take me apart
Here in the dark
Kiss by kiss
Finish what you start
Take me apart, shine in my heart
Steal my love see if I care
Take me apart
Take me apart
Baby steal my heart
Take me apart
Take me apart
Take me apart
