Kye Fleming/Mary Ann Kennedy/Deborah Allen
I can be tough, I can be tender
As strong as a saint, weak as a sinner
But when I'm in your arms I'm so complete
You bring out what's inside of me
A woman with a mind, a body with her soul
A heart full of love won't let go
I love the way you understand
All that I am
I'm a member of the modern world
But sometimes I'm still an old fashioned girl
You make me laugh and let me cry
I finally found a man who's not afraid to try
A woman with a mind, a body with her soul
A heart full of love won't let go
I love the way you understand
A woman with a mind, a body with her soul
A heart full of love won't let go
I love the way you understand
All that I am
Hold on as long as I can
And keep loving you with all that I am
A woman with a mind, a body with her soul
A heart full of love
A woman with a mind, a body with her soul
A heart full of love won't let go
I love the way you understand
All that I am
All that I am
All that I am
A woman with a mind, a body with her soul
All that I am
A heart full of love won't let go
All that I am...
