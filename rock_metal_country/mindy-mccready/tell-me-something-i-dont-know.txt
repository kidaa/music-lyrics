You say that you don't love me, well that's no mystery
I can feel it in your kisses and the way you look at me
You say lately you been thinking that it's time for you to go
Tell me something I don't know
'Cause I can't figure out why it all fell apart
And I don't have a clue just how I lost your heart
So make me understand why I still need you so
And tell me something I don't know
You say you've found someone who makes you feel alive
She made you a promise to love you for all time
Well, boy, I found your shoebox, I read the letters that she wrote
So tell me something I don't know
'Cause I can't figure out why it all fell apart
And I don't have a clue just how I lost your heart
So make me understand why I still need you so
And tell me something I don't know
I don't know what it's like to lie alone at night and toss and turn
And when it comes to pain it's plain to see I've got a lot to learn
So make me understand why I still need you so
And tell me how to let you go
And tell me something I don't know
And tell me something I don't know
