When I gave you my number
I thought you would use it
It's just a little slip of paper
Darlin' did you lose it?
I've been here alone waiting by this phone
But it ain't rang at all
Oh, baby, for a good time call
Oh, reach out and touch me
Don't you really wanna love me?
Seven numbers away
From this heart of mine
Do I have to write it on the wall?
Oh, baby, for a good time call.
Maybe we could see a movie
Take a walk and hold hands
I know a place that's got good music
Where we could slow dance
Darlin' if we do, I'll show you
What it really means to fall
Oh, baby, for a good time call
Oh, reach out and touch me
Don't you really wanna love me?
Seven numbers away
From this heart of mine
Do I have to write it on the wall?
Oh, baby, for a good time call.
Oh, reach out and touch me
Don't you really wanna love me?
Seven numbers away
From this heart of mine
Do I have to write it on the wall?
I'm pacing up and down this hall
Oh, baby, for a good time call.
For a good time call
