Al Anderson/Kim Carnes/Carolyn Dawn Johsnon
The one I love is knocking at my door
With the kind of look I never saw before
He said hey baby you and me
Nothin' like knowin' when it's time to leave
Took a listen to his advice
Thought about it once but I didn't think twice
I packed my life in a paper sack
Don't miss nothing that I never had
This old car's a limosuine
Ridin' on hope, livin' on dreams
Don't wanna know nothin' about readin' the map
We're makin' it up as we go
Final destination dont look back
'Cause when you're shootin' the dice you just tumble and roll
If we ever get lost we can use the stars
Right now we don't care where we are
Spin them wheels gonna get there yet
Runnin' down the road of no regrets
We got each other and that's enough
Ain't we lucky we got love
Don't wanna know nothin' about readin' the map
We're makin' it up as we go
Final destination don't look back
'Cause when you're shootin' the dice you just tumble and roll
Got each other and that's enough
Ain't we lucky we got love
Don't wanna know nothin' about readin' the map
We're makin' it up as we go
Final destination don't look back
'Cause when you're shootin' the dice
Don't wanna know nothin' about readin' the map
We're making it up as we go
Final destanation don't look back
'Cause when you're shootin' the dice you just tumble and roll
Tumble and roll, tumble and roll
Na, na, na, na, na
Tumble and roll, tumble and roll
Na, na, na, na, na
Tumble and roll, tumble and roll
Na, na, na, na, na
Tumble and roll
