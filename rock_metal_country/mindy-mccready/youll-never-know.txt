I bought a new red dress to lift my spirits up
And just like you did, honey, it cost me way too much
Next time you see me, I'll bet you'll take a second look
You'll wonder why I look so good
You'll never know how much I miss you, you won't see it in my face
You'll never know I'll never find another that could take your place
'Cause I'll be smiling when I see you, my tears won't ever show
Yeah, I might always love you
But you'll never know
When I saw you out last night, you seemed so surprised
That I could walk right by and not blink an eye
To look at me, you probably think I'm doing fine
Good thing you can't read my mind
You'll never know how much I miss you, you won't see it in my face
You'll never know I'll never find another that could take your place
'Cause I'll be smiling when I see you, my tears won't ever show
Yeah, I might always love you
But you'll never know
You'll never know how much I miss you, you won't see it in my face
You'll never know I'll never find another that could take your place
'Cause I'll be smiling when I see you, my tears won't ever show
Yeah, I might always love you
But you'll never know
You'll never know
You'll never know
You'll never know
