I can almost read your mind
It's running fast
Out of control
You're afraid of what you'll find 
If you get too close
You imagine I don't care
You see walls that just aren't there
You think I'm too strong to let you in
But that's just not fair
I'm not so tough
I'll call your bluff
And let you see a side of me
That wants you here
And cries real tears
And needs someone to love
I'm not so tough
I know that you've been hurt before
But so have I 
What can you do?
That doesn't mean you close the door
So stop blaming me
I'm not blaming you
I'm not some ghost from your past
The one who torn your heart in half
I'm not her, it's not my fault
Your holding on to that
I'm not so tough
I'll call your bluff
And let you see a side of me
That wants you here
And cries real tears
And needs someone to love
I'm not so tough
I'm not so tough
I'll call your bluff
And let you see
A side of me 
That wants you hear
And cries real tears
And needs someone to love
I'm not so tough
I'm not so tough
I'll call your bluff
And let you see a side of me
That wants you here
And cries real tears
And needs someone to love
I'm not so tough
So tough
I'm not so tough
I'll call your bluff
And let you see me
I'm not so tough
I'll call your bluff
I need someone to love
