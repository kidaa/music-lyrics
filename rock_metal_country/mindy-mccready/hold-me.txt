Monty Criswell/Lee Thomas Miller
Sometimes I burn just to taste your kiss
To hear passion call me by name
To make love to you the reckless bandit
And become new to the flame
Sometimes when I need to know how much you love
There's a softer way to show me
Love me in your arms
Hold me closer to your heart
Sometimes I just need you to hold me
You know the words to make me feel pretty
Lying there in the early morning light
I like it when you say you'd be lost without me
And I love all your reasons why
Sometimes when I need to know how much you love
There's a softer way to show me
Love me in your arms
Hold me closer to your heart
Sometimes I just need you to hold me
Hold me like a heart should hold ones soul
Hold me like you're afraid to let me go
Sometimes when I need to know how much you love
There's a simple way to show me
Hold me in your arms
Listen to the beating of our hearts
Sometimes I just need you to hold me
Sometimes I just need you to hold me
