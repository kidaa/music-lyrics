Tia Sillers/Mark Selby
Where I stand the sun is setting
Where you stand the moon is high
It's so strange to be here in the day
While you're there in the night
Wires carry your voice to me
I can hear you but you're out of reach
It's so hard to say goodbye
But darlin' when you fall asleep
Dream on, dream on
My love will hold you
So strong, so real, so right
I'll be there
Just close your eyes
I am yours until the dawn
Dream on, dream on
All the miles stretch out between us
All those miles I'd walk
I'd crawl just to touch you now
But this old world is not that small
So dream on, dream on
My love will hold you
So strong, so real, so right
I'll be there
Just close your eyes
I am yours until the dawn
Dream on
Dream on, dream on
My love will hold you
So strong, so real, so right
I'll be there
Just close your eyes
I am yours until the dawn
I am yours until the dawn
I am yours until the dawn
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on
