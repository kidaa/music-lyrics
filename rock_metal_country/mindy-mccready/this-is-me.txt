Everyone said I was a strong willed child
But I was just developing my own style
Why pay a price being independent
If the rule won't break I'm going to bend it
I'm soft like a woman
Strong like a man
Easy to love and hard to understand
This is me take it or leave it
My homegirl you better believe it
What you see is what I am and who I want to be
This is me
Never been afraid to speak my mind
Lay my heart out on the line
I've had my share of wrong directions
Ya but everybodies got a few imperfections
Spend alot of time getting this way
And baby im never going to change
This is me take it or leave it
My homegirl you better believe it
What you see is what I am and who I want to be
This is me
Why would I want to be anyone else
When it feels so good just being myself
This is me take it or leave it
My homegirl you better believe it
What you see is what I am and who I want to be
This is me
This is me
