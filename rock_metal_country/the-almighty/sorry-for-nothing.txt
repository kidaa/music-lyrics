I never listen to reason
Coz I got no reason to listen
Put your mind inside a bodybag
It's in a terminal condition right

[Pre-chorus:]
You love, hate and kill my time
Love, hate and kill my time
Now I want to rise and shine

[Chorus:]
Sorry for nothing
Why should I feel
Sorry for nothing

I believe deep down inside
You think you're Jesus fucking Christ
Point the gun, aim to please
Coz I know, you know, I know I'm right

[Pre-chorus + chorus]

I hope you're feeling bitter
I'm so happy I could die
You told me I could count on you
But I can't count that high

[Pre-chorus]

I hope you're feeling bitter
Sorry for nothing
