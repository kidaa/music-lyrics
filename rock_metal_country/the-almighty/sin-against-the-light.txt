[Warwick]

Anything goes when anything's free
You got something to lose child lose it on me
Soul vibrations in the neon light
Still burning from the city lights
What the hell is wrong with you
I did it every way that you wanted me to
With a lifetime and a little luck
Gonna show you how to love,
Show you how to...

You got a bad religion
And it's bringing you down
Love is hard to find
When there ain't no love around

[Chorus:]
Well it ain't no sin
Sin against the light
Well it ain't no sin
Sin against the light

She's my first, last and always child
Can't keep her down unless she's tired
Turn on the lizard king
Shut the doors in your head
You wanna crucify me for the love I've bled
Take it down easy
Take it down slow
And try to understand
That deep inside your soul

[Chorus]

Whisky bottles and razor blades
Lust for life starts to fade
Ain't breakin' no laws just breakin' on through
That sweet disease got a hold on you

Anything goes when anything's free
You got something to lose child lose it on me
Shout at the red eyed sky above
Love is the law and the law is love

You got a bad religion
And it's bringing you down
Love is hard to find
When there ain't no love around
Take it down easy
Take it down slow
And try to understand
That deep inside your soul

[Chorus]
