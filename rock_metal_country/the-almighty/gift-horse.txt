[Warwick]

I believe in givin' you my soul
'Cos when you shoot me down
You talk like an angel
I won't ask you any questions
'Cos I don't wanna know
We got something for nothing child
So don't let go

I want you
I need you
I know you got it child
I know you got it all

You're a gift horse comin' ain't gonna let it go no, no
Gift horse baby ain't gonna let you go no, no

Well you push me to edge of happiness
I want to fall into your soul
Tear your dreams apart
There's too many reasons for livin'
When you're in my world
This must be heaven on earth
Sweet child

I want you
I need you
I know you got it child
I know you got it all

You're a gift horse comin' ain't gonna let it go no, no
Gift horse baby ain't gonna let you go no, no

I want you
I need you
I know you got it child
I know you got it all

You're a gift horse comin' ain't gonna let it go no, no
Gift horse baby ain't gonna let you go no, no
