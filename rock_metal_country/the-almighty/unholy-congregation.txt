Into The Darkest Forrest They Go
Dressed In Black
Dressed In Coats
Women Of Evil Lust
Unholy Congregation
At The Darkest Hour
Their Torches They Light
Witches Hour
Infernal Silence
They Wait Before The Altar
Chanting Invocation
In A Blaze Of Fire He Stands
Some Horrid Shape Of A Goat
Each Of Them Pay His Hommage
Osculum Obscenum
White Skin Freezing In The Moonshine
Dance In A Circle
Wait For Turn
Wine Like Black Clotted Blood
Drink!!!!
