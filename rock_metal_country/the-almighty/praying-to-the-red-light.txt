[Warwick / London / James]

Soul free ghetto sister, shakin' loose
On a psycho holiday
Wilderness angel
She's comes to blow my cares away
You can't resist temptation
If you do then life's a bore
State of love situation
I'm the one who knows the score

Searching for some Lucy take me in the sky
Spirit of her love gonna take me high

[Chorus:]
Praying to the red light
Getting too far down the line
Praying to the red light
Getting too far down the line

Dirty punk with a rebel funk
I'm too young to be old
White trash love disciple
Too free to be sold
Untamed education searchin' for my space
Sex, religion, TV
This rat has won the race

I believe in love, I believe in hate
And lovin' ain't a sin so hell can wait

[Chorus]

Dirty little minds, dirty little money
Reeperbahn delight going down honey
I believe in love, I believe in hate
Sold in sin city you know I can't wait
You know I can't wait
To keep on...

[Chorus]
