[Warwick / London]

Ain't no use in running
'Cos I'll get to you
Ain't no use in praying
God won't see you through
I believe in nothing
So don't believe in me

We all have our sins, baby
Hold on and you will see

I don't want it
Make me bleed
No medicine man's
Got what I need

[Chorus:]
Everything's so free 'n' easy
Everything's so free 'n' wild
Everything's so free 'n' easy
My pretty one, I'll take you for a ride

Don't need no fire
To fuel my soul
There's enough bitchin' baby
To do it on it's own
And if I get too lazy
I don't need no shove
How did I say I believed in nothin'
When Lord, I believe in love

[Chorus]
