[Warwick / Tantrum]

God won't give me everything I want
They're always seems to be a price to pay
But when I look into your eyes
I didn't believe that much, no not anyway
It's only love
So just c'mon back
It must be easy
Like some ritual sweet child that we go through everytime
Some resurrection

Down on the streets I feel like I was born to lose
And no fire water could ever pull me through
Just like a lost soul on the wrong side of the tracks
Your can preach your Gospel baby 'cos I'm never comin' back
Because I've gone
I'm leaving here
And I can't get you
They can't get to me
They wanna kill me
Cover me in flowers

Resurrection
Resurrection mutha I feel her rising up
Resurrection
Resurrection mutha you're taking far too much

It's only love
So c'mon back
It must be easy
Like some ritual sweet child that we go through everytime
Some resurrection

Resurrection
Resurrection mutha
I feel her rising up
Resurrection
Resurrection mutha you're taking far too much
