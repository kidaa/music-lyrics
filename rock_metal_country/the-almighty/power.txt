[Warwick]

I'm chained in by the arms of God
It seems to me I cannot move
I sold my car for some free and easy
But in my mind they're out to get me

No one makes me feel like you do
Satisfaction's my reaction
Some bitch told me that she was easy
Sweet sixteen she tried to please me

Give me love
Give me power
Give me love and power
And give me freedom

I'm a savage boy no one can tame me
I run down alleys reach out to grab me
In the sea of love we're all just fools
There is nothing I won't use

Give me love
Give me power
Give me love and power
And give me freedom

Don't hold me back and let me run away
Don't talk so much when you've nothing to say
Just come with me on a highway ride
We don't go that fast 'cos our hands are tied

Give me love
Give me power
Give me love and power
And give me freedom
