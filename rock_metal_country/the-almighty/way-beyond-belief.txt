Open up your eyes
Get a little introspection in your life
Time to realise
What you have inside
Sometimes you've got to wear it out

[Pre-chorus:]
I'm not giving anymore
I'm not taking anymore
I'm not feeling anymore
I'm not guilty anymore

[Chorus:]
Take it way beyond belief

I don't need a reason
No matter what it takes
It's just another phase outgrown
Confront yourself
A change for the sake of it
Won't change anything

[Pre-chorus + chorus]

So just keep it out of reach and take it way beyond belief
What ever you think you need to take it way beyond belief

[Pre-chorus]

They say you got to live with what you believe
Am I living up to what you want me to be?

Open up your eyes - take it way beyond belief
Time to realise - take it way beyond belief
What you have inside - take it way beyond belief
I don't need a reason, I don't need a reason

[Pre-chorus + chorus]
