[Warwick]

Between the devil and the deep blue sea
That crazy woman put a spell on me
She said come closer I got something to tell
Got a heart full of soul and a soul full of hell
This crazy child will be the death of me
Better buy yourself some
Freedom 'cos it don't come free
Love flows like blood sweet angel dust
Pain leads to pleasure love leads to lust
She said...

[Chorus:]
Love only love,
Love is the devil's toy

She took me down in her soul asylum
She took me down
And she begged me to try some
Raises me up and we walk the sky
I kissed the flame of the fire in her eyes
God only knows and the devil may care
That love is my religion, love is my prayer
Lost in the darkness she was selling me light
Painful and beautiful hold on me tight

[Chorus]

Livin' on love and gasoline
Takin' me somewhere that I've never been
Losing my hold on reality
Give me deliverance, Lord deliver me
Sticks and stones won't break my bones
Can't bring me down when I'm alone
Love flows like blood sweet angel dust
Pain leads to pleasure love leads to lust

[Chorus]
