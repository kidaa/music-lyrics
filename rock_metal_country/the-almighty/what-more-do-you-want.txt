[Warwick / James]

I got a chip on my shoulder
You can't knock off
If you and make me run
I'll just walk
The system tries to legislate
Can't break the wings that we wear
Yellow brick road leads to nothin'
I don't care

[Chorus:]
If I bleed in buckets
Would I be your debutante
Tell me what more,
What more do you want?

Dollar signs are for the blind
You can't break destiny
You can take away my freedom
But you know I'll always be free,
You can all say that you love me
But love is just a four letter word
Talkin' bout me degeneration
Sounds so absurd

[Chorus]

If I dropped my disguise
Would you put up a front
Tell me what more,
What more do you want?

It ain't about the fortune
It ain't about the vice
As long as I got the groove
Then I'll be alright

Still got a chip on my shoulder
You can call it attitude
Long as you label me nothing
Then I've got nothing to lose
You can all say that you love me
But love is just a four letter word
And talkin' bout my degeneration
Sounds so absurd

[Chorus]

If I dropped my disguise
Would you put up a front
Tell me what more
What more do you want?
Power and glory
Freedom and love
If I got it all then
What more do you want?
