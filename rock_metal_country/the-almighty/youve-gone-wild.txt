[Warwick]

You got my love
Yeah, you know you got it good
But still you keep takin'
Alot more than you should
And that ain't right

You're one crazy mother
I can see it your eyes
You treat me like some dog
Now you don't want my love
You don't want my love

Do you feel it baby
Now you lost your mind
Do you need it honey
Before you go too wild

You've gone wild
You've gone wild
You've gone wild
You've gone wild

Lately I've been thinking
I've been thinking about you
But you're so far gone baby
I don't know what I should do, no, no, no

Tellin' lies to angels
Can get you what you need
But they can hurt you honey
They can make you bleed
They can make you bleed

You've gone wild
You've gone wild
You've gone wild
You've gone wild
