[Warwick]

Fire is the one thing
That sets you eternally wild
Across and empty room
I can see a God given beautiful child
Do you believe, do you believe
Do you believe in love
I don't understand these things that we say
Don't take me baby I gotta stay

Start me up now baby
Give me blood, fire and roses
Start me up now honey
Give me blood, fire and love

Tangled in my soul
Hey, I'm so confused
Like a blood red haze in front of my eyes
Take me and set me wild
Ain't got no solution
Ain't got no compromise
Don't put the blame on those pretty ones
Set my mind in motion yeah, that's what to do
There's no time to rescue you

Start me up now baby
Give me blood, fire and roses
Start me up now honey
Give me blood, fire and love

Yeah, you blow my cares away
I'm destroyed but I'm OK
This can't be happening to me
You've come to set me free
Now set me free child

Start me up now baby
Give me blood, fire and roses
Start me up now honey
Give me blood, fire and love
