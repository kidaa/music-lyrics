It makes no fucking difference
If it's all the fucking same
I swear to God that I
Don't believe a fucking thing

I don't want to sleep
3 A.M. knows my secret
I could have been anyone
But I'm just somebody I used to be

[Pre-chorus:]
Want this need this
Hate this love this
Needfreak
Want this need this
Hate this love this
Fuck this

[Chorus:]
I've been up for weeks
I have been losing sleep
On crank and deceit

I want you to feel this too
What makes you think I give a fuck
Well maybe I'm just paranoid
Am I paranoid enough

[Pre-chorus + chorus]

You know me better than I know myself

I've been up for weeks
I've been losing sleep
Dirt starts smelling sweet
Feeling obsolete
On crank and deceit
