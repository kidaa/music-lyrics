[Warwick]

You've got a sting like a scorpion
I'd like to see you try
You say that love is just a passing thing
It won't get you high
And you're one crazy mother
It's time to mend your ways
I'll put you on the streets with nothin'
Sit back and count the days

Take him
Take him to Detroit
C'mon and take him
Take him to Detroit

Everybody wants you
They want to break your back
Too much smack will bust your ass
Just get right out of here
I ain't no politician, I ain't no government man
But I've seen alot of shit like you
And I just don't give a damn

Take him
Take him to Detroit
C'mon and take him
Take him to Detroit

Lost souls in cheap hotels
Living in the gutter rattlesnakes eyes
Just a bit is far too much
You're gonna go crazy, you're gonna lose your mind

Take him
Take him to Detroit
C'mon and take him
Take him to Detroit
