You're the Jesus that didn't get nailed
Everyone loves a righteous cause
I got everything that I need to be free
I got masturbation and cable TV

[Chorus:]
I know, I know
I know you got a Jonestown mind
I couldn't change it if I tried

Another day in the life of a dead man
I hope you're happy now
You got no hope, but you got enough rope
Just to keep on hanging around

[Chorus]

Trained to drain
Why you can't explain
You're everything that you don't want to be
You're just chocking on your coca-cola
Chocking on your dreams

I know, I know
I know you got a Jonestown mind
You're the Jesus that didn't get nailed

[Chorus]
