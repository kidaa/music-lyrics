You, you're not justified
To take my flesh and blood child
And rape my pride

I, I got a holocaust in my soul
You tried to shape me
But I broke the mould

My beliefs flow like blood from a stone
As I fight to stay within the dream
That rusts inside your soul

[Chorus:]
Realize what you're giving me
Is feeding my addiction

You, love everything you're shown
It's times these you gotta
Keep us with the Jones's
Entertaining my ideas
I haven't felt this good in years
Shining on your crucifix
The love you preach
Is the hell you kissed

[Chorus]

Realize what you're giving me
Justify all your casualties
Realize I'm gonna break these chains
Justify, don't take my love in vain

[Chorus]
