[The Almighty]

Hey, sister I'm a wild one
Ain't got no time to play
Just like a hurricane pumping in your veins
I'll blow your cares away

I'm the God of lust you'd better believe
Here to resurrect your soul
Just give me a chance and I'll seek and destroy
Honey I can take it all

Full force
I'm a full force lovin' machine

Got so much that I wanna give
I'm possessed by the power of love
Oh I want to turn you on and there ain't no price to pay
Just lie back let the devil inside
Oh, and he'll start you up
We gotta grove down from the hips
This God damn machine will blow you bits

Full force
I'm a full force lovin' machine

Full force
I'm a full force lovin' machine
