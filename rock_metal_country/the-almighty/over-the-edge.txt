Seems like all your heroes
Dance among the dead
I used to want to join them
Think I'll live instead
Living seems so easy
Distorted point of view
Why won't you acknowledge
The hell that we've been through and

Change - Change
Change for the better
Change what you feel inside

[Chorus:]
You're pushin' me over the edge
You're pushin' me over the edge
You lift me up take me to the ledge
You're pushin' me over the edge

Life could be so easy
If you see things my way
Save me from tomorrow
Someday things are gonna have to

Change - Change
Change for the better
Change what you feel inside

[Chorus]

Grab a hold of the reins
Suicidal precision
Going down again Dead man's intuition
Another book that I almost read
When I flipped to the last page
The hero was dead

Life could be so easy
Reasons to my rhymes
Lovers came to heal me
And left me crucified

Change - Change
Change for the better
Change what you feel inside

[Chorus:]
You're pushin' me over the edge
You're pushin' me over the edge
You lift me up take me to the ledge
You're pushin' me over the edge
You're pushing me over the edge
Bleeding my soul killing my head
You're pushing me over the edge
