[Warwick / London / James]

I won't believe no resurrection
I won't believe no gospel train
I won't see the light thats never ending
I won't be coming back again
I live in hell ain't got no mercy
No guardian angel from above
Don't talk to me about religion
When the only thing I need is love

[Chorus:]
Got a love religion
It's my saving grace
And no holy roller
Can change the hand of fate
Got a love religion
Guaranteed salvation
Ain't no time for penance
No need to fear damnation

Maybe, I might just be a sinner
When I look around me that's not true
Maybe I'll never get to heaven
But I don't care 'cos I got you
Don't need no preacher jiving on me
Heaven knows I've had enough
Don't talk to me about religion
When the only thing I need is love

[Chorus]

Preacher, you say I don't believe
Cos hate and love is the only God I breathe
My pretty child your my serenity
You're my religion when everthing's unreal

[Chorus]
