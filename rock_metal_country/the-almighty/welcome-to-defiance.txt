Sometimes I feel like I'm almost damaged
Sometimes I get so hungry for tension
All wound up and nowhere to go
I just murdered another day

[Chorus:]
You got to go with what you know
Find the time to re-arrange
But you love to suffer in silence
When you know that you're
Welcome to defiance
Get up, get out and try it

Sometimes I get so sick of it all
Sometimes I feel like I've been branded
Wait a lifetime to get what you wanted
A stonewashed soul and a double standard

[Chorus]

Everything is crystal clear

A million failures a million tries
A million reasons to justify
I only wanted out of frustration
I guess sometimes we all get taken

[Chorus]
