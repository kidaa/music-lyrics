[Warwick / Tantrum]

Yeah, you're some kind of angel
'Cos your my kind of girl
And I wanna love you
I wanna give you my world
We got it all now
Yeah, it's feelin' alright
Take you down in the city
Lets kill the night

Lay down the law
You're my prisoner of love
Lay down the law
'Cos I can't get enough

We'll go cruise in your Cadillac
Now that the time has come
We'll do things my way
The revolution of love
We got it all now
Yeah, it's feelin' alright
Take you down in the city
Lets kill the night

Lay down the law
You're my prisoner of love
Lay down the law
'Cos I can't get enough

Give me the strength
Give me the power
To carry on with this game
To tame this wild, wils flower
We got it all now
Yeah, it's feelin' alright
Take you down in the city
Lets kill the night

Lay down the law
You're my prisoner of love
Lay down the law
'Cos I can't get enough
