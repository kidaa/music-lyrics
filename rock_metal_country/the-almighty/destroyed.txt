[Warwick]

She's got it and I want it
Yeah I want it bad
The way she moves across the floor
She's the sweetst thing I've had
I must be livin'
In a house of love
Sweet thing you move my way
And I know I'm hungry enough

Oh, I need you baby, Lord I need you now
Do what you want, do it anyhow
God it's too late to save me
'cause I'm already gone
I'm hooked into your love machine
Honey turn it on

She destroys me
She destroys me soul
She destroys me
Oh, and I want it all

The way you love me is so God damn reckless
Yeah, honey it's wild
But that's the way I like it
You can do it anytime
Just one look at your body
And I'm all shook up
Sweet child you move my way
And I know I'm hungry enough

Oh, I need you baby, Lord I need you now
Do what you want, do it anyhow
God it's too late to save me
'cause I'm already gone
I'm hooked into your love machine
Honey turn it on

She destroys me
She destroys me soul
She destroys me
Oh, and I want it all

Oh, I need you baby, Lord I need you now
Do what you want to, do it anyhow
Beat up Chevys kickin'
She kills me in the back
Just one look from you sweet child
Gives me a heart attack

She destroys me
She destroys me soul
She destroys me
Oh, and I want it all
