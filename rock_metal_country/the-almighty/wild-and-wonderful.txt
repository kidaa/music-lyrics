[Warwick / London]

I've taken all I can from the skies up above
I don't believe in God but I do believe in love
Don't tell me how to do it 'cos I don't need that shit
I've found something new and I'm fuckin' lovin' it

All the things I wanted I never could get
They're a little closer now but they're not mine yet
I'm on a jungle train to paradise
I want it all baby not those God damned lies
Drive me fuckin' crazy, won't you take me high
C'mon honey and show me something

Wild, wild and wonderful
Wild, wild and wonderful

I feel alright I got those good times blues
I ain't no fool won't stand for no rules
Baby let me show you something

Something that I learned, I learned out of school
Drive me fuckin' crazy won't you take me high
C'mon honey and show me something

Wild, wild and wonderful
Wild, wild and wonderful
Why do I feel this way
Sometimes I feel so alone
I've learned how to love and hate
But I've got somethin' I won't let go
No No No

Late at night when I'm lying in a haze
I think about her and all the things that she says
I think about sex you know it's on my mind
Give me some lovin'my sweet honey child
C'mon give me some lovin'

Wild, wild and wonderful
Wild, wild and wonderful
