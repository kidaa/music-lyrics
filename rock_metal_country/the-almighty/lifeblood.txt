Something's gotta give
Something's gotta give right now
You're so addicted to
Self-righteous indignation
Breaking the back of love
Then you bleed into temptation

Try and understand
That there's a price to pay
If you lust for life
You can't drain away my....

[Chorus:]
Lifeblood
Coz I'm staying high
Lifeblood
Burning in my veins
I ain't dying to die

Something's gotta give
A turned on revelation
In your blood-shot mind
You wanna save your life
I wanna spend mine

And your damming rivers
Tryin' to kill the flow
Your drowning sorrows
But they're sinking too slow in this

[Chorus]

I'd rather die on my feet than live on my knees
One nail drives another deep inside of me

[Chorus]
