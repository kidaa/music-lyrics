What the fuck is going on?
You've been high and mighty now
For far too long
And I know the reasons why
You saw too many clouds
And not enough sky

Hoe does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel to be a problem?

[Chorus:]
You stoned me to my soul
Like fucking for virginity
We don't see
Eye to Eye

What will it take to make you see?
That all the bones I picked with you
Belonged to me
So where the fuck are you coming from
If ignorance is bliss
You must be comfortably dumb

[Chorus]

[Chorus:]
You stoned me to my soul
Like fucking for virginity
We don't see
So just go forth and multiply
Coz we don't fucking see
Eye to Eye
