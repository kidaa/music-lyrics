Relentless we get born and raised
Relentless broken promises made
Relentless the days cut like razors
Relentless with no guarantee on saviours

Relentless everyone's addicted
Coz everyone's a victim
Relentless I've seen the movie
It did nothing for me
Relentless patience is a virtue
That ain't worth waiting for
Relentless I'll buy you a coke and sing
I'd like to teach the world to scream

[Pre-chorus:]
We're just dying to be like you
In this...

[Chorus:]
United state of apathy
Got no motivation
United state of apathy
Strung out on a diet of pure frustration

Relentless the voices in your head are calling
Relentless they don't tell you what you want to hear
Relentless another smoke on inspiration
Relentless to take you anywhere, anywhere but here

[Pre-chorus + chorus]

Freedom of choice or a choice of freedom
Paying the price for the cost of living
Sit up straight eat your Jesus flakes
All good things come to those you hated

[Chorus]

Relentless
United state
United state
United state of apathy
We're just wasting away
