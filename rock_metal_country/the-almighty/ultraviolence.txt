Don't give it all away
Don't give it all away
I tried to save myself
But you wrote me of anyway
When will I feel like I wanted to
What in the world has come over you
What in the world are we going to do

[Chorus:]
Nothing left to say
Nothing left to use
Nothing left to give
Nothing left
Nothing left to prove
This only gives me frustration
I pile it in my mind
I almost had a weakness
And you almost made me smile
It's just a small town life sentence
And I tried to drown it out, you're taking this the wrong way
And you think that it's alright

[Chorus]

I left this place the way I found it
Everything the same
When I was young I didn't know what I wanted
It's nice to know I haven't changed
Don't give it all away

[Chorus]
