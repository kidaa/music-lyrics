You're the unreal thing
In the safety of your own delusions
You preach it but you don't believe it
I never wanted to be what you needed
What gives
What gives you the right
Picking up the pieces
Until you get the rest of my life

[Chorus:]
Backbiter
You're the unreal thing

So have a toke and a smile
And ease your junkfood mind
Who needs entertainment
When the walls are here to climb

I knew
I knew it would come to this
I've been hanging on for weeks
By the skin of my beliefs
So come on and cut me down
You're just a...

[Chorus]

I'm not afraid of being wrong
I'm just scared of being right

[Chorus:]
Backbiter
You're the unreal thing
You can't beat the feeling
