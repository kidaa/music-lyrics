It's all so fucking pure
That I can see right through
Saw myself for the first time in years
With no room without a view

Well I'm not the only one spoilt by mistakes
How much damage do you think it takes?

[Chorus:]
Looking for a way out
Want to lose your skin
I got to move
Move right in

We're all out for a killing
Forgot the safety catch
Wipe the smile from my Irish eyes
And tell me it's a lack

So please don't try to do me any favours
It's just that sometimes life can make me nervous

[Chorus]

It's just a token of infection
That runs in the family
Accidentally born without a purpose
And just dying to be free

I was reaching down to pull myself back up
When all the time I know that I'm fucked

[Chorus]
