I never wanted
I never needed
I never begged
And I never pleaded
To a god unknown
That I won't let in
Cos religion is business
And there's money in sin

You're blind and offended
When reality hurts
But I've never seen Jesus
Inside a church
And I've prayed
I won't pay to be saved
Buying a brief burst of heaven

Immaculate deceptions
Going on everyday
Still you follow the clowns
Who give the circus away
Reaching for something
That's never been felt
And they're tightening their grip
On your bible belt

Dead eye disciples
Who sin too deep
Jesus loves you
But his love don't come cheap
And you pray
Yeah, you pray to be saved
Buying a brief burst of heaven

I never wanted
I never needed
I never begged
And I never pleaded
Pained by beliefs
Of lies and deceits
When cash must be shown
To this god unknown
And we pray
We're too frightened to stray
Buying a brief burst of heaven

Jesus loves you
But I don't

Jesus loves you
But I don't
Jesus loves you
Kill your idols

Religion induced insanities
Pained by beliefs
Pained by beliefs
That I don't believe anymore
