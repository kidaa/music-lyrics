It doesn't trouble me
So why should it trouble you
Save your roses for the dead
I'll lick the honey from your thorns
I'm feeling up
I'm looking down
My angels beat my devils
Now I'll lay my doubts in waste

What I believe
Is what I need
What I believe

Can't be convicted
By a rhyme without a reason
Someone always loves you
Even if it is yourself
Below my dick
There's neither truth or religion
My indignance has flown
To better things

What I believe
Is what I need
What I believe
Is keepin' my spirit alive

[Chorus:]
Give me
Give me possession

When will you learn to let it ride
You got no guts
You'll get no glory child
Your rusty soul bleeds Coca-cola blood
And you try to tell me
It's the real thing

What I believe
Is what I need
Is keeping my spirit alive

[Chorus]
