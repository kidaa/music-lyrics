I found it hard to believe
Got all caught up being freed
Everything that I had
You wrenched it out of my hands

[Chorus:]
Yeah, you got me wrong
You never even tried
To change your way of thinking
Now you better decide
Whose side are you on?

When the tension breaks
And lying's as natural as breathing
I'm going to invite you right down
To rise to the occasion

Why don't you say what you mean?
Why don't you show what you feel
Tainted by your own self doubt
Say you hate to leave, well let me help you out

[Chorus]
