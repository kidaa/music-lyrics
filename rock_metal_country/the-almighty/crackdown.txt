Maybe this would be easier
Second time around
But every time I bring it up
You try to bring me down

Find someone else to crucify
Coz didn't we have fun
Don't you know that a little pain
Never hurts anyone

[Chorus:]
Why can't you let it be
You're living all over me
Try taking a different view
It's good for me and it's better for you
Crack-down
Right now

So don't believe the powers that be
They're colour blind and they can't see
Can't understand what you can't kill
You always have and you always will

[Chorus]

This isn't the answer to anything
Love and damage

[Chorus]
