Darkness Entombs Us, As We Watch The
Mountains Before
Waiting For The Silent Wind To Bring Us The
Sign Of The Ancient Horn
The Bells Shall Chime As The Towers Burn
In Flames Of Eternal Hate
Burn In The Name Of The Elder Faith
Black Ravens Of War Raise Your Unholy
Banner
Again The Smell Of Blood Shall Drift
Under The Silver Moon
Chant Your Song On Northern Glory
Blow Your Horns For Northern Pride
Sing Those Songs So Long Forgotten
Hail Those Ravens That Once Died
