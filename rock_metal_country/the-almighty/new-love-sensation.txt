[Warwick]

We lost our souls jammin' up the sky
Some bad ass child taught me how to try
She blew my mind in every fuckin' way
Then she clouded my eyes and took my heart away

Sister love has come to set me free
Lord knows what it's doin' to me
Crazy little flower child
She'll take your love and set you wild

New love
New love sensation
We got a new love
A new love sensation

She's a mercy mother down on the streets
Gonna turn up the fire, turn up the heat
Drink from the fire 'cos I feel fine
Take it easy baby yeah, take your time

Feel the heat of the rising sun
This ain't '69
I ain't no angel baby
But I can set you free one more time

New love
New love sensation
We got a new love
A new love sensation
