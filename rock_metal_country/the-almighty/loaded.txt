[Warwick]

Loaded in the boulevard of broken dreams
White lightning soul serene
Can't seem to find my way
No I don't have the time
'cause I don't know the day

What you see is what you get
These things I do I don't regret

[Chorus:]
Gettin' loaded
Every fuckin' time
Getting loaded
Loaded down

Under my skin like a rose tattoo
This rose ain't red, man, this bitch is blue
From no mean city down to bullshit town
Going round in the underground

Outta sight and outta mind
I can't see that love is blind

[Chorus]

I'm just a crazy mixed up little kid
I never meant to do the things I did
Please believe me when I lie to you
I'm so far gone my soul's black and blue

Well I'm a hit and run problem child
I'm halfway to hell and still alive
Everything's free if you got the money
You can keep the milk I'll take the honey

What you see is what you get
These things I do I don't regret
Outta sight and outta mind
I can't see that love is blind

[Chorus]

Oh, I need you baby, Lord I need you now
Do what you want, do it anyhow
God it's too late to save me
'cause I'm already gone
I'm hooked into your love machine
Honey turn it on

She destroys me
She destroys me soul
She destroys me
Oh, and I want it all

Oh, I need you baby, Lord I need you now
Do what you want to, do it anyhow
Beat up Chevys kickin'
She kills me in the back
Just one look from you sweet child
Gives me a heart attack

She destroys me
She destroys me soul
She destroys me
Oh, and I want it all
