I feel uneasy
What you don't know can hurt you
Only lies behind your back
I feel infected, take another blast
Got a rosary of razor wire
And my future tense has passed

[Pre-chorus:]
There's too much nothing
To be left in so much doubt
Too much nothing's
Something I can live without

[Chorus:]
I need somebody to use
God I've tried so hard
I want somebody to bleed
Cos I'm so sick and wired

I feel uneasy
A kinda freedom's hard to find
No train of thought on
A one track mind

[Chorus:]
I need somebody to use
God I've tried so hard
I want somebody to bleed
Cos I'm so sick and wired
I need somebody to use
I get so uninspired
I want somebody to bleed
Cos I'm so sick and wired

Hiding the scars
Of my own intentions
So sick and tired
Of these soul pretensions

[Pre-chorus & chorus]
