Confidence broken
We fight for control
All my friends are hollow
And no one else is whole

[Pre-chorus:]
I'm not your anxiety
I'm not your anxiety

[Chorus:]
Stop taking, stop taking
Stop taking the easy way out

Caught me wide open
Take what you see
Tear the world to pieces
Dying by degrees

[Pre-chorus + chorus]

I'm not living for you

[Pre-chorus + chorus]

Stop taking the easy way out of this
