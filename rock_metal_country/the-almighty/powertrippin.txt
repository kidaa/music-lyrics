Temptation rising in my soul
I've been counting on my bones
Meet thy maker, time to end
They're playing Jesus Christ again

Gods, guns and gasoline
Coke adds life, conscience clean
T.V. babies, horsepower mind
Shooting up kills the time

[Chorus:]
I want something real
I need, I feel
Powertrippin'

Get the needle miss the point
Just say no! now pass the joint
Holyroller blown away
H.I.V. C.I.A.

[Chorus:]
I want something real
I need, I feel
Powertrippin'

Shine on
