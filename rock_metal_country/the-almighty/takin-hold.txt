Reading the bible in a cheap hotel
Am I in Heaven or a decadent hell?
I got the anti-Christ on my TV screen
Selling household gods that I don't need

Give me something I can hold on to
This love, hate, love I'm going through

[Chorus:]
Taking Hold
Taking it all the way
Taking hold
Taking hold of my beliefs

My culture clashed and it ain't no fun
Today I feel like I need a gun
Now the Woodstock nation's the Pepsi generation
If it kills me I'll find my salvation

I hope to God that my hope won't die
Am I just too low to high

[Chorus]

I love the things I used to kill
I hate the way I used to feel
I was lying through my teeth
Taking hold of my beliefs

[Chorus]
