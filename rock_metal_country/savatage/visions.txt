black is the night
Satan laughing with delight
he's calling you
to be a servant of his voodoo
when the hour strikes 13
listen to the spirits as they scream
your name

beware--guard your soul
Sodom is the place
you're gonna go
visions of hell, what a thrill

walls aflame
breathing deep
you seem in pain
a lake of fire
your resistance
starts to tire
when the day numbers one
you'll become one of his sonsbeware--guard your soul
Sodom is the place
you're gonna go
visions of hell

light is black
Satan starts his work of terror
look out--beware
when a pair of
eyes begin to stare
he knows which ones to take
God help me for heaven's sake

beware--guard your soul
Sodom is the place
you're gonna go
visions of hell
visions of hell many many times
