Well, I'm tellin' you All the things you would do
You know, they brought me down
I felt you slipping away And the look on your face
Never really made it

Now, I don't wanna talk to you
I just want you to get lost
Gotta get the message through
Straight to you
Gotta get the message through
Well, It's overdue

Now, the games you would play Are coming back to stay
Shouldn't play with fire
You thought you were cool But you're really a fool
And a classic liar

Oh, you are a tramp
I just want you to get lost

Gotta get the message through
Straight to you
Gotta get the message through
Well, it's overdue

Gotta get the message through
Straight to you
Gotta get the message through
Well, it's overdue

And now that you're gone You know it would have been wrong
To give a liar a second chance
You'll be forever the same I don't think you'll change
You need the one-night romance

Gotta get the message through
Straight to you, yeah
Gotta the message through
Well, it's overdue, yeah

Gotta get the message through
Straight to you, yeah
Gotta get the message though
It's overdue, yeah!!!
