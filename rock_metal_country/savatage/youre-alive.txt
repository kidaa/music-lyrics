So D.T. returned
To the ground he had burned in his past
And the press they all laughed
And they said it never lasts

But the crowds they came in
Just to see a man back from the dead
As he stood on the stage
The world echoed in his head

When you're skating on ice too thin to take it
You got to move fast or else you break it
So throw back your hair and feel the wind rush by

So people take care when you're chasing a dream in the night
That the walls of the past don't interrupt your flight
Never stop never turn
Never look never learn
So they say
But somewhere in time we all pay
For yesterday

When you're skating on ice too thin to take it
You got to move fast or else you break it
So throw back your hair and feel the wind rush by
And you're alive
