I really want to know
What you had in store
I couldn't really tell
Perhaps was just as well
I came here with a dream
And I just had to see
If my dream would soar
I knocked on every door

His whole life was written
Written there inside
His new weekly bible
The modern T.V. Guide
Every night he stares back at the screen

A man only sees what he wants to see
When he's in his mind
Where he is what he wants to be
Living in a world where he's safe from reality
Won't you take a chance on this night child
and follow me

Don't need no super heroes
Don't need no movie stars
Don't need no politicians
In big black shiny cars
Don't need no cowboys        [actually sings "Don't need no preacher who's
Smokin' Marlboro cigarettes                   Church is my T.V."

A man only sees what he wants to see
When he's in his mind
Where he is what he wants to be
Living in a world where he's safe from reality
Won't you take a chance on this night
And follow
Me

Once was a broken hero
The kind that we all know
The kind that hides inside us
The kind we never show
The kind we say that could never be me

His whole life was written
Written there inside
His new weekly bible
The modern T.V. Guide
Stare back at that screen

A man only see what he wants to see
