Squirmin', like a live wire
Vaporizing hard tire
Gonna take her down
Yeah I'm really gonna let this motor run

No brakes can't stop
In a ditch to the top
Just another junkie
Looking for a rush

Lights out
Runnin' 'gainst the devil
Shouldn't gamble with your soul
Lights out
Tables lookin' level
And you know you got to rollLook yeah look
Yeah she really makes your blood cook
Got you in a corner
Where you're doing things you never have done

You yeah you
Yeah she's got you like a big fool
Keeps you in a collar
Till it's time to watch you run

Lights out
Runnin' 'gainst the devil
Shouldn't gamble with your soul
Lights out
Never on the level
Still you know you've gotta roll
