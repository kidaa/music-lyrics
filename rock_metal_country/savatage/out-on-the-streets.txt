Far, far away I'd like to touch you
But you're not here today
And now's the time I need you most
I think about the days we were close
Baby I need you here.

I'm out on the streets alone tonight,
Looking for you it don't seem right
Baby don't you know I'm falling apart
How could you break my heart?Walking down the avenues
The ones I would walk with you
It's funny how the nights last so long
And with the dawn comes another day
Why won't you call me babe,
You see I can't hold on

I'm out on the streets alone tonight
Looking for you it don't seem right
Baby don't you know I'm falling apart
How could you break my heart?
