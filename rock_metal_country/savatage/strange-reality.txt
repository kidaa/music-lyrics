Who's this before me
Dressed in rags soaked in gin
A sign or a warning
Am I now where he's been

Am I losing my way
This strange insanity
An illusion away
Is this reality

Could that be me

Wake every morning
I don't know where I've been
All my excuses
Showing strain wearing thin

Am I losing my way
This strange insanity
An illusion away
Is this realityCould that be me

Another day
Another night
Another drink another fight
Somehow it's all the same
And so I'm staring in my gin
Never knowing if I'll win
And still I play the game

Look to the future
With the eyes of the blind
Can't see much further
Than this haze
In my mind

Am I losing my way
This strange insanity
An illusion away
Is this reality

Could that be me
