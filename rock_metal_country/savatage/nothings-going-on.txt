Cheshire cat
Done rip your soul
Don't turn your back
Don't turn your back

Car rolls by
Move real slow
Fade it to black
Fade it to black

But nothings going on
Nothings going on

Twisted nerves
On shifting feet
Taking up slack
Taking up slack

Gone too far
Can't retreat
Cover you tracks
Cover you tracksNothings going on

She's no queen of hearts
But she's good to me
Bring her coffin roses
Brush her thorns
Let it bleed

Just a hardcore dancer
Puppet on a string
One crippled romancer
Strung so tight
Gotta watch her swing

Nothings going on
