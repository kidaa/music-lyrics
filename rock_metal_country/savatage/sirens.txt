On the sea
They heard the voices sing
Through the storm
The island's closing in
They'd heard tales
Of lives lost at sea
Deserted beach just beyong their reach
You're approaching the island of the

Sirens
Sirens
Hungry for man tonight
Sirens
Sirens
Claiming the sailors' lives

Nine men made it to a shore
A night of terror
Lies neatly in store
Who are those women?
Are they real?
Is this just a crazy dream?
You're approaching the island of theSirens
Sirens
Hungry for flesh tonight
Sirens
Sirens
Claiming the sailors' lives

Terror happens quickly
Remains till the sailor are gone
They vanished in the night
Sirens singing their song
Whoa--till they're gone...

ALL RIGHT!!
