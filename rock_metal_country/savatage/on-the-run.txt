Ow! My legs are breakin', can't take no more
Six days in a haze, locked behind a door
Searchlight on my trail, I hear the sirens wail
Footsteps close behind, they're after me now

Moonlight lights the way to a clearing up ahead
____light through the trees, the hunter flees again
How long can I run? I feel it's just begun
Nowhere left to hide, they're gaining on me

Oh, on the run, oh, on the run, run, run

I can't run anymore, they move this way too fast
Finally caught up to me, a victim of my past
I feel them closing in, the bad guy just didn't win
I will not go back, I'm still on the run

Oh, on the run, oh, on the run, run, run, run, run, run
