He never closed his eyes
Or so we theorized
But we were young and bold
And he was mostly old
And his time nearly done

He came back from a war
On some forgotten shore
And sat and watched the world
And never said a word
And so I asked for one

Watching waiting
Old man tell me what have we become
Anticipating
All the hating that was yet undone
He turned around and stared into the sun

He fought for things so clear
And never thought he'd fear
A brother or his child
Or killing having style
Watch the colors runWatching waiting
Old man tell me what have we become
Anticipating
All the hating that was yet undone
He turned around and stared into the sun

And now he only hears
And his eyes they only tear
So tread most carefully
For he's still listening
Watch the colors run

Watching waiting
Old man tell me what have we become
Anticipating
All the hating hat was yet undone
He turned around and stared into the sun
