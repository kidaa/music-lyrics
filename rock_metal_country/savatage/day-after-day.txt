I remember finding out about you
Every day my mind is all around you
Looking out of my lonely room
Day after day
Bring it home, baby make it soon
I give my love to you

I remember holding you while you sleep
Everyday I feel the tears that you'd weep
Looking out from my lonely gloom
Day after day
Bring it home, baby make it soon
I give my love to you

Looking out of my lonely room
Day after day
Bring it home, baby make it soon
I give my love to youI remember finding out about you
Everyday my mind is all around you
Looking out of my lonely room
Day after day
Bring it home, baby make it soon
I give my love to you

Day after day Day after day Day after day
