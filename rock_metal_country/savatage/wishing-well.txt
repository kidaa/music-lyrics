Take off your hat, kick off your shoes
You know you ain't going anywhere
You spend all your time singing your blues
You know you ain't going anywhere

You've always been a good friend of mine
Your heart it bids farewell
The only time you're satisfied
Is with your feet in the wishing well

Throw down your gun, you might shoot yourself
Or is that what you're trying to do?
Put up the fight you believe to be right
And one day the sun will shine through

You've always got something to hide
Something you just can't tell
The only time you're satisfied
Is with your feet in the wishing well, yeahYou know what you're wishing for
Love in a peaceful world
Love in a peaceful world
Love in a peaceful world, yeah

You've always been a good friend of mine
Your heart it bids farewell
The only time you're satisfied
Is with your feet in the wishing well, yeah

No, everybody has a dream, yeah
Oh no, no, no, oooh
I wish you well, yeah
I know, know
All you're looking for is love
