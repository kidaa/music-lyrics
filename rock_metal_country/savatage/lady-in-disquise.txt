She's not what she seems
A vision in my dreams
Face to face, she does appear quite strange
But I want her, I need her
Forever, I want to be with her
She's got my heart and my soul
I look beyond her crystal eyes,
The lady of a thousand smiles
I walk the endless mile

Ooh, lady in disguise You're keeper of the sky
Ooh, lady - lady in disguise

I've been searchin' for a lady like you
Searching my whole life through
The mystery she holds, I need to know
I'll find you someday,
Our paths, I'm sure, will cross
Are you the woman I can trust?
I look beyond her crystal eyes,
The lady of a thousand smiles
I walk the endless mile

Ooh, lady in disguise You're keeper of the skies
And Ooh, lady - lady in disguise

Oooh, lady, oooh Lady - lady - lady in disguise Oooh, lady - oooh, lady
Lady in disguise Oh, lady - oh, oh Lady - lady - lady in disguise Oh, oh -
oh! Lady in disguise Oooh, lady - lady - oh! Lady in disguise Oh. . .
