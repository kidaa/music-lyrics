Do you suffer
From the fears of growing old
Do you wonder
What might happen to your soul

There is a magic place
That just might solve your case
And it's just a mystery to the mind

The fountain of youth
That's where we might find the truth
It's gonna put your
Head in a rush
And the science is working on us

Ponce DeLeon
In the search for the gold
Indian tales
Never growing old
By the walls and the springs
Hear a voice of yesterday sing
It's just a mystery to the mind, yeahThe fountain of youth
That's where we might find the truth
It's gonna put your
Head in a rush
And the science is working on us

It is part of the power
Power of the night
It's where the sun beats down on the ?
As they're trying to get it right
In tales a magic place
I saw the vision of a face
It solved the mysteries in my mind
Yeah

The fountain of youth
That's where we might find the truth
It's gonna put your
Head in a rush
And the science is working on us
