Hey You
She's gonna get you
If you go walking by this corner slow
Don't think she's gonna let you leave
Just because you want to go

Boy you ain't seen nothin' yet
It's a long train of regret
Puppets get no second chance
Pull that string they gotta dance

Parallel addiction is a double crucifixion
When your always out there feeding your head
Always channel surfing cause your brain it isn't working
When you're looking at that moment just remember

Don't look
Don't stray
Don't talk it over
No time
No way
Listen to me I'm cold sober
You're just out there taunting Cobras

Hey you
Who's gonna warn you
When it's something you don't want to know
Don't think
It won't deform you
Twist your mind then let it go

Boy you ain't seen nothin' yet
It's a long train of regret
Puppets get no second chance
Pull that strings they gotta dance

Welcome to the prison
Let me tell ya what you're missing
I've been coming here for nearly a year
Out there was my corner
Till I came in for a water
Mixed with Whiskey
And a chaser of sideway glances

Don't look
Don't stray
Don't talk it over
No time
No way
Listen to me I'm cold sober
You're just out there taunting Cobras
