She's so tough
You better not try to rough her up
She'll slap you in the face
She struts off to grace
A heavy night of rock 'n roll
Killer, lady, child
Driving me wild

She's only rock 'n roll
She's only rock 'n roll
She's only rock 'n roll, yeah
Only rock 'n roll

Oooh, when she's bad she's bad
A teasing whisper in the ear will drive you mad
She'll get hot on the spot
She'll give you what she's got
If you can make the right connection
Killer, lady, child
Driving me wildShe's only rock 'n roll
The lady - She's only rock 'n roll
Oh, She's only rock 'n roll
Only rock 'n roll, yeah

She's only rock 'n roll
She's got the music in her soul
She loves it when it's loud
Loves to mingle with the in crowd
This woman's got style
Killer, lady, child
Driving me wild

She's only rock 'n roll
No, She's only rock 'n roll
The lady - She's only rock 'n roll
Oh no - She's only rock 'n roll, yeah
