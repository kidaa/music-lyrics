Somewhere on that long empty road
We all stand lone
Searching for clues
From our different views

In the dark I call out your name
It echoes in vain
Over again
In an empty room

Chorus

And if I go away
What would still remain of me
The ghost within your eyes
The whisper in your sighs
You see
Believe
And I'm always thereStaring down a long empty hall
Pictures on walls
All with your name
But it's not the same

Searching for a chord I can't hear
Been searching for years
It's somewhere inside
But it's well disguised

And if I go away
What would still remain of me
The ghost within your eyes
The whisper in your sighs
You see
Believe
And I'm always there
