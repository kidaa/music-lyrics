I've been here since eighty-one
That's a long time
And I've seen
All there is here to see

Had a space on Astor place
Had it all once
Now there streets
Are my reality

You see
New York City
Don't mean nothing
Just a good place when you're running
Light that cut so bright they make you bleed

Neon children live their lives there
Mad magicians tinsel nightmares
Still you know I'm never gonna leave

Never sleep alone on the subways
Never walk alone on the tracks
Never take a ride to the edge of your mind
Not unless you have a ticket back
Don't believe in T.V. preachers
Don't believe in talk show stars
Never follow trends if they turn on your friends
Just to be sure you know who your friends areAnd if you're running blind
On a refueled mind
Better watch the time
And careful you don't go too far

Never burn the bridges before you
If you've burned the bridges behind
And never burn the one that you're walking upon
Or you're sure to hit the water in time

Don't believe in expectations
Don't believe in shooting stars
And if you make a stand on a dead empty hand
Never let them see your cards

And if you're running blind
On a refueled mind
Better watch the time
And careful you don't go too far
