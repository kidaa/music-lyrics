I haven't thought about you for a while
It seemed so far away
I keep your pictures hidden in a file
Of favorite one act plays

Like pieces of myself
Cut off in desperation
As offerings to thee
I keep them on a shelf
They're good for conversation
Over a cup of teaI put it all down in a letter once
A letter I don't send
It made me feel much better at the time
I thought it helped me mend

The pieces of myself
Cut off in desperation
As offerings to thee
I keep them on a shelf
They're good for conversation
Over a cup of tea
