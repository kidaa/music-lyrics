I've been let loose on the town tonight
Out of control don't need no more
I'm feeling mean dressed in leather
It's a screamer

City nights
Trashing all the sites
When will this night come to end

Washed out Washed out
Washed out Washed out
Washed out Washed out
AlrightAll the king's horses
And all the king's men
Could never put me back together again
I guess the action wins
How could this all begin?

It is time for just one more line
When will this night come to end
Washed out Washed out
Washed out Washed out
Washed out Washed out
I'm washed out

It is time for just one more line
When will this night come to end
Washed out Washed out
Washed out Washed out
Washed out Washed out
Washed out
