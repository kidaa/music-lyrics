A solitude of horror in his hours off guard
Nature took her hideous revenge
Out of the black abyss came
the creeping madness that was his other self

Hyde, Hyde

A good man to evil
From the potion on the table
Sampled by mistake
But now it's far too late
A cause for alarm
He can do you harm,
Man into beast Prepares for his feast

Hyde,HydeStalking the neon city
Standing in the shadow's
Crimes of wrong nature on the twisted mind
Black satin cape
Eyes of insane fire
Lurking in the darkness
A killer on permanent hire

For some he's but a tale
For others just a legend
Madness, myth and magic
Worth a warning mention
The change has taken place
Running from mankind
He may be after you
In his other state of mind

Standing in the shadows
Stalking the neon city
Crimes of wrong nature on the twisted mind

So if you care to wander
In a chemical adventure
It might be a mistake
The one you shouldn't make.
