In circles the winless fall
Head trapped between the wall
Sonic blast right through their ears
Iron curtain the mighty will fall
Visions on a crystal ball
Sorry tales of days gone past
Living for the night
Living for the night

Just a thought
Before your mind is lost
Do you know who you are?
Criminal days
Life trapped inside a maze
And little children can't go out
Living for the night
Living for the night

Out of touch
Out of control
You watch the metal roll
You play the part
Just oh so well--AH!!Like a torch
Without a flame
A pleasure victim of pain
You're caught inside
And can't get out

Living for the night!!!
Living for the night!!!
Living for the night!!!
Living for the night!!!
Living for the night!!!
