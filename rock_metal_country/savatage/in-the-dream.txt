can you hear me call your name
I'm not far away
I think of you
Somehow you drifted far away from me
I can't explain

In the dream
You're all I see
In the dream
Is where I'll be

With no one by my side
The tears in my eyes
I dream of you
Could you ever feel the same
I think you canIn the dream
You're all I see
In the dream
Is where I'll be
In the dream

You're all I see
In the dream
Is where I'll be

In the dream
In the dream
In the dream
In the dream
In the dream
In the dream
