Nighttime again
Seems I'm my only friend
Wander the streets all alone
The lost in search of his own

Once again I've played the clown
Used my friends to let him down
Walk the streets just staring out
'Cause in the dark the strange come out

Time and time and time again
I'm just looking for a friend
But no one seems to be around
Except this monkey that I've found
Still he is my only friend
And tonight he grins again

Something cold as pain
Burning inside my veins
I walk away
A shadow of Dorian GrayOnce again I've played the clown

Used my friends to let them down
Walk the streets just staring out
'Cause in the dark the strange come out

Time and time and time again
I'm just looking for a friend
But no one seems to be around
Except this monkey that I've found
Still he is my only friend
And tonight he grins again
