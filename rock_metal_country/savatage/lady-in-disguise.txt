She's not what she seems
Just a vision in my dreams
I wonder why
Face to face she appears quite strange
Never ever got her name
I'm a fool inside

Her eyes cried lady in disguise
Lady in disguise

I knew from the moment I saw her face
To the edge of the world I would chase her again
And when I'm out walking the town
There's never a doubt that she'll be around with another guy

Her eyes sighed, lady in disguise
Lady in disguise

I was captured from the start
Bodies touching heart to heart
I was holding her for long
Then I woke and she was gone
Then a voice called from the night
I'm still into the night

I sat up in my bed
Sweat was running off my head
This must have been a dream
It took me a while, then I realized
I still could feel her crystal eyes haunting me

I died, lady in disguise
Lady in disguise

Lady in disguise
Why, why
