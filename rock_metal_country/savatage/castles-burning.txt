In the dark and bleeding
With the shadows seething
There he stands alone

Fools and faith conspire
Questions of desire
That they never owned

Kings without their armor
Men without their honor
Spit out desecration
Pieces of a nation
Buried in the ground
Screams without a sound
Burn the castle down

In the end the children cried
That the jackal surely lied
When he said please listen all
Do not look behind these walls

Coffins drowned in roses
And the war he chose is
Fought inside the mind
Death becomes compelling
When the soul's for selling
And the world is blindIn the maze he wanders
Looks about and ponders
Shadows mock and taunt him
And the ghosts that haunt him
Chain him to the ground
Screams without a sound
Burn the castle down

In the end the children cried
That the jackal surely lied
When said please listen all
Do not look behind these walls

And does the pendulum toll
Against the side of he soul
When if feels the final moment is near

Do you rage against the dark
Try to re-write the part
Turn around and face what you fear
What you fear

He's seen it all before
Close your eyes and close the door
And the dreams that nights embrace
Slowly leave behind a trace
