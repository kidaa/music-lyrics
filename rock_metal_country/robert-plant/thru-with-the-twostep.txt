Dance by me close Tell 'em, all to go
Once for the money But I'm, through with the show
An' move with me gently, Oh so slow
Hold me and maybe, oh, We'll never let go
Never let go
I'm through with sneakin' Been cutting it close
Through with the two-step, Oh Where the rhythm is lost
Through with the two-step Where the rhythm is lost
Oh, yes, it's love in any key
You opened up the door Now I know, it's got to be
Now my cards on the table, Hands on the deck [Hands opened up]
Now ";A"; is for able, All words spoken right [Oh, pause for breath]
My willing baby, now can't you see Little girl, it's not for me.
So you waltzed into my life, One two three
Warmth of your smile Oh, let it please be me,
Please let it be me You switch and swirl,
Oh, swing and sway
Stay till the sun comes, and, don't go away
Stay till the sun comes, and, don't go away
Stay till the sun comes, and, don't go away
Don't go away, don't go away, aah
It might be cozy baby, please don't go now
And it's buy me, don't buy me baby, baby
Please don't go, oh
Oh, don't go away now baby
And it's bye, me, baby now please don't go away
And it's bye, now baby, baby
Baby, please don't go.
