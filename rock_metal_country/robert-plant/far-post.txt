No talk of love between us some things better left unsaid
talk of the plans through my head, through my head
No talk of tears and pain it's been so long I really don't know your name
it's the rules of the game
Wheels keep a turning round and round
years keep a spinning round and round
No words assuring without a trace like the shadows in the sun.
No room for fools who rush it's all been done.
You've got new friends in new pools and you know they're putting troubles to the vote.
Tied eyes, slow dance in the sunlight it's all a joke.
Wheels keep a turning round and round
years keep a spinning round and round
With the passing of your time, though you seldom come to mind
I remember the day
Sure as winter follows fall, sure as maybe I will call, just remember the day.
Far off the hazy day long gone the lingered glance
Chill winds blow cold around the fire of love
Farewell the call to arms, release the captive heart
time's keeper clouds the skyline of the last resort.
Wheels keep a spinning round and round
years keep a spinning round and round
With the passing of your time, though you seldom come to mind
I remember the day
Sure as winter follows fall, sure as maybe I will call, just remember the day.
