From Chris Warren's Robert Plant site used with permission This is the English part of the lyric sung by Robert Plant
From my island home I feel a chance
Kiss the tide - goes time and circumstance
Give me peace of mind and let me dance
Bury all my pain of years beneath the sand
On my heels these wings I gladly wear
Laugh into the face of anger and despair
Give me peace of mind and let me dance
Bury all my pain of years beneath the sand
