Ooh, ho-hold me Ooh, hold me
I know I used to run around
Now I'm swear I've settled down
May-maybe what they say is true
All those things I've done to you
People say that I don't change
The song still remains the same
Oh but I got what your needing so
Oh, come on hold me tight and don't let go
Oh no, don't start saying good-bye to me
Don't start saying, oh no Good-bye to me
I only heard a thing or two .... I only hurt when I'm around
Oh that's just I'm feeling down At night I ... I do I ... up to you .....
Oh come on, hold me tight and don't let go
Oh no, don't start saying good-bye breaking my heart
Oh no don't start saying, good-bye breaking my heart
Oh, ho-ho-hold me 
When I tell you that I know that I know
When I tell you that I care
When I tell you that I love you
When I tell you 'bout it anywhere
When I tell you 'Bout what it could be like oh
when I tell you that, When I tell you that,
When I tell you that, when I tell you that
When I tell you that, when I tell you that
When I tell you bout what could be like
Oh, when I tell you that, you know you really wanna know.
At night ... What you got is what you need Ah ..
but I got what your needing so
Come on, hold me tight and don't let go
Oh no, don't start saying good-bye breaking my heart
Oh no don't start saying, good-bye breaking my heart
Oh no, don't start saying good-bye to me Oh no don't start saying
