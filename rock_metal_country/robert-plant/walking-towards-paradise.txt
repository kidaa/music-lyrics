Hearts on fire Mmm, burning fast
Love, desire Oh make sweet love last
This one we'll sing now
Soon you'll finally see All this mystery
Oh, wouldn't it be nice Ooh, wouldn't it be nice
Walking towards paradise Walking towards paradise
On days like this Nights confirm
You know so much So much to learn
Soon you'll finally see All this mystery
Now, wouldn't it, wouldn't it, wouldn't it be nice
Oh, wouldn't it be nice Oh, wouldn't it be nice
Let's go walking towards paradise
Walking towards paradise Walking towards paradise
When I'm six-six-six-sixteen Walking towards paradise
Ooh yeah Now come on, come on, come on
Oh-oh, yeah Walking towards paradise
Come with me, now come with me, come with me,
now come with me Walking towards paradise
We've started Uh-uh Uh-uh Walking towards paradise
Walking towards paradise Oh yeah Walking towards paradise
Walking towards paradise Ah-ha Walking towards paradise...
