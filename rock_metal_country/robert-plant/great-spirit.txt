Great Spirit come, Great Spirit come
Who has chased away the moonbeams?
Who has pulled a blanket across the sky?
Who will sing in celebration
Throughout this land that's bound to die?
Oh - that's bound to dies.
Great Spirit come, Great Spirit come
Who will put an end to all this sadness?
Who hears the Earth that cries beneath the burning rain?
All truth reduced to piles of greed and madness
The accident remains the same
Great Spirit come Oh - Always the same
Great Spirit come Mm, said it's alright, seems okay
Robbery and evil and the stealing
From the body and the mind for the healing
Of the spirit and the pride and the will and the will of the land
Grace, courage, honesty and love
Grace, courage, honesty and love
There's evil, there's evil, there's evil going on
Great Spirit come, Great Spirit come
I love my brother, I must share the seed
That falls through fortune at my feet
The Fate of Nations and of all their deeds
Lies trapped inside these hearts of greed,
Ooh - oh, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Great Spirit come, Great Spirit come
Great Spirit come, Great Spirit come
Come on, come on, come on
Great Spirit come, Great Spirit come
Ooh yeah. Ooh yeah,
Grace, courage, honesty and love
Grace, courage, honesty and love
Great Spirit come, Great Spirit come
Come on, come on, come on ...
The will of the land
Great Spirit, Great Spirit come
The will of the land
Ooh, we'll sing in celebration
Ooh, we'll sing in celebration
Ooh, we'll sing in celebration, celebration
Sing in celebration, now now now now Sing in celebration
