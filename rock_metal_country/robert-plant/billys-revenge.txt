Oh-oh, oh Oh-oh, oh Oh-oh, oh Oh-oh, oh Oh-oh, oh Oh-oh,
oh Billy and Jenny will never get old
That's the kind of love in a story untold
Kisses are burning, an' touch's so hot
Crazy with lovin'
Wide as the sky and deep as the ocean
Crazy with love and wild devotion
Feeling went cool when the touching stopped Crazy with lovin'
She's been looking for someone He's been looking for someone
Ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh, trouble gonna come someday Billy comes home and Jenny's not there
Walkin' the floor and tearin' his hair
Feeling went cool when the touching stopped Crazy with lovin'
Oh yeah, oh yeah
He's been looking for someone She's been looking for someone
Ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh, trouble gonna come someday
Billy turned the corner
Goes through the night Shaking in the shadows
Billy's only got one thing on his mind It's the heartbreak town
Oh, yes it's a heartbreak, heartbreak, heartbreak, heartbreak
She's been looking for someone He's been looking for someone
He's been looking for someone She's been looking for someone
Ooh-ooh Oh-oh, trouble gonna come someday
Oh-oh, bye bye trouble Trouble gonna leave you now
