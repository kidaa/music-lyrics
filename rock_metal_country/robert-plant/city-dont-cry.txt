Oh! City don't cry
Oh! City don't cry
Is all your virgin truth turned to lies
Are all your dreams of freedom monolith
Is all your peace and justice so much, myth
Oh city don't cry
Oh! City don't weep
Oh! City don't weep
For even brother Satan has to sleep
And all your tragic idols rest in peace
And beautiful believers, their quiet counsel keep
Oh! City don't weep
Na-Na-Na-Na-
Oh! City don't moan
Oh! City don't moan
Inside your gates I make my wanderers home
And from your desert arms my fears have flown
Against your walls my demons turn to stone
Oh! City don't moan
