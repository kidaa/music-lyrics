[Anniversary of love's decay]
What is this land, that I have found
Bitter silence all around It's the anniversary
Feel the fear, and sad defeat Keeps my fragile haunted peace
On the anniversary Through these dark and lovely streets
Drag my raggedu defeat
It's the anniversary The anniversary
It's the anniversary How far is hate,
away from this Reluctant heated kiss
On the anniversary The anniversary The anniversary Ooh I don't want to feel your kiss no more
I don't want to feel your kiss no more
I don't want to feel your kiss no more
Oh oh oh oh I don't want to feel your kiss no more Oh oh oh!
