Every time I kiss somebody new I
Make believe I'm kissing you but oh
I can't kid my aching heart 'cos
My heart knows we're still apart and
Each night is like a thousand years
Oh-oh Since I got these young boy blues
I wanna cry when I hear your name
If I cry I feel ashamed so
I let my pride be my guide
I keep those tears inside and
Each night is like a thousand years
Oh-oh I can't lose these young boy blues
Oh-oh Don't know where to go
Don't know what to do
I'm so lost and lonely
Since I lost you
Every time I kiss somebody new I
Oh make believe I'm kissing you but oh
I can't kid my aching heart 'cos
My heart knows we're still apart and
Each night is like a thousand years
Oh-oh Since I got these young boy blues
Oh-oh now Don't know where to go
Don't know what to do
I'm so lost and lonely
Since I lost you
Every time I kiss somebody new
Oh make believe I'm kissing you but oh
I can't kid my aching heart 'cos
My heart knows we're still apart and
Each night is like a thousand years
Oh-oh
I can't lose these young boy blues
Oh-oh Each night is like a thousand years
Oh-oh Since I got these young boy blues
Yeah aw ooh Each night is like a thousand years
Oh-oh Can't lose these young boy blues
