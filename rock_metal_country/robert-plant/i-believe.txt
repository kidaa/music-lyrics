Tears, tears at the waters edge
Hey little sister give us laughter instead
Tears for the teacher, from the eyes, for her soul
This restless spirit takes a long way back home
Like the wind, you are free
Just a whisper I hear you, so talk to me
Oh, I believe, aye do aye
Say brother sisters, see your brothers in the sky
Neighbour, neighbour, don't be so cold
It's only glory from the story untold
Ah-ooh, oh I believe, aye do aye
Say brother sisters, see your brothers in the sky, oh-oh-oh
Neighbour, neighbour, don't be so cold
It's only glory from the story untold Ah-ooh, ooh Mm, yeah
Big fire, on top of the hill
A worthless gesture, and last farewell
Tears from your Mother, from the pits of her soul
Look at your Father, see his blood run cold
Like the wind, you are free
Just a whisper, I hear you, so talk to me
Oh, talk to me, Oh talk to me, Oh talk to me Oh, come on now, come on now
I believe, aye do aye
Say brothers sisters, see your brothers in the sky
Neighbour, neighbour, don't be so cold
It's only glory from the story untold Ah-ooh
I believe, aye do aye
Say brothers sisters, see your brothers in the sky
Neighbour, neighbour, don't be so cold
It's so much glory from the story untold
Ah-ooh, ooh I believe, I believe, I believe
