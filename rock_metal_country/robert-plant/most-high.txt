Who guards the truth, oh Lord most high?
A frightened dove in the starless sky
Oh-oh - so high, most high, so highWho hides the east from the blind man's eye?
In the land of peace where the righteous cry
Oh-oh - so high, most high, so high
Where are the words - of a king
Who moved the stars and the son
To the light when my spirit was born
Bring this wanderer home
While mercy sleeps in the hearts of liars
And the olive tree is consumed by fire
Oh-oh - so high, most high, so high
Put out the words - I'm the king
Who moved the star above the sun
To the light when the spirit was born
Bring this wanderer home
Come on, come on, come on
Now David seed talks through his paper crown
And he spits hot steel - see all the kids fall down
Oh-oh - so high, most high, oh-oh
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on --
Most high, most high
Most high, so high, so high
