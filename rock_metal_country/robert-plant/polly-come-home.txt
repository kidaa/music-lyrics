If the wild bird could speak
She'd tell of places you had been
She's been in my dreams
And she knows all the ways of the wind

[Chorus:]
Polly, come home again
Spread your wings to the wind
I felt much of the pain
As it begins

Dreams cover much time
Still they leave blind
The will to begin
I searched for you there
And now look for you from within

[Chorus]
