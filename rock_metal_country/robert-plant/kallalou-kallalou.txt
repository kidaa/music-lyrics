Oh please don't go, oh No please don't go, oh
No please don't go, oh You're breaking my heart again
How long's, so long, who can tell me
Where I went wrong, very rightly
So long's, too long I'll be on my own again
How fair's farewell and fair to who?
No-one can tell, to tell the truth
Still as it stands, I'm back on my own again, oh
You're all I know, no story Y
you're all I know, please don't worry
Don't want no Don't worry baby, Oh don't cry no more
How fair's farewell and fair to who?
No-one can tell, to tell the truth
Stare in the sands, I'm back on my own again
So please don't go, oh No please don't go, oh
No please don't go, oh You're breaking my heart again
You're all I know, no story
You're all I know, please don't worry
Don't want no, want no Oh yeah, don't you want me
Too late to find, no one is with me,
Long gone I'm back on my own again 
Whoa please don't go
No please don't go No please don't go
