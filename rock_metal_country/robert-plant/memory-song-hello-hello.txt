On my mind All my talk
From the lips of so many memories,
Sun, beaks the cool
Are you lost without a clue?
Stars still shine Winds will howl
All my friends Oh, my friend Sense you now
Now. Strange, so very strange
Ooh, yeah On my mind All my talk
From the lips of so many memories,
Sun, breaks the cool Are you lost without the clue?
Remain devided, we had our day
The help provided the sad display
Hello hello hello I saw you once before
