FIRES FALL, winds blow
There's trouble and it won't go
I'd really like to help you but you know
truth twists, liars dance
Mm, money money Greed chant
Let's take a little more before we go
'Cos we won't be back again
No we won't be back again,
Trees cry, men bow
Kneel before the fatted cow
Take a little 'Moo' before we go
We won't be back again
No we won't be back again
Oh we won't be back again, again, again, again Oh, 
talkin' about, talkin' about, talkin' about,
Tell me Jesus what to do Oh,
there's a little time for me and none
for you Just Leave for the lady there who's sure...
She won't be back again
I know she won't be back again
I'm sure she won't be back again
