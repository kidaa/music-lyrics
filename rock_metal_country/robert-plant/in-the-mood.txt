I'm in the mood for a melody I'm in the mood for a melody, I'm in the mood
I'm in the mood for a melody I'm in the mood for a melody, I'm in the mood
I'm in the mood for a melody I'm in the mood for a melody, I'm in the mood
I can make you dance, I can make you sing
I can make you dance, I can make you sing If you want me too
Oh, I can make you dance, I can make you sing
I can make you dance, I can make you sing If you want me too
Oh, I can make you dance, I can make you sing
I can make you dance, I can make you sing If you want me too
Any little song that you wanna to sing,
A little song that you wanna to sing
Song will do [Sung in lieu?]
Here's a little song that you wanna to sing,
A little song that you wanna to sing Song for you
A little song that you wanna to sing,
A little song that you wanna to sing Happy or blue
I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood
Why'd I end up doin' it, doin' it, doin' it
Do anything that you want me for
If you want me to
Do it right, gonna do it wrong,
Cause a matter of fact it'll turn out to be strong
If you want me to If you want me to
Oh, if you want me to If you want me to If you want to
