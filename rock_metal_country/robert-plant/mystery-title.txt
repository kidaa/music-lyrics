Had to leave in a hurry, couldn't wait to get away
It's not a case of being sorry, it's the price I have to pay
And confidentially I think it's sad but there's nothing I can do
If the road leads to the highway, well I'm hot and I've got to move
Ah-ha I've got to move
Got to change my arrangements, had the word I'm on my way
I couldn't stand it much longer, got the move, I'm on my way
I didn't mean to let you down but there's nothing I can do
If the road leads to the highway, well I'm hot and I've got to move
I'm hot and I've got to move
Talk of strain in relations, of the days of being confused
You told me never to worry, I'll never ask you to choose
Categorically I have to say it's as much as I can do
To sit around here waiting, when I'm hot and I've got to move
Oh, sometimes it's lonely oh but it's the only
Way I know and the road is leading me on
Ooh baby, I've got to move, yes
Oh, now baby baby, I've got to leave
And when I think back I smile and know that
Win or lose it's the road that's calling me on
Ooh, baby baby I've got to move, yes
Ooh, baby baby I've got to move, yeah
There's a man in a suitcase standing in a darkened room
Message light is burning, and the blinds are always drawn
It's been a while since the last time, never should come back to soon
Behind, the door is slamming, when he's hot he's got to move
When he's hot he's got to move
Yes, he's got to move
Yes, I've got to leave, yeah
Sometime, I've got to leave, yeah
That's right, yes, that's right, yes that's right
Ooh, yes, you know it's right, you know it's right,
You know it's right, you know it's right
