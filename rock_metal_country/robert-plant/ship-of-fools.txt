On waves of love my heart is breaking
And stranger still my self control
I can't rely on anymore
New tides surprise my world it's changing
Within this frame an ocean swells
Behind this smile I know it well
Beneath a lover's moon I'm waiting
I am the pilot of the storm Adrift in pleasure I may drown
I built this ship it is my making
And furthermore my self control I can't rely on anymore
I know why I know why
Crazy on a ship of fools Crazy on a ship of fools
Turn this boat around back to my loving ground Oh no, oh no
Who claims that no man is an island
While I land up in jeopardy
More distant from you by degrees
I walk this shore in isolation
And at my feet eternity tries ever sweeter plans for me
I know why I know why
Crazy on a ship of fools
Oh, crazy on a ship of fools
Turn this boat around back to my loving ground
Oh no, oh no Ship of fools
Turn this boat around back to my loving ground Oh no,
oh Crazy on a ship of fools Oh, crazy on a ship of fools
Turn this boat around back to my loving ground Oh no, oh no Ship of fools
