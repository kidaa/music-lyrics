Oh, don't cross your fingers, cross your heart and soul
Don't ask me the question 'cos I just don't know
Sold by my intentions got my emotions on hold
So don't ask me why
You ask how I feel, and what it's like inside
I'm hot in pursuit, I'm bearing down on your hide
Involved in a recovery tryin' to save my pride
Don't ask me again
Wound up in circumstance beyond my control
Affairs of the heart no longer leave me cold
Oh, what a feeling such a long time ago
Don't ask me again
Get down baby, you're out of control
You leave be my side or you leave on your own
I gotta know what I should know,
Don't ask me again
So don't you ask me how I feel and what it's like inside
'Cos in the circumstances babe you don't mess with my pride
It's just recovery babe, just recovery babe
Meet me in the middle, please some give and take
Alternative arrangements are there to be made
A new proposition's not a piece of cake
So don't you ask me
Wound up in circumstance beyond my control
Affairs of the heart no longer leave me cold
Oh what a feeling such a long time ago
Don't ask me again
