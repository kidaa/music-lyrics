Had a dream last night Didn't come as a surprise
When I woke up wet With the moon in my eyes
Just the same old dream Like the one before
But this time I thought you were there for sure
I've been caught red-handed, I don't know what I'm gonna do
So when I wake, Every night it's the same
Just lying there staring and confused yet again
And it's when I do That I fumble in the dark
For the line or the light from the tear in my heart
Here it comes again, oh ... looking for you
And here it comes again And here it comes again
Now I've carried the torch I've uncovered the flame
But the friend I'd meet, it must have known me
Had a dream last night Didn't come as a surprise
When I woke up wet With the moon in my eyes
Here I am, here I am again, looking for you Oh oh oh
Here it comes again And here it comes again
Every night it's the same Every night it's the same,
oh Every night it's the same Every night it's the same,
oh Every night it's the same
