Ah - ah - ah Ah - ah - ah Ah - ah - ah - ah - ah
Ah - ah - ah Ah - ah - ah Ah - ah - ah Ah - ah - ah - ah - ah
Ah - ah - ah I cried, babe, Oh, I cried
I saw you in a movie
Or was it on my wall I never dreamed you talk to me
I never dreamed at all Ah - ah - ah Ah - ah - ah
Ah - ah - ah - ah - ah Ah - ah - ah You figured very strongly
You might have changed my life For I was very young then
You came along just right This is why I cried, oh-oh Now you know I cried, oh-oh Ah - ah - ah Ah - ah - ah
Ah - ah - ah - ah - ah Ah - ah - ah
I walked with Stella Stevens
My feet were off the ground You talked of something permanent
When Saturday comes round
This is what I cried, oh-oh This is why I cried, oh-oh
This is what I cried, oh-oh Now you know I cried, ah
Ooh, now Kiss me 'till I'm crazy
C'mon tease me 'till I scream Promise is a maybe
Running through my dreams S' what I hear is ..... Suffer cross my room
Taste my whole confusion Rescue from my gloom
This is what I cried, whoa Now you know I cried, oh-oh
Your eyes are where the summer lives In pools of quiet fire
Come mess with my sincerity Go down on my desire,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh I feast on your expression
The smile that tells it all On my mind forever
Forever on my wall This is what I cried, oh-oh
Now you know I cried, oh-oh This is what I cried, oh-oh This is what I cried
