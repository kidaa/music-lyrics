I can't believe it, it happens each day
It's ill conceived, just throw it away
To watch the waiting time slipping away
It won't be long now
I hold the moment, the hour is sublime
It's hard believing, dancing with time
To watch the waiting time slipping away
It won't be long now
Down at the landing when the boats come in, people stand in line
Close by the water where the fishes swim, round and round to pass the time
But you know it's gonna get there
Around and around it's gonna spin
Out at the airport where the planes come in, people buzzing like flies
Out at the airport where the planes come in, see the hours go flashing by
But you know it's gonna get there
Around and around it's gonna spin
Down at the station where the trains come in, never make it on time
Down at the station where the trains come in, see my friends all walk the line
But you know they're gonna get there
Around and around they're gonna spin
View it all with suspicion, view it all and despise
View it all with suspicion, view it all with my eyes
