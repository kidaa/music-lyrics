Good morning What we have in mind
is breakfast in bed for four hundred thousand
Tie dye on the highway See the garlands in your hair
If you're goin' my way, come along
What a beautiful sky at we just have to stop and stare
See the beautiful colours fill the air
Just a messengers of peace
Oh do you remember across the burning years
Sweet smell of the mystery, I recall
Hey, mi amigo, With a smile through all my fears
Old how it lingers, touched our souls
With the messengers of peace And the company of love
All the Passion and release
And the love from up above
Aah, Say you will come back with me Say you will come back
We must be in heaven man!
Oh yeah, now come on Tie dye on the highway
The wheels still turning round Dance the .... Take my hand 
Hope springs eternal and laughter spilling sound 
Movin in the mystic wasted land
With the messenger of peace And the company of love
All the fashion that release And the love will never die
You know that it is true From the desert in my heart
With the innocence of love All the fashion that release And the love will never die
Aah, Say you will come back with me Say you will come back
Aah Say you will come back with me Say you will come back
.. ... Jesus loves you, Jesus loves you ..
