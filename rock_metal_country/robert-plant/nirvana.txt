Let's go! Love's in the stars, love's
Brush your lips and mine, taste my good intent
Lay on real close, inside my crazy arms
Come on feel you Daddy's love, I won't do you no harm
How you feel inside All your walking and chatter
Thrill me all through the night Let me see the dancer
Come on in your fire, melt my love control
Coax me with your showers of love
Feel my power roll How you feel inside
All your walking and chatter Thrill me all through the night
Let me see the dancer Love's ... It's power at your command
Prisoner in your arms of love Captive in your hands
How you feel inside All your walking and chatter
Thrill me all through the night Let me see the dancer
Oh Nirvana, I love you love you love you love you
... How you feel inside All your walking and chatter
Thrill me all through the night Let me see the dancer Oh Nirvana
I love you love you love you love you
... Holy Moses, Me Amigo
Mystic biscuit mind your lingo Walk in circles stand by truth Watch out boys she's after you
She's after you, oh, she's gonna get you
Oh, oh, here she comes, watch out!
