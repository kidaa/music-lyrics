Strange things are happening everyday
I hear the music up above my head
Though the side of my heart has left me again
I hear music up above

Secrets are written in the sky
Looks like ive lost the love ive never found
Though the sound of hope has left me again
I hear music up above

Standing in my broken heart all night long
Darkness heald me like a freind when love was lost
Looking for the land thats hidden in the cross
The finders love
I know I loved you too much
Ill go alone to get through

I hear rosetta singing in the night
Echos of lighting shine like stars after there gone
And tonight shes my giude as a girl on the moon
With the music up above
