Down, down, down Always make the same mistakes, again
Down, down, always down Always make the same mistake
Talk is cheap, but you're talking fast
Never take the time to think of where it will end
Walking tall, don't look back
I don't know which way it's gonna lead, me baby
I try so hard but I can't understand
Lead, me baby
Just help me get my feet on the ground
Down, down, down Wanderin' through the places that we both used to go
Round, round always round Chase me and sedate me now but don't let me go
Restless sleep, locked in my lonely room
Empty arms are waiting for the morning to come
In the deep, where my dreams come true
Take care now, keep you now, but
Lead me baby
I try so hard but I can't understand
Lead, me baby
Oh, but help me get my feet on the ground, yes, help me
Oh, help me baby, oh help me
I can't stay down for too long now baby
I can't stay down for too long now baby
No, yeah, whoa yes
If I cry [I'm crying?] well, it's, it's 'cos I'm lonely
You know I'm only ever lonely without you
If I cry well, it's 'cos I'm lonely
'Cos I can be so lonely, I can be, I can be, I can be ...
Push, push, push, ooh
