A brand new human being razor sharp all firm and tan
All clean, all pure with a thirty second attention span
As the clock strikes twelve and we're ready for party games
You play blind man's bluff and I'll play out charades
Heaven knows What kind of fool am I,
Heaven knows Why you take an eye for an eye
Heaven knows What comes over me
You were pumping iron Whereas I was pumping irony
Now I find myself fully occupied and half alive
With your head, heart, arms and legs Wrapped around my family pride,
oh See the whites of their eyes - then shoot
With all the romance of the Ton-Ton Macoute
Heaven knows What kind of fool am I,
Heaven knows Why you take an eye for an eye
Heaven knows What comes over me
You were pumping iron Whereas I was pumping irony
Nothing will show as we're shedding our clothes
But then I suppose, anything goes, anything goes mmm
But then I suppose that anything, anthing goes,
ooh Heaven knows Heaven knows Heaven knows
Ooh yeah, oh yeah Heaven knows Heaven knows
Heaven knows Ooh yeah, heaven knows
Heaven knows What kind of fool am I,
Heaven knows What comes over me
Heaven knows What kind of fool am I,
Tell me please, please, please
Heaven knows What kind of fool am I
Heaven knows What kind of fool am I
Heaven knows What kind of fool, fool, fool, fool, fool, fool
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Heaven knows What kind of fool am I,
Heaven knows What comes over me
Heaven knows What kind of fool am I, Tell me, ooh
