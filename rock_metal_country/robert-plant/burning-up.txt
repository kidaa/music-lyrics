My mind is cracked - I stand alone
And my way is dark as night
Back on the hill the wind it moans
And big black clouds fly by
The rain fell down - it drowned my heart
It raged inside my soul
A pain that tore the skies apart
The twisted night unfolds
Oh, burning up - I'm burning up - I'm burning up
This lonely road that I must walk
All these tears that burn my eyes
Emptiness my torment draws
In my silent, loveless life
Oh, burning up - I'm burning up - I'm burning up
Oh, can you hear me?
Hear me calling 'cross a thousand miles
Oh, would you lead me?
If I die, I die a thousand times
[Like a volcano] I'm burning up
