Watching through the window
Oh, staring at the rain
Watching all the time go
Relive all my pain
[scat singing]
So many in the sky, the red sky - rain all aglow
I've learned my lesson hard - oh, no
Here I am, ho-ho - the tears falling down
Hey-hey, ho-ho - the years go rolling down
Tears go on, tears go on together
Together - together
Oh, looking through the window
Staring at the rain
Oh, watching all the time go
Tears fall down like rain
Oh, watching at the window
Staring at the rain
Oh, watching as the time go
See my life go pour the rain on down
