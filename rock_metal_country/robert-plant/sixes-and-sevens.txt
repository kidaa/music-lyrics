Sundown, another busy day watching the time fly
Old ground standing in the way And I don't know why
So here I am making changes
Alterations to my house of cards
But I don't hold new arrangements
Am I at home, am I at home, am I, am I alright?
Look down, almost with breath held as the time flies
I found, I'm lost in your reflection,
I don't know why I'm so behind in my repayments
Consideration must be over-due
But I'm at sixes with the statements
Am I at six, am I at six, am I - ooh?
Now the twist of fortune wasn't in the plans
and my desire for living
To do the best I can To do the best I can
To do the best I can Oh oh oh yeah
Sometimes I nearly always drop, but then I get through
And each time it comes as a surprise what they should do
Oh, another drain of my resources
Information's getting out of hand I'm at home with all the courses
Am I at home, am I at home, am I, am I, am I?
Talk to me, talk to me yes
Talk to me, oh now, it gets so hard Gets so hard
Just a little bit hard when you talk to me like you do J
Just a little bit hard when you talk to me like you do
Just a little bit hard when you talk to me like you do
Just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit
