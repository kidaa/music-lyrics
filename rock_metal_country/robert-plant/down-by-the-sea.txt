Carry me down to the sea Carry me down where they're waiting for me
That's where I want to be That's where it all comes around
Watching the ships pass by me Friendships and small ships and hardships and dreams
That's where I want to be Here where it all comes around
Oh, my head is in the sand All my life passin' by
All of my days I have seen All of the tears and the laughter and dreams
Movin' before me Waves and the ocean and sea
Life is a big tambourine The more that you shake it the better it seems
This is my [not] wisdom These are just words from the sea
Oh my head is in the sand All my days passin' by
When I get older, settlin' down Would you come down to the sea
Ah-ha Carry me down to the sea again, ah-ha
Oh, carry me down to the sea again, ah-ha, ah-ha
Carry me down to the sea again, ah-ha, ah-ho
Carry me down to the sea again
Carry me down, carry me down,
Carry me down to the sea again
Carry me down, carry me down,
Carry me down to the sea, ah-ha, ah-ha
Won't-you-please, carry me down
Please, carry me down
Come on come on come on come on come on
Down down down to the sea, again, yes
