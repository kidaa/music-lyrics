If I were a carpenter, and you were a Lady
Would you marry me anyway?
Would you have my baby?
If a tinker were my trade, would you still find me
Carryin' the pots I made, followin' behind me?
Save my love through loneliness
Save my love through sorrow
I give you my only-ness
Give my your tomorrow
If I worked my hands at wood,
Oh would you still love me?
Answer me babe.
";Yes I would, I'd put you above me.";
If a miller were my trade, at a mill wheel grinding
Would you miss your glory-box, oh your soft shoes shining
Save my love through loneliness
Save my love through sorrow
I give you my only-ness
Come give my your tomorrow
I give you my only-ness
Give my your tomorrow
If I were a carpenter, and you were a Lady
Would you marry me anyway?
Would you have my baby?
Would you marry me anyway?
Would you have my baby?
Would you marry me anyway? Marry me?
Would you have my baby? Ah-ah-ah.
