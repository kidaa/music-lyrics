Everything I do, yes I do for my love
Every place I go, she is on my mind
I would give the world, my soul, to discover
Send me just a sign angel on my mind
And if I should dream, I could dream of no other
Out here in the deep, hear my body cryin'
Heaven knows the fire that I hide and recover
Glorify this fool, angel on my mind, on my mind
This is the greatest gift that I can bring to you, ay
I feel the world that moves inside
This is the moment I have dreamt of all my life
Reach out and touch, and you will find
Why am I crazy, who is foolin' with the order
I am strong, I will not fade, I will survive
Look in my eyes, you'll see my heart, I will recover
Send me just a sign, angel on my mind, on my mind
This is the greatest gift that I can bring to you, ay
I feel the world that moves inside
This is the moment, I have dreamt of all my life
Reach out and touch, oh, and you will find
This is the greatest gift, ooh
This is the greatest gift, oh Hey yeah, hey yeah Oh,
