Watch them go cause one be one they rise to fall
hearts in tow it's just a game she's only having fun
she laughs and turns away surprised she mocks it all the same
tonight's the loss tomorrow's gain and in the end it's so
Stand in line cause one by one they march in time
In the wings I stand and watch these foolish things go by,
just preparing for the play aloof she moves
the confidante, with practive steps the memory dance she executes her role oh
As the cavalcade begins to thin, do you stop and look around,
free to choose but not to win you're just too late
you show is at an end. now your the victim of your game
through your fingers watch them slip,
familiar rules just hit and miss for the one who never shows
