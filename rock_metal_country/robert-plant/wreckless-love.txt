Now, red is urgent, green's a let off
And the score shows just another spin off
Orange dance and brown in old
Grey is weary, don't touch gold
In the fireworks, away from the heat
Behind closed doors, away from the street
No-one is listening, at least that's what you think
Cause a slow fuse burns, much faster than you think
Like the new look, all that matters
Through the last one, back in the shadows
Purple each one [leaf swam?], yellow
Silver his wound, and don't touch gold
Dance through the coloured razzamatazz
Spin alone desert affairs
Reckless love is creeping on you
Now watch her ways [Watch out, reckless]
'Cos reckless love will drive you crazy
Will wear your mind out [The way you wind up]
Creeps up on you when you don't know It'll find out, ah
Reckless love, reckless love
Oh reckless love, reckless love Oh yeah
Waste with my heart to the top of a kiss
Tried my desire to take in at your ears
Breakin' my heart for it's all I own
Crazy with my heart
Ah come on, in these times I'm alone
Crazy with my heart
Other the arms that held me so tight
Crazy with my heart
Stuck in my mind with you in the night
Feelin' reckless, feelin' reckless, reckless love
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh
Ooh reckless, oh, reckless love, reckless love
Reckless love, reckless love Reckless love, reckless love
Reckless love, reckless love Burn, oh baby burn
Feel it creepin' up on you Reckless love, reckless love
Now, now, now Reckless love, oh, oh, yeah
Come on, come on, come on, come on Reckless, get it
Reckless love, reckless love Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yes
