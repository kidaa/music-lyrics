I'll see you baby, when the ice has broken
When the rain stops falling down
I'll be waiting for you, baby when your time has come
And your face no longer frowns
I caught a taste of springtime on your lips
I saw the sunlight in your eyes
I wake to find you smiling with the dawn
Just reminders of the time
I feel your breath, I look around but you're gone
I see the place where you were lying
I caught a taste of springtime on your lips
I see the sunlight in your eyes - ooh
It's been so long, it's been so long, so long, since you've been gone
I look away, I can see that you're gone
I guess I'm standing here alone
Across the sea, I see the bluebirds on high
In the wildest places too
Above the ground the wind is calling out to me
Oh, lead me back to you
I caught a taste of springtime on your lips
I can still see the sunlight in your eyes, in your eyes
It's been so long, it's been so long, so long, since you've been gone
I look away, I can see that you're gone
I guess I'm standing here alone
Well I'll see you baby, when the ice has broken
When the rain stops falling down
I'll be waiting for you, baby when your time has come
And your face no longer frowns
And I caught a taste of springtime on your lips
I saw the sunlight in your eyes, in your eyes
Oh oh, yes, I can I can I can
Yeah, I can see, I can see
I can see that ... true, yes, oh baby
Just like, just like I've never been gone
It's just like, just like I've never been gone
Babe, just like I've never been gone
