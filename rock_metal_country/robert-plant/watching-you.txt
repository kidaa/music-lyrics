Oh, the sleep by and dry Oh, mm, as the guilty are torn
Come over the mountains come over the sea
Mm, should my darkness prevail Ooh, does your memory fail
Oh love on the wing, carry my prayer Cherish this moment in times of despair
Over the mountains, over the sea Angel of love, come back home to me
Mm, are your kisses so warm Can you, can you carry my storm
Oh Lord, just one move and your gone Love on the wing, carry my prayer
Cherish this moment in times of despair Over the mountains, over the sea
Angel of love, please come home to me
Come back home, come back home, come back home
Mm, I'm so guilty, so guilty, I'm so guilty
Love on the wing, carry my prayer Cherish this moment in times of despair
Over the mountains, over the sea Angel of love, bring it back home to me
Come back home to me ... ..Oh, see my disgrace I touch you right now
The beautiful embrace See my disgrace I touch you right now
I'm tired of watching you Oh, I'm tired of watching you
