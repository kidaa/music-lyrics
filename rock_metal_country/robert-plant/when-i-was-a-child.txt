I was reaching for the future
Slowly floating in the blue
When I was a boy
I dreamed a dream of you
I danced upon the tree-top
I drifted with the stream
When I was a child
I held you in my dreamsOnce I was a soldier
In my castle strong
Oh, I stood so tall then
I could do no wrong
Innocence and slumber
When I was a boy
I was walking with a stranger
He left without a trace
When I was a boy
I slept at heaven's gate
Once I was a soldier [etc repeated]
