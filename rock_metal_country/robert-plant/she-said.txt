Oh, give me fresh horses, let me ride the wild beast
Women in houses, I can't deal with their heat.
they seek salvation, I'm not sure if it's theirs anymore...
... my treasures, my ... to be own I not quite sure,
.... that I'm messin for Nobody's talking,
I can swear that I've seen it before I've seen it before.
I don't know why, I don't know why
Ten men standing with their backs to the wall Shrink
from the knowledge, They throw gold in a hole
What's really sad how, you know, They don't mind at all
Don't give me gestures You don't know what they mean
...Same old expressions, Same familiar old themes
Your body's talking, I can swear that I've heard it all before
I don't know why you lied, I don't know why you lied
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why,
She Said I don't know why you lied,
I don't know why you lied I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
You know when the deal goes down
It's time to leave and you're on your own
I will walk with you In my very heart you'll find a home
She said ";Maybe you will"; I said ";Maybe I will, maybe I won't. With me, I won't";
She said ";Maybe you will"; I said ";Whatever you do, is whatever you do";
Whatever you do, is what-whatever you do
Whatever you do, whatever you do Oh, oh, oh
And she said Come let me ride Come let me ride the wild beast
Come let me ride Come let me ride the wild beast
The wild beast, the wild beast, the wild beast.
