Oh, yeah She walks like a gunslinger Laughs through the shots
Got some lead from the hips She's so hot she can't stop
Oh, yeah Oh, she loves like a steam train Out all the time
She fights like a bobcat Got some fame on her mind
Tell me why Oh, tell me why Oh, yeah Ooh-ooh, yeah
Oh-oh, fire where the heart is sweet home on the range
Call of the wild See the beast with no name
Tell me why Oh, tell me why
The world is waiting here for you, you, you
Can't you see them anymore
The world is waiting there for you, you, you
Can't you see them anymore, anymore, anymore
The world is waiting there for you, you, you
Don't you just hear it anymore
The world is waiting there for you, you, you
Don't you feel them anymore, anymore, anymore
She's tall in the saddle Got a rose in her teeth
She's hell incarnate Just walkin' down your street
Oh-oh, yeah Now you've seen the line on the glory
From the heart of the flame
From the, I don't know a story
But your song never change
Tell me why Oh, tell me why
The world is waiting there for you, you, you
Can't you feel it anymore
The world is waiting there for you, you, you
Can't you feel it anymore, anymore, anymore
