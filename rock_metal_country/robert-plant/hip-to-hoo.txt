She's a ..., broken promising,
Tryin' to make me out a fool, fool, fool
Oh, cheat, cheat, cheat, don't do it now
In your game, you play the maker
Your calculations make the rule, rule, rule
Ooh, yes, you're breaking my heart,
you breakin' my heart Ooh, ahh.
So strange, when I'm coming fo you
You look and laugh and then you cry cry cry
Oh, cheat, cheat, cheat, don't do it now
There's a change, withholdin' information
When I ask you, ask me why why why
Stop stop, stop stop, stop stop Stop hurtin' me baby
Stop again, stop again, stop again
Stop stop, stop stop, stop stop Stop hurtin' me baby
Stop again, stop again, stop again
Cheat cheat cheat cheat cheat Cheat cheat cheat cheat cheat
Stop stop, stop stop, stop stop Stop heartin' me baby
Oh, stop again, stop again, stop again
So sweet, with your innocence,
I've found the cutest step, so cute
Cheat, cheat, cheat, don't do it now
She's a vain, broken promises,
Tryin' to make me out a fool, fool, fool - yeah
You're breaking my heart, oh yeah You're breaking my heart,
oh yeah Give it to me baby Give it to me baby
I really want to know I really want to know
Give it to me baby
