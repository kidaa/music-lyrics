Why-why-why Oh, the sandman is running
Oh, he ain't telling you why
But she knows Yeah she knows
Oh, the thunder is roaring
Oh-oh, h-ear his wings in the sky
And he knows
She don't know, she don't know, she don't know
She don't know, she don't know, she don't know why
Oh, why
She wants it bad, oh-oh She wants it bad,
oh-oh When you're lost and found a brand new way
Here comes another happy end Mmm,
now the black night is falling Oh,
see that tear in your eye
Cause you know
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know why
Oh, why She wants it bad, oh-oh She wants it bad,
oh-oh When you're lost and found a brand new way
Here comes another happy end ah-ah-ah-ah ....
Oh, now the new day is dawning
Oh-oh, to the past kiss goodbye And you know
We don't know, we don't know, we don't know
We don't know, we don't know, we don't know
We don't know, we don't know, we don't know why
Oh-oh, why W-w-w-w-w-why Oh-oh, why Oh, why Oh, why
