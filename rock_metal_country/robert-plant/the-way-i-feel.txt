See what I'm driving at and I'm back behind the wheel
I'm just a little nervous - it's something to do with the way I feel
Mm, the way I feel, with the way I feel
Trouble understanding, nothing too out of hand
A little overloaded Some kinda storm in the heart of the man
Oh, mm, in the heart of the man
I must have heard it somewhere
I can't quite remember Mm,
look what I've turned into and I'm back inside the car
We travelled in luxery A little celebration went a touch too far
Mm, just a touch too far, just a touch too far
I must have passed it somewhere,
Mmm, now I can't quite remember, oh-oh
Oh, but here it comes again
The mirror tries to please me
The image wouldn't stay
The stranger is too perfect Take my breath away
The future rides beside me Tomorrow in his hand
The stranger turns to greet me And take me by the hand Shame
... ooh-ooh Ooh, look what I've turned into and I'm back inside the car
We travelled in luxery A little celebration went a touch too far
Mmm, just a touch too far, just a touch
It something to do with the way I feel With the way I feel, oh, ooh-ooh
The mirror tries to please me The image wouldn't stay
The stranger is too perfect Take my breath away
The future rides beside me Tomorrow in his hand
The stranger turns to greet me And take me by the hand
The mirror tries to please me The image wouldn't stay
The stranger is too perfect Take my breath away
