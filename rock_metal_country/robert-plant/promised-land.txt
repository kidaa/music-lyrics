Oh baby, can't eat can't sleep Can't understand a love song
Drive me crazy 'Cause my feet won't quit as I go slidin' in the sweet zone
Round round like you want me to do
Down down like you're beggin' me to
The floor's small and the wall's too steep
I can kiss your mouth when I go to sleep
Oh, baby, got those personal moves so deep inside my move groove
I go crazy, my head won't quit as I crawl inside your love groove
Down down like you want me to do
Round round like you're beggin' me to
The floor's small and it's much too steep
I can kiss your mouth when I go to sleep
I feel alright, 'Cause my little girl wants to dance all night
What can I do I know my little girl wants to dance with you
Oh darlin', come on baby, come on mess with me
Oh, woman, I'll make it up to you, if you just drive me wild, child
Down down like you want me to do
Round round like you're daring me to
The floor's small and the wall's too steep
I can kiss your mouth when I go to sleep
I feel alright Because my little girl wants to dance all night
Oh what can I do I know my little girl, she wants to dance with you
I feel alright My little girl wants to dance all night
Oh what can I do, ooh ooh I know that girl, she wants to dance, dance, dance
Round round like you want me to do
Down down you're beggin' me to
The floor's small and much too steep
I can kiss your mouth as I go to sleep
I feel alright 'Cause my little girl she wants to dance all night
All of my life
You know my little girl she wants to dance, dance, dance
I feel alright Oh my little girl she wants to dance all night, now
Oh what can I do Oh, my little girl wants to d-a-nce
Come on dance with me baby, come on dance with me baby
Oh, well... ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh I gotta keep movin', I gotta keep movin
Blues fallin' down like hail...
