Another day is ended
I remember when
My world came falling down
Out there the stars stopped dancing
Lost in my darkness now
The rain keeps falling down
Light of my life - where have you gone?
Love's true flame dies without the warmth of your sun
Here comes a blue train rolling
Across my heart it crawls
The rain still falling down
Another day scares me
A little later maybe
Love will roll around
Light of my life [etc repeated]
I been waiting on a corner
Yeah, I been waiting for a sign to be found
I been waiting on a corner
I been waiting for a sign now
Oh, now
Light of my life [etc repeated]
So you know the blue train go
It carry my heart and my soul
Whistle blowing - blue train rolling
Carry my darkness all around
Whistle blow - blue train roll
Carry my heartI been waiting on a corner
I been wishing for a sign now
I been waiting on a corner
I been waiting for a sign now
Whistle blowing - blue train going
Calling across my mind now
I been standing on the corner
I been waiting for the sun to go down
Yeah, the blue train - it's the blue train
Oh, it's a blue train rolling
