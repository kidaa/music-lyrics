Throw it down Cleveland rain
The Queen of Love has flown again
To seek her daughter
Who must lie beside the thief
Whose golden tongue she will believe
Defies the order
That is why that is love
Oh, that is why
Shall we dance and never stop
Take my hand and stop the clock
From turning over
Spirit weave and spirit bend
In the move that has no end
That we must follow
Oh, that is why
Show me your eyes
Oh light of the sun
Touch me with fire
My mind is undone
All life inspire
My freedom has come
I drift through desire
My wonderful one
When you do what you do
I can never, never, never
Let you go
When you feel the way you feel
You can never, never, never
Let it show
Throw it down Cleveland Rain
The Queen of Love has flown again
To seek her daughter
