Take my hand 
And don't let go
Trust this man
And let it flow

Don't take me down
Cause I'm not done
Don't steal my crown
Before it's won
The wide expanse
The wheel of chance
Will turn my way
The sky will not be gray

I don't wanna be like other people are
Don't wanna own a key, don't wanna wash my car
Don't wanna have to work like other people do
I want it to be free, I want it to be true

Take my hand
And don't let go
Trust this man
And let it flow

I drank in every bar in town
I filled my cup when I was down
I saw the things I wanted to see
Became the man I wanted to be
But then somehow I lost my way
I've got to get back there today

I don't wanna be like other people are
Don't wanna own a key, don't wanna wash my car
Don't wanna have to work like other people do
I want it to be free, I want it to be true

I don't wanna be like other people are
Don't wanna own a key, don't wanna wash my car
Don't wanna have to work like other people do
I want it to be free, I want it to be true

I don't wanna be like other people are
Don't wanna own a key, don't wanna wash my car
Don't wanna have to work like other people do
I want it to be free, I want it to be true

I don't wanna be like other people are
Don't wanna own a key, Don't wanna wash my car
I lie awake at night, or wait until it's light
I want it to be free, I thought that I was right

Tought that I was right
Tought that I was right
Tought that I was right
Tought that I was right
Tought that I was right
Tought that I was right
