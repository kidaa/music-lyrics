This can't be real
My heart is burning
How does it feel
Well let's say I'm learning
It had to come
The ship has landed
It's time to run
The crew are stranded

We're having the time of our lives
We're lost in a cruel paradise

Someone like you can make me feel like I used to do
Return my heart, yeah, make it feel like it does at the start
Someone like you, Someone like you, yeah

You're everything to me
The sweetest symphony
All that I try to be
You are my harmony
I guess what I mean to say
Is you keep the walls at bay
The children on holiday
Here comes the crowd

We're having the time of our lives
We're lost in a cruel paradise

Someone like you can make me feel like I used to do
Return my heart, yeah, make it feel like it does at the start
Someone like you, yeah, Someone like you, yeah
