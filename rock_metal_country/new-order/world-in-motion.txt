Express yourself 
Create the space 
You know you can win 
Don't give up the chase 

Beat the man 
Take him on 
You never give up 
Its one on one 

Express yourself 
Its one on one 
Express yourself 
Its one on one 
Express yourself 
You can't be wrong 
When something's good 
Its never gone 

Loves got the world in motion 
And I know what we can do 
Loves got the world in motion 
And I can't believe its true 

Now is the time 
Let everyone see 
You never give up 
That's how it should be 
Don't get caught 
Make your own play 
Express yourself 
Don't give it away 

Express yourself 
Its one on one 
Express yourself 
Its one on one 
Express yourself 
You can't be wrong 
When something's good 
Its never wrong 

Loves got the world in motion 
And I know what we can do 
Loves got the world in motion 
And I can't believe its true 

Loves got the world in motion 
And I know what we can do 
Loves got the world in motion 
And I can't believe its true 

You've got to hold and give 
But do it at the right time 
You can be slow or fast 
But you must get to the line 
They'll always hit you and hurt you 
Defend and attack 
Theres only one way to beat them 
Get round the back 
Catch me if you can 
Cos' I'm the England man 
And what you're looking at 
Is the master plan 
We ain't no hooligans 
This ain't a football song 
Three lions on my chest 
I know we can't go wrong 

We're playing for England {In-ger-land} 
We're playing the song 
We're singing for England {In-ger-land} 
Arrivederci its one one one 

We're playing for England {In-ger-land} 
We're playing the song 
We're singing for England {In-ger-land} 
Arrivederci its one one one 

We're playing for England {In-ger-land} 
We're playing the song 
We're singing for England {In-ger-land} 
Arrivederci its one one one 

We're playing for England {In-ger-land} 
We're playing the song 
We're singing for England {In-ger-land} 
Arrivederci its one one one
