Won't you please let me go 
'Cause words lie inside 
They hurt me so 
And I'm not the kind that likes to tell you 
Just what I want to do 
I'm not the kind that needs to tell you 
Just what you want me to 

I saw you this morning 
I thought that you might like to know 
I received your message 
In full a few days ago 
I understood every word that it said 
And now that I actually heard it 
You're going to regret 

And I'm not the kind that needs to tell you 
Just what you want me to 
You're not the kind that needs to tell you 
Just what you... want me to 

Do you find this happens all the time 
A crucial point one day 
Becomes a crime 
And I'm not the kind that need to tell you 
Just what you want me to 
I'm not the kind that needs to tell you 
Just what the fuck you want me to 

I've lost you, I've lost you, I've lost you, I've lost you, I've lost you 
I've lost you, I've lost you, I've lost you, I've lost you, I've lost you 
I've lost you, I've lost you, I've lost you, I've lost you, I've lost you 
Ooo-oo-oo...
