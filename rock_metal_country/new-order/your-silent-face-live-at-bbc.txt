A thought that never changes 
Remains a stupid lie 
It's always been just the same 
No hearing nor breathing 
No movement, no calling
Just silence 

Rise and fall of shame 
A search that shall remain 
You asked me where I'd been 
I said I didn't care 

Sound formed in a vacuum 
May seem a waste of time 
It's always been just the same 
No hearing no breathing 
No movement no colors 
Just silence 

The rise and fall of shame 
The search that shall remain 
You asked me what you'd seen 
I said you didn't care
