You know it never meant much to me 
There's something on your mind that I couldn't see 
It didn't hurt me too much to find 
You were seeing someone else for all of this time 
You know that I don't care 
And I'd like you to know that I don't care 
I don't need your sympathy 
Why don't you ever look at me 

You did nothing for me 
You did nothing I see
You did nothing for me 
You did nothing 

There's no today and there's no tomorrow 
Where you find sadness I find sorrow 
Nobody knows but it always shows 
I think I'm losing my mind but that's the way that it goes 
And it's fine, all those lies 
I can see the truth lies in your eyes 
So I guess we are through 
You did to me what I did to you 
I don't need your sympathy 
Cause you don't mean that much to me
