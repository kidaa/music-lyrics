Time

time's a teacher yesterday 
you know I had nothing but time 
why'd you have to go away 
I never got to tell you goodbye 
and time beats up on me 
life is funny, life is strange 
you know I'm just trying to get by 
money, honey, buys you things 
it can't buy a place in the sky 
and time beats up on you 
another year disappeared 
where did it go? 
people ask me 
what's the time 
I really don't know 
I really don't know 
I really don't 
I really don't know 
and time beats up on you 
and time beats up on you 
time beats up on 
time beats up on 
time beats up on 
time beats up on 
time beats up on me 
beats up on you 
beats up on you
