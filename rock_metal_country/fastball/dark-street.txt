Dark Street 

When will it stop raining? When will these dark clouds go? 
some days I get so low, but you turn me around, you turn me around 
won't you come down to my dark street, and shine a light 
'cause I need your sweet sunshine 
Won't you come down to my dark street, and shine a light 
'cause I need your sweet sunshine 
You take away my sadness and the pain inside my heart 
sometimes I fall apart, but you turn me around, you turn me around 
Won't you come down to my dark street, and shine a light 
'cause I need your sweet sunshine 
Won't you come down to my dark street, and shine a light 
'cause I need your sweet sunshine 
sunshine 
Won't you come down to my dark street, and shine a light 
'cause I need your sweet sunshine 
Won't you come down to my dark street, and shine a light 
'cause I need your sweet sunshine 
oh yeah, oh come on down, come on down 
and never leave my sky again 
shine your love light, love light, love light, love light 
down on me, down on me
