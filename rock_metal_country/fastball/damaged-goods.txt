Try to stop the world spinning 'round 
My phone bill will tell you she lives out of town 
It's been a long, long time but still I dream 
Of warm sunny days on 12th and Lorraine 
I wish you were here right now....but then 

I know I should just leave you alone 
I should just leave you alone 
I know I should just leave you alone 
I should just leave you along 

The ground moved under me 
I pushed her away with the things I'd say 
God's face grew 
Earthquake size 
And I can't cross our great divide 
I wanna live inside....but then 

I know I should just leave you alone 
I should just leave you alone
