Make Your Mama Proud 


I can still recall a time you were not so far behind 
You were only 15 and you still had piece of mind 
Now you're pushing 31, duty call you come and run 
When will this be over? When, when will you be gone? 

Chorus 1: 
I'll be your man child to be tough 
Once is never quite enough 
Giving twenty minutes in between 
If you know what I mean 

You gotta give if you wanna get 
Never let 'em see you sweat 
You may cry and you may bleed 
But only if the punch is from me,

Chorus 2: 
Why do you back down in the face of a fist fight? 
I kick myself for caring about you 
You may one day go the distance 
You might come around 
You can kill yourself or you can make your mama proud 

When you get the energy 
You can place a call to me 
My number's in the phone book 
And I'm not too hard to find 
I still live in the same old place 
I still got the same old face 
I can give you more than twenty minutes of my time
