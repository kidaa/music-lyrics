Lender
Tony Scalzo

Peel me off a fiver, that stack looks pretty thick 
Money takes some time to make we spend it all too quick 
And I'll try to remember that this is just a lender 

Chorus 
Til I'm on my feet, back in the car 
I won't forget who my friends are 
You were always there when I needed you 
I can be there too 

Loan me fifteen dollars, my wallet's getting thin 
My rent is due and I know that you, 
Have recently come in 
To a large amount of money 
Hey man, can you make that twenty? 

Chorus 

Hey haven't you heard? 
Didn't you know? 
I cleaned up six weeks ago 
I'm on the straight and narrow track 
And I can pay you back 

Chorus 

Oh, hey how ya doin'? 
No, I did not forget, 
I promised I would pay you back 
But I ain't got it yet 
And you don't have to sweat it 
I'll call you when I get it 

Chorus

I'm on the straight and narrow track 
I'll remember to pay you back 
You were always there when I needed you 
I can be there, too
