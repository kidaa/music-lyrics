She Comes Round 

She, she belongs to me 
But she doesn't know it 
She comes walking down the street 
She don't notice me 

Chorus: 
And she comes round 
She know how to turn me inside out 
Inside out, upside down 
She's got the bomb 

I'm twisted metal tongue 
When I get around you 
I stutter incomplete 
I can't keep a beat 

Chorus 

She comes round my door 
She gets me everytime 
She doesn't even notice me 
When she goes walking by
