Don't Give Up On Me 

Riding down the freeway, I've got to stay free 
I need a little leeway and an angel to watch over me 
don't give up on me 
don't give up on me 
cause I know I let you down girl 
once, twice, or maybe three 
I fell into temptation 
won't you tell me that you'll wait for me 
don't give up on me 
don't give up on me 
don't give up on me 
don't give up on me 
riding down the freeway, I've got to stay free 
I need a little leeway and an angel to watch over me 
don't give up on me 
don't give up on me 
don't give up on me 
don't give up on me 
don't give up on me, please 
don't give up on me
