Back Door 

Brown skin in the kitchen, china white 
Wash rag and the dollars, on the table 
Keep it quiet, quiet 

Chorus 
They come and go through the back door 
Who's keepin' score 
Who's keepin'.. 

Pension, weren't no mention, Medicaid? 
Sorry, and the G-man, got the word in 
Gettin' wise, Goodnight 

Chorus 

Pistol blew the whistle 
On the plan, Mexican 
And the river made of dollars 
Made of sand 

Chorus
