Out Of My Head 
Lyrics and music: Tony Scalzo


Sometimes I feel 
Like I am drunk behind the wheel 
The wheel of possibility 
However it may roll 
Give it a spin 
See if you can somehow factor in 
You know there's always more than one way 
To say exactly what you mean to say 

Chorus: 
Was I out of my head? Was I out of my mind? 
How could I have ever been so blind? 
I was waiting for an indication 
It was hard to find 
Don't matter what I say only what I do 
I never mean to do bad things to you 
So quiet but I finally woke up 
If you're sad then it's time you spoke up too 

Chorus 
Repeat Chorus
