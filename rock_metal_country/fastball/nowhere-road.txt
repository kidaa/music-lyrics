Nowhere Road 
Lyrics and music: Tony Scalzo


There's trouble on the subway 
There's something on the track 
There's a dead end waiting and 
We can't go back 
So take it to the highway 
Head back and open wide 
Step right up and take a nowhere ride 

Chorus: 
It's a nowhere road 
It's a nowhere road 
No matter where it goes it's a 
Nowhere road 
It's a nowhere road and I'm tired 
It's a nowhere job and I'm fired 
It don't matter what they say 
You can't get there going this way 

From L.A. to Miami 
And all points in between 
Look outside you get the same old scene 
You take it to the highway 
You travel far and wide 
Caterpillars carving up the country side 

Chorus 

It's a nowhere road and I'm tired 
Repeat
