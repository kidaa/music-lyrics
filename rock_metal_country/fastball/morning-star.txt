Morning Star 

As I wake I see a morning star 
through the window dimly shines 
its final statement at the closing of the day 
I've got a few more minutes of night time before I rise 
as the dawn is breaking through the darkness 
the morning star will fade but never die 
morning star, I can't see your face no more, and that's good 
get out now, out on the streets of your nowhere neighborhood 
as I laid down last night I felt no pain 
the day went on without a sound 
another night to put all the business away 
I had a few more hours of night time before I'd rise 
all the stars were out last night in the sky 
I slept right through as they all went by 
soon the dawn was breaking up the darkness 
the morning star will fade but never die 
morning star, I can't see your face no more, and that's good 
get out now, out on the streets of your nowhere neighborhood 
you come along with a color that I can't match 
gold chain and a crystal ball attached 
you're coming from the wrong direction 
and as I sleep tonight I'll dream of you 
sleeping somewhere far away 
you come into my head so pretty and so true 
I get a few more hours to dream of you till I rise 
as the fireworks shoot off in the sky 
I sleep right through as it all goes by 
soon the darkness would suck up into the dawn 
the morning star will fade but never die 
morning star, I can't see your face no more, and that's good 
get out now, out on the streets of your nowhere neighborhood 
you come along with a code that I can't crack 
gold chain and a crystal ball attached 
you were coming from the wrong direction 
you were coming from the wrong direction 
you were coming from the wrong direction
