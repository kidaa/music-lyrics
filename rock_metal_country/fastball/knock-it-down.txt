Knock It Down 
Miles Zuniga

Gonna steal your soul by remote control 
We smell an audience and we smell money 
I don't need a gun, I own the network son 
And they love baywatch in Istanbul, Yeah 

Chorus 
knock it down, knock it down, knock it down, knock it down yeah 
knock it down, knock it down, knock it down, knock it down yeah 

Forget your culture, forget your language 
I'll give you virtual reality love 

Chorus 

Repeat Chorus
