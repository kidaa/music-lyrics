Living to get his freak on 
Sporting his leopard skin thong 
Charlie the Methadone Man 
Plays Sunday nights in a rock and roll band 
Charlie the metronome, the methadone man 

Patience - the name of the game 
Waiting on Dr. Kinkaid 
Charlie the Methadone Man 
Fills out the papers just as fast as he can 
Charlie the methadone, the methadone man 

When you're all alone 
And you got nowhere to go 
Better take it slow Kicking his lonely lit brain 
Drinking to try and stay sane 
Charlie the Methadone Man 
Chases his tail just as fast as he can 
Charlie the methadone, the methadone man 

Charlie the methadone, methadone man 
Waiting.....
