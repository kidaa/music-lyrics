Altamont
Miles Zuniga

Altamont - now, won't be the same 
When we see each other again 
If it all falls apart, who is to blame? 
Don't you think it's time to get real? 
I wanna scream out the way I feel 
I'm so tired of watching you bail 

Chorus 
Hey, don't try to tell me it's okay 
Don't turn me off and walk away 
You've gotta set it straight 

Close the door, but it won't go away 
Tell me that it's at your control 
I'm not waiting for you anymore 

Chorus

Altamont, I'm on your side 
Believe it or not, I'm on your side 
It's so hard to be your friend sometimes 

Chorus 

You'd better set it straight
