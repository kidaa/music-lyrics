Wind Me Up 

Funny how I couldn't see 
this is not at all about you, it's about me 
everything has happened the way it was meant to be 
here's an opportunity for us to find 
a way for me to tell you what's been on my mind 
please forgive me, I don't mean to seem unkind 
but you wind me up, so wind me up again 
I feel the tug of war, it only seems to happen 
when we open love's door 
everything is back to the way it was before 
can you tell the difference or is it the same 
does it really count if we don't give it a name 
please forgive me, I don't mean to seem insane 
but you wind me up, better wind me up again 
funny, but I thought you knew 
all those things you think about I think about too 
gotta seperate the unreal from what is true 
here's an opportunity for us to find 
a way for me to tell you what's been on my mind 
please forgive me, I don't mean to seem unkind 
but you wind me up, so wind me up again 


French Lyrics 

Quand le vin est tir, il faut le boire / When the wine is opened, you 
must drink it 
Oh non, ce n'est pas grand chose / Oh no, it's nothing 
Ce n'est qu'un emploi provisoire / It's only a temporary job 
Oui, je comprends / Yes, I understand 
Il a ni mordicus / He denied everything 
Il trompe sa femme / He cheats on his wife 
C'est du toc / It's all fake 
C'tait trs visible / It was obvious 
Mais j'ai entendu / But I heard 
J'tais terriblement gne / I was terribly embarrassed 
C'est un cercle vicieux / It's a vicious circle 
Il a pris la poudre d'escampette / He ran away 
J'ai un maillot de bain  une pice / I have a one-piece swim suit 


Quand le vin est tire, il faut le boire 
Oh non, ce n'est pas grand chose 
Ce n'est qu'un emploi provisoire 
Oui, je comprends 
Il a nie mordicus 
Il trompe sa femme 
C'est du toc 
C'etait tres visible 
Mais j'ai entendu 
J'etais terriblement genee 
C'est un cercle vicieux 
Il a pris la poudre d'escampette 
J'ai un maillot de bain a une piece...
