Emily
Tony Scalzo

Emily shrugs and drags her heels, 
As she takes the guided tour 
It seemed like such an amazing deal 
When she was looking at the brochure 
Stuck on a bus with strangers 
Wishing she could be ay home with me 

Poor little Emily, how does it feel to be free? 

Lying in bed the pain in my head from running around all day 
Trying to find what was rightfully mine 
But I ran out of things to say 
Running around with strangers 
Wishing she could run away with me.. 

Poor little Emily, how does it feel to be free 

From familiar fingertips to a persecuted grip? 
From the pan into the fire, 
Now a thread becomes a wire 
Under which you must crawl, 
Through a ditch and over the wall 
Emily works her fingers right down to her aching bones 
While my aching head's got me stuck in bed 
Working on being alone 
Working around the clock 
Wishing she had worked it out with me 

Poor little Emily, how does it feel to be free?
