Telephone Calls 
Tony Scalzo

Telephone calls, apartment A is at it again 
Paper thin walls, 
She's been sleeping around with other men 
And other women, but right about now her head is swimming 
He's breakin' up the furniture 
Screaming and a yelling 
About to beat the hell out of her 

Television ringin' in my ear 
I've been thinking 
Haven't had a break in twenty years 
I've been drinking 

Telephone calls, insanity is just another ring away 
I get the paper, take a look at it every single day 
Another episode another life flushed down the camode 
We're all carrying such a heavy load 
I get no slack it's breaking my back 

Television ringin' in my ear, 
I've been drinking 
Haven't had a break in twenty years 
I've been thinking get me out of here 
Til the coast is clear 

Television ringin' in my ear 
I've been thinking 
Haven't had a break in twenty years 
I keep drinking 
Television ringin' in my ear 
I keep drinking liquor, wine, and beer 
I've been thinking get me out of here 
I've been thinking
