Goodbye 

Digging a hole down in your room 
I watched you disappear too young, too soon 
and you run out of stories to keep them entertained 
all of the vampires forgot your name 
you forgot why you came here today 
and so you ran away 
I said bye bye bye 
when the world has passed you by 
I will never forget your name 
do you know why? 
millions of people know what you did 
but when it hit ya, you ran and hid 
from the money and muscle 
the rules of the game 
they bought your face boy 
they bought your name 
you forgot why you came here today 
and so you ran away 
I said bye bye bye 
when the world has passed you by 
I will never forget your name 
do you know why? 
you forgot why you came here today 
and so you ran away 
I said bye bye bye 
when the world has passed you by 
I will never forget your name 
do you know why? 
I said bye bye bye 
when the world has passed you by 
I will never forget your name 
do you know why?
