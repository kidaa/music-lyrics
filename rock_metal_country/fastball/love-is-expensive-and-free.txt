Love Is Expensive And Free 
Written by Tony Scalzo 

VERSE 

You can talk to me about powder kegs 
And how I'm sitting on one right now 
You can warn me about candles 
and whole things burning from the outside in 
But don't tell me about true love 
'Cause I don't think you really know 

CHORUS 

You need to pay the costs 
You need to feel the loss 
'Cause love is expensive and free 
Love is expensive and free 

VERSE 

Talk to me about appearances 
I tell ya' lately they mean less and less 
Do your best to keep me occupied 
It's hard to concentrate, I must confess 
Don't you tell me about heartbreak 
'Cause it ain't written in the stars 

CHORUS 

You need to pay the costs 
You need to feel the loss 
'Cause love is expensive and free 
Love is expensive and free 
Alright, you got me 

VERSE 

Don't you worry 'bout my baby 
Her eyes are open all the time 
I could never bare to see her 
Much less remove her from my mind 
I didn't talk to you about true love 
I didn't think you'd understand 

CHORUS 

You need to pay the costs 
You need to feel the loss 
'Cause love is expensive and free 
Love is expensive and free 
Love is expensive and free
