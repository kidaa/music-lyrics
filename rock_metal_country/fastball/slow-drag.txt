Slow drag off a cigarette 
Slow drag and I'm lying in my bed 
All the world is sleeping like a baby tonight 
I wanna lay you down 
In the ground. Allright 

Slow drag and I can't get up now 
Slow drag. You've been messing with my mind 
All the world is sleeping like a baby tonight 
I wanna see you dead 
Laying in the muddy ground 

You're nothing to me 
Nothing to me 
Nothing to me no more 

All the world is sleeping like a baby tonight 
I wanna see you dead 
Laying in the muddy ground 

You're nothing to me 
Nothing to me 
Nothing to me no more
