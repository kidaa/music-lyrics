Sweetwater, Texas 
Lyrics and music: Miles Zuniga 

It ain't as easy as it looks 
To grow flowers in the dirt 
All my friends are living underground 

Put away your wedding ring 
Out on highway 63 
Let all your worries 
Take their place in line 

They love to tear you down 
Living in this sweet soul town 
Fall into the sound 

A place to hide and room to move 
My electric boogaloo 
Don't you worry 
The circus is in town 

They love to tear you down 
Living in this sweet soul town 
Fall into the sound
