Whatever Gets You On 

I picked up the paper 
flipped through the pages 
reached for my coffee cup 
yes, I'm still waking up 
late in the day now 
what can I say now 
some folks are morning people 
I never was one of those 
all the same 
I get in the game 
give me muddy, muddy water 
now I'm feeling better 
you know whatever gets you on 
and keeps you up right past the dawn 
I'm feeling good now 
I'm feeling great now 
let's do the town now 
vodka and tonic, a touch of the chronic 
I'd trade my days for nights 
I love the city lights 
It's none of your business 
who I might sleep with 
some things are bad for me 
and some things I just can't resist 
all the same I don't worry 
I get in the game I don't worry 
give me muddy, muddy water 
now I'm feeling better 
you know, whatever gets you on 
and keeps you up right past the dawn 
I'm feeling good now 
I'm feeling great now 
let's do the town now 
I'm feeling so free-wheelin' 
that it's so hard to contain 
fascinate me, medicate me 
'cause I can't get over the pain 
picked up the paper 
flipped through the pages 
coffee and cigarettes 
turned on the tv set 
night time is falling 
people are calling 
I like to watch them run 
round and round and round and round 
you know, whatever gets you on 
and keeps you up right past the dawn 
I'm feeling good now 
I'm feeling great now 
let's do the town now
