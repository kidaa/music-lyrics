Which Way To the Top? 
Feat. Poe
Lyrics and music: Miles Zuniga and Jeff Groves 


Where did you leave your baby 
Bleeding in her bed 
Her ghost has come to stay 
Oh, you can try, you can't chase her away 

In the bar we sit like blackbirds 
With our broken wings 
Like clocks without their springs 
Just like time doesn't mean anything 

Chorus: 
Won't you tell me 
Which way to the top? 
You know that I can't stay 
Down here 

We used to ride around in a broken down old car 
But now I'm changing trains 
Oh, and I'll hit all the notes in between 

Mom and Dad are fast asleep now 
But I'll be wide awake 
A surfer in the break 
Oh, just waiting for the perfect wave 
And a place in the shade 

Chorus 

You better get it now while 
The getting's good 
Get it now while it's happening 
You better get it now while 
The getting's good 
Get it now while it's happening, oh yeah 

Chorus 

Repeat Chorus
