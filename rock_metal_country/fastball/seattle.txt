Seattle
Miles Zuniga

Riding 'round and 'round in my car 
I can't afford to go very far 
It needs a new transmission and new brakes 
Parking tickets I cannot pay 
They're gonna have to tow me away 
Tow me away 'cause I can't afford to drive 

Chorus 
We're out of groceries again 
Ain't got no money to spend 
The credit card is maxed out, 
So let's get high 
'Cause it's raining all the time 
And the rain's been seeping through my mind 
But I get by... 

I've got a nasty rash on my rocker 
I can't afford to go see the doctor 
I know I'll be all right in a couple of weeks 
Happy hour, that's where we're meeting 
Eat for free as long as you're drinking 
Hey that ain't no problem for you and me Chorus 
Repeat Chorus 

Yeah I'm all right 
It's all right
