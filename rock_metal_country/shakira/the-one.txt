So I find a reason to shave my legs 
Each single morning 
So I count on someone on Friday nights 
To take me dancing again 
To church on Sundays 
To plant more trees 
And someday think of kids 
Or maybe just save a little money 

[Chorus:]
You're the one I need 
The way back home is always long 
But if you're close to me I'm holding on 
You're the one I need 
My real life has just begun 
Cause there's nothing like your smile made of sun 

In the world full of strangers 
You're the one I know 

So I learned to cook and finally lose 
My kitchen phobia 
And so I got the arms to cuddle in 
When there's a ghost or a news 
That brings insomnia 
To buy more thongs 
To write more happy songs 
It always takes a little help from someone 

[Chorus 2X]

You're the one I need 
You're the one I need 

Youre my  real life has just begun 

You're the one I need 
You're the one I need 

Nothing like your smile made of sun 

Nothing like your love
Nothing like your love
Nothing like your love
