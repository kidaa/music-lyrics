Well, I'm not talkin bout locking down forever, baby.
That would be too demanding.
I'm just talkin bout two lonely people
who might reach a little understanding.
I'm not talkin bout knocking out heaven
with whether we're wrong or we're right.
I'm not talkin bout hooking up and hanging out.
I'm just talkin bout tonight.

You were sitting on your bar stool
talking to some fool who
didn't have a clue.
I guess he couldn't see
you were looking right at me
cause I was looking at you too.
Then it's "do you wanna dance",
"have we ever met"
You said "hold your horses boy
I ain't that easy to get"

Well, I'm not talkin bout locking down forever, baby.
That would be too demanding.
I'm just talkin bout two lonely people
who might reach a little understanding.
I'm not talkin bout knocking out heaven
with whether we're wrong or we're right.
I'm not talkin bout hooking up and hanging out.
I'm just talkin bout tonight.

She said "I only take it slow.
By now you oughta know
that I ain't digging this.
If we can start as friends
the weekend just might end
with a little kiss."
She said "I'm a lady looking
for a man in my life
who will make a good husband.
I'll make a good wife."
Heeheeeasy now.

Well, I'm not talkin bout locking down forever, baby.
That would be too demanding.
I'm just talkin bout two lonely people
who might reach a little understanding.
I'm not talkin bout knocking out heaven
with whether we're wrong or we're right.
See, I'm not talkin bout hooking up and hanging out.
I'm just talkin bout tonight.

Yeah, I'm just talkin bout a little bit later tonight.
