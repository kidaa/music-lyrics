If you wanna go back to him, baby, get up and go
im tired of being a clown caught up in your
sideshow
night after night it never ends
its like a heavyweight fight nobody wins
and im throwin'
in the towel, enough is enough

[chorus]
Knock yourself out, break me in two
you gotta go do what you gotta do
i gave you my best shot, but
you didnt fall
head over heels in love after all
i dont wanna hear no more, baby, theres the door

theres nothin left to fight about
knock yourself out

oh, lets not pull any punches while we're standin here toe to toe
if you're gonna leave me here,
baby go on, go

[repeat chorus]

oh knock yourself out

if you wanna go back to him, baby, get up and go
