This world's a jungle there ain't no justice
Laws of nature rule this land
Better hide your horses, bury your whiskey
Hold your woman any way you can

Cause there ain't no right or wrong, nothing's carved in stone
It ain't cheating if you don't get caught
Jokers laugh and losers grieve
Cause out here there's no honor among thieves

That woman you've been loving, she was another man's
You stole her heart while his nack was turned
On every corner there's an outlaw waiting
Who wants to teach you what you never learned

Cause there ain't no right or wrong, nothing's carved in stone
It ain't cheating if you don't get caught
Jokers laugh and losers grieve
Cause out here there's no honor among thieves

This world's a jungle there ain't no justice
Laws of nature rule this land
So don't go crying when her love goes flying to
The thieving arms of another man

There ain't no right or wrong, nothing's carved in stone
It ain't cheating if you don't get caught
Love's a deck of cards read them and weep
Cause out here there's no honor among thieves

Yeah
There ain't no right or wrong
Nothing's carved in stone
