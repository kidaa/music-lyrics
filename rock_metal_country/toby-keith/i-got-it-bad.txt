I got it bad
i got it blue
i got it sad
i aint got you
i did you wrong
you got the right
look
what i had
i got it bad

gone and left me lonely cryin' like a fool
i just cant belive love could be so cruel

i got it bad
i got it blue
i got it sad
i aint got you
i did you wrong
you got the right
look
what i had
i got it bad

i know someday ill get on my feet again
ill get over you but baby, until then

i got it bad
i got it blue
i got it sad
i aint got you
i did you wrong
you got the right
look
what i had
i got it bad

look what i had
i got it bad
