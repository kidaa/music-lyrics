Met you in a caf 
At a table meant for two 
You were sitting by your lonesome 
When I sat down with you 
Tried hard not to show it 
But I couldn't help but see 
That you wore your broken heart out on your sleeve 
And your loneliness could not disguise 
The beauty and the charm 
Thought if I ever get you, shattered lady, in my arms 

Chorus: 

I'm gonna rock you baby to sleep 
I'm gonna make you crazy over me 
I'm gonna hold you like you've never been held before 
And love you till you tell me you can't love anymore 
I'm gonna shake your emotion right down to your soul 
And then I'm gonna love you all over in and out of control 
If this is how love is supposed to feel 
Baby I know I've fallen head over heels 
I'm gonna rock you baby 

Over open conversation and a bottle of red wine 
You said this world is full of users and I know that I've had mine 
We danced a little slow dance until they closed that caf down 
You said 'what would be the chances that tonight I finally found 
Someone who makes me feel like my life is just begun?' 
I said 'girl believe in me and I'll show you how it's done' 

Chorus
