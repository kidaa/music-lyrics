I used to come home late and not a minute too soon
Barking like a dog, howling at the moon
You'd be mad as an ol' red hen
Up all night wonderin' where I been
I'd fall down and say come help me honey
You laughed outloud I guess you thought it was funny
I sobered up and I got to thinkin'
Girl you ain't much fun since I quit drinkin'

Now I'm paintin' the house and I'm mendin' the fence
I guess I gone out and lost all my good sense
Too much work is hard for your health
I could've died drinkin', now I'm killing myself
And I'm feedin' the dog, sackin' the trash
It's honey do this honey do that
I sobered up and I got to thinkin'
Girl you ain't much fun since I quit drinkin'

Now I'm fixin' the sink and I'm mowin' the grass
You made me a list and I'm bustin' my wheel
All broke down, tail's been draggin'
It's a tough ol' life up here on the wagon
I'm feedin' the dog, sackin' the trash
It's honey do this honey do that
I sobered up and I got to thinkin'
Girl you ain't much fun since I quit drinkin'
Yeah I sobered up and I got to thinkin'
Girl you ain't much fun since I quit drinkin'
