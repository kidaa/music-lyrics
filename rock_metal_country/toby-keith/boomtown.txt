The people came here from parts unknown 
Sleepin' in their cars 'cause they didn't have homes 
Thought this place was the promised land 
If you could roughneck, we could use a good man 
Come on boy let me show you around 
You could make a lot of money here 
Livin' in a boomtown 

We'll some build bars and big hotels 
Downshift drive and the people live well 
High on the hog and wild on the range 
Pocket full of cash instead of chump change 
This place kicks when the sun goes down 
Ain't life great when you're livin' in a boomtown 

See oil was the blood that flowed through the soul 
To keep a man workin' when it's forty below 
Relent to the devil in the cold cold ground 
Trying to make a dollar here livin' in a boomtown 

Six short years the oil fields went 
Rigs came down and the money got spent 
And the wisemen saved for a rainy day 
The fools packed up and moved away 
The hotels closed and the bars shut down 
And it got real quite livin' in a boomtown 

See oil was the blood that flowed through the soul 
To keep a man workin' when it's forty below 
Relent to the devil in the cold cold ground 
Trying to make a dollar here livin' in a boomtown 

Now the cafe's filled with people tellin' lies 
Trying to figure out how the town went dry 
You can buy a house a dime on the dollar 
Need a good home just give me a holler 
I can move you in with no money down 
Still tryin' to make a dollar here livin' in a boomtown 

Livin' in a boomtown 
Livin' in a boomtown
