I bet you've never heard ol' Marshall Dillion say
Miss Kitty have you ever thought of running away
Settling down would you marry me
If I asked you twice and begged you pretty please
She'd of said yes in a New York minute
They never tied the knot
His heart wasn't in it
He stole a kiss as he road away
He never hung his hat up at Kitty's place

I should've been a cowboy
I should've learned to rope and ride
Wearing my six-shooter riding my pony on a cattle drive
Stealing the young girl's heart
Just like Gene and Roy
Singing those campfire songs
Oh I should've been a cowboy

I might of had a side kick with a funny name
Running wild through the hills chasing Jesse James
Ending up on the brink of danger
Riding shotgun for the Texas Rangers
Go west yound man, haven't you been told
California's full of whisky, women and gold
Sleeping out all night beneath the desert stars
Dream in my eye and a prayer in my heart

I should've been a Cowboy
I should've learned to rope and ride
Wearing my six-shooter riding my pony on a cattle drive
Stealing the young girl's hearts
Just like Gene and Roy
Singing those campfire songs
Oh I should've been a cowboy

I should've been a Cowboy
I should've learned to rope and ride
I'd be wearing my six-shooter riding my pony on a cattle drive
Stealing the young girl's hearts
Just like Gene and Roy
Singing those campfire songs
Oh I should've been a Cowboy
Yeah I should've been a Cowboy
Yeah I should've been a Cowboy
