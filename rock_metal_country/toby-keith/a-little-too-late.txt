[chorus]
Its a little too late
Im a little too gone, 
A little too tired of this hangin on
So Im letting go while Im still strong enough to
Its got a little too sad
Im a little too blue
Its a little too bad
You were too good to be true
Im big time over you baby
Its a little too late

No I dont want to want to talk about what we can do about us anymore
Only time you and me wastin is the time it takes to walk right out that door
Yeah talk about water under the bridge,
You should know by now girl thats all this is

[chorus]
Its a little too late,
Im a little too gone, 
A little too tired of just hangin on
Im letting go while Im still strong enough to
Its got a little too sad,
Im a little too blue
Its a little too bad
You were too good to be true
Im big time over you baby
Its a little too late

There was a time,
this heart of mine,
would take you back every time
dont you know
Its been two packs of cigaretts
a sleepless night
a nervous wreck, a day ago.
Now you aint got no business coming around
Im closing up shop
Shuttin us down

[chorus]
Its a little too late,
Im a little too gone, 
A little too tired of just hangin on
Im letting go while Im still strong enough to
Its got a little too sad,
Im a little too blue
Its a little too bad
You were too good to be true
Im big time over you baby
Its a little too late
Im big time over you baby,
Its a little too late
