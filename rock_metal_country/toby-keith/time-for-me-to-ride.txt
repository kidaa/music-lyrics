Ain't got no tricks up my sleeve
Ain't got no reason to believe
I've been looking for a sign
Love shouldn't be so hard to find
I've been sleeping on your couch
Just been layin' here alone.
I've been doing without 
Oh, you've been doing me wrong
Nothing left here to decide
I think it's time for me to ride...

[Chorus:]
Put my bike out on the highway
Feel that wind all in my face
Breathe some air that tastes like freedom
Yeah, let that be my saving grace
Somebody loved, somebody lied
I believe it's time for me to ride

Should've known right from the start
I couldn't tame your faithless heart
I could see the writing on the wall
I've never been the kind to crawl
Girl you're never satisfied
I believe it's time for me to ride

[Chorus x2]

Somebody loved, somebody lied
I believe it's time for me to ride
