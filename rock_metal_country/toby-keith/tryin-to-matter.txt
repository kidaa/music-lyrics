I'm a lonely man with a lonely life
A full-time job and part-time wife
And the grindstone just goes on and on
You're a lonely girl that's a lonely wife
Gotta three bedroom and an empty life
And you're not quite sure
Just where it all went wrong
There are lots of reasons why we should turn and walk away
But there's a whole lot ridin' on this love so baby what's ya say

Let's give it one good shot
Let's really give it all we got
We can take it nice and slow
Baby don't you want to go back
Where we had a chance
And we danced our dance
In a world where a heart could never shatter
We might go down cryin' 
But at least our love will die
Tryin' to matter, tryin' to matter

We've come a long way so don't forget
let's don't throw our hands up yet
We've still got time
To change our mind
Honey let's give it our best tonight
If we still ain't got it right
We can always, always say goodbye
Somewhere I guess we let go, lost a little ground
One solitary heartbeat can turn this thing around

Let's give it one good shot
Let's really give it all we got
We can take it nice and slow
Baby don't you want to go back
Where we had a chance
And we danced our dance
In a world where a heart could never shatter
We might go down cryin' 
But at least our love will die
Tryin' to matter
We might go down cryin'
At least our love will die
Tryin' to matter, tryin' to matter
