Budweiser clock says it's almost twelve
I tipped the bartender, he rang that old bell
San Bernardino nights are great but they sure don't feel like home
Right now in Tulsa they've turned up the lights
The band has stopped playin', they've called it a night
She's makin' her way to the front door I know
She won't be leavin' alone

If it's midnight in California, must be closin' time in Oklahoma
I know that she's already danced another night away
And these west coast nights sure seem colder
Knowin' somebody else's arms will hold her
Midnight in California means it's closin' time at home

I thought this distance between us might help me forget
But I've been here two weeks and it ain't happened yet
A change of scenery hasn't done a thing to change her mind

Oh, these west coast nights sure seem colder
Knowin' somebody else's arms will hold her
Midnight in California means it's closin' time at home
Yeah, midnight in California means it's closin' time at home
