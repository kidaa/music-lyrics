Hey Daddy!!
Oh yeah
Well I am a big dog daddy you know my face and the joint starts rockin when I walk in the place
The band starts stompin those rhythm guitars.
And the dance floor is jumpin through the back of the bar
Everybody looks better in the neon lights.
When a plan comes together on a Saturday night.

Yea the parking lot is packed and that's a pretty good sign.
I take it right in the back I don't stand in line.
The boys all lookin and a hittin the spot
Sayin the girls start shaking everything they got
When a little cat momma gets ready to ride.
I got Lincoln continental waitin right outside.

I am a big dog daddy, Yea a big dog daddy.
Boys stand back and Girls are gettin caddy.
Something goin down with the big dog daddy.

You gotta stay out late if you are makin the rounds
cause there are a lot of good joints on the way downtown.
I got some good buddies that can rock all night.
They ain't looking for trouble but they know how to fight.

If your girl starts acting like she is one of a kind, ya grab the next one standin at the head of line.

I am a big dog daddy, Yea a big dog daddy.
Got some miles screaming from here to Cincinnati, try to compete with the big dog daddy.

I am a big dog daddy, Yea a big dog daddy.
Boys stand back and Girls are gettin caddy.
Something goin down with the big dog, big dog

Big dog daddy, just big dog daddy.
Boys stand back and Girls are gettin caddy.
Something goin down with the big dog daddy.

Got em all screaming from here to Cincinnati, try to compete with the big dog daddy.

Let's roll......
