Daddy was a gambler
Back in seventy-two
He had a taste for the nightlife and he
Loved his booze
He had a woman on one arm
And a tattoo on the other
It was hard to read I don't know what it said
Somethin' about my mother

I stood over his shoulder back in Bakersfield
He had some rhinestone boots with those high ridin' heels
He bet a ton of money
On a hand I thought was dead
When those sevens cleaned the table up
He just looked around and said

Sometimes you win
Sometimes you won't
Sometimes you beat that devil
Sometimes you don't
We're all just killin' time
Til the good Lord calls us home
And the best that you can hope for is to die
With your boots on

I drive a big rig from shore to shore
I've got a woman beside me
And my name out on the door
Can't make no money
If I don't outrun the man
That's why you find me streakin' through the night
Catch me if you can

Sometimes you win
Sometimes you won't
Sometimes you beat that devil
Sometimes you don't
We're all just killin' time
Til the good Lord calls us home
And the best that you can hope for is to die

Sometimes you win
Sometimes you won't
Sometimes you outrun that devil
Sometimes you don't
We're all just killin' time
Til the good Lord calls us home
And the best that you can hope for is to die
With your boots on
With your boots on
