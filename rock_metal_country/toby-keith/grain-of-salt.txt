Yeah when I came to you were standing by the foot of the bed,
I was still hung over, and my eyes were bloodshot and red,
Did you think that things were going to be different? 
Did you think you tore my whole world apart?
But as you can see theres no pain in my head
And down in this old broken heart

[chorus]
I took your leaving with a grain of salt,
Tequila and a slice of lime,
Yeah the minute you left,
Me and the boys went out and had a real good time,
Its nice of you to check up on me,
Just to see how I was getting along
But I had already gotten over it baby,
Before you were even gone

By now you have observed 
I was a little over-served last night,
I need to catch a few Zs
Baby please turn off that bedroom light,
See the boys are coming by to get me,
Were going to take our little show into town,
Ill need my rest cause theyll be doing there best
To find another juke joint now?

[chorus]
I took your leaving with a grain of salt,
Tequila and a slice of lime,
Yeah the minute you left,
Me and the boys went out and had a real good time,
Its nice of you to check up on me
Just to see how I was getting along,
But I had already gotten over it baby,
Before you were even gone

Yeah I had already gotten way over it baby,
Before you were even gone
Bye now
