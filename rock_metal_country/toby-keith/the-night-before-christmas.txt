Ribbons and paper cover the floor
It's been a good Christmas, presents galore
Everyone's happy, I'm happy, too
Cause oh, what a night
Oh, what a night
Night before Christmas I had with you

Frost on the window, snow on the ground
Holiday spirit, holiday sounds
Everyone's thankful, I'm thankful, too
Cause oh, what a night
Oh, what a night
Night before Christmas I had with you

It all started underneath that mistletoe
While we were waiting up
To help ol' Santa Claus
We were making merry
In ways we'd never thought of
Then we heard those sleigh bells
Ol' Santa almost caught us

No we didn't take pictures
But I'll always remember
One very special twenty-fourth day of December
Cause oh, what a night
Oh, what a night
Night before Christmas I had with you

It all started underneath that mistletoe
While we were waiting up
To help ol' Santa Claus
We were making merry
In ways we'd never thought of
Then we heard those sleigh bells
Ol' Santa almost caught us

If we don't do it next year
Honey, I'm sure gonna miss it
Why don't we make it a new Yuletide tradition
Cause oh, what a night
Oh, what a night
Night before Christmas I had with you
Cause oh, what a night
Oh, what a night
Night before Christmas I had with you
