If I could invent a time machine
Then maybe we'd both be seventeen
Cruising in my first car, and actin' like movie stars on a Friday night
Do you remember those Friday nights

We were a rock ready to roll there was a fire down in our souls
And all the whole world had to stand still then turn around us
'Cause that was the deal
And oh how those nights went flowing like wine
When I was all yours and you were all mine
And we were in love yeah we were in love

I can still see you when I sleep
There is a picture I still keep
You with your hair in the wind
And me with that crazy grin under summer skies when dreams where too young to die

We were a rock ready to roll there was a fire down in our souls
And all the whole world had to stand still then turn around us
'Cause that was the deal
And oh how those nights went flowing like wine
When I was all yours and you were all mine
And we were in love yeah we were in love

Oh I know I know it sounds crazy but baby your still the one
So let's find a way to bring back the days when our hearts were forever young

And we were a rock ready to roll there was a fire down in our souls
And all the whole world had to stand still then turn around us
'Cause that was the deal
And oh how those nights went flowing like wine
When I was all yours and you were all mine
And we were in love yeah we were in love
Oh we were in love
Oh we were in love
