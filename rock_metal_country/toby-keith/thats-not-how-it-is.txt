I woke up in bed last night when something came upon me 
I was not lying there alone but I've never felt so lonely 
Something's come between us, girl feels like we've hit a wall 
How can I know just how you feel when we don't touch at all 
This no communication thing is quickly growing old 
This isolation booth I'm in is dark and turning cold 
I used to steal your breath away with just one little kiss 
Me and you, we were so in love back then but that's not how it is 

But I'd catch moonlight in a bottle if we could drink a toast to happiness 
Fill my pickup bed with roses and back it right up to your door 
I'd write your name in candy kisses from here to Carolina 
If you change your mind and love me like before but that's not how it is 

I have tossed and turned and rolled it over in my mind 
Not knowing all the questions make the answers hard to find 
I think I've covered everything but still there's something that I've missed 
I used to read you baby like a book but that's not how it is 

But I'd catch moonlight in a bottle if we could drink a toast to happiness 
Fill my pickup bed with roses and back it right up to your door 
I'd write your name in candy kisses from here to Carolina 
If you change your mind and love me like before but that's not how it is 

I'd write your name in candy kisses from here to Carolina 
If you change your mind and love me like before but that's not how it is 
That's not how it is 
That's not how it is
