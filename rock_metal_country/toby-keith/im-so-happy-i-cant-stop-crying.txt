feat. Sting

Seven weeks have passed now since she left me
She shows her face to ask me how I am
She says the kids are fine and that they miss me
Maybe I could come and baby-sit sometime

She says, "are you o.k I was worried about you
Can you forgive me I hope that you'll be happy"
I said, "I'm so happy that I can't stop crying
I'm so happy I'm laughing through my tears"

I saw a friend of mine he said, "I was worried about you
I heard she had another man, I wondered how you felt about it"
I'm so happy that I can't stop crying
I'm so happy I'm laughing through my tears

Saw my lawyer, Mr. good news he got me
Joint custody and legal separation
So I'm so happy that I can't stop crying
I'm laughing through my tears,
I'm laughing through my tears

I took a walk alone last night
I looked up at the stars
To try to find an answer in my life

I chose a star for me I chose a star for him
I chose two stars for my kids and one star for my wife
Something made me smile
Something seemed to ease the pain
Something about the universe and how it's all connected

The park is full of sunday fathers and melted ice cream
We try to do the best within the given time
A kid should be with his mother everybody knows that
What can a father do but baby-sit sometimes

I saw that friend of mine, he said, "you look different somehow"
I said, "everybody's got to leave the darkness sometime"
I said, "I'm so happy that I can't stop crying
I'm laughing through my tears
I'm laughing through my tears"
I'm so happy that I can't stop crying
I'm laughing through my tears
