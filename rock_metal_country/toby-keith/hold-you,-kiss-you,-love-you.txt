You're lookin' at me
Like the first time we met
I can tell that you're needing
That feeling you get when I
Hold you, kiss you, love you
Hold you, kiss you, love you

So darlin' surrender
Right here in my arms
Love will be waiting
Wherever we are when I
Hold you, kiss you, love you
Hold you, kiss you, love you

Just close your eyes
And I'll take you away
Let go of everything
Whisper my name when I
Hold you, kiss you, love you
Like I do

Hold you, kiss you, love you
Hold you, kiss you, love you

Just close your eyes
And I'll take you away
Let go of everything
Whisper my name when I
Hold you, kiss you, love you
Like I do

When tangled sheets
In the dark of the night
I'll wake you up in the
Sweet mornin' light when I
Hold you, kiss you, love you

Just close your eyes
And I'll take you away
Let go of everything
Whisper my name when I
Hold you, kiss you, love you
Like I do
