[Verse 1]

Sometimes think the war is necessary
Every night I pray for peace on earth
And I hand down my dollars to the homeless
But believe that every able soul should work

[Pre Chorus]

My father gave me my shotgun
That I'll hand down to my son
Try to teach him everything it means

[Chorus]

I'm a man of my convictions
Call me wrong, call me right
But I bring my better angels to every fight
You may not like where I'm goin'
But you sure know where I stand
Hate me if you want to
Love me if you can

[Verse 2]

I stand by my right to speak freely
But I worry 'bout what kids learn from TV
And before all of debatin' turns to angry words and hate
Sometimes we should just agree to disagree

[Pre Chorus]

And I believe that Jesus
Looks down here and sees us
And if you ask him, he would say

[Chorus Out]
