Never owned a brand new car 
Never worked in a white collar 
Never held a woman longer 
Than I held one single dollar 
I never went out chasin' rainbows 
'Cause there can't be that much to it 
Even if I found my pot of gold 
I know I'd piss right through it 

I can't remember ever wanting 
For one second of my life 
Even if I did it cost too much 
To ever pay the price 
I don't dance out on the dark side 
Ain't no secrets I have to tell 
So you don't have to say a prayer for me 
I just said one for myself 

Chorus: 
I'm livin' my life 
Under my terms 
I'm callin' the shots 
As far as I can see 
I don't owe nobody nothin' 
I don't answer to a soul 
Might not work for you 
But it works for me 

I've been bent and bruised and broken 
And flat busted once or twice 
I brought most of it upon myself 
But I never compromised 
My pride's too hard to swallow 
So I've chewed a lot of it 
Mild-mannered and soft-hearted 
And hard-headed as you get 
I live out on the backroads 
Where I walk my country mile 
And if it's so good in the city 
Why don't anybody smile? 
The traffic's always heavy 
And the air ain't fit to breathe 
I ain't saying that it's wrong for you 
It just don't make sense to me 

Chorus
