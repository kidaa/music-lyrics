Guess it slipped my mind
Now I'm in trouble deep
See the last two years in a row I forgot
Our anniversary
So I come Rushin' in
Twelve roses in bloom
Said honey would you like a romantic evening
Out under the stars and the moon

She didn't say no
But in her eyes I could see
That this wouldn't turn out to be
The enchanted evening I thought it would be
Yes I sure found out
I got a long way to go
She didn't say no
She said hell no

Then we split the sheets
About six months ago
I told all my buddies down at the bar
This cowboy's headed home
Walked into her house
Yeah climbed right up in her bed
When I asked her if she still loved me
Man you know what she said

Oh she didn't say no
But in her eyes I could see
Ah this wouldn't turn out to be
The fairytale ending I thought it might be
But I sure found out
I got a long way to go
She didn't say no
She said hell no

Yeah I sure found out
I got a long way to go
She didn't say no
She said hell no
