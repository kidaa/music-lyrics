It's not because she's always satisfied
Or that she's so easy to please
She showed me what love's about
That's for sure and I don't mean maybe
Absolutely, there's no doubt, boys
Nothin's too good for my baby

She's gotta have it, she's gonna get it
That's what she wants, that's what I'm gonna do
No matter what it takes, the sky's the limit
She's gotta have it, she's gonna get it

She don't ask for much of anything
But when she does, I give my all
All it takes is one sweet touch
And I go where her love takes me
I can't seem to get enough
Man, when it comes to my baby

She's gotta have it, she's gonna get it
That's what she wants, that's what I'm gonna do
No matter what it takes, the sky's the limit
She's gotta have it, she's gonna get it

She showed me what love's about
That's for sure and I don't mean maybe
Absolutely, there's no doubt, boys
Nothin's too good for my baby

She's gotta have it, she's gonna get it
That's what she wants, that's what I'm gonna do
No matter what it takes, the sky's the limit
She's gotta have it

She's gotta have it, she's gonna get it
That's what she wants, that's what I'm gonna do
No matter what it takes, the sky's the limit
She's gotta have it, she's gonna get it
