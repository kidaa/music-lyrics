I'm the one who gets that look in your eye
And I'm the one who feels you tremble inside
I'm the one who steals those kisses from your breath
Sometimes it's so good at night it scares me to death
Thinkin' what would I do if I didn't have you
I'm as strong, strong as I can be
But ooh ooh ooh, baby you leave me weak

Put my hands upon your skin
And it warms me to the touch
All that I can think about while we're makin' love
Is I'm the only one who knows how passionate you get
About all of our deepest little secrets that we've kept
As the night gets longer, girl you just get stronger
And you pour yourself all over me
Ooh ooh ooh, baby you leave me weak

And it always blows me away, by the power that you hold
When the moment kicks in, and the magic unfolds
And you wrap your love around me and it brings me to my knees
Will you give me strength, all the strength that I need

As the night gets longer, girl you just get stronger
And you pour yourself all over me
Ooh ooh ooh, baby you leave me weak
Ooh ooh ooh, baby you leave me weak
