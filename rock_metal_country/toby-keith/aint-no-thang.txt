I let another one get away 
She said she's gone for good 
But that's all old hat now 
I always thought she would 

To tell you the truth 
I'm prepared to fall apart 
It's just like deja vu 
I know it all by heart 

It ain't no thang, I already know how it feels 
Same ol' pain, a different deal 
So if it looks like rain, I'm gonna let it rain 
'Cause I know , it ain't no thang 

Well I tried the crying thang 
But it only made it hurt 
That silly drinkin' thang 
Only made it worse 

Girls are gonna come 
And girls are gonna go 
The only thang I'm sure of 
The only thang I know 

It ain't no thang, I already know how it feels 
Same ol' pain, a different deal 
So if it looks like rain, I'm gonna let it rain 
'Cause I know , it ain't no thang 

It ain't no thang, I already know how it feels 
Same ol' pain, a different deal 
So if it looks like rain, I'm gonna let it rain 
'Cause I know , it ain't no thang
