Woke up this morning with day old coffee
Smoked what was left of your cigarette
Sit by the phone just in case you call me
It ain't ringing yet
You're probably half way to Albuquerque
You'll hang a north up to Santa Fe
You'll never know just how much it hurt me
To watch you walk away

From my blue bedroom
I've got a sad and lonely view
Of a melancholy moon
My pillow smells like your perfume
Missing you in my blue bedroom

You never told me why you were leaving
I guess you did what you had to do
If you find that love is what you're needing
It's waiting here for you

From my blue bedroom
I've got a sad and lonely view
Of a melancholy moon
My pillow smells like your perfume
Missing you in my blue bedroom

You left a red dress, some purple shoes
That silver comb that you never used
A yellow ribbon from your hair
Baby you're still everywhere

In my blue bedroom

In my blue bedroom
I've got a sad and lonely view
Of a melancholy moon
My pillow smells like your perfume
Missing you
I'm needing you
Baby I want you
In my blue bedroom
