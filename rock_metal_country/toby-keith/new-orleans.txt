He was twenty-five, she was twenty-eight
He was home grown country, she'd just pulled off the interstate
She bought a Dr. Pepper, ten dollars worth of gas
She was ovbiously lost but too afraid to ask directions
So he offered her a smile and a stick of Beech Nut gum
He said where you headed to girl, where are you coming from
She said

New Orleans but that's another story
New Orleans that's another time
That's another town, that's another life

Couple of months later they were living on his parent's street
He worked the station and she worked the store
And then they had a baby and
Then they had one more little Jesse

When she dropped the kids off at the mother's day out
All the ladies had their questions

New Orleans but that's another story
New Orleans that's another time
That's another town, that's another life

Wednesday night supper at the First Baptist Church
Stranger standin' in the doorway
As they're passin' out the dessert

After everything you did"...in

New Orleans but that's another story
New Orleans that's another time
That's another town, that's another life

That's another town, that's another life
