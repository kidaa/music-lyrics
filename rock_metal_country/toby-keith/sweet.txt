She came through the front door lookin' fast as a big train
Bookin' down the line
And she was lookin' fine
Long and lean and dressed to kill
Stacked up high with perfect wheels 
and there ain't no chance, that girl would ever dance with me
She got all those city boys pushin' and shovin'
A counrty boy like me don't ever get no uptown lovin'

She's Sweet, she's got 'em melting in her hand
Whoever gets a taste of that cup of sugar
Sure is a lucky man
She's sweet, tellin you boys
She's babelicious, I can't reach that Georgia peach
But she sure looks delicious

I had nothing else to do
So I threw down two more shots of booze
And it made me strong
I strapped my courage on
I said 'would you like a drink?
'By chance, no what I mean is would you like to dance with me?
Please.' in my best southern ease
It got hot on the dance floor when she whispered in my ear
'I think I found my county boy, let's get out of here.'

I said 'sweet'.
I'm melting in her hand
I feel like a spoon in a cup of blonde sugar
Y'all looking at the lucky man
I said 'sweet'
mmm boys she's babelicious
That Georgia peach is now in my reach
And don't she look delicious?

Look here now, she's sweet
I'm melting in her hand
I feel like a spoon in a cup of blonde sugar
Y'all looing at the lucky man
She's sweet, mmm boys she's babelicious
That Georgia peach is now in my reach
And don't she look delicious?
She's sweet.
