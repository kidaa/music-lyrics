I can leave my dirty laundry lyin' anywhere
I don't make my bed it's alright, no one ever goes in there
I can fall asleep on the couch and leave the tv on
'Cause I've got the whole place to myself
Now that all her things are gone

And lucky me, I've got room to breathe
With her out of my way, I'm not crowded anymore
And finally, I've got all the space I need to walk the floor
Lucky me

Now I've got last week's dishes still piled up in the sink
And lots of time here on my hands to sit around and think
I'm better off in this house alone, it's a blessing in disguise
And her leavin' came along, I know
Right at the perfect time

And lucky me, I've got room to breathe
With her out of my way, I'm not crowded anymore
And finally, I've got all the space I need to walk the floor
Lucky me

That sure was a close call, someone could have been hurt
Yeah, she could be missin' me, but that's not what I've heard

And lucky me, I've got room to breathe
With her out of my way, I'm not crowded anymore
And finally, I've got all the space I need to walk the floor
Lucky me
Lucky me, I've got all the space I need
Lucky me, I've got room to breathe
Lucky me
