I see you standin' in the sun
Like an iron dinosaur
Got your tired head restin'
On a West Texas floor
We were really something son
Back in our time
Yeah we broke a lot of hearts
And we made a lot of dimes

Pump Jack pump Jack
Pump a little more
'Cause Daddy's cut it thin
At the general store
Gentleman's dime don't float that long
Hey pump Jack pump before my good name's gone

You know I lost my baby to a wildcat dream
I was fueled by the crude and the gasoline
It's hard to settle down with a roustabout
That oil burns hot 'till the oil burns out

Pump Jack pump Jack
Pump a little more
'Cause Daddy's cut it thin
At the general store
A gentleman's dime don't float that long
Hey pump Jack pump before my good name's gone

Standin' in the panhandle
Cussin' this well
Wishing like the devil
Praying like hell
At the end of this string is a pot of black gold
Sittin' in the bottom of another giant hole

Pump Jack pump Jack
Pump a little more
'Cause Daddy's cut it thin
At the general store
A gentleman's dime don't float that long
Hey pump Jack pump before my good name's gone

Yeah pump Jack pump before my good name's gone

Pump Jack pump Jack
Pump a little more
Pump Jack pump Jack
Pump a little more
Yeah pump Jack pump Jack
Pump a little more
Pump Jack pump Jack
Pump a little more
