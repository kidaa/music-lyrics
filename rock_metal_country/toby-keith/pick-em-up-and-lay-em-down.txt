She said the man's goin' home with me
She told the bar she was takin' all bets
Well never trust a woman drinkin' whiskey
That lights her own cigarette
I started callin' her baby, temptation was drivin' me wild
I think the only thing that saved me
It's just not my style

'Cause I'm not the kind of man that goes out just lookin' for a woman
I like the price you pay to keep passion on solid ground
I'm not the kind of man that holds out on a need for nothin'
I'm as lonely as any man around
I just don't like to pick 'em up and lay 'em down
Lay 'em down
Pick 'em up and lay 'em down

So we went from bottoms up to coffee cups
A corner booth where the lights got dim
We started talkin' 'bout gettin' real close
About how, and about when
It started rainin' harder and harder
I got up and with a thoughtful smile
I said, "Honey, if that ain't thunder and lightnin'
It just ain't worthwhile"

I'm not the kind of man that goes out just lookin' for a woman
I like the price you pay to keep passion on solid ground
I'm not the kind of man that holds out on a need for nothin'
I'm as lonely as any man around
I just don't like to pick 'em up and lay 'em down
Lay 'em down, down, down, down, down

I turned around and gave her one last smile
And thought about one long kiss
But that would be takin' it too far baby
And maybe something I couldn't resist

I'm not the kind of man that goes out just lookin' for a woman
I like the price you pay to keep passion on solid ground
I'm not the kind of man that holds out on a need for nothin'
I'm as lonely as any man around
I just don't like to pick 'em up and lay 'em down
Lay 'em down
Pick 'em up and lay 'em down
Lay 'em down

If it ain't about thunder and lightnin'
It just ain't worthwhile
Lord knows it just ain't my style
Pick 'em up and lay 'em down, down, down, down, down
Pick 'em up and lay 'em down
