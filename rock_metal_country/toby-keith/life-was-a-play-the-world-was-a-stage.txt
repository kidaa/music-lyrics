Lookin' back on my younger days 
Life was a play and the world a stage 
Lust, love and greed were in my heart 
I thought I had to play each part 

I'd skip school and get in a fight 
Had a different girl every Friday night 
But it all came out in the wash 
Dad always said boys will be boys 

Mom and dad backed me through it all 
Picked me up each time I'd fall 
In fact they called it growing pains 
And said all kids must try such things 
They kept the faith and brought me through 
I still make a mistake or two 
Lookin' back on my younger days 
Life was a play and the world a stage 

I lost my driver's license twice 
For speeding and running red lights 
But like all kids I lived and learned 
Play with fire and you'll get burned 

I bucked the system day and night 
Smoked cigarettes and tried the wine 
Thought breakin' rules was bein' cool 
It's clear to me now I was a fool 

Mom and dad backed me through it all 
Picked me up each time I'd fall 
In fact they called it growing pains 
And said all kids must try such things 
They kept the faith and brought me through 
I still make a mistake or two 
Lookin' back on my younger days 
Life was a play and the world a stage 

Yeah everything turned out ok 
Life was a play and the world a stage
