Thought I'd call you up 
See if had celebrated
Day you were born
It's a little belated
Age is just a number
It's really over rated to me

Yea November third
That's a day I remember 
Cuz its thirty seven days after mine in September
You'd thought I forgot
Cuz here it is December again

Oh, happy birthday baby
Wanna to see you tonight
I got your present waitin
I wanna do it right
I ain't got enough money for a big diamond ring
Let's tie a brand new bow around the same old thing

Yea

Now blow
Out your candles

Yea happy birthday baby
Want to see you tonight
I got your present waitin
And I wanna do it right
I ain't got enough money for a big diamond ring
Let's tie a brand new bow around the same old thing

It'd be cool if we could make an ending for it
