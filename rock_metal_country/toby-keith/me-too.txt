If I send you roses for no reason at all
If out of the blue I stop and give you a call
Once in a while it's breakfast in bed
And then pull the covers back up over our heads

If I call in sick just to stay home with you
I want you to know why I do what I do
It's my way of sayin' what I can't express
But I want you to know girl I'm doin' my best

Oh I'm just a man that's the way I was made
I'm not too good at sayin' what you need me to say
It's always right there on the tip of my tongue
It might go unsaid but it won't go undone
So when those three little words come so easy to you
I hope you know what I mean when I say, me too

If you should wake up and catch me watchin' you sleep
And I break the silence by kissin' your cheek
If I whisper somethin' you don't understand
Don't make me repeat it I don't know if I can

Oh I'm just a man that's the way I was made
I'm not too good at sayin' what you need me to say
It's always right there on the tip of my tongue
It might go unsaid but it won't go undone
So when those three little words come so easy to you
I hope you know what I mean when I say, me too

Me too, me too, hope you know what I mean when I say
Me too, me too
