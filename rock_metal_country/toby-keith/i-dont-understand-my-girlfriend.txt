I thought it would be dandy
If I bought that girl some candy
How was I suppose to know she was allergic to chocolate
I thought it would be fine
If we shared a glass of wine
She said, "Oh no, not another alcoholic"

I don't understand my girlfriend
I haven't got a clue
I don't know where she's coming from
Or where she's going to
But if opposites attract
Then I found the perfect woman Jack
I don't understand my girlfriend
She don't understand me, too

Yeah I thought I'd show some class
And order pheasant under glass
Hey how was I suppose to know she was an avid bird watcher

I don't understand my girlfriend
I haven't got a clue
I don't know where she's coming from
Or where she's going to
But if opposites attract
Then I found the perfect woman Jack
I don't understand my girlfriend
She don't understand me too

No she don't understand me too
No she don't understand me too
