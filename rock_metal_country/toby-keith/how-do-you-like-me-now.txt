I was always the crazy one
I broke into the stadium
And I wrote your number on the 50 yard line
You were always the perfect one
And the valadictorian so
Under your number I wrote "call for a good time"

I only wanted to catch your attention
But you overlooked me somehow
Besides you had too many boyfriends to mention
And I played my guitar too loud.

How do you like me now
How do you like me now,
Now that I'm on my way
Do you still think I'm crazy 
Standin here today
I couldnt make you love me
But I always dreamed about living in your radio 
How do you like me now

When I took off to Tennessee 
I heard that you made fun of me
Never imagined I'd make it this far
Then you married into money girl
Aint it a cruel and funny world
He took your dreams and tore them apart.

He never comes home 
And youre always alone
And your kids hear you cryin down the hall
Alarm clock starts ringin
Who could that be singin
Its me baby, with your wake up call!

How do you like me now
How do you like me now,
Now that I'm on my way
Do you still think I'm crazy 
Standin here today
I couldnt make you love me
But I always dreamed about living in your radio 
How do you like me now

Tell me baby...
I will preach on...
