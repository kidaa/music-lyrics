Mother earth has changed since I was a child 
The east is a beast and the west is really wild 
And the headlines say that the end looks grim 
And the future don't look so bright 

You can't even open your mailbox, you can't take a plane 
And everybody's lookin' for somebody to blame 
I think I'm gonna let the president 
Save this ol' world tonight 

I'll light us a fire 
And she'll turn off the news 
We'll open a cold one and shake these blues 

Chorus: It's all good 
It's alright 
I'm gonna sit here with my baby all night 
And let the troubles of this world 
Roll on by us like they should 
It's all cool 
It's OK 
We've got everything going our way 
Can't complain if we're alright 
It's all good 

I'm just a regular Joe, with a beautiful girl 
Just getting by in a day-to-day world 
We ain't got a lot, but we don't need anything 

Covered in kisses, surrounded by love 
Showered with blessings from up above 
When you're sittin' on top of the world, man we got everything 

We live out here in the country 
Where the workin' class do 
We've got our health and our happiness too 

Chorus 
No can't complain 'cause we're alright 
And it's all good
