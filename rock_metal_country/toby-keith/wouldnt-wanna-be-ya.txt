[Chorus]
Hey goodbye senorita, you sure been a friend of mine.
She said well adios amigo.
Some other place, some other time.
Then we drank a shot of tequilla, baby 'till we meet again
She just said I'll see ya, wouldn't wanna be ya.

There ain't no easy way to say it, but it's time for me to fly.
Yeah my truck is packed and runnin', I'm headed out west tonight.
I've stayed longer in Brownsville than I ever thought I would.
I hope I didn't make any promises baby.
You were great, and it was good.

[Chorus]
So goodbye senorita, you sure been a friend of mine.
She said well adios amigo.
Some other place, some other time.
Then we drank a shot of tequilla, baby 'till we meet again
She just said I'll see ya, wouldn't wanna be ya.

I made it out to Tucson where I turned my truck around.
I started barreling down that highway boy, back to that Texas town.
The highway sign said Brownsville 116 miles.
I guess there's a first time for everything, yeah I think I'm gonna stay a while.

[Chorus]
Well hello senortia, I've sure missed a friend of mine.
She said well welcome back amigo, man you sure took your sweet time.
Then we drank a shot of tequilla, she said baby 'till you leave again, it's so good to see ya.
Wouldn't wanna be ya.

It sure is good to see ya.
Wouldn't wanna be ya.
