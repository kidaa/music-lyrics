Everybody knows how much he meant to you, baby 
But you still insist that your heart's alright 
I can see that he's about to get the best of you, maybe 
You're too ashamed to cry and it's gettin' hard to hide 

It's gonna get bad, before it gets better 
You can cry and cry, but he still won't call 
It's gonna get sad, maybe even sadder 
But you're not over the heartache 
You're still under the fall 

When it comes to love, you've always had your way 
And you never had your heart broke, or so you say 
No you can't fool me, I know he's on your mind 
There's things in love that just happen sometime 

It's gonna get bad, before it gets better 
You can cry and cry, but he still won't call 
It's gonna get sad, maybe even sadder 
But you're not over the heartache 
You're still under the fall 

It's gonna get bad, before it gets better 
You can cry and cry, but he still won't call 
It's gonna get sad, maybe even sadder 
But you're not over the heartache 
You're still under the fall
