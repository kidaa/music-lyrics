On a cold night, late December 
As the snow fell to earth 
That's the one night, we remember 
When a woman gave birth 
And for miles and miles around 
The baby's cry was the only sound 

Did He know the world was filled with pain 
Could He feel all the hunger and the shame 
Or did He know about the way He would die 
And the reason why 
Is that what made the baby cry? 
Is that what made the baby cry? 

As his Mother turned to hold Him 
Her face filled with joy 
He grew quiet when She told Him 
He was more than just her baby boy 
And for miles and miles around 
Her lullaby was the only sound 

Did She know the world was filled with pain 
Could She feel all the hunger and the shame 
Or did She know about the way He would die 
And the reason why 
Is that what made Her baby cry? 
Is that what made Her baby cry? 

And as He fell asleep 
She wiped away His tears 
But the question still remains 
Have we changed in two thousand years 

Don't you know the world is still in pain 
Can't you feel all the hunger and the shame 
Did we forget about the way that He died 
And the reason why 
Would we still make the baby cry? 
Would we still make the baby cry?
