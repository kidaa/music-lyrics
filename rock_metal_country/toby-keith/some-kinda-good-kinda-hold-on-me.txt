She's got some kinda good kinda hold on me 
She's some kinda fine sho-nuff sweet 
Wrapped up in her love is I wanna be 
She's got some kinda good kinda hold on me 

I can't get enough of my baby's huggin' and kissin' 
I never knew a girl who could do what she's doing to me 
With just one touch she cast a spell 
I'm tangled up, I can't help myself 

She's got some kinda good kinda hold on me 
She's some kinda fine sho-nuff sweet 
Wrapped up in her love is I wanna be 
She's got some kinda good kinda hold on me 

The boys call me up and want to tell me 
About the fun I've been missing 
They want to know why I let her keep me under 
Lock and key 
But I got what they're looking for 
When she gets me behind close doors 

She's got some kinda good kinda hold on me 
She's some kinda fine sho-nuff sweet 
Wrapped up in her love is I wanna be 
She's got some kinda good kinda hold on me 

She's got some kinda good kinda hold on me 
She's some kinda fine sho-nuff sweet 
Wrapped up in her love is I wanna be 
She's got some kinda good kinda hold on me
