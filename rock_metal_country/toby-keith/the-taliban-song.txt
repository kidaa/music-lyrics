"I'm just a middle-aged, middle-eastern camel herdin' man
I got a little, 2 bedroom cave here in North Afghanistan
Things used to be real nice and they got out of hand when they moved in
They call themselves the Taliban
ooooo yeah the taliban taliban baby

Now I ain't seen my wife's face since they came here
They make her wear a scarf over her head that covers her from ear to ear
She loves the desert and the hot white sand 
But man she's just like me, nah she can't stand 
The Taliban ooo taliban baby

You know someday soon we're both gonna saddle up and it'll be 
Ride Camel Ride
My old lady she'll be here with me, smilin right by my side
We should do just fine out around Palestine or maybe Turkmenistan
We'll bid a fair adieu and flip the finger to the Taliban
oh yeah the taliban baby

I know where you comin from brother!  
This is a patriotic love song 
So y'all feel free to salute if you want, 
You got my permission.

Now they attacked New York City cause they thought they could win
Said they would, stand and fight until the very bloody end
Mr Bush got on the phone with Iraq and Iran and said "Now, you 
sons-of-bitches you better not be doin any business with the taliban"
Taliban baby

So we prayed to Allah with all of our might
Until those big U.S. jets came flyin one night
They dropped little bombs all over their holy land
And man you should have seen em run like rabbits, they ran
the taliban

You know someday soon we're both gonna saddle up and it'll be 
Ride Camel Ride
My old lady she'll be here with me, smilin right by my side
We should do real fine out around Palestine or maybe Turkmenistan
We'll bid a fair adieu and flip a couple fingers to the Taliban
oh yeah, taliban
we'll bid a fair adieu and flip a big boner to The Taliban baby"
