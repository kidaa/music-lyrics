Bad love, she took a good shot
Heartaches, she's had a whole lot of tough breaks
And no one could blame her if she holds out
She's a little worried to jump right in
She ain't in a hurry to try again
She's taking time off from love, but

Every night she cries just a little bit less
And she tries a little bit more
She's got every right to wait until her heart has healed
And when she's ready, I'm here and I'm gonna hold her
Inch by inch she gets a little closer to me, every night

She's mad that she ever loved him
She's through and she's had enough of him, but it's true
He's gonna take some time gettin' over
But I don't mind the waitin' because I know
She's worth the time it's takin', our love will grow
We're makin' it day by day and

Every night she cries just a little bit less
She tries a little bit more
She's got every right to wait until her heart has healed
And when she's ready, I'm here and I'm gonna hold her
Inch by inch she gets a little closer to me, every night

Every night she cries just a little bit less
She tries a little bit more
She's got every right to wait until her heart has healed
And when she's ready, I'm here and I'm gonna hold her
Inch by inch she gets a little closer to me, every night

Every night
She cries just a little, she tries a little bit more
Every night, every night
