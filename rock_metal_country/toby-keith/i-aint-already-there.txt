She called me on the phone and said come on and get on the plane tonight, pronto
So just like every time king sad cried for help
Here come toto
I guess you run a lover off again
And I can't believe how long its been
I had my fingers runnin through her hair
Only bad thing about it
I ain't already there

Baby I just landed grabbed my bag and hopped a cab
And I'm comin solo
Light a candle, fill the tub, and put on some music that you love
And I'll bring the mojo
Yeah the cabby said he'd drive like heck
If you'd promise me a pony tail
And my favorite secret underwear
Only bad thing about it
I ain't already there

Now its been real and its been fun
Another notch carved in her gun

You know a funny thing when you play her game
What you thought would change just stays the same.

I'll be on this plane to Illinois
She be locked down with some pretty boy
When we touch down in Chicago at o'hare 
Only bad thing about it
I ain't already there
Oh no
