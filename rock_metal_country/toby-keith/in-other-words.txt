You've got my heart in unfamiliar territory 
It's never been out here on my sleeve 
But here tonight with you it's quite a different story 
You bring out a side of me no one has ever seen 

There's something I'm afraid to say to you too early 
But I'd be a fool to wait too late 
My mind is cautious but my heart is in a hurry 
Which one's right, it's really hard to say 

In other words 
I can't put "I love you" in other words 
When I look into your eyes 
No other words can capture what I'm feeling 
My heart tells my head some things can't be said 
In other words 
Better men than I have tried to find a better phrase 
Still "I love you" has a ring I've never heard 
In other words 

What we've got here is a touching situation 
You smile as if you've read my mind 
A pair of "I love you's" gently ends this conversation 
'Cause matters of the heart can't be defined 

In other words 
I can't put "I love you" in other words 
When I look into your eyes 
No other words can capture what I'm feeling 
My heart tells my head some things can't be said 
In other words 
Better men than I have tried to find a better phrase 
Still "I love you" has a ring I've never heard 
In other words
