American Girls and American Guys 
We'll always stand up and salute 
We'll always recognize 
When we see Old Glory Flying 
There's a lot of men dead 
So we can sleep in peace at night 
When we lay down our head 

My daddy served in the army 
Where he lost his right eye 
But he flew a flag out in our yard 
Until the day that he died 
He wanted my mother, my brother, my sister and me 
To grow up and live happy 
In the land of the free. 

Now this nation that I love 
Has fallen under attack 
A mighty sucker punch came flyin' in 
From somewhere in the back 
Soon as we could see clearly 
Through our big black eye 
Man, we lit up your world 
Like the 4th of July 

Hey Uncle Sam 
Put your name at the top of his list 
And the Statue of Liberty 
Started shakin' her fist 
And the eagle will fly 
Man, it's gonna be hell 
When you hear Mother Freedom 
Start ringin' her bell 
And it feels like the whole wide world is raining down on you 
Brought to you Courtesy of the Red White and Blue 

Justice will be served 
And the battle will rage 
This big dog will fight 
When you rattle his cage 
And you'll be sorry that you messed with 
The U.S. of A. 
'Cause we'll put a boot in your ass 
It's the American way 

Hey Uncle Sam 
Put your name at the top of his list 
And the Statue of Liberty 
Started shakin' her fist 
And the eagle will fly 
Man, it's gonna be hell 
When you hear Mother Freedom 
Start ringin' her bell 
And it feels like the whole wide world is raining down on you 
Brought to you Courtesy of the Red White and Blue
