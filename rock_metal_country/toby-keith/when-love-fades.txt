Going through the motions pretending to be
The man you used to see in me baby
You don't want to hurt me so you play along
And it don't feel right, and it don't feel wrong
It just feels like a memory
Barely alive
When will we let it die

Where do you run
Where do you hide
After a prmise breaks
Who'll be the one
To say goodbye
And who'll be the one to stay
When love fades

How are we gonna let go of something that's gone
Ain't it funny how a broken heart just keeps hangin' on baby
You watched me walk away
And I set you free
But I come back to you and you come back to me
I guess it beats being lonely that's the reason why
We give it one more try

Where do you run
Where do you hide
After a promise breaks
Who'll be the one
To say goodbye
And who'll be the one to stay
When love fades
When love fades

Where do you run
Where do you hide
After a promise breaks
Who'll be the one
To say goodbye
And who'll be the one to stay
When love fades
When love fades
