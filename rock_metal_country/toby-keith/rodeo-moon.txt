I took her daddy's old two-horse trailer 
I patched a place in the floor that was bare 
And we loaded up her barrel pony 
And a riggin' bag is all that I had 
Left with our suitcases filled with desire 
Four hundred dollars, two good spare tires 

Chorus: 
Now our windshield's a painting that hangs in our room 
Changes with each mile like a radio tune 
We got up above, we'll make it on love 
Under the rodeo moon 

Sometimes we sleep in a hotel 
When we're ridin' that hot hand of luck 
Sometimes we crash at a friend's house 
Sometimes we just sleep in the truck 
At nighttime you'll find us out in the fast lane 
Stayin' one step ahead of snow, wind, and rain 

Chorus 
Yeah we left with our suitcases filled with desire 
Four hundred dollars, two good spare tires 

Chorus
