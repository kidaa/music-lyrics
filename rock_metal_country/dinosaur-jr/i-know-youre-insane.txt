Every see to came
I use such restraint
What's left around me
is there to me
Cant walk with you
this is overdue
And it spills from inside
into and all over you
Come on out
Feel the pictures 
As they warn you
Bottom out, it's good for you
It can be real
Nothing like a picture of you
Can not follow you along
So you have a ways to grow
Can not follow you alone
Dreams are not themselves
Dreamnt withotu living it
It's hard to tell
When the day begins
It's the evil twin
Let it out
???
All the doubt has been good to me
You can't be this
Nothing like I picture it
Giving me a chill
