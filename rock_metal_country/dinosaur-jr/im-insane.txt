If I ran away today
Will you pull me back tomorrow?
Took some time to arrange
With trust, space will follow
Out to find the things you need
Your connections hard to swallow
Still things you tell me when
Your eyes track me down, keepin' you hollow
Throat starts to drain
I've done it way too many times to go away
Gone in a state, by my water
Can you bring it back to me
Will you follow?
And how'd you get away
If I ran away today
Will you pull me back tomorrow?
Took some time to arrange
Your connections hard to swallow
I know you're somewhere, I'm Insane
It's your needs on my brain
Smack me out, Our eyes exchange
To have the strength to stake my claim
Have you placed it?
I can't taste it
Will I waste it?
Can't trace it
Time to face it
Now gonna go away
I know you're somewhere, I'm Insane
It's your needs on my brain
Smack me out, Move on with change
To have the strength to stake my claim
I know you're somewhere, I'm Insane
To have the strength to stake my claim
I know you're somewhere, I'm Insane
To have the strength to stake my claim
