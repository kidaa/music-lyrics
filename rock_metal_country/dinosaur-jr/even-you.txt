A time was when it seemed appropriate to walk away And now you got to try to stay They all asked me, then you asked me I was kind of stunned Now it's me who wants to run I've no right falling all around you Suffocating bugs surround you It's a shame that's what it's done to you It came so easily, I let it follow me right down Crept in close without a sound They all told me, then you told me but I stayed around Then it hit, I hit the ground No discussion could improve this Next time gonna have to lose this No way in I'm gonna hate it I'll try not to overstate it When I finally plan my trip I know you're gonna be there When it's time I finally flip I know you're gonna be there [Solo] 
It seemed immediate You stuck me and you walked away It upsets me either way I do anything if anything won't come too late Not the best way to set things straight No discussion could improve this Gonna be a pain to lose this Even you could not excuse this
