I looked all around
Opem my eyes I found
You crying, crying on the ground
If I told you then
Now, were you listening?
Now just tell me where, can't pretend
Slippin' through my mind
Letting go this time
Will I find you?
It's a special place
It's been hard to taste
If you let me, it won't go to waste
If I let you go, will I ever know
Cause I gotta know, gotta know
You've been through my mind
Letting go this time
Need to find
When I helped you close
Felt my mind explode
At that point, that point my whole life froze
Can't go back from here
Feelings far from fear
It's over, take my hand, we'll disappear
I looked all around
Open my eyes I found
You crying, crying on the ground
If I told you then
Were you listening?
Now just tell me where, I can't pretend
It's a special place
It's been hard to taste
If you met me, It won't go to waste
If I let you go, will I ever know?
Cause I gotta know, gotta know
We've been through my mind
Not letting go this time
Still not fine
