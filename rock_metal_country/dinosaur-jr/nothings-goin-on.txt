Every's girl's a suspect
Every's boy's your friend
Livin in the dark [?], think again
Tales are often spun here
It's a busy place
Mind is not the only thing you waste
I can't help you if you walk away
Every dream is someone you replace
Got a knack for being wrong
Nothin's really goin on
I know you don't buy it
Nothin's really goin on
Dropped you off in sections
Then you spoke my mind
Don't you let me ever slip behind
No, I can't help you if you walk away
Got some moves, that you gotta play
[solo]
You got a knack for being wrong
Nothin's really goin on
I know you don't buy it
Nothin's really goin on
You've been rockin on your own
Nothin's really goin on
How much must I deny it?
Nothin's really goin on
Every angel's a suspect
Every creep's your friend
When I've gone away, get back again
I won't help you if you walk away
Nothing happening, nothin more to say
