I'd like to come and see you But what's it worth to know? Promise you'll make it easy You won't get me to go I've been a wreck so long it's hard to pull it back, but I'm on it, and I want it, and you flaunt it...and it wakes me, and it takes me, and it rapes me Gone away. On the way I want to let you go I got a little red Just can't pull it together Before it goes to your head Gone away. On the way On the way On the way [Solo] I'd like to come and see you But I think I'm on my way Gone away Gone away On the way On the way On the way Gone away I've been a wreck so long, it's hard to pull it out Look to me, I feel the fool again.
