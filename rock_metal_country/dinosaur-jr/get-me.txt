I don't see you, I won't call you I don't know enough to stall you Is it me, or is it all you? Guess, it's on and on On a day, maybe I'd show you But it's the least of all I go through But the thing is I don't know you And it's on and on Trembling words Don't make my eyes close And if anyone then you'd know I can't find out 'cause it won't show And it's on and on Every dream is shot by daylight And I pray that maybe you're right But if you don't, maybe I might 'Cause it's on and on When it takes too long I lose it I'll just hang while you abuse it 
If you knew then why'd you choose it 'Cause it's on and on You're not gonna get me through this are you You're not gonna get me through this are you Anytime I'm there to show you But if it takes too long I know you Out the door just leavin' me screwed And it's on and on Everytime I try to fight it It's so hard to seem excited And if you don't turn I'll bite it And it's on and on You're not gonna get me through this are you You're not gonna get me through this are you [Solo] I don't see you, I won't call you I don't know enough to stall you Is it me, or is it all you? Yes, it's on and on Every dream is shot by daylight And I pray maybe that you're right But if you don't maybe I might Cause it's on and on [Solo]
