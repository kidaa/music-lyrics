I wonder how you're feeling 
There's ringing in my ear 
And no one to relate to except the sea 
Who can I believe in? 
I'm kneeling on the floor 
There has to be a force. Who do I phone? 
The stars are out and shining. But all I really want to know 
Oh won't you show me the way 
I want you show me the way 
Well, I can see no reason 
You're living on your nerves 
When someone drops a cup and I submerge 
I'm swimming in a circle I feel I'm going down 
There has to be a fool to play my part 
Someone thought of healing but all I really want to know 
Oh won't you show me the way 
I want you show me the way 
I want you show me the way 
I want you day after day 
I wonder if I'm dreaming 
I feel so unashamed 
I can't believe this is happening to me. 
I watch you when you're sleeping 
And I wanna slap your face 
Oh won't you show me the way 
I want you show me the way 
I want you show me the way 
I want you day after day
