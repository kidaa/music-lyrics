Help me off your back I found it's so futile to attack So what else you got You won't tell the truth until you're caught I'll be in your room You'll be comin' soon I'll be gone all day Grab it, that's your way I wish I could pretend But you'll fire one off at me again Revenge me Now don't it seem like you're a little sweet In your room 
Who was willing Got to assume Felt too hard Pain is chilling Caught off guard And now should I fall apart I'll be in your room You'll be comin' soon Take it out of me Grab it, that's your scene I'm not feeling well It's not goin' so good, oh can't you tell It's a crazy time Fire one off at me and I'll be fine In your room Who was willing Got to assume Felt too hard Pain is chilling Caught off guard Soon should I fall apart It's so crazed You were swingin' Still amazed What's in your laugh ? You're still swingin' You're so unphased I'd no idea you'd go this far [Solo] If I look back, would you hear If that's what you decide to believe
