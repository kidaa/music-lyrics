Embarrassed to be alive 
Sit with my life, open wide 
Your stare is forcing my face open 
A leper crumbling, never joking 
Who should I believe 
Safest to wallow in my own esteem 
Afraid, stick my neck out 
Knowing the day has drawn 
I'm a leper 
Scared beyond this feeling 
I dare to escape 
A leper 
Doomed to this 
My life is chosen to rape 
Embarrassed to be alive 
Sit with my life open wide 
Your stare is forcing my face open 
A leper crumbling never joking 
I'm a leper 
Scared beyond this feeling 
I dare to escape 
A leper 
Doomed to this 
My life is chosen to rape 
[Listen to this solo!] 
I'm a leper 
Leper 
Leper
