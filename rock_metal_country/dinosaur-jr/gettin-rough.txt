I know you're waiting
I'm through relating
I've had enough
I'm sick of reading
My interest fading
It's looking up
I know I've been that way too long
Between our own useless
Tide it over
It's getting slower
Time for a change
Falls the prison
Don't wanna live in
Expand my range
I know I've been that way too long
I know it's useless
The charm is gone
Time to move on
I'm ready now
The questions, how?
I'll keep on pushin'
Throw out the cushion
I need to do this
Beyond the darkness
There must be one kiss
So give me hope
I know I've been that way too long
