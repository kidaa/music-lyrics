You
You make me hot
Make my body feel delirious

Please
Don't ever stop
Listen when I feel serious

Cause you and I
Were made for each other
Heaven that is hard to break

CHORUS:
Don't you want my love
Don't you need my body
Don't you want my love
Won't you take my heart
When do we get started
When you want my love

Hot
Is how I feel
When you bring your body next to mine

Heat
It feel so real
Sweat runs down my body all the time

You and I
One night together
A memory you'll never regret

Don't you want my love
Don't you need my body
Don't you want my love
Won't you take my heart
When do we get started
When you want my love

BRIDGE: x 4
Dont you want
Dont you want my love

Don't you want my love
Don't you need my body
Don't you want my love
Won't you take my heart
When do we get started
When you want my love

Don't you want my love
Don't you need my body
Don't you want my love
Won't you take my heart
When do we get started
When you want my love

Don't you want my love
Don't you need my body
Don't you want my love
Won't you take my heart
When do we get started
When you want my love

Don't you want my love
Don't you need my body
Don't you want my love
Won't you take my heart
When do we get started
When you want my love
