Every night, it's another girl
I obsess about my finest dream
But I need to feel today, why am I driving you away?
Sure not over you
So you sit, that's a way to be
You don't have to bottom all along
But there's things you need to be
It all cant come from me
Every night we're drifitng farther
All the love and life is gotta count for something
Gotta all pull it togther
Don't wanna blow it together
Sit up and feel strange
Solitify a change
Sure not over you
Piece together, how we've come along
Float [flowed?] so easily before
So it's me that's flakin out
Wish I knew what that's about
Sure not over you
Sure not over you
Every night we're drifitng farther
Vibes so bad I wanna puke
All the love in life has gotta count for somethimg right
Gotta all pull it together
Don't wanna blow it now
Sit up and feel strange
Solitify the strange
And it's me that's flaking out
Wish I knew what that's about
There's so much I need to be
And it's gotta come from [comfort?] me
Sure not over you
Sure not over you
