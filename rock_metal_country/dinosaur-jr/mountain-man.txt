Mining for a sacred lode 
Drilling into untouched stone 
The world has done enough to me 
The horror now I'll never see 
Got to fight off grizzly bears 
Got to eat, so I grab a few hares 
Got to struggle to survive 
That's the reason I'm alive 
I know I left you hurting 
Disappeared with no goodbyes 
But I heard the snowcats calling 
I'm alright, baby please don't cry 
If the guy is right for you 
he doesn't live on bear cat stew 
I'll live without you alright 
I figured you was not sleeping at night 
Got to fight off grizzly bears 
Got to eat, so I grab a few hares 
Got to struggle to survive 
That's the reason I'm alive 
The animals were my first real friends 
They'll protect me 'til the end 
Where the people lived was filled of lies 
And the truth has no disguise 
I know I left you hurting 
Disappeared with no goodbyes 
But I heard the snowcats calling 
I'm alright, baby please don't cry 
If the guy is right for you 
he doesn't live on bear cat stew 
I'll live without you alright 
I figured you was not sleeping at night 
I'm a mountain man 
Rip that fucker right off, I feel fine 
This is a mountain man 
'Cause I'm a mountain man
