Hey what's bubbling down under there? Why's it screaming?, what's unfair? Please excuse it for getting hard Let the shellfish? swell inside But how should I now watch it squirm? It's asking me what's that I learn Stay inside, pull me out of space Trip me sprinkling grey Stay and take my fate Thought I knew you, stuck out my hand The bit which I could understand It's a twisted feeling, staring bored It's time to burn, I hope I score Wait for me there, the gas might run Strike this little, be outdone Stay inside, pull me out of space Trip me sprinkling grey Stay and take my fate Take my fate Take my fate Take my fate And take my fate
