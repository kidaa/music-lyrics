See the sun at 7, she is  about you
On my way to heaven. Walking down the same old place
See the sun at 7, she is  about you
On my way to heaven, to heaven

See the sun at 7, she is  about you
On my way to heaven. Walking down the same old place
See the sun at 7, she is  about you
On my way to heaven, to heaven

See the sun at 7, she is  about you
On my way to heaven. Walking down the same old place
See the sun at 7, she is  about you
On my way to heaven, to heaven
