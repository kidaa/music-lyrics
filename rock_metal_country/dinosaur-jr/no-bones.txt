Hey babe, thought maybe Can't feel, not today Wish it didn't faze me Can't handle either way With life surrounded Entombed in war Don't lie to her, no bones, no bones The vast expanses, it can't be too grand To go together outside Hey babe, can't do it Can't put you there again Can't feel, can't go through it If there only was a way If there only was a way [Solo] With life surrounded Entombed in war Don't lie to her, no bones, no bones The vast expanses, it can't be too grand Or I'll send them back
