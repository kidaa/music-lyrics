It's been runnin' for a long time And it's runnin' out in my mind I can't explain it all to you It's really jumbled up So for longer now I'm messed up And I'm wishin' now I'd 'fessed up That concern's no use to you It feeds the pain that stung So forget how I am dealin' Explain to me the feelin' It gets to that point instantly You're ready to unload And I'm the one you're spitting at I'm ready for my fitting at Doesn't make much sense But when I get it calm it's slow [Solo] 
It's hard to admit anything I'm sorry for the weight I bring I'll do whatever's necessary To make your mind glow soft It's played out too far to stew And I've run out of grace with you So I'm out and take a walk And we'll be better off Whether I lied As much as you tried Whatever you decide I hope it's good to you For everybody's sake Lord knows we all need a break Do what you got to This is hard to take To the time I spent discussin' I'll sit back and stop the fussin' I won't mention it to anyone And we'll be better off I won't admit to anything Sorry for the weight I bring Do whatever's necessary To make your mind glow soft Whether I lied As much as you tried Whatever you decide I hope it's good to you For everybody's sake Lord knows we all need a break Do what you got to This is hard to take
