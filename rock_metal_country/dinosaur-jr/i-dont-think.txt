Come on it's over now, run for you
I give the last of me
To catch a glimpse it's true
Are you water?
Is when you call me
I can't decide if you
Grasp the concept
Cuz I lost it
Still, I hope it's true for you
I don't talk when you're around it
I don't blame enough to ask the questions
I don't know different if you doubt it
There's not much to think or say ???????
Too late, wish I could wait
Still nothing's understood
Inside, so much to hide
When will you let it through?
Are you water?
Is when you call me
I can't decide if you
Grasp the concept
Cuz I lost it
I hope it's true for you
I don't mind if you think about it
I don't talk to too much ????????????????
Know enough just not to doubt it
Are you waiting?
Just the same-old?
Everything I know
I don't wanna think about it
Know enough just not to doubt the thing and let it come to you
F--- WHAT?
