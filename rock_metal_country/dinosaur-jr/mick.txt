When you find a girl
You found a friend
If you wait too long
The story ends
If I look to you, you wave to me
I can't take it, honestly
But I found you, and there you are
If the tides have turned
And wash ashore
But you gave me pain [this?]
I still adore
Now I ran them all, around for you
Can't believe that's all you do
And it kills me, and there you are
I can't take myself
I'm trying to help somebody else
Come along [on?]
Let's just get it straight
This is gonna have to wait
Too long
Make me strong
Hand it along
I don't have too long
If I found the truth
You would lie
Cause the place I move
Is on the side
And I wish for all these things for you
Keep it special, make it true
Cause I found you, and there you are
I can't take myself
I'm trying to help somebody else
Come along [on?]
I can't get it straight
This is gonna have to wait
Too long
Spread upon the seas
?????????????????????
I'm stuck
I can't take myself
I still need a lot of help
And love....
