I wanna help you 
I sense you're riding pretty low 
I got the feeling 
When your hair hits the ceiling 
Something, babe 
You oughta know 
I won't cry if you walk by 
But if we both kind of stumble 
Maybe I'll say hi 
That's my best 
I never try that much 
'Cause I'm scared of feeling 
That appealing touch 
You gotta get through 
My maze and pass every test 
'Cause I'm choosin' one love 
Tattooed across my chest 
Know the time has come 
I ain't gonna fester no more 
Let the world be free 
Of my disease 
I never knew a rubber doll 
Would be so hard to please 
Now I'm preachin' out 
One last burst before I retract 
No one will know 
'Til I finally let go 
Of the one thing 
I ain't never going to give back 
I want to help you 
Baby can't you see 
You're better than my pillow 
'Cause you don't stain so easily 
You know it's hard 
Just to finally let go 
And leave all the pictures behind 
Hope I brought you some happiness 
I believe I just had to get on 
'Cause just wasn't a world 
I wished to need to find
