I know why you came here
I know it's the same fear
It seems loaded
It seems true, true [through me?]
Got no hand what can I do
I've been strumming [struggling?]
You've been blew [blue?] through
I don't get what you need to do
I know why you came here
Please don't be ashamed of you [here?]
And should I lay a claim here
I know it's the same fear
[solo over vocals]
I put me out here
I move through too
Will I get the same from you?
I know why you came here
Please don't be ashamed here
I know it's the same sheer [fear?]
Should I lay a claim here?
