Freak Scene 
Seen enough to eye you 
But I've seen to much to try you 
It's always weirdness while you 
Dig it much too much to fry you 
The weirdness flows between us 
Anyone can tell to see us 
Freak scene just can't believe us 
Why can't it just be cool and free us? 
Seen enough to eye you 
But I've seen to much to try you 
It's always weirdness while you 
Dig it much too much to fry you 
The weirdness flows between us 
Anyone can tell to see us 
Freak scene just can't believe us 
Why can't it just be cool and leave us? 
It's so fucked I can't believe it 
If there's a way I wish we'd see it 
How could it work just can't conceive it 
Oh what a mess it's just to leave it 
Sometimes I don't thrill you 
Sometimes I think I'll kill you 
Just don't let me fuck up will you 
'Cause when I need a friend it's still you 
What A Mess
