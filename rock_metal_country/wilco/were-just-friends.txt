Over and over and over again
I say that were just friends

Forget the implications
Infatuations end
If loves so easy, why is it hard
I can't imagine ever being apart
I'll come back to you
Itd be brand new
But I promise
We're just friends

Over and over and over again
I try to make amends
For everything Ive done wrong
My whole world just spins
Make some coffee, hold me up
Try to talk me out of giving up
I'll come back to you
It'll be brand new
But I promise
We're just friends
