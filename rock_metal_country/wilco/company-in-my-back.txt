I attack with love, pure bug beauty 
I curl my lips and crawl up to you 
I attack with love, pure bug beauty 
I curl my lips and crawl up to you 

And your afternoon 
And I've been puking 

I move so slow, a steady crushing hand 
Holy shit there's a company in my back 
I move so slow, a steady crushing hand 
Holy shit there's a company in my back 

Hide your soft skin, your sorrow is sunshine 
Listen to my eyes 
Hide your soft skin, your sorrow is sunshine 
Listen to my eyes 

They are hissing radiator tunes 
I move so slow, a steady crushing hand 
Holy shit there's a company in my back 
I move so slow, a steady crushing hand 
Holy shit there's a company in my back 

You learn so slow, old radiant beauty 
I'll curve my flight 
You learn so slow, old radiant beauty 
I'll curve my flight 

Under your bended knee 
And I will always die 
I will always die 
I will always die 
So you can remember me 

I move so slow, a steady crushing hand 
Holy shit there's a company in my back 
I move so slow, a steady crushing hand 
Holy shit, there's a company in my back 

There's a company in my back
