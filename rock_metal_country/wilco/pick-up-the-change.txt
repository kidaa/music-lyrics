If it's just your heart talking, I don't mind
If you wanna call me, darling that's just fine, that's just fine
But if it's your mind that's wandering, it'll fall in line
When I kiss your cheek, dear, everytime, everytime

We used to have a lotta things in common,
But you know now we're just the same
You always had more than I really wanted
Aw honey, help me,
Aw honey, help me pick up the change

If it's just your heart talking, I'll listen everytime
Dear, you can talk my ear off, anytime, anytime
But if my mind starts wandering, it won't be gone long
Whenever I hear your heart talking, it's a song, it's a song

We used to have a lotta things in common,
But you know now we're just the same
You always had more than I really wanted
Aw honey, help me,
Come on honey, help me pick up,
Aw honey, help me pick up the change

Aw honey, help me,
Come on honey, help me pick up,
Aw honey, help me pick up the change
