Hotel in Arizona made us all wanna feel like stars
Rental cars and tinted windows, leave another number for me
Even if I make it through
That's just something that I have to get used to
That's just something I have to get used to
I feel some connection between you and me
Well I guess there's some direction maybe you can't see
Even at the interview, that's not something thatI'm gonna get used to
That's not something I'm gonna get used to
Hello, can you hear?
Hello, that's all there is, that's all there is
I guess all this history is just a mystery to me
One more worried whisper right in my ear
