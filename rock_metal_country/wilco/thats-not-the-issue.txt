You've got a problem, I think you know
I'll tell you mine before you go
You've been thinking about somebody new
That's not the issue

Secrets, I have some too
I'll tell you mine before I say goodbye to you
I've been thinking 'bout leaving too
That's not the issue

I'm leaving, I'm leaving now
I'd say goodbye, but I don't know how
You've been sleeping with somebody new
That's not the issue
