How can I convince you it's me I don't like
When I've always been distant
and I've always told lies for love

I'm bound by these choices so hard to make
I'm bound by the feeling so easy to fake
None of this is real enough to take me from you

Oh I've got reservations
about so many things
but not about you

I know this isn't what you were wanting me to say
How can I get closer and be further away
From the truth that proves it's beautiful to lie

I've got reservations
about so many things
but not about you
I've reservations
about so many things
but not about you
not about you
not about you
not about you
it's not about you
