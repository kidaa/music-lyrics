Got a box full of letters,
Think you might like to read
Some things that you might like to see, 
But they're all addressed to me

Wish I had a lotta answers,
'Cause that's the way it should be
For all these questions,
Being directed at me

I just can't find the time 
To write my mind
The way I want it to read

You'll come back again
And I'll still be your friend

I got a lot of your records,
In a separate stack
Some things that I might like to hear,
But I guess I'll give 'em back

I wish I had a lotta answers,
'Cause that's the way it should be
All these questions
Being directed at me

Just can't find the time 
To write my mind 
The way I want it to read 

You'll come back again,
And I'll still be your friend 

I can't find the time 
To write my mind 
The way I want it to read 

Just can't find the time 
To write my mind 
The way I want it to read
