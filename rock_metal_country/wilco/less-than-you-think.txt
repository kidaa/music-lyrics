Your mind's a machine 
It's deadly and dull 
It's never been still and its will 
Has never been free 

Lightly tapping 
A high-pitched drum 

As your spine starts to shine 
You shiver at your soul 
A fist so clear and climbing 
Punches a hole 
In the sky 
So you can see 
For yourself 
If you don't believe me 

There's so much less 
To this than you think 

It's almost gone 
The night is dissolving 
In a cup God lifts 
To toast the lightning 

Lightly tapping 
It's high-pitched and it hums 

Your spine starts to shine 
And you shiver at your soul 
A fist so clear and climbing 
Punches a hole 
In the sky 
So you can see 
For yourself 
If you don't believe me 

There's so much less 
To this than you think
