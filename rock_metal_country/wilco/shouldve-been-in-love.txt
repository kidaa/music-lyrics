You been dealing with all of these feelings
Like they got you believing they have no meaning,
But they do

Your life's been stinking, your heart's been sinking,
And you're too busy thinking to stop
You blink and you're blue

Should've been in love
Should've been in love

Your mind's been racing, your heart's been chasing,
And you might as well face it, time's wasting,
It's true

Your life's been stinking, your heart's been shrinking,
And you're too busy thinking to stop
You blink and you're blue

Should've been in love
Should've been in love

I know how it goes, 
So I just had to let you know I know

My life's been stinking, my heart's been shrinking,
And I'm too busy thinking to stop
I blink and you're gone

Should've been in love
We should've been in love
We should've been in love
