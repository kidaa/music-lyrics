There's a whole lot of money that you gave me
I'd gladly empty my pockets right now
You'd parlay all that by triple
It's just that simple

Those days I'd gladly walk so long for you,
Although it seemed I crawled most of the way
After some time I felt like a cripple
It's just that simple

Last week I was thinking about traveling by land,
And the time you remember we were by the lake
It wasn't even like we made a ripple
It's just that simple
In my head, the time didn't make a ripple
It's just that simple
