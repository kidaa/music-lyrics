Well there's a dreamer in my dreams,
Swing from the beams,
With a light shining off the snow.
Well there's a singer in my heart,
Burning up the charts,
With songs about things we all know.
Well there's a blister on his brain,
That's driving him insane,
Cause all good things they gotta go.
Well there's a child on the way,
It could be any day,
But how this life will change him, that we don't know.
Well there's a child on the way,
One day, he's gonna say, "Ain't you my dad?"
Then he's gonna look down and smile,
and after awhile,
He'll say, "That's for sure son, cause you got my eyes."
Well there's a dreamer in my dreams,
He's hanging from the beams,
With light shining off the snow.
Well there's a blister on his brain,
It's driving him insane,
And all good things have to go, all right.
There's a dreamer in my dreams, 
Swinging from the beams,
With a light shining off the lake.
Well, I know I made mistakes,
I'm passing then all on.
But I hope he gets some before there gone, all right.
Yeah, that's it.
Well there's a dreamer in my dreams,
Climbing up the back,
Of a car they used to call a Cadillac.
It's got a brand new set of keys,
It's got a new look, it's got a new look,
And his young one is gonna take it all away.
I believe it...
Well there's a dreamer in my dreams,
Swinging from the beams,
All wrapped up in my garage.
He's hanging from a bell,
He don't know what he's done,
Just don't forget to day goodbye when he's gone.
That's it.
