To live without a savior, answer to his name,
Shouldn't be afraid, shouldn't be ashamed
Like a kid behind the counter remembering your name,
Shouldn't be afraid, shouldn't be ashamed

If it's not like I told you, then it's still your call
You should live how you want, stay with me, we should stay apart
Just shouldn't ever have to be this hard

Like a man on the sidewalk remembering your face,
Shouldn't look away, shouldn't be afraid
He remembers when they still wore gaiters, World War One
Shouldn't be afraid, shouldn't be ashamed

If it's not like I told you, then it's still your call
You should live how you want, stay with me, we should stay apart
Just shouldn't ever have to be this hard
