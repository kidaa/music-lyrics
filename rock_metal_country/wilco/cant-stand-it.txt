The way things go
You get so low
Struggle to find your skin
Hey ho
Look out below
Your prayers will never be answered again

Phones still ring
And singers sing
Speakers are speaking in code
What now
Well anyhow
Our prayers will never be answered again

You know it's all beginning
It's all beginning
To feel like It's ending
Feels like It's ending
No loves as random
As God's love
I can't stand it
I can't stand it

The way things get
You get so high
Funny how we make new friends
Oh hey ho
I gotta go
My prayers will never be answered again

You know It's all beginning
it's all beginning
To feel like It's ending
Feels like It's ending
No loves as random
As God's love
I can't stand it
I can't stand it

Speakers speaking
Speakers speaking
Speaking in code

Speakers speaking
Speakers speaking
Speaking in code

You know It's all beginning
it's all beginning
To feel like pretending
To feel like pretending
No loves as random
As my love
I can't stand it
I can't stand it

Your prayers will never be answered again
Your prayers will never be answered again
Your prayers will never be answered again
Your prayers will never be answered again
