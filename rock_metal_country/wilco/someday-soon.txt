Wind will blow and the sun will shine.
On that hill where we used to climb.
I look in your eyes and you'll be mine.
Someday soon.
I won't even make a scene.
It will be just like a dream.
Cash is gonna flow down by the old mainstream.
Someday soon.
You don't know me, but I know you you don't know me.
You have no idea what I do what I do.
Make you mine and see you swoon.
Someday soon.
Sun's gonna shine, wind's gonna blow.
On the hill where we used to go.
I look in your eyes and down I will roll.
Someday soon.
Someday, someday soon.
Someday, someday soon.
