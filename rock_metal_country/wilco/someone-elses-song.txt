I can't tell you anything you don't already know.
I keep on trying, I should just let it go.
I keep on singing, you're eyes they just roll.
It sounds like someone else's song from along time ago.
You already know the story and the chords are just the same.
You already know I love you, and I sound like whats-his-name.
But you can't stop me, I want you to know.
I know it sounds like someone else's song from along time ago.
