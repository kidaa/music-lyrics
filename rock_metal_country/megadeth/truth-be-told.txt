This is the first tale of death in the world
When Cain struck down Abel, a family broken
Since then mankind's dominated his own kind
To insult and injure, there's no such thing as peace
Till dead do us part, till the last

Truth be told - sin lies at the doorway
Truth be told - hells open for business now
Truth be told - the soil cries out for revenge
Truth be told - and death is upon the ground
All around

The battle aint over without spoils of war
Just cause it is written doesn't make it so
When you dance with the devil wait till the songs over
I ask myself, "How bad do I want you to live?"
My anger is near, till the last

Truth be told - sin lies at the doorway
Truth be told - hells open for business now
Truth be told - the soil cries out for revenge
Truth be told - and death is upon the ground
All around

Tribulation strikes and we're hit hard
Still you just go on your way
Head in the sand, ignoring the rain
Just like the flood in Noah's day
In his day
[Solo - Mustaine]

Can't punish those for ruining the earth
Its suicide to some degree
Because we are all guilty, guilty as sin
There will be no peace, never for you and me
[Solo - Mustaine]

Before al qaeda and bin ladin
Long before hitler and hussein
Ever since the first murder was commited
The verdicts always been the same
Been the same, wrong!
[Solo - Mustaine]

The cursed future just repeats the past
There's hell to pay and stones to cast
So, there will be no peace, never peace
Till the last truth be told by you and me
[Solo - Mustaine]
