I'm running in quicksand
something's haunting me
the guilty past I've buried
my mind won't let me sleep

I'll do anything for peace - I keep waking up
a solemn oath I make
cross my heart please let me sleep - I keep waking up
how much more do I take

My head is talking to me
I don't know what it needs
but the loudest voice
is the one I heed

Insomnia, my swollen bloodshot eyes
Insomnia, awake till morning light
Insomnia, stirring deep inside
Insomnia, somebody turn out the lights
I can't sleep - insomnia

I'm twisting and turning - I keep waking up
the madness I must tame
my candle is burning - I keep waking up
both ends again today

The whole house is creaking
I know they're out there
the things kept from sight
I beg to the shadows
I can't sleep

Insomnia, footsteps on the walk
Insomnia, I hear someone knock
Insomnia, I wish it was a dream
Insomnia, can you hear me scream
