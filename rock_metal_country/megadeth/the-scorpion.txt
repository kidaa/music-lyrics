My life is everything
That feeds my thirst that causes sin
My wants are all I care
No shame and guilt, there's nothing there
Look deep into my face
I sell deceit without a trace
Fear not what I can do
Unless you want it done to you, oh-ohhh!
[Solo - Mustaine]

As I climb onto your back, I will promise not to sting
I will tell you what you want to hear and not mean anything
Then I treat you like a dog as I shoot my venom in
You pretend you didn't know that I am a scorpion, oh

My self I'm centred in
There's nothing else, there's never been
And I dream, to be left alone
With the sadness, the madness of my own
Look deep into my soul
Its black as coal like a bullet hole
Fear not, get off your knees
There's no defence you'll do what I please, oh-oh!
[Solo - Mustaine]

as I climb onto your back, I will promise not to sting
I will tell you what you want to hear and not mean anything
Then I treat you like a dog as I shoot my venom in
You pretend you didn't know that I am a scorpion, oh
[Solo - Mustaine]

as I climb onto your back, I will promise not to sting
I will tell you what you want to hear and not mean anything
Then I treat you like a dog as I shoot my venom in
You pretend you didn't know that I am a scorpion, ya!

My lies, to reach the shore
I aggrandise and nothing more
My hopes, to steal away
All that you love, I'll soon betray
Look deep into my past
The pain is unsurpassed
I'm not a lowly scorpion
I'm so much worse; I'm the fall of man
