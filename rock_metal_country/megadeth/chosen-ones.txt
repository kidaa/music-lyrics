[D. MUSTAINE]

YOU DOUBT YOUR STRENGTH OR COURAGE
DON'T COME TO JOIN WITH ME
FOR DETH SURELY WAITS YOU
WITH SHARP AND POINTY TEETH
AN ANIMAL SO VICIOUS
NO OTHERS FOUGHT AND WON
SO ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE
WE ARE THE CHOSEN ONES
HUMAN BONES BLANKET THE DIRT
OF THE HEATHENS LAIR
THAT WE MUST PASS THIS DEN OF DETH
THE ONLY PATH FROM HERE
BUT I WALK IN THE LIGHT
THE TIME TO DIE HAS COME
NO-ONE SHALL TAKE MY LIFE
I'M OF THE CHOSEN ONES
BLACK SHADOWS FILL THE SKY
AS THE CREATURES EYES GROW NEAR
RAISE THE SHIELD OF THE HOLY PILGRIMS
HIGH INTO THE AIR
HEAVENS POWERS FILL MY ARMS
ONWARD NOW TO FIGHT I'M SENT
OH THE BEAST IS COMING
TO PUT YOU TO THE TEST
[SOLO: MUSTAINE]

LOOKOUT!
NOW THIS LAND IS MINE TO PILAGE
RAPE, AND STEAL, AND TAKE AT WILL
NEVER LET YOU CROSS THIS PATH
I REIGN FOR NOW I STAY TO KILL
