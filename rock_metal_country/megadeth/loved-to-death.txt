[D. MUSTAINE]

YOUR BODIES EMPTY NOW
AS I HOLD YOU
NOW YOUR GONE I MISS YOU
BUT I TOLD YOU
I REMEMBER BAD TIMES
MORE THAN GOOD
THERE'S NO COMING BACK
EVEN IF WE COULD
I LOVED YOU TO DETH
IF I CAN'T HAVE YOU
THAN NO ONE WILL
AND SINCE I WON'T
I'LL HAVE TO KILL
MY ONLY LOVE, SOMETHING
I'VE NEVER FELT
NOW YOU'VE GONE TO HEAVEN
AND I'LL BURN IN HELL
I LOVED YOU TO DEATH

[SOLO: MUSTAINE]
AND NOW I'M DOWN BELOW

AND WHAT DO I SEE
YOU DIDN'T GO TO HEAVEN
YOUR DOWN IN HELL WITH ME
AND NOW YOUR COMING BACK
BABY TAKE ME PLEASE!
I REALLY THINK I WOULD
IF YOU WEREN'T SUCH A SLEZE
I LOVED YOU ONCE BEFORE
YOU KEPT ME ON A STRING
I'D RATHER GO WITHOUT
THAN TAKE WHAT YOU WOULD BRING !
I LOVED YOU TO DETH
