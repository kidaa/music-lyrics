Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the lord my soul to keep
If I die before i wake
Pray the lord to take

I'm not going to wake up today
They've pulled my plug the picture fades
And as my body decays mold begins to fill my grave
The smell of death permeates the silk within my coffin lays
Go to hell

As they bury me now six feet there my body lies
Still feel like I'm giong down I hear a distant wailing cry
God something must've gone wrong
And much too late I realize
Go to hell

I saw my funeral that day
I know who didn't show to mourn
My judgement was life in hell
Pillars of pain and thorns
My only friend's the goat
With 666 between his horns
Go to hell

Place all your trust here in me
Rest assured these things I know
And as Charon sails the sea
Your journey too shall end below
Ah yes you're all sitting ducks
It's true you reap what you sow
Go to hell

Now I lay me down to sleep
Blah, blah, blah my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
I'll go to hell for heaven's sake
