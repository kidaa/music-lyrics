Forgive me father for I have sinned
I'm a child of air, I'm a witch of the wind
And I'm still wide awake... Mary Jane

From the earth, up through the trees
I can hear her calling me
Her voice rides on the breeze
Oh, it's haunting me

No, I can't get away
No, there's no escape
If I know I'm going crazy
I must not be insane

Beware my friends, as you pass by
As you are now so once was I
As I'm now so you must be
Prepare my friends to follow me

Forgive me father for I have sinned
I'm a child of air, I'm a witch of the wind
Fingers gripped around my brain
No control my mind is lame
I'm in the astral plane, and I'll never be the same
Never, never, never, never, never, never
Never, never, never

It hurts so bad I can't breathe
Prepare to follow me
