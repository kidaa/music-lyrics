Endangered species, caged in fright
Shot in cold blood, no chance to fight
The stage in set, now pay the price
An ego boost don't think twice
Technology, the battle's unfair
You pull the hammer without a care
Squeeze the trigger that makes you Man
Pseudo-safari, the hunt is canned ...
The hunt is canned

All are gone, all but one
No contest, nowhere to run
No more left, only one
This is it, this is the Countdown to Extinction

Tell the truth, you wouldn't dare
The skin and thophy, oh so rare
Silence speaks louder than words
Ignore the guilt, and take your turn
Liars anagram is "liars"
Man you were never even there
Killed a few feet from the cages
Point blank, you're so courageous ...
So courageous

[Chorus]

One hour from now
Another species of life form
Will disappear off the face of the planet
Forever ... and the rate is accelerating
