Uneasy feeling, Burning out my eyes
I hope the end is less painful than my life
I stand on trial before the gods
On Judgement day
A blink of an eye between
The cradle and the grave

One last look at visions of flesh
The last hope of man on earth
Pontius Pilate still washing his hands
The world don't want to be saved
Only left alone

Elysian Fields...
We are storming the heavens
To raise the swords and shields
We ascend to our destiny
To the Elysian fields

Soaring to the sun
With blood upon their wings
Superstitious dust left twisting in the wind
Man still has one belief
One decree that stands alone
The laying down of arms
I like cancer to their bones
