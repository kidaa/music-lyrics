The tides of change pulled us apart
I feel a familiar pain
It seems like years since we've loved
Or even liked and that's a lonely way to be

Drifting alone in a sea of agony
Your face I can't recognize
Don't make this hard on us
I will miss you if you just go away

I did no right you did no wrong
Nothing left but wasted days
I regret you leaving
But I will never take you back

[Solo - Pitrelli]

You know what? It's over
I just don't feel the same way as I used to
We've been together forever, but it's over

Goodbye 1000 times goodbye
The thought never crossed my mind
That this would be my last goodbye
Let me put pennies on your eyes
And kiss your lips one last goodbye
My love 1000 times goodbye

It seems nothing good is free
A good thing cost much more than the price
You were good but not that good
Don't kid yourself now it's time to beak up

Drifting alone in a sea of agony
Your face I can't recognize
Don't make this hard on us
I will miss you if you just go away

I did no right you did no wrong
Nothing left but wasted days
I regret you leaving
But I'll never take you back

[Solo - Pitrelli]

Don't call me anymore. It's just not.
I don't feel the same way about you
Its not as good as it used to be

Goodbye 1000 times goodbye
The thought never crossed my mind
That this would be my last goodbye
Let me put pennies on your eyes
And kiss your lips one last goodbye
My love 1000 times goodbye

[Repeat Chorus]

[Solo - Mustaine]

I'll always love you but just not like that
Like what?
I want to be honest with you I met someone else
You did what?
And I really, I really love him like I used to love you
Remember the time that I told you that
I was going out of town for business?
Well I went to see him
You know what? You suck!

[Solo - Mustaine]

Goodbye 1000 times
You'll always have a special place
In my heart you know that
It's just I can't be with you anymore it's over
Goodbye 1000 times
Things may not work out with him
Goodbye 1000 times
And if they don't
Goodbye 1000 times
Then I'll certainly call you
Goodbye 1000 times
You mean a lot to me
I still really want to be friends with you
I love you like you're my brother


5. Burning Bridges

[Dave Mustaine]

You give up on yourself
Somehow you got betrayed agin
Thin ice and luck runs out
Who will you blame it on this time?

Due to lack of interest in you
The light at the end of the tunnel
Was turned off
And something I noticed
Beating you is thrilling me
I've got a secret for you

If you took your own direction
If only you practice what you preach
If you follow your advice
You wouldn't be burning bridges all the time

Don't close your eyes to injustice
Listen, being brave ain't chicken shit
A man without any valor
Has nothing worth living for

Due to lack of interest in you
The light at the end of the tunnel
Was turned off
And something I noticed
Beating you is thrilling me
I've got a secret for you

If you took your own direction
If only you practice what you preach
If you follow your advice
You wouldn't be burning bridges all the time

[Solo - Mustaine]

[Solo - Pitrelli]

If you took your own direction
If only you practice what you preach
If you follow your advice
You wouldn't be burning bridges all the time

If you took your own direction
If only you practice what you preach
If you follow your advice
You wouldn't be burning bridges all the time
