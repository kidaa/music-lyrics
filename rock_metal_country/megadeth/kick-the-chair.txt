Dawn breaks evenly today
On the truth and the lie
All rise court's in session
Were hanging someone high

Justice means nothing today
Now that the courts are for sale
Pick a crime from the menu, pick a sentence and defend you
And pick up the down payment called bail
The systems for sale

Kick the chair, the rope's tight
Just like one quick wrench, the tooth is out
Friend or foe, I gotta hang em dead
Or they'll come back around
Kick it!

The courts wrong when it keeps track
Of victories and defeats
The press that never rests just waits
Fr somebody's soul they can eat

Justice means nothing today
Now that the jury's for sale
Guilty or not, the verdicts a lie
You're going to jail
The system has failed

Kick the chair, the rope's tight
Just like one quick wrench, the tooth is out
Friend or foe, ya gotta hang em dead
Or they'll come back
