IF I SEE THE MORNING HOURS
I'LL HAVE ONE MORE YESTERDAY
TAKE LIFE FROM TOMORROW
CAUSE I'VE BURNED OUT MY TODAY

IF I GET UP TO THE TOP I KNOW
I'LL JUST GO BACK DOWNHILL
GOTTA' TERMINAL FUTURE
AND IT'S TIME TO WRITE MY WILL

DOWN ANOTHER GLASS OF COURAGE
AND A SHOT OF THORAZINE

WE'RE NOT READY TO SEE YOU YET
99 WAYS TO DIE
WE'RE NOT READY TO SEE YOU YET
GOTTA' SHORT BETWEEN THE EARPHONES
WRINGING MY HANDS IN DISMAY
A MORE EFFICIENT MANIAC
WITH TWO FEET IN THE GRAVE

AIN'T GOT NO LAST WORDS TO SAY
YELLOW STREAK RIGHT UP MY SPINE
THE GUN IN MY MOUTH WAS REAL
AND THE TASTE BLEW MY MIND

IN A BLACK TIE AND STRAIGHT JACKET
MAN I'M GONNA TRY AGAIN

[CHORUS REPEAT]

DEMITASSE OF ARSENIC
TRY ON THIS TIE
NEVER MIND THE TREE

THERE IS ONLY DEATH AND DANGER
IN THE SOCKETS OF MY EYES
A PLAYGROUND OF ILLUSION
NO ONE PLAYS THEY ONLY DIE

THERE'S A PRISON IN MY MIND
AND THE BARS ARE GONNA BREAK
I'M AS MAD AS A HATTER
AND STRUNG OUT JUST THE SAME

TAUNTING RIGOR MORTIS
I FEEL IT DRAW ME IN
