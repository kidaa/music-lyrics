[D. MUSTAINE]

IMAGINE YOU WERE AT MY STATION
AND YOU BROUGHT YOUR MOTOR TO ME
YOUR A BURNER YEAH A REAL MOTOR CAR
SAID YOU WANNA GET YOUR ORDER FILLED
MADE ME SHIVER WHEN I PUT IT IN
PUMPING JUST WON'T DO YA KNOW LUCKILY FOR YOU
WHO EVER THOUGH YOU'D BE BETTER
AT TURNING A SCREW THAN ME
I DO IT FOR MY LIFE
MADE MY DRIVE SHAFT CRANK
MADE MY PISTONS BULDGE
MADE MY BALL BEARINGS MELT FROM THE HEAT
WE WERE SHIFTING HARD WHEN WE TOOK OFF
PUT TONIGHT ALL FOUR ON THE FLOOR
WHEN WE HIT TOP END YA KNOW IT FEELS TOO SLOW
I'M GIVING YOU MY ROOM SERVICE
AND YA KNOW IT'S MORE THAN ENOUGH
OH ONE MORE TIME YA KNOW I'M IN LOVE
[SOLO: MUSTAINE]
