The memories and emotions that I've been through
Are things I can't unlearn
But I won't go on standing on the bridges
You've tried so hard to burn
I can't put those fires out and let somebody in
If everything my life's about is who we might've been
Till we forget the love we lost we won't remember
How to love again
Chorus:
That's who I use to be holding onto nothing
Giving everything I use to be to belong to someone
That I know is who I use to see when I looked at you
You were never who I use to see
That's who I use to be, and I'm not who I use to be
Coming to my senses now I'm feeling things
I thought I couldn't feel
I don't take for granted if it feels like love
It must not be real
I still find myself out on some bridges now and then
I'm stuck out in the middle trying to reach the other end
But I'm through holding back the flames
To show somebody how to love again
Repeat Chorus
