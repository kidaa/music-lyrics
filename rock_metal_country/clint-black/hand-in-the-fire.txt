I haven't been there, I haven't done that
I never been one to know where it's at
I've been around and I've seen a few things
I don't know what a lot of it means
The truth'll never ring clear as a bell, but I...
Don't believe that you never can tell
Most things I don't have a clue
But I can tell by lookin' I know all about you
Chorus:
You don't have to put your hand in the fire
To know your little fingers are gonna get burned
You don't have to be standing on the moon
To know your little planet is gonna get turned
You don't have to take a walk in the sea
To know it gets a little deep and it's really not blue
I don't have to have my arms all around you
To know I wanna hold you and to know that I love you
I've never been one to go to extremes
I see 'em coming and I get in between
Never ahead and never behind
I figure everything'll happen in time
And just in time it's happening now
It's not up to either one of us to ever know how
With both eyes closed I could easily see
It's happening to you and it's gonna be me
Repeat Chorus
Exit:
You don't have to put your hand in the fire
You don't have to be standing on the moon
No No, No No
You don't have to take a walk in the sea
To know it gets a little deep and it's really not blue
I don't have to have my arms all around you
To know I wanna hold you and to know that I love you
You don't have to put your hand in the fire
No not to feel the heat, no
You don't have to be standing on the moon
Not to know that I took 
You don't have to take a walk in the sea
It's gettin' deep, I know it's gettin' deep now
You don't have to put your hand in the fire
Ahh not to feel the heat, no
You don't have to be walkin' on the moon
I don't have to have my arms all around you
To know I wanna hold you and to know that I love you
Yes I do
