When you're feeling inside out and insecure,
and life keeps getting you down.
When all life's daily worrieshurry through your head.
You don't want to even get up.
You just lie around in bed.
When you feel you just can't take it anymore
And you wonder what on Earth it is all forYour love life's like a war zone
Your TV's on the blinkIt's enough to drive a drinking man to stop and take a 
think
Just remember that you standing on a planet that's evolving,revolving at 900 
miles an hour.It's orbiting at 19 miles a second, so it's reckoned,
a sun that is the source of all our power.
The Sun and you and me and all the stars that we can see
are moving at a million miles a day.
In an outer spiral orb, at 40,000 miles an hour,
of the Galaxy we call the Milky Way
Our Galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars.
It's a 100,000 light years side to side
It bulges in the middle 16,000 light years thick,
but out by us it's just 3,000 light years wide.
We're 30,000 light years from galactic central point.
We go round every 200,000,000 years.
And our galaxy is only one of millions of billions
in this amazing and expanding Universe.
Our Universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding
in all of the directions it can whiz
As fast as it can go, the speed of light you know, 12,000,000 miles a minute, 
and that's the fastest speed there is!
So, remember when you're feeling very small and insecure
how amazingly unlikely is your birth.
And pray that there's intelligent life somewhere up in space,
'cause I'm afraid that we've been cheated here on Earth.
