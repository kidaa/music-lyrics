Desperado
Why don't you come to your senses
Ben out ridin' fences, for so long now
Oh, you're a hard one 
But I know that you got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you 
Can hurt you somehow
Don't you draw the queen of diamonds boy
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
But it seems to me some fine things have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones you can't get
Desperado 
Oh, you ain't gettin' no younger
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
And freedom, oh freedom, well that's just some people talkin'
Your prison is walkin' through this world all alone
Don't your feet get cold in the wintertime
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the nighttime from the day
And you're losin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feelin' goes away
Desperado
Why don't you come to your senses
Come down from those fences, open the gate
It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you, let somebody love you
You better let somebody love you
Before it's too late
