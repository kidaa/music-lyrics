I've been bound to leave you, we've known that for awhile
I'm sure it's something I can't do if I can't leave you with a smile
I don't know how far I'll have to go 'til I'm sure those eyes won't cry
And in my mind I've left enough to know that I can't leave you
With a bad goodbyeGoodbye, easier said than done
Goodbye, there's no good when you're the one
Whose goodbye you swore would never come
And in my goodbye you're finding none
I'm still bound to leave you, I surely don't know how
My heart won't let me put you through
What my mind says should happen now
I don't know where we'll go from here, there may be no way to fly
And the cloud I'm in just makes it all too clear that I can't leave you
With a bad goodbye
Repeat Chorus
How can we be so far between where we are and one more try
And any way I look, I've only seen that I can't leave you
With a bad goodbye
