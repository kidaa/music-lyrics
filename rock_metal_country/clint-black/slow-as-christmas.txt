Chorus
You're as slow as christmas, I was up before the dawn
Up so fast I missed it or was that old saying wrong
Every Christmas Day makes every other day seem long
And what seemed would never get here
Has so quickly come and gone
Verse One
I've heard old sayings, old cliches and 
most of them make sense
But we're wiser in our younger days not easily convinced
There's no way to look ahead with the wool over your eyes
And it seems that Santa's sled isn't the only thing that flies
Repeat Chorus
Verse Two
We're bringing  in another year let's throw the old one back
With my new train I'll be the engineer 
and hurry down the track
While I know that time is standing still 
I hear that old cliche
And I'm more convinced it does until that
One December day
Chorus Two
When I'm as slow as christmas
I'll be up before the dawn
I'm gonna miss this
I know that old saying's wrong
Every christmas day makes other  day seem long
And what seemed would never get here
Has so quickly come and gone,
Come and gone
