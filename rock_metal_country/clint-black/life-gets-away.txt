We're tied to our memories
They won't let us stray
We're not gonna lose ones
We made yesterday
We look to our future
And we make all our plans
As if we control what is out of our hands
Chorus
The world keeps on turning
I'm learning to see
Right where I am is where I have to be
You can't count the pages
All ages hear the call
No matter how hard we try
Life gets away from us all
We start getting older
The moment we live
Look over your shoulder
There's hindsight to give
Come good days and bad days
The sun's gonna rise
So why look beyond what's in front of your eyes
Repeat Chorus
No matter how hard we try
Life gets away from us all
