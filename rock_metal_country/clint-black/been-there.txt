Did you ever wake up in the middle of the night
And wonder where you were
You need the one and only that can hold you tight
And you reach for her, but she's not with you
You just wish this trip would end
You know I've been there, I don't wanna go back again
Did you ever wake up in the middle of the day
And wonder who you are
You suddenly discover there's a price you pay
For gettin' this far, and it's the part of you
You really don't have to spend
You know I've been there, and I don't wanna go back again
Bridge:
There's so many moments that I've left incomplete
Those are the moments that I'm not gonna repeat, no
Did you ever wake up in the middle of a dream
That didn't come true
You think you're gotta give up on makin' that scene
And seeing it through, you feel like breaking
When you really just need to bend
You know I've been there, and I'll never go back again
Repeat Bridge
