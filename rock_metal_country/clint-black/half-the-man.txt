She's every reason I take so much work on
And every reason I take so much time at home
And every single reason why I'm so much stronger
And every reason I could never be alone
Look at me, you'll see who I've found
I'm beside myself whenever she's around
Without her, you'd see a different man
It's what she makes of me, she's half the man I am
When the rivers all run dry, she finds the water
And when everything is dark, she finds the light
And when it's time to fly, she's flying with me
With her on the wing, we balance out just right
Repeat Chorus
I'm what she's made of me, she's half the man I am
