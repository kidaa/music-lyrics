Now I'm only five years old
I've got to do just what I'm told
'cause Santa Claus is gonna be dropping in on me
Now is there something I might have missed
I had quite a few things on my list
I hope he can fit it all under that Christmas tree.
Now I know what he like for a late night snack
For years now it's been bringing him back
Milk and cookies
He'll come and go without a sound again
But how in the world does he get in
Ain't got a chimney
Close my eyes and concentrate
Try to sleep it's getting late
All night long I lie awake
Till Santa's Gone I just can't wait
Now is there something I might have missed
I had quite a few things on my list
I hope he can get it all under that Christmas tree.
Sneak a peek down the hall
I've got to check Now I don't recall
the milk and cookies
I think I'm sure I got it all
Stockings hung a-long the wall
Ain't got a chimney
Close my eyes and concentrate
I gotta sleep now it's getting late
All night long I lie awake
Till Santa's Gone I just can't wait
Just can't wait, just can't wait
Could there be something I might have missed
I had quite a few things on my list
I hope he can fit it all under that Christmas tree.
I hope he can fit it all under my Christmas tree.

Let's see, I know he can fit...he can fit the airplane under there.  He can
get the bicycle in there
and the...and the gum ball machine and don't know what he's gonna do with
that horse.
