Lord it's the same old thing 
Fiddle and guitar 
Where do we take it from here ? 
Rhinestone suits, new shiny cars, 
It's been the same way for years. 
It's bound to change.
Somebody told me when I came to Nashville, 
";Son, you finally got it made";
Ole Waylon made it here, and we're all sure that you will 
But I don't think Waylon done it this way, 
No, I don't think Waylon done it this way. 
Ten years on the road making one-night stands 
Speeding my young life away. 
Tell me one more time just so's I'll understand 
Are you sure Waylon done it this way ? 
Did ole Waylon really do it this way ? 
I've seen the world with an eight piece band 
Looking at the back side of me 
Singing my songs one of his now and then 
But I don't think Waylon done 'em this way, 
No, I don't think Waylon done 'em this way. 
Waylon Jennings
Woke up this morning it was drizzlin' rain
Around the curve come a long, black train
Heard somebody yodel and a hobo moan
Jimmy he's dead, he's been a long time gone.
Yeah
