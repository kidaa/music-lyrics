I guess you're glad to see I'm finally leaving
I know things for you will change now for the good
But it's all that I can do to pack my suitcase
And walk away from you the way I should
And I can't seem to find the voice of reason
Everything seems upside down and right side wrong
While a part of me is here and won't like leaving
The rest of me the best of me is gone
And I'm sure no one will wonder where I've gone to
But if anyone should ask from time to time
Tell them that you finally drove me crazy
And I'm somewhere untanglin' my mind
Well tell 'em I won't be riding I'll be walking
'Cause I don't think a crazy man should drive
Anyway the car belongs to you now
Along with any part of me that's still alive
But there's really not much left you could hold on to
And if you did it wouldn't last here anyway
It would head to where the rest of me rolled on to
So even if I wanted to I couldn't stay
Repeat Chorus
And I'm somewhere untanglin' my mind
