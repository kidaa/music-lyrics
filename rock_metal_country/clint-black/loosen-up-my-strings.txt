No one's gonna jerk me around
One I get my feet on the ground
I'm gonna hit it runnin
Gonna call it a day
See, a little bit of tension
Goes a long, long way
The boss man has got mine in a sling
But I'll be swingin when I loosen up my strings
Every night when the sun goes down
You won't find me hangin around
I'm in loco-motion like a rock out on roll
I'm nobody's puppet
I'm out of control
The boss man has got mine in a sling
But I'll be swingin when I loosen up my...
Now, when it comes to getting down
And I'm always keepin track
I don't need some yo-yo takin up my slack
The boss man has got mine in a sling
But I'll be swingin when I loosen up my strings
Yeah, he'll have a line on me til my fat lady sings
But I'll be swingin while I loosen up my strings
Yeah, we'll all be swingin while I loosen up my strings
Hey, we'll all be swingin when I loosen up my strings
