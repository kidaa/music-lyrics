Verse One
Last night I dreamed I was a kid again
All the things  I used to do I went and did again
Spent the afternoon with my best and closest friend
Wanderin' through the days we thought would never end
It was back when I'd still get things from Santa Claus
Back when he believed in me and overlooked the flaws
That can grow inside until it hides the
Perfect little boy inside the man
Chorus
I'm not a kid anymore, but I still believe
That those miracles occur
That's not something up his sleeve
And that the reindeer pull the sleigh and
The elves will make the toys
Santa gives away to all the girls and boys
Verse Two
Tonight I'll climb back in that bed again
Try to live out all my dreams inside my head again
After christmas eve with my best and closest friend
Who will believe the world's greatest dad
Just tucked him in
And I know that he'llbe looking out for santa claus
And I'm sure beyond a doubt he'll overlook the flaws
That will grow inside until it hides this
perfect little boy inside a man
Chorus Two
I'm not a kid anymore and I still believe
That miracles occur
That's not something up his sleeve
And that the reindeer pull the sleigh and
the elves do make the toys
Santa gives away to all the girls and boys
