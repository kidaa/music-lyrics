Bottle of scotch whiskey not very smooth
Like snake bite cure from the medicine man
Not bad poison if there's something to soothe
It's a whole other world in the palm of your hand
Out of this world and out of your mind
Just like it don't matter what you're leaving behind
Trying to change your life you change your point of view
But no matter what you do it's the same old you
Wherever you go there you are
You can run from yourself but you won't get far
You can dive to the bottom of your medicine jar
But wherever you go there you are
Bottle of scotch whiskey whatever you find
When you're out on a wire it's a matter of time
Changing every moment when you're taking the fall
There's everything to gain when you're losing it all
Feel your head spinning with your feet on the ground
You climb the wrong ladder and it's keeping you down
Think you're gettin' higher but you're still layin' low
You don't want to be anyone you know
Repeat Chorus
Once you've been bitten it's like crossing a line
It's a part of the plan all that's on your mind
Think that it'll help you find somebody to be
But the man in the mirror is all you'll see
Repeat Chorus
