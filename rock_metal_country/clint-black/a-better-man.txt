What do you say when it's over?
I don't know if I should say anything at all
One day we're rollin' in the clover
Next thing you know we take the fall
Still, I think about the years since I first met you
And the way it might have been without you here
And I don't know if words from me can still upset you
But I've just gotta make this memory stand clear
I know I'm leavin' here a better man
For knowin' you this way
Things I couldn't do before, now I think I can
And I'm leavin here a better man
I guess I always knew I couldn't hold you
But I'd never be the one to set you free
Just like some old nursery rhyme your mama told you
You still believe in some old meant-to-be
Repeat chorus
Still, I'm leavin' here a better man...
Repeat chorus
