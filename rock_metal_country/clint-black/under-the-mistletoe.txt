There's no telling how far a kiss'll go
Wish on the highest star that this'll go

On right here where we are under the mistletoe

On Christmas night, it seems so right

That a lovely holiday dish made a mess of me
If love is this, it's my favourite recipe

The kind that fits to remind the rest of me

There's room to grow, under the mistletoe

But I made this ";mist"; as a Christmas wannabe

With a Christmas list that insists I've gotta be

Hugged and kissed by this sweet miss in front of me

On Christmas night and every night

Just right here, in the doorway where they found us

They'd like to leave but there's no way around us

I believe there's a spell that bound us

I've gotta know, is it only the mistletoe
Gotta know, I'm afraid to go

Don't want out if we're in the throes

Flames die out in the afterglow
And I've gotta know, is it only the mistletoe

Don't think so

Gotta know, I'm afraid to go
Don't want out if we're in the throes

Flames die out in the afterglow
And I've gotta know, is it only the mistletoe

Don't think so

I gotta know
Say it ain't, say it ain't ... just the mistletoe
