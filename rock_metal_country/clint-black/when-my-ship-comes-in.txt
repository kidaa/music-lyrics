No sun on the Rockies, not even the light of day
I feel that old cabin fever coming on
But I know where I'll be when lady luck finally blows my way
She'll put the wind in my sails and I'll be gone
It won't be long before my ship comes in
Gonna sail right out of Colorado
Catch a ride on a warm trade wind to Puerta No-One-Knows
She'll find me waiting when my ship comes in
Gonna board and go whichever way the wind blows
I'll be off to find myself once again in Puerta No-One-Knows
When my ship comes in
Maybe I'm only dreaming but it sure seems real
Somehow the wind doesn't chill quite to the bone
Or could it just be the fever I'm running on an uneven keel
Not losing sight of why I'm up here alone
Chorus
It won't be long before my ship comes in
She'll find me waiting when my ship comes in
It won't be long before my ship comes in
She'll find me waiting when my ship comes in
When my ship comes in
