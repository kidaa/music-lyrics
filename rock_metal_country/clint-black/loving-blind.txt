Well I sit here all alone
No one's gonna do me wrong tonight
It seems I've been through it all
And there's no one I could call to get it right
And everywhere I go
Everyone seems so settled in
And sure of where they're going
Well I don't know what I need
Since I've been freed
I'm a horse without a rider
And there's no one left to take the lead
I've been loving blind
Loving every heart I could call mine
I've been loving blind
So sure there was something I could find
But I just couldn't see
There was nothing there for me
Now there's a smile on my face
No there's no trace of the pain
I know I've been through it all
And I know those tears won't fall again
But oh the times I thought
Someone's heart I'd caught
Well, I was fooled oh and I regret
I was so naive
Oh and I'd believe them when they'd tell me
That's as good as love can get
And I've been loving blind
Loving every heart I could call mine
And I've been loving blind
So sure there was something I could find
But I just couldn't see
