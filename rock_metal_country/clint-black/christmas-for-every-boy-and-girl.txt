Verse One
The roar of his laughter is widely renown
A distinct ho-ho-ho as he goes town to town
The number of kids is sure to astound
It's many the chimney that he'll shimmy down
He know's who's been bad and who's good
And he'd empty that bag out if only he could
Chorus
When he's loading his sleigh and he's making the rounds
There'll be many a rooftop that won't hear the sound
Of the reindeers hooves stomp and St. Nick touches down
When he wraps up a package of peace for the world
There'll be christmas for every boy and girl
Verse Two
How many children are watching the sky
For a chance to see Rudolph's red nose glowing by
And how many lay listening with sleep in their eyes
And visions of patriots crossing the sky
He knows who's asleep and awake
And that promise won't keep if it's for goodness sake
Chorus repeat twice
...Around the world
