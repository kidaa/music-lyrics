Ain't that the way the luck goes
Seems like it never can be found
Break my back to make those bank notes
Payin' on an almost always broken down
Fix that car nine ways to Sunday
And it won't start again when Monday rolls around
Ain't that the way the rent goes
Seems like it's never goin' down
And that banker's bound to foreclose
At this rate, I'll lose my interest in this town
Paint the walls mend the windows
'Bout the time the roof comes crumblin' to the ground
I've been footin' the bill for some time
Stretchin' my credit out of line
Well I may not get ahead but now I won't be far behind
I've got one more payment and it's mine
We're gonna swing it
Ain't that the way the heart goes
Seems they just attack without a sign
My mind's been on vacation
And my body's been workin' overtime
But I've done all that I can do
There's just one more balance due before it's mine
I've been footin' the bill for some time
Step by step and line by dotted line
Well I haven't bought the farm yet
But I'm not that far behind
I've got one more payment and it's mine
One more payment and it's mine
One more payment and it's mine
One more
One more
