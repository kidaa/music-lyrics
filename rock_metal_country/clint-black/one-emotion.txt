Looking for the feelings
That used to tell me something's wrong
Like all the doubts
When love sent shivers down my spine
But all I'm feeling
Is pure and simply we belong
And what's come over me
Are chills of another kind
One emotion wrapped around me
One emotion I can hold on to
Wherever it's going is exactly where I want to be
One emotion's got a hold of you and me
There's nothing left
Of the useless things I used to feel
Only love now
As everything else just fades away
It's all around us
Though you might not see it
It's just as real as the wild horses
You would have to have to drag me away
Repeat Chorus
