Straight From The Factory
Straight from the factory
We were made for each other
One of those things that's meant to be
Straight from the factory
Nothin' less than exactly
You're the only lock that's made to fit my key.
Many parts and many hearts
Been mismatched before
Still they make delivery.
Some folks send 'em back and never find what they need
But babe my satisfaction's guaranteed.
Straight from the factory
We were made for each other
One of those things that's meant to be
Straight from the factory
Nothin' less than exactly
You're the only lock that's made to fit my key.

Straight from the factory
We were made for each other
One of those things that's meant to be
Straight from the factory
Nothin' less than exactly
You're the only lock that's made to fit my key.
Sittin' tight and sittin' proud
Waitin' on a shove
Passers by just keep on passin' by
I'll admit I did a bit of passin' by myself
Til' I found a perfect fit
And now I'm tied.
Straight from the factory
We were made for each other
Perfect match as anyone can see
Straight from the factory
Nothin' less than exactly
You're the only lock that's made to fit my key.
You're the only lock that's made to fit my key.............
