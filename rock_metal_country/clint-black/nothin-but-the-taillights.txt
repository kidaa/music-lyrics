Blue Kentucky highway, headin' for the line
She hadn't said a word all night,
But the wheels are turnin' in her mind
Now I was ridin' shotgun,
And I knew things had gone awry
Just as soon as she dropped me off
At the side of the road
And she let that gravel fly
CHORUS
Now I'm walkin' in the moonlight,
Seein' nothin' but the taillights
And that's a pair of taillights
I may never see again
She hit me with the left and right,
Showin' me nothin' but the taillights
And that's about as lonely
As the highway's ever been
Back here with my thumb out in the wind
Was it somethin' that I did to her,
Or the things I never said
I wonder if the way we were was only in my head
Now if I even make it back to town
Before the sun comes up
I'm gonna hit every parking spot around
'Til I find that pick-up truck
CHORUS
Now I'm talkin' in the moonlight
Seein' nothin' but the taillights
And that's a pair of taillights
I may never see again
She hit me with the left and right
Showin' me nothin' but the taillights
And that's about as lonely
As a highway's ever been
Stuck here with my thumb out in the wind
Well I'll bet right now she's laughin'
At how she brought me to my knees
But she won't be laughin' half as loud
When she gives me back my keys
CHORUS
She'll be walkin' in the moonlight,
Seein' nothin' but the taillights
And that's a pair of taillights
She won't ever see again
She hit me with a left and right
And with nothin' but the taillights
And I know that's about as lonely
As a highway's ever been
Back here with my thumb out in the wind
