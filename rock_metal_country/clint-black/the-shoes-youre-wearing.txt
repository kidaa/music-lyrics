We've all seen enough wrong and right
To know everything's not black and white
There's always something in between
No matter how long or well you live
You don't get anything you don't give
Still no slate is clean
For better or worse, anybody can
Take a look around and find a better man
Upright no matter how he's faring
No matter what kind of shoes he's wearing
The shoes he's wearing
They don't make the man
So many people out running around
Handicapped before they hit the ground
Thinking there's nowhere to go 
Shouldn't we all be looking for ways 
To keep on seeing our better days
We're not chained to what we know
But if your eyes are open and your mind is free
There's no tellin' what a man can be
Upright no matter how you're faring
No matter what kind of shoes you're wearing
The shoes you're wearing
They don't make the man
But if you can't walk through the best of times and the worst of times
Find your feet still walking the line
You'll never carry the load worth bearing
No matter what kind of shoes you're wearing
The shoes you're wearing
They won't make the man
The shoes you're wearing
They won't make the man
