Your mind is made up you won't even try
You didn't even cry this time
You say that we could never see eye to eye
And one of us just must be blind
We have our differences
We're still the same
See what we want to see
But you take a second look
And maybe things wouldn't seem the same
If you could see what you mean to me
Put yourself in my shoes
Walk a mile for me
I'll put myself in your shoes
Maybe then we'd see
That if you put yourself in my shoes
You'd have some sympathy
And if I could only put myself in your shoes
I'd walk right back to me
You're gonna keep walkin' and you're gonna pass me by
You say you don't even care
But I could always recognize a real good-bye
And I know your heart's not there
We've had our differences
We're still the same
Hear what we want to hear
Now I'm head over heels in the lost and found
It's a cryin' shame
I thought we made the perfect pair
Put yourself in my shoes
Walk a while walk that mile for me
I'll put myself in your shoes
Maybe then we'd see
That if you put yourself in my shoes
You'd have some sympathy
And if I could only put myself in your shoes
I'd walk right back to me
I'd walk right back to me
