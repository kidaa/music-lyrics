Out on the highway flyin' by me
Headlights and tail lights are all i could see
Down at the junction another flies by
They come and go in the blink of an eye
Down at the stripyou see 'em waitin' in line
Lay down the rubber let their motors unwind
No matter whether you can drive it that good
If you ain't got it revvin' under the hood
Chorus
Hey hey hot rod
Burnin' up the back streets tearin' up town
Hey hey hot rod
A hound for glory and the glory bound
Lit up and cruisin' on the good night tail
A rockin' motivator and the radio wails
Ahead of the heat movin' fast and cool
That mean machin is breakin' all the rules
Repeat Chorus
Out on the highway flyin' by me
The blinding headlights are all i could see
The killer curves are gonna drive me to far
And i ain't even started up my car
Repeat Chorus
You got the hottest set of wheels around
A hound for glory and the glory bound
