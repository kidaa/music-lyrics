Clint Black/Hayden Nicholas
He's Cadillac Jack Favor and the name rings true
If he's got a ride any stranger would too
The one bad habit that his Ponder would say
Is sure gonna put him through the trials one day 
And that's just what happened he took pity on two men
Heading down to Louisiana, he stopped and let them in
And the thanks he did for helping them
Would make him wish he was busting broncs again 
He dropped them off in Bossieer City where they met up with a man
That vagabond commitee barely even had a plan
It was just a simple robbery turned double homicide
They got away with murder it'd be someone else's hide 
Almost two years come and gone they never solved that crime
'Til they found one of our vagabonds already doing time
When that jailbird started singing they all knew the words were wrong
But the sheriff and the DA and the judge all sang along 
They pinned it on Jack Favor, gave him life without parole
Gave Jack's freedom to the jailbird, payment on the lies he told
Just so happens that election year everybody payed out at the polls 
Cadillac's no fallen hero and he's never gonna break
When it comes to prison rodeo, there'll be no easy eight
And if you want the definition of the picture-perfect frame
It'd be in the dictionary underneath Jack Favor's name 
Cadillac's no fallen hero and he's never gonna break
When it comes to prison rodeo, there's still no easy eight
And if you want the definition of the picture-perfect frame
It'd be in the dictionary underneath Jack Favor's name 
Yeah, it's the world's most crooked picture and when it comes to being framed
Cadillac Jack Favor should be in the hall of fame
