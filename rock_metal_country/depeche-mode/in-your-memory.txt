Put up the barriers shut down your senses 
Cover up with all of your pretences 
See no evil, your eyes are blunted 
We are the hunters, we are the hunted 

Place it in your memory 
Leave it in your past 
But don't forget 

Taking a tumble, I'm taking a dive 
Sometimes I stumble when my mind's made up 
Reaction levels seem strangely muted 
Ordinary acts of fun have been diluted 

Place it in your memory 
Leave it in your past 
But don't forget
