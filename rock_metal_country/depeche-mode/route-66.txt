Well if you ever plan to motor west 
Travel my way, take the highway that's the best 
Get your kicks on Route 66 

Well it winds from Chicago to LA 
More than two thousand miles all the way 
Get your kicks on Route 66 

Well it goes to St. Louis, down to Missouri 
Oklahoma City looks oh so pretty 
You'll see Amarillo, Gallup New Mexico, 
Flagstaff Arizona, don't forget Winona 
Kingman, Barstow, San Bernardino 

If you get hip to this kind of tip 
And go take that California trip 
Get your kicks on Route 66 

repeat "Well it goes..." part 

repeat last verse 

Get your kicks on Route 66  x5
