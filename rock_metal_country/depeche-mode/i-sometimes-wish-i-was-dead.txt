New sound all around 
You can hear it too 
Get it hot, never stop 
Just for me and you 
Playing on my radio 
And saying that you had to go 

New day, turn away 
Wipe away the tear 
New night, feel alright 
Knowing that you're here 
Dancing with you all the time 
And don't you think that it's a crime 

Back street, never meet 
Never say goodbye 
I know where you go 
But I don't know why 
You say that it's from above 
And I say "this is modern love?"
