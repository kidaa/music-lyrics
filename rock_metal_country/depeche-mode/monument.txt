When the site was found 
We laid the foundations down 
It didn't take long before 
They came back tumbling down 
Don't build at night 
You need a little light 
How else you going to see 
What it is going to be like! 

So we picked up our tools 
And we worked in the morning light 
With the last stone placed 
Wasn't it a wonderful sight 
But it fell back down 
And scattered all around 
Anything passes 
When you need glasses! 

My monument - it fell down 
My monument - it fell down 

Work all of my days for this kind of praise 
It fell down 
Work all of my days - it fell down
