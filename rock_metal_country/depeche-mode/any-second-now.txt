She remembered all the shadows and the doubts 
The same film 
Vivid pictures like a wall that's standing empty 
And the night so still 
Such a small affair a relapse someone closing 
Like the nightclub door 
Here again and when you speak I watch you move away 
And seem so sure 

She is hoping to forget and the moment 
Almost slips away 
When the colours move apart and I wonder 
If you want to stay 
And I need to change you like the words I'm reading 
Don't you understand 
This the warning and the message I remember 
As you touch my hand
