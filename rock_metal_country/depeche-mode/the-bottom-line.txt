Like a cat 
Dragged in from the rain 
Who goes straight back out 
To do it all over again 
I'll be back for more 
It's something 
That is out of our hands 
Something we will never understand 
It's a hidden law 
The apple falls 
Destiny calls 
I follow you 

Like a pawn 
On the eternal board 
Who's never quite sure 
What he's moved towards 
I walk blindly on 
And heaven is in front of me 
Your heaven beckons me enticingly 
When I arrive 
It's gone 
The river flows 
The wise man knows 
I follow you 

I'm yearning 
I'm burning 
I feel love's wheels turning 

Like a moth on love's bright light 
I will get burned 
Each and every night 
I'm dying too 
The sun will shine 
The bottom line 
I follow you
