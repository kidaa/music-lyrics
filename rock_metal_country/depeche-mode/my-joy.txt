My joy... the air that I breathe 
My joy... in God I believe 
My joy... 
You move me 

My joy... the blood in my veins 
My joy... it flows in your name 
My joy... 
You move me 

I'm not a mountain, no 
You move me 

My joy... the heavenly bliss 
My joy... the pleasure I miss 
My joy... 
You move me 

I'm not a mountain, no 
You move me
