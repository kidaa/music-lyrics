Here speaks the voice of reason 
It's talking to me loud and clearly 
And obviously, it's something to say 

Here comes another sentence 
It is relentless, it tries my patience 
But neverless, it's for our concern 

We can't see the benefits 
So we'll ignore it or disobey it 
And never say that this is fun 

This is real fun 
This is fun
