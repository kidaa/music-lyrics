Running through my head secretly 
The shouts of the boys in the factory 
I ring you on the telephone silently 
Like blood, like wine in the darkroom scene 

The darkroom scene, darkroom scene 

A letter, once composed 
Seven years long and as tall as a tree 
Reading on the wall 
Emissions, efficiency 

Efficiency, efficiency 

Resurrect, as a feeling, on my window 
Of a past reunion 

Resurrect as a feeling on my window 
Of a past reunion 
Vision of a picture like the city 
And the air we breathe 

The air we breathe, air we breathe 

She stood beside me once again 
I knew her face 
We met before in the street 
Recalling all the children dancing at our feet 

The dancing feet, dancing feet
