Death is everywhere 
There are flies on the windscreen 
For a start 
Reminding us 
We could be torn apart 
Tonight 

Death is everywhere 
There are lambs for the slaughter 
Waiting to die 
And I can sense 
The hours slipping by 
Tonight 

Come here 
Kiss me 
Now 
Come here 
Kiss me 
Now 

Death is everywhere 
The more I look 
The more I see 
The more I feel 
A sense of urgency 
Tonight 

Come here 
Touch me 
Kiss me 
Touch me 
Now 
Touch me 
Touch me 

There are flies on the windscreen 
There are lambs for the slaughter 
There are flies on the windscreen 

Come here 
Touch me 
Kiss me 
Touch me 
Now 
Touch me 
Touch me
