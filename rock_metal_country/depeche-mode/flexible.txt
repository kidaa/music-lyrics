Fame can have strange effects 
Money can have strange effects 

I ask myself, is it a sin 
To be flexible when the boat comes in 
Open the window and out go ideals 

Drink can alter you 
Girls can have strange effect too 

I ask myself, is it a sin 
To be flexible when the boat comes in 
Open the window and out go ideals 

We all know boats don't last 
We all know cars are fast 

I ask myself, is it a sin 
To be flexible when the boat comes in 
Open the window and out go ideals
