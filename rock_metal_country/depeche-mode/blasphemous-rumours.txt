Girl of 16 
Whole life ahead of her 
Slashed her wrists 
Bored with life 
Didn't succeed 
Thank the lord 
For small mercies 

Fighting back the tears 
Mother reads the note again 
16 candles burn in her mind 
She takes the blame 
It's always the same 
She goes down on her knees 
And prays 

I don't want to start 
Any blasphemous rumours 
But I think that God's 
Got a sick sense of humour 
And when I die 
I expect to find Him laughing 

Girl of 18 
Fell in love with everything 
Found new life 
In Jesus Christ 
Hit by a car 
Ended up 
On a life support machine 

Summer's day 
As she passed away 
Birds were singing 
In the summer sky 
Then came the rain 
And once again 
A tear fell 
From her mother's eye
