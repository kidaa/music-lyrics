The things you do 
Aren't good for my health 
The moves you make 
You make for yourself 
The means you use 
Aren't meant to confuse 
Although they do 
They're the one's that I would choose 

I wouldn't want it any other way 
You wouldn't let me any way 

Chorus 
Dangerous, 
The way you leave me wanting more 
Dangerous, 
That's what I want you for 
Dangerous, 
When I am in you arms 
Dangerous, 
No, I won't come to harm 

The lies you tell 
Aren't meant to deceive 
They're not there 
For me to believe 
I heard 
Your vicious words 
You know by now 
It takes alot to see me hurt 

I couldn't take it any other way 
But there's a price I have to pay 

Chorus
