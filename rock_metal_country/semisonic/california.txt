Driven through the canyons I was
Dazzled by the mountains and we didn't go very far
Close enough to heaven if you
Climb up on a mansion you too can swing like a star

I tried to get inside I bought a
Ticket with my pride and I was gone right out of my head
I went out for a ride to go
Across a great divide and I ended up at home instead

California
I thought I should see
Now I'm back home, yeah
With twelve little pieces of me

I was just a passenger a
Rider on the tremors that were shaking all our beds at night
A visitor a stranger thought I
Might pass for a regular if I just kept out of the lights

Tore my heart out from my chest
Mixed it up in my mind with the best freshest pieces of my soul
Chose the ones I loved the most
Drove 'em all down to the coast
Threw 'em in a big black hole

California
I thought I should see
Now I'm back home, yeah
With twelve little pieces of me
California
I dreamed I would find
Some kinda sorta pick-me-up
I got twelve little pieces of my mind
