Long ago I was told there were riches inside of me 
Someone old hid the gold and the finding was my affair 
In those days when my ears heard a story my mind believed 
So I searched with my greed in the sunshine for all to see there 

I'm in over my head in this game 
Over my head 
And I'm afraid I'm never gonna find my way back to where I've been 

Yes you know many tried none succeeded my mind to train 
When the fools came to lay down their money I laughed, uncool 
Saw the mouth of the whale just in time to go down the drain 
Now I float with my boat in the darkness and play the fool 

I'm in over my head in this game 
Over my head 
And I'm afraid I'm never gonna find my way back to where I've been 
I'm in over my head in this game 
Over my head 
And I'm afraid I'm never gonna find my way back to where I've been
