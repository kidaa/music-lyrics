Hold on tight to what you believe in
Hold on to whatever you need, o yeah
Step inside the sweet illusion
Of another life

Where it's enought to be well meaning
And if you crash your plane you can try it again, o yeah
Well this time while you're believing
In another lifeToo late I'm done waiting
I won't be there
In another life
In another time
You always believed we'd mend it later
In another life
In another time
well I'm done waiting

When you finally tend to your blessings
You'd be mistaken to count on me, o yeah
Because you believed we'd do our loving
In another life
DarlingToo late I'm done waiting
I won't be there
In another life
In another time
You always believed we'd mend it later
In another life
In another time
well I'm done waiting

If you come round to see me don't be surprised
Maybe I'm out waiting in another life
In Another Life...
