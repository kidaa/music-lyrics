Lonely boys and you lonely girls 
Here at the end of the lonely world 
You're finding out 
If there's someone to cry about 

Lonely girls and you lonely boys 
Playing alone with your lonely toys 
Well don't be blue 
If there's no one to play with you 

Get a grip on yourself you know you should 
I got a grip on myself and it feels good 
Get a grip on yourself take my advice 
I got a grip on myself and it feels nice 

When the lights come on and the party's through 
There are always a few with nobody to do 
Well now don't despair 
You'll eventually get there 

And meanwhile all of you lonely ones 
Here's what to do while you wait for the sun 
To rise above 
The loneliest kind of love 

Get a grip on yourself you know you should 
I got a grip on myself and it feels good 
Get a grip on yourself take my advice 
I got a grip on myself and it feels nice 

And it feels nice 
And it feels nice 4x 

If you're looking for someone to get a grip on you 
First you gotta get a grip on yourself it's true
