Walking into parties on your own 
It's getting old now 
Twice around the room and out alone 
It feels so cold now 

And I'm probably showing up 
Just about the time you leave 

Girlfriend, girlfriend 
Looking for a little bit of something sweet 
Girlfriend, girlfriend 
Wherever you are is where I'd like to be 

Waking up alone and knowing how 
I'm gonna spend the day 
In cd racks and Java Jacks 
The afternoon just slides away 

And you're probably sitting near 
With something you don't want to read 

Girlfriend, girlfriend 
Looking for a little bit of something sweet 
Girlfriend, girlfriend 
Trying to find a little bit of sympathy 
I get the feeling you're a lot like me 

I see Paris flights are cheap these days 
But I know how it's gonna go 
I'll be wearing out the same two phrases 

I don't smoke 
I'm here alone 

Walking into parties on your own 
It's getting old now 
Twice around the room and out alone 
It feels so cold now 

Girlfriend, girlfriend 
Looking for a little bit of something sweet 
Girlfriend, girlfriend 
Wherever you are is where I'd like to be 

Girlfriend, girlfriend 
Trying to find a little bit of sympathy 
Girlfriend, girlfriend 
Why do I get the feeling you're a lot like me 
I get the feeling you're a lot like me
