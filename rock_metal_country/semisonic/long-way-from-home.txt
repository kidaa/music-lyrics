Well the one man band is on his way again
After all the leaves have turned
And a long way around it is his only friend
After all his bridges have burned

He says bye, bye, baby bye bye
Now he's going away for good
Bye, bye, baby bye bye
Better do like you should
Yeah, you better be good now

There's a lot more sugar and a lot less snow
In the places where he needs to go
There's a long, long list of everywhere but home
And that's exactly where he's dying to roam

He says bye, bye, baby bye bye
Yes he's going away for good
Bye, bye, baby bye bye
Better do like you should
Everybody be good now

Bye, bye, baby bye bye
Yes he's going away for good
A long way from home
A long way from home
A long way from home
A long way from home

He says bye, bye, baby bye bye
Yes he's going away for good
Bye, bye, baby bye bye
Better do like you should
Yeah you better be good now

Bye, bye, baby bye bye
Yes he's going a way for good
Bye, bye, baby bye bye
Better do like you should
Everybody be good now

Bye, bye, baby bye bye
Yes he's going a way for good
A long way from home
A long way from home
A long way from home
A long way from home
