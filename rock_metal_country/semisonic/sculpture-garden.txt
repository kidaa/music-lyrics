Twilight in the sculpture garden
When we walk around the place
Look upon the beautiful secrets
That all the artists' made.

How fast the light has faded
And we still wanna stay
Turn down the noise in the city
The dark downtown parade.

At night they turn the water on around the artworks
In the garden, In the garden.

Midnight in the sculpture garden
Underneath the cherry moon
We can make our own beautiful secret
We can join the fabled few.

Starlight in the sculpture garden
With a stainless steel balloons
Rose petal vermillion breezes
I beieve the artists knew.

At night they turn the water on around the artworks
In the garden, In the garden
