If you're afraid to cry
Though you could use it once in awhile
Nothing will cloud your eyes
You've been through one of those times
When nothing's real or getting through
And it seems like you've forgotten how to feel
Call me
I'll Feel
For you
And some days you'll feel for me too

If you're afraid to smile
Though you could use it just to survive
There's nowhere you want to drive
And you're only staying alive
'Cause it's the thing to do
And it seems your bell's forgotten how to ring
Call me
I'll Feel
For you
And some days you'll feel for me too

If you're afraid to cry
Though you could use it just to survive
There's nowhere you want to drive
And you're only staying alive
'Cause it's the thing to do
And it seems your mouth's forgotten how to sing
Call me
Yeah
Call me
Call me
I'll Feel
For you
And some days you'll feel for me too
