Give me one day give me two day
I want a year near wherever you're going
Give me one touch give me two i
It's just too much to wait and watch you glowing
I know I said you were free to roam
But I just want to take you home
Yeah, my cup overflows but I wanted an ocean

Hold on baby
Just one more thing
You should know before you go
Maybe tonight

Yeah I said I'd be satisfied to stand in the light of your fire
I'm a liar

Give me one step give me two steps g
Give me a mile in the right direction
Give me one try keep it up try g
Give me a sign you'll be my pretty connection
And I supposed to be thankful
Every minute is a miracle
I admit it I wanted you for a lifetime perfection

Hold on baby
I've been fakin
Nearly breakin
Make it alright

I know I said one look in your eyes is the end of my love's desire
I know I said just to see your face is the only thing I require
I'm a liar
I'm a liar

Hold on baby
You're my higher
Power and pacifier
Save me tonight

I know I promised to be satisfied to stand in the light of your fire
I know I said one look in your eyes is the end of my love's desire
I know I said just to see your face is the only thing I require
I'm a liar
I'm a liar
I'm a liar
