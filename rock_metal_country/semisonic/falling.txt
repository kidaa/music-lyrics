High above the midway lights
High above the rides
You, me and the sky
The whole world looks small tonight
And you said we could never really fly

If you're right and we're nothing at all
Tell me, why did I keep thinkin' 'bout your calling
If you're right and we're nothing at all
Tell me, why do you keep thinkin' that your falling

Swayin', sighin' at the skywheel top
Then you say that I could never make you mine
The lights, springs, constellations will turn and stop
Kiss me once again and change your mind
