You're delicious
When you call me
I've got nothing left to wait for
You're delicious when you see me
I've got nothing left to pray for

Woo-hoo, woo-hoo
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

You're delicious
Come and feed me
I've got nothing left to cry for
You're delicious
Oh you sweet thing
You've got something I should open wide for

I would give my one last chance to you
Never to waste it
I would give my one last kiss to you
If you told me that you wanted to taste it

You're delicious
When you call me
I've got nothing left to sigh for
You're delicious
When you save me
I've got nothing left to die for
