Time, you needed time out of the mainstream 
Out on your only 
Alone to find yourself somehow 

So I'm a bit surprised to see you lately 
Beside a brand new baby 
But if it makes you happy now 

I guess that's great 
I guess you're not mine 
Brand new baby beside you now, oh yeah 

I guess that's great 
You don't see me cryin' 
And there's nobody to slow you down, oh yeah 

If you're feeling sorry, try to contain it 
You don't need to save me 
Don't waste your pity anyhow 

And you might like to believe I'm devastated 
To see you with your brand new baby 
Well if it makes you happy now I guess that's great 
I guess you're not mine 
Brand new baby beside you now, oh yeah 

I guess that's great 
You don't see me cryin' 
And there's nobody to slow you down 

Seen you with your brand new baby 
Sure it fazes me just to hear you laughing 
Makes me just a little crazy but I guess it's a great thing 
If it makes you happy now.
