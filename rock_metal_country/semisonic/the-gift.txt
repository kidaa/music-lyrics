It's a hurting desire strong and sweet
Memory so pretty I can hardly say
You thought I was sleeping as you walked to the street
You gave what you wanted then you went away.

Did you mean what you did
Would you give it again
What you gave as a gift, a gift

I went on a mission to the town where you lived
Dark, dusty places you've not seen in a while
I want to seek the basements where you hid
I want to see your face as a little child.

Did you mean what you did
Would you give it again
What you gave as a gift, a gift

Did you mean what you did
Could you give it again, ever again
What you gave as a gift, a gift
