Last night I dreamed of falling
Down a wishing well.
No one could hear me calling
From where I fell.

And from above the ground
I could faintly hear
The world and all her sounds
Songs, vows, playgrounds, tears.

I fell in a wishing well
Now the damage is done
And who, who have I become

Not even angels saw me
From tall starry skies.
And then a searchlight shone upon me
Bright in my eyes.

For all this time I prayed
You might come around.
Now stranger I'm afraid
I might call you down.

I fell in a wishing well
Now the damage is done
And who, who have I become

I'm through with my dream come true.
Then it's just begun
And who, who have I become

Opened my eyes and woke up twice this morning
Lately getting up has only got me down.
Maybe there's a place where I can live again
Never leave the ground.

I fell in a wishing well
Now the damage is done
Now the damage is done
And who, who have I become

I'm through with my dream come true
And it's just begun.
Who, who have I become
