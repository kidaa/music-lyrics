DND
Now they'll leave us alone
DND
Now you turn off the phone

How like you to make the whole world disappear and
How like you to make everything seem so clear and
How like you to make me wanna stay forever
Here, behind your door

DND
And the sign on the door
DND
Don't disturb us no more

How like you to make your love my hideaway and
How like you to make my troubles slide away and
How like you to make me wanna play forever
Here, behind your door

Minute, I got some space and time
I want it to get me back in the crowd
Minute, I got some peace
You found me trying to make my way to the loud
What a clown

DND
Leave the hotel at noon
DND
Will I see you soon

DND, DND, DND
Now they'll leave us alone
