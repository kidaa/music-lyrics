I was talking with a friend of mine
And it seemed like I was alright
When a feeling shook me by surprise
Rising, rising
From the bottom of a lake

So my friend says "What is wrong with you?"
But a fear has caught my words inside
And the tears come up to fill my eyes
Rising, rising
From the bottom of a lake

I'm afraid
I'll never get over what you
Took me through

Yeah, the moment passes in a while
And the feeling spreads and dissipates
And my friend and I attempt to smile
Rising, rising
From the bottom of a lake
Rising, rising
From the bottom of a lake
Rising, rising
From the bottom of a lake

I'm afraid
I'll never get over what you
Took me through

Rising, rising
From the bottom of a lake
Rising, rising
From the bottom of a lake
Rising, rising
From the bottom of a lake
