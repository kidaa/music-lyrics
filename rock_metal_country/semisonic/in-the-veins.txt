Red is the ocean which we ride
Carried along on a changing tide
Blind, blind rage and pure delight
Running in the current side by side
Waiting for whatever we haven't tried

Baby it's amazing all the tings a self contains!

Peace is in the veins, in the veins!
Be careful what you put in there
Be careful what you put in there

Heaven transcendence agels fly
Anger and vengence, blue, blue sky oh!
All injected from the mind
Down in the liquid world combined
And your prescription has been signed!

Search the wild green outside and inside is what remains.
Peace is in the veins, in the veins!
Be careful what you put in there
Be careful what you put in there

Wide open world there is no mind without you
And a little bit is not enough

Wide open mind divine world about you
And a little bit is not enough
And a little bit is not enough

Baby it's amazing all the things a self contains.
Peace is in the veins, in the veins
Peace is in the veins, in the veins
Be careful what you put in there
Be careful what you put in there

In the veins!
