All my life I've been looking for
The perfect mate
And when I finally found the one
It was almost too late
Underneath the auditorium
She showed me why
I would have waited all of my life
For somebody like

Sunshine and chocolate all over me
In my mouth and on my tree
Round my body under my hat
Sunshine and chocolate just... like... that

I was alone when I woke up
And found the note
It said you surely know how to fuck
But I gotta go
I hope you find someone to take care of
And give yourself to
And until I get to kiss you again I wish you

Sunshine and chocolate every day
In your work and in your play
In your mouth and down your back
I wish you, I wish you, I wish you that
Sunshine and chocolate all over you
Over everything you do
On your body and in your mind
Sunshine, chocolate, everything fine

Now my eyes are open wide
As I travel around
Maybe some summer day I'll find
Her face in the crowd singing...

Sunshine and chocolate everyday
In your work and in your play
In your mouth and down your back
I wish you, I wish you, I wish you that
Sunshine and chocolate all over you
Over everything you do
On your body and in your mind
Sunshine, chocolate, everything fine
