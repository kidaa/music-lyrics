Our little secret just might be the kind of thing that you can't hide
It's growing like a tangled vine  amp; rising like a river in the tide
And everybody knew when you walked into the room
I was just a fool for you, nothing I could do
Everybody sees you taking control of me
Well I'm not begging for release
I'm just begging darling please, please

Act Naturally
Don't let our troubles show
Don't let anybody know
Till we get it figured out
Don't give them anything that they could doubt

Our little problem doesn't seem to be about to go away
As far as I can tell it's gonna keep on showing more with every day
And everybody look, yeah, that was all it took
I can't help believing they can read me like a book
So hide your feelings tight till we figure how to make it right
I don't know what I should but I
Would do it if I could

Act Naturally
Just be you beautiful
Just be you casual
I'll be me before the fall
You be you before this all came down
Act Naturally
