Over mountains, that's where my love lives
A long, long ride to sunland here where I did this

Across the great divide alone wondering open afraid and
Arriving alive unknown unknown unwise and unaided

If I could I might
Send my love on a plane ride
A black cross high in a blue sky
A green cross gliding on a million pines

Across the great divide alone wondering open afraid and,
Arrive in a life unknown unknown unwise and unaided

Across the great divide alone wondering open afraid and
Try to find a life unknown unknown unwise and unaided
