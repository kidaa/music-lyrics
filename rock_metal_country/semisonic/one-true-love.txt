All above me the stars are bright
And a sweet suburban breeze is blowing
And down the block are the parking lights
Of a hundred friends who I barely know and
Don't know me
Don't know me
None of them know me

And all through the party I want to leave
All alone with one true love
I could be happy if I could be
In the dark with one true love

And in the middle of everyone
I still find myself with my thoughts alone
And in the middle of all the noise
Look around myself at the shining toys that
I don't need
I don't need
I don't really need

And all through the party I want to leave
All alone with one true love
All of the lights are shining on me
But all I want is one true love

In this world I can see
Many billions waiting in the sun
So I'd love to believe
There'd be one of us for everyone
One of us for everyone
Enough to go around
But that's not what I've found

And all through the party I want to leave
All alone with one true love
All of the lights are shining on me
All I want is one true love
All of my life I've just wanted to be
All alone with one true love
Every day and night to be on my own with
One true love
With one true love
With one true love
With one true love
With one true love
