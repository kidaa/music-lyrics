In the morning of the first night of my life
I was feeling like I'd lost my inspiration
Then in the afternoon she walked into the light
To relieve me of my doubt and desperation

She's not coming here to make herself a name
She only wants to play with me to see if she can win
And we both want it to happen

None down in the bottom of the ninth with three men on
And she saw me like nobody's ever done before
Now in the glory of victorious dominion
She's receding in the sunshine down the corridor

She's not in it for the money or the fame
She only came to play with me to see what place I'm in
And we both know who's gonna give in

For the love of the game
Sometimes you've gotta cry a little
For the love of the game
Maybe even gotta die a little
For the love of the game
I made a sacrifice I never thought I'd have to make

For the love of the game
Sometimes you've gotta cry a little
For the love of the game
Maybe even gotta die a little
For the love of the game
I made a sacrifice I never thought I'd have to make I made a sacrifice...

Sometimes you've gotta cry a little
For the love of the game
Maybe even gotta die a little
For the love of the game
I made a sacrifice I never thought I'd have to make
