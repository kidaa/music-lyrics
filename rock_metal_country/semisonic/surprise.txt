I feel the day is arriving soon
When I can't stay around anymore
They'll look in all the familiar rooms
Until they feel the breeze through the door

Then they can say it's the company that I keep
So they never have to believe in the tears I weep

I'm gonna surprise them all
When they look and I'm gone, gone, gone
I'm gonna surprise them all
Because I've already moved along

You can stay if you have to do
It's got to be your own decision
But someday I will be back for you
And then you better not refuse me again

Cos one more chance is all I'll promise to provide
And circumstances choose for those who can't decide

I'm gonna surprise them all
When they look and I'm gone, gone, gone
I'm gonna surprise them all
Because I've already moved along
Already moved along

I'm gonna surprise them all
When they look and I'm gone, gone, gone
I'm gonna surprise them all
Because I've already moved along
Already moved along
