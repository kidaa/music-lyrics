Out in the land where my dreams flew around
I bulldozed the trees and set my feet on the ground
Put a day in and a week would come out
I didn't have time for doubt

Then when the whole thing went down the drain
I learned that the future don't always obey
Now I'm afraid to get back in the pool
Somehow I'd feel like a fool

Making a Plan
Making a Plan

High in the morning with climbing to do
High in the turrets I'm thinking of you
Everybody says it's all for the best
Somehow I wouldn't have guessed

Little dominions turn into dust
Schemes blow away on a breeze of mistrust
I'm not feeling sorry for little ol' me
But I'm not about to be

Making a Plan
Making a Plan

Stop, you work your way up til you drop
Down down until your ears go pop
What were we gonna do at the top?
I forgot

Now I can sit and watch the time fly
And I'll feel better when time has gone by
And I'll never again be blindsided by fate
The future will have to wait
I only have time for today
As long as I can delay

Making a Plan
A Plan
Making a Plan
A Plan
