Morning comes, and morning goes
Now it's me against the sun
The day goes by, darkness grows
And it's over before it's done

Well I know it'll be alright if I just get on the road
If I run I can free my worried mind
Yeah, I know that the day I die I will lose my heavy load
But I wouldn't want to leave you behind

All my time keeps creepin' on
Now I've grown into a man
Mister Child still wants to run
From the cradle to the van

Keep thinkin' it'll be alright if I just get on the road
If I run I can free my worried mind
Keep thinkin' of the day I die when I lose my heavy load
But I wouldn't want to leave you behind
