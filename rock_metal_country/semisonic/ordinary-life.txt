Well I looked for the life fantastic 
Cos I read it in a magazine 
What I got was myself as a plastic figurine 

And the happily ever after 
I traded everything to see 
Now my scene is the snow on a static TV screen 

Lord I can dream of an ordinary life 
Where nothing particularly weird is going down 
Lord I can dream of an ordinary time 
Where nothing particularly hard is spinning us around 

Well now read me a bedtime story 
And be sure that it's nice and sweet 
Cos I don't think I can take any more reality 

With a peacefully ever after 
For me and my little treat 
And I don't want nobody saying "We'll wait and see" 

Lord I can dream of an ordinary life 
Where nothing particularly weird is going down 
Lord I can dream of an ordinary time 
Where nothing particularly hard is spinning us around
