Take all that you've got
Multiply by zero
Divide by the time you've got left
That's x

Add it up write it down tell me what you've found

We're speaking in tongues
Both of us dumbfounded
Our brains have been impounded by our hearts

Life is so uncertain
Look at all the hurting that we've done
You said you had somebody better to become

Who's stopping you
Who's stopping you
Who's stopping you
Who's stopping you

We're wasting our time
Watching our old reruns
Waiting for the good one that never comes

You say it beats working
On the emptiness that's lurking inside your head
Step into the light my friend

Who's stopping you 4x

You said you had somebody better to become

Who's stopping you 8x
