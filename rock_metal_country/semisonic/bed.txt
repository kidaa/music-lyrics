My little darling it's a crying shame 
The way that you lead me on 
And I've got nobody but myself to blame 
Cause I've always just played along 

Well show me a body that gets no love 
And I'll show you a body that's way messed up 
Well it seems like you're aware of the effect you have on my head 

If you feel like I'm asking you for too much 
We can keep in touch 
And I'll find someone else to bed 
Bed 
Find some 
Find someone else to bed 

My little darling I'm a tangled mess 
When you tease me the way you do 
  what it would be like I can only guess 
If you'd please me like I wanna please you 

Well show me a friendship that's pure and chaste 
And I'll show you and engine that's dying to race 
Well the time has come for me to find 
Another way to get my soul fed 

I know we could be the sweetest friends 
But if that's where it ends 
Then I'll find someone else to bed 
Bed 
Find some 
Find someone else to bed 
Bed 
Find some 
Find someone else to bed 

Well the time has come for me 
To take care of myself instead 
You know if we remain 
On a spiritual plane I will go insane 
Don't make me find someone else to bed 
Bed 
Find someone 
Find someone else to bed
