I wandered in the moonlight
A ghost without a friend
All around the starlight found are lost and wounded men.
I know that I did some damage
I wanted to be home again
So I waited for a star my soul to mend
I waited for a star my soul to mend.

She came a long way to love me
And I'm tasting her spark
She came a long way to kiss me
Now my lips are wet
I know that I don't deserve it
But I want to hear her sigh
And I want to stay here forever in her light
I want to stay forever in her light.

Star you're a beautiful sight
Bring me you lovely light
I'll be a satellite, satellite.
Star you're a beautiful sight
Bring me you lovely light
I'll be a satellite, satellite.

And there's a dark crater space in heaven
And I might want you to shine
And there's a bright little place in my head
And darkness blows my mind
I can lie on my back and wonder
Why I've been treated so fine
And make love to her while we have tonight
I'll make love to her while we have tonight.

Star you're a beautiful sight
Bring me you lovely light
I'll be a satellite, satellite.
Star you're a beautiful sight
Bring me you lovely light
I'll be a satellite, satellite.
I'll be a satellite, satellite,
I'll be a satellite, satellite
