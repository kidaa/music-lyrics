You're the movie star of my innerspace
Come to town awhile, bring your quite place
Show me how it's done with a wave of your hand
I'm destroyed and recreated

No one else
Can make me cry
Like you, you, love

You're the only one who did everything right
Come to play with me, come to change my mind
Sleepy valium, low red light in the wire
I've been thinking about the one you left behind

No one else
Can make me cry
Like you, you, love

Laughing, lost her way
She caught a train to far points north
And left the phone bill on the table in the sun
She had enough of her old self
Same face, same space
She wanted wider fields where she could run

Come on then, time is getting late
Show me how you make it alright

No one else
Can make me cry
Like you, you, love
No one else
Can make me fly, keep me high
Shine light inside, make me cry
Like you, you, love
