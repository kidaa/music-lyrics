Made to last awhile, and roll on
Made to move in style, and move along
Made to dream of flying so high
Made to wake up crying, I don't know why

Beautiful one, sleep in the sun
Secret, sweet, and sublime
I hope you last a long, long time
I hope you last a long, long time

Made to come alone and pair off
Flash like a rolling stone, seventy-one
One-time love affair with the earth
Waiting on the air for some rebirth, for what it's worth

Wherever you are, nearby or far
Black, white, lemon or lime
I hope you last a long, long time
I hope you last a long, long time
