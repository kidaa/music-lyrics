I went to see temptation yesterday
In a four-plex out on the old high drive
Cuz something in my life was run away
Or maybe to prove that I am still alive
Temptation lives alone and she works all day
So I waited after five on her front porch
She arrived, parked her car, then she walked my way
She smiled to see me standing at her door

Tell me now how pleasure can be a sin
She turned the key in the lock and let me in
Ah, ah, ah
Temptation showed me what I shouldn't do
Ah, ah, ah
Temptation showed me what I shouldn't do

Somewhere in the world tonight
Two lovers are treating each other right
Somewhere else in a lonely town
One lover waits and endless hour
Yeah

Driving home in the dark, I say this time will be the last
I know what I should never do
At least I'll keep Temptation's photograph
Maybe hang on to her phone number too

Tell me now how pleasure can be a sin
Well, I don' t plan to tell anyone where I've been
Ah, ah, ah
Temptation showed me what I shouldn't do
Ah, ah, ah
Temptation showed me what I shouldn't do
