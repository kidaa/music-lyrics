I would sure love believing
In something that's never leaving
Would like to let go the hurting
When everything's so uncertain

You know I tried
To show you what I have inside
Will we laugh at how this all began
When you're an old woman and I'm an old man

Take me wherever you go
Help me forget tomorrow
Love me your best and I know
All of the rest will follow
Love me as well as you know
And everything else will follow

I wouldn't mind pretending
It's something that's never-ending
Would like to believe that someday
We won't be living this way

I know you tried
To show me you were on my side
Could it be that I've already found
The thing that I've been searching the whole world round

Take me wherever you go
Help me forget tomorrow
Love me your best and I know
All of the rest will follow
Love me your best and I know
Everything else will follow

Take me wherever you go
All of the rest will follow
Help me forget tomorrow
All of the rest will follow
Love me as well as you know
