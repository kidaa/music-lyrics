Early one morning while making my rounds 
I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my baby down
I shot her down and then I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' Forty-four beneath my head

Late the next morning I grabbed my gun
I took a shot of cocaine and away I run
I made a good run, but I run too slow
They overtook me down is Juarez, Mexico

I was in the hot joint takin the pill
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said ";Willy Lee, your name is not Jack Brown.
";You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down.";

Yes, so my name is Willy Lee
If you got a warrant you better read it to me
I shot her down cause she made me sore
I thought I was her daddy, but she had five more

When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They stuck me on a freight train and they hauled me back
I had no friend to throw my bail
So they stuck my dried up carcas in the county jail

The next morning bout half past nine
I saw a sheriff walking down the line
The sheriff said as he cleared his throat
";Comon you dirty hack into the district court.";

The next morning my trial began
Where I was judged by twelve honest men
And as the jury started walking out
I saw that little judge commence to look about

In bout five minutes in walked a man 
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict said in the first degree
I cried, Oh lord, please have mercy on me

The judge smiled as he picked up his pen
";Ninety nine years in the San Quentin Penn!";
Ninety nine years underneath that ground
I wont forget the day I shot that bad bitch down

Comon you hotheads listen up to me
Stay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be...
