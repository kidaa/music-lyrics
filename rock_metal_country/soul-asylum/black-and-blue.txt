Protect and serve, slice my nerve
Gotta make sure everybody's gonna get what they deserve

Make my plea, I'm down on my knees
Street cowboy with a badge that says can do what you please
Do what you please, do what you please, do what you please

Rape me, take me, shine your lights so I can't see
Holsters, guns and uniform just don't impress

Blood stained streets, he still looks neat
Somebody's cryin' for help and he's breaking up my party

Please stop breathing down my neck
Took away something that's mine, I want you to give it back
You gotta give it back, now give it back
Walk across my face with your shiny shoes
Bow down to the badge and colors black and blue

It's a blue night, he rides tonight, a show of strength, a polished fight
Take me home, cuz I'm not alone, I'm not alone

The squads breakin' down, but you misjudged power
Get your handcuffs ready, cuz we're coming in numbers
