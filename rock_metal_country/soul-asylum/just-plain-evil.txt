You sold your soul for a lump of coal
She's blacker than the night
Didn't think you'd be needing it
But you thought ??

But you never know who you might meet
On the street where the church bells ring to a different beat

Is it joy, is it pain?
Is it rustin' in the rain?
Do you really think I need it?
Is it just plain evil?

Heard of a man who had a plan
To save the wretched world
Nationwide genocide
??

Like one-eyed jacks
And suicide queens
Look out for ?? if you know what I mean

Is it good, is it bad?
Is it bitter, is it sad?
Is it inside all these people?
Is it just plain evil?

You've got a lot to learn
You've got a lot to change
You've got nothing to lose
But a ball and chain

Is it good, is it bad?
Is it bitter, is it sad?
Do you really think I need it?
Is it just plain evil?
