Why can't you say you'll talk to me
You're already thinking about someone else.
When he comes home you'll be in his arms and I'll be gone
But you know my day will come I know someday I'll be the only one
So now you wait for a spark you know it will turn you on
He's gonna make you feel the way you want to feel
When he starts to lie when he makes you cry.
You know I'll be there my day will come I know someday I'll be the only one
My day will come. I know someday I'll be the only one
Call me selfish call me what you'd like. You think it's right
To want someone for all your own and not to share her love
If I have my way you won't have a say anyway
But I've got to you don't stand a chance
So now you wait for a spark you know it will turn you on
he's gonna make you feel the way you want to feel.
When he starts to lie when he makes you cry
you know I'll be there my day will come I know someday
I'll be the only one. My day will come. I know someday I'll
Be the only one
Now you want perfection to your self-destruction
You don't know what you want it's gonna take you years to find out
I'm not giving up when you've had enough you take your
Bruised head and come running back to me you know that I'm gonna
Be the only one.
