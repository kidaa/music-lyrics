I want to live with you in the fifth dimension
In a dream I've never had
Cause I just can't live like this in a world like this
I just want a kiss goodbye

And we are not of this world
And there's a place for us
Stuck inside this fleeting moment
Tucked away where no one own it
Wrapped up in a haste and by mistake got thrown away

And oh, I am so homesick
But it ain't that bad
Cause I'm homesick for the home I've never had

And though I sometimes get annoyed I know just where I'm at
This is my song of joy
And now I know there are no secret trick, no correct politics
Just liars and lunatics

And we are not of this world
And there's a place for us
Stuck inside this fleeting moment
Tucked away where no one own it
Wrapped up in a haste and by mistake got thrown away

And oh, I am so homesick
But it ain't that bad
Cause I'm homesick for the home I've never had

And though I would not take it personally, it's just the child in me
I never really knew how much I had

Woe is me, I am so homesick
But it ain't that bad
Cause I'm homesick for the home I've never had
