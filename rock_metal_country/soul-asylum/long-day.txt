Mine is a lonely one, I forgot to have fun, standing under the street light
Ever so nervously, people lookin' down on me, telling me it's all right

If it were up to me I'd tear down this whole city, what's all this sh*t here for?
I give you my heart, but you just say I make you feel like a whore

All this trouble just to die, all this trouble's only temporary, it's temporary, temporary

Took away his power but he hides a tiny flower in the corner of his jail cell
Never been outside he just can't hide, he'd just assume be in hell

Get off the f*cking telephone, why'd you hate to be alone, paranoid of death and love
Ever so patiently we sit upon our sinking ship waiting for the black dove

All this trouble just to die, all this trouble's only temporary, it's temporary, temporary

Sad that I could make it, glad that I could fake, sorry but I got to go
I ain't afraid of cryin', ain't afraid of dyin'. ain't afraid of what I don't know
