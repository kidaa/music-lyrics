A sweet scent of discontent rising in the air
You don't get old you just get passive and then you stand and stare
Hey nobody's keeping you from stopping 
Like a bulb without a socket your finger trigger's itching but you forgot to cock it

And things didn't turn out the way you thought they would be
No you can't take that out on me
If you can find a better way then I ain't standing in your way 

I'm fed up with holding out I called your bluff now let it out
You were thinking you were never never never enough it ain't bad luck it's just that you ain't that tough

Ain't that tough ain't that tough

A graveyard of bottles and a ??
If you're so brave why's a .45 hang from your hips
Nobody's keeping you from stopping
You're always threatening to kill yourself well why don't you just do it right here, right now

I didn't turn out the way you thought I would be
No you can't take that out on me
I thought I was talking to someone else I guess I was talking to myself

I'm fed up with holding out I called your bluff now let it out
You were thinking you were never never never enough it ain't bad luck it's just you ain't that tough

Last time I saw you you were talking just like me
Now you're talking like some hollywood actress, what the hell's that supposed to mean?

You ain't that tough you ain't that tough ...
