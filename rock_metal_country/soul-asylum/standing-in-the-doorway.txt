Standing in the doorway
Wondering if it's safe to go outside
Wondering if I'll come back
Wondering if I might just drift out with the rising tide
Sitting and waiting and hoping to find
Something you're good at to use up your time
To crawl from the ocean and lie on the shore
A moonbeam the rests on the dust on your floor

I'm not going out there
Don't try to tell me I'm paranoid
Wouldn't say I'm not scared
Though it may be safe to say that I am annoyed
In the intersection traffic lights are red in all directions
Everyone breaks the law sometimes
We all break down have foolish pride and
Beg for some affection
I can't say I know how you feel everyone seems to know
Are you sure I would if I could help you remember
What it's like to feel good
Chitter and chatter and everything matters
I ask how you're feeling
And you just act shattered
Asleep on the couch with your eyes open wide

Standing in the doorway
Waiting as you come and as you leave
You say get out of my way
Won't you stop and talk about the hectic life you lead
They're all going somewhere
They all have some place they have to be
Maybe I should join them
I wish I could I think I have to stay here with me
It brings a tear to your eye to get out into the open
I can't believe I see myself
Coming into focus
