Well, well, now what the hell has gotten into you
Is it something we can make it through
I'll spend the rest of my life trying to figure you out
Like a black silhouette in a shadow of doubt
Some kinda spectacle that no one can see through

But it burns inside, you hide it well
You hide it from yourself
And you promise that you won't tell
Promise that you won't tell
Promise that you won't tell
Promise that you won't yell
Secret no more, secret no more

Now I know that something's wrong
And I'll find out before too long
Only you can break my solitude
Don't you tell anyone I told you this
?? and then they kiss
We got to die to spread your disease tooBut it burns inside, you hide it well
You hide and ??
And you promise that you won't tell
Promise that you won't tell
Promise that you won't tell
Promise that you won't yell
Secret no more, secret no more

Promise that you won't tell x3
Promise that you won't yell
Secret no more, secret no more x2
