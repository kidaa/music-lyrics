My friend's wife, she plays the game
Plays it with me all the time
Makes me feel pretty good, I guess
Hey that's a pretty dress

But you shouldn't have
No, you shouldn't have
Let me know
No you shouldn't have
Really shouldn't have
Let it show

Play with me, don't play with me
Don't play
Play with me, don't play with me
Don't play
Don't you wanna play the game

If I were a renegade
And you were the county line
Will I have to cross it now
I got yours and you got mineBut you shouldn't have
No, you shouldn't have
Let it go

Play with me, don't play with me
Don't play
Play with me, don't play with me
Don't play
Don't you wanna play the game

Jealousy is just a game
It ties you up and wraps around your brain
Makes you feel like you might hurt yourself
Makes you feel insane

Play with me, don't play with me
Don't play
Play with me, don't play with me
Don't play
Don't you wanna play the game
