When aid? turned sideways
And? It'd? head on down the highway
Say this is my way
Disappearing forever

But there ain't just one way
So you choose the fun way
Slide down the runway?
On a ticket that goes two ways

And by the way that it sounded
You thought that you'd be astounded
But you left it like you found it
Cause it wasn't yours to takeWhat once seemed like dying
Soon turned into flying
So you settle for trying
And you wish you were grounded

No you cannot get much higher
Than your utmost desire
So you bring it down to size and
Now it seems that you are grounded

By the way that it sounded
You thought that you'd be astounded
But you left it like you found it
Now you find that you are grounded
