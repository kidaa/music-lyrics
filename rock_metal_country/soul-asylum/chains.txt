The mirror on the wall it tells no lies
And oh I don't like what I see
I see a woman there I watch her as she cries
And the woman isn't really me

But every day I get up, calm down, give up, hang around
Look for you, hold me, tender, set me free
I need to feel you put your hands around me
Day in, day out it's the same old story

You're out there on your own
Is he worth the price you pay
Got you in his chains
Will he set you free someday

I wish I didn't feel this way I can't get nothing done
And all I want to do is go to sleep
Though I lie in bed for hours I cannot close my eyes
And lonely days turn into lonely weeks

But every day I get up, calm down, give up, hang around
Look for you, tender, hold me, set me free
I need to feel you put your hands around me
Day in, day out, it's the same old storyYou're out there on your own
Is he worth the price you pay
Got you in his chains
Will he set you free someday

Every now and then I think things might be all right
And I think I see a light beyond the door
Just as I approach it disappears again
And everything seems darker than before

But every day I get up, calm down, give up, hang around
Look for you, hold me, tender, set me free
I need to feel you put your hands around me
Day in, day out, it's the same old story

You're out there on your own
Is he worth the price you pay
Got you in his chains
Will he set you free someday
