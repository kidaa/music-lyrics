When I'm with my friends my troubles end
I'm one of the boys, so self employed

When we're together, could last forever
And I'm almost there

I'm away from the boss, at least for awhile
I'm away from the girls that cramp my style

I'm away from the jerks, I'm away from the works
And I'm almost there, I'm almost thereAnd it's happy time, happy, happy time
It's happy time, happy time, happy time
Got a happy head, so happy, happy time
I wish I could be this happy all the time

I'll take one of those, and four of those
And more of those, and more of those

I'm away from the jerks, I'm away from the works
And I'm almost there, I'm almost there
