At the end of the track is a two bit shack
When you die, that's where you go
Down the lines, up from this pit at the end of your rainbow

That's one too many flights of stairs
One more stair and almost there?
One more dose close
One more step to the bottom of the stairs
One more unholy ghost

Keep coming back to haunt you,
Got no place left to go
Meet me on the ??
And they'll strip your car to the bone

We did a scene, checked out a gown
The Justice started laughing
";??, remove their heads";
I guess that's what you get for laughing

One last laugh and lived to tell
One more pomp and circumstance
One more fool to follow
Another finger down my throat
It's a bitter pill to swallow

So much later coming
It's moving much too slow
Who it is asleep at the wheel
I don't want to know

Just around the corner there's
Somebody there to take you there
Don't worry child you're sure to be scared

One more drink before I go
One last good luck kiss
One less thing to call my own
That's one more thing I miss

??
Took the world by storm
Most of 'em either in a dark jail
Or wishing they had never been born

Just around the corner there's
One more pomp and circumstance
One more fool to follow
Another finger down my throat
That's a bitter pill to swallow
