I guess I'll see you later
Sweet manipulator
And how I thank you dearly
For helping me see clearly

Yes sir no sir let me go 
Sir I don't even want to know
Sir I've had all that I can take today

But I found out so long ago
It don't matter if it shows
And it's up in the air tonight
Yes it's up in the air tonight

Now you're anticipating
That nostalgia's waiting
With your social statement
Boxed up in the basementYes ma'am no ma'am let me go ma'am
I don't even give a damn
Ma'am I suppose I'll stand another day

I booked my flight despite my plans
I hope this flight it never lands
And it's up in the air tonight
Yes it's up in the air tonight

Cause i've got all night
To lie here on the floor
I got all night
Just like the night before
So make it soon
And I guess I'll see you later
I guess I'll see you later
I guess I'll see you later
I guess I'll see you later
We're so up in the air tonight
