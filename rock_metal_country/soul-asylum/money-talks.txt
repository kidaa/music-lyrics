Money talks these days and everybody listens
We're whipping out our wallets trying to but what we're missing

Money screams out ";I need a slave";
I'm just trying to find some worker to dig my grave

Everybody's listening, everybody's listening, all those eyes are glistening
I need more, a little more, in a little while

I say those???
Machines?

I'm just trying to find somebody to pay my bail
Money screams is says ";My soul's for sale";

Everybody's listening, everybody's listening, all those eyes are glistening

I need a maid to pick up my mess, help me in the morning, help me get dressed
I'll pay you when I get paid, I'll pay you when I get paid

Money talks these days, money talks these days
What you gonna do when the criminal says ";Your money or your life";?
Not used?
I need more, I'm bored, shine my shoes, wax my floor

Mew father of our powerful land of the free
I ain't doing nothing, I'll just jire someone to do it for me

No matter how small George gets he'll still talk louder than you
Dollars shrieking ";Ha, ha, ha jokes's on you";

End everybody's listening, all those eyes are glistening

Rich bored, blind, and lone, better buy me a wife
I'm saving up everything to buy me a knife
