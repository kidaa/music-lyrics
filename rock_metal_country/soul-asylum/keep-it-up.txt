I'm down here waitin' on a shattered heart
I'm gonna put it back together if it tears me apart
If I can keep it up
If I can keep it up
I've been complaining like a broken record
Gonna get what I want if it takes forever
If I can keep it up
If I can keep it up

Though the rain weighs down your wings,
Still the caged bird's got to sing

I know it seems funny tryin' to understand
It's just that things don't always go the way you planned
Still you keep it up
Still you keep it up
Nothin' in the world's gonna keep me down
I'm just a-holdin' out, just a-hangin' round
Tryin' to keep it up
Just to keep it up

Though the rain weighs down your wings,
Still the caged bird's got to sing

Keep it up x4

747's gonna take us away
Take us up to heaven, gonna be okay
If we can keep it up
If we can keep it up

Though the rain weighs down your wings,
Still the caged bird's got to sing

Keep it up x8
