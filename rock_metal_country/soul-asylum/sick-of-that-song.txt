I'm sick of that song about how you lost your lover
Sick of that song about how you hate your mother
Sick of that song laced with useless solutions
I'm sick of that song about how you look at life
Sick of that song about how you beat your wife
Sick of that song about sha na blah blah
I'm sick of that song about sex and drugs and rock
Sick of that song about how you love your cock
Sick of that song about your bitchin' bad luck
Sick of that song about all those women you f*ck
I'm sick of that song
