Holed up in the dressing room without a dress
Kneeling at the confessional with nothing to confess
And I knew all about my surprise party
I was spoiled and depressed
Hey I acted surprised and I told lots of lies
Yes I did my best

Stop the truck at the truck stop, I need something to help me crash
Food stamps, checks and credits cards, but they only accepted cash
There was sweat beating on my brow
My heart was beating out of my chest
So I stole everything they couldn't give away
Yes I did my best

And I did the best that I could do
With all the mess that I've been through
What did you expect me to do
I did my best for you

I was waiting for a chain reaction with the missing link
Waiting for that trickle-down forever circling the sink
I was tired of being tired
I could not get no rest
So I kept sleep-walking and talking in my sleep
Yes I did my best

And I did the best that I could do
With all the mess that I've been through
What did you expect me to do
I did my best for you
