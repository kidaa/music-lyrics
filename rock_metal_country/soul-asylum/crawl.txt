You got me going
So get me out of here
I should be blowin'
In someone else's ear

I'm looking forward to looking back
On days like today
Though I wish you would go away
Stay, won't you stay

I'm gonna crawl
I never felt better just crawling home
I'm gonna crawl home, crawl home alone
Good to see you, see you later, maybe one more beer
I'm gonna crawl home from here

Some respond to pleasure
Some respond to pain
I'm hangin' out to dry
In the pouring rainVictims of temptation
Never can complain
I could use the sensation
You see I can't feel pain

I'm gonna crawl
I never ever said I'd never make it home
It's just a stone's throw, a crawl home
Good to see you, see you later, maybe one more beer
I'm just a crawl home from here

I could use someone
To drag me out of here
I am that someone
It's all become quite clear
So get me out of here

I never felt better just crawling home
I'm gonna crawl home, crawl home alone
Good to see you, see you later, and I'm outta here
I'm just a crawl home from here
