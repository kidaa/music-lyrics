Nothing happened, it's just two people passing through
Hearing voices in my head, hope they never lie to you

Why's something always gotta be up with you
Whatever I do is never enough for someone like you
Passing through you all the time
Turning blood into wine
Turning blood into wine

Who'll forgive me, who's to say if it's right or wrong
And you won't see me in a light that shines on me

And how come something's always gotta be up with you
Back on my feet but the night's getting long, do you think about me too
Turning blood into wine
It's passing through you all the time
Turning blood into wine

Three more days and you'll be hanging on the line
And if they ask you how I'm doing
Just tell 'em that I'm fine

Staying out all the time
Is turning blood into wine
Turning blood into wine
Blood into wine
