It's a second hand story no one wants to hear
And it's wet with blood, salted with tears
It's black and white and red all over
Happens all the time

This was something about an artificial heart

She lived in a sleepy town trailer home park
Where not many people go out after dark
Innocent helpless at 17
Queen of every loser's wet dream

Which brings us to our villain but a mother could love
He liked amputation and the Lord above
He kidnapped her on her way home from school
She lost her mind, he lost his coolShe didn't tell him about the artificial heart

?? then some kid found her head
Then an arm and a leg and you know the rest they said
The artificial heart it was still beating

With a needle and a thread they sewed on her head
She's alive and well like she was never dead
She doesn't remember the day she didn't die
Or how everybody cried

She read a story in the paper how she was victimized
And you should have seen the look in her eyes
Her assailant was acquitted and as she read
I swear she laughed off her head
