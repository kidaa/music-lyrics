She had 13 kids, each one had 13 problems
Three uppers, ten downers, just to put up with this
And she don't know which children belong to which father
But she loves them all anyway and they each get a kiss

And the toilet ain't flushing and the toaster is smoking
The vacuum don't suck but it needs a new belt
But she saw the world through the eyes of a child
And remembers how good it was and how good it felt

He picked up the paper from the bitter cold morning
He had just gone to sleep, he had to get up for work
By morning he's a watchman and by night he's a waiter
In the late afternoon he works as a clerk

And he can't pay the doctor bills, he just can't afford the pills
The car's repossesed and the child support's due
But he saw the world through the eyes of a child
Big problems seem smaller and old things seem new

She was just six when she turned her first trick
Now she's thirteen and it don't make her sick
And she does lots of crystal and she owns her own pistol
Got a goldfish named Silver and a pimp who's named Rick

And some are like customers and some are like patients
She'd have gone back to school if she'd just had the patience
But she saw the world through the eyes of a child
None of the nightmares, and nothing to deny

She saw the world through the eyes of a child
Yes she's seen it all and she knows they're all lies
