Somebody's thinking that there might be something wrong
Business is sinking and the crew's been casted off
Nobody's bailing, nobody's sailing, but we're watching it from shore
Nobody's working and we better work this out

If we could see eye to eye, you could see just exactly who is small
But I do my job and do it well and go to hell for writing on the wall
There'd be enough to go around if I could just get around you
I am not down, my hands are empty, and they're open and I need something to do 

And it makes me wonder who I'm working for
'Cause I think you know just what I'm looking for
And it makes me wonder who you're working for

How many children are waiting by your door?
Is this just a job that I'm working for?

You gave me nothing now you're taking it away
I should be walkin' and makin' it easy to ignore but I guess I'd better stay
And I forgave you for all the people you've done wrong
Nobody's working and it's gone on far too long

And it makes me wonder who you're working for
'Cause I think you know just what I'm looking for
And it makes me wonder who I'm working for
How many children are waiting by your door?

Is it just a paycheck I'm fighting for?
