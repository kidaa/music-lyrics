When you chew my ear off, try and let me know
You will never get another piece of me
Cause in a New York blackout, things go kinda slow
And you miss the things you never thought you'd see

There's still so many things I want to be
Sometimes I just don't even want to sleep

In a New York blackout, it's so hard to see
All the angels that are looking after me

The lies bounce off the water in your eyes
And the dead lift their heads and come alive

And I may never escape this darkened city
But still I'm trying to find you in this blackoutWhere it's warm inside and always open late
And the doors to hell look just like heaven's gate
And you never know what's going on inside
'Til you step out in the cold and seal your fate

And you might just stop in and say hello
But you've got much more important places to go
Make sure you let everybody know

That I may never enlight this darkened city
Still i'm trying to find you in this blackout

In a New York blackout, you might think I'm gone
But I'll wake up on the front steps of your door
