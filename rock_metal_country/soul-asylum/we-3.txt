I was tapping my foot on a Friday night
To my favorite band I was pushed aside
I said ";hey don't push me no one pushes me";
When I was face to face with the woman I admired
And she gave me this look I could not believe
And the cold stare remained; I wanted to leave

See, I do believe anger is offset by sorrow
But you destroy today you might regret tomorrow
When you're young and defensive it comes off offensive
And it's hard to repay the tolerance that you borrowed
The lasting relationship sinks right off the pier
Who wears the pants; it's faded but clear

She's your girlfriend, seems she ain't too fond of me
I guess if that's the way it was meant to be
There we were, just we three
You, your girlfriend, and me

I've known you forever, you two just met
So easily amused; how fast we forget
In my jealously, my self-righteous greed
She's a bit like a book I'm too far sighted to read
And I wish you the best, I sometimes feel the need
To say remember me

She's your girlfriend, as far as we can see
Does she look at you the way she looks at me
And here we are, just we three
You, your girlfriend, and me

She's your girlfriend, it's getting harder to see
Better just take her home, better just let her be
When she walks out that door, you'll come looking for me
