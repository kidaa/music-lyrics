It's enough to make you stay
It's enough to make you go away
But you don't understand how I'm feeling
You don't understand no no

It's enough to make you sick
It's enough to make you wanna quit
But you don't understand how I'm feeling
You don't understand my life
It's sad when you can't cry
It all comes down to time keeps flying by
Time keeps telling me

There's no time for waiting
For the river to wash into the sea
And when I reach some understanding
I'm gonna let it wash all over
Wash all over me

It's too much to make you say
That you always wanted to be this way
But you don't understand this feeling
So why do I even try
It's sad when you can't try
It all comes down to time keeps killing time time keeps healing

I've no time for waiting
For the river to wash into the sea
And when I reach some understanding
I'm gonna let it wash all over
Wash all over me

But I know one day you'll see
The person I wanted to be
And there's no time for waiting
There's no time for waiting

Can't find the time
Can't find the time
There's no time
There's no time
There's no time
Can't find the time
