Jesus was a hippy
Peace and Love was all he was about
That's why they killed him
Sad shit something people can't figure out
Now the same folks who worship him are the ones who would have cheered at the 
Crucifixion
They got no conviction
It doesn't matter if the man was fact or fiction.
Nixon was a liar
It's the one thing believed to be true
But Tricky Dick was not a crook
Whatever that means 
Whatever presidents do
