I'm hung up on a wire so thin,
tearing out what's been trapped in
My puppet strings, been pulled too tight
I can see the real me's going to be a bloody fight
I'm your Voodoo doll don't you hear my call

Trying so hard to forget, got my bottles, got my pills, got my TV set
I'm imprisoned by my passion, i;m a slave to my trade
How can you be so possessed by the profit that's been made

I live for love where love's insane, I need to numb to ease the pain
When the end begins again, needles, needles, I'm sticking them in
I'm your Voodoo doll, heed my call

I'm strung out on pretty, pretty girls, I forgot about the rest of the world
Pots and pans and good free sex my wife she is the best
If I get bored of her I'll have a family and get into incest

I live for love where love's insane, I need to numb to ease the pain
When the end begins again, needles, needles, I'm sticking them in

Think your thoughts, confirm your petty doubts,
The spell is cast in broken glass your time is running out
You're just a prisoner, sweet prisoner, you're just imprisoned by your own devices
Come on out and bleed some blood and solve this f*cking crisis

I live for love where love's insane, I need to numb to ease the pain
When the end begins again, needles, needles, I'm sticking them in
Voodoo doll, don't you hear my call

The big old world doesn't seem so f*cked up when I'm f*cked up too
Voodoo doll, don't you hear my call
