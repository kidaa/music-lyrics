It's a shame you're not here on the cross in my ear
Hearing things loud and clear, come outside have no fear
And clear the smoke, get some fresh air, someone waits, someone cares
In the broad light of day, trouble seems so far away

At the top of the day
When the reign sways

Lose the cradle chain
Give it up, give it a name
The child that remains
Nothing's lost, take these chains
Take them away

Please don't ask me how I am, a little tired, a little scared
I'm not amused, not upset, don't need a leash, I'm not your pet
So loosen up, feel the breeze, let me hear, hear you breathe
It's better than, bitter now, when you breathe I love that sound

But you know I'll look after
You like no one

Lose the cradle chain
Give it up, give it a name
The child that remains
Nothing's lost, take these chains
Take them away

If I die before I wake, light a fuse, bake a cake
I don't mind if I go, make it quick, don't be slow

But you know I'll remember
You like no one

Lose the cradle chain
Give it up, give it a name
The smile that remains
Will take these chains away
