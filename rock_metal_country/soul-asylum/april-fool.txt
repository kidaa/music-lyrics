Quittin' after one more last one
Tired of playin' the clown
If I want your opinion I'll ask ya
I can get myself down

Night driving without headlight
Wearin' sunglasses too
Lookin' good but sure don't feel right
Anything to be cool

Doin' hopscotch with my legs tied
Jumpin' rope in wet cement
Black leather in midday sunshine
All your mother's money's spent

Doin' time on the metal detector
Like to drown in your pool
Coverin' up everything that's defective
Anything to be coolA burning heart could be so cool
Won't you be my fashion victim
Come on, I'm an April Fool for you

Holdin' on to what's left of real life
Anything to be cool x4

A burning heart like an April Fool
Won't you be my fashion victim
Come on, I'm an April Fool
I'm a mid-spring snowfall, joke's on you
I'm an April Fool for you

I'm an April Fool for you
I'm an April Fool
