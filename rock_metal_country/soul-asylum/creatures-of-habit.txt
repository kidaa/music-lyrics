If the day wants to begin, you can let the day in
If the darkness has no end, light up the darkness
It ain't on what you can depend, it's who you can depend on

If the rain wants to come in, you can let the rain in
If the darkness is your friend, you can hold the darkness
And if it ain't what you got, you know you gotta have it

The grass gets greener all the time for creatures of habit

Look out, here comes one more morning
Habits form without a warning
Love it can be habit-forming

Make your enemies your friends, and leap standing naked
It ain't how much you can take, it's how you take it

Look out, here comes one more morning
Habits form without a warning
Love it can be habit-forming for creatures of habit

Look out
A habit's forming
It's just one more morning
For creatures of habit
