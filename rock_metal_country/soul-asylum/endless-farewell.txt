Rise and shine it's you're razor sharp. Size up yourself in the mirror,
a slice of life, to last through all the years, because sooner
or later it all comes back to you, and we will remember, the
fine things you can do. I'm giving back all the things that you
gave to me. I'm saving up the price to pay to be free.
Remember the first time you saw the rising sun. You may be done
but I've just begun. The leaves are burning and the ashes have
flown away. I'm turning over new leaves almost every day. You
let him think you just as soon stay - you let him think you had
nothing to say. ??????????? just let you go away, to find some
mangled security, some strangled form of purity, to restore your
faith and all the things you've come to hate. You give and you
take and you leave, leave it alone. What i want so badly for
this to be a place you can call home, and I haven't felt this
way since yesterday, but I don't remeber when. What I want so
badly to be someone you can call a friend, till we meet again.
Endless Farewell. Hello, Hello, Hello again. Endless Farewell.
