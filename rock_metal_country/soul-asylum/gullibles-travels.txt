Keep a watch out behind you from that which can blind you
And die like a dream in a jar
Forewarned if hindsight is all that makes you right
You're running away but you won't get very far

No it's not my intention to harbor pretensions
Or told you I hadn't a clue
Took fate by the neck and you'll never look back
You've forgotten more than I ever knew

Everything's turning but mostly just turning out wrong
What's lost was once burning and finally? the day seems so long
And it's Gullible's Travels and nothing unravels this way
Just another lost journey where everything's turning away

Saving crowds from the roar from the cutting room floor
Played it at night in his dreams
Woke up was cold and his manager had sold him
It's louder than love but don't think I know what it means

Nobody's talking and who tells you when to go home
Guess I wore out my welcome, it's better than being alone
And it's Gullible's Travels and nothing unravels this way
Just another lost journey where everything's turning away

Shot in the dark landed short of the mark
Can't hold a candle to you
Flame's burning brightly and shines in so lightly
But lighting the day alone seems so untrue

Everything's turning but mostly just turning out wrong
What's lost was once burning but finally? the day seems so long
And it's Gullible's Travels and nothing unravels this way
Just another lost journey where everything's turning away
