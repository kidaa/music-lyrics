Now you're mad and leaving home
'Cause you say there's no one there for you to talk to
Isn't it nice to go outside
When you know there is no place you have to walk to
You can live alone inside a crowded room
________________________________
And it's never 
Never too late
Never too soon

Put on your frown to go downtown
_______________________________________
You have come a long long way
Even though you have no idea where you're going
You ain't done a godamn thing all afternoon
Your confidence is sinking like a lead balloon
And it's never 
Never too late
Never too soon

I can't come down I can't come down
I can't come down I can't come down
I can't go on I can't go on
It's not my fault __________________
It's not like I'm asking you to hold up the skyAll the things you held so high
Are you surprised to find that now they add to nothing
Now you're growing old and bored 
Do you think that maybe you could teach me something
There is nothing that you really can assume
But you can be the ___________ on someone's __________
And it's never 
Never too late
Never too soon

Now you're mad I know you're mad
Now you're mad I know you're mad
Why don't you just tell someone
It's not like you're the only one
It's not like I'm asking you to hold up the sky

I can teach you how to drive?
You can teach me how to lie?
Hush my darling don't you cry
This could be your lullaby
