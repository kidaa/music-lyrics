She walks into the outhouse
The cold night breathes into her face
The flies are standing still now
The moon it spills through the place

And she starts wondering it's like to be liked by everyone
And like everyone be just like anyone
And just wants to be so just like anyone

She reaches through the darkness
Her fingers touch the porcelain seat
She spins and pulls her pants down
The cold air holds her like a theif

She starts wondering what they mean, do they just mean to be mean
And thinking about the scene, do they just want to be seen
And trying not to seem so just like anyone

The door comes screeching open
She walks into the evening air
She disappears in the darkness
All that's left's the faint smell of her hair

She's done wondering what it's like to be liked by everyone
And like everyone be just like anyone
And just wants to be so just like anyone
And wondering what they mean, do they just mean to be mean
And thinking about the scene, do they just want to be seen
And trying not to seem so just like anyone
