Thought I heard you screaming
And pulling out your hair
Furious and steaming
A state upon your stare

Don't you know
Dirt will find you and
Dirt reminds you that
Dirt will always be there
It's only
Dirt around you and
Dirt surrounds you and
Follows you everywhere

Here's a dirty joke, man
Filled with filth and smut
The heart of it, it sparkles
The more it can corrupt

Don't you know
Dirt can't hurt you
I'm truly certain
Usually washes out
Don't you know
Rain will wash out the
Stain and all of your
Pain will work itself out

Work it out'Fraid you've lost your innocence
To some-odd social scene
You're right on top
But you've been replaced
By a shiny new machine
And dirt keeps following you
And you don't know what it means
You're a little too clean
A little too clean
A little too clean

One day dirt will bury you and
You will understand
There is nothing much more than the
Ground on which you stand

Don't you know
Dirt will find you and
Dirt reminds you that
Dirt will always be there
It's only
Dirt around you and
Dirt surrounds you and
Follows you everywhere

'Fraid you've lost your innocence
To some-odd social scene
You're right on top
But you've been replaced
By a shiny new machine
And dirt keeps following you
And you don't know what it means
You're a little too clean
A little too clean
A little too clean
