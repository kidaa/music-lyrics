Why don't you go home and crawl into your hole
Why don't you go home and spend some time alone

In the corner I looked across the room
To the other corner, I knew I'd be there soon

In the corner I looked across the room
I knew I'd be there soon, in the other cornerCaged rat x12

Why don't you go home and crawl into your hole
Why don't you go home and spend some time alone

From the corner I looked across the room
To the other corner, I knew I'd be there soon
