Shouldn't'a got so loaded
I damn near exploded
Oh Lord, you know I should'a known it

Whatever the price is, whatever the crisis
Oh please don't leave me to my own devices
Please don't leave me to my own devices
Oh please don't leave me to my own devices

She was a pretty good waitress
Said she waited on Elvis
Said she talks too muchPlease don't leave me to my own devices
Oh please don't leave me to my own devices

Save it up for a rainy day
It just rained yesterday

Whatever the price is, whatever the crisis
Oh please don't leave me to my own devices
Please don't leave me to my own devices
Oh please don't leave me to my own devices
