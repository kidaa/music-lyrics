Been dry long enough
My brain and body need some abuse
Rake me over the coals
And Ill try to think of an excuse
I set a goal and it wont be hard
Hit every bar on the boulevard
Bad idea yeah youre probably right
But I wont be your designated driver tonight
'Cause Im
Off the wagon and on the town
Off the wagon and on the town
Off the wagon and on the town
Off the wagon
Just how much Ive embarrassed myself
Well I havent got a clue
Did I throw a drink in your face
Or tell you how much I love you
Oh shit I lost my ID
Hook up the Jagermeister IV
Bad idea yeah youre probably right
But I wont be your designated driver tonight
Off the wagon
Im off the wagon
Im on the town off the wagon
Off the wagon wagon wagon wagon - Wee...
Set a goal
Hit every bar
Bad idea
Designated
Alright, alright
Off the wagon and on the town
Off the wagon and on the town
Off the wagon and on the town
Off the wagon
Im on the town off the wagon
Im on the town off the wagon
Im on the town off the wagon
Im off the wagon wagon wagon wagon
Off the wagon and on the town
Off the wagon and on the town
Off the wagon and on the town
Off the wagon
Thats it...
