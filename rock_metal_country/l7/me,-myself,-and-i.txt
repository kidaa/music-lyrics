Me myself and I
Will never be lonely
As long as I
Stick together
Like glue
Without you
I lie here on the couch
Thinking about potatoes and me
And I realize
Destined to be French fries
Me myself 
Me myself and I
My ships been tossed about
Have some decency
The only friends Ive got left
Are my idiosyncrasies
Me myself
Me myself and I
