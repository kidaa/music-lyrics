I suppose I should say a few words here
Let it all out
Try to let it all out
I like the sign with the blinking light
I like the sign it makes me feel alright
I like the lights yeah theyre soothing me
I like the lights when they get blurry
But something out theres messing with me
A strange dose of reality
I had some things I had to do today
I had some things my head got in the way
I thought a drive might make it okay
I thought a drive would take it all away
I cant shake whats hanging over me
I cant shake it this brain freeze
Something out theres messing with me
Bad things come in more than threes
Bad things bad things
I just wanna
Bad things, bad things
I wanna wanna
Bad things, bad things
Come on, I wanna
Bad things, bad things
I just wanna feel good
And I feel so bad
I like the sound of the urban din
I like the sound it fits the mood Im in
The city plays its manic song
The city plays I want to sing along
I cant shake whats hanging over me
I cant shake it this brain freeze
Bad things keep happening to me
Bad things come in more than threes
Bad things, bad things
I just wanna..
Bad things, bad things
I wanna, wanna..
Bad things, bad things
Come on I wanna..
Bad things, bad things
I just wanna feel good
I had some things I had to do today
I had some things my head got in the way
I cant shake whats hanging over me
I just cant shake whats hanging over me
Bad things bad things
I just wanna..
Bad things, bad things
I wanna, wanna
Bad things, bad things
Come on I wanna..
Bad things, bad things
I just wanna feel good
