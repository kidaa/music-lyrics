I open up those pearly gates
Hahahahaha!

Saints and sinners
Losers and winners
It's all up to you

Well I'm such a mess
And I must confess
What you've heard is true

Too many women
Too many bars
Too many songs about sex, drugs and rock n' roll

It's a long way to Heaven
Long way to Heaven
But only three short steps to Hell
Three short steps

Now it's a long way to Heaven
Long way to Heaven
But only three short steps to Hell
Three short steps

I want my wings
And that's the thing
I have to wait

Cause there's three reasons
I won't be seeing you at
St Peter's Gates

Too many women
Too many bars
Too many songs about sex, drugs and rock n' roll

It's a long way to Heaven
Long way to Heaven
But only three short steps to Hell
Three short steps

Now it's a long way to Heaven
Long way to Heaven
But only three short steps to Hell
Three short steps

Now it's a long way to Heaven
Long way to Heaven
But only three short steps to Hell
Three short steps

Now it's a long way to Heaven
Long way to Heaven
But only three short steps to Hell

Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
And if I die before I wake
Keep me rockin' for Heaven's sake

Yeah
Save my soul
Woo!

Mercy
Hahaha!

It's a long, long way to Heaven
It's a long way to Heaven
But only three short steps to Hell
It's a long, long way to Heaven
But only three short steps to Hell
It's a long, long way to Heaven
Yeah, but only three short steps to Hell
It's a long, long way to Heaven
But only three short steps to Hell
It's a long, long way to Heaven
But only three short steps
Three short steps
Three short steps to Hell
