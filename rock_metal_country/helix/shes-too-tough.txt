Ooh!

Black stockings and a high heel dress
Good lookin', your face is a mess
She's no angel
Oh no

Gun loaded, she's got plenty to spare
She'll pull your trigger before you're there
She's no angel
Oh no

She's too tough
Can't help it
She just can't help it
She's too tough
Can't help it
She just can't help it

Hands off, it's a catch 22
You can't touch, sshe can't refuse
She's no angel
Oh no

Whiplash, give her six of the best
Lay back, let your mind do the rest
She's no angel
Oh no

She's too tough
Can't help it
She just can't help it
She's too tough
Can't help it
She just can't help it
She's too tough
Can't help it
She just can't help it
She's too
Too tough

Well, she's too tough
Can't help it
She just can't help it
She's too tough
Can't help it
She just can't help it
She's too tough
Can't help it
She just can't help it
She's too

She's too tough

She's too tough
Can't help it
She just can't help it
She's too tough
Can't help it
She just can't help it
She's too tough
Can't help it
She just can't help it
