Mercy

Don't wanna be a soldier
Just a rock and roller
Yeah, 'cause one mistake
And it'll all be over

When that red sun rises in the sky
Poor boy now you're gonna die
Don't you stop to wonder why
Just bend over, kiss your ass goodbye
Kiss it goodbye

No easy street, no quick solution
Yeah, what we all need is a peaceful revolution

Eye for an eye, lie for a lie
Poor boy now you're gonna fry
Don't you stop to wonder why
Just bend over, kiss your ass goodbye
Kiss it goodbye
Kiss it goodbye

So long sucker

Well I'm going home, put my headphones on
Better get ready, 'cause it won't be long

And when that red sun rises in the sky
You'll know that it's time to decide
One itchy finger, it's a one way ride
Just bend over, kiss your ass goodbye
Adios
Kiss it Goodbye
Kiss it Goodbye
Sayonara
Kiss it Goodbye
Arrivederci
