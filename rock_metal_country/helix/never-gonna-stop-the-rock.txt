Let's go
Yeah yeah
Alright

When the heat is off and the sun goes down
I'll take you to a place where the action's found

Oh, drive out west, pushin' 99
There's a place I know across the borderline

I first heard the word on my daddy's knee
Well, in '55 it was the place to be

Where the neon sets the sky alite
Every night's a Saturday night
I won't get no summertime blues

And we're never gonna stop Never gonna stop
Never gonna stop the rock
And we'll never give it up Never give it up

No, we're never gonna stop Never gonna stop
Never gonna stop the rock
And we'll never give it up Never give it up
Never gonna stop

Well I'll meet you boys in the parking lot
I got a bottle in the back, gonna give it a shot

We got money in our pockets 'cause we just got paid
It's the time and the place, we got it made

Oh you know

Workin' all week is such a drag
It's the only way
Savin' it up 'til the time is right

And we're never gonna stop Never gonna stop
Never gonna stop the rock
And we'll never give it up Never give it up

No, we're never gonna stop Never gonna stop
Never gonna stop the rock
And we'll never give it up never give it up
We're never gonna stop

No, no, no, no, never gonna stop

Oh, hit it

Oh, we're never gonna stop Never gonna stop
Never gonna stop the rock
And we'll never give it up Never give it up

No, we're never gonna stop Never gonna stop
Never gonna stop the rock
And we'll never give it up Never give it up

No, no, no

Where the neon sets the sky alite
Never gonna stop

Every night's a Saturday night
Never gonna stop

Whoa yeah!
Never gonna stop the rock
