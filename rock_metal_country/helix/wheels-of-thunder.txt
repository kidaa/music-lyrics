Get ready for
Some thrills tonight
You know the time is right
To break the ice

And you will see
My aim is true
Cause I can't hold back
These feelings that I've got for you

You give me what I need
I'm running on desire
Powered by this dream
Yes, it's true

I can see the signs
Know just where I'm going
It just takes a little time

Driving this heart made of steel
Down the road I go
Wheels of thunder
No one can know how I feel
But this rock's got to roll
Wheels of thunder, yeah!

Another town
One more night
By tomorrow we'll be gone
Don't look twice

Can't slow down
Until I'm through
Cause I can't hold back
These feelings that I've got for you

You give me what I need
I'm running on desire
Holy gasoline
Yes, it's true

I can see the signs
Know just where I'm going
It just takes a little time

Driving this heart made of steel
Down the road I go
Wheels of thunder
No one can know how I feel
But this rock's got to roll
Wheels of thunder

Driving this heart made of steel
Sold my soul for the road
Wheels of thunder

Whoa! Go!

Reaching for that pot of gold
Chasing destiny
Riding that rainbow 'til the end

You can get anything you want
Everything you need
If your will has got the power that won't bend

Driving this heart made of steel
Down the road I go
Wheels of thunder
No one can know how I feel
But this rock's got to roll
Wheels of thunder

Driving this heart made of steel
Sold my soul for the road
Wheels of thunder

No one can know how I feel
But this rock's got to roll
This rock's got to roll
Wheels of thunder
