Up and down
All around
Kiss the sky
And hit the ground

Well it makes you laugh
It makes you high
It makes you sad
It makes you cry

So

Step right up
Climb aboard
Every day's a party
Get on track
Don't look back
Got my motor running

Let's break down the night
Come along for a ride
On this rockin' rollercoaster
I'm living my dream
Don't it make you want to scream
On this rockin' roller

Around the curve
Another bend
Well I get so scared
My hair's on end

Once you've made it
To the top
Watch out kid
You don't fall off

Whoa

Cause life's to short
For wasting time
Got to keep on moving
Take your chances
Hold on tight
Come on, let's go for it

Let's break down the night
Come along for the ride
On this rockin' rollercoaster
I'm living my dream
Don't it make you want to scream
On this rockin' rollercoaster

We'll break down the walls
We'll have a ball
Na, na, na, na
Na, na,na, na
On this rockin' rollercoaster
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
On this rockin' rollercoaster
Na, na, na, na Oh yeah
Na, na, na, na
On this rockin' rollercoaster
Na, na, na, na Break down the walls
Na, na, na, na We'll have a ball
On this rockin' rollercoaster
Na, na, na, na Gonna have some fun
Na, na, na, na
On this rockin' rollercoaster
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
On this rockin' rollercoaster
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
On this rockin' rollercoaster
