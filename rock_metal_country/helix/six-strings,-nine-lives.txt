There I was sittin' pretty
Tried to make the show
Fifty miles to the city
Head on over

Feelin' kinda greasy
We've been rockin' all night
But out on the highway
Man we look abright

Six strings Six strings
Nine lives Nine lives
They're walkin' the wide-eyed night
Six strings Six strings
Nine lives Nine lives
You're told just part to time the survive

Someone get me somethin'
Cause I don't feel well
Last night was a-Heaven
But there's more to Hell

C'mon let's do showtime
I gotta get it together
Well I think I need my guitar
Make me a star

Six strings Six strings
Nine lives Nine lives
They're walkin' the wide-eyed night
Six strings Six strings
Nine lives Nine lives
You're told just part to time the survive

Six strings Six strings
Nine lives Nine lives
They're walkin' the wide-eyed night
Six strings Six strings
Nine lives Nine lives
You're told just part to time the survive

See ya's
Ooh yeah

When we hit the stage
Can't you feel the rage
Time is right
We're goin' rockin' tonight

Six strings Six strings
Nine lives Nine lives
I'm walkin' the wide-eyed night
Six strings Six strings
Nine lives Nine lives
You're told just part to time the survive

Six strings Six strings
Nine lives Nine lives
I'm walkin' the wide-eyed night
Six strings Six strings
Nine lives Nine lives
You're told just part to time the survive
