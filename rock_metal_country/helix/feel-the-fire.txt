Feel the fire

Oh yeah!

Feels too hot, too hot to trot
She said feel the fire

Hands are cold and a Devil's soul
She said feel the fire

I know it's a sin and I know it's the law
But she said feel the fire

Love is precious and love is blind
She said feel the fire

Watch the flames get higher
She's got me burning with desire

Feel the fire
Feel the fire
C'mon! Feel the fire
Feel the fire

She led me in to a possum's pack
She said feel the fire

I did no mimicry and I did no sin
She said feel the fire

Watch the flames get higher
She's got me burning with desire

Feel the fire
Feel the fire
C'mon! Feel the fire
You gotta Feel the fire

Feel it!

Watch the flames get higher
She's got me burning with desire

Feel the fire
Feel the fire
You gotta Feel the fire
Feel the fire

Come on
Feel the fire
Ooh you got to feel it
Feel the fire
Yeah, you know you need it
Feel the fire
Watch the flames get highter
Feel the fire
She's got me burning with desire
Yeah
Alright
