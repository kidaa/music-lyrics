When I'm feelin' down
So mellow and blue

There's a sure fire remedy
That always pulls me through

I just gotta get me a fix
Of those high voltage kicks

Playin' my music loud
Really like that sound
Come on get out the lead
Gonna wake the dead

'Cause I'm flyin' high
Come on let's go
Needles on the red line
Hittin' overload

I've been waiting
For so long
Plug me in and
Turn me on
I'm wired for sound

Gimme those
High voltage kicks
I need those
High voltage kicks
Gonna throw the switch
High voltage kicks
I want those
High voltage kicks

If my feet had wheels
You know I'd rock n' roll right outta here
Eat my dust
Well you better stay clear

'Cause when the whistle blows
Well, I gotta go
Meet at the station with some
Rock n' roll

Got my ticket
And I'm on the move
Plug me in and
Turn me lose
Gonna blow a fuse

Gimme those
High voltage kicks
I need those
High voltage kicks
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme those
High voltage kicks
I want those
High voltage

Kick it out
Kick ass
It's a slice
It's a gas

You know it

Listen up

Got my ticket
On the rock express
Plug me in and
Oh, I must confess
There ain't no rest for the wicked

High voltage kicks
I need those
High voltage kicks
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme those
High voltage kicks
I want those
High voltage kicks
Come on, come on, come on, come on
High voltage kicks
I want those
High voltage kicks

I need a hit of those
Circuits on overload
Come on and give me those
High voltage kicks
