If I wrote it down in a song
The love I had for you
My heart would sing a melody
Of love in perfect tune

Harmony's a kiss away
It's returned in your eyes
With tenderness and feeling
Returned between the lies

Without you
The nicest song is sung
Without you
I'm a day without the sun
Without you
Love will lose it's spell
Without you
I'm a ship without a sail

At the end of it, the rainbow
There's a pot of gold, it's true
That's why all the highways
They always lead to you

All I have are simple words
I give that cheers this song
Won't you please think of me
When the road it is to long

Without you
The nicest song is sung
Without you
I'm a day without the sun
Without you
Love will lose it's spell
Without you

Without you
Nicest song is sung
Without you
I'm a day without the sun
Without you
Love will lose it's spell
Without you
I'm a ship without a sail
