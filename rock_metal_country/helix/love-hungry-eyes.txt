You make it good, you make it look so easy
Girl you got a hold on me
You're enlisting my emotions
From which there's no reprieve

You have a look so hypnotizing
You have a look, oh so hot
Burning through me like silent fire
Girl you know just what you've got

Love hungry eyes
I'm telling you
Love hungry eyes
Oh, that's what you've got
Love hungry eyes
Gonna get you some lovin' tonight

I don't need no conversation
I get the message loud and clear
Innocence can be deceiving
Nothing seems as it appears

Like a wolf, you feed your hunger
On the prowl, your blood runs hot
You come to me with a hungry heart
I should have known right from the start

You've got
Love hungry eyes
I'm telling you
Love hungry eyes
Oh, that's what you've got
Love hungry eyes
Gonna get you some lovin' tonight
Gonna get you some lovin' tonight
Gonna get you some lovin' tonight
Gonna get you some lovin' tonight
Gonna get you some lovin' tonight

Is she hungry for love
She's gonna take all she can get
Oh, is she hungry for love
You bet Oh ya, and she ain't done yet

With those love hungry eyes
Love hungry eyes
I'm telling you
Love hungry eyes
That's what you've got
Love hungry eyes
Gonna get you some lovin' tonight

Love hungry eyes
I'm telling you
Love hungry eyes
Yeah, that's what you've got
Love hungry eyes
Gonna get some lovin' tonight
