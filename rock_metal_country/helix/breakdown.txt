Thought that I was over you
Done with feeling down and blue
But here comes that heartache once again

Easy come
It's so easy to fall in love
Easy go
It's so easy to break a heart
Your life goes on
But mine it just comes apart
What's it take to
Make you

Breakdown
Breakdown these walls around your heart
Breakdown
Before I fall apart
Breakdown
Can't you see what you're doing to me
Breakdown
Before I fall apart
Breakdown

Something I remember
Reminded me of you
Like that cold day in December
Your memory it haunts me still

Easy come
It's so easy to fall in love
Easy go
It's so easy to break a heart
Your life goes on
As for me I just play the part
What's it take to
Make you

Breakdown
Breakdown these walls around your heart
Breakdown
Before I fall apart
Breakdown
Breakdown you got me on my knees
Breakdown
How can I make you see that

I don't wanna be loved
By nobody but you
I don't wanna be touched
By nobody but you
How can I take no for an answer
What's it take to
Make you
Breakdown

Tell me
What's it take to
Make you

Breakdown
Breakdown these walls around your heart
Breakdown
Before I fall apart
Breakdown
Can't you see what you're doing to me
Breakdown
Before I fall apart
Breakdown
Breakdown, breakdown
Breakdown
Breakdown
Breakdown, breakdown
Breakdown
Breakdown, breakdown
Breakdown
Breakdown, breakdown
Before I fall apart
