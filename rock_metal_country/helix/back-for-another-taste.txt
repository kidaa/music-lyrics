I want you
Your sweet love
Everything
That I've been thinkin' of

Wanna feel your
Body heat
Got a hunger
Gotta feed

You got me coming
Back for more
Back for more
You got me running
To your candy store
I'm back for another taste of your love

Back for another taste
Of your love
Back for another taste
I can't get get enough
Back for another taste
Ooh ya
Back for another taste

Sliding in
So easy babe
Eat it up
Just like a piece of cake

Wanna feel your
Body heat
Got a hunger
Gotta feed

Back for me
Back for more
You got me running
To your candy store
I'm back for another taste of your love

Back for another taste
Of your love

Back for another taste
Ooh ya
Back for another taste
Of your love
Back for another taste
One sweet little taste
Back for another taste
Another taste of your love
Ooh, your love

Well, I'm a bee
And I'm flying straight for your honey

Back for another taste
Of your love
Back for another taste

Just one sweet little taste of your love
Back for another taste
