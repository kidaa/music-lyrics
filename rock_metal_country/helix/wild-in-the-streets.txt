Head out
Hey yeah

I quit high school
Took a chance on a nowhere ride
Always breakin' the rules, grabbed the world by the ass
And barely made it out alive

We went wild in the streets
Turnin' on the heat
Bangin' on the Devil's door
We took a roll of the dice
And ya, we paid the price
Kept comin' back for more

This train keeps a rollin'
Clear the track
Keep this motor runnin'
We're never lookin' back

We're wild in the streets
Wild in the streets
Wild in the streets
Turnin' on the heat
Turn it on til we're
Wild in the streets

Step aside, ha!

We were the talk of the town
Spread around like a social disease
Shot down, kicked around
It gets tough when you wanna be free

You can waste all your time
Spend all your money
But things ain't gonna change
You gotta stand up, kick it out
Get this party started
No rhyme, no reason, we're on a rage

This train keeps a rollin'
Clear the track
Keep this motor runnin'
We're never lookin' back

We're wild in the streets
Wild in the streets
Wild in the streets
Turnin' on the heat
Turn it on til we're
Wild in the streets

Turnin' on the heat
Yeah

Alright!
C'mon!

Wild in the streets
Wild in the streets
Wild in the streets
Turnin' on the heat
Turn it on til we're
Wild in the streets

Wild in the streets
Yeah we're wild in the streets, yeah
Wild in the streets
Oh yeah we're wild
Wild in the streets
Turnin' on the heat
Turn it on til we're
Wild in the streets

Flyin' high
Take a ride
Goin' wild in the streets
