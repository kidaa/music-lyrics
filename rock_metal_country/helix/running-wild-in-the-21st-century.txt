Take a trip with me
Into the 21st Century
I know what's on your mind
What will we find

As time goes on and on
Will history repeat itself
Will there be fast cars, pretty women, rock n' roll
Well the future seems clear to me

Cause we'll be running wild
In the 21st Century
Cause we'll be dancin'
To some lowdown crazy beat
In some far out, far off
Distant galaxy
Cause we'll be running wild, running wild
In the 21st Century

New generation in the sun
Not too different from the last one
And Elvis lives and I know
Cause I heard, I heard it on the radio

And time goes on and on
And history repeats itself
And there'll be fast cars, pretty women, rock n' roll
Don't need a crystal ball to see

Cause we'll be running wild
In the 21st Century
Cause we'll be dancin'
To some lowdown crazy beat
In some far out, far off
Distant galaxy
Cause we'll be running wild, running wild

As time goes on and on
A boy grows up to be a man
Everyone his father's son
And history repeats itself
Don't need a crystal ball to see
Cause the future's clear to me

Yeah, yeah, yeah the future's clear to me

Cause we'll be running wild
In the 21st Century
Running wild, running wild

As time goes on and on
Will history repeat itself
Running wild in the 21st Century
