You say you got troubles babe
Weighing heavy on your mind
Well don't you worry no
Gonna leave 'em all far behind

In the morning light
When you're lying by my side
I'm gonna wipe away, wipe away
The tears you cry, you cry, you cry

Ooh yeah!

If you need lovin' babe
Well I'm your man
Gonna do the best for you
The best I can

In the morning light
When you're lying by my side
I'm gonna wipe away, wipe away
All those tears you cry

I'll always be there
When you need me
And this ol' world drags you down

And in the morning
When love comes shining through
I'll be your shelter from the storm

If you need someone babe
Someone to share
All those dreams you made
I'm the one who cares

And when you're feeling down
Or when you're feeling blue
I'm gonna wipe away, wipe away
All those tears for you

I'll always be there
When you need me
And this ol' world drags you down

And in the morning
When love comes shining through
I'll be your shelter from the storm

Ow!

And in the morning
When love comes shining through
I'll be your shelter from the storm

I'll keep you warm
I'm gonna wipe away, wipe away
All your tears
For you
Every tear
For you

I'll be your shelter
Your shelter from the storm
The storm
The storm

All those tears
All those tears
You cried
