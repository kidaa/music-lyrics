Dream on
Though it's hard to tell
Though you're foolin' yourself
Dream on

Dream on
You can hide away
There is nothin' to say
So dream on

You can laugh at me because I'm crying
You can tell your friends how much I begged you to stay
You can live your fantasies without me
But you'll never know how much I needed you

Dream on
It's so easy for you
But I'm broken in two
So dream on

Dream on
You can never see
What you're doin' to me
So dream on

You can cross your heart and still be lyin'
You can count the reasons why you've thrown it away
You can live your life away without me
But you'll never know how much I needed you

You can laugh at me because I'm crying
You can tell your friends how much I begged you to stay
You can live your fantasies without me
But you'll never know how much I needed you

Dream on
It's so easy for you
But I'm broken in two
So dream on

Dream on
You can never see
What you're doin' to me
So dream on

Dream on
You can hide away
There is nothin' to say
So dream on

Dream on
It's so easy for you
But I'm broken in two
So dream on

Dream on
You can never see
What you're doin' to me
So dream on

Dream on
You can hide away
There is nothin' to say
So dream on
