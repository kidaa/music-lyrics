High heels and mini skirts
Cruise on down the avenue
I hear talk about how she looks
Ha, if they only knew

She's got legs
Right up to her neck
She's got legs
With a one fish net
Drives the boys insane
Well when my lady comes a sruttin'

Ow

Christine I love the way you walk
Christine Uh-huh, ooh yeah
Christine Come on make your body talk
Christine 

All the boys, though they try
Well, they're just wasting time
As for me now, I should know
Well that girl, she's mine

She's got legs
Right up to her neck
She's got legs
And a fly fish net
Drives the boys insane
Well when my lady comes a sruttin'

Ugh!

Christine I like the way she walks
Christine Ooh yeah, uh-huh
Christine Come on make your body talk
Christine Yeah

Christine I like the way you walk
Christine Ooh yeah, uh-huh
Christine Make your body talk
Christine Yeah, talk to me

Christine I like the way she walks
Christine Ooh yeah, uh-huh
Christine Come on make your body talk
Christine Ooh yeah

Christine I like the way she walks
Christine Ooh yeah, uh-huh
Christine Make your body talk
