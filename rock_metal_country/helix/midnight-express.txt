Gid-gid-gid-giddy-up, yeah!

There's a train that I'm getting on
When the sun goes falling down
Got to get away, but you know this train
Never pulls out of town

You and I got an open invitation
It's time to move, got to keep our reservations
Just for tonight baby
Maybe we can fly away, so

Climb aboard the midnight express
Take a trip that you'll never forget
Come on baby, get this party on track
Climb aboard the midnight express

Ow-ow!

The engineer's gonna take you there
To a place right out of this world, so
Don't be late, don't ya hesitate
When you hear that whistle sound

So come on honey, won't ya meet me at the station
Together we can make it to our destination
We'll take the night baby
Maybe we can fly away, so

Climb aboard the midnight express
Take a trip that you'll never forget
Come on baby, let's get this party on track
Climb aboard the midnight express

Moving like a rocket
Nothing's cooling our jets
And nothing's gonna stop it
Love is dead ahead

You and I got an open invitation
Just for tonight baby
Maybe we can fly away Maybe we can fly away, so
