Your love is like a bittersweet wine
I just wanna drink from your eyes honey
You're the best thing that I've ever had, yeah

Together
Never gonna let you go
Forever
Love keeps showing
Love keeps growing stronger

Every single day
Give me all you got
Make it good to the last drop
When I'm feeling empty
Won't ya fill me up
Make it good to the last drop
Make it good
To the last drop

You're the light when there's only dark
In my soul you're giving me heart honey
Make it right when everything seems to go wrong

Forever
Love keeps going
Love keeps growing stronger

Every single day
Give me all you got
Make it good to the last drop
When I'm feeling empty
Won't ya fill me up
Make it good to the last drop
Make it good

Baby I love your way
More with each passing day
With each and every little thing you do
You do for me

Forever
Love keeps going
Love keeps growing stronger

Every single day
Give me all you got
Make it good to the last drop
When I'm feeling empty
Baby fill me up
Make it good to the last drop

Each and every day
Give me all you got
Make it good to the last drop
When I'm feeling empty
Baby fill me up
Make it good to the last drop
Make it good

Oh so good
To the last drop

Whoa-oh-oh!
Ooh-ooh
