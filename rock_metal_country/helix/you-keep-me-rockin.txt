No money
No illusions
Just need a rock n' roll transfusion

You're the one
You get me high
When times are tough you always get me by

Just wanna say
Thanks alot
You'll always be the best freinds we've got

So here's to you
I'll raise me glass
Gonna raise Hell, gonna kick some ass

You keep me rockin'
Yeah you
You keep me rockin'
Ain't that the truth
You keep me rockin'
Yeah you
You keep me rockin'
Yeah you
You're the one
You keep me rockin' all night long

Sometimes it's
So hard
My body's weary and my soul feels gone

I see your face
And then I know
Ain't gonna stop until I give some more

You give me strength
To carry on
So here's to you now here's your song

Gonna rock
What type are you?
Cause you're the one that always pulls me through

You keep me rockin'
Yeah you
You keep me rockin'
Ain't that the truth
You keep me rockin'
Yeah you
You keep me rockin'
Yeah you
You're the one
You keep me rockin' all night long

Hit it!

You keep me rockin'
Yeah you
You keep me rockin'
Ain't that the truth
You keep me rockin'
Yeah you
You keep me
You keep me
You keep me

You keep me rockin'
Yeah you
You keep me rockin'
Ain't that the truth
You keep me rockin'
Yeah you
You keep me rockin'
