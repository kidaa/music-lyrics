Well I remember back many years ago
To those old practice halls
Cheap guitar and a beat up amp
Where we always had our fun

Tryin' to pretend
When we turn it up to ten

Bangin' off-a-the bricks
We were just gettin' our kicks
Bangin' off-a-the bricks
Jammin', jammin', jammin' those lyrics

Never had no money, just a lot of dreams
Knowin' some things passed you by
The feeling I get, the person I've met
Ooh yeah, the sparks would fly

You know you can't pretend
When you turn it up to ten

Bangin' off-a-the bricks
We were just gettin' our kicks
Bangin' off-a-the bricks
Jammin', jammin', jammin' those lyrics
Bangin' off-a-the bricks
We were just gettin' our kicks
Bangin' off-a-the bricks
Jammin', jammin', jammin' those lyrics

Bangin' off-a-the
Bangin' off-a-the
Bangin' off-a-the
Bricks

Yeah

Ahh!

Ah just me and the boys
And this old brick wall
Havin' our fun
That's all

Bangin' off-a-the bricks
We were just gettin' our kicks
Bangin' off-a-the bricks
Jammin', jammin', jammin' those lyrics
Bangin' off-a-the bricks
We were just gettin' our kicks
Bangin' off-a-the bricks
Jammin', jammin', jammin' those lyrics

Bangin' off-a-the
Bangin' off-a-the
Bangin' off-a-the
Bricks
