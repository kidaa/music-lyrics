Witches brew
Without a doubt
Stranded in the desert
Broke down and outta luck

Two days
Flying high
Checking in, checking out
The bus, it up and died

Ride on, ride on
Heavy metal cowboys, heavy metal cowboys
Ride on, ride on
Heavy metal cowboys, heavy metal cowboys

Oh what a sight
We must have been
When we pulled out of Frisco
I was looking for my bed

Three days
Flying high
Slipping in, sliding over
That Nevada line

Ride on, ride on
Heavy metal cowboys, heavy metal cowboys
Ride on, ride on
Heavy metal cowboys, heavy metal cowboys
Ride on, ride on

Seen 'em come, seen 'em go
There's one born every minute
In this rock n' rodeo

Into the night
We ride again
Gettin' our kicks, taking our licks
Spit on the danger signs

Cause we're burning the midnight oil
Get on the bus, gotta stay tough
Take what ya can
Cause there's never enough

Ride on, ride on
Heavy metal cowboys, heavy metal cowboys
Ride on, ride on
Heavy metal cowboys, heavy metal cowboys
Ride on, ride on
Heavy metal cowboys, heavy metal cowboys

Ride on
Heavy metal cowboys, heavy metal cowboys
Ride on
Heavy metal cowboys
Ride on
Heavy metal cowboys
