Lately, all the nights are all the same
Since you said goodbye

I'm all alone
The only voice is my own

Did you hear me?
Are you near me?
Did you know that I hurt this bad?

Did you love me?
Did you need me?
Whole world just a dream I had

This memory haunts me forever

Better run for my life
Hide from the light
Dark is the night
Deep cuts the knife
No way
I'll get away
Memories here to stay
Deep cuts the knife

Lately, I see your face in everything I do
Sleepless nights I lie in bed just thinkin' of you

I can't pretend
That I don't need you back again

Did you love me?
Did you need me
Well alright, but what's so wrong?

This memory haunts me forever

Better run for my life
Hide from the light
Dark is the night
Deep cuts the knife
No way
I'll get away
Memories here to stay
Deep cuts the knife

I am your slave
Got no defender
You flash the blade
I can't escape
I can't surrender

Run for my life
Hide from the light
Dark is the night
Deep cuts the knife

No way
I'll get away
Memories here to stay

Better run for my life
Hide from the light
Dark is the night
Deep cuts the knife

No way
I'll get away
Memories here to stay
Deep cuts the knife

Deep cuts
Deep cuts the knife
Deep cuts the knife
Better run, better run for my life
Deep cuts the knife
Oh deep cuts the knife
Deep cuts the knife
Oh, memories here to stay
It won't go away
Deep cuts the knife

I am your slave
