Livin' in the streets
Has it's own set of rules
Take it on the chin boy
If you wanna stay cool

They'll knock you down if you let 'em
They'll push you round you bet
Gotta stay alive
Cause only the strongest are gonna survive

At the school of hard knocks
It's a long, long education
At the school of hard knocks
Everyday's a learning situation

You gotta past the test
You gotta make the grade
Keep a stiff upper lip boy
Don't show 'em no pain

They'll knock you down if you let 'em
They'll push you round you bet
Gotta stay alive
Cause only the strongest are gonna survive

At the school of hard knocks
It's a long, long education
At the school of hard knocks
On the streets there ain't no fakin'

At the school of hard knocks
Well it's a long, long education
At the school of hard knocks
Everyday's a learning situation

At the school of hard knocks
It's a long, long education
At the school of hard knocks
Everyday's a learning situation

At the school of hard knocks
It's a long, long education
At the school of hard knocks
On the streets there ain't no fakin', no, no, no

"Hey you, come back here kid."
"Hey somebody call the cops."
