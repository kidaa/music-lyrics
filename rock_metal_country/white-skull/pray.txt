In the beginning man has come first
But he was lonely and a little sad
He made his history and he was proud
But he threw the woman in slavery and shame
If I could have a choice
If I could make a wish
Joy could find a place inn my heart
Three hundred sixty five
The days that woman lives
And noone help her in her path...

And now I can't desist
And now I can't reveal
Can't find the meaning of my life
It is still a metter of fact
I've got to try and come out
Woman can now only pray
What do you seek
What do you mind
What do you wish
Pray, pray, pray
What do you seek
What do you mind
What do you wish
Pray, pray, pray.
We're here at the point of no return
I've got to find myself in the storm
Women will be your undoing
When we raise.
And now...
