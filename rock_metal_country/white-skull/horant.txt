Now the time has come the demons approache
In their satan eyes there's satan's course
But king Horant always says "It will be all right"
He won't reach the ODIN's reign he will win the fight
The world has got it wrong and we see the outcome
My heart began to flutter in this bloodstorm
But king Horant always says "It will be all right"
He won't reach the ODIN's reign he will win the fight

[chorus]
Horant always says the same
Time has come for the brave
Just time to say a quick hello
Time has come for the war

Now the time has come the demons approache
In their satan eyes there's satan's course
But king Horant always says "It will be all right"
He won't reach the ODIN's reign he will win the fight

[chorus]
Horant always says the same
Time has come for the brave
Just time to say a quick hello
Time has come for the brave
