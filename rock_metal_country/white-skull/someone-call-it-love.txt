I look at the window
Time after time you're gone away
I've never missed you so much
It's all so sad
How can i live now
Is this the pain that makes man die
What lies behind the realty
Only far memories
Don't you remember I won't forget you
You promised me that things would never change
And now i think I can't live without you
I feel alone 'cause I can't reach you now

Who calls it love
Who wants it all I won't baby
Who calls it love I still can't have you
Who calls it love can't get you out of my mind

Love at first sight and
Night after night I've been loosing sleep
Remembering that moment and
How I've wanted you to kiss
Where do I turn now
Is this the pain that makes me cry
But here I stand again
Wishing you were here
Don't you remember I won't forget you
You promised me that things would never change
And now I think I can't leave without you
I feel alone 'cause I can't reach you now

Who calls it love...
