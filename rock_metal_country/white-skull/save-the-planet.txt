Look at the sky now can your richness buy it all ?
There's no price you can state or politicians to pay
No million dollars spent
And i raise my head and
Look for happiness but
I can't statr i can't stop
I can't go i can't walk
War is all around.
You see you're living in wellness and freedom now
But you think at once it will change
All around leaving you astray
And you raise your head and
Look for happiness but
I can't start i can't stop
I can't go i can't walk
War is all around.
"planet earth is calling all of us
Have you ever heard her pray ?
We will be living through ruins
We won't survive ".
You think it's all dirty and nothing means
So you cry something and try to find a new reality
I know i know your fears
You got you got your tears
But i've got an illusion 'cause i wanna
Reach the sky and
Get real high.
Time slowly pass by and it's all the same
The rich get rich the poor get poor and that's the way
I know iknow your fears
You got you got your tears
But i've got an illusion 'cause i wanna
Reach that blue sky
And get real high
Whatcha feel today [x4]
