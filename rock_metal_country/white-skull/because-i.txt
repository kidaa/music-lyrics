[Fonto']

In every time the "big law" has ruled
And man wasn't so strong... I think he was not
Uhh is it my mission a choice ?

From the wooden chair beside my window
I only see that the million dollars man spent
Hadn't avoid him to feel the ill
Aids's still the big disease right now
Someone has been gunned down in 20th street
And, those who refused to pay were
Threatened with death
Are you gonna feel the ill ?
You will never meet me again

[chorus]
Because I / March in time
Because I / March in time
From the wooden chair beside my window
I only see that the million men feel the scare
And they're gonna leave the game
They will never see me again
I hear some voices from down deep inside me
But i only see that too many people're dead
Trying to find the ill that was
Taking them to the end

[chorus]
Because I...
Would you ever trust me
Would you ever meet me
No i'll live again and i won't be scared
No i'll fight until till the day i'll die.
