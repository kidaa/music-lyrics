You can be a better man
and even smile sometime
'cause when you're angry you get tough
you can hurt and beat deep inside
and I can't forget that night
you were baying... frothing
and I couldn't breath
You, you say, you'd been lost in your way
and you got no preach
to tell you where you're staying
on your knees do you try to get in touch
with your God
oro are you trolloping around ?
What you're gonna do ...
What you're gonna do !
"I got no fears" I heard you telling me
weeny weedy and weaky man over here
with your shady chin,
are you the macho myth ?
I'm not falling under your spell man !
What you're gonna do... 
What you're gonna do !
You're flesh, blood an faith
it's all I can say
you can be a better man for all
You, you say, you wanna be the best
but you don't know
what's going on in your head !
with your shady chin
you wanna seize the day
but you don't get it
and try to make it your way
What you're gonna do ...
What you're gonna do !
"I got not sins" I heard you telling me
weeny weedy and weaky man over here
have another powder puff
for your dirty tan
I don't like your theatrical charm man !
What you're gonna do...
What you're gonna do !
You're flesh... 
There's no way
flesh, blood and faith
You, you say you'd been lost in your way
and you got to preach
to tell you where you're staying
on your knees do you try to get in touch
with your God
or are you trolloping around...
What you're gonna do...
What you're gonna do !
You're flesh...
