Face to Face we crossed our eyes
but a fly noising all the time
just a like a glass between our lifes
don't tell my secret I'm already tied
But the memories of what is love
what it gaves
and what is love
I don't know what it meant to me
and adventure or something deep
don't tell my willing of making love
hard sex action between our souls
But the memories of what is love
what it gaves
and how it works

[chorus]
What kind of love it is ?
you're knockin' at my heart
What kind of love it is ?
tearing me apart
What kind of love it is ?

But the memories of what is love
what it gaves
and how it works

[chorus]
What kind of love it is ?
you're knockin' at my heart
What kind of love it is ?
tearing me apart
What kind of love it is ?
you're knockin' at my heart
What kind of love it is ?
yeah, I'm all right
