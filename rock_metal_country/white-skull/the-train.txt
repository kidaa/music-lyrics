Have you ever seen my train ?
It's running always fast
Have you ever heard my train
It's calling all of us, all of us.
Oh do you feel the train ?
Do you feel my train
It's taking all of us
Whereever you want to go
What do you feel
What do you like
What do you want
What you fear
Cowboy don't you shoot
Indian don't you plot
I want to leave it all
We are leaving from here now
It's flying flying flying flying flying flyiiiing
The big wall !!!
