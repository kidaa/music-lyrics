Mama please give me a good reason
'Cause all over makes me feel so bad and shiver
Nowhere, no place to take shelter
In this godforsaken place nobody cares
The random violence is on the street
People pushin' and shovin'
Faces like concrete
Another bomb has just been dropped and
Children saw another hideous crime tonight

[chorus]
World has gone insane [X3]

Mama we see the distruction
Is this the world we've been fighting for ?
My life, i'm fearing from my life
And i would bring back the joy again tonight
The random violence is on the street
People pushin' and shovin'
Faces like concrete
Another bombs has just been dropped and
Children saw another hideous crime tonight

[chorus]
World has gone insane [x6]
