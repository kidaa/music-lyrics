Kill the fierce her only deep desire
She waited years her anger getting higher
No way she wanted revenge
Hagen knew he left the land forever
He was well aware, he slained the hero
Its guilt, he'll never deny

[chorus]
Nor could the king
Stop the killin' queen
Time was for sure
Only an evil truce

Watch out

The queen bosom swell with fury 'n' anger
Didn't care how many lives were endin'
Their lives she will never spare
Day by day the cruel queen was plannin'
Her invitation to the bloody slaughter
No way she wanted revenge

[chorus]
Nor could the king
Stop the killin' queen
Time was for sure
Only an evil truce
