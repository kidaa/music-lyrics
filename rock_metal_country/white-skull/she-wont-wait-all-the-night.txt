Mama says I'm too proud to make it real
to forget the past and give away the tears
I'd like to run around in a desert place
but the memories it makes me wanna cry
and when I'm down I touch the hell
and when I'm down I'd try the suicide
She won't wait all the night
Daddy's gone insane I don't know why
he tried to strangle me
when I was just a child
and all the things I've done
were never right
all the things I've said I had to justify
She won't wait all the night
When you try to break this, this chains
when you are in need, she's not there
don't you wanna find where's your disease ?
She won't wait all the night
Mama time has gone and I want to shed
this shroud of grey we wear all life long
I'm treading on thin ice, I feel the pain
and I'd like to leave but never say goodbye
She won't wait all the night
When you try to break this, this chains
when you are in need, she's not here
don't you wanna find where's your disease ?
when you are in troubles, get tough
fight hard until the battle is won
never condescending and say no !
She won't wait all the night
