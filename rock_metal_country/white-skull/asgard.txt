Norsemen hearts belong to you
Ancient God of war
You have created a sacred world
In ASGARD is your throne
Time has come to praise the God
Crazy beings were living here
In superstitious fear
Angry Gods would ever cause
Pestilence or war
Time has come to praise it has come
Do it over and over again
Praise him for the upcoming war
You won't feel astray
He's got power in his hand
So cry aloud his name
ODIN used to overlook
From the exalted throne
Gazed towards south and west
The goal of all the hopes
Time has come to praise it has come
Do it over and over again
Praise him for the upcoming war
You won't feel astray
He's got power in his hand
So cry aloud his name

[chorus]
Asgard protects the warriors
Asgard shelter of Gods

Evil grew among the Gods
Holy Asgard fault
Noone praise it started now
The twilight of the Gods
Time has come to praise it has come
Do it over and over again
Praise him for the upcoming war
You won't feel astray
He's got power in his hand
So cry aloud his name

[chorus]
Asgard protects the warriors
Asgard shelter of Gods
