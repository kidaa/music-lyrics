People are always asking me
if I've finally found myself
asking me if i know what's up
what's going on all around me
I don't know about sex
I don't know about sex
I'm always imagin' what can be real
in trusting love affairs
does he's really successful and charming
or is he just another weak ?
I don't know... 
Time Time rubs my years
it will never hurt me
Time Time scratches my face
it will never hurt me
Time Time rubs my years
you will never find me here
Time Time rubs my years
you will never find me
In Deutschland wir sind gegangen 
und viele Leute konnen wir
Das bier wir haben getrunken
und das schmecht mir so viel !
I'm always creeping in this life
I don't know its Fucking meaning
different stories, different lifes
have been thrown on the scrap heap
I don' know... 
Maybe romance is not yet dead
and people wait for it
I'm wondering if they really know
something about sex
I don't know...
