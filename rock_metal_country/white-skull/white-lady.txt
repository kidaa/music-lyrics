Don't you remember
We spent the night
You can't refuse me
I can't survive
The pain of living twice at same time
Destroyed my senses, undertook my mind
Heaven in my dreams
Hell in real life
The pain of knowing you can't be mine
You can't imagine how do I feel
That's the way you're gone ahead
Don't you remember
We spent the night
You can't refuse me
I can't survive
I've heard your silence
I've heard your no
I feel just like slidin' in the black hole
Heaven in my dreams
Hell in real life
The pain of knowing you can't be mine
You can't imagine how do I feel
That's the way you're gone ahead
Heaven knows... Just another city'n'place
Heaven knows the pain.
