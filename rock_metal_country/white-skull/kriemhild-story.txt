Kriemhild princess was the young beautiful daughter
Of the king and the queen of Burgundy
One day the valiant Siegfried came to her court
The noble prince she would love and marry
They were as happy as only lovers can be
Ten years gone by in peace they were living
She couldn't know the cruel Hagen had plot
Her husband death Siegfried the hero

[chorus]
He deceived the gentle queen
Her husband's secret she revealed
Then he met the poor Siegfried
Thru' his body he drove his spear
She fell senseless upon him
Cursing Hagen treachery
She'd avenge her dead beloved
Kriemhild mournin had just began
