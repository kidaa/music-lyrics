Now it's all done
She made up her mind and she's still believin'
The last knight's gone
He promised the queen he would kill the evil
Once more brave knights fell on evry side
Once more they fought in such deadly earnest
But noone was able to be back again
Noone could survive
Long before
She was a lovely gentle maiden
Then she turned
Into a monster she don't surrender
In spite of the terrible slaughter she caused
Kriemhild lust was not appeased
She couldn't forget the day Siegfried died
She couldn't forget that day

[chorus]
Kriemhild hatred killed them all
But it has no sense at all
'cause too many innocents fell

The story end
She cut off the head of the hated Hagen
One knight came
Exasperated he slew the queen
In spite of the terrible slaughter she caused
Kriemhild lust was not appeased
She couldn't forget the day Siegfried died
She couldn't forget that day

[chorus]
Kriemhild hatred...
