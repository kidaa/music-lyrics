We ain't living our time in a video
Ain't winning our fights, ain't be so strong
I'd been never young in this world of pain
Blasting out the day you got away
Money for nothing that's what they dream
Teaching us the way you know what it means
Hearing all the day their screams so loud
They're pushin'in our mind only what they want.
The day is just began and i'm fuckin' tired
I can't bear this pain i can't stand this man
He's showing us the way what's right to do
But i know very well it's not the maximum
Money for nothing that's what they dream
Teaching us the way you know what it means
Haering all the day their screams so loud
They're pushing in our mind only what they want
Oh can you see a thunder in this lonely place
Can you feel the wind that blows you away ?
It's goin' to affect all our tiring lives
it makes me wonder if it's worth it to carry on
Oh
Away
Now you're gone
You'd better run
'Cause we don't know
What's right to say
What will be fair
In this darkned world
Before i go just take my hand and smile again
'Cause we can't stand to face it any more
'Cause we don't know if it's worth to carry on
And we've wanted so much to change it all alone.
Can you see a thunder in this lonely place
Can you feel the wind that blows you away here
It's goin' to affect all our tiring lives
Makes me wonder if it's worth it to carry on.
