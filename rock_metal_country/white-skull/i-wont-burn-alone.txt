Sparks in the sky tonight / devil in my mind
Forks push me in the fire / i don't care 'cause i
Know you are / a blasted town
And i decided / to take you down
Wicked souls you'll burn / crying your pain you'll course
In the endless night / i won't burn alone
I won't die / i won't cry
You're accursed / i won't burn alone tonight, tonight, tonight...
Witches in every time / goblin, elfs, spirites
Dancing all around / are looking for your town
They know you are / a blasted town
And they decided / to take you down, down.
Wicked souls you'll burn / crying your pain you'll course
In the endless night / i won't burn alone
Do you see / what i mean
Thru this night / start it right now

[chorus]
A million ways to make you feel like i do
Are coming now my friends
Are you praying now, no rest for the wicked
Or are you waiting for pain ?

Spark in the sky tonight / devil in my mind
Forks push me in the fire / i don't care 'cause i
Know you're / a blasted town
And i decided / to take you down
Wicked souls you'll burn / crying your pain you'll course
In the endless night / i won't burn alone
Do you see / what i mean
Thru' this night / start it right now

[chorus]
A million ways...
