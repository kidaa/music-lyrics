I have heard the prophecy
It's about to be fulfilled
Hard's the world sinners grow
And the man no longer spare
Feel the breeze of severe winds
Three full seasons without breaks
Seething flames burning hills
World is lost in venom flood
Too late the Gods realized who I am
In many shapes I threaten the man
My daughter's HEL, Goddess of death
Chaos has now its former shape

[chorus]
Here we are Raise

Bore with them the germ of death
Gods are doomed to be slained
Hard is the world sinner grows
And the man no longer spare
I have seen the tragedy
Will the Gods be back again ?
Seething flames burning hills
World is lost in venom flood
Too late the gods realized who I am
In many shapes I threaten the man
My daughter's HEL, Goddess of death
Chaos has now its former shape

[chorus]
Here we are Raise
