Will I step out from this dark world
And awake to life
And hardly fight until the Valkyrs came
And I've seen bleeding warriors falling down
And I wish to be one of the choosen slain
Suddently the world turns grey
Death's like a cold embrace
Icy drop in my face
Suddently the war is out
They've fought it day by day
On the floor they have found
The Viking's body laying
And all the knights have tried the warriors to revive
Sad hearted they prepare
The King's funeral pyre
The fire is burning high
Sea and sky on fire
Valhalla's open gates
Are waiting for the Brave
And all the knights draw near
They wanna say goodbye
Thru' Gods he will enjoy the eternal life

[chorus]
Oh Oh
See, see the drakkar sails alone
Now it has become the Viking's Tomb
