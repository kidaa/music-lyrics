Cloudy sky and rainy day
it's the feeling deep inside
I'm wet and dirty in this mood
at the mountain's end domine
It's raining and raining and raining hard
I got nothing in my hands
I'm washing away the drops in my face
at the mountain's end domine

[chorus]
In every nightmare
I try, try to get you
In every day dream
I try, I try to get closer

I'm just a woman who believes
in real love and fantasy
I've found myself in this sickness feel
It's the darkness of all human beings
I just need a family
little things all around me
I'd like to run around somewhere
'cause time's ticking inside my head

[chorus]

In every ...

Oh this time
we'll be living at the mountain's end
Cloudy sky and rainy day
it's the feeling deep inside
I'm wet and dirty in this mood
at the mountain's end domine
It's raining and raining and raining hard
I got nothing in my hands
I'm washing away the drops in my face
at the mountain's end domine

[chorus]
In every ...

Oh this time
we'll be living at the mountain's end
