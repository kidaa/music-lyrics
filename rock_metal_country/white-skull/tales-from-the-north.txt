Oh please ODIN tell us the secret
Why the Vikings were
The conquerors of the North
The winners of all wars
At the nightfall Hugin and Munin
Whisper in your ears
All the secrets of the world
All they've seen and heard
Tell us about THOR God of Thunder
TYR God of the War
Goddess HELA was the Death
The unlighted world she ruled
Can you see my secret illusion
To break the social links ?
I wanna see this heavy chains
Dropped from my hands 

[chorus]
Can't you see my misery
Will I stay behind or ahead
Should I live my life in compromise
Will I stay behind or ahead

Oh please ODIN tell us the secret
Why the Vikings were
True defenders of the faith
In fightin' times they lived
Tell us about the God of Darkness
BALDUR God of Light
LOKI was the Evil one
The father of the sin

[chorus]
Can't you see...
