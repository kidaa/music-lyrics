Hey boy don't tease me
You've gotta know how i feel
You've gotta know the real me
Hey boy don't hurt me
You wanna live like james dean
But you should unless be free
Hey boy don't tease me
You've gotta know how i feel.
I'm not pretender
I don't want what we can not reach
It's all confusing
I only know my spirit is wild
What can i do now is
Invent a whole new world [x2]
Each time i'd been mad
Couldn't see the big attack
It took time to realise
I was never satisfied
Each time i'd been sad
Couldn't see what was all that
But i've got a solution in my mind
A solution in a young wild mind
Hey boy don't tease me
You've gotta know what it means
You've gotta know how i feel
Hey boy don't hurt me
You look at me and just sneer
But you should unless be free
I'm not pretender...
