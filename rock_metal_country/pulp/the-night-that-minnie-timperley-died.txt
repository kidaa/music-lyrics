"There's a light that shines on everything & everyone. 
And it shines so bright - brighter even than the sun". 
That's what Minnie thinks as she walks to meet her brother, 
who is nearly two years older, on a Saturday night. 
He's DJ-ing at some do on the edge of town on the night 
that Minnie Timperley died. 
It's such a beautiful world, you're such a beautiful girl. 
So much that you want to try, the world wants to sleep with you tonight. 
But Minnie, Minnie if I could I would give you the rest of my life. 
How can a girl have sex with these pathetic teenage wrecks 
Football scarves, the girls drink halves & her brother's crying 'cos he has lost his decks. 
Outside the air was cool, an older guy sitting in his car asked if Minnie needed a ride. 
He thought he was still dangerous - paunchy, but dangerous -
on the night that Minnie Timperley died. 
It's such a beautiful world, you're such a beautiful girl. 
And he only did what he did 'cos you looked like one of his kids. 
But Minnie, Minnie if I could I would give you the rest of my life. 
Minnie. Oh, Minnie I can feel the pain. Oh yeah
