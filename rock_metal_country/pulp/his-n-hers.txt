I've got the time / and you've got the space / I'm gonna wipe you down 
and lick the smile off your face, the smile off your face 
Though we know that it's wrong / towel sets / matching combs 
Oh it looks so good but does it turn you on 
Oh... / I want you now / and I want you here / so lie down by the fire 
and if the neighbours hear, the neighbours hear 
'cos they don't understand / what you've got / in your hand 
Oh it looks so good but does it turn you on 
Oh... yeah! / Are we going to do it again 
Sideways / I was still in the queue when you came 
Delivered me from his 'n' hers / you pulled the units down 
Delivered me from his 'n' hers / and when I saw his face 
oh it made me feel better / Oh now it's gone too far / we gave up hope 
and the future's bleak / just a soap on a rope, a soap on a rope 
Put the rope around his neck 
Pull it tight / he's erect / oh and it looks so good but does it turn you on 
Oh... yeah! / Are we going to do it again 
Shove it in sideways / I was still in the queue when you came 
Delivered me from his 'n' hers / you pulled the units down 
Delivered me from his 'n' hers / and when I saw his face 
oh it made me feel better 
So we laid in bed afterwards and / she asked me 
what made me frightened / and I said 
"I'm frightened of Belgian chocolates / I'm frightened of pot pourri 
I'm frightened of James Dean posters 
I'm frightened of twenty-six inch screens / I'm frightened of remote control 
I'm frightened of endowment plans / I'm frightened of figurines 
I'm frightened of evenings in the Brincliffe Oaks searching for a conversation." 
"Oh you're stupid," she said / and she took my hand 
she took my hand and she said / "I want 
I want you / I want you to / I want you to touch 
I want you to touch me / I want you to touch me." 
Oh... / Are we going to do it again / Shove it in sideways 
I was still in the queue when you came 
Delivered me from his 'n' hers / you pulled the units down 
Delivered me from his 'n' hers / and when I saw his face 
you know it made me feel better.
