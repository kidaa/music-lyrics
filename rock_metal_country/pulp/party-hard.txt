I used to try very hard to make friends with everyone on the planet. 
I've seen you havin' it, havin' it yeah 
but now you've just had it.
Entertainment can sometimes be hard when the thing 
that you love is the same thing that's holding you down. 

This man is dangerous, he just shed his load on your best party frock.
Before you enter the palace of wisdom you have to decide: 
are you ready to rock 
Oh can you party with me 
Can you show me a good time 
Do you even know what one looks like

And I don't need to hear your stories again 
ust get on the floor & show me what you're made of. 
Just what exactly are you made of 

Baby, you're driving me crazy. [x2]

I was having a whale of a time until
your uncle Psychosis arrived. 
Why do we have to half kill ourselves just to prove we're alive
I'm here whenever you need me & whenever you need me I won't be here. 

& have you ever stopped to ask yourself
If you didn't come to party then why did you come here 
Why did you come here 

Baby, you're driving me crazy. [x2]

And do you really know want to know just how come you turned out so dumb 
When the party's over will you
come home with me 

When the party's over will you come home with me Now the party's
over will you come home to me. 
Will you come home to me [repeated]
