I am not Jesus though I have the same initials -
I am the man who stays home and does the dishes. 
& how was your day 
Is that woman still trying to do your head in 
A man told me to beware of 33. 
He said, "It was not an easy time for me" but I'll get through even though
I've got no miracles to show you.

*I'd like to make this water wine 
but it's impossible. 
I've got to get these dishes dry. 
Ah...

I'll read a story if it helps you sleep at night. 
I've got some matches if you ever need a light. 
Oh I am just a man 
but I am doing what I can to help you. 

[*Repeat]
& I'm not worried that I will never touch the stars
'cos stars belong up in heaven 
& the earth is where we are. 
Oh yeah. 

& aren't you happy just to be alive Anything's possible. 
You've got no Cross to bear tonight. Ah
No not tonight, Ah.
No not tonight, Ah.
I am not Jesus though I have the
same initials.
