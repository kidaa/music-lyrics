Give me the city
Give me the sea
Give to me everything I need
The future is shining like a giant metal beast
It shines so bright tonight with its legs open wide and love is blind
Falls in love with itself again like it never should the way it always can 
and she is mine
But the world is much bigger now 
Oh tell me should I hold her hand 
and give her love or take her heart and throw it far away
Oh now is the time to jump into it all 
I'll just hold my nose and try not to fall
To seek and to find instead of walking around with eyes glued to the sky
I turn them down to the ground
Oh and I used to think that maybe one day I'd find the love of my life
Oh but it's so far away
Oh I don't know why
Oh but I
I want it all tonight and love is blind
Falls in love with itself again like it never should the way it always can
Oh and she is mine but the world is so much bigger now
Oh tell me should I hold her hand and give her love or take her heart and throw it far away
We held hands and we looked out of the bedroom window
We could see all the buildings collapsing around us
So we kissed and we laid on the bed and we waited for the ceiling to fall in
But it never did 
In the morning it was all still there
The spilled milk and the dog-turds in that grey ashtray morning light
I could hear thousands of people and they were all singing this song: 
La lala lala...
Hey butcher! 
Oh, oh, oh hey butcher!
What's your name
Oh hey butcher, what's your game
Ah, you take all their love and you suck out their eyes 
and then you rip out their hearts
And you eat their insides
Yeah, then you just walk away with a smile on your face
Hey butcher, hey butcher
I've seen your face before
La ladadow da lalala...
And love is blind.
