So late looking up at your window as it bathes me in your blue midnight glow 
I wonder why you're not sleeping and I wonder if you could know
Tonight make it tonight
Tonight make it tonight
Crouched down by a bush at the roadside 
I watch as you pass me by
Lost down by the side of the river and no light comes from the empty sky
Tonight make it tonight
Tonight make it tonight
I left home at midnight 
Made for the horizon, no sense of direction
I walked on for miles, oh 
I hope that I find you 
I hide from the headlamps no lights in the window
The whole town is sleeping and somewhere you lie, oh
I wish I could find you 
Oh I'm lost by the river
My clothes are in tatters, my face scarred by branches 
I'm shivering with cold, no 
I don't think I'll find you
Tonight make it tonight
Tonight make it tonight
Won't you make it tonight
Oh say you'll meet me tonight
Won't you make it tonight
Say you'll meet me tonight.
