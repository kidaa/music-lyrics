I never thought that you would come / your sister said your nerve had gone 
You're trying to make it straight right now 
but I don't think that you know how 
Your sister knows / she wears your clothes / she laughs 
at all those things you chose 
Your sister knows / takes off your clothes 
we use your bed for goodness knows / Ow 
I left something where I knew you'd find it 
Lift your pillow and you'll see / and he's coming round today 
Hey hey / Check out if you're still alive / talking dirt won't change your life 
Listen hard and you can hear her saying not to be so afraid 
Loosen up and lay right down / watch her as she's going down 
It's easy when you stop pretending that you just got lost on the way 
na na na now now 
Your sister knows / she wears your clothes 
she laughs at all those things you chose / Your sister knows 
takes off your clothes / We use your bed for goodness knows 
I can't remember where we met / I can't remember what we said 
I can't forget the things we did / when everything just seemed to fit 
Your sister knows / takes off your clothes 
we use your bed for goodness knows / She's says it's better with two 
if you'd just stop being so stuck up / and he's coming round today 
Hey hey / Check out if you're still alive / talking dirt won't change your life 
Listen hard and you can hear her saying not to be so afraid 
Loosen up and lay right down / watch her as she's going down 
It's easy when you stop pretending that you just got lost on the way 
Try it; you might like it / But you might / smudge your lipstick 
and he's coming round today / Check out if you're still alive 
talking dirt won't change your life 
Listen hard and you can hear her saying not to be so afraid 
Loosen up and lay right down / watch her as she's going down 
It's easy when you stop pretending that you just got lost on the way 
Loosen up and lay right down / watch her as she's going down 
It's easy when you stop pretending that you just got lost on the way 
It's easy when you stop pretending that you'll never ever see her, 
yeah you've seen her going down and down and down and down and down
