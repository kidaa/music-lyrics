When you raise your pencil skirt like a veil before my eyes
Like the look upon his face as he's zipping up his flies. 
Oh I know that you're engaged to him. 
Oh but I know that you want something to play with baby. 
I'll be around when he's not in town, I'll show you how you're doing it wrong
I really love it when you tell me to stop. 
Oh it's turning me on. 
You can tell me some lies about the good times that you've had
But I've kissed your mother once and now I'm working on your Dad. 
Oh baby, I'll be around when he's not in town
I'll show you how you're doing it wrong
I really love it when you tell me to stop. 
Oh it's turning me on. 
If you look under the bed then I can see my house from here
So just lie against the wall and watch my conscience disappear. 
Now baby I'll be around when he's not in town
I'll show you how you're doing it wrong
I really love it when you tell me to stop. 
Oh it's turning me on. 
I only come here cause I know it makes you sad yeah. 
I only do it cause I know you know it's bad. 
Oh yes I know that it's ugly and it shouldn't be like that. 
Oh but oh it's turning me on.
