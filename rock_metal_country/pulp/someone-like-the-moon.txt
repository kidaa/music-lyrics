She likes to watch the moon as it travels through the sky 
'cos she's heard that it's romantic, though she really can't see why. 
Someone should have helped her through the day. 
Someone like the moon. 
So she drinks a cup of coffee & telephones a friend 
And she asks if she can make it so this night will never end. 
Someone should have helped her through the day...etc. 
But the light comes and the day bleeds through the sky & the sun
The sun makes it hard to get through & the radio only plays love songs so she cries
Though she knows it's such a bad thing to do.
In the evening it gets better 
And she thinks how it's not right that someone so stupid can so easily screw up your life.
Someone should have helped her through the day...etc. 
But the light came and the day bled through the sky & the sun
The sun made it hard to get through & the radio only played love songs so she cried
Though she knew it's such a bad thing to do. 
Can't you see Can't you see
Someone should have helped her through the day. 
Someone like the moon.
