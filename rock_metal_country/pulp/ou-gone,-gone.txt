Ba bababa ba bababa ... 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
The night was ended
He needed her undressed
He said he loved her
She tried to look impressed
After the break-up
It's just something you do to stop the night-time from falling down on you
The world is ending, the sky is falling down 
She's at the station because she's leaving town 
Oh you could stop her if you get out of bed
She wants to see you at least that's what she said 
You've got a minute at the very most and she's gone 
gone gone gone gone yes she's going away
Oh yes she's going away 
Oh yes she's going away, oh yes she's going away 
And now it's over 'cos I just saw the end
I saw the credits, I turned around and then I saw her running coming back to me
The sky exploded but I couldn't see 
The world is ending, the sky is falling down
She's at the station because she's leaving town
Oh you could stop her if you get out of bed 
She wants to see you at least that's what she said
You've got a minute at the very most and she's gone and she's gone 
and she's gone
Oh yes she's going away 
Ba bababa ba bababa ... 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah ...
