Ooh / We are the boyz / And we are class / At getting trashed 
So make some noize / We are the boyz / We are the lads 
We sleep with slags / We nick their fags / We got no choice 
We are the boyz / Oh we are the boyz / We don't ask why 
Because we're alive / We are the boyz / We are the boyz 
We're in the place / So shut yer face / You got no choice 
We are the boyz / We are the guys / We're getting high 
While you're getting by / So just make some noize 
'Cos we are the boyz / Oh we are the boyz / And we don't ask why 
'Cos we're always right / Because we're alive / Oh we are the boyz! 
We are the boyz / And don't look now / 'Cos we're coming down 
Don't make no noize / Cos we are the boyz / Now we are the men 
And that was then / It won't happen again / But we had no choice 
Cos we're the boyz / Oh we were the boyz / But we're not any more 
Not now we're so mature / Now we've got insured 
Because we're not so sure / No we're not so sure / Oh no we're not so sure 
Not so sure / Not so sure as we were / When we were the boyz 
We were the boyz / Oh, we were the boyz / C'mon, we're still the boyz 
We're still the boyz / Oh, we're still the boyz / Oh c'mon, we are the boyz 
We are the boyz / Oh, we are the boyz.
