The dust has settled, 
replaced the bulbs in all the lights. 
I guess I'll get no sleep tonight. 
A revolution happened. 
Oh, sorry you haven't heard 
We are the children of the new world. 
If you're quiet you can watch if you like. 
They say the future's beginning tonight. 
Whole empires will crumble. 
Civilisations will fall. 
Lie on the bed, hear the sound of it all. 
No anger, no guilt & no sorrow: 
it sounds unlikely, I know, 
but tomorrow you will wake up to find that your whole life has changed. 
Although nothing looks different a revolution took place.

I love the way you do it, 
I love the way you put them on. 
You know the answers but you get it
wrong. Just to confuse things. 
Why did it seem so difficult to realise a simple truth 
The revolution begins & ends with you. 

Now all the breakdowns 
& nightmares look small. 
Now we decided not to die after all. 
Because the meek shall inherit absolutely nothing at all. 
If you stopped being so feeble you could have so much more. 
The answer was here
