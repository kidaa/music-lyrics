On the night that I was leaving, the moon rose in the sky
As I came to fetch my suitcase and then you began to cry 
I've never seen you look so ugly as the way you did that night
That night was eighteen months ago
Now I'm two hours from the station
Yeah I'm coming home again
I'm gonna show this town who's master soon as I get off this train
You're gonna love me more than ever 
and the sun will shine again and I will kiss your face
And I will make you smile again 
and then the whole damn town will come on out to welcome me
Oh they will open all the doors and give it all to me
Oh no but still your voice is ringing in my ears
Don't you want me anymore Don't you want me anymore
And I can't I can't believe it's happening
I know that oh there must be some mistake 
You've found yourself another lover and you're glad we made the break
Oh you don't even you don't even want to see me
You just wanna wave and say "Goodbye. Go away now, and leave us alone
No this house is not your own."
Yeah 
And now the whole damn town has come around to laugh at me
Oh yeah Oh they can stare for evermore; you do not care for me
Oh no Oh they can stare now for a hundred thousand years
Don't you want me anymore
Don't you want me anymore
Don't you want me anymore
Don't you want me anymore
