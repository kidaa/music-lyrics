The room is cold and has been like this for several months. 
If I close my eyes I can visualise everything in it right down
Right down to the broken handle on the third drawer down of the dressing table. 
And the world outside this room has also assumed a familiar shape
The same events stuffed in a slightly different order each day. 
Just like a modern shopping centre. 
And it's so cold - yeah it's so cold. 
And as I'm standing across this room 
I feel as if my whole life has been leading to this one moment. 
And as I touch your shoulder tonight this room has
become the centre of the entire universe.
So what do I do I've got a slightly sick feeling in my stomach 
Like I'm standing on top of a very high building oh yeah.
All the stuff they tell you about in the movies 
but this isn't chocolate boxes and roses. 
It's dirtier than that, like some small animal that only comes out at night. 
And I see flashes of the shape of your breasts and the curve of your belly 
And they make me have to sit down and catch my breath. 
It's so cold yeah, it's so cold.
What is this feeling called love. 
Why me, why you, why here, why now ooh. 
It doesn't make no sense no. It's not convenient no. 
It doesn't fit my plans no. 
It's something I don't understand oh. 
F.E.E.L.I.N.G. C.A. double L.E.D. L.O.V.E. 
Oh what is this thing that is happening to me.
Oh. What is this feeling called love. 
Why me. Why you. Why here. And why now ooh. 
It doesn't make no sense no. It's not convenient no. 
It doesn't fit my plans but I got that taste in my mouth again oh.
F.E.E.L.I.N.G. C.A. double L.E.D. L.O.V.E. 
What is this thing that is happening to me 
F.E.E.L.I.N.G. C.A.double L.E.D. L.O.V.E. 
What is this thing that is happening to me. 
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah. Ooh.
