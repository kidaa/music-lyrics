Tomorrow Never Lies 

Tomorrow never lies so live for today / Don't be afraid of the skeletons of yesterday / 
Each morning brings you closer to your goal so grab your chance don't let it go / The city 
streets are littered with the casualties / the could'ves and the should'ves and the 
would've beens / Don't let this chance slip by / Because tomorrow never lies / Tomorrow 
never lies if you live tomorrow today / There are those who would shoot you down / ah / 
there's always someone wants to shoot you down / but you know they're never gonna be able 
to shoot you down / if you live tomorrow today / if you live tomorrow today / The night 
time blazes with all your nightmares come to life / But you can face the danger knowing 
that your cause is right and leave them all below you / bleeding as you rise into the 
night / Because you know tomorrow never lies / no, tomorrow never lies / no, it's never, 
never gonna lie if you leve tomorrow today / There are those who would shoot you down / ah 
/ there's always someone who wants to shoot you down / but they're never ever gonna be 
able to shoot you down / if you live tomorrow today / yeah if you leve tomorrow today / 
Cos you, you gotta live tomorrow today / Live it because tomorrow never lies / tomorrow 
never lies / oh no.
