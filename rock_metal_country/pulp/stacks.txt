I saw you standing at the stop in your crochet halter top and your sky-blue training bra 
I know you're gonna go too far 
You're driving all the boys insane down by the sports hall in the rain 
Chewing-gum, a navy dress, a purple shirt and all the rest
Oh there's stacks to do and there's stacks to see and there's stacks to touch
And there's stacks to be, so many ways for you to spend your time
Such a lot that I know/ that you've got ah-ah 
I heard you let him touch too much on the back seat of the bus
Did you stay over at his place
And did you do it Was he ace 
The world is bigger every day and you've always got something to say
And you've always got somewhere to go 
It's getting faster don't you know 
And there's stacks to do and there's stacks to see
And there's stacks to touch and there's stacks to be
So many ways for you to spend your time
Such a lot that I know that you've got ah-ah
Oh there's stacks to do and there's stacks to see
Oh yes stacks to touch and there's stacks to be
So many ways for you to spend your time
Such a lot that I know that you've got
Places to go and faces to kiss and boys to confuse
Are the boys good to miss
There's so many ways for you to spend your time
Such a lot that I know that you've got yeah 
I know that you've got oh I know that you've got
You got it!
