As the sun shines down on the land so her heart is crying for love
And there is no-one there, no-one to hear her voice 
and she will sleep alone again tonight
Now the moon is high in the sky 
In her room she calls out his name 
But he is somewhere else somewhere she cannot see
Oh and the night is dark between them now
"My god, my God, why did he go away"
Now the sun shines on a new town
With a smile he gets off the train
He lights a cigarette leans back to see the sky
Oh and he thinks how much better off he is without her hanging round
Let's do it
And the day is passing by him and he has nowhere to stay
At a lonely bar-room table his mind goes back 
to yesterday to the girl who's dead and buried
But her face lives in his eyes
He must forget that face forever
Make the future start tonight
Forget her
But the meal he eats is dead flesh
There is cancer in his cigarettes and the drinks won't do a thing for him
But revive some stupid memories 
Then a hairstyle that reminds him makes him run into the night
Where the moon hangs high above him now
The same moon that she's praying on tonight
But the wind catches her words and the moon swallows them whole
Now the moon is high in the sky
In her room she calls out his name
The night is cold and dark and she is all alone
The bed is empty now
Her body screams for love
She wants to be with him 
Oh but he's so far away
Oh and the night is dark between them now
"My God, my God, why did he go away"
