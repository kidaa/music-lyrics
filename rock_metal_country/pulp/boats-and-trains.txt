Would you like to hear 
about the things I fear 
About my life, and loves too
Well why should I tell you 
If I told you a secret 
you'd be sure to leak it 
You couldn't keep it inside 
no matter how hard you tried 
On boats and trains and 
and boats and trains and 
funny things and 
funny things and 
La la la...
