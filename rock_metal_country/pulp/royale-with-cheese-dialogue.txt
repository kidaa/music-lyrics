[JULES]
Okay so, tell me again about the hash bars.

[VINCENT]
Okey what do you want to know?

[JULES]
Well, hash is legal over there, right?

[VINCENT]
Yeah,It's legal but it ain't hundred percent legal, I mean, you just can't walk into a restaurant,
roll a joint and start puffin' away. They want you to smoke in your home or certain designated places.

[JULES]
And those are the hash bars?

[VINCENT]
Yeah, It breaks down like this, ok, it's legal to buy it, it's legal to own it,
And if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.
It's legal to carry it, but...but that dosen't matter, 'cause, get a load of this; all right,
If you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam, it's illegal for them to search you.
I mean that's a right the cops in Amsterdam don't have.

[JULES]
Oh, man, I'm goin', that's all there is to it. I'm fuckin' goin'.

[VINCENT]
I know, baby, you'd dig it the most.. But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is?

[JULES]
What?

[VINCENT]
It's the little differences. A lotta the same shit we got here,
they got there, but there they're a little different.

[JULES]
Example ?

[VNCENT]
Alright, when you .... into a movie theatre in Amsterdam, you can buy beer.
And I don't mean in a paper cup either. They give you a glass of beer
And in Paris, you can buy beer at MacDonald's.
And you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?

[JULES]
They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?

[VINCENT]
No, they got the metric system there, they wouldn't know what the fuck a Quarter Pounder is.

[JULES]
What'd they call it?

[VINCENT]
They call it Royale with Cheese.

[JULES]
Royale with Cheese. What'd they call a Big Mac?

[VINCENT]
Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac.

[JULES]
Le big Mac ! Ahhaha, what do they call a Whopper?

[VINCENT]
I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger King.
But you know what they put on french fries in Holland instead of ketchup?

[JULES]
What?

[VINCENT]
Mayonnaise.

[JULES]
Goddamn!

[VINCENT]
I seen 'em do it man, they fuckin' drown 'em in it.

[JULES]
Uuccch!
