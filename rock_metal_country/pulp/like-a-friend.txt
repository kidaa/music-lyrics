Don't bother saying you're sorry / Why don't you come in 
Smoke all my cigarettes again / Every time I get no further 
How long has it been / Come on in now, wipe your feet on my dreams 
You take up my time / Like some cheap magazine 
When I could have been learning something 
Oh well, you know what I mean, oh / I've done this before 
And I will do it again / Come on and kill me baby 
While you smile like a friend / Oh and I'll come running 
Just to do it again / You are the last drink I never should have drunk 
You are the body hidden in the trunk / You are the habit I can't seem to kick 
You are my secrets on the front page every week 
You are the car I never should have bought 
You are the dream I never should have caught 
You are the cut that makes me hide my face 
You are the party that makes me feel my age 
Like a car crash I can see but I just can't avoid 
Like a plane I've been told I never should board 
Like a film that's so bad but I've got to stay till the end 
Let me tell you now: it's lucky for you that we're friends.
