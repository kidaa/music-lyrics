The blue girls that bake in the sun / Skin falls in flakes from each one 
Like leaves from autumn trees / they float upon the breeze 
These girls you have loved / are slowly decaying 
Ah / Drying out in the sun / before your eyes 
Wild stares in your face / they seem to accuse you 
Oh / What have you done / to earn this prize 
The flesh underneath candy-pink 
Quite a strange affair you might think / They gasp and moan for air 
Beached fish on your lawn-chair 
These girls you have loved / are slowly decaying 
Ah / Drying out in the sun / before your eyes 
Wild stares in your face / they seem to accuse you 
Oh / What have you done / to earn this prize 
Fragments left at the end of the day 
A pile of blue that is soon swept away 
Goodbye, blue girls, goodbye / Would it be too much to cry 
These girls you have loved / have slowly decayed 
Ah / They dried out in the sun / before your eyes 
Wild stares in your face / they seem to accuse you 
Oh / What did you do / to earn this prize
