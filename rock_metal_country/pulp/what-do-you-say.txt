Woke up in the morning / raised my head still yawning 
Well I was in for a surprise / Stumbled to the mirror / realised in horror 
the face that stared back wasn't mine 
And it seemed to be so strange / this sudden facial change 
What do you say / What do you say 
I'd say it's quite strange / the way I've changed since yesterday 
Went down to the kitchen / hoping they would listen 
but no-one else could see, you see / I could live sans danger 
but all night I saw a stranger / A stranger that I knew as me 
And now it takes up all my time / this face that is not mine 
What do you say / What do you say 
I'd say it's quite strange / the way I've changed since yesterday 
Oh the way I've changed since yesterday 
And so I rest my case / I don't want another's face 
What do you say / What do you say 
I'd say it's quite strange / the way I've changed since yesterday 
Oh the way I've changed since yesterday 
Oh the way I've changed since yesterday 
Oh the way I've changed since.
