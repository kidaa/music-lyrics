You said you wanted some space ... 
Well is this enough for you ... 
This is what you've waited for ... 
No dust collecting in the corners ... 
No cups of tea that got cold before you drank them ... 
Tonight ... travelling at the speed of thought ... 
We're going to escape into the stars ... 
It doesn't matter if the lifts are out of order ... 
Or the car won't start ... 
We're rising up ... above the city ... over forests ... over fields ... 
Rivers and lakes ... into the clouds ... and up above us ... 
The whole universe is shining a welcome ... 
Did you ever really think this day would happen ... 
After days trying to sell washing-machines on your own ... 
It looked like we never left the ground ... 
But we're weightless ... floating free ...
We can go wherever we want ... solar systems ... constellations ... galaxies ... 
I'll race you to the nearest planet ... 
How may times have you wished upon a star ... 
Now you can touch it ... you can touch the stars ... 
Go on ... don't be afraid ... 
"I only wanted some space" ... 
Well is this enough for you ... Is it  ... 
Well the stars are bright ... but they don't give out any heat ... 
The planets ... are lumps of rock ... floating in a vacuum ... 
Yeah, space is cold ... when you're on your own ... 
I think it's time to go home ... pulling my strings ... 
Like a kite that flew too high ... and now it's time to come down ... 
Look out below ... 
Wait 'til I get back ... 
You can see something ... 
You can see space ... but now I know ... it's O.K. ... 
Space is O.K. ... but I'd rather ... I'd rather get my ... 
I'd rather get my kicks down below ... oh yeah ... come on ...
