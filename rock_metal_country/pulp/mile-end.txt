We didn't have no where to live, / we didn't have nowhere to go 
'til someone said / "I know this place off Burditt Road." 
It was on the fifteenth floor, / it had a board across the door. 
It took an hour / to pry it off and get inside. / It smelt as if someone had died; 
the living-room was full of flies, / the kitchen sink was blocked, 
the bathroom sink not there at all. / Ooh, / it's a mess alright, / yes it's 
Mile End. / And now we're living in the sky! / I'd never thought I'd live so 
high, / just like Heaven / if it didn't look like Hell. 
The lift is always full of piss, / the fifth floor landing smells of fish 
not just on Friday, / every single other day. 
Below the kids come out tonight, / they kick a ball and have a fight 
and maybe shoot somebody if they lose at pool. 
Ooh, / it's a mess alright, / yes it's / Mile End. 
[mumbled mutterings... you love it...] 
Oo-ooh / Nobody wants to be your friend 
'cause you're not from round here, / ooh / as if that was 
something to be proud about. / The pearly king of the Isle of Dogs 
feels up children in the bogs. / Down by the playing fields, 
someone sets a car on fire I guess you have to go right down 
before you understand just how, / how low, 
how low a human being can go. / Ooh, / it's a mess alright, / yes it's 
Mile End. / don't do that! Leave it out! / Bababa... 
Lalala...
