I know I'm getting on / and you're so very young / but would you like to stay 
until next Saturday / or Sunday 
I'll give you your own room / it's next door to my room 
and some time in the night / well, maybe I just might 
Oh take your clothes off won't you please 
You don't have to talk to me / just leave the light on so I can see 
You've got everything I need / Oh yeah 
You know I can't forget / that special night we met / at the local P.T.A. 
when your mother came to say / that you'd been taking days off school 
I turned and looked at you, I said 
"Yes, I understand / I'm gonna take this girl in hand."
Oh take your clothes off, one two three 
No you don't have to talk to me / just leave the light on so I can see 
You've got everything you need / Oh yeah 
'Cause I've never had a woman before 
I was too scared to touch the girls in the Poly 
And I don't know what it's like to be young 
'Cause all my life I've been knocking on forty 
Oh yeah / Oh yeah / Oh yeah / Oh yeah 
[Jarvis:] So if I / put my hand / on your bosom... 
[Candida:] Yeah 
[Jarvis:] ...would that / give you an orgasm 
No that's not right / But, but if we / if we kissed with tongues 
[Candida: giggles] 
[Jarvis:] won't that / wouldn't that make / wouldn't that make you come 
Oh take your clothes off won't you please / No you don't have to talk to me 
just leave the light on so I can see / You've got everything I need 
Oh oh oh / Just one touch was all it took 
No you can't learn it from a book / Let's go upstairs and have a / look 
Oh you've got everything I need / Oh yeah / Oh yeah, oh yeah 
Oh yeah, oh yeah / Oh yeah / Hit me.
