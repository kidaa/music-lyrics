Dogs are everywhere almost everywhere that I go
They have too much and then
They have too much again and then more
They leave their scent behind them everywhere they go
Oh dogs are everywhere that I go
Oh dogs are everywhere almost everywhere that I go
They have too much and then they have too much again and then more
They leave their scent behind them everywhere they go
Oh dogs are everywhere yes dogs are everywhere yes dogs are everywhere that I go
They always wag their tails at all the pretty girls and older women
They find their own way in and they rip up everything that I believe in
Sometimes I have to wonder about the dog in me
Oh dogs are everywhere yes dogs are everywhere, 
yes dogs are everywhere that I go
They get down on all fours when you walk through the door
They whine and beg around your feet like a dog for something sweet
They sink their teeth in you, they're tearing you in two
Remains are buried out of doors 
Oh I want some more
I want some more
Sometimes I have to wonder about the dog in me 
Oh dogs are everywhere yes dogs are everywhere 
oh dogs are everywhere that I go 
Sometimes I have to wonder about the dog in me
Oh dogs are everywhere yes dogs are everywhere 
Yes dogs are everywhere that I go that I go, that I go, that I go
Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere
Dogs are everywhere.
