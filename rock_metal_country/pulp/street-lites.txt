Doorways / corners / and the street lights dance in your eyes 
Behind the cinema / in the rain / in the subway 
where the walls crumble and cover you in fine dust 
'cos we haven't got a home to go to / touch me 
on the back seat, on the top deck / talk dirty / on the back row 
can you feel me / against you / oh no / we shouldn't / we shouldn't 
we shouldn't / I want to / ...mmmm... / What you gonna do 
if you go home and he's not there 
it wouldn't be the same if we didn't know it was wrong / oh touch me 
and then go wherever he takes you / oh yeah leave me 
and I'll walk it off in the rain somehow 
Someone wants to watch by the side of Alena Stores 
in the doorway, in the rain / Did he see us / Do you care 
Pull the night-time tight around us / and we can keep each other warm 
while the cars drive by / en-route to dried-up dinners 
and strip-lit kitchens and the smell of gas and potato peelings 
What you gonna do if you go home and he's not there 
it wouldn't be the same if you didn't know it was wrong / oh touch me 
and then go wherever he takes you / oh yeah leave me 
and I'll walk it off in the rain somehow yeah 
We've got to go on meeting like this 
I don't want to live with you or anywhere near you 
I want to catch you unawares / undressing in front of a window maybe 
impressed with those things I drive by / Did you see me 
Could you tell that I was watching / Did it make it feel better 
Yeah, it was good for me too / Did you think about me 
Oh did you close your eyes / Think that maybe 
it was my hand that was touching you / my breath against your face 
and when you opened your eyes 
did the world tip off its axis for a few seconds 
And you thought you'd caught a tiny glimpse of someone 
Something here with it's shoulders moving towards you 
Yeah I did too / and it felt good / and it felt good / and it felt good 
In a strange kind of way 
in a way that things that aren't supposed to feel good / sometimes do 
oh take it away / yeah 
What you gonna do if you go home and he's not there 
it wouldn't be the same if you didn't know it was wrong / oh touch me 
and then go wherever he takes you / oh yeah leave me 
and I'll walk it off in the rain somehow 
What you gonna do if you go home and he's not there 
it wouldn't be the same if you didn't know it was wrong / oh touch me 
and then go wherever he takes you / oh yeah leave me 
and I'll walk it off in the rain somehow.
