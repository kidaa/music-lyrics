Billy-Ray was a Preacher's son, 
And when his daddy would visit he'd come along, 
When they gathered round and started talking, 
Cousin Billy would take me walking, 
Through the back yard we'd go walking, 
Then he'd look into my eyes, 
Lord knows to my suprise: 

The only one who could ever reach me, 
Was the son of a preacher man, 
The only boy who could ever teach me, 
Was the son of a preacher man, 
Yes he was, he was, oh yes he was. 

Being good isn't always easy, 
No matter how hard I tried, 
When he started sweet talking to me, 
he'd come tell me everything is alright, 
he'd kiss and tell me everything is alright, 
Can I get away again tonight?. 

The only one who could ever reach me, 
Was the son of a preacher man, 
The only boy who could ever teach me, 
Was the son of a preacher man, 
Yes he was, he was, oh yes he was. 

How well I remember, 
The look that was in his eyes, 
Stealing kisses from me on the sly, 
Taking time to make time, 
Telling me that he's all mine, 
Learning from each others knowing, 
Looking to see how much we'd grown. 

The only one who could ever reach me, 
Was the son of a preacher man, 
The only boy who could ever teach me, 
Was the son of a preacher man, 
Yes he was, he was, oh yes he was.
