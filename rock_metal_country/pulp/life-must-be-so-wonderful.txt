Life must be so wonderful, living here on your own, 
please call / around to see. 
And maybe I've been loving you for too long, / and now blind, 
I watch you bleed. 
You rot in your bedroom, you cry on the phone. 
Well I'm sorry / but he's not at home. 
You give me your secrets, you give me your heart 
and I smile whilst you fall apart. 
Oh no, / please not now, / can't you see there's no time 
No, I haven't the time. / Can't you see there's no time 
Oh-oh, / oh-oh-oh-oh, / oh-oh, / oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh... 
Now all our dreams melt / in the sun, / and visions / dwindle 
one by one by one. / Perhaps you should move somewhere / far away, 
to another town / where maybe they / could see things in your way. 
It shouldn't be like this, it shouldn't be hard. 
I smile whilst you fall apart. 
You're sorry, you're sorry, is all that you say. 
Well, / I'd stop it, but I can't find a way. 
Your life must be so wonderful, / your visions die and fall. 
And in the end, / nothing ends, / just grows fainter 
and farther / away.
