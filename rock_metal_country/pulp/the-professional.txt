Oh I'm back in the full effect / I can't even hold myself erect 
I got nothing that I wanna say / I'm gonna say it anyway 
I know you think that I've lost it, baby 
I know you think that my star is fading / Used to be a contender 
Now you're just a pretender / Psychic karaoke every weekend 
You don't fit those clothes anymore 
Why don't you take them back to the charity store 
While you're there you could always hand yourself in 
You're into green issues - start recycling 
You hide behind your woman when you're out in your town 
Show her up and blame her for holding you down 
Holding you down, holding you down 
You're the only one who's holding you down 
You're only ever polite when you're out of your box 
Cocker's short for... sucker / Sucker of... / Oh, oh 
La na na na / Oh, oh / Sucker of... / Oh, oh / La na na na 
Oh, oh / When I got up today I had that feeling again 
Everything was OK, then the world started shaking 
Now I'm trying to sleep it away / Oh but I can't sleep it away 
Can you answer this question, can you answer it right: 
Have you ever done anything good in your life 
Have you ever done anything that wasn't just for yourself 
Are you capable of giving / Are you capable of giving just for the sake of it, 
without expecting anything in return 
I'm only trying to give you what you've come to expect 
Just another song 'bout single mothers and sex 
Single mothers and sex, single mothers and sex 
Just another song 'bout single mothers and sex 
OK, you've heard it before, it's nothing special 
But it's a living, can't you see / I'm a professional 
Oh, oh / La na na na / Oh, oh / I'm a professional 
Oh, oh / La na na na / Oh, oh / Sleep on my darling 
Sleep on, don't wake as I leave / I've been rehearsing this scene so long now
Don't interrupt me as I do it for real / The bedroom floor is treacherous 
A teacup could be disastrous / 'Cos it'll mean I would have to say 
What was written on the letter I posted yesterday 
So that it would get here / When I was gone / And you awoke 
Oh, she'll meet me from the train / And she'll never know a thing 
About how I talk with my mouth full / And only bath once a week 
How I'm nicer the first time you meet me than the next 
And I'm rapidly losing interest in sex / Yeah, I'm rapidly losing interest in sex 
What's the point in making it over-emotional / You can do it the hard way 
Or you can be a professional / Oh, oh / La na na na 
Oh, oh / I'm a professional / Oh, oh / La na na na 
Oh, oh / Sleep on my darling / Sleep on my love / Sleep on my darling 
Sleep on my love / Sleep on my darling / Sleep on my love 
Sleep on my darling / Sleep on my love
