I used to hate the sun because it shone on everything I'd done. 
Made me feel that all that I had done was overfill the ashtray of my life. 
All my achievements in days of yore range from pathetic 
to piss-poor, but all that's gonna change. 
Because here comes sunrise. Yeah, here's your sunrise. 
I used to hide from the sun, tried to live my whole life underground. 
Why'd you have to rise & ruin all my fun 
Just turned over, closed the curtains on the day. 
But here comes sunrise. 
Yeah, here's your sunrise when you've been awake 
all night long & you feel like crashing out at dawn. 
But you've been awake all night, so why should you crash out at dawn
