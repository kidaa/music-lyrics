Without you my life has become a hangover without end. 
A movie made for TV: bad dialogue, 
bad acting, no interest. 
Too long with no story & no sex. 
Is it a kind of weakness 
to miss someone so much 
To wish the day would go away 
Like you did yesterday. 
Just like you did yesterday. 

& I can't think of a way to get through this pain: 
To be happy again to make it all alright & I know it must be bad 
'cos sitting here right now, 
all I know is I can't even think, 
I can't even think of anything clever to
say, to say
So I say why pretend any longer 
'Cos I need you here with me. 
It's obvious that I miss you so much 
so please say you're gonna stay.
So please say you're gonna stay. 
So please say you're gonna stay.

The night is getting darker
now and there's nothing on TV 
but I'll sit tight 'til morning light. 
Yeah, I'll wait until the day.
Until the day that you say you're gonna stay.
