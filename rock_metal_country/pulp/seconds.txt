She / she used to live with his brother 
Now she's an unmarried mother / with another / on the way 
He's seond rate / twisted out of shape 
and he looks a state, it costs so much to look this rough 
They go to town / they like to shop around / and look at all those things 
All those things they never wnated anyway / She hates his hair 
that stupid coat he wears / but sometimes second best 
is the best that you can get 
Oh yes / oh somebody told me / 'cos seconds turn to hours 
and the hours turn into days / but still it feels like morning 
The first time leaves its trace / and then slides into second place 
and still it feels like morning / At night they try to fly 
hold on tight and close their eyes / and they hit the ground in the morning 
But in the morning it's raining / Oh Christ you're always complaining 
can't you think of something else / It's nearly-nu 
a bargain basement made for two / and if you blur your eyes 
you could be anywhere / you want yourself to be 
Oh yeah, it's bad / I know you want to laugh, so laugh 
But sometimes second best / Is all that you can get 
Oh yeah / oh somebody told me / the seconds turn to hours 
and the hours turn into days / but still it feels like morning 
The first time leaves its trace / and then slides into second place 
and still it feels like morning / At night they try to fly 
hold on tight and close their eyes / and they hit the ground in the morning 
But you're so perfect you don't interest me at all 
You're golden boy fell down / Don't you know / he hasn't got a personality 
And I know / he said he'd last all night then gave you seconds / yeah 
The seconds turn to hours / and the hours turn into days 
but still it feels like morning / The first time leaves its trace 
and then slides into second place / and still it feels like morning 
At night they try to fly / hold on tight and close their eyes 
and they hit the ground in the morning / My God they're still alive 
they got it wrong but they still tried / and they made it through to the morning.
