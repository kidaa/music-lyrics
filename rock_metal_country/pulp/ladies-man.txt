Now let's sit down too, 'cos I'm a ladies man 
I've got my work cut out, I'm doing what I can 
So hold me, touch me, thrill me, don't ever let me go 
Don't ask me to explain it 'cos you don't wanna know 
Oh / your hair is beautiful tonight 
Oh / And I know the feeling's right / Just for the surfaces I feel 
I just woke up so come on and hold me 
Come on and hold me, hold me, hold me / yeah yeah yeah 
I know a place where we can go and wear just what we want 
I don't want to be me, I get so tired of  
So don't ask any questions and I won't tell no lies 
Stop moving like some housewife and give yourself tonight 
Oh / your hair is beautiful tonight 
Oh / And I know the feeling's right / Just for the surfaces I feel 
I just woke up so come on and hold me 
Come on and hold me, hold me, hold me 
yeah yeah yeah
