First you let him in your bed. Now he's moved inside your head. 
And he directs all the dreams you are dreaming. 
I saw a friend of yours today
She called me over just to say "I dunno if you've seen her lately but God she's looking rough".
No don't go round to see him tonite, he's already made such a mess of your life. 
Find something else to do with your time & do it quickly while you've still got the chance. 
'Do you think he'll fall apart Do you think you'll break his heart 
If you leave him on his own.
You are dreaming 'cos he can fasten all his clothes, tie his laces, blow his nose. 
It's time to teach him how to walk, yeah, teach your baby how to walk away. 
No don't go round to see him tonite...[etc.] 
You're not his mother & you're not sister & brother. 
He's not even your lover. He's just a piece of luggage you should throw away. 
No don't go round tonite...etc. No don't go round tonite, you'll never make it right. 
He's already made such a mess of your life. 
Find something else to do with your time & do it quickly while you've still got the chance.
