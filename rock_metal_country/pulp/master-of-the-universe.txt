I am the master of this universe / and I've got so big it hurts 
Raise your eyes and graze your knees / oh for your master is displeased 
because you dared to doubt his word / his polished surface dulls and cracks 
Your bitter laughter breaks his back / I am the master of this universe 
I taught you everything you know / now you must bear your master's curse 
oh for I will not let you go / Now you must walk this town 'til dawn 
in every public open place / your master's look upon your face 
Oh now look what you have done / you've spoilt it all for everyone 
The master masturbates alone / in a corner of your home 
You feed him scraps when in the mood 
You beat him hard and keep him nude 
You cut your master down to size 
Now he cries and he cries now 
Lalalalala lalala... 
And now he begs both night and day 
He lets you take him on your knee 
He keeps on losing consciousness 
he dearly loves his new mistress 
Now he repeats it every night 
Every night on point of death 
"You are the master of this universe" 
Now he cries and he cries now 
"You are the master of the universe 
You are the master of the universe 
You are the master of the universe 
You are the master of the universe!"
