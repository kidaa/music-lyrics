When I was with this girl last night / she held me tight; it turned me on 
The moon was dark and those clothes were tight 
her perfume strong; it turned me on 
Fleeting moments touched in the night 
then so strong but banished by the light 
Her presence gone, memories remain / of how she kissed and turned me on 
Now there's this love inside of me / I've got this love / inside of me 
And I still have dull aching pain / desire to reach and touch you once again 
Distractions cannot sate the need / it grows once more, it grows once more 
I've got this love inside of me / I've got this love / inside of me 
I've got this love inside of me / I've got this love / inside of me 
I have this pain inside of me / Why can't you see Why can't you see 
I'm stranded here with no way home 
Please rescue me, oh won't you rescue me 
I've got this love inside of me / I've got this love / inside of me 
I've got this love inside of me / I've got this love / inside of me.
