Susan's babysitter / is seventeen years old / oh she looks like Susan 
when she still lived at home / She's a lovely girl 
She's got long black hair / if you go home now / she might still be there 
Susan's babysitter / is twenty-one years old / she still looks like Susan 
when Susan was not at home 
She's a lovely girl / she's got long blonde hair / if you go home now 
she will not be there / 'cos she left last June 
She came home too soon / You were both upstairs / in your daughter's room 
She's a lovely girl.
