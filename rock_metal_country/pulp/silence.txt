At first / I could say / I could say or do / just whatever I liked 
You would / you would not / You would not answer / that's alright 
Oh / I can't believe in the morning of your silence 
You will never cut / you will never cut the threads of your reliance 
You can / you can deny / you can deny that I was anything to you 
But I know / I know in my mind / I can see the scars 
the scars I've left on you / I can't believe in the morning of your silence 
You will never cut / you will never cut the threads of your reliance 
When we are passed in the street 
You can try and cover it up with whatever you like 
Lipstick, mascara, that kind of thing 
You won't fool me / you won't fool anyone 
They'll take one look at you 
and they'll know the kind of person they're dealing with 
You can laugh about it / you can pretend that you weren't involved 
But you know what went on in that room that night
You know what was said / ans you know you'll never forget 
I hate the sight of the face I have destroyed through our alliance 
I won't forget how loved I once was and how much I loved your eyes 
So the bedroom becomes a funeral parlour once again 
See the corpse of former feeling laid out stiff and white for all to see 
So / this is the end / But we'll still be good friends, won't we 
We'll still be good friends, won't we 
We'll still be good friends, won't we 
Goodbye.
