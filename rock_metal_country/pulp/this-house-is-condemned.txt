He's in a room 
He sees the floor
He sees the wall
He sees the roof
He sees the door 
It's nine thirty-eight
So he goes up to the door and he finds himself in another room 
identical to the one before
The clock still reads nine thirty-eight 
So he goes out of that room, but he finds himself in a parallel room
A mirror image of the one before 
He hits the floor 
He hits the wall
He hits the door
He hits the door
The clock reads nine thirty-eight
He throws it at the roof
He breaks a hole
He climbs out
He sees the moon
He sees the stars
He sees the sky
The stars are small lightbulbs set in a black cardboard dome
He climbs out
He sees the stars, he sees the sky
The stars are small lightbulbs set in a black cardboard dome
He hits the floor
He hits the wall
He hits the roof
He hits the dome
He hits the dome

Still nine thirty-eight
Two thousand years from now it will still be ticking
He hits the floor
Wall, roof, door
The clock reads nine thirty-eight
He hits the dome
Door, wall
Space, floor
Time
He sees the moon
He sees the stars for some romantic reason
Space, dome, door, wall, clockface
Space, time, place, floor, wall, door, roof
This is one small step for mankind one giant leap for man
Ten Nine Eight Seven Six Five Four Three Two One Zero
We have lift-off
He takes the clock, he breaks the dome, he sees the moon, 
he sees the stars
He sees the sky, he sees the Earth for some romantic reason
He takes the clock, he breaks the dome, he sees the moon, 
he sees the stars
He sees the sky, he sees the Earth 
Space, time, place, condensed
Space, time, place, condemned
