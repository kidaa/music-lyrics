All day / I'm doing fine / 'cos there are things / to pass the time 
Smoke a cig / and drink some tea / watch a programme / on TV 
I just don't care where you are now / 'cos I'm sorted out, and how 
I've got it all set up you see / But when I close my eyes it happens to me 
You're a nightmare / and you've made it all wrong 
You're a nightmare to me / Oh hoh / You're a nightmare 
oh and I just can't see / why you should keep on happening to me 
oh yeah / aah / Well it stopped some time in May / whilst you were still away 
Was I in bed or on a bus / doing something pathetically ridiculous 
I never noticed it at first / But when you came back it got worse 
It's the idea of you, you see / when I close my eyes it happens to me 
Oh you're a nightmare / and you've got it all wrong 
You're a nightmare to me / Oh hoh / You're a nightmare 
and I just can't see / why you should keep on / happening to me 
You're a nightmare / and you've got it all wrong 
You're a nightmare to me / Oh hoh / You're a nightmare 
and I just can't see / why you should keep on 
happening / happening to me / Oh oh oh 
And there were hotel bedroom birthdays / sleep in factory hallway 
I remember always Yeah there were hotel bedroom birthdays 
and sleep in factory hallway / I remember always 
Why do you keep on / hanging round 
Can't you see it gets me down 
Because when I look at you I see / somebody I just don't want to be 
Oh woh you're a nightmare / and you got it all wrong 
You're a nightmare to me / Oh hoh / You're a nightmare 
and you just can't see / why you should keep on / happening to me 
You're a nightmare / and you've got it all wrong 
Yeah you're a nightmare to me / Oh hoh / You're a nightmare 
and I just can't see / oh why why you should keep on / happening to me 
You're a mightmare / and you've got it all wrong 
Oh you're a nightmare to me / Oh hoh / You're a nightmare 
oh and I just can't see / why you're / why you're 
you're always hanging around / you're always hanging round 
You're always hanging around / You're always hanging round 
You're always hanging round / You're always hanging round 
you're always hanging round / You're always hanging round.
