Sure you had something to hide 
I took your bag and looked inside 
I was looking for life 
Nothing inside but memories 
the same as those I keep with me 
I'm still looking for life 
Yes I'm looking for life 
Yes I'm looking for life 
There's more to love than holding hands 
but I think that we both understand 
it's part of looking for life 
I thought so long I couldn't think 
but thought was what was hindering me 
and now I'm looking for life 
Yes I'm looking for life 
Yes I'm looking for life 
Yes I'm looking for life 
Yes I'm looking for life 
Yes I'm looking for life 
Yes I'm looking for life 
I'm looking for life 
I'm looking for life.
