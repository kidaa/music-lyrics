Laid here with the advertising sliding past my eyes like cartoons from other peoples lives, 
I start to wonder what it takes to be a man. 
Well I learned to drink & I learned to smoke & I learned to tell a dirty joke. 
If that's all there is then there's no point for me. 

*So please can I ask just why we're alive 
'Cos all that you do seems such a waste of time 
& if you hang around too long you'll be a man. 
Tell me 'bout it. Your car can get up to a hundred and ten -
you've nowhere to go but you'll go there again
& nothing ever makes no difference to a man.

So you stumble into town & hold your
stomach in. 
Show them what you've got tho' they 've seen everything. 
Yeah you're a beauty but they've seen your type before. 
You've got no need but still you want, 
so go and book that restaurant. 
The wine will flow & then you'll just
fly away. 

[*Repeat x2]
To a man
To a man
That's what I am.
