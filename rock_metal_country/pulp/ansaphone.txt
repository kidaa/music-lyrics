Oh I know I don't own you / but I don't even know if I should phone you 
Someone sending me letters / saying you've been going with other fellers 
And they / bored you / But I / don't wanna cry / or talk for hours 
to a machine / on the end / of a telephone line 
Oh it just kills me / when all you've got to do is call 
Oh do it any time / 'cause there's never no-one home / never no-one home 
Leave your message on the ansaphone / I'm not trying to be clever 
but at least we're not still living together 
All those calls in the evening / if I answered they'd hang up without speaking 
And they / bored you / But I / don't want to cry / or talk for hours 
to a machine / on the end / of a telephone line 
Oh it just kills me / when all you've got to do is call 
Oh do it any time / 'cause there's never no-one home / never no-one home 
Leave your message on the ansaphone 
[Beep!] 
"Hello, its me. I just wanted to call and say it doesn't matter what you get up to.
I just want you to stay in touch. That's all." 
Are you really not at home / Or are you there but not alone 
Screening calls / you don't want to receive / meaning calls 
calls that come from me / Oh I / need to see you 
It's not enough for me just to hear you / You said you'd be here by ten thirty 
but you want to stay out and be dirty / Oh it just kills me 
when all you've got to do is call / Oh do it any time 
'cause there's never no-one home / never no-one home 
Leave your message on the ansaphone.
