Sitting alone on / a cold bar stool, / your cold, hard eyes make me 
feel a fool. / Pastel-white features, / high cheek-bones, 
scarlet-blooded lips and deathly tones. 
The girl of my nightmares, / sultry and corpse-like. 
The girl / of my / nightmares. 
Brittle fingers, / and thin cigarettes, / so hard to tell apart, 
she hasn't spoken yet. 
You put your hand on mine, / death white on brown, 
those whirlpool eyes; / well, I begin to drown. 
The girl of my nightmares, / erotic and skull-faced. 
The girl / of my / nightmares. 
Anorexic beauty, / feather-weight perfection, / anorexic beauty, 
underweight / goddess. 
Sitting alone on / a cold bar stool, your / so hard to tell apart,
