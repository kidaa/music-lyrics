Well it happened years ago when you lived on Stanhope Road. 
We listened to your sister when she came home from school 
'cos she was two years older and she had boys in her room. 
We listened outside and heard her. 
Alright. Well that was alright for a while but soon I wanted more. 
I want to see as well as hear and so I hid inside her wardrobe.
And she came round four and she was 
with some kid called David from the garage up the road 
I listened outside I heard her. 
Alright. Oh I want to take you home. 
I want to give you children. You might be my girlfriend, yeah. 
When I saw you next day I really couldn't tell 'cos you might go and tell your mother. 
And so you went with Neve and Neve was coming on 
And I thought I heard you laughing when his Mum and Dad were gone. 
I listened outside, I heard you. Alright. Oh I want to take you home...etc. 
Well I guess it couldn't last too long. 
I came home one day and all her things were gone, I fell asleep inside. 
I never heard her come. And then she opened up her wardrobe and I had to get it on.
Oh, listen we were on the bed when you came home, I heard you stop outside the door. 
I know you won't believe it's true, I only went with her 'cos she looks like you. 
Oh I want to take you home...[etc.]
