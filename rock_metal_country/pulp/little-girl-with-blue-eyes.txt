You're just a little girl with blue eyes 
Everybody looks at you well, it's your day
And you're stepping from the black car 
But you'll be getting back in soon and on your way 
Little girl with blue eyes 
There's a hole in your heart and one between your legs
You've never had to wonder which one he's going to fill in spite of what he said
You'll never get away hey you'll give it up one day come what may
Dad's not got a shot-gun 
But his look's enough to murder you see what you've done and forget about the paintings
'Cos you'd better get the washing done oh something's wrong
Little girl with blue eyes
There's a hole in your heart and one between your legs 
You've never had to wonder which one he's going to fill in spite of what he said
You'll never get away
Hey you'll give it up one day come what may
Face down on the pavement, chalk lines round your little hands hit and run
And now a mother sits in silence in a darkness she can't understand where you've gone
Oh little girl with blue eyes 
There's a hole in your heart and one between your legs 
You've never had to wonder which one he's going to fill in spite of what he said
You'll never get away
Hey you'll give it up one day come what may.
