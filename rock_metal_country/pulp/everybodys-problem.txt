Standing there before you / defences thrown aside 
I thought I heard you laughing / but when I asked you said you'd cried 
I wanted to believe you / Yes I wanted to feel strong 
but looking at my picture / I realised I must be wrong 
Sounds so weak / it sounds so fey / it doesn't sound 
like what I meant to say / I speak to you / with a borrowed tongue 
Shall I stop right now / or blindly carry on / Choose one 
but I'm not everyone / I only have one viewpoint 
don't talk to me of right or wrong 
And didn't I often tell you / oh didn't I often say 
that something in your manner / that really takes my breath away 
It's not weak / to show I care / I know of those / who wouldn't even bear 
The fact remains / I feel a need / Is it love / or is it simply greed 
It's not weak / to show I care / I know of those / who wouldn't even bear 
The fact remains / I feel a need / Is it love / or is it simply greed 
You choose what you believe in / as far as I'm concerned 
But one thing I can tell you / is innocence cannot be learned 
I wish you'd stop me talking / oh I wish you'd shut my mouth 
Well the reason why I tell you / is I think that you could help me out 
and if you do then there's no doubt 
that all my problems won't just fly away.
