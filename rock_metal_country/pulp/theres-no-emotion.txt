As I lay / down in the bedroom, / there came a sound / from far away. 
As I strained / my ears to listen / I could hear / a thin voice say: 
"In your heart / there's no emotion, / and your soul, 
your soul just dried away. 
There's no love, / no love left in your / body; 
standing empty forever, / and colder / every day." 
So I spent / a night without you, / oh yes, I spent / a night outdoors. 
Staring in / to unknown faces, / trying to feel / just like before. 
In your heart / there's no emotion, / and your soul, 
your soul just dried away. / There's no love, / no love left in your / body; 
standing empty forever, / and colder / every day. 
Oh yeah. / No I don't 
believe in voices, / because I hear / them all the time, 
scraping tears / from hardened faces / with their stu- / pid ugly rhymes. 
In your heart / there's no emotion, / and your soul, 
your soul just dried away. 
There's no love, / no love left in your body; / standing empty forever, 
and colder / every day. 
Standing empty forever, / and colder / every day. 
And this is where the story starts, / holding hands / that hold you forever, 
only love / will keep you together. 
Holding hands / that hold you forever, / holding hands 
that throw you forever / away, / away, / oh.
