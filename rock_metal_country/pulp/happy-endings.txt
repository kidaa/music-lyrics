Well, imagine it's a film & you're the star & pretty 
Soon we're coming to the part where you realise that you should give your heart
Oh give your heart to me. 
Now the orchestra begins to make a sound 
That goes round & round & round & round & round & round & round & round & round again 
And we kiss to violins. 
Well some sad people might believe in that I guess 
but we know better don't we 
We know all about the mess. 
The aftermath of our affair is lying all around and I can't clear it away. 
No. And d'you think that it's so easy to find 
Somebody who is just your kind 
Well it might take you a little time but I'm going to have to try. 
Oh yeah I'm gonna try. 
And I know no-one can ever know which way to head 
But don't you remember that you once said that you liked happy endings 
And no-one can ever know if it's going to work 
But if you try then you might get your happy ending.
