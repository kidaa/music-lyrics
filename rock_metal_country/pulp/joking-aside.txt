I hate to complain, you know, but then again 
I cannot pretend nothing's wrong 
Looking at my present situation, the act cannot last for long 
Viewed from outside these pursuits I might try 
seem possessed of a certain allure 
Now they're no longer a source of mystery my faith in them's more unsure 
Now the time to play is over / Time to dispose of the lies 
Time to show what's really / on my mind 
Yes I'd like to turn you over / to see what's on your other side 
To see if the problem's / in my mind / In my mind 
The choice is quite clear, to move on or stay here 
Decision is harder to take 
Reject what I have for something unstable could easily be a mistake 
So I walk round the place with a smile on my face 
pretending the best that I can 
Hoping to lose the inclination to desire what I can't understand 
And the time to play is over / Time to dispose of the lies 
Time to show what's really / on my mind 
Yes I'd like to turn you over / to see what's on your other side 
To see if the problem's / in my mind / In my mind 
Lalalalala lalalalala... 
Now the time to play is over / Time to dispose of the lies 
Time to show what's really / on my mind 
Yes I'd like to turn you over / to see what's on your other side 
Like to turn it over / in my mind 
In my mind / In my mind / In my mind / In my mind.
