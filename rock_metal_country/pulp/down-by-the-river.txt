Nadadum dadadada dada da... 
Take me down to the river where I would not go before
Through the trees and the rushes to a place we both know
And I'm feeling much younger as I kneel on the ground
Dip my toe in the water of the river where I watched you drown
Nadadum nananana nana na... 
Oh when the river ran dry that next year
I could not find your body
Now I'm standing here ready at last to dive down and reach you again
And I long to be with you
Now these cold nights have come oh I go down to the river 
but the river will stop for no-one 
Though I ask it it keeps flowing on
When I ask it, it tells me you're gone
Dadow...
