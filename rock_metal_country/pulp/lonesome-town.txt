There's a place where lovers go
To cry their troubles away
And they call it Lonesome Town
Where the broken hearts stay
[Lonesome town]

You can buy a dream or two,
To last you all through the years
And the only price you pay
Is a heart full of tears
[Full of tears]

Goin' down to lonesome town,
Where the broken hearts stay,
Goin' down to lonesome town
To cry my troubles away.

In the town of broken dreams,
The streets are filled with regret,
Maybe down in lonesome town,
I can learn to forget.
[To forget]

Maybe down in lonesome town,
I can learn to forget,
[Lonesome town]
