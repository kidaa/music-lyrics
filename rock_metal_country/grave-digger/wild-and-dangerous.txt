2:45
Evil thoughts and evil doings.
Cold alone you hang in ruins.
You're living fast now life goes over.
Now you're know you are a loser.
Bloody dreams and nice white rats.
Death is calling for your head.
You can't escape you run for cover.
Say good by and tell your mother.
I'm wild - wild and dangerous.
I'm wild - wild and dangerous.
Empty bottles and empty glasses.
The day is over you waiting for darkness.
Night by night the same procedure.
You never listen to the preacher.
Mr.Blackman and Mr.Whitehead.
Taking your soul and brings you dead.
Take the key, unlock the door.
See the light that marks the right floor.
She's wild - wild and dangerous.
She's wild - wild and dangerous.
Bloody dreams and nice white rats
Death is calling for your head
You can't escape you run for cover
Say good by and tell your mummy.
I'm wild - wild and dangerous.
I'm wild - wild and dangerous.
She's wild - wild and dangerous.
She's wild - wild and dangerous.
