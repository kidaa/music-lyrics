He was supposed to ask for the hand of Isolde in the name of his uncle, King Marke. But love flamed up between them - though it was their tragic undoing.
Braveness, courage, fortitude
Guide Tristan on his way
Hunting, fighting, risking all
There's no way he could fair
When he plays harp the angels sing
Enchanted by its melody
Falcons made obedient
No anger and no jealousy
But what's all the virtue worth
When the highest wish's refused
When desire's never stilled
And your love remains taboo
Some heavenly moments with her
Did fade away too fast
Now is the time to sacrifice
And to erase the past
Magic potion
Crystal clear
It's too late
Open lips and
Open heart
Tristan's fate
No escape, your fate is sealed
Your longing will never cease
Dream away and she'll be yours
Dream and put your mind at ease
Give her to another man
Your common roads do part
Destiny separated you
But forever melted your hearts
