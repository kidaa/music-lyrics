I'm the king of destruction, the master of chaos. Leading the fools to the gates of hades. I'm weaving shadows, deep in their mind. Stealing the light and leaving them blind. Leader of armies, destroying each other. I'm watching with joy as brother kills brother. Inventor of weapons, too mighty too strong. Taking mankind back to where they belong.
Living in religion. I'm living in your greed. I'm growing every day a new. Your hate is all I need. Die! Die! Die! Die!
Shadowmaker, shadowmaker - meet me in the night.
Shadowmaker, shadowmaker - you will die.
Shadowmaker, shadowmaker - in the dark of light.
Shadowmaker, shadowmaker - you will die.
I'm the emptyness between two lovers. Feeding them poison, till they hate each other. I'm smiling as finally, under tears they part. And nourish myself, from their broken heart. I'm sowing bewilderment, between those who trust . I'm kicking your dearesst dreams in the dust. Where hatred rules, I will dwell. Call me devil, then you live right in hell. Living on the dark side. I'm living in your head. You're feeding me despair. And I shall drive you mad. I exist in you, in the shadows of your brain. I belong to you, and you know my name. Like a child you grew me, every day of your life. If you say you know me, it is a lie.I'm white and pale, because I live in the night. Of your happy days, of your lifeline so bright. I'm growing stronger, from the hate in your soul. I'm growing stronger, till I take control. I'm living on the dark side. I'm living in your head. And I shall drive you mad
