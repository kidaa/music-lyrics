Not there days ago
in a place no one knows
someone took the life of the man
who killed my wife
she'd been forced by a gang
I swore that all would hang
now their leader's dead
it was me who took his head
Tonight I'm on the run
but I won't rest 'til it's done
on and on I'll flee
'cause I know they're out for me
I can't sleep tonight
I'm ready for a fight
now it's first degree
and the cops are hunting me
Get away
Tonight I'll get away
Get away
Tonight I'll break away
Get away
Tonight I'll far away
Get away
No one will catch me
don't give up, it has to be
such a long night
but I know it's me who's right
surely I'll escape
all the time I'll stay awake
a knife in my fist
