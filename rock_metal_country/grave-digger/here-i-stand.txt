Have you heard 'bout my last arson it was the one down by the sea
you might call me incendiary but that's not what's hurting me
'cause the power and the glory is an aim in history
when your name's once in the papers you will find eternity
Fire - burns high
You'll view no stranger sight
Highest bonfire
The flames lighting the night
Here I stand
A gun in my hand
Here I stand The world in my hands
Now I'm gonna make my fortune
gonna kill someone who's nice well I told you my aim's higher
I will find the highest stairs
I will reach that golden medal as I climb the electric chair
