My fingers touch the solid stones.
Strong and cold, they keep me from home.
Imprisoned like a wingless dove.
Far away from the land I love.
Lonely days count lonley years.
I have cried a thousand tears.
All that I tried to gain.
Is lost the effort was invane.
At Carberry hill I lost my crown.
My husband fled my luck went down.
In England's hands I fell.
18 years a living hell.
The Scotish crown belongs to me.
Yet I'm bound I can not flee.
With iron claws England holds tight.
All is lost no chance to fight.
Silence - Silence Everywhere...
Cold walls are my reward.
Lonelyness engulves my soul.
I've been true i gave my heart.
Stained tears i cried.
I long to be free again.
To walk in peace again.
Scotland cries her queen is lost.
Agony's her friend again.
