We wanna rock you
We wanna roll you
We ...
Back to stage, we return born again
New and four, here we are, we come to rock
Watch out, watch out
What you feel is it real
We Are back now
Watch out, watch out
Waht you feel is it real
We are back now
See the kids, hot for rock, hot for us
We make the show, now for you, heavy metal
Watch out, watch out
What you feel is it real
We are back now
Watch out, watch out
What you feel is it real
We are back now

We wanna rock you
We wanna roll you
We wanna rock you
We wanna roll you
Every night
Sweat runs fast, on both sides, all are wet
Now you know, the shoe was good, heavy metal
Watch out, watch out
What you feel is it real
We are back now
Watch out, watch out
What you feel is it real
We are back now
