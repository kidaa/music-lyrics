My king won another crown - for Scotland's pride.
That is what we thought but we were not right.
Now he rules in London - a faceless king.
Sold his ancient kingdom to the enemy. Five laws.
You gave at Perth. Betray the rights. We gained by birth.
Cry,cry,cry,cry for freedom.
The heritage of centuries - you did betray.
The blood of Bruce flowing in your vains.
How could you give away - what Braveheart died for.
Freedom may be lost now and forever more.
You gain a crown. We pay the price.
You think you rule. But we will rise.
