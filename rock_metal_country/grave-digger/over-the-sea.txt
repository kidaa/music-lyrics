1The Order's end is near
Templars flee filled with fear
Heretics, homosexuals and magicians
To be exterminated by the inquisition
The order of Pope and King
Lets them leave behind everything
The fleet is ready, ready to sail
No one knows its destination
Gathering all the victims
Victims of persecution
In quest of a better world without hate without deadly peril
Over the sea
And far, far away
Over the sea
Into the night they flee
2Many Templars succeeded to escape from the Christian hate
They found their peace in Scotland
Since Robert the Bruce was banned
When he stabbed Comyn in a church
Giving the Order shelter in the Highlands
