1In the dark of the night
Behind the walls
They say that we worship an idol
Behind the walls
A devil in disguise
An unholy cat
But it's a secret
We keep until we are dead
We all believe in Baphomet
We believe in what we see
Your disciples,
Belong the thee
2Building up our strength
Behind the walls
They accuse us of a bloody sacrilege
Behind the walls
We would never betray
The one we adore
Yours are our lives
We sacrifice it in war
