All the time friends of mine
compliment me
all day long nothing's wrong
just to please me
what the Hell, let them say
they above me
a two-faced lie can't be true
it all bores me
Friends of mine say I'm fine -
don't believe them
Friend's of mine, they don't know
my suspicion
push on in, stand up close
while I'm winning
get a share, an empty stare -
thanks, I'm leavin'
Friends of mine
Rule the world
Friends of mine
Ruin the world
But it's true, I don't know
who's beside me
I look around, see my friends
do they see me
I can't count on one or two
when I'm lovely
but the rest, their interest:
big time money
Friends of mine
Take good care
Friends of mine
Better watch out
Watch yourselves
Friends of mine, I don't know
who's beside me
I look around, see my friends
do they see me
I can't count on one or two
when I'm lovely
but the rest, their interest:
