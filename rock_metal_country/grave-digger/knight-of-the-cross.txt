It is the end, of the eleventh century
The Christians rule
Europian countries
The Pope is the head of church
Representing God on earth
His words are the law
His mind is set on war
In the name of God they kill
In the name of God they rape
Blood leads to glory - for God's sake
Knights, knights of the cross
Murder, murder
Fight to defend Jerusalem
From the unholy devils
Pope and priests cry out for holy war
God and Jesus they think to be fighting for
The Islam conquered Byzanz
Slaughter Christians everywhere
Knights of the Cross invade the East
Whrer the Islam dwells
Knights in the name of
God, stab women and men
Burning, raping, eating human flesh
Satanic bloodlust in their eyes
The first crusade is won
The knights realize too late
Their ankles are covered with Christian blood
