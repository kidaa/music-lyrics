The ideals of the Round Table were: Honesty, bravery, baring, magnanimity, being of service to the other Knights of the Round Table, and loyalty.  The names of some of the Knights of the Round Tablewere: Sir Ulfin, Sir Kay, Sir Balin, and Balan, Sir Parcival, Sir Gaiwan, Sir Tristan, Sir Irec and, of course, Sir Lancelot. An important aim of the knights of the Round Table was to find the Holy Grail.
Table of the finest wood
Mankind has ever seen
With out head and without foot
A sign of  eternity
All knights are equal here
And so is even the King
Our swords point to its center
Giving us the power to win
Together we stand
Steel in our hands
Fighting forever
Forever we stand
Forever we fight
Side by side
Forever we stand
Forever we fight
Give us the wisdom - Almighty Lord
To make out wrong from right
Give us the will to choosen the Right
And the readiness to sacrifice
We beceme free in serving each other
We're Camelot pounding heart
Round table of true brothers
Until death do us part
