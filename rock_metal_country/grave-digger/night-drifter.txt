Well, it's a game
it's allright, let me stay
until sunrise
I'm out all night long
what could ever call me home
before daylight
On and on I go
that's the way I wanna live
you're got what you want
mix another drink
in this state I can't go on
time's runnin' on
 I want some more
more and more and more
it's to late for me to go
just one more night
 I wanna stay
and take my word
it's no luck to be alone
why do I have to live this way
Night drifter
Cries in his pillow
Night drifter
