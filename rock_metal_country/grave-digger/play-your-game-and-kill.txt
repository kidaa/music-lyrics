Young and free, it's a crasy scene
Evil's smile between your eyes
Eye to eye and back to back
You can't escape as the sun turns to black
Hot tinight - I wanna know what you feel inside
Hot tonight - Your eyes are full of lies
Play Your Game
Play Your Game
Play Your Game
Play Your Game ...
...And Kill
Never again, I won't see your hands
fear is everywhere you stand
We all live in a state of hate
We're so blind but that's our fate
