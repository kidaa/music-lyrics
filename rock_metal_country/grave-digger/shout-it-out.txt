We make it loud and proud.
We wanna see your hands tonight We possess the power.
And we know we have the right. Don't turn away.
Don't turn away. Rock it and roll it Don't turn away.
Don't turn away. Rock it. We come back without a warning.
We will take control. Can't you feel the magic.

And you can't run and hide.
We will keep on rockin.
Our souls are filled with pride.
