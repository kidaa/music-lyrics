1The Grail is veiled in mystery
Ancient books of history
At Last Supper with his discipleship
Jesus raised it to his lips
And when Christ was crucified
A lance was stabbed in his side
The Grail collected the pouring blood
Thus blessed by the Son of God
A cup of gold a sacred stone heaven choose
The keeper of the Holy Grail magic force
Heaven chose the keeper of the Holy Grail
Someone knows who's the one
The keeper of the Holy Grail templar knights
Know the hide heaven chose
The keeper of thr Holy Grail
2The Grail donates eternal life
Initiated are kept from strife
The sick are healed
A shelter and a shield
Youth will last forever
But there is no use to endeavour
To be one of the elected
Because only a few have been celected
