I walk alone through burning towns.
My sword is in my hand. But the battle has been lost.
And there is nothing to defend. At Culloden in seventeen fourty six.
Scotlands fate was sealed.
We wrote a bloody history.
Wounds that never healed.
Fight for death or glory.
Fight at Culloden Muir.
Die in pain and anger.
Die in Culloden Muir.
I still see Gillis MacBean. Standing wounded from the fight.
Back to the wall he fought. And thirteen Redcoats died.
But the Clans were beaten and destroyed.
Their wives are raped in shame.
Prince Bonnie's on the fight again.
The rising was invane.
We were a people free and brave.
Heroes stood tall.
But history is mercyless.
Now we are to doomed to fall.
The battle of Culledon. The end of Scotland.
