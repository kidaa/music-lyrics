Have you seen that man
Wrapped up all in black
He waits for his chance
Steps behind your back
He's the raper of the night
Never seen before
There's no warning when he comes
Lock your bedroom door
Jumped the garden wall
Did you hear him howl
Waits outside the hall
Can't you see him frown
Well, this guy is on the prowl
For evil and for lust
If you meet him, pray to god
Or you will be lost
He's a witch hunter, witch hunter
Witch hunter, witch hunter
Through the kitchen door
He's just found his way
Now the clock strikes four
Tonight he will stay
Stepping down your marble hall
He wears a sharpened knife
You can say I told you so
