The story of the love between Arthur and Guinevere. Lying on his deathbed, Arthur sings of his desperate love, Guinevere's beauty - and that he forgives her for all she done.
You're a precious girt
In a fragile shell with a rose coloured skin
And a roses smell
Your long golden hair
Reflecting the light
Your Emerald Eyes
Twinkle like stars in the night
Your smile shines brighter than the sun
Your smile shines brighter than the sun
You are my queen
Choose who is worthy of you
You are my queen
Your warm heart's shinning through
You are my queen
I forgive and forget whatever you do
Your body divine
From me you don't hide
The flame of desire
That is burning inside
Your ivory hands
Opened me the gate
To the meaning of life
Where love conquers hate
Your smile shines brighter than the sun
