1Now the time has come
The pagans are finally gone
Jerusalem in Christian hands
The Templars raise their banners
Innozenz gives them their benediction
Epic songs all over the land
Knights of the Cross die for religion
Death in action brings the Promised Land
Heroes of this time
In their honour
Church bells never
Cease to chime
Heroes of this time
Paradise comes
When blood flows
Like wine
2Martyrs made of steel
Longing for God to reveal
Outremer deadly holy ground
Lives are lost, celestial bliss found
In the middle of the twelfth century
Their glamorous empire starts to crumble
Fanatic assassins are seeking victory
King Saladins army starts to rumble
