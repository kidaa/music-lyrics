5:01
I see the people, living just a lie. Searching for freedom, untill they die. They live as cowards, they die as fools. But after death is gone, I come to rule. I haunt the ruins of you r wretched mind. You can't your tumbling blind.
Fools - I will lead you down.
Losers - Your eyes will stud my crown. Bastards - I rule you life.
I dance on your grave, I dance on your grave.
I am the ruler, of the endless night. I am a mighty power, that you just can't fight. I hold the k ey to your destiny. Do what you want, you'll never be free. Running in circles, no way out of this maze. Fog in your brains, get lost in the haze. I am the little man, inside your head. you think good, but I'll make it bad. I am the reaper of your destiny. The reaper is you and the reaper is me.
