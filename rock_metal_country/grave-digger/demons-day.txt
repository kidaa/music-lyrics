You site alone in lightless chambers, all the love you had is gone. No one there to catch your fall, you never felt so alone. Blackened thoughts in lonely ruins, lifeless eyes an empty gaze. Death is but a promise now, life is just an empty phrase. Demons wait in every corner, reach for you with poisened claws. Madness spreads its wings above, you're lying helpless on the floor. No one there - lost alone - madness rules - love is gone. No escape - never try - no way out - you will die.
Come out to the other side. Agony's your friend. Come out I will lead the way. In life there is no sense.
You're my victim,you're my prey, I will get you on demon's day. Can't you see me,can't you fell me, I will get you on demon's day.
No one there - lost alone - madness - rules - love is gone. The sun will never shine. No escape - never try - no way out - you will die. You die so alone. You've gone through hell, you met the devil, demons paved the way you walked. All alone you took the challenge, no one listened as you talked. Now you live a happy life, with all friends up in your head. Pills provide an easy shelter, all your sadness now is dead.
