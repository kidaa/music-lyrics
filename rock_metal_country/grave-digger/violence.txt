Hello baby, I see you are alone
Won't you go and stay with me
You have trouble, I see it in your eyes
Won't you go and have some fun
Come on baby, I do it just for you
Come and stay with me this night
You don't want this, I can't just understand
I'm your lover for one night
I'm a devil, I want to taste your soul
Want your body every time
I'm an evil, I want to get your mind
Want to violate your life
I'm a demon, I want to lick your blood
I'm the unter of the night
You can't escape me, I find you everywhere
Come and run, run for your life
guitar solo
That's violence
