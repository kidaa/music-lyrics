3:53
Walking down the road like a thief in the night
Rain is falling down and I can't see the light
It's my darkest hour, I feel trouble rise
I can see the animal, it's deep in your eyes
I hear you're near
Near by my ear
Kissing my ass
Steeling my breath
Shadows Of A Moonless Night
I Can Hear The Footsteps Behind
Shadows Of A Moonless Night
I Can Feel The Danger, 'Cause You're So Wild
I have no time for talking, have no time to run
Candles burning low, I feel my time has come
Step out of my nightmare, sweat runs cold as ice
Sun is rising slowly, it's no time to die
