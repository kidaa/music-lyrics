6:18
The gates of hell are open
The night of the wolf has broken
The moon of madness is shining
The son of evil is rising
They're marching on and on and
There's no place to hide
They're living in fear
Oh god can't you see
Their eyes are full of tears
They're starting to run
They never reach the end,
The end of the way
They're marching for freedom
They're marching for life
They're searching for love,
But they don't wanna die
We're Waiting, We're Waiting for The Legion Of The Lost
We're Waiting, We're Waiting for The Legion Of The Lost
