Break the law
Pride will fall
Break the chains
Freedom calls
Our time is coming
this land is ours
the mental slavery
of all mankind
will soon be over
we have to try
reach out for freedom
we'll take our rights
Did you ever think
those above cannot be bought
did you ever see
so much room for you and me
why don't you try
to stand up and pass them by
turn the hands of time
take something for your life
