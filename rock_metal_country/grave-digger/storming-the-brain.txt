Night is cold and black. Straight ahead's the way we have to go.
Night is cold and black. What is it that we are fighting for.
Strike against the time. Is it true we live in '84.
Gotta change the line. Pathes of the past are left behind.
Strap down those above, We wanna hate no more.
Strap down those below, We wanna kill no more.
Shake off those of them, Who can't be drawn upon.
Shake off both of them, They better move on.
