Four o'clock, she's just gone to sleep
She's a girl, no one ever keeps
Playing false is her only joy
Fooling 'round, men become her toys
Bad girl, I won't see her anymore
Five o'clock, I lay on my bed
Thoughts of her going through my head
Makes me cry, tears are in my eyes
What she does keeps me wondering why
Bad girl, I don't want her anymore
Six o'clock, I can get no rest
Now she's gone, maybe for the best
No more tries 'cause I know for sure
I won't fight for that girl no more
Tears of blood
Cold as ice
Tears of blood
Falling down tonight
