I like to taste the wine
I sword to save the King
Two jewels I am devoted to
When the darkness closes in
I kneel before you, Arthur
For you I risk my life
I am your protector
And I do crave your wife
My life for you
My heart is true
Alive I taste
Forbidden fruit
My tongue speaks words
Of feelings deep
Another tongue
Then blood and steel
For the land and for the steel
For the queen my love is real
I'd die for englands rose and pride
I'd die for you my guardian light
I would sneak in her chamber
When she longs for me
And I would give her all
A man has to give
I go mad without her
Don't close her away from me
I free her from the tower
And take her home with me
