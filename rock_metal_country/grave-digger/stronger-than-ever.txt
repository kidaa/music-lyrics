I was an man with no future
A bird without wings
I crawled through the desert
With nothing to drink
Searching and searching
Time after time looking for new horizons
And you were right here by my side
Stronger than ever
Stronger than ever before
Stronger than ever
Stronger than ever before
Now I'm as strong as a lion
And I can run like the wind
I can jump through the fire
'Cause you're here with me
Higher and higher together we fly
Nothing can bring us down
'Cause you're right here by my side
