Watch her style, Demon's smile. Walkin' down the road.
Dressed in black, Don't look back. Lies that's what she told
Evil speel, Came from hell. Far from down below.
Shoot her, Shoot her, Shoot her down.
Shoot her down, I said down down down.
Shoot her down, I said down down down.
Shoot her down, I said down down down
Shoot her down, I said down.
Made me weak, Struck her feet. Right into my balls,
Got my knife, Took her life,Watched her as she crawled.
Loved her so, Had to go. Down where she belongs.
Shoot her, Shoot her, Shoot her down
