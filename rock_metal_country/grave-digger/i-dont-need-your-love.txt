Don't come hanging 'round my backdoor
Wanna see your face no more
Listen girl just what I say
Stay away
I've got more important things to do
Than to waste my time with you
Shouting your mouth
All over town
No more looks that hypnotize
Sparklw someone else's eyes
You're a no good lovemachine
Crazy scene
All you wanted was to get down
Kept your body to the ground
And the only way to reach you was in bed
I don't need your love
You better take it or leave it
I don't need your love
I'm sick and tired of all the lies
Behind your painted smile
Everytime I see your face
Satisfaction's growning less
Get away, don't try to hold me
Let me be
There was never harmony
Even when you clung to me
There's no place for you in this house
Get on out
