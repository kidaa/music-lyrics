By God's Grace. I'm the king. James the 7th. Obey or death I bring.
I hunt the Convenanters down. The Wigtownshire martyrs drown.
Sixteen eighty five.The Black Year.
Killing time. Believe in me or you must die.
Killing time. Hang the victims hang them high.
James Stewart reigns. Blood on his hands.
His people tortured. By his own commands.
Revolution sweet revenge. Hunt the tyrant off the throne.
Sixteen eighty eight. The fall of The House of Stewart.
Killing time. Kill the tyrant he must die.
Killing time. Hang the victims hang them high.
