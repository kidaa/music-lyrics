Welcome to the Evil's nightmare
See the demons dancing round
waiting for the reaper's rising
Looking out for Satan's crowd
The grave is open, a digger's smile
please welcome the dead
Look Behind You; He Stands Behind You
The Reaper Shall Return
Look Reside You; Walks beside You
The Reaper has Returned
Tonight the Reaper's party is open
Get entrance, get the trance
Forget about the words of warning
Forget about the smell of death
The raft of death now leaves the landing
Waters wipe out space and time
Black man gives a skinless smile
Cold greetings reach your mind
