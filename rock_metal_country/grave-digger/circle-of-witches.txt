The foul smell of evil hangs over the moores. Where in a lonely hut witches dwell. Repelling creatures ageless feared and fitted. With powers from the depths of hell. Once a noble man a baron brother of the king himself. Visited the witches on a dark dark night. He asked assist to gain the throne. He sold his soul to win a fight.
The days getting short and nights getting colder. Winter has come, the sun is too weak. The forcees of night are now growing stronger. Searching for souls for men blind with greed. Three witchees stand in a circle of evil. Tongues speaking words old and unknown. Call for a demon to serve in their dark spell. Fulfill what they owe to get what men own. I'll be king, I want the power, I will change my fate Magic's on my side foreveer, so the witches say Time is right to gane the throne, I'll take my brother down. I'll be king to rule the land, yes I'll take the crown.
I've lost my soul. I've lost control. To the circle of witches. My life is black. There's no way back. From the circle of witches. Circle of witches. Circle of witches. Circle of witches - never again.
Lie in wait, prepared to fight, soon the king must come. Allied with the darkest powers, murder will be done. Loyal soldiers, stand for battle, blinded are their eyes. Witchcraft takes away their sight, as we take their lives. I look at myself, a mirror of darkness. My mind it is drowned, a dark flood of hate. I owe too much to the powers of evil. I know I'm damned, sealed is my fate. For the gloom of gold and glory, I have sold my soul. Blackened are the sunny days, the dark side takes control. Hell awaits as nightmares haunt me, demons in my head. Satan waits with patient joy, he'll greet me when I'm dead.
