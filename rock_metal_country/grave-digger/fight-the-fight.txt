Raging on a warpath, storming through the town
Blowing it to pieces, killing all around
Fighting for existance, looking for a way
Now it's getting harder, it's the price you pay
Black or White - it's no different kind
Black or White - the leader are so lind
Fight The Fight
Fight for Your Right
Fight The Fight
And See The Light
Crossing bloody streets, waiting for attack
Living for a moment, never turning back
Striking down the white, killing all in sight
It's a state of hate, where fires burning bright
