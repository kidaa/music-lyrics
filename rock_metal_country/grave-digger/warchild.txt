I'm fighting, I'm killing, just like a man Standing, defending, a gun in my hand. Look in my eyes, can't you see they're so cold. I'm a fighter, I'ma warrior, I'm twelve years old.
Look like a kid, but I learned how to steal. Play children's games, but my killing is real.Once was a kid, just normal as you were. Then soldiers came, killed and they burned. I lost my home, but I found a gun. I take their livees, just like they have done.
You took my dad, you killed, you stole my youth and,. Took my mum. You raped. I take your lives now.
I'm a little warchild. I kill with an evil smile. I'm a little warchild. I shoot and death you dial.
I 'm fighting. I'm killing, just like a man. Standing, defending, a gun in my hand. Once was a kid, just normal as you were. Then Soldiers came, killed and they burned. I lost my home, but found a gun. I take their lives, just like they have done.
