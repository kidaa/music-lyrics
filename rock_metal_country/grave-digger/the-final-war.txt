Finally their time has come
Face to face on the battlefield
The King's here to judge the deceiver
Open wounds, no riot shield
The seed of hate is bearing fruit
Grapes of wrath of evil root
Blood against blood
Black against white
Dark hanging clouds
Time running out
Blood against blood
Mingeling stream
Fate will decide
Who has to die
War was their life
Traces of pain
All for the reign
The final war
Spirit of life
Fading away
The final day
The final war
The final war
The King stabs the deceiver
His blood drips down the spear
Warning all the power - hungry
The last thing the could do
With Morgane crossing the sea
In Avalon he may find his peace
