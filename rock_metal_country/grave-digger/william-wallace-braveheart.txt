I don't wanna be a hero. But I'll stand and never kneel.
Freedom is well wort a dying. Come we'll fight with heart and steel.
Beat the English at Sterling brigde. I will guard the Scotish throne.
I myself skinned Cressingham. In his own blood he did drown.
Fight - Freedom we fight.
Stand - Scotland's pride.
I am just a simple man. I'm afraid to meet my end.
Braveheart they call me. If they knew if they could see.
Edward's out to seek revenge. His army's great his soldiers strong.
Come with me to fight at Falkirk. Send them back where theyt belong.
I don't have the blood of kings. But I'd die for Scotland's pride.
Even nobles follow me. Into battle side by side.
Nightmares haunt my lonley nights.
I must be strong and I must fight.
Braveheart they call me.
If they knew if they could see. 
.
Vengeance burns a raging anger I have lost the fear to die.
Braveheart that's what I am.I kill until my blood runs dry.
The lust for battle in my veins. inspires me to take your life.
Braveheart that's what I am. I kill until my blood runs dry.
