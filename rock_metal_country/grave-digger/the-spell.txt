The story of Merlin and Nimue, one of Morgane's ladies in waiting. She promised Merlin sex and marriage if he would teach her his black arts. But Nimue just used him, and with his owe magic managed to cast a life - long spell on him, turning him into a rock. Many Knights seeking the Holy Grail later said that they had heard Merlin's voice. In any casy, he was never seen again.
Love made a fool of me
I am betrayed by love
I let her in my secrets, my heart
I still fall for her beauty
And the smell of her skin
Shi gave a meaning to everything
There in the woods she taught me how to touch a girl
I taught her to enchant any person in the world
I feel my end is near
I think I have to die
I pay a high price feeling lust
Between her thighs
I feel my end is near
I thought I knew her will
How could I ever be cast under
My own spell
And now my bride is gone
She finally sealed my fate
I love her more than life, and this is what she takes
A man with a broken heart
Lost the reason to live
Lost in despair with nothing left to give
