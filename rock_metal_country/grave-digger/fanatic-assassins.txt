1I'm the old man of the mountainsleader of
Muslim warriors
I hand them the revelating pipe
Then they know the after-life
Wherever I order suicide
You will sucrifice
Jump, jump off the wall
Allah will receive you all
Fanatic assassins
Fanatic assassins
2You are my war machines
Your minds painted blood-red
I'll wash your souls so white
Invincible in any fight
