Sun turning 'round with graceful motion
We're setting off with soft explosion
Bound for a star with fiery oceans
It's it's so very lonely, you're a hundred light years from home
It's it's so very lonely, you're a hundred light years from home
Freezing red deserts turn to dark
Energy here in every metal heart ?
Energy here in every part
It's it's so very lonely, you're six hundred light years from home
It's it's so very lonely, you're a hundred light years from home
Sun turning 'round with graceful motion
We're setting off with soft explosion
Bound for a star with fiery oceans
It's it's so very lonely, you're a hundred light years from home
It's it's so very lonely, you're a hundred light years from home
Guitar solo
It's it's so very lonely, you're a thousand light years from home
It's it's so very lonely, you're a thousand light years from home
Freezing red deserts turn to dark
Energy here in every metal heart ?
Energy here in every part 
It's it's so very lonely, you're six hundred light years from home
It's it's so very lonely, you're a hundred light years from home
