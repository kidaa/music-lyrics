I still remember, long winter nights.
Frightning stories, of dark and light.
Stories of horror, of life and death.
About a house of horror. That rose from evil's breath.
Voices in the darkness. Calling out my name.
I'm drawn up to the house. Feeling agony and pain.
Welcome to my house of horror Come on in-house of horror.
Welcome to my house of horror. Many have come - few have gone.
The Peaper's madness, there's no escape.
He gives me dreams, there's just a fake. He holds my heart,
fingers cold as ice. He claims my soul as a sacrifice.
