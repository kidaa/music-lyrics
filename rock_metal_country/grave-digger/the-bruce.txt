He came in the dark night. Few men at his side.
Black Douglas' arm for the Bruce. They could not loose.
Stab Red Conym down. He won't wear a crown.
Fight and kill we will. Win the Battle of Louden Hill.
The heart of a lion. The blood of kings.
A sword like thunder. Death he will bring.
I am The Bruce - The King The Lion.
I am The Bruce - The Master of war.
March against me - pay in blood.
I rule forevermore.
The Bruce was crowned at Scone.
His glory shone. Still the English are marching.
We'll meet them at Sterling. One 'gainst three we stand.
Fight for your land. The Battle of Bannockburn A lesson they did
learn. chorus again
