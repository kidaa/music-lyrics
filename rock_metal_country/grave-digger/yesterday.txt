Ref:
Yesterday, when you left me on my own
Yesterday, when you left my heart alone
Yesterday, no, yesterday, no no
Yesterday, when your love was very true
Yesterday, when we knew what to do
Yesterday, no, yesterday, no
Yesterday, in my mind it's still alive
Yesterday, when we were husband and wife
Yesterday, no, yesterday, no
Yesterday, yesterday
Yesterday, yesterday
Yesterday, no, yesterday, no
