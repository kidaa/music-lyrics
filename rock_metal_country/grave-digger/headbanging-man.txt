Dressed in leather, dressed in chains
Full of agression, full of pains
Stage is open, light comes up
Metal kids go mad
Count - down is on for the band
Drunken women, drunken men
Show their hands for fucking arse
They bang their heads
He's a man, he's a kid
Wanna bang with you
Headbanging man
He's man, he's a kid
Wanna bang with you
Headbanging man
Metal music blows your heads
And metal maniacs bang to death
The air roars like a machine gun
Banging devils on the run
The show is over, kids are gone
And fucking people lay alone
Drun too much, they're falling down
It's a headbanging crown

He's a man, he's a kid
Wanna bang with you
Headbanging man
He's a man, he's a kid
Wanna bang with you
Headbanging with you
Headbanging man
