I need you here beside me,
To chase the night sway
I need your love to guide me,
Save through another day
Oh, oh, oh it's my wedding day, oh, oh, oh
Wedding Day - All Night We Gonna Burn
Wedding Day - The Day Of No Return
It's My Wedding Day
She's hyperactive and she's a wild romance
I want to kiss her, but she only wanna dance
I've waited all the time for you
You've broken Promises, I'm just a fool for you
Start trouble, spread pain
Piss and venom in your vains
talk nasty, breath the fire
smell rotten, you're a liar
