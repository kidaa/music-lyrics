Tonight I had a weird dream.
I saw a demon eating men.
he crushed Skulls to dust.
His eyes filled with a black lust.
The demon rules the battlefield.
Religion rules with pain and steel.
God is love. Hell is open.
Searching for the truth.
Searching for eternal life.
Searching for the truth.
You reach heaven but you're.
Headed for hell.
I've seen brother fighting brother I've seen friends kill each other.
Love is preached to manking. Just believe death you'll find.
