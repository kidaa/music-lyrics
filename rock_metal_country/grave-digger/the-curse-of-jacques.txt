1You say that we sold our soul to the devil, that we're out of control
Your torture my brothers, torture my sisters, kill all friends
You say that we worship a god, like a cat, a devil in disguise
You execute my family, steal their breath, and burn them till death
I'm burning, I'm dying,
I'm burning, I'm dying,
Oh Lord, won't you help me
I'm burning, I'm dying,
When I feel my end is near
When I feel the reaper's here
Crackling fire I can hear
When I feel my end is near
When I feel the reaper's here
I watch the demons
Dancing round my tears
2I'm innocent - it's not true I never prayed
We will all be treated the same way at Doomsday
I curse Pope and King - you won't make it another year
The Last Judgement will decide who was wrong or who was right
