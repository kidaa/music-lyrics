4:22
Live in darkest dreams; drugs roam in my head. Nothing's like it seems; still the blood is red. Myself is what I hate; my living and my lie. I blow to my fate; never try.
I hate myself, don't call my name. Hate is strong, hate is black, Kills the light,no way back.
Don't go my way. Don't go this way. Oh God help me. Here's the road that leads to hate.
The shit of all the years, it lies upon my soul . Depressions and my fears, things I can't control. The days are painted grey, I never see the light. I throw myself away, give up, never fight. The sun somtimes shines, upoon my wretched mind. But I just close my eyes, and hate is what I find. Hope is what I need, despair is what I find. Hate is what I feed, hate is what I live.
