Well we got no choice
all the girls and boys
makin' all that noise
'cause they found new toys
Oh, we can't salute you
can't find a flag
if that don't suit you
that's a drag
School's out for summer
School's out forever
School's been blown to pieces
No more pencils, no more books
no more teacher's dirty looks
Well we got no class
and we got no principles
and we got no innocence
we can't think of a word that rhymes
No more pencils, no more books
no more teacher's dirty looks
out for summer, out 'til fall
we aren't comin' back at all
School's out for summer
School's out forever
School's out with fever
