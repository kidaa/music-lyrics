Shape your eyes and watch them burn
There's always fire 'round the night
I want to grown into yourself
Wiping out the wise below
Watch you change into a star
I want to gaze into a mirror
Shape your eyes and watch them burn
There's always fire 'round the night
Always fire where you're going to
Heart attack, heart attack
Heart attack, heart attack
Watch your eyes and watch them burn
Fire's always 'round with you
I want to grow into your soul
Shape your eyes and watch them burn
There's always fire 'round the night
I want to crawl into a mirror
Wipeing out the wise below
What you know it's you're alone
I remember everybody, too

Watch your eyes and watch them burn
There's fire always 'round with you
I want to burn into yourself
Shape your eyes and watch them burn
There's always fire 'round the night
I want to crawl into your door
Shape your eyes and watch them burn
There's always fire 'round the night
'Member what you'd always going to
Ref.
What you blow is always fire
Where you're bend, you're still alone
Always fire 'part from that, it's true
Heart attack
