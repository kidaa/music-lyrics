3:30
When the war is over,
Darkness all around
No government, no industry
The world is upside down
Out in the fields, red lights
Fade to black
No presidents, no majesties
The sun comes never back
Higher and higher - straight to the sky
Higher and higher - straight to the sky
Higher and higher - Alohar
Higher and higher - straight to the sky
Higher and higher - Alohar
Ride On - Ride On
Hear what Isay, true of another lie?
Jesus comes and Jesus goes
Nobody can deny
Follow the sign and march to paradise
You can lose or you can win
You only must survive
