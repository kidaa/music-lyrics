3:39
You're living in a world of sin
Eyes like a blood red sky
You know how you feel
The speed of light trapped in your eyes
The world around you
It's not thePromised land
"H" comes to rule the world
"H" comes to rule the world
Ruler Mr.H.
Ruler Mr.H.
Ruler Mr.H.
Ruler Mr.H.
Ruler
You look into the past
Lost dreames of broken hearts
You fool, it's up to you
Change your way to a better life
