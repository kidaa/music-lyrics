By Chris Boltendahl
Don't you deny the life you'll be living
Could right now be over and away
Look and see your foolish behaviour
It's just your arrogance in the way
Can't go on wasting you future
By killing the environment
And nature won't survive explotation
I live in such fear of the end
Shine on
Horizen's low
Shine on
Cold winds blow
Shine on
Freezing snow
Shine on
The future will be cold
Cold as ice
No bright sunny days
Only nights
How can life go on here on earth
Stop the light of day
Smog alert
Every shining star fades away
It' the planet earth
Dark and grey
