1A bloody Friday October 13th
Inquisition takes its course
King Philipp's armed force
Templars are blamed for conjuration
They are said to be heretics
And coursed by the catholics
Because they didn't save Jerusalem
Are you the one
Who's into blasphemy
You better run
Escape from agony
Are you the one
Believing in Baphomet
Make your confession
And you will be free
2Seeking the hidden treasures
The Pope is taking measures
Persecution spreads all over Europe
