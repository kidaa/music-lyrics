The story of Arthur's final resting place, the journey to the Fairy Island, the sword of Excalibur, which Percival bequeathed to the Lady of the Lake. It is still not known today where King Arthur lies.
On the way to Avalon
Excalibur will go on
Saved from the evil, true to the drake
Kept by the lady of the lake
Screaming
Bleeding
Dying
Screaming
Bleeding
Flying
Avalon
Enchanting land of fairytales
Avalon
Heavenly mysteries are
Unveiled
Avalon
Close your eyes and just
Dream on
Avalon
Giving shelter from the storm
Sail away into the misty grey
Under escort of Morgane le fay
Silently sliding on the sea
Abandoning mortality
