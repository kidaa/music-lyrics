Fight for God's country.
Stand strong, pride you feel.
Obey march, raise your banners.
Kill die in the fields of steel.
Truth faith, what you fight for.
Kill rape, eternal glory.
Blood gore, shining heroes.
Spell write a bloody history.
We fight, we kill we die.
We play, we dance. To a symphony of death.
Wars pride, waving colours.
Pain Death, final solution.
Look see what are we doing.
Kill die for false illusions.
Tears fall for dying children.
No more human sanity.
Take life, sacrifice your child.
