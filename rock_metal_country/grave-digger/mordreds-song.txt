The story of Arthur's avaricious nephew, who lusted after Arthur's kingdom, and then ensnared and flattered him. Arthur trusted Mordred, and was fair to him and allowed him to do as he wished. But Mordred abused his power and provoked Arthur into going to war.
Bound to ride to Camelot
Heading for the throne
Pretending integrity
Too late one will know
Day by day at Arthur side
Playing his role
Day by day at Arthur side
Closer to his goal
Warrior with royal blood
Longing for the reign
Descended from a witches breed
Witchcraft in his veins
Leader of the underworld
Ruler of the night
Deceiver of kings
Deceiver of knights
Keeper of the secret reich
Keeper of the light
I am mordred king of the night
The nephew is a viper
No one realizes
His tongue spares the truth
His eyes hypnotize
He injects the poison slowly
Starts to mesmerize
Gathering the troops around him
All are magnetized
