You've got the feeling, turn on the lights.
You feel the power rising, lightning strikes the sky Six million people
wanna see the band.
The hit the stage tonight, guitars in our hands.
Watch out -- We're back-back to the roots.
Heavy metal rules. We're back-back to the roots.
Heavy metal. --
You've got the rythm, we've got the beat.
We turn the music loud, burn in the heat.
Look to the left, look to the right.
Look into my eye, I'm ready to fight.
