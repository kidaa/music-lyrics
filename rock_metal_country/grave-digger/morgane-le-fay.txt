My ruby eyes can see
All secrets and stories never told
With shadows I dance
Sombre castle, Soul aglow
I have the power
I have the might
Morgan Le Fly
When I felt my father death
The dragon put my mother in disgrace
Down by the fireplace
Sowed seed of my evil ways
Don't mess with me
Do not cross my way
Or you may play a part
In my malicious game
I am the the devil in disguise
I bring the evil to your life
Listen, lesten - listen what I say
My name is Morgane Le Fay
I spoil all happiness
I reveal unvarnished truth
Call me the Black Nun
I am invincible, I never lose
