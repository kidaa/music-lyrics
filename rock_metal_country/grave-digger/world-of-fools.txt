Let's try reaching for the sky.
Hang on and you're gonna die.
Our lives can turn so sweet.
Child with an innocent smile.
Destroys me all the while.
Don't be fooled when he cries.
You sit there watching all go down.
Live your life to a different sound.
You fought for freedom, you're fighting still.
You'll never get fortune, pay your bill.
More lies, more promises.
We all live in a World of Fools.
More lies, more promises.
We all live in a World of Fools.
In a World of Fools.
Nobody comes to show you a line.
Open your eyes and find the sign.
And now you're seventy, to old to die.
More and more you accept that's all a lie.
