*odd grunt*

Speaking as a guy who's really 
Got it going on, 
It's only natural, 
It's only me. 

Take it from a fella 
Who's been 'round the block 
So many times he's knows the only parking spot that's free. 
It's only me. 

You can say I've tried everything 
I'd save on the wedding ring 
Who knows me half as well as me? 

I'm not anti-social 
And it's nothing that's reproachful 
It's just natural, 
It's only me. 

I can't think of anybody else I'd rather 
Spend some one on one time with, 
It's not that hard to see, 
It's only me. 

I'm the me in monogamy 
I'm not asking a lot of me 
I give me R-E-S-P-E-C-T. 

And if your heart is broken 
You can just do what you do best 
You can just do what you do, 
When your heart is broken 
Trust in the one who loves you 
Never put others above you 

I thought I was using me 
To get to you 
But this is true. 
I'm natural, it's only me. 

They say you'll never love another 
'Til you love yourself, 
Well, brother I'm in love with everyone I see. 
It's only me. 

You could say I've tried every thing 
I'd save on the wedding ring 
Who knows me half as well as me? 
I'm the me in monogamy 
I'm not asking a lot of me 
I give me R-E-S-P-E-C-T.
