Uncle Elwyn

It's Uncle Elwyn
It's Uncle Elwyn
My Uncle Elwyn is tall
My Elwyn is small
My Elwyn plays a mean basketball
He's about 45 maybe 55, 60
I'm not sure; once he mixed me a drink
I was about 5 years old
It was Koolaid and pop
I thought that was cold
Cold meaning good
Cold's supposed to be bad but i think that I otta would
Change some things,I change their meanings
I've been here, I've been demeaning
Once, twice, maybe three times
I asked my Uncle Elwyn he's a mime
Ask Uncle Elwyn
Ask Uncle Elwyn
E-L-W-Y-N that's Elwyn, say it again
E-L-W-Y-N that's Elwyn, say it again
E-L-W-Y-N that's Elwyn, sing it again
E-L-W-Y-N that's Elwyn, that's my uncle!
