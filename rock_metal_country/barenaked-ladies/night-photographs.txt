Night Photographs 

At night I like to photograph, producing camera images 
And I don't have a flash 
But my little notebook records the subjects at hand 

In photo one, a flower 
Photo two is a drunk and naked girl 
In photo three is my dog in the backyard 
Each frame captures the various subtleties of black 
Each frame captures the various subtleties of black 
Subtleties of black 
Subtleties of black

But my little notebook records the subjects at hand 
yeeeaaaaaa haaaaaa!
