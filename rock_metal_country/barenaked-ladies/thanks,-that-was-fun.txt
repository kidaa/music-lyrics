I'm learning, I'm yearning 
I'm burning, all your stuff 
But that's not enough. 
I'm faking, that I'm aching 
Mistaking lust for love. 

Thanks, that was fun 
Don't forget, no regrets 
Except maybe one. 

Did I scare you? 
When I dared you? 
I stared you in the eye 
And told you goodbye. 

You mock me, 
It shocked me, 
When you walked me to the bus. 

Thanks, that was fun 
Don't forget, no regrets 
Except maybe one. 
Made a deal not to feel 
God, that's dumb 

Everybody knows the deal fell through. 
I was hoping I could just blame you. 
When was it that I became so soft? 
This sentimentality doesn't look good on me. 
I thought that you would be begging to be with me. 
I'm the one on my knees blubbering please let me stay. 

Deflated, and jaded. 
I hated when you called which isn't at all. 
I've spoken, though broken. 
Here's a token of my love. 

Thanks, that was fun 
Don't forget, no regrets 
Except maybe one. 
Made a deal not to feel 
God, that was dumb 
Don't forget, no regrets 
Except maybe one. 
Made a deal not to feel 
Thanks, that was fun.
