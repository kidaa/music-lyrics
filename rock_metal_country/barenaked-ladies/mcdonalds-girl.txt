I leave from softball practice every night
It's getting dark, but the  Golden Arches  light up the way
I turn the corner at the traffic light
I count my money and then 
I rehearse what I'm going to say

 I'd like an order of fries, a quarter-pounder with cheese,
I love the light in your eyes, will you go out with me please? 

I am in love with a McDonald's girl
She has a smile of innocence so tender and warm
I am in love with a McDonald's girl
She is an angel in a polyester uniform

[Can I get you some fries with that?]

She doesn't try to impress anyone
She doesn't act real tough 
like all the other girls that I know
She don't treat me like a simpleton
She's not ashamed to be the only other virgin I know
And when my hamburger's cold, I get up ready to go,
She's only fifteen years old, and I'm in love with her so

She's got a gold tooth, you know she's hardcore
She'll show you a good time, then she'll show you the door, boy!

I am in love with a McDonald's girl
She has a smile of innocence so tender and warm
I am in love with a McDonald's girl
She is an angel in a polyester uniform

Well, there she stands behind the register
She's taking orders from the Saddle River Little League
If they knew how much I wanted her
Their home-room teachers would 
have to send them home for a week

And as I head through the door, the movement catches her eye,
My heart begins to soar she smiles she waves good-bye, good-bye
Good-bye, good bye

I am in love with a McDonald's girl
She has a smile of innocence so tender and warm
I am in love with a McDonald's girl
She is an angel in a polyester uniform

Uno, dos, tres, quatro
Big Mac, Filet o Fish, Quarter Pounder, French Fries
Icey Coke, Thick Shakes, Sundaes and Apple Pies
Sing that song of taste [Yeah, sing that song of taste!]
You can only find at one place, McDonalds

I am in love with a McDonald's girl
She has a smile of innocence so tender and warm
I am in love with a McDonald's girl
She is an angel in a polyester uniform
