It was often talked about
It was often raised
But nothing was ever done about it
To hear the way they talked about it
Noone could be saved
But nothing was ever done about it

Shall I take back everything I've ever said
And live my whole life in silence instead?

It was oversimplified
It was underthought
And nothing was ever done to stop it
Everything was fortified by
All the lies we bought
And nothing was ever done to stop it

Shall I take back everything I've ever said
And live my whole life in silence instead?

Shall I take back everything I've ever said
Shall I take back all my attacks? All of my accusations?
And live my whole life in silence instead?
All my mistrust - we never discussed anyone's reservations

There was a time
When a crime was a crime
Now I think I'm losing my mind
Or taking it all too hard
Taking it all too hard
Taking it all too hard

Shall I take back all my attacks? All of my accusations?
All my mistrust - we never discussed anyone's reservations

Shall I take back everything I've ever said
Shall I take back all my attacks? All of my accusations?
And live my whole life in silence instead?
All my mistrust - we never discussed anyone's reservations

Shall I take back everything I've ever said
Shall I take back all my attacks? All of my accusations?
And live my whole life in silence instead?
All my mistrust - we never discussed anyone's reservations

Maybe you're right
Maybe you're right
Maybe you're right
But I don't think so
Maybe you're right
Maybe you're right
Maybe you're right
But I don't think so
