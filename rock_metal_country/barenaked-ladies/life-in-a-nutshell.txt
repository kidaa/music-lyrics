When she was three 
Her Barbies always did it on the first date
Now she's with me, 
There's never any need for them to demonstrate

She's like a baby, I'm like a cat;
When we are happy, we both get fat and still
It's never enough, It's never enough,
It's never enough

[Chorus]
But I don't tend to worry 'bout the things that other people say
And I'm learning that I wouldn't want it any other way
Call me crazy but it really doesn't matter
All that matters to me is she

Her life in a nutshell
No way would she want it to change me
It's not that easy 'cause 
My time is often decided for me
For me

She memorized every pencil crayon color in the box
Her blue-green eyes complement the burnt sienna in her locks
She's at the movies, I'm on the phone;
When we're separated, we're never alone, but still
It's never enough, It's never enough,
No it's never enough

[Chorus]

Her life in a nutshell
No way would she want it to change me
It's not that easy 'cause 
My time is often decided for me
For me

I fell down with no one there to catch me from falling
Then she came 'round
And only her tenderness stopped me from bawling my eyes out
I'm OK, and that's why

Her life in a nutshell
No way would she want it to change me
It's not that easy 'cause 
My time is often decided for me
For me

[Chorus]
