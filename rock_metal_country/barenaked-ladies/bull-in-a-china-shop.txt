I'm a kid in a candy store
I'm a bull in a china shop
I'm a tired old metaphor
For everything you can't afford
And everything you can't afford to be

I'm a public embarrassment
I'm a bottle of diet poison
I'm a walking advertisement
For everything I never meant
And everything I never meant to be

I can't hear a thing
Cause I've stopped listening

I'm the reason I don't go out
I'm afraid I might tell me something
I'm the shadow of every doubt
I'm the product this song's about
I'm the product this song's about to be

I can't hear a thing
Cause I've stopped listening
I can't hear a thing
Cause I've stopped listening

Every morning
Since I was born
It's been hard to look in the mirror
And see my face for the horns

All the fun that the law allows
All the fun but with half the meaning
Come on over, I'll show you how
If you lived here you'd be home by now
If you still lived here you'd be home now with me

I can't hear a thing
Cause I've stopped listening
I can't hear a thing
Cause I've stopped listening
