Shoe Box 
Words by Steven Page   Ed Robertson 
Music by Steven Page 

A key in the door, a step on the floor 
A note on the table, and a meal in the micro 
Note says "I'm in bed, please make sure that you're fed 
if you're taking a shower, you can borrow my bathrobe 
When I'm asleep I dream you move in next week" 
I crumple the note and save it to put inside 

Chorus: 
My shoe box 
Shoe box of lies 
Shoe box 
Shoe box of lies 

it's under my bed, it's never been read 
it's in with my school stuff and my mom never cleans there 
From my first little fib, when I still wore a bib 
To my latest attempt at pretending I'm someone 
Who's not seventeen, doesn't know what you mean 
When talk turns to single malts, or stilton, or 

Chorus 

Did somebody tell you 
This is how it's supposed to be? 
Or did you just find it 
And you don't want any more from me? 

Chorus 

Was it something I said, or was it something you read 
That's making me think that I should never have come here 
I can offer you lies, I can tell you good-bye. 
I can tell you I'm sorry, But I can't tell you the truth, dear 
And what if I could -- would it do any good? 
You'll still never get to see the contents of 

Chorus

You're so nineteen-ninety 
And it's nineteen-ninety-four 
Leave this world behind me 
'Cause you don't want me anymore.
