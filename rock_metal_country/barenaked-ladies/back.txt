I woke up yesterday morning
Fell down two flights of stairs
Well I thought I was wide awake but my legs were still asleep.

Nine-one-one ambulance help me
But I can't reach the phone
So I scream to the neighbors  Come over break into my home 

I broke my back
There was nobody there to help me
Broke my back
All the lies and deception won't change the perception that
I fell flat on my ass

I wish this had happened skydiving
That my parachute failed
But a pair of shoes tripped me down stairs and I lay there and wail

Those things I used to take for granted
Now I take sitting down
I can't brush my teeth, chew my nails, give the finger to a clown

I broke my back
And I can't even change the channels
Broke my back
I fell flat on my ass

Well they tell me that I shouldn't get discouraged
But they tell me that I'll never walk again
And they say I'm gonna need alot of courage
And they say I'm gonna need alot of friends

But what I really need is a pair of electric legs.
So I wish some genius would just invent them.
And if they cost to much I'd share with someone else.
Or I would scour the Yellow Pages and I'd rent them.

I know I can probably pop a wheely
Entertaining the kids
I can put hockey cards in the spokes I can even throw skids

I get a good seat at a concert
Even get stuff for free
Is it cause I'm an excellent guy or cause they're scared of me

I broke my back
And I can't even use the clapper
I broke my back
All the lies and deception won't change the perception that
I fell flat on my ass
