Break Your Heart 
Words   Music by Steven Page 

The bravest thing I've ever done 
Was to run away and hide 
But not this time, not this time 
And the weakest thing I've ever done 
Was to stay right by your side 
Just like this time, and every time 
I couldn't tell you I was happy when you were gone 
So I lied and said that I missed you when we were apart. 
I couldn't tell you, so I had to lead you on 
But I didn't mean to break your heart. 

And if I always seem distracted 
Like my minds somewhere else, 
That's because it's true, yes it's true 
it's this stupid pride that makes me feel 
Like I have to follow through 
Even half-assedly, loving you 
Why must I always speak in terms of cowardice? 
When I guess I should have just come out and told you right from the start 
Why must I always tell you all I want is this? 
I guess 'cause I didn't want to break your heart 

And you said; 
"What'd you think that I was gonna do, 
Curl up and die just because of you? 
I'm not that weak, you know 
What'd you think that I was gonna do, 
Try to make you love me as much as I love you? 
how could you be so low? 
You arrogant man, 
What do you think that I am? 
My heart will be fine 
Just stop wasting my time" 

And now I know that you will be okay, and that I 
got what I want and that's rid of you 
Good bye 
And it's not cause I'll be missing you 
That makes me fall apart 
it's just that I didn't mean to break 
No I didn't mean to break 
No I didn't mean to break 
Your heart
