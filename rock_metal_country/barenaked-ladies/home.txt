Side of the road, I stopped and
Picked up the pieces of your car
You were just standing, speechless
Knowing you'd never travel far

That's what you do when someone's given up on you
And that's when I knew that I was giving up and giving in
That's when I knew where I was
That's when I knew that I was home

Stuck in the middle of the road
For better or worse, we compromise
You may have won my hand, dear
But it was the consolation prize

That's when I knew that I was running out on you
That's what you do when time is running out and running down
That's when I knew where I was
That's when I knew that I was home

Where does the heart reside
If not where I lay my head?
I could run but I'm petrified
And choose this instead
Again and again

End of the road I'm running
And look back to survey where I'd been
Someday I'll write and ask you
If you could imagine what I'd seen

How could you think that I could turn my back on you?
How did you think this would be turning out? And turning 'round
What could I do but you?
What could I do to call this home?

That's when I knew where I was
That's when I knew that I was home
