One, two..
I was surprised at how incredibly fast you were
to come up and ask for a light
I was amazed at just how matter of fact you were
in taking me back for the night
I only crave the sugar on the pill
I hope that you will


Trust me, trust me 
To let you down,
You know that somebody got there first
Trust me, trust me 
To let you down,
My fingers crossed while my lips are pursed
Trust me,
I don't know where I'm going, 
you can drop me there

Don't understand how the roles are reversed
and now it's me that's freaked out by the chase
The holy trinity are there in your purse:
a condom, Obsession, and mace
It's easier if I'm on my way
So anyway you'll..

Trust me, trust me 
to let you down,
You know that somebody got there first
Trust me, trust me 
to let you down,
My fingers crossed while my lips are pursed
Trust me,
I don't know where I'm going, 
you can drop me there

I want you, you want me
I want you not to want me
I need you to need me
To leave me
Needing you to leave

Trust me, trust me 
to let you down,
You know that somebody got there first
Trust me, trust me 
to let you down,
My fingers crossed while my lips are pursed
Trust me,
I don't know where I'm going, 
you can drop me there

Trust me,
Trust me to let you down
Trust me to let you down
Trust me to let you down
Trust me to let you down
