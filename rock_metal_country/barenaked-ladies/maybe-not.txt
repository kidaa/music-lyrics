Pretty soon you will be wanting me 
To go. 
And I will only be the enemy 
I know. 
Pretty soon you will be needing me 
To leave. 
But know that you and I will always be 
Naive. 

Maybe you'll forgive the things that I forgot. 
Maybe you're forgetting all the times we fought. 
Maybe we should divvy up the things we bought. 
But maybe not. 

Why don't we lay down on the kitchen floor 
All that we say we had with us before? 
We'll find our way to what we're looking for 
By seperating what is mine from yours. 

Pretty soon I'll be the one you hold 
At bay. 
And then forever I'll be good as gold 
If I may. 
I know your heart cannot be bought or sold 
For much. 
Darlin' I'd consider yourself told 
In Dutch. 

And we can argue 'till our throats are sore 
About how far you take a metaphor. 
You always deign to see the glass half filled 
And now it seems to me the half glass spilled. 

Maybe you'll forgive the things that I forgot. 
Maybe you're forgetting all the times we fought. 
Maybe we should divvy up the things we bought. 
But maybe 

Maybe you'll forgive the things that I forgot. 
Maybe you're forgetting all the times we fought. 
Maybe we should divvy up the things we bought. 
But maybe not. 
Maybe not. 
Maybe not
