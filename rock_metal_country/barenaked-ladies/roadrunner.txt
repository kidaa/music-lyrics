Roadrunner

I'm Steve, and I'm Ed, 
And we're Barenaked Ladies 

You're on a highway and roadrunner goes "Beep, beep" 
Just step aside or you might end up in a heap 
Roadrunner roadrunner runs on the road all day 
Even the coyote can't make him change his ways 

Roadrunner, that coyote's after you 
Roadrunner, if he catches you, you're through 

That coyote's really a crazy clown 
When will he learn that he never can hold you down? 
Roadrunner roadrunner never bothers anyone 
Runnin' down the road is his idea of havin' fun 

Roadrunner, that coyote's after you 
Roadrunner, if he catches you, you're through 

Roadrunner, that coyote's after you 
Roadrunner, if he catches you, you're through 
If he catches you, you're through 
If he catches you, you're through
