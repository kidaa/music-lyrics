Made of snow, I don't know
How I fit in
To and fro, people go
I stand and grin
Way to go, even though
I can't begin
Made of snow, I don't know
How I fit in

Ever cold, love untold
I don't belong
Have and hold, so untold
I think they're wrong
Heart of gold, grownin' old
Just like the song
Ever cold, love untold
I don't belong

Button eyes, lullabys,
I melt away
Criticized, compromised
White turns to grey
I'm paralyzed, otherwise
I'd leave today
Button eyes, lullabys,
I melt away

Made of snow, I don't know
How I fit in
Ever cold, love untold
I don't fit in
Button eyes, lullabys,
I don't fit in
Made of snow, I don't know
How I fit in
