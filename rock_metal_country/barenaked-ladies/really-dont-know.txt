I'm well aware there's a bit of a problem

Where is this thing that I call heaven?
What is it doing here on earth?
Who is this holding my umbrella?
Who is this looking up your skirt?

You always wear it with a sense of style
I like to wear it with a smirk
You make me wait for just a little while
I open up my mouth and yell

I'm home, you're home, I'm all alone
Why can't I call you on the phone?
I really don't know
I'm home, you're home, we're all alone
Why can't I call you on the phone?

You always wear it with a sense of style
I like to wear it with a skirt
I'll be ok in just a little while
And I open my big mouth and yell

Did you laugh? Did you cry?
Did you say my name with a bit of a sigh?
I really don't know
Did you laugh? Did you cry?
Did you say my name with a bit of a sigh?

Take off, to the great white north
Take off, it's a beauty way to go
Take off, to the great white north
Take off, it's a beauty way to go
Bob   Doug loon calls

Where is this thing that I call heaven?
Did you laugh at that?

What is it doing here on earth?
Did you cry?
Who is this holding my umbrella?
Did you say my name with a sigh?
Who is this looking up your skirt?
