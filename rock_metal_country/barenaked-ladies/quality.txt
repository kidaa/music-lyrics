Just show me the venue 
When I'm the menu 
It's personalized 
The life of the party 
I'm like Billy Barty 
But regular-sized 
I guess I should explain 
Your guests will go insane 
For me 

'Cause I'm serving up quality 
It can't be beat 
If you're not down 
Vote with your feet 
My quality, biology 
Enhanced with high technology 

Over in England 
Everything bent 
But I'm satisfied 
I hung with the stars there 
You know they drive cars there 
On the other side 
They barely noticed me 
You said you'd go with me 
Always 

'Cause I'm serving up quality 
It can't be beat 
If you're not down 
Vote with your feet 
My quality, biology 
Inspired some Greek mythology 

It's all true cross my heart and hope to die 
I swear to you stick a needle in your eye 
And if you've been misled 
May some lightning strike me dead 

Back Japan, they 
Did not understand, they 
Sent me back here 
But look at them now, they're 
Rubbing my cow, there 
And feeding it beer 
I may go back someday 
They'll have a huge buffet 
For me 

'Cause I'm serving up quality 
It can't be beat 
If you're not down 
Vote with your feet 
My quality, mirology 
Is studied in theology 

It's quality 
It can't be beat 
If you're not down 
Vote with your feet 
My quality, biology 
Enhanced with high technology
