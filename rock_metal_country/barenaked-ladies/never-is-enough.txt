What, am I to wake up suddenly and then
enroll at the local college, earn me a degree
and I could work weekends
If I've worked real hard
I could mow your back yard

I can go to Europe, travel with my friends
I can blow a thousand deutsche marks
to get drunk in a pub with some Australians
Buy a giant backpack
sew a flag on the back

I think never is enough yeah never is enough
I never want to do that stuff
I think never is enough yeah never is enough
You never have to do that stuff

I never had to spend a summer planting trees
I never worked my way through a forest inch by inch
doubled over on my hands and knees
I never spent a single day in retail
telling people what they want to hear
telling people anything to make a sale
Eating in the food court
with the old and the bored

I think never is enough yeah never is enough
I never want to do that stuff
I think never is enough yeah never is enough
You never have to do that stuff

The worlds your oyster shell
But what's that funny smell
You eat the bivalve anyway
you're sick with salmonella
You get your Ph.D
How happy you will be
When you get a job at Wendy's
And are honored with employee of the month

I think never is enough yeah never is enough
I never want to do that stuff
I think never is enough yeah never is enough
You never have to do that stuff
