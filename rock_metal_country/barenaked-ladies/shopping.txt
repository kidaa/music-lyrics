[CHORUS:]
Well you know that it's going to be alright
I think it's gonna be alright
Everything will always be alright
When we go shopping

Well you know that it's going to be alright
When we go shopping
It's always lalalalala...
Shopping spree begin
It's always lalalalala...
Everybody wins

So shutup
And never stop
Let's shop
Until we drop

[CHORUS]

It's always lalalalala... 
Shopping never end
It's always lalalalala...
Shopping with our friends
Shopping once again

It's always lalalalala... [x4]

It's never enough
Until you've got all the stuff
When the going gets rough
Just shop with somebody tough

[CHORUS x2]

It's always...
When we go shopping [x3]

It's always lalalalala... [repeat to fade]
