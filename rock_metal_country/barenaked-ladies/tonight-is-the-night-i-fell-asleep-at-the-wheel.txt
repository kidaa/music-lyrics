Tonight Is The Night I Fell Asleep At The Wheel 

Driving home to be with you 
The highway's dividing, the city's in view 
As usual, I'm almost on time 
You're the last thing that's on my mind 
I wish I could tell you the way that I feel 
But tonight is the night I fell asleep at the wheel 

No commotion, no screaming brakes 
Most of it's over before I awake 
From the ceiling, my coffee cup drips 
While out my window, the horizon does flips 
The worst part was hitting the ground - 
Not the feeling so much as the sound 
Can't help but wonder if all this is real 
Cause tonight is the night I fell asleep at the wheel 

Rubberneck traffic and passersby 
And Slow Motion Walter the fire engine guy 
Stand around with their mouths open wide 
I heard some idiot ask if someone's inside 
With the Jaws of Life they tried and they tried 
Nobody here can know how I feel 
Cause tonight is the night I fell asleep at the wheel 

I guess it's over now 
Cause I've never seen so much 
Never seen so much, never seen so much 
Never seen so much, never seen so much 
I guess it's over now 
Cause I've never seen so much 
Never seen so much, never seen so much 
Never seen so much, never seen so much 
So much blood 

In all the confusion, there's something serene 
I'm just a posthumous part of the scene 
Now I'm floating above looking in 
As the radio blares and wheels spin 
I can see my face slump with a grin 
And you...you're the last thing on my mind 
You're the last thing on my mind 
You're the last thing on my mind 
You're the last thing on my mind
