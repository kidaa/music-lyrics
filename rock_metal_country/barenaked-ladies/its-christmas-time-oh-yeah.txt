Now that all the snow has fallen
It's crunching in below my feet
And all the Christmas lights are shining 
On houses up and down my street
And I can see the happy families inside
If only for a moment, it's Christmas time

I think I see the children down the street
Here they come caroling
Now we can hear them, they sing  Oh yeah 

Mr. Johnson bought a Christmas tree
He set it up with his family
They're opening their presents big and small
Mr. Johnson got a big, brown, bowling ball
And Sally got a pair of brand new skates
And Jimmy got a box of frosty flakes
He knows that there's a special little prize inside
What a happy moment, it's Christmas time

The carolers are standing in line
They sing,  Oh yeah 
Oh yeah
