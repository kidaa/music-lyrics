It couldn't happen to a better man
It wouldn't happen with a better plan
While we were napping someone else began
To rule the world with love

It didn't happen to us overnight
Just cause it happened doesn't mean it's right
To our embarrassment we lost the fight
To rule the world with love

Hearts are won, empires fall
In love with love
Love will conquer all for one
One for all is fair in love and war
Love and war are one

It couldn't happen to a nicer guy
You shouldn't ever have to question why
With just the power of suggestion I
Could rule the world with love

I need to love you with an iron fist
I need to love you with a secret list
I need to love you 'til you don't exist
And rule the world with love

Love
Love
Love as defined by who?

Hearts are won, empires fall
In love with love
Love will conquer all for one
One for all is fair in love and war
Love and war are one

How could it happen when we couldn't lose?
And now we're slapping makeup on the bruise
Though it was handed to us, we refused
To rule the world with love

Love
Love
Love as defined by God

Hearts are won, empires fall
In love with love
Love will conquer all for one
One for all is fair in love and war
Love and war are one
