Someone somewhere has unglued our epoxy
And now I'm kissing you by proxy
Hope you don't mind
Somewhere someone is dreaming of me
Tries to love me, hope you don't mind

I love you
Intermittently
I love you intermittently

She's a lot like you but she don't look like you
Okay, she's not you
But she'll do fine
I got my life on hold just to avoid confrontation
But should I tell you to your face and
Risk my hide

I love you
Intermittently
I love you intermittently
When immeasurably
Turns to intermittently
There's no use in going on
Except for fear of being wrong
Every morning I just hit the ground yawning...
Stick around if you enjoy disaster
'Cause if you can't see what I'm after
You must be blind

I love you
Intermittently
I love you intermittently

Didn't have the heart to say goodbye
So I continued in my charlatan ways
Did I say heart
I meant to say guts
Now I'm on my own and I'm sorry that you're gone
