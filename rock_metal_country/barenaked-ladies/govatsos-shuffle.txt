Well Andrew Govatsos he's our man 
He cooks his dinners in a frying pan 
I sang that once, I'll sing it again 
Andrew Govatsos, he's our man 

Andrew, he's got really nice hair 
He's got very nice shoes down there 
Down near the ground where he walks 
You should hear the way that he talks 

He could wack you up because he's got a guy Govatsos! 
He's got something stuck in his eye Govatsos! 
He's a fan of Barenaked Ladies Govatsos! 
We like him because he is the greatyest
