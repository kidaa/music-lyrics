Don't call me a zero
I'm gonna be a hero
Like Phil Esposito or the Kennedys

I'll be incorporated
And I'll be imitated
And overrated, but that doesn't bother me

All the jaws will drop
And all the girls will scream
And there will be commotion when I show up on the scene

All that you will see is a celebrity [x2]

When I'm riding in my limo
I won't look out the window
Might make me homesick for humanity

There's nowhere that I can't go
And there's nobody I don't know
And there's an emptiness that's eating me

All the clocks will stop
And all the jeans will cream
It has always been my one and only dream

All that's left of me is my celebrity [x2]

Leave your heart
Lay down your art
You're here for the party
Smile and wave
Try to behave
Be happy that they've made you a celebrity

I could disappear into the great unknown
And it would wear my face as if it were its own

And all that you will see is a celebrity
All that's left of me is my celebrity
I will get in first and I will get in free
All that's left of me is my celebrity
