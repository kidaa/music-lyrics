A rabbit and a top hat, a handkerchief and ring
With the wave of a wand he'll pull your heartstrings

He's a magician
Hoping, wishing
And you're the one vanishing

Isn't that the necklace he found behind your ear?
He's floating upside-down below a chandelier
Wishing he had the power to make you reappear

He's a magician
Hoping, wishing
And you're the one vanishing

All the words of love he longs for you to hear
He whispers them each night into a lion's ear
Under the stage lights at the Bellagio
He has got your card but you had to fly home

He's a magician
Hoping, wishing
And you're the one vanishing

You are vanishing
You are vanishing
You are vanishing
You are vanishing

He's a magician
Hoping, wishing
And you're the one
You're the one
You're the one vanishing

You are vanishing
You are vanishing
You are vanishing a rabbit and a top hat, a handkerchief and ring
You are vanishing the wave of the wand
