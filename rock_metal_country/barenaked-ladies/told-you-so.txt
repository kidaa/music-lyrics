I never jumpted in and rescued you,
but I wanted to
I didn't tell you which way to go,
'cause I thought you'd know
You had a problem with your new found
wealth, you brought it on yourself
I never told you I told you so, but I told you so

Have to let it go
It's time to let it go
Now I can't believe
It took so long to leave
Perhaps one day I'll grieve
Or I never will

I never told you I agreed with you,
I don't think I do
I wasn't sure quite what the whole thing
meant, but I'm glad you went
I never thought that it could be painless,
but it is I guess
I had myself fooled into needing you,
did I fool you too

Have to let it go
it's time to let it go
Now I can't believe
It took so long to leave
Perhaps one day I'll grieve
Or I never will

A viral infection that can incubate for years
Caused by affection fallen deep into arrears
No medication to procure
Makes me pure, there's no cure, I am sure

I never mentioned how I've prayed for you,
and now I've paid for you
I never said that I would wait for you,
it's too late for you

Have to let it go
it's time to let it go
Now I can't believe
It took so long to leave
Perhaps one day I'll grieve
Or I never will
