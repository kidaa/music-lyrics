On the path of life, I wish you well
Divergent journeys, but we will meet again in Hell
I kept my head down and moved on
Til every friend I'd known was gone

Then, one day, I was not alone
Everything had changed, everything was strange
Everything had changed, everything was strange

When in rags and when in wealth
A solemn promise never to give too much of myself
Despite the hopeful things I've said
I've lived my life inside my head

Then, one day, I was not alone
Everything had changed, everything was strange
Everything had changed, everything was strange

I hold my breath and count to ten
I hate it now; hated it then
I've seen it all before
A failure and a bore
But that's what friends are for

So it seems I must have won
As I survey the ashes of the damage that I've done
Everyone I've ever known
Is just as closed off and alone

Then, one day, I was not alone
Everything had changed, everything was strange
Everything had changed, everything was strange
Everything had changed, everything was strange
Everything had changed, everything
