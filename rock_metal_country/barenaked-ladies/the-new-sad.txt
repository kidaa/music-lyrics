Everybody knows that happy is the new sad 
So I am gonna go and imitate my old dad 
And never crack a smile again. 

Everybody knows that as we all get older 
The will is first to go and so upon my shoulder 
The bluebird shall not sing again. 

Everybody knows that as our hair gets greyer 
We strike a bended pose and say a little prayer 
To never feel this way again. 

Everybody knows it's never getting better 
Everything must go and you will have to let her 
And never see her face again. 

Everybody's youth is only what they make it 
Longer in the tooth, so why do people fake it? 
We'll never get it back again. 

I know it hurts 
Noone wants to die. 
Goodbye. 
Goodbye. 

Goodbye. 
Goodbye
