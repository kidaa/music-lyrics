As we walk together through the autumn, nearing winter
Through the dying leaves and trees we call our home and native land,
You say you don't believe a thing I say, I say you don't believe a thing
You say you can't believe how I don't understand

[Chorus:]
But I Know
That you will be waiting
Oh I know
That you will be waiting
Oh I know
You Will be waiting
Waiting there for me

You say you cannot live with me, you need your own identity
And now we air our laundry on national TV
And so you hate my arrogance, my smothering and sitting on the fence,
But I'm afraid of the hard permanence of letting you go free

[Chorus]

I'm so sick of fighting and that effigy you're lighting looks
An awful lot like whose name I just can't quite place
And though you say it's not supposed to be me or any entity
Still through the flames and smoke I see I recognize that face

[Chorus]

And you were someone who would
Always tell me things I don't know,
And tell me where to go
But there I'll always go
Whether or not you're waiting
I don't care if you'll be waiting
But please say that you will be waiting there for me
