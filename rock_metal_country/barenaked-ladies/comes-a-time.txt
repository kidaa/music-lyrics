Comes a time, when you're driftin'
Comes a time, when you settle down
Comes a light feelins liftin'
Pick that baby right up off the ground

Woah, this whole world keeps spinin' 'round
It's a wonder tall trees ain't layin' down
There comes a time, there comes a time

You and I, we were captured
We took our souls, and we flew away
We were right, we were given
That's how we kept what we gave away

Woah, this whole world keeps spinin' around
It's a wonder tall trees ain't layin' down
There comes a time, there comes a time
