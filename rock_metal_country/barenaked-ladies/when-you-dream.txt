With life just begun, my sleeping new son
has eyes that roll back in his head
They flutter and dart, he slows down his heart
and pictures a world past his bed
It's hard to believe
As I watch you breathe
Your mind drifts and weaves

When you dream,
what do you dream about
When you dream,
what do you dream about
Do you dream about
music or mathematics
or planets too far for the eye
Do you dream about
Jesus or quantum mechanics
or angels who sing lullabies

His fontanelle pulses with lives that he's lived
With memories he'll learn to ignore
And when it is closed, he already knows
he's forgotten all he knew before
But when sleep sets in
history begins
But the future will win

When you dream,
what do you dream about
When you dream,
what do you dream about
Are they colour or black and white,
Yiddish or English
or languages not yet conceived
Are they silent or boisterous
Do you hear noises just
loud enough to be perceived
Do you hear Del Shannon's "Runaway" playing
on transistor radio waves
With so little experience,
your mind not yet cognizant
Are you wise beyond your few days
When you dream,
what do you dream about
When you dream,
what do you dream about
