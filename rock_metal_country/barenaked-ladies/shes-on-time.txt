Woke up, I was on top of the world
There was a beautiful girl in the bed beside me
Rolled over got a kiss on the ear
She said, "Listen up dear, there's a change inside me"

Can't say how frightened I am
How unenlightened I am
As I run for cover
Can't say how happy I am to be wrong

[Chorus]
She's on time, She's on time
She's on time, She's on time
She's on time, hallelujah
She's on time
And it's the safest time of the month they say for love

We move in a mysterious way
'Cause when some holiday
I'd say we work harder
Not happy with a hug and a kiss
Although most stop at this
We go much, much farther

We can't stop foolin' around
On the bed, on the ground on the bathroom counter
We can't stop when all our systems are go

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

Between you and me, how happy we'll be
Repeating the cycle permanently
But where will we be when baby makes three

I know that in a couple of years
I might lay down my fears and get psyched about it
Give in with out an ounce of regret
Trying not to forget what I liked about it
One day I might look like a fool,
With a yard, and a pool and a station wagon
Till then I get down on my knees everyday and pray

[Chorus]

She's on time, She's on time
She's on time, She's on time
She's on time, hallelujah
She's on time
And it's the greatest time of the month for making love

She's on time, She's on time
She's on time, She's on time
She's on time

Where's the drummer

[Chorus]

She's on time, She's on time
She's on time, She's on time
