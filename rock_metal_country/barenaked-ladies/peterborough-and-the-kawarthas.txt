Peterborough and the Kawarthas
Creeggan
I left you in the rain
Peterborough and the Kawarthas
Your reflection in the pane
Peterborough and the Kawarthas

Apples, pears, prunes and plums
His favourite food, I told his mom
Wait for him at the end of the slide
When he climbs the stairs, stay by his side

I heard you got some rain
Peterborough and the Kawarthas
Looks like we're in for the same
Peterborough and the Kawarthas

I'm going early, won't wave goodbye
Tell him I love him; look him in the eye
I've learned how to mourn; I've learned how to miss
Let me disappear with this kiss

Bird, book, and basketball
Squirrel, dog, and learning how to crawl
I found my heart when he came
Let my leaving leave like rain

I watched you from the train
Peterborough and the Kawarthas
When I come back I'll see you again
Peterborough and the Kawarthas

I listen for you every morning
I listen for you every morning
I listen for you every morning
I listen for you every morning
