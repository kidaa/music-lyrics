Yo, go with the flow my rhymes they grow just like an afro
You wanna go?
You don't have no funny lookin' girls hangin' off your arm 
Well I grew up on a farm 
Really? 
Yeah, I'm a farmboy homeboy
Yo yo yo homeboy yo

Give me pickles cheese chips prepared mustard
Give me a grill boy, babe I'm gonna bust ya
Up with flavor down with leather
Come on baby lets get it together*

Would you pull me, just like a stop on an organ
I'm Harry Morgan
Taller than Danny Devito
Ah neato
I gotta see you in a Speedo
Check my libido at the door if you please
Give me a Kleenex, I think I'm gonna sneeze
