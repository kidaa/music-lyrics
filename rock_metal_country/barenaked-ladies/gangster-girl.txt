Gangster girl, your love has got my guns firin'
In the line up you're the one I'm admirin'
Listen, can you hear the sirens? [Here comes the sirens]

Well, none of your crimes have been violent
What do you say? I love you.
You have the right to remain silent
And the right to legal counsel too

Oh, Gangster Girl you stole my heart away
I'll get it back from you someday 
When you get out of jail [When you get out of jail]
Gangster Girl
