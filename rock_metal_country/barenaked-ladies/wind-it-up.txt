Stop, drop and roll and I will tell you where I'm coming from
You've done a lot of yelling pointed at my eardrum
I'll offer all of me that you can lay your eyes on
I'll get right back to you once I get my disguise on

Hearts on fire, you'll learn
End up with heartburn

Wind me up, my dear
Had it up to here
Wind it up

I can't believe that you'd believe that I would fake it
Wait - unless you count the things I said when we were naked
Run, run away from everything we'd ever hoped for
I can't believe that this is what people elope for

Throw your sticks and stones
Throw your mobile phone

Wind me up, my dear
Had it up to here
Wind it up

If you are leaving then I wish you luck
I hope someone can make your heart warm
I was a baby when I learned to suck
But you have raised it to an art form

Yes I'm out of line
But you're out of your mind

Wind me up, my dear
Had it up to here
Wind me up, my dear
Had it up to here
Wind it up
