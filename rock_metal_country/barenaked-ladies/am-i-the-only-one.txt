Am I The Only One? 
Words   Music by Ed Robertson 

Am I the only one who gets to make you laugh., 
Laugh until you cry? 
Am I the only one who asks you to go, 
Go on without me? 
Am I the only one who loves when you leave 
Your hair down in front of your eyes? 

Chorus: 
And who do you think I am? 
And who do you think I'll be? 
without You? 

Am I the only one who had to dress you up 
To see how you fell down 
Am I the only one who needs you to go, 
Go on about me? 
Am I the only one who loves when you leave 
Your hair down in front of your eyes? 

Chorus
