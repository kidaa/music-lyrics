Straw Hat and Old Dirty Hank 
Words   Music by Steven Page   Ed Robertson 

I tend the wheat field that makes your bread. 
I bind the sweet veal, pluck the hens that make your bed. 
Mother Nature   Mother Earth 
Are two of three women who dictate what I'm worth 

Chorus: 
I'm the farmer. 
I work in the fields all day. 
Don't mean to alarm her, 
But I know it was meant to be this way. 

You cried a tear, I wiped it dry 
I put you up upon a pedestal so high 
if you should waiver, if you should sway 
I'd catch you, spread my tiny wings and fly away. 
You signed your picture with an O and X 
I bet you don't write "love" each time you sign your cheques. 

Chorus 

All of this corn I grow I grow it all for you 
I took a hatchet to the radio I did it all for you 
You could have written back, 
You could have said "Thank you" 
I guess you've got better things, 
better things to do. 

You say you love me, is that the truth? 
Although they've heard the songs, my friends want living proof. 
I know your address, I ring the bell 
I bring you flowers and a .22 with shells. 

I'm the farmer 
I work in the fields all day 
Never wanted to harm her 
But I know it was meant to be this way.
