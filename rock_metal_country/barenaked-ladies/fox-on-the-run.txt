She walks through the corn leading down to the river. 
And her hair shone like gold in the hot morning sun. 
She took all the love that a poor boy could give her 
And left me to die like the fox on the run. 

Like the fox like the fox, like the fox on the run. 

Now everybody knows the reason for my fall 
This woman tempted down in paradise hall. That doesn't sound too bad. 
This woman tempted me and she took me for a ride 
Now I'm like a lonely fox cause I need a place to hide. 

You know, she walks through the corn leading down to the river. 
And her hair shone like gold in the hot morning sun. 
You know, she took all the love that a poor boy could give her 
And left me to die like the fox on the run. boy 

Like the fox like the fox, like the fox on the run. 

We'll drink a glass of wine and fortify the soul. 
We'll talk about the world and friends we used to know. great friends 
I've seen a string of girls who have put me on the floor. 
The game is nearly over and my hounds are at my door. 

You know, she walks through the corn leading down to the river. 
And her hair shone like gold in the hot morning sun. 
You know, she took all the love that a poor boy could give her 
And left me to die like the fox on the run. 

Like the fox like the fox, like the fox on the run. 

Like a bird like a bird on a wire 
Like a drunk in a midnight choir 
I'm tried I'm tried in my ways 
To be free 

Hit it! 

I wanna rock right now 
I'm a Base and I came to get down 
I'm not internationally known 
But I'm known to rock the microphone 

Because I get stupid, I mean outrageous 
Stay away from me if you're contagious 
'Cause I'm a man, no, I'm not the loser 
To be an M.C. is what I chooser 

Ladies love me, girls adore me 
I mean even the ones who never saw me 
Like the way that I rhyme at a show 
The reason why, man, I don't know I don't know cause 

It takes two It takes two, It takes two to make a thing go right 
It takes two It takes two, It takes two to make it outta sight
