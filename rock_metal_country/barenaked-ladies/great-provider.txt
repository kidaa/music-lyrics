You and I have been through this before
I owe you my whole life, nothing more
I never said that I liked you the most
You're my father, I'm your son, who's the Holy Ghost
Where does the time go when it's not around here
Here we stand at the edge of the drive
I'm just waiting for my ride to arrive
I wait to see if you've any last words
We pulled away, I called your name, I don't think you heard.
Where does the time go when it's not around here
I don't know
Where does the time go when it's not around here
You and I never shared all that much
When I leave I'll be all right, I'll keep in touch
As your road narrows, so mine grows wider
As I leave I turn and wave to the Great Provider
Where does the time go when it's not around here
I don't know
Where does the time go when it's not around here
