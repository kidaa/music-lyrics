You're looking for something 
That you'll never find 
You've got the questions 
You've got the time 
You've got the bruises 
To show you've been blind 
'Cause you're looking for something 
That you'll never find 

I'm hoping you find it 
And someday you might 
But not in an instant 
And not overnight 
And I am the one who's 
Holding you tight 
Hoping you find it 
And someday you might 

Could you be the one 
Could you be the one who will find it 
Staring at the sun as you're blinded 
Could you be the one who will find 
That it's fine if it's not in me 

You're looking for something 
That's not even there 
You're knocking down tables 
You're kicking in chairs 
I know you're angry 
You know I don't care 
Looking for something 
That's not even there 

Make me an offer 
That I can't refuse 
Set up my options 
Force me to choose 
You've been abandoned 
I've been abused 
Set up my options 
'Cause I can't refuse 

Oh, could you be the one 
Could you be the one who will find it 
Staring at the sun as you're blinded 
Could you be the one who will find 
That it's fine if it's not in me 

Over in Indiana 
Wearing their red bandanas 
The Indians eat bananas 
Thinking they're full of Vitamin C 

Looking for someone 
That I'll never be 
Some kind of bondage 
To make you feel free 
A Lover, a savior 
Oh, that isn't me 
Well you're looking for someone 
That I'll never be 

Could you be the one 
Oh could you be the one who will find it 
Staring at the sun as you're blinded 
Could you be the one who will find 
That it's fine if it's not in me
