Oh, I - I watch it all go down
Closed eyes - pretend noone's around
So I - I chose to play the clown
Or blow by and never make a sound

[CHORUS:]
Any other guy would wanna take it outside
But I'd never even try - who wants to get their lights knocked out?
Any other guy would wanna stir it up some,
But I'd rather say goodbye

Turn 'round - say it to my face
No sound - Everything's a race
Lose ground - lost in your embrace
Leave town - never leave a trace

[CHORUS]

Hardly know what anything's for
Just for show, I'm slamming the door
Even so, my heart and my head are an open book

[CHORUS x2]

I'd rather say goodbye
