I really can't stay
But baby it's cold outside 
I've got to go 'way 
But baby it's cold outside 
This evening has been 
Been hoping that you'd drop in 
So very nice 
I'll hold your hands they're cold as ice. 

My mother will start to worry 
Beautiful what's your hurry? 
And father will be pacing the floor 
Listen to the fireplace roar 
So really I'd better scurry 
Beautiful please don't hurry 
Well maybe just a half a drink more 
Put some records on while I pour. 

The neighbors might think 
But baby it's bad out there 
Say what's in this drink
No cabs to be had out there 
I wish I knew how 
Your eyes are like starlight now 
To break this spell 
I'll take your hat your hair looks swell. 

I oughta say no no no sir 
Mind if I move in closer? 
At least I'm gonna say that I tried 
What's the sense of hurting my pride 
I really can't stay 
Oh baby don't hold out 
Ah, but it's cold outside 
Baby it's cold outside

I simply must go 
But baby it's cold outside 
The answer is no 
But baby it's cold outside 
The welcome has been 
How lucky that you dropped in 
So nice and warm 
Look out that window at that storm. 

My sister will be suspicious 
Don't your lips look delicious 
My brother will be there at the door 
Waves upon a tropical shore 
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious 
Gosh your lips are delicious 
Well maybe just a cigarette more 
Never such a blizzard before. 

I've got to get home 
But baby you'd freeze out there 
Say lend me a comb 
It's up to your knees out there 
You've really been grand 
I thrill when you hold my hand 
But don't you see 
How can you do this thing to me? 

There's bound to be talk tomorrow 
Think of my lifelong sorrow 
At least there will be plenty implied 
If you caught pneumonia and died 
I really can't stay 
Get over that old doubt, 
Ah, but it's cold outside 

Where could you be going 
When the wind is blowing 
And it's cold outside 
Baby It's cold, cold outside.
