Wishing Well 


Kissing like a bandit stealing time 
Underneath the sycamore tree 
Cupid by the hour sends valentines 
To my sweet lover and me 

Slowly, surely 
Yours appetite is more than I knew 

Slowly, softly 
I'm falling in love with you 

Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell 
A wishing well of butterfly tears come on 

Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell 
A wishing well of crocodile tears hey 

Hugging like a monkey see monkey do 
Right beside a riverboat gambler 
Erotic images float through my head 
Said I wanna be, I wanna be your midnight rambler 

Slowly, maybe kinda quickly 
The blood races through my veins 

Quickly, loudly 
I wanna hear those sugar bells ring 

Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell 
A wishing well of butterfly tears come on! 
Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell 
A wishing well of butterfly tears oh baby! 

Wishing well 

Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell 
Wishing well  
A wishing well of butterfly tears 
Wishing well 
Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell 
Wishing well 
A wishing well of crocodile tears 
WisHing well 
Wish me love a wishing well 

Wishing well. 

Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell 
Wishing well 
A wishing well of butterfly tears 
Wishing Well
