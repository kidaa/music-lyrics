What if you were not just for show? 
What if you were not good to go? 
What if you were simply not so 
Beautiful 

What if you were not thin and tall? 
What if you were done with it all? 
What if you were not baby-doll 
Beautiful 

Beautiful 
Isn't she? 
Beautiful 
Paid to be 
Beautiful 
When I see 
Beautiful 
Shame on me 

Hoping that it's deeper than skin 
Open to the beauty within 
Scoping out the room's not a sin 
Beautiful 

Beautiful 
And not much else 
Not much else going on 
No matter 'cause no one's as 

Beautiful 
Everytime she walks in the room their heads all turn to find her 
Beautiful 
Everything she says I simply say I never mind.* 
Beautiful 
Everyone she sees seems to ignore the whole experience. 
Beautiful 
Everytime she sees me checking her appearance 

What if one day I wake up blind? 
Would I go on losing my mind? 
Groping in the dark just to find 
Beautiful 

Beauty disappears 
Boredom perserveres 

Beautiful 
Isn't she? 
Beautiful 
Paid to be 
Beautiful 
When I see 
Beautiful 
Shame on me 

Beautiful Isn't she?
Everytime she walks in the room their heads all turn to find her 
Beautiful Paid to be
Everything she says I simply say I never mind. 
Beautiful When I see
Everyone she sees seems to ignore the whole experience. 
Beautiful 
Shame on me
