I woke up this morning and I felt sick
There's something inside me, I felt it kick
Something's gone wrong, something's gone wrong

I've got a bad headache and I've got the shakes
Nothing seems to suit this tummy ache
Could it be so? No, it can't be so

Steven Page is having a baby, Steven Page is having a baby
They said boys could never give birth

I feel kinda special that I'm the one
To bring the world a daughter or maybe a son
Well, either's just fine so long as their mine
And if it's a boy I'll call him Gordon
And if it's a girl I'll call her Gordon
I just like the name Gordon

Steven Page is having a baby, Steven Page is having a baby
They said boys could never give birth

Steven Page is playing a solo, Steven page is playing a solo
They said Steve could never play jazz

And now it's time for the big morality quiz
'Cause I don't know just who the father is
[who's the daddy, who, who's the daddy?]
But I don't mind 'cause all I want is a baby
[all I want is a baby, all I want] 
All I want is a kid

Well maybe it's crazy it might sound dumb,
But will I be a daddy or maybe a mum?
Just call me Steve, just call me Steve

And where will it come out when I give birth?
Should I sell my story? How much is it worth?
You won't believe, you just wouldn't believe.
[You won't believe it, really!]

Steven Page is having a baby [oh yeah]
Steven Page is having a baby
They said boys could never give birth etc..
