I had time to kill 
One day in Alaska 
I walked around until 
I found the arts and crafts shop 
I bought you a card 
I don't know where to send it 
I wrote it from the heart 
I'm not sure how to end it 

I wonder--where have you been? 
Will I see you again 
I give the globe another spin 
All this time I'm wonderin' 
Give the globe another spin 
Are you in 
Berlin? 

Sweet potato pie 
Is what your mom would always make 
Your father smoked a pipe 
My hand crushed in his handshake 
They say you took a job 
Spying for the army 
And had to relocate 
With a new identity 

I wonder--where have you been? 
Will I see you again? 
I give the globe another spin 
All this time I'm wonderin' 
Give the globe another spin 

Are you in are you in 
Afghanistan? 

Are you in...
