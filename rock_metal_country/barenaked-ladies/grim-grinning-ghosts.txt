When the crypt doors creak
and the tombstones quake
Spooks come out for a squeaming way
Happy haunts materialize
And begin to vocalize
Grim grinning ghosts come out to socialize

Now don't close your eyes
And don't try to hide
Or a silly spook may 
sit by your side
Shrouded in a daft disguise
They pretend to terrorize
Grim grinning ghosts 
come out to socialize

As the moon climbs high o'er dead oak tree
Spooks arrive for the midnight spree
Creepy creeps with eerie eyes
Start to shriek and harmonize
Grim grinning ghosts come out socialize

When you hear the knell of a requiem bell
Weird glows gleam where spirits dwell
Restless bones etherealize
Rise as spooks of every size

Grim grinning ghosts come out to socialize
Grim grinning ghosts come out
Grim grinning ghosts come out
To socialize
