I've been burned, and with both feet on the ground.
I've learned that it's painful coming down.
No use running away, and there's no time left to stay..

Now I'm finding out that it's so confusing,
No time left and I know I'm losing.
Burned, I think I'm falling down.
Burned, and my ears can't hear a sound

No use running away, and there's no time left to stay..
Now I'm finding out that it's so confusing,
No time left and I know I'm losing.

Now I'm finding out that it's so confusing,
No time left and I know I'm losing.

Now I'm finding out that it's so confusing,
No time left and I know I'm losing.
