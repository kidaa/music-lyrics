I climb the walls of my mind just like I'm climbing on a jungle gym
I am more than content with the
state of mind I am in
'cause I am crazy just like you
I am crazy just like you.

I don't think I need a rubber room,
but hey, that might be nice
I'm not a manic depressive paranoid or schizophrenic 
so I don't need your advice.
I am crazy just like you
I am crazy just like you.

The lights are on but nobody's home
my elevator doesn't go to the top
I'm not playing with a full deck 
I've lost my marbles
The lights are on but nobody's home
my elevator doesn't go to the top
I'm not playing with a full deck 
I've lost my marbles.

I'm a few bricks short of a load,
but a full load always hurt my back.
I flew over the cuckoo's nest and 
I'm never ever coming back because
I am crazy just like you
I am crazy just like you.
I am crazy.
