There was darkness, there was light,
There was day and there was night,
There was wrong and there was right...
And then there was me.

You didn't even know me, but you treated me like dirt.
And then there was me
You didn't even know me, but you called me a jerk.
And then there was me

I'm from a planet near a star
You wouldn't know it's very far.
They're calling me the man from Mars
And I think they're insulting me.

They tried to take my special suit.
Insulting me
Insulting me
Put your hands up or I'll shoot! I don't have hands...

Across the galaxy I flew,
Heard a peaceful message sent by you.
Now I find you're judged by color and size.
I can't believe what you call my...

I see the guy who sails the sky, but I think I'd like to live here.
I'd like to share your mountains, share your trees, and share your rivers.
I've never seen so many people of so many colors.
I'd like to think that someday maybe I could call you brothers.

And then there was we
I'd like to learn about your pizza and your weather,
And then there was we
Then we could learn about how beings live together.
And then there was we

So if you're thinking about being a spaceman,
It don't matter if you're black or white
Or purple or blue or green or red
Or yellow with polka dots on your head
Or made of snow or made of wheat
Or looking like something that's kind of a treat.

I like your hat... fade
