It's hard enough to notice
Harder still to react
Just a stone's throw from the centre of our attention
We all fade to black

Save me from a villainous imagination
Deliver me from my friends
If I said something to make you mad
I will take it back

It's hard enough to stomach
But try to look away
Is this a news report or a trailer for a motion picture?
It all fades to grey

Save me from a villainous imagination
Deliver me from my friends
If I said something to make you mad
I will take it back

Long lines and warning signs
Think of all the lives saved by plastic knives
It's naive, but make-believe
We will never lose if we remove our shoes

It's hard to keep your mouth shut
Harder still to make noise
But we can't have the perfect 20/20 hindsight
That our fate enjoys

So save me from a villainous imagination
Deliver me from my friends
And if I said something to make you mad
I will take it back
I will take it back
