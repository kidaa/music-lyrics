What does it mean to wake out of a dream and be
Wearing some else's shorts
I've been around the block, at least on my bike
I was prepared for the news but not for 
The Third World War

I found me an answer, in a grocery store
I found me an answer in the form of an old man with
a cardigan on, this guy's got thirty years on me but
he stops and smiles just to say "Hello,
didn't I see you on TV"

Must've been the same thing
Must've been the same thing
Must've been the same thing
Charlie Brown went through

I'm in a comic store
Lookin' for some mistakenly priced comic I could make
A fortune on and in walks the Fantastic Four
I say "Don't go; That last issue was cool!"

Must've been the same thing
Must've been the same thing
Must've been the same

These things all end
Who asked you anyway
You'll have to bend
Who asked you anyway

I'm in a thunderstorm
Staying out from under trees never holding
Golf clubs, but still seem to be getting
Struck by lightning... must be
Something in my veins
My weathered veins

Must've been the same thing
