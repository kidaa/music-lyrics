Life, in A Nutshell 
Words   Music by Steven Page   Ed Robertson 

When she was three 
Her barbies always did it on the first date 
Now she's with me, 
There's never any need for them to demonstrate 
She's like a baby, I'm like a cat; 
When we are happy, we both get fat and still 
it's never enough, it's never enough, 
it's never enough 

Chorus: 
But I don't tend to worry about the things that other people say, 
And I'm learning that I wouldn't want it any other way 
Call me crazy, but it really doesn't matter 
All that matters to me is she 

Her life, in a nutshell 
No way would she want it to change me 
it's not that easy 'cause 
My time is often decided for me 
For me 

She memorized every pencil crayon colour in the box 
Her blue-green eyes complement the burn sienna in her locks 
She's at the movies, I'm on the phone; 
When we're separated, we're never alone, but still 
it's never enough, it's never enough, 
No it's never enough 

Chorus 

I fell down 
With no one there to catch me from falling 
Then she came 'round 
And only her tenderness stopped me from bawling my eyes out 
I'm OK 
And that's why 
Her life, in a nutshell ...
