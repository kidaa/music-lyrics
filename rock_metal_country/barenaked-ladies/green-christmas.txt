from  How the Grinch Stole Christmas  soundtrack

The streets are filled with Christmas cheer
At least it's only once a year
Perfect parcels tied with perfect bows,
And carols ringing in my ear

Bundled up against the cold
Lines wherever gifts are sold
Each shop window displays a Christmas scene
For everybody young and old

Icicles on eavesdrops and tinsel on the tree,
But it's a green Christmas for me

Couples skating on the pond [couples skating the pond]
Making angels on the lawn [makin' angels on the lawn]
Five red mittens drying on the rack
And needles shedding tannenbaum

Red bows on the railings and snowflakes on the ground,
But it's a green Christmas in this town

Green, cause of everything I miss
All this mistletoe, no kiss
And with every Christmas wish
There would be no greater gift
Than to have this envy lift

Carolers are at my door [Fa la la la etc..]
Don't wanna hear them anymore
Stockings on the mantle
The snow's here everyday
But it's a green Christmas anyway

Red nose on the reindeer and tinsel on the tree
But it's a green Christmas for me
