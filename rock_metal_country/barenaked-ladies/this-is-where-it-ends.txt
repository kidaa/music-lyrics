I don't buy everything I read,
I haven't even read everything I've bought
I don't cry every time I bleed,
my eyes are dry, but they're bloodshot
I have faith in medication
I believe in the Prozac Nation
You play doctor, but I've lost patience

[Chorus]
But this is where it ends
This is where it ends
Call the police and call the press
But please, dear God, don't tell my friends
This is where it ends
This is where it ends

Where's my pride Where's my self-esteem
Does it show in the drinks I've bought
I don't hide every time I'm seen, but I try not to get caught
Make excuses for behaviour
Can my illness be my saviour
Hid my heart while you still gave yours

[Chorus]

She says she wants to live in a movie
I say I want someone else to stand behind me
And write it all down
'Cause I can't be bothered 
Doing it myself.
And I don't want the responsibility of 
proving it's importance.

I have loved and I have waited
Been picked up and been sedated
mental health is overrated

[Chorus]
