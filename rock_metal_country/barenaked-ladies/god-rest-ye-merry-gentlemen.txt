God rest ye merry gentlemen, let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our Savior was born upon this day 
To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray 
Oh tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy 
Oh tidings of comfort and joy. 

From God our heavenly Father, this blessed angel came 
And unto certain shepherds brought tidings of the same 
How that in Bethlehem was born the Son of God by name, 

Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy 
Oh tidings of comfort and joy. 

O star of wonder, star of night, 
Star with royal beauty bright, 
Westward leading, still proceeding, 
Guide us to thy perfect light. 

Born a king on Bethlehem's plain, 
Gold I bring, to crown him again, 
King forever, ceasing never, 
Over us all to rein 

O star of wonder, star of night, 
Star with royal beauty bright, 
Westward leading, still proceeding, 
Guide us to thy perfect light. 

Glorious now behold him arise, 
King and God and sacrifice, 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, 
Worship Him, God most High 

O star of wonder, star of night, 
Star with royal beauty bright,
Westward leading, still proceeding, 
Guide us to thy perfect light. 

God rest ye merry, gentlemen, let nothing you dismay 
etc. etc. etc
