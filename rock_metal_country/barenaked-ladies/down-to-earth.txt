Some people are just all show 
Well, I don't mind that if the show is worth watching 
But it's all bark and no tree 
What's more ironic than a hippie in Versace? 
It's all peace and love and limousines 
You got the right message, but the wrong intentions 
How can you be touchy-feely when you've lost touch? 
I think it's time we had a little intervention with you 

Hey now, wake up 
And lose the makeup 
She makes you wanna know her 
When you don't know what it's worth 
Now you really wanna show her 
How she's just so down to Earth via satellite 

There's no better friends than the, the kind you pay 
If they don't balance, great - then the door will keep revolving 
It's a tight circle of the chosen few 
Well, how'd you manage that with the recipe involving 
Just a pinch of sweetness and a cup of angst? 
Mix it all up - you're the all-purpose flour 
Though it looks delicious, something smells bad 
I don't think I'd last a half an hour with you 

Hey now, wake up 
And lose the makeup 
She makes you wanna know her 
When you don't know what it's worth 
Now you really wanna show her 
How she's just so down to Earth via satellite 

What's it like to love you 
When there's no one else above you 
And no one gets to know you? 
Well, who'll be there to show you via satellite? 

It's like making love to a TV 
It's kinda novel, but it's miles away from satisfying 
Your hangers-on say it's a great deal 
But what you're selling, there's no chance in hell that I'll be buying 

Hey now, wake up 
And lose the makeup 
She makes you wanna know her 
When you don't know what it's worth 
Now you really wanna show her 
How she's just so down to Earth 
She makes you wanna know her 
When you don't know what it's worth 
Now you really wanna show her 
How she's just so down to Earth via satellite
