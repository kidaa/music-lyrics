Don't the hours grow shorter as the days go by? 
We never get to stop and open our eyes. 
One minute you're waiting for the sky to fall 
Next you're dazzled by the beauty of it all. 

Lovers in a dangerous time 
Lovers in a dangerous time 

These fragile bodies of touch and taste 
This fragrant skin, this hair like lace 
Spirits open to thrust of grace, 
Never a breath you can't afford to waste. 

Lovers in a dangerous time 
Lovers in a dangerous time 
Lovers in a dangerous time 
Lovers in a dangerous time 

When you're lovers in a dangerous time, 
Sometimes you're made to feel your loves a crime. 
Nothing worth having comes without some kind of fight 
You gotta kick at the darkness till it bleeds daylight. 

Lovers in a dangerous time 
Lovers in a dangerous time 
Lovers in a dangerous time 
Lovers in a dangerous time 

We were lovers in a dangerous time 
We were lovers in a dangerous time...
