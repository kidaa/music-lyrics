In through my veins, without brains,
I involuntarily take what I need, then I bleed
And it comes right back to me
But guts only eat 
And sometimes they repeat on you
Keeping you on your toes or crouched above the loo

That's what you get when you confuse your stomach with your heart.
That's what you get when you confuse your stomach with your heart.

Blood turns from blue into red
'Cause of oxygen that it's fed
And I turn back to blue,
'Cause I'm losing you,
But Tummy just growls
Not real words, mostly vowels
And I always forget sometimes Y
Gratification can cause constipation
If organs are left to die

That's what you get when you confuse your stomach with your heart.
That's what you get when you confuse your stomach with your heart.

I gained all this weight out of love, not hate
I've got so much love to give give me a break
I'd love to sleep in late, but that dessert looks great.
Was it something I said or was it some I ate
Heart beats in sync, beat in time,
Beat in bodies likes hers and mine,
But I fed only one, and look what it's done:
I've run out of blood and I'm chewing my cud
And my gastrointestinal festival's best of all
The cardiovascular questions they ask you are
Less than the answers they give you like cancer and

That's what you get when you confuse your stomach with your heart.
That's what you get when you confuse your stomach with your heart.
