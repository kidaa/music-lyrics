First you tie it around your hand
You showed me so I would understand
It's the handiest knot,
It wasn't in the book that I bought

Inline bowline, inline bowline

All who tie a knot at the game
We all were glad that he came
We toyed with tyin' the noose
No one knew he'd give it use

Did he think that he was nothing?
Only ending his life was left to try
Over turned over I'm left to sing
Really, why? Really, why?
Really, why? Really, why?

I use it to tie up my canoe [use it to tie my canoe]
I've used it to tie my shoes [used to tie my shoes]
It's handy on a whim [handy on a whim]
This knot is tied to him
Tied to him
Tied to him
Tied to him
