These Apples 
Words   Music by Ed Robertson 

A friend brought me flowers, she said they were lilacs 
But I've never been good with plants 
Her next presentation, a new dictionary 
She'd circled the word "romance" 
So enthusiastic, a little bit drastic 
I shaved her name in my head 
And as she beheld it, she said I misspelled it; 
Need more be said! 

Chorus: 
These apples are delicious! 
"As a matter of fact they are," she said 
Can all this fruit be free? 

She wrote me a letter as big as a phonebook 
I've never been big on mail 
I sent her a postcard from somewhere near Lethebridge 
And wondered if it still went by rail 
I've never been frightened of being enlightened 
But some things can go too far 
Though sometimes I stammer and mix up my grammar, 
You get what my meanings are 

Chorus 

I'm not trying to sing a love song -- I'm trying to sing in tune. 
I know I am sometimes headstrong 
Falling love, catching fire -- I want to be consumed 
Wondering will I ever tire, will I ever tire! 

Chorus
