So long ago, on a summer day 
I put my best shirt on 
I took you to the matinee 
With money from mowing lawns 
Money from mowing lawns 

You worked down at the Dairy Queen 
We hit it off from the start 
Now there's a blizzard in between 
Frost inside a heart 

If I had a good reason, I would share 
It with you 
Then the coldest season came 
Making room for something new 
Good for you 
Good for me 
Call it serendipity 

Walking on coals, just trying to get through 
But summers don't last that long 
All that is left here is the truth 
Everything else is gone 

Gone without a good reason for me to share 
With you 
When the coldest season came 
Making room for something new 
Good for you 
Good for me 
Call it serendipity 

If I could only hit my stride 
I'll make it to the other side 
I don't wanna be roadkill 
When there's half a cup to fill 
To fill 

Good for you Call it serendipity 
Good for me Serendipity 
Call it serendipity 
Call it serendipity 
Call it serendipity 

Walking on coals, just trying to get through 
Now summers don't last so long 
All that is left here is the truth 
Everything else is gone
