The Old Apartment 
Words   Music by Steven Page   Ed Robertson 

Broke into the old apartment 
This is where we used to live 
Broken glass, broke and hungry 
broken hearts and broken bones 
This is where we used to live 

Why did you paint the walls? 
Why did you clean the floor? 
Why did you plaster over the hole I punched in the door? 
This is where we used to live 

Why did you keep the mousetrap? 
Why did you keep the dishrack? 
these things used to be mine 
I guess they still are, I want them back 

Broke into the old apartment 
Forty-two stairs from the street 
Crooked landing, crooked landlord 
Narrow laneway filled with crooks. 
This is where we used to live. 

Why did they pave the lawn? 
why did they change the locks? 
Why did I have to break it, I only came here to talk 
This is where we used to live 

How is the neighbor downstairs? 
How is her temper this year? 
I turned up your TV and stomped on the floor just for fun 
I know we don't live here anymore 
We bought an old house on the Danforth 
She loves me and her body keeps me warm 
I'm happy here 
But this is where we used to live 

Broke into the old apartment 
Tore the phone out of the wall 
Only memories, fading memories 
Blending into dull tableaux 

I want them back 
I want them back
