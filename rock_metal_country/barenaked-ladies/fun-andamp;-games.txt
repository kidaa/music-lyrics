We sent in the army 
They sounded alarms we 
Saw it coming from a mile away. 
We kept it off radar 
Because we had to say our 
Intentions were to save the day. 

Why did you fail to see? 

It was a gag 
It was all for a laugh 
And they were shocked and they were awed 
and they were blown in half 

Fun and games 
We're just pulling legs 
We knew this barrel of fun 
Would be a powderkeg 

We kept it all long-range 
and made a regime change 
You'd have thought it would have been a gas 
But when it got ugly 
We sat around smugly 
Because you bought our little joke en masse 
Don't look at me that way 

It was a gag 
It was all for a laugh 
We knew your sons and daughters 
Would be blown in half 

Fun and games 
We're just pulling legs 
We knew this barrel of fun 
Would be a powderkeg 

Put a smile on 
We're the ones that you selected 
Leave that dial son 
Because we just got re-elected 
In a while our 
Bill of rights will be rejected 

and all the blame will be deflected 
the forests will be unprotected 
the nation's poor will be neglected 
creation myth is resurrected 
a new salute is genuflected 
a gallup poll will be respected 
gallows pole will be erected 
all this will go undetected 

While you all slumbered 
We sat and crunched numbers 
Of all the causalities we could afford 
There's no need to draft them 
You could hear us laugh then 
The poor and black all need the room and board 
Did I say that out loud? 

It was a gag 
It was all for a laugh 
And now our very nation has been blown in half 

Fun and games 
We're just pulling legs 
We knew this barrel of fun 
Would be a powderkeg 

Oh yeah....
