Suddenly things become unsound
Stumbling on the shaky ground
Given arrows to shoot tornadoes down
Shoot them down, to the ground

Saw a falling leaf, a good luck jump to grab
Much to our surprise, a butterfly
Then it sunk in this enduration,
enduration in our lives

Inside ourselves
A hidden sun that burns and burns
But never does any harm to anyone

Shivering madly in the dark
Like an animal abandoned in the car park
And she held me and then she showed me the
Beauty of the human heart

Inside ourselves,
A hidden sun that burns, and burns
But never does any harm to anyone
A hidden sun that burns, and burns
But never does any harm to anyone,
anyone, oooh, anyone.

Hidden sun, Hidden Sun, etc..
