What's a boy to do
When you tell your tale
And, it never fails
I just end up feeling bad for you

With your hang-dog eyes
You can bring me down
Now I'm wrapped around your whole hand
Stop looking so surprised

You make it easy easy
You make it easy easy

I've been burned before
You're not fooling me
There's no mystery
You've forgotten what you're hiding for

Call it self-defence
You can obfuscate
And manipulate
But it's only at your own expense

You make it easy easy
You make it easy easy
You make it easy easy
You make it easy easy

Easy to be with you
Easy to obey
Easy to forgive you at the end of the day
Easy now to judge you
Easy to betray
Easy to adore you, though you want to run away

It's easy

Look what you have done
I can do the same
Two can play this game
You'll no longer be the only one

You make it easy easy
You make it easy easy
You make it easy easy
Easy easy
