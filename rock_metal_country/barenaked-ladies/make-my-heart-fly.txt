Make My Heart Fly 

Please don't go rushing by 
Stay and make my heart fly 
Please don't go rushing by 
Stay and make my heart fly 

I never seem to know the time 
When you're with me 
You can tell it to the birds 
I'll tell the bees 

Please don't go rushing by 
Stay and make my heart fly 

I can't do anymore 
To get inside your door 
I can't do anymore 
Please let me inside your door 

I never seem to know the time 
When you're with me 
You can tell it to the birds 
I'll tell the bees 

Please don't go rushing by 
Stay and make my heart fly 
Stay and make my heart fly 
Stay and make my heart fly
