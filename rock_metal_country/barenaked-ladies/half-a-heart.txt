Drunk on wine, I'm amazing 
Bitter Pill; it's my raising 
News at five and at midnight 
Caught on tape; serves me right 

The crowd around me starts to grow 
I can feel the undertow 

Anyone with a half a heart would help me out 
Before they ever let the other half find out 
But if they could see how far I've let you down 
Anyone with half a heart would let me drown 

Flashing lights couldn't warn her 
Paint myself in a corner 
Bracing now for the impact 
Losing hope, keeping track 

Standing on a crumbling wall 
Tethered to a cannonball 

Anyone with half a heart would help me out 
Before they ever let the other half find out 
But if they could see how high I've built this wall 
Anyone with half a heart would let me fall 

In the space between sleep and sleeplessness 
We redress all our wounds 
If we replace all this hopeless hopelessness 
Then we could rest 

Anyone with half a heart would let me drown 
Anyone with half a heart would pull me down 
Anyone with half a heart would let me fall 
Anyone with half a heart wouldn't care at all 

Anyone with half a heart would help me out 
Before they ever let the other half find out 
But if they could see how far I've let you down 
Anyone with half a heart would let me drown
