Friend, this shouldn't be the way things end
But then, a break is just around the bend. 
And when you tell me as I leave 
You're scared you'll never see my face again 
Well, I'm not sure it's the truth 

You don't think I can love you 
You don't think I can love you 
You don't think I can love you 
But I can and I will and I do 

You write - I read your letters every night 
All right, I skim then just to be polite. 
I fight embarrassment and shame 
The mention of your name makes me turn white 
But guilt still makes me refrain 

You don't think I can love you 
You don't think I can love you 
You don't think I can love you 
But I can and I will and I do 

I imagine you think I don't think of you 
You know you couldn't be more wrong 
If good intentions paved the road that gets me through 
Then I've got a six-lane highway 
And I intend to someday 
Do all the things I say I can and I will and I do 

Hey - it's hard for me to go away 
Okay, I know it's not adult 
But it's just as difficult for me to stay 
And anyway you say

You don't think I can love you 
You don't think I can love you 
You don't think I can love you love you love you 
But I can and I will and I do. I can and I will and I do.
