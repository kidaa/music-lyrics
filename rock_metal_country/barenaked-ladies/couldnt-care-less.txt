I guess I lied to you when I told you I like baseball
It's not so much the game I like it's the hats
See this white band around my neck? It's nice!
It's not just fashion
Hartz made it to protect me from ticks fleas and gnats

I couldn't care less what's in a chocolate mousse
I couldn't care less what are the five fruits in five alive juice
I couldn't care less how old are Ernie and Bert
I couldn't care less what's under KD Lang's skirt

Shaggy said to Velma,  Hey now Velma how you doing? 
And Velma said  Jinkies Shag I'm just fine.

I couldn't care less why was Fonzie cool
I couldn't care less how sweat hogs do in school
I couldn't care less how do they fill the Caramilk bar
I couldn't care less my car says  the door, is ajar. 

I couldn't care less what's in a chocolate mousse
I couldn't care less what are the five fruits in five alive juice
I couldn't care less how old are Ernie and Bert
I couldn't care less what's under KD Lang's skirt

I wish I had a nickname like Crusher, Snake or Kenneth
Cause guys with nicknames always get the gals
When I grow up I'll name my children Alice Albert and Alfred
I'll call them for supper like this,  Dinner's ready, Al! 

I couldn't care less what Morton Downey says
I couldn't care less what's on the head of my Pez
I couldn't care less do Zoodles need a trained zookeeper?
I couldn't care less why's the Super Big Gulp cheaper
No really, that's ridiculous

I couldn't care less what's in a chocolate mousse
It's ground up antlers
I couldn't care less what are the five fruits in five alive juice
Apples, cheese, broccoli
I couldn't care less how old are Ernie and Bert
Their like fourty or something
I couldn't care less what's under KD Lang's skirt
I really don't know
