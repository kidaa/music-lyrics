Ever since we said our goodbyes
The onion rings, the phone makes me cry
Something isn't right
Like the Deep Blue without the Great White

In the morning open your eyes
The waterfalls, the fire flies
You're an abacus
And my heart was counting on us

Your heart's got a heavy load
There's still a long way to go
Keep your eyes on the road

Crescent moon sings me to sleep
The birches bark, the willows weep
But I lie awake
I'm adrift without a snowflake

Your heart's got a heavy load
There's still a long way to go
Keep your eyes on the road

Your heart's got a heavy load
There's still a long way to go
Keep your eyes on the road
