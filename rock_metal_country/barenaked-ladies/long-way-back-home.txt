It's a long way back home
To pack up and leave again
Together alone
You without me again

It's a long way back home
And a long way back here again
I should have known
That you would just bleed again

[Chorus]
For the first time I knew what to do
The first time it's just me and you
Then the worst timing I ever knew
I have to go
I already know

It's a long way back home
To feel like I'm far away
And how should I know
What goes on here anyway

[Chorus]

Why not spend a week on a star
No time, he can't get there by car
When we get some time on our own
We'll plan out our next day alone

It's a long way back home
To just about anywhere
'Cause once through the door
We're not even halfway there

For the first time I knew what to do
The first time it's just me and you
Then the worst timing I ever knew
I have to go
You already know

It's a long way back home
It's a long way back home
