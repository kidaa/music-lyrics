Pinch Me 

It's the perfect time of year 
Somewhere far away from here 
I feel fine enough, I guess 
Considering everything's a mess. 
There's a restaurant down the street 
Where hungry people like to eat 
I could walk, but I'll just drive 
It's colder than it looks outside. 


It's like a dream - you try to remember but it's gone.., 


S Hi folks this is Steven Page. 
T This is Tyler Stewart. 
S We're two members of Barenaked Ladies, and although you *thought* you were downloading our new single, what you're actually downloading is an advertisement for our new album 'Maroon', comes out September 12th, and after that point I'm sure you can download lots of stuff from our record but until then you're just going to get lots of stuff with us bugging you. 
T We fooled you, huh? We're sneaky like that...you can never trust a Canadian. Next thing you know, we'll be supplying your natural resources! 


...then ya 
Try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn, when ya 
Try to see the world beyond your front door. 
Take your time cos the way I rhyme's gonna make you smile, when ya 
Realise that with a guy my size it might take a while, just to 
Try to figure out what all this is for. 


It's the perfect time of day 
To throw all your cares away 
Put the sprinkler on the lawn 
And run through with my gym shorts on. 
Take a drink right from the hose 
And change into some drier clothes 
Climb the stairs up to my room 
Sleep away the afternoon. 


It's like a dream - you try to remember but it's gone, then ya 
Try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn, when ya 
Try to see the world beyond your front door. 


T Hello? Hi? H-? Hello? If you just- Would you- Could- Could you please leave a m- Ah. If you'd just let me leave a - At the sound of the - Uh. Ah. Thanks. 


Take your time cos the way I rhyme's gonna make you smile, when ya 
Realise that with a guy my size it might take a while, just to 
Try to figure out what all this is for. 
Pinch Me 
Pinch Me 
Cos I'm still asleep. 
Please God 
Tell Me 
That I'm still asleep 


On an evening such as this 
It's hard to tell if I exist 
If I Packed a car and leave this town 
Who'll notice that I'm not around? 
I could hide out under there 
I just made you say 'underwear' 
I could leave but I'll just stay 
All my stuff's here anyway. 
It's like a dream - you try to remember but it's gone, then ya 
Try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn, when ya 
Try to see the world beyond your front door. 


S If you're listening? We're trying to get our song on Napster, but we don't know how to do it....errr....we're Barenaked Ladies and we're trying to....Ty? Can you just press that over there? 


Take your time cos the way I rhyme's gonna make you smile, when ya 
Realise that with a guy my size it might take a while, just to 
Try to figure out what all this is for. 
Try to figure out what all this is for. 
Try to see the world beyond your front door. 
Try to figure out what all this is for.
