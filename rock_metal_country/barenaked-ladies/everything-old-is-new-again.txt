Everything Old is New Again 
Words   Music by Stephen Duffy   Steven Page 

Learn to lose, it's easier that way 
We've paid our dues, but we can't make life pay 
All across the world, people going mad 
in their mother's cars, the kids are feeling sad 
That's how it is, and I'll see you later 

Everything old is new again 
Everything under the sun 
Now that I'm back with you again 
We hug and we kiss 
We sit and make lists 
We drink and I bandage your wrists 

Wasted youth -- there wasn't much to waste 
Down to the bone, and still losing weight 
With all the wishing in the world glistening in her eyes 
But when I say I love her, she thinks I'm telling lies 
is it all lost? No, we never had it 

Everything old is new again 
Everything under the sun 
All of our fears come true again 

Recycle reuse 
Resent and refuse 
Our parent's ideals and view 
She thinks the afterlife might just be where the action is 
With high schools built like prisons, she can't find a way to live 
Moved back home to fill the empty nest 
Afraid to roam, in love with second best 
While somewhere in the world, she's hosting her own show 
And everyone she questions never seems to know 
Who they are and where they are going 

Everything old is new again 
Everything under the sun 
Now that I'm without you again 
I wake up and eat 
I go back to sleep 
And let my nightmares repeat 
All across the world, people going mad
