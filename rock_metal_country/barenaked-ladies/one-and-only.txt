Hey, pass the ball 
Why do you run it in circles? 
Waves crash the wall 
Soon enough all your hard work will fail 

Wait, hold the phone 
I don't know if I can take this 
Leave me alone 
I don't know if I can make this work 

See, I know I'm lost and lonely 
Please go slow; I'm one and only 

I need to think 
'Cause now I've got everyone wondering 
Pass me a drink 
Last, but not least, and my virtue's gone 

Lend me a hand 
I think I could walk if you help me 
Please understand 
If I could talk, I would tell you why 

See, I know I'm lost and lonely 
Please go slow; I'm one and only 

Only one 
All or none 
My heart's done 
Weighs a ton 

Hold me a while 
Tell me you'll never be leaving 
I'll walk the mile 
Seeing but not quite believing you 

See, I know I'm lost and lonely 
Please go slow; I'm one and only 
See, I know I'm lost and lonely See, I know I'm lost and lonely 
Please go slow; I'm one and only Please go slow; I'm one and only...
