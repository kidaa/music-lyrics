Under a canoe, sheltered from the hail
She lived six miles down the Portage Trail
I met her mom, I met her pop
They looked at me and licked their chops

She's born human, 
Raised by wolves
Will she ever understand my world?
Born human to the crazy world then one day she wandered 
deep into the woods, into the woods
Into the woods, into the woods

She follows my hand, a map of veins
To the fork in the lo chow main
Her eyes get that mischievous spark
Chasing pigeons down in the park

She's born human, raised by wolves
Will she ever understand my world?
Born human to the crazy world
Then one day she wandered 
deep into the wood, into the woods

The woods, the woods, the deep dark woods
The woods, the woods, the deep dark woods

Into the woods, the woods etc.. 

Born human, raised by wolves
Will she ever understand my world?
Born human to the crazy world
Then one day she wandered deep into the woods
