How, in every visible way, you shine
As if the stars in your wake align
Almost impossible to malign

But just below where you shine, you burn
Although I know it, I never learn
Just goes to show that I can't discern

[CHORUS:]
Aluminum to me
Aluminium to some
You can shine like silver all you want
But you're just Aluminum

Illuminating just what you want to show
You'd never rust, but I'd never know
You can't be trusted, I can't let go

[CHORUS]

Every time you're here, I forget
When you leave, you leave only regret
Every time you're here, I forget
Everything

You're so lightweight, how can you survive?
Recycling moments from others' lives
You're not as precious as you contrive

[CHORUS]
Yeah, you're just Aluminum
