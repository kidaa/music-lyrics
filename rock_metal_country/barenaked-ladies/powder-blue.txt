With each mistake, 
You either bend or break 
With every word I choose 
You only seem to bruise 
Powder blue always suited you, 
Or was your suitor too 
Until you're powder blue 

You're going off the deep end 
I'm going over all the things I've gotta say 

Apologies from my front door 
I couldn't love you more 

The bell was cracked 
Your senses sacked 
What once seemed civilized, In fear was paralyzed 
I made love blind, I lost my mind 
And now I'm over you 
As I'm not under you 

We thought we'd drive forever 
Now is it okay if I walk you to your car?

Apologies, from your car floor 
I couldn't love you more 
I couldn't love you more 
I couldn't love you more 

Baby between you and me, love is all we need 
You held out your heart 
So I could watch it bleed 
I never thought you could ever fall 
Into my life, so banal
But something so light shouldn't hurt ... at all 

Apologies, from my front door 
I couldn't love you more 
I couldn't love you more 
I couldn't love you more 
Couldn't love you anymore
