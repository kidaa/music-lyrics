You walked into the room
And the whole place stopped to notice
Standing next to you, I feel hopeless and you know this
I've never been ashamed of my attraction
I'd be happy if you gave me just a fraction
As we danced, I could see in your eyes
You and me as senior citizens in love

I followed your perfume out away from all the rabble
Right up to your room for a drink and travel Scrabble
You, stationed in the warm glow of the t.v.
Too patient as I'm playing L1O1V4E1

And we laugh...and we laugh...and we laugh
And we have to or we'll end up in the bath

Now we're in the bath, I'm already thinking marriage
I know that in the past it was something I'd disparage
You turned down all the lights, I lit the candles
We rolled around in robes and hotel sandals
Then you slept, and I dressed, and I left
And I guess I'll see you Monday like before

Before all the fireworks exploded
Our conversations were so loaded, innuendo flying
Now what can we say
Have a nice day
Looks like rain today...

Now I'm in a cab, heading back to my apartment
Everything is drab, and I wish it never started
Now I've landed in this awkward situation
How can I just avoid a conversation
So I wait, come in late. It'd be great
If you transferred out of state
