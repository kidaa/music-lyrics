When I Fall 
Words by Steven Page   Ed Robertson 
Music by Ed Robertson 

I look straight in the window, try not to look below 
Pretend I'm not up here, try counting sheep 
But the sheep seem to shower off this office tower 
Nine-point-eight straight down I can't stop my knees. 

Chorus: 
I wish I could fly 
From this building, from this wall 
And if I should try, 
would you catch me if I fall? 

My hands clench the squeegee, my secular rosary 
Hang on to your wallet, hang on to your rings 
Can't look below me, or something might throw me 
Curse at the windstorms that October brings. 

I look in the boardroom; a modern pharaoh's tomb 
I'd gladly swap places, if they care to dive 
They're lined up at the window, peer down into limbo 
They're frightened of jumping, in case they survive. 

I wish I could step from this scaffold 
onto soft green pastures, shopping malls, or bed 
With my family and my pastor and my grandfather who's Dead 

Look straight in the mirror, watch it come clearer 
I look like a painter, behind all the grease 
But paintings creating, and I'm just erasing 
A crystal-clear canvas is my masterpiece 

Chorus
