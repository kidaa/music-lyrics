Well
I have a little dreidel
I made it out of clay
And when it's dry and ready
Then, dreidel I shall play.

Oh, dreidel, dreidel, dreidel
I made it out of clay
And when it's dry and ready
Then, dreidel I will play.

It has a lovely body
With legs so short and thin
And when it gets all tired
It drops and I will win.

Oh, dreidel, dreidel, dreidel
I made it out of clay
And when it's dry and ready
Then, dreidel I will play.

My dreidel is so playful
It loves to dance and spin
A happy game of dreidel
Come play now, let's begin.

Oh, dreidel, dreidel, dreidel
I made it out of clay
And when it's dry and ready
Then, dreidel I will play.
