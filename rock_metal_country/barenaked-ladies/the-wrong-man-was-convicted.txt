Who's lonely now Which one of us is suffering
Who's in his cups Which one of us recovering
Who likes to look at pictures and cries, but way too late
Who doesn't want to change a thing, accepting it was fate

[Chorus]
The wrong man was convicted
You know I did the deed
I thought that you would wait for me, 
Your wants I needn't heed
The wrong man lies beside you 
And waits for you to wake
And all because I lacked conviction,
The judgment's my mistake

Who's breathless now Who only hyperventilates
Who'd die for you Who's dying inside anyway
Which one of us is sunshine and which one's growing dim
When two men dream of you at night, do you just dream of him

[Chorus]

Who's lonely now 
Who's reaching out to no one
Who's lonely now 
It takes one to know one
I changed my mind; you said that I could change it back
I wanted space, and now change has fallen through the cracks
If I'm again beside your body, don't tell me where it's been
It's cruel, unusual punishment to kiss fingerprinted skin

[Chorus]

It's my mistake
