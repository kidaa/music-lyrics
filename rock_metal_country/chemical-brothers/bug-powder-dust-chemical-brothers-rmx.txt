Check it, yo!

I always hit the tape with a rough road style
You heard the psychdelic and ya came from miles
Keep my rhymes thick like a Danish brew
So you could call be black and tan when I'm a wreckin' a crew
I'm like Billy White when he's in Tangiers
I'm out on the sole surviving with my Beatnik peers
Analog reel and a little distortion
Smokin' on somethin' s'you could say I'm scorchin'
I never been the type to rap up a well a well a well a well

??? in thirty form
