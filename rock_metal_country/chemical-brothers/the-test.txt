O-o-o-o-oh
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
yeeeh
Am I coming through?
Am I coming through?
Is this sweet and pure and true?

???

Devil came back this morning,
See the air
Something ?? show me
I was looking like I've never seen a face before
Here we go loud, let's loud? into the open door

That is the things that I've done before
Circling around men,
I'm here on the floor
I'm dreaming this and I'm dreaming there
Regretting nothing
Think about there

I'm seeing waves breaking forms in my horizon
Yeah I'm shining
I'm seeing waves breaking forms in my horizon, lord
I'm shining yeah

Are you hearing me?
Like I'm hearing you?
Are you hearing me?
Like I'm hearing you?

You know I almost lost my mind
I can't explain
Where I've been
You know how I've almost lost my mind
I can't explain
Where I've been
You know I almost lost my mind
I couldn't explain
What I've seen

??
To find that the images are fading away

I'm seeing waves breaking forms in my horizon
Yeah I'm shining
I'm seeing waves breaking forms in my horizon, lord
I'm shining yeah
Are you hearing me?
Like I'm hearing you?
Are you hearing me?
Like I'm hearing you?

You know I almost lost my mind
I can't explain
Where I've been
You know I almost lost my mind
I couldn't explain
The things I've seen
But now I think I see the light
Now I think I see the light

Lend me your hand
Lend me your hand
Lend me your hand
Lend me your hand
Lend me your hand

I'm seeing waves breaking forms in my horizon
Yeah I'm shining
I'm seeing waves breaking forms in my horizon, lord
I'm shining

Oh are you hearing me?
Like I'm hearing you
Oh are you hearing me?
Like I'm hearing you?
Repeat

You know I almost lost my mind
Now I'm home, and I'm free

Did I pass the acid test?
Did I pass the acid test?
Repeat

You'd better go to bed now
Repeat
