Look through the darkness the vision of life
then tell me what do you see.
A dream you believe is a life you can't see
something existis but can never be.
You will wake up but not from a dream
when you wake up it will be for real
The feeling is real and so is the pain
Wherever you go it'll be the same
You cant believe you're trapped inside.
this can't be real, wake up in time
before it's too late, beforeyou've crossed the line
Don't overlook the eye of your mind 
when the eye of that vision is a piece of another time.
Forever beware of what you dream
The vision is so closed behind.
The vision you saw the eye of your mind
a dark side of you never meant to be.
The reason of being inside of this dream
something you never tought you would see.
The fury of madness the power of dreams
You could be safe so let visions be
You hold the secret the vision inside
Keep the knowledge and seal it inside
