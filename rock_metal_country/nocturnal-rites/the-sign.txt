Hear the cry from the underworld,
to pull you under
It's the enemy, the journey ends here
Light the path throughout the night,
it's getting close
Sanctuary in a hollow void
See a sign appear in the dark
Your sould will perish in flames
The Sign of the two turns to one
No savior uo high
The promised euphoria's gone
So hell is life and death
Fell the breath inside your minde,
it prevades your soul
Hear the voices cry, through the never
Your eyes turn inside out; you're all alone now
Feel your heart explode, piece by piece
Pain, suffering just do it,
death is the blessing you seek
Your soul will be free,
Life is an endless torture,
for the mindless and weak
You're killing yourself
