It's been told about the mighty land,
The sun is never setting from the sky
Gold is washed up on the shore, to a shifting sand
The dream about the day when I'll never die
Charging through the open sea, no signs to lead the way
Wind will shift and carry us at hand
We feel the walls are closing in
The tide will take a turn, will make us drift ashore
Keep on holding on, Keep on holding to the flame
And life will go on
Keep on holding on, Keep holding 
Life will still go on
Holding on to promises and what the legends say
We will see the shore of our land
Skyline meets an open bay, Illusions might betray
Onward to the land of mystery
