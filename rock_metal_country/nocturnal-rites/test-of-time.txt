Standing lost at a crossroad
Life is lying in my hands
Faith is calling above us
And who can tell when the world will end
Time will choose only one man
Only one must grow old
We can both see it coming
And we know, it's been told
Passing through centuries
My mind growing weaker
Whose fate will be sealed
The gift of growing old
Only the strongest one
Will make it to the end
The final gathering is at hand
The time has come, there will be one
To stand the trial and the test of time
Another lifetime is on the other side
We're the last ones standing
Only one must fall
By the sword it settles
And we know it's been told
As the sreel rings through the night
I strike the deadly wound
We both see it's coming
And I know I'm the chosen one
