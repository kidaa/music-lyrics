Thundering down over valleys and hills
Onward they ride, always side by side 
The legend tells about the templars, 
The mighty men, who walk in the shadows
There's blood on their blades, swords made of steel
Guardians of man, always fight for the right
The legend speaks about their coming, 
The mighty men, they live on forevermore
See them ride, emerge out of the sun
They will vanish in haze
Hear them come, emerge out of dark
They will never give in
Ride on, through the winds of time
Ride on, through the night
Leaving their preys with a mark of the good
They hunt down in rage, veil them in death
In the name of the righteous, in justice
They will serve the gods
Call for the force, and shout out through the night
Seek and do what is right
See them come, emerge out of the dark
They will never give in
