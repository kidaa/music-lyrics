Riding out in the storm
Yet the night seemed so calm
We were hundreds of men
Side by side
Still the winds blowing strong
But sheltered by faith, we rode on,
on and on
Through the mist, we went on
With steel at our sides
We would make it to the end
Side by side.
Trough the rain and the mist
Approching our goal, we would
never, never surrender.
We're standing strong
There's a war left to fight
Beware for the warriors return
With swords held up high
There's blood left to spill
Prepare for the warriors return
We could fight 'till the end
Complete the quest
'Til the victors are standing alone.
By the strike of our blades
Men would fall at our feet
We've completed the quest
once again.
We're coming home
now the battle is won
Honor for the warriors return.
Pride for the ones who died for the cause
Glory for the warriors return.
Fill the cups up with wine
Uniting our force
And cheer for the battle we've won
and pride in our hearts
We will never surrender
