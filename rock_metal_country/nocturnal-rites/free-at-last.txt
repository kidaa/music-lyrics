Hear the voices inside of our minds now
Their message is leading the way 
Into the abyss we fall, we're standing at the edge
We're the prisoners inside of our own dreams 
Where the masters are holding the keys
Battling to save our souls, will we ever be set free?
We'll be free at last, if we stand till the end
We'll be free at last, if we stand as one
While all we knew has come to end, we'll be free at last
They're holding our souls in control now
We're lost in this maze of our minds
Fighting for our survival, striking back with force
We're trapped inside of this nightmare
We sense the light up ahead
Out from the abyss we go, rise up from beyond
