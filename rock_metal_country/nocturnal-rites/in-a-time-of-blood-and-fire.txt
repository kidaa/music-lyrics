In a time of blood and fire 
Before the break of dawn 
Mighty swords were held to the sky 
In a land that rules by darkness 
Of evil and fire spawned 
Damnation now eclipsed the sun 
As black horsemen rode along with 
Death at their side 
So the scene of death rose the winds 
In black blood they shall baptise 
And under a black star the demon will rise 
In a time of blood and fire 
They rode across the lands 
In a time of blood and fire 
Under wings of yore they shelter 
A thousand years have passed now 
Oh, so grim and dark 
Now men must laude the demon's mark 
Servants of unholy powers 
In darkness must confide 
To the abyss in the darkness they descend
