Who holds the secret?
Who sets my destiny?
When will I find out?
What lies in the path for me?
Who bears this knowledge?
The secrets of all to be
Foretell my future
Is the answer inside to see?
So I stand up and shout at the world
For my questions to be
But the powers are out of my reach
So here I am, still right back from the start
Destiny's calling leaving my future to be
Destiny's calling, screaming in anger,
my thoughts are out of reach
I hold my soul inside of my hands
The future is my past
Who'll light my way now?
Now that I stand alone
My past still haunts me
My friend is my enemy
