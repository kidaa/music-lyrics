The countess was laughing 
She looked out the plague from her throne 
By the gate in the darkness 
The crowd was screaming in pain 
Cursed of sickness by starving 
People dying slow 
They are burning their bodies, the victims 
The plague got in hold 
The plague is getting in its hold 
There is no way to escape 
The old man conquered her throne 
So it's been told 
A new day was rising 
The unknown came riding along 
An old man with power and strength 
To conquer the throne 
In shelter of darkness 
The people were standing strong 
By their leader the old man 
They are hunting the countess down
