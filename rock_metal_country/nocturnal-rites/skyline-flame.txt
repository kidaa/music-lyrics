Lachrymose they saw him leaving 
Riding along the skyline flame 
His shreiks shall forever echo 
Over valleys and hills 
Mesmerized by the evil 
Let the imperial one rule 
Ornated in blood we stand 
And in his eyes shone victory 
In from the darkness he'll return 
To his fortress 
Standing here with pride 
The skyline flame 
Paralyzed by the dark one 
Riding along the skyline flame 
The one who leads us in darkness 
And takes us to the flaming depths 
We have seen the abyss 
We crave its infernal deep 
We light our candles 
And let them light the way
