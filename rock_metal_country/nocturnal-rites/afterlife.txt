I am the vengeance, a link between the worlds
Souring in legions, controller of all
I am the substance of the chaos
There's one dominion, an evil and divine
Spawn the inferno, oblivion calls
Don't look for sanctuary coming
The end is calling
Deceive and destroy
Afterlife - revelations unveil
A blackness remains, the end of the line
Ashes of man, eye of the one divine
The blackness ascends, powers untold
The Afterlife
The heart of chaos, will manifest again
The seed of the serpent, the dagger of doom
So even death can die in deadland
The phantom's aeon
Dream is denied
Afterlife - revelations revive
