Hear us prince of darkness 
Guide us to our dreams 
To hold the seven keys 
To rule the world beneath 
We crave the blackest love 
As we gaze on through the gate 
Now thy name we call out 
Give us lord of evil 
Thy touch shall atone 
Through the sea of flames 
The seven gates we see 
We await the black salvation 
We light the thirteen candles 
Now thy name we call out 
Lay of ennui king of the lore 
Lay of ennui hear our call 
Lay of ennui prince of the darkness 
Lay of ennui we abide 
Through the darkest night 
Guide us to our dreamsow in front of thee 
But you won't hear 
As the flames of evil arose 
We draw the sign in the blood 
Now thy name we call out
