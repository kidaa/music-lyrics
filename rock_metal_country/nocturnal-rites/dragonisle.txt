By the power of our father's rusty 
swords 
We are standing proud and strong 
Under banner and king our soil 
Drinks blood of the enemy 
From here we see through the raven's eyes 
We ride the winds of north 
And from cups of silver we drink from 
The dragon's blood 
Standing tall 
STAND TALL 
To fight them all 
FIGHT THEM ALL 
For Dragonisle 
Through the Seven winds of Wrath we 
Called 
Called up to the gods 
With steel at our sides we defend the 
dragonisle 
Baptised in the dragon's blood 
We hail our king with pride 
And in the fire, for aye one with the king
