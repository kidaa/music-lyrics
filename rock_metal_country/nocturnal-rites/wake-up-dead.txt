Ride, hell's in fury, an evil in believe
Wrath upon the dead and dreaming
Lie, sins subliminal, I twist in harmony
Blood upon my darkest day
Slit my wrist and watch me bleed
Tighten the noose around my neck
Fear the evil, turn the lights
Wake up dead
I'm falling
I can hear it whisper as I desecrate myself
Wake up dead
It's calling
Wake up dead - alive
Die, life's expendable, taking my last breath
Waiting for my death I'm grieving
Why, in the darkest hours, I can hear my call
Hell for now and evermore
The sins will not justify, the blood on my hands
I'm twisting the knife
Reality is no more, I'm waking up dead and alive
