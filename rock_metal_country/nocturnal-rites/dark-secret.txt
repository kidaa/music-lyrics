The sun fades away as a distant flame
against the sky
Beyond the clouds lies
the undiscovered truth
A realm still not known to man
and the powers it possesses
Now the time is soon at hand so beware
Destined to doom by a force of the unknown
the answer still not far away
You all may wonder what lies beyond
Passing away through the eye of the storm
Sealed up inside so untouched, so secured
In The eye of the strm lies the seceret alone
In dark deep inside, a power so strong
The sky starts dividing,
and sends its wrath down to earth
The fallen ones emerge out of the mist
With powers never seen before,
and the secret it withholds
Another victim of the secret
had come forth
Destined to doom by...
Through the eye of the storm ...
