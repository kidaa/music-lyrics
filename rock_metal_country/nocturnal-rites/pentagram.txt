They set sails towards the sea
Only brave men with hearts of steel.
To embark upon the journey
And bring the treasure back.
They will head the old man's words
As he wrote so long ago
"Go and find the treasure
and live for evermore."
For thousand days they sailed
Towards a distant world.
Reaching to where heaven ends
Beyond the stars- to find the pentagram.
Now the skys fades to black
Strong winds tear the sails apart.
Above them roaring thunder
That echos in the night.
Mighty waves cast the ship aside
One hundred men go down.
Everyone but one man
That lived on to be free.
Long ago they sailed away
To a land beyond the stars.
One man brought the fortune home
And lived for evermore.
