A knight is sworn to valour
And his heart knows only only virtue
His blade defends the helpless
And his might upholds the weak
Loyal to his kingdom
When the word of war goes out
Born to serve the nobel
When Kings and Queens request
Mount horse and head away
Sharpened steel, crossing blades, 
Before fear, do your work 
The King's command 
His word will be the law that we command 
The King's command
Out into the battlefield
Whoose blood will stain the ground?
Courage and our bravery 
Protects the borderlines
Plunging our steel into the hearts of enemy May our troops be many, 
for the fight has just begun
Heed the command
Never surrender
Fight till the death
Never break the oath.
