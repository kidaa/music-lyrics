I'm waking up all alone
Not knowing where I am
Is this a dream or is this time for real
Will I forget about the past
Or will I end this way
If this is the way, how will I find it
Give me a sign I'll carry on
Still lost in time 
Forever
Forever lost in time
Standing here in a world so cold
This silence makes me mad
I wander endless miles to find the truth
My future lies ahead
I got this second chance
