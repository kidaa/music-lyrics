"Look at me, I am a dying man. 
My son, I can no longer watch over you. 
All I know, I have passed onto you, 
as you will for others. 
It is my gift to you. Leave on your own, 
leave this all behind. 
You bear the powers of a second sight, 
you hold the courage to believe. 
No swords, no magic, no spell can touch what you own." 
Now you stand alone, I leave my throne for you
Seek and find the truth, my mission here is done
Set your aims up high, you bear the second sight
I now pass onto you the knowledge of the wise
You were the firstborn and chosen to be king
Lead your troops, and I'll be there
Your legend lives on
Your name is carved in stone
The story of the chosen one, one couraged to believe
It's the destiny of bringing it all home
Holds the sense of time to come
In my name, the legend lives on
My names says victory, so I ride ahead of all
My mission will not fail, for vengence is my thirst
Return with and filled with calm and glorois to be 
Now we stand as one and the legend will live on
On the winds rides the memory
Of your time long gone
