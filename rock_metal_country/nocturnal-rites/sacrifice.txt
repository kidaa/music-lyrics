Trapped in a world, where nothing is real
Lost in the fires of hell
Possessed I obey, in shadows I kneel
A sacrament, venom released
I hear'em calling, gripping for my soul
Schizophrenia, the eyes of the death unfold
Tormented mind, soul of black
Lock up in chains forever
Petrified heart eases the pain
I'll be my sacrifice
Shattering world, I will not betray
Rigid I await my command
The whisper is near; it's leading the way
Death - the final demand
Turned around for another side of life
