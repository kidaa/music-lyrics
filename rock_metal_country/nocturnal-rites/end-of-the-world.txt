The propheey tells of the powers so strong
There's no chance to be saved from the fate
There's no future for life, but the fire still burns
And the world ill soon reach its end.
All eyes of this world shall witness
The coming of the propheey.
Stand the chance, stand in faith.
It's the end, it's the end of the world
Heaven's falling down
The sun will turn black and then heaven shall fall
An earthquake is shaking the ground.
Open the seals and the secret unfolds
As we witness the fall of the earth
The sun loosing shape and heaven starts falling.
There's no chance to be saved from this fate.
