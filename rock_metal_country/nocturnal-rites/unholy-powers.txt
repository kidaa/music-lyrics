Long before the number is at hand
The conjuring will take it all again
The prophecy is telling us of wisadry and fear
It's time to seek and haunt the land
In darkness they will gather once again
The wisdom might conceal or gain
Unholy powers are taking control
When the spell of the night's setting in
Unholy powers, we're all cast aside
Cause the night of the witch never ends
In the time when darkness now ruled the world again
After all was done, and laid to waste
The conjuring will take its toll and start it all
Death will be the outcome in this spell
Stand tall fight the force, the night will come to fall
Stand tall fight them all, unholy powers are taking control
