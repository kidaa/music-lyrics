Long ago in an ancient time
Might men would gather
To witness what the prophet would proclaim
He spoke of powers and endless might
The gift of a second sight
See all the secrets in the unknown
Ride the storm, ride to be
Infinity lies open to read
Eternity Holds
It would blacken the sun forever
Magic will prevail
It makes the sky burst into flames
Speak the words of the mystery
And the world will come to fall
It's their will, their time has come to stay
