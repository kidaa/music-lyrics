Long before time when darkness 
was ruling the world
And in the shelter of night when the wicked
would gather again so see through the eyes of
the future they put on the spell In turn to gain 
in the powers they wait for the sign
It's a wicked game that the bravest 
would dread to fight 
Only for one man that's sent to end raging madness
Oh... When fire comes to ice
Oh... When fire comes to ice, then you will burn
Chained by the powers of magic,
they're loosing control 
Stare through the eyes of the
death and speak the words
