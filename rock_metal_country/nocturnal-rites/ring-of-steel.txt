The queen sent out a message,
she heard about the ring 
With powers that no man,
that no man would dare to face
The warrior headed north,
riding through the night alone
Searching night and day for the
secret of the ring
The secret of the legend
lives forever 
The legend brought the queen together 
In from the darkness the warrior returned
and the ring that he held in his hand,
had the powers
To freeze the world, 
while the queen would bring madness
It's the ring of steel
A new day is rising,
the queen is laughing still
The ring that she wears
it's the evil itself
The secret of the legend lives forever
The legend brought the queen together
In from the darkness the warrior returned
and the ring that he held in his hand, had the powers
To freeze the world, 
while the queen would bring madness
It's the ring of steel
The ring was founded again
by the rightful owners strong demand
The queen is laughing still out of control
