Through the winds of death we ride 
I swing my sword up high 
You'll taste my steel, I won't abide 
Cause you know you are gonna die 
Clad in leather and chains we slay 
We fight for king and land 
We'll burn your homes and bring you dismay 
With our vast swords in hand 
Glory, victory, forever hail 
Howl in mighty rage 
Clad the sky bleak 
Claw the hide of enemy 
Hail the winds of death 
We spread the ashes of your dead 
There is nothing left to save 
We sear the ground where they bled 
We pledge doom upon your grave 
Make them cry and bleed 
The storm shall howl and now descend 
Hordes of shade, they call, they heed 
They call, they heed
