The stillnest of the night is here 
Our brothers of the world are standing alone
To take a stand when time has come
We'll lead the revolution through the streets
The time is now to fight the world
Join our hearts in unity now brothers of all
Stand together and our voices will be heard
When all is lost and nothing is gained.
Then I will change the world
When all is done we'll stand as one
We won, our trail through life is done
We'll lead the revolution through the streets
The time is now to fight the world
Join our hearts in unity now brothers of all
Stand together and our voices will be heard
When all is lost and nothing is gained.
Then I will change the world
