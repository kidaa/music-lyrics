There's something in the dark
There's something is us all
The fear of dying has no end
the fire in our eyes
Will keep our faith alive
The burning flame will last forever
In our dreams the curse lives on and on
'Till light breaks the spell
The memory still haunts us down
All because of the curse
There's something we all know
In the past down below
That haunts our minds and dreams together
We're searching for the way
Below the unknown truth
The burning flame will last forever 
In our dreams the curse lives on and on
'Till light breaks the spell
The memory still haunts us down
All because of the curse
