Strike the anvil and forge the steel
See the iron glow like fire
Create our armour, provide us all
Give us the power to foresee our fate
Oh the journey might long and hard
Magical wonders will lead us there
And by the powers that we hold in hand
Forged steel in a time of war,
feel the rage and the strike of the Iron Force
Lay down your magic, lay down your arms
Bring us message of the fight we won
See us coming, through the fire
Stand united for the ones we lost
Brothers unite and fight for the justice
Honour for all and never give in
Fight till the end, protecting the crown
Honour for all, till we fall will fall 
And feel the rage and the strike of the iron sword
