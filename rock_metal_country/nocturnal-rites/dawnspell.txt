The Spell of the dawn has been cast 
Like the storm rides the wind 
It clouds darkness and evil 
To come on strong again 
It follows the sign of the one 
The bringer of thunder and storm 
Voices of darkness now call out 
The one to ride again 
Riding out instorm under cover 
Look out for the dawn and its power 
The spell is cast as it rides the wind 
Standing tall holy defenders 
Come on strong before the dawn 
And the night will come and spell will 
Rise again 
The curse of the spell has brought fear 
To the people again 
They run from the curse for they dread 
The spell of dawn they've seen 
There is no way to run from the spell 
The bringer of thunder and storm 
Voices of darkness anew called out 
And the ones they rode again
