Look the beast in the eye, set it free
The animal will be unchained
See deep within, and you'll find what you seek
The powers will lie there unbound
The eye of the mind unfolds the unreal
Open the doors that where closed
Broken the seal to a new world within
Stand in the gateway to hell
Walk through the fire, let no one stand in your way
The unknown waits in the darkness alone
I am falling fast
I'm right in the final hour
Future turns to past
Been sent to hell and back
Nailed to a cross and I spit in disgust
No way that I'll follow the blind
Broken down the shackles that fettered my mind
The devil laughs by my side
Look in my eyes, and see what I've become
Come hell, come fire, I'm not afraid - perpetual at last
