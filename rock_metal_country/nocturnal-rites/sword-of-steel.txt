Riding out in darkness 
Hoarding no fear 
Toward horizons 
Dyed in black 
We drew the circle once again 
Around the pentagram 
Our swords drip in crimson 
To conjure the one 
Sign of evil Rides us through 
We see the flames of hell arise 
As we open the gates 
Sword of stell must be held up high 
Somber shades of death we ride 
Sword of steel will laude the one 
Sword of steel will crack the sky 
For aye the one will rise in shadows 
He holds the key to infinity 
Open the gates, swing my sword up high 
Sword of steel alk in darkened vapour 
Clad in veils of night 
Unholy powers will rise again 
We complete the ceremony 
To hail-side by side
