Called out to load the ships 
They are sailing at dawn 
With hundred men at their side 
Flames from a distance 
Lighting up the sky 
And the warriors will rise 
Armed with swords and arrows 
Battle begins 
They will fight for their pride 
The sound of steel echoes in the night 
The wind cries out loud 
Into the night they are calling 
To the ones dying brave 
May they now rest in peace 
Forever the battle is won 
Twenty of the men are 
Slowly going down 
But the treasures are found 
Back on the ship, the survivors 
Scream out - the battle is won 
The twenty men who couldn't 
Make it to share their victory 
May they now rest in peace 
On the dragonisle, they are buried 
Side by side 
Hail to their pride
