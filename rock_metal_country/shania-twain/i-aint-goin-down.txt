I'm gonna hold on
It's what I believe in
So strong
No matter how long
No one
Can tell me I'm wrong
I ain't goin' down

I had a baby at fifteen
Daddy never did forgive me
I never heard from that guy again
Ohh.. I had to drop outta high school
Everybody treated me so cruel
But I didn't give in and give her away. 

Chorus:
I'm gonna hold on
'Cause what I believe in
So strong..
No matter how long
No one..
Can tell me I'm wrong
I ain't goin' down 

Her smile got me
Through the day
And every night I pray..
I can give her enough
At night..
I lay awake and cry
Hopin we get by
'Cause you can't live on love 

I work nine to eight
To keep us going
Through the sweat and tears
Without her knowin'
It was worth it..
Just to watch her grow
Ohh.. at least I was able to hold her
Whenever she needed my shoulder
I'm so glad I never let her go 

Chorus: 

Her smile got me
Through the years
Dried away the tears
It filled me with hope
At night..
I lay awake and cry
Prayed we would get by
For the courage to go 

Her smile got me
Through the day
And every night
I prayed I could give her enough 

Chorus: 2x 

No one can tell me I'm wrong
I ain't going down.
