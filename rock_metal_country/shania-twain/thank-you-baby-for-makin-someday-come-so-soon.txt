Ohh.. Thank you baby
For loving me like you do!

I didn't like dating
Trying to find someone
I gave up waiting..
For love to come along
There had to be some way
I knew I'd find it someday 

Chorus:
Thank you baby..
For making some day come so soon
Thank you baby..
For loving me the way you do 

So many numbers
So many guys to call
Is it any wonder..
I got nowhere at all
Ohh.. well I had to be some way
I knew I'd find it some day 

Chorus: 

Thank you baby..check it out 

There had to be some way
I knew I'd find it some day 

Chorus: 2x 

Baby.. some way.. some day.. somewhere
Ohh thank you baby.. for loving me like you do
Ohh.. thank you baby
