When he opens the door and says I'm home
Be aware of the look in his eyes
They tell you the mood he's in
What kind of day its been

They'll be times where he wont say a word
And you'll wonder if its something you've said
A gentle touch of your hand
Will tell him you understand

For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can
For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can

He's a man and a man has to try
Let them run let them fall let them cry
His world wont fall apart
If you take him into your heart

For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can
For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can

He's a man and a man has to try
Let them run let them fall let them cry
His world wont fall apart
If you take him into your heart

For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can
For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can
