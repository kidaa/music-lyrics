I'm having me a party, 
I don't think I can come 
This ain't just any kind of party, 
I think I'll stay at home 
It's gonna be really, really hot, 
It's starting to sound good 
I'm gonna put you on the spot, 
Baby, maybe I should 
They'll be lots of one on one, 
I guess I could be there 
Come on and join the fun, 
What should I wear? 

Bridge 
I'll tell you about it, 
it doesn't matter what you wear 
'Cause it's only gonna be, 
you and me there 

Chorus 
I'm having a party, a party for two 
I ain't inviting nobody, nobody but you 

You'll be sexy in your socks, 
We could polish the floors 
In case anybody knocks, 
Let's lock all the doors 
Yeah, all the things I'm gonna do, 
I'm gonna do with you 
I'm gonna try something new, 
I wanna try that too 

I'll tell you about it, 
it doesn't matter what I wear 
'Cause it's only gonna be, 
you and me there 

I'm having a party, a party for two 
I ain't inviting nobody, nobody but you 

Yeah, you, 
I'm here 
You're there 
That's all we really need 
We're, we're gonna party hardy 
Just, just you and me 
Don't, don't think about now 
Don't, don't even doubt it now 
I'm inviting you to a party for two 

Shake it, shake it 

Come on baby 
All the things I'm gonna do, 
I'm gonna do with you 
I'm gonna try something new, 
I wanna try that too 

I'll tell you about it, 
it doesn't matter what you wear, 
'Cause it's only gonna be, 
it's only gonna be you and me
