Hallelujah, hallelujah,
God bless the child who suffers
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
God bless the young without mothers 
This child is homeless,
That child's on crack
One plays with a gun,
while the other takes a bullet in his back
This boy's a beggar,
That girl sells her soul
They both work the same street,
The same hell hole 

Hallelujah, hallelujah,
God bless the child who suffers
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Let every man help his brother 

Some are born addicted and some are just thrown away
Some have daddies who make them play games they don't want to play 

But with hope and faith
We must understand
All God's children need is love
And us to hold their little hands 

This boy is hungry, he ain't got enought to eat
That girl's cold and she ain't got no shoes on her feet 

When a child's spirit's broken
And feels all hope is gone
God help them find the strength to carry on 

But with hope and faith
Yea, we can understand
All God's children need is love
And us to hold their little hands 

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Let us all love one another
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Make all our hearts bilnd to color
Hallelujah, hallelujah
God bless the child who suffers
