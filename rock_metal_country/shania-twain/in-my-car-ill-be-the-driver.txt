You can choose a channel..
When we're watching the T.V.
Oh babe, it's okay
And you can pick the flavor
When we're ordering ice cream
I don't mind.. if that's fine
I do.. do anything for you

It's alright if we sleep..
With your socks on
Oh babe, it's okay
And you can hurt my head
With your favorite rocks song 

Bridge:
I don't mind.. if that's fine
For you.. there's nothing
That I wouldn't do
You could put a hole
In my shoe 

Chorus:
In my car..
I'll be the driver
In my car..
I'm in control
In my car..
I come alive
In my car..
I am the driver 

Watch me now!
you can blame me..
when you run out of razors
Oh babe, it's okay
And I don't wanna frown
When you ask me for favors

Bridge:
Chorus: 

I don't mind..
If you think you're the strong one
Oh babe, it's okay
And you can have your way
Honey, even when you're wrong

Bridge:
Chorus:
