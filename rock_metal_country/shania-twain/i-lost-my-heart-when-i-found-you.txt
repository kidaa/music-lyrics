Kiss me all over is all I can say
I've waited a lifetime to feel this way
You leave me breathless
And out of my mind.
I'm just so helpless
So baby be kind

I lost my heart
When I found you
Yeah, it feels so good
To lose
I lost my heart
When I found you.
I lost my heart to you

You touched me in places
Deep in my heart
Imagination runs wild in the dark
Babe, I surrender
Only to you.
I can't remember
How it feels to be blue

I lost my heart
When I found you
Yeah, it feels so good
To lose
I lost my heart
When I found you
I lost my heart to you

You leave me breathless
And out of my mind
I'm just so helpless
So baby be kind

I lost my heart
When I found you.
Yeah, it feels so good
To lose
I lost my heart
When I found you
I lost my heart to you.
