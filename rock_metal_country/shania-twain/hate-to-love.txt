Midnight sky shining on my face
I feel the waves embracing me
I'm here to find
Some peace of mind
Time and time
Waits for me
It waits for me, yeah

So here I am again
Somewhere in between
Hate to love
Trying to find reality
In a dream
Hate to love
I'm afraid to say I need someone like you
Hate to love
I hate to love

Faded photographs
Of a picture-perfect love
Locked inside this frame of mind
Forgiving true is a trust betrayed
If time heals all it left me behind
It left me behind

So here I am again
Somewhere in between
Hate to love
Trying to find reality
In a dream
Hate to love
I'm afraid to say I need someone like you
Hate to love
I hate to love

Loneliness and innocence
As you invade my heart
I love to hate the truth of love
It's tearing me apart

So here I am again
Somewhere in between
Hate to love
Trying to find reality
In a dream
Hate to love
I'm afraid to say I need someone like you
Hate to love
I hate to love
