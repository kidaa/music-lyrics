This friend of mine, he looks real good
He drives a fast car and lives in Hollywood
He treats me like his little sis'
I gotta let him know I want more than this

His girlfriend Jane is a prissy brat
I dont know what he sees in that
He thinks she's cool in her short tight dress
You take away the glamour and she's just a mess

Luv eyes
Speak to me as more than just a friendv Luv eyes
Will this dream ever end

I got L-U-V eyes looking at you
I got a B-I-G heart made for two
You could feel the same if you only knew
I got L-U-V eyes looking at you

Gonna close my eyes and take a deep breath
I wanna be strong but I'm scared to death
Gonna put your arms around my waist
And tell you that I love you right to your face

Luv eyes
Speak to me as more than just a friend
Luv eyes
Will this dream ever end

I got L-U-V eyes looking at you
I got a B-I-G heart made for two
You could feel the same if you only knew
I got L-U-V eyes looking at you

This friend of mine, he looks real good
Guess who made it to Hollywood
No more Jane I got her beat
Now I'm sitting pretty in the front seat

Luv eyes
Look at me and let the feeling out
Heaven
The two of us in love

I got L-U-V eyes looking at you
I got a B-I-G heart made for two
You could feel the same if you only knew
I got L-U-V eyes
I got L-U-V eyes looking at you
I got a B-I-G heart made for two
You could feel the same if you only knew
I got L-U-V eyes
I got L-U-V eyes
