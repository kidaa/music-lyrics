Don't wanna wait in line uh, uh 
It's such a waste of time uh, uh, uh 
Won't find me on the couch uh, uh 
Sleepin' like a slouch uh, uh, uh 

I don't like sittin' down doin' nothin' 
I'd rather spend my time doin' somethin' 
Ain't no need to plan it 
jump right in and jam it 
No need to say no oh, oh, oh 

[Chorus:] 
I'm not in the mood I'm not in the mood 
I'm not in the mood To be shy 
to stand by and not give it a try 
No, I'm not in the mood 
I'm not in the mood To stay home 
be alone--face the night on my own 
No, I'm not in the mood to say 
to say to sayto say no! 

I won't be layin' low uh, uh 
It's not my style to take it slow uh, uh, uh 
No, it ain't like me to slack uh, uh 
There's no time for holdin' back 
uh, uh, uh 

I won't be sittin' down doin' nothin' 
I'd rather spend my time doin' somethin' 
Ain't no need to plan it 
jump right in and jam it 
No need to say no oh, oh, oh 
Uh 

[Repeat Chorus] 

Uh, uh, mmmm 
Ha, ha 
I'm jumpin' right in 
Oh, yeah, huh 
Jumpin' right in 
Uh, I'd rather spend my time doin' 
somethin' 
I won't be sittin' 'round doin' nothin' 
Ain't no need to plan it 
jump right in and jam it 
No need to say no--oh, oh, oh, uh 

[Repeat Chorus]
