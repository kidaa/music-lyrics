I'll be there when you're sleepin'
and every hour you're awake
I wann hear your secrets--
wanna share your worries
Wanna go the deepest--
I don't wanna hurry
I wanna take a lifetime to
memorize your face
Wanna hold you closer--kiss you longer
Wanna hear your heartbeat--
stronger and stronger

Wanna know you all over
Till I know you be heart
Gotta know you with all that I got

I wanna know you that good!
Like no one knows you
Gonna reach way down deep in your mind
I wanna get to know you--
wanna get to know you
Wanna get to know you that good

Gonna know you right through
You know I want to
So badly it hurts all the time

Every feel of your fingers-
every curl in your hair
Don't wanna miss a minute--
wanna be right in it
Do everything you're doin'--

Wanna know you all over
Till I know you by heart
Gotta know you with all that I got

I wanna know you that good!
