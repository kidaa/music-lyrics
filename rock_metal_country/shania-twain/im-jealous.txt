If I were the moon, I could
catch your eye--I'm jealous of the moon
If I were the wind, I would
make you fly--I'm jealous of that too

I wish I were the sun shining
on your face--caressing like a lover
I would wrap you in a warm embrace--
we'd be holdin' one another
I'm jealous of the sun
I'm jealous of the sun
Jealous of the sun Oh,
I'm jealous of the sun

Oh, I don't wanna share you with
nothing else--I gotta have you to myself
Oh--I can't help it--I'm so in love--
I just can't get you close enough, no

When the sun's on your skin--
I can't hold it in
And I know it's a sin--
but I'm jealous of the sun

I wish I were the rain runnin' down your
neck--and drippin' from your fingers
Then I could be the drops rollin' off your
back--I'd love to let it linger
Jealous of the rain Oh,
I'm jealous of the rain

Oh, I don't wanna share you with nothing
else--I gotta have you to myself
Oh--I can't help it--I'm so in love--
I just can't get you close enough, no

When it rains on your face--
I almost can taste
Your beauty, your grace--
I'm jealous of the rain

When the wind's in your hair--
the way it blows through the air
Oh, it's seems so unfair, yeah

When the moon's in your eyes--
you seem to light up the skies, yeah
And I realize--
I'm even jealous of the moon
