It's over today
The heat is gone, time is gone
F for fake
I feel no wrong, hide no wrong
I love this place, the lights
Under this face, so dry
Only way to change, give yourself away
Don't be ashamed, next in line
Close one eye, just walk by
In these days
I'm breathing stone, crying alone
I'll win this race
I'll leave alone, arrive alone
Love this place, the lights
Under this face, so dry
Stripped to the bone
I did no wrong
Truth is my name
Give yourself away
F for fake [4 times]
