Know it sounds funny but I just can't stand the pain
Girl I'm leaving you tomorrow
Seems to me girl you know I've done all I can
You see I begged, stole and I borrowed
Yeah
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like sunday morning
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like sunday morning
I wanna be high
Soo high
I wanna be free to know the things I do are right
I wanna be free
Just me
Oh baby
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like sunday morning
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like sunday morning
