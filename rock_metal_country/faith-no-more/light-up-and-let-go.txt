The way you're holding me
I'm gonna blow up in your face
You know the way
You gotta light up and let go
I won't, I won't, I won't
You'd better let go
Let go
You better let go
You wanted flames
But now your tears won't put out the blaze
Before you run away
Know that I cannot let go
I won't, I won't, I won't
You'd better let go
Let go
You'd better leg go

The way you're holding me
I'm gonna blow up in your face
You know the way
You gotta light up and let go
