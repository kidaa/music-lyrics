They all know me by my car
They all know I'm gone, but not how far
I'm heading straight down 101
I'm going to go and get me some
My lips are movin' but there's no sound
Someday somebody's gonna get run down
E non posso dirigir
E agora a pares
Ne dedu indehado
No ne naris
My lips anr movin' but there's no sound
Someday somebody's gonna get run down
