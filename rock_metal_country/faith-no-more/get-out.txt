What if there's no more fun to have ?
And all I've got is what I had
What if I have forgotten how ?
Cut my losses and get out now
Get out right now
There's something stronger than me
There's something I don't want to see
A new thing growing in me
It is the hardest thing to do
To watch it grow on top of you
And see you're just like everyone
No fun
