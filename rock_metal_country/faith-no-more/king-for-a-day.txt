6:35
It is not a good day, if you are not looking good
This is the best party that I've ever been to
Today I asked for a god to pour some wine in my eyes
Today I asked for someone to shake some salt on my life
Look !
Everything's spinning
We're on the ground
Never cheer before you know who's winning
Don't make a sound
Sniff the glass and let it roll around on you tongue
Let me introduce you to someone before the party is done
Someone to look to in need or in want or in war
If you give hime everything, he may give you even more
This is the best party I've ever been to
Don't let me die with that sillky look in my eyes
