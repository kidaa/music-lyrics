Star A.D.
See tomorrow dreamin'
You don't need your freeom
Star A.D.
A little joke that's understood
All over the world
A little joke that's understood
It's all over and over and over and over
And dying is dry -
Like a fact of history
And when you die, you'll become something worse
Than dead -
You'll become
A legend
We are forever
