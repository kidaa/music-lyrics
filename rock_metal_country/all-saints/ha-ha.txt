Ha Ha, Ha Ha
Laugh out loud
Ha Ha, Ha Ha Ha
Laugh out loud

Could it be, I left my mother, and my father, and my sister
Looking for a job to pay the rent and buy my dinner
Found it, soooo boring
You see my life revoved around a long time lover
Music was his game I had no time or any other, interest 
This was my whole life

You cant sing
If you wanna make a lady
Stop dreaming, I'm some little girl
I wouldnt listen to them sayin'
I just kept smiling, all had me singin' now

1-2, Whats a girl to do
I said 3-4, I'm gonna laugh some more
C'mon 5-6, Gettin' a stitch
You never know you'll never ever break me baby

1-2, Whats a girl to do
I said 3-4, I'm gonna laugh some more
C'mon 5-6, Gettin' a stitch
You never know you'll never ever break me baby

Now at times I use find myself involved with another
Strobing to try and beat the game without going under
Slowly...yeah time's still going
I cant believe the way some people want to start love is,
To try and take your sense of pride 
Must be fulfillin' if you've got no feelin'

You cant sing
I thought I already told yo that
Stop dreaming, 
Now get yo'self back into class
Can't you see, whatever you are trying to achieve
Results in nothin'

1-2, Whats a girl to do
I said 3-4, I'm gonna laugh some more
C'mon 5-6, Gettin' a stitch
You never know you'll never ever break me baby

1-2, Whats a girl to do
I said 3-4, I'm gonna laugh some more
C'mon 5-6, Gettin' a stitch
You never know you'll never ever break me 

As I laugh, ha ha, you can kiss my ass
Ah- you guys thought I live a non-existant life
Thats right, you thought I might not make it on my own
I got my own car, gold card, took on my own home

Gotta get back to livin' my dreams
Those ambition I had to achieve
Try to ruin me, you cant cool me down son
I'll prove you wrong, I'll sing my song
When you pass, I'll do a lap

If bring me me down
I'll just laugh out loud
Start to laugh a little harder mummy
...On the run
As I laugh out loud

1-2, Whats a girl to do
I said 3-4, I'm gonna laugh some more
C'mon 5-6, Gettin' a stitch
You never know you'll never ever break me baby

1-2, Whats a girl to do
I said 3-4, I'm gonna laugh some more
C'mon 5-6, Gettin' a stitch
You never know you'll never ever break me baby

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Laughing now, laughing now
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Laughing now,
Look who's laughing now
