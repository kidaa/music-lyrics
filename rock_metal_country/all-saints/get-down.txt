The way you're movin' your body,  
Ain't showin me nothing Work that body, work that body  
Gotta loosen the tie, dont be shy  
We can do this  

I know this aint a place you've been before  
Excuse me, nice hat!  
Gotta take it with ease, be free,  
Let your mind explore  

Cos I'm tellin you something something  
Something that's holding you back  
So I'm telling you baby baby  
Saints dont go for that!  

Dont be uptight its alright  
Its an All Saints party!  
Let it all out, let it all out

Gonna get get down  
Move your body round
