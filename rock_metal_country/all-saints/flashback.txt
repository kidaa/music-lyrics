[1st verse:]
I know myself and the shit that I do
It seems my mouth keeps on bothering you
I'll make my excuses, I'll apologise
Everybody changes when the music's right

[Chorus:]
Turn up the beats and join me on the dance floor dance floor
Rip off the sheets and you'll get what you ask for ask for
If you recognise me in the morning, don't tell me what I can't recall
What's that, flashback, are you ready for more?

[2nd verse:]
I'm mystified by the forces at work
And I'm too scared that I'm gonna get hurt
Jump into the fire, always getting burned
I can take the pressure, it's the way I've learned

[Chorus:]
Turn up the beats and join me on the dance floor dance floor
Rip off the sheets and you'll get what you ask for ask for
If you recognise me in the morning, don't tell me what I can't recall
What's that, flashback, are you ready for more?
What's that, flashback, are you ready for more?

[M8:]
Times are changing, don't fall behind
I'm not waiting
Not about to walk away cause I can see the future's mine

[Chorus:]
Turn up the beats and join me on the dance floor dance floor
Rip off the sheets and you'll get what you ask for ask for
If you recognise me in the morning, don't tell me what I can't recall
What's that, flashback, are you ready for more?
What's that, flashback, are you ready for more?
