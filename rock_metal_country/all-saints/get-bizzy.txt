Gotta get bizzy cos I know I'm down  
Gotta get bizzy cos I know I'm down  
Gotta, gotta, get bizzy, get bizzy cos I know, cos I know I'm down  
Gotta get bizzy cos I know I'm down  
Gotta get bizzy cos I know I'm down  
Gotta, gotta, get bizzy, get bizzy cos I know, cos I know I'm down  

It's not unusual to get bizzy all night  
It's not unusual to show ya how to do it right  
It's not unusual to wanna play games  
It's not unusual to do it in the pouring rain  

I gotta get bizzy, gotta get in line  
Take ya to my room and do it all night  
I gotta get down and show you how to flow  
Listen carefully so next time you know  
Grab me by the waist as we fall to the floor  
Do it like a man, give it to me hardcore  
No-one else around just me and you  
Don't be shy boy do what you gotta do  
And get bizzy  

Gotta get bizzy cos I know I'm down I gotta get  
Gotta get bizzy cos I know I'm down I gotta get  
I gotta get, gotta get bizzy cos I know I'm down  
Gotta get bizzy cos I know I'm down I gotta get  
Gotta get bizzy cos I know I'm down I gotta get  
I gotta get, gotta get bizzy cos I know I'm down  

It's not unusual to get bizzy every day  
It will be cool if you knew how to stand the pace  
It's not unusual to want 24 hour full pace  
Day and night, night and day, day and night 27, 7, 365 babe  

Do it on the floor, do it on the stream, do it in the bed and the love is still the same  
Do it in an elevator when no-one's around, do it anywhere cos u know I'm down  
Put my legs round your neck as you struggle to breathe,  
It's not unusual, put your hand between my knees  
Take a short break, sip on some champagne,  
But not for too long as we start all over again  

Gotta get bizzy cos I know I'm down I gotta get  
Gotta get bizzy cos I know I'm down I gotta get  
I gotta get, gotta get bizzy cos I know I'm down  
Gotta get bizzy cos I know I'm down I gotta get  
Gotta get bizzy cos I know I'm down I gotta get  
I gotta get, gotta get bizzy cos I know I'm down
