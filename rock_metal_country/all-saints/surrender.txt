Something in the wine
That accentuates the mood
I'm like a child at school
You're the blackboard I concentrate on you
You close the curtains, 
I am certain this is more than fun
Your fingers remove my clothes
As you let go
Beneath the floor one by one

I feel so sweet
As you kiss my feet
And you undress me as I ...
I feel so sweet
As you kiss my feet
And you undress me as I surrender my...

Surrender bounds you
Surrender, Surrender
Surrender, Surrender
Surrender, Surrender
Surrender, Surrender my...

Like a flower, you unfold
Leading a dance all on your own
And like a dead man I dont move

This is my moment,
This is my moment,
This is my moment
A magical moment

This is my moment,
This is my moment,
This is my moment,
A magical moment

Surrender, Surrender
Surrender, Surrender
Surrender, Surrender
Surrender, Surrender my...

See like, I believe that when two people meet,
And express themselves, its truly sweet.
Its a great form of communication, 
But it has to be the right combination.
Oh I know you're so right
With these feelings we could be spreading love throughout the nation, 
But you have to search, not just anyone will do.
Thats why, your mission is to find that someone who surrendered to you

I feel so sweet
As you kiss my feet
And you undress me as I surrender my...
I feel so sweet
As you kiss my feet
And you undress me as I surrender my...

To you....ooh
To you....ooh

I feel so sweet
As you kiss my feet
And you undress me as I surrender my...
I feel so sweet
As you kiss my feet
And you undress me as I surrender my...

Surrender, Surrender
Surrender, Surrender my, Surrender
Surrender, Surrender
Surrender, Surrender my, Surrender

Surrender, Surrender
Surrender, Surrender my, Surrender
Surrender, Surrender
Surrender, Surrender my
