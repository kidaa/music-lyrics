[Intro]

[1st verse:]
As soon as you saw my face in the video
You couldn't differentiate from life and your ego
Always hiding, always watching from the shadows
From London to Rio, always there even in Tokyo

Long and the days and lonely are the nights
Not much better from the world you left behind

[Chorus:]
Oh, oh, oh, it's time to stop and take a small moment
Oh, oh, oh, to figure out what makes you so different
Oh, oh, oh, 'cause in this world you know there are limits
Oh, oh, oh you crossed the line now you've got to go

[Instrumental]

[2nd verse:]
Even when I'm dancin' and hot in the disco hot in the disco
I find myself looking round in case you're watching where we go
How many times do I have to call the 5-oh oh oh
If you do it again your ass will end up in jail

Long and the days and lonely are the nights
Not much better from the world you left behind
I know you'll never see my eyes so clear and bright
But baby I'll be happy 'cause you're better off inside

[Chorus:]
Oh, oh, oh, it's time to stop and take a small moment
Oh, oh, oh, to figure out what makes you so different
Oh, oh, oh, 'cause in this world you know there are limits
Oh, oh, oh you crossed the line now you've got to go

Got to go, got to go now
Got to go, got to go now
Got to go, got to go now
Got to go, got to go now
Got to go, got to go now
Got to go, got to go now
