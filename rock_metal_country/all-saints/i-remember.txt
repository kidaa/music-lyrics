I like to say it's good to meet you  
An old face from the past  
Reminding me of moments  
The time we were all mad  
The times we stuck together,  
The times we fell apart  
Memories to be proud of  
A treasure here in my heart, yeah  

And now I see you here in the room  
I realized how we have changed  
How much I've missed you  
Our memories of the past stay the same  

I remember  
Babe, when you were mine  
I remember I remember  
I remember  
Babe, back in time  
I remember  

We partied long ago  
I cant believe that you're here  
Remember we said our last goodbyes  
And we shared out last tears  
Used to out I forgottenya  
Said I need you out here  
Schooldays are good to remember  
Memories last forever  

And now I see you here in the room  
I realised how we have changed  
How much I've missed you  
Our memories of the past stay the same  

I remember  
Babe, when you were mine  
I remember I remember  
I remember  
Babe, back in time  
I remember  

I remember  
Babe, when you were mine  
I remember I remember  
I remember  
Babe, back in time  
I remember  
Repeat to fade
