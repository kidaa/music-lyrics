I've taken every drug to ease my mind
Read every magazine to feel good
When you think you got it all just right
You come along and show me how it should be
I've taken every road there's to take
Found memories I know I gotta keep
Said goodbye to old school heartache
'Cause I know I won't be losing any sleep

I've been walking in the shadow of true life
I've been running in a race just to win
Backed into the corner of my mind
You come along from nowhere to save me yeah

[Chorus:]
It's too deep it's gone full circle
I breathe just by watching this grow
The foundation is clear I know
Baby your love is fundamental

Baby it's too deep
Baby your love is fundamental
Baby your love is fundamental

It's a journey that took so long to find
You're the best part of me
You traveled like you read my mind
You came to show me how it should b
Yeah it's too deep

It's too deep it's gone full circle
I breathe just by watching this grow
The foundation is clear I know
Baby your love is fundamental

Love you, love you, love you, love you.
