Here I go again, got a broken heart
This time I'll get stronger
No grieving 'til the break of dawn
Aint falling easily, move over

Dreams are dreams, 
Will alas come true
Skies are clear, leaving me bright and blue
I will raise my glass to my heart and say,
"Here's to tomorrow, not yesterday"

Here's not to dreams that dont come true
Here's not to what was me and you
Here's not to all the days gone by
And to the truth that lived a lie.

Dreams are dreams, 
Will alas come true
Skies will clear, leaving me bright and blue
I will raise my glass to my heart and say,
"Here's to tomorrow, not yesterday"

Dreams are dreams, 
Will alas come true
Skies will clear, leaving me bright and blue
I will raise my glass to my heart and say,
"Here's to tomorrow, not yesterday"

Dreams are dreams, 
Will alas come true
Skies will clear, 
Leaving me bright and blue
I will raise my glass to my heart and say,
"Here's to tomorrow....

My words are a whisper, in silence I shall...
No Hallmark card can spell it out.
Deep down inside, you know I care
There's nothing to say 'bout the love we shared.

Dreams are dreams, 
Will alas come true
Skies will clear, leaving me bright and blue
I will raise my glass to my heart and say,
"Here's to tomorrow, not yesterday"

Dreams are dreams, 
Will alas come true
Skies will clear, leaving me bright and blue
I will raise my glass to my heart and say,
"Here's to tomorrow, not yesterday"

Dreams are dreams, 
Will alas come true
Skies will clear, leaving me bright and blue
I will raise my glass to my heart and say,
"Here's to tomorrow, not yesterday"
