Time, space all over the place
Whenever you're near me
I'm here my feelings are clear
I've never felt so sure
You've changed the way I create
I'll go wherever it takes me
Pain, tears, lead us to here
You bring me so much joy

[Chorus:]
I don't know what you do
But I stagger and fall
Trip up in my shoes when I'm walking with you
We can fight, make up, whatever the mood
'Cause there's only one me and U

Here now is where I see how
My feelings can taint me
Cold, cool, sometimes misunderstood
That's not how I wanna be
The cause of pain through all of my shame
See I know you'd never waste me
Cos love my dear
Yes it leads us to here

I don't know what you do
But I stagger and fall
Trip up in my shoes when I'm walking with you
We can fight, make up, whatever the mood
'Cause there's only one me and U

[M8]

I don't know what you do
But I stagger and fall
Trip up in my shoes when I'm walking with you
We can fight, make up, whatever the mood
'Cause there's only one me and you
