Fortunately I've been blessed
Blessed with love and happiness
Happiness
Who'd have known a soul so...
Pure could reach and save my loneliness
Loneliness

When I think that,
Day to day I live a life so full of complications
So put by the thought of lies
But I just smile But I just smile
At the thought of you At the thought of you
By my side

Everyday my hopes evolve
When I see you
Now all around, my world is whole
I've no need to be insecure, I'm self-assured
Everytime I feel you,
I feel you

People fall and lose their way
Because of you I'll know, I'll stay
Know I'll stay, I know I'll stay
Guided by our love
I'll always have a reason to pave our way
Lovin' is leading the way

Never give up on your lovin'
You're the one that keeps my heart growin'
Never give up on your lovin'
You're the one that keeps my heart growin' growin'

Day to day I live a life so full of complications
So put by the thought of lies
But I just smile But I just smile
At the thought of you At the thought of you
By my side

Everyday my hopes evolve
When I see you
Now all around, my world is whole
I've no need to be insecure, I'm self-assured
Everytime I feel you,
I feel you

Everyday my hopes evolve
When I see you
Now all around, my world is whole
I've no need to be insecure, I'm self-assured
Everytime I feel you,

Never give up on your lovin'
You're the one that keeps my heart growin'
Never give up on your lovin'
You're the one that keeps my heart growin' growin'

Never give up on your lovin'
You're the one that keeps my heart growin'
Never give up on your lovin'
You're the one that keeps my heart growin' growin'
