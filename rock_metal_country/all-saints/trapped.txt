Gonna need some help

She sits in her armchair looking into space uh huh, uh huh
Looking for a reason, to find her lost place
Feeling a little bit sad sad, but not really all that bad uh huh, uh huh
Searching for a dream, a dream that she's never had

She knows she should get a life but it ain't that easy [Shaz, Nat & Nic]
Her life's kinda full up but its all too sleazy [Shaz, Nat & Nic]
She's going out of her mind
But she still can't hide, she can't leave her life, why

Trapped by your life [Nat & Nic]
Life that's unavoidable [Mel & Shaz]
Just to get by[Nat & Nic]
To make it more affordable [Mel & Shaz]

Can't afford that
Cos her pockets ain't fat
She can't afford that
So what she's gonna do now

She looks in the mirror - her reflection's someone old someone old
Seeing days gone by - she don't need to be told [Nat & Mel]
Feeling a little bit sad, she cries and packs her bags
Remembering a dream, a dream that she'll never have [Nat & Mel]

Where will she go but it ain't that easy [Nat, Shaz & Nic]
How long 'til she comes home but its all too sleazy [Nat & Nic]
Maybe she'll make it
Will she Or maybe not, what

Trapped by your life [Nat & Nic]
