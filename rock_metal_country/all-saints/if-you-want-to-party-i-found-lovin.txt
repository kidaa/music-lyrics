C'mon now, now
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo
Start it
Hey

Hey, what's up Gather round, everybody get down
It's time for the best party track in town
Kicking it live, keeping it real
Party on time, yeah, you know how we feel

You gotta get up and move side to side
You've gotta release and do it right
It's a funkadelic beat to a funkadelic song
Still kicking it live, with the main man, John

Saints in da house, you're doing it right
Cool rock a jam and party all night
So lets get started baby, you and I
Go on with your bad self, dance all night

So can you feel it, I can feel it hey,
Can you feel the beat Got the bass drum doing in your feet,
Hear the snare drum tapping in your ear
Yeah, you've gotta get up, gotta move your rear

That's, the way this heart is feeling for you [Shaz, Nat & Nic]
Cos no one does it better
Boy, there ain't no town just what I wanna do [Shaz, Nat & Nic]
So won't you let me switch on

Let's get started, if you wanna party
Baby it's just you and me
I got what you need
Don't conceal it, tell me can you feel it
Won't you let me lead the way,
Cos I wanna be your baby for life

Ooh, come on everybody, if you're here to party
get down, get down
Oh, if its gonna take all night
Mr DJ save my life, come on and get down

That's, the way this heart is feeling for you [Shaz, Nat & Nic]
Cos no one does it better
Boy, there ain't no town just what I wanna do [Shaz, Nat & Nic]
So won't you let me switch on

Let's get started, if you wanna party
Baby it's just you and me
I got what you need
Don't conceal it, tell me can you feel it
Won't you let me lead the way,
Cos I wanna be your baby for life

So on and on, on and on and on
check it, check it, check it out
to the break a break of dawn
As the bass drum stick it to your ear
Can you hear Move your rear
Wind your body to the beautiful snare

Guys grab a girl and take her from the back
Give it up, give it up, cos we like it like that
Girls grab a guy, showing that you ain't feeling shy
Keep it going as the bridge comes, keep in time

If its right, we could be, starting up, you and me
That's the way this heart is a feelin' for you [Shaz, Nat & Nic]
Get it on, what I need, DJ play that song for me
Time is right, in the mood, stepping with the old school
Boy, there ain't no doubt just what I wanna do [Shaz, Nat & Nic]

Let's get, lets get, hey
Hey, oh yeah, lets get started
I say baby, oooh, somebody gotta treat me right

Let's get started, Let's get started, let, if you wanna party, 
Baby its just you and me, I got what you need,
Don't conceal it, tell me can you feel it,
Won't you let me led the way,
Cos I wanna be your baby for life
