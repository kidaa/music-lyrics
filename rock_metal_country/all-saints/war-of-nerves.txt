Monday on the line,  

when you know now's the time, 
to leave and be free,  

Whoever your destiny, 
when that moment arrives,  

world's business to the mind, 
and all I see is what used to be,  

my life could seem via memory. 

I don't never want to feel your pain, ooohhhhh 
wanna be ready when you call my name,  
wanna be ready when you call my name aahhh 
I don't never want to feel you fear, ooohhh 
coz every night, it feels alright, when you're near......... 

Battle through this war of nerves, 

when your life, it takes a turn, 
what I have is what I feel,  

well in my mind, you're lying here,
