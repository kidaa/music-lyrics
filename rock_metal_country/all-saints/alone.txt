Not gonna, don't wanna, never gonna, don't wanna, wanna end up alone
Not gonna, never gonna, don't, don't wanna, wanna end up alone

I need to sit back and pick out, its about the way I'm making you feel,
You're trying to show me that you're happy, really happy, really happy [Mel, Nat & Nic]
But I can see that you're feeling don't for real
The unhappiness, I'm maybe causing you its definitely unintentional, definitely unintentional [Mel, Nat & Nic]

So don't hesitate, don't be afraid to tell me
Cos my actions are not personal, oh
But I'll tell you something right now

Not gonna, don't wanna, never gonna, don't wanna, wanna end up alone
Not gonna, never gonna, don't, don't wanna, wanna end up alone

I need you to be honest, really honest, and tell me what's on your mind 
Can't you tell me what's on your mind [Shaz, Nat & Nic]
Whatever the problem may be, tell me, oh
Cos the body never lies

Am I two hard two hard [Shaz, Nat & Nic], two soft two soft [Shaz, Nat & Nic],
Or am I really just selfish to the bone
So don't hesitate - I'm not psychic babe,
Let your feelings all be known, but I'll tell you something right now

Not gonna, don't wanna,never gonna, don't wanna, wanna end up alone
Not gonna, never gonna, don't, don't wanna, wanna end up alone

Oh, no, oh oh, not gonna , don't wanna, not gonna, don't wanna, don't know
not gonna , don't wanna, never gonna, don't wanna, don't know [Shaz, Nat & Nic]
Not gonna , don't wanna , not gonna, don't wanna, don't know
No, no, ooh [Shaz, Nat & Nic]
Oh, no, oh
Yeah Cool.
