Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in - the city of cities
Lonely as I am, together we cry we cry we cry

I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love - take me all the way
I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love - take me all the way

I drive on the streets, 'cos he's my companion
I walk through his fields, 'cos he knows who I am
He sees my good day, then he kisses me windy
I never worry - now that's a lie

I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love - take me all the way
I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love - take me all the way

1 time, 2 times, 3 times, 4 times

It's hard to believe there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have his love - the city he loves me
Lonely as I am, together we cry

I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love - take me all the way
I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love - take me all the way

I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love - take me all the way
I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love - take me all the way

All the way [x6]
