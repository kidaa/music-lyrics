Love is love
Love is love

Something just crept upon me
As you lay next to me this morning
As you looked up into my eyes
Suddenly I realised
What I've been searchin' for 
I no longer have to look no more
A chance to find my soulmate of...
Has released the woman I am.

Its a feeling no-one can describe No-one can describe
But I know the feeling's here tonight Is here tonight
Cos it has unleased me to my very soul To my very soul
All my demons, all my fears, I'm letting go I'm letting go

Love is a living a lie Not sure about this line
Its a gift, not an obligation
Cannot lead you to temptation
Love is love, not a game, 
And it should always remain so

Love is a living a lie     Not sure about this line
Its a gift, not an obligation
Cannot lead you to temptation
Love is love, not a game, 
And it should always remain so
