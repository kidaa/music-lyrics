Lift me up, take me high, 
Take me higher than I've been before,
I need time, time to find
The road to my destiny

Heaven help me
On a cloud, cloud of happiness is where I wanna be
Still in my mind, I'm running out of time
So heaven lift me up

Scared to laugh, scared to cry, 
For fear of my own contradiction
Maybe I should try and cover my real reason
For God's sake, heaven lift me up

Wasn't supposed to be this way
Got too much of my own say
Never thought that I'd be standing at the gates of heaven
At the gates of heaven, heaven lift me up

Come on and life me - lift me up, ooh-oh, yeah

Lift me high, above the clouds where the birds fly
I'm feeling free - let heaven do the work for me
Looking over this crazy city where we're living
I've seen it, done it, it's just the way I've been

Wasn't supposed to be this way
Got too much of my own say
Never thought that I'd be standing
At the gates of heaven....

At the gates of heaven - heaven lift me up
Come on lift me - lift me up, ooh-oh, yeah

Take it, move it, feel like it's yours
Hoping you'll find what you're looking for, baby
Baby
What you're looking for

Take it, move it, feel like it's yours
Hoping you'll find what you're looking for, baby
Baby
What you're looking for

I won't fake I won't fake
I won't break I won't break
No way no way
No [Shaz & Mel]
