Clap your hands if I say you what  
Clap your hands if I say you jump  
Clap your hands if I say you what  
Clap your hands if I say you jump  
Clap your hands if I say you what  
Clap your hands if I say you jump  
Clap your hands if I say you what  
Come on  
Come on  

I know I know I have far to go  
Then I have to much to learn  
Now it's down to fame  
But I just can't wait I just can't wait  
To find what I've been searching for  

I tried to ask my mother  
I tried to ask my father  
I tried to ask my lover  
I couldn't ask no other  
No need to look  upon others  
It's for me to discover  
I'm not looking any further  
I think I've found the answer  

Drive the love around  
Searchin for the sound  
When I realised  
It was all inside  
Showin me the way  
To my destiny  
Now I realise  
It comes from inside  

Just thinkin about  
Lessons in life  
How they're sometimes hard to learn  
Mistake after mistake  
Thought it was too late  
So I turned my world around  

I tried to ask my mother  
I tried to ask my father  
I tried to ask my lover  
I couldn't ask no other  
No need to look  upon others  
It's for me to discover  
I'm not looking any further  
I think I've found the answer  

Drive the love around  
Searchin for the sound  
When I realised  
It was all inside  
Showin me the way  
To my destiny  
Now I realise  
It comes from inside  

Come inside  
Do you wanna come inside?  
Come inside  
Do you wanna come inside?  

Time to find  
What's inside  
Time to turn it out  
What is everybody talkin about  
Sometimes situations seem right  
And I know I'm gonna be a-a-alright  

Drive the love around  
Searchin for the sound  
When I realised  
It was all inside  
Showin me the way  
To my destiny  
Now I realise  
It comes from inside  

Drive the love around  
Searchin for the sound  
When I realised  
It was all inside  
Showin me the way  
To my destiny  
Now I realise  
It comes from inside  

Clap your hands if I say you what  
Clap your hands if I say you jump  
Clap your hands if I say you what  
Come on  
Come on  
Clap your hands if I say you what  
Clap your hands if I say you jump  
Clap your hands if I say you what  
Come on  
Come on  
Clap your hands if I say you what  
Clap your hands if I say you jump  
Clap your hands if I say you what  
Come on  
Come on  

All around  
For a sound  
Showin me the way  
To my destiny  
Now I realise  
It comes from inside
