It's five the club you still haven't called me 
Boy you must be out your mind 
Hey, chico 
Amigo mio 
Stand me up you ain't guarapa 
It's 12 o'clock I'm hot 
And I'm ready 
I call my girls for a night on the town 
I give you a chance and I didn't hear nada 
And I'm about to let it all out ... 

He said 
One more tequilla, for the sexy seorita. 
He didnt call so see you 
She's coming home with me. 
And he said 
One more tequilla, for the sexy seorita 
He didn't call so see you 
She's sending you on your way 

After una tequilla y dos margaritas 
I am about to salsa salsa 
So come seor you sexy pap 
And make it home so cha cha cha cha 
I'm feeling a man who's trying to entice me 
I'm moving my body nice and slow 
He's watching me he looks so inviting 
But I ain't to tease and go home 

He said 
One more tequilla, boy for the sexy seorita, sexy seorita
