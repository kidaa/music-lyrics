Cos I don't wanna be alone  
I don't wanna be alone  
I don't wanna be alone,  
Wanna be alone  
Call my number when you get home!  
Don't wanna be alone  
No, no, no  
Talkin' to myself from dusk 'til dawn  
Ain't no fantasy, you and me  
I can just imagine how its gonna be  
We're getting hot alone  
Ain't no fun, so  
I don't wanna be alone  

I can voodoo  
Gonna spook you  
With floral symptoms in the afternoon  
I get headpains, got small things  
Every night with you is never the same  
Every minute I intent to pretend that you love me  
And I miss you more than this  
C'mon, we'll hang out,  
Get your clothes, leave the phone,  
And come over  
Cos I don't wanna be alone  

I don't wanna be alone  
I don't wanna be alone,  
Wanna be alone  
Call my number when you get home!  
Don't wanna be alone  
No, no, no  
Talkin' to myself from dusk 'til dawn  
Ain't no fantasy, you and me  
I can just imagine how its gonna be  
We're getting hot alone  
Aint no fun, so  
I don't wanna be alone  

At night do you think that I'm haunting you?  
When you sleep do you think of the things I do?  
Do you think that you can't committ to my constant demands?  
Constant demands for it  
Tell your friend but it aint no sin  
If he feels to join in  
You and me, me and you and him  

We'll hang out,  
Get your clothes, leave the phone,  
And come over Come over  

Midnight, midnight, midnight  
Call you Calling, calling you  
Hungry Hungry for your love, your love, your love  
Midnight Midnight, midnight  
Call you Calling, calling you  
Hungry Hungry for your love  
Cos I don't wanna be alone  

I don't wanna be alone  
I don't wanna be alone,  
Wanna be alone  
Call my number when you get home!  
Don't wanna be alone  
No, no, no  
Talkin' to myself from dusk 'til dawn  
Ain't no fantasy, you and me  
I can just imagine how its gonna be  
We're getting hot alone  
Aint no fun, so  
I don't wanna be alone  

I'll do voodoo  
Gonna spook you  
I don't wanna be alone  
I get headpains, got small things  
I don't wanna be alone  
Every minute I intent to pretend that you love me  
I don't wanna be alone  
We'll hang out,  
Get your clothes, leave the phone,  
And come over  
Cos I don't wanna be alone, no  

I don't wanna be alone  
I don't wanna be alone,  
Wanna be alone  
Call my number when you get home!  
Don't wanna be alone  
No, no, no  
Talkin' to myself from dusk 'til dawn  
Ain't no fantasy, you and me  
I can just imagine how its gonna be  
We're getting hot alone  
Aint no fun, so  
I don't wanna be alone  

C'mon, c'mon, c'c'mon

I don't wanna be alone  

C'mon, c'mon, c'c'mon
