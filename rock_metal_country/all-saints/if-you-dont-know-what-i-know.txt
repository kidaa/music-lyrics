Ever since I was the age of nine  
I really only felt that I could sing or rhyme  
Under the impression that this is a mic  
Making sure every dance step is right  
Way up in the mirror singing five star songs  
I wanna be shy - cah  
So I'm keep it real only doing what I know  
Writing phat beats and keeping the flow  

If you don't know what I know  
You won't know  
If you feel how I feel  
I feel you  
If you see what I see  
Come and see me  
If you hear what I hear  
You know me  

I know you like my style  
But do you like my flow Huh?  
I know you wanna get with me  
But have you got soul? What?  
No money in my pockets  
Would you take me as I am? Who?  
And if I wasn't beautiful  
Would you be my man?  

From Monday to Sunday  
I'm just working on my beats  
So if you don't know what I know  
Thats no good to me  

Hear the music, don't you lose it  
Let it take control  
When I see you've got it right  
Then I'll let you know, let you know  

If you don't know what I know  
You won't know  
If you feel how I feel  
I feel you  
If you see what I see  
Come and see me  
If you hear what I hear  
You know me  

Every player I hate says my group is whack  
We don't care y'all cos our pockets are fat  

Well actually girls no they're not  
But at least you get to be on Top Of The Pops  

We done plastic, platinum, silver, gold  
Do you really wanna know how many records we've sold?  
Let me tell you what other girl bands say  

When I was young nobody kissed my - Huh  
I was the skinny kid at the back of the class  
But now I've got curves - shapely and strong  
Every man, some women, wanna give me some more  
I don't do that cos it aint my thing  
If you wanna piece of this  
Gimme gimme the thing  

If you don't know what I know  
You won't know  
If you feel how I feel  
I feel you  
If you see what I see  
Come and see me  
If you hear what I hear  
You know me  

Every player I hate says my group is - what?  
Every player I hate says my group is - huh?  
Every player I hate says my group is - who?  
Every player I hate says my group is - whatever!
