It's a beautiful world but everyone's insane 
Either you swim or either you fade 
It's a revolution time we're sleeping at the wheel 
Apocalypse child in a nuclear field 
We want to change the world but not what holds us back 
I want to be for you what I've never had 
And all of this time I was just trying to reach you 
Through the rain traffic 
As you oat into space 
Your white eyes hide your face 
As you float in between - I am with you 
If you leave 
Fragile to the waves - vicissitudes of days 
When I am with you I feel a little brave

The madness and the wars the circles that we run 
Confusion we import look what we have become 
And all of this time I was just trying to reach you 
Through the rain traffic 
As you float into space 
Your white eyes hide your face 
As you float in between - I die with you 
If you leave - I die with you I die with you
