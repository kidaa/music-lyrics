well the satellite comes and goes
we give each other all we know
in silence we still talk
by the light of the stereo waltz
and will you rain down
in your cinematic love truck
I want to hold you like nothing's going to stop us
she come to take me away
its all that I needed
I don't breathe another lover
flicker on a T.V. screen
everything's more than it seems
the mighty backward fall
stare at the lights on the wall
I swear to this 
she felt like velvet
second blond child she meant it
she come to take me away
its all that I needed
I don't breathe another lover
I'm an alien
you're an alien
it's a beautiful rain
beautiful rain
beautiful rain
