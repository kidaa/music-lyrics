Whatever she wants from me
Whatever device 
Whether in kindness
Whether in spite 
What can I say
What can I do I can't help myself
I let the monster through

Wherever she sends me
Wherever the plane
Perfect black dress
Perfect grave 
What can I say
What can I do
I did it to myself
I did it all confused 

Jesus online
Wires around the world
Feel invincible 
Computer car and girl 
Jesus online 
Wires around the world 
Feel invincible 
To be perfect just like you 
To be perfect just like you
