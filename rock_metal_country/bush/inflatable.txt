let it slide 
overhead 
when i believe in you 
my soul can rest 

but our love 
it's really love 
it never fades 
but fade it does 

when we shine 
like the sun 
you seem the only one 
my only friend 

[chorus] 
so pretty in white 
pretty when you're faithful 
so pretty in white 
pretty when you're faithful 
when you're faithful 

i resigned 
from myself 
took a break 
was someone else 

it's like i've come undone 
and i've only just become 
inflatable for you 

[chorus] 

i don't mind 
most of the time 
but you push me so 
far inside 

[chorus]
