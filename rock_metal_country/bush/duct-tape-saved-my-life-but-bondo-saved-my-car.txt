Driving north on 16 west, next to the girl I think smells the best
We hear a rattle, and then we hear a hum,
sound of metal on concrete sounds like a tin drum
Chorus:
Duct tape saved my life but bondo saved my car
9 and a half weeks ago last Saturday night,
like two hyenas in the night
I had a girl in the dark and gloomy place,
she had that look strewn across her pink face,
I fumbled about for an appropriate cover,
found a wrapper but not another,
But I knew I had a godsend in my trunk so I wrapped him up from back to
front

Well I still drive a Civic through the streets of this city,
held together but not lookin too pretty
Just last tuesday I think it was the 5th,
hit a Volvo and boy he was pissed
Bridge:
Bumper of bondo passed through side impact beam,
broke up seats, headlights and everything in between
