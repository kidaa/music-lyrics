Lonely is the one, who never takes a change
Living in an illusion, never joining any dance
Used to be the one, played it like a game
Love is like a stranger, just a face without a name
So don't let go, it's a long, long way down

Cos I'm falling, falling from this tower, where I keep my heart a prisoner, I don't wanna feel no pain
Falling, each and every hour of my life passing by
I keep falling

Foolish are the ones, who never dare to dream, thinking that they're living but they don't know what it means
It came to me so strong, a vision in the night
It taught me how to love when all I knew was how to fight
So don't leave me now, it's a long long way down

Cos I'm falling, falling from this tower, where I keep my heart a prisoner, I don't wanna feel no pain
Falling, each and every hour of my life passing by
I keep falling

Cos I'm falling, falling from this tower, where I keep my heart a prisoner, I don't wanna feel no pain
Falling, each and every hour of my life passing by

Cos I'm falling, falling from this tower, where I keep my heart a prisoner, I don't wanna feel no pain
Falling, each and every hour of my life passing by
I keep falling
