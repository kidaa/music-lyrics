what makes it go round the way we're up and down 
we're minutiae staring at the whole sky 
battle sense to keep you apprehensive 
i guess no one is the same 
we're all through different lenses 
the bladder will filter all the pain 
and the gut has sides you can't restrain

you are everything to me 
you are cobalt elemental 

a new lagoon five years down the line 
and all i want is a lot of your time 
these days when the clouds come in 
heat broke no smoke without a fire 
heat broke no smoke 

[chorus] 
infractions of the landscape 
in a world we learn to escape
bad weather comes 
but we have wood to burn 
that which only gives 
will always bring you through 
my engine is with you 

kilburn and california 
make you wonder what it's all for 
feed the lesson to the plate 
twenty-one centuries 
and I'm just starting to move 
wreckless times like poison to the mood 
daylight comes all too soon 
accusations bruises to the head 
planet waves to test your lead 

you are everything to me 
you are cobalt elemental 

[chorus] 

tie me in with electric line 
bathe me in bacchanalian wine 
if i with you to gold worlds of true moans 
and eyes that see the same pool 
if not the same water 
if not the same water 
if not the same water 

you are everything to me 
you are cobalt elemental 

[chorus]
