we got the soul 
we got the honey 
stayed alive 
we keep on running 

house is on fire 
with petrol stain 
we stay on the move 
ahead of the flames 

we are the new 
accelerators 
faster we go 
before they make us 

maybe we did 
maybe maybe we don't 
we see your face 
as you throw the stone 

i am a fugitive on the run 
i carry the weight of what i've done 

those born a sweat 
through eyes of love 
bring more light 
than five thousand hertz 

it's not where you're from 
or where you go 
or what you believe 
it's more than you know 
open your head 
open your head 
hold me close as you jump off the edge 

[chorus] 
i am a fugitive on the run 
i carry the weight of what i've done 
so don't carry the weight 
don't carry the weight 
i don't carry the weight 

you can't change the world, 
but you can change what's to come 

[chorus]
