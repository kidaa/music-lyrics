Well - we live in a trailer 
At the edge of town 
You never see us 
Cause we don't come around 
We got twenty five rifles 
To keep the population down 
But we need you now 
That's why I'm hangin round 
So you be good to me and I'll be good to you 
And in this land of conditions 
I am not above suspicion 
I won't attack you but 
I won't back you, yeah 
Well - it's so good to be here 
Asleep on your lawn 
Remember your guard dog 
I'm afraid that's gone 
It was such a drag to hear him 
Whining all night long 
Yeah - that was me with the doves 
Setting them free near the factory 
Where you built your computer - love 
I hope you get the connection 
Cause I can't take the rejection 
I don't believe you 
I don't believe you 
I'm a barrel of laughs 
With my carbine on 
I keep em hoppin 
Till the ammunition's gone 
But I'm still not happy 
Feel like something's wrong 
I got the revolution blues 
I see bloody fountains 
And a ten million dune buggies 
Comin' down the mountains 
I hear that laurel canyon 
Is full of famous stars 
But I hate them worse than lepers 
And I'll kill them in their cars 
Well you sucker 
Well you sucker 
Did you fuck her 
You're the sucker 
You're the sucker 
Ask your mother 
Ask your mother 
Yeah yeah 
You're the sucker
