Infested and polluted
50 tons of mercury dumped in the bay
It's bleeding there's no proof 
That's no way to treat a good friend
Your whiskey talks louder 
Than most things I've read you said 
In artu, in place now 
Site back unwind and relax 

Big cheese is all greed
It's all relative what you need 
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Happy birthday here's your nerve gas

All the fishermen and their families
All sickly crumbling cerebellum 
It's all over for urang-a-tang
Looks like they're back on the street again

Mistrusted, disrupted
Rape land and kill good habit
World weary, world broken
Well spent and money, money, money, money Injected, transmitted
So tons of mercury dumped in the bay
It's breathing-It's put the dog back in the basket 

All the fisherman and their families
All sickly growing sentimental
It's all over for urang-a-tang
Looks like their back on the street again
All the fishermen and their families
It's all over for urang-a-tangs 
Looks like they're back on the street again 
It's all over for urang-a-tangs 
Looks like, looks like, looks like

Invaded, downgraded 
Your bile lands right on my head
Uncalled for, unwanted 
My sinking zero tolerance 

All the fisherman and their families 
All sickly crumbling cerebellum
It's all over for urang-a-tangs 
Looks like they're back on the street again 
All the fishermen and their families
It's all over for urang-a-tangs 
Looks like they're back on the street again
It's all over for the urang-a-tang
Looks like it's a street again
