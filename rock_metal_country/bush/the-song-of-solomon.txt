The Song of Solomon 
The song of everyone 
Who walks the path 
Of the solitary heart 
The soul cries out 
Hear a woman singing
Don't want your bullshit, yeah 
Just want your sexuality 
Don't want excuses, yeah 
Write me your poetry in motion 
Write it just for me, yeah 
And sing it with a kiss
Mmm, just take any line 
";Comfort me with apples 
For I am sick of love 
His left hand is under my head 
And his right hand 
Doth embrace me"; 
This is the Song of Solomon 
Here's a woman singing
Don't want your bullshit, yeah 
Just want your sexuality 
Don't want your excuses, yeah 
Write me your poetry in motion 
Write it just for me, yeah 
And sign it with a kiss
And I'll do it for you 
I'll be the Rose of Sharon for you 
I'll do it for you 
I'll be the Lily of the Valley for you 
I'll do it for you 
I'll be Isolde or Marion for you 
I'll do it for you 
Ooh I'll come in a hurricane for you 
I'll do it for you 
A wop bam boom
Don't want your bullshit, yeah 
Just want your sexuality
