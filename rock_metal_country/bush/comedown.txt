love and hate get it wrong
she cut me right back down to size
sleep the day let it fade
who was there to take your place
no one knows never will
mostly me but mostly you
what do you say do you do
when it all comes down
I don't want to come back down from this cloud
taken me all this time to find out what I need
and I'm doing fine now
there's no blame only shame
when you beg you just complain
more I come more I try
all police are paranoid
so am I so's the future
so are you be a creature
what do you say do you do when it all comes down
