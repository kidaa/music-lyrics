Maybe I'm a dreamer
maybe just a fool
Lately I can hardly see the sun
If you had a secret I could take a guess
Nothin in your eyes seems to hold me
Truth or consequences
which one will it be

Someone said that time would ease the pain
Of two lives love has torn apart
But, I believe whoever wrote that song,
never had a broken heart

One of us is hiding
One of us can tell
Cause no one likes to be the first to know
Someone has to answer
Cause someone has to ask
Keeping on like this is torture
and going undecided is twice as bad for sure

Someone said that time would ease the pain
Of two lives love has torn apart
But, I believe whoever wrote that song
never had a broken heart
