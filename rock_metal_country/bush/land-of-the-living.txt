i found myself 
in another world 
i found myself 
alive and well 

i am the vapor 
i am the gas 
you be the angel 
of everything 

this is the land of the living 
this is the land of reprisal 
this is the land of the living 
the living 
the living 

i lost myself 
too wide a plane 
i opened up 
i'm not the same 

i am electric 
made of wire 
you be the match 
i'll be the fire 

this is the land of the living 
this is the land of reprisal 
this is the land of the living 
the living 
the living 
the living 

in myself i try for you 
walk a thousand miles to get us through 
airways 
jet planes 
safe landings 
no branding 

land 
land 

this is the land of the living 
the land of reprisal 
this is the land of the living 
the land of survival 
survival 

land 
land 

this is the land of the living 
the living 
the living 
the living
