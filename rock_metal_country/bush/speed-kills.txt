Speed ills coming down the mountain 
Speed kills coming down the street 
Speed kills your presence of mind 
Speed kills if you know what I mean 
I got to feel woke up inside again 
I got to feel this broke or fix 
I got to feel, I got outside myself 
I got to feel when I touch your lips 

The things we do to the people that we love 
The way we brake is it something we can't take 
Destroy the world that we took so long to make 

We expect to come for some time 
I wish us safe from home 

To find yourself, in a foreign land 
Another refugee, outside a refugee 

How's it feel she's coming up roses 
How's it feel she's coming up sweet 
How's it feel it's all in spite of you 
How's it feel when she's out of your reach 

What happened to you 
What happened to you 

The things we do to the people that we love 
repeat
