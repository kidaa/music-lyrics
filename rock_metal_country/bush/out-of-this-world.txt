when we die 
we go into the arms of those who remember us 

we are home now 
out of our heads 
out of our minds 
out of this world 
out of this time 

are you drowning or waving 
i just want you to save me 
should we try to get along 
just try to get along 

so we move 
we change by the speed of the choices that we made 
and the barrier of ourself made  
that's so retrograde 

are you drowning or waving 
i just need you to save me 
should we try to get along 
just try to get along 

i am alive 
i'm gonna wait 'til the trials of confusion create 
there are times when i feel the way we're about to break 
when there's too much to say 

we are home now 
out of our heads 
out of our minds 
out of this world 
out of this time 
out of this time
