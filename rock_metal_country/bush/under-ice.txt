It's wonderful. 
Everywhere, so white. 
The river has frozen over. 
Not a soul on the ice. 
Only me skating fast. 
I'm speeding past trees, 
Leaving little lines in the ice, 
Splitting, splitting sound, 
Silver heels spitting, spitting snow. 
";Sonar says...[inaudible]...deep...[inaudible]"; 
There's something moving 
Under, under the ice, 
Moving under ice, 
Through water, 
Trying to get out of the cold water. 
";It's me."; 
Something, someone--help them. 
";It's me.";
