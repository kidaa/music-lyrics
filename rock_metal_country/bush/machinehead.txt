breathe in breathe out
tied to a wheel fingers got to feel 
I spin on a whim I slide to the right
I felt you like electric light
for our love 
for our fear
for our rise against the years and years

got a machinehead better than the rest
green to red machinehead
and I walk from my machine
I walk from my machine

deaf dumb and thirty
starting to deserve this 
leaning on my conscience wall
blood is like wine
unconscious all the time
if I had it all again
I'd change it all
