You came out of the night, 
Wearing a mask in white colour. 
My eyes were shining 
On the wine, and your aura. 
All in order, we move into the boudoir, 
But too soon the morning has resumed. 
I'm hanging on the Old Goose Moon. 
You look like an angel, 
Sleeping it off at a station. 
Were you only passing through? 
I'm dying for you just to touch me, 
And feel all the energy rushing right up-a-me. 
L'amour looks something like you. 
The thought of you sends me shivery. 
I'm dressed in lace, sailing down a black reverie. 
My heart is thrown 
To the pebbles and the boatmen. 
All the time I find I'm living in that evening, 
With that feeling of sticky love inside. 
I'm hanging on the Old Goose Moon. 
You look like an angel, 
Sleeping it off at a station. 
Were you only passing through? 
I'm dying for you just to touch me, 
And feel all the energy rushing right up-a-me. 
L'amour looks something like you.
