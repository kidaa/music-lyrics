I'm a man
I'm real proud of my manhood
I like to smoke 
ten thousand cigarettes 
eight ball
I could climb any fountain
I never cry
I only bawl when I'm losing
and I've never been wrong
never been wrong
I'm looking so good
looking so good

got a big gold gun
got a big gold bullet
and I guess you could say
I'm real full of it
I'm real full of it

I'm real straight
you wanna see my peccadillos
hot dog 7:30 every morning
big into war 
big into war

I am a whore
I am a whore

got a big gold gun

I shave with Gillette
shave with Gillette
and I'm patting my back
patting my back
got a big gold bullet
