always be there face i live with
always be there face i live with
abscess memory with broken fingers
all the fallen down angels
raw pain distress it's all in the way we
know
that we could have it all some satellites 
of pain can't always be ignored
war on all sides war on all sides
drink life as it comes straight no chaser
straight no chaser
drink life as it comes straight no chaser
climb inside you away from strangers
building a system of alleys and
motorways
it's all in the way that we know
we could have it all some satellites
of pain can't always be ignored
it's all in the face of what we thought
we knew before war on all sides
war on all sides keep on driving
hair left morning wet
there's nothing like losing you
there's nothing like losing you 
there's nothing like losing you
there's nothing like losing you
