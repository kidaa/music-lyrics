crucified 
for eternal sins 
re-invent myself 
shape my alter skin 

try to break the mold 
severed hold 
first you find your threshold bevels
breathing out your toxic levels 

lung so rope is hangin
now we know what's comin

oh superman 
where have you gone 
with a little more time 
and a six leaf clover 
just a little more head 
to make you bolder 
just a little more sound

been playing tricks you know 
she got sucked so dry 

we destroy ourselves 
to rise again 
open up yourself 
like a jesus son 

only way out is through 
way past you 
first you get to human levels 
run right through your bullshit pedals

lung so rope is hanging 
now we know what's coming 

oh superman 
where have you gone 
with a little more time 
and a six leaf clover 
just a little more head 
to make you bolder 
just a little more sound 
just a little more sound 

been playing tricks you know 
he got sucked so dry and you oughta know how to lose 

lung so rope is hanging 

oh superman 
what have you done 

with a little more time 
and a six leaf clover 
just a little more head 
to make you bolder 
just a little more sound 
just a little more sound
