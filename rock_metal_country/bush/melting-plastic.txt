These four walls are destined to stay
They say I'm guilty and the guilty must pay
But all I'm askin' is to have a my say
Do you think I'll ever get out

Will I ever get out of here
Will I ever push down my fear
Will I ever see through my tears
Will I ever get out of here tonight
The sands of time them fallin' right through my hand
Can't make no sense and I can't make no plans

All I'm askin' is to lend me your hand
Come on and help me get out

Will I ever get out of here
Will I ever push down my fear
Will I ever see through my tears
Will I ever get out of here tonight

Will I ever get out of here
Will I ever push down my fear
Will I ever see through my tears
Will I ever get out of here tonight
So at last I'm feeling the pain
Can't take the weight and I can't take the strain
Can't see no future and I can't see no gain
Looks like we never get out

Will I ever get out of here
Will I ever push down my fear
Will I ever see through my tears
Will I ever get out of here tonight
Well I guess I'll never know
I guess I'll never know, I guess I'll never know
Am I free, am I free to go
Well I guess I'll never know
I guess I'll never know, I guess I'll never know
Am I free, am I free to go
Am I free, am I free to go
I don't know
