I memorize the basics
Making strange faces 
There's a thousand miles to go
Without blinking 

Gravitate spacewards
Find a home for the head
From my basement 
No darkness ever left

This is the night
This is the sound
Here comes the warm machine
Such a warm machine

Some days are playful
Making play faces 
But we will not let it through
The darkness and the sense
Or being born to lose 

This is the night
This is the sound 
Her comes the warm machine
Such a warm machine 
This is the life
This is the sound 
Here comes a warm machine
Such a warm machine

If I never know we can only feel
I'll take the help 
I'll take a slice 
Warm alright now 
Cos I feel alright

I memorize the basics, basics, basics

This is the night
This is the sound
Here comes the warm machine
Such a warm machine Such a warm machine Such a warm
machine, machine, machine:
