Well we've all been through it, thinking times are tough
And I'll see you through it, when you've had enough
And I'll be beside you, many feelings the same
Give back the ruin, give back the rain

Well we've both felt lovely, things are going our way
May you rise above me, may you have your day
And I'll be proud of you, when I call out your name
Give back the ruin, give back the rain

And you know it's the only bridge I know that's still above water
I'm praying my insurance is gonna pay
And you know it's the only road I know that's still above water
I'm praying my family is gonna stay

Well we've both been better, or worse I suppose
And I got your letter, and I washed your clothes
And I'll be right with you, every step of the way
Give back the ruin, give back the rain
And I'll be proud of you, when I call out your name
Give back the ruin, give back the rain
