could not believe
came here today
helmet was on
you blew me away
house is on fire 
we're naked again
maybe all we need 
is water and friends

shackles and chains
won't keep me away
temple is you
and my brow is insane

I wanna be just like you
I wanna feel right through you 
I wanna see just with you
I wanna live
I wanna die you

thinning ice
14 hairdryers
swimming to you 
flame on earth desire
poor on the rise
rich on the fall
this cripple's with you 
fame is a whore

I wanna fit inside you 
I wanna room inside you 
if money talks I wanna buy you 
I wanna die
I wanna die
I wanna live you

I'm not scared of you
gave up on drugs
if I make it through
the jaws of love
jaws of love

you give
