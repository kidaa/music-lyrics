wanted to buy you shiny red things
thought I'd be with you until the end
how did I know that I would be there
blow me away
see if I care

death of a future
goodbye to my friends
wish I could see you all again
family hollow
family real
wish you were here see how I feel

kill a man
kill a girl
kill a man
kill a girl

jekyll in you
brins out the wired in me
I have no defense
I'm all that you see
the night is a bomb blast
the night is on fire
sing with me in the gasoline choir

and you say you want to change our minds
I've paid for your belief with mine
of all the bravest stands in ti;me

you stoop so low you'll never rise
