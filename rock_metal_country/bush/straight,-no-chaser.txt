Always be there 
Face I live with 
Always be there 
Face I live with 
Abcess memory with broken fingers 
All the fallen down angels 
Raw pain distress 
It's all in the way we know that we could have it all 
Some satellites of pain can't always be ignored 
War on all sides 
War on all sides 
Drink life as it comes 
Straight no chaser 
Drink life as it comes 
Straight no chaser 
Climb inside you 
Away from strangers 
Building a system of alleys and motorways 
It's all in the way that we know we could have it all 
Some satellites of pain can't always be ignored 
It's all in the face of what we thought we knew before 
War on all sides 
War on all sides 
War on all sides 
Keep on driving 
Hair left morning wet 
There's nothing like losing you 
There's nothing like losing you 
There's nothing like losing you
