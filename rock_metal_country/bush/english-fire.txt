World news, world news
Well you said let's be free
Well you said I'll be me 
Death row hearts are hard to mend 
Why shoot myself for your sins 

All my love, all my love
All my love, all my love 

Well you said retribute 
Well you said substitute 
Burn myself on your bed 
Your crown of thorns my crown of lead
I'll wake up before I drown 
I'll wake up before I drown 

All my love, all my love let's me free 
All my love, all my love let's me free
All my love, all my love
All my love, all my love 

We'll hang ourselves by the English fire 
We'll hang ourselves

All my love, all my love 
All my love, all my love let's me free 
All my love, all my love let's me free
All my love, all my love 

I'll wake up before I drown 
All my love let's me free 
All my love 
All my love let's me free
