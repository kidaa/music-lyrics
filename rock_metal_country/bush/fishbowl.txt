Say you got to write what you know
         but living out here in the middle of nowhere
         there's not much to know but the four walls of your room
         and the contents within
         Try and fill the void with alcohol
         but you wont find much solace in the bottom of a bottle
         but you might find a good time trying
         Pre-Chorus: And if you've lived in the burbs'
         you would know where I've been
         Boredom's an enemy against whom you cant win
         Chorus: So you write it down on the side of a guitar case
         and stay for free at your parents place
         Just sit on the stairs and smell the rain coming in
         Finished with school, now life gets cool
         that's what your brother told you
         from underneath a rusted out old Dodge
         Out for a spin on a Tuesday night
         Looking for fun or looking for a fight
         It doesn't really matter who wins
         Chorus
         Sitting in a room with people who lost their youth
         Smoke hangs heavy from a back alley booth
         Take her home and its all the same
         14 years, just my haircut changed
         Repeat Chorus
