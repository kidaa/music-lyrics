the mind is all we kiss everything
we say we love it's the skin we're in
you're a retrograde a vacancy
you're the one that I love
the hate in me
lazy day on a darker breed
to have is not what it's made to be
you come alone on a mass attack
sucking your tantric suck
fooling your one-eyed cat

we don't mind

we deviate our gravy brains
set em on fire they're all the same
I am lionface
no sanchko panza
I'm riddled by you 
I could've been better

I'm a monkey on a drip
sucker monkey on a drip

you take such pretty photos
when will you be worthy of your good side
where will you be 
when the clouds break
and it all takes
just a little more than you have
we don't mind
