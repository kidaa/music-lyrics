I can read between the lonely lines
Every single word brings a tear to my eye
Tell me how did we get here
And where did heaven go

I remember us as strong as stone
Now I see the cracks breaking up a home
And a future filled with fear
But I won #8217;t surrender no
We can make it through the fire
I won #8217;t lay it down and die
I will be the air, if you are out of breath
And out of time

-chorus-
Baby don #8217;t it feel right
Don #8217;t you know why
Won #8217;t you say what it is
Why you just can #8217;t see what #8217;s going on
I #8217;ll be the Breath of  Your Life

See the way the wind blows
No matter how it goes
I #8217;m the air that you need
If you #8217;re out of breath and out of time
I #8217;ll be the Breath of Your Life
Baby, no no we ain #8217;t out of time

I don #8217;t want to go around again
Passionate lover turning into friend
I don #8217;t want to be back there
Let that heaven go
Explain the things you really need
I can make it happen if you talk to me

Though I cannot read your mind
I can get into your soul
We Could Make it Through the Fire
I won #8217;t lie down and die
I will be the air if you are out of breath and out of time

-Repeat chorus-

See the way the wind blows
No matter how it goes
I #8217;m the air that you need
If you #8217;re out of breath and out of time
I #8217;ll be the Breath of Your Life
Baby, no no we ain #8217;t out of time

Are you feeling like you #8217;re drowning
Are you choking?
And you just don #8217;t know what to do
Well I can help you make it through
Am I the one to save it?

I really think that we could do this
get through this
Don #8217;t doubt it, think about it
Be sure you can depend on me
Let me be the air that you breathe

- Repeat chorus-
