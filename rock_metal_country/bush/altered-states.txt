Living in a cage
Washing in a birdbath
Sinking in a fish bowl 
On a broken farm
I try to never lie
I really do
I wonder if my friends 
Will get me through 
Conscious of the was as best we can
17 ways to kill a man 
States we've been through

Killing nostalgia 
For future swims 
Trash all your bridges
Kill the rock all roll thing 
I want to move on 
With no complains
Building our walls with yesterday
Might as well shine before you slide
Might as well you live before you die 
States we've been through 
Talk about states
A whole lot of emptiness

Living in a state of constant chasing 
A river of flux for our tasting
I try to never lie
I really do
I wonder if my friends will get me through 
It always seems to rain 
When you leave
I try to stem the flow
As we bleed 

States we've been through
Talk about states, states 
Talk about states, states
