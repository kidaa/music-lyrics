DO YOU WANNA DANCE - Johnny Rivers
B. Freeman   1973

Do you wanna dance and hold my hand?
Tell me that I'm your man
Baby, do you wanna dance?

Do you wanna dance under the moonlight?
Squeeze and kiss me all through the night?
Baby, do you wanna dance?

Now, do you wanna dance, girl, and hold my hand?
Tell me that I'm your man.
Baby, do you wanna dance?

Do you wanna dance under the moonlight,
Love me, girl, all through the night?
Baby, do you wanna dance?

Well, now, do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do  you wanna dance?
Do you, do you wanna dance?

Now, do you wanna dance and hold my hand?
Tell me that I'm your man.

Yes, do you wanna dance, I mean under the moonlight,
Squeeze and kiss me all through the night?
Baby, ah do you wanna dance?

Well, now, do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
