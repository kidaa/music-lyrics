Kashka from Baghdad 
Lives in sin, they say, 
With another man, 
But no one knows who. 
Old friends never call there. 
Some wonder if life's 
Inside at all-- 
If there's life inside at all. 
But we know the lady who rents the room. 
She catches them calling a la lune. 
At night 
They're seen 
Laughing, 
Loving. 
They know 
The way 
To be 
Happy. 
They never go for walks. 
Maybe it's because 
The moon's not bright enough. 
There's light in love, you see. 
I watch their shadows, 
Tall and slim, 
In the window opposite. 
I long to be with them. 
'Cause when all the alley-cats come out, 
You can hear music from Kashka's house. 
At night 
They're seen 
Laughing, 
Loving. 
They know 
The way 
To be 
Happy. 
";Watching every night.* 
Don't you know they're seen? 
Won't you let me laugh? 
Let me in your love. 
";Watching every night. 
Don't you know they're seen? 
Won't you let me laugh? 
Let me in your love. 
";Watching every night. 
Don't you know they're seen? 
Won't you let me laugh? 
Let me in your love. 
";Watching every night. 
Don't you know they're seen? 
Won't you let me laugh?";
