Your dead meat from former days
I am your crisis 
Blue asbestos in your veins
I'm your broken fingers 
I've killed you twice 
I will again 
Revenge is eager 
See first you'll crash 
Then you'll burn 

Dorothy died for your pleasure
It's hard to get along in this car crash weather 
Your dead meat 
Your dead meat 
Your dead meat 

Your dead meat formaldehyde
Didn't phase me 
I soon returned to track you down 
For your confession
I'll be your poison and your pain
I'll be your struggle to be sane
Exploited lament
And the places you never went

Dorothy died for your pleasure
It's hard to get along in this car crash weather
Car crash weather
Dorothy died for your pleasure
It's hard to get along
Car crash weather 
Car crash weather, weather

I'm doing you in tomorrow 
That's why I'm dressed 
In all this sorrow
I'm doing you in tomorrow
I'll burn before I mellow 

Dorothy died for your pleasure 
It's hard to get along, it's hard to get along
Your dead meat from former days 
Your dead meat from former days 
Your dead meat from former days
Your dead meat from former days
