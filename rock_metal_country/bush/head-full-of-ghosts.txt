i stand around at american weddings 
i stand around for family 
at my best when i'm terrorist inside 
at my best when it's all me 

i was there when they took all the people 
i was alone in a mental revine 
you breathe life when you break the walls down 
you breathe life when you set me free 

where is my head 
where are my bones 
why are my days so far from home
where is my head 
where are my bones 
can you save me from myself

free thinking renegade social 
missed the moon, the man and now 
in a slip stream of my poseferities
i got the boat so we don't drown 

these are the days that are split down the middle 
no words to calm me down 
be sure that what you dream of 
won't come to hunt you out 

[chorus] 
where is my head 
where are my bones 
why are my days so far from home 
ghost man 
where is my head 
where are my bones 
how come we get so lost 
ghost man 
where is my head 
where are my bones 
can you save me from myself 
can you save me from myself 

i stand around at american weddings 
i stand around for family 
at my best when i'm terrorist inside 
at my best when it's all me 

ghost man 
how come we get so lost 
ghost man 

[chorus]
