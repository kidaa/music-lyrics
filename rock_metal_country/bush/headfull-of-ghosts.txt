I stand around at American weddings I stand around for family 
At my best when I'm terrorist inside at my best when it's all me 
I was there when they took all the people 
I was alone in a mental ravine 
You breathe life when you break the walls down 
You breathe life when you set me free 
Where is my head where are my bones 
Why are my days so far from home

Ghostman - where is my head - where are my bones 
Can you save me from myself 
Free-thinking renegade social Mr. Moon Man now 
Out the slipstream of my possibilities got the boat so we don't drown 
These are the days that I'm split down the middle 
No words to calm me down 
Be sure that what you dream of won't come to hunt you out 
Where is my head where are my bones 
Why are my days so far from home 
Ghostman How come we get so lost 
Ghostman 
Save me from myself
