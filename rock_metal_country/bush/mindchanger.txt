Help me sometimes, I need that much
Don't you think it's strange 
How we can turn to dust 

Think it's strange, like really strained 
We'll never run when we've got all these broken bones 

It's so hard to let you go 
It's so hard to let you go
I will make you change your mind
I will make you change your mind

I think of me sometimes, I'd never tell 
Do you recognize me, think that you know me well 
I think you're changing, configurating
Destroyed the lines that fed the goods to your heart 

It's so hard to let you go
It's so hard to let you go 
Run with the hunted as you come
Run with the hunted 
I will make you change your mind
I will make you change your mind
It's so hard to let you go 
It's so hard to let you go run with the hunted 
As you come 
I will make you change your mind
I will make you change your mind
