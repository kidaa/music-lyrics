Fire chief, car thief, misled skinhead,
Tell me where it's at
Is it cool to bring it up again
Will I blow my act

Misplaced tinselface, weekend pretend,
Am I on your track
I would love to live close to you,
Could I bring my cat

Cowgirl, sailor,
Do you know who you are
Cowgirl, sailor,
Do you know who you are
Do you know who you are

Overfed premed, outfront gaspump,
Will I fix my car
Pinch yourself when I smile at you,
Baby, I'm a star!

Turned on, tuned in, cop out, sell out,
Do you know who you are
I took the time to try to fit you in,
Was I off too far

Cowgirl, sailor,
Do you know who you are
Cowgirl, sailor,
Do you know who you are
Do you know who you are
