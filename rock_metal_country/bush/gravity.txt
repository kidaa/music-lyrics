You riddle, you say
You throw yourself
On to me
It's kind of hard to lay it down
Just one two three
And I know
Just why you take it slow
You've got those things
Living down, down below Of the heart
You make it harder
Every time it comes around
We tell each other
It's not fair the way you take me there
And then you go and waive it off
Pretend you just don't care
But if you love me
With all of your heart
There's no need to worry
Why do you have to make it so hard?
And if you can't stay
Baby it's allright I
I'll be your blowtorch
Burning your way throughout
The night
You riddle, you say
You throw yourself
On to me
It's kind of hard to lay it down
Just one two three
And I know
Just why you take it slow
You've got those things
Living down, down below
With every tremor
Of the heart
You make it harder
Every time it comes around
We tell each other
It's not fair the way you take me there
And then you go and waive it off
Pretend you just don't care
But if you love me
With all of your heart
There's no need to worry
Why do you have to make it so hard?
And if you can't stay
Baby it's allright I
I'll be your blowtorch
Burning your way throughout
The night
Bridge
But if you love me
With all of your heart, yeah
There's no need to worry
Why do you have to make it so hard?
And if you can't stay
Baby it's allright I
I'll be your blowtorch
Guiding your way throughout
The night
But if you love me
With all of your heart
I'll make you proud of me
I'll guide your way throughout the
dark
And if you can't stay
Baby it's allright I
I'll be your blowtorch
Guiding your way throughout
The night
