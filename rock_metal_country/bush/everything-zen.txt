There must be something we can eat 
Maybe find another love 
Should I fly to Los Angeles 
Find my asshole brother 
Minnie Mouse has grown up a cow 
Dave's on sale again 
We kissy kiss in the rear view 
We're so bored You're to blame 

Try to see it once my way 
Everything zen 
Everything zen 
I don't think so 

Raindogs howl for the century 
A million dollars a stake 
As you search for your demi-god 
And you fake with a sain 
There's no sex in your violence 
There's no sex in your violence 

Try to see it once my way 
Everything zen 
Everything zen 
I don't think so 
I don't believe that Elvis is dead 
I don't believe that Elvis is dead 
I don't believe that Elvis is, Elvis is 

There's no sex in your violence
