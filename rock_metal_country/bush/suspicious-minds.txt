Were caught in a trap 
I cant walk out 
Because I love you, baby yeah 
Why cant you see 
What you've done to me 
Well I cant belive what your saying 
We cant go on together 
With suspicious minds 
And we can build a dream together 
with suspicous minds 
Were caught in a trap 
I cant walk out 
Because I love you, baby yeah
