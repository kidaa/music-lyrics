skies ripped open by the sun 
daylight comes but not soon enough 
speed down your track in search of you 
strapped to the back of what we do 

over to you to make it work 

ages have changed 
i'd rather starve than fake alive 
lost to the cities of the night 
lost in the world to make it right 

[chorus] 
heart 
break 
hreat-break and novocain 
whoa help the pain 
i'm out of control 
i'm a hurricane 
hitting it hard, i'm broken down 
i'm out of control, i'm in a hurricane 

win some ground but lose you 
it's never explained how to make it through 
no rope, no cash no serpentine 
our love, building on a bonfire 

[chorus] 

good to see you follow 
good to see you come again 

[chorus] 

all these miles of water
