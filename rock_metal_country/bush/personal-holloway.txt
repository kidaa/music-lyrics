Tune my weaker eye. 
Spit white. 
Hold the world up all day. 
She's blue in the face again. 
p a r a c e t a m o l 
Burn the darkness all away. 
And drinking kitchen paint to dye the winter- 
I hope we'll never see again. 
Deaf and dumb with the lights on. 
Deaf and dumb with the lights on. 
Married by signs. 
Personal holloway. 
Six months linen. 
It's safe to say we are alone. 
Suburban suicide. 
Watching night come amber. 
It's all so temporary. 
Move a little way forward 
Move a little way now 
Move a little wayforward. 
Move a little way now 
Bleed life. 
Breathe life. 
Could be a better plan. 
Could be a better plan. 
Could be a better plan.
