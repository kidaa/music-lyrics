There is nowhere left to hide
There is nothing to be done
No people to be saved 
No pets we've never names 
40 miles from the sun 

As darkness craves the mind 
We come undone without our pride
No time on the earth to come
All the pleasures just begun 
40 miles from the sun

In our coats beneath the layers
Wash my skin of all the hate 
We should sleep late
Everything just kind of grates
40 miles from the sun 
40 miles from the sun 
40 miles from the sun

I need to lose to make it right
I'll confront the stars tonight
I will babble I will bite 
You will never know how much you shine
40 miles from the sun 
40 miles from the sun
40 miles from the sun
