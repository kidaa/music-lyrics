Watching, waiting, falling, breathing 
Gaping, wasted, sickly, feelin' 
Winds keep come my way 
I have less to say 
I'm waiting here 3 times 
Solomon breaks my head 
Kicks me so far down my street 
I am struggling with this time 
I am struggling on my feet 
We go down 2 times 
There is no down 
Down 
There is no down 
We do without 
There is no 3 times 
More down 
No more down 3 times 
Oh 
Solomon waits by the wall 
Spiting from his eyes 
Said his life's become my fault 
Twisted back life 
Might as well get saved by someone 
You're gonna get saved all 
I am grateful for the acknowledgement 
I am guilty of it all 
We go down 2 times 
There is no down 2 times 
We do without 
There is no 3 times 
More down 
Down 
Might as well get save someone 
Might as well get saved by someone 
There is no down 
We do without 
There is no all the way 
All the way
