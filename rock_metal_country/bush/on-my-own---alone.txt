McAlinden
Under the mantle of the stars,
By the slow waves of the sea,
On a bank of sand we fell
Like fruit from a laden tree.
And in the morning, with the clean slate of day,
You're the warm thought I have.
I found my freedom
Loving an angel in Eden.
I found out for myself
Love is the natural law.
We walk through fields frown high,
Sleep together in the sun,
We speal everything unsaid
In the only language we have left.
With your body and your lips on mine,
We take our time.
I found my freedom
Loving an angel in Eden.
I found out for myself
Love is the natural law.
Remember the night when I was so bold?
I had no plan.
It just felt... yeah yeah yeah.
