somewhere sometime
all things will be fine
and it never seems to stop
wonder if i've met my wife
somewhere sometime
all things will be fine
and it never seems enough
splinter left
focus right
this mortal soil around me
mortal feeling i have found
surrounded by your glory
hold me now so that i never drown
and it never seems to stop
wonder if i've met my wife
splinter left
focus right
