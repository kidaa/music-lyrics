1 and 2 and 3 on the double,
         Surrey Girls aint nothin but trouble,
         Last night I slept with the Devil,
         Surrey Girls aint nothin but trouble.
         Took her out on a Monday night
         She threw in a tape, and it was Great White
         I said thats great, yeah I told a lie
         And my inner child broke down and cried
         Chorus
         Out for dinner on that fateful night
         Wanted a beer but all we did was fight about
         politics, womens lib and social strife
         And everything about Larry King's first wife
         Chorus
         So I got the chicken, it was finger lickin'
         She got the ribs and they started stickin'
         To the hairs on her face, all over the place
         The only thing showin was the clearasil paste
         Chorus
         Bridge: So I still drive a Yugo
         and my lifes been a no go since that night with a
         Surrey girl.....
         Chorus to fade...
