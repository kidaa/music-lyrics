watch the water feed the soil 
so the circle is complete 
see what you have become 
is the earth beneath my feet 

i'll bring in the stains 
your alabaster feet 
what's the space between 
what you want and what you need 

so you'll never be lonely again 
never be lonely again 

waiting for this love 
to bring me close to you 
waiting for this love 
bring me close to you 

who are you 
and where are you in my life 
i was wondering how much of me 
is still alive 

i don't even know 
if i can swim again 
you know how cold it gets 
with all your struggling 

try to find ourselves 
seems real 
it gets so hard at times 
you know just what to feel 

[chorus] 
waiting for this love 
to bring me close to you 
waiting for this love 
bring me close to you 
i got reasons 
i got reasons 

watch the water bleed the soil 
albinoed by the sun 
we will try to keep our feet 
in the face of what we've done 

try to find ourselves 
see this, what we made 
tell me what you want 
and what you have betrayed 

home is still the place 
that we love the most 
home is where you are 
home is where you are 

[chorus]
