They're polishing the government 
Resembles a last waltz
We are the playthings 
We are the form 
Soon it may come 
Since we can rise
Too long since I've seen you
We move like satellites 

My future lies 
In space travel 
She's coming over me

They're burning the tenements
Topless progressive thinking 
Political holes 
Got six but pray for seven

My future lies
In space travel 
She's coming over me
I employ spies
To stroll the gravel 
They never want to leave 
The future lies
The future lies 
Scared of the government scared of the government 

The future lies
In space travel 
There's someone after me 
I employ spies
In silver tassels
The never seem that pleased 

The future lies
The future lies space 
The future lies
The future lies space 
The future lies 
The future lies space travel 
The future lies space travel
