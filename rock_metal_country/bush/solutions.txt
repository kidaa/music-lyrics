the devil you know 
is back here again 
the devil is stoned 
he's making friends 

we move 
we break 
the sun with shade 

you come 
we go 
we're fast 
we're slow 

blood on your dress 
hole in your sky 
blanket is gone 
permanent night 

we're glued 
we break 
we all 
dilate 

we please 
we pain 
again 

she checks her head 
she's in the smoke 
figuring which way to turn 
now she's got a rope 

oh 
we need solutions 
a brave megaphone 
we need solutions 
a brave megaphone 

she's broken your shoes 
you look like winter 
you're all in a bruise 
handful of splinters 

we brood 
we flake 
we torch 
we take 

rebound 
rebirth 
cocoon 

i could be wrong 
i could be right 
do you think we'll make it 
out of here alive 

[chorus]
oh 
we need solutions 
a brave megaphone 
we need solutions 
we got a common home 

she makes me see god 
i'm out on a line 
anyway the pleasure comes 

[chorus]
