After the party 
You took me back to your parlour. 
A little nervous laughter 
Locking the door. 
My stockings fall 
Onto the floor. 
Desperate for more. 
Nobody else can share this. 
Here comes one and one makes one, 
The glorious union. 
Well it could be love, 
Or it could be just lust, 
But it will be fun. 
It will be wonderful. 
Oh, feel it. Oh, oh feel it, 
Feel it, my love. 
Oh, feel it. Oh, oh feel it, 
Feel it, my love. 
Oh, I need it. Oh, oh, feel it, 
Feel it, my love. 
Feel it! 
See what you're doing to me? 
God, but you're beautiful, aren't you? 
Feel your warm hand walking around. 
I won't pull away. 
My passion always wins. 
So keep on a-moving in. 
So keep on a-tuning in. 
Synchronise rhythm now. 
Oh, feel it. Oh, oh feel it, 
Feel it, my love. 
Oh, feel it. Oh, oh feel it, 
Feel it, my love. 
Oh, I need it. Oh, oh, feel it, 
Feel it, my love. 
Feel it! 
See what you're doing to me? 
See what you're doing to me? 
Just see what you're doing to me.
