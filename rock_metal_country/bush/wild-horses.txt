Childhood living is easy to do 
The things you wanted I brought them for you 
Graceless lady you know who I am 
You know I can't let you slide through my hands 
Wild horses couldn't drag me a way 
Wild wild horses couldn't drag me a way 
I watched you suffer a dull aching pain 
Now you've decided to show me the same 
Wild horses couldnt drag me away 
Wild wild wild horses couldnt drag me away 

I know I've dreamed you a sin and a lie 
I have my freedom but I don't have much time 
Faith has been broken, tears must be cried 
Let's do some living, and after we'll die 

Wild horses couldn't drag me away 
Wild wild wild horses we will ride them some day.
