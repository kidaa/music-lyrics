Caressing the marble and stone 2 times 
Love is a special form 
Were wasting the feeling I feel 
I wish you were here with me now 2 times 
Boiling all curls and eyes 
Past is the awful and the light 
More like a dark ride feel 
I wish you were here with me now 2 times 
And I wish your arms were here waiting 
God stretches time and it grays 
Someday we will die in your dreams 
I wish you were here with me now 4 times 
And I wish your arms were here waiting 
God stretches time and it grays 
Someday we will die in your dreams 
I wish you were here with me now 2 times 
Caressing the marble and stone 2 times 
Love is a special form 
Were wasting the feeling I feel
