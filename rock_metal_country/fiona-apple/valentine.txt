You didn't see my valentine
I sent it via pantomime
While you were watchin' someone else
I stared at you and cut myself

Its all I'll do 'cause I'm not free
A fugitive too dull to flee
I'm amorous but out of reach
A still life drawing of a peach

I'm a tulip in a cup
I stand no chance of growing up
I've made my peace I'm dead I'm done
I watched you live to have my fun

I root for you, I love you. You, you, you, you. [x2]

I made it to a dinner date
My tear drops seasoned every plate
I tried to dance but lost my nerve
I cramped up in the learning curve

I'm a tulip in a cup
I stand no chance of growing up
I'm resigned to sail on through
In the wake of tales of you

I root for you, I love you. You, you, you, you.
I root for you, I love you. You, you, you.
I root for you, I love you. You, you, you, you, you, you, you.
I root for you, I love you. You, you, you.
