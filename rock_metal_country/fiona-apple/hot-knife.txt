If I'm butter, if I'm butter,
If I'm butter, then he's a hot knife,
He makes my heart a cinemascope screen
Showing the dancing bird of paradise.

If I'm butter, if I'm butter,
If I'm butter, then he's a hot knife,
He makes my heart a cinemascope screen
Showing the dancing bird of paradise.

He excites me
Must be like a genesis of rhythm
I get feisty
Whenever I'm with him

If I'm butter, if I'm butter,
If Im butter, then he's a hot knife,
He makes my heart a cinemascope screen
Showing the dancing bird of paradise.

I'm a hot knife, I'm a hot knife,
I'm a hot knife, he's a pat of butter.
If I get a chance, I'm gonna show him that
He's never gonna need another, never need another.
