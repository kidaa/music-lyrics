I lie in an early bed
Thinking late thoughts
Waiting for the black
To replace my blue
I do not struggle
In your web
Because it was my
Aim to get caught
But daddy longlegs
I feel that I'm finally
Growing weary
Of waiting to be
Consumed by you
Give me the first taste
Let it begin
Heaven cannot wait forever
Darling, just start the chase
I'll let you win
But you must
Make the endeavour

Oh, your love gives
Me a heart confusion
Adagio breezes fill
My skin with sudden red
Your hungry flirt
Borders intrusion
I'm building memories on
Things we have not said
Full is not heavy as empty
Not nearly my love
Not nearly my love
Not nearly

Give me the first taste
Let it begin
Heaven cannot wait forever
Darling, just start the chase
I'll let you win
But you must
Make the endeavour
