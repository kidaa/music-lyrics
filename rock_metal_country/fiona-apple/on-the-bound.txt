All my life is on me now, hail the pages turning
And the fuure on the bound, hell dont know my fury
You're all I need, you're all I need, you're all I need
You're all I need, You're all I need, you're all I need
Youre all I need - and maybe some faith would
Do me good
I dont know what I'm doing, dont know should I 
Change my mind, I cant decide, there's too many
Variations to consider
No thing I do dont do no thing but bring me
More to do, It's true, I do imbue my blue unto myself,
I make it bitter
Baby, lay your head on my lap one more time
Tell me you belong to me
Baby that it's all gonna be alright
I believe that it isn't.
