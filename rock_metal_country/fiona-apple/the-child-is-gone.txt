Darling, give me
Your absence tonight
Take the shade from
The canvas and
Leave me the white
Let me sink in the
Silence that echoes inside
And don't bother
Leaving the light on
'Cause I suddenly feel
Like a different person
From the roots of my soul
Come a gentle coercion
And I ran my hand
O'er a strange inversion
A vacancy that just
Did not belong
The child is gone
Honey help me
Out of this mess
I'm a stranger to myself
But don't reach for me
I'm too far away
I don't wanna talk
'Cause there's
Nothing left to say
So my

Darling, give me
Your absence tonight
Take all of your sympathy
And leave it outside
'Cause there's no kind
Of loving that can
Make this all right
I'm trying to find
A place I belong
And I suddenly feel
Like a different person
From the roots of my soul
Come a gentle coersion
And I ran my hand
O'er a strange inversion
As the darkness
Turns into the dawn
The child is gone
The child is gone
