How many times do I have to say 
To get away-get gone 
Flip your shit past another lasses 
Humble dwelling 
You got your game, made your shot, and you got away 
With a lot, but I'm not turned-on 
So put away that meat you're selling 
Cuz I do know what's good for me- 
And I've done what I could for you 
But you're not benefiting, and yet I'm sitting 
Singing again, sing, sing again 
How can I deal with this, if he won't get with this 
M'I gonna heal from this; he won't admit to it 
Nothing to figure out; I gotta get him out 
It's time the truth was out that he don't give a 
Shit about me 
How many times can it escalate 
Till it elevates to a place I can't breathe 
And I must decide, if you must deride 
That I'm much obliged to up and go 
I'll idealize, then realize that it's no 
Sacrifice, because the price is paid, and 
There's nothing left to grieve 
Fuckin go- 
Cuz I've done what I could for you, and I do know what's 
Good for me and I'm not benefiting, instead 
I'm sitting singing again, singing again, singing again, 
Sing, sing, sing again 
How can I deal with this, if he won't get with this 
M'I gonna heal from this; he won't admit to it 
Nothing to figure out; I gotta get him out 
It's time the truth was out that he don't give a 
Shit about me
