I was recently rid of a man again,
So I caught me a cab to see Flanagan.
I told the cabbie 'To the alley in back'
I told myself coming would keep me intact

Flanny shouts from the second floor
as I crossed the lot to the kitchen door
I see Guillermo and give him some lip
and I cross to the bar, Ellen pours me a nip
and I look to the stage it's the rock of rage, as Jon is on.

and how could I listen without wanting to be with them,
and how could I have thought that I was ever alone?

I feel like singing and drinking and stuff
and I don't wanna care if I stumble or cry
Handle me like family and that'll be enough,
to keep me from dying when I want to die.

When over the rainbow's too far
go to Lar-go to Lar-go to Largo

When over the rainbow's too far
go to Lar-go to Lar-go to Largo

I'm hopping scotches with Loretta and Bob,
but, but barely containing my rapturous song
Jon's calling names here like Santas reindeer
on Palmer on Leisz on Sarah on Sean.

I love watching the Watkins when there rocking with Garza
I want to be part of the band though
and when Mr. Tench is on the bench I want to be the piano.

I feel like singing and drinking and stuff
and I don't wanna care if I stumble or cry
Handle me like family and that'll be enough,
to keep me from dying when I want to die.

When over the rainbow's too far
go to Lar-go to Lar-go to Largo

When over the rainbow's too far
go to Lar-go to Lar-go to Largo
