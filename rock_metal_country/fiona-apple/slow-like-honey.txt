You moved like honey
In my dream last night
Yeah, some old fires
Were burning
You came near to me
And you endeared to me
Nut you couldn't
Quit discern me
Does that scare you
I'll let you run away
But your heart
Will not oblige you
You'll remember me
Like a melody
Yeah, I'll haunt the
World inside you

And my big secret
Gonna win you over
Slow like honey
Heavy with mood

I'll let you see me
I'll covet your regard
I'll invade your demeanor
And you'll yield to me
Like a scent in the breeze
And you'll wonder
What it is about me

It's my big secret
Keeping you coming
Slow like honey
Heavy with mood

Though dreams
Can be deceiving
Like faces are to hearts
They serve for
Sweet relieving
When fantasy and reality
Lie too far apart

So I stretch myself across
Like a bridge
And I pull you to the edge
And stand there waiting
Trying to attain
The end to satisfy the story
Shall I release you
Must I release you
As I rise to meet my glory

But my big secret
Gonna hover over your life
Gonna keep you reaching
When I'm gone like yesterday
When I'm high like heaven
When I'm strong like music
'Cause I'm slow like honey, and
Heavy with mood
