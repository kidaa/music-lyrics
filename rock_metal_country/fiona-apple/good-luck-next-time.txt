Do you know I saw you yesterday, 
Please don't explain, 
cos I know what you're going to say. 
I might be dumb but I'm not blind, 
How many times do you have to lie,  
Before it breaks us in two. 
and because of my better judgement, 
huh, I decided to let it pass, 
But now I just can't entertain it, 
So baby move your ass. 
Good luck next time. 
It's over, 
It's over again, 
And baby that's why,  
It's true, 
I cannot deny. 
And now I am so sorry to say that's the last time, 
you treat me that way. 
You said I was a loser! 
I didn't have a clue, 
but I got smart, 
and I got rid of you. 
I might be young but I am wise, 
So please don't bother to justify, 
I can't take this shit no more. 
And because of my better judgement, 
I couldn't let it pass, 
You know I just won't entertain you,  
so baby move your ass.
