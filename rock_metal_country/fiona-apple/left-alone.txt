You made your major overtures
When you were a sure and oritund mutt
And I was still a dewy petal
Rather than a moribund slut
My love wrecked you
You packed to twirl your skirt at the palace
It hurt more than it ought to hurt
I went to work to cultivate a callus

[Hook]
And now I'm hard, too hard to know
I don't cry when I'm sad anymore, no no
Tears calcify in my tummy
Fears coincide with the tow

How can I ask anyone to love me
When all I do is beg to be left alone?

Oh, when I try to love
I can love the same man in the same bed in the same city
But not in the same room, it's a pity, but
Oh, it never bothered me before
Not 'til this guy, what a guy, oh God what a good guy
And I can't even enjoy him

[Hook]

How can I ask anyone to love me
When all I do is beg to be left
When all I do is beg to be left
When all I do is beg to be left alone
Alone, alone

My ills are reticulate
My woes are granular
The ants weigh more than the elephants
Nothing, nothing is manageable
So, couldnt we skip the valedictories?
I can see a door there:
Shut it and forget my number

[Hook]

How can I ask anyone to love me
When all I do is beg to be left
When all I do is beg to be left
When all I do is beg to be left alone
