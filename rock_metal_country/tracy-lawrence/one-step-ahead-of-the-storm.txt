Broke down on the interstate
Just outside of Wichita
I said ";Dont' worry Baby, It'll be alright";
Two young and crazy kids
Who thought we knew it all
California hunger in our eyes

Chorus
I could smell the rain
I could feel the wind
I could see the clouds rollin in
But in the arms of love we stayed safe and warm
One step ahead of the storm

Our California dreams went south
So we headed east to Baton Rouge
You said ";Don't worry baby, It'll be alright";
Louisiana holds a brighter day
Had my doubts to tell the truth
But through it all
You were right there by my sideRepeat Chorus

We were one step ahead of the storm
