I never felt as helpless, as I do today
My world just fell around me as I watched you drive away
Theres nothing left between us, somehow we've grown apart
Cause I've got through my head, I just can't break it to my heart
Chorus
I can't believe this is me on the hurtin side of pain
Siftin through the ashes still tryin to find a flame
But the flame has turned to embers left glowing in the dark
I've got it through my head, I just can't break it to my heart
___
If I could, Lord knows I would spin back the hands of time
and piece these scattered memories that are cluttered in my head
Pick up where we left off and make a brand new start
I've got it through my head, I just can't break it to my heart
Chorus
