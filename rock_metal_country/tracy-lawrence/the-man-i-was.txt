Look at me in that photograph
Before we were ever us
Long before you found someone else
and broke our sacred trust

I hardly recognize myself
Sure has been awhile
Amazing how much my life has changed
Since I've worn that smileWhat happened to that smile

chorus
There I am with my head held high
My step was quick and my eyes were bright
Back when I believed in love
And would lay my heart on the line
I don't know which hurts the most
Losing you or having to see
The picture of the man I was
Before the fool you made of me
I've wasted time here missing you
Doubting who I am
I can't make you something you're not
But i can be me again
Oh deep down I know I can...
repeat chorus
tag
I want to be the man I was
Before the fool you made of me
