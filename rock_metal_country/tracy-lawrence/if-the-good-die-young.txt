It was Sunday morning, I was seven years old
In the backyard playing in a big mudhole
I was all decked out, ready for church
Had my brand new suit all covered in dirt
Mama hit the ceiling she was fit to be tied
Talkin 'bout how shes gonna tan my hide
But Daddy was laughing when I changed my clothes
'Saying ";Mama leave the boy alone";
Chorus
Cause if the good die young
If the good die young
Mama's little boy gonna have alot of fun
Cause he's gonna live forever if the good die young
___
Ten years later had a hot rod ford
Constable clocked me at a hundred and four
Judge said ";boy you're gonna hurt yourself
you'd a long been dead if you were anybody else";
Chorus
Cause if the good die young
If the good die young
Oh there ain't a sentence gonna hold you son
Cause he's gonna live forever if the good die young
___
Well I got a good heart, I wouldn't hurt a soul
But I'm gonna keep rocking till they call that roll
Old St.Peter he's gonna have to wait
I'm gonna go to heaven but I might be late
Chorus
Cause if the good die young
If the good die young
Pedal to the metal, let your motor run
Cause he's gonna live forever if the good die young
___
Chorus
And if the good die young
if the good die young
They got the jams, we'll have some fun
Cause I'm gonna live forever if the good die young
