Johnny Baker works down at the Mill
Makes enough to make ends meet 
And pay his bills
Even though he comes from the wrong side of the tracks
He's the first on there to lend a hand
Or give the shirt right off his back


Chorus
From what we give we make a living
Those dollars, diamonds and gold
But that old cliche' is a given
You reap what you sow
When you reach out your hand and heart
Then your soul is satisfied
From what we give we make a living
from what we give
We make a life


Mr. Millers got a mansion on the hill
He spent his whole life
Chasing that almighty dollar bill
But all his so-called riches
Somethings missing in his soul
It takes more than having everything
To make a man feel whole
Repeat Chorus

When you reach out your hand and your heart
Then your soul is satisfied
From what we give we make a living
From what we give
We make a life
From what we give we make a living
From what we give
We make a life
