Work, Work, Work day after day
Fifty hour week, forty hour pay
Not time to get over on this overtime
Yea I'm always runnin', I'm always runnin' behind

I got a friday night date with my sweetheart
I'm already late and the car won't start
Lord, I feel like hittin that car and cryin'
Yes I'm always runnin', I'm always runnin' behind

All my life it's been this way
One dollar short and one day late
One rung lower on the ladder I'm tryin to climb
If I ever get lucky, If I ever get rich
Gonna tow my life up out of this ditch
Watch the world go by while I unwind
Yeah I'm always running, But I'm alwayas runnin' behind
