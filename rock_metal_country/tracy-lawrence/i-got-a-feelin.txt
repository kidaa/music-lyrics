I'm out here stranded on this Oklahoma Road
nothing but a broken truck, heat and dust
and a million high line poles
If only I could tap the line, I'd be just fine
If I could talk to her right now
Cause there's a voice inside of me
That's saying something's wrong
Cause I've tried a hundred times and a hundred dimes to reach her on the phone
and like the sun my hearts sinkin cause I'm thinkin it don't matter anyhow
Chorus
I got a feelin' she ain't feelin' what I'm feelin anymore
I got a sneakin suspicion love is walkin out the door
Now I'm dealin with a heartache like I've never felt before
I got a feelin' she ain't feelin' what I'm feelin anymore
I like this ramblin life but what a price to pay
To think I'd let a dollar sign and a diesle whine drive her love away
I've got a real premonition
She ain't missin me as much as I miss her
Repeat Chorus
I got a feelin' she ain't feelin' what I'm feelin' anymore
