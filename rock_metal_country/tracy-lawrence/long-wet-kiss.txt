If I was lost on the ocean
Stranded in the middle of the sea
I'd have to live on devotion
Hopin' that you'd rescue me
If I was nearin' the end
and runnin' out of time
The only thing that would keep me alive
Chorus
It's your long wet kiss
In the mornin that I can't resist
Can't deny it when it feels like this
Theres nothin' more i would miss
Than your long wet kiss
Some men are driven by diamonds
Some they are drawn to Gold
I could live life on desire
With only your body to hold
If I was pushed to the edge
And had to offer my life
Darlin' I would pay any price
I wouldn't think twice
Chorus
