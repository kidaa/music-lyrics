Yeah I'm a little tired, I'm a little wired
Four pots of coffee in the last eight hours
Pacing the floor all the way through
Late, late movies and the early cartoons

Now you're wanting me to believe
You ain't fooling around on me

chorus
Even through bloodshot eyes
I can see right through your lies
I mighta been born yesterday
But I've been up all night
Despite the caffeine
and the lack of visine
I'm not as wide eyed as I seem
You left looking fine now you
come back home
Your hair messed up and your
blouse buttoned wrongI'd have to be a fool to believe
Anything you're telling me

Repeat chorus

Never went quite as far as loving you blind
But you had me in the dark for a long, long time
Now you're looking at a man who's seen the light
So pardon the way I look
Sunset to sunrise, haven't slept a wink
But I feel like I just woke up
";Cause even through bloodshot eyes
I can see right through your lies
I mighta been born yesterday
But I've been up, I've been up, I've been up
I've been up all night
I've been up all night
I've been up all night
