I know she'll be back
No matter where she's been
Cause her heart doesn't notice
When it's breaking mine again
Still I'll sit here like a fool
Watch the world go round
Till she comes back
To her old stompin grounds

Chorus
She can find her someone else to hold
She can even wake up in his arms
But when it's time to come in from the cold
She always ends up right here in my heart
Her old stompin groundsShe thinks I don't hurt
No she doesn't have a clue
When we said it was over
She thought we were through
When it all falls to pieces
In the new world that she's found
She comes back
To her old stompin grounds

Repeat Chorus
