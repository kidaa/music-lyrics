You can't see a freight train coming with your back against the track
You can only take the wrong road so long before you can't come back
I was heartbroke and lonely forgot what love was all about
But then just when I hit bottom she reached down and pulled me out
Led me to the promised land ny rock of ages whe I felt too weak to stand
I was blind and could not see she rescued me
Lord that woman was my Saviour she loved the devil out of me
[ guitar ]
I was once a believer till life got the best of me
Just a ship without an anchor adrift and lost at sea
Like the wind she came and filled my sails and put me back on course
She was the lighthouse in the harbor that brought me back to shore
Led me to the promised land...
[ fiddle ]
I was blind and could not see...
I said that woman was my Saviour she loved the devil out of me
