I don't say I love you quite enough I know
Sometimes I go for days
I'm ashamed to say
The world moves so fast
The words come so slow
And I let those excuses get in my way

Chorus
But while you sleep
Sometimes I lie awake and watch you breathe
And in the silence that surrounds the dead of night
I bare my soul and all the words sound right
I pray the Lord our hearts to keep
While You SleepThe days march through our lives like a soft parade
Laughter and the tears
Our hopes and fears
And I keep remembering things I forget to say
Perhaps some day
I'll let you know my dear

Repeat Chorus
