Thomas Jefferson, he had slaves
In the land of the free and the home of the brave
I read about him in the seventh grade
He's forgiven

JFK he loved to run around
He and Norma Jean painted that town
But we know him as a hero now
He's forgiven

Chorus
Baby I know I did you wrong
Thats why I'm here, thats why you're gone
I don't know just what I've done
To be one of the unforgivenI had an uncle, he dodged the draft
They said step forward and he stepped back
But we all cut him some slack
He's forgiven

Judas betrayed the Christ with a kiss
Cartel kings get a slap on the wrist
Jesse James and Billy the Kid
They're all forgiven

Repeat Chorus|solo
I've made mistakes, thats what life is
But there ain't a thing i can't live with
And even though you can't forgive
You're Forgiven
