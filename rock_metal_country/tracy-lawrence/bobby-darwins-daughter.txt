Bobby Darwin's daughter looks up from the bible she's been reading to the clock on her dirty wall of a double wide, its 3 am. Her husbands on the town shooting pool or foolin round, or all of the above it doesn't matter anymore, she can't get through to him, seems like only yesterday they were married in a chapel. Candlelight the whole nine yards, honeymoon in Vegas, they settled down. Now its lonely nights and hungry kids, she just keeps on looking for the life that's not the life she's living now.
