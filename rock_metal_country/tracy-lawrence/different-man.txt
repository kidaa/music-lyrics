Who knows what I'm doing here tonight on this barstool
As if I didn't know where I should be
Through the darkness of the dim neon, and lonely shade of blue
The Light is a mighty hard thing to see
But sitting here, it just occurred to me


Chorus
I was the man she counted on
To do her right, Lord she was wrong
I was the man who wasn't there
Who made it seem he didn't care
Now she needs someone to hold her
To make her feel alive
And she'll be with a different man tonight


I can't believe I turned my back to the love there in her heart
And turned away from those tears in her eyes
Now I know where I belong is right there in her arms
Though it took so long for me to see the light
I'm leaving here a different man tonight


Repeat Chorus


Tag
Now she needs someone to hold her
And make her feel alive
And she'll be with a Different Man tonight
Oh she'll be with a different man tonight
