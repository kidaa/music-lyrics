There's a Honkey Tonk on the edge of town
I used to call my second home
It's a place to go just to get away
When I wanted to be alone
Well, early one morning had a fight with my darling
That went from bad to worse
It ended when she said ";Your second home, just became your first";
Chorus
Now the jukebox is my alarm clock, I wake up in a corner booth
I don't have a tab, don't need no cab
Cause the dance floor is my living room
Well, I might die of a broken heart
But I'll never die of thirst
Now that my second home has become my first
___
Well I don't have to pay no mortgage
I don't have to mow no lawn
Alot of friends come to see me
Some stay until the break of dawn
I can paint the town without leaving the house
I can feel good until it hurts
Now that my home sweet second home
Just became my first
Chorus
