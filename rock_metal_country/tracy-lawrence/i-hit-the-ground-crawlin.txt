It's true, I lied, I cheated
and the truth is, that ain't all
While you were thinking of me
I was busy thinking of myself
I never gave and I took all I needed
Running wild until you walked
and since you left
If you're wondering where I fell

Well I hit the ground crawling
I heard your memory calling
And I can see from the bottom
of this bottle I'm clinging to
That the reason you're long gone
is that I treated you so wrong
But I hit the ground crawling
Right back to you

To get us back together
I'll cry, I'll beg, I'll bend
I swear I've learned my lesson
Darling don't give up on me
'Cause the nights go on forever
Will the heartache ever end
Can't stand to live without you
I'm begging on bended knee'Cause I hit the ground crawling
I heard your memory calling
And I can see from the bottom
of this bottle I'm clinging to
That the reason you're long gone
Is that I treated you so wrong
But I hit the ground crawling
Right back to you

Yeah, I hit the ground crawling
Right back to you
