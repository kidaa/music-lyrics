I knew she was lonely and I was alone
A stranger in a strange town, too far from home
Her eyes blue as diamonds, her hair black as coal
I could feel the desire, burning
Like fire down to my soul

Chorus
In a moment of weakness, who would have known
God was in Heaven
You were at home
I could have easily fallen
and forgotten til dawn
But in a moment of weakness
Your love held strong

I could say I wasn't tempted, that would be a lie
A man is only human, man, she was so alive
Could have been in her arms, truth is my heart
Wouldn't let me give inRepeat Chorus

Could have said it didn't matter
