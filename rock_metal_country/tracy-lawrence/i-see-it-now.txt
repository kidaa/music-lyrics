It's good to see your face again, it's been awhile
How am I doing, Well I get by somehow
You sure look good since your new love came in your life
You know I didn't see that fire in you he's found
Oh but I see it now
Chorus
Oh I never saw that look in your eyes
And I never had you hold me that tight
And I never saw you dance with your feet off the ground
Oh but I see It Now
___
Holding him, you never looked more beautiful
Letting go has been so hard on me
And sitting here, it's clear to see what he means to you
The way you look at him, it ain't no mystery
He's all I couldn't be
Repeat Chorus
And I never saw you dance with your feet off the ground
Oh but I see it now
