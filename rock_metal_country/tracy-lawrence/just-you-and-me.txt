Baby take off your coat
We ain't in no hurry
I see the fear in your eyes
But girl don't you worry
I'll keep the candles lit all night
So you'll know everythings all right
We've got everything we need
And it's just you and me

I've got the covers turned down
Come lay here beside me
Oh baby let down your hair
And your doubts about me
I'm gonna make you feel tonight
Like you've never felt in your life
We've got everything we need
and it's just you and me
Chorus
There ain't no one around
And the only sound is your
heart beating next to mine
Cast your fears in the fire
Give into your desire
Put your faith into me
'Cause I've got everything we need
and it's just you and meSolo|repeat chorus

Oh baby let down your hair
And your doubts about me
