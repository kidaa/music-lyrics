Lately I've been seeing a certain glow upon your face
But I know I'm not the reason
You wear that different smile these days
Though you haven't said you're leaving
Darlin I've already heard
Don't you know your silence is talking louder than your words
Chorus
Don't talk to me that way
Cause it's my heart thats being broken
Goodbye still hurts the same even if it goes unspoken
You're tearing me apart with everything that you don't say
There's so much I haven't heard and thas less than I deserve
Don't talk to me that way
___
Why can't you lay it on the line
And say you found somebody new
I can't take the silence as well as I can take the truth
I don't want you here beside me
If that's not where you want to be
But you ain't said a single word and that's not enough for me
Chorus
There's so much I haven't heard, that's less than I deserve
Don't talk to me that way
