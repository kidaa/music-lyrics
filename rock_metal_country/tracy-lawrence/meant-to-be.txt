A crowded room a sudden glance more than just coincidence
Meant to be you and me
To see the look that's in your eyes makes the tears well up in mine
Destiny now I can see
Some things are just meant to be
Just like sunsets moonlight stars that shoot across the sky at night
All that I am faithfully
I give everything cause some things are just meant to be

More than chance or circumstance
I never thought two hearts could dance so pefrectly
Just like you and me
And even when we're old and gray I'll love you more than I do today
Eternity can't you see
Some things are just meant to be...
[ steel ]
Oh some things are just meant to be...
