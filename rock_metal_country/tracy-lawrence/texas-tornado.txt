You called me up from Amarillo, said you were coming to town
And thought I'd like to tell you hello, and drive an old friend around
I pulled up to the airport, confident and cool
But when you stepped off that plane, I knew I was your fool
Chorus
My Little Texas Tornado, blowing me away again
I swore it wouldn't happen again, but I looked at you and then
I'm like a tumbleweed in a wild west Texas wind
You're blowing me away again
___
You're lying with me in Atlanta, it's such a beautiful lie
You play me like a piano, I always let you get by
I know I'll go through hell girl, when you find someone else
But right now I'm in heaven, and I can't help myself
Repeat Chorus
I'm like a tumbleweed in a wild west Texas wind
You're blowing me away again
Texas Tornado
Blowing me away again, I swore it wouldn't happen again
But I look at you and then
I'm like a tumbleweed in a wild west Texas wind
