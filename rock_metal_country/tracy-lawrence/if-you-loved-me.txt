I see the way he doesn't treat you right
I see the tears that you try to hide
I feel that heartache that you don't show
Wish I had a way to let you know
Chorus
I would be the shoulder you could cry on
The heart and soul you know you could rely on
With every breath I'll ever take
I swear I'd never let forever end
If You loved me
If you loved me again
___
There was a time I had it all with you
'Til it came undone, from what I didn't do
Now he's making the same mistakes
and when he loses you, if it's not to late
Repeat Chorus
Tag
With every breath I'll ever take
I swear I'd never let forever end
If you loved me
