Lately she's been picking fights, dropping hints and just last night
I caught a tear as she slipped off to sleep
She's not here but she's not gone
I guess she must be waiting on the kind of man I promised her I'd be
Chorus
As any fool can see
She's gonna cross that line
She's got leaving on her mind
And it's too late but what keeps killing me
Is knowing I've been blind
As any fool can see
___
How long did I think she'd stand for me to be the kind of man
That came and went just as I dang well pleased
While she sits at home alone
with fears and feelings of her own
Lord knows goodbye would bring me to my knees
Repeat Chorus
