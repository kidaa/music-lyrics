There's a little house I drive by everyday going into town
And it just kills me to see how he's let it run down
When I built it, to hear you tell it
I'd built you a mansion on a hill
and even now that's where part of me still lives
Chorus
Wish I could hold you and know you still want me
To be the only one on Earth you need
Just to make your dreams come true like I once did
I'd give anything to be your everything again
___
I know I said I wouldn't call you
I know the trouble it could bring
But I'm sure by now you've told him I don't mean anything
I'll let you go but I want you to know
Before this conversation ends
I'd give anything to be your everything again
Chorus
I'd give anything to be your everything again
