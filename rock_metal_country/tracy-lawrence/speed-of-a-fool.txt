Couldn't tell me nothing
Had to learn it on my own
On the restless side of seventeen
The Day that I left home
Screaming down that highway
With a passion to break any rules
I went crashing at the speed of a fool


She was serving all night coffee
at a San Antonio Cafe
She was headed nowhere
I was headed her way
With a trusting soul and a naive heart
there was nothing I could do
So I went crashing , at the speed of a fool


Chorus
You're either born for holding back
or bound for letting go
So I throw caution to the wind
Wherever it may blow
It's the only way I know
I go crashing at the speed of a fool
Got a hunger for that highway
I know will never end
Lord I can't help what I'm not
and won't change what I am
Til' the roll is called up yonder
To my own self I'll be true
and go crashing at the speed of a fool


Repeat Chorus
