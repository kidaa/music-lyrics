I was raised in a Christian home
On Bible readin gospel songs
Church doors opened up you'd see my face
Sundays twice, Weds too, I'd take my seat on the front row pew,
Singing Rock of Ages and Amazing Grace

Preacher said heavens the place to go
With pearly gates and streets of gold
I guess for the preacher thats alright
But I hope heavens another story
 With a good ole boy bound for glory
A little bit like of texas on a saturday nite

Chorus
And I hope heaven has a honky tonk
With a 5 pc band,
Cowboy boots,and bluejeans are  part of the master plan
And I hope Hanks on the juke box, Bob Wills has a fiddle in his hand
And I hope heaven has a honky tonk with a 5 piece band


I hope those hardwood floors are just like glass
The girls I ask wanna dance
And each and every waitress is divine
I hope that mean old bouncers got a big halo
Those neon lights will always glow
They ain't never heard of closing time

Repeat Chorus|Repeat Chorus


I hope heaven has a honky tonk with a 5 pc band
