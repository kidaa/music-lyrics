Sittin here in Ft.Worth and for what it's worth
It might as well be timbucktu
Girl, I'm missing you
The further i go in life, the more I realize
I'm no closer to that elusive moon
I can't put out your fire cause everywhere I turn
Theres a memory to burn


Chorus
Somewhere between the Moon and you
I'm fighting off the chill of the cold hard truth
That rainbow I've been chasing left my whole world blue
I lost my dreams somewhere between the Moon and You


I still see your smile and it haunts me every mile
Along this winding road
That I walk alone
They say that time should ease the pain
But in my heart a bitter rain still lingers on
How could I have been so wrong
I climbed that ladder thinkin' I could never fall
Until I lost it all
Repeat Chorus

That rainbow I've been chasin' left my whole world blue
I lost my dreams somewhere between the moon and you
