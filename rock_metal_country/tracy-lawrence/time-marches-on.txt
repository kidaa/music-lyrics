Sister cries out from her baby bed
Brother runs in feathers on his head
Mamma's in her room learning how to sew
Daddy's drinking beer, listening to the radio
Hank Williams sings ";Kaw Liga"; and ";";Dear John";
And Time marches on, Time marches on


Sisters using rouge and clear complexion soap
Brothers wearing beads and he smokes alot of dope
Mamma is depressed, barely makes a sound
Daddy's got a girlfriend in another town
Bob Dylan sings ";Like a rolling stone";
And Time marches on, Time Marches on
Bridge
The south moves north, the north moves south
A star is born, a star burns out
The only thing that stays the same
Is everything changes, Everything changes


Sister calls herself a Sexy Grandma
Brothers on a diet for high cholesterol
Mamma's out of touch with reality
Daddy's in the ground beneath a maple Tree
As the angels sing an old Hank Williams Song
Time marches on, Time Marches on
Time Marches on, Time marches on
Time Marches on, Time Marches on
