This makin' a livin' is killin' me
I work like a dog in this hot factory
Can't even afford a vacation when I've got the time
But I've got road maps of Mexico
Brochures and pictures of places to go
Dreamin' in color. Livin' in black and white

Chorus
I can drink margaritas with sweet senoritas
Work on my tropical tan
Dangle my feet in the crystal blue water
Lay in the snow white sand
I've never been down to Mexico
But I'm gonna go there tonight
I'm dreaming in color. Livin' in Black and white

I'd like to buy a new cadillac
Build me a house with a pool out back
And eat at the country club every saturday night
But there ain't much pay in my ol' paycheck
But I'll win the lotto one day I bet
Dreamin' in color, livin in black and whiteRepeat Chorus

I'm dreamin' in color, livin in black and white
