I met him in a dive down in New Orleans
I recognized his handsome face
It was none of my business, but I had to know
What he was doing in this kind of place
Cause he used to have money, he used to have honeys
He used to be Society's prince
But he still wore a grin when I sat beside him
and asked where all that money went
Chorus
Some was spent on Gambling, alot was spent on women
A Little on some good Cabernet
Three or Four divorces, at least that many horses
who never left the starting gate
Diamond rings and furs, swampland in New Jersey
That week I spent a year in LA
I hate to admit it, I threw the rest away
___
He said money don't mean nothing in this game of life
It's just a way of keeping score
Show me a man whose got everything
I'll show you one who wants even more
Well so smoke em' when you got em'
When you hit bottom, you gotta have a reason to smile
You can have a little piece of the rock
I'll take a little piece of mind
Chorus
He said to me
Diamond rings and furs, swampland in New Jersey
That week I spent a year in LA
