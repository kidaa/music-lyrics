Last night she wasn't sleepin' when I came slippin in
I knew I had it comin, cause she knew where I'd been
She said ";A Part of me walks out that door everytime you leave
so remember this while you're losin me";
It only takes one bar to make a prison
And you've been doin' too much time away from home
She said ";It takes two hearts to hold a love together
But it only takes one fool to be alone";
She said ";I've sat here in the darkness, one too many times
and stealin thoughts of holdin' you has been my only crime";
Right then I realized she'd always been the key
and locked up in her arms is the only time I'm free
It only takes one bar to make a prison
And I was doin' too much time away from home
It takes two hearts to hold a love together
But it only takes one fool to be alone
It only takes one bar to make a prison
and it only takes one fool to be alone
