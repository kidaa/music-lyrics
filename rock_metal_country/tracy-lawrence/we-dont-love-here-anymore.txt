Every night when I come home this old house, it's always dark
you don't wait up like you used to
Like you did at the start and I can feel the changes
as I'm walkin through the door, We still live in the same house
But we don't love here anymore
We still share the same old bed
But now our dreams seem worlds apart
We don't touch the way we used and it's breaking my heart
We're turning into strangers, the ties that bind are frayed and worn
We still live in the same house
But we don't love here anymore
Chorus
And I would do anything for what we had before
We still live in the same house
But we don't love here anymore

Chorus
