You can move to another town
Take everything i ever gave you
Call when you're feeling down
Tell me everything I never listened to
What a sad affair
I'm here and you're way out thereNow your friends say you did the right thing
You were never meant to be a wife
And their expert opinions may bring
You to making up your mind for life
What a tragic night
Truth ain't always such a blinding light
chorus
I can love you from here to Texas
I can find you in Tennessee
You can run from here to Kingdom come
But you can't run away from me
You can stand by your innocent line
and pretend that things are better now
But there's a flaw in your perfect design
You'd fix it but you don't know how
Baby I can drive
I can keep it on the road
As long as I'm alive
repeat chorus
I could find you in California
Or any place that you might be
You can run from here to Kingdom come
But you can't run away from me
