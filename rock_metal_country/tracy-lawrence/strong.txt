In her bare feet, white cotton dress
A ribbon holding back her curls
In a sweet gentle voice, she sings a lullaby
To two sleepy little girls
In the nightlight glow as her babies drift off
She looks so fragile, looks so so soft

[Chorus:]
She's strong
Solid as a rock
Like a lighthouse standing alone
She's strong got the world on her shoulders
She keeps carring on 
She can take the heat, she can take the cold winter
She's got faith there's no quit in her 
She's strong
Yeah so strong

There's a crayon picture says 'We love you mom'
She keeps it in a frame on her desk 
There's a friend of a friend 
Who calls now and then
But she's not ready just yet
She might get lonely in the still of the night
But she'll hold out till she knows it's right

[Chorus]

And sometimes when nobody else is around
She gets down
And sometimes in a moment of weakness 
A single tear falls, and that's all

She's strong
She's strong
She can take the heat she can take the cold winter
She's got faith there's no quit in her 
She's strong
Yeah so strong
She's strong 
Yeah so strong
