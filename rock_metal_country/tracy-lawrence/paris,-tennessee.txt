I may not have a whole lot of money
But I got enuff to cover you and me
I'm taking off wont you come with me honey
Gonna take you all the way to Paris, Tennessee

I want to show you the riviera
Got new tires and a good cb
Put on some lipstick and your mascara
Cause were going all the way to Paris, Tennessee

Baby I adore you
Dont say I never done nothin for you
That just aint true

Baby, I adore you
Don't say I never done nothin for you
That just ain't true

We may not see no eiffel tower
But I got a cousin that I want you to meet
And he can pick the wildwood flower
Better than anybody down in Paris, Tennessee

We're goin all the way to Paris, Tennesee

Oo la la baby
have no idea what he says in the next line! LOL
