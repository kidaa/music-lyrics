I always pride myself on being strong
You've never seen me cry and carry on
But after seein' you with your new love
Suddenly I'm all choked up

Chorus
Any minute now, you're gonna see
Years of tears rollin down my cheeks
A flash flood of old memories
Will come pourin out
Any minute now, it won't be long
It's been coming since you've been gone
I'm gonna cry out loud
Any minute now

I said I'd always live by my own rules
I swore I'd never be nobodys fool
Thought I knew how to hide the pain
But that's all about to changeRepeat Chorus

Any Minute Now
