There's a red brick in a white wall
Somebody's brush forgot to paint
So it sits there all alone
Like a hopeful sinner
Who finally goes to church
she don't sit among the Christians
Cause she questions her own worth
Oh she's lonely
chorus
Lonely like the way you left me
Nothing I know's gonna get me
through, losing you
the worst of loves analogies
are tangled up inside of me
but the only one that brings 
me to my knees
Is Lonely
There's a man in his own prison
with a crime nobody knows
He has sentenced himself to life
witn no pardon or parole
Oh he's lonely
repeat chorus|solo|repeat Chorus
I'm a red brick in a white wall
Somebody's brush forgot to paint
