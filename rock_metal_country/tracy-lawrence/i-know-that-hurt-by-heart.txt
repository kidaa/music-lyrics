It's dark in here tonight
A great place to come and hide from the blues
Hey, I don't mean to intrude
But I've seen that look before
I've heard that slamming door too
Just like you


Chorus
I know that hurt by heart
I've been right where you are
I know how it feels when your world is falling apart
You're not alone tonight
I know what lonely is like
I've still got the scars
I know that hurt by heart


Hope you don't take this wrong
But that smile you're putting on can't disguise
these tears in your eyes
and laughing like you don't care
Can't ease the pain down there inside
beleive me, I've tried
Repeat Chorus


Tag
You're not alone tonight
I know what lonely is like
I've still got the scars
I know that Hurt by Heart
I've still got the scars
I Know that hurt by Heart
