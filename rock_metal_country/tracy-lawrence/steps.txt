Little baby boy, sittin round his toys
Gettin tired of crawlin
He's pullin up on an easy chair
He's gonna try a little walkin
He's takin steps
A six year old with a new school bag
Starin down his drive
Holdin on to his mama's hand
he's going on his first bus ride
He's takin steps
A teenage boy in a rented tux
Reaching out a trembling hand
To a pretty young girl in a satin dress
Asking her to dance
chorus
Steps, some big, some small
Puttin one foot after the other
Steps, the trick to it all
Is diggin down to find a little courage
and it's okay
to be afraid
You gotta have faith
Life's all about
Steps
For 22 years she stood by a man
Who did her wrong
With a packed suitcase
And a Greyhound ticket, she's finally gone
She's takin steps
At a meeting downtown, a tired old drunk
stands and says his name
That leaves him eleven to go and he can 
already feel the change
He's takin steps
Somewhere a great Grandpa says
";I'm ready to go";
Peacefully drifts off to sleep
