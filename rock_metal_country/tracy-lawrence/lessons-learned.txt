I was ten years old the day I got caught
With some dime store candy that I never bought
I hung my head and I faced the wall
as Daddy showed me wrong from right
He said this hurts me more than it does you
Theres just some things son, that you just don't do
Is anything I'm sayin' getting through
Daddy I can see the light
Chorus
Oh Lessons learned, man they sure run deep
They don't go away and they don't come cheap
Oh theres no way around it
Cause this world turns on lessons learned
Granddaddy was a man I loved
He bought me my first ball and glove
Even taught me how to drive his old truck
Circling that ol' town square
He spoke of life with a slow southern drawl
I never heard him cause I knew it all
But I sure listened when I got the call
That he was no longer there
Chorus
Oh Lessons learned, man they sure run deep
They don't go away and they don't come cheap
Oh theres no way around it
cause this world turns
On lessons learnedSolo|repeat chorus
