She was always there taking care of me
And I never took the time to look close enough to see
That taking her for granted was taking it's toll
I ran the race for me
She went an extra mile for us
I kept hammering away at the solid rock of trust
If I was burning my last chance
I never saw the smoke

Cause she never let it show
From the ouside looking in nobody could've known
She didn't cry, She didn't shout
I was blind, but I see now
She was breaking from the inside out

I was seldom there even when I was around
If I'd seen the signs back then
Maybe she would be here now
I never knew that she was leaving
Til the day she said goodbyeCause she never let it show
From the outside looking in, nobody could've known
She didn't cry, she didn't shout
I was blind but I see now
She was breaking from the Inside Out

Solo
She didn't cry, she didn't shout
I was blind but I see now
She was breaking from the inside out
She was breaking from the inside out
