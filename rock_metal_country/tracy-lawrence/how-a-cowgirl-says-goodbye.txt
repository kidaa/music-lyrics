A cup of coffee with the first sunlight
At a last chance Texaco
I'm thumbing through a worn out road map
Trying to decide which way to go
These empty miles and her memory
They just seem to linger on
She left me on this lost highway
Wondering why and where she's gone

Chorus
Thats how a cowgirl breaks a young mans heart
That's how my whole world slowly came apart
With a cold and empty stare
As if I wasn't there
She didn't even stop to cry
Thats how a cowgirl says goodbyeCalled up her Mam in Abilene
Just to find out how she'd been
She said she'd stopped awhile in San Antone
To spend some time with an old friend
With all the distance in between us
I'm sure I never cross her mind
It may take all these roads ahead
Just to leave it all behind

 Repeat Chorus
 Repeat Chorus
