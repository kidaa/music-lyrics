It's a crying shame what fools we've been
To fight for no good reason, when neither one of us gives in
I don't love you is what it takes to end it all
But instead we'll go back to bed, back to back to face the wall
Chorus
Back to Back, we're falling out of love
As giving in gets harder to do, we start giving up
We lay together facing the dark
Each tear that falls is breaking our hearts
Back to Back, side by side, we're miles apart
___
What a fool I am to lay here and not hold her
In a bed where love once burned, our hearts just grow colder
Well, I love you are the words on my mind
But the stones we threw in anger
Have built a wall we can't climb
Chorus
Back to Back, side by side, we're miles apart
