My heart is spent my pride bent her love is gone and who knows where it went
And everyday is one more day little steps that I can barely take
They say falling out of love's the hardest thing you'll ever do but it's not true
It may be the fall that brings you to your knees
Yeah the losing it all leaves you weak
Yeah your heart drops and your world stops when you're falling out of love
Well it's not the fall that's so hard it's the gettin' back up

I was OK at first then it started to hurt
And the gettin' better just kept gettin' worse
But as bad as it's been I'm not givin' in slowly but surely I'm finding my feet again
Every minute's one more minute I just made it through that's the best I can do
It may be the fall...
[ steel ]
Your heart drops...
