Stars Over Texas


As you lie in my arms
Girl my hearts on my sleeve
Words come so hard, in moments like these
theres feelings I have, that are so hard to show
But right now theres one thing
I want you to know


Chorus
As long as the tides ebb
The earth turns the sun sets
I promise I'll always be true
And as long as theres Stars over Texas
Darling I'll hang the moon for you
I know I have stumbled and caused you some tears
When you needed me most I haven't always been here
I know I'm not always the man I should be
But don't ever wonder what you mean to me


Repeat Chorus

And as long as theres stars over Texas
Darling I'll hang the moon for you
Darling I'll hang the moon for you
