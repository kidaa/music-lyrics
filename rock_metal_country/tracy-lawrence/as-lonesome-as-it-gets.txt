I've been sitting here alone in the darkness
With the sound of goodbye ringin' in my head
I don't know how much longer I can go on like this
I'm about as lonesome as it gets
Just about as lonesome as it gets

For a long time now, we've been drifting apart
I should have been glad to see you go
But now that it's over and you're on a silver jet
It's about as lonesome as it gets
Just about as lonesome as it gets

Chorus
If it rained straight whiskey
forty days and nights
It would't be enough to numb this hurt I feel
Or keep this lump that's in my throat
From chokin' me to death
I'm about as lonesome as it gets
Just about as lonesome as it getsWhen they dig a six foot hole in the ground
and throw the dirt over me
Just let these words mark my final place of rest
This is as lonesome as it gets
Damn sure as lonesome as it gets

Repeat Chorus
