I don't know
I don't know which side I'm on
I don't know my right from left
Or my right from wrong
Say I'm a fool
You say I'm not for you
But if I'm a fool for you
Oh, that's something

Two hearts beat as one
Two hearts beat as one
Two hearts...

Can't stop the dance
Honey, this is my last chance
I said, can't stop the dance
Maybe this is my last chance

Two hearts beat as one
Two hearts beat as one
Two hearts...

They beat on black, beat on white
Beat on everything don't get it right
Beat on you, beat on me, beat on love

I don't know
How to say what's got to be said
I don't know if it's black or white
There's others see it red
I don't get the answers right
I'll leave that to you
Is this love out of fashion
Or is it the time of year
Are these words distraction
To the words you want to hear

Two hearts beat as one
Two hearts beat as one

I try to spit it out
I try to explain
The way I feel
Oh, yeah
Two hearts

I can't stop the dance
Maybe this is my last chance
I said I can't stop the dance
Maybe this is my last chance
I said don't stop the dance
Maybe this is my last chance
I said I can't stop the dance
Maybe this is our last chance
I said don't stop the dance
Maybe this is our last chance
