When I get to the bottom 
I go back to the top of the slide 
Where I stop and I turn 
And I go for a ride 
Till I get to the bottom  
And I see you again 

Do you, don't you want me to love you 
I'm coming down fast, but I'm miles above you 
Tell me, tell me, tell me, come on tell me the answer 
Well, you may be a lover, but you ain't no dancer. 

Helter skelter, helter skelter 
Helter skelter
