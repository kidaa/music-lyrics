Nobody else here baby no one else here to blame 
No one to point the finger...
It's just you and me and the rain 
Nobody made you do it, no one put words in your mouth 
Nobody here taking orders when love took a train heading south 
It's the blind leading the blond 
It's the stuff the stuff of country songs 

HEY IF GOD WILL SEND HIS ANGELS 
AND IF GOD WILL SEND A SIGN 
AND IF GOD WILL SEND HIS ANGELS 
Would everything be alright 

God has got his phone off the hook
Babe would he even pick up if he could 
It's been a while since we saw that child
Hangin' round this neighbourhood 
See his mother dealing in a doorway
See Father Christmas with a begging bowl 
Jesus sister's eyes are blister ... 
THE HIGH STREET never looked so low 

It's the blind leading the blond 
It's the cops collecting for the cons 
So where is the hope and where is the faith ... and the love 
What's that you say to me 
Does love... light up your Christmas tree 
The next minute you're blowing a fuse 
And the cartoon network turns into the news 

HEY IF GOD WILL SEND HIS ANGELS 
AND IF GOD WILL SEND A SIGN 
WELL IF GOD WILL SEND HIS ANGELS 
WHERE DO WE GO 

Jesus never let me down
You know Jesus used to show me the score 
Then they put Jesus in show business
Now it's hard to get in the door 

It's the stuff it's the stuff of country songs 
But I guess it was something to go on 

HEY IF GOD WILL SEND HIS ANGELS 
I SURE COULD USE THEM HERE RIGHT NOW 
WELL IF GOD WILL SEND HIS ANGELS 
WHERE DO WE GO...
