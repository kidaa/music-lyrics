So you never knew love until you crossed the line of grace 
And you never felt wanted till you had someone slap your face 
So you never felt alive until you almost wasted away 

You had to win 
You couldn't just pass 
The smartest ass 
At the top of the class 
Your flying colours 
Your family tree 
And all your lessons in history 

Please... please... please get up off your knees... 
Please... please... leave me out of this 
Please 

So you never knew how long you'd stoop to make that call 
And you never knew what was on the ground till they made you crawl 
So you never knew that the heaven you keep you stole 

Your catholic blues 
Your convent shoes 
Your stick on tattoos 
Now they're making the news 
Your holy war 
Your northern star 
Your sermon on the mount 
From the boot of your car 

Please...please... please get up off your knees 
Please...please... leave me out of this please 

So love is hard and love is tough 
But love is not what you're thinking of 

September... streets capsizing... 
spilling over down the drain 
...shards of glass splinters like rain 
But you could only feel your own pain... 
october... talking getting nowhere... 
November... December... remember... 
are we just starting again... 

So love is big bigger than us 
But love is not what you're thinking of 
It's what lovers deal it's what lovers steal 
You know i've found it hard to recieve 
Cause you my love I could never believe
