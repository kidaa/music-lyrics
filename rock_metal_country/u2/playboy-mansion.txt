If Coke is a mystery, Michael Jackson History 
If beauty is truth, and surgery the fountain of youth 
What am I to do 
Have I got the gift to get me through 
The gates of that Mansion 

If OJ is more than a drink, a Big Mac bigger than you think 
If perfume is an Obsession, then talk shows confession 
What have we got to lose 
I'll never push my way through 
The gates of that mansion 

I never bought a Lotto ticket 
I never parked in anyone's space 
And the banks feel like cathedrals because casinos took their place 
Luck, come on down 
I wake up, she'll come around 

Sex is a kind of religion 
We're down for playin' hard luck 
I never did see that movie, and I never did read that book 
Luck, come on down, let my numbers come around 

Don't know if I can hold on 
Don't know if I'm that strong 
Don't know if I can wait that long 
Til the colors come flashing and the lights go on 

Then will there be no time for sorrow 
Then will there be no time for shame 
And though I can't say why 
I know I've got to believe 

We'll go diving in their pool 
It's who you know that gets you through 
The gates in the Playboy Mansion 
The Playboy Mansion 
In the Playboy Mansion 
Then will there be no time for sorrow 
Then will there be no time for shame
