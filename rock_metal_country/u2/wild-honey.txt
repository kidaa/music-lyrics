In the days
When we were swinging form the trees
I was a monkey
Stealing honey from a swarm of bees

I could taste
I could taste you even then
And I would chase you down the wind

You can go there if you please
Wild honey
And if you go then go with me
Wild honey

Did I know you
Did I know you even then
Before the clocks began time
Before the world was made

From the cruel sun
You were sheltered
You were my shelter and my shade

If you go there with me
Wild honey
You can do just what you please
Wild honey

Yeah, just blowing in the breeze
Wild honey
Wild, wild, wild

I'm still standing
I'm still standing where you left me
Are you still growing wild
With everything tame around you

I send you flowers
Could flowers thaw you heart
I know your garden is full
But is there sweetness at all

What is soul
Love me
Give me soul

If you go then go with me
Wild honey
Won't you take me, take me please
Wild honey

Yeah, swinging through the trees
Wild honey
Wild, wild, wild
