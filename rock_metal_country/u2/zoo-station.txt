I'm ready
I'm ready for the laughing gas
I'm ready
I'm ready for what's next
I'm ready to duck
I'm ready to dive
I'm ready to say
I'm glad to be alive
I'm ready
I'm ready for the push

The cool of the night
The warmth of the breeze
I'll be crawling 'round
On my hands and knees

Just down the line...Zoo Station
Gotta make it on time...Zoo Station

I'm ready
I'm ready for the gridlock
I'm ready...to take it to the street
I'm ready for the shuffle
Ready for the deal
Ready to let go of the steering wheel
I'm ready
Ready for the crush

She's just down the line...Zoo Station
Got to make it on time...Zoo Station

Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, It's alright
Hey baby, hey baby, hey baby, hey baby
It's alright, it's alright

Alright, you can turn it up

Time is a train
Makes the future the past
Leaves you standing in the station
Your face pressed up against the glass

I'm just down the line from your love...Zoo Station
You know I'm under the sign...Zoo Station
I've gotta make it on time
Make it on time...Zoo Station
That's alright...Zoo Station
Just two stops down the line...Zoo Station
Just a stop down the line...
