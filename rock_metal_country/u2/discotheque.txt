you want to be the song 
the song that you hear in your head 

LOVE

'cause it's all that you can find

DO YOU FEEL LOVED 

take these hands they're good for nothing 
you know this hands have never worked a day 
take these boots they're going nowhere 
you know these boots they don't want to stray 
you got my head filled with songs 
you got my shoelaces undone 
take my shirt go on take it off me 
you can tear it up 
if you can tie me down 

DO YOU FEEL LOVED DO YOU FEEL LOVED 

take the colours of my imagination 
take the scent hanging in the air 
take this tangle of a coversation 
and turn it into your own prayer 
with my fingers as you want them 
with my nails in your side 
with my teeth at your back 
and my tongue to tell you the sweetest lies 

DO YOU FEEL LOVED DO YOU FEEL LOVED 

love's a bully pushing shoving 
in the belly of a woman 
heavy rhythm taking over 
to stick together 
a man and a woman 
stick together 
man and woman 
stick together ... 

DO YOU FEEL LOVED 
DO YOU FEEL LOVED 

and it looks like the sun 
but it feels like the rain 
and there's heat in the sun 
to see us through the rain
