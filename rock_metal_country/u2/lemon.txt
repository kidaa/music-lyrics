Lemon 
See through in the sunlight 
She wore lemon 
But never in the daylight 
She's gonna make you cry 
She's gonna make you whisper and moan 
And when you're dry 
She draws her water from the stone 

And I feel 
Like I'm slowly, slowly, slowly slipping under 
And I feel 
Like I'm holding onto nothing 

She wore lemon 
To colour in the cold grey night 
She had heaven 
And she held on so tight 

A man makes a picture 
A moving picture 
Through the light projected 
He can see himself up close 
A man captures colour 
A man likes to stare 
He turns his money into light to look for her 

And I feel 
Like I'm drifting, drifting, drifting from the shore 
And I feel 
Like I'm swimming out to her 

Midnight is where the day begins 
Midnight is where the day begins 
Midnight is where the day begins 

Lemon 
See through in the sunlight 

A man builds a city 
With banks and cathedrals 
A man melts the sand so he can 
See the world outside You're gonna meet her there 
A man makes a car She's your destination 
And builds roads to run them on You gotta get to her 
A man dreams of leaving She's imagination 
But he always stays behind 

And these are the days 
When our work has come assunder 
And these are the days 
When we look for something other 

Midnight is where the day begins 
[Repeat 4 times] 

[Instrumental] 

Midnight is where the day begins 
[Repeat 4 times] 

A man makes a picture 
A moving picture 
Through the light projected 
He can see himself up close You're gonna meet her there 
A man captures colour She's your destination 
A man likes to stare There's no sleeping there 
He turns his money into light She's imagination 
To look for her Lemon 
She is the dreamer 
She's imagination She had heaven 
Through the light projected 
He can see himself up close She wore lemon
