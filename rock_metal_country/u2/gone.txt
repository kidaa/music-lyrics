You get to feel so guilty got so much for so little 
Then you find that feeling just won't go away 
You're holding on to every little thing so tightly 
Till there's nothing left for you anyway 

GOODBYE YOU CAN KEEP THIS SUIT OF LIGHTS 
I'LL BE UP WITH THE SUN 
AND NOT COMING DOWN... I'M NOT COMING DOWN 
IM NOT COMING DOWN 

You wanted to get somewhere so badly 
You had to loose yourself along the way 
You change a name but that's okay... it's necessary 
And what you leave behind you don't miss anyway 

GOODBYE YOU CAN KEEP THIS SUIT OF LIGHTS 
I'LL BE UP WITH THE SUN 
AND NOT COMING DOWN... I'M NOT COMING DOWN 
I'M NOT COMING DOWN 

AND I'M ALREADY GONE 
Felt that way all along 
Closer to you every day 
Didn't want it that much anyway 

You're taking steps that make you feel dizzy 
Then you get to like the way it feels 
You hurt yourself you hurt your lover 

Then you discover... 
What you thought was freedom is just greed 
Goodbye... no emotional goodnight 
I'll be up with the sun 
Are you still holding on 
I'm not coming down 
I'm not coming down
