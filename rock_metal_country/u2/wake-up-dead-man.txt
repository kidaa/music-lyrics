Jesus, Jesus help me 
I'm alone in this world 
And a fucked up world it is too 
Tell me, tell me the story 
The one about eternity 
And the way it's all gonna be 
WAKE UP WAKE UP DEAD MAN 
WAKE UP WAKE UP DEAD MAN 

Jesus, I'm waiting here boss 
I know you're looking out for us 
But maybe your hands aren't free 
Your Father, He made the world in seven 
He's in charge of Heaven 
Will you put in a word for me 
WAKE UP WAKE UP DEAD MAN 
WAKE UP WAKE UP DEAD MAN 

Listen to your words they'll tell you what to do 
Listen over the rhythm that's confusing you 
Listen to the reed in the saxophone 
Listen over the hum in the radio 
Listen over sounds of blades in rotation 
Listen through the traffic and circulation 
Listen as hope and peace try to rhyme 
Listen over marching bands playing out their time 
WAKE UP WAKE UP DEAD MAN 
WAKE UP WAKE UP DEAD MAN 

Jesus, were you just around the corner 
Did you think to try and warn her 
Or are you working on something new 
If there's an order in all of this disorder 
Is it like a tape recorder 
Can we rewind it just once more 
WAKE UP WAKE UP DEAD MAN 
WAKE UP WAKE UP DEAD MAN
