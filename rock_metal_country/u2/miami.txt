Weather 'round here choppin' and changin' 
Surgery in the air 
Print shirts and southern accents 
Cigars and big hair 
We got the wheels and petrol is cheap 
Only went there for a week 
Got the sun got the sand 
Got the batteries in the handycam... 

Her eyes all swimming pool blue 
Dumb bells on a diving board 
Baby's always attracted to the things she's afraid of 
Big girl with the sweet tooth 
Watches the skinny girl in the photo shoot 
Freshmen squeaky clean 
She tastes of chlorine 
MIAMI MY MAMMY 

Love the movies... love to walk those movie sets 
Get to shoot someone in the foot 
Get to smoke some cigarettes 
No big deal we know the score 
Just back from the video store 
Got the car and the car chase 
What's he got inside the case 
I want a close up of that face 
Here comes the car chase 

MIAMI MY MAMMY 
MIAMI 

I bought two new suits... miami 
PINK AND BLUE.. MIAMI 
I took a picture of you... miami 
Getting hot in a photo booth... miami 
I said you looked like a madonna 
You said... maybe... said I want to have your baby... BABY 
WE COULD MAKE something beautiful 
Something that wouldn't be a problem 
At least not in... miami 

Some places are like your auntie 
But there's no place like 
MIAMI MY MAMMY
