She feels the ground is giving way 
Bur she thinks we're better off that way 
The more you take the less you feel 
The less you know the more you believe 
The more you have the more it takes today" 

YOU GOT TO GIVE IT AWAY 
YOU GOT TO GIVE IT AWAY 
YOU GOT TO GIVE IT AWAY 
SHE DOESN'T CARE WHAT IT'S WORTH 
SHE'S LIVING LIKE IT'S THE LAST NIGHT ON EARTH 

She's not waiting on a saviour to come 
She's at a bus-stop with the NEWS OF THE WORLD 
And the sun sun here it comes 
She's not waiting for anyone 

YOU GOT TO GIVE IT AWAY 
YOU GOT TO GIVE IT AWAY 
YOU GOT TO GIVE IT AWAY 
she knows just what it's worth 
SHE'S LIVING LIKE IT'S THE LAST NIGHT ON EARTH 

Slipping away... slip slide... 
The clock tells her that time is slipping... 
The world turns and we get dizzy 
Minute hands and second sticking... 
Slipping away 
There's something going on she might be missing 
the world turns and we get dizzy 
Is it spinning for you the way it's spinning for me

She's living living next week now 
You know she's going to pay it back somehow 
The future is here at last 
The past is too uncomfortable 

YOU GOT TO GIVE IT AWAY 
YOU GOT TO GIVE IT AWAY 
YOU GOT TO GIVE IT AWAY 
SHE ALREADY KNOWS IT HURTS 
SHE'S LIVING LIKE IT'S THE LAST NIGHT ON EARTH 
LAST NIGHT ON EARTH 
LAST NIGHT ON EARTH
