lookin' for to save my soul 
lookin' in the places where no flowers grow 
lookin' for to fill that GOD shaped hole 

mother mother sucking rock and roll 
been around the back... been around the front 

holy dunc, spacejunk comin' in for the splash 
white dpoes on punk staring into the flash 
lookin' for baby Jesus under the trash 

mother mother suckin' rock and roll 
mother [scat singing] rock and roll 

mother am i still your son, you know i've waited for so long to hear you say so 
mother you left and made me someone 
now i'm still a child but no one tells me no 

lookin' for a sound that's gonna drown out the world 
lookin' for the father of my two little girls 
got the swing got the sway got my straw in lemonade 
still looking for the face I had before the world was made 

mother mother sucking rock and roll 
bubble poppin' sugar droppin' rock and roll 
[scat singing]

woo me sister 
move me brother 
soothe me mother 
rule me father 
show me mother 
days passin 
around each other
