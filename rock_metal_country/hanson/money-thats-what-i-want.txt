The best things in life are free
So give them to the birds and the bees 

I need money that's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want 

Your lovin gives me such a thrill
But your lovin can't pay my bills 

I need money that's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want 

[Bridge]

Oh money that's what I want
Oh lots of money that's what I want
Oh money that's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want
A whole lot of money

Money can't buy everything, it's true
But what it can but I can use

I need money that's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want 

[repeat first verse]

That's what I want
A whole lot of money
