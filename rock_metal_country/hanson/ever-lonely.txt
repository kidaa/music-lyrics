[chorus:]

Well if you're ever lonely you can call on me
and I'll be here for you all you've got to do is call
said I'm always waiting here for you all you've got to do
is keep on trying till your call gets through 

And for so many years I have been your friend
we've been through everything time and time again
but I want you to know that I still believe in you
all you've got to do is keep on trying till your call get's through 

[chorus]

you got to keep trying even though the road gets hard
you got to keep going on even though he broke your heart
and if you ever need a friend I will be here for you
all you've got to do is keep on trying till your call gets through 

[chorus]
