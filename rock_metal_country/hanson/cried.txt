You promised not to say a word 
You promised you would keep it quiet 
But you and I both knew it 
It was written all over your face 
So I cried.. ohyah.... 
The day you said goodbye 
So I cried.. 
The day that our love died 
The day you said goodbye....... died..... 
We had a love I thought could last 
I guess I was thinking four leaf clovers 
But you wished we were over 
Now I've lost three and I only got one 
So I cried.. ohyah.... 
The day you said goodbye.. ohyah.... 
So I cried.. 
You cried..... I cried.. 
The day you said goodbye....... yah ..... 
Let's not even bother be talking about 
It doesn't really matter to you 
So get it on....... baby 
Get it on....... baby.... ohhow 
A secret's something that you keep 
And a heart is something you hold on to 
But you play by your own rules 
And one day it will blow up in your face 
So you cry... ohyah.... 
The day he says goodbye 
The day that your love died 
You cried..... ohhh 
The day he says goodbye 
So you cry... ohyah.... 
The day he says goodbye 
You cried.... 
The day that your love died 
The day he says goodbye, goodbye, goodbye 
So you cry... ohhhoow.... 
The day he says goodbye 
So you cry... ohhhoow.... 
The day he says goodbye 
So I cry... ohhhoow.... 
The day he says 
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, 
goodbye, goodbye,goodbye,goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye 
Heres to you............. goodbye
