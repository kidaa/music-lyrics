This time I won't take it back 
'Cause something's coming to you 
This time I'm going to breathe a breath 
Walking on down the road 

I can never promise that you'll never be lonely 
But as long as we're together it can always only be 

Misery 

Last night I got off the fence 
'Cause I won't be the fool 
On this side the grass is greener than 
The garden that I used to grow 
I'm walking on down the road 

I can never promise that you'll never be lonely 
But as long as we're together it can always only be 

Misery 

Misery, Misery 

I can never promise that you'll never be lonely 
But as long as we're together it can always only be
