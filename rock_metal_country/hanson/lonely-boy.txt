He's looking in the spring,
looking for another lonely heart,
Trying to find the missing part.
It's flown and the wind starts blowin'
It's going inside his heart, he's all alone.
And his heart is gone.

Chorus:

Is there no one who could love a lonely boy?
And at the end of the day,
There is no one to hold his hand.


Is there no one who could love a lonely boy?
And at the end of the day,
There is no one to understand. End of chorus.

He's looking in the spring,
looking for another start.
Trying to find the switch,
And turn on the light in the dark.
He found the answer, that you can prevail.
Through the darkest nights, coldest winters,
Through the fires of hell.

Chorus...

Is there someone who could love a lonely boy?
Love me, hold me, is there no one?
Is there no one? Is there no one?

Chorus twice

Is there no one who could love a lonely boy?
Whose heart is gone. Is there no one?
