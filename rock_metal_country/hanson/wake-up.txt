Wake up, 
Tell me it's all right, 
Wake up, 
Cause I just wanna hold you tight, 
Wake up, 
Tell me it's all right, 
Oh yeah, 

It doesn't matter you got all that you need, 
It doesn't matter you got everything you see, 
It doesn't matter you got anything you please, 
But you don't have me, 

IIt doesn't matter you got all that you need, 
It doesn't matter you take everything you see, 
It doesn't matter you got anything you please, 
But you don't have me, 

Why, do you close your eyes so tight, 
When you're kissing him goodnight, 
Do you make believe a face, 
Just to try to fill the space, 

Wake up,

Cause you don't have me, 
No, you don't have me, 

I wish it mattered all the words that I say, 
It doesn't matter she's got all that she makes, 
Are you looking forward to the lonely hours ahead, 
Cause you don't have me, 

Will it matter when you're on your own, 
Will it matter when you're all alone, 
Will it matter when you stop and smell the breeze, 
And you don't have me, 

Why, do you close your eyes so tight, 
When you're kissing him goodnight, 
Do you make believe a face, 
Just to try to fill the space, 

Wake up,
