I. Hanson/T. Hanson/Z. Hanson

If I'm gone when you wake up, please don't cry.
And if I'm gone when you wake up,
Please don't sigh...
Don't look back at this time
As a time of heartbreak and distress.
Remember me, remember me.
'Cause I'll be with you in your dreams.

Oh, if I'm gone when you wake up, please don't cry.
And if I'm gone when you wake up, please don't sigh.
Don't look back at this time
As a time of heartbreak and distress.
Remember me, remember me.
'Cause I'll be with you in your dreams.

Oh, don't cry, I'm with you.
Don't sigh, I'm by your side.
Don't cry, I'm with you.
Don't sigh, I'm by your side.

And though my flesh is gone, oh, oh,
I will still be with you at all times.
And though my body's gone, oh, oh,
I'll be there to comfort you at all times.
Oh, oh, at all times. Whoa oh, oh

Chorus...

I don't want you to cry and weep. Oh, oh.
I want you to go on living your life.
I'm not sleeping an endless sleep. Oh, oh.
It's in your heart you'll have all of the good times.
Oh, all of the good times, Oh, oh..... have.

Chorus...

Oh, with you in your dreams......
