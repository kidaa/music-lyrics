Everybody wonders and some people know 
I guess that I'm some people 'cause baby it shows 
When will you do it? And why will you go? 
If you've already decided then deliver the blow 
The way you walk around me. The way you talk around me. 
You act so speechless. You've got nothing to say. 
The way you walk around me. The way you're talking to me. 
Makes me wonder. If this was only play. 
And I wonder will you still love me? 
Do you still love me, like you did before. 
Said come on baby you think I'm so blind 
I see what you're doing behind my back all the time 
I get suspicious when you call me someone else's name 
You think I don't notice that nothing's the same...anymore 

Repeat Chorus 

And I wonder will you still love me? 
Did you ever love me, or were you playing with me before 
Ohh baby you think I'm so blind 
Ohh baby I'm not playing around this time 

Repeat Chorus 

And I wonder will you still love me? 
Did you ever love me, or are you showing me the door 
Ohh baby you think I'm so blind 
Ohh baby I'm not playing around this time
