Let me weep and talk about who we are,
Seems we don't know anymore, 
And all this time that we been thinking, 
At night I've been dreaming about you
And I know you don't believe me when I say...

Chorus:

I'll love you till the end of forever and a day
And I guess we'll never know never know
Exactly where this river's gonna flow,
And I guess we'll never understand, ooh,
Until we reach that promised land.

So I guess we'll, I guess we'll,
Never know, ooh, never know, never know

People say that we're sweethearts,
There's enough in this world to tear us apart
Well I don't know about what this thing we're
Going through, a serenade or do.

Chorus....

Never know
Guess we'll never know, ooh...

A Capella:

I guess we'll never know, know, know, know,
Exactly, where this river's gonna flow and I guess
We'll never understand,
Until we reach that promised land,
So I guess we'll, I guess we'll never know, yeah...
Said, I guess we'll never know,
Oh yeah, exactly where this river's gonna flow,
And I guess we'll never understand, understand
Until we reach that promised land,
So I guess we'll, I guess we'll never know, yeah,
oooohh
