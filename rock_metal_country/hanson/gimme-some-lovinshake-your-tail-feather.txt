Well, my temperature's risin'
Got my feet on the floor
Got twenty people rockin' singin' 'more more more'
Come on, pretty baby, I don't know what you've got
But you'd better take it easy

So glad you made it
Won't you come on
Gimme some lovin'
Gimme some lovin'
Gimme some lovin'
Gimme some lovin'
Gimme some lovin' every day

'Cause the place is on fire
Come on, pretty baby, I don't know what you've got
But you'd better take it easy

So glad you made it
So glad you made it

Gimme some lovin'
Gimme some lovin'
Gimme some lovin'
Gimme some lovin'
Gimme some lovin' every day
