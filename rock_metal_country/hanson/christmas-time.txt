Everything's different
But nothing has changed
Are we going in circles
It's Christmas again
Can't you hear the sleigh bells ring
All our voices unite
And look up to the heavens
See the stars shining bright

Everybody needs a little lovin'
Around Christmas time
Somehow you got to know you're
going to be all right
Do you really remember how it used to be
Sitting under the christmas tree
In your heart you'll
Find the season

We've been blessed by the children
Black, yellow, and white
They believe in things
We try to deny
So throw down your weapons
But continue the fight
And let's love one another
On this holy night

Everybody needs a little lovin'
Around Christmas time
Somehow you got to know you're
going to be all right
Do you really remember how it used to be
Sitting under the christmas tree
In your heart you'll
Find the season

O reach down inside you heart
And see all the love
O in your heart you'll
Find the reason

Everybody needs a little lovin'
Around Christmas time
Somehow you got to know you're
going to be all right
Do you really remember how it used to be
Sitting under the christmas tree
In your heart you'll
Find the season
