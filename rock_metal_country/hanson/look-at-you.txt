Look at you baby 
Standing in the shadows wondering what I'm doing here 
Wishing something would happen, maybe I could disappear 
She walks in with that look in her eye 
Somehow she doesn't even have to try 
Just kick off your shoes, get on the floor 
This is what we came here for 
Oooooh, you've got to break it down 
You've got to get it out 
Just get on the floor 
Everybody wonders when they look at you 
Everybody wonders what you're gonna do 
You got it all wrapped up you do 
Everybody wonders when they look at, look at you 
Look at you baby, look at you baby 
In the middle of the dance floor lights shinin' in my face 
Twistin', shoutin' there was no doubt people dancing all over the place 
Out of the corner of my eye she said why don't you come and give it a try 
Get on the floor, just kick off your shoes 
You ain't got a thing to lose 
Oooooh, you've got to break it down 
It's time to get it out 
Just get on the floor 

Repeat Chorus 

Look at you, look at you baby 
Look at you, look at you baby 
Look at you, look at you baby 
Ooooh, Whoooooa, Whoooooa, baby 
Look at you, look at you baby 
Look at you, look at you baby 
Look at you, look at you baby 
Ooooh, Whoooooa, Whoooooa, baby 
I was standing in the shadows wondering what I'm doing here 
Wishin' something would happen so that I could disappear 
She breaks the silence with a move of her hips 
You better hang on don't want to lose your grip 
Kick off your shoes, get on the floor 
This is what we're waiting for 
Oooooh, you've got to break it down 
You've got to get it out. Just get on the floor.
