Well I just can't seem to pity 
'Cause my heart's to numb to feel 
And the smile does all the talking 
Though the pain is all that's real 
With the way that you keep screaming 
I can hardly hear to think 
And I feel the bridges burning 
Underneath my feet 

Where do you go, Oooh 
When you're gone 
Where do you go, Oooh 
When you're gone 
Oh, how the road feels so long 
But where do you go Ooh 
When you're gone 

I just want to stay dreaming 
No I just don't want to wake 
Why can't we keep on sailing 
Across this emerald lake 
My forehead is still bleeding 
From the thorns I used to wear 
And I'm left alone and beaten 
For this cross I choose to bear 

Where do you go, Oooh 
When you're gone 
Where do you go, Oooh 
When you're gone 
Oh, how the road feels so long 
But where do you go Ooh 
When you're gone 

Well I finally found what I'm looking for 
Though the road's still long and the light is still far 
But I finally found what I'm looking for 
Well I finally found what I'm looking for 
Though the road's still long and the light is still far 
But I finally found what I'm looking for 

Well the voices fall like timber 
And the fear it pours like rain 
And my heart is crushed to cinders 
Underneath this kind of pain 
Well there is no resolution 
When the revolution's dead 
So I'm left with no solution 
For the voices in my head 

Where do you go, Oooh 
When you're gone 
Where do you go, Oooh 
When you're gone 
Oh, how the road feels so long 
But where do you go, Ooh 
When you're gone
