Well I woke up this morning 
And the night had been so long 
Seems that I had had my mind on you 
Well the day, it has begun, and I can't get a minute, 
can't get a minute without you 
You're always on my mind, you're always in my head 
And I can't live, I can't live another day without you 
'Cause when the minutes seem like hours and the hours seem like days 
Then a week goes by you know it takes my breath away 
All the minutes in the world could never take your place 
There's one-thousand-four-hundred-forty hours in my day 
I've been trying to call you all day, 'cause I got so many things 
that I want to say 
I'm going crazy, 'cause all my thoughts are filled with you 
There's got to be some way I can get through to you ohh 

Repeat Chorus 

I can't keep myself from thinking about you 
It's because I love you, and I know that it's true, whoooa 
I'll call it desperation, can't you see it in my eyes? 
That I want be with you until the sun falls from the sky 

Repeat Chorus
