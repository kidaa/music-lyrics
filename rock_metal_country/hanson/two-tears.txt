Chorus:

I'm sorry if I made you cry.
I'm sorry if tears fell from your eyes.
I'm sorry if I hurt you,
But that was not at all what I intended to do. End of chorus.

But just remember,
For every tear that falls from your eyes,
Two tears fall from mine,
Two tears fall from mine,

I never wanted to hurt you baby,
I never wanted those tears to fall,
I never wanted to make you cry,
I guess I should have taken a little more time.......

Chorus...

But just remember,
For every tear that falls from your eyes,
Two tears fall from mine, 
For every tear that you cry,
Two tears fall from mine,
For every tear that you cry,
Two tears fall from mine
