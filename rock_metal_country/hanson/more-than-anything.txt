I love you more than anything,
Than anything, I do.
And I'd give anything and everything
I have just to be with you.

These feelings I hold inside are emotions,
I can not hide.
These feelings will not be some sign.
I'd give anything when I look into your eyes,
I see something special about you,
And when I hold your hand,
You seem to understand that.......

I love you more than anything,
Than anything, I do.

And I'd give anything and everything
I have just to be with you.

When I think of life without you,
It brings me right down to my knees, YEAH!
Cause I can't have your life, without you,
Your my strength that keeps me holding on.

I love you more than anything,
Than anything, I do. 
And I'd give anything and everything
I have just to be with you.

Oh, I'd do things that can't be done.
I'd fly to the moon and around the sun, oohh,
You're just saying that I would do all,
I'd do anything, anything, well, well

I love you more than anything,
Than anything, I do. 
And I'd give anything and everything
I have just to be with you.
I'd give anything, you know I'd do anything for you.
I love you more than anything, more than anything!
