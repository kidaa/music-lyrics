Well I heard you crying
Somebody stole my soul.
How could I be dying?
I turned 25, days ago. 

bridge
We're all
On the ground,
Crying out.
Somebody save me please.
I won't sit aorund just thinking about,
The troubles that tommorrow brings
Yeah

chorus
I'm dying to be alive, yeah.

Lets not go through our lives.
I'm just dying to be alive.
Yeah. 

The people you've touched,
The way you've touched them
I hope they've touched you too.

'Cause in this life,
It's hard to tell.
What is false and what is true.

We're all
On the ground,
Just crying out.
Somebody save me please.

The troubles that tommorrow brings

Not trying to just survive, yeah.
Lets not go through our lives.

And we all come,
Tumbling down.
No matter how strong,
We all return to the ground
Another day gone,
A day closer to fate.
Soon we'll find it's
A little too late.
Too late.

The things you see,
The way you see them.
Will never been seen again
To go through life,
Livin' on luck.
Betting ten thousand to ten.
Yeah
Mistakes I've made
In this life.
Can't even see why I win.
But the thing that's strange is
You only live once.
And never look back again.

Not trying to just survive, yeah.
Lets not go through our lives.
I'm just dying to be alive.
Yeah.

And we all come,
Tumbling down.
No matter how strong,
We all turn to the ground.
When the day's gone,
Say  why did i wait? 
Can't just leave your
Life to fate.
Gotta turn it 'round
Before it's too late.
