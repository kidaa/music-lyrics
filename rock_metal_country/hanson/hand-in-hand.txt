Yeah.

say goodbye 

Well I know
Just how much I love you
There is no time
To explain.
I realize
Just what I'd give to.
To get you back.
In my arms. 

BridgeAnd I,
I see you hand in hand.
With another man.
And I, 
Don't know. 
What you see in him.
And why you let us go. 

Chorus
And if you're gonna lie,
Atleast you could,
Just let us die.
And if you're gonna cry,
To me baby
Atleast you could of,
Just say goodbye. 

And I'm caught between.
Myself and me.
And I,
Can't find the bridge
From my mind to reality.
I'm trying to find.
A place in the sun.
But I'm drowning in the rain 
That's falling every place I run

And I,
I see you hand in hand.
With another man.
And I, 
Don't know. 
What you see in him.
And why you let us go.

chorus 

And if you're gonna lie,
Well atleast you could of,
Just let us die.
And if you're gonna cry
To me baby
Atleast you could,
Just say goodbye. 

Well I'm not gonna sit around,
Just waitin' for you
To to get over him.
So I said
No No No.. 

Say goodbye
Say goodbye now
Say goodbye
Say goodbye now
Say goodbye
Say goodbye now
Say goodbye now

And if you're gonna lie,
Well atleast you could,
Of let us die.
And if you're gone,
Don't cry to be baby.
Atleast you could,
Just said goodbye. 

Say goodbye
Say goodbye now

Oh yeah. 

Won't you say goodbye
Won't you say goodbye now
