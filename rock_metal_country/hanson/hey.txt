Hey, you like boots and perfume 
Hey, your red pumps and your Cadillac blues 
Hey, you want that fine white wine on my dime 

What you want from me 
'Cause you're on my mind 
Don't you care no more 
That you're losing yourself 
Don't you want some truth 
'Cause I'll give you mine 

Hey, when I'm making my movie, baby 
You keep saying all my lines 
Hey, after Sunset Drive cruising, baby 
You're just yesterday's prize 

Hey, do do do do do 
You want trips on a white yacht for two 
Hey, you want Beverly Heights 
Bright lights, late nights 

What you want from me 
'Cause your on my mind 
Don't you care no more 
That you're losing yourself 
Don't you want some truth 
'Cause I'll give you mine 

Hey, when I'm making my movie, baby 
You keep saying all my lines 
Hey, after Sunset Drive cruising, baby 
You're just yesterday's prize 
You're just yesterday's prize 

Your red pumps and your Cadillac blues 
You want trips on a white yacht for two 
Your red pumps and your Cadillac blues 
You like boots and expensive perfume 
Your red pumps and your Cadillac blues 
You want trips on a white yacht for two 
Your red pumps and your Cadillac blues 
You like boots and expensive perfume 
Your red pumps and your Cadillac blues 
You want trips on a white yacht for two 

Hey, when I'm making my movie, baby 
You keep saying all my lines 
Hey, after Sunset Drive cruising, baby 
You're just yesterday's prize
