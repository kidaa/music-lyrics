Have you ever stood outside a picket fence
You could see through but you can't get to the inside
I sit there and wait
I look at you and anticipate
What we could be and what we could do

Chorus:

Fly the wings of an eagle
Glide along with the wind
No matter how high
I'll be thinking of you the whole time
Fly the wings of an eagle
Glide along with the wind
No matter how high
I'll be thinking of you the whole time. End of chorus.

I'm carrying this heavy load 
I don't know what to do
The only thing I know is that
I'm in love with you
Fly with the wings of an eagle
No matter how high 
I'll be thinkin' of you

Fly the wings of an eagle
Glide along with the wind
No matter how high
I'll be thinking of you the whole time
Fly the wings of an eagle
Glide along with the wind
No matter how high
I'll be thinking of you the whole time

Chorus....
