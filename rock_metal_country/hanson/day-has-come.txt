Well the day has come to where
I've thought of no-one
Quite as much as I think of you
As the days go by I never wonder why
I just know it's true
Well the day has come
Well the day has come

Well I never would have thought that I
Could love someone like I love you
And I never would have thought
That anyone could love me like you do

The day has come and still I never
Ask myself why I love you
As the days go by it seems that I
Love you more than I did the day before

Well the day has come
Well the day has come
