Waking up this morning 
Thinking this can't be real 
But they say there is nothing love can't heal 
Why don't you come on down 
So you can feel what I feel 

Sitting all alone in this place 
Even though we're here face to face 
There is nothing gone 
But there's something wrong 

Can't you see that I'm stuck here underneath 
And you're making it hard to breathe 
So take a look around and tell me what you see 
You'll find me underneath 

I know what to say but don't know where to begin 
The fear of losing you beneath my skin 
Is there resolution for this pain that I'm in 

Sitting all alone in this place 
Even though we're here face to face 
There is nothing gone 
But there's something wrong 

Can't you see that I'm stuck here underneath 
And you're making it hard to breathe 
So take a look around and tell me what you see 
You'll find me underneath 

If only you could feel what I dream 
Maybe you could hear what I mean 
There is nothing gone 
But there's something missing 

Can't you see that I'm stuck here underneath 
And you're making it hard to breathe 
So take a look around and tell me what you see 
You'll find me underneath 

Cause I'm stuck here underneath 
And you're making it hard to breathe 
So take a look around and tell me what you see 
You'll find me underneath
