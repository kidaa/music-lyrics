Loving you
Like I never have before.
And needing you.
Just to open up that door.
And begging you.
Might somehow turn the tides.
And tell me to
I've gotta get his off my mind. 

I never thought I'd be speaking these words,
I never thought I'd need to say.
Another day alone is more than I can take. 

chorus
Won't you save me?
Savin's what I need.
I just want to be,
By your side.
Won't you save me?
I don't wanna be.
Just drifting through this sea
Of life. 

Want to.
Listen please.
Baby, don't walk out that door.
I'm on my knees.
You're all i'm living for. 

I never thought I'd be speaking these words,
Never thought I'd find a way.
Another day alone is more than I can take. 

Won't you save me?
Savin's is what I need.
I just want to be,
By your side.
Won't you save me?
I don't wanna be.
Just drifting through this sea
Of life. 

Suddenly the sky is falling
Could it be it's too late for me?
And if I never said I'm sorry.
Well i'm wrong, yes I'm wrong.
Baby now you hear my spirit calling.
Wondering if she's longing for me?
And then I know
That I can't live without her. 

Won't you save me?
Savin's what I need.
I just want to be,
By your side.
Won't you save me?
I don't wanna be.
Just drifting through this sea
Of life. 

Won't you save me?
Savin's what I need.
I just want to be,
By your side.
Won't you save me?
I don't wanna be.
Just drifting through this sea
Of life. 

Won't you save me?
Won't you save me?
Won't you save me?
