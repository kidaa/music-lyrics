I've seen pictures,
Well, I saw you just the other day.
And I couldn't help but look your way.
You've got this special look,
That has got me completely hooked.

Chorus:

Pictures on the wall, pictures everywhere,
Pictures on the wall, everywhere I stare,
Pictures on the wall,
On the ceiling and on the floor. End Of Chorus

I'm in a metal room and I can not find the door.
Will this feeling ever go away?
Or will this feeling stay?
Will this feeling ever go away?
Because I can't live the rest of my life this way.

Chorus...

I see your face in the clouds in the sky,
I see your face before my eyes,
I see your face before everywhere,
And I don't know what to do.

Chorus...

Pictures
