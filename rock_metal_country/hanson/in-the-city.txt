I see you walking out that door
and you know you can hide no more

If I asked you now, I know you wouldn't give it up

[Bridge]
If I asked you how,you'd give that look to kill
Oh it gives you a chill
But Ohhhhh it gives me a thrill to say

[Chorus]
Do you love, do you love me, do you love me, little pretty
Can you tell me,can you tell me
What's going on In The City

Sittin there tryin to look so sweet
Every word you say is full of decit

[Bridge]
If I asked you how,you'd give that look to kill
Oh it gives you a chill
But Ohhhhh it gives me a thrill to say

Do you love, do you love me, do you love me, little pretty
Can you tell me,can you tell me
What's going on In The City

I'am gonna ask you once again
Gotta tell me once again, do you love me [3x]

Do you love me,do you love me

[guitar solo]

Do you love, do you love me, do you love me, little pretty
Can you tell me,can you tell me
What's going on In The City

Do you love, do you love me, do you love me, little pretty
Can you tell me,can you tell me
What's going on In The City

Do you love, do you love me, do you love me, little pretty
Can you tell me,can you tell me
What's going on In The City

Do you love, do you love me, do you love me, little pretty
Can you tell me,can you tell me
What's going on In The City

I'am gonna ask
You once again, you gotta tell me once again, do you love me
