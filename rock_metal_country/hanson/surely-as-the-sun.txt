As surely as the sun rises each day,
So my love, will never change,
And though the years, may come and go
My love will only grow and grow
Sometimes I wonder what you see in me
'Cause I'm only a man flawed in so many ways you see
I want to share
Every moment of the day with you,
And I want to share every sunset and every sunset
And every moonlit night

Oh...As surely as the sun
Yeah, yeah, sometimes I wonder what you see in me
'Cause I'm only a man
Flawed in so many ways you see

Everyday when the sun comes out
Surely as the sun
Surely as the sun
