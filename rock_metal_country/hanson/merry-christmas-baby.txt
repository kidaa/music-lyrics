Merry Christmas baby

Merry Christmas baby
Sure did treat me nice
Merry Christmas baby
Sure did treat me nice

Bought me diamond rings for Christmas
I feel like I'm in paradise
Be at my side
I got music on my radio
Feel my vibe
I got music on my radio

I feel like I'm going to kiss you underneath the Mistletoe
Santa's coming down the chimney, half past three
All those pretty presents for my baby and for me

Merry Christmas baby
Sure did treat me nice
Treat me so nice
Bought me pretty presents
I feel like I'm in paradise

Merry Christmas girl
Merry Chrismas baby
Merry Chrismas baby
Sure did treat me nice
You know you do
Merry Christmas baby
Sure did treat me nice
I got a lot of pretty presents
I feel like I'm in paradise

Merry Christmas baby
Merry Christmas baby
I feel like I'm in paradise
