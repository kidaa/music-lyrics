She moves like a tender kiss 
And I can't stop feeling 
She soothes with her tenderness 
And I can't stop feeling 
I even don't even know her name 
But I can't stop feeling 
She says that she feels the same 
And I can't stop feeling 
And if you let me try to tonight 
You just might see that I'm 

Falling deeper and deeper and deeper in love 
And I'm feeling more and more and more and more and more alone 

She turns chaos into art 
And I can't stop feeling 
A touch and I fall apart 
And I can't stop feeling 
I'm sounding like an old clich 
And I can't stop feeling 
I love her in a thousand ways 
And I can't stop feeling 
But if you let me try tonight you just might see that I'm 

Falling deeper and deeper and deeper in love 
And I'm feeling more and more and more and more and more alone 

Every simple notion is poetry in motion 
Can't you see it's pushing me over the edge 
This wrecking ball you're holding 
Could crush the heart you've stolen 
I give you my devotion all over again 
And if you let me try tonight you just might see that I'm 

Falling deeper and deeper and deeper in love 
And I'm feelin' more and more and more and more and more alone
