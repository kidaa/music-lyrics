When we were young stories were told 
That I would kiss you sweet like 
People said there was a connection between us 
Oh 
Now that we're older stories are told 
Of how I hold you tight 
Whenever I see those people 
I tell them were right 

Stories will be told 
From when our children are young 
Until they're old 
Oh 
About our endless love 
We must have been a blessing from above 

Stories will be told, oh 
Until we're old 
Stories will be told 
Until the end of time 
Stories will be told 
Until we're old 
Stories will be told 
Until the end of time 

Until the sun won't rise, oh 
Let me tell you mine, oh 
Let me tell you mine 

It all started on 77th Street 
When we were just thirteen 
I had no cares at all 
Until I saw you from the corner of my eye 
It changed my views 
It changed my whole life 

Stories will be told 
From when our children are young 
Until they're old 
Oh 
About our endless love 
We must have been a blessing from above 

Stories will be told 
From when our children are young 
Until they're old 
Oh 
About our endless love 
We must have been a blessing from above
