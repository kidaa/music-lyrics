The wind it blows,
Through the trees.
Claiming those,
Innocent leaves.
And the thunder rolls
These crashing seas
Like a tender kiss,
Holds it's heart
In me. 

chorus
In this life long,
Love song.
You can love right
You can love wrong.
In this love song,
You can love long
But if you love wrong,
It doesn't mean love's gone. 

Mary was a young girl
With a young girl's heart.
Well, all I can remember
Is I loved her from the start
I was her's forever
She was mine too.
Something's wrong,
'Cause now she's gone.
Tell me what did I do? 

In this life long,
Love song.
You can love right
You can love wrong.
In this love song,
You can love long
And if you love wrong,
It doesn't mean love's gone. 

Whoa.
It doesn't mean love's wrong
Just because you're feelin' low.
And it doesn't mean loves gone.
'Cause you feel that you want to
Let go.
Well noone wrote in this book of love
That you always known.
I wish someone would of told me before. 

Talk about love.
A million times it seems
The words come out our lips,
like we forgot what it means
And we said we'd be together
'Til death do us part
But we said those words,
With only half our hearts. 

In this life long,
Love song.
You can love right
You can love wrong.
In this love song,
You can love long
And if you love wrong,
It doesn't mean love's gone. 

I wish someone would of told me before.
I wish someone would of told me before 

I wish someone would of told me before.
I wish someone would of told me before 

I wish someone would of told me before.
I wish someone would of told me before
