Candles burning
Lots of mistletoe
Lots of snow and ice
Everywhere we go
Choir singing carols
Right outside my door

CHORUS

All these things and more
That's what Christmas means to me my love
Christmas means to me my love
Christmas means to me my love
Christmas means to me my love
Christmas means to me my love

I see your smiling face
Like I've never seen before
Though I love you madly
It seems I love you more
The little though you give me
Will touch my heart for sure

CHORUS

I feel like running wild
Those angels a little shy
I caught you underneath the mistletoe
I kiss you twice and then some more
I wish you merry Christmas baby
And a happy new year

Let's deck the halls with holly
Singing Silent Night
Fill the dreams with angels' hair
Pretty, pretty lights
Go to sleep and wake up
Just before daylight

CHORUS

Christmas means to me my love
Christmas means to me my love
Christmas means to me my love
Christmas means to me my love
Christmas means to me my love
Christmas means to me my love
Christmas means to me my love...
