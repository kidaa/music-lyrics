The sun has fallen'
Another day gone
Without you.
My heart keeps callin'
And I don't know just what to do ooh
When you're near me.
I seem to forget my lonely days.
It's more than a feelin'
It's something that can't be explained

chorus
I wish that I was there.
I wish that I was there.
When you're not here.
I wish that I was there. 

I wish that I was there.
I wish that I was there.
When you're not here.
I wish that I was there. 

You were fallin'
Now I'm coming round again.
I was callin'
Cause without you it's the end 

I just wanna see you a little more.
I just wanna dream of some more.
I just wanna see you a little more.
I just wanna be with you some more. 

I wish that I was there.
I wish that I was there.
When you're not here.
I'm wishin' that I was there. 

And you make me feel
Won't you take me 
When you're not here.
It's been raining here.
And I just want you
To be near. 
I just wanna dream of some more.
I just wanna see you a little more.
I just wanna be with you some more. 

I wish that I was there.
I wish that I was there.
When you're not here.
I wish that I was there. 

I wish that I was there.
I wish that I was there.
When you're not here.
I'm wishin' that I was there. 

I wish that I was there.
and you make me feel
I wish that I was there.
When you're not here.
Won't you take me when you're not here.
I wish that I was there.
I wish that I was there.
It's been raining here.
I wish that I was there.
When you're not here.
And I just want you to be near.
I'm wishin' that I was there. 

I wish that I was there.
I wish that I was there.
When you're not here.
I wish that I was there.
