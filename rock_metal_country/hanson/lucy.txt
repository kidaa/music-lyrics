The day that I left Lucy 
A tear fell from her eye 
Now I don't have nobody, and I was such a fool 
On the day that I left Lucy. 
The day that I left Lucy she cried, then said goodbye 
Now it's done, and it's over, and I am all alone 
On the day that I left Lucy 
Now I don't have anymore songs to sing 
'Cause you were everything, everything to me 
I didn't realize I felt this way, until that day 
Today I'm missing Lucy, and you say that she's OK, I hope she is. 
Now I don't have nobody and no one will ever replace... 
My Lucy 
I love Lucy, Lucy... 
On the day that I left Lucy...my Lucy
