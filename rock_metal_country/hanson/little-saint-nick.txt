Oooooooo 
Merry Christmas Saint Nick 
Well way up north where the air gets cold 
There's a tale about Christmas 
That you've all been told 
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red 
And he spends all year workin' out on his sled 
He's a little Saint Nick 
Little Saint Nick 
He's a little Saint Nick 
Little Saint Nick 
Just a little bobsled we call it old Saint Nick 
But she'll walk a toboggan with a four speed stick 
She's candy apple red with a ski for a wheel 
And when Santa hits gives gas man just watch her peel 
He's the little Saint Nick 
Little Saint Nick 
He's the little Saint Nick 
Little Saint Nick 
Run run reindeer 
Run run reindeer 
Run run reindeer 
Run run reindeer 
He don't miss no one 
when he's haulin' through the snow at a frightening speed 
With a half a dozen deer with Rudy to lead 
He's got to wear shades cause the snow really flies 
and he's cruisin' every path with a little surprise 
He's the little Saint Nick 
Little Saint Nick 
He's the little Saint Nick 
Little Saint Nick 
Oooooooo
