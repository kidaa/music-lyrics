Gauntlets
Town one by one
See how
They run
And when the check doesn't clear
And it's time to pay the bill
Some are gonna ride it out
Some can't and they never will
'Cause it's a great big world calling you to take a ride
And it's a great big world singing come and see and come inside
Oh yeah a great big world reminding you you're not alone
So hold on this great big world we only get to rent we never get to own
Inches fill a yard stick
Feet slowly walk a mile
Make one move then another
And then you try to live a while
Keep your head and you might make it
But that ain't no guarantee
'Cause it take debt and obligation
To fly around so free
And it's a great big world calling you to take a ride
And it's a great big world singing come and see and come inside
Oh yeah a great big world reminding you you're not alone
So hold on this great big world we only get to rent we never get to own
Whatcha gonna do first
And where will you make your mark
How are you going to get there
And can you find a place to park
Seasons coming slowly
But still they always come
And then it feels like just a second
And then suddenly you're done
And it's a great big world reminding you you're not alone
And it's a great big world we only get to rent we never get to own
'Cause it's a great big world calling you to take a ride
And it's a great big world singing come and see and come inside
Oh yeah a great big world reminding you you're not alone
So hold on this great big world we only get to rent we never get to own
