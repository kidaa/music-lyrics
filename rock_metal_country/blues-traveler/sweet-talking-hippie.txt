Music & Lyrics: Chan Kinchla, Bob Sheehan, Brendan Hill & John Popper
Sweet talking hippie
Cross your killing floor
Gonna come a little closer
Cause you know I want more
Don't run off
Don't you be afraid of me
You know you are what you made you baby
I am what I try to be
You know I need your love
And I could use your money
And if you ain't got a dime
We'll sell tickets, honey
You know we need each other, baby
Like a diamond and a ring
Now settle back, woman
And watch me do my thing
Just a little bit closer, it's all right
A little bit closer, closer now, closer now, closer now
Closer now, closer now, it's all right,it's all right
";Come into my apartment";
Said the spider to the fly
Why would you wanna stick that thing in my heart?
Huh, oh well, good-bye.
Sweet talking hippie
Cross your killing floor
Gonna come a little closer
Cause you know I want more
That's all I am, that's all I am
You know that's all I am, that's all I am
I'm alone
I'm alone
Thank you.
