Lyrics: John Popper
Hail to you my mountain climber busy at your task
I know you're in a hurry but there's something I must ask
Do you ever get lonely climbing up so high
If you don't want to answer me I can understand why
If I told you a secret, would you want to know more
I've got a challenge I hope you won't ignore
Conquer me figure me out and set me free
I've got a hundred million things to show you as many more to see
But only if you conquer me
Sometimes I get this precious view and the grand scheme shows its face
When all is in harmony it can be such a lonely place 
The melody is sad and sweet, and the dance I do is fun
Yes I love this precious view but I'm staring at the sun
For as pretty the picture, I share this view alone
Will anyone stoop to grasp this gauntlet I have thrown
Conquer me figure me out and set me free
I've got a hundred million things to show you as many more to see
But only if you conquer me
Hail to all you mountain climbers all you dreamers on the run
I'm your self appointed solicitor but now I speak to only one
Whoever she is now, and whoever she'll become
I'd like to ask her to hurry please and if she's walking could she run
It's not my impatience though perhaps just there I lied
It's just I'm feeling invincible and it has me terrified
Conquer me figure me out and set me free
Conquer me figure me out and set me free
