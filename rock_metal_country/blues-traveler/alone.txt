Music & Lyrics: John Popper
I said ";I love you";
She began to cry
She said she needed a friend
I said ";I'll try";
Soon we'd say nothing
Somehow I never wondered why
You see, she left me
She left me
I'm alone
I'm alone
I'm alone
I'm alone
I'd loved her always
She didn't know
I tried patience
Let a friendship grow
I tried to keep her
That's what made her go
You see, she left me
She left me
I'm alone
I'm alone
I'm alone
I'm alone
Beauty and the beast
Was how it seemed to be
A love like hers
Ain't meant for guys like me
Some call me crazy
Some politely call me free
But either way you see
You see, she left me
She left me
I'm alone
I'm alone
I'm alone
I'm alone
I'm trying to forget you but it just won't work
Think I'm losing my mind, think I'm going berserk
I love you with a passion that you just don't know
And I kinda wish right now that I was telling you so
I could rant, or rave, or play some little game
But when I look into your eyes, it all seems the same
That you weren't meant for me and that's a sad but true fact
Now I don't care how I look and don't care how I act
Cuz you set me free
I'm a man among men
But when I think of what I missed it starts all again
Now alone in the darkness of each new day
My heart is on its own
I wanna rip it from my chest and throw it away
Watch this bassman take me home
I guess some day
Love will soon be here
And maybe then
I'll see things more clear
I guess I got excited
Cause it felt so near
And
You see, she left me
She left me
I'm alone
I'm alone
I'm alone
I'm alone
But I know I'd give my life
Just to hold her now
And who knows
I might see her around
Hopes can always go up
Tears can only come down
You see, she left me
She left me
I'm alone
I'm alone
I'm alone
I'm alone
