Lyrics: John Popper
I can feel your pity
I can feel your pain
And they're never going to bother you again
Well I don't know how
And I ain't sure why
But I promise you I'm really gonna try
Believe me
I hate tribulation
Don't want no trial
I can conquer with my state of denial
And I want to save you
So I guess I can
When I grow up I'll be a faith healing man
Believe me
When all is said and done
We've already won
When all is said and done
We've already won
You feel like you're part of the plan
When you want to be a faith healing man
Believe me
When all is said and done
We've already won
When all is said and done
We've already won
