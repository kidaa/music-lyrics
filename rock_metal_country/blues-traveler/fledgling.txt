Music & Lyrics: John Popper
Raise your head
Meagerest of fledglings
And breathe in deep
And cease to cry
For life it beats within you
To fix upon the sky
And fix upon...
The sky
Is beckoning your coming
Your feathered nest
Has grown too small
The wind
Is here to greet you
Spread your wings and simply fall
Spread your wings and simply fall
Spread your wings
Spread your wings and simply...
Fall 
Into the rushing air
And struggle
And fight to rise above
And then surrender
To your freedoms
For these are the pains of love
And these are the many pains of love
And many, many are the pains of ...love
That frightening fall has become a friend
With gravity now do you play
Inches from death and the frozen ground
And then away
The clouds separate to reveal the warmth
Of the goldenest bright shining sea
Nigh falls and it's gone again
But now you're free
To give it chase
And to...
Soar through heaven
Mightiest of eagles
And rule your minions
Of the sky
The earth
Is far below you
Once it s prisoner now do you fly
Once just a fledgling now
Do you fly
Now my fledgling now my fledgling do you
Fly...free
