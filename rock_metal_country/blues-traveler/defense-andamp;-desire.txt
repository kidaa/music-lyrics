Lyrics: John Popper
Step in from the rain
It's the nightingales on 2nd Avenue and I can't complain
It's a busy night
The regulars know me but all the same they decide I'm alright
Whiskey hit me fast
Don't mess with that stranger over there he'll do the same & you both may last
No I won't regret
The air is thick and wet
With defense & desire
Little girl what you doing here
Don't mess with that vampire in the corner who beckons you near
Are you waiting for the band to play
It's too loud in here for words but those staring eyes have much to say
If you meet those eyes in fun
Could be trouble for you if you don't back up what you've begun
No I won't regret
The air is thick and wet
With defense & desire
Gonna run the show someday
Gonna buy this bar and everything in it and run it all my way
Talk to you about it till dawn
Tell you all my plans and twisted dreams until the blow is gone
By providence I'm sent
Into this unsuspecting tavern to build and feed on your discontent
No I won't regret
The air is thick and wet
With defense & desire
