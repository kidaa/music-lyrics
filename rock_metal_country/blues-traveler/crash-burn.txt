Lyrics: John Popper
I'm gonna ride you
Gonna ride you out like a witch on a broom
I'm gonna ride you
Gonna ride you out like a witch on a broom
It's the old give and take
And I've been took again
So give me room
I'm gonna watch you
Gonna watch you fall like a tower of cards
I'm gonna watch you
Gonna watch you fall like a tower of cards
Gonna land gonna land gonna land gonna land
No matter how hard
Crash
Burn
When will I learn
Crash
Burn
When will I learn
Crash
Burn
When will I learn
Crash
Burn
When will I learn
