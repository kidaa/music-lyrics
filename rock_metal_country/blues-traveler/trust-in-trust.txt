Lyrics: John Popper
Set your sights on my corner of time
I hear truth but I just speak the rhyme
Fear knows no one if he hasn't met me
I got to know him well and only now do I see
You can run where you wanna run when you wanna hide
You feel like you are driving but you just took a ride
The truth shall set you free is what I hear them say
And to my sweet surprise it does work out that way
Blame yourself, blame the way you were raised
And if you need to blame, you could blame your own rage
Or you could trust yourself and trust others too
And trust your trust in trust and then they'll trust you
You can run where you wanna run when you wanna hide
You feel like you are driving but you just took a ride
The truth shall set you free is what I hear them say
And to my sweet surprise it does work out that way
A radical concept I know I'm laying down
But try it just once and take one more look around
I spoke not in haste till I said to my fear
";One of us must go, and look, I'm still here";
You can run where you wanna run when you wanna hide
You feel like you are driving but you just took a ride
The truth shall set you free is what I hear them say
And to my sweet surprise it does work out that way
And to my sweet surprise it does work out that way
And to my sweet surprise
