Music & Lyrics: John Popper
When people think of holidays
They think of cold weather
";Let's spend this frozen wonderland together";
Not me, I'm into warmer days
Don't wanna hear bout your winter wonderland
I am into
I'm into warmer days
Well, frozen fingers, frozen toes
Topped with a frozen stare
Numb your heart, and you numb your mind
Pretend that you don't care
Not me, I'm into warmer days
Don't wanna hear bout your winter wonderland
I am into
I'm into warmer days
Well say what you want about Santa Claus
Go on ahead, do your thing
And solace yourself in your righteous cause
While you're holding out for spring
Not me, I'm into warmer days
Don't wanna hear bout your winter wonderland
I am into
I'm into warmer days
When you were young, you walked to school
Uphill both ways in freezing rain
And when I'm frozen in solid ice
How dare I even complain
Not me, I'm into warmer days
Don't wanna hear bout your winter wonderland
I am into
I'm into warmer days
Don't wanna hear bout your winter wonderland
I am into
I'm into warmer days
