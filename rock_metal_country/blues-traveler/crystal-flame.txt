Music & Lyrics: Chan Kinchla & John Popper
Sitting in clover looking for the fifth leaf
Something soon will come my way
Never failing to amaze me
I feel its wisdom anyway
Rays of sweet illumination
Inspiration too untold
I hope some day I can befriend it
I think that comes with growing old
Crystal flame
I'll do anything you say
You're my heart and my mind and my soul
At least you fill them when I play
Light so bright it hypnotizes
But it never hurts to gaze
Never to burn or char with fire
Simply the heat from warmer days
And when the moment tends to savor
When the song is close at hand
That frozen ember fills my vision
Letting the brightness take command... take command
Crystal flame
I'll do anything you say
You're my heart and my mind and my soul
At least you fill them when I play
Please, please won't you take me away
It's easy, easy just let me play
Please, please won't you take me away
It's easy, easy just let me play
Sometimes its brilliance all around me
Sometimes its light I barely see
And though I utilize its grandeur
It does not belong to me
Cause all I can do is vague description
As I do my best to share
The smooth perfection I can only dream of
The flow of all the life that's there
Life that's there
Crystal flame
I'll do anything you say
You're my heart and my mind and my soul
At least you fill them when I play
Keep me safe and never lonely
Let the rain fall where it may
And let me find the peace within me
I can find it when I play
They say that solid wet or vapor
The only forms that are portrayed
To them I ask one burning question
Of what stuff are ideas made
Are they made?
Crystal flame
I'll do anything you say
You're my heart and my mind and my soul
At least you fill them when I play
Sitting in clover looking for the fifth leaf
Something soon will come my way
