Music & Lyrics: John Popper & Bob Sheehan
Just think about what you and I have been through
And tell me why I should not be afraid
I said don't want to hear about the promises they told us
I don't wanna hear about the progress that they made
Slow change
Don't mean nothing to me
Well fear not, cause my fear soon turns to anger
As I watch my world get ruined by a pristine hand
And I'm out here, saying Excuse me like a stranger
Cause I never did learn how to say Isn't this grand
Slow change
Don't mean nothing to me
Black cat
Squashed flat...pretty gory
Came to play
Swept away...no big story
We shall overcome is what they tell us
But the sun goes down and dawns just too many times
That's all right, don't worry, in God do we trust
Besides, you went and got yours, so I guess I'll just go get mine
Slow change
Don't mean nothing to me
Slow change
Don't mean nothing to me
Slow change
Don't mean nothing to me
