Lyrics: John Popper
Picture a spinning toy laden with adventure
Coupled with the things I've told
And a dream can be as one 
I have my moments now and again
I said I have my moments now and again
Started in a dream
Wound him up on a baseball team
Took it on the road
A B-17 with a hefty load
Full of cargo and of spice
Yeah a pirate ship who craves advice
From the likes of Peter Pan
You know I hear he's wanted by the law again
Picture a spinning toy laden with adventure
Coupled with the things I've told
And a dream can be as one 
I have my moments now and again
I said I have my moments now and again
Now the tiger's got his eye
What shall we do oh me oh my
Better hide your daughters
Yeah, we're in shark infested waters
But the children can't be harmed
Yeah, they are on to you and heavily armed
With a leaf and a kazoo
How can they be of use to you?
Take me take me for a ride
On the biffest largest vehicle you can ever
Possibly imagine
Get the keys let's go 
Drive
Gonna ride off in the sunrise
Gotta win our Nobel Prize
Gee, I wonder what we'll say
Do our homework on the way
Gonna meet the King of France
Tell him, ";Je n'ai pas de pantelons";
Give his cigar a light
Then slip away unnoticed into the night
Picture a spinning toy laden with adventure
Coupled with the things I've told
And a dream can be as one 
I have my moments now and again
I said I have my moments now and again
I said I have my moments now and again
