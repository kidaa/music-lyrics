Original Performer: John Lennon
Imagine there's no heaven - it's easy if you try
No hell below us, above us, only sky
Imagine all the people, living for today
Imagine there's no country - I wonder if you do?
Nothing to kill or die for; no religion, too
Imagine all the people, living life in peace, you-hoo
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope that you will join us
And the world would live as one
Imagine no possessions - I wonder if you can?
Nothing to keep only from greed or hunger - a brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people, sharing all the world, you-hoo
You may say that I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope that you will join us
And the world would live as one
