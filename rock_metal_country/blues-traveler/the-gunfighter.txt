Lyrics: John Popper
I'm taken aback
But still I let it ride
No sudden movements
I ease my hand real slow
Then my hands are like lightning
And the bullets start to fly
I was almost in the clear too
With just inches left to go
And if it's the fool who likes to rush in
And if it's the angel who never does try
And if it's me who will lose or win
Then I'll make my best guess and I won't care why
C'mon and get me you twist of fate
I'm standing right here Mr. Destiny
If you want to talk well then I'll relate
If you don't so what cause you don't scare me
Time comes when I'm older
And a new kid hits the street
They'll say he's fast and he looks for me
And he says I'm going down
And though I try to avoid this man
Eventually we'll meet
He draws faster than I can see and knocks me to the ground
And if it's the fool who likes to rush in
And if it's the angel who never does try
And if it's me who will lose or win
Then I'll make my best guess and I won't care why
C'mon and get me you twist of fate
I'm standing right here Mr. Destiny
If you want to talk well then I'll relate
If you don't so what cause you don't scare me
So I'm lying in the street there
And the lights are getting dim
Preacher man comes and tells me
Repent it's time to pray
You only have to lose once
But you never always win
I smile at him with my last words
And this is what I'll say
Well if it's the fool who likes to rush in
And if it's the angel who never does try
And if it's me who will lose or win
Then I'll make my best guess and I won't care why
C'mon and get me you twist of fate
I'm standing right here Mr. Destiny
If you want to talk well then I'll relate
If you don't so what cause you don't scare me
C'mon and get me you twist of fate
I'm standing right here Mr. Destiny
If you want to talk well then I'll relate
If you don't so what cause you don't scare me
