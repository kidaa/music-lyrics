Lyrics: John Popper
Well here I am
In a roadside stew
You're checking to see if I'm alright
I'm looking up at you
Well I'm o.k.
I've been here before
You know I have an ass to land on and that's what it's for
I'm gonna dust me off
Get on my feet
Get myself together
Get me good to eat
Well what a night
I don't remember much
Not to worry my friend
I'm better off as such
Well what a day and what's for breakfast?
Have to see what comes along
What a day and what's for breakfast?
Nothing ventured nothing wrong
Well what a day and what's for breakfast?
Have to see what comes along
What a day and what's for breakfast?
Nothing ventured nothing wrong
