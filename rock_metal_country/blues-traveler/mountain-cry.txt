Music & Lyrics: Brendan Hill
I met my girl on a mountain side
Looking for warmth and a place to hide
She took me in as the day grew long
As we lay by the fire our love grew strong
I left the city for its dirt and grime
The factory wails to make mountain time
I found love, but she slipped away
Now I'm alone, but here I'll stay
I keep on looking till this very day
For my girl who's gone away
I'll search this land till the day I die
A sweet loving woman, make a mountain cry
