Lyrics: S. Samaroo and John Popper
I just couldn't cry
No matter how hard I try
I knew the love we shared was dead
Until she gave me a letter
With some words she wrote down
And I swear this is what she said
She said...
Love of my life our first night together
We sat in the rain and talked forever
Love of my life your carefree way
Showed me the potential of each and
every day
But love of my life
When you told me today
That my place was gone
In your carefree way
I realized...
She said...
She said love of my life now I finally see
A carefree way wasn't meant for me
The pain I feel you just can't understand
You'd think it as fire, pull away your hand
But love of my life
When you told me today
That my place was gone in your carefree 
way
I realized...
You know she realized she must learn for
once on her own not to let her days burn
Because she's alone
She needed to learn for once on her own
not to let her days burn
Because she's alone
She needed to learn for once on her own
not to let her days burn
Because she's alone
She said...
Love of my life your arms were never shy
To hold me tight when I needed to cry
Love of my life you made me believe
And for that I do love you but I know I
must leave
Because love of my life
When you told me today
That my place was gone
In your carefree way
I realized...
Oh yes she realized, and for once so did I
Because it occurred to me the love of my
life was she
And then and only then I started to cry
