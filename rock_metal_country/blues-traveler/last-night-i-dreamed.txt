Music & Lyrics: Chan Kinchla
It's the part of the dream that leaves me when the sunlight hits my eyes
It's the part of the dream that rolls me over and over as I sleep
It's the part of the dream that leaves me wanting for the darkness
It's the part of the dream I can't remember it at all
I dreamed about you last night
I dreamed about you last night
I dreamed about you last night
Last night I dreamed
Last night Last night
Something about a big jet plane moving fast off into the sunset
Maybe a mustang moving fast up to the sky
Mor like a great big boat drifting off to nowhere
I know that in the end you were waiting on the other side
I dreamed about you last night
I dreamed about you last night
I dreamed about you last night
Last night I dreamed
Last night Last night
I can feel the dream long before it makes my mind
I know the dream like the scent of the evening air
I need the dream to keep me safe until the morning
When I open my eyes you're there
I dreamed about you last night
I dreamed about you last night
I dreamed about you last night
Last night I dreamed
I dreamed about you last night
I dreamed about you last night
I dreamed about you last night
Last night I dreamed
