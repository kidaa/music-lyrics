Music & Lyrics: Chan Kinchla & John Popper
Gina, Gina
Don't you cry
Gina, Gina
Wonder why, I said wonder why
Gina, Gina
Dance all night
Gina, Gina
Feel all right
Gina, Gina
Can't you see
Gina, Gina
You're just free, I said you're just free
Well once upon a time
A long time ago
There was a rock'n'roll queen
We came to know
She kept on dancing
She'd dance till dawn
She'd dance till the people and the liquor were gone
She kept on dancing as the crowd grew large
When it came to grooving, you know, she was in charge
She still finds ways today to groove somehow
In fact she could be listening to this music right now
Gina, Gina
Don't you cry
Gina, Gina
Wonder why, I said wonder why
