Sweet talking hippie
Cross your killing floor, baby
Gonna come a little closer
Cause you know I want more, baby
Don't run off
Don't you be afraid of me
You know you are what you made you baby
I am what I try to be
You know I need your love
And I could use your money
And if you ain't got a dime
We'll sell tickets, honey
You know we need each other, baby
Like a diamond and a ring
Now settle back now, woman
And watch me do my thing
Just a little bit closer, it's all right
Just a little bit closer, it's all right
Just a little bit closer, just a little bit
Just a little bit, little bit, little bit, little bit, 
Little bit, little bit, little bit, little bit, 
Little bit, little bit,just the littlest bit, 
The littlest bit, littlest bit
Sweet talking hippie
Cross your killing floor, baby
Gonna come a little closer
Cause you know I want more, baby
That's all I am, I said that's all I am
I said that's all I am, that's all I am
Thank you.
