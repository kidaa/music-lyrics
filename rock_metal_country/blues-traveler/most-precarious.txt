Music & Lyrics: John Popper
Don't you give up don't allow disaster
Don't you give up don't you let her win
We're talking about a ";forever after";
Don't you give up don't you dare give in
Don't you give up don't you dare give in
Doesn't it seem most precarious
Doesn't it seem such a chance to take
Doesn't it seem most precarious
Why does it feel like a big mistake
Please understand and hear what I'm saying
The time is now and you don't have long
She could be oceans away tomorrow
So soon your chance will have come and gone
So soon your chance will have come and gone
Doesn't it seem most precarious
Doesn't it seem such a chance to take
Doesn't it seem most precarious
Why does it feel like a big mistake
The tight-wires strung and you're out in the middle
All eyes upon you no net below
Inches to go and you're almost home free
Feel the wires swaying to and fro
Feel the wires swaying to and fro
Doesn't it seem most precarious
Doesn't it seem such a chance to take
Doesn't it seem most precarious
Why does it feel like it would be a damn shame
Would be forever if it meant a day
How stoically I exclaim
As she turns from me and walks away
The light in her eyes explanation escapes you
Longing to please and not feel alone
And she doesn't know it but really she loves you
Some day so soon you're gonna make it home
Some day so soon you're gonna make it home
Doesn't it seem most precarious
Doesn't it seem such a chance to take
Doesn't it seem most precarious
Why does it feel like a big mistake
Doesn't it seem most precarious
Doesn't it seem such a chance to take
Doesn't it seem most precarious
Why does it feel like a big mistake
