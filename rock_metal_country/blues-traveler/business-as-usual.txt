Lyrics: John Popper
Sue him now and I'll tell you how
He's gonna milk like a cow
And if you want to fill a bucket
Simple as pie if you care to try
Just look him in the eye like you're high
And you want to die to cry
Fuck it
He's stuck it
Where it's ripe and I can pluck it
And it's a jewel
And it's cool
And hell I ain't no fool to school the rule
Business as usual
System never fails
Everybody's constitutional
Bargain back room sale
Bought and sold don't you catch a cold
It's going around I'm told
And it's survival of the healthy
Early to rise gonna win a prize
It's the other guys who realize
Their demises' size will fantasize
I'm stealthy I'll be wealthy
But they deny with a lie
As they try to sigh their sly good-bye
To like it or lump it
And if it's back is turned
The jump it so pump it out
Business as usual
System never fails
Everybody's constitutional
Bargain back room sale
Like it or lump it
And if it's back is turne
Then jump it or bump it or pump it
Have your tea and crumpet
On a stump it
Doesn't matter to me you see
If I can let it be then I'm free
In the sea of my destiny
And that's key for me
You know chi for me
And if rivalry is chivalry then c'est la vie
Or c'est la guerre
Let the buyer beware of the fare
And if you dare to bare the air to care
Then something is there
But if it's bought or leased
Let it be deceased
With the beast released
Then the palm is greased
And we can gather for the feast
Business as usual
System never fails
Everybody's constitutional
Bargain back room sale
Business as usual
System never fails
Everybody's constitutional
Bargain back room sale
