Somewhere there's a culprit lowin' 
Hard rain is gonna fall 
While old man Dillion laughs at our song 
Now I'm feelin' all alone 
And I'm cold and bare as stone 
But it just doesn't matter 
I can't stand it 
Gonna die alone 
Can't understand it anyhow 

Was a time I felt like dyin' 
Now I'm glad that time is gone 
Cuz tonight we're gonna live forever on 
And when I wrote this down 
I was drinkin' all alone 
But it just doesn't matter 
I can't stand it 
Gonna die alone 
Can't understand it anyhow 

Lookin' for a place I know 
Ain't been there for so long 
And I gotta back there 
I can't stand it 
Gonna die alone 
Can't understand it anyhow oh 

I can't stand it 
Gonna die alone 
Can't understand it anyhow oh
