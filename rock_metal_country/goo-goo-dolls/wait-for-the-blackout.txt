You ask me to come out 
When the sun does shine 
Gonna stay here with curtains drawn 
In darkness you'll be mine 

Let's wait for the blackout 
The lights are too bright 
Let's wait for the blackout 
Wait for the night 

Well welcome to my basement flat 
No windows to see through 
With darkness closing in, my friend 
We both know what to do 

Let's wait for the blackout 
The lights are too bright 
Let's wait for the blackout 
Wait for the night 

Let's wait for the blackout 
The lights are too bright 
Let's wait for the blackout 
Wait for the night 

Come with me, you always say 
To keep us both alive 
Now everything has lasted here 
Then I would survive 

Let's wait for the blackout 
The lights are too bright 
Let's wait for the blackout 
Wait for the night 

In darkness there is no sin 
Light only brings in fear 
There's nothing to corrupt the eyes 
There is no vision here 
At first you may find it strange 
But do not go away 
The darkness holds a power 
That you won't find in the day 

There is no vision here 
There is no vision here 
There is no vision here 
There is no vision here 
There is no vision here
