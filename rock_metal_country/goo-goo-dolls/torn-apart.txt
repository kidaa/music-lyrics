Well I went down to your house just the other day 
Only to discover you had gone astray 
Torn apart 
Torn apart 
Torn apart 
Torn apart 

Well I called you on the tele just the other day 
Only to discover you had gone astray 

Torn apart 
Torn apart 
Torn apart 
Torn apart 

Torn apart 
Torn apart 
Torn apart 
Torn apart 

Torn apart 
Torn apart 
Torn apart 
Torn apart
