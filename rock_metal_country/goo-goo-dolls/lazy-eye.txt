The world spins round in secret lives 
Everyone that needs to hide 
Cheap parade of endless lies 
Filters through this lazy eye 

And I don't believe in signs 
No I don't believe your lies 

Caught in the breakdown 
Caught in the breakdown 
Caught in the breakdown 
Caught in the breakdown 

Lose yourself in no one's life 
Trapped in all those empty lies 
Words like fists that tear you down 
Crash before they hit the ground 

And I don't believe in signs 
No I don't believe your lies 

Caught in the breakdown 
Caught in the breakdown 
Caught in the breakdown 
Caught in the breakdown 

No I don't believe in signs 
No I don't believe your lies 
No I don't believe your lies 

Caught in the breakdown 
Caught in the breakdown 
Caught in the breakdown 
Caught in the breakdown 

Caught in the breakdown 
Caught in the breakdown 

Breakdown

Caught in the breakdown 
Caught in the breakdown 
Caught in the breakdown...
