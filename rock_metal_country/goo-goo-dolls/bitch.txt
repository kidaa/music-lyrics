I'm feeling so tired can't understand it 
Just had a fortnights sleep 
I'm feeling strong, oh, so distracted 
Ain't touched a thing all week 

I'm feeling drunk, yes I am, juiced up 'n' sloppy 
Ain't touched a drink all night 
I'm feeling hungry, can't see the reason 
Just had a horse meat pie 

Yeah, when you call my name 
I salivate like a Pavlov dog 
Yeah, when you lay me out 
My heart is beating louder than a big bass drum 

You got to mix it child 
You got the fix, this must be love 
It's a bitch 

Yeah, you got to mix it child 
You got the fix, this must be love 
It's a bitch, alright 

Sometimes I'm sexy, move like a stud 
Kick with the girls all night 
Sometimes I'm so shy, got to be worked on 
Don't have no bark or bite 

Yeah, when you call my name 
I salivate like a Pavlov dog 
Yeah, when you lay me out 
My heart is pumping louder than a big bass drum, alright 

You know what I want, baby. 

I said, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey 'till end 

Wow Baby
