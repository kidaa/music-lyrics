All our time has come 
Here but now they're gone 
Seasons don't fear the reaper 
Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain we can be like they are 

Come on baby don't fear the reaper 
Baby take my hand don't fear the reaper 
We'll be able to fly don't fear the reaper 
Baby I'm your man 

All our time has gone 
Here but now it's gone 

Romeo and Juliet 
Are together in eternity Romeo and Juliet 
40,000 men and women everyday like Romeo and Juliet 
40,000 men and women everyday redefine happiness 
Another 40,000 coming everyday we can be like they are 

Come on baby don't fear the reaper 
Baby take my hand don't fear the reaper 
We'll be able to fly don't fear the reaper 
Baby I'm your man
