Are you listenin' now ?
Are you feelin' that way
Aren't you terrified?
Of wakin' up too tired to try again?

Are you happy now
That you've shut yourself down
Are you paralyzed
By all the nonsense that's gone down

I know you're gonna see these things some day

Sorry-eyed we spent so much of your time
Now I'm tryin' to put your riddle to a rhyme
Now it's up up up I'm headin for this evenin'
And it's up up up I'm headed for the clouds

Comin' down ain't the worst part
It only takes a second
To make a change that's gonna last

I hope you're gonna see these things some day
So don't stop lookin' for that light along the way

Sorry that we've spent so much of your time
Now I'm tryin' to put your riddle to a rhyme
Now it's up up up and headin' for this evenin'
And it's up up up I'm headed for the clouds
