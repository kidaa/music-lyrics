'Twas the night before Christmas 
And all through the house 
By the color TV 
Here asleep on the couch 

All cozy and warm 
With a dream for the light 
Inside it's safe 
On a cold Christmas night 

Do You believe in him? 
I don't know how long it's been 
Do you believe in him? 
All you got to do is let him in 
All you got to do is let him in 

'Twas the night before Christmas 
And out on the street 
Through the window the snow such a holiday treat 

Outside the trees and the cars in the back 
Are perfectly dressed for a wine when it's time 

Do You believe in him? 
I don't know how long it's been 
Do you believe in him? 
All you got to do is let him in 
All you got to do is let him in 

'Twas the night before Xmas 
A man sleeps alone 
Out in the cold cause he ain't got a home 

Give him a hand, give him a share 
Let's give him a smile 
Instead of a stare 

Do You believe in him? 
I don't know how long it's been 
Do you believe in him? 
All you got to do is let him in 
All you got to do is let him in
