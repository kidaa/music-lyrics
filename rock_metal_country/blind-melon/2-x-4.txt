I'm talkin' I'm talkin'
I'm talkin' to myself more

Needle, fetal
Someone's pouring warm gravy all over me
And you see that synthetic therapy
Don't you know it seems to be so unappealing
But, oh what a feeling

But I wish that you would stop spitting when you're talking to me

And inside, air dry
I might want to go another way
But you see now I'm too pale to get out
Into the lovely light of day
Oh, I'll do anything that you say
Oh, I'll do anything that you say

But I wish you would stop spitting when you're talking to me

I'm talkin' to myself more

1x1

Man to man
Stand to stand

2x4

Talkin' to myself
