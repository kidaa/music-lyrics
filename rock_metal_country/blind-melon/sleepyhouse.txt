No time frame, for what I need to do today
Here at the yellow house. I think I'm gonna play
With some free livin' lads down the street aways away

As I feel the moon rise
The time that all feels is the right time
Here in our sleepy house
As I wipe eye bugs away, the candle flickers at me to say
And in my head I sometimes pray

Hey aren't ya feeling fine
As I was as a little child
And I'm feeling better when I'm high
With a red light shinning on a little unity

The mistakes that I've made
No they don't seem to bother me
I sure as hell don't feel like
I missed any kind of train
If I could only show you how I feel
Then you wouldn't bother me
And then maybe you'd see why we don't mind being blind

As I was as a little child
And I'm feeling better when I'm high
With a red light shinning on a little unity
I'll probably be in a little while.
