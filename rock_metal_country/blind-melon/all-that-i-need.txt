All that I need is the air that I breathe
And all that I need are things I don't need
And all that really matters is what matters to me
And who of you are like me

If I was to smile and I held out my hand
If I opened it now would you not understand
Because you know if I'm to benefit I'll do everything that I can
And who of you are like me

It will make you feel good, over my shoulder
It'll get me down and got me tied up
'Till I grow older, but feel me inside of you
Like you want it to

But is it just the pains in your head
That are thrilling me
Another life's falling down onto it's knees
But I'll never smile the way, that I did like that day

Everything will be okay
It'll be okay
