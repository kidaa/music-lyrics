All I can say you know my life it's pretty plain
And all that I can do, is just pour some tea for two
And speak my point of view, but it's not sane
No it's not sane
It's not sane

And I don't understand why I sleep all God damn day
All that I do, is read a book to stay awake
It rips my life away
And it rips my life away
And it will rip your life away
