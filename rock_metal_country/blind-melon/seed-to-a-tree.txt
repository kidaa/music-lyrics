As I shit, I sit and wonder why
My floor is so cold and my back broken tired
But life is good, even though it won't be long
With a candle comes emotions that
Dance with the shadows on my wall

What were you thoughts, as they
Were flying through your mind
Compared to what you feel from
The bars your now behind

If they could speak, what do you think
They would say to you
I do believe you'd been better
Off if you'd just told the truth

Never had a problem till I stood face to face with me
And I wish there was a way for me to go inside so I could see
All the faces of the people who have torn a piece of me
As I grew from a seed to a tree

Can you feel the power of the eye
That's hidden away 5 feet from where we lie
What do you taste, when you take a drink of me
Is it to much for me to ask if I asked you to leave
Please just leave 'cause I want to be alone

There's a fine line between love and my feelings for you
High time I washed it all away
Unkind, I watch your future burn before you
Denied, a chance of any love in your life
And I ask you one time..Why

[Chorus]
