Come down from the ceiling
Oh, these pills were made for feeling
Oh, so divine

I've got a lump in my throat
So I'll keep hold of hope
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I've got a lump in my throat
And it makes it hard to swallow

That's why we'll crawl to walk for running
Oh there's not so much more in store
That's why we'll never, ever divide

I've got a lump in my throat
So, I'll keep hold of hope
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I've got a lump in my throat
And it makes it hard to swallow

Telling me winning is now or never
Seems like nobody really cares
Because they're just killing my time
They're just killing my time
Don't you know they're just killing my time
