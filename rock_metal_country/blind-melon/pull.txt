Pull you down now

Knees knelt, I got my arms open wide
I got the shades turned, so the colors die
No, don't hold too tight to the reel
Cause it's a big one boy
Its' gonna pull you down now
Pull you down now

No, the cook can't look
No, no cause he's keeping his eye on the kettle
In deed he will be around
When you or you or you feel the need to feel
Pull you down now

Well I live more than what you'll ever know
But I'll give you more than what I'll ever show
I live more than what you'll ever know
And I give you more that what I'll ever show

More than I'll ever show
