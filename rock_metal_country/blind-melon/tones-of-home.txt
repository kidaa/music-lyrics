What do you think they would say
If I stood up and I walked away
Nobody here really understand me
and so I'll wave goodbye I'm fine, I'm fine
Tones of home
said you don't like the way I'm living
you don't like me
Tones of home, tones of home
And so I'll wave goodbye.
I'm flyin' I'm flyin' home
And I always thought this would be
the land of milk and honey
Oh but I came to find out that it's
all hate and money
And there's a canopy of greed holding me down.

[Chorus]

See I'm so High to you, so I'll fade away
I said your on your own
Your Mom and Daddy said , that your
sister said, and your brothers saying
Everybody is saying Everybody, is
saying I, eye God I gotta go!
All my friends patronize me and
They say YO Hey Boy! Have you
found what your looking for.
It seems they don't really know me cause it's here 
and its what they can't see.

[Chorus]
