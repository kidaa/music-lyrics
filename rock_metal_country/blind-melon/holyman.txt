I was born on the banks off a hot muddy river
The child of one stupid steamy night
Born to roam beneath the sun
What do you think of me, I'm better left alone

I met a Holyman that said that he knew the way
And he'd like to show me so my life won't go astray
Take my hand child now little boy don't you be afraid
I'll take your soul and walk on water

Holyman, ya don't understand
The cuts on me they run much deeper
Holyman, you righteous man
I've been shown the way a thousand times
Not one a keeper
Older man he said I'll tell you boy
You've planted rotten seeds
And in a land of happiness
They'll grow us evil trees
Guided minds, and eyes that will never see
Holyman I'll tell you
Just what it is that I believe

Holyman I tell you man you gotta
Believe in what you see
Cause its you that corrupt us man and
Deep throat philosophy
I don't need your spells or the little
Games you try to pull on me
Come to think of it I don't need your religion

Gotta get away
I wish you would understand
Everybody prays
Let me find my own way
