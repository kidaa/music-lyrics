All alone the broadening skies
Under the every night I will lie
Scratching claw and grip the rails
Every day my living hell
Oh God you know I've tried
I know how hard I tried
and oh I tried......

Hey I'd like to daze away to a
Place like no one has known
In a state of mind I could call mine
That only I could own
Where I could hum a tune anytime
I choose, and then there is no such thing as time
Where I can feel no pain just calm and sane
What a place for one to find

Now you see I'm watching everything
I do and they're watching everything I say
Why wont they leave me be
Why am I even here I wonder
You leave me wondering

Won't you stop watching me
I said they're watching me, watching me, watching me

Now in my corner I got the ceiling in my eyes
Arms holding up my knees
And rocking back and forth's my life

I didn't mean to feel this way
When I walked into the door, Lord
Then they ripped away my memories
And I cant remember who I was before.

And I only wanted to be 16 and free.
