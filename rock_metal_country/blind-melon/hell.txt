I have no fingertips 
They were burned away from too many stove trips 
Can't find no fingernails 
I ate them off cause I was hungry as hell 
Can't read, can't clear my mind 
So here I go I've got to get into this lifetime 
I think I'm gonna build a fence 
To keep inside what little sense 
The sense of taste 
The sense of smell 
The sense to sit here and feel like hell 
To feel like hell 

The sun, the moon, the stars 
Is that what you're thinking that you are 
As I'll disintegrate over time 
If I expect my Body to try and keep up with my mind 
Today everything's mine 
Today everything's mine 
Today everything's mine
