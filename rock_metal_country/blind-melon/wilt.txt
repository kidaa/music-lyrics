Hair raising shake you're much too late
you should have jumped a couple of cars before
Now if I may I'll walk away
I'm selling Silly Putty door to door
And up on the shelf it seems to help
If I can keep a little bit of disease
As its feeding on me
You see it's bringing me to my knees

As we all wilt
Watching you wilt

Come right away and help me bathe away
the filthy feeling, frigid and cold
Biting my nails to the fairy tales
About the magic monkey's total control

See I got Indian Ken and his fleabag friends
With their buckets full of elephant ears
And he's breathing on me

His breath is bringing me to my knees

As we all wilt
Watching you wilt

Pea green the feeling
