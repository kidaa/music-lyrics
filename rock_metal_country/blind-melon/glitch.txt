Sitting' on the back of my time
Fishing' through the cities phone lines
Suddenly, Suddenly 'til my back's out of line
Who today will be knocked off
And who controls all the chalk talk
Will they let you see
And will you believe
May there be a charm in your shine
Lies about the big find
But shouldn't he, so deservingly
