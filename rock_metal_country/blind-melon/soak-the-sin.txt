I've got to buy some shoes
These ones are getting lose
My feet are shrinking in the 
Sun, and it ain't fun
But it looks like rain up ahead 
In forty miles.
A big rainbow took the blue sky.

I'm gonna tell my momma, I love 
Her so and thank you for 
Giving me these bones o gold
I'm gonna run from my home
Jump in the river and let the
Water soak the sin in my soul.

Fine time we all crossed lines
make the music that makes us 
Feel fine
Rednecks on sun decks hearing a 
Hillside Romeo say "Boys this is the 
Good shit, so come on all and eat 
A little bit."

And if I ever go back home I'm 
Gonna sell
And tell my momma, I love
Her so and thank you for 
Giving me these bones o gold
I'm gonna run from my home
Jump in the river and let the 
Water soak the sin in my soul.

Don't even say a word, it confuses me
What he says to do, is that we don't 
Have to
We don't have to.
