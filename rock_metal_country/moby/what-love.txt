Goin' down to see my girl, gonna see what I can find
I'm going down to see my love, gonna mean her in behind
I'm going down to see my girl, gonna come back everyday
I'm going down to see my girl, 'cause I've been too long away

 you know what I'm saying? 

What Love

'Cause I'm naked at home
You don't want to know
You've got to feel it
I couldn't know why
You don't want to know
Wanna let go...let go
And the ground is clear

What love x8

Where did that love go?
What love
Love it when you're here
God I love it when you're here
God I look as though he's over the line
Where did we go?
Way behind
We know
To color in the lines
You know
She didn't mean it
She didn't

What love x2

Yeah, how's everybody coming on?
You're a motherfucker
Take a look at yourself!
Who done
Oh yeah
Oh yeah on my right time
The right time
You don't know that time
Know that's mine
Blow my mind

See my love, gonna see what I can find
I'm going down to see my girl, gonna mean her in behind
I'm going down to see my love, gonna see her everyday
I'm going down, I'm going down, take me away

yeah

It's alright
