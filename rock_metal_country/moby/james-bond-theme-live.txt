this changes from show to show, but it's usually along these lines

Now let it lift you, oh!

one love will
one love will
one love can take you make you feel alive and whole

why give it up why tear it up

one love will
my love will
my love will make you feel alive enough to let go

oh
the death row
once again you feel like the brothers know
once again, back is the incredible
the rhyme animal
the unforgetable d
public enemy number one
five-oh said  freeze  and I got numb
can't I tell 'em that I really never had a gun
but the wax that the terminator x spun
now

so soft
so alive
my dear
so good
so close
so real

this love

whoa love!

wanna give it up
lets turn it loose
