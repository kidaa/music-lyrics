[sample:  give me summer ] x2

broken darkness my cold end
i look for places i've never seen
nothing moves but the quiet on the street
now I open my eyes to this
isolated walking long hard hours
winter cold just brings me winter showers
it's so brutal with the cold sky
wrapped in cold late at night

come clean, there's no sun yet
the only lights here are made
i can't speak, i can't hear, but i know i'm real
there's no warm here anyway
the darkest lights before the dawn
you remember the sun but it sank
in the water that eats the light
wrapped in cold, late at night

i open my eyes, it's cold
the only souls go by
lift the bridge out of the water
the stone black light
living is easy when it's night
the cold has covered the rain
i can see forever, to the deep
wrapped in cold, late at night
