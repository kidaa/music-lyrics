oh my baby, don't cry
oh my babe, just say goodbye
oh now baby, don't cry
oh my babe, at least we tried

at least we tried to make it
but in these days I'm so confused
oh my love, at least we had it
let me hold on to you

oh my baby, don't cry
oh my babe, just say goodbye
oh now baby, don't cry
oh my babe, at least we tried

at least we tried but we lost it
i will remember
how you stood there and you smiling
and you smile there with me

oh my baby, don't cry
oh my babe, just say goodbye
oh now baby, don't cry
oh my babe, at least we tried

oh my baby, don't cry
oh my babe, just say goodbye, say goodbye
oh now baby, don't cry
oh my babe, at least we tried, ohh
oh my baby, don't cry
oh my babe, just say goodbye
goodbye my baby, don't cry
oh my babe, at least we tried, whoa
