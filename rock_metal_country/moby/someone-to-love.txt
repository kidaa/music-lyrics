I was cold and wet
Like no-one else
It came in now, a professional
Oh, it's over
Oh, it's over
Oh, it's over now
Well I, fall in a sleep and I let go
Make me a being without a soul
Somebody live my life I've got to know what dead men know
Someone to love
Someone to love
Someone to love
Someone to love
I was on my knees
In front of her
When I feel like going down I know it's everywhere
Oh, it's over
Oh, it's over
Oh, it's over now
You make me another hell
I can't live but I'm no-one else
Somebody live my life I've got to know what dead men know
Someone to love
Someone to love
Someone to love
Someone to love
Like I said before
It's over again
And no-one left but me and
And no-one lifted me no
Someone to love
Someone to love
Someone to love
Someone to love
Someone to love
Someone to love
Someone to love
Someone to love
