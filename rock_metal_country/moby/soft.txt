I know what's in me
I know what goes on in me
Know it's time to stop
I alone for ever
I feel it soft
In my hands
So soft
So soft
And I can sit through the door
Watching mine
Watching the sign
I know it's soft
So soft
I know it's soft
So soft
Rough
Can you ever lay
What's all the blindness 
Watch someone bleed
I can't ever be found
I can never sleep
When your fucking nail
No when your fucking nail
I feel it soft
I feel it
Well I feel it
I feel it
I don't know what I don't connect
But I scream for the blood I've found
I can't see but I'm never going to leave
Walking you to me
Love baby love baby love make it ever soft
Love baby love me soft
It burns
It's soft but it hurts
It's soft
Now I play
In at night
Climb your sleep
For the rest of your
Feel it
I feel it
I feel it
I feel it
Well I feel it
I feel it
I feel it
I feel it
Well I feel it now
What sort of love
What sort of love
What sort of love
What sort of love
What sort of love
What sort of love
What sort of love
