wake up, face the future
cause I feel I have to salute you
on the things that's goin on, in this world today
you can run, but you can't hide
you have to find your sense of pride
to let you know, that this world, will never decay

It's later than it's ever been, time's up time's up
It's later than it's ever been, time's up time's up
It's later than it's ever been, time's up, in this world, today

brothers and sisters, grab a hold
there's a story solid as gold
we must try to stay alive
we must strive, and never slip away
where there's sunshine, there is rain
where there is joy there will be pain
we must move, m?--? move
we must move, and never decay

It's later than it's ever been, time's up time's up
It's later than it's ever been, time's up time's up
It's later than it's ever been, time's up, in this world, today

yo yo my brother my brother
let me lay it on the downstroke
I want you to know that I will provoke
anything that life will bring
because within these words I have a antidote
the time is comin' for the song that I'm hummin'
to let you know it's later than it's ever been
your time is up, you sad faced clown
now here's da breakdown da breakdown, da breakdown, da breakdown

[sung vocals]
It is later, than it's ever been
the life you livin', try not to sin
it is later, it is later, it is later, than it's ever been

keep on movin', and grab a hold
the life you livin', must have control
we can do it, we can do it, we can do it, if we try

It is later, than it's ever been
the life you livin', try not to sin
it is later, it is later, it is later, than it's ever been

keep on movin', and grab a hold
the life you livin', must have control
we can do it, we can do it, we can do it, if we try

[spoken style]
It's later than it's ever been, time's up time's up
It's later than it's ever been, time's up time's up
It's later than it's ever been, time's up, in this world, today
