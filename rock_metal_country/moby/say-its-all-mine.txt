Well I know it's over
Like a waste of mind
Well I know it's side ball
I can't seem to find
Like a waste of someone
Like a wasted home
Well I know it's over
I know it's over long
Did you ever slip inside my ozone
I saw it in my eyes
Ever slip into me baby?
And I know it's mine
I gotta say it's all mine
With so low
Well I know it's not mine
With so much
Well I say it's all mine
With so low
And I know it's not mine
Well it's solace baby
I saw the face of mine
You took my hand and held on
For the longest time
I was always looking to be the one for you
It could have been so perfect
If I still lied at you
And I want to scream inside you no-one
Did you ever look at me
I saw a place where I was open
Now it will die mine
I gotta say it's all mine
When no man
When I know it's not mine
With so much
When I'm faking the lies
With so low
I gotta say it's all mine
Gotta say it's all mine
Wanna say it's all mine
Gonna say it's all mine
It was so good
It was so good
It was so good
It was so good
It was so good
It was so good
It was so mine
I gotta say it's all mine
With so low
When I know it's not mine
It's over
And I can face it no lie
With so much
Well I know it's not mine
With so low
I know it's not mine
With so much
I gotta face it's a lie
With so low
I know it's not mine
With so far
I gotta place it's a lie
It was so good
So good
Say it's so good
Say it's so good
Say it's so good
Say it's so good
Say it's so good
