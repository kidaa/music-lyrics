see myself in the pouring home
see the light come over now
see myself in the pouring rain
i watch hope come over me

yeah, yeah
here we are now, going to the east side
i pick up my friends and we start to ride
ride all night, we ride all day
some may come and some may stay

here we are in the pouring home
i watch the light man fall the comb
i watch a light move across the screen
i watch the light come over me 

yeah, yeah
here we are now going to the west side
weapons in hand as we go for a ride
some may come and some may stay
watching out for a sunny day
where there's love and darkness and my sidearm 

hey, elan 

here we are now going to the north side 
i look at my friends as they start to ride 
ride at night we ride all day 
looking out for a sunny day 

here we are now going to the south side 
i pick up my friends and we hope we won't die 
ride at night, ride through heaven and hell 
come back and feel so well.
