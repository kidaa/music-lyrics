Thick black soul
Moving slow, moving close to you
This life I don't know
It seems kinda sick to me
Hold each other tight
Walking through to my destiny
This glitter in my eye
Catches light catches sympathy
This glitter in my eye
Catches light catches sympathy

Your lips are moving but I can't hear what you say
Stars are falling but you still feel the same way

This shield
What is real
Is believing
Ha-ha-ha-aaa
