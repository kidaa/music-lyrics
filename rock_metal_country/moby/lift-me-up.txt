Plain talking Plain talking
Take us so far take us so far
Broken down cars broken down cars
Like strung-out old stars like strung-out old stars

Plain talking Plain talking
Served us so well served us so well
Travelled through hell travelled trough hell
We know how it felt we know how it felt

Lift me up, lift me up
Higher now up now
Lift me up, lift me up
Higher now up now

Plain talking Plain talking
Making us cold making us cold
So strong out and cold so strong out and cold
Feeling so old feeling so old

Plain talking Plain talking
Has ruined us now has ruined us now
You never know how you never know how
Sweeter then tough sweeter then tough

Lift me up, lift me up
Higher now up now
Lift me up, lift me up
Higher now up now
[4x]

Lift me up, lift me up
Ohla la la la
Lift me up, lift me up
Ohla la la la
[4x]
