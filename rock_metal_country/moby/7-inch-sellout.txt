we used to hang out at anthrax together
you weren't cool, just another loser
we did tapes, and maybe a t-shirt
but that wasn't good enough for you

7 inch sellout! 7 inch sellout!
7 inch sellout! 7 inch sellout!
7 inch sellout! 7 inch sellout! 
big man on vynal!

we played shows, and listened to necros
slammin' and skanin', anything goes
we had fun, you said you'd never change
you sold us out on yer search for fame
those days were gone, there's no turning back
all the pressure, you said you'd never crack
now you've found all yer stupid new friends
and you stabbed us in the fucking back

7 inch sellout! 7 inch sellout!
7 inch sellout! 7 inch sellout!
7 inch sellout! 7 inch sellout! 
big man on vynal!

we used to hang out at anthrax together
you weren't cool, just another loser

7 inch sellout! 7 inch sellout!
7 inch sellout! 7 inch sellout!
7 inch sellout! 7 inch sellout!
7 inch sellout! 7 inch sellout!
7 inch sellout! 7 inch sellout! 
big man on vynal!
