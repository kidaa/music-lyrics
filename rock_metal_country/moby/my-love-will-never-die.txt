I was so good
I felt like this
I want everything
Now it likes me
My love will never die
My love will never die
And I felt it like your so depressed
And my whole buzz broke like nothing
My love will never die
My love will never die
My love will never die
My love will never die
Couldn't fit in an hour
Like never saw
I was hell in in a moment
I couldn't live at all
Love will never die
My love will never die
My so look to feel so good, I want everything now it likes me
My love will never die
My love will never die
And my so good I felt so bad
Like hell maybe
Come quick and I know that
My love will never die
My love will never die
My love will never die
Can't do in an hour
You gotta figure it all
My love is over and I don't know
Like never going under
Love will never die
Love will never die
And I felt like I could not live I said no hey, make it not mine
My love will never die
My love will never die
My love will never die
My love will never die
My love will never die
My love will never die
My love will never die
My love will never die
