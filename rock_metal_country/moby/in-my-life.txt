In my life
No, no
My whole life is fucking you
You...you
And in my life...my life...my life
And I'm so scared...that you...and you
You'll let me just go
Let go...let go
You'll never know
No...no
Go in my life
My life...my life
And told me that I'd die
I'd die...I'd die
Well I'm here in my life...my life...my life

In my life...my life...my life x2

If this was mine
Mine...mine
