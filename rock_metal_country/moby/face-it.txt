Come into my bedroom
Come in at night
You'll take your bowie
Gonna skin it alive
Where where hold it now lord
Your gonna get cut
Where where hold it down lord
Did it all for what?
I won't be there calling
Oh lover let me take my fall
What we're now holding now lord
Down on my knees
What we're hold it down lord
Lord come in peace
Well I
I know
I got a face no-one else knows
Well I
I know
I gotta learn how to face it
Oh sail on, sail on
Sail on, sail on
It's for the longest time
No nonononono
Nononononononono
Face it
I gotta learn how to face it
With my love blown to pieces
I gotta face it
Oh lord love me now please and I'll face it
Oh lord let me feel I gotta face it
Oh lord let me I kneel I gotta face it
My hope's gone lover face it
Oh love's gone, let me face it
Oh love's gone, let me face it
 background  Oh love's gone, let me face it
