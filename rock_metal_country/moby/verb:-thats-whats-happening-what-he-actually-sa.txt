I get my thing in action
To be, to see, to feel, to live
And I put my heart in action
To run, to go, to get, to give
'Cause that's where I find satisfaction
To search, to find, to have, to hold
When I use my imagination
I think, I plot, I plan, I dream
Turning in towards creation
Well I make, I write, I dance, I sing
'Cause I get my thing in action
Yeah I get my thing in action
GO!
When I'm feeling really active
Well I run, I ride, I swim, I fly!
Other times when life is easy
Oh I rest, I sleep, I sit, I lie
I can take a noun and bend it
Make it a verb and really send it!
'Cause I get my thing in action
And I don't know my own power
I can question; like what is it?
I can order; like go get it!
When I need I really need it
When I see I got to have it
'Cause I put my thing in action
Yeah I put my thing in action
Yeah I get my thing in action
And I don't even know my power
NO!
