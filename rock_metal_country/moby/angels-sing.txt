I close my eyes
And feel the morning rain
Covering my face
I think of you again
About the the time
When you were here
The city it felt so bright
The city felt so clear

Oh, we could of made the angels sing
Now I can do anything
I can do anything
Oh, we could of made the angels sing
Now I can do anything
I can do anything

The time for us
We were always high
I would move beneath your wings
You could make me feel alive
And what we had
It felt so strong
But now I'm here all alone
Tell me, what did I do wrong?

Oh, we could of made the angels sing
Now I can do anything
I can do anything
Oh, we could of made the angels sing
Now I can do anything
I can do anything
