Chorus
A troubled heart and a troubled mind
Is all I'm gonna leave behind
I'm movin' on down the line
Don't shout me down I'm doin' fine
You've been hard and heavy on my soul
Gotta lighten the load and let you go
Life's too short, ain't got the time
For a troubled heart and a troubled mind

Got a v-8 Ford slung low to the ground
Got a highway leading me outta town
A road map open to the promised land
I've taken just about as much as I can stand

Repeat ChorusBridge

Windshield wiper slappin' off the rain
Bright lights shinin' on the passin' lane
One more mile, one less tear
So long Daddy I'm outta here

Repeat Chorus
