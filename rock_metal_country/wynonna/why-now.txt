Somewhere off
In a distant dream
You were long ago
Like a memory

Now you're back
Standing here
Sayin' all the words 
You think I want to hear

Did you finally realize
What I knew all along
That you never needed me
Until I was gone

Chorus

Why now
Should I turn my life around
Just to let you bring me down
Another time
Oh, why now
After all the years apart
Should I open up my heart
And let you in my life againEverything, that I tried to forget
Thought I left behind, guess it ain't over yet
And babe, it's almost worth all the pain
Just to look in your eyes and hold you again
You never realized how much I tried
To let you know what I was feeling inside

Repeat Chorus

Hold on, cause it's starting all over
Hold on, cause it won't be the same
Hold on, letting go would be better
Letting go of the pain

Bridge

How did you think I would be
Waiting for you for an eternity
Repeat Chorus
