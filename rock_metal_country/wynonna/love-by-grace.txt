I remember the rain on the roof that morning
And all the things that I wanted to say
And the angry words that came
From nowhere without warning
That stole the moment and sent me away
And you standin?there in the doorway crying
And me wonderin?if I'd ever be back

I said I didn't come here to leave you
I didn't come here to lose
I didn't come here believin?BR> I would ever be away from you
I didn't come here to find out
There's a weakness in my faith
I was brought here by the power of love
Love by grace

And I remember the road just went on forever
I just couldn't seem to turn that car around
'Til in the distance like a long lost treasure
The phone booth that just could not be found
And you standing in the doorway waiting
And the moment when we lay back down
That was just a moment in time 
And one we'll never forget
But one we can leave behind
'Cause when there is doubt
You'll remember I said

Repeat Chorus
