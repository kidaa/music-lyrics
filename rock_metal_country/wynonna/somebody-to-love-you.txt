You need a job so you can make some money
You need a nice warm place to stay
A sense of humor 'cause life is funny
A big stick to keep the wolf away
You need a car with good tires on it
The right place to eat barbecue
A heavy duty set of jumper cables
And no holes in you walkin?shoes
The main thing you're gonna find you need
Is a fertile place to plant your seed, boy

Chorus

You got to find somebody to love you
Someone to be there for you night and day
Someone to share it with and be part of you
Love ain't no good 'til you give it away
You got to give it away

I recommend you get some life insurance and be prepared to dial 911
Pay close attention to your high blood pressure
And stay away from the man with the gun
You need a reason to get up in the mornin?BR> Make sure your clock has got a snooze control
Be sure you got a place to run for cover
'Cause overnight things can sure get cold
You're gonna find that sooner or later
You need a common denominator

Repeat Chorus
