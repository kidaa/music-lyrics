I always go the other way
But my car drove me down today
To a little house on the older side of town
Back when things were never hard
I used to play there in that yard
And I just drove by to see if things had changed

Cokes were just a nickel then
And across the street at the Five and Ten
A lot of things were cheap and square and strange
And the life we had might have been
But it was one we loved believing in
And I just drove by to see if things had changedI wondered now
If love is still the way it was back then
I need to know 
That life is still a place worth living in
There it is, just like it was
A house where there was always love
I just drove by to see if things had changed

In a world that's seen its better days
It's good to know some things remain
The same, though standing still is not time's way
Take to heart while in its spring
That love is just a fragile thing
I just drove by to see if things had changed
