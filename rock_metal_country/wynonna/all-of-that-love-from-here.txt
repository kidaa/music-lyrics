I can see a cotton field
An old man working in the mill
I can see loadin' the trunk of my old blue Oldsmobile
I see the tears in my mama's eyes
When she kissed her baby goodbye
I can still feel all of that love from here

Chorus

I can see the cotton sheets
They're swingin' in the wind, out swingin' in the wind
I close my eyes and my mind flies
And I'm right back home again
I'm right back home and
I can get lost while I'm chasing my dreams
I find my way 'cause my heart has wings
And I can still feel all of that love from here

I was raised on love's foundation
The Rock of Ages goes unshaken
The faith and hope that was given to me is stronger than the blackjack tree
My mama taught me how to stand alone
She let me go but she still holds on
And I can still feel all of that love from here

Repeat Chorus
