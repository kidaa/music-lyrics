You might tell me to mind my business
But I've been watchin' and I've been a witness
To the things you do and say and the games you play
You better start cutting the man some slack
Or he's gonna leave and he won't be back
One day you're gonna chase him away
If you keep on yankin' that chain
Honey, if I was in your shoes
I tell you what I would do

Chorus

If I had a love like that
A real fine love like that
I'd be treatin' him right
And never do him any wrong
If you're gonna do like that
With a good love like that
Sister, just like that you're gonna wake up
And find him goneThat man you've got is crazy about you
He wants to build his world around you
There's nothin' that he won't do will satisfy you
But I see you flirtin'
Shakin' your skirt and one of these days
You're gonna hurt him
Gonna push him just a little too far
And break a good man's heart
Before you go and loose it all
Here's a little wake up call

Repeat Chorus Twice

Sister, just like that you're gonna wake up
And find him gone
