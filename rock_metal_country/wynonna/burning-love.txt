Lord almighty, 
I feel my temperature rising
Higher and higher
It's burning through to my soul

Baby, baby, baby
You're gonna set me on fire
My brain is flaming
And I don't know which way to go

Your kisses lift me higher
Like the sweet song of a choir
You light my morning sky
With burning love

Ooh, ooh, ooh
I feel my temperature rising
Help me, I'm flaming
I must be a hundred and nine
Burning, burning, burning
Nothing can cool me
I just might turn into smoke
But I feel fine

Cause your kisses lift me higher
Like a sweet song of a choir
You light my morning sky
With burning love

It's coming closer
The flames are now licking my body
Won't you help me
I feel like I'm slipping away
It's hard to breathe
And my chest is just a-heaving
Lord, a'mercy
Burning a hole in me

Cause your kisses life me higher
Like the sweet song of a choir
You light my morning sky
With burning love
With burning love
Ah, ah burning love

I'm just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
[repeats seven times]
