How do you do it anyway?
Like there ain't nothing to it
To make me stay

No tricks with smoke and mirrors
Not anything up your sleeve
A second look and it can't be clearer
It's no mystery

[Chorus]
It's in the way you love
It's in the little things you say
It's in the way you live
And give your heart away
It's in the chance you took
It's in the way you look at me
That sets you a world apart
And makes you who you are
And you are beautiful
You are

Pressed on my soul
Your fingerprint
Going where no one's ever been
Well, I don't know how
But I know you're in it
My life, my world, my dreams
I try but I just can't pin it
Down to one thing

[Chorus]
