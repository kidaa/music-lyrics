Youd think I'd have the sense to run
Knowin where youre comin from
I cant bring myself to go
Heaven help me I cant say no

I see forever in you deep blue eyes
And I know where the danger lies
Tell me whats a girl to do
When shes up against the likes of you

Im old enough to know better
But too young to resist
Id lay awake at night 
Wonderin what I might have missed
But somethin' tells me your trouble
The only trouble is
Im old enough to know better
But too young to resistNow good things come to those who wait
Somethin tells me this is fate
And after all that I've been through
Im gonna trust my heart to you

I suppose where loves concerned
Some fools just never learn
Lying here in your arms tonight
I cant help but feel
Its gonna be all right, be all right
