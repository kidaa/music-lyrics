Two smilin?faces, that's how it used to be
What once was forever is now a faded memory
The perfect illusion
For a while I guess it was
Without explanation
The bloom fell off the rose

Chorus

Heaven help my heart
'Cause it's a lot like me
I'm wonderin' when this all will end 
And I'll find the love I need
I know it's out there somewhere
Somehow I still believe
I'm asking please
Heaven help my heartThis world can get crazy
These are troubled times
I'd walk through the fire
If love is what I'd find
It's out of my hands now
So I put my faith in you
And I say a little prayer
And hope that it comes true

Repeat Chorus
