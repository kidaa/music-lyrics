When I reach the place I'm goin?BR> I will surely know my way
And I will turn and look inside me
And bid farewell to one more day

Every light begins with darkness
Every flower is once a seed
And with the sun and wind to test us
We are bound to be released

I will fly beyond this valley
I will open up the gate
And when I reach the place I'm goin?BR> I will surely know my way

We have hands to hold our sorrow
We have tears to heal the pain
And though your eyes ask many questions
On your lips I hear my name

I was born without a whisper
I was born beneath the rain
But when I reach the place I'm goin?BR> I will surely know my way
I will surely know my way
