End of the night and my money's spent
Gotta hock my clothes to pay my rent
It's a roll of the dice and it's the same ole game 
Those crazy snakes done bit me once again

Now I wanna tell you 
It's been a long road and a difficult time
My life's been so blue 
But I ain't giving up
And I'm ready now to try, try, try

Chorus 

I've seen the time when you could not stop the rain
When nothing changes and every day stays the same
Those bitter grapes have now turned to the sweetest wine
I'm ready for the sun to shine, a new day is dawning

When it gets too tough, comes to push and shove
I swear it was you baby who invented love 
It's the same ole rhythm, it's the same ole rhyme
It's the same ole stuff that gets me every time

Now I wanna tell you
It's been a long road and a difficult time
My life without you
Ain't been easy babe
But I'm ready now to fly, fly, fly

Repeat Chorus Twice

Get ready, get ready
Everybody get ready
