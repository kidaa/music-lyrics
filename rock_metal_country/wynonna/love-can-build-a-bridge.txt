I'd gladly walk across the desert 
with no shoes upon my feet 
To share with you the last bite
of bread I had to eat

I would swim out to save you
In your sea of broken dreams 
When all your hopes are sinking
Let me show you what love means 

Love can build a bridge
Between your heart and mine
Love can build a bridge
Don't you think it's time

I would whisper love so loudly 
Every heart would understand
That love and only love
Can join the tribes of man

I would give my heart's desires
So that you might see
The first step is to realize
That it all begins with you and me

Love can build a bridge
Between your heart and mine
Love can build a bridge 
Don't you think it's time

When we stand together
It's our finest hour
We can do anything, anything 
If we keep believing in the power

Love can build a bridge
Between your heat and mine
Love can build a bridge
Don't you think it's time
Don't you think it's time
