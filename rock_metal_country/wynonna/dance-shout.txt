You told me that you wanted somebody to talk to
You told me that you needed a friend
You told me that you wanted somebody to stay with you
Somebody to stick with you to the end

So let me introduce you to someone who knows you
He knew you before you got your name
He's closer than a brother more than your father
And all you've got to do is call His name

Dance! Shout!
Come on everybody lets turn His praises out
Dance! Shout!
Come on everybody it's all worked outIt's all so very simple! It's all so very plain!
You don't need nobody to explain!
When you believe in your heart that Jesus is Lord
You will know for yourself that you've been born again!

When we get to glory we will tell the story
Of how we lived in this world below
My soul will look back and wonder
How I made it over
But when I see His face that's when I will know
