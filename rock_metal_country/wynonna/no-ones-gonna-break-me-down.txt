Road blocks, red lights
Dang brakes, that's life
People say what they want
I don't care it's just talk

Go, let's start this show

[Chorus]
I ain't gonna let 'em hurt me now
They ain't gonna break me down
I ain't gonna let 'em kick me around
No one's gonna take my crown
Hey nothin's gonna break me down

Got my back against the wall
Cities rise, cities fall
Reckless ride, wild abandon
I'll be the one left standin'

No you can't roll this stone

[Repeat Chorus]

Bridge
I might trip up and I might stumble
But you won't ever see me crumble
Oh, oh...

I ain't gonna let 'em hurt me now
They ain't gonna break me down
I ain't gonna let 'em kick me around
No one's gonna take my crown

[Repeat Chorus]

Nothin's gonna break me down
