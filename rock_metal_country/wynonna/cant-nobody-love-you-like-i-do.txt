Can't nobody love you like I do
Not now, no not ever
There ain't no doubt I know this thing
We have, could last forever

Others may promise the stars in the sky
But sooner or later you'll find
Can't nobody love you like I do

Can't nobody hold you quite this close
All night like I want to
Baby put your sweet lips here on mine
You'll see 'cause I'm gonna show youJust how an angel like you should be loved
I can't feel you enough 
Can't nobody love you like I do
Can't nobody love you like I do

Who knows when it's meant to be 
Well love knows and it sent you to me

You don't know how I live for the day
You look at me and you say
Can't nobody love you like I do
Can't nobody love you like I do
Can't nobody love you like I do
