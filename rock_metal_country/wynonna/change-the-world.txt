If I could reach the stars 
I'd pull one down for you
Shine it on my heart, so you could see the truth
That this love inside, is everything it seems
But for now I find, it's only in my dreams

Chorus

That I can change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was somethin?good
Baby, if I could change the world

If I could be a queen, even for a day
I'd take you as my king, I'd have it no other way
And our love would rule, in this kingdom that we made
'Til then I'll be a fool, wishin?for the day

Repeat Chorus
