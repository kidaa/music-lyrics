Something 'bout the way
The moon and the stars are moving across the sky
Something in the still night air is telling me now is the time to try

I've been scheming, dreaming up a plan of how to get to you
Now conditions are right deep in the night
To do what I've got to do

To start up a chain, chain, chain, chain reaction
Chain, chain, chain, chain reaction

I'm no fool, I'll be cool
It's a powerful thing that I'm trying to do
Gonna fix it up, mix it up good
Handle with care like I know I should
And blow it sky high, sky high
With a chain, chain, chain, chain reaction
Chain, chain, chain, chain reaction

Set a spark to the heart
That will start up the soul attraction
Get to the mystery of the chemistry
Chain, chain reaction
Chain, chain reaction

Repeat

That fires up the satisfaction
Chain, chain reaction
Chain, chain reaction
