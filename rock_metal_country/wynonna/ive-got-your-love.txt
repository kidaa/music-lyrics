You've dropped pennies in a wishing well
And wished on every star that fell
Trying to find a heart of gold
You've even called the psychic line
But all of that's a waste of time
I know what your future holds

If you want a love that never ends
Take my hand and let forever begin

Chorus

I've got your love
Don't need to wish upon a star
Dreams don't have to be that far
Just look inside my heart
I've got your love
Don't need to wear that lucky charm
To keep the magic goin' strong
Cause here in my arms
I've got your love

If you just take a chance, believe in me
It won't be long until you see 
What I've known all along
I'm meant for you, you're meant for me
There's no escapin' destiny
I promise from this moment onI'll give you a love that never ends
Take my hand and let forever begin

Repeat Chorus

There's a stairway to heaven
I'll take you all the way

Repeat Chorus Twice
