I wanna walk 
To no particular destination
I wanna talk 
When I got the inclination
I wanna move 
When I got the locomotion
I'm gonna do just what it takes 
To keep this smile on my face

I wanna drive my car
Wherever they're driving faster
I wanna sail the ship
As long as I can be the master
I wanna ride the rails 
On my own roller coaster
I'm gonna do just what it takes 
To keep this smile on my face

Chorus

I was born to be this way
Never save for a rainy day
I just like to make it my own way
I wanna be the first to say

Don't wanna work real hard
If it means that I ain't livin?BR> Don't wanna go through life
If there's no room for gettin?BR> Don't wanna stand here long
If it just means I'm a waiting
I'm gonna do just what it takes
To keep this smile on my face

Repeat Chorus

Don't wanna change my ways
If there ain't no good reason
Don't wanna change my mind 
Without any rhyme or reason
Don't wanna be one way
I got to change like a season
I'm gonna do what it takes
To keep this smile on my face
I'm gonna do what it takes
To keep this smile on my face
