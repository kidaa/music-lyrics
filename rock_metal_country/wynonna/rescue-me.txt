What do you do when you're scared inside?
When all of your feelings just seem to collide
Emotions just seem to let go
All of your tears always follow

All of these things that you're feeling deep down
And you realize that you're calling out loud

[Chorus]
I love Thee 
Rescue me 
Shine your light lead me home
Lord, all I need is your love
I love Thee 
Rescue me
Shine your light lead me home
Lord, all I need is your love
Rescue me, rescue me

What do you do when the path leads nowhere?
When you need someone to be there
Now you're afraid of what's gonna come
And now there's nowhere to run

All of these things that you're feeling deep down
Then you realize that you're calling out loud

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Oh it's love's sweet salvation
With Christ the Blessed Lamb
We can get through anything as long as it's you and me

[Repeat Chorus]
