There in the pale moonlight
That's where you and I were walking
I said?looking in your eyes
I'm feeling like the sky is falling
You said you gotta be free
But love like this is everlasting
I said?I gotta be me
But I move my feet and nothing happens

True love is a funny thing
'Cause no one else does what you do to me

Chorus

I'm chasing my tailspinning my wheels
I got your heart hot on my heels
I'm all dressed upbut I swear
Without your love?I'm going nowhere
Fast or slow
You can say I told you so
I've done thatI've been there
But without your loveI'm going nowhere

Time I've got a lot of that
Day and night baby I been thinking
How soon do I want you back
Sooner than you can say you need meTrue love is a funny thing
'Cause no one else does what you do to me

Repeat Chorus

Oh, what you do to me
I just can't get away from what used to be
Your love is all I can dream about
Oh, baby you got my head spinning 'round

Repeat Chorus Twice
