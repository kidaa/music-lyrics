The keeper of the gates of wisdom
Please let me in
'Cause I just can't go through 
Another heartache again
Pretty lies and alibis
How could I be so blind?
Now I'm all alone and scared to stay
Slowly going out of my mind

Chorus

He was my strongest weakness
I surrendered heart and soul
It's gonna be a long, long time
'Til I regain control
I'm still a prisoner 
Held captive by his memory
He was my strongest weakness
And I'm afraid he'll always beI gave my faithful heart to someone
I couldn't understand
How he held my little world 
In the palm of his hand
Now he's gone and life goes on
So if this pain will ever end
Will I be afraid to risk it all
Ever fall in love again?

Repeat Chorus
