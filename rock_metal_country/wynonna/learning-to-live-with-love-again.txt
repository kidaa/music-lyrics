There's not much of a moon tonight
Clouds are covering the sky
The only guiding star in sight
Is the light in your eye
And though I want to follow you
Right now it's more than I can do

Chorus

Oh baby, hold onto this moment with me
Show me how to start
I'll find my way but until then
If I'm slow to surrender
Try to remember
I'm learning to live with love againKisses are sweet, passion strong
You make it feel so right
But there was a love that went so wrong
It's still here with me tonight
I don't want to live in the past
A little understanding is all I ask

Repeat Chorus

I'm learning to live with love again
