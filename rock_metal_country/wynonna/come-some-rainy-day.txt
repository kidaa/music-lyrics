What good's a dollar 
Without your baby sister?
Two scoops of ice cream 
On a summer afternoon
We ran wild 
And all we ever wanted
Was to rule the world
Between our house and school

Chorus

We move on
Put those dreams away
Thinking that we'll find them
Come some rainy day

First time I saw you 
I knew I would love you
Half way through sophomore year 
I finally asked your name
When I kissed you 
I lost my heart completely
All we wanted
Was just to stay that wayWe move on
Put those dreams away
Hoping that we'll find them
Come some rainy day
How could I know
That everything would change
Except the way I miss you
Come some rainy day

Bridge

I'll sit and laugh with friends
At what we've all been through
But I still catch my breath
When someone mentions you

Repeat Chorus
