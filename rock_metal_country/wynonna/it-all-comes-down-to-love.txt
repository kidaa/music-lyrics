Talking heads talking to us on the television
Silver screen preachers and politicians
Say they got the answer first they gotta squeeze us
Send a little money there's tax on Jesus
Fix it with a prayer, fix it with a dollar
Does anybody out there ever want to holler?

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh it all comes down to love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Self-help guru's got a best seller
Ricki Lake's got a drag-queen bank teller
1-900 look into the crystal
N.R.A. says you better buy a pistol
They made a little pill but it might cause cancer
It's just a cheap thrill when you're looking for the answer
There's only one answer

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh it all comes down to love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh it all comes down to love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Suits on Wall Street make another million
Dealer on the backstreet talkin' to your children
You cry for help and nobody listens
You lie awake at night wonderin' what's missing?
You can put an end to all the confusion
Look into your heart for the one solution

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh it all comes down to love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh it all comes down to love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
