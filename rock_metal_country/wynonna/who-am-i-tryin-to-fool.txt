I can tell myself I'm in control
I can live this life without you
But you know it's just a lie
You know it's just my pride

I can tell myself I'm broken down
One too many times
But then I start to cry
Don't want to live this life without you

Chorus

Who am I tryin' to fool
Why must I walk away so strong
When I feel so weak
Who am I tryin' to fool
Everybody knows I still love you

I can tell myself there's someone else
Out there tryin' to find me
But it doesn't make much sense
When I've already found youRepeat Chorus

Only you, I love only you
Only you, ooh

I can tell myself I've had enough
I can't do this anymore
But what about my heart, what about my heart
I can't forget it still belongs to you

Repeat Chorus

Who am I tryin' to fool
Who am I tryin' to fool
Everybody knows I still love you
