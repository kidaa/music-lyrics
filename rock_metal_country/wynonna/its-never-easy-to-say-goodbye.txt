Jimmy climbs on board that old yellow bus
It sure looks big in his little eyes
His mama waits as her tears kick up the dust
It's never easy to say goodbye

Julie Ray in her pearl white wedding gown
Has found her wings and it's time to fly
It's all her dad can do to keep from breakin?down
It's never easy to say goodbye

Chorus

It ain't easy 
To ever say goodbye
It ain't easy 
Lettin?go of the ones you love
But believe me 
Begin by and by 
If not here
Than somewhere up above

I've had some friends that I lost along the way
They've been called on down the line
Though their time was short, I think about them every day
And it ain't easy to say goodbye

Repeat Chorus

Now the time has come to go our separate ways
And it's all right if you want to cry
And though I know, we'll meet again someday
It's never easy to say goodbye 

Repeat Chorus
