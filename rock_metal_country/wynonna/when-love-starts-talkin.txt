I thought I had my life worked out
I thought I knew what it was all about
Then love started talkin'
Your love started talkin'

I had my mind on the open road
I thought I knew where I wanted to go
Then love started talkin'
Your love started talkin'

Chorus

When love starts talkin'
You got no choice
But to shut up and listen
It's a powerful voice
Open the door
And let it walk in
That's what you gotta do
When love starts talkin'I thought I had it wrapped up neat and nice
I didn't need nobody's advice
Then love started talkin'
Your love started talkin'

Repeat Chorus

I thought I heard it all before
I thought I didn't need to hear no more
Then love started talkin'
Your love started talkin'
Your love started talkin'
Your love started talkin'
Your love started talkin'
Love started talkin'
