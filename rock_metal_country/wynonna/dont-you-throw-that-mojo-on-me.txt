You go where you want to
Go out on the town
Expect to keep me waitin'
With that law you're layin' down
That ain't right
Tonight I'm breaking free
Ain't gonna work no more
Don't you throw that mojo on me

You got some magic
I'll give you that
It just ain't worth it
I ain't going back
No more
Under your lock and your key
I know that look
Don't you throw that mojo on meYou ain't gonna be my hangman
I ain't gonna wear no noose
Well I got somethin' here now baby
I'll be turnin' loose
You ain't the only one
I got some tricks up my sleeve
It might come back to haunt you
Don't you throw that mojo on me

Yeah, it might come back to haunt you
Don't you throw that mojo on me
