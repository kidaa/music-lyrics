Thats the same engine under the hood
Carried young Elvis to Hollywood
Been cross country a time or two
And look at it now, its just like new
He had a weakness for Cadillacs
A girl in the front and his friends in the back
Thats the original paint job too
And look at it now, its just like new

Elvis was happy, he felt pretty good
Here he was drivin' to Hollywood
Gassin it up and pushin it through
And look at it now, its just like new
According to one of Elviss friends
He took it up to a hundred and ten
He just wanted to see what his Caddy would do
And look at it now, its just like newAnd my, my what a beautiful machine
Oh boy, it rides just like a dream
Just think of all that its been through
And look at it now, its just like new

He drove it to Memphis come Christmas time
Weather so fair, the future so fine
Say, Mama them girls aint as pretty as you
Look at her Daddy, shes just like new
Elvis was always a dutiful child
And here everybody was thinkin' hes wild
He bought his folks a Cadillac too
And look at it now, its just like new
