I've been alone too long 
Wondering how to go on
Without you here by my side
So many lonely nights
Only memories keeping me alive

It never crossed my mind 
So much would take me to you and I
I could have known you wouldn't stay
Now it's a lonely day
It used to be your love lifting me away

I can't go on now that you're gone
I feel this emptiness
If it's not you I'm thinking of
If it's not you - who am I supposed to love

Nobody stands in your place
I can't see another's face
Only a trace of what I knew
Only a shadow
I can't picture anyone but you

I can't go on now that you're gone
I feel this emptiness
If it's not you I'm thinking of
If it's not you - who am I supposed to love

I should have known, something so strong
Couldn't go on and last forever
If it's not you, who am I supposed to love

Now just a trace of what I knew
Only a shadow
I can't picture anyone but you

I can't go on now that you're gone
I feel this emptiness
If it's not you I'm thinking of
If it's not you - who am I supposed to love
