Pack up all your tears
Bury the past
Send them away
Don't let 'em hold you back
Love will find you again
You'll find another way to begin
And you'll trust in someone
Your day will come

[Chorus]
Throw it on the line
Let your heart break down
Know that at the right time
Love is gonna come around
Open up your soul and 
Let the moment hold you
Don't push it away
Oh I know you know
You belong in the sun
Your day will come

Don't go back there
Don't tear yourself apart
Just listen to you
Remember who you are
Wait for true love
What's one more day
You'll find the one
Your day will come

[Chorus]
Throw it on the line
Let your heart break down
Know that at the right time
Love is gonna come around
Open up your soul and 
Let the moment hold you
Don't push it away
Oh I know you know
You belong in the sun
Your day will come

[Bridge]
Pack up all your tears
Bury the past 
Send them away

[Chorus]
