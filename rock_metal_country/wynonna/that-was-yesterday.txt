Its finally over
But I cant even cry
So, dont you give me no sweet talk
You done told your last lie

I was your puppet
Just a dancin, dancin on a string
But when the sun went down last night,
Lord, it changed everything

Today I feel different
Cause now I can see
That you care more bout yourself
Than mistreatin me

It took me a long time
To figure you out
But misery and pain 
Aint what loves all about

Chorus

I was your woman
But ya threw it away
I used to be your very own
Custom made, love slave, do anything for you, little fool
But that was yesterday
That was yesterday

And so it goes
Another lesson gets learned
And in the big book of experience 
Another page gets turned

Now you say you need me
Well, honey, you got some nerve
I hope some sweet tomorrow 
Well get what we deserve

Repeat Chorus

Im packing up and movin on 
Your real good thing is good and gone
