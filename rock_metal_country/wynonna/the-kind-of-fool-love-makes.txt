Anyone can read the sign
Or the writing on the wall
It's all right there to see
Except someone like me
Who can't see the truth at all

It takes a special kind of fool
To stand out in the rain
Somewhere in between
Nothing left to lose
Nothing to be gained

Chorus

What kind of fool does it take
To go on loving alone
Like there's some answer in the ruins
Some silver lining to be found
An even bigger fool might think
That you would care if my heart breaks
Before the time that I admit
I'm just the kind of fool love makesA wiser one would see
Nothing's gonna change
There's a time for giving up
A time for letting go
To learn from our mistake
But I keep holding onto hope
In spite of everything I know

What kind of fool does it take
To go on loving alone
Like there's some answer in this ruin
Some silver lining to be found
It takes a bigger fool to think
That the dawn will never break
On this day that I admit
I'm just the kind of fool love makes

On this day that I admit
I'm just the kind of fool love makes
