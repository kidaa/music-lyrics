What I am supposed to do with this house, and these cars
All this so called success the good Lord's given me
I'd gladly give it all away right now,
Just to see you walk through that gate
Up the drive and back to the simple we used to be 
Before the money and the lawyers and the lies and the chains
And all this fame

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel like Elvis 
Here I am with everything and nothing at all
I've never felt so helpless
I don't know who I am now that you're gone
Sometimes I feel like Elvis

I remember the first time I saw you, you killed me
I'd never wanted anything or anyone so bad
I took for granted that just because of who I was
You'd be there, while I gave the rest of the world all I had
Everything got crazy, it all happened so fast
It was outta my hands

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel like Elvis 
Here I am with everything and nothing at all
I've never felt so helpless
I don't know who I am now that you're gone

[Bridge]
Sometimes I feel like I'm on stage
Sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy

[REPEAT HALF CHORUS]

What am I suppose to do with this house and these cars
I'd gladly give it all away right now
Just to see you 

Sometimes I Feel like Elvis
