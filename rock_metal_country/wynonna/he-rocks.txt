To see him walking by
He might not catch your eye - here's why
Not quite heaven-sent
Kinda Clark Kent - yeah, that's it
He's got the profile of an average Joe
But wicked on the weekend
When he's on a roll

Chorus

He rocks, he kicks
Born for a good time
And he don't miss a lick
He can talk it, he can walk it
He can throw down with the best
Gets you thinking things
That you never would confess
Send your mama into shock
He rocksHe's got all the moves
Showed me one or two
He'll take you 'cross the floor
Charm you to the core, for sure
Throwing on some makeup
Kinkin' up my hair
Come on taxi driver
You gotta get me there

Repeat Chorus Twice
