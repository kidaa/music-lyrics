I've been a rock and I've got my fences 
I never let them down 
When it comes to love, I keep my senses 
I don't get kicked around 
I shivered once you broke into my soul 
The damage is done now I'm out of control 
How did you get to me?

Chorus

No one else on earth could ever hurt me 
Break my heart the way you do 
No one else on earth was ever worth it 
No one can love me like 
No one can love me like you 

You can make me want you any time you want to 
You're burnin?me alive 
I can't deny you even when I catch you
Weavin?a weak alibi 
'Cause when the night falls you make me forget 
Your love is killing me and it ain't over yet
How did you get to me?Repeat Chorus

I shivered once you broke into my soul 
The damage is done now I'm out of control 
How did you get to me?

Repeat Chorus Twice
