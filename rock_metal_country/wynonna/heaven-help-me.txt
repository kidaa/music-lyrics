I could lose my vision
My eyes no longer see
I could lose my religion
In my struggle to believe

That would be a loss
That would be a cross
I'd somehow rise above
But Heaven help me
If I ever lose your love

I've traded my innocence
For the secrets of the night
Felt my calloused conscience
Lose its grip on wrong and right

It cut me to the bone
But somehow I've held on
'Cause I could feel your touch
But Heaven help me
If I ever lose your love

'Cause you are the one light that shines on me
Without your love God knows where I'd be

Lost without a prayer
Somewhere way out there
My soul would turn to dust
Heaven help me
If I ever lose your love

'Cause you are the one light that shines on me
Without your love God knows where I'd be

So hold me close again
Tell me it won't end
And that will be enough
Heaven help me
If I ever lose your love

Heaven help me
If I ever lose your love
