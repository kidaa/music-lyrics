I've got night vision, I can find my way home
I don't get nervous when I'm out on my own
I've got that sixth sense, I just follow the stars
But wherever I am, I wonder where you are

I walk a tightrope, I follow my heart
Just like a compass whenever we're apart
I believe that love comes shining through
I'd fly through the storm to find my way to you

Chorus 

'Cause I'd be lost without you
I'd be slowly going crazy
You're the place I wanna be, you're all I ever need 
I'd be lost 
Lost without youI'm on a mission, it's on with the show
I've got dreams that I'm chasing and places to go
But the further I wander, here's what I find
Wherever I am it's you that's on my mind

Repeat Chorus

For so long 
I was caught up in the chase
Trying to find my place
And who am I to ever deny
When the world got me down
You came and you swept me away

Repeat Chorus
