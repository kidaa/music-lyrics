If life was a classroom
And love was just a lesson
An answer you can guess
Until you get it right

You with your hand up
Who are you impressing
It's just when everything
Is clearly in your sight

[Bridge]
Will cast you adrift
But I'm of the notion
It is what it is
Say it with me

[Chorus]
It's only love
You take it until it's gone
The thing to build your world upon
When it's getting rough
It's only love
There's nothing like a fantasy
The way we think it ought to be
It's never quite enough

If life was a spaceship
Cruising through the cosmos
Then love will be the rock that
Blows you from your sky

Though it can be emotive
It can be explosive
And when it leaves you cold
All you can do is lie

[Bridge:]
So bite your lip 
Hide your emotion
It is what it is
Say it with me

[Chorus]
