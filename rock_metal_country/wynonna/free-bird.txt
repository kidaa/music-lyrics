If I leave here tomorrow
Would you still remember me
For I must be traveling on now
Theres to many places I got to see

***chorus***

And if I stay here with you boy
Things just couldn't be the same
Cause I'm as free as a bird now
and this bird you cannot change
and this bird you cannot change 
and this bird you cannot change
Lord knows I cannot change

bye-bye baby its been a sweet love
oh this feeling I cannot change
Please don't take it so badly
Lord knows that I'm to blame***chorus***

And if I stay here with you boy
Things just couldn't be the same
I'm as free as a bird now
and this bird you cannot change 
and this bird you cannot change
and this bird you cannot change
Lord knows I can't change 
Lord help me I can't change 
Lord I can't change

So wont you fly high free bird
