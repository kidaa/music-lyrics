Once upon a Christmas morning
There was a pretty little baby boy
It seems like I remember sadness
Mingling in the joy
For Mary saw the future
And the sadness it would bring
And that's when Mary started crying
When she heard the angels sing

Chorus

Let's make a baby king
Let's make him Lord of all
Let's give him everything
Let's make a baby kingNow, you remember little King David
He's the little baby's kin
He's cousin to the man named John
And I know you all remember him
And John said, ";Let's get ready!";
The herald angels sing
'Cause this old world needs to know
The good news that I bring

Let's make a baby king
Let's make him Lord of all
Let's give him everything
Let's make a baby king

Now we could use a revolution
The world is turned upside down
We need a new direction
We've got to turn this whole thing around
And we need a Lord to guide us
Teach us wrong and right
And we need a lamb to lead us
Into the land of light
