Time to walk away
Youve run out of things to say
Everything ends up the same old story
You dont know where love went
But nothing's making sense
You both know you cant fake it anymore

Dont look back hell see you cryin
Dont look back on love thats dyin
Make believe your heart is made of stone
Dont look back into his eyes
Youve already said goodbye
Its over now; youve got to let him goHes the one you love
But sometimes love is not enough
Its too complicated to explain
No you never will forget
But youll get over it
Someday just sweet memories will remain

So dont look back; dont break your will
Dont look back at him until
Youre far enough to let your feelings show
Dont look back into those eyes
Youve gone back so many times
Its over now youve got to let him go
Theres a time for everything including leavin
Theres a time the heart admits defeat
And starts its grieving
