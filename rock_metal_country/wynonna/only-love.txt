I have sailed a boat or two
Out on the wild blue
Yonder to dreams that rarely come true
As far as I can see
From the island of green
I can put my trust in just one thing

Chorus

And only love sails straight from the harbor
And only love will lead us to the other shore
Out of all the flags I've flown
One flies high and stands alone
Only lovePeaceful waters, raging sea
It's all the same to me
I can close my eyes and still be free
When the waves come crashing down 
And the thunder rolls around
I can feel my feet on solid ground

Repeat Chorus
