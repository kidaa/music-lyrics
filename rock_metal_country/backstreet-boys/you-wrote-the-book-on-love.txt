When I first met you
My life turned a page
Chapter one was how true love was made
You taught me with your kiss
Things about romance I missed
You knew everything from A to Z
What pleases you and what pleases me
Girl when you touched me I began to understand oh oh oh oh

[Chorus:]
Oh you
You wrote the book on love you wrote the book on love
I wanna read every word
So I know everything about you
Oh you
You wrote the book on love you wrote the book on love
Girl I just can't get enough
Of your love
I know
Oh you wrote the book on love

Oh Brian help me sing

Each time I hold you I find something new
Cuz I know what I love about you
Girl I'll discover
You bring out the lover in me, yeah, yeah
Your like a fire that burns in my soul
Like a volcano I'm ready to blow
Cuz everytime I look at you I feel
Love I can't explain oh oh oh

[Chorus]

I hear what your heart is saying to me saying to me
I see the picture so clear to me
I'm thirsty for the knowledge true love brings
When your near me

[Chorus 4x]
