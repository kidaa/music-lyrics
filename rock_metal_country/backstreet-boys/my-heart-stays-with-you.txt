You know, sometimes being on the road is rough
      Especially loneliness.....

      Girl I miss you
      And it's only been one day
      Since I went away
      And already I say
      I long to kiss you
      And hold you in my arms
      The nights are much too long when you're gone
      Baby, that's why

      Wherever I go
      Girl, my heart stays with you
      After every show
      I wanna rush over to you
      My heart stays with you

      Trust me, when we are apart
      I won't break your heart
      Wherever you are
      I know you feel me
      Baby, 'cause I can feel you too
      No matter what you do
      I think of you

      Girl, my heart stays with you
      After every show
      I wanna rush over to you
      Baby, yeah

      When I'm leaving town
      Girl it hurts me too
      But I've got a job to do
      I'll be back around
      To feel your sweet face
      Your dear embrace
      No one can take your place

      Back
