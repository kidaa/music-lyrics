Baby it's the way you make me
Kinda get me go crazy
Never wanna stop
It's gotta be you uh huh, uh huh

I can't control it anymore
I've never felt like this before
Mmm, you really make me lose my head
My hungry heart must be fed uh huh, uh huh

Baby it's the way you make me
Kinda get me go crazy 
Never wanna stop

[Chorus:]
It's gotta be you uh huh, uh huh
All the way
It's gotta be you uh huh, uh huh
Everyday
I promise you I will be true, yeah
It's only you

Now I know why I was born
You feel my feelings one by one
Can't see the world I'm walking through
Cuz baby I see only you, oh yeah

Baby it's the way you make me
Kinda get me go crazy
Never wanna stop

[Chorus]

Baby it's the way you make me
Kinda get me go crazy
Never wanna stop

And you know
I can't see the world I'm walking through
Cuz of you, yeah...
It's gotta be you, all the way
All that I ever wanted
It's gotta be you, I will be true, yeah
It's only you

[Chorus]
