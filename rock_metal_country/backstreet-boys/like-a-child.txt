If I could right the wrongs that made you cry
Girl, would you promise not to say goodbye, oh
Cuz I'm holding on
With a love so strong
And I can't take the day without you by my side

Girl if I could change
If I could change your mind
Maybe you could help me wipe these tears from my eyes

Girl don't stop don't stop
The sun from shining down on me ooh shining down on me, yeah
Cuz I can't face another day without your smile your smile
And if you take away the loving arms that surround me
Then I might break down and cry just like a child

Girl I can't belong and I won't be free
If I fail to bring your lovin' back to me oh back to me
So I'm pressin' on
I hope you understand
That there's a broken heart that lies within your hands

So if I can change so if I can change
And it won't hurt your pride it won't your pride
Baby you can help stop these tears from my cries

Girl don't stop
The sun from shining down on me shining down on me
Cuz I can't face another day without your smile your pretty smile, your pretty smile
And if you take away the loving arms that surround me
Then I might break down and cry just like a child

Like a child
Just like a child
With the spirits running free
She trapped me wild
Oh she did
Like a child oh baby
Just like a child Think of what our love could be
If our hearts could set us free
Like a child, yeah

[Chorus 'til fade]
