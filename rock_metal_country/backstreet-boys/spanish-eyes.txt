Here we are
In the arms of one another
And we still go on searching for each other
Knowing that hate is wrong
And love is right
For us tonight
When I look into your Spanish eyes
I know the reason why I am alive
And the world is so beautiful tonight

[Chorus:] 
It's a place I've never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me
That I'm about to win first prize 
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes

Let it be if we're nothing more than dreamers
Who believe that we see no one between us
How can they be in my heart
And in my mind
When all I can find
When I look into your Spanish eyes
I know the reason why I am alive
And the world is so beautiful tonight

[Chorus]

I loved you from a distance
Thought I couldn't reach that far
I can't believe how close that we are
When I look into your Spanish eyes
I know the reason why I am alive
And the world is so beautiful tonight

[Chorus]
