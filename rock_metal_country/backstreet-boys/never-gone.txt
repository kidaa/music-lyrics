The things we did, the things we said
Keep coming back to me and make me smile again
You showed me how to face the truth
Everything that's good in me I owe to you

Though the distance that's between us
Now may seem to be too far
It will never seperate us
Deep inside I know you are

Never gone, never far
In my heart is where you are
Always close, everyday
Every step along the way
Even though for now we've gotta say goodbye
I know you will be forever in my life yeah
Never gone

No no no
I walk alone these empty streets
There is not a second you're not here with me
The love you gave, the grace you've shown
Will always give me strength and be my cornerstone

Somehow
Somehow you found a way
To see the best I have in me
As long as time goes on
I swear to you that you will be

Never gone, never far
In my heart is where you are
Always close always close
Everyday everyday
Every step along the way
Even though for now we've gotta say goodbye
I know you will be forever in my life in my life yeah

Never gone from me
If there's one thing I believe I believe
I will see you somewhere down the road again

Never gone, never far
In my heart is where you are
Always close always close
Everyday everyday
Every step along the way
Even though for now we've gotta say goodbye yeah yeah
I know you will be forever in my life in my life

Never gone, never far
In my heart in my heart is where is where you are you are
Always close, everyday
Every step along the way

Never gone, never far
In my heart is where you are
