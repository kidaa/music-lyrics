Everytime I close my eyes
Everytime I close my eyes

Listen girl I don't know where to start
But every word I say comes straight from the heart
I've been so wrong
I never meant to hurt you
Oh girl, I'm sorry
For what I put you through
Girl I'd do anything
For one more chance one more chance
Cuz I want you back again want you back

[Chorus:]
Cuz everytime I close my eyes
I see your face and I wonder
When you close your eyes
Do you think about me
Now I realize
I want you girl and no other
Everytime I close my eyes
You're all that I see

You and I shared a life together
Each other, was all we'd ever need all we'd ever need
I thought you would stay with me forever
But I took for granted
The love you gave to me
I keep on tryin' keep on tryin'
'Til the end 'til the end
Baby I need you back with me again I need you back

[Chorus]

And girl I'm goin' out of my mind
I miss you so much
I don't know what to do what to do
Please say it's just a matter of time
Until I feel your touch
Until you let me come back to you I'm in love with you

I think about you girl everynight
I'm in love and it feels so right
I never meant to hurt you or cause you pain
I was just caught up in that lying game
But now those days are over
I've changed my ways
And now I'm countin' the minutes
I'm countin' the days
Until you let me come back
Until you let me start
To find a new way to get back into your heart

Girl I'd do anything for one more chance one more chance
Cuz I want you
I want you back again I want you back

[Chorus]
