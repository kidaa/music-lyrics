Let's talk about one baby 
      You gotta hear me out 
      Do you really wanna be the last to know 
      What it's all about 

      Let's talk about two, you say 
      He's the essence of your life 
      But he'll eat you up from inside slow 
      And then he doesn't wanna know 
      I'm telling you, he'll eat you up from inside 
      And then he doesn't wanna know 

      CHORUS 

      Listen, I mean it 
      There's nothing that he's worthy of 
      He's just another player playing in the name of love 
      I've seen enough, now this must come to an end 
      Get another boyfriend 

      Let's talk about what he's done 
      To become your number one 
      Or was it all the promises of diamonds, pearls and party dresses that turned you on 
      I've seen it before, don't take anymore 
      Three, two you're through for sure 
      Just go get on with your life 
      Stop acting like you've given up 
      I'm telling you to go get on with your life 
      Stop acting like you've given up 

      CHORUS C repeat 

      Hear me out 
      You must know 
      What it's all about, baby 
      That he's just a player in love 
      This must come to an end 
      Get another boyfriend 

      CHORUS C repeat
