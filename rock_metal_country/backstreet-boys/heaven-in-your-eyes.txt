Open up your heart to me
And say what's on your mind
I know that we have been through so much pain
But I still need you in my life, this time

And I need you tonight
I need you in my life
And I know deep within my heart
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
Cuz I see heaven in your eyes

All those endless nights we tried
To make it last forever and more
And baby I know
I need you

I know deep within my heart
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
Cuz I see heaven

I need you tonight
I need you in my life
And I know deep within my heart
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
Cuz I see heaven
In your eyes
