[Phone rings girl picks up]

[Girl:] "Hello"
[AJ:] lot's of people talking in background"Hi it's me what's up baby I'm
sorry listen I'm gonna be late tonight so don't stay up and wait for me ok"
[Girl:] "Where are you"
[AJ:] [people get louder] "Wait wait say that again"
[Girl:] "Hello"
[AJ:] "You're coming in and out I think my battery must be low. Listen if you
can hear me we're goin to a place nearby, alright Gotta go" [click]

Let me tell you the story about the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out, just to end up in mysery
I was about to go home and there she was standing in front of me
And I, I got a little place nearby
I wanna go, I should have said no
Someone's waiting for me
But I'm gonna go up and see

Listen Baby I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late don't stay up and wait for me
I'll say again you're drying out my battery it's low
So you know we're goin to a place nearby
I gotta go

Now till it's done nothing's been won
I can't take it back what's done is done
One of her friends found out
That she wasn't the only one
And it eats me from inside, that she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied

Listen Baby I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late don't stay up and wait for me
I'll say again you're drying out my battery it's low
So you know we're goin to a place nearby
I gotta go

[Break with repetitive "Baby baby I'm sorry, and "Hello"]

Let me tell you the story about the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out, just to end up in mysery
I was about to go home and there she was standing in front of me
Said I, I got a little wasted bye
Gotta go

Listen Baby I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late don't stay up and wait for me
I'll say again you're drying out my battery it's low
So you know we're goin to a place nearby
Gotta go

Listen Baby I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late don't stay up and wait for me
I'll say again you're drying out my battery it's low
So you know we're goin to a place nearby
We're goin to a place nearby
Gotta go
