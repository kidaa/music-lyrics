You don't run with crowd 
      You go your own way 
      You don't play after dark 
      You light up my day 
      Got your own kind of style 
      That set you apart 
      Baby that's why you captured my heart 

      I know sometimes you feel 
      Like you don't fit in 
      And this world doesn't know 
      What you have within 
      When I look at you 
      I see something rare 
      A rose that can grow anywhere 
      And there's no one I know that can compare 

      What makes you different 
      Makes you beautiful 
      What's there inside you shines through to me 
      In your eyes I see all the love I'll ever need 
      What makes you different 
      Makes you beautiful to me 

      You got something so real 
      You touched me so deep 
      You see material things 
      Don't matter to me 
      So come as you are 
      You've got nothing to prove 
      You won me with all that you do 
      And I wanna take this chance to say to you 

      What makes you different 
      Makes you beautiful 
      What's there inside you shines through to me 
      In your eyes I see all the love I'll ever need 
      What makes you different 
      Makes you beautiful to me 

      You don't know 
      how you touch my life 
      Oh in so many ways I just can't describe 
      You taught me what love is supposed to be 
      It's all the little things that make you beautiful to me 
      So beautiful 

      What makes you, what makes you different 
      Makes you beautiful 
      What's there inside you shines through to me 
      In your eyes I see all the love I'll ever need 
      What makes you different 
      Makes you beautiful to me
