Dadadadadada Dadadadadada Dadadadadada dadadadada
On memory's bliss of you
Dadadadadada Dadadadadada Dadadadadada oh dadadadada

The candle plays the hourglass
The days go and all I do is
Think of you and wonder where you are at night
Oh I remember everything
Every smile, and even all
The reasons why you say 
I pushed you out of my life

[Chorus:]
Baby you set me... Hahahahaha
Baby you set me... Dadadadadada
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you dadadadada
Baby you set me... Hahahahaha Dadadadadada
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you dadadadada

Destiny is everything
Reality's replaced you with
The biggest empty void I've ever had in life ever had in life ohh
Bet you say that I don't care
I bet you say that I don't even think of you
But God knows how wrong you are

Baby will you be there when the morning comes
Baby will you be there
Just give me time just give me time
To fix my life to fix my life, baby
Baby will you be there when I open my eyes
After all the time I've spent, wishing you

[Chorus]

Sadness that overwhelmed me
My mind flies and carelessly
Imagines that you're happy with your life right now oh
I guess that's just the was it goes
Forever's gone so now I must
Place you with all the things that I can never have

[Chorus]

So come on now Hahahahaha
I know this much is true Dadadadadada
I know this much is true dadadadada Hahahahaha
