I'm dreamin'
You had me thinking right from the start
That our feeling will never keep us apart

You had me thinking that I was the one
But I never knew it was only for fun

[Chorus:]
Tell me that I'm dreamin'
Say you're never leavin'
Don't you wanna be with me don't you wanna be with
Tell me that I'm dreamin'
Say you're never leavin'
Your heart will be safe you see, ooooooh

Isn't it true
That my love for you
Is here to stay
It'll never go away

Isn't it true that my love for you
Is here to stay baby
There will always be that day yeah

[Chorus]

Oh how can I know that
Summer days are gettin' lonely
And how can I know that my
Love is gettin' stronger
I dream away

[Spoken:]
Girl if you only knew
Just how much I really love you
I think about you night and day
My love for you will always stay

I never knew it was only for fun
You had me thinkin' That I was the one

[Chorus]

Come on now
You and me girl we were meant to be
Together forever in harmony [3x]

[Chorus to fade]
