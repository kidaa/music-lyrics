There is something special
About this time of year
A christmas feeling's everywhere
I just got home to join you
I've been away too long
But now I'm back
To share my love
Friends are reunited
One big family
Filled with love
To last throughout the year

[Chorus:]
Christmas time, time to share our love
Come and join the tidings to the world
Christmas time, the best time of the year
Yes, it's christmas time

You and me together
Sleigh Ride in the Park
Loving kissing
Straight from the heart
Snowflakes falling gently
A smell of chesnuts in the air
And Christmas lights
They gleam across the sky

[Chorus]

Do you remember
Everything felt so nice
When I held you close to me
Do you remember
Those cold christmas nights
When we saw the world in harmony

[Chorus]

Christmas time, time to share our love
Come and join the tidings to the world
Christmas time, time to share our love
Come and join the tidings to the world

[Chorus to fade]
