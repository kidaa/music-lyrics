I know that I, I can't believe
Just what the past has brought me
To the man I wanna be
I know that we have had some times
That we can't forget the struggle
Cause we have so far to go

I know we've changed but
Change can be so good
So let's not forget why
It's understood that

[chorus:]
Time, look where we are and what we've been through
Time, sharing our dreams
Time, goes on and on everyday, baby
Time is what it is
Come what mayccome what may

I remember when, mom used to say
That things are getting better
And you'll soon be on your way
Remember those days
When we would sing at the drop of a dime Oooh
Way back when nothing mattered Mmm, mm, mm

I know we've changed, but
Change can be so good
Oh so let's not forget why it's understood that

[chorus:]
Time, look where we are and what we've been through
look where we are
Time, sharing our dreams dreams, dreams, dreams, oh yeah
Time, goes on and on goes on and on everyday everyday
Time is what it is Oh
Come what may come what may

[bridge:]
So here we are here we are
And we'll always stay together
And through it all you know we owe it all to you, you, you , you
Time goes on and on

[chorus:]
Time Time, look where we are and what we've been through
Time, sharing our dreams
Time, goes on and on goes on and on everyday everyday
Time is what it is Time is what is it

Time Time, look where we are and what we've been through
Time Time, sharing our dreams sharing our dreams
Time, goes on and on goes on and on everyday
Time is what it is, Come what may

Time, goes on and on everyday, Time is what it is
Come what may
Come what may
