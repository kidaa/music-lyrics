You've got something
So incredible in my eyes
And my heart and my heart
It starts pumpin' pumpin'
Whenever you're around
The whole world's upside down baby
But I try to get closer
And you always push me away
You tell me it's much too soon
But I just can't help it
I always gotta make a play

All my senses
Go right into overdrive
Oh my defenses
I'm never gonna hope
I always gotta lose control
And I hear you say
That you think that we should wait
And I can't hold on anymore
My body's callin' for you
So please don't hesitate
