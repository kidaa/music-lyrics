I wanna be with you
It's crazy but it's true
And everything I do
I wanna be with you

I'd like to know your policy
When it comes to me
Like to know what's in your mind
It's not easy to see
I know now what I feel
And what to do
I wanna be with you
And I'll be waitin'
Until you face the truth
When the light is fadin'
You know what I wanna do

[Chorus:]
I wanna be with you
It's crazy but it's true you know it's true
And everything I do is for you baby
I wanna be with you oh with you

[Bridge:]
Everybody say hey
Yeah, see you once again
Yeah, everybody swing Yeah, everybody Yeah, everybody swing

Wish you'd come and set me free
So that I can see
All the things I've left behind
What's missin' in me
I'm lookin' for a sign
In the things you do
I wanna be with you
And I'll be waitin'
Until you face the truth
When the light is fadin'
You know what I wanna do

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

I wanna be with you
It's crazy but it's true
And everything I do
I wanna be with you
[2x]

I wanna be with you I wanna be with you
It's crazy but it's true It's crazy but it's true
And everything I do And everything I do
I wanna be with you I wanna be with you
Hey yeah
And everything I do
I wanna be with you
