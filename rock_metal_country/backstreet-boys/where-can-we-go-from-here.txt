I try to pick the pieces up 
      And I can't think of startin' over 
      We used to share the stars above 
      I don't wanna think of change 
      So now I've gotta move on 
      I've gotta catch up to the world 
      Even though I gave you my life 
      As wrong as it seems I know its right 

      But is there a place 
      That I can go away 
      To escape the love that 
      I will forever know? 

      Chorus 
      Where can we go from here? 
      All I know is that I love you still 
      Sometimes we do things against our will 
      I know I'll cry lonely tears 
      Where can we go from here? 

      Why? Why do I cry inside 
      For a love that's gone away? and 
      How? How can I carry on 
      When I know all the love is gone 
      Tell me where can we go to get away 
      From the pain of love and you 
      Tell me, where? 

      Where can we go from here 
      All I know is that I love you still 
      Sometimes we do things against our ways 
      I know I cry lonely tears 
      Where can we go from here
