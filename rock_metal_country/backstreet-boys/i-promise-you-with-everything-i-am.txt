It's in the silences 
      The words you never say 
      I see it in your eyes 
      Always starts the same way 
      It seems like everyone we know is breaking up 
      Does anybody ever stay in love anymore 

      CHORUS 

      I promise you 
      From the bottom of my heart 
      I will love you til death do us part 
      I promise you 
      As a lover and a friend 
      I will love you like I'll never love again 
      With everything I am 

      I see you look at me 
      When you think I'm not aware 
      You're searching for clues 
      Of just how deep my feelings are 
      How do you prove the sky is blue 
      The ocean's wide 
      All I know is what I feel 
      When I look into your eyes 

      CHORUS - repeat 

      There are no guarantees 
      That's what you always say to me 
      And late at night I feel the tremble in your touch 
      What I'm trying to say to you 
      I never said to anyone 

      CHORUS C repeat 

      with everything I am  


      Back
