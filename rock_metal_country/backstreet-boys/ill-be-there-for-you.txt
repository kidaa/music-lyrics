Don't say a word
      I understand
      You wanna know
      If I'm still your man

      Girl can't you tell
      By the touch of my hand
      I'm gonna please you
      Every way that I can

      I'll hold you, hold you
      Love you, love you
      I'll never let your love go let you go, let you go
      For always , for always
      I'll stay, I'll stay
      Just look in my eyes and you'll know

      Chorus

      Baby I'll be there for you
      Wherever you go
      Whatever you do
      Girl I've got forever inside
      For all of my life
      I'll be there for you

      Don't Ever Doubt
      Your trust in me
      I'll give you my heart
      So honestly

      Deep in my soul
      Baby you'll find the truth
      I'll never change
      Girl I promise you

      Chorus

      Nothing and no one can tear us apart
      You'll always be here inside of my heart
      And just as sure as the stars shine above
      No matter what happens
      You can count on my love

      Chorus 2X

      Back
