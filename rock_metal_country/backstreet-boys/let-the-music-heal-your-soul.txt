Oh if someone writes a song with a simple rhyme
Just a song where is feeling show
And if someone feels the same about the simple song
Oh sometimes you can hear them sing
Music gives you happiness or sadness
But it also, it also heals your soul

[Chorus:]
Let the music heal your soul
Let the music take control
Let the music give you the power to move any mountain

Oh if someone plays piano with some simple chords
So melodic and endearing too
And oh if someone plays guitar with the old piano
And maybe you can hear them sing
Music gives you happiness or sadness
But it also heals your soul

[Chorus]

Oh yeah
Let the music heal you soul
Let the music take control
Let the music heal you soul
Oh, oh yes

Let the music heal your soul
Let the musice take control
[6x]
