All...
      Everything I have is for you 

      My name is Kev 
      And I like the type of girl who can love me for me 
      The type of girl who I can hold in my arms 
      And give her all that I have to give 
      And if you're that type of girl 
      Then you're getting all my love 

      My love, my love 

      That's right baby 

      Hi my name is Brian 
      But you can call me B-Rok 'cuz I'll be rockin' your house *laughs* 
      Nah, I'm just playin' 
      But on the real tip, I like a serious girl 
      Somebody who's gonna be smart 
      A girl who even... even likes to go to school 
      Yo Brian, stop lying 
      No, c'mon Nick, for real 
      I like a girl with a good head on her shoulders 
      Yeah right! 
      C'mon

      My love, my love 
      My love is all I have to give 

      My name is Howie D. 
      And this is how we do it 
      I like the type of girl that one day she'll become my wife 
      We'' get married and she'll make me breakfast 
      She'll make me lunch and my dinner 
      I want bacon and eggs, pancakes, orange juice, mashed potatoes, 
      Turkey, guacamole, chicken... 
      Yo, yo, Howie... chill... Howie? Howie?

      And I like the type of girl that loves to go dancing 
      The type of girl that likes to move her body 
      The type of girl that likes to shake what her mama gave her 
      The type that will let me hold her hand and kiss her 
      The type that will let me take her to the movies and then kiss her 
      The type that will let me hold her so tight and then kiss her 
      And kiss her, and kiss her, and kiss her *laughs* 

      [Refrain]
