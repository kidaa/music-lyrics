Ah, Backstreet
One time here we go yes, yes one time, yes, yes

I could tell when I stepped in the room
And I saw you standing there
Caught in a vibe by the way that you moved
I couldn't help the way I stared
There was some mysterious force
Leading me here to you
Lead me to you lead me to you

So I stood there watching
And I was hypnotized
By the rhythm of your body
And the music in your eyes
And I was lost inside your world with you
Oohh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus:]
Hey Mr. DJ keep playin' this song for me
Out on the floor in my arms she's gotta be
Let's get it on let's get it on
Jam all night long
Mr. DJ, Mr. DJ
Play it play it for me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Now it feels like it could be romance
As we dance across the floor
Every move that your body makes
Only makes me want you more
And it seems like time's moving fast
How can we make it last
Make it last now make it last some how

As we keep on dancing
I am hypnotized
By the rhythm of your body
And the music in your eyes
I was lost inside your world with you with you
Oohh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus]

Close your eyes close your eyes
And imagine us alone Just imagine 
Let the music put you in a zone let the music put you in a zone, a zone yeah
I get lost I get lost
Lost inside a groove with you Lost inside a groove
When you do the dance you do
Come on and work your body, work your body

Hey, Mr. DJ
Jam all night long
Hey, Mr. DJ
Play that song for me
Hey, Mr. DJ
Jam all night long
Hey, Mr. DJ
Play that song for me

[Chorus 2x]

Keep it comin' Mr. DJ
Ohh
Keep it comin' Mr. DJ
Ohh
Keep it comin' Mr. DJ
Ohh
Keep it comin' Mr. DJ
Ohh
