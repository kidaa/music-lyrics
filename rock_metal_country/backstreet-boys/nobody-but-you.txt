Ain't nobody else but you [3x]

There is nobody
Who can make me cry
Nobody else can do it
Nobody but you [2x]
Ain't nobody else but you
There is nobody
Who can make me lie
Nobody else can do it
Nobody but you [2x]
Ain't nobody else but you
Nobody, nobody but you
Gimme one more chance to make it right
Time has come for us to reunite
Cuz baby it's true
Ain't nobody else but you
There's no one like you

There is nobody
Who can make it right
Nobody else can do it
Nobody but you
You know what to do
Ain't nobody else but you
Nobody, nobody nobody but you
Yeah
Somebody tell me
Cuz I can't eat or sleep
When you're not close to my body
You're a bittersweet delight
Come and help me through the night

Ain't nobody else can make me cry
Ain't nobody else can make me lie
Nobody but you
Ain't nobody else but you
Nobody but you
No one can make me lie
Gimme one more chance to make it right
Time has come for us to reunite
Cuz baby it's true
Ain't nobody else but you
There's no one like you
