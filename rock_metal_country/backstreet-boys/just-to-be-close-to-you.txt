This is for the lovers
Strictly for the lovers yeah
You got someone you wanna get close to
Then get close to this
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Just to be close to you
Yo, drop the verse

Like a flower to a tree
That's how close I wanna be
To your heart baby to your heart, heart
Like the stars to the night
And daytime is to light
We'll never part we'll never part
I want you to be I want you to be
The only thing that I see ooh ooh
Cuz I believe it's our destiny

[Chorus:]
Just to be close
Just to be close
It's the only thing
That I wanna do ooh
Just to be close
Just to be close
Just to be close to you
Just to be close

So lonely is the night
Wihout you to hold me tight
I wanna hold you closer
I need you
Baby hold me closer, closer
My life would mean nothing
Without the joy you bring to me
You know, you know, you know
There would never be
No one else for me
You are like a dream that became reality

[Chorus]

I'm gonna give you all my love
I'm gonna give it to you
I'm gonna give it to you all my love all my love
I'm gonna give it to you
I'm gonna give it to you
Give you everything you need all my love
I'm gonna give it to you
I'm gonna give you all you want
To be close to you to be close to you
Close to you close to you

[Chorus]

I don't want to be alone
I'll never never never ever let you go
Just want to be close to you
I don't want to be alone
Girl I'll never never never ever let you go
Just to be close
There'll never be never be
No one else for me
You are like a dream that became reality

[Chorus]

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
I just wanna be close
