[Chorus:]
Oh baby, I'm missing you
We used to love so strong
Tell me where did we go wrong
Oh baby, I'm missing you
They say I'll learn to forget
But it sure ain't happened yet

Been checkin' all the places where we used to go used to go
Been lookin' for your face inside the crowd
I've been talkin' to the people that we used to know
But nobody wants to say
Where you hang out
And when I call your phone
Seems like your never, ever home
And you don't return my calls return my calls
It tears me up tears me up
It's breakin' up my heart it's breakin' up my heart

[Chorus]

I still have your pictures hung around my room around my room
They're the only thing that's left of you and me
Girl what can I do to make you come back soon
And make it just the way it used to be
Oh, is there someone new
Could never go on without you
Girl I don't wanna think about it think about it
I can't sleep at night
No this can't be right
Come back into my life come back, baby come back

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
I know there's a chance for you and I
And I believe there's no way our love could die
So no matter how long it takes, I'll wait for you
And whatever it takes I'll be there for you
I'll be there, I'll be there [2x]

[Chorus]
