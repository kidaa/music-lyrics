Don't, don't want you back

You hit me faster than a shark attack
You saw my picture on the Backstreet's Back, alright
And you were more than just a pretty face
But how you fooled me, I'm still amazed babe
But I should have known that I would be
Another victim of your sexuality
But now we're done and over with
Don't, don't want you back

[Chorus:]
Don't want you back
Cuz you're no good for me, I know
That's all I can say
Don't want you back
Forgive my honesty but you gotta go
I don't want you back

You started going out with so-called friends
But I was blind and so I lost all common sense
But there were things that made me realize, realize
Like all the hundred no, thousand lies

[Chorus]

Baby, don't bother telling me your reasons why
Just let us sing this story 'bout you and I
Don't want you back
That's all I know don't want you back, don't want you back
All I can say
Don't want you back
You know you gotta go

[Chorus 2x]
