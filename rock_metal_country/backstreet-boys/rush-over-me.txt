Washed away my sad face,
Flooded all my empty space
You take away life's heartbreak
And I know with you it's gunna be ok

You're rushin through me
Like water from Heaven
I Feel you movin through me
Like sand in the sea
And now I feel so alive
I know that there must be
Something here
so alive
Cause you're all the air in my atmosphere
Finally I feel complete cause
You are rushed over me yeah
over me over me over me

There no more blindness
When I cry I'm smilin
You kept me from dyin
And I know with you I'll keep on livin

You're rushin through me
Like water from Heaven
I Feel you movin through me
Like sand in the sea
And now I feel so alive
I know that there must be
Something here
so alive
Cause you're all the air in my atmosphere
Finally I feel complete cause
You are rushed over me

It's not enough just holding on
Before I met you I was lost
Now that you're standing here
I don't want you to go
I know that your love keeps me alive

You're rushin through me
Like water from Heaven
I Feel you movin through me
Like sand in the sea
And now I feel so alive
I know that there must be
Something here
so alive
Cause you're all the air in my atmosphere
Finally I feel complete cause
You are rushed over me

You're rushin through me
Like water from Heaven
I Feel you movin through me
Like sand in the sea
And now I feel so alive
I know that there must be
Something here
so alive
Cause you're all the air in my atmosphere
Finally I feel complete cause
You are rushed over me
