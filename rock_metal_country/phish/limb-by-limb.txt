the shoulder that I leaned on was carved out of stone
but when I'm done freezing I want to be alone
never want my hand cut off
never want a hacking cough
never need a cliffside push
never turn my brain to mush
always give me what I lack
always take the best parts back
always recognize your fate
always just a moment late
left is where I always turn
left is how I'm forced to learn
left the route my walking takes
left alone with my mistakes
up against the person who
up 'til now I never knew
up from hell the answer blew
up or down it's up to you
drop me off the Chinese wall
and peel my fingers off the rim
I come unglued while in midair and land to reform
limb by limb
and I am taken far away...
lingering slowly melting away
tossed with the salad and baled with the hay
pooling the water that drips from above
trampled by lambs pecked by the dove
