the circus is the place for me with bears and clowns and noise
I love the shiny music that descends from overhead
Gordan knew the moment when the stars all turned around
but from that vantage point I frowned
if life were easy and not so fast
I wouldn't think about the past
I can't forget to turn the earth so both sides get their share
of darkness and of light
so now I wander over grounds of light and heat and sound and mist
provoking dreams that don't exist
a circus of light where dreams can take flight
in the peacefulness dreaming dreams brings
