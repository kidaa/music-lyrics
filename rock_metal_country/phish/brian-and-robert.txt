If you're just staring at your walls
observing echoing footfalls
from tenants wandering distant halls
then this one is for you
if children playing all around
to you is noise not pleasant sound
and you'd be lost on the playground
then this one is for you
all alone the life you lead
a silent diner where you feed
bow your head pretend to read
this one is for you
slip past strangers in the street
there's no one that you care to meet
longing for your TV seat
this one is for you
