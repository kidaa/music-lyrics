listen as she speaks to you
hear the voices flutter through
the barriers arranged by you
close the shudders draw the shades
filter out the everglades
glistening with evening dew
thunder calls through waterfalls
rising tides and ocean walls
I can hear you when you sigh
listen as she speaks to you
hear the voices flutter through
watch them fall and let them lie
I can hear you when you sigh
through the water in the sky
