Much ado is all I see 
although my roots were deep
In fact it is surrounding me
The seething crowd intrudes all day 
I sank in hillsides deep
Until I'm finally swept away
Although I thought my roots were deep 
the rivers that erode 
I sank them into hillsides steep
And riverbanks that soon erode 
and canyons overflow 
And canyons that have overflowed
