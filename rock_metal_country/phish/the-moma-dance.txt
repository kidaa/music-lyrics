and all throughout I gaze and glimpse you
loving never did convince you
I see you when you're all alone
it's like a person I've not known
the moment ends though I feel winds
blowing differently than ever before
and they're pushing me further from shore
a frothy cap the steady slap
of lines against the rail
a biting rain take in the main
up the rigging take in sail mind the skipper we'll not fail
he'll bring out wine all will be fine just hear the order watch the sail
the moment ends
