Fluffhead was a man
With a horrible disease
Could not find no cure
Won't you help him if you please?
Fluff came to my door / Fluff came to New York two parts
Askin' me for change
His eyes were clear and pure
But his mind was so deranged
Fluff went to a banker
Askin' for some bills
The banker said, ";I ain't got that
But I sure got some powerful pills.";
