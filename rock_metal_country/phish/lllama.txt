[Many years after the overthrow of Wilson, a rebel soldier crouching
high on a hilltop above the war torn forests of Gamehendge spots a
group of loyalists approaching from their lakeside encampment below.
His trusty llama stands beside him, loaded down with a canvas pack
that holds two large bazooka type guns to the animal's sides. Near the
man sits a cache of blastoplast, each capable of destroying the entire
hillside in an instant...]
Sunrise over the turquoise mountains
Messenger birds in sight
They came up through the valley
Both sides at a time
Through the cold steady rain
Raid!
I bend down
Poke a double decker on a llama
Taboot
Llama, Taboot Taboot
Trigger a blastoplast, ramshackle laker recedes
I start to run
It was the loudest thing I'd ever heard
And I knew my time had come
To enter the delta
Leave it on press [2x]
Depress, Depress
Llama, Taboot Taboot
Leave it on press
Depress, Depress
Llama, Taboot Taboot
Llama, Taboot Taboot
Llama, Taboot Taboot
Taboot Taboot
