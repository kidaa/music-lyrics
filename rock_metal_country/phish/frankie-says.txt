time is me and I should know
I knew this several months ago
I knew more than I do now
for I've been turned around somehow
relax the world will spin beside itself and suck you in
with threats and hopes beyond compare
I change the landscape as I pass
meandering from sand to glass
I suction there for one whole day
until the feeling goes away
I don't need these orbits in my life
revolve and cycle through
don't keep coming back for more
I don't need this circular design
wheel and spin away from me
you've been by here before
I've lost my mind
I've lost my way
I'm bound to lose
You wonder where I am
