it's easy sometimes when you just coast along
but like it or not something always seems to go wrong
sometimes people build you up just so they can knock you down
sometimes they will have you there 'cause they need someone around
perhaps you'll receive invitations for tea
perhaps you'll laugh and make them all smile
or maybe you'll join them 'cause it had to be
perhaps you'll forget you forgot for awhile
birds of a feather are flocking outside
like whippets they dance in a curly-queue dance
of pulses and ringing and campfire chants
of ritual drumming although at first glance
you thought you could run but you won't take a chance
it's not an experience if they can't bring someone along
they hang on emotions they bottle inside
they peck at the ground
and strut out of stride
