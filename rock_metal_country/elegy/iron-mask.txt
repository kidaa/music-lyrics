where's the Light of  Sky
Shining to my Way ?
I'm going Blind and Alone
Burned by Love to Christ

I'm a Failure of my Waiting
Sacrificed to Cold Night
Cut by Faith in God
I'm hidden under Iron Mask
Wrung by Painfull Disappointment
when the God Turns his BackAuditorium is quite Empty
Theatre only for Me
deathlike Silence is so Loud
and Iron Mask is so False

I'm Failure of my Waiting
Sacrificed to Cold Night
Cut by Faith in God
I'm hidden under Iron Mask
Wrung by Painfull Disappointment
when the God Turns his Back
