I'm falling down through the black tunnel
My blind eyes can see the wall
My sister is strange to me, owing to me
My brother isn't mine, I know it
God is turned to the wall
And me ?
I'm like the black night

Black, black in the shadows of your wishes
I'm like the black night
And sleep cures fear of it
I'll kill your look at meMy sister is strange to me
My brother isn't mine
God is turned to the wall
I'm like the black night

Black, black in the shadows of your wishes
I'm like the black night
And sleep cures fear of it
I'll kill your look at me
