When I look at myself  frustration I try to hide
when it cries cries out in vain  then I can't resist or hide
My state of mind  state of mind
Now the feelings from within  tell the tale a life of sin
an' a cold journey through time
I don't recall memories  hard to focus hard to please
am I losing my mind
A psychological impulse  twisting around inside
My state of mind  an out of body experience  my state of mind
a separation between the soul and mind  to be as one with each other
a state of mind  in control of my helpless
The weirdest things always happen  could it be my penance
a mnemonic phase that I resist
Now the feelings dark within me  my sins will never ever be free
On and on and on we go  we live our lives but never show
the knowledge guilt we all possess  the strength of mind to now confess
