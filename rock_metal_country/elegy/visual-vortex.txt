Conceptual imaginary, it seems so real  which world do you live in
I sense the emptiness inside the brain  no apparent function, it has no name
nor does it see reality  an existance in an endless masquerade
People adoptpeculiar ways  interpretation caught in the maze
instinct the essence of life  somehow changed effecting the inside
My life is a world in a visual vortex
where reality and thought  drift through time
I'm a millionmiles from anywhere  a solitary isolation bare
where fantasies are real as can be  a world within a world no sense of reality
My life is a world in a visual vortex  where reality and thought
go spinning through time  a parralax world in a visual vortex
caught between the emptiness of time
