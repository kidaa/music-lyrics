Hey, my Pale Moon
, my Dear Friend
it's Last ... , it's Last ...

Last Night
with your Mysterious Beams
with your Cold Silence

I want to See you Again
I want to Hear your Voice
silent Night, your cold Light
and my Black Bloody Soulmy last Way is leading to sun's Grave
to sun's Grave
Soul is sliding along the Beam, no Look Back
, no Look Back

I want to See you Again
I want to Hear your Voice
silent Night, your cold Light
and my Black Bloody Soul
