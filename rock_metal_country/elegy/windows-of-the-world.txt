I lay alone, wrapped in chains and lost in visions 
Searching for reasons why I feel the pain of the world 
To my dismay the visions increased, the rage grew stronger 
I'm burning the food of the ones who are skin to the bone 
Who are you, projecting my crimes and dealing in pain 
I need to go... 
In vision two, a bloodred sky, well known intentions 
I'm carving a name in the bullet, it gives me the eye 
He's so alone, desperate he walks the streets of ashes, 
removing the bricks from the ruins as he screamed for his girl 
Where are you, projecting the grief, 
a world gone insane 
I need to go... 
Chorus 
Under in body and soul, 
take me under in a sea of love 
Hiding behind the windows of the world 
Under under your wings, 
take me under and fly me away 
Thunder, out the windows of the world 
She's daddies girl, he loves her so, he'd like to touch her 
Showes her the nature of men, it's the way of the world 
A winters night, the writing stopped, the words are written 
'Show me the freedom' she cries as she picks up the gun 
Who are you, projecting the grief, a world gone insane 
I need to go... 
Chorus
