Music, lyrics & vocal melody: Ian Parry
Growing up in extreme poverty, 
and living in a town filled with empty promises, 
the young boy is filled with scepticism. 
He battles between right and wrong. 
Facing a horrifying decision, which no child should have to make, 
his whole life could be turned upside down. 
Does he listen to the wishes of his kind, but stressful mother, 
to remain living in poverty, and be persecuted by many? 
The alternative is to take a road into crime and deception, 
with his so called friends. 
Either way he'll suffer the consequences.
Verse 
His mother sad, now she's left alone 
No shoulder to cry on, no hand to hold 
To stay alive, worked her fingers to the bone 
Guilt nor shame, her child must have a home
She tried to teach him right from wrong 
A town without vision, they don't belong 
Eternal friends, persuasive lies 
Tainted images, through sorry eyes
Bridge 
Don't be shy, pull up a stool, stick with us 
You'll do okay 
Money talks, that's their rule, 
Once you join, you're here to stay 
you can't walk away
Chorus 
Lord knows she tried hard to save him 
The angel without wings
Verse 
Stigmatised, the poor, the few 
Opportunities given, but not to you 
He searched along the corridors of power 
A fruitless journey, his darkest hour 
Bridge 
By any rule he doesn't play, 
Now he's the keeper, no-one's fool 
Who said crime doesn't pay 
All his fears have disappeared
Chorus 
Lord knows she tried so hard, to save him 
Lord knows she tried so hard, to save him
Middle-8 
The angel without wings 
Time, will it tell, a choice of heaven or hell
Repeat chorus
Outro 
The years have passed by, the leaves have fallen 
Learn to survive in time, you're on your own
