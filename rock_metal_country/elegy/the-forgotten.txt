Lyrics & vocal melody: Ian Parry
Ignored and hated by many, he can't stand the very sight of himself. 
Believing only that people wish him harm, 
while all the time there is a sympathetic eye from an admiring lady. 
As the years pass, she slowly gains his trust, 
but not without incident. 
Being of a passive and loving nature, 
she helps to transform his anger with regression. 
Eventually his fears are changed into a positive belief 
in the goodness we all possess.
Verse 
Ignored by the many, adored by the chosen few 
Friends he hasn't any, just his own point of view
Bridge 
There stands a lady inbetween the shadows 
Waiting patiently for you 
Holding out her hand she whispers 
Together we'll pull through
She transforms his anger 
Helps him wipe away the tears
Chorus 
I'll be there, standing next to you 
I'll be there I will pray, I will pray for you 
'Cos you're one of the forgotten children
Outro 
One of the, one of those forgotten children 
One of the forgotten friends 
Cast away those sins forgiven 
Fight on, fight on to the end 
You?ve gotta fight on
