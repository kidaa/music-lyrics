Lyrics & vocal melody: Ian Parry
Having taken a path of no return, he develops a personality of power,
and turns supreme manipulation into an art form. 
On the surface he portrays a person being of caring and consideration, 
while his dark side hides calmly, until the moment of truth can appear.
Verse 
Full of charm, so open minded 
Lets you talk 'till you're blue in the face 
Compassion sincere
His own portrayal, the proud example to others 
When in fact, a covenant he's made 
With the dark side of hell
Bridge
Wait! Don't be fooled by him 
Stop! don't go near him 
His appearance can change, like the chameleon
Chorus 
We're all his helpless subjects 
And like his damaged toys 
Once they're of no importance 
With savage grace destroys
Verse 
So supreme, a master to many 
An' acts like a friend, offers comfort to all
Patiently, telling wild fabrications 
Gaining your trust the thrill, the thrill of it all
Repeat bridge & chorus
Get ready to run!
