Amber Sea
Half a Thought
Halfway to the Truth
Wet Colour

I think about It

I'm afraid of Reality
Diverting the Brush
but I feel Weakness
All the long Time

I think about ItI'm afraid of  this False Immovability
I hear no Voice
I hear no Surge
I'm afraid of  Reality

Amber Sea ...

You think about It !
