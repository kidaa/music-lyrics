Carrion reposing on Moss
Desolated Remain

Soul is sliding along the Beam
No Look Back
light Feeling of  Freedom

Touches of Godless Happiness
Tones without the Voice of  Pain
Hands of something are spreading the Cheer

All is Endless

pungent Stench of  Carcass

Desolated Remain,
Drops of Rain are falling down to the Lake
Desolated Remain,
Drops of Rain are falling down from my FaceSoul is sliding ...
Touches of  Godless ...

Desolated Remain,
Drops of Rain are falling down to the Lake
Desolated Remain,
Drops of Rain are falling down from my Face

Touches of Godless ...
All is Endless ...

Desolated Remain,
Drops of Rain are falling down to the Lake
Desolated Remain,
Drops of Rain are falling down from my Face
