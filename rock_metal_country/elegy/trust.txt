I can't imagine any other way  than simply saying why I really feel  this way
it's mystifying in each and every sense  so nothing ventured nothing new to gain
Slowly life keeps moving on  before you know it's gone
the chance to say what's on your mind
My lips are drying up because of guilt
no point in crying once the blood is spilt
no good denying what is wrong or right
time has a way of healing  everything in sight
Don't forsake the broken hearted  wishful thoughts and proud ideals
finish what you've already started  and one day you'll blessed with the
power to reach the ones you trust
Who ever listens every word in vain  family connections goes against the grain
takes some persuasion trying to break through  advice worth delaying
when starting over new
