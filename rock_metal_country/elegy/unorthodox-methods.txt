In a dangerous environment, a single mother fights against tradition.
Protecting her son from the corrupt influences surrounding them both.
She tries to raise him as a good and honest person. 
Year after year, many sacrifices have to be made, 
but the white lies and tales she tells each Christmas, 
cause the child to develop a warped perception of life.
Verse 
Danger lurks in every place 
A mother fights to protect her child 
Tradition stipulates its way 
It's easy for them to say 
Influences all around 
Hard to change, creatures of habit 
Sacrifices must be made 
A few white lies she must tell
Bridge 
The pressure lay on her shoulders 
Decisions unfair 
Desperately seeking comfort 
Searching for strength not there
Chorus 
Have no fear 
Unorthodox ways, unorthodox methods 
Alone and afraid, different from others 
All alone 
She carries the strain, the future uncovers 
Hide your tears
Verse 
Years of hardship and of pain 
Corruption lingers in all the dark corners 
Her efforts are in vain 
His perception of life has changed 
Don't waste your time 
He's lost, it's time to pray
Bridge 
Stupid to point a finger, she isn't to blame 
Believing that life will bring him strength 
The courage to find his way
Repeat chorus
