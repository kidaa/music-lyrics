Lyrics & vocal melody: Ian Parry
Paranoia slowly starts to take effect. 
His huge fortune has created many enemies. 
In haste he searches for solitude. 
Secluded from the outside world, he lives in a fragile sense of security. 
Locked away he hopes to find peace of mind, 
but instead he's haunted by the terrifying images in his dreams. 
Images of those whose lives he so mercilessly helped to destroy.
Verse 
All of that money you've made 
From all of those souls with their lives they've paid now 
Lost your pride, locked inside 
Where's the light at the end of the road
Bridge 
Blame and sorrow 
No more day, just, tomorrow 
Close the door, turn the key 
Lock the misery away! 
You're living in an ivory tower
Verse 
All of the guilt you should feel when all of the torment you caused was real
Truth you've found, changed your made 
At the end of the road there's a light
Bridge 
So many places, hidden lies, saddened faces 
Close the door take the key, try and throw it away far, far away
Chorus 
In a solitary day 
There's a solitary point of view 
Hide the fear away! 
That's the price you have to pay
Middle-8 
They're coming to get you, put boards on your windows 
It won't take 'em long 'till they find out a way 
Don't sleep stay awake now, look over your shoulder 
Your enemy's coming to take you away!
Chorus 
In a solitary day, there's a solitary point of view 
Hide your fear away, it strips away the good in you
Repeat chorus
