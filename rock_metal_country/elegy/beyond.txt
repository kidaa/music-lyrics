Don't you worry  he won't be back here anymore
Try a little harder  go as far as you can go
a state of tolerance  something which you'll never know
The mind has a way of playing games  and twisting your reality
you're hooked like a fish and deep inside  lies the pain
He's longing for reality  no more abnormality
So sad to say you're no one's child  reflection is a part of you
an' come what may your nations wild  are killing you
More and more  like a drug you're longing for  who's it for
for pity sake, god knows who
Nowhere to turn too  no one here that wants you
stay far away now way beyond normality
no one to talk too, talkin' cannot help you  stay far away now
you've stepped beyond reality
Where limitations have no place  the more extreme the more you do
you most certainly won't stand a chance  of pulling through
