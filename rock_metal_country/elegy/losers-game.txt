Influental called themselves friends  gifts they gave some kind of trend
a small town girl who never asked why  easy access cum' don't be shy
For no apparent reason  when the stakes were so high
she started to play the losers game
Common sense had... no place in their lives  we're not so bad is it a crime
cheap solution for the rich to get high  no restitution livin' a lie
They should have known better  not to turn a blind eye
instead they just left her to die
Fly, children in the sky  no escape unless you're willing to die
a price you'll pay, no other way  so why do ya wanna play it's losers game
The dealer always wins
Such potential could have gone far  her real firends cried
don't know who you are  they never got through  to save her in time
what else could they do  once she lost her mind
