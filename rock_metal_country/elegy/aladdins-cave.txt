Do you feel the way I feel  can you see things I see
does your body sometimes feel so cold  and empty
Cum take my hand we'll go far away  to a wonderland called Aladdins Cave
have no fear now, walk across the waves  abd discover how, how to be so brave
so brave
Don't be afraid, have no fear  you're not alone
mysterious ways, salvation is near  taking you home
Staring at the sun  makes you wild with rage
feel it urge you on, to Aladdin's Cave
Roaming far and wide, search into tomorrow
pilgrims seeking pride  stead of endless sorrow oh no!
Come, I can help you!
