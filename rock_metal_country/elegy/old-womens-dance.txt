The old dream of fear is back
Faces of old women along with it
You know
their naked reeking bodies Are dancing again like
the flames of fire

They know about you and your fear
Which creates them for you
Old women's eyes are glaring
Now glowing blood makes a move the flames to you

Hey, hey, turn your eyes to the fire, to the fire !

Hey, hey, turn your eyes to the fire, to the fire !

Dance like flames to dark night
Hey, hey, turn your eyes to the fire, to the fire !

Hey, hey, turn your eyes to the fire, to the fire !

Don't fear the beast in yourself !The devil entered them from the night
From the shadows of the trees
You know
their naked reeking bodies Are dancing again like
the flames of fire

They know about you and your fear
Which creates them for you
Old women's eyes are glaring
Now glowing blood makes a move the flames to you

Hey, hey, turn your eyes to the fire, to the fire !

Hey, hey, turn your eyes to the fire, to the fire !

Dance like flames to dark night
Hey, hey, turn your eyes to the fire, to the fire !

Hey, hey, turn your eyes to the fire, to the fire !

Don't fear the beast in yourself !
