You took the step and slipped away 
Enchanted by a friendly face 
You thought it was love 
It took your life out of your hands 
You never dreamt that it would ever and never end 
Bought and sold 
Should have seen it from the start 
He stole your love and broke your heart 
Love out on display 
Among your shattered dreams you stand 
Make a reason out of hollow words 
What's it worth 
Chorus 
Oh oh oh YouOll never be the same 
Put your trust on love 
You're not alone 
Oh oh oh I'll lighten up your darkest night 
Close your eyes 
I will be your day 
Seasons come and seasons go 
A miracle about to show 
Love will come around 
Put yourself back in the light 
Lose the shadows of your darkest night 
You'll be fine 
Chorus
