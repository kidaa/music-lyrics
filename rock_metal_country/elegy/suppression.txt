Take a good look around  tell us a truth now  what are they saying
they're out of all sight and sound  while the hatred is growing
the guilty are praying
Though innocent eyes don't lie  it's hopeless subscribing retaliation
enemies all must die  is this the road to hell and damnation
Won't somebody help them anymore  like a rock to the ground
they keep falling  just when they found a real sense of   Direction
We determine our own lives  with the power the strength to change them
but when manipulation plays a big part  then our future is gone
Suppression won't we bother  suppression  won't we show a little concern
repression won't we help each other  only if we can find the time my dear
So what lessons if any can be learnt  to help your sister to help your brother
or do we turn a blind eye  cos no one we know ever gets hurt
