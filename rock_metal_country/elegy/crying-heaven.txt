look at part of this Game
it's Simple and Impressive
Bitter Hopelessnes, Sad
I feel it all over my Body

Figure of Bird with Broken Wings
is looking Blue at Heaven
Flames are burning the Earth
and Scream broke the Curtain

God, don't hide your Look
Allow me to Fly up to Beams
Save me from Pain
I don't want to be burned in HellNothing of it is the Truth
Dream to Feel it
Metaphor for your Lonely Soul
there's FalseHood in the Truth

God, don't hide ...
Figure of a Bird ...
God, don't hide ...
