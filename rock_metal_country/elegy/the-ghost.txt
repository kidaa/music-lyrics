I'm your dumb voice
I'm a ghost from the dark
I'm a black mirror
I'm a river of time

His heart is made of stone
you're his grey tomb
He has no voice, laughing silently

Bloody tears fall down to the empty hands from the
strange eyes
Weeping is the dark, the light, the lie and the
grey shadows in the black mirrorNow he is you
your lies are his eyes
Eyes of the ghost from the dark
you are the ghost from the dark

I'm your dumb voice
I'm a ghost from the dark
I'm a black mirror
I'm a river of time

Bloody tears fall down to the empty hands from the
strange eyes
Weeping is the dark, the light, the lie and the
grey shadows in the black mirror
