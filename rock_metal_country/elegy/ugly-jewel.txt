Deranged for Strange Ways
you Wait for the Sign
every Crossroads are False
Ways are Closed and Cold
you Wait for the Sign
hidden with Bloody Hands

Restless as a Stream of mountain River
Imprisoned at Unknown World
Roar of Birds, Whisper of  Trees, Depressive
last powers are Drowning in Swamps

Wait for hidden Sign in Ugly Jewel
last Way is leading to Only Placeyou're a Running Man
all the Time through one's Place
vicious Circle, thousand Looks
through one's dusty Memory

Wait for hidden Sign in Ugly Jewel
last Way is leading to Only Place
