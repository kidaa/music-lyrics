The day the war was over, so the story goes
you could hear the churchbells ring  hear the laughter
but with hope and glory, lingers memories
in the dark a girl would dance  with her shadows
First she lose her father  in the burning debris
sorrow took her mother so castly  so she was
brought up in a house of strangers
Many years went by so her torment grew  a place where children mustn't cry
not a soul to talk too  she created her friends  through a roomlit view
hand in hand but never shy, the silent few
Locked in a room the walls were closing in
it shocked her system from within  so she lies staring at the images inside
Shadow dancer in the dark  it's O.K. to shed a tear
remember time to forget  shadow dancer in the dark
let the shadows disappear  shed a tear now, and time will do the rest
