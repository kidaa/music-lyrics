This is the last place on my way
I'm tired so much
When I see the moon for the last time
I'll lie down to frosty autumn leaves
and then ...
Like the shadow of my memory

Whenever in a dream you'll return to this place
Whenever you'll want, I'll come to you
Like the light cold touch of the autumn night

This is the last place on my way
I'm tired so much
When I see the moon for the last time
I'll lie down to frosty autumn leaves
and then ...
Like the shadow of my memoryBut now I want
I want to be alone
I feel the cold touch

This is the last place on my way
I'm tired so much
When I see the moon for the last time
I'll lie down to frosty autumn leaves
and then ...
Like the shadow of my memory

But now I want
I want to be alone
I feel the cold touch
