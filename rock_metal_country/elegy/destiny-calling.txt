My memories clear as ever of a little boy
I can see myself so full of wander  a child so full of joy
In a field oh way up yonder not so far  from home
lived a sweet old man called Mr.Wonder  because of dreams he told
He once so philosophically explained
there's a reason we're brought into this world
I wish he was with us today  pray hear me say I understand now
No matter how how hard we try  we never listen when destiny's calling
we still keep changing our lives  stop, look and listen
it's destiny calling you  when destiny's calling you
Looking back remissing changes long gone by
opportunities I keep on missing  I've stared 'em in the eye
The gravity of all my actions  I try hard to disguise
it became crystal clear we change the future  affecting all our lives
An old man philosophically explained
there's a reason we're brought into this world
Funny those words that he said  will always be true forever and ever
Each promise we break  the choice is yours and mine
each wrong move that we make  we're missing chances
each step with each day  will get harder, harder if we go our own way
