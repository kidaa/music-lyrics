The night that the eye of heaven shines 
Down mountains of hope and joy we glide 
The best wasn't good enough, all had to greed for more 
Took our hand and our soul as well; dwell in the dark 
Intrigued by a ghostly light divine 
Engaged in our bodily delight 
But we had to sail along, to where the story ends 
Took the time, just to find that there ain't no way back 
Chorus 
Who believes in reason, age of common sence 
Poisened hearts of black and white 
It's grey we are drowning in 
While chocking in tiny bits of life 
It's flashing in memories through our minds 
Why we had to sing the song, we knew was wrong inside 
Out of tune, there's no key to those who pray for you 
Chorus 
All our dreams, we left them for... 
Mysteries with velvet claws 
All that seemed right to need, 
it's gone
