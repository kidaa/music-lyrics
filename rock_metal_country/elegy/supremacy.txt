After you my dear, 
in mutial use we're one, you see 
You will know, how it feels to sing along, 
with angelsongs, and ride the glory winds 
Rule the tide 
lose all thats you, all you can memorize 
It's to bad, you're stuck in your stupidity 
Use your head, it's just a game of give and take 
Make your choice, it's joy versus reality 
In a dream a woman cried from high above 
Telling me In heaven they don't have enough 
Can't you see, weOre messengers of higher breed 
You and me, 
We're all that's left of men's supremacy 
Chorus 
Eyes behold; one of these days all my dreams'll enfold 
Lies scream; It's over...over... 
In return; for 'all the faith' that you had in me 
You all may dig your holes 
So in love my dear 
By my side, while I'm inside of you 
Yes it seems IOm seeing others down the side 
Don't blame me I'm far to sick to realize 
Seventeen, virginity on hand and knees 
Stick with me 
The needle shows just what you mean to me 
Chorus
