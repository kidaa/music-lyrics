Lyrics & vocal melody: Ian Parry
Captivated by his addiction for over indulgence, 
his abuse of people touches the very core 
of what mankind perceives as being uncivilised. 
Hatred, like an infection, spreads from one victim to another. 
The resulting factor is a broken spirit; a shadow of his former self. 
Suffocating in his own remorse, he fears the unexpected. 
His nervousness takes a form of it's own. 
It manifests and takes control. 
To him it's real. 
He's unaware that his mind has shut out his surroundings. 
Isolated and alone, he starts to fear, fear itself. 
Verse 
You know what they say, your many victims 
What comes around, goes around 
Over indulgence, uncivilized 
Uncertainty, created your discontentment
Bridge 
His spirit is broken, lives in a world unreal 
An infectious hatred 
See how it feels 
Now look at you
Chorus 
Manifestation of fear 
Man's own creation 
Manifestation of fear 
The mind's exaggeration
Verse 
First the unexpected, then the unexplained 
Being a victim, that makes him so afraid 
The resulting factor, his fear's coming alive 
Silently, he's slowly suffocating
Bridge 
His spirit is broken, lives in a world unreal 
Suffer gods children, see how it feels 
Now look at you
Repeat chorus
Middle-8 
Locked away, all alone 
He doesn't know what to expect 
Afraid of fear, fear itself 
To manifest, taking control
