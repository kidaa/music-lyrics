Flower black like my Blood
Flowering in my Heart
Heavily bowed to Ground
I feel smell of Cold

Picture rumpled in Memory
Nude of  Woman who I Know
lovely Nakedness of  Feelings
perfect Colours of Shapes

I'm standing face to face to this Nakedness
Seabreeze is worming through my Hair
I'm flying away to distant Lands of  Feelings
which are Spreading all over My BodyI'm watching the Sunset
Dead and Silent Glare
Rays are sliding on Waves
they don't Reach Coast

Sea is splitting my Thoughts
to Thousand Pieces by a Cliff
incoherent Shapes of Clouds
I'm Prisoner

I'm standing face to face ...
