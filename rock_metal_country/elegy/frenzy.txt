Lyrics & vocal melody: Ian Parry
Four walls, a ceiling, and a constant fear of the unknown. 
Driven by a mother's instinct to protect her child, 
her worst nightmares materialise before her very eyes.
Verse 
A constant fear she has 
A mother's instinct to protect 
His innocence her child, must not be influenced
Surreal nightmares they appear 
Before her very eyes 
The walls start closing in, then the madness begins
Bridge 
The consequences of her actions 
Into a life of stress he came
Chorus 
Frenzy, frenzy 
On the edge of a nervous breakdown 
A living hell, going crazy Frenzy, frenzy 
The unknown, eats your soul alive 
Your heart pounds, your blood is boiling
Verse 
In her chaotic mind 
The darkest secrets she would tell 
And smothered them with tales, 
Not for others
A psychological affect, she'd created 
Caused the child to change, he was never the same
Repeat bridge & chorus
Ad-libs 
All the king's horses and all the king's men 
Telling insane stories over again
