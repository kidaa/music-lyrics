The morning winds carries the guild of the night 
Hands it out and sighs, angel like faces conseal 
Masters and slaves, driven by the same 
Caught in a world built on lies, left to rhyme 
Given place and time, to fill up the gaps in your life 
Silence bears the shame 
Can you remember the time life was worth 
The beauty of the word 
No diamonds could steal it away 
It was your life you see, 
Forced into history, pushed back in time 
I am your destiny 
I feed you, disease you, I am your world 
Capture the spirit, so open your mind 
Listen to reason before you decide, 
Money won't buy all the things you desire 
The future lies wide open 
WAR Greed and illusions, all caught in the fight 
Darkness faces light 
Can you remember the time life was worth 
The struggle of a birth 
No demons could steal it away 
It was your life you see 
Forced into history, pushed back in time 
I am your destiny 
I feed you, decease you, I am your world 
Chorus 
Build your walls up high 
For angels grace you cry 
Capture the spirit, so open your mind 
Listen to reasons before you decide 
Money won't buy all the things you desire 
The future lies wide open 
FIGHT Fight of the fever 
The capitol guide 
It's not your life you see 
Let it be history, way back in time 
Love is your destiny 
It greeds you, it feeds you 
This is your world 
Chorus
