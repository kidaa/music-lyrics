I gave you freedom, don't hand me your pain 
A loversheart burning, now has vanished in the flames 
Our kind of love was to strange to comprehend 
It's beauty as fragile as circles in the sand 
Maybe one morning comes, 
and I can see it clearly in the sky 
Shining in my eyes 
Your soul is a temple, all secrets retained 
and why share your feelings when you have the world 
to blame 
Surrounded by water, your problems are oh so deep 
You're swimming a lifetime, 
but there ain't no land to see 
Maybe one morning comes 
and you can see it clearly in the sky 
Shining in your eyes 
Chorus 
I can see, but can you see 
I can hear reality, knocking upon my door 
Can't take it anymore, 
words left unspoken, not to return 
The mind is a weapon, a way to suppress 
But how can I blame you, for you had no place to crash 
Keep hope for the future and hold the strawend tight 
Defeat isn't final when there's still a way to fight 
And then the morning comes 
and you can see it clearly in the sky 
Shining in your eyes 
Chorus
