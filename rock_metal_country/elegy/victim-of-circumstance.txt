Music, lyrics & vocal melody: Ian Parry
Sadly his mother watches helplessly, 
as her child demolishes the very fabric she believes in. 
Catching an occasional glimpse, she remembers with great pain, 
the anguish she felt, as the memories from her past re-appear. 
Frustration turns to confused anger. 
She still can't come to terms with the fact 
that her husband took his own life. 
"Why", she asks herself, "why didn't he tell me? 
Why couldn't anybody lend him a helping hand?" 
All the while her son is silently crying out for help.
Intro 
Looking back in time, 
Without consent. 
two lovers ran away 
A tragic tale, so often made 
So sad and destined to fail
Verse 
They're in and out of every place 
Searchin' hard a sad disgrace 
At best a darkened room, without a view 
Those memories, still remain 
Never once did she complain 
Now time repeats itself, all over again
Bridge 
What he did, was insane 
Sadly his own life he'd take 
And you've been left to face the guilt, alone
Chorus 
Just try to remember 
He was a victim of circumstance 
Close your eyes, try to recall 
The strength you felt 
Now, is the time to be stronger 
Than you've ever been before 
Bury all your anguish and fear, you're not to blame
Verse 
Don't analyze, come to terms 
Face the truth, don't turn away 
Where there's a will, there has to be a way 
Into the world, your child came 
Responsibility or shame 
He backed away from you, don't lose him again
Ad-libs 
You're not alone! you've got to be stronger
