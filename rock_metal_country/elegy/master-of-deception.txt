Music, lyrics & vocal melody: Ian Parry
Obsessed with dominance, 
he crushes each person who innocently crosses his path. 
His adrenalin thrives on a need to destroy basis. 
His skill to deceive gains him vast wealth and fortune. 
However any trace of his original character 
or identity vanishes into oblivion.
Verse 
No compromise, no words can make him see 
He's elevated to a higher level
To feed a need, let the adrenalin flow 
A warped sensation, deceit is blissful
Bridge 
Mystified by lies, demoralizing 
No second glance, face to face 
Thru' those naked eyes, captivating 
He'll suck you dry, and leave no trace
Chorus 
Once inside your head, the captive mind his game 
Manipulates his way, terrorizing 
Secrets kept alive, subconscious thoughts awake 
Watch him take control, hypnotizing
Verse 
A master of, pure deception 
His testimony that, that he's a freak of nature
Repeat bridge & chorus
Ad-libs 
Take a look into those eyes 
And I can tell you what you'll see
