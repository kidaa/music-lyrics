Alright then. Picture this if you will.

Grabbed at 2 A.M. and actually eating a box of Krispy Kremes.
I might need as I approach site area 51
contemplating the whole chosen people thinking we just took
A flaming stealth banana split the sky
like wide open
I never expected to see it in a place like this.
I do believe I spilled a diet soda
Or something wet on my Birkenstocks
And I'm yelping:
Holy fucking shit! [x8]

Let the X-file be entered
As some kind of blue-green jet ship
With Isabella Rossellini lips with breath that reeked,
And they're wicked-shot terrorists all by making the sound
Abananadabanana

So when I opened up my bug eyes,
My gaping jaw and my sweaty L. Ron Hubbard upper lip
and all I could think was
I hope that my partner here doesn't notice
that I pissed my fucking pants

So alive in this way.
Like an apparition he had me crying out.

Fuck me.
It's got to be
Dead head chemistry.
The blotter got on top of me
Got me seeing E. - motherfucking - T.

And after calming me down with some orange slices and some needle spooning.
E.T. revealed to me a singular purpose,
He said 'You are the chosen one'.
The one who will deliver the message.
A message of hope for those who choose to hear it
And a warning for those who do not.
Me? The chosen one,
They chose me.
And I didn't graduate from fucking high school.

You better.
You better.
You better.
You better listen.

When he looked right through me
With somniferous almond eyes.
Don't even know what that means
Must remember to write it down.
This is so real.
Like the time he floated away.
See my heart is pounding,
'Cause this shit never happens to me.

Can't breathe, right now!
It was so real.
Like I woke up in Wonderland.
All sort of terrifying.
And I don't wanna be all alone when I tell this story.
And can anyone tell me why
It was a repeat experience
Will I ever be coming down?
This is so real.
Finally it's my lucky day.
See my heart is racing,
'Cause this shit never happens to me.

Can't breathe, right now!

You believe me, don't you?
Please believe what I just said, see they're telling true.
And this wasn't all in my head.
See they took me by the hand and invited me right in,
Then they showed me something.
I don't even know where to begin.

STRAPPED DOWN MY BED. FEET COLD AND EYES RED.
I'M OUT MY HEAD. AM I ALIVE, AM I DEAD?
CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT THEY SAID.
GOD DAMN. SHIT THE BED!

high... I I I I I... high... I I I I I
high
[repeated]

Overwhelmed as one would be, placed in my position.
Such a heavy burden now to be the one.
Born to bear and ready to all
The details of our ending.
To write it down for all the world to see.
But I forgot my pen,
Shit the bed again,
Typical.

STRAPPED DOWN MY BED. FEET COLD AND EYES RED.
I'M OUT MY HEAD. AM I ALIVE, AM I DEAD?
SUNKIST AND SUDAFED, GYROSCOPES AND INFRARED.
WON'T HELP, BRAIN DEAD.
CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT THEY SAID.
GOD DAMN SHIT THE BED!

I...!!!

CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT THEY SAID TO ME.
CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT THEY SAID TO ME.
MADE OUT TO BE, A HERO!!!
Can't remember what they said.

OH NO, HELP NOW.
Can't remember what they said.

DON'T KNOW.
WON'T KNOW.
[repeated]

GOD DAMN SHIT THE BED!
