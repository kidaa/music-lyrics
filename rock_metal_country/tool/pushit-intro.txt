[Maynard's monologue:]

We've been trying something
a little different this tour.
We've been looking at 
one of our songs
from a different angle,
under a different light,
so we can hopefully kind of
see it almost for the first time.
We'd like try that for you tonight, is that okay

We're gonna need your help though.
We're gonna need your help
and your permission,
so we need you to find
a comfortable space,
that is not only comfortable,
but vulnerable.
I want you to shut your eyes and go there,
and we'll meet you on the other side..
