Here I come again now, baby
Like a dog in heat
Tell it's me by the clamor now, baby
I like to tear up the street
And I been smokin' for so long
Ya know I'm here to stay
Got you in a stranglehold, baby
You best get outta the way

Road I cruise is a bitch now baby
But no, you can't turn me round
And if a house gets in my way, baby
Ya know I'm tearing it down
You ran the night that you left me
You put me in my place
I got you in a stranglehold, baby
Then I crushed your face.

Sometimes you wanna start higher
And sometimes you gotta start low
Some people think they gonna die someday
I got news, ya never got to go

C'mon, c'mon up...

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon baby
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon up
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon baby
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon

Road I cruise is a bitch now
Ya know ya can't turn me round
And if a house gets in my way
Ya know I'm burnin' it down
Ya ran the night that you left me
You put me in my place
I got you in a stranglehold, baby
Then I crushed your face.
