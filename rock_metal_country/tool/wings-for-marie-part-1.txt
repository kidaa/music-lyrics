You believed.
You believed in moments not conceived. 
You believed in me. 

A passionate spirit.
Uncompromise.
Without us in your heart.
A light in your eyes that, ends all lies.

Vacant, broken. 
Fell at the hands of 
Those moments that I wouldn't see.
Cause it was you who prayed for me so. 
What have I done to be a son to an angel?
What have I done to be worthy?

Day light dims leaving cold fluorescence.
Difficult to see you in this light.
Please forgive this selfish question, but
What am I to say to all these ghouls tonight?

She never told a lie.
Well might of told a lie.
But never lived one.
Didn't have a life.
Didn't have a life.
But surely saved one.
Saved on.

Alright, now it's time for us to let you go.
