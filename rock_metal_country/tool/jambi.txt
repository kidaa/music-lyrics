Here from the king's mountain view 
Here from the wild dream come true 
Feast like a sultan I do 
On treasures and flesh, never few. 

But I, I would wish it all away. 
If I thought I'd Lose you just one day. 

The devil and his had me down, 
in love with the dark side I'd found. 
Dabble in all the way down 
up to my neck soon to drown. 

But you changed that all for me. 
Lifted me up, turned me round. 
So I...
I... 
I... 
I... 
I would 
I would 
I would 
Wish this all away 

Prayed like a father dusk to dawn. 
Beg like a hooker all night long. 
Tempted the devil with my song. 
And got what I wanted all along. 

But I, 
And I would, 
If I could, 
And I would, 
Wish it away, 
Wish it away, 
Wish it all away, 
Wanna wish it all away, 
No prize that could hold sway, 
Or justify my giving away, 
my center. 

So if I could I'd wish it all away. 
If I thought tomorrow would take you away. 
You're my peace of mind, my home, my center. 
I'm just trying to hold on, 
One more day. 

Dim my eyes...
Dim my eyes...

Dim my eyes if they should compromise 
our fulcrum what you need divides me then 
I might as well be gone. 

Shine on forever. 
Shine on benevolent son. 

Shine down upon the broken. 
Shine until the two become one. 

Shine on forever. 
Shine on benevolent son. 

Shine on upon the severed. 
Shine until the two become one. 

Divided I'm withering away. 

Divide and I'm withering away. 

Shine on upon the many, light our way 
Benevolent son. 

Breathe in union. 
Breathe in union. 
Breathe in union. 
Breathe in union. 
Breathe in union. 
So as one survive. 
Another day and season. 

Silence leech, and save your poison. 
Silence leech, and stay out of my way.
