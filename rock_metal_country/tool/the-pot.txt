Who are you to wave your finger?
Ya' must have been out your hair.
Eye hole deep in muddy waters.
You practically raised the dead.

Rob the grave, to snow the cradle.
Then burn the evidence down.
Soapbox, house of cards, and glass,
So don't go tossin' your stones around.

You must have been high.
You must have been high.
You must have been.

Foot in mouth, and head up asshole.
Whatcha talkin' 'bout?
Difficult to dance 'round this one
'til you pull it out, boy!

You must have been, so high.
You must have been, so high.

Steal, borrow, refer, save your shady inference.
King Guru done hung the juror with the innocent.

Now you're weeping shades of chosen indigo
Got lemon juice up in your...EYE!

When you pissed all over my black kettle
You must have been HIGH, HIGH
You must have been HIGH, HIGH

Who are you to wave your finger?
So full of it.
Eyeballs deep in muddy waters
Fuckin' hypocrite.

Liar, lawyer, mirror, show me.
What's the difference?

King Guru done hung the guilty with the innocent.

NOW!!
You'll weep or, change the chosen into gold.
Got lemon juice up in your high eye.
When you pissed all over my black kettle
You musta been!

So who are you to wave your finger?
Who are you to wave your fatty finger at me?
You must, have been, out your, mind!

Reefer chased off indigo
Trapped without a reason
Reefer chased off indigo

Liar, lawyer,
Mirror for ya,
What's the difference?
King Guru be stoned
He's guilty as the government

NOW!!
Will you weep or, change the chosen into gold
Got lemon juice up in your, EYE!!
EYE!!

Now when you pissed all over my black kettle.
You musta been HIGH, HIGH, HIGH, HIGH.
Eyeballs deep in muddy waters
Your're balls deep in muddy waters.
Ganja Police, you must, have been, out your MIND!!!!
