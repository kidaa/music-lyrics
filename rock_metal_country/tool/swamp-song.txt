My warning meant nothing.
You're dancing in quicksand.
Why don't you watch where you're wandering
Why don't you watch where you're stumbling
You're wading knee deep and going in.
And you may never come back again.

This bog is thick and easy to get lost in
when you're a stupid,dumb ass, beligerant fucker.

I hope it sucks you down.

Wander in and wandering.
Noone even invited you in.
But still you stumble in stumbling.
So suffocate
or get out while you can.

Noone told you to come.

I hope it sucks you down.
