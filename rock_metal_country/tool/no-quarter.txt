Lock the door, kill the light.
No one's coming home tonight.
The sun beats down and don't you know
All our lives are growing cold, oh...
They bring news that must get through.
To build a dream for me and you, oh.

Locked in a place where no one goes.

They ask no quarter
They have no quarter.

Lock the door, kill the light
No one's coming home tonight

It's getting colder [7x]
Locked in a place where no one goes.

Lock the door, kill the light
No one's coming home tonight

They bring news that must get through.

Locked in a place where no one goes.

We have no quarter
We have no quarter
We ask no quarter
