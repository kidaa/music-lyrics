I've got the demons within
I've got to brush them all away
I feel the demon's rage
I must clean them all away
Yeah, yeah...

Excite to scream them away
Cobwebs in the way
That magic cleaner oh
Shine his smile on me
Yeah, yeah...

I am the demon
Cleaner who saves the day
I get the backwall
And important they'll always stay
Yeah, yeah...

If only one thing that you know
Imposters from the show
They'll try to trick you into
Normal treatment
Oh don't you listen to them say
Shush them all away
I am the demon cleaner
Madman so
I am the freedom cleaner
Standing naked here to say
I'm the only way...
