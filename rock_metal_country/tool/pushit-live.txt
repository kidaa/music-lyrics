We've been trying something
a little different this tour.
We've been looking at
one of our songs
from a different angle,
under a different light,
so we can hopefully kind of
see it almost for the first time.
We'd like try that for you tonight, is that okay

We're gonna need your help though.
We're gonna need your help
and your permission,
so we need you to find
a comfortable space,
that is not only comfortable,
but vulnerable.
I want you to shut your eyes and go there,
and we'll meet you on the other side..

Saw that gap again today.
While you were begging me to stay.
Take care not to make me enter.
If I do we both may disappear.

Saw that gap again today.
While you were begging me to stay
Managed to push myself away
And you as well, my dear
And you, as well
Pushed you away my dear

I will choke until I swallow
Choke this infant here before me
What are you but my reflection
Who am I to judge or strike you down

But you're pushing me
And Im shoving you
And your pushing me
And Im shoving you

Rest your trigger on my finger,
Bang my head upon the fault line
You better take care not to make me enter
If I do we both may disappear

But you're pushing me
And Im shoving you
And your pushing me
And Im shoving you

You still love me

We're pushing and were shoving
And you're pushing and I'm shoving

You still love me

And were pushing and were shoving
And I'm pushing as your shoving

And Im slipping back into the gap again
I feel alive when you touch me...
I feel alive when you hold me...
...down

Slipping back into you

I am somewhere I dont wanna be, yeah
Put me somewhere I dont wanna be
Push me somewhere I dont wanna be
Seeing someplace I don't wanna see
Never wanna see that place again...

Saw that gap again today
While you were begging me to stay
Managed to push myself away,
And you as well, my dear

If, when I say I may fade like a sigh if I stay,
You minimize my movement anyway,
I must persuade you another way

Pushing and Shoving and
Pushing and Shoving and
Pushing me

There's no love in fear.

Staring down the hole again.
Hands are on my back again.
Survival is my only friend.
Terrified of what may come.

Remember I will always love you,
As I claw your fucking throat away.
It will end no other way.
