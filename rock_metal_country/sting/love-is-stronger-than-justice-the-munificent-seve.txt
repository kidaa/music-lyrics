This is a story of seven brothers
 We had the same father but different mothers
 We keep together like a family should
 Roaming the country for the common good
 It came to pass one fateful day
 We found ourselves down Mexico way
 The town, the mayor, the P.T.A.
 Pleading on their knees with us all to stay

 We'd only stopped for a few burritos
 But they told us of the trouble with los banditos
 A poor little town in need of aid
 My brothers and me had never been afraid
 The age of chivalry is not dead
 Lonesome nights in a cowboy bed
 There'd be a bride for every man
 Who chased away the evil gang
 Love is stronger than justice
 Love is thicker than blood
 Love, love, love is stronger than justice
 Love is a big fat river in flood

 The outcome was predictable
 Our banditos were despicable
 Of blood we lost a dozen litres
 A small price to pay for los seoritas
 The town mayor was happy, but his face was glum
 The maidens numbered only one
 There weren't seven brides for seven brothers
 I knew I had to get rid of the others
 Love is stronger than justice
 Love is thicker than blood
 Love, love, love is stronger than justice
 Love is a big fat river in flood

 Mother told me I was the clever one
 The seventh son of a seventh son
 It all ended so happily
 I settled down with the family
 I look forward to a better day
 But ethical stuff never got in my way
 And though there used to be brothers seven
 The other six are singing in heaven
 For love is stronger than justice
 Love is thicker than blood
 Love, love, love is stronger than justice
 Love is a big fat river in flood

 Love is stronger than justice
 Love is thicker than blood
 Love, love, love is stronger than justice
 Love is a big fat river in flood
 Love is a big fat river in flood
