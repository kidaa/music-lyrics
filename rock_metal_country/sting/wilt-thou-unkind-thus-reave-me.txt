Wilt thou unkind thus reave me 
Of my heart, of my heart, 
And so leave me, and so leave me? 

Wilt thou unkind thus reave me 
Of my heart, of my heart, 
And so leave me, and so leave me? 

Farewell! Farewell! 
But yet or e'er I part, O cruel, 
Kiss me, sweet, kiss me, 
Sweet, sweet my jewel. 

Hope by disdain grows cheerless, 
Fear doth love, love doth fear 
Beauty peerless, beauty peerless. 

Farewell! Farewell! 
But yet or e'er I part, O cruel, 
Kiss me, sweet, kiss me, 
Sweet, sweet my jewel. 

If no delayes can move thee, 
Life shall die, death shall live 
Still to love thee, still to love thee? 

Farewell! Farewell! 
But yet or e'er I part, O cruel, 
Kiss me, sweet, kiss me, 
Sweet, sweet my jewel. 

Yet be thou mindfull ever, 
Heat from fire, fire from heat 
None can see sever, none can sever 

Farewell! Farewell! 
But yet or e'er I part, O cruel, 
Kiss me, sweet, kiss me, 
Sweet, sweet my jewel. 

True love cannot be changed 
Though delight from desert 
Be estranged, be estranged. 

Farewell! Farewell! 
But yet or e'er I part, O cruel, 
Kiss me, sweet, kiss me, 
Sweet, sweet my jewel.
