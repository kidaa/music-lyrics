Weep you no more, sad fountains; 
What need you flow so fast? 
Look how the snowy mountains 
Heav'n's sun doth gently waste. 
But my sun's heav'nly eyes 
View not your weeping 
That now lies sleeping, 
Softly, softly, now softly lies sleeping. 

Sleep is a reconciling, 
A rest that Peace begets. 
Doth not the sun rise smiling 
When fair at e'en he sets 
Rest you then, rest, sad eyes, 
Melt not in weeping 
While she lies sleeping, 
Softly, softly, now softly lies sleeping.
