Words and lyrics by Bob Marley 

Get up, stand up 
Stand up for your right 
Get up, stand up 
Don't give up the fight 
Get up, stand up 
Stand up for your right 
Get up, stand up 
Don't give up the fight 

Preacherman don't tell me, heaven is under the earth 
I know, you don't know, what life is really worth 
If all that glitters was gold 
Heard the story which never been told 
Now you see the light 
So get up for your rights 

Get up stand up 
Sit up for your right 
Get up stand up 
Don't give up the fight 
Get up stand up 
Stand up for your right 
Get up stand up 
Don't give up the fight 

Well people say: a great God will come from the sky 
Take away everything 
And make everybody feel high 
If you know what life is worth 
You will look to yours on earth 
And now you see the light 
Stand up for your rights 

Get up, stand up 
Get up, stand up 
Stand up for your right 
Stand up for your right 
Get up, stand up 
Get up, stand up 
Don't give up the fight 
People don't people done 
Get up, stand up 
Stand up for your right sit Up 
Get up, stand up 
Don't give up the fight 

I'm sick and tired of 
The same of shame of thing 
Die and go to heaven in Jesus' name 
Cause we know and we understand 
That a mighty God is a livin man 
Be so clear for sometime 
But you cannot fool all the people all the time 
Now you see the light 
So get up for your rights 

Get up stand up 
Get up stand up 
Stand up for your rights 
Stand up for your rights 
Get up stand up 
Get up stand up 
Don't give up the fight 
Don't give up the fight 
Weeeooo 
We won't give up the fight 
Don't give up the fight 
Weeeooo 
We won't give up the fight 
Don't give up the fight
