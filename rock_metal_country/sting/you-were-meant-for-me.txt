Words and music by Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed 

Life was a song 
You came along 
I lay awake the whole night through 

If I should dare 
To think you care 
This is what I'd say to you 

You were meant for me 
And I was meant for you 

Nature fashioned you 
And when she was done 
You were all those good things 
Rolled into one 

You're like a plaintive melody 
That never lets me be 
I'm content the angels must have sent you 
And they meant you just for me 

You're like a plaintive melody 
That never lets me be 
I'm content the angels must have sent you 
And they meant you just for me
