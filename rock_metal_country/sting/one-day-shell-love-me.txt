I'd never imagined before 
That the world could be turned on it's head 
I'd never have thought 
To be here in this place 
I'd never have dreamt that in love 
I'd be lost and so easily led 
I guess I was caught 
By that hint of a smile on her face 

I thought I was happy 
When my life was as easy as pie 
But that was the past 
Of an ignorant youth 
I'm falling in love with the girl 
But I'm forced to be living a lie 
And she'd never love mew d 
If she knew the truth 

Is it asking too much 
If I pray for a miracle, miracle 
That one day she'll love me 
One day she'll say I care 

Although he's changing day by day 
He finds these tender words of love 
Impossible to say 
He walks in the room 
And I'm never quite sure 
If he's trying to be somebody else 
I'm liking him better that he's 
Not his arrogant self 
Perhaps I'm expecting too much 
Of a miracle, miracle 
One day he'll love mew d 
One day he'll say I love you 
And I will love him until I die 

Distant Star 
Cast your light 
On my life 

And one by one 
I didn't anticipate feeling the power of love 
In this way 

And day by dayw d 
We've never been closer than this 
And I find myself daring to pray 

We'll find these tender ways of love 
Impossible to disobeyw d 

One day she'll love me 

One day he'll say I love you 

And I will love her 

Until the moment 
Our hearts stop beating 
And we are light
