By Pablo Neruda 

Naked, you are simple as one of your hands, 
smooth, earthy, small, transparent, round: 
you have moon-lines, apple-pathways: 
naked, you are slender as a naked grain of wheat. 

Naked, you are blue as a night in Cuba; 
you have vines and stars in your hair; 
naked, you are spacious and yellow 
as summer in a golden church. 

Naked, you are tiny as one of your nails- 
curved, subtle, rosy, till the day is born 
and you withdraw to the underground world, 

as if down a long tunnel of clothing and of chores: 
your clear light dims, gets dressed - drops its leaves- 
and becomes a naked hand again.
