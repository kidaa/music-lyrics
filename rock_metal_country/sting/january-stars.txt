Ten below and falling fast 
Those days of summer were long past 
My horoscope said you'd come back 
I have my doubts, you see 

And as I watched the mercury 
And thought about the prophecy 
A new moon and an early thaw 
I watched the door for you 

If January stars came true 

And as I gaze at winter stars 
The second house conjunct with Mars 
They would suggest that we'll be one 
I have my doubts, you see 

If I maintain a skeptic's eye 
And train the other on the sky 
I'd eat my hat if it came true 
I'd prob'ly eat yours, too 

If January stars came true 
If January stars came true 

Now I'm in a pretty mess 
It's getting warmer, I confess 
My horoscope said you'd come back 
I have my doubts, it's true 

And as I watched the mercury 
And thought about the prophecy 
A new moon and an early thaw 
I left the door for you 

If January stars, 
If January stars came true
