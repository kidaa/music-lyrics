I've been working too hard at the office all year 
I've been saving all my days for a break 
And I've got to get away with my baby for a time 
If it's just for my sanity's sake 

Nothing but work and never to play 
Make Jack a dull boy or so they say 
And nothing in the world gonna make me stay 
I've just got to get away for a day 

Oh the smog in the city is clogging up my head 
And the noise of the traffic and the poison lead 
Too many people I must confess 
I'm looking for the cure of terminal stress 

Take me to the sunshine 
Take me to the sun 

It's a perfect paradise and it ain't no trick 
You can walk, you can run, play golf 'til you're sick 
Swim all day, you can dance all night 
You can ever fall in love if you're feeling right 

The surf will roar and the birds will sing 
And the warm wind sighs as you practice your swing 
And the cares of the world will fade away as you 
Watch the sun setting on a golden bay 

They say that modern man needs to find himself 
And what's bad for his spirit is bad for his health 
And when the world's used up and there's nowhere else 
You'll realize Mother Nature is the Commonwealth 

Take me to the sunshine 
Take me to the sun 
Take me to the sun 

Take me to the sunshine 
Take me to the sun 
Take me to the sun 

I've been working too hard at the office all year 
I've been saving all my days for a break 
And I've got to get away with my baby for a time 
If it's for my sanity's sake
