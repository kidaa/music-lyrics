I cannot get to my love if I would die; 
For the water of Tyne runs between her and me 
And here I must stand with a tear in my 'ee, 
Both sighing and sickly, my sweetheart to see.

And here I must stand with a tear in my 'ee, 
Both sighing and sickly, my sweetheart to see. 

Oh, where is the boatman, my bonny hinney? 
Oh, where is the boatman? Bring him to me 
To ferry me over the Tyne to my honey 
And I will remember the boatman and thee. 

Oh, bring me a boatman, I'll give any money 
And you for your trouble rewarded shall be 
To ferry me over the Tyne to my honey 
Or scull her across the rough river to me.
