Words by Harry Tobias, music by Charles Kisco 

It's a lonesome old town 
When you're not around 

I'm lonely as I can be 
I never knew how much I'd miss you 
But now I can plainly see 

It's a lonesome old town 
When you're not around 
How I wish you'd come back to me 
How I wish you'd come back to me 
How I wish you'd come back to me 
Lonesome old town 
Lonesome, lonesome old town 
It's a lonesome old town
