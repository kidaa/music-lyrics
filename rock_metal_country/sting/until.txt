Words and music by Sting 

If I caught the world in a bottle 
And everything was still beneath the moon 
Without your love would it shine for me? 
If I was smart as Aristotle 
And understood the rings around the moon 
What would it all matter if you loved me? 

Here in your arms where the world is impossibly still 
With a million dreams to fulfill 
And a matter of moments until the dancing ends 
Here in your arms when everything seems to be clear 
Not a solitary thing would I fear 
Except when this moment comes near the dancing's end 

If I caught the world in an hourglass 
Saddled up the moon so we could ride 
Until the stars grew dim, Until... 

One day you'll meet a stranger 
And all the noise is silenced in the room 
You'll feel that you're close to some mystery 
In the moonlight and everything shatters 
You feel as if you've known her all your life 
The world's oldest lesson in history 

Here in your arms where the world is impossibly still 
With a million dreams to fulfill 
And a matter of moments until the dancing ends 
Here in your arms when everything seems to be clear 
Not a solitary thing do I fear 
Except when this moment comes near the dancing's end 

Oh, if I caught the world in an hourglass 
Saddled up the moon and we would ride 
Until the stars grew dim 
Until the time that time stands still, Until...
