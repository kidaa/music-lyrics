Words and music by Fleetwood Mac 

Note: Fleetwood Mac and Sting sing different lyrics. 

Sting's version: 
Need some one's hands to help me through the night 
Need some one's arms to hold and squeeze me tight 
'Cause when the night begins and I'm at an end 
That's when I need your love so bad 

Need your sweet voice to whisper in my ear 
Need your gentle fingertips babe to wipe away my tears 
Cause when the lights are low and it's time to go 
That's when I need your love so bad 

Why don't you give it up 
And bring it all back home to me baby 
write it on a piece of me paper 
So it can be read to me 
Tell me that you love me 
Cause you're allmost driving me mad 
Oh, because I need, I need your love so bad 

Need your sweet voice to help me through the night 
You don't have to worry baby 
Cause you know everything is gonna be all right 
When the lights are low and it's time to go 
That's when I need your love so bad 

I need.... solo 

Why don't you give it up 
And bring it all back home to me baby 
Write it on a piece of me paper 
So it can be read to me 
Tell me that you love me 
Cause you're allmost driving me mad 
Oh, because I need, I need your love so bad 

Need your sweet lipos to help me through the night 
You don't have to worry baby 
Cause you know everything is gonna be all right 
Listen to my plea bring it to me 

Because I need your love so bad
