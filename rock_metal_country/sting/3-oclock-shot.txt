Everyone I know is lonely 
My God's so far away 
And my heart belongs to no one 
So now sometimes I pray 
Please take this space between us 
And fill it up some way 
I've been waiting for my brothers 
Since fucking Christmas day 

There's a song that everyone's heard 
Let me hear it, make me a part 
Songs everyone's heard 
Let me hear it, make me a part 

Nothing seems to matter 
To no one anymore 
They say my world is shattered 
I just did it on the floor 
It won't go no further 
It is here I make my stand 
If you say my life is precious 
When you held it in your hand 

There's a song that everyone's heard 
Let me hear it, make me a part 
Songs everyone's heard 
Let me hear it, make me a part 

There's a song that everyone's heard 
Let me hear it, make me a part 
Songs everyone's heard 
Let me hear it, make me a part
