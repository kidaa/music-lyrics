Room 17 was nice and cool, oh yeah
A few stains on the wall
But that was nothing new to Harry's head
Even though he was strapped down to his bed, strapped down
Harry felt pretty good...
Knock, knock ... knock, knock, Is anybody there
Room 17 was nice and cool, oh yeah
But it didn't have the string
That would ring the nurse, it wasn't there
Poor Harry, he had it coming, Poor Harry
Now he didn't feel so good...
Solo: Simonsen
Here comes Doctor Eastmann and Nursie Needle Dear
Look at what they got you ... The CRAWLY BOX
NURSE NEEDLE : Don't be such a baby, Harry stop that now
The doctor's here to help you ... it's Eastmann time
In room 17, everything is so clean
In room 17, there is nothing to be seen
Dr. EASTMANN : Black, brown, grey and hairy... we've got them all
Big, small, fast and scary... yeah we've got them all
I can hear it, the Spider's Lullabye
I can feel it, the Spiders crawl on by
In room 17, everything is so clean
In room 17, there is nothing to be seen
Dr. EASTMANN : Nurse Needle it is time to begin...
Nurse Needle, stick it in
A brown Lycosa's what I've got inside this box
I'm gonna let him out to see just how you feel, when he's around
If you move too much he might just bite you
But we'll just have to wait and see about that ... ?
Solo: La Rocque
Deep into the night, they were testing him
So many different species, Harry could not win
Solo: Simonsen
They forgot a grey one, she was full of eggs
And she would find the warm spot, back in Harry's neck
It's so moist and warm in here
Knock, knock... knock, knock, Is anybody there
HARRY : You forgot some spiders in my room, yesterday
Now I've got this stunning pain
And my neck is feeling weird, Oh I might die
Overnight some of your spiders must have bit me
They were all over me
Dr. EASTMANN : Oh Harry, don't be such a fool
That same night Harry died
When they found him he was grey and white
Solo: La Rocque
Black, brown, grey and hairy... we've got them all
Big, small, fast and scary... yeah we've got them all
I can hear it, the Spider's Lullabye
I can feel it, the Spiders crawl on by
In room 17, everything it so clean
In room 17, there is nothing to be seen
Solo: Simonsen
In room 17, everything is so clean
In room 17, there is nothing to be seen
Take him to the morgue, Take him to the morgue
