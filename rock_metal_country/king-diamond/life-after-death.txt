Diamond/Diamond
Friday night
Four shadows heading for the dark
Four shadows heading for the past
Four shadows heading for the graves in the wooded maze
Four shadows looking for the place without a trace
Midnight and they're here, midnight
The old burial ground..is part of the estate
Hidden by the heavy trees..where Jean le Noir he sleeps
The shadows move
There're here to feed the dead..the shadows move
Cause there is life after death
Be patient and you will see
Cause there is life after death
Be patient and you will see
Oh it must never end..never end..no
Solo: Herb
Midnight and there're here, midnight
Doctor le Croix, he's a voodoo sorcerer
Madame Sarita, she's got the snake in her
And Lula Chevalier, she's girl that no one ever sees
Salem the servant, he belongs to the estate
The sadows move
Ther're here to feed the dead...the shadows move
Solo: Andy
The Lafayettes are unaware..their butler Salem, he is here
Voodoo has been his life..Voodoo cuts deep like a knife
The sadows move
Ther're here to feed the dead...the shadows move
Cause there is life after death
Be patient and you will see
Cause there is life after death
Be patient and you will see
Oh it must never end..never end
Midnight and there're here, midnight
Midnight.....Life after death.....
