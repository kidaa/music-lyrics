"Jeanne Dibasson, You stand accused before the burning court for practicing
witchcraft. Do You confess? We have ways to make you talk. How do You plead?
Jeanne:
"I never did any harm to anyone. I don't believe this."

"Never did I lie with beast of thine gods, or cats or goats, now leave My
soul alone"
La Reymie:
"He that sacrificeth unto the god save the lord only he shall be utterly
destroyed"
