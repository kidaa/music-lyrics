Music and lyrics by King Diamond
Some would say there is trouble in my home
Even when I am alone
Some would say there is always someone home
Even though I might be gone
Speak to be my friend, I know you're there
Speak to be my friend... speak to me... SPEAK TO ME !
I can always feel it's there, creeping one step behind me
Cold hands in the night, I know that it's watching me
The Poltergeist living in my home
Could be a friend or a foe
The Poltergeist living in my home
Could be a friend for life or a foe until the night I die
Speak to me my friend, let me hear your tongue
I don't like most of those you invite... Get them out, GET THEM OUT !
Solos: Simonsen - La Rocque
Speak to me my friend, I know you're there
Speak to me my friend, speak to me... SPEAK TO ME !
My guests can never tell, when it's creeping up to touch them
They will never ever know our game
Until they feel it and scream
The Poltergeist living in my home
Could be a friend of a foe
The Poltergeist living in my home
Could be a friend for life or a foe until the night I die
Speak to me my friend, we are one and the same
Now that you're living here... Welcome home... Welcome home
You can stay forever
