Monday evening
Evening, the sun is setting, silence is all you hear
David, getting really sick he is sweating like a pig
The fever's got him now
And Sarah's father dear, the morning snack has put him on his back
He should have stayed in bed..oh why didn't he?
...The sun is setting, silence is all you hear
Sarah: "Salem, what's going on?"
Salem: "Let me tell you a story Madame, a secret about your land
The reason... for all madness
Let me tell you a story Madame, the burial ground on your land
Ia a secret voodoo stand
If you ever destroy this sacred place
Legend says that you will die, and never find your rest
I'm telling the truth...Oh yes I am
If the living can't feed the dead, then the dead will come for you
Yeah
Sarah: "You better hold your tongue now Salem
Cause I don't believe in ghosts"
There is only one thing left to do now
And that is "Sending of Dead"
The four shadows are meeting again
At the cemetery gates, darkness is a friend
Midnight will soon be here
Everything should be ready by now...for "Sending of Dead"
Solo: Andy
Place the image of Saint Expedit
Upside down and around
I hear Doctor le Croix speaking
"Let the ritual begin"
"Almight God, father of mine, come for Sarah Lafayette
That she may be "Disappeared", forever lost
Saint Expedit, you are a saint and I'm a sinner
I send you to find...Sarah Lafayette
Oh, ride me of her head and rid me of her soul
Rid me of all her thoughts, rid me of her memory
For this curse to work, Baron Samedi, Samedi, Samedi
Send your blessing, so Sarah may be gone"
Solo: Herb
As if he was sent from the sky, Baron Samedi creeps inside
The Doctor's body..speaking to Salem
Samedi:"You must bring me a sacrifice
You must come back before midnight
Kneel before my cross"...Salem is here
He takes a handful of soil from each grave
Of the dead he wants to send..into Sarah
Now quick quick run back to the HOUSE
The soil must lie where sarah sleeps
