Andy La Rocque, Snowy Shaw
Madeleine is running away from herself
Afraid of the shame, she's crying out for help
To be clean again
Solo: Andy
No on cared and no one ever will
Hor Feelings were not shared, she wants to break the spell
And she's going
Into the convent, I smile on her face
Into the darkness to hide all her sins
Wonderful what could go wrong in this place
Father David:
Welcome Sister, I'm Your chaplain
Down on You Kneels, and pray if you please
In this convent I'm Your master
Kiss my cross now, dearest Sister
In the Name of...
Solo: Andy
Madeleine is running away from herself
As Father David said: "At communion You must be undressed"
Why did she go
Into the convent, a smile on her face
Into the darkness to hide all her sins
Wondering what could go wrong in this place
Solo: Andy
Father David:
"Come along Sister Madeleine
Unfold Your wildest dreams, It's time to join and sign
Let the feast begin"
That night she awoke to find "The Eye"
On the stone cold floor why, she never ever would know why
But she put it on
Solo: Pete
Next day Father David passed away
At communion time
Why, he never ever would know why
But the looked at "The Eye"
The eye a necklace is taking it's toll
Inside the convent a soul will rejoice
