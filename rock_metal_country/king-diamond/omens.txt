Nobody's inside the church but the bell is ringing
for no reason the flowers are dying
Oh, Deadly Omens
Oh, Deadly Omens
Inside the mansion the air is unbearable.
a rotten smell
in the dining room the table is set for 3
Oh, Deadly Omens
Oh, Deadly Omens
Solo: Mike
Solo: Andy
"Miriam come here and see what I've found.
it's moving
and empty cradle swaying in the air
I did not bring it in here, now did You?"
"No No No "
Oh, Deadly Omens
Oh, Deadly Omens
