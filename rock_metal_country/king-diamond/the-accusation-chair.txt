I kind of knew that she would be
Waiting for me in her room
With a sick smile she told me not to be a fool
Her eyes went hard staring right into my brain
But I convinced her that I was feeling real fine
Oh, I was lying... Seeing the look in her eyes
Clearing my mind was important
She believed everything I said
And then she asked me if I would help
To bring her outside
Oh, I was lucky...
"Let us stay for a while" she said
"Bathing ourselves in the moonlight"
So there she was unprotected by THEM
I grabbed her came, and tore it out of her hand
"No way, you're not going to escape"
"Now that I've got you...
Here you will pay for your deeds
You sick mind has come to an end now"
"Stop it"
Solo: Andy
Solo: Pete
Nowhere to hide, Grandma' has died
Alone in the night
And THEY where waiting for me
Waiting inside
Hoping that I would come back in
By I just run away
Into the woods, as far as I could
I saw THEIR eyes
And then I fainted again,
Going insane
Dreaming that I was one of THEM
I hear THEIR voices all the time
