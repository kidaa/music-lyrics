I stumbled out of Grandma's room
Down the stairs and out of the house
Once outside I felt my mind
Begin to fight a battle for control
With a tea pot broken I king of realized
That THEIR power was less here,
Here on the outside
I fell to my knees in haziness
And I looked in through the window
To the cellar
Things where moving down there,
THEY where searching for something
And THEY really found it,
The big axe was flying
Flying out through the cellar door
Up the stairs to the kitchen...
Then i passed out
Solo: Andy
The next thing I remember
Seeing was the smoke coming from the chimney
I soon realized the smoke I saw
Was actually... Oh no!
All there was left of Missy
And her dress, poor little girl
Solo: Pete
The spell was broken, I really felt the change
As my mind and body became one again
The moon was alive with it's silvery eye
Staring right into my evil heart
I went back to see if my Grandma' was still there
Waiting for me in the attic...
Oh I hate that bitch
