Theme: Andy
Riding up the alley in the rain
no lights to show the way
how could this ever be their home
through the darkness You could only see
a giant shadow witch was to be
a house where evil ruled at night
And the shadows at the gate, they seemed to be alive
Yeah the shadows at the gate, Alive
Everything inside was left untouched
except for what the rats has got
and the dust of time that shadowed it's mark
armed with candlelight and open eyes
through the dark they thought their way
till every room was lit again.. Again
And the house began to breathe
it seemed to be alive
Yeah the house began to breathe, Alive
Theme & Solo: Andy
As the candlelight began to fade
and Jonathan said "Let's go bed"
the fireplace had ceased to burn.. Burn
Both were fast asleep before the dawn,
Dreaming... Dreaming
and they did not know about the shadow
Yeah the shadow on the wall, it really came alive
Yeah the shadow on the wall, Sunrise!
