It's so cold inside on this summer's night 
Black clouds in the sky dancing before my eyes 
I'm losing track of time 
It's the eye of the witch 
It's the eye of the witch 
Thunder bring the rain, penetrate my brain 
I am no more the same, that special night has come again 
Losing track of time 
It's the eye of the witch 
The eye.. the eye.. the eye 
Another glass of wine to heat the blood of mine 
And as I look inside the necklace called ";The Eye"; 
I'm going back in time 
It's the eye of the witch 
It's the eye of the witch 
The eye.. the eye.. the eye
