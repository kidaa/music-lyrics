La Rocque/Diamond
1932, North of Baton Rouge
Louisiana nights are darker than before
Along the Mississippi, that is where it is
The old colonial house, a mansion of you will
Whaite as snow, the mansion still seems to have its slow
And when the moon is full and white
You can hear the drums of voodoo echo in the night
In the "LOA" house, misery will strike again
Jean le Noir, the first to own this house
He was a voodoo priest, a Houngan so they say
The voodoo cemetery, that is where he is
Died at the hand of an evil Bocor's will
They say... he's been walking the house  ever since that day
And when the moon is fool and white
You can hear the drums of voodoo echo in the night
In the "LOA" house, misery will strike again
Solo: Andy-Herb
They never should have come, no no no
They never should have come to the "LOA" house
They never should have come, no no no
They never should have come to the "LOA"
7 days ago... the Lafayettes moved in
Sarah is with child and Davis is the man
This is no Abigail, this child will survive
And Grandfather dear, why did they bring him here?
White as snow, that is all he sees, oh he's been blind for years
Solo: Andy
They never should have come, no no no
They never should have come to the "LOA" house
They never should have come, no no no
They never should have come to the "LOA"
And when the moon is fool and white
You can hear the drums of voodoo echo in the night
In the "LOA" house, misery will strike again
In the "LOA" house, misery will strike again
And again...and again...and again...and again...
