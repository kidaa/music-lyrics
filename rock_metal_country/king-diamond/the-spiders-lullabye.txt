Music and lyrics by King Diamond
In a little cottage, in the country side
Lives a man called Harry, and he is losing his mind
Listen... Hear the spider's lullabye
It's really sad for Harry, he finds a spider scary
Even the smallest species, will make him feel uneasy
Oh, they live in every corner
Oh, and here comes the summer
There's another spider on his wall ... Gotta kill it !
Soon to be another creamy spot
As he woke up this morning, there was a spider crawling
He felt the big surprise, before it caught his eyes
Oh, in between his face
Oh, and his pillow case
There's another spider on his wall ... Gotta kill it !
Soon to be another creamy spot
Here comes another one ... Ha... Ha... Ha... Ha... Ha
He's got to find a doctor, a very special doctor
Someone who can cure his mind
Someone who knows Harry's kind
Listen ... Hear the spider's lullabye
Those creepy crawly screatures
With all their hairy features
Hoping to catch a fly
Singing its deadly lullabye
Oh... oh, NO...
There's another spider on his wall... Gotta kill it !!!
