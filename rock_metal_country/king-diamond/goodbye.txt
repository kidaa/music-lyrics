So many tears in my eyes, I have to look away
How can I say the word, that never should be said
I lay my broken heart to rest, and so I set you free
I wish you only the best, even if it's not with me
Fly away
Beautiful angel fly away to better things
Beautiful angel fly away to better things
Fly away
