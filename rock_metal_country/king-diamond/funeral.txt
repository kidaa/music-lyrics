"We are gathered here tonight,
to lay to rest Abigail La Fey,
Whom we no know
was first born dead
on the 7th Day of July 1777.
Abigail must be nailed to her
coffin with 7 silver spikes,
one through each arm, hand and knee,
and let the last of the 7 be drawn through her mouth
so that she may never rise and cause evil again.
Who will be the first?"
"I O'Brian of the Black Horsemen."
