Music & Lyrics: Diamond
I've been watching Lucy all week
I've been watching her at school
I know her schedule, I know it well
I know exactly when she's leaving
Oh Lucy take my hand,
how can I make you understand
I'm not a stranger, I am a friend
I'm gonna take you home to Daddy...later
Such beautiful eyes you have, such beautiful hair
You must be at least seven years of age,
am I right now ?
As if I really care
Cause you're his daughter, his little daughter
The one I'm supposed to have hurt
But I could never, I could never
I could never hurt a little girl like you
Oh Lucy take my hand,
how can I make you understand
I'm not a stranger, I am a friend
I'm gonna take you home to Daddy...later
Solo: Herb
Such beautiful eyes you have, such beautiful hair
You must be at least seven years of age
But who cares, 'cause you're coming with me NOW!
Solo: Andy
Come on little girl...Why are you making such a fuss
Come on little girl...come on it is time
I've got real dolls on my wall, I made them myself
And you can play with them and play with them
And play with them
Until your Daddy comes to get you
Oh Lucy take my hand,
how can I make you understand
I'm not a stranger, I am a friend
I'm gonna take you home to Daddy...later
I I I I and you will soon be home now
I I I I and you are gonna play then
I I I I and you you you you
We we we we, we're gonna have some fun
Sweet graveyard here we come
Sweet graveyard here we come
Sweet graveyard here we come
Sweet graveyard
