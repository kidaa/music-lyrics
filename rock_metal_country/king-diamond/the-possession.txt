On the very next morning
When the mist was eaten way by the sun
Miriam grew hour by hour and
Jonathan he cried
He knew the ghost had been telling the truth
So this was 9
The pregnancy would not last overnight
Oh she started singing
a lullaby, rocking the cradle again
and then she said
"I'm having Your baby my love.. love"
but it wasn't love. Oh No
she was possessed... and he knew
Solo: Mike
"I will get what is rightfully mine"
Solo: Andy
Speaking with different tongues
Miriam was eaten alive from inside
again she said
"I'm having Your baby my love.. love"
but it wasn't love. Oh No
she was possessed...possessed
