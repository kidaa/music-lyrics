Music: King
My Mother is entering My dream now
She's wearing a wedding dress
SOMETHING wrong with the way
She walks the aisle
I think it's her legs
Suddenly there
Is someone else beside her
That man I recognize
The Doctor intends to marry Mother
It's got to be stopped
Now what have I done
My Mother's on the floor
And the Doctor's gone
Everything is wrong
And as I keep the axe
I wonder that's to come
I'm caught within a dream,
There's no way out
I can't escape
If only I could see the light of day
I might escape the dream
The wedding dream... Oh the dream
Now everything turns to darkness
Deep within
I feel like I'm going blind
There is a light
At the end of this starless nightmare
Someone is calling,
Guiding me back inside...
The Dream... No
Solo: Pete / Andy
Get away from him Mother
You better stop kissing,
'Cause he's an enemy
Take a look at his hand
He's got the key to My house,
The Doctor is the devil
I'm caught within a dream,
There's no way out
I can't escape
If only I could see the light of day
I might escape the dream
The wedding dream... Oh the dream
Solo: Pete / Andy
Dream... the wedding dream...
Oh the dream
Now everything turns to darkness
Deep within
I feel like I'm going blind
There is a light
At the end of this starless nightmare
Someone's screaming:
"Help Me please"... and it's me
At sunrise I woke up in a sweat
The nightmare was gone
The dream I was sent
Is fading slowly
I do not understand
