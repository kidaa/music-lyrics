Music & Lyrics: Diamond
Oh Daddy...I'm so alone, Oh Daddy...come home
Oh Daddy...I've missed you so
Oh Daddy...tell me what to do
Daddy don't look at me like that
I didn't do it...HE did...It was HIM
I could never...I could never
I wasn't even there
Solo: Andy
Daddy tell me what to do...Daddy...No don't no
Oh Daddy, you're fading away
Oh Daddy, Daddy please stay
Oh...you're fading away
Oh Daddy, Daddy please stay
You're going down, you're going down, McKenzie
Solo: Herb
Sit down you creep, you degenerate son of a sheep
Solo: Andy
What am I to do you...with you ?
Solo
You're going down, you're going down, McKenzie
Solo
Sit down you creep, you degenerate son of a sheep
Solo
What am I to do you...with you ?
Solo
Sit down you creep, you degenerate sheep
Solo
You're going down, you're going down, McKenzie
