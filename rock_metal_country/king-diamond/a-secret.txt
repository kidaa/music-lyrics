La Rocque/Diamond
Sunday noon
In the "LOA" mansion the Lafayettes are meeting
There's a crisis they must resolve
Twice since they moved into this house
The Voodoo drums have spoken at night
The mansion is dark and gloomy place
A haunted landscape, a house without grace
The Voodoo burial ground is the key
Get rid of that and they're free
It must remain a secret, or the plan will never work
It must remain a secret
In comes Salem, he's 6 feet tall and dark
He is the new found butler of the "LOA" house
They ask him for advice regarding their plan
To destroy the cemetery on their land
It must remain a secret, or the plan will never work
It must remain a secret
We must do what must be done
Solo: Andy
If you steal the grave from one who sleeps
He will come for you to set him free
You must not break the chain
Salem: "Jean le Noir's spirit walks this house at night
Never will he leave, cause this is where he died
Great Wanga will hit you if you do
Destroy the cemetery of Voodoo"
If you steal the grave from one who sleeps
He will come for you to set him free
Superstitious we are not
