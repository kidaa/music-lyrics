Theme: Mike
She's Wearing White Again But Colours Always Betray
Don't Look Into Her Eyes, There's An Evil Darkness Inside
Theme: Mike
You Might See Her But She Is Not Here
Leave Her Alone Don't To Get Near
One Touch And You'll Disappear
What A Scream You'll Never Hear
She Carries A Secret
And Where She Must Go... You'll Never Know
Solo: Mike
She Carries A Secret
And Where She Must Go... You'll Never Know
Solo: Andy - Theme: Mike
Searching But Not For A Home
A Restless Soul All On Its Own
Always Dressed In White
As She Passes On Trough The Night
She Carries A Secret
And Where She Must Go... You'll Never Know
Solo: Mike - Andy - Mike - Andy - Mike
She Carries A Secret
And Where She Must Go... You'll Never Know
