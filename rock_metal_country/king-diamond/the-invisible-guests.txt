Solo: Pete
Solo: Andy
Late that night I awoke from my sleep
Hearing unknown voices laughing insane
Grandma' was one, oh it's coming
From the room next to mine
It's Grandma' room... The invisible guests
Solo: Pete
As I stood there alone in the dark
Peeking through the keyhole,
Couldn't believe my eyes
I'd never seen anything like it,
Only Grandma' was inside the room
Speaking to no one... The invisible guests
Cups were rising in thin air
And then emptied on the floor
Suddenly the door was open
And Grandma' said "Do come in my little friend"
Solo: Pete
Missy and mother were sleeping downstairs
If they could see in Grandmother's chair
Solo: Andy
Grandmother said: "Look me deep in the eyes
You will forget what you saw here tonight"
"I will let you in one the secret of this house
The secret of Amon... That's what we call this house
Now I want you to go back to sleep,
Now go back to sleep my dear"
The invisible guests
Solo: Andy - Pete - Andy - Pete
Cups were rising in thin air
And then emptied on the floor
Suddenly the door was open
And Grandma' said "Now you must go back to sleep"
"Go to sleep"... "Go to sleep"...
"Go to sleep"
Missy and mother were sleeping downstairs
If they could see me in Grandmother's chair
