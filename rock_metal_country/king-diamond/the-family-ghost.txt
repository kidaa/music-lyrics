The darkness came closer to home on the following night
And Miriam slept like a rock when Jonathan's face went white
The bedroom was ice cold
but the fire was burning still
the blinding light
The Family Ghost had risen again
The Ghost
"Don't be scarred. Don't be scarred now My friend
I am Count de La Fey
Let me take you to the crypt down below
where Abigail rests"
"Let Miriam sleep
She never would understand
Now come let us go... It's time to know"
Solo: Mike
Solo: Andy
"Beware of the slippery stairs
You could easily fall and break your neck
hand me that torch and I will lead the way
to the secret in the dark, secret in the dark
take a look into the vault, the Vault
The sarcophagus..of a child
Abigail has been here for years and years
stillborn". Born... Born... Born
"The spirit of Abigail is inside Your Wife
and there is only one way You can stop the
rebirth of evil itself
You must take her life now"
