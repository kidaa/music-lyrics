Andy La Rocque/King Diamond
Sacrifice, holy rites, secrecy and altar wine
Black candles burnig low, to the meetings again they go
Picard can't wait to take away
Another soul
Oh it's shame, Picard was so insane
In the year of 1642, it came to an end
In 1642, imprisonment
Sacrifice, holy rites, secrecy and altar wine
Black death come this way
Father Picard will soon be going
He's ill, so sick, now his meetings are forever over
Oh it's shame, they went along with his game
In the year of 1642, it came to an end
In 1642, imprisonment
Solo: Andy
Sacrifice, holy rites, secrecy and altar wine
The nuns can't take the blame
One after one they suffer a breakdown
Confession, confession, they confess to diabolic possession
Oh it's shame, even Madeleine has gone insane
In the year of 1642, Madeleine was leaving hell
In 1642 she found freedom in her prison cell
