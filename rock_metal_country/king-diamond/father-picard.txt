A new chaplain has arrived
Madeleine and a few other nuns
At the convent will meet him tonight
Father Picard:
"Welcome to my quarters, do come inside
Welcome dearest sister, come into the light"
"I'm Father Picard, I'm taking over
Things will be different here
You are the four GOD has chosen
To be his angels is white
Drink my sweet holy wine"
"Oh yeah come on it's hot a crime
From now on every Sunday this time
You will attend this communion of mine"
Father Picard is hiding something
A white powder for the wine
Solo: Andy
Solo: Pete
Father Picard:
"I'm Father Picard, I'm taking over
Things will be different here
You are the four GOD has chosen
To be his angels in white
Drink My sweet holy wine"
Solo: Pete
The nuns freak out, lust in their eyes
From now on every Sunday this time
Father Picard's in control of their minds
Father Picard was hiding something
The while powder in the wine
