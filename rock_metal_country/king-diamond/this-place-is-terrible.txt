I'm back in the church...night has taken over
I'm breathing hard...in the dark
Through the hole in the floor, I hear the winds from the catacomb
Here it comes, out of the hole, a magnificent light
Blinding the entire chruch
Contorted faces and bodies too, powerful entity floatinghigh above
I was no more scared of dying, but I was terrified of knowing the truth
I don't want to, but I have to...I have to know who you are
"You have entered, where no human must go
You have seen the lie...the lie about the cross"
Solo: Andy La Rocque
"I am many...We are One, THE HIGHEST
You'll never know why We kept Him here
The one who did not died on the cross
Could it be We kept Him away from God... so that he may never walk
Never walk the Earth again?"
Solo: Andy La Rocque
"Or could it be that We've kept Him... safe from YOU
So you may never try to do again what... you did back then?
I guess it all depends on who you are
I guess it all depends on who you really are"
"God and Satan are just puppets on OUR strings
Creating conflicts in your little human minds, keeping US alive
It doesn't matter who or what you think We are
It only matters that you know We are
God, The Devil, good and evil, We're all that and so much more"
Solo: Glen Drover
"Live this life the best you can, and leave the rest to US"
But I can't... I won't be one that feeds an unknown God
Show to mankind that You really exist
And then explain to us the meaning of chaos
Give us reason to persist, to go on living through this Hell on Earth
All I want is peace of mind from all you non existing Gods
I bet that not even You will ever understand the truth
Cause YOU are nothing but a puppet on even higher strings
Solo: Glen Drover
Your unholy eyes, I wanna sew them shut
Oh you meaningless little God, and so I choose death over you
Up up the grey cold stairs, up into the tower of Hell
With a rope in my hand, I'm searching for the unknown land
FATHER OF THE UNIVERSE, here I come...THIS PLACE IS TERRIBLE
