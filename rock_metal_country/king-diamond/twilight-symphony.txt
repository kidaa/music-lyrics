Morning came and so did they,
Flying questions from the police
I'm waiting here in an ambulance for Dr.Landau
To return and tell me why
They're talking me so far away
"I did what I did and I'm glad I did
'Cos I could have been the...
I could have been the next in line".
Nobody found a trace of Missy
I'd be the last to tell them anyway
How could I ever ever explain
Now I hear THEM again,
Singing twilight symphony, twilight
I hear THEM again,
Singing twilight symphony, twilight
Grandma' was dead with an open neck
Blood still running from my open mouth
I knew they would blame it,
They would blame it all on me
How could I ever ever explain
Now I hear THEM again,
Singing twilight symphony, twilight
I hear THEM again,
Singing twilight symphony, twilight
Dr.Landau returned, and I told him the story
"Are you mad or just insane?"
I tried anyway
"You can take him away now,
The boy has lost his mind"
Oh no no
Solo: Andy
I haven't seen my mother since they took me away
Took me away
And Dr.Landau wouldn't tell me
He wouldn't tell me anything
Oh I'm back on the outside
Solo: Pete
Time has caught up with me,
And I must leave for the old house
Yes, I must leave now
Grandma'... I'm coming
I'm coming home now
I'm coming home now
