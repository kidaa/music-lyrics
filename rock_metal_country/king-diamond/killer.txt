Music by La Rocque / Lyrics by Diamond
At midnight, an hour from now... they're gonna flick the switch
Down the Hall, beyond the iron door... they're gonna end my life
I will see you all in Hell, isn't that where we all must go ?
I will not, tell you want I did... It doesn't matter now
I will tell, how weird it is, to know exactly when you're gonna go
I am a killer... I'm gonna get what I deserve
I am a killer, they're gonna fry my each and every nerve
It is not, the soul I sell, it's not the pain from hell
It is not, the feel of dying, of that I was never afraid
I will see you all in Hell, isn't that where we all must go ?
Gazing at the iron door, while time is slipping away
What's really driving me insane
Is what to do with my final hour
I am a killer ... I'm gonna get what I deserve
I am a killer, They're gonna fry my each and every nerve
I've got less than an hour to kill
I'm looking back at the life I've had to live
What a waste ... what a mess...
I should have never been born ...
Solo: Simonsen
I hear them, coming down the hall, I know they're coming for me
I don't need that silly Priest, Oh just get on with the show
I am a killer ... I'm gonna get what I deserve
I am a killer, They're gonna fry my each and every nerve
