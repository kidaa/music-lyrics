Music and lyrics by Kind Diamond
I don't know if I'm dead or alive
All I know is I'm running out of time
Oh, I'm leaving my body... Oh, leaving it behind
From the other side, looking down I know that it's me
From the other side, looking down It's the devil I see
Someone down there is saving my life
I see a tear being shed by THE EYE
Oh, drifting much higher... Oh, Into the light
From the other side, looking down I know that it's me
From the other side, looking down It's the devil I see
Solo: La Rocque
I see the strangest faces
Faces that I've never seen before
They see through empty spaces
Spaces that do not exist no more
I swear by the moon and the devil
I'll be their guardian if they will be mine
There's a demon with red glowing eyes
He's invading the body that was mine
Oh, Is there still time ... Oh, Time to return
From the other side, looking down I know that it's me
From the other side, looking down it's the devil I see
I guess I wasn't ready yet
'cause someone there is calling me back from the dead
Demon, demon, are you there
Demon, demon, leave my lair
Solo: La Rocque
From the other side, looking down I know that it's me
From the other side, looking down it's the devil I see
WAKE UP !!!
