Once indside, everything would change before my eyes
No more decay
Glorious beauty had taken its place
But in horror...I watched as the wolf...began its skin to shed
I grabbed a silver crucifix expecting evil to be next
To the floor it fell, the crucifix, the wolf was no more a beast
Instead a lady only dreams can create
Creeping deep into the heart I never had
"I'l love you forever...never leave"
It was love at first sight, in true love there is no wrong or right
I didn't care from were she came, just her name...Angel
Then a kiss, soft and warm, my love, am I really not alone?
Nights of heavenly sin, in The House Of God, I found...true love
Nights of heavenly sin, in The House Of God, I found...true love
"I'l love you forever...never leave"

Plenty of food and wine, and so we laughed and we dined
We made love in the holiest of places
All the passion, it made us crazy

"I'l love you forever...never leave"
To the floor it fell, the crucifix, the wolf was no more a beast
Instead a lady only dreams can create
Creeping deep into the heart I never had
I didn't care from were she came, just her name...Angel
Then a kiss, soft and warm, my love, am I really not alone?
Nights of heavenly sin, in The House Of God, I found...true love
Nights of heavenly sin, in The House Of God, I found...true love
Angel...Angel...Angel...Angel where are you now?
