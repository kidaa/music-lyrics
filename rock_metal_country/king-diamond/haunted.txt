Stay Away, Molly's Soul Keeps Returning
Every Night To The Attic Shrine
Never Alone, Living Dolls Out Of Nowhere
Crying Out: "Mommy Why"
The House Is Forever Hounted
Nothing You Can Do
Molly's Living There With Her Dolls
And They Are Alive... Wait And See
Solo: Mike
Stay Away, Mrs. Jane, Molly's Mother
Slowly Went... Insane
The House Is Forever Hounted
Nothing You Can Do
Molly's Living There With Her Dolls
And They Are Alive... Wait And See
Solo: Andy
"Mommy... Mommy..."
I'll Destroy You
