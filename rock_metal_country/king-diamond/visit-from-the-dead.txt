It must be summer, the sky is clear
The garden is so beautiful
All the flowers and all the trees
Make Me feel like they're inside of Me
I'm holding my Sister's hand
While we're playing in the sand
It's all but... a dream
My bed is moving, I cannot see a thing
I am in total darkness,
Someone is calling
I can feel the chill, it's all around Me
I know it's not a dream, No no no
Someone is in My room
Standing at the end of My bed
Must be a visit from the dead
Must be a visit from the dead
Solo: Pete
Now I see her figure -
It's just a little child
And there's no reflection -
She's in the mirror
Could it really be,
Has she returned?
My little Sister
"King beware...
Something bad is coming Your way...
King beware"
Must be a visit from the dead
Must be a visit from the dead
Missy will You tell me
You know we don't have no secrets
"Just beware"
Solo: Andy
Must be a visit from the dead
Must be a visit from the dead
You've got to tell me Missy
Com on now, spit it out girl
"I will send you a dream..."
