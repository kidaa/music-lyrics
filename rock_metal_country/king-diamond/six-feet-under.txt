Music by La Rocque / Lyrics by Diamond
My family just couldn't wait, I should have seen it coming
What a nice conspiracy, what a nice surprise
But now it's all too late
I am six feet under, It's so very hard to breathe
My family they put me here, in a coffin made of glass
So I can see them in their glory or they can see me in my misery
They're standing all around my grave
Six feet under, I'm in a coffin made of glass
Six feet under, It's so very hard to breathe
Solo: La Rocque
Six feet under, I'm in a coffin made of glass
Six feet under, It's so very hard to breathe
My hands are turning blue while my nails are turning to Red
Solo: Simonsen
Looking up into faces of greed
I'm sweating cold and white with fear
Sinister smiles ... upon their lips
One of them is waving me goodbye
I am six feet under, It's so very hard to breathe
My lovely sister is laughing at me, I cannot hear but I can see
Now she is kicking soil into my face
I swear I will return to haunt her
Six feet under, I'm in a coffin made of glass
Six feet under, It's so very hard to breathe
My face is turning blue while my eyes are turning to Red
