Solo: Mike
When Nightfall Comes Around And The Light Of Day Is Done
The Dark Closes In As The Last Candle Burns Out
It's Time To Send Off Your Mind On A Trip
Into The Land Of Dreams And Mist
Is Something Wrong
They Are Lurking In The Dark
Solo: Mike
Heavy Breathing But Nobody's There
If That's What You Think You'd Better Beware
Is Something Wrong
They Are Lurking In The Rain, Watching You
Solo: Andy - Solo: Mike
How Does It Feel To Be Alone In The Dark
How Do You Know They Won't Do Any Harm
They Can See You But You're Oh So Blind
Maybe It Only Appears In Your Mind
Is Something Wrong
They Are Lurking In The Rain, You'll See
