La Rocque/Diamond
Tuesday morning
At the light of dawn, on a day without
Sunshine...Salem had vanished
Gone, would Sarah, would she survive
Grandpa was panicking
Father Malone. The Exorcist...Father Malone. The Exorcist
Sarah's voice had changed from female to
Male...and that was wrong, it was as if Sarah
Had gone. Grandpa remembered his friend
Father Malone was the name
Solo: Andy
Grandpa: "Put me through to New Orleans
The Abbey of the Holy Saints
Father Malone please... It's urgent
You got to, you got to, you got to put me through"
It only took a minute or two, before the Father he understood
Father Malone: "Listen here my friend, do not despair
I will be there...this afternoon
But beware...of the Daytime Moon"
Solo: Herb
Father Malone. The Exorcist...Father Malone, he is here
Father Malone: "Holy Cross and Bible
Holy Water for the soul
And so the house I bless, but David, he's got to
Go, call for an ambulance before  the others know"
Then he went back to Sarah's room
Solo: Andy
