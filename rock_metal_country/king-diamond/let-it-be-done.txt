Music: King
Doctor: "Who's gonna set the fire to the coffin?"
Priest: "I think You and You wife to be
Should do it together,
While I keep the demon inside
With my crucifix"
Doctor: "So it's into the coffin, use the torch
And then we put the remains
Into his Sister's grave, right?"
Priest: "Yes, let it be done"
