Music: King
Missy I miss You so, oh little Sister
I wish You'd come back to me
And sit by My side
We'd laugh and we'd play again,
If only You'll try
You know THEY would show the way
From the other side
Rise from your grave
Little Sister
Rise... Rise... Rise My friends... Rise
Spirits rising from their grave
Burning shadows in the dead of night
Icy fingers all over My hand
Try to make me understand
"Finally we have returned...
All of us"
Missy is that you, come closer
Spirits rising from their grave
Everywhere that ghostly share
Icy fingers all over my hand
Lead me back to where she stands
THEY are back to share my life...
THEY are back
Solo: Andy / Pete
Missy come, come with Me,
There are things I must know
How did You get here,
Where's the door to the other side
Missy:  "Beyond the graves lies the gate
The gate that leads to the dead
We have to leave before the dawn
It's not by the sun we will burn"
Spirits rising from their grave
Soon the dawn will
Chase the dark away
Icy fingers all over My hand
Lead me back to where THEY stand
Am I glad You have returned... All of You
Solo: Pete
Do you remember when Grandmother said
She heard THEM sing
I've heard THEM too and I really wish
I could hear THEM again
Missy:  "In your mind You'll hear THEM sing
Every night at the graves
We have to leave before the dawn
It's not by the sun we will burn
Now sing"
Show Your powers onto Me
Solo: Andy
