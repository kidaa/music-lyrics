Music and lyrics by King Diamond
In the moonlight
I see children searching for their souls
In the moonlight, can you hear them howling on the wind
Night after night, I see them passing by
They whisper in my ear, We know you are there
I see no eyes, I guess they must be blind
Wish that I could lead them to a better world than mine
Solo: La Rocque
In the moonlight, not a bird is singing lullabyes
In the moonlight, I hear a church bell ring its evil song
Night after night, I see them passing by
They whisper in my ear, We know you are there
I see no eyes, I guess they must be blind
Wish that I could lead them to a better world than mine
In the moonlight... In the moonlight...
Solos: Simonsen - La Rocque
Night after night, I see them passing by
Wish that I could lead them to a better world than mine
In the moonlight
I see children searching for their souls
In the moonlight
I hear screams of pain from a thousand years ago
Raven spread your wings, lead the spirits to their home
Raven spread your wings, lead the spirits to their home
In the moonlight... In the moonlight...
