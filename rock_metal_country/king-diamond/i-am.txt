Music & Lyrics: Diamond
Back...in the tomb, Lucy is sitting on the floor
I...am, I am standind by the door
The door to freedom...the door that I shut so close
And as I take another look at my mind
I seem to think the sun has arrived...No
McKenzie you better realize, now it's just you and I
Back...against the wall
McKenzie's on the stone cold floor
Hands...tied together, nowhere to go for Mr. Mayor
The door to freedom...the door that I shut so close
And as I take another look at my mind
I seem to think the sun has arrived
Solo: Andy
This court is now in session
You stand accused of child abuse
Of stealing innocence and freedom too
I am the only Judge, I am the only Jury
I am your lawyer too, so tell me what to do
What's it gonna be ?
Are you guilty or are you GUILTY!!!
Yes, you just go ahead and cry
Solo: Herb
Back...against the wall
McKenzie's on the stone cold floor
Hands...tied together, nowhere to go for Mr. Mayor
The door to freedom...the door that I shut so close
And as I take another look at my mind
I seem to think the sun has arrived
But Oh No...There is no sun here
There's only darkness... ... ...
I, the Jury and the Judge
Find you guilty of stealing the innocence of a child
And therefore we sentence you to die slowly, die
Die die die die die die die.....
