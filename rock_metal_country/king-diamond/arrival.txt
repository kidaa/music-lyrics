"That must be it"

Solo: Mike
Through the summer rain of 1845
the coach had finally arrived
to the valley where the crossroads meet below
and where all darkness seems to
grow people blame it on the Hill
the hill where no one dares to go...
The Mansion
The coach had stopped and from the window You could see
7 Horsemen in the night
Miriam Natias and Jonathan La Fey
saw the magic in their eyes
they were in for a surprise
the darkness would soon be complete
a horsemen came forth from the dark
Solo: Andy
"We know You've come to inherit What's
Yours... The Mansion
Take our advise and go back on this night
if You refuse 18 will become 9.. Oh no"
Oh, 18 is 9
Theme: Andy
Solo: Mike
Jonathan laughed and said "Get out of my way"
"I don't believe a word you say"
The 7 horsemen disappeared into the night
and said "Someday You'll need our help my friend"
I think poor Jonathan was scarred
18 is actually 9... It's stuck in his mind
Solo: Andy
