Look, the old bitch is back -
Yeah, finally we'll get some company
Again the attic room has been
Locked up for too long - just like the
Old bitch herself - she's on time
Though - why that silly wheelchair?
On she's pretending as always - but
She does make a good cup of tea
"Oh my god she's here. Missy, listen
To what mother says. Now you be
Good to Grandma; and remember
She's been away on a long vacation
That goes for you too King. And stop
Playing that thing. Answer the door."
