King Diamond
The inquisition will take her to the hill
Ready for the kill, giving God his will
Everybody's there, none of them will care
Not a single player
Burn in the night, You're devil's child
Burn in the night, You're devils's child
Looking at the sky, soon the girl will die
Nobody will cry, hear her screaming "WHY?"
The priests are all in line , now they give the sign
Let the fire shine
Burn in the night, You're devil's child
Burn in the night, You're devil's child
They say the devil is here tonight
Then let him play his violin so wild
Higher, Burning nigher, flames will soon devour
Higher, Burning nigher, the smell of skin turned sour
Solo: Andy
Higher, Burning nigher, her legs are scorched by fire
Ashes to ashes, I see a smile on their wicked faces
Solo: Pete
Burn in the night, You're devil's child
Burn in the night, You're devil's child
Solo: Andy
Lighting from the sky, magic's coming by
As her necklace flies right into her eye
The priests are all in line, nowthey give the sign
Let the fire die
Burn in the night, You're devil's child
Burn in the night, You're devil's child
