Andy La Rocque
The night is black
7 figures walk the streets of Louviers
Picard is one, another two are priests
And then the nuns, going to
The meetings held in secrecy
Evil company full of secrecy, again and again
The room is dark
Candles on the wall, they've been here before
The christian cross is hanging high above
The altar of God
Solo: Pete
Madeleine is at the gate
Hazy feeling in her brain
As the strangers come in to
The meetings held secrecy
Evil company full of secrecy, again and again
The strangers brought
The sweetest little child, but something's wrong
The baby cries, someone here will die
And now the nuns prey
The meetings held secrecy
Evil company full of secrecy, again and again
Madeleine and the other nuns
They hold the infant up to the cross
As father Picard and the priests approach with hammers
And nails
There's no more to tell
Solo: Andy
