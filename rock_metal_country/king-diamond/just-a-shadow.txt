Again I'm so alone, the wine is pouring down
No one to share with, no one to care with
The only light in my life
Comes from candlelight, black candles left behind
As I'm sitting through the night
I'm so cold and dark inside
Angel, your memory will haunt me till the day I die
Solo: Glen Drover
Just a shadow, a shadow of a man
I'm just a shadow, a shadow of a man
The eyes of statues standing along the nave
They seem to follow my every move, every tear I shed
Solo: Glen Drover
I am no longer of the living, but I am still not dead
I'm somewhere in between, I am of the unseen
Solo: Glen Drover
Must we have the other side, just to feel alive?
Oh I wonder what would be had we not created me
Just a shadow, a shadow of a man
I'm just a shadow, a shadow of a man
The eyes of statues standing along the nave
They seem to follow my every move
They drive me insane
Solo: Andy La Rocque
Surrounded by darkness in this cold church of thine
I try to remember, all that once was mine
I don't know what tomorrow will bring
But if life is so divine, how come I suffer so in mine?
How come I suffer in mine
The eyes of statues standing along the nave
They seem to follow my every move
They drive me insane
I am no longer of the living, but I am still not dead
I'm somewhere in between, I am of the unseen
I lived a lifetime of sorrow and hate, up until the other day
That's when I left this sick old world behind
Oh how love can make you blind
Solo: Glen Drover
