On the following friday as I turned out the light
Grandma' came and knocked at my door
"Wake up King, wake up my dear
I am gonna shell you about the house of Amon"
It is time for tea, it is time again
"Even your mother is present
We made her sleep in my rocking chair
At first I felt really scared but
There was no reason to
As I saw the knife sneaking out from Grandmother's dress
Then it cut a tiny wound in my mother's little hand"
It is time for tea, it is time again
Solo: Pete
Blood was running into the tea pot
Then I heard THEM laugh
"A bit of this in a cup of tea
Is what it takes to set THEM free
You will hear THEM telling stories
From far beyond this Earth"
What I saw and what I heard
Made me want to stay and learn
I really hope this dream will never end,
It's hard to describe
The king of feeling that went on in my mind
A paradise
Solo: Pete
Solo: Andy
Hearing THEIR stories and feeling THEIR warmth
We laughed with tears in our eyes
From the first cup of tea, to the last drop of blood
Nothing seemed to matter at all anymore
My mother? She didn't exist to me
Oh I felt so heavenly
It is time for tea, it is time again
