I'd been riding hard most of the night, wooded ravines on a mountain side
My horse was getting tired...and so was I
Up there the moon was full, down here darkness ruled
The trees were so much higher than they were meant to be
In what is known as "The Devil's Hide"
I knew I was not alone, and it was not that crazy moon above
Oh no...I could feel the trees have eyes
I used to know this road so well, many a time I was here before
But now it seemed so different, the road was no more
I was lost, I stopped and looked around
I had this eerie feeling, that I was being watched
In what is known as "The Devil's Hide"
I knew I was not alone, and it was not that crazy moon above
Oh no...I could feel the trees have eyes
Watching me
The trees have eyes, watching me
Then the I didn't wanna hear, howling at the moon
Eyes I didn't wanna see, I should have turned around
Solo: Glen Drover
So much louder, the howling was chilling my bones
One wolf grown to a dozen, and here I was alone
Yellow eyes...then were everywere...yellow eyes...as I prepared to die
Suddenly there she was, in a halo of light
Suddenly there she was, silvery black and white
The bluest magical eyes, staring right into mine
Never ever had I seen in a wolf, such a beautiful beast
In what is known as "The Devil's Hide"
I knew I was not alone, and it was not that crazy moon above
Oh no...I could feel the trees have eyes
