Yesterday I spend an hour
A full hour in therapy
My favorite Doctor Landau
My God I hate his breath
He asked me a questions
That kind of fool deserves a lie
I gave him answers
The kind of answers Doctors like
Yes, I gave him a bunch of lies
I told him all my nightmares
Were dead and gone
"These days I sleep like a baby
And there never ever was a THEM"
He asked me a questions
That kind of fool deserves a lie
I gave him answers
The kind of answers Doctors like
Solo: Andy
The Doctor looked at my eyes
Landau: "No trace of insanity
Maybe the time is right now
To have a visit from the family
I'm thinking of your mother
What does my little patient say?"
I should have taken his stethoscope
And then forced it down his throat
My mother was a stake
So I behaved
Solo: Pete
That night I cleaned the entire house
For everything but the memories
No dust, no tea, ah stupid me
I even took the axe away
The sun is up and it's time for bed
I'm so tired
I can't wait no mo-o-o-o-o-re
