Tonight would be the last night
That we had our tea
That bloody tea, which sent us into ecstasy
Yesterday mother complained,
Feeling dizzy, all in pain
Mother's getting weaker,
Looking paler day by day
As morning came, she could not make it out of bed
And Grandma's spell was getting straight into her head
Not a single word, she didn't seem to be alive
Getting weaker,
Looking paler day by day
Then Missy came in and she led me by the hand
I didn't want to go, oh but I should have known
Mother was barely conscious,
Why should I care
Just looking forward to the next ordeal
Solo: Andy
Solo: Pete
Solo: Andy
I think I heard my sister begging me to stay
She gave me the phone, so I could call
Someone to help
I simply let go of her hand,
Then I cut the wire
Missy was crying as I left the both behind
And mother's getting weaker,
Missy shouted at by back
"I hate you"
Bye Bye Missy
Tea time monday night, I was waiting passing time
Then from the hallway, I saw mother in heat nightgown
Swaying up the stairs, up the stairs, it seemed so unreal
I knew Grandma' had sent THEM again,
The invisible friends
A little later in the middle of tea
We came close to ecstasy
THEY were telling tales form beyond when Grandma' rose
She opened the door, and there was Missy
Seeing mother in Grandmother's chair,
She went into tears
Missy was screaming
"What have you done, when have you done to my Ma",
Crying louder now
"We better get rid of her, she's too young anyway",
It was Grandma' who spoke
"Bye, bye Missy, be gone forever
The beautiful fireplace in the kitchen will do"
Solo: Pete
Solo: Andy
I saw Missy struggling in Grandma' wrinkled hands
"Oh no, let me be, oh no
Please no Grandma' please
Aagh Grandma' you're hurting me
Don't touch me or I'll break it,
I've got the tea pot, I'll do it anyway"
I saw liquid spreading, the bloody tea
All over the floor
Now I heard THEIR voices,
Some kind of demon growls
Die - she broken Amon - Amon - die
Solo: Andy
Solo: Pete
THEY dropped THEIR tea cups
Grandma' stood still
Forced by invisible hands,
Missy went down the stairs
As I waved her goodbye,
Missy was sobbing away
Will I ever see her again,
Bye bye Missy, don't be afraid
