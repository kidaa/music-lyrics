King Diamond
I know what you're thinking,
I can see through your brain
I know that you're doing
Even though I'm far away
The power I get from the chain is mine
Only I can use it
The power I get from the chain is mine
Only I can use it
It was only yesterday, thunder rolling by, breaking up the sky
And the rain was pouring down
Pounding on my brain, driving me insane
I was drinking wine again,
Oh yeah blame it on the wine
The curse of "the eye", it will take you back in time
If you look at "the eye", it will take you back in time
Solo: Andy
The curse of "the eye", it will take you back in time
If you look at "the eye", it will take you back in time
I know what you're thinking,
I can see through your brain
I know that you're doing
Even though I'm far away
Solo: Pete
I know there's bad side to the power of the chain
I know I'll be going back in time once again
Solo: Pete
It was on the first of May, thunder rolling by, breaking up the sky
And the rain was pouring down
The inquisition came, I felt the pain
I had to relive it all in just one day
The curse of "the eye", it will take you back in time
If you look at "the eye", it will take you back in time
Solo: Pete
The power I get from the chain is mine
Only I can use it
