Music and lyrics by King Diamond
It was in the local paper : We will cure you every phobia
At Devil Lake Sanitarium
We will make you feel you're right at home
No more sleepless nights, no more unpleasant sights
We can recreate paradise
And you don't even have to sacrifice a thing
It only took about a minute's time
For poor old Harry to make up his mind
So he headed for Devil Lake, knowing doctors
were awaiting him
No more sleepless nights, no more unpleasant sights
We can recreate paradise
And you don't even have to sacrifice a thing
Solos: La Rocque - Simonsen
HARRY : ... My name is Harry and I am from the country side
I'm looking for a doctor, Eastmann is the name
Dr. EASTMANN : We welcome you with open arms
We've all been looking forward to having you here
At Devil Lake Sanitarium
You must always sign a special paper first
HARRY :  I will sign anything, just to get rid of my fears
I just want to live a life, where do you want me to sign ?
Dr. EASTMANN : Right here on the dotted line
This will give me all the freedom I need for you
At Devil Lake Sanitarium
You know we are the very best at what we do... Oh Yes !
Solo: La Rocque
Now that we have got his signature
I think it's time to start the Eastmann cure
So put him in the straight
I think room 17 is still our whitest room
No more sleepless nights, no more unpleasant sights
We can recreate paradise
And you don't even have to sacrifice a thing
