Kris Tyler/Emory Gordy, Jr.
Everybody's had the blues
Days when it comes undone
This really shouldn't bother me
I know I'm not the only one
To break down and cry
I don't know why it has to be so hard
I could've left this road I'm on
Turned around a thousand times
Surrendered to the great unknown
Give up and leave it all behind
But this is my dream
My life and everything I've prayed for
It takes a strong heart
To see love through
It takes a lot of faith
More than I ever knew
To cry and never let it show
To hold on tight and not let go
It takes a strong heart
A strong heart and you
I keep it hidden deep inside
It's just a phase im going thru
I show the world a pretty face
But I'm not really foolin you
'Cause you know how I feel
You know how to heal
This wounded pride
It takes a strong heart
To see love through
It takes a lot of faith
More than I ever knew
To cry and never let it show
To hold on tight and not let go
It takes a strong heart
A strong heart and you
I don't know what I'd do without you
I couldn't do this alone
You give me faith and hope
And the courage to carry on and on and on
