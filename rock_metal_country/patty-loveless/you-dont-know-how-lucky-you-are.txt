Most people use money to measure success
The big car they're driving and the way that they dress
If there's someone who loves you you're richer by far
You don't know how lucky you are
Society's pages she never may grace
Or dress in fine garments of satin and lace
But if comfort awaits you in the warmth of her arms
You don't know how lucky you are
Just under the surface lie riches untold
More precious than diamonds more treasure than gold
Priceless is true love in a good woman's heart
You don't know how lucky you are
Just under the surface lie riches untold
More precious than diamonds more treasure than gold
Priceless is true love in a good woman's heart
You don't know how lucky you are
Priceless is true love in a good woman's heart
You don't know how lucky you are
