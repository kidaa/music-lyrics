Staley
Lonely days, lonely nights
Missing you, with all my might
Wanting you
To hold me tight
Lonely days, lonely nights
When you're gone
This old house, it gets lonely
And talkin' to myself
Ain't company
And nothin' seems to stop
The tears from fallin'
Feeling sorry for myself
You're not here to comfort me
Lonely days, lonely nights
Missing you, with all my might
Wanting you to hold me tight
Lonely days, lonely nights
Sleep without you
Is just a bad dream
Whispers that I hear
Are just the wind
And mornin's just another day
To remind me
This is the lonliest
I think I've ever been
Lonely days, lonely nights
Missing you, with all my might
Wanting you to hold me tight
Lonely days, lonely nights
Lonely days, lonely nights
Missing you, with all my might
Wanting you to hold me tight
Lonely days, lonely nights
Lonely days, lonely nights
