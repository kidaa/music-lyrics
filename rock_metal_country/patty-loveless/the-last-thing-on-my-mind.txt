Craig Wiseman/Al Anderson
I don't love him anymore just ask all my friends
I've told them and I tell them time & time again
I don't have no regrets no I'm not that kind
Honestly he's the last thing on my mind
When the day turns into dusk
And the shadows start to fall
And this empty bed's as big as Arkansas
And when I'm driftin' off to sleep
Something in my broken heart rewinds
He's the last thing
He's the last thing on my mind
Now, rushing through the day
I might seem improved
There isn't time to second guess my foolish moves
No I can only see
Once the lights go out
What it is I can live with and without
When the day turns into dusk
And the shadows start to fall
And this empty bed's as big as Arkansas
And when I'm driftin' off to sleep
Something in my broken heart rewinds
He's the last thing
He's the last thing on my mind
When the day turns into dusk
And the shadows start to fall
And this empty bed's as big as Arkansas
And when I'm driftin' off to sleep
Something in my broken heart rewinds
He's the last thing
He's the last thing on my mind
