Kostas/Emory Gordy Jr.
Well there's a lot of things we could do tonight
Go out, do the town, and see the sights
But you and I got better things to do
You know it's true
I feel you deep down in my soul
Oh you got me and I won't let go
And I just wanna be loved by you
Baby just you
The moon is swayin' and the stars are fallin'
Hey, hey baby can't you hear me callin'
So let's stay home and enjoy the view
Cause I just wanna be loved by you, yeah
Don't answer the door, don't answer the phone
Let's tell the world to leave us alone
Cause I just wanna be loved by you
Baby just you
So take me in your arms and hold me real tight
Wake up the neighbors in the middle of the night
You better believe it cause you know it's true
I just wanna be, just gotta be
I just wanna be loved by you
So let's put the world up on the shelf
Tonight I want you all to myself
I just wanna be loved by you
Baby just you
Cause the moon is swayin' and the stars are fallin'
Hey, hey baby can't you hear me callin'
So let's stay home and enjoy the view
Cause I just wanna be loved by you
So take me in your ams and hold me real tight
Wake up the neighbors in the middle of the night
You better believe it cause you know it's true
I just wanna be, just gotta be
I just wanna be loved by you
I just wanna be loved by you
I just wanna be loved by you
I just wanna be, just gotta be
