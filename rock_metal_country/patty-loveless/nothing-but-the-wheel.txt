John Scott Sherrill
Way on past the boulevards
Out here underneath the stars
I've been flying past the houses, farms and fields
Leaving all I know back there
Rushing through the cold night air
And I'm holding on to nothin' but the wheel
Staying clear of the interstate
I'm seeking out those old two lanes
Trying to explain the way I feel
Till all at once it's half past three
And it's down...to just the trucks and me
And I'm holding on to nothin' but the wheel
I've been trying to drive you off my mind
Maybe that way baby I can leave it all behind
And forty-one goes on and on
And the lights go winding in the dawn
The sky's the color now of polished steel
And the only thing I know for sure
Is if you don't want me anymore
Then I'm holding on to nothin' but the wheel
And the only thing I know for sure
Is if you don't want me anymore
Then I'm holding on to nothin' but the wheel
I'm holding on to nothin' but the wheel
