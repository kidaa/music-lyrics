Wilson/Henderson
Mr. Man in the moon
Are you really blue
Are you shedding a tear
While you shine
If you feel like I do
Mr. Man in the moon
Then your heart must be
Broken like mine
Are you lonesome
There's not a star in sight
Well I'll be right here
We're both up for the night
Mr. Man in the moon
Are you really blue
Are you shedding a tear
While you shine
If you feel like I do
Mr. Man in the moon
Then your heart must be
Broken like mine
To the whole world
You show a smiling face
I feel like the dark side
That you hide away
Mr. Man in the moon
Are you really blue
Are you shedding a tear
While you shine
If you feel like I do
Mr. Man in the moon
Then your heart must be
Broken like mine
