I feel the blues comin' on
'Cause I feel you being gone
Something I wish I could lose
Baby's gone blues
There ain't no sunshine in sight
'Cause you're gonna leave me tonight
My heart is sure feelin' blue
Baby's gone blues
Oooh love has gone wrong
It's so hard on my heart
Goin' from good into gone
Oooh there ain't no easy way back
Into nights before you
Baby's gone blues
Baby's gone blues
It's like a razor on me
Knowin' you want to be free
I'm standing here feeling blue
Baby's gone blues
There ain't no dreams comin' true
I won't recover from you
There ain't no heartache like you
Baby's gone blues
Oooh love has gone wrong
It's so hard on my heart
Goin' from good into gone
Oooh there ain't no easy way back
Into nights before you
Baby's gone blues
Baby's gone blues
Baby's gone blues...
Baby's gone blues...
