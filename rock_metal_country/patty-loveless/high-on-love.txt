High on love
And I ain't comin' down
No, I ain't comin' down
Don't you know, I'm high on love
Since you've come around
And I ain't comin' down
Took a long time for me to believe
But I finally got a reprieve
From loneliness, emptiness
And wasting my time
I got lucky one fine day
Heaven must've sent your love my way
And ever since
I've been riding on cloud nine
High on love
And I ain't comin' down
No, I ain't comin' down
No, I ain't comin' down
No, I ain't comin' down
High on love
It's the same old world turning round and around
My feet ain't touching the ground
Up in the sky without a care
Just a couple of angels going nowhere
High on love
And I ain't comin' down
No, I ain't comin' down
Keep on gettin' me high on love
Since you've come around
And I ain't comin' down
No, I ain't comin' down
No, I ain't comin' down
No, no, no, high on love
No, I ain't comin' down
No, I ain't comin' down
