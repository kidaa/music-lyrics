Kostas
I can't make these heartaches go away
He's always on my mind
The memories of the love we had
Don't fade away with time
What is this crazy road
I'm on
I don't understand
What makes two people
Fall in love
What goods a promise
When the love is gone
Where do you go
When you find yourself
On the lonely side of love
The rain is fallin' to the ground
The neon rainbows glow
I see us standing far away
Where peaceful waters flow
It's the only dream that I have left
That I can hold on to
Now am I right or am I wrong
For holdin' on to what is gone
And what's left to believe in
On the lonely side of love
I can't make these heartaches go away
He's always on my mind
The memories of the love we had
Don't fade away with time
What is this crazy road
That I'm on
I don't understand
What makes two people fall in love
What goods a promise
When the love is gone
Where do you go when you find yourself
On the lonely side of love
Now am I right or am I wrong
Holding on to what is gone
And what's left to believe in
On the lonely side of love
