John Bunzow
Mend this broken body
In pieces on the ground
My spirit's cracked and crumbled
My world's been crashing down
The weight upon your shoulders
Got so heavy they just gave in
Till could not lift my head up
To face another day again.
Let a ray of hope come shining
So I may look up at the sky
And see a glimpse of tomorrow
Where I'm standing in the light
Let me climb upon the hilltop
Healing hands can touch me now
They will mend this broken body
In pieces on the ground
The human heart's a fragile thing
It shatters just like glass
Gather up all these splinters
Crush them into grains of sand
So the wind may scatter them
Towards the angels looking down
They will mend this broken body
In pieces on the ground
Then a ray of hope came shining
When I looked into your eyes
I saw all of my tomrrows
And we're standing in the light
We are high upon a hilltop
Healing hands touching me and
Mending this broken body
In pieces on the ground
