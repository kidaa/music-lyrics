Earle/Bennett
Sensitivity ain't your style
A cheap box of candy
And an Elvis smile
Drove me wild
That was some blue moons ago
Used to thrill me when you hold me tight
But I don't want another summers night
Baby, it's alright
That was some blue moons ago
I need a warm romance
You gotta take a chance
You gotta let those feelin's show
You need to give and take
Come on communicate
Baby love's not touch and go
Like it was some blue moons ago
Come on baby, it's a brand new day
I need your love, but in a different way
Hold me honey
It don't take much
All I need is just a little touch
I'm not hangin' on to yesterday
We need the kind of love
That's built to stay
Baby here today
Not some blue moons ago
I need a warm romance
You gotta take a chance
You gotta let those feelin's show
You need to give and take
Come on communicate
Baby love's not touch and go
Like it was some blue moons ago
Some blue moons ago
Some blue moons ago
Some blue moons ago
