Rushing
When I left
I left walkin' wounded
And made my escape from the rain still a prisoner of hurt
I had months worth the work
Freein' my mind of the pain
I had hours to sit alone in the dark
Listenin' to sad songs
And comin' apart
Lord knows I made cryin' an art
We give a slow healing heart
Slow healing heart
Dyin' to mend
It's longing for love
Lonely again
When a spirit is broken
And the memories start
Nothing moves slower
Than a slow healing heart
How I prayed for blind faith to lead me
To places where I'm not afraid
Now I'm doing fine
Both in body and mind
Some hurts take longer to fade
There's a part of my feelings
Ever on guard
Against looks that are tender
Words that are hard
I still remember those cutting remarks
We give a slow healing heart
A slow healing heart
Is dying to mend
Longing for love
Lonely again
When the spirit is broken
And the memories start
Nothing moves slower
Than a slow healing heart
Nothing moves slower
Than a slow healing heart
