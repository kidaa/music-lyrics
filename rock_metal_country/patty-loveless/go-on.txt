Patty Loveless/Murrah
Maybe in time
It'll get easier
When there's been enough time
Between us
Right now it seems so hard
To face that we're apart
And to believe one day
We'll put these years behind us
And we can go on living our lives
Like there's no yesterday
Like there's no hurt
And nothing has gone wrong
Go on living our lives
Like there's no memories
It won't be easy to do
But we gotta go on
There was a time
When ours was a stronger love
Now we find it wasn't strong enough
When the feeling isn't there
And all that's left are tears to share
We can think about the time
Our love was better
We gotta go on living our lives
Like there's no yesterday
Like there's no hurt
And nothing has gone wrong
Go on living our lives
Like there's no memories
It won't be easy to do
But we gotta go on
It won't be easy to do
But we gotta go on
