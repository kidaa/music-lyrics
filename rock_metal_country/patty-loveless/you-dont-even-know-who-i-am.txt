Gretchen Peters
She left the car in the driveway
She left the key in the door
She left the kids at her mama's
And the laundry piled up on the floor
She left her ring on the pillow
Right where it wouldn't be missed
She left a note in the kitchen
Next to the grocery list
It said, you don't even know who I am
You left me a long time ago
You don't even know who I am
So what do you care if I go
He left the ring on the pillow
He left the clothes on the floor
And he called her to say he was sorry
But he couldn't remember what for
So he said I've been doing some thinking
I've been thinking that maybe you're right
I go to work every morning
And I come home to you every night
And you don't even know who I am
You left me a long time ago
You don't even know who I am
So what do I care if you go
You don't even know who I am
So what do I care if you go
