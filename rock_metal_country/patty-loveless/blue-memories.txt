Brooks/Paul Kennerley
When I close my eyes
I almost see
The way you look
When you were standing next to me
And I still feel you holdin' me tight
Oh I can hear the laughter
And all the words you whispered in the night
Picture this and paint it blue
A photograph of me and you
Smile has faded with the years
Washed away by all the tears
And when I look
All I see are blue memories
Oh how I remember the time
There was love in your heart
And that love was mine
If I could turn it all 'round again
We'd be lying side by side
And things would be the way
They were back then
Picture this and paint it blue
A photograph of me and you
Smile has faded with the years
Washed away by all the tears
And when I look
All I see are blue memories
Picture this and paint it blue
A photograph of me and you
Smile has faded with the years
Washed away by all the tears
And when I look
All I see are blue memories
Blue memories
Blue memories
