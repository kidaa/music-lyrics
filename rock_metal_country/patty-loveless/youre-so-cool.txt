You're So Cool
Matraca Berg/Carolyn Dawn Johnson
Tried to write you a love song
In the middle of the night
Everything rhymed, but it didn't feel quite right
Anway, that's all we need
Is another modern day Shakespere
All I know is I get chills
Whever you're standing there
You're so cool
Cool as ice cream in the summertime
Cool as James Dean with a twist of lime
You're so fine and I dig you hard.
They wouldn't print it in a Hallmark card
It's so high school
yeah, You're so cool
I don't know what's happening, but it's a silly thing
I wanna wear your sweater
I wanna wear your ring
Ain't it funny what love
Can make a grown woman do
I've been telling my friend
I gotta big crush on you
You're so cool
Cool as Dylan back in '69
Cool as James Dean with a twist of lime
You're so fine and I dig you hard
Lovesick dreaming in the backyard
They wouldn't print it in a Hallmark card
It's so high school
Yeah, You're so cool
It sounds so ordinary, yeah
In my vocabulary
So I might as well say you roar
Yeah baby, you're so cool
Cool as Dylan back in '69
Ragtop mustang in the summertime
You're so fine and I dig you hard
Lovesick dreaming in the backyard
They wouldn't print it in a Hallmark card
It's so high school
yeah, You're so cool
Oh how does it feel to be so cool
Yeah, yeah ragtop Mustang in the summertime
Yeah, You're so fine
You roar,
You're so cool
