Kostas/Folkvord
Raindrops fall from the sky
Teardrops fall from my eyes
Can't stop myself from loving you
Your heartaches found a home
I walk these streets alone
Can't stop myself from loving you
I know I shouldn't waste my time
In dreams of yesterday
But your memory's all that
I have left
Since you've gone away
No matter what I do
My heart stays cold and blue
Can't stop myself from loving you
They say that time
Can heal a lonley heart
That's broke in two
But time ran out on me the day
You walked out of my world
So let the teardrops fall
The rain will hide them all
Can't stop myself from loving you
Can't stop myself from loving you
