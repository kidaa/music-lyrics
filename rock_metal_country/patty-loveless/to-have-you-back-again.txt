Annie Roboff/Arnie Roman
Love, love's a chameleon.
Makes one-in-a-million feel like to much of the same.
But leave, leave it behind you.
And love will remind you.
It was only you that changed.
Oh I'd give all my dreams.
Give up my home and everything I've ever known to have you back again.
To have you back again, to have you back again.
I'd stand in the rain, no place to hide.
Drown in my shame, swallow my pride.
To have you back again, to have you back again.
Time, time is a river.
Flowing forever, away from the sound of your heart.
Only you can break this silence, whisper forgiveness.
Let me back in your arms again.
Oh I'd give all my dreams.
Give up my home and everything I've ever known to have you back again.
To have you back again, to have you back again.
I'd stand in the rain, no place to hide.
Drown in my shame, swallow my pride.
To have you back again, to have you back again.
And I know I never loved you like you needed to be loved.
But I know that I could learn to if we both had faith enough.
Oh I'd give all my dreams.
Give up my home and everything I've ever known to have you back again.
To have you back again, to have you back again.
I'd stand in the rain, no place to hide.
Drown in my shame, swallow my pride.
To have you back again, to have you back again
