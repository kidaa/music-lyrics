Johnny Cash
It was three in the morning when he took me apart
He wrecked my house and he wrecked my heart
He danced on my head just like Aruthur Murry
The scars ain't gonna mend in a hurry
Just when I thought that things would get better
Right through the door came a tear stained letter
Whoa, Oh, Oh Lord, Lord
Cry and Cry if it makes you feel better
Set it all down in a tear-stained letter
Whoa,Oh, Oh lord,Lord
Cry and cry if it makes you feel better
Set it all down in a tear stained letter
Well my head was spinning just a little too fast
It was writing checks that my body couldn't cash
I jumped to my feet I was reelin' and a dizzy
I went for the phone but the line was busy
Just when I thought that things would get better
Right through the door came a tear stained letter
Whoa, Oh, Oh Lord, Lord
Cry and Cry if it makes you feel better
Set it all down in a tear-stained letter
Whoa,Oh, Oh lord,Lord
Cry and cry if it makes you feel better
Set it all down in a tear stained letter
Now I like coffee and I like tea
But I just don't like this feeling in me
It makes me nervous it gives me the hives
Looking for the truth in a pack of lies
Just when I thought that things would get better
Right throught the door came a tear stained letter
Whoa, Oh, Oh Lord, Lord
Cry and Cry if it makes you feel better
Set it all down in a tear-stained letter
Whoa,Oh, Oh lord,Lord
Cry and cry if it makes you feel better
Set it all down in a tear stained letter
