This ain't uptempo, this ain't no positive
This ain't no music meant for jumping up and down
This is a sad song, more than three minutes long
It took a lifetime just to come this far
This thing is serious, we're in a big mess
We're at the junction of forever and goodbye
If this is where we're going
Well, hello honey here we are
Are you gonna leave or do I have to say
All wound up tight with this tension and anexiety
Can't take one minute more, what am I in this for
It's like I love you and hate you at the same time
I think this jig is up, I think I've had enough
I think I'm running outta reasons not to let you go
I've faced the music
It's over for the rythum and the rhyme
Baby this is a hook, last line and sinker
A moldy oldie on the radio you remember but its over and done
It's the end of the dance, let's take it out with a new song
A little thing called the blues in the key of love
No place left to go when the good is gone
One line away from brand new song
Baby this is a hook, last line and sinker
A moldy oldie on the radio you remember but its over and done
It's the end of the dance, let's take it out with a new song
A little thing called the blues in the key of love
No place left to go when the good is gone
One line away from brand new song
Baby this is a hook, last line and sinker
A moldy oldie on the radio you remember but its over and done
It's the end of the dance, let's take it out with a new song
A little thing called the blues in the key of love
