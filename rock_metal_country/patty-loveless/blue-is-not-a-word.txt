Somnier/Ball
Never once in my life
I met someone like you
I don't know what the words
Could mean, so long as I'm with you
You fill me so completely
In everything you do
Blue is not a word at all
As long as I'm with you
Most of the time
In my past
Blue is all I knew
But now that we're together
Oh how I love you
I'm so glad I found you
You made my dreams come true
Blue is not a word
As long as I'm with you
Most of the time
In my past
Blue is all I knew
But now that we're together
Oh how I love you
I'm so glad I found you
You made my dreams come true
Blue is not a word at all
As long as I'm with you
Blue is not a word at all
So long as I'm with you
