Gary Burr
I try to think about Elvis
Memphis
Oprah in the afternoon
I try to think about palm trees
Fig leaves
The creature from the black lagoon
I try to think about high heels
And good deals
Anything to get me through
I just can't concentrate
You're all I think about these days
I try to contemplate the cosmos
What goes
Round and round the sky at night
I try to think about champagne
Freight trains
Slowly rolling out of sight
I try to focus on the headlines
Street crimes
Everytime I think I might
I just can't concentrate
You're all I think about these days
My mind wanders where it will
When it settles right on you
I forget what I should say
I forget what I should do
My mind wanders where it will
When it settles right on you
I forget what I should say
I forget what I should do
I try to think about Shakespeare
Leap year
The Beatles or the Rolling Stones
I try to think about hair-do's
Tattoos
Sushi bars and saxophones
I try to think about the talk shows
New clothes
But I guess I should have known
I just can't concentrate
You're all I think about these days
You're all I think about these days
