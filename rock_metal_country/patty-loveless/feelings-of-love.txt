Kostas
I leave you with something
You can't understand
You can't buy or sell it
Or hold it in your hands
It's greater than this world of ours
Or the heavens above
I leave you with feelings of love
It's as free as the wild wind
As gentle as a lamb
It fills the angels with envy
It's givin' free to man
Gives courage to the lion
Peace to the dove
I leave you with feelings of love
Feelings of love
Are what make my love real
Feelings of love
Are the best things to feel
You gave it to me freely
Now I leave it with you
I leave you my feelings of love
It gives man to a woman
Gives a woman to her man
It makes friends out of enemy's
It makes our hearts join hands
You gave it to me freely
Now I leave it with you
I leave you my feelings of love
