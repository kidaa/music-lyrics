Clark/Sykes
You are so good to me
You got me feelin'
Like I'm happy, I'm lucky
As free as a bird
You got me feeling like
Love is more than a word
You are so good to me
Just as good as you can be
You are the sweetest thing
You are the reason
That I get up in the mornin'
And go to bed at night
Give me the feelin'
That I'm doin' something right
You are the sweetest thing
Just as sweet as you can be
Sometimes I wonder where I'd be without you
I can't imagine ever being so blue
And anyone can see
You are everything to me
Yes you are everything
You know just when
We should be talkin'
Or keepin as quiet as a mouse
You know just how to make me
Want to chase you 'round the house
Yes you are everything
You are everything to me
Yes you are everything
You are everything to me
