Kevin Welch/John Barlow-Jones
All I've got is what I've got
I can't act like what I'm now
Got an old soul
A tender heart
And I came straight to you
Well I do my best to tell the truth
Ask my friends if you need proof
If you don't count my wreckless youth
I came straight to you
Thought I walked a twisted trail
Til I saw where it led me to
Yeah, one foot in front of the other baby
And I came straight to you
Had this picture in my mind
Of someone that I hoped
I'd find
Honey I've known you a long long time
And I came straight to you
Well it seemed such a long shot
But somehow my aim was true
Like a moonbeam across the water baby
I came straight to you
All I've got is what I've got
And I can't act like what I'm not
Got an old soul
And a tender heart
And I came straight to you
Thought I walked a twisted trail
Til I saw what it led me to
Well one foot in front of the other baby
And I came straight to you
Like a moonbeam across the water baby
I came straight to you
Straight to you
