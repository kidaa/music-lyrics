Tony Arata/Scott Miller
After all my lonely nights
Without an end in sight
A morning shining bright for me awaits
Where the sweetest times will last
All's forgiven from the past
Someday I will
One day I know I will
Someday I will lead the parade
Though they've scattered through the years
Old friends will gather near
With nothing but the kindest words to say
And the sweetest times will last
All's forgiven from the past
Someday I will
One day I know I will
Someday I will lead the parade
And the sweetest times will last
All's forgiven from the past
Someday I will lead the parade
