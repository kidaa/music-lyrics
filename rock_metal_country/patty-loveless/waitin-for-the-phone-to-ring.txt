Joe Tassi/Bob Tassi
How many nights you cried
So sad and lonley
Wondering if he'll call
Waitin' for the phone to ring
Waitin' for the phone to ring
He said his love was true
You want to believe him
You're out there on a limb
Waitin forthe phone to ring
Waitin' for the phone to ring
How can you love a man
When he holds you like dirt
In the palm of his hand
His kind will always stray
After got through
He'll throw you away
Another night goes by
He's not there to hold you
You sit there like a fool
Waitin' for the phone to ring
Waitin' for the phone to ring
Waitin' for the phone to ring now baby
Waitin' for the phone to ring
How can you love a man
When he holds you like dirt
In the palm of his hand
His kind will always stray
After got through
He'll throw you away
Another night goes by
He's not there to hold you
You sit there like a fool
Waitin' for the phone to ring
Waitin' for the phone to ring
Waitin' for the phone to ring now baby
Waitin' for the phone to ring
Waitin' for the phone to ring
