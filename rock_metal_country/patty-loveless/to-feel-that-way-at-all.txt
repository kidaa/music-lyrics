Lauderdale/Tempchin
He brings her flowers they talk for hours
But he never really says what's in his heart
The way he needs her the way he wants her
It's a miricle to feel that way at all
Oh I can't tear myself away
From where the rose petals fall
Down the path to yesterday
I was lucky to feel that way at all
The way he learned it the way she turned it
Beyond his wildest dreams to have earned it
It was exciting everythign riding
On whether that one star would keep on shining
Oh I can't tear myself away
From where the rose petals fall
Down the path to yesterday
I was lucky to feel that way at all
Oh I can't tear myself away
From where the rose petals fall
Down the path to yesterday
I was lucky to feel that way at all
The way he needs her
The way he wants her
It's a miricle to feel that way at all
