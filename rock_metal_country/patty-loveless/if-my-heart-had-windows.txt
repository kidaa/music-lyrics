Dallas Frazier
If my heart had windows,
You'd see a heart full of love just for you.
A tear may appear when I hold you near,
But that's for the sweet things you do.
If my heart had windows,
You'd see a heart full of love just for you.
By your side, I'll stay,
Till we're old and gray,
Reminiscing the moments we knew.
If my heart had windows,
You'd see a heart full of love just for you.
A thief couldn't steal the love that I feel,
Heaven for me has come true.
If my heart had windows,
You'd see a heart full of love just for you.
If my heart had windows,
You'd see a heart full of love just for you.
