Paul Kennerley
The bright lights don't thrill me
Like they used to do
They only remind me
Of times spent with you
And every old memory
Rekindles the flame
I've got to stop loving you
And start living again
The people all tell me
With time I'll forget
The sweet love you gave me
And they'll be no regrets
But each time I see you
It's always the same
Oh I've got to stop loving you
And start living again
I've got stop dreaming
About all the times
When you told me
You loved me
And would always be mine
And maybe one day
Find somebody new
And start living over
And stop loving you
The rain on my window
Flows down like tears
It seems to know that
I'm lonesome in here
Oh I guess I
Should step out
And see some old friends
I've got to stop loving you
And start living again
Oh I've got to stop loving you
And start living again
