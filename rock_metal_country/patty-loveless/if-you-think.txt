Kostas
If you think I don't care
Just because I'm not there
Then my love
You had better think again
And if you think
There's someone knew
Who can take the place of you
Then my love
You had better think again
You live deep inside of me
As deep as I can see
There's no denying
I guess I'm feeling kind of blue
I'm lonely without you
Until we meet again
If you think my love will change
Just because you're away
Then my love
You had better think again
Send me a letter everyday
Send your love my way
And keep me smilin
Tell me all the things you do
And I will do it too
Until we meet again
If you think I don't care
Just because I'm not there
Then my love
You had better think again
Then my love
You had better think again
Then my love
You had better think again
