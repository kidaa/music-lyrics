Austin/D. Gill
Pain falls around me
Like a shadow in the night
And it hangs like a curtain
Til morning brings light
I've been hurting so long
I'm starting to wonder
If I'll ever leave you behind
I know I'll forget you
It's a matter of time
If it's the last thing I do
I'll sleep without dreaming
Your memory won't wake me
To cry in the dark
When my heart isn't beating
It might finally quit aching
I'll get over you
If it's the last thing I do
You're my love of a lifetime
The one I knew would last
And I know I'll spend my future
Livin' in my past
But there will come a time
When my tears have all fallen'
And I can keep livin' for today
And this heartache will release me
And I can fly away
If it's the last thing I do
I'll sleep without dreaming
Your memory won't wake me
To cry in the dark
When my heart isn't beating
It might finally quit aching
I'll get over you
If it's the last thing I do
I'll get over you
If it's the last thing I do
