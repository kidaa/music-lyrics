DeVito/Paul Kennerley
Rain on my window
Tears in my eyes
Why must I always
Be the one that's left with pride
You say it's over
You don't want me around
Well I'm leavin' you baby
For the blue side of town
Well there's a honky tonk
Where the lights are low
And they play the saddest songs
Dark shadows fall like broken dreams
On the lost and lonely ones
And there's heartbreak hotel
Yes I know it well
I hang around
Blue side of town
You think I'm lonely
Well that's for sure
But don't worry baby
I've been there before
And if you need me
Well, I can be found
Hiding my heartache
On the blue side of town
Well there's a honky tonk
Where the lights are low
And they play the saddest songs
Dark shadows fall like broken dreams
On the lost and lonely ones
And there's heartbreak hotel
Yes I know it well
I hang around
Blue side of town
My hearts forsaken
You've been untrue
It hurts me baby
But I know just what to do
I'll pack my suitcase
And I'll see you around
Take all my troubles
To the blue side of town
Well there's a honky tonk
Where the lights are low
And they play the saddest songs
Dark shadows fall like broken dreams
On the lost and lonely ones
And there's heartbreak hotel
Yes I know it well
I hang around
Blue side of town
I hang around
Blue side of town
