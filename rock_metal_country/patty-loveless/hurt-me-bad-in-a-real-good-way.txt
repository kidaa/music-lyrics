Would of never found you
If he had wanted to stay
Oh he hurt me bad
In a real good way
Well he opened my eyes
To a world beyond
That impossible dream
I was livin' on
And I thank my lucky stars each night
When you're in my arms
And your holding me tight
I realize what it means
To have your true love
I would of never found you
If he had wanted to stay
Oh he hurt me bad
In a real good way
And I thank my lucky stars each night
When you're in my arms
And your holding me tight
I realize what it means
To have your true love
When I look back on my life before
How my heart got shattered
With a slammin' door
I see how it all had to be
For the two of us
Oh the river of tears
That flow from my eyes
Was only moving me on
To this paradise
I would of never found you
If he had wanted to stay
Oh he hurt me bad
In a real good way
Oh he hurt me bad
In a real good way
