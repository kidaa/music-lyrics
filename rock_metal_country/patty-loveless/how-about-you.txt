When it comes to lovin'
Has it always let you down
Every time you've fallen in
Did someone else fall out
I know about that
That's the only kind of love I've ever had
Ooh I need somethin' to hold on to
How about you
Could ya tell some stories
About stories you've been told
All the lines your heart's been thrown
And all the times it broke
I know about that
I don't wanna go
Through that again oh no
Ooh I need somethin' to hold on to
How about you
Could ya tell some stories
About stories you've been told
All the lines your heart's been thrown
And all the times it broke
I know about that
I don't wanna go
Through that again oh no
Ooh I need somethin' to hold on to
How about you
How about you and me get together
And help each other forget
All the love we went through
To get to the one we ain't had yet
Oh yeah
Ooh I've got a feeling
And if you can feel it to
We won't have to look too hard
To find somebody new
How about that I think you know
Just what I'm getting at
Oh yeah, you know
Ooh I need somethin' to hold on to
How about you
Ooh I need somethin' to hold on to
How about you
How about you
