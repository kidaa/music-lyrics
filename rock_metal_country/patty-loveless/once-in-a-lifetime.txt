Katz/Swilling
All my life, I tried to find
Someone to love me
And though the night is lonely
And no one's there to hold me
I would rather be alone
Then be without you
'Cause no one else will do
And just once in a lifetime
Someone like me can find
Someone to love
Like you
And nobody else will do
All my days, are spent this way
With no one to talk to
And oh the rain keeps fallin'
And I hear your voice
Keep callin'
I'd rather be alone
Then without you
'Cause no one else will do
And just once in a lifetime
Someone like me can find
Someone to love
Like you
And nobody else will do
And just once in a lifetime
Ohh someone like me can find
Someone to love
Like you
And nobody else will do
Nobody else will do
'Cause nobody else will do
