Daryl Burgess/Tom Britt
Can you hear it cross the valley
Can you hear that mournful sound
I'm riding rails of silver
Going to where I'm bound
High above the fields of clover
On a lazy, hot July
When I get to where I'm going
I'll hold my head up high
I will roll across these mountains
I will take the last train out
Riding rails of silver
Going to where I'm bound
Roses, dust and ashes
Throw them where I lay
And if by chance you see me
There'll be no sorrow on my face
For I will see the beauty
I only wish that you could see
I'll leave my body weakened
I'll leave my soul to wander free, so free
So if you should see a diamond
Fall down from the sky
Its just a teardrop
From the corner of my eye
As good-bye, as I fly
To where I'm bound
