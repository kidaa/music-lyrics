Billy Joe Shaver
I have climbed so many mountains
Just to reach the other side
I near drowned myself in freedom
Just to feed my foolish pride
On my journey through the darkness
I have finally seen the light
I know no one's ever loved me
Like you're loving me tonight
There is something I must tell you
I wonder if you'll understand
How I found such worldly pleasures
In the arms of other men
You should never try to judge me
We have both been wrong and right
But I know no one's ever loved me
Like you're loving me tonight
God will save His fallen angels
And their broken wings He'll mend
When He draws their hearts together
And they learn to love again
All their sins will be forgiven
In the twinkle of an eye
All the saints rejoice in heaven
When the fallen angels fly
God will save His fallen angels
And their broken wings He'll mend
When He draws their hearts together
And they learn to love again
All their sins will be forgiven
In the twinkle of an eye
All the saints rejoice in heaven
When the fallen angels fly
When the fallen angels fly
When the fallen angels fly
All the saints rejoice in heaven
When the fallen angels fly
