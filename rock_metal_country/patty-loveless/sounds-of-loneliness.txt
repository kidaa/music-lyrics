Patty Loveless
Hear the sounds of loneliness
Hear the sounds all around
Since you've gone and left me alone
I just hear these sounds from now on
And they grow louder..
And louder...
And louder...
And louder...
Hear the sounds of my tears
Fallen down, fallen down
Like the rain comin' down
Oh the sound, that lonely sound
Hear the sound of my heartbeat
It beats so loud
Oh I can't stand it
Oh that sound
That lonely sound
That lonely sound..
That lonely sound..
And it grows louder
And louder..
And louder..
And louder..
Hear the sound of my mind
Thoughts of you all the time
Since you've gone
Left me alone
I'll just hear these sounds
From now on
Hear the sounds of loneliness
Hear the sounds all around
Since you've gone
And left me alone
I'll just hear these sounds
From now on
Hear the sounds of loneliness
Hear the sounds all around
Since you've gone
And left me alone...
I'll just hear the sounds
From now on...
