Somewhere deep down inside of my heart
Makes me feel things that tear me apart
Got a jealous bone
Got a jealous bone
Ever since you walked into my life
Can't bear to see you out of my site
Got a jealous bone
Got a jealous bone
And I know I'm gonna run you off
If I don't learn to let you go
But oooh oh you make me lose control
I was born, with a jealous bone
See heads turn when you walk in the room
I know what they're thinkin' 'cause I'm thinkin' it too
Got a jealous bone
Got a jealous bone
I feel blood pound all through my veins
Every last part of me is callin' your name
Got a jealous bone
Got a jealous bone
And I know I'm gonna run you off
If I don't learn to let you go
But oooh ooh you make me lose control
I was born. with a jealous one
Jealous bone
Jealous bone
Jealous bone
Got a jealous bone
Got to have you baby
All to myself
Can't stand the thought of  you
With anyone else
Got a jealous bone
Jealous bone
Jealous bone
Got a jealous bone
Jealous bone
Got a jealous bone
Jealous bone
Got a jealous bone
