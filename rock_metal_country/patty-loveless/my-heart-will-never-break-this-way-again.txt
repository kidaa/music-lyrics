Gary Harrison/Matraca Berg
In every life there comes a love like this
To blind with trust to know the Judas kiss
And as sure as your love changes in the wind
My heart will never break this way again
Many times I'll walk aone here on the street
But my tears will never taste so bittersweet
Knowing that someday this pain will end
And my heart will never break this way again
Oh, we hold on
We hold on to moments just like these
The painful memories will make you strong
And it's too bad
So sad when your innocence is gone
It's wasted on the ones that do you wrong
And I know that I will love again someday
But never quite enough, that's how I'll pay
Loving you too much, that was my sin
And my heart will never break this way again.
Oh, we hold on
We hold on to moments just like these
The painful memories will make you strong
And it's too bad
So sad when your innocence is gone
It's wasted on the ones that do you wrong
In every life there comes a love like this
Too blind with trust to know the Judas kiss
And as sure as your love changes with the wind
My heart will never break this way again
No, my heart will never break this way again
