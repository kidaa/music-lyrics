Jim Lauderdale
Raindrops on the treetops
Waiting there to fall
I know how they're feeling
But I'm only, yes I'm only, halfway down
Fighting with the devil
Harder all the time
Sinkin' to his level
But I'm only, yes I'm only, halfway down
Halfway down, just a getting started
Yes I'm beginning on my journey now
But I've only gotten halfway down
Halfway down, just a little bit farther
Well I believe you better catch me now
'Cause I'm only going halfway down
Sippin' shallow water
Sharks out for the kill
Almost hittin' bottom
But I'm only, yes I'm only, halfway down
Halfway down, just a getting started
Yes I'm beginning on my journey now
But I've only gotten halfway down
Halfway down, just a little bit farther
Well I believe you better catch me now
'Cause I'm only going halfway down
Yeah I hope you better catch me now
'Cause I'm only going halfway down
Yes I'm only going halfway down
Yes I'm only going halfway down
