Don Phrimmer/George Teren
What's a broken heart
It ain't no big deal
It's not what I have
It's only what I feel
I should laugh it off
I should never cry
It's not meant to live or die by
Once I learn to let him go
The healing has to start
It's temporary pain
I'll live to love again
So what's a broken heart
I just have to stop
And look at who I am
I was just a fool
He was just a man
I can walk away
Never looking back
All his tender lies are hard facts
Compared to those who have no hope
Their lives so cold and hard
All my misery
Is a raindrop in the sea
So what's a broken heart
What's a broken heart
With faith and time
I know I'll find
My world is not that dark
It's temporary pain
I'll live to love again
So what's a broken heart
What's a broken heart
