Emory Gordy, Jr./Jim Rushing
Being without you, baby, is drivin' me crazy
But the way we were was drivin' me insane
The cure for a love-sick ill
Don't come in a little pill
I could use a shot of good time in my veins
Woke up this mornin' with a bad case of Friday night fever
I need a long-legged hunk of honey to cool my head
I know a honky-tonk down the street
To treat a pair of lifeless feet
With a jukebox loud enough to wake the dead
Feelin' good about feelin' bad
These are the best gettin' over you tears I've ever shed
Gonna get real toe and heel leave you like you're standin' still
Dance you right outta my head
Feelin' good about feelin' bad
Don't ya worry your mind that you're worryin' mine any longer
If your memory comes a-callin' I won't be home
Well, it may seem cruel and crude
But I'm changin' my attitude
You'll be history in a sea of lost and gone
Feelin' good about feelin' bad
These are the best gettin' over you tears I've ever shed
Gonna get real toe and heel leave you like you're standin' still
Dance you right outta my head
Feelin' good about feelin' bad
Feelin' good about feelin' bad
Feelin' good about feelin' bad
