Hal Bynum/Bud Reneau
Bought a ticket to Seattle but I can't get to the plane
Everytime I leave you I keep running out of chain
I hunger for your love it never gives me any slack
But if I ever break away, I'm never coming back to these
Chains, chains, shackles and chains
No matter what it takes some day I'm gonna break these
Chains, chains, shackles and chains
These love taking, heart breaking, cold, hard, lonely making chains
You never try to hold me 'till you see me walking out
I guess you'd rather be with me than ever be without
You call me back and kiss me and my heart begins to sink
When I know that all you're doing's taking up another link in these
Chains, chains, shackles and chains
No matter what it takes some day I'm gonna break these
Chains, chains, shackles and chains
These love taking, heart breaking, cold, hard, lonely making chains
Love was never meant to be a one-way street
I was never meant to be falling at your feet
You got me where you want me and I don't know what to do
You don't belong to me but I belong to you in these
Chains, chains, shackles and chains
No matter what it takes some day I'm gonna break these
Chains, chains, shackles and chains
These love taking, heart breaking, cold, hard, lonely making chains
