Jon McElroy/Ned McElroy
You should have seen it coming, now it's too late
She bought the half-price ticket on the midnight train
You wouldn't understand 'cause you lie and cheat
So she wrote it out in lipstick on your satin sheets
She drew a broken heart
She drew a broken heart
Torn right down the middle in a red jagged line
She drew a broken heart and put your name inside
She had to draw you a picture to make it sink in
Revlon Rose was her poison pin
For God's gift to women you ain't got a clue
That red broken heart belongs to you
She drew a broken heart
She drew a broken heart
It ain't no Cupid's Arrow, it ain't no Valentine
She drew a broken heart and put your name inside
No lovesick word's gonna bring her back
The buck stops here, buddy, that's a fact
No matter who's right, no matter who's wrong
Anyway you cut it, she's gone
She drew a broken heart
She drew a broken heart
Torn right down the middle in a red jagged line
She drew a broken heart and put your name inside
