Staley
Well it's been a long time
Since I thought about a man
I never think about maybe
Givin' him a hand
I don't have to think twice
When it comes to you
I only have to ask
Once for me to say I do
Baby baby you're my world
Present to live here for this here girl
You hung the moon and the stars above
Baby baby
So good to be in love
Well you make it so easy
You take a second chance
Open up my heart
And gamble on romance
I want to be there
Every night and every day
When I think about you
I get carried away
Baby baby you're my world
Present to live for this here girl
You hung the moon and the stars above
Baby baby
So good to be in love
Ohh baby baby you're my world
Present to live for this here girl
You hung the moon and the stars above
Baby baby
So good to be in love
So good to be in love
