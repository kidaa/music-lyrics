John David
There's a troubled wind a blowin'  through my crazy life
I feel the chill begin, it's gonna be a long, long, long night
I hear the thunder roll but I don't fear the lightning strike
'Cause deep inside I know I'm gonna make it through alright
So let the walls come tumblin' down
Bring on the last sunset
I ain't moving to heartbreak town
The party ain't over yet
Yeah, let the devil do his worst
But don't take any bets
That life has finally quenched my thirst
The party ain't over yet
Not yet
Every drop of rain that ever fell into my life
Helps me ride this pain, they were a blessin'
In disguise
And I know in time this'll soon be yesterday
Nothin' I can't climb, I've got the will to find the way
So let the walls come tumblin' down
Bring on the last sunset
I ain't moving to heartbreak town
The party ain't over yet
Yeah, let the devil do his worst
But don't take any bets
That life has finally quenched my thirst
The party ain't over yet
Not yet
So when the morning comes
I'll do more than just survive
I'll walk into the sun and live until I die
So let the walls come tumblin' down
Bring on the last sunset
I ain't moving to heartbreak town
The party ain't over yet
Yeah, let the devil do his worst
But don't take any bets
That life has finally quenched my thirst
The party ain't over yet
Not yet
Hey, hey, the party ain't over yet
No, no, the party ain't over yet
