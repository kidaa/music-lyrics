Baby open up that bottle
Come and lay down by my side
I don't have no special reason
Just this ache I feel inside
I wanna lose my inhibitions
I wanna lose those words we said
I wanna drink my fill of you babe
Let it go right to my head
Tonight I want to hold you
I wanna look into your eyes
I wanna watch these broken dreams
Turn into memories
Just like water baby
Just like water into wine
Don't wanna think about tomorrow
Don't wanna count my last regrets
I can't hate you anymore babe
I can't love you any less
Sometimes I've been ungrateful
Sometimes you've been unkind
But all the pain and sorrow
And all the bitter tears
They're just water baby
Just water into wine
So baby open up that bottle
Come and lay down by my side
I can't think of one good reason
We should not be satisfied
Jesus walked upon the water
Healed the sick, the lame the blind
We are miracles of science
We are accidents divine
We're just like water baby
Like water into wine
