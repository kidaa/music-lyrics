Wake up in the morning, start the coffee boiling.
I can't get enough.
Throw the curtains open, let the sun shine in.
I can't get enough.
Well, I work real hard for every penny I make. Just trying to get the job done.
At the end of the day I'm overworked and underpaid.
I can't get enough.
When the week is done I like to have some fun. I can't get enough.
You can find me hanging out where the music's turned loud.
I can't get enough.
Yeah I'm lookin' for a guy who can light up my night.
It don't even have to be love.
A little huggin' and kissin', I'm a girl on a mission.
Can't get enough.
We only get one time around.
You better get it while you can.
If you let this old world go and get you down life will slip right through your hands.
So bring on the laughter and bring on the tears.
I can't get enough.
It's a race against time.
Just want to live 'til I die.
I can't get enough.
Yeah I'm going to take my turn.
Gonna love, gonna learn.
Until my numbers up.
But for now I gotta run.
The parties just begun.
I can't get enough.
We only get one time around.
You better get it while you can.
If you let this old world go and get you down life will slip right through your hands.
Life will slip right through your hands.
Oh I can't get enough.
No no I can't get enough.
Oh I can't... get enough
