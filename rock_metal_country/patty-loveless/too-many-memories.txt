Turner Stephen Bruton
I remember this town with a love by my side
And a peace seldom felt in this day and time
And it gets melancholy every now and again
When you let your mind go and it drifts way back when
Life plays it's tricks, some cruel but fair
And even a fool can pretend they don't care
When there's too many memories for one heart to hold
Once a future so bright now seems so distant and cold
And the shadows grow long and your eyes look so old
When there's too many memories for one heart to hold
There are those moments and they just never fade
The look in his eyes and the way the light played
God moved in that moment and the angels all cried
And they gave you a memory that you have till you die
And the lessons you learn and you don't forget
What makes you grow old is replacing hope with regret
When there's too many memories for one heart to hold
Once a future so bright now seems so distant and cold
And the shadows grow long and your eyes look so old
When there's too many memories for one heart to hold
When there's too many memories for one heart to hold
Once a future so bright now seems so distant and cold
And the shadows grow long and your eyes look so old
When there's too many memories for one heart to hold
