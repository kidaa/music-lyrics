Kostas
Leave your heartaches just outside the door
Lean your troubles up against my heart
And anytime you need a friend
To laugh or cry with you
Remember, nobody loves you like I do
Sometimes things just don't go your way
And sometimes rain clouds cover up the sky
And someday you think that I've grown tired of you
Remember, nobody loves you like I do
There's no one else in the whole wide world
Could ever take the place of you
And no one else in the whole wide world
Could ever love you like I do
Don't be afraid of what the day may bring
Yesterday don't matter anymore
Just as long as you need me
I'll be there for you
Oh darlin, nobody loves you like I do
Just as long as you need me
I'll be there for you
Oh darlin, nobody loves you like I do
