Lyle Lovett
Who keeps on trusting you
When you been cheating
Spending your nights on the town
Who keeps on saying
That she still wants you
When you're through runnin' around
Who keeps on lovin' you
When you been lyin'
Sayin' things that ain't what they seem
Well God does
But I don't
God will
But I won't
And that's the difference
Between God and me
God does, but I don't
God will, but I won't
And that's the difference
Between God and me
So who says she'll forgive you
Says that she'll miss you
And dream of your sweet memory
Well God does
But I don't
God will
But I won't
And that's the difference
Between God and me
God does, but I don't
God will, but I won't
And that's the difference
Between God and me
God does, but I don't
God will, but I won't
And that's the difference
Between God and me
