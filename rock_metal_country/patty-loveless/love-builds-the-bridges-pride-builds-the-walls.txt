Jim McBride/Jerry Salley
She's twistin' the ring on her finger
She's watchin' the clock on the wall
She's hopin' when it finally hits him
He's wrong
He'll come to his senses
And give her a call
Across town he's in a hotel room
He can't keep his eyes off the phone
He's thinking that soon she'll break down and call
To tell him she's sorry
And beg him back home
There's a lonesome fool waiting
On each end of the line
There's a measure of blame on both sides
Until each heart is willing
There's no hope at all
'Cause love builds the bridges
But pride builds the walls
The longer they wait on each other
The harder it gets to give in
They're too proud to see
They're just one call away
From putting their love back
Together again
There's a lonesome fool waiting
On each end of the line
There's a measure of blame on both sides
Until each heart is willing
There's no hope at all
'Cause love builds the bridges
But pride builds the walls
Until each heart is willing
There's no hope at all
'Cause love builds the bridges
But pride builds the walls
