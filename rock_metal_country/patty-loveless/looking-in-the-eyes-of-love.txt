I wonder should I tell you
About all the crazy things
I've ever done
I've been a rebel all my life
And when I should have stayed
I tried to run
I was searching for an answer
In this world full of strangers
But what I found was never enough
Now that I found you
Looking in the eyes of love
Darlin you've been good to me
You are so much more than I deserve
I never thought that I would find
Someone who's so sweet and kind
Like you
Please believe me
When I say
This time I won't run away
I swear by all of heavens stars above
Now that I found you
I'm looking in the eyes of love
Looking in the eyes of love
I can see forever
I can see you and me
Walking through this old world together
Oh my hearts found a home
I've been dreaming of
Now that I found you
I'm looking in the eyes of love
Oh my hearts found a home
I've been dreaming of
Now that I found you
I'm looking in the eyes of love
Now that I found you
Looking in the eyes of love
