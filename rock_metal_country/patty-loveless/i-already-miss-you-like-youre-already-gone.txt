Rushing/Shamblin
Oh friend the hour is near
You must go
And I'll be here to face
An empty life on my own
I can't hide it when I'm sad
After all the joy we've had
I already miss you
Like you're already gone
If you could rock my heart to sleep
With your breath upon my cheek
I could dream, you'd be returning
With the dawn
But when I face reality
Hands of time, hands of time
Don't turn for me
I already miss you
Like you're already gone
I already suffer with this pain in my heart
When I stare out my window
My whole world's turning dark
In the time that remains
I will try to be strong
But I already miss you
Like you're already gone
I already suffer with this pain in my heart
When I stare out my window
My whole world's turning dark
In the time that remains
I will try to be strong
But I already miss you
Like you're already gone
I already miss you
Like you're already gone
