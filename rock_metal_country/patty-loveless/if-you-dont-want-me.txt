Warden/Emory Gordy,Jr.
Never really felt like I belonged
Just about that time, you came along
Lead me to expect, your love and your respect
But lately you don't let those feelin's show
I don't really want somebody else
But I won't be your prize upon a shelf
I'd rather feel this emptiness
Than be something you possess
If you don't want me
Let me go
Can't we both admit
We made the most of it
And we were wrong
Don't you realize
The best years of our lives
Will soon be gone
If you hold on
I know there must be more to life than this
Neglected vows wrapped in a token kiss
Lonely and ignored
I can't take it anymore
If you don't want me
If you don't love me
If you don't want me
Let me go
