I love the hands of the workin' man
Workin' all day in the sun
Every morning there's a mountain to be moved
By the end of the day it's done
I love the hands of my workin' man
Touching me tenderly
I can feel the heart of my workin' man
When his hands are holdin' me
Workin' man's hands
Gentle as moonlight
Workin' man's hands
Strong as steel
He must of been thinking 'bout me
When the Lord made my workin' man's hands
Daddy always wanted the best for me
Wanted me to have more than he had
He dreamed of riches and finer things
But I'd rather have a workin' man
Like my dad
Workin' man's hands
Gentle as moonlight
Workin' man's hands
Strong as steel
He must of been thinking 'bout me
When the Lord made my workin' man's hands
Life can be hard in this world of ours
But it's easier when someone cares
So I'll take the hand of my workin' man
He's the answer to this workin' girls prayers
Workin' man's hands
Gentle as moonlight
Workin' man's hands
Strong as steel
He must of been thinking 'bout me
When the Lord made my workin' man's hands
