Tell ya what we're in a rut,
We're in a deep rut.
So habitual, predictable,
I'll tell ya what we ought to do.
We ought to drive away, fly away,
Find a way to get away.
We need a break from the same old thing of nothin' new.
Want to go out on a limb, on a whim, yeah.
That's the kind of mood I'm in.
Let's go somewhere, nowhere we've heard of.
Hang the sign out, Do Not Disturb Us!
Get a wake-up call about 3pm.
That's the kind of mood I'm in.
A little shake-up,
Take the chain and rattle it
Try to catch the wind and saddle it
Fall in love all over again, yeah.
That's the kind of mood I'm in.
I'll tell you this,
I want a kiss,
I want a long kiss.
The kind of deep,
That moves the ground,
Thing you used to do to me.
I want to dance a little, dream a little,
Baby, just live a little.
Make my heart rate elevate
Bring it up a few degrees.
Get me goin' with the wind, now and then, yeah.
That's the kind of mood I'm in.
Let's go somewhere, nowhere we've heard of.
Hang the sign out, Do Not Disturb Us!
Get a wake-up call about 3pm.
That's the kind of mood I'm in.
A little shake-up,
Take the chain and rattle it
Try to catch the wind and saddle it
Fall in love all over again, yeah.
That's the kind of mood I'm in.
Any hemisphere,
Change Of Atmosphere
Get me out of here right now!
Let's go somewhere, nowhere we've heard of.
Hang the sign out, Do Not Disturb Us!
Get a wake-up call about 3pm.
That's the kind of mood I'm in.
A little shake-up,
Take the chain and rattle it
Try to catch the wind and saddle it
Fall in love all over again, yeah.
That's the kind of mood I'm in.
Oh, that's the kind of mood I'm in.
