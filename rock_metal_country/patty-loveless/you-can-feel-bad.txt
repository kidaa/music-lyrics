Matraca Berg/Tim Krekel
The car is runnin' and your bags are packed
I guess that says it all
Your head is hangin' and you look real sad
Maybe you should've called
You say you think you need a brand-new start
You're really sorry that you broke my heart
Well, I'm not really fallin' apart, but baby
You can feel bad if it makes you feel better
Picture me cryin' reading all your love letters
Walkin' around in your old sweaters, baby
You can feel bad if it makes you feel better
Maybe I'll go out tonight, yeah, I'll paint the town
And maybe I'll run into you, while I'm runnin' 'round
There's a good chance I'll be alone
An even better one that you won't
And when it's time for me to go home, baby
You can feel bad if it makes you feel better
Picture me cryin' reading all your love letters
Walkin' around in your old sweaters, baby
You can feel bad if it makes you feel better
If it makes you feel something
Yeah, take another look at these tears I'm crying
They're not fallin' on your shoulders, they're fallin' on mine
Yeah, Ive seen this comin' for a long, long time
Now, I'll be just fine
You can feel bad if it makes you feel better
And picture me cryin' reading all your love letters
Walkin' around in your old sweaters, baby
You can feel bad if it makes you feel better
You can feel bad if it makes you feel better
And picture me cryin' reading all your love letters
Walkin' around in your old sweaters, baby
You can feel bad if it makes you feel better
If it makes you feel something
If it makes you feel better
