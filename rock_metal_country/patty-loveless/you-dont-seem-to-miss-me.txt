It's a long way off from where I should be goin'
And everytime, I hate to leave your side
But now when I return, there's somethin' missin'.
When I'm gone you don't seem to miss me.
Now life's so fast and everything is changing'
And if your changing too, then I don't blame you.
I remember how you used to kiss me,
But when I'm gone you don't seem to miss me.
I'm going back, I wonder why,
I'm runnin' fast to get home.
I just can't wait to see your face but
You don't seem to miss me.
No one can take away the things you've given,
And all the good we've had alone together
There was a time when you could not resist me.
Now I'm gone and you don't seem to miss me.
I'm going back, I wonder why,
I'm runnin' fast to get home.
I just can't wait to see your face but
You don't seem to miss me.
I can't wait to see your face
But you don't seem to miss me
