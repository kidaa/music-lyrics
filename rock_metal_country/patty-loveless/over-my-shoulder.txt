Marcus Hummon
Over my shoulder
My heart expects to see you runnin' after me
Callin' out my name
Over my shoulder
There's a coat you used to wrap me in to keep me warm
To keep near
Through the clouds still hang around me
Like my stormy love for you
The rain is fallin' softer now
The sun is breakin' through
Over my shoulder I see a rainbow
And is it heaven's way of sayin' I can let you go
And tomorrow morning I'll be one day older
And you will be a memory
One last look, over my shoulder
Over my shoulder
There're some words I said I wish I had back again
But it's out of my hands
Over my shoulder
Oh, the shadow of our love keeps reaching out for me
It won't set me free
With every step I ask myself
Which way should I go
It's hard to find your way across
A bridge  that's burning slow
Over my shoulder I see a rainbow
Is it heaven's way of sayin' I can let you go
Tomorrow morning I'll be one day older
And you will be a memory
One last look, over my shoulder
Tomorrow morning I'll be one day older
And you will be a memory
One last look, over my shoulder
Over my shoulder
