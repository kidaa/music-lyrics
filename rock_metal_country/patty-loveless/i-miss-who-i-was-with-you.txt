Jim Lauderdale/John Leventhal
They say I seem different now
Hope I'm wiser any how
I've had some time to learn a thing or two
I know the change has done me good
But I don't feel like I wish I would
Sometimes I miss who I was with you
Every time your name comes up
I just smile don't say too much
A button's pushed, my heart gets stuck again
I pray it's just a passing thought
'Cause we both know we're better off
But sometimes I miss who I was with you
Stormy days and sleepless nights
Sometimes we even got it right
Can't believe what we put each other through
In spite of all our chemistry
Some things just aren't meant to be
Sometimes I miss who I was with you
Every time your name comes up
I just smile don't say too much
A button's pushed, my heart gets stuck again
I pray it's just a passing thought
'Cause we both know we're better off
But sometimes I miss who I was with you
Yeah, sometimes I miss who I was with you
