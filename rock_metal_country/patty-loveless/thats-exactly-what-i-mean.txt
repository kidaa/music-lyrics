I feel a cold snap comin'
Frost on the window pane
Trees are green, bees are hummin'
But I'm freezing just the same
Can't put my finger on it
Where did we lose the flame
We'll both end up broken-hearted
If e don't find that fire again
Lately we've been missin' something
And love is wearing at the seams
And you say baby, awe, it ain't nothing
And that's exactly what I mean
Come every winter season
Most birds they fly away
It's warm down south, they got no reason
Why they should want t stay
When we take love for granted
We wind up empty handed
Love is wearing at the seams
And you say baby, awe, it ain't nothing
And that's exactly what I mean
Baby, turn off the TV
Come here and hold me tight
A little heat is all that we need
To bring love back to life
Maybe we've been missin' something
And love is wearing at the seams
And you say baby, awe, it ain't nothing
And that's exactly what I mean
