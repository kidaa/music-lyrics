For so long I've been on my own
Trying to find my heart a new home
I'd almost given up
Attempt to spend the years
Withering in sorrow
And drowning in my tears
Then you saved me
And my wounded pride
Saved me from dyin' inside
Freed me from those sad memories
Your love reached out and saved me
You have been a godsend to me
He sent you here to set my heart free
No more lonely days
And no more sleepless nights
A friend to take what's wrong
And make it alright
Then you saved me
And my wounded pride
Saved me from dyin' inside
Freed me from those sad memories
Your love reached out and saved me
Then you saved me
And my wounded pride
Saved me from dyin' inside
Freed me from those sad memories
Your love reached out and saved me
Your love reached out and saved me
