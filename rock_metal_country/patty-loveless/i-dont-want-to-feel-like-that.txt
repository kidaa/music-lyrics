Cried myself to sleep last night
And I don't want to feel like that no more
Woke up before the morning light
And I don't want to feel like that no more
I couldn't think one thought that  didn't start with your name
I couldn't see one day that wasn't more of the same
And I don't want to feel like that
I don't want to feel like that no more
I don't want to feel like that
I said I had to get it off my chest
I don't want to play that game no more
I could've lied a little more or less
But I don't want to play that game no more
If you're not willing to hear what I have to say
It's too late 'cause now I've said it anyway
And I don't want to feel like that
I don't want to feel like that no more
I don't want  to feel like my life's hanging by a string
I don't want to feel like I ain't feeling anything
I cried myself to sleep last night
And I don't want to feel like that no more
I said a prayer with all my might
Said I don't want to feel like this no more
Got myself in this mess, I can get myself out
Starting right here and I'm starting right now
'Cause I don't want to feel like that
I don't want to feel like that no more
I don't want to feel like that
I don't want to feel like that
I don't want to feel like that no more
I don't want to feel like that no more
