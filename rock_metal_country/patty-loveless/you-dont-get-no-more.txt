Well
I gave you my heart and what did you do?
You dragged it around  and you broke it in two.
You don't get no more.
You don't get no more.
When you use up my heart
You don't get no more no more.
Well
It's'a ";Honey, but this";
and ";Honey but that";
When you run out of buts
That's the end of that
You don't get no more.
You don't get no more.
When you run out of buts
You don't get no more no more.
Woah-oh
You only got one soul and that's a fact
You sell it to the devil and you don't get it back
You don't get no more.
You don't get no more.
When you sell your soul
You don't get no more no more.
Either get off or get on down the line
Your callin' card is runnin' out of time
Hey hey
Well
When your friends are all gone
And the money runs low
And your only true love is a high-dollar hoe
You don't get no more.
You don't get no more.
When your gold is gone
You don't get no more no more. No more.
When I stop singing it's the end of the song
When you stop listnin' it's time to move on
You don't get no more.
You don't get no more.
When you lost your friends
And you run out of rope,
When you sold your soul
And you're all out of hope,
When you break the only heart that I've got you don't
Get no more.
No more.
Uh-uh.
