Carter Stanley
It's been a long time
Since you drifted away
Now there's nothing to live for it seems
But darlin' no matter where you are tonight
Your here with me in my dreams
I'll never grow tired of you sweetheart
No matter what you may do
They tell me lately
Your livin' so wrong
But I'll never grow tired of you
I see your two blue eyes
Each night in my dreams
When I awake you're not there
Come back to me
And let's start life anew
Losing you's so hard to bear
I'll never grow tired of you sweetheart
No matter what you may do
They tell me lately
Your livin' so wrong
But I'll never grow tired of you
I still wonder why
You drifted away
From the happiness
That might have been
I vision the time
Some day you'd be mine
And treasure the love
I can't win
I'll never grow tired of you sweetheart
No matter what you may do
They tell me lately
Your livin' so wrong
But I'll never grow tired of you
