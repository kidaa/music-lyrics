Hank Williams, Sr.
Well I can't get you off of my mind
When I try, I'm just wastin' my time
Well I've tried and I've tried
And all night long I've cried
But I can't get you off of my mind
Well you think you would leave me behind
But I guess you're the good timin' kind
Do you think that it's smart
To jump from heart to heart
But I can't get you off of my mind
Well I can't get you off of my mind
When I try, I'm just wastin' my time
Well I've tried and I've tried
And all night long I've cried
But I can't get you off of my mind
You believe that a true love is blind
So you fool every new love you find
You've got stars in your eyes
But they can't hide your lies
But I can't get you off of my mind
Well I can't get you off of my mind
When I try, I'm just wastin' my time
Well I've tried and I've tried
And all night long I've cried
But I can't get you off of my mind
Well I can't get you off of my mind
When I try, I'm just wastin' my time
Well I've tried and I've tried
And all night long I've cried
But I can't get you off of my mind ...but I can't, no I can't
And I've tried and I've tried
But I can't get you off of my mind
