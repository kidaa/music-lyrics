Well, good mornin'
Tell me how'd you sleep last night
You're still smiling
So we must've done something right
Don't feel guilty
Because you turned to me last night
We ain't done nothin' wrong
We've just been lonely too long
No, we ain't done nothin' wrong
We've just been lonely too long
It's only natural
When you've been too long in the dark
To look for comfort
And to warm yourself by the fire
We're just afraid
That we might get our fingers burned
But we ain't done nothin' wrong
We've just been lonely too long
No, we ain't done nothin' wrong
We've just been lonely too long
Nothing's wrong that can't be cured
with a new love
All you need is someone like me to
be sure of, to be your love
I'll be waiting
Standing right outside your heart
And I'll be watching
For the slightest sign of a spark
And I'll be here
If you should want to turn to me
'Cause we ain't done nothin' wrong
We've just been lonely too long
No, we ain't done nothin' wrong
We've just been lonely too long
We ain't done nothin' wrong
We've both been lonely too long
Oh, just been lonely too long
Both been lonely too long
Just been lonely too long
