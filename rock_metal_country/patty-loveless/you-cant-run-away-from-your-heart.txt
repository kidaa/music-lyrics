Waldman / Photogio
When you said you love me
I believed it was true
It was true
And now you say you're leaving
Now you got me needing you
You go and say we're through
You say nothing last forever
That's so easy
You can walk away
But you won't be free
You can run everytime we touch
You can run when you feel to much
You can lie all alone in the dark
You can run from the one you need
You can run from the memories
But you can't run away from your heart
Said our love was real
More than any love you knew
It was good to you
But when I held you near me
I could feel all the fear in you
Runnin' through and through
You think tears are all that lie in true loves shadow
There's no place that you can run
Our love won't follow
You can run everytime we touch
You can run when you feel to much
You can lie all alone in the dark
You can run from the one you need
You can run from the memories
But you can't run away from your heart
You can run everytime we touch
You can run when you feel to much
You can lie all alone in the dark
You can run from the one you need
You can run from the memories
But you can't run away from your heart
No you can't run away
From your heart
