Bob DiPiero/Gary Nicholson
Two in the morning, too hot to sleep
Tossin' and turning and twistin' the sheets
I feel an old weakness coming on strong
Window wide open in the back bedroom
Smell of sweet honeysuckle in full bloom
I feel an old weakness coming on strong
Feel like I'm running real low on willpower
Can't get you out of this heart of mine
From the break of dawn till the midnight hour
I keep fighting to let you go
But your love is beyond my control
Took down that picture of you and me
But every time I look up where it used to be
I feel an old weakness coming on strong
Still got your number next to the phone
Just when I believe I can leave it alone
I feel an old weakness coming on strong
Feel like I'm running real low on willpower
Can't get you out of this heart of mine
From the break of dawn till the midnight hour
I keep fighting to let you go
But your love is beyond my control
It's an old weakness coming on strong
I feel an old weakness, an old weakness
I feel an old weakness coming on strong
