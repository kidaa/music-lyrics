Hall/Hall
Sometimes I get so angry with you
You treat me like an old worn out shoe
I've been here for you, for oh so long
One day you could reach and find me gone
One of these mornin's I could wake up with wings
And I'll be singin'
Fly away..I could fly away
And if I'm in your way
I could be gone tomorrow
Some days I love you
Some days I don't
First you say you will
And then again you won't
Well I guess all love
Has it's ups and downs
And maybe that's why
I stay around
But a woman can hurt
For just so long
And she'll start singin
That travelin' song
Fly away...I could fly away
And if I'm in your way
I could be gone tomorrow
Should be easy to keep
Our love alive
There is no reason
That we can't take the time
Yet we live as if we have centuries
All the world at which to be
But the end could come at any time
For a love like your's and mine
Fly away..I could fly away
And if I'm in your way
I could be gone tomorrow
Tomorrow..
I could fly away
I could fly away
I could fly away
I could fly away
