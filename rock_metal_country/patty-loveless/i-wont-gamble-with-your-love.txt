Scruggs/Welch
I've taken alot of chances
I've drawn to alot of bad cards
There was nothin I minded losing
So I never took losing to hard
Well since I won your love
I guess I've changed my ways
There's alot of games in this old town
But there's one I no longer play
I won't gamble with your love
I don't care to risk that much
One thing you can be sure of
I won't gamble with your love
How many times did I play for sevens
When I gave those dice a roll
I know all of my prayers were answered
Sometimes yes
But alot of times no
Now I know all I was after
Could be mine forever more
There are no other pleasures
I would trade my treasures for
I won't gamble with your love
I don't care to risk that much
One thing you can be sure of
I won't gamble with your love
These boys they come around
Say baby take a chance on me
I say no
They say why not?
Tell um I'm pretty happy with what I got
Anything else would be another long shot
I won't gamble with your love
I don't care to risk that much
One thing you can be sure of
I won't gamble with your love
I won't gamble with your love
