Patty Loveless
Whoever needed you
Well I did
Whoever wanted you
Well I did
Who said she loved you
More than anything
And be true
Well I did
Yes I did
Oh how I did
Who laid up many nights
Crying for you
Well I did
Oh how I did
Who was the fool
To give so much to you
Well I did
Yes I did
Oh how I did
Who said she loved you
More than anything
And be true
Well I did
Yes I did
Oh how I did
If anyone on earth
Could make me happy
Baby you could
And if we had a chance
And who would wait forever
Honey you know I would
Who said she loved you
More than anything
And be true
Well I did
Yes I did
Oh how I did
Who said she loved you
More than anything
And be true
Well I did
Yes I did
Oh how I did
