I've seen rock bottom
And I've sailed to the top
Now I'm somewhere in between
Believe that it's over
But sometimes still blue
There's no place so lonely
As bein' half over you
And I don't feel much like climbin'
And I don't want to fall
Here in the middle I don't feel much at all
I've almost excepted the fact that we're through
And there's no place so lonely
As being half over you
I wasn't as bad off
When first you were gone
Misery kept me company
Then I remember the heights
We've been to
There's no place so lonely
As being half over you
And I don't feel much like climbin'
And I don't want to fall
Here in the middle I don't feel much at all
I've almost excepted the fact that we're through
And there's no place so lonely
As being half over you
There's no place so lonely
As being half over you...
