Kostas
Score is tied between us
In this lovin' game
I hear you say you're leavin'
But I think you will stay
I'm doing everything I can
To try and change your mind
'Cause baby we can leave it here
We're going on overtime
Going on overtime
Going on overtime
Going on overtime
Going on overtime
Going on overtime
Baby take leaving off your mind
We're going on overtime
Now both of us are winners
Our love just can't lose
Don't look for your hat
Don't look for your coat
And don't worry 'bout your shoes
Lay back here in my lovin' arms
Get leaving off your mind
Love just crossed the 50 yard line
We're going on overtime
Going on overtime
Going on overtime
Going on overtime
Going on overtime
Going on overtime
Baby take leaving off your mind
We're going on overtime
Stay with me baby
Stay with me a while
Stay with me baby
Say it with your smile
Going on overtime
Going on overtime
Going on overtime
Going on overtime
I'm gonna love you
Out of your mind
We're going on overtime
Oh baby take leaving off your mind
We're going on overtime
