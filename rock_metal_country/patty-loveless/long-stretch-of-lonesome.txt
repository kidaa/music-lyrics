Never mind the struggle
Never mind these tears I cry
Through it all I will stay humble
As I keep a watchful eye
For that sweeter change of fortune
That's closer now than it's been
Where the memories that haunt me
Are gonna someday be my friend
When that long stretch of lonesome comes to an end
On some crazy river
But I still have control
And I will not surrender
I'll stay true to heart and soul
There's a sea of love awaiting
Down at the river's end
There I'll drown my sorrows
And there I'll live again
When that long stretch of lonesome comes to an end
When that long stretch of lonesome finally comes to an end
My heart belonging to someone
It'll never be longing again
And the shadows that have dogged me since I can't remember when
Finally give quarter
To the sunlight on my skin
When that long stretch of lonesome comes to an end
And the shadows that have dogged me since I can't remember when
Finally give quarter to the sunlight on my skin
When that long stretch of lonesome
When that long stretch of lonesome
When that long stretch of lonesome comes to an end
