Bob DiPiero/Pam Tillis
I can't make you stay, and boy I wouldn't want to
Go on walk away, but don't say I didn't warn you
Have you forgotten how it was
Before I wrapped you in my love
It's lonely, so lonely
Go on and get your share
But believe me baby
It's lonely out there 
You think there's some adventure that you're missin'
Some thrill undone or sweeter lips you could be kissin' 
So you wonder and you want to let go
Our love is dying for you to know
It's lonely, so lonely
Go on and get your share
But believe me baby
It's lonely out there 
There's people out there tryin' to look like they're havin' fun
Do you really want to be one
They're just remembering what they had
Or waitin' for their next chance at love
Love, Love, Love
It's lonely, so lonely
We got such a good thing here
Believe me, baby
It's lonely out there
It's lonely, so lonely
We got such a good thing here
Don't go now, baby
It's lonely out there
It's lonely out there
