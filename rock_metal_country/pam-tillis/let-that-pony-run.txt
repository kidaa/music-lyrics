Mary was married with children
Had the perfect suburban life
Till her husband came clean with the help of Jim Beam
And confessed all his sins in one night
Said he'd fallen in love with a barmaid
Said she made him free reckless and young
When he was through, what else could she do
She just let that pony run
'Cause you do what you gotta do
And you know what you know
You hang on till you can't hang on
Then you learn to let go
And you get what you need sometimes
When it's all said and done
You do what you gotta do
Then you let that pony run
Mary moved to West Virginia
After the shock wore off
She got a divorce and a chestnut horse
And a barn with an old hayloft
Sometimes she rides by the river
Says it makes her feel reckless and young
She just closes her eyes and she holds on tight
And she lets that pony run
'Cause you do what you gotta do
And you know what you know
You hang on till you can't hang on
Then you learn to let go
And you get what you need sometimes
When it's all said and done
You do what you gotta do
Then you let that pony run
Let that pony run
