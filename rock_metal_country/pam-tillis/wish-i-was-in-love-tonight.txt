The stage is set
The lights are low
Soft music on the radio
The sheets are fresh
The wine is cold
And nights like this
Were made for love
And now there is only one thing wrong
I wonder why I'm all alone
Oh, I wish I was in love tonight
Then everything would be alright
With someone to love
I take a look at all I've got
It doesn't really mean alot
With no one to love
I can't help but fantasize
Of looking into hungry eyes
Instead of all this empty space
I reach out and touch his face
We take our time, no need to rush
That's the way I wish I was
Oh, I wish I was in love tonight
Then everything would be alright
With someone to love
I take a look at all I've got
It doesn't really mean alot
With no one to love
Oh, I wish I was in love tonight
Then everything would be alright
With someone to love
