I walked into the club last night
I hadn't been there for so long
Thinking foolishly I might find you sitting all alone
But oh how dreams lie
When she put her arms around you
And I watched you close your eyes
Ain't no two ways about it, something here had changed
Ain't no going back now, to that same old same
Used to be, you were always there for me
Now there's one thing I know, that's when to cash 'em in
God I hate to lose you, but there's no way I can win
And I'm finding out, ain't no two ways about it now
The lights were not too dim to see what was really going on
As the truth occurred to me, the band began to play our song
And you swirled her across the floor
But the thing that got me most
Was when you waltzed her out the door
Ain't no two ways about it, something here had changed
Ain't no going back now, to that same old same
Used to be, you were always there for me
Now there's one thing I know, that's when to cash 'em in
God I hate to lose you, but there's no way I can win
And I'm finding out, ain't no two ways about it now
Now there's one thing I know, that's when to cash 'em in
Oh, God I hate to lose you, but it's looking like the end
And I'm finding out, ain't no two ways about it
Finding out, ain't no two ways about it now
Oh, ain't no two ways
