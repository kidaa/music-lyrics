Susan Longacre/Walt Aldridge
Who's that knocking in the middle of the night
With a hand full of flowers to make it all right
If you're thinking I'll forgive you one more time
I ain't that lonely and love ain't that blind
I'd be better off blue for a couple of nights
Better blue now than the rest of my life
Better off finding somebody new
After what you put me through
Baby, I'm better off blue
Wasn't it you who said it was over
Now you're out there wanting back in
It's the same old book with a brand new cover
I'd have to be crazy to read it again
I'd be better off blue for a couple of nights
Better blue now than the rest of my life
Better off finding somebody new
After what you put me through
Baby, I'm better off blue
Better off blue as a midnight hour
Blue as the heart of a red hot flame
Better than buying your lame excuses
Praying somehow someday you'll change
I'd be better off blue for a couple of nights
Better blue now than the rest of my life
Better off finding somebody new
After what you put me through
Baby, I'm better off blue
