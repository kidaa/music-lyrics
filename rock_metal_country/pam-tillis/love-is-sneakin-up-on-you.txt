First time that you caught my eye
I said to myself that guy is a little bit gun shy
Gonna have to be sly
I knew that it would be wrong
If I came on too strong
Gonna treat it with kid gloves
You're so suspicious of love
Oh love is sneaking up on you
It's gonna get you before i'm through
My heart's learned a trick or two
And love is sneaking up on you
I'll take you unaware
I'll act like I don't care
Knowing that you're not immune
To the spell of my perfume
I might have to bend the rules
Make some unorthodox moves
Even though you don't know it yet
I have never lost a bet
Oh love is sneaking up on you
It's gonna get you before i'm through
My heart's learned a trick or two
And love is sneaking up on you
Every night you're on the town
Turning some new heart around
It's gonna be so sweet
When you admit defeat
Oh love is sneaking up on you
It's gonna get you before i'm through
My heart's learned a trick or two
And love is sneaking up on you
