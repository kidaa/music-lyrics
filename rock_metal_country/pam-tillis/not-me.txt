I followed you around like a little lost child barely dancin' with your shadow
I didn't say a thing, I let you run wild 'til your love pierced me like an arrow
Right to the heart right straight through the heart, you broke it in two
Hey way to go you let me go crazy without you
I won't go through that again, no not me
Once is enough to be somebody's fool
You may find someone else willing to lose themselves
Be what you want them to be, but not me, oh no
I'm sorry darlin' sounds too familiar to me
You've become a broken record
You stole my love and ran like a fumblin'thief so why should I trust you with forever
I'm outta here gone without a tear, yeah I cried'em all away
I've gotta leave, I'd have to be crazy to stay
I won't go through that again, no not me
Once is enough to be somebody's fool
You may find someone else willing to lose themselves
Be what you want them to be, but not me
I won't go through that again, no not me
Once is enough to be somebody's fool
You may find someone else willing to lose themselves
Be what you want them to be
But not me
