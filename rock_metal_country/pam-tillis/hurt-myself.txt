Savannah Snow
Ain't tried cigarettes
There is always alcohol
I could stay up all night long
Don't need to sleep at all
I've got credit cards
I could run'em up
I could play with knives
I could drink and drive
And if that ain't enough
If I need another way to hurt myself
If I really miss the heartache
If I wanna hear some empty promises
If I really need the pain
I know where to find you
If I need another way to hurt myself
I've got memories
I could dig'em up
I could play a losing head
Just to try my luck
Go out every night
Find someone to love
I could walk the wire
I could play with fire
And if that ain't enough
If I need another way to hurt myself
If I really miss the heartache
If I wanna hear some empty promises
If I really need the pain
I know where to find you
If I need another way to hurt myself
And if I wanna love somebody
Who wants me to be somebody else
Well, I know where to find you
If I need another way to hurt myself
Ain't tried cigarettes
