Baby I've got this sinkin' feeling
I've done something I can't undo
And I could kick myself from Tennessee to Texas
If I just lost the love I found with you
So tell me I just gotta know, how too far did I go
And how gone is goodbye
Is that last bridge burnin'
Is that point of no returnin'
What I'm seeing in your eyes
How gone, how gone is goodbye
Well I'm afraid that I already know the answer
Oh just this once I'd sure like to be wrong
And I could wake up in your arms tomorrow morning
And live without this deep regret down in my bones
Have I pushed you to the limit
What's your plan, and am I in it
And how gone is goodbye
Is that last bridge burnin'
Is that point of no returnin'
What I'm seeing in your eyes
How gone, how gone is goodbye
Tell me, I've just gotta know, how too far did I go
And how gone is goodbye
Is that last bridge burnin'
Is that point of no returnin'
What I'm seeing in your eyes
How gone, how gone is goodbye
How gone is goodbye
Have you drawn the final curtain
Come on baby, are you certain
We can't give it one more try
How gone, how gone is goodbye
