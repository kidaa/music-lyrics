You just wanna be weird
You're just hopin' that someone will notice you
Go ahead and be weird
'Cause we know it's just a phase you're goin' through
You're so concerned with being cool
You're so concerned with being hip
And every move is for effect
But just how strange can you get
You haven't scratched the surface yet
Go ahead and be weird
Dye your hair so it will match your purple shoes
We all know that you're weird
We read your fashion statement in the village news
And I quote
You're so concerned with the absurd
You're so concerned with being heard
And everybody things you're it
There must be somethin' that I missed
I think your sense of humor's sick
You're so concerned with being cool
You're so concerned with being hip
And every move is for effect
But just how strange can you get
You haven't scratched the surface yet
You just wanna to be weird
Teach me how to be weird
Teach me how to be weird
