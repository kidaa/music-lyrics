Pam Tillis/Dean Dillon
I ain't even gonna to ask you
I can read you like a book
Girl if I ever saw one that's an
I can't believe I did that look
You look like something that the cat drug in
So I won't kick you while you're down
Just let me tell you friend to friend
'Bout a block I've been around
Did you really think last night would last forever
Did you really think that guy hung the moon
Right now you hate yourself 'cause you knew better
But there's no use crying over spilled perfume
There's a big difference between lonely
And lonely for way too long
And I knew when he made his move
You weren't feeling all that strong
So I bit my tongue 'cause I saw it coming
As you danced so close to him
It's two steps forward and three steps back
When a heart is on the mend
Did you really think last night would last forever
Did you really think that guy hung the moon
Right now you hate yourself 'cause you knew better
But there's no use crying over spilled perfume
You fell in a moment of weakness
Well you just got to pull yourself back up
Dry your morning-after tears
'Cause what's done is done
Did you really think last night would last forever
Did you really think that guy hung the moon
Right now you hate yourself 'cause you knew better
But there's no use crying over spilled perfume
No use crying over, no use crying over
No use crying over, spilled perfume
