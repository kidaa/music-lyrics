Under the sun, under the moon
Under the sky midnight blue
Under the maple, under the roof
I got down on my knees and told the truth
I told Him I was tired of feeling lonely
And I could really use my one and only
Oh, oh, I said a prayer for you baby
And somehow it got through
Oh, oh, I said a prayer for you baby
Now look at you
Wasn't God feelin' good that day
Na na na na na na
I heard you praying for
Na na na na na na
I got more, so much more
Just down the street, just down the road
Walking along, how could you have known
It must have been strange that little burning in your soul
Sorry 'bout the lightnin' bolt
But I told him I was tired of being lonely
And I could really use my one and only
Oh, oh, I said a prayer for you baby
And somehow it got through
Oh, oh I said a prayer for you baby
Now look at you
Wasn't God feelin' good that day
I said a prayer for you . . .
