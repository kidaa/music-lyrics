We can talk and talk all night
If you want to that's all right
Till I've heard every word you've got to say
Go ahead and take your time
If you've got something on your mind
But it won't change the way I feel anyway
That's ancient history to me now
Something we don't have to talk about
You know I love you anyhow
That's ancient history to me now
There's a tale you've got to tell,
How you stumbled and then you fell
But I guess I knew that all along
And, my love, there's time when we
Are weaker than we'd like to be
And I could tell some stories of my own
That's ancient history to me now
Something we don't have to talk about
You know I love you anyhow
That's ancient history to me now
You know I love you anyhow
That's ancient history to me now
