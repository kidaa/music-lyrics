Her lips and her dress 
They're both ruby red 
She thinks that's how you hide 
The pain you feel inside 
And she comes out every night 
To soak-up the neon light 
Her perfume fills the air 
People stop and stare
But Blue Rose is looking for the moon in someone's eyes 
Blue Rose is willing to believe in someone's lies 
Blue Rose's pedals have been crushed along the way 
Oh Blue Rose is just growing bluer everyday
One more drink, one more dance 
You might be her only chance 
She needs someone to hold 
When the night is growing old 
And if you don't mind the thorns 
She'll take you in and keep you warm 
Lyin' in the dark 
In a bed of broken hearts
But Blue Rose is looking for the moon in someone's eyes 
Blue Rose is willing to believe in someone's lies 
Blue Rose's pedals have been crushed along the way 
Oh Blue Rose is just growing bluer everyday
