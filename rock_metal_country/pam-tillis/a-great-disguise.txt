Even Stevens/Greg Barnhill/Hillary Kanter
People talkin', think I'm alright
Think I'm doin' fine
Goin' through the motioms of my life
Go to work now, every mornin'
Yeah, I play the part
Hide away the contents of my solemn heart
But when the sun goes down
And the moon is high
I can't control the flow of all these tears inside
And if they only knew
They'd be so surprised
I'm just a good pretender in a great disguise
Keep'em guessin', keep'em laughin'
Build the wall up high
Long as they don't see the other side
You've really done it, done a number
A number of my soul
There's no way I'll ever let you know
But when the sun goes down
And the moon is high
There's no way to hide the truth from me, myself and I
Yeah, I wear it well
Though it ain't my size
I'm just a good pretender in a great disguise
I'm not one to show emotion like some folks I see
I won't wear my heart out on my sleeve
I don't miss you, not for a minute I'm gonna be OK
Words of wisdom spoken by the light of day
But when the sun goes down
And the moon is high
Your memory pulls me under like a strong rip tide
I'm still in love with you
It's all smoke and lies
