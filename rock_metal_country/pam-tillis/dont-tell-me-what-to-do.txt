Track 3 - Time 3:12
We tried and we tried but it's over
Guess I didn't fit the imagine in your mind
Now you tell me to find another lover
But baby aren't you gettin' outta line
Don't tell me what to do
You've already said we are through
I'm a page that you have turned
I'm no longer your concern
So don't tell me what to do
I'll love you forever if I want to
You're no longer in charge on my thinkin'
You're already in love with someone else
So if I'm into all night honky tonkin'
Well I'm a big girl, I can take care of myself
So don't tell me what to do
You've already said we are through
I'm a page that you have turned
I'm no longer your concern
So don't tell me what to do
I'll love you forever if I want to
So don't tell me what to do
You've already said we are through
I'm a page that you have turned
I'm no longer your concern
So don't tell me what to do
I'll love you forever if I want to
