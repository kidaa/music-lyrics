Tonight I am the hero that you dream
Tonight I am the angel that you see
Tonight We shine with love so new
But time alone will tell us what is true
Cause time can bring an angel down to earth
And time stands every hero 'gainst the world
In time All lover's dreams touch down
And love must live much closer to the ground
When I'm just a man
When I'm just a woman
Will you love me then
Will you love me when
Love is only human
Cause love can give a man the strength to fight
And love can make a woman's burdens light
And love in time forgives us all
When heroes fail, when the angels fall
When I'm just a man
When I'm just a woman
Will you love me then
Will you love me when
Love is only human
When we know each other through and through
With all our imperfections
If we fall short of heaven
I'll still love you
I'll love you
When I'm just a man
When I'm just a woman
I will love you then
Somewhere under heaven
When I'm just a man
When I'm just a woman
I will love you then
I will love you when
Love is only human
