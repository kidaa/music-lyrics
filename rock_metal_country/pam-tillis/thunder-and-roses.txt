Once I had flowers at sunset
Breakfast in bed
And I hated myself for what I never felt
I couldn't love him
Then I had fire at midnight
Passion that brough tears to my eyes
It was like a joke, I couldn't get enough
But he didn't love me
I want to know why I can't have both
Someone that soothes my heart
And burns my soul
Something I can trust
But I can't control
All I need is someone who brings me
Thunder and roses
I want to be safe and warm
In a beautiful storm
With somebody who shakes me
And knows how to take me away from this world
Candies that burn all night
A lover that looks into my eyes
A man who loves me
And knows how to touch me everywhere
I want to know why I can't have both
Someone that soothes my heart
And burns my soul
Something I can trust
But I can't control
All I need is someone who brings me
Thunder and roses
