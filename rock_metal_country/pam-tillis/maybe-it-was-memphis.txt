looking at you through a misty moonlight
catydid sing like a symphony
porch swing swayin' like tenessee lulaby
melody blowin through a wilow tree
what was I supposed to do?
standing there looking at you
lonely boy far from home
Maybe it was memphis
maybe it was southern summer nights
maybe it was you maybe it was me
but it sure felt right
read about you in a faulkner novel
met you once in a william's play
heard about you in a country love song
summer nights beauty took my breath away
what was I supposed to do
standing there looking at you
lonely boy far form home
Maybe it was Memphis
maybe it was southern summer nights
maybe it was you maybe it was me
but it sure felt right
maybe it was Memphis
maybe it was southern summer nights
maybe it was you maybe it was me
but it sure felt right
every night now since I've been back home
lie awake drifting in my memory
think about you on my momma's front porch swing
talking that way so soft to me
what was I supposed to do
standing there looking at you
lonely boy far form homw
maybe it was memphis
maybe it was southern summer nights
maybe it was you maybe it was me
but it sure felt right
maybe it was memphis
maybe it was southern summer nights
maybe it was you maybe it was me
but it sure felt right
maybe it was you maybe it was me
but it sure felt right
