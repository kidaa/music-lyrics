You say you're not missin' me darlin' 
I know you are and always will be
I saw you at the club actin' so in love
Ah, but that don't mean nothing to me
'Cause as you danced by, that look in your eye
Showed me where your heart is secretly
Guess I'll be seeing you in the middle of the blues
You can't have a good time without me
You can't have a good time without me
You're going to see me in your memory
You're going to hear me in that melody
You can't have a good time without me
I remember those sweet nights with you dear
When I had you all to myself
Now those times are gone, but love still lingers on
You won't find with anyone else
Ah, well you may wear a smile, fool yourself awhile
But your heart and your mind will disagree
So I'll be seeing you in the middle of the blues
'Cause you can't have a good time without me
You can't have a good time without me
You're going to see me in your memory
You're going to hear me in that melody
You can't have a good time without me
You can't have a good time
No you just can't have no fun
You can't have a good time without me
