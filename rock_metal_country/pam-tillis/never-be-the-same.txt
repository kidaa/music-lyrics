From the highest highs
To the lowest lows
We've gone as fare as two can go
And we'll never, never be the same
And we fought to keep our love alive
When it was hard enough just to survive
And we'll never, never be the same
Looking at old photographs
Can you believe we dressed like that
Two crazy kids that nobody could tame
Would we do it all again
If someone had told us then
That we'd never, never be the same
Though we can't go back again
We always will remember when
All the world was new and kinda strange
Yes we always loved a good surprise
Now there's nothin' that we haven't tried
And we'll never, never be the same
Must be doin' somethin' right
Seems we've grown alot alike
Livin' in a state of constant change
Older now we realize
We had to learn to compromise
And we'll never, never be the same
Must be doin' somethin' right
Seems we've grown alot alike
Livin' in a state of constant change
Older now we realize
We had to learn to compromise
And we'll never, never be the same
Never, never be the same
We'll never be the same
