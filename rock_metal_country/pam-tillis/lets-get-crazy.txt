It's a potentially dangerous situation
Baby you're my kind of trouble
Livin' ain't livin' if you don't take risks
Can't you feel the magic whenever we kiss
Oh we'd both be crazy
To turn our backs on a feelin' like this
Some temptation
You should never resist
Oh baby let's get crazy
Let's get crazy
We just can't turn our backs on a feelin' like this
We're just like two gamblers with nothing to lose
Taking chances and we're playing with fire
But the night offers something that we can't refuse
And it's more fun when the stakes are higher
It's much too strong for us to fight
And we can't go wrong with a feelin' this right
Oh we'd both be crazy
To turn our backs on a feelin' like this
Some temptation
You should never resist
Oh baby let's get crazy
Let's get crazy
We just can't turn our backs on a feelin' like this
It's much too strong for us to fight
We can't go wrong with a feelin' this right
Oh we'd both be crazy to turn our backs
On a feelin' like this
Some temptation
You should never resist
Oh baby let's get crazy
Let's get crazy
We just can't turn our backs on a feelin' like this
