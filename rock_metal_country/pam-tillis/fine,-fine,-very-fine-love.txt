I never knew how good a love could be
All I'd ever known was make believe
So many times I played the fool
Baby, till I met you
Now everything has fallen in place
You can tell by the smile on my face
For every lonely tear that I've cried
I'm that much satisfied
We've got a fine, fine, very fine love
We've got a fine, fine, very fine love
You know it when you find one, shining like a diamond
It's so fine, fine, very fine love
You are more precious to me every day
Life is better now in every way
You don't have to lay the world at my feet
You have made my world complete
We've got a fine, fine, very fine love
We've got a fine, fine, very fine love
You know it when you find one, shining like a diamond
It's so fine, fine, very fine love
I've got no apprehensions
You've got the best intentions
We've got a, we've got a fine, fine, very fine love
We've got a fine, fine, very fine love
We've got a fine, fine, very fine love
You know it when you find one, shining like a diamond
It's so fine, fine, very fine love
