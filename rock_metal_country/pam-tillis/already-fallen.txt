You come banging on the screen door
Begging me to let you in
All I got to say is, ";Honey, where you been?";
This time I think it's you that's surrenderin'
You see I've already fallen
Yeah, I've already fallen
If you're waiting on me you're backing up
I'm way in over my head in love
It's true
Well, I've aleady fallen for you
Well you look so serious leaning on the Frigidaire
And, gee, it's sweet of you to ask me if I really care
Honey, I'm already picking out the silverware.
You see I've already fallen
Yeah, I've already fallen
If you're waiting on me you're backing up
I'm way in over my head in love
It's true
Well, I've aleady fallen for you
I must have played this scene out a hundred times in my head
That you'd look me in the eyes and say
You love me like you just did
But you'd better tell me twice
cause I'm still one step ahead
You see I've already fallen
Yeah, I've already fallen
If you're waiting on me you're backing up
I'm way in over my head in love
It's true
Well, I've aleady fallen for you
Yeah, I've already fallen for you
