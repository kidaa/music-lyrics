Walt Aldridge, John Jarrard 

You know everyday I walk down memory lane 
Trying to find a way past the same old pain 
Ah you know, but now the message is loud and it's clear 
There ain't no way to get there from here 

Chorus: 
Yeah I've finally realized that's the way things are 
I got the bleeding stopped but there's gonna be a scar 
I know I'll go on living but you're always gonna be around 
Deep down, deep down 

Well, I know an old soldier who walks with a limp 
From a war he's still fightin' inside of him 
And just like me he'll go to his grave 
Nursin' a pain that won't go away 

Chorus 

Maybe I really don't wanna be through 
With all the memories I have of you 
We had some bad times but we had good times too 

Chorus 

You'll always be around 
Deep down
