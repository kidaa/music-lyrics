Now Betty was your average ordinary girl
Never wanted very much out of this world
Just an occasional dinner and twirl, from a regular guy
So Betty sat up one lonely night
Trying to figure out what a man might like
Then like a bolt right out of the blue, she got herself a plan
Betty's got a bass boat, Betty's got a truck, all of a sudden things are looking up
She's the most popular girl in town, since she got a new camper and a huntin' hound
Might be coincidental, oh you just might never know
Oh, but things sure got a lot better since Betty got a bass boat
Now lately getting a date isn't all that hard
There's a half a dozen Bubba's fightin' in the yard
She won 'em over with her Southern Charm, and a satellite dish
Now Betty can't believe her popularity
She's thinkin 'bout marketing her recipe
So ironic and the funny thing is, she never even liked to fish
Betty's got a bass boat, Betty's got a truck, all of a sudden things are looking up
She's the most popular girl in town, since she got a new camper and a huntin' hound
Might be coincidental, oh you just might never know
Oh, but things sure got a lot better since Betty got a bass boat
She's got bowling shoes, she can't lose
She's got those boys just blowin' their fuse
She's got a big screen, she's in the in scene
They're ever gonna make her Strawberry Queen
Betty's got a bass boat, Betty's got a truck, all of a sudden things are looking up
She's the most popular girl in town, since she got a new camper and a huntin' hound
Might be coincidental, oh you just might never know
Oh, but things sure got a lot better since Betty got a bass boat
