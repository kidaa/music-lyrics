Pam Tillis/Bob DiPiero/Jan Buckingham
Track 7 - Time 3:13
Well I said he had a lot of potential
He was only misunderstood
You know he didn't really mean to treat me so bad
He wanted to be good
And I swore one day I would tame him
Even though he loved to run hog wild
Just call me Cleopatra everybody, 'cause I'm the Queen of Denial
I knew he didn't have any money
Yeah that's why he couldn't buy me a ring
Oh and just because he bought himself a brand new pickup truck
Really didn't prove anything
And he never had to say he loved me
I could see it every time he smiled
Just call me Cleopatra everybody, 'cause I'm the Queen of Denial
Oh Queen of Denial, buyin' all his alibis
Queen of Denial, floatin' down a river of lies
Well I'm not gonna jump to conclusions
Or throw away this perfect romance
Even though I caught him dancin' last night
With a girl in a leopard skin pants
Yeah, he's probably stuck in traffic
And he'll be here in a litte while
Just call me Cleopatra everybody, 'cause I'm the Queen of Denial
Oh Queen of Denial, buyin' all his alibis
Queen of Denial, just floatin' down a river of lies
