There's a tomcat in the alley scarin' up a fight
There's a mother softly kissing her little one goodnight
There's peace and then there's chaos, reality and dreams
We're all trying to strike a balance between a whisper and a scream
Sometimes I need atttention when you need left alone
Sometimes you feel like clinging when I feel like being gone
But love me soft and tender and we'll make the rafters ring
As long as we meet somewhere between a whisper and a scream
Well, I know you'll be listening
And you know I'll be there
Between a whisper and a scream we'll find a prayer
Well I used to blow up easy and put my fist right through a wall
You were shut down like a holiday not feeling much at all
But we met there at the crossroad goin' to extremes
Thank God we found each other between a whisper and a scream
Somehow we found each other between a whisper and a scream
