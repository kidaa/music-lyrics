There's no mistakin' what's taken place here,
I can't pretend anymore,
You know that I love you, but its not enough
To keep you away from my door.
Now its too late to wonder what's left to be tried
Your mind's made up and my hands are tied.
It's just one of those things
That I can't do nothing about
Your love is something that
I'm gonna have to learn to live without
I could beg, I could plead and get down on my knees
But I think I've finally figured it out
It's just one of those things
I can't do nothing about.
So bring on the tears and bring on the heartaches
Let me get on with my pain
If this is good-bye then let's get it over
There's nothing left to explain
Now God knows I've tried, I've tried for so long 
What's left of my heart will have to be strong
It's just one of those things
That I can't do nothing about
Your love is something that
I'm gonna have to learn to live without
I could beg, I could plead and get down on my knees
But I think I've finally figured it out
It's just one of those things
I can't do nothing about
Well it's all I can stand, but it's out of my hands
Your leaving is leaving more room for doubt
It's just one of those things
I can't do nothing about
