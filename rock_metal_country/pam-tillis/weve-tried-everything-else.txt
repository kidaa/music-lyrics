Going out every night
Doing all the wrong things to feel alright
Waking up all alone
Dying to call you on the telephone
I moved way across town
And you've got someone new hanging round
Neither one of us is feeling any better
All we've been doing is fooling ourselves
Baby, you and me were meant to be together
Let's try love again
We've tried everything else
You hurt me, I hurt you
Don't make no difference, it's the same shade of blue
Other arms, other lips
Only remind me that it's you I miss
You say you've been feeling the same
Why don't we stop playing this game?
Neither one of us is feeling any better
All we've been doing is fooling ourselves
Baby, you and me were meant to be together
Let's try love again
We've tried everything else
We thought we'd be better off apart
But that's not what we're hearing from our hearts
Neither one of us is feeling any better
All we've been doing is fooling ourselves
Baby, you and me were meant to be together
Let's try love again
We've tried everything else
