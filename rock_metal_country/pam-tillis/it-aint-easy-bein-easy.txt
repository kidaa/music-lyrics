Surely you can sit down a while
Maybe you can even smile
And I'll try to pretend
That you love me again
But it might take me a little while
Soon you'll be holding me tight
You'll know when the moment is right
I was broken into
It was all because of you
But baby I need you tonight
It ain't easy to be easy you know
You're the one who took my heart and my soul
Walked away and left me out of control
It ain't easy bein' easy
I might end up lonely again
But once you were my closest friend
So I'll hold you and cry
With the truth in my eyes
Hopin' you'll love me again
It ain't easy to be easy you know
You're the one who took my heart and my soul
Walked away and left me out of control
It ain't easy to be easy you know
It ain't easy when you're needin' someone
It ain't easy bein' under the gun
I'll surrender even though I should run
It ain't easy bein' easy
