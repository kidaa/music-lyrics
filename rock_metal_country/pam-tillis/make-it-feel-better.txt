You are a stranger, a stranger to me
One more face without a history
I've been so lonely, so lonely too long
That tonight all my inhibitions are gone
And you got no lines that I haven't heard
Anyway, a kiss is worth a thousand words
Just make it feel better
Make it feel better
Tell me that you understand
Make it feel better, make it feel better
Baby I know you can, I know you can
Modern life is like a battle ground
All the pressures tend to wear you down
oh, sometimes I feel like I'm in shock
Maybe baby you could be my rock
It's a national obsession to find a cure
I'm no different, that's for sure
Just make it feel better
Make it feel better
Tell me that you understand
Make it feel better, make it feel better
Baby I know you can, I know you can
You may forgive, but you never forget
And you tell everybody you got no regrets
You take your chances and sometimes you lose
And you need someone to get you over the blues
Just make it feel better
Make it feel better
Tell me that you understand
Make it feel better, make it feel better
Baby I know you can, I know you can
