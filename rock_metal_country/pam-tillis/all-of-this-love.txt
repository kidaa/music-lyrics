John Paul Daniel/Chapin Hartford/Jule Medders
Have you ever seen a wild magnolia
There's only one place it grows
On the shady banks of the Tennessee River
Sheltered, untouched and alone
There's a place in my heart where nobody has been
And I keep it for you
There's a door to my dreams and one day you'll walk in
And until that day I'll be true
'Cause I can't wait to see what you'll do
With all of this love that I'm saving for you
All of this love
Can't wait to see what you'll do
With all of this love
All of this love that I'm saving for you
Do you ever feel the ache and the hunger
And do you look for me too
Sometimes at night when I lie awake and I wonder
Shadows of doubt fill my room
And the darkness falls and I stare at the walls
'Til you come into view
And I picture your face and the time and the place
You're a dream waiting to come true
And I can't wait to see what you'll do
With all of this love that I'm saving for you
All of this love
Can't wait to see what you'll do
With all of this love
All of this love that I'm saving for you
All of this love that I'm saving for you
