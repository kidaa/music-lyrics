Roger Brown/Jason Sellers
You're here in my arms right where you say you wanna be
While across the room I watch the one who set you free
It didn't take me long to mend the heart she tore in two
I guess they just don't break 'em like they used to
I bet she thought that wounded pride of yours would never heal
But you don't have one single scar as far as I can feel
And I see nothing but perfection when I look at you
I guess they just don't break 'em like they used to
They don't break 'em like they used to, darling that's for sure
We're living proof there's nothing that true love can't cure
We put the pieces back together now you're good as new
I guess they just don't break 'em like they used to
All the tears have disappeared without a trace
Makes me think that heartaches don't last as long these days
We put the pieces back together now you're good as new
I guess they just don't break 'em like they used to
They don't break 'em like they used to, darling that's for sure
We're living proof there's nothing that true love can't cure
We put the pieces back together now you're good as new
I guess they just don't break 'em like they used to
I guess they just don't break 'em like they used to
