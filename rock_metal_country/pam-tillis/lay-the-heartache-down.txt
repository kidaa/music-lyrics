Jamie O'Hara
You've been spreadin' the blues
All over the place
Walking around with that look on your face
Teardrops fallin hard on the cold cold ground
It's time you lay the heartache down
Well I know shes done you wrong
I know she told you lies
Said forever then goodbye
Made you feel like the biggest fool in town
But its time to lay the heartache down
Lay the heartache down and
Leave the memories
She ain't worth all the misery
Somebody loves you baby can't you see
Turn around and take a look at me
I wanna warm your heart
I wanna cool your mind
Love you tender and treat you kind
But I can't wait forever for you to come around
Well it's time to lay the heartache down

Lay the heartache down and
Leave the memories
She ain't worth all the misery
Somebody loves you baby can't you see
Turn around and take a look at me
I wanna warm your heart
I wanna cool your mind
Love you tender and treat you kind
But I can't wait forever for you to come around
Well it's time to lay the heartache down
