You make all the right moves
And you talk so smooth
And you look like a winner to me
With your sure-shot savvy, you're my heart's desire
And I'm happy to be standing in your line of fire
You don't miss
You don't miss
With your right-on-the-money-honey kiss
You don't miss
You don't miss
And you're love is a direct hit
Everything about you strikes me as wonderful
The way you dress, the way you dance
I don't know where you learned what you learned
Tell me, have you ever been to France
You don't miss
You don't miss
With your right-on-the-money-honey kiss
You don't miss
You don't miss
And you're love is a direct hit
With your sure-shot savvy, you're my heart's desire
Happy to be standing in your line of fire
You don't miss
You don't miss
With your right-on-the-money-honey kiss
You don't miss
You don't miss
And you're love is a direct hit
