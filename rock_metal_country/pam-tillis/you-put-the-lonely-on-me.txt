Leslie Winn Satcher
A baseball glove in the second grade put this little scar on my chin
And at 31 they put glasses on me when I couldn't tell an ";h"; from an  ";n";
I bounced back from all of that
Nothin's ever bothered me
Until you put the lonely on me
You put the blue, you put the fool, you put the tears on my face
You put the rain in an otherwise sunny day
Baby, you......you put the lonely on me
Now every little thought is a bridge to cross 'cause everyone's a  memory of you
First they make me sad then they make me mad then they make me wanna forget the truth
I bounced back from all of that 'til I see you out on the street
And then you put the lonely on me
Well, now you put the blue, you put the fool, you put the tears on my face
You put the rain in an otherwise sunny day
I can't recover
I can't get over watching you walk away
I get all shook up when I think about losin' your love
Baby you....you put the lonley on me
