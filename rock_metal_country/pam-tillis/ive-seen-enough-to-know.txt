I know it was pretty strange timing
And maybe the odds were bad
We were awkward as a couple of left-footed dancers,
Baby we were pretty sad
You tried to tell me that it just wouldn't work
Your heart was too far gone
And it might have been easier to leave you alone
I've seen enough to know, a heart worth savin'
Enough to know, a chance worth takin'
Even though you're tryin' not to let it show
There's a part of you that's dyin', dyin' to let go
I've seen enough to know,
I've seen enough to know
There's a light in your eyes and a warmth to your touch
That wasn't there yesterday
And there's a crack in the wall
That you've built around your heart
And it's startin' to give way
It's taken time, it's taken patience waiting in the dark
But my intuition's been right on the money so far
I've seen enough to know, a chance worth takin'
Enough to know, a heart worth savin'
Even though you're tryin' not to let it show
There's a part of you that's dyin', dyin' to let go
I've seen enough to know,
I've seen enough to know
Now there's signs of life and there's signs of hope
Signs of a real love starting to grow
Even though you're tryin' not to let it show
There's a part of you that's dyin', dyin' to let go
I've seen enough to know,
I've seen enough to know
You know it's startin' to show,
I've seen enough to know
