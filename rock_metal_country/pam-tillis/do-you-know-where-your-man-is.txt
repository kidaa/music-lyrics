NIGHT IS FALLIN' ON THIS HONKY-TONK CITY
COUNTRY MUSIC SPILLIN' OUT ON THE STREET
WELL, IT SURE CAN SOUND GOOD TO A HARD-WORKIN' MAN
AT THE END OF A HARD-WORKIN' WEEK
DID YOU KISS HIM WHEN HE LEFT THIS MORNING
AND DOES HE KNOW THAT HE'S NEEDED AT HOME
WELL, IF YOU DON'T FEEL THAT OLD THRILL 
THEN SOMEBODY ELSE WILL
AND THERE'S SOME MIGHTY GOOD WOMEN ALL ALONE
IT'S TEN O'CLOCK
DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR MAN IS
AND ARE YOU SURE THAT HE'S DOIN' YOU RIGHT
ARE YOU STILL IN HIS HEART 
WHEN HE'S OUT OF YOUR SIGHT
DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR MAN IS TONIGHT
SOMETIMES LOVERS JUST GET TOO BUSY
LIVIN' THEIR LIVES DAY BY DAY
OH, BUT A GOOD LOVIN' HEART IS SO HARD TO FIND
AND SO EASY TO LET SLIP AWAY
SO IF HE'S THERE BY YOUR SIDE COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS
HOLD HIM AND SHOW HIM YOU CARE
'CAUSE TEMPTATIONS STRONG WHEN THERE'S NO LOVE AT HOME
AND THERE'S SO MUCH TEMPTATION OUT THERE
IT'S TWELVE O'CLOCK
DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR MAN IS
AND ARE YOU SURE THAT HE'S DOIN' YOU RIGHT
ARE YOU STILL IN HIS HEART 
WHEN HE'S OUT OF YOUR SIGHT
DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR MAN IS TONIGHT

DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR MAN IS TONIGHT
