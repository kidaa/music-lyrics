Babysitter said seven
She's fifteen minutes late
Jimmy's still playing in the bath
Cold macaroni on his plate
And I still haven't done my hair
I hate doin' my hair
It never comes out right
I must have changed my clothes
A half a dozen times
Ended up in this little black dress
I had to mend the hemline
And now I can't find my shoes
I can never find my shoes
God I hate this
Am I nervous?
Am I scared?
Is it worth it?
Should I even care?
What a tine to have these second thoughts
Man I like this guy
I really like him a lot
Please let him be the right one
Everything that I've been waiting for
Please let him be the right one
And all I've been praying for
Please, please let him be the right one
Let him be the dad, the friend, the man
Please let him be the right one
Let him cherish me for who I am
Please let him be the right one
Let him be the right one
Made it through dinner
Had a little too much wine
Probably talked too much
Went on and on about that little boy of mine
But he smiled, yeah he really smiled
I can't believe he smiled
Oh what a perfect night this has been
Should I say good-bye
Should I let him in
Calm down girl it's just a kiss
I know, I know, but it's been so long
Since I felt like this
Please let him be the right one
Everything that I've been waiting for
Please let him be the right one
And all I've been praying for
Please, please let him be the right one
Let him be the dad, the friend, the man
Please let him be the right one
Let him cherish me for who I am
Please let him be the right one
Let him be the right one
Please let him be the right one
Let him be the right one
Please let him be the right one
Everything that I've been waiting for
Please let him be the right one
And all I've been praying for
Let him be the right one
Let him be the right one
