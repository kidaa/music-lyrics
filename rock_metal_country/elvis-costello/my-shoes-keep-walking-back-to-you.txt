I might say that I don't care
Hold my head up in the air
Even tell my friends I'm glad that you don't call
But when the day is through
That's when my heartaches start anew
And that's when I miss you most of all
And my arms keep reaching for you
And my eyes keep searching for you
And my lips keep calling for you
And my shoes keep walking back to you
No matter how much I pretend
I wish I had you back again
'Cause nothin' means half as much as you
My world just seemed to die
The day you said goodbye
And I can't forget no matter what I do
And my arms keep reaching for you
And my eyes keep searching for you
And my lips keep calling for you
And my shoes keep walking back to you
