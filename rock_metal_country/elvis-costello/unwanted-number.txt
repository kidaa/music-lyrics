You should hear the things that they say about me 
They're saying ";She's no better than she needed to be"; 
They don't know that he was kind and strong and tender 
And now I'll never be another Unwanted Number 
Unwanted Number 
How can I tell them? 
How can I express? 
How it felt to step out of this life and into his embrace 
How can I tell them? 
How can I explain? 
All the love that I never had I found in him 
There may be a stain on the family name 
And if my father was here I think I know who he'd blame 
Mama says that he just doesn't care to remember 
And all he thinks of me is another Unwanted Number 
Unwanted Number 
How can I tell her? 
How can I express? 
How it felt when he came to my room 
And helped me to undress 
What can she tell me? 
How can I believe 
That she really didn't hear me cry 
When he wouldn't leave? 
There's a local game where they whisper my shame 
They say ";He gave her his child 
He wouldn't give her his name"; 
They will torture me from January till September 
And soon there's going to be another Unwanted Number 
Unwanted Number 
Unwanted number 
And I will give my love to another Unwanted Number 
Unwanted Number 
Unwanted Number
