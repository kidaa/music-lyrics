McCartney/MacManus 
My brave, my brave, my brave face 
I've been living in style 
Unaccustomed as I am 
To the luxury life 
I've been hitting the town 
And it didn't hit back 
I've been doing the rounds 
Unaccustomed as I am 
To the time on my hands 
Now I don't have to tell anybody 
When I'm gonna get back 
Ever since you went away I've had the sentimental inclination not to change a single thing 
As I pull the sheet back on the bed I want to go bury my head in your pillow 
Now that I'm alone again 
I can't stop breaking down again 
The simplest things set me off again 
Take me to that place 
Where I can find my brave face 
Where I can find my brave face 
My brave, my brave, my brave face 
I've been living a lie 
Unaccustomed as I am 
To the work of a housewife 
I been breaking up dirty dishes 
And been throwing them away 
Ever since you left I have been trying to compose a ";Baby, would you please come home"; note meant for you 
As I clear away another untouched TV dinner from the table I made for two 
Now that I'm alone again 
I can't stop breaking down again 
The simplest things set me off again 
Take me to that place 
Where I can find my brave face 
Where I can find my brave face 
My brave, my brave, my brave face
