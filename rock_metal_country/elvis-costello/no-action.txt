I don't wanna kiss you. I don't wanna touch.
I don't wanna see you 'cause I don't miss you that much.
I'm not a telephone junkie.
I told you that we were just good friends.
But when I hold you like I hold that bakelite in my hands,
there's no action,
there's no action,
there's no action.
Ev'ry time I phone you, I just wanna put you down.
He's got the keys to the car.
They are the keys to the kingdom.
He's got ev'rything you need.
It's a shame that he didn't bring them.
I'm not a telephone junkie.
If I'm inserting my coin I'm doing just fine.
And the things in my head start hurtin' my mind.
And I think about the way things used to be,
knowing you with him is driving me crazy.
Sometimes I phone you when I know you're not lonely,
but I always disconnect it in time.
