What is it that brings you to this part of town
Curiosity, conscience or fate
I know it's not love
Cause I once gave you love
And all you showed me was the gate
I got a feeling you've come back
To just rub it in
And to really put me in my place
You've already but big old tears in my eyes
Must you throw dirt in my face
Must you keep telling me that you've got a new love
I don't need you to remind me
Must you keep telling me how I look so lonely
And my better days are behind me
Must you keep showing me pictures of him
Boasting of his warm embrace
You've already put big old tears in my eyes
Must you throw dirt in my face
You've already left me
And broken my heart
Told me how much you don't want me
Believe me I'm happier when we're apart
Why must you come back now to haunt me
Must you keep showing me pictures of him
Boasting of his warm embrace
You've already put big old tears in my eyes
Must you throw dirt in my face
You've already put big old tears in my eyes
Must you throw dirt in my face
Must you throw dirt in my face
