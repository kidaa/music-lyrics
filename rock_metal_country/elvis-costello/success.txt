We used to go out walkin' hand in hand
You told me all the big things you had planned
It wasn't long till all your dreams came true
Success put me in second place with you
You have no time to love me anymore
Since fame & fortune knocked upon our door
I spend all my evenings all alone
Success has made a failure of our home
If we could spend an evening now & then
Perhaps we'd find true happiness again
You never hold me like you used to do
It's funny what success has done for you
You have no time to love me anymore
Since fame & fortune knocked upon our door
I spend all my evenings all alone
Success has made a failure of our home
