Do.
Do do do do do.
So young, we've discovered. Got them so confused.
Don't mind putting the time in. It's shocking.
That's what they all say now when we're walking hand in hand
As one, you and I.
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, you said it's timed out
We've got them hangin' on a string.
There's no time for compromises; we got that good old thing.
So young, so young. x4
It's wrong to run for cover. We've got them in a spin.
You don't mind sticking the sticker in. It's too late.
That's what they all say now when we're walking hand in hand
As one, you and I.
Chorus.
Do do do do do. Do do do.
Chorus, again.
So young, so young.
