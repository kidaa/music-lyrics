I know a girl got my mind in a mess
I never heard her say goodnight and God bless
She's not the only flame in town
And when we're alone we never quarrel
I'm miles away now here's the moral
She's not the only flame in town
She's not the only flame in town
She's got to stop thinking that I'm
carrying this torch around
He struck a match and it lit up her face
We should have struck a match girl
To burn down the whole place
Now you're not the only flame in town
But you blew hot and cold
Turned my heart to a cinder
And with each passing day
You'd be less tender and more tinder
Now you're not the only flame in town
She's not the only flame in town
She's got to stop thinking that I'm
carrying this torch around
Thought I saw your face in the fire
But it's so hard to remember
Even an inferno can cool down to an ember
Now you're not the only flame
You're not the only flame
You're not the only flame in town
