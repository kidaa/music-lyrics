If today the sun should set on all my hopes and cares
There is one who's smiling face the gods would see
For she'll walk along beside me up the golden stairs
Oh, they'll never, never take her love from me
What a fool I was to go and break the trust she gave
And see her love turn into sympathy
It's the one regret I carry with me to my grave
Oh, they'll never, never take her love from me
I'm so thankful for each golden hour of happiness
That we shared together in the used to be
Someone else's arms may hold her now in fond caress
But, they'll never, never take her love from me
I thought I would make her happy if I stepped aside
But I knew her love would never set me free
And even on the morning she became another's bride
I said, ";They'll never, never take her love from me.";
