If there's anything that you want
If there's anything that you need
There's no need to be evasive
Money talks and it's persuasive
Possession
Now you're sending me your best wishes
Signed with love and vicious kisses
You lack lust, you're so lacklustre
Is that all the strength you can muster
Possession
Even when we are out of touch
Now I know that I've seen too much
Seen too much
So I see us lying back to back
My case is closed my case is packed
I'll get out before the violence
Or the tears or the silence
Possession
