I expect you're entitled to know why I'm making contact
With acquaintances scattered all over the land
I'd promise you now and again that I'd honour the contract
If it hadn't crumbled away in my hand
So we broke that vow independently now
But I don't know why you absolutely deny
You bowed down you bowed down, you bowed down
You bowed down you bowed down, you bowed down
When you first looked away I might say it was really a kindness
It must have hurt you to see how dreams sour
Now they say that justice and love are the next things to blindness
Well you're getting plenty of both of them now
And so you parade where appointments are made
And never meant to be kept
Unless you accept
You bowed down you bowed down, you bowed down
You bowed down you bowed down, you bowed down
You value the burnt amber of falling leaves
And you long to delay
As you feel their breath as they whisper
";It won't hurt you now to betray
If you just bow down";
And now every time that we meet on the edge of hysteria
You're helping them sell off some new party line
I remember a time when you would have seemed so superior
Now you say ";Will you please meet this good friend of mine?";
So you're in demand as long as you kiss their hand
But all the applause is for their name not yours
You bowed down you bowed down, you bowed down
You bowed down you bowed down, you bowed down
You bowed down you bowed down, you bowed down
You bowed down you bowed down, you bowed down
You bowed down
You bowed down
You bowed down
You bowed down
