This must be the place
Second place in the human race
Down in the basement
Now I know what he meant
Secondary modern
But there must be a problem till the girls go home
This is the hand that you never shook
You never gave me the chance that I took
Secondary modern
But there won't be a problem till the girls go home
Is it out of the question
Between you and me
Is it pleasure or business
Or a packet of three?
Nobody makes me sad like you
Now my whole world goes from blue to blue
Secondary modern
But there won't be a problem till the girls go home...
