Shadow and Jimmy were always yesterday's news 
Jimmy's a bowler, Shadow rents out his green bowling shoes 
Late Friday night when the bars are all shuttered and dark 
He shadows back Jimmy to the lot in the lost trailer park 
For shadow and Jimmy all the weekends end up the same 
If it's Saturday night, then it must be the hockey game 
After cold beer and barbecued ribs the night is complete 
With wrestling stories and elegant bones 
That are tired of walking and on their way home 
Chorus 
And they talk about the women 
And they look at the girls 
They'll never know the ways of the world 
They've got a mouthful of much obliged 
And a handful of gimme 
And the love for each other 
Of Shadow and Jimmy 
For Shadow and Jimmy now the story is told 
There's nothing to hold on to and no one to hold 
Men without women are like fish without 
water to swim in 
With their eyes bugging out 
They flop on the beach 
And look up at the girls 
Who are just out of reach
