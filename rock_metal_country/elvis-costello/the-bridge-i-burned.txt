I'm walking down Times Square in the Electric Daylight
The sailors on shore leave stand out in their perfect white.
I'm up here with my spying glass at the window of the world 
For better or for worse - it's a perverse universe, my love.
Now I know, I should have never walked over the bridge I burned
Now I know, somehow I don't feel so alone.
[the sermon]
You mutter underneath your breath - IT ECHOES ROUND THE WORLD
Everybody comes from nowhere.
There is hope, it loops up in the air
Now I know, I should have never walked over the bridge I burned
Now I know, somehow I don't feel so alone.
You said I used to be handsome if you screwed up your eyes
Professors and vampires drank up all the tears I cried.
Now there's a bird at my window, he feeds upon the pain
and sometimes he sings to me - a mocking bird in the twilight of infamy.
Now I know, I should have never walked over the bridge I burned
Now I know, somehow I don't feel so alone.
Now I know, I should have never walked over the bridge I burned
Now I know, they've burned one sinner and the others are set to follow
Now I know.
Now I know.
Now I know.
