It's hurting me
It's hurting me
This doubt is hurting me
So remove this doubt
From my heart little girl
And let me live my life
Knowing you care
Remove this doubt
From my mind little girl
And let me breathe again
Feeling my love is shared
Each time we meet
You make me feel so incomplete
There's no joy in the air
I just don't think you care
Close the door
On doubt forever
And may it nevermore
Make me unsure
Turn the key
And lock away this doubt in me
Keep it in the dark
Not in my heart
Be more tender
Completely surrender
Your love to me
Is sweet and not discrete
Remove this doubt
From my heart little girl
And let me live my life
Knowing you care
Remove this doubt
From my mind little girl
And let me breathe again
Knowing my love is shared
Each time we meet
You make me feel so incomplete
There's no joy in the air
I just don't think you care
Remove this doubt from my heart 6X
