What's her name today? 
What's her name today? 
She could be anyone 
I might have known you'd leave her crying 
What's her name again? 
You should be ashamed 
How could you treat her so unspeakably? 
Or did you think she was a different girl? 
For as the radio played in the bedroom wall 
What was that name you called her? 
Was she the one who took away your pride 
And your reason? 
Oh, why did you decide that 
You'd punish any girl you meet 
To try and make that feeling go away? 
What's her name today? 
What's her name today? 
Is her hair hanging down? 
Or maybe it's fixed with a ribbon 
Are her eyes still blue? 
Should she trust in you? 
Because it's a lonely world 
She wants to believe for a while in all the things you say 
But as the radio played in the bedroom wall 
What was that name you called her? 
Isn't her smile reminiscent of someone else? 
Well, is it or isn't it? 
Oh, why did you decide that 
You'd punish any girl you meet 
To try and make that feeling go away? 
What's her name today? 
Is she going to stay 
So you can ruin her? 
And soon she'll be twisted in chiffon 
Dress her like a doll 
String her like a pearl 
She hears peals of bells, but it's hard to tell 
Now that she's hung up like a chandelier 
What's her name? 
What's her name? 
What's her name today?
