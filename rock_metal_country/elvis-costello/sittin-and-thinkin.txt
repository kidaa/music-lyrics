I got loaded last night on a bottle of gin
And I had a fight with my best girlfriend
When I'm drinkin' I am nobody's friend
So please baby wait for me until they let me out again
I know the same thing has happened before
And each time it happens, I hate it more & more
When I'm drinkin' I am nobody's friend
So please baby wait for me until they let me out again
I spent a whole lotta time sittin' & thinkin'
Sittin' & just thinkin' 'bout you
If I didn't spend so much time sittin' & drinkin'
We'd still have the love I thought we knew
I won't promise the same thing won't happen again
But I can promise, it'll be a long, long time till then
'Cause when I'm drinkin' I am nobody's friend
So please baby wait for me until they let me out again
