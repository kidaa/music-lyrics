Up above me are the skies
Like the twinkle in your eyes
Blue must be the colour of the blues
In the mail, the letters came
But you can't pay for love the same
Blue must be the colour of the blues
The bluebird singin' in the trees
Seems to sympathize with me
'Cause he's not singin' like he used to do
Pretty waters in the sea
Feel as cold as you left me
Blue must be the colour of the blues
Blue days come and blue days go
The way I feel, nobody knows
Life is finally empty without you
There's a blue note in each song
That I sing since you've been gone
Blue must be the colour of the blues
