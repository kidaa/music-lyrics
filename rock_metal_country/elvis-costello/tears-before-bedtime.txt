I know the name on the tip of your tongue 
And I know that accusing look
Everybody knows I've been so wrong
That's the problem and here's the hook
Tears before bedtime 
There'll be trouble tonight
I don't want to talk about it anymore 
I don't want to have another fight
I don't want to talk I don't want to fight 
How wrong can I be before I am right 
For the tears that you boo hoo hoo hoo 
There can be no defence
You say you'll forgive and forget
But it's only a pretence
Either you can leave the past behind
Or give me something to disconnect my mind
I sleep with my fists clenched tight 
When I don't lie awake all night
I guess time gave up the ghost too late
And the balance of our love
Very soon turns to hate
Darling your suspiciousness
Tortures me at night
But I can't excuse the cruel words
That I use whenever we fight
