Trying to be too bad
Trying to talk too tough
Trying to jack the lad
You'd think he'd had enough
But he's not the man you'd think that he can be
I just don't know why you can't see
That he is only the imposter
That he is only the imposter
You've never been this far
You've always been too smart
And you know all our boys
Are really girls at heart
But he's not...
When I said that I was lying I might have been lying
Never let me hear you say you're not trying
This is your big decision
Hope you're not disappointed
He's got double vision
When you want him double jointed
And he's not...
He'll only bring you souvenirs
It's only gonna end in tears
And he is only the imposter
