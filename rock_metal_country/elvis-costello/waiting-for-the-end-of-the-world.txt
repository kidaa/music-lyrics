The man from the television crawled into the train.
I wonder who he's gonna stick it in this time.
Everyone was looking for a little entertainment,
so they'll probably pull his hands off
when they find out his name.

Nobody was saying anything at all.
We were waiting for the end of the world,
waiting for the end of the world,
waiting for the end of the world.
Dear Lord I sincerely hope you're coming
'cause you really started something.

waiting for the end of the world,
waiting for the end of the world.

'cause you really started something.

You may see them drowning as you stroll along the beach,
but don't throw out the lifeline till they're clean out of reach.
