Don't say you love me when it's just a rumour
Don't say a word if there is any doubt.
Sometimes I think that love is just a tumour;
you've got to cut it out.
You say you're sorry for the things that you've done.
You say you're sorry but you know you don't mean it.
I wouldn't worry. I had so much fun.
Sometimes I almost feel just like a human being
It's you
not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue
It's you
not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue
oh yeah.
Get to the slot machine almost dead on arrival
Just hit me one more time with that live wire
Maybe they told you you were only a girl in a million
You say I've got not feelings;
this is a good way to kill them.
Select the control and then insert the token
You wanna throw me away but I'm not broken.
You've got a lot to say. Well I'm not joking.
There are some words they don't allow to be spoken.
Sometimes I almost feel just like a human being
It's you
not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue
