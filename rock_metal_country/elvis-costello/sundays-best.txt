Sunday's Best
Times are tough for English babies 
Send the army and the navy 
Beat up strangers who talk funny 
Take their greasy foreign money 
Skin shop, red leather, hot line 
Be prepared for the engaged sign 
Bridal books, engagement rings 
And other wicked little things 
Chorus: 
Standing in your socks and vest 
Better get it off your chest 
Every day is just like the rest 
But Sunday's best 
Stylish slacks to suit your pocket 
Back supports and picture lockets 
Sleepy towns and sleeper trains 
To the dogs and down the drains 
Major roads and ladies smalls 
Hearts of oak and long trunk calls 
Continental interference 
At death's door with life insurance 
Chorus 
Sunday's best, Sunday's finest 
When your money's in the minus 
And you suffer from your shyness 
You can listen to us whiners 
Don't look now under the bed 
An arm, a leg and a severed head 
Read about the private lives 
The songs of praise, the readers' wives 
Listen to the decent people 
Though you treat them just like sheep 
Put them all in boots and khaki 
Blame it all upon the darkies 
Chorus 
Sunday's best
