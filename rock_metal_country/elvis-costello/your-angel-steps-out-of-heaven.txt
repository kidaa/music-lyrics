You tell me you married an angel
She's made heaven out of your home
You say there couldn't be rainbows in heaven
'Cause she's brought you happiness that you've never known
You may hate me for what I've to tell you
But you'll thank me for setting you right
While you work to keep angels in heaven
Your angel steps out of heaven each night
Her heaven's not the same as you're living in
It's any place where there's music and a free drink from him
So call her your angel, I won't say you're not right
But your angel steps out of heaven each night
