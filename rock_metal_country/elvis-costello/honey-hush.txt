Come into this house and stop that yakity yak
'Cause your sugar-daddy don't want no talkin' back
You keep on babblin', talkin' 'bout this and that
I got news for ya baby, you ain't nothin' but an alley cat
Turn off the waterworks baby, they don't move me no more
I'm leavin' this town, ain't comin' back no more
Honey hush
Come into this house and stop that yakity yak
You're makin' me nervous and I'm holdin' a baseball bat
Hi-ho, hi-ho silver
Hi-ho, hi-ho silver away
