You say that you can and then you run to get your mummy
And you're almost beaten to the punch
Looking for the man who sold you the dummy
And you're almost beaten to the punch
Laughing at the older guys who say it's just as well
Saved by the wedding bell
Almost beaten to the punch
You're looking for somebody new that you can knock around
You are almost beaten to the punch
If you've got a head for figures then you'd better count me out
You were almost beaten to the punch
You pulled the piece but you soon called it love
You go hand in glove
Almost beaten to the punch
Your body speaks much louder than your voice
You let it do the talking so I don't have any choice
Now you find the younger guys are putting up resistance
And you're almost beaten to the punch
You better get out now because you'll never go the distance
And you're almost beaten to the punch
You'll find a girl and you'll promise her anything
Even a wedding ring
Almost beaten to the punch
