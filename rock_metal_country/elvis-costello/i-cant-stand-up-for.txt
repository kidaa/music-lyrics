I'm the living result
I'm a man who's been hurt a little too much
and I've tasted the bitterness of my own tears
sadness is all my lonely heart can feel
I can't stand up for falling down
I can't stand up for falling down
simple though love is
still it confused me
why I'm not loved the way I should be
now I've lived with heartaches
and I've roomed with fear
I've dealt with despair
and I've wrestled with tears
I can't stand up for falling down
I can't stand up for falling down
the vow that we made
you broke it in two
but that don't stop me from loving you
I can't stand up for falling down
I can't stand up for falling down
