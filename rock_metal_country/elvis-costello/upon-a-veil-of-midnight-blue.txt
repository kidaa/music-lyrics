Upon a veil of midnight blue 
There hung a crescent moon 
To light the view 
But I don't whisper the words 
When the moment arose 
I wonder how he knows 
You say your tongue is tied 
Your words escape and hide 
But he's so patient and kind 
He's prepared to read your mind 
That's very well till you find 
Because of the wine you drank 
Your mind is still a blank 
I wonder how he knows 
I guess I will wonder until 
I pluck up the courage to tell him 
How I feel 
So close I can feel his heart tremble 
That look in his eyes as they close 
I wonder how he knows 
I wonder how he knows
