My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable, unphotographable
But you're my favourite work of art
Is your figure less than Greek ?
Is your mouth a little weak ?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart ?
Don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's day
