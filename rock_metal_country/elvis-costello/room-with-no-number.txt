Picture a hotel room
Clothes scattered across the floor
Covers pulled back from the pillow
A sign hung on the door
Two lovers locked up tight
Through the endless days and nights
Hiding something they can't show
Something no-one must know
Chorus
There's a room without a number
While the sign outside says there's
no vacancy as you take your key
They smile at you so understandingly
She cried out in the night
Woke the porter from his sleep
He grinned slyly to himself
As he went to fetch his keys
Look what love has brought them to
This terrible nightmare
His or hers he could not tell
As they were sleeping there
Chorus
And I wish he could be
The man he was before he was me
A girl arrived at first light
And enquired if they'd been seen
And why the numbers ran from twelve
Missing out thirteen
And they said oh my darling
Put it down to superstition
Try to avoid a scandal
And don't arouse suspicion
They re-arranged the furniture
They even papered over the door
There's a room without a number
While the sign outside says there's
no vacancy as you take your key
They smile just so so you know
Chorus
