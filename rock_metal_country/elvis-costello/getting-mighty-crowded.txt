I'm packing up my memories
And I'm gonna move all out of your heart
I'm turning in my keys
And I'm gonna move all out of your heart
'Cause there ain't room enough for two
In dreams that were made for me and you
I'm telling you, it's getting mighty crowded
Too crowded for me
It's getting mighty crowded
I'm gonna take these things of mine
And I'm gonna move all out of your life
Stop wasting my time
And I'm gonna move all out of your life
'Cause there ain't room enough for three
In dreams that were made for you and me
So you see, it's getting mighty crowded
Too crowded for me
It's getting mighty crowded
I'm saving you the trouble of putting me down
Starting on the double, yeah yeah
I'm gonna shop around
I'm gonna find another heart
Where I can live all by myself
Gonna find another heart
I don't have to share with anybody else
'Cause you don't treat me like you should
And hanging around this neighborhood is no good
It's getting mighty crowded
Too crowded for me, getting mighty crowded
I'm packing up my memories, getting mighty crowded
Too crowded for me, getting mighty crowded
Too crowded for me, getting mighty crowded
