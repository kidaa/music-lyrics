She says, nobody wants to believe 
You're the same as 
everyone
What makes makes me 
unique
My Dark Life
There was a kink in the 
world
Sent that statue 
tumbling
An invitation east
So we can watch it all 
crumbling
she came on like a light
and so softly she spoke
you don't know
you don't know about
My dark life
And you think you're a 
guest
You're a tourist at best
Peering into the 
corners of
My dark life
Now that you, You tear 
your dreams
From consumptive 
ballerinas
She'll stand on tiptoe 
for you
In a grey and tattered 
tutu
She stay's where 
she is
cause of voyeurs like 
these
with an accusative look 
that says
My Dark Life
Rubber men await you 
there
In each beguiling alley
To shake you and to 
pierce you and remind you of 
My dark Life
Enter the pious elite
In their preening finery
And bang the tambourine
They're dining on rice 
paper scenery
See how the villain 
attracts
Envious glances from 
everyone
She's waitressing by day
It doesn't bring in 
much money now
And as strong concealed 
arms
Set off bells and alarms
In the strangest 
locations of
My Dark Life
But the fantasies 
slipped 
as he tipped her in 
cigarettes
She tries to smile very
graciously
When she wants to kill 
him
Now the victory is sweet
You get down upon your 
knees
It's the perfect 
position
for kissing west on 
leather
So they came from Ugly, 
Texas
and from Nameless, 
Tennesee
from Peculiar, Missouri
and from places closer 
to me
All the cream of 
heartless england
cheer the carnival is 
over
and members of army 
bandsmen
played America the 
Beautiful
