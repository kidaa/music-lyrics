Bama Lama Bama Loo
Gotta girl named Lucinda
They call her the great pretender

They call her the great pretender
And when she talks

Bama Lama Bama Loo
Bama Lama Bama Loo
Bama Lama Bama Loo

Well I dig her style
She's bout to drive me wild
With Bama Lama Bama Loo
Well I asked my little baby for a kiss
She shook her head around like this
Well I asked my little girl for a kiss
She shook her head around like this
She said ....
