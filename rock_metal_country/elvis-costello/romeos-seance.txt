Is anyone there I can talk to?
Give us a sign if you're with me
CAN'T you see that I'm dying to hear you
EVERYONE ELSE HAS LOST INTEREST
AND I'M ALL ALONE IN THIS DREAM HOUSE
Though you're gone
I don't feel like crying
Romeo is calling you
Knock once or twice if you're out there
Send me a message my sweetheart
When I'm out and about I'll be coming to see you
IT ISN'T EASY TO LIVE WITH THIS MATRONLY FACE
AT THE WINDOW
Try to contact me, if you can see how I'm suffering
Romeo is calling you
Scatter the paper and thimbles
You can take care of the candles
An unplugged radio plays. She is close NOW
Me and my hand-holding baby walking the floor and the
ceiling
THIS IS the song SHE dictated this evening.
Romeo is calling you
ROMEO IS CALLING YOU
