You need protection from the physical art of conversation
Though the fist is mightier than the lip, it adds the aggravation
Bridge and Chorus:
I got the password
I got persuasion
A proposition for invasion of your privacy
Give yourself away and find the fake in me
You'll never be a man
No matter how many foreign bodies you can take
You'll never be a man
When you're half a woman and you're half awake
1 With a face full of tears and a chemical shake
2 Under the table with a chemical shake
Given half a chance, that I can take
Are you so superior, are you in such pain
Are you made out of porcelain?
When they made you they broke the cast
Don't wanna be first, I just want to last
You strike a profile on the low side of my imagination
My eyes climbed down to find the point of possible saturation
Bridge and Chorus
