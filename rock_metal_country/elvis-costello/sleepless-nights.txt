Through the sleepless nights
I cry for you
And wonder who 
Is kissing you
Oh, these sleepless nights
Will brake my heart in two
Somehow, through the day
I don't give in
I hide the tears 
That wait within
Oh, these sleepless nights
Will break my heart again
Why did you go?
Oh, why did you go?
Don't you know, don't you know
I need you?
Through the sleepless nights
I cry for you
And wonder who 
Is kissing you
Oh, these sleepless nights
Will break my heart in two
Oh, oh, oh, oh, these sleepless nights
Will break my heart in two
Oh, oh, oh, oh, these sleepless nights
Will break my heart in two
