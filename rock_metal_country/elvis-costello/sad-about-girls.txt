To all the girls that awake to escape in the morning
You want to leave him without even a warning, a trace, or a calling card
Sad about girls who know perfectly well why he's so sad about this girl
He's so mad about this girl tonight
So understanding--oh, she's so undemanding
So in control, so on the whole--she's so good to you until it gets to you
Sad about girls in your polythene world
Where you unwrap and rewrap and know when she leaves
That the next girl to suffer, putting you [posed?]
Unwrap and love you before she can know you
She's just got to show you the way that you're gonna be sad
Sad about girls that awake to escape in the morning
Get up and leave without even a warning
But no where is sad as the girls in the night
So ready to please you, so ready to bite
Sad about girls who know perfectly well he's so sad about this girl
You're so sad about your girl tonight
Sad about girls tonight
So sad about girls tonight
