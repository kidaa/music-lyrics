Moods for moderns x4
I get hit looking for a miss
I never thought that it would come to this
Moods for moderns x4
Though we may never be the same again
I am so proud that you've been taken in vain
What if none of your dreams come true?
I can never run from you
There's never been a how d'you do
There's never been an ending
Soon you'll belong to someone else
And I will be your stranger just pretending
Moods for moderns
Memory lingers
I let you into
Foreign fingers
Moods for moderns x4
I never thought that would see the day
I never thought that I would give you away
Chorus
Moods for moderns
Let them break us
Strong and sudden
Foreign fingers
