Don't wait for the telephone if you want a call from me
There won't be anymore, there won't be anymore
And don't wait for the mailman if you want a letter from me
There won't be anymore, there won't be anymore
All the love we had until you turn back
And it broke my lovin' heart in two
When you're heart is breakin' and you want some lovin' from me
There won't be anymore, it won't be like before
It won't be like before, there just won't be anymore
All the love we had until you turn back
And it broke my lovin' heart in two
When you're heart is breakin' and you want some lovin' from me
There won't be anymore, it won't be like before
It won't be like before, there just won't be anymore
