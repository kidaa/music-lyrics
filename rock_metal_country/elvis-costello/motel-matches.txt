Somewhere in the distance I can hear ";Who Shot Sam?";
This is my conviction, that I am an innocent man
Though you say I'm unkind
I'm being as nice as I can
Boys everywhere, fumbling with the catches
I struck lucky with motel matches
Falling for you without a second look
Falling out of your open pocketbook
Giving you away like motel matches
I wake with the siren in an emergency
Though your mind is full of love
In your eyes there is a vacancy
And you know what I'll do
When the light outside changes from red to blue
Chorus
