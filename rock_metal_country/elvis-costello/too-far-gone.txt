I can tell somewhere there's someone you love more than me
Someone you love more than me
And it hurts to say it that you have a right to be free
I know that's the way it should be
Oh but I'm too far gone
Too far gone
I know I've loved you too much for too long
And I'm too far gone
If ever your new love should hurt you or make you feel blue
Hurt you or make you feel blue
Just remember your old love will still be around loving you
I'll be around loving you
Oh 'cause I'm too far gone
Too far gone
I know I've loved you too much for too long
And I'm too far gone
