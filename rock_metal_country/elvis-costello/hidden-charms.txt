Her lips are sweet
Her legs are big
Her looks can make you
Dance the jig
Her touch is so soft
Her heart is so warm
What knocks me out
Is your hidden charms
Her voice is so soft
Her love is so true
I think about her
That's all I do
She's weak and wanton
In my arms
What moves me darling
Is your hidden charms
When I hold you
In my arms
Brings out all of your
Hidden Charms
Her kiss is so pure
As the morning dew
A real gone love
Is exciting too
Her eyes that talk
They say ";c'mon";
What kills me baby
Is your hidden charms
When I hold you
In my arms
Brings out all of your
Hidden Charms
