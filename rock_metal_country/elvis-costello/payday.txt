Let's go out on the town tonight
My pockets are heavy with loot
And get drunk and blasted
And loud in your dress of blue
I've been living from hand to mouth
It must be three or four weeks
And I can tell you one thing Jack
You listen when your stomach speaks
I feel good just like I knew that I would
And all on account of that wine that I bought today
I'm smiling so sweet
At every little girl that I meet
Some fools will try to tell you it's a sin to feel this way
It feels so funny having all of this money
I think I feel like dancing the night away
I think I feel like dancing the night away
I got me this long legged girl
To help me to spend my dough
Her heart as big as your mama's stove
And her body like Brigitte Bardot
I'm all ready for some Rock and Roll
With the guitar turned up loud
And the fancy footwork
And the drunk down, druged up crowd
I feel good just like I knew that I would
All on account of that wine that I bought today
I'm smiling so sweet
At every little girl that I meet
Some fools will try to tell you it's a sin to feel this way
It feels so funny having all of this money
I think I feel like dancing the night away
I think I feel like dancing the night away
