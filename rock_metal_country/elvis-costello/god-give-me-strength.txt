Words sung by the character in the movie given in brackets 
Now I have nothing, so God give me strength 
'Cause I'm weak in her [his] wake 
And if I'm strong I might still break 
And I don't have anything to share 
That I won't throw away into the air 
That song is sung out 
This bell is rung out [This belle is wrung out] 
[He] She was the light that I'd bless 
[He] She took my last chance at happiness 
So God give me strength, God give me strength 
I can't hold onto [him] her, God give me strength 
When the phone doesn't ring 
And I'm lost in imagining 
Everything that kind of love is worth 
As I tumble back down to the earth 
That song is sung out 
This bell is rung out 
[He] She was the light that I'd bless 
[He] She took my last chance at happiness 
So God give me strength, 
God if [he'd] she'd grant me [his] her indulgence and decline 
I might as well wipe [him] her from my memory 
Fracture the spell as [he] she becomes my enemy 
Maybe I was washed out like a lip-print on his shirt 
See, I'm only human, I want him to hurt 
I want him 
I want him to hurt 
[instrumental] 
Since I lost the power to pretend 
That there could ever be a happy ending 
That song is sung out 
This bell is rung out 
[He] She was the light that I'd bless 
[He] She took my last chance at happiness 
So God give me strength, God give me strength
