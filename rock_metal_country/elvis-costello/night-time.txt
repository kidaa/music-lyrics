Wait until the light goes out,
I don't want to be seen about,
maybe we could find a place to go.
Find a crowded place where they don't care about your face,
or if your name is even Santa Claus or Joe.
I'll be right at home if they leave me alone.
That's why I only operate at night time.
Wait until the clock strikes ten,
it'll all start happening then.
Baby, just you wait and see.
We can have a little party, laugh and sing and everything,
I know you'll like it, just you wait and see.
Maybe first we'll dig a movie,
then we'll hit they high spots feelin' groovy.
That's why I only operate at night time.
The right time is the night time.
I wait `til it's late and I can concentrate,
making love by the light of the moon.
So when it's way past nine, get ready for a swinging time,
`cause I don't know where to draw the line.
We can have a little party, laugh and sing and everything,
I know you'll like it just you wait and see.
Maybe first we'll dig a movie,
then we'll hit the high spots feelin' groovy.
That's why I only operate at night time.
Night time.
