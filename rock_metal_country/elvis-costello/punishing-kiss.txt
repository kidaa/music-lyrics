Words MacManus/O'Riordan, music: Costello 
I favour a good punishing kiss 
it helps pass the lonely afternoon 
another stiff drink, wipe off that lipstick 
For when you reach a certain age 
All the most villainous men can be found on Channel Ten 
I make them dance in attendance 
'We will be back in a minute or two' 
And he will punish that girl 
Oh forget the reason 
Just look at me I'm lost in a social whirl 
She was never so witty 
Always struggling to be full of fun 
'On weekdays 
From mid-day to one' 
In a little black cocktail dress everyone hates 
She'll be saving the world inbetween fashion plates 
I know what she gets up to in the back of that blacked out limousine 
And I catch myself shouting at the screen 
I think that it's time to turn over 
They say it's harmless I know 
A hundred and ten percent certain 
Virtually real 
If you need something to feel 
Then favour a punishing kiss 
It helps chase the wasted afternoons 
The flowers and pearls 
The long lost relations 
That love sick tom-boy comes in bloom 
The pointless heartache 
That seems to belong in my blue room 
Can't stand the suspense 
The endless embraces 
Each episode lends the silly pretence 
Say I can look away when I will never miss it 
Starts with a joke 
And ends with a punishing kiss
