I fear, my dear
We've forgotten the things strangers do
If we could look back
To the terrible thrill that we knew
Am I imagining a world without you?
Must we be shamed into love?
What can I say?
Will you pardon my stupid embrace?
Sometimes I'm desperate
While you're wiping the smile from your face
Am I surrendering, or am I replaced?
Must we be shamed into love?
Shamed into love
You're once a fool for having it
Twice for letting it go
Somewhere, my love, there's a feeling deep inside of me
That I can't let go
Oh, you'll never know
But then, my darling
I've forbidden myself to confess
I've looked around now
But I always return to your face
In a world where everything
I once cursed, I bless
It must be you who shamed me into love
Must we be shamed into love?
