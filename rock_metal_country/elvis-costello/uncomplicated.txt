Blood and Chocolate
I hope you're satisfied what you have done
You think it's over now
But we've only just begun
I asked for water
And they gave me rose' wine
A horse that knows arithmetic
And a dog that tells your fortune
Chorus: It's in your eyes
Uncomplicated
I want to buy you
A big blue Diamel
Cheap white plastic shoes
That don't walk out and don't let in
I want to show you
How I love you
When you're over me
There's no-one above you
Chorus
You think it's over now
But this is only the beginning
Chorus
