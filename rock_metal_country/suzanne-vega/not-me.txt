I said, I am a little girl 
He said, you never were 
I said, I am not ready 
He said, then tell me when you are 
I said, I am too young for this 
He said, you are not really 
I said, I think I am afraid 
He said, you're being silly 

Not me 
Not me 

I said, I do not understand 
He said, you are pretending 
That would seem to contradict 
The message you are sending 
I said, you must be lonely 
He said, I would not worry 
I said, I think I'm dreaming 
Or I'm growing in a hurry 

This is not me 
Not me 

He took somebody by the hair 
And dragged her down the hall 
He took her to the bathroom 
Where they could not hear the call 
He took her to a little room 
She could not find the key 
But I don't know who it was because 
I know it was 

Not me 
Not me 

And when will you stop running 
From a human situation? 
He said, do you think your silences 
Are helping this relation? 
Do you think your solitude 
Will teach you to be free? 
I said, I don't know who you're talking to 
I know it is not me 

Not me 
Not me
