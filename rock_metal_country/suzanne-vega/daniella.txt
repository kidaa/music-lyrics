Daniella, she sits by the tree in the playground 
sometimes we go there and the children all play 
But no one can tell me just where is Daniella 
when she looks in the distance that way 

Daniella, your hair is growing wild like a jungle 
like a garden of ivy that's been blown by the wind 
In the morning we brush it and tie it with a ribbon 
and in the evening it has flown loose again 

In the afternoon when the day seems forever 
and the night feels like never then she will sigh 
But no one can tell me just where is Daniella 
when her thoughts wander off to the sky 

Ilana's her friend, she runs fast like a squirrel 
she has big brown eyes and sometimes she cries 
But she stops very soon and they both play together 
making castles and strawberry pies 

And sometimes Daniella believes she's a sparrow 
she sits by the window and eats sunflower seeds 
She watches the rain and the birds on the rooftops 
often I wonder just what she sees 

In the afternoon when the day seems forever 
and the night feels like never then she will sigh 
Oh no one can tell me just where is Daniella 
when her thoughts wander off to the sky
