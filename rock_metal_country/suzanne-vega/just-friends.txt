We're friends, that's all we are 
and that's all we will become 
It's understood 
we're only friends 
And it's better that way 
for everyone concerned 
So if you brush against me 
when we're walking side by side 
I won't wonder what you're thinking 
'cause we've got nothing to hide 
And I know you didn't mean it that way 
'cause we're just friends 

We're friends, that's all we are 
and that's all we'll ever be 
Is friends 
And we can split the cheque 
But we'll never bring the conversation 
around to you and me 
If I see your hand upon me 
it's no reason for alarm 
I realize you must have seen 
something walking down my arm 
And I know you didn't mean it that way 
'cause we're just friends 

Oh I know, and you know 
that this is really the way 
that it ought to be 
'Cause if it was another way 
we'd have a lot of trouble 
and we'd end up in confusion 
and we'd lose a lot of sleep 
We both know better than to slip and go 
and get ourselves all tangled up again 
If we want to keep our peace of mind 
we've got to keep a little distance 
and just be friends 

Oh yeah, uh huh, oh 

So I'll try to understand 
when I feel your arm around my back 
That you really meant to do something else 
but somehow you've gotten off the track 
'Cause I know you didn't mean it that way 
'cause we're just friends 

I know you didn't mean it that way 
oh I know, you didn't mean it that way 
yes I know, you didn't mean it that way 
'cause we're just friends
