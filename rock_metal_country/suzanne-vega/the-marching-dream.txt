I have dreamed that many men 
Have marched across this field 
I have wished that I could take each man 
And hold him against the flame in my heart 

I had a dream that my face was old 
And all the children came to see 
First they laughed and then they ran 
And I slammed the door behind them 

And as the tears began to rise 
You climbed the stairs 
You came into my room 
Where I was waiting there 

Now I have dreamed of all men's arms 
But this time it was you 
I drew the curtains and it was dim 
And it was strange and it was new 

I have wished that I could hear 
Each secret told 
By lovers in the battle 
With each shade of red and gold 

I have wished that I could take each man 
And hold him to the flame 
And read the secret writing there 
And know each one by name 

I have dreamed that many men 
Have marched across this field 
I have wished that I could pour 
My life into each one
