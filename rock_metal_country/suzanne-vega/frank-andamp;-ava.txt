On the way to the bidet
Is when the trouble used to start
It didn't mean she wasn't queen
Of the tinderbox that was his heart

Her fire his desire meant that
Everything must come undone
And so now we know it's not enough to be in love

He's so true. she is too. she says
I love you Frank and then they drank
All night. what a fight.
He says it isn't me you're thinking of

She's cool. it makes him cruel
And they needle till the jewels
Go raining down upon the ground
She says its not enough to be in love

Not enough to be in love
Not enough to be in love

They woke up, and they broke up.
They were volatile, and all the while
Life passed, it went so fast,
And yet they never could forget,

Their chemistry, like you and me
Proved to keep them both apart for life
And so, now we know
That it's not enough to be in love

Not enough to be in love
To be in love
To be in love
To be in love
