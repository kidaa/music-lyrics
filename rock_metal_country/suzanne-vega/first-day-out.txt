Here I am at last, I've just jumped off the train 
I'm about to start my life as a wanderer in the rain 
I know so many people would give anything to be in my shoes 
Well, that's all right for them to say, but my shoes are soaked right through. 

I don't know what made me want to come all the way out here 
I guess when I was dreaming, my skies were always clear 
Now I'm here in a meadow with the rain streaming through my hair 
I guess this is what you call traveling freely, living without care. 

Here I am, all by myself, and I'll admit I'm scared 
All I've got is my guitar and a couple of dollars to spare 
And I know even that's not gonna last me long. 

I suppose I could pick myself up and carry myself back home 
But after what I put my folks through, I think I better stay alone. 
Anyhow, five years of aching are packed behind this plan 
Since I was ten, I've wanted to get out of the city and live out on the land. 

My parents thought I was crazy and I think now maybe they're right 
But I can still feel the freedom in following the eagle's flight. 
I just had to come and see what all the songs were about 
My hope is returning quickly and I don't think there's any doubt 

That I'd better start moving if I want to get somewhere 
I'll go on to the next town and see what I find there 
And stay a while until I go traveling on.
