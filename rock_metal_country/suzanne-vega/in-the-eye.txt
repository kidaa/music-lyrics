If you were to kill me now right here
I would still look you in the eye
And I would burn myself into your memory 
as long as you were still alive

I would live inside of you
I'd make you wear me like a scar 
And I would burn myself 
into your memory
and run through everything you are

I would not run, I would not turn, I would not hide [X2]

In the eye

If you were to kill me now right here
I would still look you in the eye
And I would burn myself 
into your memory
as long as you were still alive

I would not run, I would not turn, I would not hide [X2]

In the eye
Look me in the eye
