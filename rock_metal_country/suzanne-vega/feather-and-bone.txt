you said, come with me 
and so I did 
I thought I could take 
all your sorrow 
I thought I could hold it all 
I never imagined 
your oceans 
so bitter 
the killing 
the falling 
the slaughter 
of feather and bone. 

I sat, still 
in the five o'clock light 
the sun came in through the crack 
the floor to your room 
was all splinters 
and, still, 
some are remaining 
through skin 
and through flesh 
cutting in patterns 
like diamonds 
like needles 
down to the bone. 

I had to know 
I had to see 
I can take it all 
but I will learn 
to be free 

I loved you 
more that you'll ever know 
even through broken windows 
through the blood as it 
ran down your fist 
even
though it was my life 
and my truth 
and my hope 
and my window gone. 

and now 
if you think I'm 
coming back home 
first I should tell you a secret. 
I sleep with a sword near my hand 
each night 
sharpened with dreams 
of your body 
your murder 
your blood 
as it runs down 
my street.
