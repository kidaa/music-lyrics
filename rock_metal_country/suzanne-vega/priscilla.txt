She'd come to my house
and dance in the hall
with the music up loud
against the light on the wall

I danced beside her
feeling no shame
we were in costume
and this was a game

She'd put on her skirt
of layers of chiffon
the top of the umbrella had come off
so I put that on

We'd dance together then
an awkward ballet
she was 20 years older than I was
but still we did play

She was 20 years older than me
and many times my size
but it's her little feet I remember
and the look in her eyes

Once when I saw her
she made me a doll
of ribbon and paper and ink
and lace, I recall

I danced beside her
feeling no shame
we were in costume
and this was a game

I think of her now I'm older
I still love to dance
something will shine through the body
if you give it a chance
