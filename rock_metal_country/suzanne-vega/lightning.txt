Lightning struck a while ago 
And it's blazing much too fast 
But give it rain of waiting time 
And it will surely pass 
Blow over 

And it's happening so quickly 
As I feel the flaming time 
And I grope about the embers 
To relieve my stormy mind 
Blow over 

Shaken this has left me 
And laughing and undone 
With a blinding bolt of sleeplessness 
That's just begun 
And a windy crazy running 
Through the nights and through the days 
And a crackling 
Of the time burned away 
Burned away 

Now I feel it in my blood 
All hot and sharp and white 
With a whipcrack and a thunder 
And a flash of flooding light 

But there'll be a thick and smoky 
Silence in the air 
When the fire finally dies 
And I'm wondering who'll be left there 

In the ashes of the time 
Burned away 
Burned away
