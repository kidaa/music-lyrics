Sonny boy, you need new sneakers 
Better go into town and get then Friday night 
Come to think of it, kid, you need just about everything 
But I think things are gonna be all right, 
Yes, I think things are gonna be all right. 

So you went and got yourself back into trouble 
Went and got yourself into another fight 
Come on here, let me see your eye, now it's all black and swollen 
But I think you're gonna be all right 
Yes, I think that you're gonna be all right. 

I don't know why you're such a troublemaker 
You'd think that maybe by now you'd see the light 
Getting yourself torn up, boy, and we don't have that much money 
But I think maybe things will be all right, 
Yes, I think maybe things will be all right. 

Now maybe I shouldn't yell 
'Cause I know you're just a kid 
But I can't always tell 
What's on your mind, half of the time, brother mine. 

Now I know that you're just my little brother 
And I don't expect you to get everything just right 
But I think you ought to use a little more sense than what you're using 
And maybe then things would be all right, 
Yes, and maybe then thing would be all right. 

I know that I sit and I worry too much 
Especially when you come home such a sight 
But I guess what you've got to do, boy, you go ahead and do it 
And I sure hope thing will be all right, 
Yes, I sure hope things will be all right. 

Now you come back here, you scruffy little brother 
Come on back here and let me kiss you goodnight 
'Cause I know if you were gone I'd miss the sound of laughter 
And that's gonna make everything all right, 
Yes, that's gonna make everything all right.
