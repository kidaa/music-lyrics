What's that they told you 
about a book   a cover? 
Don't judge so quickly, 
Is it too much too remember? 
'Cause pictures lie, 
you know. 
I'll show 
it's so. 
Just give it one thought. 

What's that they taught you? 
To revere a kind of beauty? 
To paint on that pretty veneer 
and try to hide whatever's dirty? 
Well, faces lie. 
You'll see 
no sympathy. 
Just give it one thought. 

Come here and I will whisper true 
about the things I know of you, 
and you will recognize them, 
always...

As near to you as breath and bone, 
so dear to me, and yours alone, 
and I will love you for them, 
always...

What's that they tell you 
about a book   a cover? 
Don't judge so quickly. 
They'll tell you one thing and then another. 
But see what lies 
within,
under the skin. 
Just give it one thought.
