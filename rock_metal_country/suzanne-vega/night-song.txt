It's 2 o'clock this morning 
every sane person is asleep 
I wonder where you are tonight 
and down whose hallways do you creep 
I know you, you're out somewhere 
you know you shouldn't be 
Anyhow, wherever you are, I know you're not thinking of me. 

So it's goodnight 
Maybe I'll see you in the morning 
Soldier of the night 
You try to combat the new day dawning 
Do you fear the light? 
Or do you fear the emptiness in your yawning? 

So you search for life by night 
Hidden from sight 
Safe within the night 
Lost in your crazy flight 
And looking for the fight 
That may prove you are someone 
But you can't stop the rising sun. 

When the sun comes up, the world can see your face 
You slink along the sidewalk, outnumbered and out of place 
All your boldness is gone, you stand there tongue-tied and shy 

And then it's goodnight 
You put on your criminal disguise 
Make sure your mask is tight 
Safe now from all accusing eyes 
You let loose in delight 
Attacking night walkers by surprise 
Protected by the night 
You feel you have the right 
To destroy all in your way 
With the anger built by day 
Now you have learned to kill 
And you do it just for spite 
The twisted rules of night 
Have caught you in its game 
Nobody knows your name 
But the day will come 
And you'll have no place to run 

Because you can't stop the rising sun.
