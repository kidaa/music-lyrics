I am sitting by my window; 
I am thinking of my rent. 
I am looking through my pockets, 
And I'm wondering where it went. 
I am feeling like the Devil, 
Maybe like the Devil's wife. 
I am singing for my supper. 
I am singing for my life. 

Things go up and things go down, 
And we have all these highs and lows, 
But are we even in the end, 
I don't think anybody knows, 
But when I look from my window 
I pretend that I'm in France. 
You know I never have been there 
But I might jump at the chance. 

Tell me what do you do 
With a troubled mind? 
Do you sing? Do you cry? 
Do you wait for a better time? 
Do you think about tomorrow 
When you're living in today? 
And can you stop this tide against you, 
Make it go the other way? 

And when I look from my window 
I can hear the little bird sing; 
And I like to hear those little birds 
Because then I know it's Spring. 
And Spring comes after Winter, 
surely all of this we know. 
And Spring is really coming, 
It's just so god damn slow. 

I am sitting by my window; 
I am thinking of my rent. 
I am looking through my pockets 
And I am wondering where it went. 
I am feeling like the Devil, 
Maybe like the Devil's wife. 
I am singing for my supper. 
I am singing for my life.
