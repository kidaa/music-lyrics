Men will be men and they'll call me the governor 
I'll walk through the bar and I'll buy the next round 
Because this is my ship and I say it's my destiny 
And we'll all go up and go down, we go down, go down 

Through the town and back up through the avenues 
And into the places where people don't stay 
Go visit the king and then leave through the window 
Go hang with the gang and get lost in the fray 

Andy's a saint or a savage, I forget 
Depends on the day and if he's eaten yet 
He's something to see when he's first out of bed 
Not that I'd know, I've just heard it said 

Said that men will be men and they'll call me the governor 
I'll walk through the bar and I'll buy the next round 
Because this is my ship and I say it's my destiny 
And we'll all go up and go down, we go down, go down 

Through the town and back up through the avenues 
And into the places where people don't stay 
Go visit the king and then leave through the window 
Go hang with the gang and get lost in the fray 

Spider's the guy to handle the gun 
He'd show me how, but I don't want one 
He's oh-so polite for a second-story man 
And he's changed his spots as much as anyone can 

We know men will be men and they'll call me the governor 
I'll walk through the bar and I'll buy the next round 
Because this my ship and I say it's my destiny 
And we'll all go up and go down, we go down, go down 

Through the town and back up through the avenues 
And into the places where people don't stay 
Go visit the king and then leave through the window 
Go hang with the gang and get lost in the fray 

Come and sit with the whores and admire the view 
Drink down these beers, I think you've had a few 
Yes and don't look at me, I'm not selling today 
Over the crowd hear the bartender say 

Say that men will be men and they'll call me the governor 
I'll walk through the bar and I'll buy the next round 
Because this is my ship and I say it's my destiny 
And we'll all go up and go down, we go down, go down 

Through the town and back up through the avenues 
And into the places where people don't stay 
Go visit the king and then leave through the window 
Go hang with the gang and get lost in the fray 

Men will be men and they'll call me the governor 
I'll walk through the bar and I'll buy the next round 
Because this is my ship and I say it's my destiny 
And we'll all go up and go down, we go down, go down...
