We're a reference number, a code, a screen. 
An army out of digits, out of fax machines. 
Mapping out the head and heart, mapping out the history. 
If a part does not compute, cut it out, cut it free... 

God is a Number 

What you want to know, what can you believe? 
Grow up on the internet, get off on t.v. 
tell me about God and Country, music, heart and history. 
Answer me with computations, answer me with industry. 

Knock on every door, programmed to receive. 
Answer my communication! Display! Command! Retreat! 
Looking for some kind of heart inside this great machine 
I don't get an answer except 01 1 01 1 01...
