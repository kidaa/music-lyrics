words + guitar 
i got it words + guitar 
i like it 
way way too loud 
i got it words + guitar 
i play it all i play it all 
i play it words + guitar 
can't take this away  from me 
music is the air i breathe 

take take the noise in my head 
take take the noise in my head 
c'mon and turn turn it up 
i wanna turn turn you on 
i play it all i play it all 
i play it words + guitar 
well you want it or you don't 
either you'll come or you won't  
it's the thing you'll never know 
it's the thing you'll never own 
rock you till your good and dead 
rock you till there's nothing left i dream of quiet songs 
i hear the silky sounds 
hush hush and rock 
oh give me pretty song 
oh let me have that sound tonight
