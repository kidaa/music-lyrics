heart attack  
i wait for   
hit and run   
could happen any day   

i'm walking into your house   
'cause i really want to figure you out   
it's always somewhere/someone new each day   
as long as i'm not, i'm not  

looking.. for me   
looking.. for me   

insomnia   
popping pills   
it's still too tight   
it's never right   threw out everything i own again today   
something's bound to give me a disease   
i still feel like nothing next to you   
because you want every, you want it  

everything   
new  
everything  
new, new  

stress case undone preplanned no fun   
i'm scared i've scared them all away   
high strung let go loss of control   
i'm scared i've scared sleep all away
