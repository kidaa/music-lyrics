do you see her face 
when she's gone 
sometimes so bright 
your heart just stops 

did she answer you 
you're other half 
you know they say 
she comes just once 

i am the girl 
i am the ghost 
i am the wife 
i am the one 

do you want to forget 
live in the dark 
was she just too close 
to everything
