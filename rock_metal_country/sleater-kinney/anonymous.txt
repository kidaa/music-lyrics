she's worried she's worried she's worried she said too much  
and talking i'm talking she's talking like books i read  
it's easy it's easy it's easy to shut yourself off  
never on the record it'll never show up  

she wants to be to be anonymous  
i sign i sign i sign anonymous  

feel safe, inside, inside those well drawn lines  
boyfriend, a car, a job, my white girl life  
she swallowed the spider to catch, to catch that fly  
but i don't know why, why she swallowed that lie  

she wants to be to be anonymous  
i sign i sign i sign anonymous  
she wants to be to be like everybody else  
i sign i sign i sign anonymous  

not enough for you to know  
not enough for you to own  
not enough for you to know  
not enough for you to own  

she wants to be to be anonymous  
i sign i sign i sign anonymous  

these words are all i have  
these words are who i am
