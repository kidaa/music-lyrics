I'm onto you 
before the night is through 
I'm going to steal this diamong 
hot rock to you 

how am I to know what you want me to feel? 
counterfeit or real? 
I'm not the one you wanted 
not the thing you keep 

It's a caper theme, there's a getaway car 
A diamond to steal, a plan that might go wrong 
If this is a set up, please let me know 
I can't risk my life for a guilded stone 
I thought all along this was everything 
Try not to look to hard to find that it's not real 
I knew all along you weren't everything 
Then in the darkest hour I watched you disappear It's a crafty scene, full of power and greed 
You tell me not to steal, yet you still want a thief 
You write out the plans, I carry out the act 
But then I lose it all if I can't bring it back 
How was I to know this rock was so fragile 
It cracked in my hands while I was holding on 
An uncut stone is flawed and beautiful 
Don't try to size me down to fit your tiny hands 

It's not real 
You don't need to tell me 
that it's not real 

I'm onto you 
before the night is through 
I'm going to steal my heart back 
and find a love that's true 
hot rock to you
