It's one a.m. you haven't called 
it must be four wherever you are 
And the photo booth strip, and the letter you wrote 
they feel like nothing I could hold 

Nothing bad, nothing free 
there's nothing left 
for me to feel 

It's like goin' to bed at a quarter to three 
Finally tired, finally empoty 

Should I be up to play the game 
back and forth get back at me 
And my confidence fell and I feel so mad 
tell me whose side are you on? 

It's like goin' to peices could fix everything 
At this point I'm really me
