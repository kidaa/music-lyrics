Banned from the end of the world 
I've no millenial fear, 
the future is here, it comes every year. 
If you want me there, I'll play forever dear 
Open up the box a new life rushes out 
Nasty little bug, much work to be done 
Eat all the numbers up, we're 00 gone! 

Hot hot, go back these eyes are shut! 

If you want it, I'll come right over, 
then throw me out when the party's over. Banned from the end of your world 
We can bottle time and sell it back 
It's a nostalgic crime! 
If you want me there, we'll party without fear 
A new world rushes on and we'll just play 
 along 
A night of revelry, spend it here with me 
For so many dreams cannot be contained 

Banned from the end of the world 
The future is here, look in the mirror 
We're the band from the end of the world.
