bad thoughts bad car bad drive  
where are you now  
a mess a lot a lie  
where are you now  
i can't be alone tonight  
where are you now  
i'm tired i'm hurt i'm fine  

you've always got me guessing why  
that's how things happen to find you  
nothing the same after tonight  
and how am i gonna tell you  
nothing is gonna make it right  
don't start i'm not gonna fight you  
keep the house quiet dark tonight  
could be i'm not gonna find you   

one sour one sweet one lime  
where are you now  
taste both taste yours taste mine  
where are you now  
too late too long no light  
where are you now  
i can't see a thing tonight  
where are you now  you've always got me guessing why  
that's how i happen to find you  
nothing the same after tonight  
and how am i gonna tell you  
nothing is gonna make it right  
don't start i'm not gonna fight you  
tell me what's going on in sight  
could be i'm not gonna find you
