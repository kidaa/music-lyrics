baby got a record 
taking me home 
play it loud 
when you're all alone 
hear me singin 
hear this song 
hear my voice 
in your favorite song 

enough it's enough 
if you want it that much 
it's enough 

can't hear nothin' 
but that sound 
is it what you want  
are you ready 
let's go hit the floor 
shake it baby 
a little more 

i make  
rock n roll
