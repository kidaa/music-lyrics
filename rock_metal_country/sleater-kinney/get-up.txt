And when the body finally starts to let go 
let it all go at once 
not peice by peice, 
but like a whole bucket of stars 
dumped into the universe 
Whoooh! Watcb it go! 
Good-bye small hands, good-bye small heart 
good-bye small head 
My soul is climbing tree trunks 
and swinging from every branch 

They're calling on me, 
they're calling on me... 

Do you think I'm an animal? 
Am I not? 
Do you like fur 
Do you wanna come over 
Are we captive only for a short time 
Is there splendor, I'm not ashamed 
Desire shoots through me 
like birds singing 
The way you move no ocean's waves were ever as fluid 

They're calling on me, 
they're calling on me... 

I hit the mark! 
I target moon, I target sky, I target sun. 
Fall down on the world before it falls on you. 

Like beggars, like Stars, 
like whores, us all 
Like beggars, like dogs 
Like Stars, us all 

Shoot straight for my heart 
And when you were near no sky was ever quite so clear 

Like stars, so small 
Like us, when we fall 
Like beggars, like whores 
Like lovers, Get Up! 
Get up...too far.
