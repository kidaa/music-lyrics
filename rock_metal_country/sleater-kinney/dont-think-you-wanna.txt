way up in the sky  
that is where am i  
i breathe the thin air  
i like it way up there  

in a bunch of trees  
i'm down on my knees  
i know what you are  
i know what you are  

and i don't think you wanna know  
i don't think you wanna know  
i don't think you wanna  
mess around up there  

don't think you wanna know   
i don't think you wanna know   
i don't think you wanna   
mess around up there   

angels in the skies   
watch you with their eyes   
they know what you are   
they know what you are   everything i say   
comes back to me one day   
everything you do   
comes back to stare at you   

and i don't think you wanna know   
i don't think you wanna know   
i don't think you wanna   
mess around up there   

don't think you wanna know   
i don't think you wanna know   
i don't think you wanna   
mess around up there   

way up in the sky   
that is where am i   
i breathe the thin air   
i like it way up there
