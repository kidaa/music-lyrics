do you want to try  
go ahead and try  
you want it now  
but thats the way it goes  

do you want to hurt me  
go ahead and try  

you're feeling sick  
you poor thing  
clean up your mess  
then i'll suck your dick  

didn't i tell you  
it wasn't fun  

you want to show me how to play dead  
how to be still  
how to please you  

if i don't give you  
just what you need  
it hurts you  
i'm such a tease  

you're just a boy  
who likes to whine  

i'm gonna choke  
can't feel a thing  
you say go deeper  
you like it when i scream  and then you tell me  
i'm so good  

you want to show me how to play dead  
how to be still  
how to please you  

what's good for you  
is not for me  
what's over for you  
is not over for me  

i won't suck your big ego  
and swallow all my pride  
i'm spitting out your memory  
and stains you left inside of me  

i'm sick of being full with what you fed me  
what i choked down  
rip it out of me, you wanna rip it out of me  

i'll show you how it feels to be dead  
how it feels to be held still  
how i wish you were dead
