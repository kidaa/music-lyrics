in one more hour  
i will be gone 
in one more hour 
i'll leave this room  
the dress you wore  
the pretty shoes 
are things i left   
behind for you 

oh, you've got the darkest eyes 

i needed it  
i know it's hard for you to let it go 
i know it's hard for you to say goodbye 
i know you need a little more time if you could talk 
what would you say 
for you things were 
just night and day 
take off the dress  
take off the face 
i'll hold you close 
before i leave 

don't say another word 
about the other girl
