saw johnny at the store 
i said get your car let's hit the road 
he said tell me baby what's wrong 
oh tell me baby what's wrong 
do do do do..... 
she's on fire now 
you think you wanna watch 
i think you'd better not 

do you wanna get the wheel 
swerve my heart 
it pounds with steel 
he said tell me baby what's wrong 
oh tell me baby what's wrong 

it's not what you want it's everything got my foot on the floor 
we'll go 80 90 5 maybe more 
oh oh tell me baby what's wrong 
oh tell me baby what's wrong 

it's not what you want it's everything 

hold me out, you're my girl
