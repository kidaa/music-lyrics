well you know there ain't no doubt  
when the feeling finds you out 
you know you can try to run 
i tell you it still will come 

when you feel your body shake 
trip and fall you can't walk straight 
baby then you know it's done 
you can feel your heart is stung 

you're the one that i saw 
you're the one that i want well you can try to keep it down 
try not to let the words come out 
but i tell you it's no use 
in your eyes they see right through 

if you're going way too hard 
if you're feeling way too much 
but inside you can't stop 
desire she eats you up 

you're the one that i saw 
you're the one that i want
