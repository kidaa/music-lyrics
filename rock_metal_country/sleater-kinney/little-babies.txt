i'm the water i'm the dishes i'm the soap 
i will comfort make you clean help you cope 
when you're tired feeling helpless 
come inside i am the shelter 
and then when you're feeling better i'll watch you go 

dum dum dee dee dee dum dum dee dum do 
all the little babies go oh oh i want to  
dum dum dee dee dee dum dum dee dum yeah 
rock the little babies with one two three four 

are you hungry did you eat before the show 
i peeled potatoes set the table washed the floor 
i know the others treat you rough 
and when you know you've had enough 
you'll come and see me cos you know 
i'm always here
