Build for me your tightest ship 
make the oars run swift and fast. 
Send me out your strongest crew 
make their hearts and minds steadfast. 
Bless me with Athene 
there's no meaner, she's the best. 
For when we hit the roughest seas 
we'll need all we can get. 

You say ";sink or swim";, what a cruel cruel phrase 
I'd rather fly, don't want to get caught in this endless race. 

The first beast that will appear 
will entice us with money and fame. 
If you listen long enough 
you'll forget there's anything else. 
Tie me to the mast 
of this ship and of this band. 
Tie me to the greater things 
the people that I love. 

You can walk the plank, do the dead man's float 
Never let them see, your heart is pounding full of hope. 

Let the last storm hit us 
let it strike at the hardest part. 
Turn us all to mutiny 
turn this boat upside down. 
I am not the captain 
I am just another fan. 
Sailing off the edge of truth 
into the end of you. 

Eye of the storm, what a cruel myth 
There's no bigger spotlight than show 
 on the ones brave enough to live.
