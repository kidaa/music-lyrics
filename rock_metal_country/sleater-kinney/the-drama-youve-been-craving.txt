oh i wait 
i'm a time bomb 
for something more today 
i'm a fuse 
you know the place it stinks 
tongue is tired 
i smell like despair 
from over use 

all the bridges goanna burn gonna fall down 
burn it down it's so hot it's so hot hot 
is it all on you 

the clock i'm punching in  
i'm a monster 
work 'til i can't give 
i'm a machine 
now there's no time left 
and where i'm headed 
no time left for anything 
it's so obscene all the drama that you crave that you really want 
that you crave that you want that you want want 
is it all on you 

kick it out kick it in 

oh i wait  
i've got drama 
for something more today 
on the brain
