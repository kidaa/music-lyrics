If you want it and you're going out of your mind 
If you want me in your bed we better do it on the sly, 
 and you know why. 
One Song for you 
We wrote a little tune 
it takes off for you 
Hold on, hold on it's coming soon 

If you feel it in your body like a hurricane, 
Let your arms become propellers, take off don't feel any shame. 
I know for you it don't make sense 
I don't make sense 
Nothing comes true 
because the doors were locked for you 

Got a message spelled out in a lovesick bruise 
I got this secret code, only flameholders know how to use. 
Piled up for you 
the note I wrote on hollow walls 
Let me come through 
Pass through the things that we went through 

Have memory of the things we said 
take memory of the things we left 
drop little boy crumbs you could follow back 
when you get lost becoming a man 
It's a lie, it's the truth 
You need it more 
than I do 
I want it all for you 
but I can't live for you
