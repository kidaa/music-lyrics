you got your words 
but they make you stuck 
now you can't feel 
now you can't want 
it's just too messy 
it's just too think 
is it too scary 
is it too real 

it is one desire 
burning hot and bright 
it could fill the sky 
it could fill me up 
worth the trouble 
worth the pain 
it is brave to feel 
it is brave to be alive you write it down 
you strategize 
never go over  
your little lines 

but i'll breathe the air 
i'll sotp the clock 
i'll touch the sky 
and say what i want
