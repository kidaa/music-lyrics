write in passing when there's time   
hide the paper hide my mind   
keep you quiet keep you blind   
don't rock the boat don't read the sign   

you're my co-pilot   
not my god pilot   

you take everything   
you take what I want   
you take everything  
you take what I want  want from you is so defined   
your suit and tie your shiny smile   
your calm belief your piece of mind   
i'll trade you for it then run then fly   

you're my co-pilot   
not my god pilot   

you take everything   
you take what i want   
you take everything   
you take what i want   
you take what i want   
you take what i want   
you take what i want
