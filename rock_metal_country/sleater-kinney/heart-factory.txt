we're manufacturing hearts we've got the perfect thing 
the word on the street we've got the new love machine 
heart with an on/off switch and a remote control 
now you can program how you feel before you walk out the door 

well you can leave 'em hot and you can leave 'em cold 
and you can give 'em what you want and you can get up and go 
and you can take your heart out and you can put it back in 
i think we found the way to put the fun back in sin 

it's not like an organ more like a valentine 
it's cherry cherry red and it beats on time 
we're trying to reduce that heart on heart crime 
you bring your heart to us we'll get it purified 

what are you waiting for?
