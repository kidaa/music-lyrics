all the things i tried to tell you  
on the day i went away  
do i always have to leave  
for you to want me here to stay  
couldn't you just tell me you'll miss me  
all those things we never say  
and i saw you sit there smiling  
as my plane just flew away  

so far. so good. so far. i would.  
so far. so good. so far. i would.  

all the things i tried to write you  
from so very far away  
never had the time to tell you  
reasons why i run away  
if i was with you tomorrow  
would you still feel far away  
when i look and i can't find you  
feels like you have gone away  

so far. so good. so far. i would.  
so far. so good. so far. i would.  please remember, please remember me.  
please remember, please remember me.  

so far. so good. so far. i would.  
so far. so good. so far. i would.  

all the things i tried to tell you  
on the day i went away  
do i always have to leave  
for you to want me here to stay  
couldn't you just tell me you'll miss me  
all those things we never say  
i remember what its like there  
towns that drive me far away
