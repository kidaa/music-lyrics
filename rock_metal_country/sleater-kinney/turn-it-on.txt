don't say the word 
if you don't want it done 
don't tell me your name  
if you don't want it sung 
don't come any closer 
that's good enough 
don't go away 
can't stand the thought  

it's too warm  
inside your hands 
it's too hard  
it's too good 
it's just tht when you touched me 
i could not stand up 
i fell into 
i fell down why can't you tell me 
is it worth a fight 
do i sound crazy 
well i just might 
why do your words 
have to ring so false 
why do your eyes 
have to change so much
