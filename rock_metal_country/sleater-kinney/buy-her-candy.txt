hey don't you wanna 
run and call her name  
if i buy her candy 
will she know who i am 

she's famous 
she's the best 
cannot lay 
my heart to rest 
she is selfish 
she is kind 
no one can say  
she is mine 

like water like spring 
fickle fancy fickle girl 
rain down from the sky 
when i need you the most
