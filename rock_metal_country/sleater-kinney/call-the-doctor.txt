they want to socialize you  
they want to purify you  
they want to dignify, analyze and terrorize you  

this is love and you can't make it  
look out they want what you know  
in a formula or shake me  
steal a kid break a heart steal the show  
i'm your monster i'm not like you  
peel back the skin see what's there  
all your life is written for you  
i'll never show you what's in here  

your life is good for one thing  
you're messing with what's sacred  
they want to simplify your needs and likes  
to sterilize you  this is love and you can't make it  
don't need you to explain the pain  
in a formula or break me  
i can prove to you it's all fake  
i'm your monster i'm just like you  
she's dead but she can stand she can walk  
all my life is right before you  
call the doctor miracle she can talk  

call the doctor  
you  
call the doctor  
are  
call the doctor  
not  
call the doctor  
me   
call the doctor  
YOU  
call the doctor  
ARE  
call the doctor  
NOT  
call the doctor  
ME  

this is love and you can't break it  
this is not really me at all  
in a formula or make me  
stunt girl daring twirls watch me fall  
i'm no monster i'm just like you  
carbon copy same body different hearts  
all my life is right before me  
can't tell anymore the real parts
