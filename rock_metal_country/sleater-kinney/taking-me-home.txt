you come here to my work   
you come here every day  
to make sure i'm still here   
you look at me that way   

rings on my fingers and   
bows in my hair   
you think i'm your present   
you'll unwrap me here   

is this a bad dream   
is this really my life   
well you wanna know   
you'll show me tonight   

?????????????   
?????????????   
?????????????   

NOT FOR SALE   
NOT YOUR GIRL   
NOT YOUR THING   

i'm here on the counter   
with no money down   
for nine ninety nine   
you're taking me home   a dozen red roses   
a cheap little house   
a cheap little ring   
the deal is cut, now   

something is messed up here   
something isn't right   
we're supposed to be free   
i'm supposed to be mine   

this part of my body   
that you're pricing now   
i'm cutting it off   
i'm throwing it out   

NOT FOR SALE   
NOT YOUR GIRL   
NOT YOUR THING   

i got me mixed up with somebody else
