this song, your song,
is the last song i'll ever do 
for you, about me,
'cause your games are through. 
i won't think, i won't breathe,
i won't even close my eyes to dream. 
i'd starve you right out of me
if i knew what else to eat. 
you said, this would be, 
the last time you'd ever hurt me. 
you said, this would be, the last time i'd ever cry.
last time, i didn't know,
how was i supposed to know? 
this time, i found it, i know how to scream. 
I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING. 
I'M NOT A PART OF YOU. 
YOU CAN'T TAKE AWAY EVERYTHING.
I'M NOT A PART OF YOU. 

this song, your song,
is the only song, i'll ever do, 
about you, for me, so i can stay alive.
i can't think, i can't breathe, 
i can't even close my eyes to dream.
i need you out of me
before i turn into you.
i can't stand to look at you, 
until you remember everything. 
i can't be what you are, 
what you think, what you do.
i know what it means when,
i look at you, i look at you. 
and this time, i'm looking
and telling on you. 

I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING.
I'M NOT A PART OF YOU.
WILL TIME TELL ME ANYTHING?
I AM COMING AFTER YOU. can you feel me coming after you? 
can you feel, i'm right behind you?
can you hear me, telling on you? 
can you feel me tearing out of you? 

this song, your song,
is the last song, i'll ever do, 
for you, about me,
'cause your games are through.
this time, i don't feel bad,
for anything i've ever said.
and this time, i want them to know 
what you did.
