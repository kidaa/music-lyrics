I'd set your heart on fire but arson is no way 
 to make a love burn brighter. 
When you saw me, on that first day 
said I'd blossom under your care. 

Always thought that the devil was the only one 
who knew the ins and outs of the ways of love, 
so I sold off my heart to see how this would end, 
now I can't move an inch for fear it will begin. 
Wrap me up tight inside your wing 
Is it safe now, is it safe to breathe? 

You come in between me and the darkness, 
 please don't ever leave. 
I force my eyes open, and now who has changed? 
You look different, so different today 

Holding your eyes in the hardest stare 
running around like you wanted me there 
Lookin' at me like I'm the hottest in town 
then turnin's your back when you're movin' around 
I ain't gonna listen to you no more 
breakin' outta this place throwin' open the door 
Use me up just to fan the flame 
but you'll be sorry as I'm walkin' away 
Backwards, forwards going out of my mind, 
 spinning way off time 
Fire to water, baby's putting me out 

You're the truest light I've known, 
 but someday I'll learn I don't need your fuel to burn. 
I'm the one who decides who I am 
I'm the one who will shed this old skin 

Always thought that hell was the only place 
hot enough to melt our heart into a locked embrace. 
There's something so safe about a lack of air 
the only way to make sure that you'll always be there 
I force my eyes open, and now who has changed? 
I feel different, so different today 

Did you really change your mind? 
Could this be your only crime?
