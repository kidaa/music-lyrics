don't talk like 
like you're nineteen 
you're thirty-five 
if you're a day 
don't act like 
like you're nineteen 
everyone is waiting 

haven't I done enough this time 
haven't I done enough today don't stope here she said 
don't say that 
a part of me is dead 
numb just like a 
fallen limb 
like what you've left behind 

there's a part of me 
that works just like a child 
there's a part of me 
that's you
