Our love is the size of these tumors inside us 
Our love is the size of this hospital room, you're my hospital 
groom 

Put the ring on my finger, so tight it turns blue 
A constant reminder, I'll die in this room if you die in this room 

Sit like a watchdog and patiently wait 
Listen for footsteps down the hallways, visit beds like they're 
graves 

Days go by so slowly 
Nights go by so slowly 
In a hospital room 
In a box built for two 

I fight for air, fight for my own air 
forget all the things I can do alone 
I fight for a heart, I fight for a strong heart 
I fight to never know this sickness you know 
But I know it's my own, I gave it a home 

Our love is the size of these tumors inside us 
Our love is the size of this hole in the ground, where my heart's 
buried now.
