[Shane:]
You and I, weve been at it so long 
I still got the strongest fire 
You and I, we still know how to talk 
Know how to walk that wire 

[Mark:]
Sometimes I feel like The world is against me 
The sound of your voice, baby 
That's what saves me 
When we're together I feel so invincible 

[Shane:]
Cause it's us against the world 
You and me against them all 
If you listen to these words 
Know that we are standing tall 
I don't ever see the day that 
I won't catch you when you fall 
Cause it's us against the world tonight 

[Nicky:]
Us against the world 
Against the world 

[Mark:]
Therell be days 
Well be on different sides but 
That doesnt last too long 
We find ways to get it on track 
And know how to turn back on 

[Shane:]
Sometimes I feel 
I cant keep it together 
Then you hold me close 
And you make it better 
When Im with you 
I can feel so unbreakable 

[Mark:]
Cause it's us against the world 
You and me against them all 
If you listen to these words 
Know that we are standing tall 
I don't ever see the day that 
I won't catch you when you fall 
Cause it's us against the world tonight 

Were not gonna break 
Cause we both still believe 
We know what weve got 
And weve got what we need alright 
Were doing something right...

Cause it's us against the world tonight
