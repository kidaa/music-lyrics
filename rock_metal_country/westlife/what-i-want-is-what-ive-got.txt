All that I want in my life,
is the feeling of peace,
deep within me truly,

I took a chance,
I let go,
I promised myself,
that it wouldn't scare me,
Miracles appear i know,
Now i can see it show,
Cause i,

Found out what i dreamt of,
and i looked it up,
At this very moment,
what i want is what i've got,
Found out what was missing,
and i looked it up, 
And at this very moment,
what i want is what i've got,

Life is too short to hold back,
I won't live in the past,
being lonely now i know,
This is the time of my life,
Yes i'm sure, 
what i want is what i've got,

Miracles appear i know,
miracles appear i know
Now i can see it show,
Cause i,

Found out what i dreamt of,
and i looked it up,
At this very moment,
what i want is what i've got,
Found out what was missing,
and i looked it up, 
And at this very moment,
what i want is what i've got,

Now i've found out, 
what i've been dreaming of,
It's the feeling of peace deep within me,
Cause life is too short to hold back,
I made up my mind, 
I just,

Found out what i dreamt of,
and I looked it up,
At this very moment,
what i want is what i've got,
Found out what was missing,
and i looked it up,
And at this very moment,
what i want is what i've got,

What i want now,
is when i got a chance, 
What i want now,
what i want is what i've got,
what i want is what i've got,
What i want now,
is when i got a chance,
when i've got a chance
What i want now, 
what i've want is what i've got,

Found out what i dreamt of,
and I looked it up,
At this very moment,
what i want is what i've got,
Found out what was missing,
and i looked it up,
And at this very moment,
what i want is what i've got......
