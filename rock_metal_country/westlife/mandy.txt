I remember all my life
Raining down as cold as ice
A shadow of a man
A face through a window
Crying in the night
The night goes into

Morning, just another day
Happy people pass my way
Looking in their eyes
I see a memory
I never realized
How happy you made me oh Mandy

[Chorus:]
Well you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
Well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

I'm standing on the edge of time
I Walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world of uphill climbing
The tears are in my mind
And nothing is rhyming, oh Mandy

[Chorus]

Yesterday's a dream I face the morning
Crying on the breeze
The pain is calling, oh Mandy

[Chorus]

You came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
You kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you...
The Beatles -  Oh darling


Oh! Darling, please believe me
I`ll never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
I`ll never do you no harm

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I`ll never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
Don`t ever leave me alone

When you told me you didn`t need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didn`t need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I`ll never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
I`ll never do you no harm

When you told me you didn`t need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didn`t need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, please believe me
I`ll never let you down
Believe me when I tell you
I`ll never do you no harm
