nahhhhhhaaaaaaaaaahhhhh 
Baby you're so beautiful,
and when i'm near you,
i can't breathe,i can't breathe
A girl like you gets what she wants,
when she wants it,
You're so out of my league,
out my league
I show you no emotion,
Don't let you see, 
what you're doin' to me,
that's what you seeing baby
I imagine the two of us together,
but i've been living in reality,

Fear of rejection, 
kept my love inside,
But time is running out, 
so damn my foolish pride,

I don't care if you think i'm crazy,
crazy
It doesn't matter if it turns out bad,
i don't care
I've got no fear of losing you,
You can't lose what you never had,

Now i'm gonna confess, 
that i love you, love you 
I've been keeping it inside,
inside, 
feelin i could die,
But if you turn away, 
baby that's O.K., 
At least we had a moment,
before you say goodbye, 
You can lose what you never had,

Rules are made for breaking,
breaking
Nothing ventured nothing gained,
I'll be no worse off,
then i am right now,
and i might never get that chance again,
baby,

Fear of rejection,
kept my love inside,
Told my heart i didn't want you, 
but i lied,

I don't care if you think i'm crazy,
i'm crazy
It doesn't matter if it turns out bad,
doesn't matter if it turns out bad
I've got no fear of losing you,
You can't lose what you never had,
yeah

Now i'm gonna confess that i love you,
i love you
I've been keeping it inside,inside 
feelin i could die,i could die
But if you turn away, 
baby that's O.K,
At least we'll have a moment before,
you say good-bye,before you say goodbye

Here on the outside looking in,
Don't wanna stay dreaming bout,
what could have been,
Need to hear you speak my name,
even if you shoot me down in flames,

I don't care if you think i'm crazy,
i 'm crazy baby
It doesn't matter if it turns out bad,
if it turns out bad
I've got no fear of losing you,
You can't lose what you never had, 

Now i'm gonna confess that i love you,
that i love you girl
I've been keepin it inside,
feelin i could die,die
But if you turn away, 
baby that's O.K,
At least we have a moment before,
you say good-bye,

You can't loose what you never had,
You can't loose what you never had,
You can't loose what you never had......
