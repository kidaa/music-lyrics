It's the way she fills my senses
It's the perfume that she wears
I feel I'm losing my defences
To the colour of her hair

And every little piece of her is right
Just thinking about her
Takes me through the night

[Chorus]
Every time we meet
The picture is complete
Every time we touch
The feeling is too much
She's all I ever need
To fall in love again
I knew it from the very start

She's the puzzle of my heart

It's the way she's always smiling
That makes me think she never cries
I feel I'm losing my defences
To the colour of her eyes

And every little piece of her is right

[Chorus]

Like a miracle she's meant to be
She became the light inside of me
And I can feel her like a memory
From long... ago

[Chorus]

Every time we meet
The picture is complete
Every time we touch
The feeling is too much

Every time we meet
The picture is complete
Every time we touch
The feeling is too much
She's all I ever need
To fall in love again
I knew it from the very start
She's the puzzle of my heart
