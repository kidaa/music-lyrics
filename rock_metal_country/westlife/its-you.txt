There's a laugh in my eyes 
There's a waltz in my walk 
And it's been such a long time 
Since there was hope in my talk 
If you never knew 
What it is that's new.. it's you 

'Cause when your hands are in mine 
You set a fire that everyone can see 
And it's burning away 
Every bad memory 
To tell you the truth 
If it's something new.. baby it's you 

It's you in the morning 
It's you in the night 
A beautiful angel came down 
To light up my life 

The world's a different place 
Where nothing's too hard to say 
And nothing's to hard to do 
Never too much to go through 
To tell you the truth 
Everything that's new.. baby it's you 

It's you in the morning 
It's you in the night 
A beautiful angel came down 
To light up my life 
My life, my life 
Ohh 

So if I get to grow old oh if I get to grow old 
With many years behind me many years behind me 
There's only one thing I want aahh 
One thing I need beside me 
For all that you are 
For everything you do 
For all that you've done 
Just for showing me the truth 

It's you 
It's you 
Baby it's you
