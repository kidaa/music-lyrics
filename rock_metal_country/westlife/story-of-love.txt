[All Shane lead vocals:]
This is the story of love

[Bryan:]
Let's make it last forever

[All Shane lead vocals:]
You hold the words that mean so much

[Bryan:]
Let's make a plan together

[All:]
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa

[Shane:]
In the story of love

[All:]
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa

[Shane:]
Oh yeah

[All:]
Whoa, Whoa, Yeah

[Shane:]
Now is the moment
I've been waiting for
When dreams they come to life
No hesitation, only open doors
You pushed those doubts aside

[Mark:]
Somehow you always feel
What is on my mind
Seems like this consequence came right on time, ooohh

[All Shane lead vocals:]
This is the story of love

[Bryan:]
Let's make it last forever

[All Bryan lead vocals:]
You hold the words that mean so much

[Bryan:]
Let's make a plan together

[Shane:]
Baby, oh

[All:]
When my world falls behind
I just look into those eyes

[Mark:]
And see the story of love

[All:]
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Yeah

[Bryan:]
Running in circles
Feels like eternity
Indecision in my mind
You hold the window
Through all the remedies
And filled that space inside

[Mark:]
Somehow you turned the page
To the other side
What was an empty place
Is now filled with life, ooohh

[All Shane lead vocals:]
This is the story of love

[Shane:]
This is the story of love

[Bryan:]
Let's make it last forever

[All Shane lead vocals:]
You hold the words that mean so much

[Bryan:]
Let's make a plan together

[Shane:]
Baby, oh

[All Bryan lead vocals:]
When my world falls behind
I just look into those eyes

[Mark:]
And see the story of love

[All:]
No more illusions
Brought down in our lives

[Mark:]
Oh, my baby, all my confusions pushed aside, oohh

[All:]
This is the story of love

[Bryan:]
This is the story
Let's make it last forever

[All Shane lead vocals:]
You hold the words that mean so much

[Bryan:]
Let's make a plan together

[All:]
When my world falls behind

[Mark:]
Behind

[All:]
I just look into those eyes

[Mark:]
And see the story of love

[All:]
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Yeah

[Shane:]
Oh, baby, yeah

[All:]
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa

[Mark:]
Yeah
