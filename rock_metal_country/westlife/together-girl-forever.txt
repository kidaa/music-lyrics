Dreams are for believing and someday they will come true,
That we would be together,
No-one else but me and you,
Times that we've spent talking girl,
The ways I'd rather be,
Looking into your eyes and pretending girl,
You're in love with me.

[chorus]
We'll be together girl forever,
The way that it should be,
Together girl forever,
If only you could see,
I know now how I'm feeling girl,
My feelings are so true,
Together girl forever, me and you.

I know now where you're coming from,
I realise your point of view,
Please say that someday,
I'll be on my own with you,
I will care for you and love you girl,
No one else will be so good,
I'll be yours and you be mine,
So please say that you would.

[chorus]
We'll be together girl forever,
The way that it should be,
Together girl forever,
If only you could see,
I know now how I'm feeling girl,
My feelings are so true,
Together girl forever, me and you.

Baby, why can't you see how deep my love is for you,
Baby, you know it's me, you know my love is so true.

[chorus]
We'll be together girl forever,
The way that it should be,
Together girl forever,
If only you could see,
I know now how I'm feeling girl,
My feelings are so true,
Together girl forever, me and you.

Together girl forever, me and you
