When I'm with you 
When I'm with you 
When I'm with you you you 
You.. when I'm with you 

What good's a memory 
Without you there with me 
The morning sun ain't the same 
Without you here 
You are the summer breeze 
The wind blowing through the trees 
You make the loneliness 
All just disappear 

Nothing replaces your touch 
Never stop believing in us 
They try to break us 
But we stand strong in love 
They'll be no distance too far 
I gotta be where you are right where you are 

I don't wanna face this world alone 
Without you by my side 
You're the only one 
That makes it feel like home 
And I need you in my life 
When you're not around I'm feeling 
Like a piece of me is missing 
When it feels like the day is closing in 
Somehow I find the faith 
To make it through 
When I'm with you 
When I'm with you 
When I'm with you you you 
You.. when I'm with you 

What's a photograph 
If you're not in the other half 
Why even dream 
If I'm not dreaming of you 
You make me a better man 
Promise I'll do all I can 
Your love keeps me bringing me 
Closer to the truth 

Nothing replaces your touch 
Never stop believing in us 
They try to break us 
But we stand strong in love 
They'll be no distance too far 
I gotta be where you are right where you are 

I don't wanna face this world alone 
Without you by my side 
You're the only one 
That makes it feel like home 
And I need you in my life 
When you're not around I'm feeling 
Like a piece of me is missing 
When it feels like the day is closing in 
Somehow I find the faith 
To make it through 

When I'm with you 
When I'm with you 
When I'm with you you you 
You.. when I'm with you 

When I'm with you 
When I'm with you 
When I'm with you you you 
You.. when I'm with you 

Hey 

I questioned whether time or fate 
Would ever show me a sign 
The moment I saw you 
That's when I knew 
I feel it when I'm with you 

I don't wanna face this world alone 
Without you by my side 
You're the only one 
That makes it feel like home 
And I need you in my life 
When you're not around I'm feeling 
Like a piece of me is missing 
When it feels like the day is closing in 
Somehow I find the faith 
To make it through 
When I'm with you 
When I'm with you 
When I'm with you you you 
You.. when I'm with you 

When I'm with you 
When I'm with you 
When I'm with you you you 
When I'm with you
