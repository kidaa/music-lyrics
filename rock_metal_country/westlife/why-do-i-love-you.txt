Suddenly she's 
Leaving 
Suddenly the 
Promise of love has gone 
Suddenly 
Breathing seems so hard to do 

Carefully you 
Planned it 
I got to know just 
A minute to late, oh girl 
now I understand it 
All the times we 
Made love together 
Baby you were thinking of him 

Why do I love you 
Don't even want to 
Why do I love you like I do 
Like I always do 
You should've told me 
Why did you have to be untrue love you like I do 
Why do I love you like I do 

Ain't gonna show no 
Weakness 
I'm gonna smile 
And tell the whole world I'm fine 
I'm gonna keep my senses 
But deep down 
When no one can hear me 
Baby I'll be crying for you 

Why do I love you 
Don't even want to 
Why do I love you like I do 
Like I always do 
You should've told me 
Why did you have to be untrue love you like I do 
Why do I love you like I do 

Can't go back 
Can't erase 
Baby your smiling face oh no 
I can think of nothing else but you 
Suddenly 

Why do I love you 
Don't even want to 
Why do I love you like I do 
Like I always do 
You should've told me 
Why did you have to be untrue love you like I do 
Why do I love you like I do
