[Nicky:] OK, Lads the last flights just been canceled.
[Kian:] Oh, My God.
[Mark:] What are you talking about
[Shane:] Again
[Mark:] Please tell me your joking.
[Shane:] That's the same old story.
[Brian:] Are you serious
[Kian:] Lads if I could fly this plane meself, we're going home.
[Brian:] Look forget this. It'd be quicker walkin'. I'm going!

[SHANE]
An empty street,
An empty house,
A whole inside my heart.
I'm all alone.
The rooms are getting smaller.
I wonder how,
I wonder why,
I wonder where they are.
The days we had,
The songs we sang together.
Oh, yeah.

[ALL]
And oh, my love.
I'm holding on forever.

[SHANE]
Reaching for a love that seems so far.

[ALL]
So, I say a little prayer.
And hope my dreams will take me there.
Where the skies are blue.
To see you once again, 
My love.
Over seas and coast to coast.
Find the place I love the most.
Where the fields are green.
To see you once again, 
[SHANE]
My love.

[BRYAN]
I try to read,
I go to work,
I'm laughin' with my friends.
But I can't stop,
To keep myself from thinking.
Oh, no.
I wonder how,
I wonder why,
I wonder where they are.
The days we had,
The songs we sang together.
Oh, yeah.

[ALL]
And oh, my love.
I'm holding on forever.

[SHANE]
Reaching for a love that seems so far.

[ALL]
So, I say a little prayer.
And hope my dreams will take me there.
Where the skies are blue.
To see you once again, 
My love.
Over seas and coast to coast.
Find the place I love the most.
Where the fields are green.
To see you once again... 

[MARK]
To hold you in my arms.
To promise you my love.
To tell you from the heart,
You're what I'm thinking of.
I'm reaching for the love that seems so far.

[ALL]
Soooo, I say a little prayer.
[SHANE ECHO]
Yeeaahhh...
And hope my dreams will take me there.
Where the skies are blue.
To see you once again, 
My love.
[MARK ECHO]
Looove
Over seas and coast to coast.
[SHANE ECHO]
Over seas
Find the place I love the most.
[MARK ECHO]
Love the most
Where the fields are green.
To see you once again,
My love.
[SHANE]
I say a little prayer
[BRYAN ECHO]
My sweet prayer
Dreams will take me there
[ALL]
Where the skies are blue
[SHANE ECHO]
Oh yeah
To see you once again
[SHANE ECHO]
Oh, my love
Over seas and coast to coast
To find the place I love the most.
Where the fields are green.
To see you once again,
My love.
