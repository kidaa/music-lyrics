Two very different people,
too scared to get along,
Till two hearts beat together,
underneath one sun,

One very special moment,
can turn a destiny,
And what some would say,
could never change,
has changed for you and me,

Cause it's all,
It's all in the way,
you look through your eyes,
and when all is said and done,
All of the fear and all of the lies are,
not hard to overcome,
It's all in the way you look at it,
that makes you strong,
We were two, we were two
now we are one,

We are two very different people,
so much to overcome,
So why care for one another,
when there's so much to be done,

Cause sometimes it's necessary,
just look how far we've come,
You could say my friend that,
it's the end,
or a new tale has begun,

Cause it's all, 
It's all in the way,
you look through your eyes,
and when all is said and done,
All of the fear 
and all of the lies are, the lies
not hard to overcome, no no
It's all in the way you look at it,
that makes you strong,
We were two, we were two
now we are one,

One moment in time,
is all the time we need,
Just to make a difference,
to make it better for you and for me,
If you just believe,

oh yeah..........
Just open your eyes,

Cause it's all in the way you,
look through your eyes,your eyes
and when all is said and done oh yeah
All of the fear and all of the lies are,
not hard to overcome,
It's all in the way you look at it,
that makes you strong,
We were two, we were two
now we are one,

oh yeah, oh yeah,
We were two,
now we are one......
