I can't sleep, everything I ever knew
Is a lie without you
I can't breathe, when my heart is broke in two
there's no beat without you

You're not gona but you're not here
Least that's the way it seems tonight
If we could try to end these wars
I know that we can make it right
'Cause baby

Chorus
I don't wanna fight no more
I forgot what we were fighting for
And this loneliness that's in my heart
Won't let me be apart form you
I don't wanna have to try
Girl, to live without in my life
So I'm hoping we can start tonight
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more

How can I live, when everything that I adore
And everything I'm living for
Girl it's in you
I can't dream, sleepless nights have got be bad
Tha only dream I ever had is being with you

I know that we can make it right
It's gonna take a little time
Let's not leave ourselves with no way out
Let's not cross that line, line

Chorus

Remember that I made a vow
That I would never let you go
I meant it than I mean now and I wanna tell you so

Chorus
