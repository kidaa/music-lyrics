[Shane:]
I've made up my mind, I'm gonna follow,
I'm no longer blind, no longer hollow,
Since I met you, my life is upside down,
Ohh yeah,

They say,
Once in a lifetime, out of the blue,

[Mark:]
Here comes an angel, I know it's you,

[All:]
Yes I'm ready to go through the tunnel of love,
Yes I'm ready to be all you're dreaming of,
So I swear to you now and to the stars above,
Let's walk through the tunnel of love,

[Bryan:]
I want you to know,
For the first time, I know where to go,
For the first time, I'm not afraid,
To open up my heart,
Oh no,

They say, Once in a lifetime, out of the blue,

[Bryan:]
Here comes an angel, I know it's you,

[All:]
Yes I'm ready to go through the tunnel of love,
Yes I'm ready to be all you're dreaming of,
So I swear to you now and to the stars above,
Lets walk through the tunnel of love,

Light of my life keeps shining baby,
Light of my life...

[Shane:]
ohh 

[All:]
Once in a lifetime,
Out of the blue,

[Mark:]
Here comes an angel, I know it's you,

[All:]
No one has touched me like you,
Yes I want you baby,
No one no no one

[Mark:]
has loved me so true,

[All:]
Yes I'm ready to go through the tunnel of love,
Yes I'm ready to be all you're dreaming of,
So swear I to you now and to the stars above,
Let's walk through the tunnel of love,
Oh yeah,
So I swear to you now and the stars above,
Let's walk through the tunnel of love.
