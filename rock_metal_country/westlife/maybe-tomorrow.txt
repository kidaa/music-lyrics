[Shane:]

Cant believe its over
That you're leaving
Weren't we meant to be?

Should've sensed the danger
Read the warnings
Right there in front of me

Just stop
Lets start it over
Couldn't I get one more try?

[All:]

Maybe tomorrow you'll say that you're mine
You'll realize, I could change
I'm gonna show you I'm in it for life
I'll get you back someday
Maybe tomorrow

[Shane:]

I forgot to be there
I was selfish
I can see that now

[Mark:]

I should've got to known you
Should've held you
When your tears fell down

Just stop
Don't make me beg you
Tell me that you'll stay the night

[All:]

Maybe tomorrow you'll say that you're mine
You'll realize, I could change
I'm gonna show you I'm in it for life
I'll get you back someday
I will find a way

[Nicky:]

Wait a minute
Just hear me out
This time I promise, I'll put you first

[Shane:]

Turn around now
Your heart can't let you walk away
I'll do what it takes

[All:]

Maybe tomorrow you'll say that you're mine
You'll realize realize, I could change I can change
I'm gonna show you I'm in it for life
I'll get you back someday
Maybe tomorrow

[Kian:]

There's so much I wanna say now
I just wanna make a life with you don't walk away
There's so much I wanna do now
I just wanna make love to you

[Shane:]

Maybe tomorrow
Maybe tomorrow
