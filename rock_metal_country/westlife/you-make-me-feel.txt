I've been trying to reach you
'Cause I got something to say
But you're talking about nothing at all
And you're slipping away
We were crying together
It was a long time ago
Before you walk out the door
And leave me this way
Just here what I say
You make me feel
You make me real
For the rest of my days
In so many ways

You make me feel
I've been trying to leave you
Why should we go on like this
But my heart can't breathe
When I hear you sya
It's better this way

Chorus

Ten thousand light years away from you
Keep thinking maybe it's time to let go
But by the end of the day
I still want to say "Do you"

Chorus
