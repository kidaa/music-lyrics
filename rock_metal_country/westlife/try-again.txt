[Shane:]
Hush now don't you cry 
There will be a better day 
I promise you 
We can work it out
But only if you let me know 
What's on your mind 

[Mark:]
Baby, you thought it was forever 
Through any kind of weather 

[Shane:]
But some day you will find what you're searching for 

[All:]
Try again 
Never stop believing 
Try again 
Don't give up on your love 
Stumble and fall 
Is the heart of it all 
When you fall down down 
Just try again 

[Bryan:]
Smile now, let it go 
Hey, you will never be alone 
I promise you 
If you can't fight the feeling Oh yeah 
Surrender in your heart 

Remember love will set you free 

[Shane:]
Baby, you thought it was forever
You would always be together
But someday you will find what you're searching for 

[All:]
Try again
Never stop believing
Try again
Don't give up on your love
Stumble and fall
Is the heart of it all
When you fall down down
Just try again

[Shane:]
Baby, when a heart is crying 
Its sometimes feels like dying 
The tear drops fall like rain

Baby, you thought it was forever 
You would always be together 
But someday you will find what you're searching for

[All:]
Try again ooh yeah
Never stop believing oh no
Try again
Don't give up on your love
[Mark:] Dont' give up on your love baby

Try again
[Mark:] just try again
Never stop believing
Try again
Don't give up on your love 

Stumble and fall
Is the heart of it all

[Shane:]
When you fall down 
Just try again
