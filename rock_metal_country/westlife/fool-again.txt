[Shane:]
Baby
I know the story,
I've seen the picture
It's written all over your face
Tell me
What's the secret
That you've been hiding
And who's gonna take my place

I should have seen it coming
I should've read the signs
Anyway...
I guess it's over

[Chorus:]
Can't believe that I'm the fool again,
I thought this love would never end 
How was I to know
You never told me,
Can't believe that I'm the fool again 
And I who thought you were my friend,
How was I to know
You never told me.

[Bryan:]
Baby
You should have called me
When you were lonely
When you needed me to be there
Sadly
You never gave me
Too many chances
To show you how much I care

I should have seen it coming
I should've read the signs
Anyway...
I guess it's over

[Chorus]

[Mark:]
About the pain and the tears,
oh oh oh,
If I could I would,
Turn back the time

[Shane:]
Ooh yeah
I should've seen it coming
I should've read the signs
Anyway...
I guess it's over

[Chorus x2]
