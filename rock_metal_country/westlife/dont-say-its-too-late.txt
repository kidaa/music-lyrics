It doesn't take much to learn 
when the bridges that you burn 
Leave you stranded feeling alone 
It doesn't take much to cry 
when you're living in a lie 
And deceiving that someone who cares 
If I could turn back the time 
I would put you first in my life 

And I would risk it all for you 
to prove my love is true 
I'll build a wall around my heart 
that would only break a part for you 
Can change the way I feel 
so tell me what's the deal 
Don't say 
Don't say it's too late 

And now 
The hills are getting hard to climb 
I'm runnin' out of time 
My decisions are pending on you 
And I will accept the blame 
for burnin' out the flame 
Hoping the story will twist once again 
If I could turn back the time 
I would put you first in my life 

And I would risk it all for you 
to prove my love is true 
I'll build a wall around my heart 
that would only break a part for you 
Can change the way I feel 
so tell me what's the deal 
Don't say 
Don't say it's too late 

Now I'm 
Layin' it all on the line 
For you 

And I would risk it all for you 
to prove my love is true 
I'll build a wall around my heart 
that would only break a part for you 
Can change the way I feel 
so tell me what's the deal 
Don't say 
Don't say it's too late
