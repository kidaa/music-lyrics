There is no reason you should feel like this
I know that I am the only one to blame
I feel your agony it's hidden in your kiss, oh

I don't believe that things are said and done
I only hope there's still time to be the one
We can work it out if only you let me, oh

Chorus
Whatever you say, whatever you do
There will be good times waiting for you
Whatever you hear I won't disappear
I promise you that, I promise you that

I never said that I could change the world
But if you gave me the chance that I deserve
I know that in your heart, you can forgive me, oh

Chorus
Whatever you say, whatever you do
There will be good times waiting for you
Whatever you hear I won't disappear
I promise you that, I promise you that

We have times only a fool could miss 
But still there is time to turn it around
I'm not saying it's an easy thing
Let me show you, I promise you that, oh ,yeah

Whatever, whenever, there will be good time there will be good time
Whatever you hear whatever you hear
I won't disappear

Chorus
Whatever you say, whatever you do
There will be good times waiting for you
Whatever you hear I won't disappear
I promise you that, I promise you that
