You never close your eyes any more 
When I kiss your lips 
And there's no tenderness like before 
In your fingertips 
You're trying hard not to show it baby 
But baby, baby I know it 

You've lost that loving feeling 
Oh, that loving feeling 
You've lost that loving feeling 
Now it's gone, gone, gone 
Whoa-oh 

Now there's no welcome look 
In your eyes when I reach for you 
And girl you're starting to criticize 
little things I do 
It makes me just feel like crying baby 
'Cause baby, something beautiful's dying 

You've lost that loving feeling 
Oh that loving feeling 
You've lost that loving feeling 
Now it's gone gone gone 
Whoa-oh 

Baby baby I get down on my knees for you 
If you would only love me like you used to do, yeah 
We had a love 
A love a love you don't find every day 
So don't, don't, don't, don't let it slip away 

Baby baby I beg you please, please 
I need your love, I need your love 
So bring all back, bring all back 
Bring back that loving feeling 
Oh, that loving feeling 
Bring back that loving feeling 
Cause it's gone...gone...gone... 
And I can't go on... 
Whoa-oh
