[Shane:]
Stay with me
Don't fall asleep too soon
The angels can wait for a moment

Come real close
Forget the world outside
Tonight we're alone
It's finally you and I

It wasn't meant to feel like this
Not without you

[All:]
Cos when I look at my life
How the pieces fall into place
It just wouldn't rhyme without you
When I see how my path
Seem to end up before your face
The state of my heart
The place where we are
Was written in the stars

[Bryan:]
Don't be afraid
I'll be right by your side
Through the laughter and pain
Together we're bound to fly

I wasn't meant to love like this
Not without you

[All:]
Cos when I look at my life
How the pieces fall into place
It just wouldn't rhyme without you
When I see how my path
Seem to end up before your face
The state of my heart
The place where we are
Was written in the stars

[Mark:]
I made a few mistakes, yeah
[Shane:]
Like sometimes we do
[Mark:]
Been through lot of heartache 
But I made it back to you

[All:]
Cos when I look at my life
How the pieces fall into place
It just wouldn't rhyme without you
And when I see how my path
Seem to end up before your face
The state of my heart
The place where we are
Was written in the stars

[All:]
When I look at my life
How the pieces fall into place
It just wouldn't rhyme without you
When I see how my path
Seem to end up before your face
The state of my heart
The place where we are
Was written in the stars

[Shane:]
The state of my heart
The place where we are
Was written in the stars
