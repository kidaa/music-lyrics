I know it's all about you 
It's all about me 
Working it out, yeah 
That's what it's all about 


Maybe I was wrong about it 
Maybe you were right 
I was selfish and demanding 
Never satisfied 
Ooh and maybe I made some mistakes before 
but this time I'll get it right 


Chorus 
I know it's all about you 
It's all about me 
working it out, yeah 
That's what its all about 
It's all about love 
It's all about trust 
I know that you've got your doubts yeah, 
That's what it's all, it's all about 
Yeah, that's what it's really all about 

People said I could live without you 
That would be a lie that would be a lie 
I was surely down without you 
How could I survive 
Ooh, lesson learned blame it all on me 
'Cause you made me realise 


I know it's all about you 
It's all about me 
working it out, yeah 
That's what its all about 
It's all about love 
It's all about trust 
I know that you've got your doubts yeah, 
That's what it's all, it's all about 


Love you got to have some patience 
No matter what the situation 
When you know what's on your mind 
You've got to follow the feelings inside 


Chorus to fade
