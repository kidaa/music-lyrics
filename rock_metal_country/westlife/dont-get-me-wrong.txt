Don't get me wrong 
I've played my part and it's over 
I'm tired of being strong 
By hiding that I'm not yeah 

Don't get me wrong 
You've played your part and I think you know 
This love's for real 
It's time to show just how I feel 

Time after time 
I refuse to see why 
I can't go on without you by my side 

Baby I just wanna get to know that if you care 
you could be part of my life 
Baby don't you know we could be doing this forever 
and be doing alright 
Yeah 

Time after time 
This moment's been on my mind 
Now I've left it behind 

Oh don't get me wrong 
Yeah 

Don't get me wrong 
You bruised my heart and it's aching 
It wouldn't take you long 
To see that I'm in pain 

Don't get me wrong 
If you run off now 
You should be mistaken 
This love's for real 
And baby this is how I feel yeah 

Time after time 
I've been tryin' to deny 
I can't go on without you by my side 

Baby I just wanna get to know that if you care 
you could be part of my life 
Part of my life yeah 
Baby don't you know we could be doing this forever 
and be doing alright 
Yeah 

Time after time 
This moment's been on my mind 
Now I've left it behind 

Just don't get me wrong 
Ooh ooh don't get me wrong 

No no baby

Time after time 
I've been tryin' to deny 
I need the nearness of you to get by 

Don't get me wrong 
Baby I just wanna get to know that if you care 
you could be part of my life 
Part of my life baby 
Baby don't you know we could be doing this forever 
and be doing alright

Time after time 
This moment's been on my mind
