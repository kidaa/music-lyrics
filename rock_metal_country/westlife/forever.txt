[All:]
I'll be loving you forever,
Deep inside my heart you'll leave me never,
Even if you took my heart,
And tore it apart,
I would love you still, forever,

[Bryan:]
You are the sun,
You are my light,
And you're the last thing on my mind,
Before I go to sleep at night,
You're always round,
When I'm in need,
When trouble's on my mind,
You put my soul at ease,

There is no one in this world,
Who can love me like you do,
That is the reason that I,
Wanna spend forever with you,

[All:]
I'll be loving you forever,
Deep inside my heart you leave me never,
Even if you took my heart,
And tore it apart,
I would love you still, forever,

[Shane:]
We've had our fun,
We've made mistakes,
But who'd have guessed along that road,
We'd learn to give and take,
It's so much more than I could have dreamed,
Cause you make loving you, so easy for me,

There is no one in this world,
Who can love me like you do,
That is the reason that I,
Wanna spend forever with you,

[All:]
I'll be loving you forever,
Deep inside my heart you leave me never,
Even if you took my heart,
And tore it apart,
I would love you still, forever,

[Shane:]
And girl I pray you leave me, never,

[Mark:]
Cause this is the world, where lovers often go astray,
But if we love each other, we won't go that way,
So put your doubts aside,
Do what it takes to make it right,
I love you, forever, no-one can tear us apart,

[All: Mark:]
I'll be loving you forever, forever
Deep inside my heart you leave me never,
Even if you took my heart, took my heart girl
And tore it apart, you tore it apart now
I would love you still, forever,
And I'll be loving you forever, forever
Deep inside my heart you leave me never,
Even if you took my heart, you took my heart girl
And tore it apart, you tore it apart now
I would love you still, forever,
I'll be loving you forever,
Deep inside my heart you leave me never,
Even if you took my heart,
And tore it apart,
I would love you still, forever
