It's never too hard to find the words 
The words to say to you 
You make it so easy just to talk 
The way we talk things through 
You're never too tired to care 
You're never too busy to just be there
And when I smile my feelings show 
So everybody, everybody knows 

[All:]
And everybody knows this love's for sure
There's no searching anymore 
And no-one never doubts you're mine, I'm yours 
It's the one thing that's for sure 
And everyone we know says all the time 
They wish they had a love like yours and mine 
And everybody knows 

[Mark:]
Even people in love said I'm a fool 
For loving you too much 
But we were the exception to the rule 
For us it's not enough 
They used to say we were out of touch 
Now everyone wants to be like us 
Not afraid to let it show 
So everybody, everybody knows 

[All:] 
And everybody knows this love's for sure
There's no searching anymore 
And no-one never doubts you're mine, I'm yours 
It's the one thing that's for sure 
And everyone we know says all the time 
They wish they had a love like yours and mine 
And everybody knows 

[Shane:]
Like yours and mine 
That bridges all divides 
A love to conquer time 
[Mark:]
When everybody knows 

[All:]
And everybody knows this love's for sure
There's no searching anymore 
And no-one never doubts you're mine, I'm yours 
It's the one thing that's for sure 
And everyone we know says all the time 
They wish they had a love like yours and mine 
And everybody knows 

And everybody knows this love's for sure
There's no searching anymore 
And no-one never doubts you're mine, I'm yours 
It's the one thing that's for sure 
And everyone we know says all the time 
They wish they had a love like yours and mine 
And everybody knows 

And everybody knows this love's for sure
There's no searching anymore 
And no-one never doubts you're mine, I'm yours 
It's the one thing that's for sure 
And everyone we know says all the time 
They wish they had a love like yours and mine 
And everybody knows
