Nah nahnah nah nahnah 
All around the world
All around the world
Someone needs somebody 
Let it be a shield 
All around the world 
All around the world
Someone's feeling lonely 
But I know you never will 

[ALL]
Cause when it all gets too much 
Put your head down on my shoulder 
A little warmth when it gets colder 
Now I don't know the things that you're going through 
But you can put your head down 
On my shoulder 
Where the storm is it blows over
I know you're there for me too 
No I'll be there for you 

[BRYAN]
You're waiting for a change 
You're waiting for the day 
When all that you remember is with you once again 
There's a long road ahead 
Stretches out for miles 
And if you want some company 
Walk with me a while 
Ohh and when the road gets too rough 

[ALL]
You can put your head down on my shoulder 
A little warmth when it gets colder 
I don't know the things that you're going through 
But you can put your head down 
On my shoulder 
Where the storm is it blows over
I know you're there for me too 
So I'll be there for you, for you, for you, yeah, oooh

[SHANE]
When it all..gets... too... much... 

[ALL]
Put your head on my shoulder, on my shoulder
Your head on my shoulder, on my shoulder
Put your head on my shoulder, now

Oooh, you can put your head on my shoulder
Put your head on my shoulder
Put your head on my shoulder, now

Oooh, put your head on my shoulder 
A little warmth when it gets colder, Put your head on my shoulder
I don't know the things that you're going through, Put your head on my shoulder

Baby, put your head on my shoulder 
Where the storm is it blows over, Put your head on my shoulder
I know your there for me too, Put your head on my shoulder
So I'll be there for you
