I'm only human 
Sometimes I make mistakes
If you forgive me
I'm gonna do what it takes

But now I know better 
To hurt you was wrong
Girl it's with you I belong

Somebody needs you like never before
Somebody wants your love
Baby so open the door
Don't you leave me alone
Don't you turn out the light 
Somebody wants you
Somebody needs you tonight

I've been thinking 
We should be talking it through
You must believe me
I'll make it up to you

Cause I now know better 
To hurt you was wrong
Girl it's with you I belong

Somebody needs you like never before
Somebody wants your love
Baby so open the door
Don't you leave me alone
Don't you turn out the light 
Somebody wants you
Somebody needs you tonight

In the dark,
When there's no one else around
I still pray
That our love can be found 

Somebody needs you like never before
Somebody wants you
Baby open the door
Don't you leave me alone
Don't you turn out the light 
Somebody wants you
Somebody needs you

Somebody needs you like never before
Somebody wants your love
Baby open the door
Don't you leave me alone
Don't you turn out the light 
Somebody wants you
Somebody needs you tonight
