Stay, stay where you are.
Dont let me go,
Dont let me go.
Made it this far.

Oh baby stop!
Stop right there.
Dont walk away,
Dont walk away.
Into thin air.

We survived the crash,
Made it through the wreckage.
Standing here at last.
So perfectly written.

Now where we are,
Is where were suppose to be.
Where we are,
Keeps the breathe in me.
Where we've been,
Risen from the day.
Where we're no one
can tear us apart.
That's where we are.

Dont, dont turn around.
We got to let,
Weve got to let,
Go of the past now.
Oh fear,
Live by your side.
Were out of danger,
No reason to hide.

We survived the storm,
Made it through the hurricane.
Standing here at last,
Dry despite the rain.

Now where we are,
Is where were suppose to be.
Where we are,
Keeps the breathe in me.
Where we've been,
Risen from the day.
Where we're no one
can tear us apart.
That's where we are.

Stay, stay where you are.

Now where we are,
Is where were suppose to be.
Where we are,
Keeps the breathe in me.
Where we've been,
Risen from the day.
Where we're no one
can tear us apart.
That's where we are.
Thats where we are.
