I wake my faith shaken inside
Images of you race to mind
Did I forget I meant to tell you something?
Only half 'til you have to fall
Only whole when you're seeing it all
Oh you saved something for me

[Chorus:]
Between lost and found
You showed me the difference
Between safe and sound
You showed me the distance
Oh I was sliding, safe but I was hiding out
Oh I fell I'm not down
You showed me the difference

Everything was slipping right through my hands
Hard to find any place to land
Clouds don't cover me where I stand anymore
Only half 'til you think you lost
Only whole when youre reaching across
You saved something for me

[Chorus]

You resurrected me
Eyes wide open to dream
In scattered pieces when you found me

[Chorus]

You showed me the difference
You showed me the difference
