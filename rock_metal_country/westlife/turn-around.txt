[Mark:]
Some people are lucky, baby
I guess I am too
Love found me
And I found you
And everytime I think it can't get better
You do something new
And I'm renewed

[Shane:]
And when it gets cold and
I think its over
Look what you go and do

[Chorus all:]
Everytime I turn around
You give me a reason
For feeling the way that I do
Everytime I turn around
Give me a reason
To put my faith in you
Even when you let me down
I forgive you
Cause I know that you feelin' it too
Anytime I turn around
Make me believ in,
In things that I already knew

[Mark:]
You wrap me up in kisses, baby
Head to toe
Let the whole world stare
I don't care
You make me breakfast in bed
Just to show me
No one wants me more
I'm so sure

[Bryan:]
And when it gets cold and
And I think its over
Look what you go and do

[Chorus all:]
Everytime I turn around
Give me a reason
For feeling the way that I do
Everytime I turn around
Give me a reason
To put my faith in you
Even when you let me down
I forgive you
Cause I know that you feelin' it too
Anytime I turn around
Make me believing
In things that I already knew

[All:]
Turnaround, Turnaround, Turnaround...
Turnaround, Turnaround, Turnaround...

[All:]
You know
I know
It's hard
Let go
My love
Who know
How long to work it

I should know
Yes I know
It's hard
To let go
So my love
Who know

[Chorus all:]
Everytime I turn around
Give me a reason
For feeling the way that I do
Everytime I turn around
Give me a reason
To put my faith in you
Even when you let me down
I forgive you
Cause I know that you feelin' it too
Anytime I turn around
Make me believing
In things that I already knew
