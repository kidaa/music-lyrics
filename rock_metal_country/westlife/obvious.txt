[Shane:]
Yeah, ooooh...
We started as friends
But something happened inside me
Now I'm reading into everything
But there's no sign you hear the lightning, baby

You don't ever notice me turning on my charm
Or wonder why I'm always where you are

[Shane Westlife:]
I've made it obvious
Done everything but sing it
I've crushed on you so long, but on and on you get me wrong
I'm not so good with words
And since you never notice
The way that we belong
I'll say it in a love song

[Bryan Westlife:]
I've heard you talk about
Heard you talk about
How you want someone just like me Bryan echo: just like me
But everytime I ask you out
Time I ask you out
We never move pass friendly, no no

And you don't ever notice how I stare when we're alone
Or wonder why I keep you on the phone

[Shane Westlife:]
I've made it obvious
Done everything but sing it
I've crushed on you so long but on and on you get me wrong
I'm not so good with words
And since you never notice
The way that we belong
I'll say it in a love song
Yeah...

[Mark:]
You are my very first thought in the morning

[Shane:]
And my last at nightfall

[Mark:]
You are the love that came without warning

[Mark & Shane:]
I need you, I want you to know

[Shane Westlife:]
I've made it obvious
So finally I'll sing it
I've crushed on you so long
I'm not so good with words
And since you never notice
The way that we belong
I'll say it in a love song

[Westlife:]
And sing it until the day you're holding me
I've wanted you so long but on and on you get me wrong
I more then adore you but since you never seem to see

[Shane:]
But you never seem to see
I'll say it in this love song
