Baby you're so beautiful
And when I'm near you I can't breathe
A girl like you gets what she wants
When she wants it
You're so out of my league
Out of my league
I show you no emotion
Don't let you see what you're doin' to me
Don't let you see it, baby
I imagined the two of us together
But I been living in reality

Fear of rejection, kept my love inside
But time is running out, so damn my foolish pride

Chorus
I don't care if you think I'm crazy I'm crazy
It doesn't matter if it turns out bad If it turns out bad
I've got no fear of losing you
You can't lose what you never had
Now I'm gonna confess that I love you Love you
I'd be keeping it inside
Feeling I could die
But if you turn away
Baby, that's okay
At least we'll have a moment before you say goodbye
You can't lose what you never had

Rules are made for breaking
Nothing ventured nothing gained
I'll be no worse off than I am right now
And I may never get the chance again, baby

Fear of rejection, kept my love inside
Told my heart I didn't want you but I lied

Chorus

Here on the outside lookin' in
Lookin' in
Don't wanna stay dreamin' 'bout what could've been
Need to hear you speak my name
Even if you shoot me down in flames

Chorus

You can't lose what you never had
No to fade
