Bryan: 
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day, 
When it's cold outside, 
I've got the month on May. 

All: 
I guess you say, 
What can make me feel this way. 

Bryan: 
My girl, 
My girl, 
Talking about my girl. 

Shane: 
I've got so much honey, 
The bees envy me, 
I've got a sweeter song, 
Than the birds in the trees. 

All: 
Well, I guess you say, 
What can make me feel this way. 

Shane: 
My girl, 
Talking about my girl. 

All: 
Hey, hey, hey, 
Hey, hey, hey, 
Ohh yeah. 

Mark: 
I don't need no money, 
Fortune or fame, 
I've got all the riches baby, 
One man can claim. 

All: 
Well, I guess you say, 
What can make me feel this way. 

Mark: 
My girl, 
Talking about my girl. 

All: 
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day, 
With my girl, 
I even got the month of may, 
My girl, 
Talking about my girl, 
Talking about, 
Talking about, 
My girl, 
My girl.
