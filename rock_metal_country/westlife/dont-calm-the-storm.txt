[Shane:]
You say you need some time on your own 
You say we should put our love on hold 
But, baby, don't leave me now all alone in the cold
You said you believed in us, baby
But now you're walking away from me, oh yeah

[All Shane:]
Don't calm the storm
Keep on walkin' baby
Just walk out that door 
Or just stay a while
Or you'll stay a while 
And we'll make it right 
Don't be afraid 
I know how to ease my pain
Oh oh oh oh oh

[Shane Bryan:]
I know there were things I said that were wrong 
I know there were things I said that were wrong 
Girl, I always knew where my heart belonged 
If you want me to walk away I will, but it hurts me so 
Oh baby, just open your eyes open your eyes
Hear me now hear me now 
It doesn't have to be this way 

[All Shane:]
Don't calm the storm
Keep on walkin' baby
Just walk out that door 
Or just stay a while
Or you'll stay a while 
And we'll make it right 
Don't be afraid 
I know how to ease my pain
Oh oh oh oh oh

[Shane:] Ooh ooh baby
[All:] I know there were things I said that were wrong
[Mark :] Oh oh yeah I know I was wrong
[All:] If you want me to walk away I will, but it hurts me so 
[Mark :] I'll go I'll go but it hurts me so
[Bryan:] Open your eyes hear me now 
[Shane:] It doesn't have to be this way 

[Shane All:]
Don't calm the storm
don't calm the storm
Just walk out walk out that door 
Walk out that door
Or you'll stay a while 
And we'll make it right 
Don't be afraid 
I know how to ease my pain

[All Shane:]
Don't calm the storm
Keep on walkin' baby
Just walk out that door 
Or just stay a while
Or you'll stay a while 
And we'll make it right 
Don't be afraid 
I know how to ease my pain
Oh oh oh oh oh
