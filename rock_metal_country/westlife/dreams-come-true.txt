Dreams are there to show you the way
Better take a look inside
Close your eyes find out what they're trying to say
You gotta take a look inside

Only for a minute
Just to make a start
Imagine what you wanna see

Wake him up the wizard
Sleeping in your heart
Just imagine what you wanna be
Don't you know that...

[Chorus]
Dreams come true they do
Dreams come true
From all of us to all of you they do

Don't you know that dreams come true
Love is just a second away
Better take a look inside
Make that magic rule, let the miracle stay
You gotta take a look inside

Only for a minute
It's not a fantasy
Just imagine what you wanna be

Don't you know that...

[Chorus]
Don't you know that dreams come true
Don't you know that dreams come true
Only for a minute
You can make your dreams come true
