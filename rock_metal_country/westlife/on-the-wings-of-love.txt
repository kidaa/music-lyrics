[Shane:]
It's good to know
I'll have your love,
Which ever way the wind blows
A guiding light
That will shine on
Through the darkest night

[Mark:]
When the world seems like its full of strangers full of strangers
And I feel as if I've lost my way

You lift me up on the wings of love
Taking me higher still with every touch
Whenever I'm weak, honey
You take me there again
On the wings of love

[Shane:]
It's all I need
When you hold me
And whisper tenderly
That I'm the one
You'll love forever forever
What else could I want

[Mark:]
In life where we all go through changes 
And when the dreams I have, been swept away

You lift me up on the wings of love
Taking me higher still with every touch
Whenever I'm weak, honey
You take me there again
On the wings of love

Oh

I'm flying high
Its all I need when you hold me close and you whisper tenderly
Up on the wings of love
Higher still with every touch
Whenever I'm weak, honey
You take me there again
On the wings of love

Oh

You lift me up on the wings of love on the wings of love
Higher still with every touch Higher still with every touch
Whenever I'm weak, honey
You take me there again
On the wings of love
On the wings of love
