Good things, good things 
That bad girls do 

Bra top, tank top 
Doesn't really matter cause they're all so hot 
I'm going loco in Puerto Rico 
Dark hair, tanned skin 
Skating on the beach, playin' innocent 
They drive me crazy in Miami 
They know, how to, make me 
Want it, crave it, need it 
I love how they tease me 

It's the good things that bad girls do 
That makes me want to sweat, feel them wet 
All over my body 
It's the good things that bad girls do 
Each city day or night 
They're so fine 
I'm going out my mind 

Good thing, good things 
That bad girls do 

Nice smile, so wild 
Every girl wants to get her party on 
They break all the rules, in Cancun 
So sweet, you need 
You constantly pinch yourself to believe 
The games that they play, down in L.A. 
They know, how to, make me 
Want it, crave it, need it 
I love how they work it 

It's the good things that bad girls do 
That makes me want to sweat, feel them wet 
All over my body 
It's the good things that bad girls do 
Each city day or night 
They're so fine 
I'm going out my mind 

London city and Madrid got some bad girls 
Mexico and Brazil got some bad girls 
Dublin City and Djakarta got some bad girls 
Stockhlom city and Berlin got some bad girls 
Kuala Lumpur and Miami got some bad girls 
Gotta really really love those bad girls 
Got a thing got a thing for the bad girls 
And the things they do 

Good thing, good thing 
That Bad girls do 

It's the good things that bad girls do 
That makes me want to sweat, feel them wet 
All over my body 
It's the good things that bad girls do 
Each city day or night 
They're so fine 
I'm going out my mind 

They know, how to, make me 
Want it, crave it, need it 
I love how they tease me 

It's the good things that bad girls do 
That makes me want to sweat, feel them wet 
All over my body 
It's the good things that bad girls do 
Each city day or night 
They're so fine 
I'm going out my mind
