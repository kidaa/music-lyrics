Pretty girls are all around
I'm looking up and down
'Till my view finder fins you in the sands
Zoom in 'til you fill the frame
You're driving me insane
And the way you're acting's telling me
You feel the same

Everything you do everything I see
The sunlight on your body is working for me
Take after take
Watching every move you make
There's only one thing that's missing

Picture me all over you
Picture you all over me
Baby you're that star in my private movie
You stealing the love scene
Right out of my dream
We see the sun come up
The violins are playing
Girl we're making love
In my private movie

Cut to a desert isle
Surrounded by the deep blue sea
Fade to a picture of your lips kissing me
Waves are crashing as out loves runs free
Let the rhythm take us from here to eternity

Oh baby can we make this real
Autograph my heart
'Cause you know how I feel
Let me know how you feel
'Cause you know it's true girl
You're me fantasy
There's only one thing missing

Since I saw your face
I've never been the same
Now it's only you I think of
Slow motion frame by frame

Picture me all over you
Picture you all over me
Baby you're the star
