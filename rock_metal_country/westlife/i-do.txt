Tell me can you feel my heart beat
Tell me as I kneel down at your feet
I knew there would come a time
When these two hearts would entwine
Just put your hand in mine
Forever

For so long I have been an island
Where no one could ever reach these shores
We've got a whole lifetime to share
And I'll always be there, darling this I swear
