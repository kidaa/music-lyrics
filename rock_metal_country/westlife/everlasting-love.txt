Every now and then I get a little bit cold
And I need somebody to hold me
I look at you and your body of gold
And I think oh why did she hurt me
Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do, yes I do 

Sometimes when I'm out at night I think of your smile
And your long slim beautiful body
Person that I used to find you're my perfect girl 
So come on babe why did you hurt me 

Why did you, hurt me, why did you, hurt me

Cos when you need somebody 'til the day that you die
And the everlasting love ...... 
Lie if I could and tell you what I would do
'Cos I need somebody to hold me 

Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do, yes I do

Every now and then I get a little bit cold
And I need somebody to hold me

I look at you and your body of gold 

And I think oh why did you hurt me

Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do, yes I do

Cos when you need somebody 'til the day that you die
And the everlasting love ...... 
Lie if I could and tell you what I would do
'Cos I need somebody to hold me 

Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do, yes I do
Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do, yes I do

It's E-V-E-R lasting love
Coming down on you from the heavens above
Let me bring it on down to you one time
I was meant to be yours you were meant to be mine
I'm speaking the truth ain't telling no lies

It's how I feel this ain't no disguise
So come on baby be my girl

What I've got's everlasting love

Cos when you need somebody 'til the day that you die
And the everlasting love ...... 
Lie if I could and tell you what I would do
'Cos I need somebody to hold me 

Cos when you need somebody 'til the day that you die
And the everlasting love ...... 
Lie if I could and tell you what I would do
'Cos I need somebody to hold me 

Need somebody 'til the day that you die....
