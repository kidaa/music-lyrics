[Shane:]
Life without taking chances
Is no kind of life at all
You've gotta stand up for something
Even if you might fall
Gotta take the road
Wherever it might go
No matter where, no matter what
I want you to know
I want you to know

[Chorus:]
I...
Tried to do my best
To do the best I could
I...
Had to give my all
It's what I had to do
And I'd...
Do it all again
And that's the honest truth
I...
I did it for you

[Mark:]
Maybe I was crazy
I guess I was sometimes
And maybe it's hard to chase this
But I had to know what's right
Everyday you've got to live
For what you believe
Please understand
I had no choice
It's what had to be
It's what had to be

[Chorus Shane]

[Shane:]
Oh,
And I had no choice, no
It was something that I believed
A dream that was driving me
A fire inside of me

[Chorus Shane]

[Shane:]
Oh
I...
I did it for you
I did it for you
