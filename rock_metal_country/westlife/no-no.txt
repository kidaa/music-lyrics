no no no no

Once,
we had it all for the taking,
love was just me and you,
You better think twice,
about the plans that you're making,
of splitting one word in two,

Put your mind in doubt,
did you ever think about,
everything that we're missing,
Don't you make me see,
what is best for me,
cause I just won't listen, baby

no no no no 
I don't need nobody,
anyone to take your place but you,
no no no no 
I just couldn't fall for anyone new,
nobody but you,

Girl,
you are the life that i'm living,
I just can't go on without you,
Let's make it alright,
wake up to what we've been given,
remember the things we've been through, 

Put your mind in doubt, 
did you ever think about, 
everything that we're missing,
Don't you make me see,
what is best for me,
cause I just won't listen, baby 

no no no no
I don't need nobody,
anyone to take your place but you,
no no no no 
I just couldn't fall for anyone new,
nobody but you, 

I can't imagine,
the two of us apart, 
Can't find a reason,
cause I still believe,
There's no one like you,
that is why I need, 
nobody but you,

don't need nobody, 
yeahhhhhh.........
To take your place but you, 
no no no no no no
Don't need nobody at all,
no no no no no no

no no no no 
I don't need nobody, 
don't need nobody
anyone could take your place but you,
no no no no 
I just couldn't fall for anyone new, 
no no no no
nobody but you,

no no no no no no
I don't need nobody,
no no no no no ,baby
I don't need nobody,
no no no no no no
I just couldn't fall for anyone new,
nobody but you
