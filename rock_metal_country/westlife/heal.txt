[Kian:]
Even though you're near me
I need you far away
To be an ocean
To build another way

[Bryan:]
I'll be broken
And I know it
But I just can't seem to find
Another way

[All:]
Though you want to
Though you try to
You can't stop the rain
For the first time
It's not you
Who can heal me

[Bryan:]
I need some distance
To find another road
It's not so easy
Sorrow, such a heavy load

[Nicky:]
I'll be broken
And I show it
But I'm gonna have to live
Without you here

[All:]
Though you want to
Though you try to
You can't stop the rain
For the first time
It's not you
Who can heal me

[Shane:]
Poets say
As time's a case
A broken souls were mend
But you would come around again
So my sorrow's gonna end

[Mark:]
But it's not you...
Heal me...
But it's not you...
Heal me...

[All Shane:]
Though you want to though you want to
Though you try to thought you try to
You can't stop the rain
For the first time
It's not you
Who can heal me

Though you want to though you want to
Though you try to thought you try to
You can't stop the rain
For the first time
It's not you
Who can heal me
Heal me
