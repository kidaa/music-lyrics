The way you say the things you do
The softness of the words you choose
The times that you can read my mind
And take my worries out of sight

Your fingers touching on my lips
And say a kiss is still a kiss 
And when you look at me I see 
I see the pain that you had to feel

You must've had a broken heart, to love me the way do
Must've been so torn apart, I can see it when I look at you
All the meaning that is in your eyes, the love you give will never die
And I knew right from the start, you must've had a broken heart

You seem to have that certain smile
I can't forget after a while
The day you walked into the room 
At once I knew the hurt that you'd been through

Sometimes when its late at night and I see your face in the fire light
Showing all the love you have for me, well I love you as much

Sometimes, sometimes
Must've had a broken heart
Yeah
All the meaning that is in your eyes, the love u give will never die
And I knew right from the start, you must've had a broken heart
Sometimes.....
