[Shane:]
I wanna thank you very much
Thank you for lending me love
Now I'm levitating
Cos I feel like I've been waiting
For a lifetime
For your touch

[Bryan:]
Now I'm 6 feet off the ground
And I may never come back down, yeah
Cos I still feel your kiss
It's on my lips
And I keep wishing
You come back around, oh

[All Bryan:]
When you came along...
When you came along
You know you save me from...
You know you save me from
Ordinary days...
Yeah!

[Bryan:]
You left me with your touch
So thank you very much!

[Shane:]
Oh yeah!
Thank you very much!

[Mark:]
I wanna thank you for this smile
But I don't say this much
It's usually not my style
I was sleeping and yesterday
You gave my world a shakin'
My eyes are open wide, oh

[All Bryan:]
Can't believe it's true...
I can't believe it's true
I've been kissing you...
Cos I've been kissing you
Now everything I do...
Everything comes...
Comes second to your touch
So thank you very much!

[Bryan:]
I wanna say...

[Shane:]
Thank you very much!

[Shane all:]
Good God
There I was
Then you came
Imagine my surprise!
Some say
Less is more
But I'm not sure
Cos I can't say goodbye
Some day
I may fall
But till that day
I'll be feeling high
So high
Yeah, yeah
Thank you very much!
I wanna thank you
For the love that you gave me
Cos it's all in your touch

[All Bryan:]
Can't believe it's true...
I don't believe it's true
I've been kissing you...
Cos I've been kissing you
Now everything I do...
Well everything comes...
Comes second to your touch
So thank you very much!

[Shane:]
One more time!
Thank you very much!
I got a feeling, girl
You can be my world
We were meant to be together
Can't you see it got me, oh yeah!

[All:]

Less is more
But I'm not sure
