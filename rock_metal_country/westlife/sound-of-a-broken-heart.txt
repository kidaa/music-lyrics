In so many ways I tried to reach you
And I don't know why I couldn't get through
When I tried so hard to break your guard
Didn't know it would leave this scar
Leave this scar
Now I've made it this far
And the pain isn't over
But the sun keeps on risin'
And I keep getting stronger

[Chorus:]
I never thought that I'd survive you
But I will be free
And there'll be so many nights I gotta get through
But now I see
You'll never be the end of me no
Cos when my world fell apart
And I didn't know where to start
I heard the sound of a broken heart
I still feel the pain
I heard the sound of a broken heart
It still beats the same

When will the world start spinnin'
And what happened to my happy ending
Learning what it takes, to turn this page
Didn't know how to walk away
Walk away
Now I've made it this far
And the pain isn't over
But the sun keeps on risin'
And I keep getting stronger

[Chorus]

And I won't stay down; I know my heart's still beating
Cos I hear the sound, tellin' me I'm alright
Tellin' me to move on

[Chorus]

Still feel the pain for you
Still beats the same [x2]
