Shane: 
As I walk this land of broken dreams, 
I have visions of many things, 
But happiness is just an illusion, 
Filled with sadness and confusion. 

All: 
What becomes of the broken hearted, 
Who had love that's now departed, 
I know I've got to find, 
Some kind of peace of mind, 
Maybe. 

Mark: 
Fruits of love, 
Grow all around, 
But for me they come a-tumblin' down, 
Every day heart aches grow a little stronger, 
I can't stand this pain much longer, 
I walk in shadows searching for light, 
Cold and alone no comfort in sight, 
Hoping and praying for someone to care, 
Always moving and going nowhere 

All: 
What becomes of the broken hearted, 
Who had love that's now departed, 
I know I've got to find, 
Some kind of peace of mind, 
Help me please 

Shane: 
I'm searching though I don't succeed, 
Someone's love there's a growing need, 
All is lost there's no place for beginning, 
All that's left is an unhappy ending 

All: 
Now what becomes of the broken hearted, 
Who had love that's now departed, 
I know I've got to find, 
Some kind of peace of mind, 
I'll be searching everywhere, 
Just to find someone to care, 
I'll be looking every day, 
I know I'm gonna find a way, 
Nothing's gonna stop me now, 
I'll find a way somehow. 

All: 
What becomes of the broken hearted, 
Who had love that's now departed, 
I know I've got to find, 
Some kind of peace of mind, 
Maybe, 
Oh yeah, 
What becomes of the broken hearted, 
Who had love that's now departed, 
What becomes of the broken hearted, 
Who had love that's now departed, 
What becomes of the broken hearted.
