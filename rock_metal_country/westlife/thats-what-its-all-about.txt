[All:]
I know it's all about you
It's all about me
Working it out, yeah
That's what it's all about

[Shane:]
Maybe I was wrong about it
Maybe you were right
I was selfish and demanding
Never satisfied
Oh and maybe I've made some mistakes before
But this time I'll get it right

[All:]
I know it's all about you
It's all about me
Working it out, yeah
That's what it's all about
It's all about love
It's all about trust
I know that you've got your doubts, yeah
That's what it's all, it's all about

[Shane:]
Yeah that's what it's really all about

[Mark:]
If I said I could live without you
That would be a lie
That would be a lie
I would surely die without you
How could I survive

Oh listen learn, blame it all on me
Cos you make me realise

[All:]
I know it's all about you
It's all about me Mark: me
Working it out, yeah
That's what it's all about
It's all about love
It's all about trust
I know that you've got your doubts, yeah
That's what it's all, it's all about

[Shane:]
In love you've gotta have some patience
No matter what the situation
When you know what's on your mind
Gotta follow the feelings inside

[Chorus:]
It's all about you
It's all about me
Working it out, yeah
That's what it's all about
It's all about love
It's all about trust
I know that you've got your doubts, yeah
That's what it's all, it's all about
All about you
All about me
That's what it's all about
All about love
All about trust

All about you
