It's like a storm against the window
Follow me around just like a shadow 
I'll swim a never-ending ocean
Until you bring back your devotion

It's like I live a thousand lifetimes
Still looking for the one that feels right
See, moving on just isn't working
You lit the fire that I'm burning

[Chorus]
And all I can do is protect it
A life for the sake of my pride
While all the others had me thinking 
we could be more than just amazng

I guess I'm holding on to my faith
A solid hope I'm heading your way
And crawling over is so tempting
We could be more than just amazing

[Chorus]
And all I can do is protect it
A life for the sake of my pride
While all the others had me thinking
We could be more than just amazing

[Bridge]
I couldn't see it
I must have believed a lie
If I admit it would you let me make it right
Is it all gone 
Oh no

[Chorus]
We could be more than just
we could be more than just amazing
And all I can do is protect it
A life for the sake of my pride
And all the others had me thinking
We could be more than just amazing

[Chorus]
And all I can do is protect it
A life for the sake of my pride
While all the others had me thinking
straight to the point of what I'm feeling
Oh we could be more than just amazing
