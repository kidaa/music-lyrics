Oh the shark, Babe, has such teeth, dear
And he shows them pearly white
Just a jack knife has old MacHeath, dear
And he keeps it out of sight

You know when the shark bites with his teeth, babe
Scarlet billows start to spread
Fancy gloves though wears old MacHeath, dear
So there's never, never a trace of red

Now, on the sidewalk, sunday morning
Lies a body, just oozing life
Someone's sneaking round the corner
Could that someone mack the knife?

There's a tug boat down by the river, don't you know
A cement bag's dropping down
Oh, that cement is just for the weight, dear
Five'll get you ten, old Macky's back in town

Did you hear about Louie miller? He disappeared, babe
After drawing out, all his hard earned cash
And now MacHeath spends like a sailor
Could it be our boy's done something rash?

Now jenny diver, ho ho, yeah Sukey tawdry,
Ooh Ms Lotte Lenya and old Lucy Brown
Oh the line forms on the right, babe
Now that mack is back in town

Ahh I said Jenny Diver, whoa Sukey Tawdry
Look out Miss Lotte Lenya and old Lucy Brown
Yes, that line forms on the right, babe
Now that Macky's back in town

Look out old Macky is back!!
