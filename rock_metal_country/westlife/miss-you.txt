I can't sleep,
I just can't breathe,
when your shadow is all over me baby,
Don't wanna be,
a fool in your eyes,
Cause what we had was built on lies, 

And when our love seems to fade away, 
Listen to me hear what I say, 

I don't wanna feel, 
the way that i do,
I just wanna be,
right here with you,
I don't wanna see, 
see us apart, 
I just wanna say it straight from my heart, 
I miss you.....

What would it take,
for you to see,
To make you understand, 
that i'll always believe, always believe
You and i,
can make it through,
And i still know, 
I can't get over you, 

Cause when our love seems to fade away,
Listen to me hear what I say,

I don't wanna feel,
the way that I do, 
I just wanna be, 
right here with you, 
I don't wanna see, 
see us apart,see us apart 
I just wanna say it straight from my heart, 
oh baby i miss you, 
i do...

Cause when our love always fades away, 
Listen to me hear what I say,

I don't wanna feel,
the way that i do,
I just wanna be,
right here with you,
I don't wanna see, 
see us apart, oh no ,see us apart
I just wanna say it straight from my heart, 
I miss you, i miss you,
i do...

I don't wanna feel, 
the way that I do, the way that i do
I just wanna be, just wanna be
right here with you, right here with you
I don't wanna see, don't wanna see
See us apart,see us apart oh baby
I just wanna say it straight from my heart 
oh baby i miss you, 
i do...
