In your eyes, I found the greatest price
You and I could not be closer
And in your arms, is everything I want
Now I know my search is over

and I don't know where you take me
But it's exactly where I wanna be

[Chorus:]
it's where the stars line up
It's where the ocean's touch
It's in a place I've never been that feels like home
It's in the air right now
It's when you give your all, and give a little more
I've never been so sure, that's where you find love

People pass, and listen to us laugh
wishing that they had the same thing
And our friends they ask, how we made it last
I just smile and say the same thing

I'm not sure how we got here
baby I'm just glad that we got here

[Chorus:]
it's where the stars line up
It's where the ocean's touch
It's in a place I've never been that feels like home
It's in the air right now
It's when you give your all, and give a little more
I've never been so sure, that's where you find love
That's where you find love

It's where the stars line up
It's where the ocean's touch
It's in the place and everything that feels like home

It's in the air right now
It's when you give your all, and give a little more
I've never been this sure, that's where you find love

Find love
That's where you find love
