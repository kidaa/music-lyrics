[All:]
Until the end of time 
I'm longing for you 
And if you feel the same 
Then show me your love 
I'll give you everything that money can't buy 
And I'll promise I'll be right by your side 

[Shane:]
I imagine being wrapped up in your arms 
And feeling your heartbeat 
And I find myself longing to hold you close 
It's how I feel 
'Cause I've been through a lot these years 
And I have lost count of my tears, oh 

[All:]
Until the end of time 
I'm longing for you 
And if you feel the same 
Then show me your love 
I'll give you everything that money can't buy 
And I'll promise I'll be right by your side 

[Mark:]
'Till the end of time
oh yeah

[Shane:]
If only you could tell me what's on your mind 
And show how you feel 
And I wonder where you are heading this time 
And where you belong 

[Mark:]
'Cause I know that if you would be here 
I'll do anything 'cause my love is real 
And even though moments are sad 
I look in your eyes
And I know this will last, oh

[All:]
Until the end of time 
I'm longing for you 
And if you feel the same 
Then show me your love 
I'll give you everything that money can't buy 
And I'll promise I'll be right by your side 

[Mark:]
'Till the end of time

Until the end of time 
I'm longing for you 
And if you feel the same 
Then show me your love 
I'll give you everything that money can't buy 
And I'll promise I'll be right by you side 

[Mark:]
'Till the end of time

I'll give you everything that money can't buy 

[Mark:]
Things that money can't buy 
Things that money can't buy
