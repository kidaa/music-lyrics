If i die tonight,
I'd go with no regrets,
If it's in your arms,
I know that i was blessed,
And if your eyes,
are the last thing that i see,
Then i know the beauty heaven holds for me,

But if i make it through, 
If i live to see the day,
If i'm with you, 
I'll know just what to say,
the truth be told, 
Girl, you take my breath away,
every minute, every hour, every day,

Cause every moment,
we share together,
is even better, 
than the moment before,
If every day was, 
as good as today was,
then i can't wait until tomorrow comes,

A moment in time,
is all that's given you and me,
A moment in time, 
and it's something you should seize,
So i won't make,i won't make
the mistake of letting go, 
Everyday you're here,
i'm gonna let you know,

That every moment,
we share together,
is even better, 
than the moment before,
If every day was, 
as good as today was,
then i can't wait until tomorrow comes,

Each morning that i get up, 
each morning i'll wait,
I love you more than ever,
i love you more
So girl i'll never, 
go away, never stray,

So every moment,
we share together,
is even better, 
than the moment before,
If every day was,
as good as today was,
then i can't wait until tomorrow comes,

Every moment, 
we share together,
is even better, 
than the moment before,
If every day was, 
as good as today was,
then i can't wait until tomorrow comes,

I love, love, love the moments, 
oh yeah
Moments we share together,
I love, love, love the moments,
oh yeah
I pray they'd last forever,

I love, love, love the moments, 
oh yeah
Moments we share together,
I love, love, love the moments, 
oh yeah
I pray they'd last forever now..........
