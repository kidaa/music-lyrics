The day I was leaving 
I was feeling insecure 
I thought that I'd thrown away 
All of those days 
And what we had before 
And now I believe it 
After what you had to say 
I thought about every day 
In every way 
And this is what I'll say now baby 

You don't have to worry 
Cause everything's all right 
I know that you'll get me 
That you'll get me through the night 

When you come around 
You know you pick me up when I'm feeling down 
And I want you to know 
Baby how can I show 
Do I have to scream and shout 
When you come around 
You only have to smile and you knock me out 
But I'm here on the floor 
And I'm begging for more 
Baby that's what love's about 

There's so many reasons 
Why our love is guaranteed 
So many reasons why 
I can't hide 
Just what you mean to me 
So say what you're thinking 
While you're sitting next to me 
Let all your feelings show 
Just let me know 
Just how it's meant to be now baby 

You don't have to worry 
Cause everything's all right 
I know that you'll get me 
That you'll get me through the night 

When you come around 
You know you pick me up when I'm feeling down 
And I want you to know 
Baby how can I show 
Do I have to scream and shout 
When you come around 
You only have to smile and you knock me out 
But I'm here on the floor 
And I'm begging for more 
Baby that's what love's about 

You don't have to worry 
Cause everything's all right 
I know that you'll get me 
That you'll get me through the night 

When you come around 
You know you pick me up when I'm feeling down 
And I want you to know 
Baby how can I show 
Do I have to scream and shout 
When you come around 
You only have to smile and you knock me out 
But I'm here on the floor 
And I'm begging for more 
Baby that's what love's about
