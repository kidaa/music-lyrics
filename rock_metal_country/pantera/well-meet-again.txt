I walk the 
Streets of darkness 
Where hell awaits 
Guarded by the mystery 
Just beyond the gates 
Searching for the answer 
Every man must find 
Before eternity beckons 
I will make you mine 
GOODBYE MYSTERY 
GOODBYE PAIN 
GOODBYE LOVE 
WE'LL MEET AGAIN 
In another lifetime 
She'll take another man 
She's left me here to die
Its killing me again 
GOODBYE MYSTERY 
GOODBYE PAIN 
GOODBYE LOVE
