I see you runnin' 
You're gone 
A million miles away 
But you know I'm comin' 
Violence that 
Blows you into space 
And you think 
You're gonna get away 
Like you did before 
But you're the type 
I never feel sorry for, so 
FALL INTO MY DEATH TRAP 
FALL INTO MY DEATH TRAP 
Life's paranoia 
You're hiding in 
The dark all day 
At nite I call you 
Cause I know 
You're always wide awake 
So you never 
Sleep at all at nite 
Extermination 
Of you're wasted life 
So now I've got you 
You're cornered like a fool 
I terminate you 
Live by my golden rule 
Task complete 
And once again I've won 
Now I search 
For another victim to come 
I can't explain the sheer 
Thrill of it all 
Its such a chill 
To watch the meek just fall 
DEATH TRAP
DEATH TRAP
