Listen up good 
I got a lot to say 
I know what I want 
And I get my own way 
I call 'em as I see 'em 
I don't play by the book 
One dose of volume 
That's all it took 
I've seen it, I've done it 
I've heard it before 
Now it's my turn 
To settle the score 
I'll sing it, I'll shout it 
I'll say it again 
I don't care if they 
Never give in cause I'm 
PROUD TO BE LOUD 
PROUD TO BE LOUD 
YOU KNOW I'M PROUD 
PROUD TO BE LOUD 
Well I've alway believed 
In freedom of speech 
And i've always been the one 
Who practiced what I preached 
LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT 
I'll give you the choice 
But it'll snow in hell 
Before I lower my voice 
I live it, I breathe it 
I gotta have more 
It's full blast 
And this means war 
The power, the glory 
Its callin' my name 
I won't start to 
Play their game cause I'm 
PROUD TO BE LOUD 
PROUD TO BE LOUD 
I'M PROUD TO BE LOUD 
AND I'LL NEVER 
TURN IT DOWN AGAIN NO
PROUD TO BE LOUD 
PROUD TO BE LOUD 
I'M PROUD,
