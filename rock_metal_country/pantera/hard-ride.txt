You're in the danger zone 
You can't be left alone 
Your heart is 
In this for the ride 
But when it comes down to it 
You spoke your mind and you blew it 
I want you when I want 
And still I hear you say 
HARD RIDE WITH ME 
Its a matter of time before 
You fall down on your knees 
HARD RIDE STAY FREE 
Its a matter of time 
'fore its too late 
The pressure's building up 
You feel you've had enough 
So go now
AWAY
I'll lay it on the table 
You're feelin' so unstable 
I want to love you 
But you seem so far away
CHORUS 
And I don't even know your name
