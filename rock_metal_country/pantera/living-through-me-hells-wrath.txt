I cannot take the take, your condition was nod awake
A selfish cryer, boldface liar, robbing all of what
you could take in
Stabbed towards a death, a dirty smelling girl
Shit decisions, no provisions, filling veins with juice
of chaos
Chorus
Painted face, olive drab, swollen hole, empty bag, sunken eyes,
whining dog, it's times like this you should pray for never
I broke your fucking mold, then threw away the cast,
new religion and new provisions, it's amazing you're alive
Drop the needle and stop what you're changing into
Erase the end dissolving, disgrace is needed more
So I mended severed ties, through flesh we cauterized
the undeserving, sliming, writhing, I filled you up
with watered promise
Chorus2nd half
Spitting teeth, oral lust, alley fuck, angel dust, anal
whore, bleeding knees, it's times like this to pray for murder
Chorus #2
So now I've seen it all, Hells' wrath , no
man has greater glory, cause now you're living through me
So I'm done with saving you, a gift unto myself, a
tired savior, a wasted favor, and I'm lucky I'm alive
