In these times 
Of confusion and sin 
We must redeem 
Our human ways 
This force that 
Fights to live 
Will fight 
Till it dies 
And rise again 
To save the day 
WE ALL 
ROCK THE WORLD 
WE ALL 
ROCK THE WORLD 
The power grows 
To destroy 
This flag of hate 
That waves so 
High in the air 
We raise our fists 
In rebellion we stand 
Our hungry hearts 
Set the snare 
WE ALL 
ROCK THE WORLD 
WE ALL 
ROCK THE WORLD 
Ageless as time 
Change is revealed 
We will rock for you 
WE ALL 
ROCK THE WORLD 
WE ALL
