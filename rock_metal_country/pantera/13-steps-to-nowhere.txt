Whores
Your windows boarded up, your private lives exposed
The talk shows pump it up, lab rats diseased for show
We're doomed to use the slang, outbreak of drug roulette
A church burned to the ground, not even noticed yet
13 Steps To Nowhere
Whores
A backwards swastika, the black skin riddled in lead
A Nazi Gangster Jew, it beats a dog that's dead
It's in to use the slang, outbreak of gun roulette
The cross slants to the side, will prove the damnedest yet
13 Steps - Leads to nowhere
The backlash dislocates, an untimely reign of death
The wolf poked with the stick, awaits with cancerous breath
Leads to nowhere
Outsiders still suppose, there's Holy streets to roam
The truth should not surprise, your homes were built on lies
