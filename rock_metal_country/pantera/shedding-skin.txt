I don't want you to look at me while I'm shedding
Skin. I can't afford for you to see what's inside me.
I'd rather shoot myself than have you watch me. I
Feel you'd steal my skin to try and wear me.
I was betrayed, one more day of my short life. You were
Carried away. You had no shame. To suffocate my being.
I was me, but you weren't you. You were sticking to me like
a scab...so I peeled you away, and bled for days. Then
Stepped out of myself.
I'm shedding skin, changing within, I'm falling in.
Through swollen eyes, I dreamed you died, caught inside.
I'm shedding skin, spreading thin, severed stem.
I created the end, I'm killing a friend. I'm shedding my skin.
I don't think you belong in here, I feel I'm sick. Don't ask because
You know damn well where I've been. I've kept a simple
Woman through the thick and thin. But I've found the guts
to sever from my Siamese twin.
I throw you away. Everyday. A dead part of life. Strangling
back. Seething black. In between my longing for torture.
Blood on my face that came from your face. The mix
Of kissing and bleeding. I put you away. I shut you away.
I pissed you away. I threw you away.
I'm shedding skin, changing within, I'm falling in.
Through swollen eyes, I dreamed you died, caught inside.
I'm shedding skin, spreading thin, severed stem.
I created the end, I'm killing a friend. I'm shedding my skin.
You're fucking, and sucking. You're friendless. It's endless.
Your flower has soured. It's endless. You're friendless.
It's harder. And stronger. But no one's been inside you longer.
Or harder. Or deeper. To get you off, you need the fear.
It's never love. Bloody touch. Broken wrist. Needle rust.
Choking throat. Swallowed teeth. Head fuck. No peace.
I'm shedding my skin to peel you off of me.
You've got to love me.
Ornament. Shrunken head. Playtoy. Snake strike. Poisonous.
Syphillis. Drenched me. Soaked me.
I'm shedding my skin to drain you out of me.
You've got to hate me.
