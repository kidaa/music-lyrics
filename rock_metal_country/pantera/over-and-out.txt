Slaving for eternity 
Aiming for construction 
Wreckless crew abandon me 
Bringing on destruction 
Primal needs
Annoying ways 
INCAPACITATION
A legacy of submankind 
Who seem to rule this nation 
Out of touch with your life 
Can' t you see the signs 
For me to know 
Can you find out 
Read betwen the lines 
NO WAY OUT 
When the cat goes away 
OVER AND OUT 
The mice come out and play 
Unrelentless trilogy 
Asking to accept them 
Tempers flare 
Screams are heard 
To uphold the profession 
Time and time and times again 
I will not play your game 
I ask you once a billion times 
To keep your life the same 
NO WAY OUT 
When the cat goes away 
OVER AND OUT 
The mice come out and play 
NO WAY OUT 
The price that you must pay 
OVER AND OUT
