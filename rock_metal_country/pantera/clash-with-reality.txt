Sometimes I know
I feel untouchable
Drowning in life
Caught up in the accessible
Back down the ground
I hear the sound
there's no escape
The concrete cloud
Spilling on me
Drenching me with
Laymen's sins
I hear the sirens
From the back of me
I'm crashing face first
Into the glass eye
Clash with reality 
It rears it's ugly head
Clash with reality
The indescribable
Let the dogs lie
Where we sleep
Irrelevant theme
A situation and there's
Nothing but right
In kicks the door
Nobody moves
'Cause in walks the problem
Dictates your fate
Evicts, convicts
Who'll sign the writ of life?
This now becomes
Their morbid game
Who's piss poor excuse
Is this for a world?
It swells my hatred
Day by day
Clash with reality 
It rears it's ugly head
Clash with reality
The indescribable
Let the dogs lie
Where we sleep
Irrelevant theme
