Build an inner door, drop and then explore
You smoke your head on straight, then drink
Your woes away -
Some might not understand possession
Controls your head
Chorus
You recognize it, while some ignore it
Avoid the masses, you've got to belong to it
Belong to it... x2
Your music is your friend? But the roof
Above my head. So seriously I take the will
That never breaks
Some might not understand, possession
Beyond your hands...
Chorus - x2
Belong to it... x2
Mid
It's power and sin, and then you've got all the other habits
Whiskey and smoke
It's all that we could need, to plant the perfect
Seed, disembody me - yeah...
Chorus
Belong to it... x2
