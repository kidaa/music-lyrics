There is a place 
where every man who falls 
in battle surely will go 
and in this place 
lives a God 
who is their Lord 
one of knowledge 
who surely knows 
Eyes are burning brightly 
shining on into the night 
heads are falling 
valkyries calling 
back the men to fight 
for The Terrifier 
Magic Mystifier 
preparation for victory 
Mighty Oh! VALHALLA 
they're coming Home 
to VALHALLA 
Each day the valiant 
armies of the past 
would fight outside the hall 
then in the evening 
the vanquished would rise up 
with the victors 
and feast one and all 
Written on the runes 
the many tales of men of old 
ancient kings who ruled the land 
a thousand years ago 
prayed to The Terrifier 
Magic Mystifier 
for knowledge and Victory 
Mighty Oh! VALHALLA 
they're coming home to VALHALLA 
Come the final battle 
Odinn charges on his steed 
Fenrir's foe is thrusting home 
but it was not to be 
now The Terrifier 
Magic Mystifier 
Vanquished but he will live on 
Mighty Oh! In VALHALLA 
He's living on In VALHALLA 
VALHALLA!
