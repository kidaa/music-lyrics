The coach stands 
waiting just outside 
just in case the queen 
should want to take a ride 
but she stays 
safely locked away 
she knows the world outside 
can be so cold and grey 
DAUGHTERS OF THE QUEEN 
Come outside and Play 
Slip into the nighttime 
Before it slips away 
Her castle 
looms into the sky 
behind those walls 
you'll never see 
a fear fall from her eye 
she seems content 
to live her life all alone 
but locked inside 
those castle walls 
her heart has turned to stone 
DAUGHTERS OF THE QUEEN 
Come outside and Play 
Slip into the nighttime 
Before it slips away 
DAUGHTERS OF THE QUEEN 
Come let me hold your hand 
Isn't it about time 
You need to feel a man 
Today Her Majesty has gone 
in death's repose 
it's much too late 
she lies there all alone 
alas the dreams 
inside her heart 
sleep forever silent 
imprisoned by the dead 
DAUGHTERS OF THE QUEEN 
Come outside and Play 
Slip into the nighttime 
Before it gets too late
