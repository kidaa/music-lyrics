I am the lightning 
and the storm 
all hell broke loose 
on the night I was born 
a child of fire 
and burning flames 
look to the east 
and you'll see hence I came 
Might throw you into the darkness 
or save you by the light 
of the moon and stars 
ever shining 
celestial bodies burning bright 
burning bright 
I, I AM THE NIGHT 
I, I AM THE NIGHT 
I am the terror 
the beast at large 
heed my warning 
sound the alarm 
an endless shadow 
for daylight you pray 
lock your doors 
but you cannot get away 
Tender angels of mercy 
how they run from my sight 
eclipsed into darkness 
searching only for the light 
for the light 
for the light 
I, I AM THE NIGHT 
I, I AM THE NIGHT
