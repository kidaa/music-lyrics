Eliminate, the life decline...
I've paid the masters with blood and hunger
..And it's not for sale by any stretch.
It's like religion without a Bible
And the Dragon lives inside my mouth
And it speaks in tongues, the word...
Chorus
Hellbound - in Ft. Worth, Texas
Hellbound - Ft. Worth
Snakes, in Southern flames
To bring the thunder; the great decider
Would you believe in this or the ash?
I do believe it and it's taking over...
Accept
Chorus
Born to a world so young and proud
But over your head hangs a black cloud
Grow your hair and crawl inside yourself
Because there you cannot hide
Facing fears that you'll overcome and one
Of these years you know you've won
Chorus
