Love at first sight 
I caught a glimpse 
and I thought I'd try 
to win her love 
for my very own 
She's the kind 
that'll move on a dare 
she loves a thrill 
she'll take it anywhere 
but when you need her 
she won't be there 
won't be there 
she's never there 
She's got COME-ON EYES 
Happens every time 
Never givin' her love 
Only givin' you lies 
She'll put you thru hell 
No matter how hard you try 
She's got COME-ON EYES 
I can't win 
she drives me insane 
broken heart is 
the name of her game 
down on my knees 
beggin' to Please 
needin' her love 
All alone 
out on the street 
she was layin' me out 
knocked me off my feet 
she's always on my mind 
it's what I'm thinkin' of 
She's got COME-ON EYES 
Happens every time 
Never givin' her love 
Only givin' you lies 
She'll put you thru hell 
No matter how hard you try 
She's got COME-ON EYES
