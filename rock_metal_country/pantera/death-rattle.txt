Numbing rumble, countless medicine,
Depleted from years of abuse
Death rattle shaking
And there's no faking, undertaking
Pressure point, rigor mortis
Induce, grasp of poison hands
Death rattle shaking
From years of compulsive mistaking
Death rattle shakes x2
Disease of eyes, the addict blindfold, reduced to
The realms of death
Death rattle shaking
Accumulating life it's taking
Death rattle shakes x4
Mid
I've seen the end, and there is no light.
Like deadly snakes, death rattle shakes
Solo
Death rattle shakes x4
