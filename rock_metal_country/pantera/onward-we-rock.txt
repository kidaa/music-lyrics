Hungry and hunting 
passion and fire 
we're burning 
hot on the heels of death 
strength and suspicion 
armored with steel 
ready for action 
tonite we're out for the kill! 
ONWARD WE ROCK! 
Straight to the top 
ONWARD WE ROCK! 
Straight to the top 
Torture and trial 
under the gun 
wheels burnin' 
burnin' to be No.1 
dangerous warning 
backs to the wall 
smell the sweat 
the Pain, the thrill of it all! 
ONWARD WE ROCK! 
Straight to the top 
ONWARD WE ROCK! 
Straight to the top 
ONWARD WE ROCK! 
Straight to the top 
ONWARD WE ROCK! 
Straight to the top
