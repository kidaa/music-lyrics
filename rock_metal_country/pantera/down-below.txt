People runnin' 
In the street 
Lookin' for some 
Meat to eat 
Its in your 
Dirty magazines 
All across your 
TV screens 
Midnight Riders 
In the street 
Feel the fire 
Catch the heat 
YOU BETTER GO 
DOWN BELOW 
YOU BETTER GO 
DOWN BELOW 
See the ladies 
Of the night 
Built for speed 
To my delight 
I steal them 
In my limousine 
Hear them shout 
Hear them scream 
Its a dirty job 
But somebody's gotta do it
Scream
