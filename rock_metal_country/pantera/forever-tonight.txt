I've been waiting 
all my life 
for the moment 
to be right 

You and me 
tonite could be the night 
a love fantasy 
my heart keeps cryin' 

OOOOOOOOOO 
FOREVER TONITE 
OOOOOOOOOO 
FOREVER TONITE 
I wanna feel 
you in my arms 
I wanna love you till 
the emptiness is gone 
Take my hand 
Tonite could be the nite 
understand 
my heart is cryin' 
OOOOOOOOOO 
FOREVER TONITE 
OOOOOOOOOO 
FOREVER TONITE 
Tonite may 
never come again 
don't want to 
let this feelin' 
ever ever end 
You and me 
tonite could be the nite 
fall in love 
my heart keeps cryin' 
OOOOOOOOOO FOREVER TONITE OOOOOOOOOO FOREVER TONIGHT
