There's a place that I keep deep inside me
It can trigger my mind
All along I knew it has been with me
Since I was just a child
I just summon power within my soul
It has given me life, beyond life I take
Blame for my murderous problem my signature
Always reminds
It's a message in blood
It's your cryptic warning
Within the message in blood
Marks the years of pain,
And your godforsaken ending to life
I'm provoked into sick confrontations, brutal
Time after time, bed of nails, suffocation,
life's ending, slay in different designs
One mans misery is another mans mystery
No one cares to understand my
Demented means
Sticks and stones can break all your
brittle bones, epitaph written at your feet
It's a message in blood 
It's your cryptic warning
Within the message in blood
Marks the years of pain,
And your godforsaken ending to life
