Shot rings out 
hear somebody scream 
nightmare 
caught up in a fantasy 
tied up 
fear's workin' overtime 
wrecks my sanity 
lay down 
ear touched the floor 
telephone rings 
it's someone at the door 
it's alright 
just the paperboy 
hear with the magazines 
Can't you see I'm 
RIGHT ON THE EDGE 
On the verge 
Of going crazee 
My whole life's been livin' 
RIGHT ON THE EDGE 
Don't you try and stop me 
Life is drivin' me insane 
Lights out 
can't see a damn thing 
shot down 
eyes of a hurricane 
it's all wrong 
stumble outa bed 
reach for a cigarette 
busted 
runnin' in the dead of nite 
locked up 
back of a black and white 
too late 
gotta pay the price 
luck's runnin' out again 
Can't you see I'm 
RIGHT ON THE EDGE 
On the verge 
Of going crazee 
My whole life's been livin' 
RIGHT ON THE EDGE 
Don't you try and stop me 
Life is drivin' me insane 
I'M NOT CRAZEE!!!!!!!!
