From the moment I walked in the room
I knew what I was in for
Soft music, the smell of perfume
And that lacy little thing you wore
And by the way you're lookin' at me
It's lookin' like it's gonna be one of those

Crazy nights
One of those going out of our mind times
You always make it worth the wait
Baby, I've been going crazy all day
For one of those crazy nights

The moon is makin' shadows on the wall
Something in the air is calling
There's no need to say anything at all
Our hearts are doing all the talkin'
You make me feel so wild and free
I think I'd lose my sanity without those

Crazy nights
One of those going out of our mind times
You always make it worth the wait
Baby, I've been going crazy all day
For one of those crazy nights

One of those crazy nights
One of those going out of our mind times
You always make it worth the wait
Baby, I've been going crazy all day
For one of those crazy nights

One of those crazy nights
One of those crazy nights
