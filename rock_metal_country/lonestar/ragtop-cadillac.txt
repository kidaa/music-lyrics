I got a black book full of numbers
All the makings of a real hot summer
Radio cranked up a rockin'
A week's pay burning a hole in my pocket

I got everything I need, almost
Everything I need I'm this close
Everything I need wouldn't you know
The only thing I lack is you and a ragtop Cadillac

I got my new boots off of layaway
It's Friday night and I'm ready to play
It's full of quarters for the telephone 
A '65 chevy from a friend on loan

I got everything I need, almost
Everything I need I'm this close
Everything I need now wouldn't you know
The only thing I lack is you and a ragtop Cadillac

I got everything I need, almost
Everything I need I'm this close
Everything I need wouldn't you know
The only thing I lack is you and a ragtop Cadillac
You and a ragtop Cadillac
I need you and a ragtop Cadillac
