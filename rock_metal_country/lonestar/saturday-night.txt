S.A.T.U.R.D.A.Y.

I gotta get out of these overalls
They're throwin' a dance at the union hall
I just got paid so I got a little cash
I been workin' all week gonna have me a blast

Monday, Tuesday, Humpday Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Take up all of my life, and that ain't right
I get my rest on Sunday
But I have a little fun on Saturday night

S.A.T.U.R.D.A.Y. Saturday night

I'm gonna wash and wax my truck
I got a date with lady luck
She gonna wear her dancin' shoes
And we gonna get just a little footloose

Monday, Tuesday, Humpday Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Take up all of my life, and that ain't right
I get my rest on Sunday
Then I have a little fun on Saturday night

But me and my baby gonna party on you know that's right
Gonna find another place with a neon light
Can't go home it's Saturday night
