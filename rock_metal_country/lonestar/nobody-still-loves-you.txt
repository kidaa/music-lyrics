I heard from a friend who's seen you again
Out on a date at night
Romancin', slow dancin'
Holdin' on so tight
When they asked you about me
All you could say
He's nobody, he's nobody

Well nobody loves you
And nobody cares
And nobody wakes up when your not there
And no one can miss you the way that I do
Oh nobody, oh nobody still loves you

Out of sight, out of mind
You didn't waste anytime
Making me part of your past
And there's no stopping
You've forgotten this love I thought would last
I guess I was blind 'cause I can't see
How you could say,
I'm nobody, I'm nobody

Well nobody loves you
And nobody cares
And nobody wakes up when your not there
And no one can miss you the way that I do
Oh nobody, oh nobody still loves you

Well no one could miss you the way that I do
Oh nobody, oh nobody

Well nobody loves you
And nobody cares
Nobody loves you when your not there
Nobody loves you
Nobody loves you and nobody cares
Nobody cares
Nobody loves you when your not there
Nobody loves you
