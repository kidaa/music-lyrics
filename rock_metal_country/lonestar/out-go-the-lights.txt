See the moon and the stars, how they sparkle and shine
Baby all around us now
Headlights on the cars and bright neon signs
They illuminate this town
Then I see your face, look in your eyes
And before I realize

Out go the lights... beat goes the heart
Rush goes the blood, sendin' your love to every part
Baby when you look at me, the only thing I can see
Is the two of us makin' love, alone in the dark of the night
Out, out, out... out go the lights

The world is turnin' around, but the night is still young
And girl I want to take it slow
And let a candle burn down, 'till our bodies are one
Breathless in the afterglow
The way you look, the way this feels
I just can't wait until 
Out go the lights... beat goes the heart
Rush goes the blood, sendin' your love to every part
Baby when you look at me, the only thing I can see
Is the two of us makin' love, alone in the dark of the night
Out, out, out... out go the lights

The way you look, the way this feels
I just can't wait until

Out go the lights... beat goes the heart
Rush goes the blood, sendin' your love to every part
Baby when you look at me, the only thing I can see
Is the two of us makin' love, alone in the dark of the night
Out, out, out... out go the lights
