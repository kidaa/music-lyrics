I've got this dream that won't go away
When I close my eyes your there night and day
Baby whatever it takes I've gotta find you

Are you someone I know or that I'll meet by chance
Are you somewhere close or in a far away land
Across the ocean or burnin' sand, I've gotta find you

I've gotta find you
Don't care how long it takes
I know when I do it'll be worth the wait
With God as my witness and love as my guiding star
Maybe Miami on some sandy beach
New York City making waves on wall street
No matter where you are
I've gotta find you
I've gotta find you

You could be a checker at the grocery store
For all I know you're the girl next door
One thing I know for sure, I've gotta find you

You might be a waitress workin' your way through school
Or the anchor person on the six o'clock news
Only my heart knows who, I've gotta find you

I've gotta find you
Ddon't care how long it takes
I know when I do it'll be worth the wait
With God as my witness and love as my guiding star
Maybe Miami on some sandy beach
New York City making waves on wall street
No matter where you are
I've gotta find you
No matter where you are
I've gotta find you
I've gotta find you
