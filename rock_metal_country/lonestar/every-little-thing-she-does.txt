Ooh, when I see her in my tee shirt
Brushin' her teeth, dancin' to the radio
Ooh, her coffee and her kissin'
The way she looks at me, I hate to see her leave
But I sure love watchin' her go

Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
I keep fallin' in love with every single simple
Ordinary little thing she does

Ooh, paintin' on her toenails
Watchin' TV, got her mama on the telephone
Ooh, in a corner at a party
She puts down her drink, gives me a little wink
And says wait 'til I get you home

Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
I keep fallin' in love with every single simple
Ordinary little thing she does

Listenin' to her breathe, watchin' her when she sleeps
The bubbles in her bath, the funny little laugh
Oh yea, oh yea, oh yea

Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
I keep fallin' in love with every single simple
Ordinary little thing she does
