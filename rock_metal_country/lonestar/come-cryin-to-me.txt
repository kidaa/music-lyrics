I can see it in your eyes
You're livin' a troubled life
And you've been hurtin' more and more these days
You don't have to hide it
Don't even have to fight it
Baby all you have to do is just turn and walk away

When you're tired of it all
And tears need to fall
You back's to the wall 
Come cryin' to me
You don't have to be strong
You don't have to hold on
You've been there too long 
Come cryin' to me
I'll leave the living room light
Burning all night
No don't even pack 
Don't even look back
Baby come cryin' to me

You can get beyond this
All those empty promises
They don't have to hold you down no more
Nothin' to explain to me 
You don't even need a key
All you gotta do is knock and I'll unlock the door

When you're tired of it all
And tears need to fall
You back's to the wall 
Come cryin' to me
You don't have to be strong 
You don't have to hold on
You've been there too long 
Come cryin' to me
I'll leave the living room light 
Burning all night
No don't even pack 
Don't even look back
Baby come cryin' to me

I'll leave the living room light
Burning all night
No don't even pack
Don't even look back
Baby come cryin' to me
Baby come cryin' to me
Baby come cryin' to me
