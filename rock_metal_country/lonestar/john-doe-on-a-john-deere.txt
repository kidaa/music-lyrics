I drove a beat up tractor down a one lane road
Pick her up early and away we'd go
Down to the river by the edge of her daddy's farm
We used to lay in the shade of a cottonwood tree
Back of my mind I thought she'd be
The one who'd spend forever in my arms
She said there's gotta be more to life
I don't wanna be some farmer's wife

Don't want a John Doe on a John Deere
There's a whole lotta boys like you around here
I wanna hear love songs in my ear
Don't want a John Doe on a John Deere
Not a John Doe on a John Deere

Well she packed her things and left this town
And I kept working this rock hard ground
Wondering if she ever thought about me
Then she called collect from San Antone
Just to hear some news from home
She laughed about how good things used to be
This big city ain't good for me
I'll meet you down by the cottonwood tree

I need a John Doe on a John Deere
There ain't a lotta boys like you around here
I wanna hear love songs in my ear
I need a John Doe on a John Deere
Want a John Doe on a John Deere

I need a John Doe on a John Deere
There ain't a lotta boys like you around here
I wanna hear love songs in my ear
I need a John Doe on a John Deere
Want a John Doe on a John Deere
