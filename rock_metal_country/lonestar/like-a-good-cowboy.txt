Walking down the street in L.A.
Caught in the middle of a heat wave
Pass by the star of John Wayne
And I think to myself how times change

Now where the cattle once roamed
There's a Burger King and a peep show
We do everything from our cell phones
Ridin' in out steel broncos

Oh it's Dow Jones, hi, low, price of corn in Tokyo
Wild west neighborhood
It's quick draw credit cards, the world turns but in my heart
I'm ridin' down the range like a good, good, good, good cowboy

I do what I say and say what I mean
Try to get a grip on the American dream
Sunrise to Sunset Strip I'll be
Workin' to the bone just to try to have a voice
When Friday night comes I'm gonna turn up the noise
Like a good, good, good cowboy

Dollar don't go far these days
The new frontier is a freeway
5PM is a rat race
Even Eastwood moved to Monterey
Lean Cuisines, microwaves, silicone and cellophane
Aliens in Hollywood
Bright lights, big city, concrete nitty gritty
But I'm ridin' the range like a good, good, good, good cowboy 
I do what I say and say what I mean
Try to get a grip on the American dream
Sunrise to Sunset Strip I'll be
Workin' to the bone just to try to have a voice
When Friday night comes I'm gonna turn up the noise
Like a good, good, good cowboy
