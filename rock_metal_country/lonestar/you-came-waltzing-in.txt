Changing partners
And changing my mind
Anyone who got to close
Got left behind
Same song and dance
Night after night
Trying to hold out and holding on time

Then you came waltzing in
Like a wild west Texas wind
I swore I'd never fall again
Then you came waltzing in

Picking 'em up and spinning them around
Well it's hard to keep your feet on the ground
I made up my mind to leave love alone
And keep stepping lightly with a heart made of stone

Then you came waltzing in
Like a wild west Texas wind
I swore I'd never fall again
Then you came waltzing in

I swore I'd never fall again
Then you came waltzing in
