Well you say your daddy is a real cool dude and you keep no secrets from him
Well he knows you got a wild hair knows your kinda out there and knows about your crazy friends
And he done found out about the night you snuck out with the Cadillac keys
But darlin' does your daddy know about me

Well he knows you been skippin' them Sunday school meetings
He's heard how fast you drive
Knows you got an attitude seen your little tattoo but he lets all that slide
And I bet my boots that he think he knows you from A to Z
But darlin' does your daddy know about me

Well do you think he's got a clue about the things we've been doing underneath the moon and stars
And how the ground starts shakin' from the poundin' of our hearts
Yeah, like a good daddy should he's warned you about the wolves and told you about the birds and bees
But darlin' does your daddy know about me
