Joe Bob was as rough as they come and prone to blow his stack
Kenny Dean was in the suicide scene and sneakin' behind Joe's back
Sneakin' around with Joe's girl June she liked the boys in the band
And when they all got together on Saturday night it was easy to understand why

They called it Saturday night at the paradise knife and gun club
There's drinking and dancing to the music of Bobby Lee and The Blackjacks
It was Saturday night at the paradise knife and gun club
If you was looking for some trouble you could find it I guarantee

Now the owner of the place was a man named Jack and he wouldn't take talking back
He was married to a woman named Mae she took up the slack
He knocked ya out and she'd drag ya out and leave ya in the parking lot
And when you'd wake up in the mornin' with a busted head you're just happy that was all you got

Come Saturday night at the paradise knife and gun club
There's was drinking and dancing to the music of Bobby Lee and The Blackjacks
It was Saturday night at the paradise knife and gun club
If you was looking for some trouble you could find it I guarantee 

Well the night that Joe Bob found out that Kenny Dean was sneakin' around with June
He caught Bobby Lee in the band in the middle of an old Hank William's tune
Bobby Lee cried out your cheatin' heart that was just the spark it took
And when the fighting got started everybody took part and that whole damn building shook

Till the sheriff came out and he stopped the bout hauled everybody to jail
When the judge saw the blood and the chewed up ears he turned a whiter shade of pale
He said good God ya'll what's happened here somebody started World War III
Kenny Dean just grinned the best he could and said your Honor it seems to me like it was just another

Saturday night at the paradise knife and gun club
They was drinking and dancing to the music of Bobby Lee and The Blackjacks
It was Saturday night at the paradise knife and gun club
If you was looking for some trouble you could find it I guarantee

Saturday night at the paradise knife and gun club
They was drinking and dancing to the music of Bobby Lee and The Blackjacks
It was Saturday night at the paradise knife and gun club
If you was looking for some trouble you could find it I guarantee
Lord if you was looking for some trouble you could find it I guarantee
