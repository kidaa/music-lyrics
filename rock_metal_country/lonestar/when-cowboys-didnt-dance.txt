Seven hundred head of cattle on an old forgotten trail 
Six cowboys and one old man in another day of hell 
Chuckwagon lagging behind from the strain of a broken wheel 
The only thing to look forward to was a campfire and a meal 

Asleep beneath an open sky with just the stars above their heads 
A saddle for a pillow and some sagebrush for a bed 
Waking up tomorrow was merely done by chance 
Back when the west was wild and cowboys didn't dance 

When cowboys didn't dance 
Didn't wear designer shirts 
When their hearts were filled with memories 
Their bodies filled with hurt 
They would sit around the campfire and exchange a piercing glance 
Back when the west was really wild and cowboys didn't dance 

More coffee from an old tin cup, more sweat upon the brow 
Another day of chasing that same old lonely cow 
With every new horizon began a brand new day 
Thirteen hundred miles to go as they slowly made their way 
Across the plains of Texas and through the Colorado snow 
Final destination Blackfoot, Idaho 

When cowboys didn't dance 
Didn't wear designer shirts 
When their hearts were filled with memories 
Their bodies filled with hurt 
They would sit around the campfire and exchange a piercing glance 
Back when the west was really wild and cowboys didn't dance 

When cowboys didn't dance 
Didn't wear designer shirts 
When their hearts were filled with memories 
Their bodies filled with hurt 
They would sit around the campfire and exchange a piercing glance 
Back when the west was really wild and cowboys didn't dance 

Seven hundred head of cattle on an old forgotten trail 
Five cowboys and one old man in another day of hell
