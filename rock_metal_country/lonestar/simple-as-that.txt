Got us a situation
It don't need no explanation
It don't take a scientist
To figure out just what this is
Unlike the changing seasons
Love happens without reason

It's as simple as that
Two people meet it's destiny that they're together
It's as simple as that
I knew when I met you that this would last forever
It's as simple as that
And I can promise you that I will leave you never
I'm happy right where I'm at
It's as simple as that

It's how I feel when you call my name
It's holdin' hands in the pouring rain
A slow dance that never ends
The sweet sound of violins
And even when we're apart
You beat around in my heart

It's as simple as that
Two people meet it's destiny that they're together
It's as simple as that
I knew when I met you that this would last forever
It's as simple as that
And I can promise you that I will leave you never
I'm happy right where I'm at
It's as simple as that

It's as simple as that
Two people meet it's destiny that they're together
I knew when I met you that this would last forever
And I can promise you that I will leave you never
I'm happy right where I'm at
It's as simple as, it's as simple as that

It's as simple as that
It's as simple as that
It's as simple as that
