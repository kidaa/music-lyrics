Box speaker talkin' out a tune
Two for one on a blue lagoon
Another lost and found

Bartender takes another pass
Puts the salt on the rim of another glass
And he sits it down

I know every color of every neon sign
Flashing out a heartache in the back of my mind

Down at the lonely grill
Got nothing but time to kill at the end of everyday
I sit in a corner booth and do nothing but think of you
And the love we threw away
And I guess I always will
Down at the lonely grill

Sad-eyed waitress called Betty Lynn
Got her order pad and her ball-point pen
Said what'll it be

I said a tall glass of cold regret
A full order of loneliness
Like every night this week

I'll shoulder my pride and I drank it down
Another smoke filled evening with no fire to be found

Down at the lonely grill
Got nothing but time to kill at the end of everyday
I sit in a corner booth and do nothing but think of you
And the love we threw away
And I guess I always will
Down at the lonely grill
Lonely grill
I sit in a corner booth
And do nothing but think of you
And the love we threw away
And I guess I always will
Down at the lonely grill
Lonely grill
Down at the lonely grill
Down at the lonely grill
Down at the lonely grill
At the lonely grill
