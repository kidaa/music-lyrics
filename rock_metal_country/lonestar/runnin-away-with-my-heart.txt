Hey Buddy can you get me some faster wheels
I got a heartache nippin' at my heels
I'll be hurtin' if she gets a big head start
First that girl stole my attention
Not to mention all my affection
Now she's running away with my heart

I don't know where she's bound
But I aim to be there when the sun goes down
Do a little catchin' up in the dark
When we're out there under the moonlight
Even when I'm holdin' her tight
She's running away with my heart

No don't tell me 'bout the speed limit
I'll go a million miles a minute
Till I run the wheels right off of this car
I know exactly what I'd be losin'
That's why I'm doin' what I'm doin'
She's running away with my heart

I don't know where she's bound
But I aim to be there when the sun goes down
Do a little catchin' up in the dark
When we're out there under the moonlight
Even when I'm holdin' her tight
She's running away with my heart
She's running away with my heart
