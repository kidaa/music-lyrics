You say I'm aggressive, too possessive
It's too soon, too much
You want to wait around, slow it down, but I'm burnin' up
What can I do to get through to you, I know that you're the one
'Cause there's no controllin' this emotion, it's bigger than us

You don't know what love is
If you think that I can fight this feeling
Keep my true heart from revealing
Everything inside
You don't know what love is
If you hear me say your mine forever
Feel our two hearts beat together
And think you can resist
You don't know what love is

It's soft and gentle, it's sentimental
Can't you feel it too
There's no denyin' or compromising, it's perfectly true
It's overpowering, it's all around me when I'm around you

You don't know what love is
If you think that I can fight this feeling
Keep my true heart from revealing
Everything inside
You don't know what love is
If you hear me say your mine forever
Feel our two hearts beat together
And think you can resist
You don't know what love is

I see you smile and girl I'm sure I've found it
Heaven knows there's just no doubt about it now

You don't know what love is
If you think that I can fight this feeling
Keep my true heart from revealing
Everything inside
You don't know what love is
If you hear me say your mine forever
Feel our two hearts beat together
And think you can resist
You don't know what love is
You don't know what love is
You don't know what love is
You don't know what love is
