Talk about a sweet situation
Girl you've got me in one
You can lock me in your heart
And throw away the key
We can get a little fire going
Let burn it all night

'Cause I love the way you do that
It makes me want you so bad
And baby you can do that
Anytime at all
Fingers on my skin
Your doing it again
I love the way you do that, do that

If you doubt my love and affection
Girl I'm gonna show you
I ain't holdin' anything back
You can have it all
You're wrapping me around you finger
And I don't want you to stop

'Cause I love the way you do that
It makes me want you so bad
And baby you can do that
Anytime at all
Fingers on my skin
You're doing it again
I love the way you do that, do that

Well I can see it in your eyes
You can probably read my mind
Oh you know just exactly what I want

I love the way you do that
It makes me want you so bad
And baby you can do that
Anytime at all
Fingers on my skin
You're doing it again
I love the way you do that, do that

I love the way you do that
It makes me want you so bad
And baby you can do that
Anytime at all
Fingers on my skin
You're doing it again
I love the way you do that, do that

I love the way you do that
It makes me want you so bad
And baby you can do that
Anytime at all
Fingers on my skin
You're doing it again
