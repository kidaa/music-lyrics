I can see why you think you belong to me
I never tried to make you think or make you see one thing for yourself
But now your off with someone else and I'm alone
You see I thought that I might keep you for my own

Amie, what you wanna do
I think I could stay with you
For a while maybe longer if I do

Don't you think the time was right for us to find
All the things we thought weren't proper could be right in time
And can't you see which way we should turn together or alone
I can never see what's right or what is wrong
Don't you take too long to tell me

Amie, what you wanna do
I think I could stay with you
For a while maybe longer if I do

Amie, what you wanna do
I think I could stay with you
For a while maybe longer if I do

Now just come to what you want you've had your way
And all the things you thought before just faded into gray
And you can say that I don't know if it's you or if it's me
If it's one of us I'm sure we both will see
Won't you look at me and tell me

Amie, what you wanna do
I think I could stay with you
For a while maybe longer if I do

Amie, what you wanna do
I think I could stay with you
For a while maybe longer if I do
