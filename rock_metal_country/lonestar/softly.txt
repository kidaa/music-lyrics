I remember that kiss in a cold world, oh girl 
Sunlight fell from your lips, tenderly you shattered me 
Somehow you touched me like no one else 
Slipped into my soul like a prayer 

Baby, with the sweetest kiss 
You came along and stole my breath 
Tore down my defenses with a whisper 
Oh you showed me how love can be 
You broke through to my heart 
Softly, baby softly 

You're like God in this world, fragile, beautiful 
There's so much trust in your eyes, they make me remember blue 
Skies and sunshine 
I wanna be what you see in me 
I wanna love you the way you love me 

Baby, with the sweetest kiss 
You came along and stole my breath 
Tear down my defenses with a whisper 
Oh you show me how love can be 
You break through to my heart 
Softly

I don't wanna be that strong if it means being alone 
I wanna stay with you where I belong 
And let you show me just how good love can be 
You break through to my heart 
Softly, baby softly 
Softly, baby softly
