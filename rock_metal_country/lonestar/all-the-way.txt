Hey, we're walkin' through this together
And I'm holdin' onto you
Nothin' can separate
This little twist of fate
You're the one my heart belongs to
Nothin's quite as sweet as the journey
So let's go around the world
Takin' in everything no matter what life brings
We're gonna be chasin' forever

All the way
To the end
All my life
And back again
Every day
I'll be here
Loving you
All through the years
And it's true
There's so much freedom in knowin'
How sure we are that we're goin'
All the way

People ask me think y'all can make it
And I tell them honestly
This ain't no fleeting thing
We're not imagining
This is it, we know it's meant to be
'Cause I love you, love you competely
I've never felt like this
I don't want nothin' but
Something that's passionatev 'Cause the only way I know how to love is

All the way
To the end
All my life
And back again
Every day
I'll be here
Loving you
All through the years
And it's true
There's so much freedom in knowin'
How sure we are that we're goin'
All the way

All the way
There's so much freedom in knowin'
How sure we are that we're goin'
All the way
All the way
All the way
All the way
