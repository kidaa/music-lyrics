Fire, smoke, bad joke 
That's what my life's been turned into 
Hurt, cry, pray to die 
That's all that I've got left to do 

Without you 
I feel my heart go up in flames 
Without you 
Nobody's here to see me cry 
Or wipe the teardrops from my eyes 
Without you 
I'm the only one I've got left 
And I can't live with myself 
Without you, oh without you 

Guilt, shame, I'm to blame 
For all the pain I put you through 
Cold, stoned, mind blown 
There's nothin' left for me to lose 

Without you 
I feel my heart go up in flames 
Without you 
Nobody's here to see me cry 
Or wipe the teardrops from my eyes 
Without you 
I'm the only one I've got left 
And I can't live with myself 
Without you, oh without you 

Time goes by 
Still, I'm 

Without you 
I feel my heart go up in flames 
Without you 
Nobody's here to see me cry 
Or wipe the teardrops from my eyes 
Without you 
I'm the only one I've got left 
And I can't live with myself 
Without you, oh without you
