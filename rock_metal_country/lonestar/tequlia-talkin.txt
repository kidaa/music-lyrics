I called about that conversation that I had with you last night
It must have been a combination of shooters and neon lights
And I didn't really mean to say I've been losing it since you left
Yeah I may have said the words, but they came from somewhere else

It was just the tequila talkin'
When I told you I'm still not over you
I get a little sentimental when I've had one or two
And that tear in my eye was the salt and the lime
Not the memory of you walkin'
If I said I'm still in love with you
It was just the tequila talkin'

I don't know what they put in Cuervo that got me to say those things
Usually I wouldn't care so much or make such a scene
But seeing you there in that dress you were wearing just drove me right out of my head
So don't hold me responsible for anything I might've said

It was just the tequila talkin'
When I told you I'm still not over you
I get a little sentimental when I've had one or two
And that tear in my eye was the salt and the lime
Not the memory of you walkin'
If I said I'm still in love with you
It was just the tequila talkin'
If I said I'm still in love with you
It was just the tequila talkin'
