Lotta people talkin' 'bout 
Givin' up and walkin' out 
These days 
Made up their minds don't want the hurt 
They're resigned not to do the work 
It takes 

Well whatever happened to hangin' on 
And goin' the extra mile 
Whatever happened to believin' 

Let's bring it back 
A true love that lasts 
Let's take a chance 
At spending a lifetime together 
In a slow dance 
In a deep trance 
In a romance 
Let's bring it back 

Used to be a simple thing 
All it took was a simple dream 
And love 
And when the ride got a little rough 
You'd buckle down, stick it out 
And rise above 

Well, whatever happened to knowin' 
That we kept the promise made 
Whatever happened to those days 
Let's bring it back 
A true love that lasts 
Let's take a chance 
At spending a lifetime together 
In a slow dance 
In a deep trance 
In a romance 
Let's bring it back 

The kissin', the laughin', the passion 
Let's bring it back 
That's what two hearts should have 

In a slow dance 
In a deep trance 
In a romance 
Let's bring it back 

In a slow dance 
All that romance 
Let's bring it back
