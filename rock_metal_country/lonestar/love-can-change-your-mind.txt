I've waited all of my life to find my destiny
Then like a sunrise appears, you came to me

I never knew it before that I could feel this way
I thought I'd lost my faith
But since you captured my heart
I can say, oh, that...

Love can change your mind, I know
Love can move your heart and soul
And just when you think
Hope has gone and left you behind
Love can change your mind

Picture it if you will, heaven right here on earth
Suddenly, everything's new
Now, I can see what believing was worth, oh, 'cause...

Love can change your mind, I know
Love can move your heart and soul
And just when you think
Hope has gone and left you behind
Love can change your mind

I was so lost and alone
I felt like my angels had flown away
But now my heart has come home
And I know that it's here to stay, oh, 'cause... 

Love can change your mind
And just when you think
Hope has gone and left you behind

Love can change your mind, I know
Love can move your heart and soul
And just when you think
Hope has gone and left you behind
Love can change your mind
