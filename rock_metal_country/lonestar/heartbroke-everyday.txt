Why do I do this to myself
Why do I want the one that wants somebody else
Don't you know
I'd get my heartbroke every day if I could

Why do I always take the fall
I'd rather have you hurtin' me than not have you at all
Don't you know
I'd get my heartbroke every day if I could
If I could
Don't you know
I'd get my heartbroke every day if I could

Another night out with the guys
Waiting for my heart to mend
Then you walk back in my life and it falls apart again

Ain't no doctor in this world
Gonna cure what's ailing me
I keep aching for you girl and it's such sweet misery

Why do I do this to myself
Why do I want the one that wants somebody else
Don't you know
I'd get my heartbroke every day if I could

If I could
Don't you know
I'd get my heartbroke every day if I could

Don't you know
I'd get my heartbroke every day if I could
Take it home son
I'd get my heartbroke every day
