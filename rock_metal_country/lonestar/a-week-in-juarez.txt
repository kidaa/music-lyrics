His name was Travis, hers was Vanessa
Two Texas kids from west of Odessa
Young love and lust defy rational thinkin'
They were hotter than an oil field on fire
When you're that young everything's crucial
You don't wait around for parental approval
So he asked the question and she answered yes
They jumped in his truck and tore out for Juarez

They had an informal wedding south of the border
Got a room with a view for three bucks and a quarter
On a Mexican night you don't care what might lie ahead
They had a wonderful week in Juarez

Now, when the bottom fell out of his chosen vocation
They were too broke to move to a greener location
Bills you can't pay put a strain on devotion
They decided to just call it quits
Well, it might have been luck or divine intervention
But on the way to the lawyer divorce wasn't mentioned
He said I still love you, she looked at him
And said I know a great way to start over again

They had an informal wedding south of the border
Got a room with a view for three bucks and a quarter
On a Mexican night you don't care what might lie ahead
They had a wonderful week in Juarez
