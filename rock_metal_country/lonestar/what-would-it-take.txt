I held the world in my arms
I threw away the moon for the stars
Couldn't see the forest for the trees
Couldn't see the love in front of me

What would it take to take me back
Rebuild that bridge, retrace my tracks
I would give all I own, for one little stepping stone
What would it take to take me back

I miss waking up with you there
Morning sun bouncing off your hair
And you all tangled up in silk and lace
A masterpiece no one can paint

What would it take to take me back
Rebuild that bridge, retrace my tracks
I would give all I own, for one little stepping stone
What would it take to take me back
Oh, what would it take to take me back
