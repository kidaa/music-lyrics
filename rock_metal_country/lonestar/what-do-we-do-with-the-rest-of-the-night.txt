We've been through enough tequila
To float us outta this place
And through the smoke I can barely see ya'
But I've memorized your face
We've danced almost every dance
Lasted longer then the band
Oh but we're not through
It's just me and you

What do we do with the rest of the night
We got all of this time on our hands
Hey a lot can go down 'fore the sun comes up
Between a woman and a man
No we don't have to worry 'bout the rest of our lives
But what do we do with the rest of the night

We can take this party down to the river
Lay a blanket on the grass
Watch the stars tangle up together
While the night slides past
We can do what we wanna do
Roll away that book of rules
We'll make our own
Hey nothing's carved in stone

What do we do with the rest of the night
We got all of this time on our hands
Hey a lot can go down 'fore the sun comes up
Between a woman and a man
No we don't have to worry 'bout the rest of our lives
But what do we do with the rest of the night

What do we do with the rest of the night
We got all of this time on our hands
Hey a lot can go down 'fore the sun comes up
Between a woman and a man
No we don't have to worry 'bout the rest of our lives
But what do we do with the rest of the night

What do we do with the rest of the night
