I see those other guys
I hear 'em tell you lies
That same old song they sing
They only want one thing
I know you're searching for
Something that's so much more
I wanna give it to ya

I wanna be the one
The one who makes you feel something real
The one and only one
The one who gets down deep - plays for keeps
I wanna be the one
The one who talks it through - listens to you
Please let me be the one
The one who truly knows you - just let me show you

I wanna make you see
The possibilty
Of all that we can be
For all eternity
And when you fall in love
Yeah, really fall in love
I wanna be the one

Girl you don't know me well
But someday time will tell
These dreams I promise you
You'll see them all come true
I'm talking band of gold
I'm talking soul to soul
And I ain't just talking baby... ooh

I wanna be the one
The one who makes you feel something real
The one and only one
The one who gets down deep - plays for keeps
I wanna be the one
The one who talks it through - listens to you
Please let me be the one
The one who truly knows you - just let me show you

And when you fall in love
Yeah, really fall in love
I wanna be the one
I wanna be the one - ooh let me be the one
