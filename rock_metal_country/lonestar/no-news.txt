She said "It's just a woman thing" and pulled out of the drive
I said not to worry I'm an understanding guy
I've heard that when you love someone you gotta let 'em go
She hollered "When I find myself you'll be the first to know"
Ooh no news

I learned to do the laundry, feed the cat, and clean the house
I promised to be patient while she worked her problems out
When she packed her bags, her destination wasn't clear
But I sensed that her intentions were honest and sincere
Ooh no news

She could telephone, tell a friend, tell a lie about where she's been
Send a pigeon, send a fax, write it on a post-it pad
Send a signal up in smoke, tap it out in Morse Code
I'd prefer a bad excuse to no news

Her mama's been a little vague as to her whereabouts
Her sister says "I'm certain your romance is headed south"
I don't have a single doubt that she's still in love
My level of anxiety is just a product of
Ooh no news

She could telephone, tell a friend, tell a lie about where she's been
Send a pigeon, send a fax, write it on a post-it pad
Send a signal up in smoke, tap it out in Morse Code
I'd prefer a bad excuse

She missed her bus, missed her plane, surely this can be explained
Lost her car at the mall, got locked in a bathroom stall
Joined the cult, joined the klan, on the road with Pearl Jam
Buried with The Grateful Dead, came back as a Parrot Head
Got derailed, got de-iced, offered as a sacrifice
FBI, CIA, if they've seen her they ain't saying
No news
Still no news
