Sideways, cockamamie
The idea is just a little too brainy
That a fine girl like you would
Bumpety-bump with a midnight fool
I took the fall in a neon minute
You were there and I feel right in it

Uh-oh, it just hit me
The rattlesnake if love done bit me
I'm goin' down, getting dizzy
Can't get enough of your kissy, kissy
No cure, I don't want one
Oh baby, this must be love

Lunchtime and I eat a sandwich
I think of you and the world starts to vanish
Call you up from a cell phone
Smack in the middle of a blasting zone
You get me so excited
I can't wait for my fuse to be lighted

Uh-oh, it just hit me
The rattlesnake if love done bit me
I'm goin' down, getting dizzy
Can't get enough of your kissy, kissy
No cure, I don't want one
Oh baby, this must be love

You got me lost in a wonderland
Love songs played by a marching band
Lips like roses, skin like cream
Please don't wake me from this dream

Uh-oh, it just hit me
The rattlesnake if love done bit me
I'm goin' down, getting dizzy
Can't get enough of your kissy, kissy
No cure, I don't want one
Oh baby, this must be love
