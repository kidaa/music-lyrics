Erupt again ignore the pill
And I won't let it show
Sacrifice the tortures
Orchestral tear cash-flow
Increase delete escape defeat
It's all that matters to you
Cotton case for an iron pill
Distorted eyes
when everything is clearly dying

Burn my knees and
Burn my knees and
Burn my knees and
E-motion sickness
Addict with no heroine
E-motion sickness
Distorted eyes
when everything is clearly dying

Burn my knees and
Burn my knees and pray
Burn my knees and
Burn my knees and pray
[All my friends say]
Get up get up get up get up
Get up get up get up
Won't you stop my pain

E-motion sickness
To idle with an idol
Addict with no heroine
Good things will pass
It helps with excess access
Lessons learnt

E-motion sickness
Lost no friendship
Corrosive head pollution
