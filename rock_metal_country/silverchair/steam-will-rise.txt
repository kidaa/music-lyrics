Contain yourself
I will compress
What I am to
Replace yourself
With what you have
Your substitute
Only wanted a piece of myself
Steam will rise
Esteem will rise
Steam will rise
Esteem will rise

Refrain, confess
Contain, repress
Pretend I'm dead
Abuse myself
Confuse myself
I won't be led

Only wanted a piece of myself
Only wanted a piece of myself
Only wanted a piece of myself
Steam will rise
Esteem will rise
Steam will rise
Esteem will rise
