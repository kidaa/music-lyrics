Lonely in life
Dead or alive
If the truth had incursions
No more goodbyes
No more big lies
If the truth had versions
As long as you and I are together
I'll hold onto the jewellery
Like staple strapped clenched fist and tongs  

Hang strung from an empty nest
Those thieving birds
Hang strung from an empty nest
