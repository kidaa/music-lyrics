I need to get out.
There's something wrong 'round here.
I have no doubt
We're all really down from fear

Everything's dark,
And I cannot find
What I've been looking for,
So I have to say I'm blind.

But he cannot see
But he cannot see
Yeah...

If you do
Shed a tear,
Don't come to my place because I,
I won't be here.

There's no love lost between you and me,
And that's the way that I like it.
I wanna live life like a normal man,
And I think I can, yeah.

But he cannot see.
Yeah, he cannot see, he's blind!
ohh...yeah...
ooh...fuck...yeah...alright...

I'm blind.
Ohh, I'm blind.
