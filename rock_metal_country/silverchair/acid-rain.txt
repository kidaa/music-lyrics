Falls down slowly,
Seeps into the ground,
Isn't just flowing water,
Won't stop until your brain is found.

Seeps into your little green eyes,
'til it meets your brain,
Runnin' through all of your brain cells,
'til it drives you insane.

Acid...Acid Rain

Falls down slowly,
Seeps into your mind,
Falls down slowly.
