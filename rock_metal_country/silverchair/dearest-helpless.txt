Dearest helpless
Intent's not as bad as the action
Take a breath to distort
The fear in your eyes
I don't mean it to hurt
But every time I hate you
I think of you first
He's made you blind
You're better on your own
I'm just the kind to bring you down

Equalize the pressure, it's all too much
Sex drugs and image is just enough
To get you by in the real world

He's made you blind
You're better on your own
I'm just the kind to bring you down

He's made you blind
I'm just the kind
To bring you, to bring you...
He's made you blind
You're better on your own
I'm just the kind
To bring you down
