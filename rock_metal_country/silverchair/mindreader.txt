I heard a hole in the silence
I saw a crack in the plan but I got lazy ways
You're not a private detective take off your telephone shoes
My thoughts going out of phase
And these are the better days

Still it seems funny
Sticking like honey
Wrote my own article
Now I'm hummin'
She takes pictures through my lazy eyes
And I'm dreamin' girl it's your money

When we're alone and out drivin' ourselves around all the bends
She's got crazy ways
And I'm all woo ooh

Don't know what you want
Don't know what you want
No I'm not a mind reader baby come on

Don't know what you want
Don't know what you want
No I'm not a mind reader baby

I got addictive dependent
I got a cold change of heart
But I got lazy ways
We're all woo ooh

Don't know what you want
Don't know what you want
No I'm not a mind reader baby come on

Don't know what you want
Don't know what you want
No I'm not a mind reader
Mind reader
Mind reader baby come on
