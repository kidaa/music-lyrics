Death becomes clearer through bloodshot eyes
As a death from old age becomes nearer
Why can't the livestock be free
When trading soldiers for steak

Learn to evolve with the new transition
To act upon a hypocritical vision
Descard the old - in with the new
Discard the old - in with the fashion

Learn to evolve with the new transition
To act upon a hypocritical vision
Learn to evolve, learn to, learn to evolve

Who's the bad guy Who's the bad guy
Who's the bad guy Who's the bad guy
Who's the bad guy Who's the bad guy
Who's the bad guy Who

Learn to evolve with the new transition
To act upon a hypocritical vision
Learn to evolve, learn to, learn to evolve

Bring on the ape farm
Demolish the monkeys
Drink up, drink up
Look down on junkies

A new hypocritical look and ambition
The time has come to make the decision you...
Drink up - drink up - look down
I'll hold it back. I hold it back

Discard the old - in with the fashion
Death becomes clearer through bloodshot eyes
Death becomes clearer through bloodshot eyes...
