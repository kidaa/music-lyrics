Welcome to the closing
Not for love what for
It's easy to be taken
But to say

Come again
Leave again
Waste of time
Come again

I'm all alone while you're having fun
You have faith while I feel none
Sleep till late to waste half the day
But I'm happy to live this way

And you know that you can't see my pain
But you know that I can see your pain

Me and shame are the same
Me and shame take the blame

Me and pain are the same
Me and shame take the blame

Welcome to the closing
