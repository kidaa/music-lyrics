Underneath the shelf cracks appear in thick enamel
In this laps excuse for wasting time
I wait for signals shooting stars
I'd scrape through every branch
Coz I need to come down

Underneath the home
I lived in I was a page in someone's book
And know one asked me why
The page was fifteen stories high
I'm underneath that home wondering why

All across the world
There are things we need to forget and forgive
Sometimes we have to try and shed the damage we don't need
Oh justice shake your head
I'm wasting my time

We can break this drought
Wanna tell ya I love ya I need ya in the night
Sometimes I get so full
I wanna tell ya I'm feeling alright
I'm shaken to the bone
And on my way home

Adjust an omen at the door
Singing baby wont you please get a hold without it
And while you sit there on the phone tell me baby
I'm a liar you don't seem to care what I care about and baby it's a shame
To be wasted

All across the world
There are things we need to forget and forgive
Sometimes we have to try and shed the damage we don't need
Oh justice shake your head
I'm on my way home
