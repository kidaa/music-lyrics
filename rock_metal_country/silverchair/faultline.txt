Unsuspecting brother doesn't know what to do,
When everything just falls to the ground, ohh.
He runs to find some cover, he doesn't have a clue,
That his friend will never be found,
When he's informed, that he...

Will never see the boy,
Will never see the boy,
Never see him open his eyes,
Will never see the boy,
Never see the boy
You'll only hear his heavenly cries
ooh, yeah.

Thinking of the past, it's all over now.
Mother nature strikes once again.
It happened all so fast, my only question's how,
How could they let that building descend.
Ohh, yeah, ohhhh...

You will never see the boy,
You will never see the boy,
You will never see him open his eyes,
You will never see the boy,
Never see the boy,
You'll only hear his heavenly cries.
ooh, yeah.

Off to the new life, I live on death.
You're leaving me all through the night.
If he's born again, I need you to find,
Need you to find where he is.
