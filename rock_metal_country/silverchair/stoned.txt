Sitting in my bedroom baby,
You know I'm spinning.
Haven't got much headroom,
But I'm only living.

When I'm like this,
I can only just sit,
Why did you get me into this shit,
Help me get out of it now.
I don't know what you will allow.

You've got me stoned,
Sitting in my bedroom spinning.
Stoned, yeah.

When is this feeling gonna wear away,
I know the Devil's looking up at me,
I hope this feeling's not gonna stay, never.
