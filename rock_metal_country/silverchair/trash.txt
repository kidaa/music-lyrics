One, two, three, four!

Welcome! Nothing short of anarchy
It's so hard to find out who you wanna be
Welcome! Nothing short of anarchy
It's so hard to find out who you wanna be - oh!

Go!

I couldn't find what you needed - ooh to be a double
A big pill but you know that you need a poison
Open, you need it but I returned the point of acceptance
How brave, your parades never do much

Violence!
Hopeless fight!
Call it straight!

Big black steel cap dealt rejection

Yeah, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Yay
Ugggh!
