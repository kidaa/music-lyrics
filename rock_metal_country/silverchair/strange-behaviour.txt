This is tearing me apart
If the sun won't shine
Forever will never be fine
Underneath the hollow ground
Lies a night time sky
For only a desperate eye

When I'm paranoid I see walls behind walls behind walls
When I'm over joyed I see falls over falls over falls
When I'm all alone I'll be wary and careful to
Only eat with uncles
Never talk to strangers
God is in the kitchen
Faking baby dangers  

Change whatever karma means
For the only things that end never truly begin
If this streets air ain't up to par
I'll take my clothes and take this strange behaviour
Not only liked but loved as well
If this streets air ain't up to par
I'll take my clothes and take this strange behaviour
Not only liked but loved as well

If this keeps tearing me apart
The walls come down won't stop this empty feeling
For everything apart from this
