Tomorrow will be another part of yesterday
And yesterday will be another part of the day before

Wait, I hear another song insomnia
About the days I wasn't tired
And doing that "fun retro look"

I stay awake for days
I stay awake for days
But I'd sit awake in daze anyway
I'm a maze of chains

Hey don't use the term accommodation
I won't be there for that and that will never be there for me

And I need to get some sleep slash resolution
About the days I wasn't tired
And doing that "fun retro thing"

I stay awake for days
I stay awake for days
But I'd sit awake in daze anyway
I'm a maze of chains

Over in the corner of a circle
I sleep behind this bedroom
I see "fun retro look"
Dine behind a suitcase in an empty room
It's time to leave millions behind
Hey that's what I took from retro look

I stay awake for days
I stay awake for days
But I'd sit awake in daze anyway
I'm a maze of chains
