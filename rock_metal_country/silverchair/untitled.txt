I'm just another body down
Internal bleeding round and round
And all I can think of are ways to die alone
And all I can think of are ways to die alone
A portrait of my skeletal gain
Left selfish and hungry so feed me the pain
Escape reality with new pain
Then let the cycle start again

And all I can think of are ways to die alone
And all I can think of are ways to die alone

Dream of content, a pain filtered farm
All I can say.......

Dreams are bad when all they do is leave the truth behind
Dreams are bad when negativity's a state of mind

Dreams are bad when all they do is leave the truth behind
Dreams are bad.
