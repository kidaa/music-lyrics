I live for yesterday,
No one cares or understands,
Don't feel pain, I'm made of steel,

I can't answer you,
If you ask me how I am 'cause I,
I don't know just how I feel.

I can feel oh...
Any pain you give me,
But I'll take it and throw it away.

I'm a hypocrite,
But that's O.K. 'cause I do like it,
But I am careful who I burn,
I am free falling,
With no parachute at all but,
I don't have any concerns.

I can feel,
Any pain you give me,
But I'll take it and throw it away,
I will kneel oh...
To any king you give me,
But I'll tell you what I'd say.

Why are you any better than anyone else
Why are you so good
Why are you any better than anyone else
Why are you so good

Why are you any better than anyone else
Why are you so good
Why are you any better than anyone else
Why are you so good
