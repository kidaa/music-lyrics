Suicide blonde 
Suicide blonde 
Suicide blonde 
Suicide blonde 
Suicide blonde 
Was the colour of her hair 
Like a cheap distraction 
For a new affair 
She knew it would finish 
Before it began 
Something tells me you lost the plan 

CHORUS 
You want to make her 
Suicide blonde 
Love devastation 
Suicide blonde 
You want to make her 
Suicide blonde 
Love devastation 
Suicide blonde 

She stripped to the beat 
But her clothes stay on 
White light everywhere 
But you can't see a thing 
Such a squeeze 
A mad sad moment 
Glory to you 
Glory to you 
Take me there 
Take me there 

Got some revelation 
Put into your hands 
Save you from your misery 
Like rain across the land 
Don't you see 
The colour of deception 
Turning your world around again 

CHORUS
