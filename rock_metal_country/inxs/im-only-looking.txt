I hear voices
Inside my head
Can I deceive
Can I believe
My whispering friends

What do I hear
About war and peace
What do I hear
About love and sex

I'm delirious
For an answer

Taking me deeper
And deeper in mind
I'm only looking

Fascination for
Limits of love
Should I aim higher
And higher and higher

Will I break you
Like some possession
To learn my lesson
