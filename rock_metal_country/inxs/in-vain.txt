Well just the other day
While alone in my room
I said to myself
I need something new
I've cut a new life slice
And feed the lions twice
And they'll shake their mains
In confusion

My love, my love's in vain
My love

Put a bet on everything
It'll come up fine
My fingers are crossed
And tapping in time
You got a pretty face
Such a pretty pretty face
You can brush your own mane
Fame is your pain

My love, my love's in vain
My love

Maybe an older woman will
Show me a way to
Ease those creases and
Crave no reason cause
Reasons are with gods
There's a heaven within me
But we all shake our manes
In confusion

Should I grab you by the collar
Or just go my way
With a knife between my
Clean white teeth
Don't want your feather in my cap
Don't care about that
You can fuck your own mane
Fame is your pain

My love, my love's in vain
My love
