Oh cherry
Oh cherry baby
Oh cherry
Oh cherry baby
Oh cherry
Oh cherry baby
Oh cherry
Oh cherry

I found you wanting
Like everyone
Always trying, happy lying
'Cos I'm no stranger to the ways of the world
I felt like crying
I felt like dying
We took a coffee, you took it so strong
Shaded from the neon
I could still see your eyes

Oh cherry
Oh cherry baby
Oh cherry
Oh cherry baby
Oh cherry
Oh cherry baby
Oh cherry
Oh cherry baby

Found in the gutter
With a knife in her back
Letter said sorry, please don't worry
She had a lover
With danger in his eyes
I tried to tell her
But she had the wildest heart

Show me, show me
Show me how
Show me, show me
Show me how
Oh cherry
Oh cherry baby
Oh cherry
Oh cherry baby
Oh cherry
Oh cherry baby
Oh cherry

Show me, show me
Show me how
Show me, show me
Show me how
Show me, show me
Show me how
Show me, show me
