Those pretty feet are stuck deep in the ground
All all that junk keeps coming
Must be the time to rearrange it all
Another place another time has called

She is rising above this world
She is heading for an open door
She is rising above this world
She is heading for an open door

Give it up, let her in
All she wants is to begin
Give it up, let her in
All she wants is to begin

One day he wakes up to a different drum
Rhythm coming from so far away
He had no time to tell anyone
His hips were moving to a perfect sway

He is rising above this world
He is heading for an open door
He is rising above this world
He is heading for an open door

Give it up, let him in
All he wants is to begin
Give it up, let him in
All he wants is to begin

Give it up, let her in
All she wants is to begin

She is rising above this world
She is heading for an open door

Give it up, let her in
All she wants is to begin
Give it up, let her in
All she wants is to begin

Give it up she is rising
Let him in he is rising
All he wants is to begin aIl I want is to begin

Give it up she is rising
Let him in he is rising
All he wants is to begin all he wants is to begin

She is rising
He is rising
All I want
All I want is to begin
She is rising
He is rising

Give it up
We are rising

She is rising
She is rising
