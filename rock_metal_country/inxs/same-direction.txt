There are few of us
Who will ever know
We're counting on every day
I'm not sure about
Why things are going this way
Believe it - you can see it

And we all just need the same thing
Tell you what I know
We're heading in the same direction
So never let it go

I will turn around
Try to understand
All of the feelings unsaid
If your serious
Love is dangerous
It changes my world everyday

Believe it - you can see it
