Dirty money
Washed rich
Suck my honey
It's a cinch

Use your delusions
To get ahead
I'm not faking
A single breath

You say these days are made of rust
Counted out
Counted out in loss
I've got plans to prove them wrong

I got manners
Like a comedy
If you push to hard baby
It's a thin veneer

Some of these days are made of rust
Counted out
Counted out in loss
I've got plans to prove them wrong

Got the new deal
It's like a wish
See me wanting
All of this

Use my delusions
To get ahead
I'm not faking
A single breath

You say these days are made of rust
Counted out
Counted out in loss
I've got plans to prove them wrong

You say these days are made of rust
Counted out
Counted out in loss
I've got plans to prove them wrong

You say these days are made of rust
Counted out
Counted out in loss
I've got plans to prove them wrong
