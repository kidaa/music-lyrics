Show me the way
Give away
The truth
I'm looking for

I need a new way
Out of here
The door
Is opening

Freedom take me deeper
Freedom take me deeper

All the blue days
Gone astray
The clouds
Are giving in

Freedom take me deeper
Freedom take me deeper

I need a new way
Out of here
The door is opening

I'm losing my fear
Suddenly
The way
Has come to me

Freedom take me deeper [till fade]
Freedom
