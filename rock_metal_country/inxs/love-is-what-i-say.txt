Food of love
They said

Smiling
You and I

He becomes
A man without
Qualities

What I say now
What I say now
I don't think we know each other
Enough to lie
Enough is enough anyway

This is
Food of love
They say
They got it wrong
Smiling
You and I
Thinking
Never say die

What I say now
What I say now
I don't think we know each other
Enough to lie
Enough is enough anyway

You and I
What I say
