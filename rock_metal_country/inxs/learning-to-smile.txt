Slow and easy is a dimension
Gonna laugh it up, laugh it up
They say you make no fool of you
An' it's new for you to gaze
Up and down inside yourself
Inside yourself

It's good in here
It's pretty far out
Yes, we're all just learning how to smile
We're looking out to you
We're looking out to you

Show your love, bite me now
Put a hand in and take it out
You can try to make me mad
Or change my mind, be careful
So you want me there now
So you want me there now

Barely moving I stagger - ha
Some interpretation
There's a buzzing in the station
Spinning station unravel me
Cross platforms with rehearsed travel
Rehearsed travel

Looking out to you
An were learning how to smile
