I

Want to want to sail a boat across the sea
Four winds four winds in the sails and in me

See

All the all the time I wasted from you
Got to got to get so closer to you

The

Navigation of desire in my heart
Leads me, leads me, cross the oceans from the far

Horizons

Ahead, ahead I can see your face now
So long so long I must say goodbye now

Of your

Looking looking for the buried treasure
Dig down dig down and find that buried

Love
