Natives wearing turquoise and silver
Dirty dogs barking in the distance
Ooooh people of a thousand tongues
I'm learning the primitive rights
I'm doing as the Roman's do

Mt Kalais to Mt Everest
Then down to river Ganges
Ooooh to follow your mighty past
We're learning the primitive rights
We're doing as the Roman's do

Old world new world
I know nothing
But I'll keep listening

City's tumble into the ocean
City's getting built in the sky
Ooooh now we're talking digital
We're learning the primitive rights
We're doing as the Roman's do

Millions playing at monopoly
Rolling the dice of their life
Ooooh dancing and shaking hands
We're learning the primitive rights
We're doing as the Roman's do

Old world new world
I know nothing
But I'll keep listening

I know nothing
Grow old look wise
Never knowing till I die
But I'll keep listening
I'll keep listening
