It's the way we walk down the road
Without the care for the good news
As the rain plays games with our feet
Well I do hope it's not too free

Everything's closed and I need a smoke
A serious habit treat it like a joke
Listen now let me get this straight
To be a man you need a fate

Watch the world go go
It'll spin till it stops
People gonna fly off
When they turn it off

You look strange when you're laughing
Uneasy with your moron's smile
Slow motion - see saw ride
My mind's not on it but you gotta try
