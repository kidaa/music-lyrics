The take down 
Is a mystery 
All I want to know is why 
Your eyes 
Taking over 
The apple in my eye 
I'm in 
A crowded room 
Can't hear a single word they say 
They're just talking faces 
I don't believe I know your name 

I smell you 
On my finger tips 
I hear you 
Whispering
I feel you 
All over me 
I'm never gonna be the same 

Whatcha
Trying to do to me 
Please tell me the rules of the game 
You see me 
Shaking right through 
No surprise 
I'm looking this way 

Deliver me 
From your spell 
Gimme gimme more of the same 
Deliver me 
From your spell 
Gimme more gimme more 
Gimme more of the same 

Deliver me 

Whatcha
Trying to do to me 
Please tell me the rules of the game 
'Cause I'm just 
Out of my skin 
But the thoughts and the questions remain 

Gimme more gimme more 
Gimme more of the same 

Gimme 

More of the same
