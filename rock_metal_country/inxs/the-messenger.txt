Look around
Give your eyes a new adventure
What you see
Is a mix of past and future

Your moment
Is coming now
Hold on / Hold on

How you gonna be when tell the story
Everything we took
Was it from each other

Hold on, come on

It's too late to get around it
Say goodbye to how we found it
This is what we least expected
Don't you put the blame on the messenger

It's too late to get around it
Say goodbye to how we found it
This is what we least expected
Don't you put the blame on the messenger

Hold on, hold on

I've seen the flames
That lick at survival
Check your dreams
Into the justice hotel

Your moment, is coming
Hold on, hold on

How you gonna be when tell the story
Everything we took
Was it from each other

Hold on, hold on

It's too late to get around it
Say goodbye to how we found it
This is what we least expected
Don't you put the blame on the messenger

It's too late to get around it
Say goodbye to how we found it
This is what we least expected
Don't you put the blame on the messenger

Hold on, hold on

How you gonna be when tell the story
Everything we took
Was it from each other

It's too late to get around it
Say goodbye to how we found it
This is what we least expected
Don't you put the blame on the messenger

Oh yeah, come on
