Shake shake shake it 
There's a monkey on my back 
Been there much too long 
Every time I kick it off 
Another one comes along 

Used to be in another world 
Used to be alone 
It's so hard to be yourself 
When you feel like something's wrong 

There are no words that could explain 
You gotta move on 
The strongest love in vain 
There are no words that could explain 
Ohh, you gotta move on 
The strongest love in vain 

She said, ``I had enough of your lies, 
not gonna wait for anyone.'' 

The beginnning of the end 
Don't you know that's all wrong 
When you say nothing changes 
You never say it won't take long 

Used to be in another world 
Used to be alone 
It's so hard to be yourself 
When you feel like something's wrong 
Move on! 

There are no words that could explain 
You gotta move on 
The strongest love in vain 
There are no words that could explain 
Ohh, you gotta move on 
The strongest love in vain 

There are no words that could explain 
You gotta move on 
The strongest love in vain 
There are no words that could explain 
Ohh, you gotta move on 
The strongest love in vain 
Move it! 

Move on! 

There's a question in my head 
Been there all night long 
Well I toss and turn inside my head 
But I won't let it tear me down 

Used to be in another world 
Used to be alone 

There are no words that could explain 
The strongest love in vain 
Ohhh, you gotta move on 
There are no words that could explain 
You gotta move on 
The strongest love in vain 
There are no words that could explain 
Ohh, you gotta move on 
The strongest love in vain 

Had enough? 
Gotta move on 

There are no words that could explain 
The strongest love in vain 
There are no words that could explain 
The strongest love in vain 
There are no words that could explain 
The strongest love in vain 
There are no words that could explain 
Gotta move on 
The strongest love in vain 
There are no words that could explain 
The strongest love in vain 
There are no words that could explain 
The strongest love in vain
