Put the red lights on
Don't tell them that you've gone
Leave behind your fears
You know they can't be wrong

Kill the pain you feel
Kill the pain you feel

I know you've seen some things
That buried you in your dreams
Your face
It tells the story
The pages stained with tears

You kill the pain you feel
You kill the pain you feel, darling

Keep the heart

Take the curtains down
The sun is what you found
It leads you far from here
And takes you to high ground

Kill the pain you feel
Kill the pain you feel

Find a way
Keep the heart
You have within
