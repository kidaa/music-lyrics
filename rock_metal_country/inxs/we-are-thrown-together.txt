I walk this mile
Like anyone
What could be found
In this sweet damaged smile

We are lost, we are found
We are thrown together

Would you take my hand
Would you take my hand

Let's go

I walk this mile
Like anyone
What could be found
In this sweet damaged smile

The cage is found
Fool's gold inside
Is there a key to the
Bars of the mind

We are lost, we are found
We are thrown together

Would you take my hand

You look for love
You just get skin
You turn around
And the changes begin

We are lost, we are found
We are thrown together

Would you take my hand

Takes a second for your world to change
Satisfaction's what you give away
Sucks you in and spits you out again
Picks you up and drives you down again

Takes a second for your world to change
Sucks you in and spits you out again
Throws you down and picks you up again
Satisfaction's what you give away

We are lost, we are found
We are thrown together

Would you take my hand
Would you take my hand
Would you take my hand
