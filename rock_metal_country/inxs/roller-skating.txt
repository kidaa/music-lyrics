I see a girl
She's roller skating
I don't know her
But she makes me feel
Like roller skating

If a had a chance at all
I'd build a road that never ends
Chinese envy - no damn waiting
I'll be with you roller skating

City lights
Turning green to red
I know I can't see you
All I want to do
Is take you to bed
