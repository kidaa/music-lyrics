I'm just a man
My will is so strong
When I've got plans
I close my eyes to the pain

My mother ran
My father left town
But we still have what's necessary to go on

Flesh and blood
Flesh and blood

I'm part of you
Your part of me
There's nothing said
That cannot be undone

My brother's sane
His heart is so strong
He's killed some pain
To himself nearly did the same

It washed away
Into the cruel sea
Like everything that's built upon the sand

Flesh and blood
Flesh and blood

Sweet sister T
She loved so long and hard
Kept to herself
Until that right man came along

Some men they lie
Some men they cheat
But now she's found
Someone to be as strong

I'm just a man
My will is so strong
When I've got plans
I close my eyes to the pain

My father ran flesh and blood
My mother left town
But we still have flesh and blood
What's necessary to go on

I'm part of you
Your part of me
