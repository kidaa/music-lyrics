We're all running fast tonight
Rocket shoes on our feet
There's a planet where it's right
I'm sure we'll get there
by next week

I could've been a doctor
I could've been a lawyer
I could've been a scientist
I could've been normal
Especially in the daylight

You say don't worry while in flight
The darkness is like a fog
I won't get scared
I won't get tired
I've been in space, so damn long

The earth is just a big blue dot
I can't see the cars and planes
There's a planet where it's right
I'm sure we'll get there
By next week
