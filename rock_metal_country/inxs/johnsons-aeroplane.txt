Four long lines one darker than the rest
Each one has a purpose, making borders on the land
Farmer's pride you know he works real hard
From a small aeroplane you can see the fields

Heart shaped hedges
Japanese gardens

Heart shaped hedges
Japanese gardens

Ah, ah, ah, ah
A place to work and grow
A place to work and grow

Ah, ah, ah, ah
A place to work and grow
A place to work and grow

Four long years one later than the rest
The animals are thin and the pastures dry
Farmer's pride if the weather doesn't lie
From a small aeroplane you can see the sea

Lot's of blue
Very deep blue

Ah, ah, ah, ah
A place to work and grow
A place to work and grow

Ah, ah, ah, ah
A place to work and grow
A place to work and grow

Johnson sees the fields from all the sides
Steel machines and black tar roads
Countryside where the spirit never dies
In his face all the history shows
Farmer's pride as the rains came down

Ah, ah, ah, ah
A place to work and grow
A place to work and grow

Ah, ah, ah, ah
A place to work and grow
A place to work and grow

Heart shaped hedges

Ah, ah, ah, ah
