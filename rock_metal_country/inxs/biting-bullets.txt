Don't you wonder
Is anyone that strong
It takes me under
Believing what I'm seeing
I get so tired
Of watching friends go down
The hungry tiger
For all who never began

Biting bullets
Biting the clouds
Biting bullets
Biting the clouds

I saw the show
Shaking all the babies
Should I believe
The parade of clever lies
Shadow of light
In the shadow of death
There is no difference
For all who never began

I loose myself like anybody else
But I'm not so strong to make it in the end
I need some answers when
The day comes crashing down
But it's all over when there's
No one to be found
