I will believe you
If you say it's true
Girl you know I need you more than any
Word spoken
I've seen you before
Turn and walk away
You say you won't come back
It's a game anyway

We are hoping - yes we are praying
This time will be the last time
That we will fight like this

We are always wanting
Things we cannot find
You know that we are always wasting
Time

You know I can forget
We have fought before
I've seen inside your heart
And I know it's breaking
