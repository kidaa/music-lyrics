And it comes down to this
When you take a look
Got to find a reason
Find it out
What the fuck it's about

All you lovers
Take a look around
Before they cut your roses down
All they've got is bones and blood
Don't they know that love is around

Make your way through the pain
You've got no one to blame
Put a rope around
Rush into the ground
All in the name of love

All you lovers
Take a look around
Before they cut your roses down
All they've got is bones and blood
Don't they know that love is around

You meet the devil within
And that's a name not a friend
Comes around knocking down doors
And when you let him in
Gonna burn again

All you lovers
Take a look around
Before they cut your roses down
All they've got is bones and blood
Don't they know that love is around

All you lovers
Take a look around
Before they cut your roses down
All they've got is bones and blood
Don't they know that love is not around
