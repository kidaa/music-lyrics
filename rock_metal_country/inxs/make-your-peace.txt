There are river's running
Just for you and me
In the darkest hours
Choices made to be
I choose to pull my punches
Don't you test my concience
You'll see
You'll see

Cut your teeth and make your peace
That's what you asked for

Cut your teeth and make your peace
That's what you asked for

Cut your teeth and make your peace
That's what you asked for

Cut your teeth and make your peace
That's what you asked for

Got a way of getting
What I want to see
When you know I'm winning
You'll get over me
All the trash your thinking
Don't you feel it sinking
You'll see
You'll see

Cut your teeth and make your peace
That's what you asked for

Cut your teeth and make your peace
That's what you asked for

Cut your teeth and make your peace
That's what you asked for

Cut your teeth and make your peace
That's what you asked for

All the bitter fighting
Makes no sense to me
Were only talking circles
Loosing sympathy
No time like the future
Make signs cause I need ya

There are river's running
Just for you and me
In the darkest hours
Choices made to be
I choose to pull my punches
Don't you test my concience
You'll see
You'll see

Cut your teeth and make your peace
That's what you asked for

Cut your teeth and make your peace
That's what you asked for
