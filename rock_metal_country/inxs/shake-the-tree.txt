I'd love to take this lying down
But the world we know has lost it's crown
All night talking jazz cigarettes
Is never gonna change this killer town

I see her walking
In perfect time
She gives me reason
To carry on

Round the corner comes salvations
Made to order is what you found
Why oh why do we fool ourselves
Is it just the need to carry on

I see her walking
In perfect time
She gives me reason
To carry on

Shake the tree you find
Shake don't cut it down

Glamour takes it's toll on you
You throw away what's out of view
Pearls of wisdom hang round your neck
They warm to the touch of your perfect skin

High, high, high
High, high, high

I see her walking
In perfect time
She gives me reason
To carry on

Shake the tree you find
Shake don't cut it down

Shake the tree you find
I see her walking in perfect time
Shake don't cut it down
She gives me reason
To carry on

I see her walking
In perfect time
She gives me reason
To never say die

I see her walking
In perfect time shake
She gives me reason the tree you find
To never say die

Shake the tree you find
