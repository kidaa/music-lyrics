Could be clear 
Black and white 
Make a decision 
Got a need inside and I don't know why 
It's a strong feeling that grows and grows 

One day my life is out the door 
Next day you show me what it's for 
One day I think I know myself 
Next day you leave me on the shelf 

New moment 
Goes like this 
Never forbidden 

There's nothing to stop 
The thief of time 
Stealing the hours that keep you away 

It rushes through my veins 
Straight to my head 
My mind is a planet 
For you to roam 

This is only just the start 
It's the beginning 

In this house I call home 
Living together
