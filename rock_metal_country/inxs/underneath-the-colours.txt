No division in the ranks 
The lines are long and proud 
No question on their lips 
But there will always be doubt 
Like a Chinese painting 
All red with its message 
A flag high in the sky 
Twists and turns its language 

Underneath the colours red blue white 
Catch a glimpse of others 
From the corner of your eye 

With the rise and fall 
Of the conductor's blind hand 
I play Russian Roulette 
I am an angry young man
