Say when you get down
Look to your left
Say when you get up
Look to your right
Figure out the puzzle
Make sure the pieces fit tight

Jumping around
all nite long
Jump and jump and
It's up to you

There is no sure fire
Way baybee
It's just the first star
You see at nite
Don't walk around feeling hazy
If you need a taste, take a bite
