I'm melting in the sun
And this is what they call the life
I suppose to much sun
Makes a desert Arab say

And I really love this country
There's a lot I wanna see

Great expectations
Of all we seem to be

And the winner
And the winner, the winner

Do you wanna make a story up
There's enough it always seems
If it happened in this morning
Tonight we'll see it on T.V

Great expectations
Of all we seem to be

Great expectations take a look around you
Of all we seem to be

And the winner
And the winner, the winner

She was twelve and knew the world
Her boyfriend knew a dance to this
Everybody's got advice
Take a snake, take a ladder

And this is what they call the life
I'm melting in the sun

Great expectations
Of all we seem to be

Great expectations take a look around you
Of all we seem to be

And the winner
And the winner, the winner
