White Light
Mission classified 
Neural Probe
Map your mind TARGET
Run the maze my loyal pet
Recall your orders and the rest forget
YOU ARE CLOSE
So close to the perfect crime
A human bullet in a chambered mind
An appetite for profanity
Everything you were made to be

Fracturing the pristine mind
Crack the shell and reach inside
Manipulating all we find to do or die

Conflict borne of man-machines
Solidifies our chosen scheme
It's so much more than what it seems behind your eyes

White Light
Falling Star
The you you knew is now the slave you are DANCING
To a dirge that sings within
A waltz of damage just beneath the skin
RHYTHMIC DEATH
Death tapped out by your puppet toes
Another current in the undertow
Below the waves we weave the curse
To drown the world, choke the earth 

Assembling the fractured mind
Puzzle equals suicide
Create the killer from inside
Some dreams must die
Slaughtering ability
Bred in you through trickery
Surrender blindly, slake our greed
And stain the skies

DOMINATE - Until we hear their cries
DOMINATE - While they believe our lies
DOMINATE - Salt and twist the knife
DOMINATE - Until the wound is ripe

Above theocracy we reign
Sharing death, bearing pain
In god's name all the heretics must die

Behind Democracy we rule
And Communists we use as tools
All the world's devoted to our crime
And still they trust their minds?
