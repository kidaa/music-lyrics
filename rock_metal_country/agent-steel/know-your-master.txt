Wake the dreamer
From sleep comes the secret held deep in the psyche
Restless vision
The pain of regaining the truth in the message
What we all are
Descendents of creatures so cruel and self serving
Infected again and again
Chorus:
KNOW YOUR MASTER
YOU'RE NOT EQUAL
KNOW YOUR MASTER
FACE YOUR FATHER
Beneath the ruins
Revealed before time might destroy all the remnants
Predecessors
Creators of space and lords of dimension
Godless fathers
Transcribing the answers
Written in mind and in body, in gene, the code that erodes with your humanity
The change is upon us
Arranged with the dawning
Revealed to us all
No escaping
Shape-shifting reptiles our fathers and true godz
Wait inside us
Dormant but fertile and aching to spawn
Once it's happened
It won't be reversed as the plan is the blueprint
Designed to decree by the powers that be that we hold in ourselves keys to their destiny
