Create the hate - Cause the cancer
Siphon life and paralyze

Enforce the peace - Give medication
Convincing man to compromise

A modern Christ - A new messiah
Born of war, from blackened sand

Anointed lord - By my disciples
Ten fists of nations I command

There'll be no golden future
Though they are trained to strive
Only enough to sate them, to keep the herd alive

[solo: JG]

Soon you shall know - I'll be revealed
You'll see the light behind my eyes

To touch the flame - To trust my presence
Make you feel safe inside my lies

And I'll speak the promise
And I'll bend your mind
And while I offer solace
I kill you from inside

Ten fists of hate - Ten tongues of lies
Rising child of Zion - when two suns shine in the sky

Thy Kingdom come by my command
Let the eye of Giza drive your souls into my hands
Ten fists of hate - Ten tongues of lies

My kingdom calling you - My will for all of you
Ten fists of nations call - I feel it dragging you down

[solo: BV, JG,BV]

And as the wealth of nations gather
And the cattle don their reins
In complete consolidation
A single move to end the game

With agony a symphony
With thunder at my hand
Send a Message to Our Fathers
That the earth is now in their command

And with no more hesitation
I let the comet fly
By my hand the earth awash with light
The End written in the sky

[solo: BV]

Ten fists of hate - Ten tongues of lies
Rising child of Zion - when two suns shine in the sky

Thy Kingdom come by my command
Let the eye of Giza shine:.
