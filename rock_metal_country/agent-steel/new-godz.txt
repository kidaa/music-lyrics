Tearing beneath your feet
Feel the ground split and crack and crumble beneath you
Calamity serves a nightmare
Never to wake from these dreams of destiny
Chorus:
All are buried
New earth's eyes turn black
Struggle to cling to your mind
Grasping at twines to hold your world together
Replacing the truth
Breathe in the proof
And pray your god is forever
Chorus:
All are silent 
Full with old dirt
All are stifled
Earth's hand turns to fist
Forget, erase, the monster you made and the hate that you save
In time, you'll find, you'll learn to grow in the new world
Ushering in the sun
Barren earth smiles and greets it's warmth with awareness
Gathering clouds, earth drinks the rain
And plans the birth of it's New Godz
Chorus:
All arising
Purged of sickness
Soil transcending
Cast fulfilling
All are present
Born of earth
New Godz
