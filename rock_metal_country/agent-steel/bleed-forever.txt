I hear a voice
It calls my name
It once was simple now the complications reign
I recognize
But I won't change
This coldness that you serve
Will only cause you pain
It isn't easy since I understand their ways
My hate endures, you waste your trust
We sit in silence and I turn my eyes away
I'd give anything for yesterday
I voice my anger
I voice our shame
We've poisoned all our lives
We've no one else to blame
We had our chance
To turn them away
We'll pay forever for our naivete
No need to speak
No need to say
Say goodbye, say goodbye
We'll pay forever
We'll bleed forever
