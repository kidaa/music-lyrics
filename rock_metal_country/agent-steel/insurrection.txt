Do they lie to you?
Are their fingers bloody?
If you asked questions would you feel the fool?

Mass acceptance 
Feeds the flame of propaganda
Do we trust them or are we their tools?

Painting pictures watch them
With their bloody fingers
Smear the message
in our supple minds

Are you sure you're thinking?
Are you sure you're seeing?
Would you know the truth?
And could you smell a lie?

Conscious - And the world is dreaming
The dream is death - The dream is death

Official words are spoken
Do you - do you hear the message?
Brace yourselves they say
So you try

When the time comes soon now
Will you wear their colors?
Will your blood spill for them or will you realize?

Conscious - And the world is dreaming
Freedom - Demands an equal price

I'll fight
I'll fight
In an Insurrection
You'll taste the steel of the back of my hand
I'm not dying slowly

I'll fight - I'll fight
In an Insurrection
None are free with a king in the land
I'll fight forever

[solo: JG, BV]

And the godz are sworn to treason
Let the battle rage until the world is free of chains
When the wicked fall may the clouds roar in triumph
And the lightning laugh as it basks in their shame 

I'll fight - I'll fight - For an Insurrection
I'll fight - I'll fight - For an Insurrection
