Rot in cages we crouch naked
Waiting for the rest to land
Extended faith they betrayed our friendship
Imprisoned us by our own hand
Time for us to wake and rise up
May be too late but we must attack
Either that or we'll know forever
We're born cowards and we can't fight back
Prodded punctured probed and tested
Is this the way man was born to live?
Bred like cattle and raised for slaughter
Without a soul we've nothing more to give
Chorus:
And the war begins from behind cages
Feed no more, rot, we're useless dead
The only way to win is to starve them
The way to win is to end our lives
Our sacrifice renders our flesh useless
Our death is life for the few outside
The future for these struggling rebels
Who gather armies for the final fight
Without strength our captors weaken
We do our best to do our best and die
