Spit out the fire. rage in the air 
Disciple of fate. the final hour 
HAMMERING METAL INTO YOUR HEADS 
Stepping before you 
Your hands on my bullet, 
Tongue on the flame 
Spewing the vision 
HAMMERING METAL INTO YOUR HEADS 
Bow of the cynic, whistle your fear 
Signals of warning, message from Space 
Shocking the Nations, exposing predictions 
Shattering dreams of grandeur's delusion, 
Walking the tightrope, never looking 
Back on the sorrows proceed to next flight 
SIGNALS OF WARNING MESSAGE FROM SPACE 
OUR HAMMERS ARE POUNDING INTO YOUR HEADS 
chorus  NOW WE MUST JOIN Forces and rage! 
 Disturbing the Scoffs, 
Neighborhoods fear, THE MERTAL ATTACK 
He's coming to town,  He is ... THE RAGER 
He will hunt you down, He isTHE RAGER 
He's coming to town,  He is ... THE RAGER 
A black rose he gives you if you're a betrayer 
Branded by metal He speaks what He wants to. 
PUT ON YOUR ARMOR AND HEAD INTO THE STREETS 
HAMMERING METAL INTO YOUR HERDS 
            Expensive his tastes, but nature of beast 
            Spontaneous lust He loves running wild 
He never forgets a name, or a face 
Denying conformists alive in the lights 
chorus  NOW WE MUST JOIN Forces and rage! 
 Disturbing the Scoffs, 
Neighborhoods fear, THE METAL ATTACK 
He's coming to town,  He is ... THE RAGER 
He will hunt you down, He isTHE RAGER 
He's coming to town,  He is ... THE RAGER
