They spit in your eye 
You'll never retreat 
You resist their attack 
We await the command 
Together we stand 
With mace In our hands 
The comet burns bright 
The Age is at hand... 
They'll kidnap your child 
Dishonor your creed 
You're clenching your fists 
Your hammer's up high... 
I'll finish the war 
And even the score ... 
Barbaric approach 
Their intent to destroy... 
Sweat drips from your 
Their kiss of Judas 
chorus DON'T GIVE IN NEVER SURRENDER 
DON'T GIVE IN NEVER SURRENDER 
As Orion burns 
All Race and Planets collide 
Through vengeance Command 
The troops drawing near... 
As destiny stands 
The tactics are clear 
Relinquish the fear 
The conquest is near 
The comet burns bright 
The Age is at hand... 
chorus DON'T GIVE IN NEVER SURRENDER 
DON'T GIVE IN NEVER SURRENDER 
harmony solo 
They spit in your eye 
You'll never retreat 
You resist their attack 
We await the command 
Together we stand 
With mace in our hands 
The comet burns bright 
The Age is at hand...
