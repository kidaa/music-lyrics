Our time keeps us measured
Not enough of the gifts we treasure
Can't stop we keep pushing forward
Stare straight through the future
Constant therefore unnerving
A secret worth preserving
Eyes shut won't end the madness
Or guarantee survival
Time, time Shut
Mouth shut but the words keep coming
Eyes shut yet we still march forward
Headlong
Chorus:
Into infinity
What lives beyond our vision
In this the eternal question
Though men claim to have the answer
I'm unsure of heaven
So trust what I see before me
Believe what is proven to me
Skies filled with our fathers watching
Waiting just beyond our time
Time, time Shut
Mouth shut but the words keep coming
Eyes shut yet we still march forward
Headlong
Into Infinity
When time no longer exists
When truth won't let you resist
When Godz are revealed unto you
Embrace them and call them father
Knowledge may be cruel and cold than
Better than your ignorance
Nothing can prepare you for your journey
Into Infinity
