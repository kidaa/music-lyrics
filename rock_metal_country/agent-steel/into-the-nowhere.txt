The god sighed and silence was born
A tortured life is spared of vision
And it's painful when it's worn
The cloak of shame spares no protection
His world is made of steel
In his hands he bent the fire
To mold a thing so real
A burning world born of desire
Chorus:
His hope was not enough
To fill an empty cup
He simply let it drain into the nowhere
There is no reckoning
There is no bargaining
In symbol rain will fall as he lays weeping
We stand below rinsed by the tears
Unlike rain they bring no healing
Rust corrodes the souls
Of children wrought to match his image
Abandoned with all of his cares 
No choice but to wait for the kindness of time
To erase us one and all
To flow like a river with no beginning
Head in hands and weary eyes
The failures scratch and carve the lines
Into the face of one
The lines into the face of none
He sees the world 
He sees his dreams
And nothing's ever as it seems
The promise was so real
Now all that's left is crumbled steel
No prayers are said in his name
Nobody knew that he ever existed
Alone he accepts all the blame
Plaintively wonders how dreams become twisted
And he waits for another to come
Another, a chance to revive from the nothing
The fabric to weave once again
To forge from the fire his vision of man
