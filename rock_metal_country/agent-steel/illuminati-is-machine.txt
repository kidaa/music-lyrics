ONE WORLD
NEW ORDER
Illuminati uses you
THEIR JURY
THEIR JUSTICE
But for the chosen few
Who is the great dictator
Who oils the grand machine
Who lubes the wheels of progress
With blood drawn from your veins
ONE WORLD
NEW ORDER
Illuminati poisons you 
NEW WORLD 
ONE ORDER
Notice?  Do you?
Satan gave himself a name
Mason, exposed controls the game
WHO'S REAPING
FROM RUIN
What is the master plan?
WON'T MATTER
NOT TO YOU
If you are just a man
You dragged the stones to Giza
But they built the pyramids
On your back shouldered greatness
Not you just what you did
YOU'RE REAPING
YOUR RUIN
This is the master's plan
TO USE YOU
DISCARD YOU
As he will every man
Satan named himself a place
Babylon known as the USA
Chorus:
Illuminati dominates
You build your place in hell
You're not aware that you create
Their paradise-your frozen cell
NEW WORLD
ONE ORDER
Illuminati is machine
YOUR WORTH
IN RUIN
You pave their streets with dreams
With trust you're made the victim
Atop mass graves they revel
Free mason buries you
Free mason buries you
