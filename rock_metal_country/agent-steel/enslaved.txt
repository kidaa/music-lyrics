They pray to the universe
To end all their misery
Caused by their ignorance
They pray to those who would be king

TO GODZ - We gave to men
TO GODZ - Who never were

Created by our council to divert their minds while remain on high
Observing their pain
All seeing eye
FATHERS OF HATE

Confused in a state of fear
A panicked mind, an endless tear
Suffer for our chosen children
SUFFER FOR THEIR POUND OF FLESH

The lie - KING OF KINGS
The lie - CRUCIFIED

A paper God attached to strings dances to the songs we sing on high
Demanding their shame
All seeing eye
Won't look away

We're here to remind you
YOU ARE ENSLAVED
You're chained to your fear
YOU ARE ENSLAVED
Though freedom surrounds you
YOU STAY OUR SLAVE
And we stay right here

[solo: BV]

As long as you follow the path you've been given
We'll reap the harvest of pain we have sown
Don't open your minds; don't ever ask questions
We'll gladly play games we have already won

[solo: JG]

Abused into servitude
You're weakened by your faithfulness
Cower as you're wont to do
BELIEVE THE LIE YOU THINK THE BEST

And die the death you've been prescribed
A victim by design you writhe and supplicate
Question not and seal your fate

The eye
Sees in your mind
All seeing eye
Never goes blind

We're here to remind you
YOU ARE ENSLAVED
You're chained to your fear
YOU ARE ENSLAVED
Though freedom surrounds you
YOU STAY OUR SLAVE
And we stay right here
