Seven bowls cast on the land
Sinners walk proud show their private lives
Depict deception the wrath is on
Kiss of a queen bite of a snake
Deadly poison venomous fate
Feeling down and out
Felling there is no doubt
Some will pay for this pain
Justice picks you out of the game
In the cup from the water is black
I can't believe you'd stab me in the back
Living life tomorrow you'll know
Hate and anger poured of your soul
Now it's time, time to begin
In the end the humble will win
Feeling up and proud
Feeling there is no doubt
No remorse I tried to explain
When I rise I'll come back to reign
I'll come back to reign
Seven bowls cast on the land
Sinners walk proud hand in hand
Painful sores show their private lives
Depict deception the wrath is on
Kiss of a queen bite of a snake
Deadly poison venomous fate
Feeling up and proud
Feeling there is no doubt
No remorse I tried to explain
When I rise I'll come back to reign
I'll come back to reign
