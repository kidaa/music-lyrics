Hold close the human in you
Cherish your freedom 
Let nothing deny you
Your enemy hides from the truth
Clings to the darkness cowers in the shadow
You are the essence of proof
Positive vision of strength individual
Not paralyzed
Not compromised
In dreams reside the fate of man
Recognize those who'll destroy
Those who will suck from your hard work and struggle
To governments you're but a toy
Anonymous mules on whose backs they ride freely
Give not to Caesar his tithe
Instead care for yourself, your family, your pride
You're not categorized
Not number assigned
With dreams you provide for the hope of man
Chorus:
Revealing all their darkest crimes
Destroy the hush
Exposing truth through the other side
Destroy the hush
With strength one day we will collide
Destroy the hush
And in so doing we will retrieve ourselves our lives
Destroy the hush!
Imagine a world free of fear
A world where your dreams can be real as envisioned
A world where you choose what to be
Not what they make you A monitored slave
Those dreams will soon disappear
If we don't progress and succeed in the stifling
Of government lies
Expose what they hide
And we will provide for the fate of man
