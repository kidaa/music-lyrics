I am the consequence of zealotry
I am decay
Corrosive rust of time you'll never wash away
I am the bitter cold, the frozen wind, the frost of hate
Across the plains I sweep to slaughter what I've raped

I have no patience for the masses
My star is death - In the sky it burns

I am the blackened earth, the fire of hell, the end of night
I am the final breath in all the wars you fight
I am justice - I am vengeance
Sentence all to die
I am nothing; believe in nothing
I am every sigh

I have no patience for the masses
My star is death - In the sky it burns
The book of truth well written
And so the pages turn

Let the stars fall from the sky
A sign your ties are severed
Let your hatred rule your mind
A death that lasts forever

[solo: BV - JG]

I am atomic - I'm a warhead
I am suffering
The scars of ignorance and soul of blasphemy
I am destruction, devastation
I am every crime
Annihilation of creation and the end of time

I have no patience for the masses
My star is death - In the sky it burns
The book of truth well written
And so the pages turn

Let the stars fall from the sky
A sign your ties are severed
Let your hatred rule your mind
A death that lasts forever - forever:
