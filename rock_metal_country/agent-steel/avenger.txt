Erasing the earth with a wave of your hand
Your life means much more than mine
Gathering strength you await your command
We've stared at the sun until all eyes are blind
Guardian of fire - Who's sworn to you?
Enlightened One - Secreting the truth

Wait Bide Your Time
Desecrator
Souls lost in time
Suffocator

Rise from your knees - Avenger
Live To Disease - Betrayer
Rise from your knees - Avenger
Live To Disease - Betrayer

[solo: JG]

From chaos you reign with the world on a leash
Jerking the chain to force a cry
Obedience now Subservience next
We do as you will or we scream when we die
Hymn to disaster - Sing it to the land
The chilling strains of man destroying man

Wait Bide Your Time
Desecrator
Souls lost to time
Eviscerator

Rise from Your knees - Avenger
Live To Disease - Betrayer
[repeat chorus]

The streets wet with blood and the sky spitting fire
No one escapes from the clutch of the damned
Ascend, ascend to the throne of your madness
A skeletal knight with a scepter in hand

Rise from your knees - Rise from your knees
Rise from your knees - Rise from your knees

[solo: BV]

Rise from your knees - Rise from your knees
Rise from your knees - Rise from your knees

[solo: JG]

Your coming foretold and we watched all the signs
And still we failed to recognize
Begged your solutions to damage your planned
Deserving no mercy deserving your lies
Lord of the slaughter - who's sworn to you?
Oh chosen one - lead us to our doom

Now is your time
Violator
Gifts from the blind
Desecrator

Rise from your knees - Avenger
Live To Disease - Betrayer
[repeat chorus 2X]

Rise From your knees  - Rise
