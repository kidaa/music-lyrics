I'm staring In your eyes 
Your heart's like a wall, 
Only catching a glimpse 
A spark through the haze, 
Sirens singing a song 
The lonely to know, 
Reaching out, the grains of sand 
Slip through my fingers 
chorus SEARCHIN'.  SEARCHIN', SEARCHIN'.  SEARCHIN' 
I'M STILL,SEARCHIN' 
SEARCHIN'.  SEARCHIN', SEARCHIN'.  SEARCHIN' 
Trying to heal from the wound you left on my soul 
Your heart's been changed to black, 
I gave my life, you took all the chances 
They put your sword through my heart 
chorus SEARCHIN'.  SEARCHIN', SEARCHIN'.  SEARCHIN' 
I'M STILL,SEARCHIN' 
SEARCHIN'.  SEARCHIN', SEARCHIN'.  SEARCHIN' 
Time pays back three folds over 
I'm Still Searchin'Searchin' for you 
 solos 
Now the Spy, the Traveler 
Searchin' the land 
Changing nightmares into dreams, 
This song is signaling 
Awaits a heart that's true, 
To find that someone who'll stay... 
chorus SEARCHIN'.  SEARCHIN', SEARCHIN'.  SEARCHIN' 
I'M STILL,SEARCHIN' 
SEARCHIN'.  SEARCHIN', SEARCHIN'.  SEARCHIN' 
Time pays back three folds over, 
I'm Still Searchin' for you... 
Still Searchin'... Searchin for you...
