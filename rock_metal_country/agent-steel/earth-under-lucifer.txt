With its dawn rides cold oppression
Foreign armies settle on new shores
Called to negate insurrection
Armed enforcers ready to make war

Neo-Kosacks in NATO colors
For the State herding sheep
Your internment Re-education
Prove you can learn or forever sleep

Come on and fight - Heart is forever
Lay down and die life's not all you surrender

Blind Say your prayers
As your name turns to numbers
Blind Say your prayers
On the last train to nowhere

Look to the sky it foretells your disaster
Two suns arise so all men shall find
An EARTH UNDER LUCIFER forever brilliant
A world trapped in light where the shadow will shine

Come on and fight - Heart is forever
Lay down and die life's not all you surrender

Blind Say your prayers
As your name turns to numbers
Blind Say your prayers
On the last train to nowhere

[solo: BV, JG]

Come on and fight - Heart is forever
Lay down and die life's not all you surrender

Blind Say your prayers
As your name turns to numbers
Blind Say your prayers
On the last train to nowhere
