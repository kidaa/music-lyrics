Cold sweat in nightmares 
The desolate one. 
Deceived by betrayers 
Alone in a crystal ball, 
All hopes are shattered dreams 
Through the lens of a neon screen, 
The hourglass is sifting 
Terminal from the final incision, 
chorus SEND SIGNALS to Space 
BURNED BRIDGES too late 
The loner is rising 
Beware... I've Nothing Left 
Nothing left... 
A silhouette of disfigured 
Transparent hypocrisies 
A cry through sullen walls 
I laugh with despise 
Running through the corridor 
I've opened the door 
The hourglass is sifting 
Trying to heal from the final 
chorus SEND SIGNALS to Space 
BURNED BRIDGES too late 
The loner is rising 
Beware... I've Nothing Left 
Nothing left... 
harmony solo 
solos 
chorus SEND SIGNALS to Space 
BURNED BRIDGES too late 
The loner is rising 
Beware... I've Nothing Left 
Nothing left... 

My lips are cracked from the heat 
In the desert of pain, 
The sandstorm cracks my feet 
Getting over the storm, 
The crystal balls' open highway 
Has opened the door. 
In my climb I'm like a mirror 
Your reflection shatters on you 
repeat chorus 
Nothing Left...
