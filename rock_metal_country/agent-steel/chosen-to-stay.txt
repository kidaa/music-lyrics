[intro] 
Freed from your shadow 
Approaching the lights, 
Still burned your darkness 
And so It's time... 
You can't hide forever 
You'll run, 
Until it's too late... 
You've chosen the moment 
And you're awaiting the pain, 
So it's clear.. 
You've chosen... You've chosen to stay... 
Satisfied for tomorrow 
Living blinded today. 
Still burned by your hatred 
And those who lead you astray 
A prisoner of the circle 
Bound by your chains of your claims, 
Assuming all that surrounds you 
Can relinquish the pain. 
chorus YOU CAN'T WIN living within 
YOU CANT HIDE what's really inside 
Ws your weakness, Your conscience it haunts you 
You've Chosen To Stay 
Chosen To Stay 
You can't go on earning 
Unless you have paid, 
You're not who decides this 
It's not In Your hands 
Beware burning bridges 
This one's made of steel, 
You might need to cross me 
And then the void will be real 
chorus YOU CAN'T WIN living within 
YOU CANT HIDE what's really inside 
Ws your weakness, Your conscience it haunts you 
You've Chosen To Stay 
Chosen To Stay
