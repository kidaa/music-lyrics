To execute
You made no compromise
Men aren't pigs - SLAUGHTERED
Infected with a plague or rendered with a scalpel by you
You make the claim it was just a job
And killing's nothing more than sawing logs
WASH YOUR HANDS BUT BLOOD LEAVES STAINS

You don't deny
You say you've a creative side
The passion born to an inquisitive mind
Entered men alive and destroyed them from inside It's true
Extracted organs slowly one by one
Your only goal to see the damage done
IT'S YOU - You slid the razor
YOU - The anti-savior
YOU - The crucifier
Babies bathed in fire

NO LIGHT SHINES
From Dead Eyes
It's odd how they match your own
NO JUSTICE
For the murdered
Shoveled lives like lumps of coal
YOUR VICTIMS
Fed the furnace
In the blackened pit that was your soul
Soulless and dead-eyed

[Solo: BV - JG]

At the core
You gained a thrill from the sickening stench
The smell of terror as they MARCHED TO THEIR DEATH
Carry out your orders like a patriotic soldier and maim,
rape, and decapitate
My only wish is that you'd face their fate
IT'S YOU - You led the slaughter
Mother, son, and daughter
YOU - You drove the masses
Bodies scorched to ashes

NO LIGHT SHINES
From Dead Eyes
It's odd how they match your own
NO JUSTICE
For the murdered
Shoveled lives like lumps of coal
YOUR VICTIMS
Fed the furnace
In the blackened pit that was your soul
Soulless and dead-eyed
