RAGING about us 
The signs of war are coming, 
SPACE migrator 
Your presence ever, haunting... 
Bloodpools of tears 
The gods cursed forever, 
The walls of Giza 
Their message was so clear, 
From the walls of the ocean 
From the waters they rise. 
Share their wings they will take us 
Hundred light years in minutes, 
Split through the Cosmos 
The Universe is falling, 
Earth base II, the city underwater, 
See Atlantis is rising 
Watch the skeptic Is sinking, 
From atop of the Andes 
Stands our city of gold, 
chorus YOU CAN'T STOP IT, 
IT'S ALREADY COMING 
TOOLATE! NO HIDING 
THEY'RE CMNG FROM THE AIR 
UNSTOPPABLE FORCE!!! 
solos 
chorus YOU CANT STOP IT 
IT'S ALREADY COMING 
TOO LATE! NO HIDING 
THEY'RE COMING FROM THE AIR... 
As you fly straight into 
A sudden change in the weather, 
Feel the power will crush you... 
Accept, you don't stand a chance 
repeat chorus 
UNSTOPPABLE FORCE...
