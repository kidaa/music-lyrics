Prepare for the coming of the Godz 
Into the mouth of the triangles lair, 
The Erra presage tells us It's time 
The open door pulls you in as you're lured, 
See the coming Atlantis will rise, 
As the New City sinks with despise 
Their presence is starting to show 
The time has come, come to be known 
Their reflexes faster than light 
They move to the skies, 
Moving faster like a comet telemetry tape 
Fix on the speed, 
A hundred and sixty degree turn moving South 
Into the Triangle's mouth 
They disappear without any trace 
The crew is gone, the ship left behind 
Scan the Tropic of Cancer, it's time 
To seek Atlantis, beneath the waters you'll find 
The timeless void through space they collide 
1000 Cycles Per Second the frequency sound 
Balls of fire, object of light 
Metallic Disc hovering low 
Consecutive lights, machinery stalls 
Abduction begins, memory lost 
Communication gone, lapse of time the magnet is on 
The channel is open, they're coming through 
Too late for you 
chorus INDESTRUCTIVE They're coming from space 
INDESTRUCTIVE They can't be destroyed 
INDIESTRUCTIVE They're faster than light 
INDESTRUCTIVE We haven't much time..
