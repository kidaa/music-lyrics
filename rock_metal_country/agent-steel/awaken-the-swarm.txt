You and I are not alone
The earth and sea are not your home
Soon our eyes will see the truth
Elimination offering the proof
Underneath us as above us
Monitoring our existence
Shame to know
Too late we'll realize
Keep us in the black
Created by the ones who have predated
Fathered us
And still we are denied
Chorus:
Awaken The Swarm
Tunnels deep inside the earth
Cities built to house the men of worth
Fodder for their Godz
Created us to pay the cost
The price of their survival
Dictates our removal from their space
An accident
We're children born of lies
So below us plots conspire
To closet those who speak the truth
I'll not be silent 
We must fight it
Realize
Awaken the swarm
We are not alone
Tested as we've grown
Knowledge gained is now a curse
The more you know, the less you're worth
Awaken the swarm
AWAKE!
