A Paperclip base in the late 1940's
Camp Hero, a tribute to time traveling Horus
Stationed on top of an undersea mountain
A piece of Atlantis where Montauks are pharaohs

NOW THE AIR IS FULL
Of viruses grown within walls underground
NOW THE SEA IS SICK
Toxic pollutants have poisoned the sound

The rise of the Phoenix controlling the weather
Dimensional research to decode "forever"
Dismantling molecules for reassembly
Men meshed with metal-USS ELDRIDGE

FACE THE TRUTH OF TIME
Bio-electromagnetically compromised
DEVASTATING CRIMES
Four hundred and thirty five megahertz rinses the mind

And they're reading my mind
Bending my mind
Using my mind
Telling my mind

One day the sky will disappear
The walls of time removed
Shattered lives won't matter here
Doomed to search for light - Forever black

[solo: BV - JG]

FACE THE TRUTH OF TIME
In its inconsistency such a fine line
BETWEEN THE THEN AND NOW
We're all here together we'll soon find out how but not why,
never know why - we never die
CAUGHT IN THIS TRAP

While the world turns black and the crowd becomes consuming
Share your space with souls forever caught
Between the here and there is only madness
Is knowing worth the price it costs to stare inside Pandora's Box?

One day the sky will disappear
The walls of time removed
Shattered lives won't matter here
Doomed to search for light - Forever black
