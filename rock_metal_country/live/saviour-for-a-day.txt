if i talk too soft, they
think i'm preaching if i talk too slow, they think i care.
if i walk too fast, then i've got purpose here.
can't you see, see through the prayer
it's got you now, so i will play
it's got you now, so i will play, play,
saviour for a day

if you go too far, i'm not reaching.
don't care who you are, try and see.
i am here like there is sky and there is air
won't you see, see through the prayer

it's got you now, so i will play
it's got you now, so i will play, play,
saviour for a day

let me be your saviour...

don't you know, i so love you
don't you know, i so care
don't you know, don't you know, don't you know i so need you
don't you know, i so care
so let me be your saviour today!

come on, come on, come on girl

you think i'm preaching
you think i talk too slow
well i'm not reaching, no no no no no
see through it baby, see through it for me

saviour, saviour, saviour, saviour....

who put the fear in here

i watched a man tell his boy
about the pains of reality
then i watched that child grow into a soldier
defending contradictions and paving the way...
