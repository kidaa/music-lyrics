we hit the room, me and my crew and it was cool, 
until we bumped into you now it's been years, 
but there you were like a mustang, 
redlinin' every single gear with a man that danced like he was born in '49, 
but lost his groove back when jesus died i wanna know, 
are those replacement hips is that a swatch watch 
do you know what time it is

does he run it deep enough
to take you there
does he run it deep enough
oh tell me baby
does he run it deep enough
tell me, tell me
does he run it deep enough
does he run it deep enough for you

we hit a couch, the place was packed with sweaty palms, 
sweaty thongs, and sweaty backs my mouth was dry, 
my brain cold high, the groove was right, 
so i decided to ignite your eyes met mine, 
you skirt began to rise, 
and so did i now you know that i took that prize in the middle of the club, 
in the middle of the club, in the middle of club now tell me!

does he run it deep enough
to take you there
does he run it deep enough
oh tell me baby
does he run it deep enough
tell me baby

what did i do what did i say 
that gave you away tell me what didn't i do, 
what didn't i say that sent you away from me

i wait for you to take my i wait for you to take my hand

does he run it deep enough
to take you there
does he run it deep enough
oh tell me baby
does he run it deep enough
oh tell me, tell me
i'm just a jealous guy, i'm just a jealous guy, come on!
