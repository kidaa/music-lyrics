Verse 1:  [Brother Marquis]
I won't take a bitch to my house
Don't have to see where I'm livin', uh-uh, that's out!
If you want to splak, I know you're down like that
We can go to this place by the railroad track
It has a room with a view, just right for two
Equipped with the accessories to get you in the mood
Like bottles of champagne with gold-trim glasses
A king-size waterbed to lay your ass in
A video screen, of you and me
So don't be camera-shy; I won't let nobody see
You can lounge around in your silky nightgown
Just take off your bra and pull your panties down
'Cause I'll seduce you, whore, bust down your back door
You dog-ass bitch, get down on all fours
'Cause this is the place for head, booty and cock
You know what it's called, the Fuck Shop!

Verse 2:  [Fresh Kid Ice]
Now bitches and sluts, I'm down with 'em
And there's a place where I get with 'em
It has a water bed 'cause the place is phat
A lion-skin rug to lay the bitch on her back
With mirrors on the ceiling and on the walls
Mirrors on the floor so I can see it all
No need for hide-and-seek, so drop them draws
And raise that ass so I'll splak it all!
So bend your ass over, I'll get it from the back
Dick ya ass down, make the pussy go smack
And with every stroke, bitch, start to yell
Ain't nothing can save you but a truth in the smell
It's a freaky place, and an all-out blast,
'Cause when you're done, you'll wash your ass
So if you're down, we'll hit the spot
You know what it's called, the Splak Shop!

Verse 3: [Brother Marquis]
The Fuck Shop, the ideal place to meet
When you're cheatin' on your wife with an undercover freak
It's better than any hotel room
Just right for a secret rendezvous
So when you're on a mission, one late night
And you're looking for a spot where the price is right
You can come on in for an hour or two
But just make sure you bring a rubber with you!

[Fresh Kid Ice]
When you're with a hoe and you wanna get freaky
This is the spot when you're low on money
Pick her ass up when it's after dawn,
Jump in the ride, head to the park
No need for candle lights, panel doors will do
In case you wanna play a little peek-a-boo
So if you got a trick, head to the spot
You know what it's called, the Splak Shop!
