anyone, caught in you mystery
keep it angry
keep it whispy
i've fallen down
drunk on your juices

turn my head
turn my head
it's aimed at you

funky temple
your dress is torn to shreds
your eyes are crazy
i bowed to save my head and
i can't forget you
but i remember

turn my head
turn my head
it's aimed at you

oh no,
we came to love you all day
these bastards are leavin'
somebody's go to stay
whatever we called you
it's just a name
just a name
