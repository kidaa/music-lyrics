let's gather round the supper table,
and tell the boy he's just as able
to die with his boots untied
evening's come, let's settle down
and sing one more song without a frown
sing for, sing for our voices
and more, sing for our choices,
just don't lie, lie, lie, lie, lie...

love must stand when raising a man... raising a man...
to teach him direction and the best that he can
and lesson one, you will run,
sink into your chair with fright

a baby boy is born today
where comes he from, where will he play
will he run or will he stand
now i lay him down to sleep
a state of mind, his soul will keep.
i give him words, words to say
that he might love, love everyday
just don't lie, lie, lie, lie, lie...

love must stand when raising a man
to teach him direction and the best that he can
and lesson one, you will run,
sink into your chair with fright

but the night, the night night night, the night's all right...
