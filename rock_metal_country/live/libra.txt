libra, take my eyes from me
oh libra, make me blind so that i can see
everyone's dreamin' of a truth to be
everyone's changin' channels on a big tv

oh libra, like a balance

time tried to hold her, tried to tie her down
but i beat the clock,
now the balance makes my world go round,

oh libra, like a balance
libra, my love
libra, my love...
