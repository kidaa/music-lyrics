even now the world is bleedin' but feelin' just fine all numb 
in our castle where we're always free to choose never free enough 
to find i wish somethin' would break cuz we're runnin' out of time

and i am overcome i am overcome holy water in my lungs i am overcome

these women in the street pullin' out their hair my master's 
in the yard givin' light to the unaware this plastic little place 
is just a step amongst the stairs

and i am overcome i am overcome baby holy water in my lungs i am overcome

so drive me out out to that open field turn the ignition off 
and spin around your help is here but i'm parked in this open space 
blockin' the gates of love

i am overcome i am overcome holy water in my lungs i am overcomed

beautiful drowning this beautiful drowning this holy water 
this holy water is in my lungs

and i am overcome i am overcome i am overcome i am overcome
