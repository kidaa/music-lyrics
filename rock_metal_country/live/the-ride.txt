in the east they can meditate they can recreate the sound of OM 
and bring us home i think i'll go there someday maybe 
for a holiday maybe just light a candle and take a seat for the ride

you don't need no money to fly to truly fly away you don't need no car 
to truly ride to truly ride away

in the west we think we're the best we've shown the whole wide world 
that money is all we care for now someday the scientists 
will see there's no such thing as gravity they'll all just light a candle 
take a seat for the ride

you don't need no money to fly to truly fly away you don't need no car to truly, 
truly ride to truly ride away

as you ascend in silence all doubt behind thee you reach the summit 
my friend and find your destiny
