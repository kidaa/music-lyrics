you seem like a girl who likes to tell her bed is made
you seem like a girl who likes to wear her pearls
well i'm not the type who likes to dwell,
save my money or kiss and tell, yeah

oh why does she water them, paper flowers

this girl walks up so graciously,
slips something in my pocket so secretly,
i said: "honey, what's this you gave to me"
"oh nothing, water, wait and see"
i said: "paper flowers, they can't grow!"
"just give'em water and let me know,
give'em water and let me know, give'em water
and let me know"

oh why does she water them, paper flowers
paper flowers...

oh why does she water them, paper flowers
paper flowers...

she's dressed in black as you can see,
she tries so damn hard to be the enemy,
she's got big black boots, get outta her way,
she wants to kick tomorrow, punch yesterday,
kick tomorrow, punch yesterday

oh why does she water them, paper flowers
paper flowers...

turn a light on, turn a different light on
turn a light on, turn a different light on now
turn a light on, turn a different light on
turn a light on, turn a different light on now!

oh why does she water them, paper flowers
paper flowers...
