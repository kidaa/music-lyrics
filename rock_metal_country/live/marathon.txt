Join us now, we're on a marathon
We're always dancing when the music plays
Join us now, we're on a marathon
Dancing, dancing through the nights and days
We must dance because the Twenties roar
The Twenties roar because there's bathtub gin
Vo-de-o-do and the road to sin
The road to whoopee and a whole lot more
Charles A. Lindberg, tons of confetti
Dempsey-Tunney, Sacco and Vanzetti
Black, black Monday and the market drops
But we keep on dancing, dancing, we can't stop
Marathon, marathon
Mara, mara, marathon
Join us now, we're on a marathon
We're always dancing when the music plays
Join us now, we're on a marathon
Dancing, dancing through the nights and days
We must dance because the Thirties scream
The Thirties scream because the Horsemen ride
Orphan Annie lives, Daddy Warbucks dies
Breadlines, shanty towns, Frankenstein's bride
Adolf Hitler and the Siegfried follies
Joseph Stalin and a bag full of jollies
Call your broker and buy marzipan
While we keep on dancing, dancing on and on
Marathon, marathon
Mara, mara, marathon
Marathon, marathon
Mara, mara, marathon
Join us now, we're on a marathon
We're always dancing when the music plays
Join us now, we're on a marathon
Dancing, dancing through the nights and days
We must dance because the Forties burn
The Forties burn because the trumpets blare
The Yanks are coming, coming over there
Auschwitz, Edelweiss, Drang und Sturm
Manhattan Project, Robert Oppenheim
God makes mushrooms just as God makes time
Peace is sweet, man, like a lollipop
So we keep on dancing, dancing, we won't stop
Marathon, marathon
Mara, mara, marathon
Marathon, marathon
Mara, mara, marathon
Join us now, we're on a marathon
We're always dancing when the music plays
Join us now, we're on a marathon
Dancing, dancing through the nights and days
We must dance because the Fifties zing
The Fifties zing because the Sixties swing
And the Seventies flash and the Eighties bang
And the Nineties whimper and the century hangs
Robots working in the cotton fields
Vacations on Venus just a tourist deal
Fornication on tape, instant happiness
So we keep on dancing, dancing, we can't rest
Marathon, marathon
Mara, mara, marathon
Marathon, marathon
Mara, mara, marathon
