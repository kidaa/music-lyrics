I have never taken Life
Yet I have often paid the price
And you, you are a victim of this age
And the guilt that hangs around your neck
Has got me locked up in a cage

You've got to learn to live until no end
But first you must learn to swim
All over again
Because...

Pain lies on the riverside
And Pain will never say goodbye
Pain Lies on the Riverside
So put you feet in the water
Put your head in the water
Put your soul in the water
And join me for a swim tonight

I have forever, always tried
To stay clean and constantly baptized
I am aware that the river's banks are dry
And to wait for a flood
Is to wait for life

I've got to learn to live until no end
But first I must learn to swim all
Over again,
Because...

Pain lies on the Riverside.
