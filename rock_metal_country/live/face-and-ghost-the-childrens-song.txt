you got it bad
you got it good
you saw the sun
like you knew that you would
we gotta make this better
gotta make this right
ain't no peace in the valley baby
'til the darkness turns to light

can you hear that children's song
can you take me to that place
high above the lamentation up on the desert plane
do you hear that children's song
can you take me there

lost in the maya
overboard in the sea
there was void and then that water broke
then something called "me"
now a trip to the desert to look at the sky
it's like never-ending mirrors 
playing tricks on my eyes

can you hear that children's song
can you take me to that place
high above the lamentation up on the desert plane
do you hear that children's song
can you take me there

the face and ghost my guide
i must move on
it's the face of one ravaged by love
it's both dead and alive

you got it bad lover
no you got it good
you saw the sun
like you knew that you would
in spite of my confusion
up above all my pain
I gotta death-grip on this vision
here we go again

the face and ghost my guide
i must move on
it's the face of one ravaged by love
it's both dead and alive

sha la la la la la la
sha la la la la la la
sha la la la la la la 
can you hear them singin'
can you hear them singin'

can you hear that children's song
can you take me to that place
do you hear that pilgrim's song
can you take me there
