Suddenly she came 
Like a come that comes and goes 
With a sweetness in her eyes 
And a ring between her nose 

Walking down the beach 
We saw a castle made of pain 
We went inside 
Rings were exchanged 
And heaven wore a shirt 

that said 
I really, really, really ove you 
I really, really, really love you 

Suddenly it came 
Into my mind not preconceived 
A dream of many oceans 
And not the God that I believed 

But like the come that came and went 
My mind just had to intercede 
The need for repetition arose 
Now heaven wears a shirt 

that says 
I really, really, really got to have you
