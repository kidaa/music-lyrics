like himaalan cold winter
these jaws of kali yuga
yeah it's a crazy kind of cold
a lifeless slumber in a stranglehold
yeah tibet, she can't even touch this
I'd rather freeze in her forests
we're in a spiritual winter
and I long for the one who is

Fire!
amongst the dreamers
you are in my heart

like the sun on the icecaps
my only friend in the prison
the long lost meaning to the story, story
the divine and ancient wisdom
how could it be that you've graced my night
like a pardon from the governor
like a transplant from the donor
like a gift from the one who is 

Fire!
amongst the dreamers 
you are in my heart
Fire! 
amongst the dreamers
you are in my heart

in a place where everything dies
it's you I follow
see by the fire
of my darlin', yeah!

Fire!
amongst the dreamers
you are, you are
in my heart

like a pardon from the governor
like a transplant from the donor
like a kiss, like a kiss, from my darlin' yeah
