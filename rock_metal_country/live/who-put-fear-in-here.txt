i watched a miracle in the making
then had a scientist tell me that i
couldn't live without breaking,
my habits of fearlessness and crying for the world...

who put the fear in here
was it you, who finally shed the tear

someone told me that two lovers bound
could put another sun in the sky
if you believed it, there'd be
twice the light and no one would be scared to fly

if i believed it, there'd be
twice the light and no one would be scared to fly

i thought i knew exactly what scared me
and i would never have to run again.
so i went to sleep and began dreaming
of perfect lives in paradise
woke up and started screaming...

who put the fear in here
who put the fear in here oh no...
was it you who finally shed the tear
then who put the fear in here
