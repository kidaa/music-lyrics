Words can't describe this lonliness
Wanting you wishing you wanted me
I see you everywhere I go and
Walk away alone
Words can't describe this emptiness
Deeper and deeper as days go by 
I see you in my dreams at night
And wake up alone
I see something sad in your eyes
And I know the reason why
You need someone to love you 
Open your eyes 
I am right here
I am right here
Words can't describe this happiness
I feel inside everytime you're near
I see you and I won't say I'm tired of being alone
I see something sad in your eyes 
And I know the reason why
You need someone to love you 
Open your eyes 
I am right here
I am right here
One day once upon a time
One moment will change my life
Someday you'll open your eyes
And see I am right
I see something sad in your eyes
And I know the reason why
You need someone to love you 
Open your eyes 
I am right here
I am right here
I see something sad in your eyes
And I know the reason why
You need someone to love you
Open your eyes
I am right here
I am right here
