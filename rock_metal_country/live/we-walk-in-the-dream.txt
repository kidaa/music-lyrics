I was wrong
we are not these bodies alone
in a dream with a mind of its own
I, I know you long
to be tethered and tied to the heart of the one
the one that be layin' you down
on that ancient ground
nothin' more to be found
ah yeah

now we walk in the dream
but dream no more
to live a life in love the only thing in common was
we knew there was somethin' more
now we walk in the dream
but dream no more
to live a life in love
to hear the voice in the wilderness
the other side of the door
somethin' more

i feel strong
i'm finally at peace
the war is all gone
by no cause of my own
like an eagle cuts through the air
no time for fear
faith in his wings takes him there

now we walk in the dream
but dream no more
to live a life in love the only thing in common was
we knew there was somethin' more
now we walk in the dream
but dream no more
to live a life in love
to hear the voice in the wilderness
the other side of the door
somethin' more!

more than these 
women in the streets pullin' out their hair 
somethin' more
somethin' more than all the pain we feel
somethin' more
more than we could dream of, all light
love-bliss, no death and no fear
no fear!!!

now we walk in the dream
but dream no more
to live a life in love the only thing in common was
we knew there was somethin' more
now we walk in the dream
but dream no more
to live a life in love
to hear the voice in the wilderness
the other side of the door
somethin' more

i was wrong
oh yeah, i was wrong
