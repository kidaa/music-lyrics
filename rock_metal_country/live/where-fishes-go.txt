yeah I found god 
and he was absolutely nothin' like me
he showed me up like some dime-store hooker
who was plain to see
I couldn't take it anymore so I went back to the sea
cuz' that's where fishes go 
when fishes get the sense to flee

where you goin' now
what's your plan

yeah I found god 
and he was absolutely just like me
he opened my mouth, looked down my throat
told me I was thirsty 
he said, I been, I been, I been
been in this water all my life
never took the time to breathe, breathe,
BREATHE!

whatcha doin' in this darkness baby
when you know that love will set you free
will you stay in the sea forever
drownin' there for all eternity
whatcha doin' in this darkness baby
livin' down where the sun don't shine
come on out into the light of love
don't spend another day
livin' in the sea
livin' in the sea, yeah

I couldn't take it anymore
so I went back to the sea
cuz' that's where fishes go 
when fishes get the sense to flee
breathe, BREATHE!

whatcha doin' in this darkness baby
when you know that love will set you free
will you stay in the sea forever
drownin' there for all eternity
whatcha doin' in this darkness baby
livin' down where the sun don't shine
come on out into the light of love, child
don't spend another, no no
whatcha doin' in this darkness baby
come on out into the light of love
come on out into the light of love child
don't spend another day
livin' in the sea, livin' in the sea
