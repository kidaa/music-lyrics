We find love, you and I
It's a new game to play
Then we tell our first lie
And see love go away
And we find...we're alone
We rush on, you and I
We don't need love at all
We need thrills, we need speed
Then we stumble and fall
And we find...we're alone
We're loyal, you and I
To flowers that are dead
We forget how to cry
We save photos instead
And we find...we're alone
We hear guns, you and I
We ask what is that
Then we open the Times
We're informed where it's at
And we find...we're alone
We're moral, you and I
We stand for what's right
We Slaughter all evil
By dawn's early light
And we find...we're alone
We're lucky you and I
We're alive and secure
But in the bank and the church
We can never feel sure
And we find...we're alone
We've made it, you and I
We have glory and fame
Yet we never know why
We feel so ashamed
And we find...we're alone
We have power, you and I
But what good is that now
We could build a new world
If we only knew how
And we find...we're alone
We are old, you and I
We beg warmth from the sun
In the dreams that we dream
We ask what have done
And we find...we're alone
