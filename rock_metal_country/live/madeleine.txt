I'm waiting for Madeleine
In front of the picture show
Every night at half past ten
Madeleine, she loves that so
I'm waiting for Madeleine
We'll go down and eat at Joe's
The french fries are from who knows when
But Madeleine she loves them so
Madelein's my Christmas tree
She's America to me
I know that she's too good for me
That's what her mother always says
I'm waiting for Madeleine
We'll go to the picture show
I'll tell her that I love then
Madeleine, she loves that so
She is much more than pretty
She is all that you know
She is my whole life to me
I love my Madeleine so, so
I'm waiting for Madeleine
But I'm getting soaked and wet
I've been soaked since half past ten
Madeleine is not here yet
I'm waiting for Madeleine
Joe is closed by now I'll bet
No French fries from who knows when
Madeleine is not here yet
Madeleine's my shining sea
She's America to me
I know that she's too good for me
That's what her father always says 
I'm waiting for Madeleine
I've still got the picture show
I'll tell her that I love her then
Madeleine, she'll love that so
She is much more than pretty
She is all that you know
She is my whole life to me
I love my Madeleine so, so
I waited for Madeleine
I only have myself to blame
I went and caught a cold again
Madeleine, she never came
I waited for Madeleine
All I did was call her name
A thousand times since half past ten
Madeleine, she never came
Madeleine's my "Tis of Thee"
She's America to me
It's true that she's too good for me
That's what her brother always says
I waited for Madeleine
It's always been the same
Waiting here since who know's when
Madeleine, she never came
She is much more than pretty
She is all that you know
She is my whole life to me
I love my Madeleine so, so
I'm gonna wait for Madeleine
In front of the picture show
Tomorrow night at half past ten
Madeleine, she'll love that so
I'm gonna wait for Madeleine
We'll go down and eat a Joe's
The French fries are from who knows when
But Madeleine, she loves them so
Madeleine's my Christmas tree
She's America to me
So what if she's too good for me
Her mother?
I'm gonna wait for Madeleine
We'll go to the picture show
I'll tell her that I love her then
Madeleine, she'll love that so--oooh!
