see me walking aimlessly about,
don't know whether to whisper or to shout,
i could be wrong, i could be very, very right.
here i stand, innocence in my room
she's naked in my bed, wild thoughts inside my head
oh no! she's my...

sister, with her, don't let your heart
break too soon.

what i've wanted to be all my life

i can't sustain your love
i can't complain your love
i can't explain your love
oh no! she's my...

sister, with her, don't let your heart
break too soon
maybe, baby, come on sister,
lady you're my breath!

sister yeah...

she's my sister...
