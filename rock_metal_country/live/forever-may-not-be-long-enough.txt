forever may not be long enough for my love i have a will
but i'm lost inside your time if you could, 
would you come with me to the other side 
forever may not be long enough forever may not be long enough 
forever may not be long enough for this love forever forever forever

this world is never enough, and I'm not givin up my faith in love is like blood, 
i'd spill it freely for some my faith in love is like blood, 
it flows in everyone don't stop to look at the clock, 
forever won't be long enough

forever may not be long enough for you to know just how far i'd travel,
just how far i would go open your heart and everything will be alright 
open your heart, baby leave with me, don't be afraid forever!

this world is never enough, and I'm not givin up my faith in love is like blood, 
i'd spill it freely for some my faith in love is like blood, 
it flows in everyone don't stop to look at the clock, 
forever won't be long enough

forever may not be long enough forever may not be long enough 
forever may not be long enough forever may not be long enough
