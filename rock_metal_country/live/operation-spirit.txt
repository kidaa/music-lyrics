Heard a lot of talk about the ocean 
Heard a lot of talk about the sea 
Heard a lot of talk about a lot of things 
Never meant that much to me 

Heard a lot of talk about my spirit 
Heard a lot of talk about my soul 
But I decided that anxiety and pain 
Were better friends 
So I let it go 

Did you let it go? 
Let's get it back 
Let's get it back together 

Heard a lot of talk about this Jesus 
A man of love, and a man of strength 
But what a man was two thousand years ago 
means nothing at all to me today 

He could have been telling me about my 
higher self 
But he only lives inside my prayer 
So what he was may have been beautiful 
But the pain is right now 
And right here 

Let it go! 
Let it go! 
Let it go, my friend 
And let's get it back 
Let's get it back together
