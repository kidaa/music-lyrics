this is not helping me at all
what you are doing here
in the name of god and love
it's the distribution of fear
pyramids, healing wires, analysts with fame
I haven't got your degree
and I forgot your name

pick me up and put me on the ground
set me up and spin me all around
no, you are not the one I wish to see

this is not helping me at all where did we get this plan
that you could give to me what I might already have pyramids, 
healing wires, a musician's fame
I volunteered you my eyes
in place of facing me

oh Hitler, in a robe of truth
my emptiness has built your altar
and I've worshipped myself in you forever
until now!
