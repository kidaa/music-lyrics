in the moment I was losing my head
readin' too much and losin' my head and I was
reachin' forward, I was already there
readin' too much and losin' my head
this information caused a cut in the line
now I'm remembering God and readin' too much
it's so nice
the print is smaller than the ants in the grass
I'll have to put it away now

in the morning there are things to be read,
words to be said, and food to be fed,
but I won't be there.
I'll be clutchin' on a megaphone pointed at my head,
would you be there,
would you kindly, read this word for word
so loud and clear,
I can't remember it all,
it needs to be clear, I tell you,
if the feeling drops out of your voice,
would you kindly pick it up

this is how, I'll go out tonight
dressed in blue, by the book tonight
this is how, I'll go out tonight
but I don't need a book.

we're talkin' anchors, talkin' ships, we're talkin' seas,
we're talkin' everything you need
you should be workin' now,
not only askin' how
and the whereabouts of where you'll be.
I don't suspect you will be thinking
when the brain is dead
and the mind has taken over,
this is a skill, this is not a game,
where have you been,
are you with us
can you hear us
got the megaphone pointed at you
