if the mother goes to sleep with you
will you run and tell geraldo
if the mother bears your children without tears
without the usual costs of labor

if the mother goes to bed with you
will you run and tell the neighbors
will you hide behind that get up that you wear
or will take te first ear that comes into contact with your blade
like peter did on the hill

will you call her a freak
will you call them freaks

if the mother goes to bed with you
will you run and tell the papers
how she picked you from a line up in downtown philadelphia
with a cigarette hangin' out of your mouth and henry miller in your back pocket
you little fucker

if the mother goes to bed with you
in the bowels of the cathedral
will you render her asunder with what she really needs
or will you crash that beautiful silence with some talk about
finding yourself in you mother's arms

will you call her a freak
will you call them freaks
or will you call them gods
will you call them freaks

you know you sperm is weak
you never looked, so high
to ever find her so low
you did not have to go, that far
to show her you were holy

now you know they're gonna come for you
and drag your silly name into the mud
if the mother bears your children without tears
and without the usual costs of labor
