Never used to be so tired 
Never used to be so anxious 
Never said "used to be" so much 

If this is love then I 
Have been so sorely mistaken 
If this is peace then I 
Have been so falsely awakened 

Please don't tell me what love is 
Let's look together 
And find out what love is not 

I've been to every book 
I've been to every seer 
In order to find the truth 
As if it lives somewhere 

I want to uproot my violence 
I want to live like a saint 
I want to give up everything 

Just like the businessman wants to gain 
Just like the businessman wants to gain 

Please don't tell me what peace is 
Let's look together 
And find out what love is not
