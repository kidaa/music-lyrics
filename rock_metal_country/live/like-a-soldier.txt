i just come down from the mountain a happy man turned on the television, 
should of chewed off my hand i'm sick of all the false glory "in god we trust" 
show me one dollar bill that hasn't passed through the cuss

dand if you break my will i will come back again to destroy everything 
you stood for oh!

i will go on like a soldier through the storms of love and i take you back, 
take you away from here my friend and charge you up again

we just come down from the mountain 
where the breezes were blowin and everything was growin like some tree 
in the bush still i gotta live my life here with some pretty scary bretheren
but now i'm a rebel on a mission baby to live and die by my smile

and if you break my will i will come back again to destroy everything 
you stood for oh yeah!

i wait for you to take my i wait for you to take my hand

i will go on like a soldier through the storms of love and i take you back, 
take you away from here my friend and charge you up again 
charge you up again charge you up again, yeah

let's go to ray's, not to pizza hut let's go to the pig, 
not to starbux let's vote for nader, what are we waitin for 
i'm gonna live to be a hundred and sixty four to the crib 
then back to the studio to write a song so good make a midget grow 
from the north pole, down to mexico if you don't know the words, fuck it! 
let's go!
