optimism,
optimism perished from the face of my earth
and then you came along, came along and swept me away,
she kissed me, as we stood on the edge,
the night made the day as we made for the bridge
it started raining hard, and i saw we may live to regret

no i never really understood
no i never really understood why,
because i've never been given,
never been given two tries,
no i never really understood,
understood why...

pessimism,
pessimism perished from the face of my earth,
and then you came along, came along and swept me away,
did you miss me did you miss me as we walked
through the pain, attached the chain so you could
see me again
i started asking myself, did i teach you right

no i never really understood
no i never really understood why,
because i've never been given,
never been given two tries,
no i never really understood,
understood why...

understood why...
you came to me, you broke the bonds,
you set me free
and then the love that you promised me
came a tumblin' tumblin' tumblin' down
into my hands...

no i never really understood
no i never really understood why,
because i've never been given,
never been given two tries,
no i never really understood,
understood why...

so teacher teach me...
