I'm gatherin' up my friends today
and those who recognize the face
as the vision that changed my mind
from hate to faith
was as simple as grapes to wine and sweet as
I'm gatherin' up my friends today
all these hookers and soldiers and swine
and would-be saints
all alone in their rooms that sparkle in their eye
play a song that they'll come outside
to see if 

love will overcome
if this love will make us men
love will draw us in
to wipe our tears away

the day that I was so sweetly sung
by the wind and the thunder moved by "someone"
the feelin' of being lived was so strong
the giver became the gift, all one
the day that I was so sweetly sung
the wind seemed to whisper softly, "oh son,
don't wait for the seas to part or messiahs to come
don't sit around and waste this chance, to see it!"

love will overcome
if this love will make us men
love will draw us in
to take our fear away

LOVE
LOVE
LOVE
LOVE, hey, yeah

love, this day now, this day that I was so
sweetly sung, I know, I know that 
love will overcome

love will overcome
if this love will make us men
love will draw us in
to take our fear away, wipe our tears away
love!
and all my friends are here
in the city I sing my song
in the face of the hooker, the soldier, the swine
I found it, I found it, I found love!!!!!

love will, love will, love will, 
overcome
over come
