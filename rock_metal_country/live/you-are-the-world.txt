If you've ever known love
If you've ever know peace
If you've ever know joy
Make sure that you are on time

If you've ever known war
If you've ever know pain
If you've ever said no
Make sure that you are on time
You are on time
You are on time
We are on time

For you are the world Fighting, mating, warring
You are all this now
Be aware, not scared
Look at me now
Silence
I say
You are the world
