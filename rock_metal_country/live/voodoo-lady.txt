light up a cigarette she said
and calm the fuck down
you got a serious side to you
that could give the whole world a frown
now nothin' really matters to me you see
check out these holes in my gown
let your eyes lose their focus a little
let your guard come down

i was thirsty for everything
but water wasn't my style
guess we might have to teach me somethin'
guess we might have to show me how

now put out that cigarette she said
somethin' ain't right in here
it's tied to the both of us, I ain't sure now, it isn't clear
we could have been born helpless children
beggin' for our next meal
I could be a voodoo lady, just a classy hooker
playin' the field

classy holy hooker!!!
hey! I've made up my mind, yeah 
I came to see your sign 
disappear this mornin' but come back tonight

light up a cigarette she said
and calm the fuck down
relax and let your ears hear this beautiful song
that's hidin' underneath the sound

underneath the sound!!!
I made up my mind
I came to see you fly
disappear this mornin' but come back tonight

voodoo lady
voodoo lady
voodoo lady
voodoo lady
I was thirsty for everything but blood, wasn't my style!
voodoo lady
did I dream you up or are you for real
are you for real
are you for real
