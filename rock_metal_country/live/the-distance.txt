let him come into the city
let him find his lucky penny
let him put it in his pocket and shake it all around

I've been to pretty buildings, all in search of you
I have lit all the candles, sat in all the pews
the desert had been done before, but I didn't even care
I got sand in both my shoes and scorpions in my hair
I saw that...

oh the distance is not do-able 
in these bodies of clay my brother
oh the distance, it makes me uncomfortable
guess it's natural to feel this way
oh, let's hold out for somethin' sweeter
spread your wings and fly

my car became the church and I
the worshipper of silence there
in a moment peace came over me
and the one who was beatin' my heart appeared and....

oh the distance is not do-able
in these bodies of clay my brother
oh the distance, it makes me uncomfortable
guess it's natural to feel this way
oh, are we locked into these bodies
let's hold out for somethin' sweeter
spread your wings and fly

oh, are we locked into these bodies
are we anything at all
let's hold out for somethin' sweeter
spread your wings and fly
this distance is dreamin' 
we're already there tonight
