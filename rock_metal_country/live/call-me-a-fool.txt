i can't believe i finally found the key, the door, 
the trip it was all in my mind now i'm one with the fools of love i can't believe
i finally found the prisoner, 
the free man were all in my mind now i'm one with the fools of love

these fools of love are misunderstood their history is with me now

i can't believe my core was shaken i gave up the ghost of everything 
i was before now i'm one with the fools of love

the fools of love are misunderstood the mystery is with me now

so call me a fool call me a fool call me a fool

i can't believe my dream is over i woke up this morning with nothing 
but light in my eyes now i'm one with the fools of love i can't believe the key, 
the door, the clouds that blocked the sun they were all in my mind 
now I'm one with the fools of love

and these fools of love are misunderstood their history is with me now

so call me fool call me a fool call me a fool

the fools of love are misunderstood the mystery is with me now
