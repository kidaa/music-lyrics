[Intro]: [Mr. Mixx]
Big booty hoes -- up wit it!
Hoochie mamas -- up wit it!
Let me see ya touch the ground!

Verse 1:  [Brother Marquis]
I don't know my reputation
But all the niggas in the hood say it's all good
But the bitch ain't shit, so you need to make a switch
Smackin' on ya lips with your hands on your hips
Triflin' slimy, don't try me
Playin' on the phone?  You supposed to be grown
Bitch, stop lyin', I ain't with it
Keep runnin' ya mouth and I'ma stick my dick in it
Hoochie hoodrat needs home training
Ghetto-ass always complaining
Tryin to clown in front of my friends
By the way, bitch, can I get those ends?
Fuck theatrics, you ain't no actress
Lay on the mattress and let a nigga splak it
The bitch is full of DRAMA!!
Hoochie hoodrat is a hoe like her momma!

Chorus 2x: [Mr. Mixx]
She ain't nothin' but a hoochie mama!
[Hoodrat, hoodrat, hoochie mama!]
Yeah, she ain't nothin' but a hoochie mama!
[Hoodrat, hoodrat, hoochie mama!]

Verse 2:  [Fresh Kid Ice]
Hoe I love your big brown eyes
And the way you shake your thighs
Actin' like you're so damn cute
Let a real nigga just knock them boots
I don't need no confrontation
All I want is an ejaculation
'Cause I like them ghetto hoochies
Ones who like to pop that coochie
[Hoo wee!] Miami style!
Makin niggas smile, bitch get wild
'Cause freaky shit is what I like
and I love to see two bitches dyke
My favorite time is 69
Bitch you know it's hoochie time
Fuck what you heard and save the drama
All I want is my hoochie mama!

Chorus 4x:

[Luke]
You ain't nothin' but a hoochie ma-ma!
[Hoodrat hoodrat hoochie mama!]

Verse 3: [Brother Marquis]
Mama just don't understand Why I love your hoochie ass
Sex is what I need you for I got a good girl, but I need a whore
I like my bitch promiscous Hot in the ass and ready to fuck
Foreplay your way, our way, my way
Trick or freak, and I hit it on Friday

[Fresh Kid Ice]:
Girl, you know you look so cute
Ridin' 'round town in ya Dazzey Dukes
Come on over for a visit
Let a nigga ride in ya Civic
Cos I like them ghetto hoochies
One who got them big ol' booties
Save the drama for your mama
All I want is my hoochie mama

Chorus 4x:

You ain't nothin' but a hoochie ma-ma!
