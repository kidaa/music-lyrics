it was an evening i shared with the sun
to find out where we belong
from the earliest days
we were dancing in the shadows

more wine
cuz i got to have it
more skin
cuz i got to eat it

inside the outside, by the river, used to be so calm
used to be so sane
I rushed the lady's room
took the water from the toilet
washed her feet and blessed her name

more peace
is such a dirty habit
slow down, we're too afraid

let me ride
let me ride
burn my eyes
let me ride
