kill the lights
you and i
on the boat
hypnotized
i look at you,
you say to me
"i'm the lock, now
you're the key"

it's all the same
just play the game
carry the weight
of this ball and chain

save the lies
you and i
on the road to rationalize
you and i should never guess
you and i should never regret

it's all the same
just play the game
carry the weight
of this ball and chain
this ball and chain
this ball and chain...
