i was on a street with a common name i prayed for love 
yeah i even begged i had a vision of you that carried me through

i was on a street with a common name i prayed for love 
yeah i even begged i had a vision of you that carried me through

and nobody really knows what i would do for you nobody really knows 
how much i love you nobody really knows, 
nobody knows nobody knows, nobody knows

i cleared my mind and i turned around grateful to the one 
who had laid me down i was silent in love pourin down from above

like so much rain it fell and pierced my brains the trees all alive 
with their colors like the dreams of man i had a vision of you 
that carried me through

and nobody really knows what i would do for you now 
nobody really knows how much i love you baby nobody really knows, 
nobody knows nobody knows, nobody knows
