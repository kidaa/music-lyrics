I'd like to grab that son of Mary
The one who wrote on my statue
"He has lived all of his life
Between honor and virtue"
Me, who screwed all of my friends
From dirty lie to dirty lie
Me, who screwed all of my friends
From New Year's Day to New Year's Day
In the purest name of love
How I cheated every mistress
In the purest name of love
How I lied with each caress
That son of Mary I'd like to have him here
And all you damned kids...get out of here
I'd like to grab that son of Lent
The one who had the nerve to boast
"God calls back the ones he loves
And he was the one God loves the most"
Me, who only prayed to God
When my teeth were killing me
Me, who only prayed to God
Except when I was scared of Satan
Me, who even prayed to Satan
Every time I was in love
Me, who even prayed to Satan
Whenever I was scared of God
That son of Lent I'd like to have him here
And all you damned kids...get out of here
I'd like to grab that son-of-a-bitch
The one who wrote on my statue
"He died like a hero
He was a soldier brave and true"
Me, who went off to the war
Because I was so damn bored
Me, who went off to the war
To make it with the German broads
Me, who got killed in the war
Making it with the German broads
Me, who died during the war
Because I couldn't help it
That son-of-a-bitch, I'd like to have him here
And all you damned kids...Please
Please get out of here
