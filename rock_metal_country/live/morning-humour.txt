slippery jack, no more turning back,
all around, morning humor
i am a waiter and i am a server
i'll run to your needs with strength and fervor
in times when you are wasted i will walk in
through the door, pick you from the floor
then watch you grow into a man

with a big burly beard
and a mustache to match
i'll watch you love the world
and all that it has...

with that morning humor,
morning humor
the kind that wakes you up
the kind that's in my blood
morning humor, morning humor, yeah...

i am on top again, soon to be low again
oh will this ever end
i'm sorry i don't mean to sound like a whale
trapped in the ice, but ain't it nice to say exactly
what i please...

with a big toney voice or a
soft mellow voice or the
loud boisterous voice of an opera, opera lady!

with that morning humor,
morning humor
the kind that wakes you up.
the kind that's in my blood
morning humor, morning humor, yeah...

but the joke that kills
is just a joke to you
you need some...

slippery jack, no more turning back,
all around, morning humor

the kind that wakes you up
the kind that's in my blood...

morning humor...
