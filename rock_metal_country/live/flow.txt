Gotta find a way to flow
in a host of things that grow,
where babies become old
and love is bought and sold.
The mouth of god is wide,
so let's just fall inside
and let the whole damn thing go
and flow...

Everybody's here
Mystery and beer
I have nothin to fear

Cuz I found a way to flow
in a host of things that grow
where babies become old
and love is bought and sold.
The mouth of god is wide,
so let's just fall inside
and let every damn thing go
and flow...

Everbody's here
The mystery is near
I have nothin to fear

Cuz I found a way to flow
in a host of things that grow
these babies become old
and love is bought and sold.
The mouth of god is wide,
so I'll just fall inside
and let every damn thing go
and flow...

Everywhere we go
come inside
Everywhere we go
Everywhere we go
