The world is burning down
Can't you smell the smoke in the air
War, disease, and famine
This demon, she is everywhere

Poets and preachers and politicians
They've all had their say
And we got 10,000 years
Devoted to nothing
But tomorrow and yesterday

If all of the ignorance in the world
Passes a second ago
What would you say
Who would you obey
I am here to say that

Peace is now

Mr. President
I hereby pardon you of all your crimes
For they are just as much mine

Selfishness and separation have led me
To believe that the world is not my problem
The world is not my problem
I am the world
And you are the world

If all of the ignorance in the world
Passes a second ago
What would you say
Who would you obey
I am here to say that

Peace is now
