You say "Hold on to the reigns" 
I say "Let them go tonight" 
My brain waves 
Confused between what is and ain't 
She cries "Groundless and free" 

Tired of the water 
Tired of the wine 
Tired of the future 
Tired of time 
Tired of the madness 
Tired of the steel 
Tired of the violence 
Tired of me 

Used steel 
Used steel am I 
What was pliable in love 
Is now hard and crystallized 
The intellect is fine 
For counting money 
And recalling times 
That she cried, 
"Groundless and free" 

Hope is a letter that never arrives 
Delivered by the postman of my fear
