i'll kill you in my dreams
i turn the other cheek during the day
i'll kill you all

the subculture of my dreams
is waiting for me to fall asleep
i know you're scared, you should be
k know you're scared

hero
dreamer

this attic of my mind
these feelings i can't hide
i can't share
i feel alone, ah yeah

the subconscious keeps me here
i fell in love with a balladeer
i saw your tongue, it licked my heart
they called you queer

hero
dreamer
hero

they called you queer
they called you queer
they called you queer
they called you queer
