oh desert speak to my heart
oh woman of the earth
maker of children who weep for love
maker of this birth
'til your deepest secrets are known to me
I will not be moved
I will not be moved

"don't try to find the answer
when there ain't no question here
brother let your heart be wounded 
and give no mercy to your fear"

adam and eve live down the street from me
babylon is every town
it's as crazy as it's ever been
love's a stranger all around

in a moment we lost our minds here
and lay our spirit down
today we lived a thousand years 
all we have is now

run to the water
and find me there
burnt to the core but not broken
we'll cut through the madness
of these streets below the moon
these streets below the moon

and I will never leave you
'til we can say, "this world was just a dream
we were sleepin' now we are awake"
'til we can say

in a moment we lost our minds here
and dreamt the world was round
a million mile fall from grace
thank god we missed the ground

run to the water
and find me there
burnt to the core but not broken
we'll cut through the madness
of these streets below the moon
with a nuclear fire of love in our hearts

yeah, I can see it now lord
out beyond all the breakin' of waves 
and the tribulation
it's a place and the home of ascended souls
who swam out there in love!

run to the water 
and find me there
burnt to the core but not broken
we'll cut through the madness
of these streets below the moon
with a nuclear fire of love in our hearts
rest easy baby, rest easy
and recognize it all as light and rainbows
smashed to smithereens and be happy
run to the water and find me there
run to the water
