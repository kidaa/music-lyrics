Im chaos international
The writing on the wall
A Lazarus in parable

A dark and sullen lullaby
Whispered softly as you die
Promising torments are nigh

Danger warning levels hissed out loud
I saw the silver lining hidden in a mushroom cloud
Now Im reeling from the shock at ground zero

If yesterday you would have stood up proud
Then why tonight have you thrown in with the stoning crowd?
Ill breathe through the foetus of a new day kicking...

The foetus of a new day kicking

Its true that Jesus cannot save
Im rising from the grave
To put my double cross to shame

A poison rush, a heart attack
A white assassin painted black
Youll fear this reaper coming back

Danger warning levels hissed out loud
I saw the silver lining hidden in a mushroom cloud
Now Im reeling from the shock at ground zero

If yesterday you would have stood up proud
Then why tonight have you thrown in with the stoning crowd?
Ill breathe through the foetus of a new day kicking...

On a night like this
You laid the serpents kiss
In this garden of Gethsemane
You played the traitor well...

In a dawn to come
I will blind the sun
To grant you pardon as my enemy

Before damning you to hell...
