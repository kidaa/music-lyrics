Nightfall, in thrall
I call her beauty to me
Whose ebon-lidded eyes excite
Shadows to wander through me
Whose kiss glittered with sleep
Is a thief come after dark
To steal away the leaden wreaths
From my cemetery heart

[Special Edition version:]

Nightfall, in thrall
I call her beauty to me
Whose ebon-lidded eyes excite
Shadows to wander through me
Whose kiss glittered with sleep
Is a thief come after dark
To steal away the leaden wreaths
From my cemetery heart

Thrilled to see the light
Bruise-reddened, silhouetting
Murder sites
As dusk attends her sons' blood wedding
Spilt across the skies
In reefs of omen
Licking flames and pagan rites
The night awaits with baited thighs

Start this artist darkness

Yearning now to start this
Burning as an artist
Turning on the darkness
Dizzy looking up with pervertigo
A sewer deity of recrement
World below

I'll make you pray

I spy with wicked lips
The cream of mortal kind
Committing their sins
Their penitent skins
To the harems of my mind

Prey

Thrilled to breathe tonight
The sultry air of graces
Passed in flight
Like birds of May with playful faces
Fills me with delight
Their crystal skirts
Spun from stars, worn tight
Wink of fists in wishful places

Start this artist darkness

Yearning now to start this
Burning as an artist
Turning on the darkness
Dizzy looking up with pervertigo
A sewer deity of recrement
World below

I'll make you pray

My whims like smoke in summertime
Writhe atop the blooms
Committing their thin
White Catholic limbs
To the cloister in my room

You see I need
To feed my dreams to order
To be agreed
With the beast in me
That bleeds their borders

Prey

Nightfall, in thrall
I call her beauty to me
Whose ebon-lidded eyes excite
Shadows to wander through me
Whose kiss glittered with sleep
Is a thief come after dark
To steal away the leaden wreaths
From my cemetery heart
