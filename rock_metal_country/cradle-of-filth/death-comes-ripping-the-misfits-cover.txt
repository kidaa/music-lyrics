Originally performed by The MisfitsTurn the lights down low
And close the door, oh
Future is coming
Future risin'
Shotgun blast, a demon piece of lead
With both eyes open
I wait up for the kill
Feel the evil
Feel the heat as I blast you open
Death comes ripping
And it's going, death comes ripping
You feel the heat as death comes ripping
Rip your back out
And death comes ripping out
Flesh and blood
To weak for you
Turnin' it over
A little too late to penetrate
Death comes ripping
And it's going death comes ripping
You feel the heat as death comes ripping
It'll rip your back out
Death comes ripping
And it's going, death comes ripping
You feel the heat as death comes ripping
You rip your back out
Death comes ripping
And it goes, death comes ripping out
