Flowers lift your precious head to me
I have come to her warm embrace
The gentle touch of surreality
A sweet kiss from beloved faith
The gardens swim with fervent life tonight
I sense the beauty that waits for me there
Dancing with the statues in the pale moonlight
The velveret whisper at play with her hair
