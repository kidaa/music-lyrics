Swords in hands, at the bloody fields of history
We rend our blades through dogma and humility
Carve the future according to our will
Set worlds ablaze with our seething fire
Let all acknowledge, that we are here
as Masters to rule this flaming humanity
Our beings formed in rage and defiance
with strength to trample the weak and the foolish
And so we march, with burning breath
Temples aflame on our path to glory
