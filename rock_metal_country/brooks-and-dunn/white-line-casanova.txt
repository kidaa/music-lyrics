I'm dead headin' down from Tulsa 
Goin' back to San Antone 
My baby called me up this morning 
Begging me to come back home 
Haulin' high hopes and thin air 
Losin' money by the mile 
I'll get there a poor man 
She'll make it worth my while 

I was a white line casanova 
A love bandit of the road 
I got the one I can't get over 
I miss her more with every load 
I got these eighteen wheels 
Singin' home sweet home 
I been too long gone 
Oh I'm comin' home to ya 

I ain't left the fast lane 
Since I hit the last toll gate 
I know she's out there waitin' in that Lone Star state 
She'll be standin' on the front porch 
Reachin' out with open arms 
This woman's out to get me 
Shoot the dog and sell the farm 

I was a white line casanova 
A love bandit of the road 
I got the one I can't get over 
I miss her more with every load 
I got these eighteen wheels 
Singin' home sweet home 
I been gone too long 
Oh I'm comin' home to ya 

I got a white knuckle grip 
On this wheel in my hand 
I'm rollin' down the highway 
Just as fast as I can 
I'm blowin' smoke from both stacks 
Pickin' 'em up, I'm puttin' 'em down 
There won't be no time at all 
'Til I'll be rollin' into town 

I was a white line casanova 
A love bandit of the road 
I got the one I can't get over 
I miss her more with every load 
I got these eighteen wheels 
Singin' home sweet home 
I been gone too long 
Oh I'm comin' home to ya 

Yea I got these eighteen wheels 
Singin' home sweet home 
I been too long gone 
Oh I'm comin' home to ya
