Some girls go to church on Sunday 
Live life by the golden rule 
You got girls gonna graduate one day 
Suma cum laude from party school 

Some they walk the straight and narrow 
Some girls they just don't care 
Good girls go to heaven 
Bad girls. go everywhere 

Some girls are into heavy metal 
Dance with the devil everywhere they go 
Others of em cut a rug to the fiddle 
Dance to the rhythm of the cotton eyed Joe

CHORUS

Miss high fullutin' likes to sip fine champagne 
Prim and proper drippin' in diamond rings 
Little sister wears high heals and blue jeans 
A long neck drinkin' certified wild thang 

CHORUS 

Good girls go to heaven bad girls go everywhere
