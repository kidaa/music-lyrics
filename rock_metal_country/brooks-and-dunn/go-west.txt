That burning sunset in the sky 
Is calling out to us tonight 
I won't work for my old man 
Anymore that you fit into your mammas plan 
There's a place for people like you and me 
True love's still got room to breathe 

And we can drive all night 
Into the morning light 
Let's go west 
It's our ticket out of here 
Yeah we can disappear 
Let's go west 
And that painted sky was made for us 
It's everything we ever dreamed of 
Let's go west 

It's hard to leave this place behind 
Got memories turning in my mind 
Little white house with a picket fence 
That protected small town innocence 
But it seems like an even trade to me 
That security for our destiny 

Yeah we can drive all night 
Till the morning light 
Let's go west 
A place that we can go 
Where the tall dreams grow 
Let's go west 
And we'll find a place to call our own 
There's somewhere out there we belong 
Let's go west 

And that painted sky was made for us 
It's everything we ever dreamed of 

Repeat 2nd Chorus 

Yeah let's go west 
Oh let's go west 
Oh let's go west 
Yeah let's go west
