She said, 
Out with the boys don't cut it no more 
And "I'm sorry" is just noise, she's heard it all before 
Said that ring on her finger, well it feels like prison 
She's talked 'til she's blue, and I don't listen 

I went too far this time, 
Crossed over that line, 
I'm past the point of no return 
Livin' proof some fools never learn 
Well I pushed my luck, now she's givin' up 
Somethin' tells me I went too far this time 

She said, 
Save your breath boy, I've heard it all, 
And keep your place there with your back to the wall, 
Said I'm leavin' you lonely 'cause I've had my share 
Save those worn out "I love you's" for someone that cares 

I went too far this time, 
Crossed over that line, 
I'm past the point of no return 
Livin' proof some fools never learn 
Well I pushed my luck, now she's givin' up 
Somethin' tells me I went too far this time 

Well I pushed my luck, now she's givin' up 
Somethin' tells me I went too far this time 
Oh somethin' tells me, I went too far this time
