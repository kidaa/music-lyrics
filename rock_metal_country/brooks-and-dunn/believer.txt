What do I do to make you love me
Baby, like I love you
Why do you keep the key to your heart
Behind a door I can't get through

[Chorus]
I have faith
I hide my time
I'll be all right
I'll be fine
I'm a believer in love

Like a fool playin' with fire
While my flame burns alone
Like a slave to blind desire
Oh I keep hangin' on

[Repeat Chorus]

Somday you'll feel in my kiss
What I do in yours
So wait to see in your eyes
That light I'm looking for

[Repeat Chorus]

I pray
For a sign
Live for the day
You'll be min
I'm a believer in love
I believe in love
