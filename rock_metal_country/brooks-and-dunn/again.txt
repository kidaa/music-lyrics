Ain't it funny, the turns life puts you through.
Don't know what's round the bend,
Man, you don't know where it's leadin' you.
Close your eyes, say a prayer, take it on the chin.
It's a dawn sun, comes back again.

Baby, I thought that love was over and gone forever...
Never gonna come back to me.
Never gonna hold me again.
But your love pounds in my heart like thunder,
Flashes through me like lightning,
Making me believe again.

Don't know what I'm supposed to say.
Ain't got a clue 'bout what I need to do.
All I know is I feel right here,
Right now, here with you.

Baby, I thought that love was over and gone forever...
Never gonna come back to me.
Never gonna hold me again.
But your love pounds in my heart like thunder,
Flashes through me like lightning,
Making me believe..

Baby, I thought that love was over and gone forever...
Never gonna come back to me.
Never gonna hold me again.
But your love pounds in my heart like thunder,
Flashes through me like lightning,
Making me believe again.
oh, oh, oh.
Makin' me believe again.
