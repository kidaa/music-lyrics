I got a six pack, got a single stem rose 
My baby's dressed up she's raring to go 
I got a Jones for the moon and the jukebox 
I like to two step she likes to rock 
That clock on the wall it rings, it chimes 
It's beer thirty, a honky tonk time 

Life's too short, let's get to livin' it 
Let's give it all we can give it 
Let your hair down, turn the music up 
We gonna paint the town flat, tear it up 
The party starts here get in line 
Beer thirty a honky tonk time 

I put in my four day 
I'm going home 
Lord my get-up has got up and gone 
Got my paycheck I'm on my way 
It's finally Friday my kind of day 
I punch the clock, I hit the road flying 
It's beer thirty, a honky tonk time 

Yeah life's too short, let's get to livin' it 
Let's give it all we can give it 
Let your hair down, turn the music up 
We gonna paint the town flat, tear it up 
The party starts here get in line 
It's beer thirty a honky tonk time 

Yeah life's too short, let's get to livin' it 
Let's give it all we can give it 
Let your hair down, turn the music up 
We gonna paint the town flat, tear it up 
The party starts here get in line 
It's beer thirty a honky tonk time 
It's beer thirty a honky tonk time
