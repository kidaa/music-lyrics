She said hey cowboy get off of that couch 
Yeah, the party's on and we're goin' out 
I got my low cut dress and my knee highboots 
I'm like money to burn and nothing to lose 
You're the man of the house you better think of something 
'Cause Mama don't get dressed up for nothing 

She said I been cooped up in this house all week 
It's time to pick it up and move it out to party street 
She said saddle up hoss it's your lucky day 
And I'm a she cat tiger comin' out of the cage 
We can go high rollin' or beer joint jumpin' 
Mama don't get dressed up for nothing 

She's hard to handle, a little high strung 
I'll see her bet and I'll raise her one 
I love when she gets wound up 
I'm Jack of Hearts, she's my Lady Luck 

We re gonna find a little place where we can rip and roar 
We gonna cut a deep groove in that hardwood floor 
Set up the shooters and break out the green 
Throw a whole row of quarters in the boogie machine 
We gonna turn up the heat and keep the jukebox humpin' 
'Cause mama don't get dressed up for nothing 
Go high rollin' or beer joint jumpin' 
Mama don't get dressed up for nothing 
She said babe you better think of something 
'Cause mama don't get dressed up for nothing
