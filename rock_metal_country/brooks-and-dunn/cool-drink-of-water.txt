I bought my girl a diamond, it was our engagement ring 
She took it to a pawn shop, like it didn't mean a thing 
She went right out and bought herself 
A brand new party dress 
She'll be looking good tonight 
When we go out I guess 

She's a cool drink of water 
She's done hocked the ring I bought her 
She might be the devil's daughter 
But she's a cool drink of water 

I took her to a night club, where we used to go a lot 
The beer is cold and frosty and the band is blazing hot 
I went back for a refill 
And this guy walked up and said 
There's a blonde out on the dance floor 
Turning everybody's head 

She's a cool drink of water 
And I should run yes, I probably oughta 
She might be the devil's daughter 
But she's a cool drink of water 

Well I'd had on too many, so she took my keys to drive 
She said we'll have more fun tonight if we get home alive 
Well that copper clocked her doing ninety in a twenty zone 
But she didn't get a ticket 
Just the number to his phone 

She's a cool drink of water 
And that ole cop really thinks he caught her 
He just met the devil's daughter 
She's a cool, cool drink of water 

She's a cool drink of water 
And I should run yes, I probably oughta 
She might be the devil's daughter 
But she's a cool drink of water
