I've loved you since I met you 
I guess I always will 
There's something 'bout the way you smile 
That makes my heart stand still 
You say you love your freedom 
I'd never tie you down 
If you ever need these loving arms 
I'll be hangin' 'round 

If that's the way you want it 
That's alright with me 
If that's the way you want it 
That's how it's gonna be 
I'll be your Johnnie on the spot 
Or Mr. Used To Be 
If that's the way you want it 
That's alright with me 

I'm laid back, easy-going 
I'm not the jealous kind 
I won't get in your business 
If you won't mess with mine 
Just say the word forever 
I'll gladly sing that line 
I'll lay the world down at your feet 
And fly you to the moon 

If that's the way you want it 
That's alright with me 
If that's the way you want it 
That's how it's gonna be 
I'll be your Johnnie on the spot 
Or Mr. Used To Be 
If that's the way you want it 
That's alright with me
