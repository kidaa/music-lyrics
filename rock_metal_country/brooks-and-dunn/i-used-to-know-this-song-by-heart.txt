I sat down to say it
The words wouldn't come
I just couldn't play it
And it tore me all apart

The bell I tried to ring it
The words wouldn't come
I just couldn't sing it
And I used to know this song by heart

[Chorus]
I sued to sing this song to you
For days and days
In so many different manners
In so many different ways
I used to think this dream we had
Could never come apart
And I used to know this song by heart

[Repeat Chorus]

So when I sat down to say it
The words wouldn't come
I just couldn't play it
And it tore me all apart

The bell I tried to ring it
The words wouldn't come
I just couldn't sing it
And I used to know this song by heart
