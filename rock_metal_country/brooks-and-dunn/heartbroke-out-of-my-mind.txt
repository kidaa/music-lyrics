Well I'm flyin' high and feelin' low 
Drinkin' hard and dancin' slow 
I'm gonna shine my buckle to George Jones 
Heartaches are hot on my heels, bartender the race is on 

She's gone for good and I'm goin' to town 
I'm gonna live it up, ya livin' her down 
Jos eacute; pick me up and get me on my feet 
So I can scoot a boot to that two-four jukebox beat 

I'm heartbroke out of my mind 
Pardon me boys if I get a little out of line 
It's just temporary insanity 
Till I get over what she did to me 
I'll be heartbroke out of my mind 

B.Y.O.T 
I brought my own trouble tonight 
I'm gonna get this bein' done wrong down right 
Ya saddle me up boys I'm goin' in 
They say when you fall off, well climb right back up again 

I'm heartbroke out of my mind 
Pardon me boys if I get a little out of line 
It's just temporary insanity 
Till I get over what she did to me 
I'll be heartbroke out of my mind 

It's just temporary insanity 
Till I get over what she did to me 
I'll be heartbroke out of my mind 
Oh I'm just heartbroke out of my mind
