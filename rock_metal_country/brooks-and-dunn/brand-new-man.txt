Chorus: 
I saw the light 
I've been baptised 
By the fire in your touch 
And the flame in your eyes 
I'm born to love again 
I'm a brand new man 

Well the whole town's talking 
'Bout the line I'm walking 
That leads right to your door 
Oh how I used to roam 
I was a rolling stone 

I used to have a wild side 
They say a country-mile-wide 
I'd burn those beer joints 
down
That's all changed now 
You turned my life around 

Repeat Chorus 

I used to love 'em and leave 
'em
I'd brag about my freedom 
How no one could tie me 
down 
Then I met you 
Now my heart beats true 

Baby you and me together 
Feels more like forever 
Than anything I've ever 
known 
We're right on track 
I ain't looking back 

Repeat Chorus 3 times 

I'm born to love again 
I'm a brand new man
