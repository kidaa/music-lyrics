Take your suitcase and take your heart 
Take a train to the dark 
My love will follow you 
My love will follow you 
You can try to lose yourself downtown 
You can burn all your bridges down 
My love will follow you 
Oh my love will follow you 

My love will follow you 
Down every highway of your soul 
You can leave me far behind 
My love will be your shadow 
Everywhere you go 

So close the door 
Turn in the key 
Leave me here like a memory 
My love will follow you 
Oh my love will follow you 

Even on the road that takes you down 
Where the cords of human kindness come unwound 
My love will follow you 
Oh my love will follow you 

My love will follow you 
Down every highway of your soul 
You can leave me far behind 
My love will be your shadow 
Everywhere you go 

If you should ever go so far 
That you cannot get back 
You may not remember 
But my heart will not lose track 

My love will follow you 
Down every highway of your soul 
You can leave me far behind 
My love will be your shadow 
Everywhere you go 
So go ahead baby and take that train 
In my heart you'll still remain 
My love will follow you 
Oh my love will follow you 
My love will follow you 
Oh my love will follow you
