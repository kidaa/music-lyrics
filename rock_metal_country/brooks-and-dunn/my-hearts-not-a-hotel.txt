When your headlights cut across my wall,
Yeah, I thought it might be you.
Lookin' for a place to fall,
An' talkin' sweet, an' thinkin' small.

Seekin' out convenient arms,
Yeah, to rest in for a while.
Someone to keep you safe an' warm,
While you ride out your latest storm.

Oh, my heart's not a hotel you can check in an' out of...
It's not a, a temporary shelter, it's a home for someone's love.
Don't just come here when you're lonely knowing, full well, you won't stay,
'Cause I don't have the strength tonight to turn you away.
Oh, don't let the dawn find me asleep,
On a pillow of regret.
Take all my change, just leave the key,
An' let me keep my dignity.

'Cause my heart's not a hotel you can check in an' out of...
It's not a, a temporary shelter, it's a home for someone's love.
Don't just come here when you're lonely knowing, full well, you won't stay,
'Cause I don't have the strength tonight to turn you away.
[Instrumental break]

No don't just come here when you're lonely knowing, full well, you won't stay,
'Cause I don't have the strength tonight to turn you away.
I don't have the strength tonight to turn you away.
[Instrumental Close]
