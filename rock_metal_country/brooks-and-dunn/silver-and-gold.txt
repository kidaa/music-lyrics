She knows what's been keepin' him out too late 
She never was the kind to sit around and wait 
She loosened the locket he gave her 
She took off her wedding band 
And when he gets home he'll find 
All she's left behind is 

Silver and gold 
Haven't they lost their shine 
Tonight she let go for the last time 
Just silver and gold 
Ties that no longer bind her 
Now he's left alone with silver and gold 

He could've kept her love so easily 
It wasn't like she didn't try to make him see 
But once she made up her mind 
There was no turnin' back 
And he's gonna understand 
When all he's holdin' in his hands is 

Silver and gold 
Haven't they lost their shine 
Tonight she let go for the last time 
Just silver and gold 
Ties that no longer bind her 
Now he's left alone with silver and gold 

And what once was sacred, only yesterday 
They don't mean a thing as she walks away 

Silver and gold 
Haven't they lost their shine 
Tonight she let go for the last time 
Just silver and gold 
Ties that no longer bind her 
Now he's left alone with silver and gold
