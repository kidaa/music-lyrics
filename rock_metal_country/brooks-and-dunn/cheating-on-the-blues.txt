He left you - she left me 
Drowning in this misery 
We stopped living 
When they said goodbye 
We've been faithful to these blues 
But I've had enough - now how about you 
Don't you think we've earned the  right 
To go cheating on the blues tonight 
Cheating on the blues tonight 
Let's go out and do it right 
Throw it into overdrive 
And get on down the road 
Shake it till the break of dawn 
Party till the heartache's gone 
We'll have us a real good time 
Cheating on the blues tonight 

Pick you up at half past eight 
You can bet I won't be late 
With any luck we'll make the dance by nine 
We won't talk about the past 
Let old memories die at last 
Have some fun - keep it light 
Cheating on the blues tonight 

CHORUS
