Once upon a time 
Somewhere in your past 
Someone said forever 
But that promise didn't last 

Now you don't believe 
Love is ever true 
Steel yourself against the day 
When I stopped loving you 

When the day comes that I don't love you 
Every star will fall out of the sky 
And every mountain will tumble down 
And every river run dry 

For every drop of rain 
That ever touched the ground 
For every tear that ever fell 
And never made a sound 

I'll be there 
To hear you call 
And I'll be there to catch you baby 
Should you ever fall 

Chorus 

Chorus 

And every river run dry
