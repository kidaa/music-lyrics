I lost her trail on a Friday night 
She was gone before I got home 
She'd been getting restless 
In that big house all alone 
I've been up and down these city streets 
For three nights in a row 
And lord it's hard to find that girl 
When she gets the urge to go 

It's kinda like a lost and found 
In a border town 
Askin' bout a diamond ring 
They just look at you 
Like you've lost your mind 
Say they haven't seen a thing 
But I know she's been here lately 
I can still smell her perfume 
And she gets crazy on a full moon 

And I know she'll be coming back 
Her car is waiting right outside 
But, I don't want to think about 
Who's taking her for a ride 
And her unpredictability 
Is what I love about her best 

Lord I've got to find her quick 
Before she does something I regret 

It's kinda like a lost and found 
In a border town 
Askin' bout a diamond ring 
They just look at you 
Like you've lost your mind 
Say they haven't seen a thing 
But I know she's been here lately 
I can still smell her perfume 
And she gets crazy on a full moon 

She's out there somewhere 
Burnin up the night 
Somehow I've got to run her down 
I'm running out of time 

It's kinda like a lost and found 
In a border town 
Askin' bout a diamond ring 
They just look at you 
Like you've lost your mind 
Say they haven't seen a thing 
But I know she's been here lately 
I can still smell her perfume 
And she gets crazy on a full moon 

It's kinda like a lost and found 
In a border town 
Askin' bout a diamond ring 
They just look at you 
Like you've lost your mind 
Say they haven't seen a thing 
But I know she's been here lately 
I can still smell her perfume 
And she gets crazy on a full moon
