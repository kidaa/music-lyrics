She looked so good movin' cross the dance floor 
Better than the day she left me 
Arm in arm with somebody new 
Holdin' hands and laughin' like we used to 
I got my best smile on, but it's no disguise 
It don't hide the pain in these eyes 

I did her so wrong, for so long 
Turned my back on her love, now she's long gone 
I did my part, to break her heart 
She walked out on me, and tore my world apart 
She used to be mine 
Oh, she used to be mine 

It's taken every bit of strength that I have 
To keep a hurt look off of my face 
I can't keep from lookin' back over my shoulder 
At the lucky man takin' my place 
Oh, if it weren't for my pride, I'd probably take off runnin' 
Guess what I'm feelin', is what I got comin' 

I did her so wrong, for so long 
Turned my back on her love, now she's long gone 
I did my part, to break her heart 
She walked out on me, and tore my world apart 
She used to be mine 
Oh, she used to be mine 

I did her so wrong, for so long 
Turned my back on her love, now she's long gone 
I did my part, to break her heart 
She walked out on me, and tore my world apart 
She used to be mine 
Oh, she used to be mine 

Oh, she used to be mine, 
She used to be mine
