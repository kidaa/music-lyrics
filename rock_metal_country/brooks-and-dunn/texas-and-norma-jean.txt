It was a foggy mornin' south of San Jose 
We were sittin' in a crowded coffee shop 
With nothin' left to say 
My cup grew cold and a teardrop rolled 
Down her cheek and I brushed it away 
I remember it all just like yesterday 

And I see it now, I feel it still 
It's a day I can't forget and never will 
And I hear her voice on the winds of Abilene 
She used to call me Texas and I called her Norma Jean 

Still see her wavin' through the radiator steam 
She was stranded by the roadside on her way to bigger things 
She threw her bags in back, said she liked my hat 
Her name was Marilyn Justine 
I fell into her California dream 

And I see it now, I feel it still 
It's a day I can't forget and never will 
And I hear her voice on the winds of Abilene 
She used to call me Texas and I called her Norma Jean 

Yeah we took a lotta detours on our winding way out west 
Livin' for the moment, forgettin' all the rest 
The life that she had waitin' and the one I left behind 
And now I'm back here tryin' to sort it out 
One fence post at a time 

In that coffee shop, the road just stopped 
And we faced reality 
The place that she was goin' had no place for me 

And I see it now, I feel it still 
It's a day I can't forget and never will 
And I hear her voice on the winds of Abilene 
She used to call me Texas and I called her Norma Jean 

Yeah I called her Norma Jean
