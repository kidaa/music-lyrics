She said what she wants is a man to be faithful
A true heart somebody willin' and able
To stay by her side through thick and thin
A tender touch every now and then

She's not hung up on fairy tales
Or some dream at the bottom of a wishin' well
Fancy cars or diamond rings
What she wants most are the little things

[Chorus]
That's what she gets
That's what she gets
That's what she gets for loving me

At times I lay awake at night
Stare at her laying by my side
Knowin' there in her heart as she sleeps
She can forever count on me

[Repeat Chorus]

Whatever turns her on
I'm here to do it
Till the day they write my name in stone
I'll live to prove it

[Repeat Chorus 2x]
