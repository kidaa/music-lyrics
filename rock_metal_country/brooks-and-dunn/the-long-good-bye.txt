I know they say if you love somebody 
You should set them free 
But it sure is hard to do 
It sure is hard to do 
I know they say if you don't come back again 
Then it's meant to be so they say 
Those words don't pull me through 
Cause I'm still in love with you 
I spend each day here waiting for a miracle 
But it's just you and me goin' through the mill 
climbin' up a hill 

CHORUS 

This is the long goodbye 
Somebody tell me why 
Two lovers in love can't make it 
Just what kind of love keeps breaking a heart 
No matter how hard I try 
I always make you cry 
Come on, baby, it's overlet's face it 
All that's happening here is a long goodbye 

Sometimes I ask my heart did we really 
Give our love a chance just one more chance 
But I know without a doubt 
We turned it inside out 
And if we walked away 
It would make more sense 
But it tears me up inside 
Just to think we could still try 
How long must we keep running on a carousel 
Goin' round and round and never getting anywhere 
On a wing and prayer 

CHORUS 

Long goodbye 
Long goodbye
