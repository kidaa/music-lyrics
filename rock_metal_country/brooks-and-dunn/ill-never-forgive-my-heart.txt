Hello heartache who let you in 
I swore the last time never again 
Back together just you and me 
Where's you old friend Mr. Misery 

I went and did it I dropped my guard 
I fell in and I fell hard 
Now she's sayin' she's found someone new 
How could I have been such a fool 

Oh close the door turn out the lights draw the curtain 
I'll get over her in time it's gonna take some hurtin' 
I tell myself I told you so as I fall apart 
I can't blame love 
But I'll never forgive my heart
