I started my day with Corona 
Hopin' it'd help me get over 
The night that you left 
But it didn't help 
So I moved on to tequila 
Built a pyramid up to the ceiling 
Ten glasses high 
But I can still hear you sayin' goodbye 

It's gonna take more than a margarita 
More than a shooter 
To blow your memory away 
I still need ya 
I'm hurtin' without you 
Even when I'm feelin' no pain 

Well, tonight I'm the life of the party 
Jokin' about my broken heart 
But it's easy to see 
The joke's on me 
That waitress just asked how I want it 
With or without the salt on it 
I shook my head 
Either way ain't gonna make me forget 

It's gonna take more than a margarita 
More than a shooter 
To blow your memory away 
I still need ya 
I'm hurtin' without you 
Even when I'm feelin' no pain 

It's gonna take more than a margarita 
More than a shooter 
To blow your memory away 
I still need ya 
I'm hurtin' without you 
Even when I'm feelin' no pain 

It's gonna take more than a margarita 
More than a shooter 
To blow your memory away 
I still need ya 
I'm hurtin' without you 
Even when I'm feelin' no pain 

It's gonna take more than a margarita 
More than a shooter 
To blow your memory away 
I still need ya 
I'm hurtin' without you 
Even when I'm feelin' no pain
