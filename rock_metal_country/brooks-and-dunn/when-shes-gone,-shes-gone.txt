Saw an old friend last night I hadn't seen in a couple of years 
Stopped in Galatoire's had a couple of beers 
Talked about the price of oysters, the coach at LSU 
Then like I knew it would the conversation turned to you 

He had to go and I looked at my watch, it was 1:45 
I headed down canal, the quarter was coming alive 
A man on the corner told me that Jesus is coming soon 
But I was lost in the music and the crowd and the smell of cheap perfume 

It's not good for a man to be alone 
But a women needs someone that she can count on 
And I walked down by the river in the cold gray dawn 
Love is like the Mississippi 
When she's gone she's gone 

The line was long at Caf Du Monde so I walked out on the pier 
Thought about all the winds and turns and mistakes that got me here 
Might as well try to change the course this old river takes 
Than to go back in time when you were mine, pretend it's not late 

It's not good for a man to be alone 
But a women needs someone that she can count on 
And what I'd give to go back but the current's just too strong 
Love is like the Mississippi 
When she's gone she's gone 

Repeat 2nd chorus 

Yeah she's gone
