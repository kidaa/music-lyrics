I thought we would always be together 
The love we shared was gonna last forever 
Once I was your one and only 
Now here I sit, Mister Lonely 

He'll hold you tonight, but I won't 
What's he got that I don't 
The one thing I thought I'd never lose 
He's got you 

Beneath this dark cloud you left me under 
Can't sort it out so I'll sit and wonder 
Tell myself, "It hurts, don't it" 
Now my heart will be forever haunted 

He'll hold you tonight, but I won't 
What's he got that I don't 
The one thing I thought I'd never lose 
He's got you 

He'll hold you tonight, but I won't 
What's he got that I don't 
The one thing I thought I'd never lose 
He's got you 
He's got you
