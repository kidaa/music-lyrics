Alone here tonight, lookin' up at the sky 
Wonderin' how I let her go 
Did I hold her too tight, heaven only knows 
A bottle of wine, a day in the sunshine 
Seems like we shared everything 
Yeah I felt her love but I never saw her wings 

And that's the trouble with angels 
That's the trouble with angels 
You can try and make her stay 
But she's bound to fly away 
That's the trouble with angels 

Wherever you are, no matter how far 
I hope you'll always understand 
I'm savin' you a soft place to land 
It's crazy I know talkin' like you're still so close 
But the memory endures 
Are you listenin', I never know for sure 

And that's the trouble with angels 
That's the trouble with angels 
You can try and make her stay 
But she's bound to fly away 
That's the trouble with angels 

That's the trouble with angels 
That's the trouble with angels 
You can try and make her stay 
But she's bound to fly away 
That's the trouble with angels 
That's the trouble with angels 
She'll fly
