Are you gonna call it quits 
'Cause girl from where I sit 
All the signs I read 
Say you're over me 
My world stopped 
And time stands still 
Until I know 
I know how you feel 
Are you all out of love 

The story in your eyes 
Tells me the well's run dry 
Am I a fool for holdin' on 
For prayin' this feeling's wrong 
If what I fear 
Is really true 
Then girl 
I wanna hear it from you 
Are you all out of love 
Are you all out of love 

Is this the end of the line 
Is this as far as we go 
Or can I somehow change your mind 
Or will your heart be forever closed 

Are you all out of love
