These honky tonks and bright lights 
Used to thrill me 
I'd paint the town and stumble in at down 
But now there's no one listening for my footsteps 
It's winding down to one more night alone 

I thought I had her wrapped around my finger 
I didn't think this bridge would ever burn 
I always thought she'd take me back 
But she taught me the cold hard fact 
When it comes to love I've got a lot to learn 

It never crossed my mind that she might leave me 
She did her best to love me till the end 
If she were here I know I'd treat her better 
But I won't ever get that chance again
