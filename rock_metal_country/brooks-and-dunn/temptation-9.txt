Yeah I've been hurt and I've been blue 
And I've been thinkin' 'bout the changes love has put me through 
I've told myself it's got to end 
I've had enough and I ain't goin' back again 
I've watched 'em come 
I've watched 'em go 
Six, seven, eight and I can still say no 
And then tonight you came along 
Only a fool would wanna be that strong 

Temptation #9 
Make a man wanna cross that line 
Face to face with a chance like this 
There's only so much that a man can resist 

I walked alone, I played it safe 
Tryin' not to count the times I walked away 
'Cause when you love and love goes wrong 
A broken heart just seems too much to gamble on 
I first saw you, I had to think 
Oh another pretty woman just what I don't need 
But when I look into your eyes 
Hey I see somethin' makes me wanna roll the dice 

Temptation #9 
Make a man wanna cross that line 
Face to face with a chance like this 
There's only so much that a man can resist 

Ooh you got it shakin' 
Ooh there's no mistakin' 
You're the next trip that I'll be takin' 

Chorus
