Tommy got off at the Texaco
Came bustin' in to Norma's Cafe
Said come on man we gotta go
You know how those party girls hate to wait
Filled up his daddy's trunk with ice and beer
Yeah he was always stealin' the old man's car
Radio never came in too clear
So I'd hang out one on my piece of junk guitar

[Chorus]
Yeah we ruled from the blacktop
To the levee where the party never stopped
Yeah there was power in the night
The spirit was alive
When we would sing
Shan na na na na na na na
When we were kings
When we were kings

Sittin' around the fire one night Tommy called my name
I turned around, he said what do ya think
Had his arm around the prettiest girl I'd ever seen
He kissed her hand and took another drink
I say you must be an angel puttin' up with this guy
She laughed and said play me some Rolling Stones
I couldn't let that chance go by
Yeah I sang her "You Can't Always Get What you Want"

[Repeat Chorus]

That was the fall of '65
I guess Uncle Same was hedging his bet
Tommy's number cam up he said "Hey, I'll be Fine"
"I'll teach 'em a lesson they'll never forget"
Angel and I went to wave goodbye
I guess we'd always thought we'd see him again
You know I took her out a couple of times
We always just wound up talkin' 'bout him

[Repeat Chorus]
Shan na na na na na na na
When we were kings
Shan na na na na na na na
Shan na na na na na na na
