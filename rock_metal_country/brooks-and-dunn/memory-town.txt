There's a house down on the corner with the porch light on
And a window I can look in and see you're always home
Waiting for me with the lights low in your silk night gown
Somewhere on the outskirts of memory town

Past the stoplight there's a desert where my Coupe Deville
Roars down a lonely highway and it always will
The wind is in your hair and we're nowhere to be found
Two spirits on the boulevard of memory town

[Chorus]
I can pull the shades and feel your lips they're touching mine again
I can watch the shadows of the moon slow dance across your skin
Hold you in a place where lovers never say goodbye
Every moment comes alive, when I go down to memory town

Round the corner there's an ocean where the waves roll in
And a feeling that you only feel when love begins
We lie together in the sand and watch the sun go down
I close my eyes and smell the warm salt air in memory town

[2nd Chorus]
I can pull the shades and feel your lips they're touching mine again
I can watch the shadow of the moon slow dance across your skin
Hold you in a place where lovers never say good-bye
Every moment comes alive, every time I close my eyes and go back down to memory town

There's a house down on the corner with the porch light on
A window I can look and see you're always home
Waiting for me with the light low in your silk night gown
Somewhere on the outskirts of memory town

Take me down
To memory town
