Just sittin' here minding my own broken heart 
Still hurtin' like the night she went away 
Here you come a double shot of trouble in your eyes 
Now Heaven knows there'll be hell to pay 

I can't take but just one heartache at a time 
I've gotta wait 'til I've had a chance 
To drink her off my mind 
Well I'll save some tears and meet you here 
Somewhere down the line 
I can't take but just one heartache at a time 

I'd be lying lying in your loving arms 
And tempted as I am I can't pretend 
Just my luck 
You picked tonight to set your sights on me 
Darling can't you see the shape I'm in 

I can't take but just one heartache at a time 
I've gotta wait 'til I've had a chance 
To drink her off my mind 
Well I'll save some tears and meet you here 
Somewhere down the line 
I can't take but just one heartache 

I can't take but just one heartache at a time 
I've gotta wait 'til I've had a chance 
To drink her off my mind 
Well I'll save some tears and meet you here 
Somewhere down the line 
I can't take but just one heartache at a time 
Oh I can't take but just one heartache at a time
