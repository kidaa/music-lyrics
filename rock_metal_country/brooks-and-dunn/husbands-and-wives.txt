Two broken hearts lonely looking houses 
Where nobody lives 
Two people each having so much pride inside 
Neither side forgives 

The angry words spoken in haste 
Such a waste of two lives 
It's my belief pride is the chief cause in the decline 
Of the number of husbands and wives 

A woman and a man 
A man and a woman 
Some can and some cant and some cant 

Two broken hearts lonely looking houses 
Where nobody lives 
Two people each having so much pride inside 
Neither side forgives 

The angry words spoken in haste 
Such a waste of two lives 
It's my belief pride is the chief cause in the decline 
Of the number of husbands and wives 

It's my belief pride is the chief cause in the decline 
Of the number of husbands and wives
