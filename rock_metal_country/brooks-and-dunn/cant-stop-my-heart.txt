Sittin' in my world alone 
I catch myself reachin' for the phone 
Gotta get outta here and find a place to get my head clear 
I make a wrong turn down your road 
And how I got here, I'm afraid I know 
A part of me keeps going too far 
I can't stop my heart 

Yeah it feels what it wants to feel 
And it does what it wants to do 
I tell it no, then before I know it 
It's a right back to lovin' you 
I can't stop my heart before it's through 
It's gonna break itself in two 
I can't stop my heart 

I do my best to leave the past 
But I can't keep my heart from going back 
What am I gonna do, it just remembers what it wants to 
And once it lets your memory in 
I let myself get swept away again and again 
I know it's always tearing me apart 
I can't stop, stop my heart 

Yeah it feels what it wants to feel 
And it does what it wants to do 
I tell it no, then before I know it 
It's a right back to lovin' you 
I can't stop my heart before it's through 
It's gonna break itself in two 
I can't stop my heart
