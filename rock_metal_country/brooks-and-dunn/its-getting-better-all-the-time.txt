I don't stop breathing everytime the phone rings,
My heart don't race when someone's at my door,
I've almost given up thinking you're ever gonna call,
I don't believe in magic anymore,
I just don't lie awake at night,
Asking God to get you off my mind.

It's getting better all the time,
it's getting better all the time.

Yeah I got to work on time again this morning,
This old job is all that I got left,
And no one even noticed I'd been crying,
At least I don't have whiskey on my breath,
Yeah I think I'm gonna make it,
'Cause god won't make a mountain I can't climb.

It's gettine better all the time,
It's getting better all the time.

God I hope you're happy,
Girl I wish you well,
I just might get over you
But you can't ever tell

I always thought I'd do something crazy,
If I ever saw you out with someone else,
But when the moment came last night,
I couldn't say a word,
I stood there in the dark all by myself,
Yeah I could have said a million things,
But all I did was keep it locked inside.

It's getting better all the time,
It's getting better all the time,
It's getting better all...the time.
