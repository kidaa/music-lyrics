I got whiskey to keep me warm when the sun goes down 
And this God forsaken honky tonk ain't likely to run out 
So won't you come on home and save me 
Stop me before I drown 
'Cause I'm no good, pretty mama 
When you're not around 
And there's women in this town whispering in my ear 
Saying things a man in my condition likes to hear 
So won't you come on home and stop me 
Before I step on out 
'Cause I'm no good, pretty mama 
When you're not around 

Well I'm helpless when I'm tempted 
And I'm headed straight for hell 
Oh I've got no resistance 

The Devil knows me well 
So won't you come on home sweet darlin' 
 Oh Lord I need you now 
'Cause I'm no good, pretty mama 
When you're not around 

Now there's a southbound 
Callin' me further down the track 
And if I get on board that train 
Well I'm never coming back 
So won't you meet me at the station 
And tie my boot heels down 
Cause I'm no good, pretty mama 

When you're not around
