You're my angel, you see me through 
Believe in me, I'll believe in you 
Oh fill my heart from your loving well 
You're my angel 

Pick me up when I'm feeling down 
When I stumble on shaky ground 
Oh you're my answer when I cant tell 
You're my angel 

Oh you take me up to heaven 
When you spread your loving wings 

When I am weary and way behind 
When I am clearly out of my mind 
Oh when I find I'm in my hell 
You're my angel 
Oh you're my angel
