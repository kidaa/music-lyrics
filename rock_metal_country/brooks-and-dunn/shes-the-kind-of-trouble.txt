Well you might say trouble is my middle name 
I can't get ahead of the game 
Runnin' on empty and I'm runnin' late 
Bossman's yelling won't give me a break 
I could write a book about getting behind 
But there's one kind of trouble that I don't mind 

She meets me after work when the sun goes down 
She's the kind of trouble that makes the world go 'round 
Total strangers, even my best friends, bird-dog my baby when she walks in 
She's a little slice of heaven, and hell on heels 
And never gonna walk the line 
Oh, but she's the kind of trouble that I don't mind 

We're dancing to the band and from the time we start 
They circle like hungry sharks 
They're cuttin' in quick as I can cut 'em loose 
I could get jealous but it ain't no use 
She can't help it 'cause she's so fine 
She's the kind of trouble that I don't mind 

We're dancing to the band and from the time we start 
They circle like hungry sharks 
They're cuttin' in quick as I can cut 'em loose 
I could get jealous but it ain't no use 
She can't help it 'cause she's so fine 
She's the kind of trouble that I don't mind 

She's hanging out the window on the way back home 
She yells at everybody just come on along 
Party at my place just follow the truck 
We'll be cuttin' a rug 'til the sun comes up 
She's a little slice of heaven, hell on heels 
And never gonna walk the line 
Oh but she's the kind of that I don't mind
