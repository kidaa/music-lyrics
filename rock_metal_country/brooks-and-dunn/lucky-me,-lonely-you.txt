Girl you've got lonely written all over you 
I can read the writing from across this crowded room 
All by yourself there in your world of blue 
Lucky me, lonely you 

Must be in the cards 
Fate played a part 
Brought us here tonight 
Heaven must have lined the stars up in the sky just right 

Chorus 

Who knows the right song, a slow dance 
Might heal your heartache 
Somethin' tells me I don't know 
I just might be here to save the day 

Chorus 

Girl you've got Oh you've got lonely written all over you 
I can read the writing from across this crowded room 
All by yourself there in your world of blue 
Lucky me, lucky me, lucky me, lonely you
