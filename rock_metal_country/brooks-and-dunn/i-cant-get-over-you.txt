I forget where I'm goin' in my own house 
I got myself in this, I'll get myself out 
I talk out loud, at the top of my voice I sing 
Whoa keep the faith, see what tomorrow brings 

I can't get over you 
Try as I may oh it no use 
My heart just cant leave you alone 
My mind wont believe you're gone 
I can't get over you 

I got a front row seat here to a fool's masquerade 
And that fool in the mirror keeps sayin' I'm doin' ok 
I stare at that door that you walked out 
It hits me hard and leaves no doubt 

I can't get over you 
Try as I may oh it no use 
My heart just cant leave you alone 
My mind wont believe you're gone 
I can't get over you 

I can't get over you 
Try as I may oh it no use 
My heart just cant leave you alone 
My mind wont believe you're gone 
I can't get over you
