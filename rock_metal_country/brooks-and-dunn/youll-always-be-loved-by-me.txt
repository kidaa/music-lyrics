I know forever is a long long time 
For a girl to put her heart on the line 
Trust is a tight rope we all have to walk 
Baby don't be afraid I won't let you fall 
With a little faith mountains move 
You and me we can't lose 

You can count on the sun to rise 
And stars to come out at night 
As long as there's air to breathe 
You'll always be loved by me 

Love comes so many times goes 
So much out there we'll never know 
Call it fate call it destiny 
But I think we were meant to be 
This old world it spins so fast 
So many times they just don't last 

You can count on the sun to rise 
And stars to come out at night 
As long as there's air to breathe 
You'll always be loved by me 

You can count on the sun to rise 
And stars to come out at night 
As long as there's air to breathe 
You'll always be loved by me 

You'll always be loved by me
