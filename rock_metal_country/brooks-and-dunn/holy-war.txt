[Chorus]
Some say a holy war is comin'
Gonna be the end of mortal man
There's a TV preacher sayin'
Armageddon is at hand
Sayin' the Jews, the Gays, the Junkies
The Politicians and Infidels
Have conjured up the devil
Upon the gates of hell

I turn on the TV
Lord I can't believe my eyes
Oh Terror walks the streets
While a million mothers cry
Christians pray to Jesus
Lord help us if you can
Send Gabriel and his legions
To defend his promised land

[Chorus]

All it's prophets lead
While the blind sheep they follow
The path to damnation with no future no tomorrow
Justice she may be blind
Tall and proud she marches on
Judgment day is coming
God himself wrote that in stone

They say a holy war is comin'
Gonna be the end of mortal man
There's a TV preacher sayin'
Armageddon is at hand
They said fire rained down from Heaven
On the towers of Babylon
Oh the innocent the sinners
They all died as one

Now victory will be mine
All feeble and good say
But in the end and in its own way
Righteousness will have it's way

[Repeat Chorus 2x]
