You ain't been thinkin' through, now, have you?
The last thing you need is the thing that you keep comin' back to.
The mem'ries still fresh in your mind.
Aware that you lost with it all on the line.
More than you could justify,
But she gives you that look an' you just gotta try,
One more roll of the dice,
Maybe just one more shot in the dark.
One more chance that your luck might change,
While you still got a little somethin' left in your heart.
She's a game you can play, not game you can win,
But one more roll of the dice an' you're believin' again.
Maybe you're still hangin' onto what it felt like,
The higher the stakes, the bigger the rush when it goes right.
An' when you're a gambler in love,
Havin' it all is never enough.
It's a curse when it gets in your blood.
You're down to your shoes, but you can't give it up.
Yeah, one more roll of the dice,
Maybe just one more shot in the dark.
One more chance that your luck might change,
While you still got a little somethin' left in your heart.
She's a game you can play, not game you can win,
But one more roll of the dice an' you're believin' again.
Yeah, yeah, believin'.
[Instrumental break]
She's a game you can play, not game you can win,
But one more roll of the dice an' you're believin' again,
Yeah, you're believin'.
One more roll of the dice,
One more roll of the dice.
Maybe just one more shot in the dark.
One more shot in the dark.
One more chance that your luck might change,
One more chance that your luck might change.
While you still got a little somethin' left in your heart.
She's a game you can play, not game you can win,
But one more roll of the dice an' you're believin' again.
