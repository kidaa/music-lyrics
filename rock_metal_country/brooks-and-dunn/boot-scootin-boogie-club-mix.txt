Out in the country 
Past the city limits sign 
Well there's a honky tonk 
Near the county line 
The joint starts jumpin' every night 
When the sun goes down 
They got whiskey, women music and smoke 
It's where all the cowboy folk 
Go to boot scootin' boogie 

I've got a good job 
I work hard for my money 
When it's quittin' time 
I hit the door runnin' 
I fire up my pickup truck 
And let the horses run 
I go flyin' down the highway 
To that hide-a-way 
Stuck out in the woods 
To do the boot scootin' boogie 

Yeah, heel, toe, docie do 
Come on baby, let's go boot scootin' 
Oh Cadillac, Blackjack, baby meet me out back 
We're gonna boogie 
Oh, get down, turn around, go to town 
Boot scootin' boogie 

The bartender asks me 
Says, "Son what'll it be?" 
I want a shot at that redhead yonder 
Lookin' at me 
The dance floor's hoppin' 
And it's hotter than the Fourth of July 
I see outloaws, inlaws, crooks and straights 
All out makin' it shake 
Doin' the boot scootin' boogie 

Yeah, heel, toe, docie do 
Come on baby, let's go boot scootin' 
Oh Cadillac, Blackjack, baby meet me out back 
We're gonna boogie 
Oh, get down, turn around, go to town 
Boot scootin' boogie
