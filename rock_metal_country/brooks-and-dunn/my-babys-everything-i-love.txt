My baby's like a honky tonk
Open all night, make you feel right
Gets me going, got me buzzing like a neon light
Knock you out like a punch in a barroom fight
My baby's like a smooth shot of whiskey
Make you feel warm, kinda make you feel dizzy
Can't get my fill, I can't get enough
My baby's everything I love

My baby's like a Coupe Deville
Fast motor burnin' comin' over the hill
Oh what a ride, oh what a thrill
Drive all night with my hands on the wheel
My baby's like a trip to town
Radio up, top pulled down
Can't get my fill, I can't get enough
My baby's everything I love

She's all I need in one tight package
Got a spell on me, works like magic
I'm after her like a hound on a rabbit
She's got it all and I got to have it

My baby's like a country song
Dancin' through my head playin' all night long
Plays me like a fiddle, get me singin' along
Well, I can't turn off what she turns on
My baby's like a jukebox rocking
Got the guitars ringing and the big bass poppin'
Can't get my fill, I can't get enough
My baby's everything I love

Nothing but the good stuff
My baby's everything I love
