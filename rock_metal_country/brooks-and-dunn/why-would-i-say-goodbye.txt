I guess I lost my head last night 
Kept on 'til I made you cry 
Walked out with my stubborn pride 
Wasn't nothing you could do to stop me 
I hit the road but I didn't get far 
Just drove around all night in my car 
Now I'm not sure where to start 
To tell you that I'm sorry 

Chorus 
I just want to hold you 
I don't want to hurt you 
I don't want to leave 
I just want to be with you 
And after living alone, lost for so long 
finally found the love of my life 
Why  would I say goodbye 

I don't know what is is about the edge of a cliff 
Makes we want to get so close to it 
I guess this time I finally slipped 
What a foolish way to end it 
Maybe that's why I'm back here now 
got both feet back on the ground 

Hopin' you won't turn me down 
when I ask you for forgiveness 

Repeat chorus
