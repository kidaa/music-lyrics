I've been livin' on truck stop coffee, cigarettes and vitamin C 
It's a wonder that the devil ain't caught me 
I guess he's tired of playin' hide-n-seek 
I've been drivin' like I'm struck by lightin' 
I think about ya and I start to speed 
I might as well be playin' with matches 
In a truckload of gasoline 

CHORUS 

If it's the last thing I do 
If it takes me from Tupelo to Timbuktu 
If it's the last thing I do 
I'm gonna dodge every roadblock, speed trap and county cop 
To get my hands on you 
If it's the last thing I do 

Box of chicken and a day old biscuit 
Ain't nothin' left but a few old bones 
I outta stop but I'm gonna risk it 
Caffeine got me chewin' Styrofoam 
Girl I'm callin' out of Kansas City 
From a fillin' station telephone 
Just had to tell you what I've been thinkin' 
First thing I wanna do when I get home 

CHORUS 

BREAK 

Yeah I've been drivin' like I'm struck by lightin' 
I think about ya and I start to speed 
I might as well be playin' with matches 
In a truckload of gasoline 

CHORUS 

If it's the last thing I do 
If it's the last thing I do 
If it's the last thing I do 

I'm gonna dodge every roadblock, speed trap and country cop to get my hands on you. 
Dodge every roadblock, speed trap and country cop to get my hands on you. 
I'm gonna dodge every roadblock, speed trap and country cop to get my hands on you
