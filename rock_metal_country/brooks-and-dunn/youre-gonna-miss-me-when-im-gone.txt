I'm still hurtin' from the last time 
You walked on this heart of mine 
I can't find much to believe in 
You let me down so many times 
Heaven knows how I love you 
But I'm tired of holding on 
You better kiss me 
'Cause your gonna miss me when I'm gone 

Not much chance we're gonna make it 
If I'm the only one who's trying 
You know I'm running out of reasons 
And we're running out of time 
Someday, girl, you're gonna wake up 
And wonder what went wrong 
You better kiss me 
'Cause your gonna miss me when I'm gone 

You're good at going through the motions 
All I hear are alibis 
Not I get this empty feeling 
When I look into your eyes 
I don't see a love light shining 
I don't know what's going on 
You better kiss me 
'Cause your gonna miss me when I'm gone 

You better kiss me 
'Cause your gonna miss me when I'm gone 

You better kiss me 
'Cause your gonna miss me when I'm gone
