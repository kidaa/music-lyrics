I breeze through the day 
And nothin' much seems to get in my way 
I don't have a care at all 
You walk in the room 
It's always the same 
You call out my name 
I turn 
You smile 
I fall 

I'm at home at night 
Just me and the moon 
But doin' all right 
When out of the blue you call 
I hang up the phone 
I lay down in bed 
Your still in my head 
I dream 
You smile 
I fall 

Oh what could this feeling be 
Could it really be love 
That's happening to me 
Oh yeah yeah 

The closer you get 
The harder it is to keep it together 
I don't have a chance at all 
It's out of my hands 
Oh but what can I do 
I'm crazy for you 
We touch 
You Smile 
I fall 

Oh Yeah 
We touch 
You smile 
I fall
