I keep thinkin' any minute you'll be comin' home honey 
I aint seen nothin' of you in a month of Sundays 
Tell me how long gone are you gonna be 

All you said was you had to get goin' 
Oh but baby I wouldnt mind knowin' just 
How long gone are you gonna be 

How am I supposed to make any plans 
When I still dont even understand 
If you're ever gonna come back home to me 
How long gone are you gonna be 

Maybe I didnt pay enough attention 
But I do believe you forgot to mention 
Just how long gone are you gonna be 

The phone aint ringin', cause you still aint callin' 
I aint been hearin' your footsteps fallin' 
Tell me how long gone are you gonna be 

How am I supposed to make any plans 
When I still dont even understand 
If you're ever gonna come back home to me 
Tell me please 
How long gone are you gonna be
