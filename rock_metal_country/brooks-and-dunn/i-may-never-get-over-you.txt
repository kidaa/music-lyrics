Not that long ago, seems like yesterday,
We were caught up in love... we were swept away.
Seems like overnight from out of the blue,
Something went wrong between me an' you.

Oh, I'll move on, I'll be strong...
Do what I have to do.
No matter where you are, you'll always have my heart...
I may never get over you.

A hopeless dream's insanity...
I'm just a fool with a fantasy.
I close my eyes, I feel your touch,
Just as real as it ever was.

I'll move on, I'll be strong...
Do what I have to do.
No matter where you are, you're always on my heart...
I may never get over you.

[Instrumental break]

Yeah, I'll move on, I'll be strong...
Do what I have to do.
No matter where you are, you're always on my heart...
I may never get over you.
