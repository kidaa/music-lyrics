That wasn't me at a quarter to three back in our backyard 
Tearing up the roses and the home grown tomatoes in my new car 
Those bottles in the driveway and the bottles in the hall 
Well I don't know where they came from 
It must be burglars in the neighborhood 
I sure hope they catch those bums 

I know you've got your own version of the truth 
There's only three things left now I can do 
Deny, Deny, Deny 

Well I was allegedly dropped 
By a truck stop waitress at our front door 
Now who you gonna believe 
Your sweet lovin' daddy or those lying eyes of yours 
That lipstick on my collar 
That you found this morning well that's not lipstick at all 
I was just in a hurry to get back to you honey 
Had myself a little fall 

Oh yeah you've got your own version of the truth 
There's only three things left now I can do 
Deny, Deny, Deny 

Oh please don't answer the phone 
Hey ain't it great being home and alone like this 
That cigarette voice asking for her big boy 
Why should I know who that is 
Yeah I know it looks bad but 
You're lookin' at a victim of a circumstance or two 
Oh what is it now seems like nothing I do ever pleases you 

1st CHORUS 

Deny, deny, deny
