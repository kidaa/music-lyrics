Ridin' on a hurt train 
Making tracks 
Ridin' on a hurt train 
Ain't no turnin' back 
I'm out here on a hurt train 
The moanin' of the rails 
Seems like a sad song 
Last call farewell 

A hundred tons of cold steel 
Rustin' in the rain 
The singin' of the rollin' wheels 
Are callin' out her name 
That whistle keeps blowin' 
That high lonesome sound 
It tells me where I'm goin' 
Is gonna be a long way down 

Ridin' on a hurt train 
Making tracks 
Ridin' on a hurt train 
Ain't no turnin' back 
I'm out here on a hurt train 
The moanin' of the rails 
Seems like a sad song 
Last call farewell 

Now here I sit loaded 
Wondering what went wrong 
The whiskey I can hold it 
I just don't know how long 
I'm out here on a hurt train 

A hundred tons of cold steel 
Rustin' in the rain 
The singin' of the rollin' wheels 
Are callin' out her name 

Ridin' on a hurt train 
Making tracks 
Ridin' on a hurt train 
Ain't no turnin' back 
I'm out here on a hurt train 
The moanin' of the rails 
Seems like a sad song 
Last call farewell 

Ain't no turnin' back
