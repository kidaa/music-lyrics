You put your heart up on a shelf 
I know it's hard to be by yourself 
You need someone that's tur and strong 
Baby someone just came along 

I am that man 
You're trying to find 
I am that man 
You had in mind 
And I'll give you all my love 
'Til you understand 
I won't give up 
'Cause I know 
I am 

Talk is cheap, it ain't worth a dime 
So don't talk to me, just five me some time 
I'm gonna show you what love can be 
My job won't be done until you believe 

I am that man 
You're trying to find 
I am that man 
You had in mind 
And I'll give you all my love 
'Til you understand 
I won't give up 
'Cause I know 
I am that man 
You're trying to find 
I am that man 
You had in mind 
And I'll give you all my love 
'Til you understand 
I won't give up 
'Cause I know 
I am that man
