I get out on the redneck side every now and then 
Call up my baby she comes over and the party begins 
She's a slick nickel she's right on the money 
I wouldn't give her up for a thousand buckle bunnies 
I'm her big cat daddy, she's my little Miss Honky Tonk 

She's got my number, knows my favorite songs on the jukebox 
Goes to gettin' down like crazy and the whole place rocks 
We'll have a few and get to feelin' right 
She'll be my queen bee I'll be her neon knight 
I'm her big cat daddy, she's my little Miss Honky Tonk 

Oh Oh I love her so 
Stand back give her room boys and watch her go 

She's a looker, heads turn when she comes through the door 
A show stopper when she gets to goin' out on the floor 
We leave all our troubles and cares way behind us 
I feel like I'm a king when I'm out with her highness 
I'm her big cat daddy, she's my little Miss Honky Tonk 

Oh Oh I love her so 
Stand back give her room boys and watch her go 

We leave all our troubles and cares way behind us 
I feel like I'm a king when I'm out with her highness 
I'm her big cat daddy, she's my little Miss Honky Tonk 
I'm her big cat daddy, she's my little Miss Honky Tonk
