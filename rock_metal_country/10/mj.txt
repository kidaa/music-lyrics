Did you really think that you were special, did you really think that you were god, 
did you really think you were the king, black or white what's actually your skin?

I can say everything because you're dead and I don't care if you're happy or mad,
I didn't like your style of living, there were enough things that you were missing.

Is this the way you had to leave us or isn't it your fault that you are gone,
are you proud of what you did, millions of people in the shit!
