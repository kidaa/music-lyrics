My dream is realistic and that is for sure, back on track, I want more and more, yeah.. 
Taking all the freedom that you gave us, love the human randomness lets make a total chaos.

The world is one big lie, greater than it is, people are disordered glad I am like this, now let's go and rock this place and be a human race, drink and be alive like there are no other ways.
