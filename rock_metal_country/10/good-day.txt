Well I wake up to a sky so blue 
With my girlfriend in the other room 
Got the coffee on and the pancakes done 
The cat 'ssleeping outside in the sun 

The tv sings its morning blues 
And it's all the same with all the news 
But she walks up, smiles, kisses me 
And says your coffee's done. 

Then starts singing. 
Yeah yeah yeah 
She is singing. 

Well It's a pretty good day. 
I'm lookin' forward to tomorrow 
To have a pretty good day. 
again...

Well it's a pretty good day 
I'm looking forward to tomorrow 
To have a pretty good day 
Yeah we'll have a good day. 

So I lace my boots up and step outside 
Catch a cab cause my car died 
And I go to work with my friend Dan 
Paintin' houses the best we can 

On my way back home I try and mix it up 
Walk halfway then take a bus 
And as it pulls up and the doors open 
I hear the bus driver say "step up" please "STEP UP"

And I'm singing, And I'm singing 
Yeah yeah yeah 
And I'm singing yeah yeah yeah yeah 
Some guy looks over and says 'how ya doin'?'  I say...

Well it's a pretty good day 
I'm looking forward to tomorrow 
To have a pretty good day 
Yeah yeah yeah 

Well it's a pretty good day 
I'm looking forward to tomorrow 
To have a pretty good day 
Yeah we''ll have a good day 

And through the window 
There's a whole world 
And I'm watching all the people 
All the faces and the places I have yet to go 

And the sunshine now it's fading 
And my girlfriend she's waiting 
And I bet that she's outside 
Sleeping in the shade 

Cause it's a pretty good day 
I'm looking forward to tomorrow 
To have a pretty good day 
Yeah, again...

Well it's a pretty good day 
I'm looking forward to tomorrow 
To have a pretty good day 
Yeah, we'll have a good day 

It's a good day 
Yeah.....yeah....yeah 
It's a good day
