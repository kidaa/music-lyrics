Gangster Poem 

Squeak Ru: 

You know sometimes life is a trip 
it can make you do mysterious thangs. 
And sometimes life is a bitch 
how do you deal with the pain? 
Niggas rather smile in my face 
stick a knife in my mothafuckin' back 
than to see my family doin' well 
and my pockets steady gettin' fat. 
Since the age of 14 you know 
I been representin' my neighborhood. 
G'd up every goddamned day 
puttin' it down foe the city of Inglewood. 
And I ain't asked nobody for shit 
ain't nobody had to front me no sack 
everything I got I did it by myself 
and that's a mothafuckin' fact. 
But why when I'm doin my own thang 
and why when I'm on my own grind 
niggas wanna turn they back 
and act like Squeak done switched sides. 
And even though I got niggas that I love 
and niggas that I know  is real. 
I still got them niggas that I wanna 
take my pistol and stick it to they fuckin' grill. 
But have you ever been down wit the homies 
because you thought the homies was true? 
Or have you ever been down wit the homies 
and found out the homies ain't down with you? 
Huh, player haters suck my dick!!
