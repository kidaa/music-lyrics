Mack 10, Mack 10 
f/ AllfrumThai, The Comrads 

[AllFrumThai] 
It go M A C to the K one to the O 
Bitches scream ho 
Hoo bangin with nothin but the cavi 
Stepin out the smog like a hog with my family 
Squeak, Ru and Mack dime on the fade 
Been lacen up our stars and stealin cars Since the 8th grade, 
quick to pull your lid 
You can call us Butch Cassady and the Sundance Kid 
Mack the Inglewood maniac, whos got the biggest sack 
Niggas that get large get put on contract, 
and thats a fact He's all about big bucks 
when he's saggin with his motherfuckin khakis and chucks 
Chicken hawkin, swoop down low my nigga stalkin 
AllFrumTha i When we mob we ain't talkin 
Binky, Mack once again it's on foe life 
Presence is felt, before we takin yo life 

Chorus 
Mack 10, Mack 10, cant you understand 
Mack 10, Mack 10, Bitch I'm the motherfuckin man 
Mack 10, Mack 10, cant you understand 
Mack 10, Mack 10, Bitch I'm the motherfuckin man 

[Comrads] 
Hey Comrad, we keep pushin this crack 
Niggas gettin washed up, and we can't have that 
Niggas makin all these snaps with these wack ass raps 
So we went to Inglewood when we finished our sack 
It was back in January or was it Febuary 
I have to do some time, Mack Dime told me not to worry 
The scene was kinda scary he sent me commisary 
I did my time and touched down with a flurry 
Told me not to worry, signed a deal in a hurry 
No more slangin dope to those niggas in Missouri 
Bagets on our jewlry, futures no longer blurry 
And if you see a bitch with us fo sho she's temporary 
And you know we got it like that 
Rolexed out the game spotin croca sacks 
Nigga thats what you get when you fucks with me 
The Comrads and Mack D.I.M.E. 

Chorus 

[Mack 10] 
I can leap tall buildings twist on them thangs 
I made nothing but the Cavi hits an Hoo Banged 
I set traps to make snaps from coast to coast 
And now im up to seven figures and I'm doin the most 
I watch niggas cause they shady, I pack a lil 380 
Look out for my peoples everything is all gravy 
Is Mack a cool nigga? Yeap, i guess, maybe 
Bought a bubble eyes benz for my bitch and my baby 
Always talk about the hood, cause they say that I'm a bragger 
and if yous aint a true blue, then yous a red dager 
If your girl want a thug then you know that I'm a tag her 
But if she set me up then imma have to body bag her 
lay the back down on the Chevy so the ass is a dragger 
If a bitch is at the house while im jackin Imma gag her 
Wear my clothes like a banger, so of course Imma sagger 
Plus a young nigga rollin' more stones than Mick Jagger 

Chorus
