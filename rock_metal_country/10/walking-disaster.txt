Could you validate me before you break me in,
And what you're calling a cheap shot well I took you on the chin,
It's never where you're going, It's always where you've been,
So where have you been,

And if you'd lead I blindly follow,
Down an empty street I'd lose my shadow,
I'm the sand in your hand watch me fall straight through,

I don't know why you're here or what you're after,
Talking to the, I'm the one they call the walking disaster,
Fell straight through, I took one step forward and fell straight backwards,
On the move, I'm the one they call the walking disaster,
It's just stupid noise,

Could you recreate me, I need a thicker skin,
And this soul you walked on baby is slowly wearing thin,
Could you elevate me so I can feel the wind,
Feel the wind,

And if you bleed the sharks will find you,
Lying underneath all that defines you,
I'm the sand in your hand watch me fall straight through,

I don't know why you're here or what you're after,
Talking to the, I'm the one they call the walking disaster,
Fell straight through, I took one step forward and fell straight backwards,
On the move, I'm the one they call the walking disaster,
It's just stupid noise,

I'm lost in the shadow hours,
Once theirs you know it won't be ours,
We fight but we fight to no avail,
We claim our life has gotten stale,
Hands free and nothing less the fear,
It's just me testing the atmosphere,
I'm testing the atmosphere,

I don't know why you're here or what you're after,
Talking to the, I'm the one they call the walking disaster,
Fell straight through, I took one step forward and fell straight backwards,
On the move, I'm the one they call the walking disaster,
It's just stupid noise,
So why are you here, and what are you after,
'Cause you talking to the walking disaster,
You'll let us know
