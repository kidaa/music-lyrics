Westside Slaughterhouse 
f/ Ice Cube, W.C. 

Mack 10 
Microphone check I.O. from the west coast beller and tella 
I cuss like a sella when you see her shes a gonna 
Moved to California blew the bitch up put the gangsta twist on 
Her sunny southern cal it never snows 
Niggas yellin' ha's and ho's we dumpin out of 64's 
When it comes to the gun play we vets 
It's west coast foe life no crew only sets 

Ice cube 
It's the dog breathen through the smog 
I'm a hog of this gangster shit 
Don of the click 
All you suckas want to dis the pacific 
But you buster niggas never get specific 
Used to love her mad cause we fucked 
Her pussy whipped bitch with no common sense 
Hip Hop started in the west 
Ice Cube bailin' through the east without a vest 

W.C 
Now as I look to my riznight and to my left 
I see motherfuckers staring like they wanna step 
So I'm grabin' my rusty screw driver 
In case I got to cut ya deeper than Vanessa Del Rio's Vagina 
Finda notha crew of niggas that can fuck with this 
Lyrical bully given verbal bruises to crews fool 
You must be on dick dope and dynamite 
How you figure speed on before you get peed on nigga 

Mack 10 
Fool what side is you 
Red or the blue 
While as the L.A. zoo it's round two 
I ignite grab the mic tight strike like a ratle bring 
Rhymes and nines to the mutherfuckin battle 
So sun down to sun up run up with my gun up 
All brakes get to pumpin' 
They know a nigga dumpin' 
You dred like a rasta when I lock like a terrier 
Mack 10 the nigga with the heat that i'll berry ya 

Ice Cube 
Oh ah,oh ah, do a walk by and watch everybody die 
Niggas into gangs thangs and narcotics 
Freak bitches riches and hydrolics 
Pull heat knock you off yo feet 
Clear thewhole block both sides of the street 
Even crips and bloods hear my thuds 
Fee fy foe fum a nigga where you from "Westside" 

W.C. 
Fuck all you niggas I'm yellin' 
This is maad circle to the fullest everybody 187um 
Toons play the piano fuck a battle 
I'm socking rappers like mad man Sontiago 
'Cause you niggas ain't impressin' me plus you singin' big red records 
So nigga fuck what you tellin' me 
Sit down Jr. you couldn't see me if you wanted to 
Look ya'll it Mack 10,Cube and the double you 


Mack 10 
I just had a scrap fo the neighborhood inglewood sterotype 
Got to deal with the hype 
Known to kick back with the fat sack fuck that 
Where my gat at nigga trippin off my bulls hat 
About to let loose with the chrome tray dude 5 shots 
And I put holes in yo Bandana 
I push a Benz you still rollin' Gs 
So nigga miss me with the set trip 
And start slangin' keys 

Ice Cube 
When I say itchy citchy 
Niggas get bitchy bitchy cause they heard of ah 
Natural born murderah 
I'm like Frankenstein is spankin' time 
Layin' in the sunshine 
With only one nine 
Now who wants to bust with the never rust 
Goin' platinum plus every time I cuss 
So fuck the whole world black niggas 
Better hope I don't grow my jeri curl back 

W.C. 
Steper murderah stepin' out a Chevrolet 
Sportin' a beenie like Marvin Gaye 
Stalkin' walkin' in my big black chuck's 
Standin' t'all in your freestyle session holdin' my balls 
I'm peepin' game like a ref in '95 
'Cause niggas be foul and biten other niggas styles 
But if you're biten this you better bring a dentist 
'Cause sucking these balls ah give yo ass lock jaws 

Mack 10 
Which way shall I go nigga what should I do 
Should I bang with the red should I truce with the blue 
Should I rock dope beats grab the mic and stay down 
Or should I shoot out of town and flip this pound 
Shit I never knew that my nuts ah get bigger 
Checkin' major figures I'm hangin with platinum niggas 
It's Mack 10 and I'm inglewood swangin 
No time fo bangin' 
But still got my cackeys hangin' 

Ice Cube 
Fuck one love it's the bloody glove killin' honkey hoes 
Leaving blood stains on Broncos 
In a Hertz rental I drive on the 405 
Is he dead or alive 
Motherfuckin court took another snort 
Jumpin' over chairs as I run through the airport 
So I can catch a flight away from the drama 
Number 32 chillin' in the Bahamas 

W.C. 
Sucky ducky quack niggas ain't knowin' how to act 
Sucka ducks play the back 
Nigga use to dis now it's turning around and like Brandy 
Motherfuckers wanna be down 
With this west coast rap game I can give a fuck 
If you wasn't down at first you can buck these nuts 
Transformers get stole on boom BOOOM 
Get the picture killa cali home of the body bags nigga
