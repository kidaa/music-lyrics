Broken shoulders resting on my back
Overloaded with a weighed stack
Higher and higher
Time runs tired

Silence falls into the deafening
Sirens of my own epiphany
Silence falls into the deafening
Sirens of my own epiphany

My own mortality

Here I lie with my regrets
Possessions petty meaningless
You are my medicine
Healing me with tenderness

Don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't go

I don't know, don't go
I don't know, don't go
I don't know, don't go
I don't know what is happening

What is happening

Broken body crumbles into dust
Weight is lifted sending me with love
Higher and higher
Time expired

The siren calls, re awakening
Passing on into eternity
The siren calls, re awakening
Passing on into eternity

Cry no more for me

Crossing through
Fade into
Crossing through
Fade into
Crossing through
Fade into
Crossing through
Fade into the light

Fade into the light

Crossing through
Fade into the light
Crossing through
Fade into the light
