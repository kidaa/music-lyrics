I'm bored, I just thought I'd let you know,
That your world dragged me down like undertow once again,
Face first, I saw it all in slow mo,
Good things, they just seem to come and go like good friends, So Go,

Well I am cynical if you wanna understate,
'Cause you're right I really don't appreciate anything,
You leave, and then you start to hesitate,
Simple, then you start to complicate everything,
You can leave, 'cause I won't stop you,

You walk around like you do,
You shake your head like you knew,
Choke down the words 'til your blue,
I wouldn't talk if I were you, wouldn't talk if I were you,

It's my fault, guess I should have let you know,
Your world dragged me down like undertow once again,
It's my drink, please don't let it overflow,
Set them up I'll knock them down in a row with my friends, So Go,

Well I break down when I try to concentrate,
Ignore then you overcompensate every time,
I guess you really needed your space,
Tattooed you won't erase this face from your mind,
You can try, but will try too,

You walk around like you do,
You shake your head like you knew,
Choke down the words 'til your blue,
I wouldn't talk if I were you, wouldn't talk if I were you,

Headstrong and open wide, I always fail to see both sides,
It takes it toll on me, don't take yourself so seriously,
Headstrong and open wide, I rarely fail to see both sides,
It takes its toll on me, don't take yourself so seriously,
'Cause I never took you seriously, so go,

Well I am cynical if you wanna understate,
'Cause you're right I really don't appreciate anything,
I guess you really needed your space,
Tattooed you won't erase this face from your mind,
You can try, but will try too,

You walk around like you do,
You shake your head like you knew,
Choke down the words 'til your blue,
I wouldn't talk if I were you, wouldn't talk if I were you
