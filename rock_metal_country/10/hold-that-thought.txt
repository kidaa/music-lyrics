They put there fingers to his lips I heard them say hold that thought,
He went to war with all the demons in his head they said it wasn't his fault,

You know if you need some time well I think I can find it,
And you're going down, but I think we can fly this thing,

Heavy, all this weight is on the inside,
But we're coming clean on the outside,
I hope, I know what I have got myself into,
A straight shot, I'm a gutterfly in the dark sky,
I'm still hitting all of the red lights,
I know, I hope that I will burn in your afterglow,

Hand in hand I walked the ghost to the ledge, they'd love to watch me fall,
He woke up with the angels in my bed, oh my god, screaming oh my god,

And If you need some time I will buy it,
And we're going down, but I think we can fly this thing,

Heavy, all this weight is on the inside,
But we're coming clean on the outside,
I hope, I know, what I got myself into,
A straight shot I'm the butterfly into the blue sky,
I'm still hitting all of the red lights,
I hope, I know that I will burn in your afterglow,

They put their fingers to his lips I heard them say hold that thoguht,
He woke up with the angels in his bed, screaming oh my god, screaming oh my god,

Heavy, all this weight is on the inside,
But we're coming clean on the outside,
I hope, I know what I have got myself into,
Heavy, all this weight is on the inside,
I'm coming clean on the outside,
I hope I know you will not hold this againt me
