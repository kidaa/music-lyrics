Monday 28 of June we went to Amsterdam watching the world cup with all the Holland fans. We ordered some half-liter beers, expensive but didn't care cause the waitress were so fucking hot and really everywhere. We were waiting for NOFX, for the great show, don't know a lot anymore but awesome I still know. After, we ate some crappy food next to sport caf, but I wasn't really hungry so I went on tourney.

Hey, Hey!

I saw three girls standing there with one guy all alone, one girl looked like Julia Roberts, I said I really like you!. But she didn't really understand cause she was Indonesian, but there was a second plan her girlfriend did the translation. Next day I tried to call but getting no responds so we went to the red-light district cause we have never been there before. A friend really wanted to but didn't really dare, so we paid for him the entry, we don't fucking care.

Hey, Hey!
