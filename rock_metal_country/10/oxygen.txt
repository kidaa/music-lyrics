Standing at my door,
You float like smoke across my floor,
'Cause you're in the air,
Your chemicals are everywhere,
You flow throw me,
Sound waves and energies,
I channeled in your frequencies,
And your static electricities,
And you're so pure that way, Yeah 'cause you're so perfect that way,

I don't care I'm in the calm watching waves roll over me,
Uncover you, over me, hovering,
Blues and grays begin to fade in neon skies and clouded eyes,
The sun begins to break, it's your beautiful face,
And I don't know if these are the answers to questions,
Of loneliness, emptiness, loss of direction or the resolution to my deprivation,
'Cause I found oxygen in you, I breathe you like oxygen, I do,

And I love to watch you sleep,
Roll over steal the sheets,
Your body beckons me,
Sleep tightly in those dreams,
Yeah 'cause you're so pure that way, yeah 'cause you're perfect that way,

I don't care I'm in the calm watching waves roll over me,
Uncover you, over me, hovering,
Blues and grays begin to fade in neon skies and clouded eyes,
The sun begins to break, it's your beautiful face,
And I don't know if these are the answers to questions,
Of loneliness, emptiness, loss of direction or the resolution to my deprivation,
'Cause I found oxygen in you, I breathe you like oxygen, I do,

In and out, in and out of your reality,
Oh you're in the air, you don't know but you love to breathe
In and out, weightless gravity,
Oh you're in the air with every breathe you love to save me
And I don't know if these are the answers to questions,
Of loneliness, emptiness, loss of direction or the resolution to my deprivation,
Don't cut me off no, you don't know but you love to breathe me, no don't
