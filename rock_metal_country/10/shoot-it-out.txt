Shoot it, shoot it out 'cause they want it, want it now, now
Shoot it, shoot it out 'cause they want it, want it now

Shoot it, shoot it out 'cause they want it, want it now, now
Shoot it, shoot it out 'cause they want it, want it now

Shoot it, shoot it out 'cause they want a little more
You can be rest assured
You give them all you got and you give them a little more
And never even know what for

They feed and they suck until you're unconscious
It's never enough, they kill your subconscious

I'm ready to die

Will you kill what's left of me to stop the bleeding?
Shoot it, shoot it out 'cause they want it, want it now, now
Shoot it, shoot it out 'cause they want it, want it now, now
Suffocate integrity till I'm not breathing
Shoot it, shoot it out 'cause they want it, want it now, now
Shoot it, shoot it out 'cause they want it, want it now

Feed them, fucking starve them, keep begging a little more
Feed them, fucking starve them, keep begging a little more

Feed them, fucking starve them, keep begging a little more
I'm not gonna be your whore
Load it, cock it, pull it, refuse to be ignored
I'm not gonna fight your war

All the distractions kill the compassion
Suddenly fame has lost its attraction

I'm ready to die

Will you kill what's left of me to stop the bleeding?
Shoot it, shoot it out 'cause they want it, want it now, now
Shoot it, shoot it out 'cause they want it, want it now, now
Suffocate integrity till I'm not breathing
Shoot it, shoot it out 'cause they want it, want it now, now
Shoot it, shoot it out 'cause they want it, want it now

Feeding the wolves, don't you know better?
Feeding the wolves, the taste of blood is bitter

Feeding the wolves, you're feeding the wolves
Feeding the wolves, don't you know better?
Feeding the wolves, you're feeding the wolves
Feeding the wolves, the taste of blood is bitter

Will you kill what's left of me to stop the bleeding?
Shoot it, shoot it out 'cause they want it, want it now, now
Shoot it, shoot it out 'cause they want it, want it now, now
Suffocate integrity till I'm not breathing
Shoot it, shoot it out 'cause they want it, want it now, now
Shoot it, shoot it out 'cause they want it, want it now

Shoot it, shoot it out 'cause they want it, want it now, now
Shoot it, shoot it out 'cause they want it, want it now!
