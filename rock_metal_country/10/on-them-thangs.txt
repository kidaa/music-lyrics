On Them Thangs 

When in the streets I keep my heat on my seat, no doubt about it 
It's my Afrikan express I don't leave home without it 
Summertime just ain't known for the weather 
It's hot cause niggas bring out shit they put together 
13 to 14 7's can't miss 
But on some shit you got to let 15-8's twist 
Chevy trucks and 'em 
El Caminos anybody want Danas i got them for eight ?????? 
All day long 
Gold or all chrome it's on 
You out to get 'em cause the tires come with 'em 
but they ain't for busters only hogs roll D's 
So keep yo' stocks on if you can't fade these 
Thousand in my pocket, yayo I rock it 
Keep my lond clean so the car hops can jock it hit the switch up and down 
Make the bumper drag the ground on the 'Shaw 
Every Sunday night just to clown on them thangs 

Get the hammer 
Be sure that yo strap ain't a jammer and as long 
As ain't nuthin' wrong then beat I'm on 
As I watch for the lick i got the switch to make me hit 
Front back side to side and three wheel shit 
Won't hesitate to let loose niggas broke the gang truce 
But I still roll my deuce that hang like a noose 
It don't stop for Mack, it's the same ol' same ol' 
Danas gold as I lay low, twisting like a tornado 
in that surplus gear like the G of the year 
Fuck the hour, it's all about the money and the power 
Ain't about set trippin' no bloodin' no crippin' 
Just dippin' hittin' switches knockin' hood rat bitches 
As I'm rollin' out of control and smoking humps 
Crank up the bumptie bumps 4 gates and square 
Dumps so I bang it, make the 20's slide when I swang it 
Lick it once lick it twice as nice 
when I hang it on them thangs 

D's I'm on 'em 
Killas they want 'em 
On them thangs... 

Old Chevy's to Cadillacs on twisters and Doves 
Everybody got a plaque given pub to they car club 
Mafia for life individuals and Damus Ride 
Majestics and them niggas from the southside 
New school to old school get they ride on 
Bendin' corners caravaning like 50 strong 
In a Rag Top that and a hard top this 
Bustin ho's cause you can't miss if you let 'em twist 
So get you a set of them what we call Dana's 
And see for yo'self all the bitches they brang us 
cut the wheel right to left and make the ass end slide 
Now all the riders ride and skate from side to side 
On them thangs
