Coming home is how it feels when I open up the door, 
the smell of burning cigarettes, drunk guys falling on the floor.
Looking at the table, fully filled with beer,
ready to get drunk, cuz all my friends are here.

Singing, skanking with the band, yeah everyone here's my friend,
playing cards, playing chess, alcohol games it's a mess.
Keep on going, keep on drinking, we turn of the light,
the bottles are not empty yet, so drink drink drink.

Going to the bar and have a couple of drinks, I don't want no cocktails, cuz I think that shit stinks.
Take another round till we're full and drunk, but Bennie keeps on skanking, cuz he's a fucking punk.

Going home in the middle of the night worked ourselves into a fight,
we were drunk, but we were right, they faced the cops headlight.
I can not believe, this guy is not a thief, but when they drink
they becoming a disease, that's why I lost one of my teeth

My head is getting this thing, all those nights are killing me,
wondering what the next will bring but this rhythm keeps me singing.
I woke up but not alone, I brought that girl to my home,
it is almost afternoon a new night is coming soon.
