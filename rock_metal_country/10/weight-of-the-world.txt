I used to carry the weight of the world
And now all I wanna do is spread my wings and fly
I don't know why I was so afraid... all the time
Memories seemed to bother me.. my whole life
I used to carry the weight of the world
And now all I wanna do is spread my wings and fly
I used to carry the weight of the world
And now all I wanna do is spread my wings and fly
I don't know why I was so ashamed
Such a waste of time
And I don't know who I was trying to be
All those lies
I used to carry the weight of the world
And now all I wanna do is spread my wings and fly
I used to carry the weight of the world
And now all I wanna do is spread my wings and fly
Oh and there's always something
Or somebody right behind
Well we're not meant to be everything
We're just a piece
So spread your wings 
Oh I don't know why I was so afraid all the time
I used to carry the weight of the world
And now all I wanna do is spread my wings and fly...
