You and I share the same reflection
why dont you see that we cannot survive in this condition
If you're cut, I'll bleed
So go on carve into your heart, I could use a new scar or a brand new start
Slowly severing the only memories that bind us as one.

I just dont know
How to win with you
And I cant let go, part of me is you.

We have lost all communication when words fall on deaf ears
I'm starting to feel a transformation.
How did I get here?
I dont recognize my own reflection its a ghost of what once was
Gone from relative to stranger, separating body from mind

I just dont know 
How to win with you
And I cant let go, part of me is you.

You stay the same 
Allowing me to change

I just dont know
How to win with you
I cant let go, part of me is you.

I just dont know, just dont know.
I cant let go, cant let go.
