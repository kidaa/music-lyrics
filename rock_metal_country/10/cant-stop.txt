Verse 1 Mack 
You see I can't stop I won't stop 
'til I check a mil I need a super bad bitch 
and a house on the hill 
365 7days I believe crack pays 
my estates been guarded by pit bulls and AK's 
I'm straight cookin' them thangs 
movin' weight like I should 
'Cause a nigga livin' good 
don't mean he went Hollywood 
Dog I practice my craft 
so each year I get better 
to stay ghetto and clever 
but be richer than ever 

E-40 Fonzerelli man I thought you was a rebel 
I am but tell me this then 
why you move up out the ghetto the ghetto 
Mothafucka I am the ghetto 
I beg yo pardon 
Nigga I was grindin' tryin to take off niggas heads 
flossin'   fuckin' hoes when you was in kindergarten 
Nigga this ain't Lenny and Squiggy 
this E-Feezee   Mack Teezee 
Fuckin' with Italian Romaine pasta chicken Tortellini 
Thirty odd six custodian, with the scope 
far from Nickelodeon no shit no joke 
Southern Cali up North see we be rollin' 
Make a bitch purchase a gun 
report it stolen 
Plead the 5th but don't snitch 
no case 'cause they're po po 
and they mami know that 12 gage equipment can be traced 
Stand on ya bunions 
Nigga don't try to get caught in his drawers 
'Cause them 2.2.3's be penetratin' through walls 
Plus I got warrants and shit 
didn't pay child support 
Thinkin' about skippin' town 
movin' to Shreveport. 
Bitch 

Chorus 
Mack 10 You see I can't stop I won't stop 
'til I check a mil' 
I need a super bad bitch and a house on the hill 
E-40 From L.A. to the Yay see we be rollin' 
Make a bitch purchase a gun report it stolen 
Mack 10You see I can't stop I won't stop 
'til I check a mil'

Verse 2 
Mack 10 Forty I'm the one bro that's in the mix like gumbo 
now how can I stay humble 
and make feddy by the bundle 
Marv said we got bigger triggas 
Mack we got bigger figures 
now throw the top back on the 'Rarri 
and bang gears on these niggas 
and watch what the money show you 
about niggas that don't know you 
Busters is gone hate 
real G's is happy foe ya 
It's Mack Dime on the grind 
fool it's my time to shine 
now would you niggas kick back 
and let me get mine 
E-40 Causin' havoc sparkin' up chaos 
bringin' the ruckus heavy metal heaters 
mobb, under buckets 
If ya can't beat us 
then join us get on the team 
Streetsweepers grenades rifles 
and M1 car beams 
Dice games craps bets over car titles 
pink slips cash money 
Watchin' out for rival gang members beefin' 
bad weather but it all boils down to 
who got the most paper 

Chorus 

Verse 3 
Mack 10 I shoot 'em up like syringes 
I know what real ends is 
Lo lo's Harley Davis and big body Benzes 
ain't been faded so far on my wrist 
I got a R hundred thousand dollar car 
'cause I push the caviar 
So what's up what you need everybody huddle up 
got that 2 for 1 special with the rock called double up 
so get lit take a hit shop is open all day 
from L.A. to the Bay it's Mack 10   E-Fortaay 
E-40 Sometimes I wonder if it's worth this 
fuckin' with the law tryna make it look like 
I'm runnin' a legitimate tow truck service 
with a Just Say No to Drug bumper sticker 
on the back window back window 
knowin' I been smokin' a gang of Indo 
around the corner four houses down across the way way 
make a right and then a left 
over there by Safeway and when ya get there page me 
punch in how much you wanna spend 
seperate the 20's from the 1's 5's and 10's 
Slick sly sharp narcotic vendors 
always do business in shopping centers 
Buck 'em stick 'em stuck 'em don't ever fuck me 
hate 'em bleed 'em love 'em shit can get ugly 

Chorus 

Hoo bang hoo ride 2X 
Hoo ride hoo bang 
Who be ridin' who be bangin' Westside Ride Nigga
