When I walked in no heads turned around,
It was clear to me that the word had gone around,
People stand talking to the ground,
And it's so damn loud and I can't hear a sound,
I look around there's nowhere to escape,

It's times like these I wish I had my superpowers,
I would fly, get away from here,
And its time like these I had my superpowers,
I will freeze time and disappear, run away from here,

Slowly I walk through this crowd,
To see her face a little less proud,
If the walls could talk they'd tell me to run,
And not to stop until I hit the sun,
She wouldn't have it any other way,

It's times like these I wish I had my superpowers,
I would fly away from here,
And its time like these I had my superpowers,
I will freeze time and disappear, run away from here,

Oh I've been wasting all of my breath saying I'm sorry,
Run away from you, and away from here,

It's times like these I wish I had my superpowers,
I would fly, get away from here,
And its time like these I had my superpowers,
I will freeze time and disappear, run away from here, disappear
