Faith, fact or fiction, now what is the difference?
Were all just searching for the lie
Dividing nations from confrontations
Havent you seen that the blind lead the blind?

Were a moment in time
In the cycle of life
Were just a moment in time
In the cycle of life

Without dedication theres self medication
Were all just searching for the lie
Communication was lost in translation
Havent you seen that the blind lead the blind?

Were a moment in time
In the cycle of life
Were just a moment in time
In the cycle of life

This is just a cycle of
The life that we are all part of
This is just a cycle of
The life that we are all part of

This is just a cycle of
The life that we are all part of
This is just a cycle of
The life that we are all part of
This is just a cycle of
The life that we are all part of
This is just a cycle of
The life that we are all part of

Were a moment in time
In the cycle of life
Were just a moment in time
In the cycle of life

Were a moment in time
In the cycle of life
Were just a moment in time
In the cycle of life
