You arrived at my doorstep, brought in with the tide,
You told them that you're coming, but I bet you lied,
Mr. Distance couldn't chain you down, but you know he'll try,
I let you in, but you took me inside,

And now I'm falling for you that's the best I can do because I'm clumsy,
I wanted to wait, then I got a taste, now I'm hungry,
I wanted to be what you think you see, but I'm nothing,
Then I caught a glare in your two-second stare now I'm something,
Oh no, oh how you came a live

Polished bottles of wine and an empty pizza box,
You stand there naked only in your socks,
The nonbelievers they can't stop us now, but you know they'll try,
Lock the doors and the windows just to keep them outside,

And now I'm falling for you that's the best I can do because I'm clumsy,
I wanted to wait, then I got a taste, now I'm hungry,
I wanted to be what you think you see, but I'm nothing,
Then I caught a glare in your two-second stare now I'm something,

Oh no, oh how you came alive,
Mr. Distance couldn't chain you down, but you know he'll try,
I let you in, but you took me inside,

And now I'm falling for you that's the best I can do because I'm clumsy,
I wanted to wait, then I got a taste, now I'm hungry,
I wanted to be what you think you see, but I'm nothing,
Then I caught a glare in your two-second stare now I'm something,
And now I'm falling for you that's the best I can do because I'm clumsy,
I wanted to wait, then I got a taste, now I'm hungry,
Oh no, oh how you came alive,
Underneath all that you are, all of the candlelight
