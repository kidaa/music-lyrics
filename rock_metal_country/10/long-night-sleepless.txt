She put an eviction note on the doorframe of her heart
What seems to melt togather just seems to shatter apart

So watch your feelings 'cause these peices can get very sharp
You have this talent for shooting down a shooting star

And the truth of a smart-ass is that im not very smart
It's gonna be a long night
Tonight
All the planets are alined
And that sounded just right

I wanna state for the record, I didn't mean to ruin her
I didn't mean to wreck her
It's gonna be a long night
Tonight

I took a vacation from all the things I should become
'Cause drivin' the nine to five never seemed like very much fun

Look in the mirror are you recognizing anyone?
You're overrated and you're weathered but you just begun
I gotta got hands all over this, 'cause I could never stop at one

It's gonna be a long night
Tonight
All the stars are alined
And the moon is just right

I wanna state for the record, I didn't mean to ruin her
I didn't mean to wreck her
It's gonna be a long night
Tonight

And my knees are bruised
From beggin' you beggin' you
I'm beggin you beggin' you
And if you need the news
Stand in line stand in line
'Cause we're all over 
No

Are you sure you said yes just for the hell of it?
You've got one lie
What've you got to show for it?
I am a sleepwalker stuck inside a day-dream
I am just a sound-wave

It's gonna be a long night
Tonight
We've got our hands in the air
And the room's just right

I wanna state for the record, I didn't mean to ruin her
I didn't mean to wreck her

I had to be the song she couldn't shake from her head

It's gonna be a long night
Tonight
