'cause here comes the G. Foe Liiife!! 

 Mack> 
Uhh that's right uhh yeah ha ha ha ha

Verse 1 
It's that nigga west side swangin' 
heat I'm bringin' like I'm bangin' 
slangin' khakis hangin' 
took the script   I'm flippin' it 
got bustas straight trippin' it 
never thought Mack 10'll 
be the new nigga rippin' shit 
Real G style on a funky freestyle 
solo flo show with my bitch   my lo lo 
gettin' my floss on as I slide my locs on 
hit the corna' bitch hold on 
Danas is what I roll on 
So watch yo' step quiet it's kept on the leak 
I blast I don't stick the different nigga in the click 
as I kick rhymes niggas pick mines from the stack 
threw the roof on the sack then cut the 'lac front   back 
on all gold hundred spoke D's when I skiis 
nigga please wanna be G's don't wanna see these 
straight from killa Cali it's like the Valley of Death 
of who's left I'll be a G 'til my very last breath 

Chorus 
Alli alli all come free here comes the G  WC> 
Fresh as a new pack I'll be doper than my cavi sack 
Alli alli all come free here comes the G  WC> 
Checkin' loot like it's crazy in painter pants   Stacys 
Repeat 

Verse 2 
Now as I roll through the turf with that true G pride 
feeling high as I ride from the west to the eastside 
On them switches went from rags to riches 
all snitches must die I can't lie 
I like them hoochie bitches 
though I know that a hoe is a gamble 
scandle hard to handle them dookey braids   sandals 
That's how I like it hike it touchdown then spike it 
then pipe it so tough they can't gripe it 
So if it's on from uh dusk 'til dawn 
keep it crackin' stay packin' as long as niggas jackin' 
Mackin' like Goldie bumpin' nothin' but oldies 
reminiscin' tilt the 40's when I vibe the dead homies. 

Talking: 
Yeah I wanna say what's up to all my deceased homeboys 
from the west   eastside didn't make it to see this rap. 
Oh yeah it's still Mack 10 foe life puttin' it down like this here. 

Chorus 

Verse 3 
Down for the dirt I sport khakis and a white t-shirt 
slangin' work got the big birdies that don't chirp 
I came up from a crawler now my stack is taller 
big baller shot caller movin' shit like a U-Hauler 
So now it's on like that   I'm rollin' 
controllin' the 'hood guns about a boat swollen 
back arms tatted Inglewood so tweed can get gatted 
cavi water weed or speed what you need 'cause I have it 
So come through run through   uhh smell the vapors 
won't be no set trip if it's all about paper 
Down with the Lench Mob I can't go wrong 
well known   it's on bankin corners in my Brougham 

Chorus 

Mack 10, westside, foe life, and we out
