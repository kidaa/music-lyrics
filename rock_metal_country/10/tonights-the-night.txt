Well tonight is mine and tonight is mine 

Verse 1 
Big body Benzes Daytonas and rag 'Rarris 
killa Cali is the state and it's wild as the safari 
We hustle cook keys claim B's and C's 
and we attack like Pit Bulls and Rottweiller pedigrees 
With a Tech this Connect nigga what you expect 
Dub SCG tatooed on my neck 
as I parlay you do what you do I do what the dollar say 
I'm a street nigga punk my pistol smoke like Doc Holiday 
and I sell everythang homie now tell me what you want 
you got to have this caviar fool so don't say you don't 
Illegal or legit hit after hit I keep ya head bobbin' 
in all black like Batman give it to me or I'm robbin' 
Now what you gone do hand over the goods or do I take 'em 
now do you keep little busta niggas in ya camp 
or do ya shake 'em 
It's Mack 10 once again in ya ear like a diamond 
and while the street lights is shinin' 
all through the night I keep grindin' 

Chorus 2X 

Verse 2 
Back the fuck up 'foe I act the fuck up back the fuck up nigga 
keep makin' big heads 'til they stack the fuck up ha ha haa 
I need major scrill that's real it don't stop until then 
now watch this OG ghetto survillian check a million 
Quick fast got to have it man so I use muscle 
straight timin' dedication dog and all about hustle 
I hit ya like boom bam don't ya know who I am 
I got this shit by the bird half O-Z or the gram 
But never ever let a nigga owe you that don't know you 
and don't trust no fuckin' bitch but get one that's down foe you 
Late night to early morn' it's on in the war zone 
man life's a gamble dog if you crap out you gone 

Chorus 2X

 WESTSIIDE> Mack 10, Squeak Ru slappin' you bitch niggas 
on the ass for being the busters you present yourself to be.  That's right> 

Chorus 2X
