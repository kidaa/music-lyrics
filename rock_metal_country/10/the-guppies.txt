The Guppies 
f/ Ice Cube 

The guppies dup dup dup 
Repeat dup dup dup 3X 

Verse 1 Cube 
It's a feeding frenzy 
with guppies all around the edge 
nigga if you tryna get fed you in the red 
eat you up, beat you up 
If that don't work heat you up 
Now you wearin' white punk 
smellin' like Fahrenheit 
Niggas, fleas, ticks and parasites 
tryna get a crumb off the turntable 
Stick your nose in my bowl it's fatal 
you Kane I'm Abel 
Nigga you know we checkin' quotas and dollars 
nigga you no the pecking order we follow 
sayin' that we got to holla, if I can quote you 
But the king of the jungle never meet with the vultures 
never been a sucker never been fake never 
Never tried to make all I can make never 
Represent my niggas 'til the bow breaks 
but haters hate we can eat steak by the lake. 

Chorus 
The Guppies dup dup dup Repeat 4X 

Verse 2 Mack 
What a beautiful day, clear blue skies 
my murder ones block sunrays from my eyes 
Twistin' triple gold so I gotta pack heat 
Lay the titanium and flame up the street 
down the boulevard with my hand on trigger 
fools hittin' me up like who is that nigga 
Ruuff ruuff you know who it is 
Mack 10 punk top dog in showbiz 
I cocks the revolver ready to start gattin' 'em 
but what I look like set trippin' and I'm platinum 
I hesitates put down the trey eight 
keep pushing to the hood 
make sure my folks is straight 
Outta control a nigga ballin' like Shaq 
gave my momma money and slid the homies sacks 
And it's like that about the bank wad 
the more cheese ya got the more killas on ya squad 
for the guppies 

Chorus 

Verse 3 Cube 
Okay we hollered fake as hugs check my wallet 
driving to the crib make sure no nigga followed 
Called up the mighty one O what you wanna do 
turn these bitch niggas to snow how many 1 or 2? It's on you 
Westside battle cry my alibi first class 
hella high when you die 
I'm changin' standard time with the yuppies 
but fuck them to and you 
you askin' who  The Guppies> Mack starts at 'The Guppies' 
Brought Mack Manson back to life 
I kill niggas without a gun or a knife 
I gave the order is he dead? yep enough said 
and all my followers got W's on they forehead 
Murderers and they kill on command 
walk around like zombies with Techs in each hand 
For Mack and the Don wet you up like neon 
freeze you like freon you fuckin' peon 
The Guppies
