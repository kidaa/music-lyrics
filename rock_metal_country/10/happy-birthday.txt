Happy birthday you are not a friend, you're not getting any present. So where is the party or is this the end. Every year it's the same old song, tradition obligates me to come. I'd rather turn around and run or is it me who's wrong.

I've had it with you, show me the door, you're not interesting and I am bored. Please give me my medicine, I want more. I feel dizzy, I'm not well or please call me, save me by the bell, it is even better in the hell.

Who came up with this fucking idea, who will figure out? Yeah, probably me.
