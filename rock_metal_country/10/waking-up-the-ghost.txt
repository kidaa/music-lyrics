No one knows the secrets that I keep
No one knows what's in my head
I can't control the other side of me
I have lost my breath

Breaking the pulse of a steady beat
Pleading for sanity
The voices calling out my name
Now I'm afraid that

I, I'm waking up the ghost
Not digging up the memories that were dead to me
Now, now I'm getting close
Closer to the enemy that's inside of me

Under the skin, the soul of the guilty
Under the surface, lonely lies
Under the weight the sin is
Eating me alive

No mercy, no forgiveness
Condemn to my own hell
The voices calling out my name
Now I'm afraid that

I, I'm waking up the ghost
Not taking out the memories that were dead to me
Now, now I'm getting close
Closer to the enemy that's inside of me

Woah, woah!
Woah, woah!

I, I'm waking up the ghost
And digging up the memories that were dead to me

I am waking up the ghost
And digging up the memories that were dead to me
Now, now I'm getting close
Closer to the enemy that's inside of me

Woah, woah!
Woah, woah!
