Deep under the surface I keep the love.
Older and aware of a hidden universe.
I pray to be young and pray to be inspired.
Words of your tongue blister like fire.

I can't let you go.
Slow down don't leave.
Dying days of my youth.
Over take me.

There is a glimpse of death in your eye's.
I'm not pre paired to let out those cry's.
I plead to stay young soon will be expired.
So lost in denial.

I can't let you go.
Slow down don't leave.
Dying days of my youth.
Over take me.

Reach in her womb shelter from strived.
Baring the gifts, burdens of life.
I pray to stay young but soon will be expired.
The age of innocence long sense gone.

I can't let you go.
Slow down don't leave.
Dying days of my youth.
Over take me.

Fools who for looking back word.
Chose to live as statues frozen fracture.
Youthful laughter.
