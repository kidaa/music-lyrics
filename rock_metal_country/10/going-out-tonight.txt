I'm going out tonight
I don't know if I'll be alright
Everyone wants to hurt me
Too much danger in the city

Yeah, I have to carry a knife
Because there's people threatening my life
I can't dress just the way I want
I'm being chased by the national front

I won't fight for a cause
don't want to change the law
Leave me alone, just leave me alone
I want to get out on my own

I'm walking home tonight
I only walk where there's lots of lights
In the alleys and the doorways
Some throw a bottle right in your face
