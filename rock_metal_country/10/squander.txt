I ran into a black whole, where I lost my soul, screwed by the authority, lost myself in the society.


Yes I......... have to fix my mind, don't know where I can find, the power that overwhelms my thoughts, the power to fix my faults.

Lost my trust in humanity, chose the wrong priority, things that I can't see, punk rock always comes back to me.

Yes I......... have to fix my mind, don't know where I can find, the power that overwhelms my thoughts, the power to fix my faults.
