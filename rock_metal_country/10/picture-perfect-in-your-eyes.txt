Maybe I a product of my placement.
Given no doubt to make up our minds.

Pay attention please.
He who lusts through life for excess in this world.
Dies a lonely man, careless of his soul.
Throwing caution to the wind with foolish ignorance.
You're full of pride.
And in arrogance you can't accept the nearing end of this short lived life.

Smile and give a toast, brag and boast.
Fool the world with all of your lies.
The parasite's host never even knows.
Pull the wool over our eyes.

Walk the line and pay the price.
A pound of flesh for paradise.
Wear the wounds of your demise.

Fail to mention your intentions, fail to mention why.
The actions of your life contradict your words...
The path in which you walk is a vice of no remorse.
Washing conscience from the skin, claiming innocence.
Ignore the signs.

From cradle to grave, you chose to trade.
A pound of flesh for paradise.
Wear the wounds of your demise.
