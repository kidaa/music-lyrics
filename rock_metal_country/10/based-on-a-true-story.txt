Verse 1 
Either the thrill of victory or the agony of defeat 
you either got ends or struggle to make ends meet 
You can either turn square or keep the mind of a rebel 
some uppity livin' good some faced with death in the ghetto 
I'm a product of the streets so I vow to never slip 
so I trust no one and keep a P. Coltrane on my hip 
I always paid attention while my O.G's was teachin' 
Rule number one if it's on blast the first nigga reachin' 
either death or the pen' shit I had to do better 
It was a must I moved on and now I'm all about cheddar 
a young entrepreneur I rather slang than bang 
now girls be like you go Mack 10 baby do yo thang 
So I continue to get down and I keep writin' rhymes 
and I parlay every dollar to flip at least a hundred times 
So keep your game tight and it's all fame and glory 
and everything I recite's Based On A True Story 

Chorus  "Story" sung in background throughout> 
You can feel nigga 
It's based on a true story 
You know it's real nigga 
Based on a true story 

Verse 2 
The year 1986 is when it all started 
now eleven years later we still rough and cold hearted 
and as the saga continues I ride the wave like a Sea Doo 
not to knock hip hop but gangsta rap is what we do 
Niggas on they first album 
already sold a mil' 
So before you knock our style 
at least admit that it's real 
It's all sex drugs and violence 
so you pretend you ain't checkin' 
You mean to tell me people 
really ain't dyin' every second 
Now y'all made the rules 
niggas can say what they choose 
So if you gone ban Gangsta rap 
then you got to ban the news 
That means no weather report 
no Waco and the bad reverand 
No channel 4 channel 7 and no film at eleven 
With no high school diplomas we became millionaires 
media mad 'cause we winning and we really playin' fair 
So keep your game tight and it's all fame and glory 
and everything I recite's Based On A True Story 

Chorus 

Verse 3 
I crumble green on a magazine 
ready to roll a joint 
damn in this billboard 
I'm number one with a hollow point 
It was a rough road ahead 
but for my kids I gotta pave it 
so I twist one shake the weed out 
close the book up and save it 
'Cause my son li'l Mack 
might grow up and have a crew 
and he can show all his homies 
this what my daddy used to do 
See I was raised around gangstas 
and grindas since a youth 
so the shit I rap abouts like 99% truth 
With dedicated fans from bebe kids 
to bambinos and niggas that's CEO's 
before they reach they three O's 
Maneuver through the corporate world 
makin' moves to take ours 
Rolling big German luxury and Italian sports cars 
so watch what you do 'cause you know we playa hated 
and everytime it's a homicide they call it gang related 
So keep your game tight and it's all fame and glory 
and everything I recite's Based On A True Story 

Chorus 2X 

Too $hort talking: Say Mack baby, it's yo pa'tna $hort dog man. 
You know I got yo back boy. You know a nigga like me I just left 
the Ferrarri dealer man. I ain't go lie I know you ridin' rims. 
But the problem is, it's a lot of mothafuckas out there that think we 
rappers man. That think we just sit at home and make this up at 
our momma's house. I hate to tell y'all man some of us are real playas 
real ballers biitch.
