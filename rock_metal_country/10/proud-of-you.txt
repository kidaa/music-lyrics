Shadows set mood.
Innocence left the room.
And all I know to do.
Is shed a tear for you.

Oh, oh, oh, oh...

Please don't be ashamed whether you win or lose.
I just want you to know that I'm proud of you.
Don't be afraid when your fight is through.
I just need you to know that I'm here with you.

I can't watch you choose.
To pour salt in your wounds.
Now all I know to do.
Is say a prayer for you.

Oh, oh, oh, oh...

Please don't be ashamed whether you win or lose.
I just want you to know that I'm proud of you.
Don't be afraid when your fight is through.
I just need you to know that I'm here with you.
