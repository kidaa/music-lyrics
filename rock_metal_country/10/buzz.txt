When I am waiting for the bus, don't want to see them, when I am waiting for the bus won't them around.

When I am waiting at the station, taking a look around, smoking a cigarette, hearing the punk rock sound. 15 buses driving on and off, looking to chicks who never would been loved.

Every second watching on the clock, thinking all the time, yeah what the fuck, when I'm rhyming words to making a rap, I see that boy standing there with his stupid cap.
