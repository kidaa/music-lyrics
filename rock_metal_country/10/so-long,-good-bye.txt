Keep changing your mind.
Like clouds in the sky.
Love me when your high.
Leave me when you cry.
I know it all takes time.
Like a river running dry when the suns to bright.

So long this is good-bye.
Maybe we'll meet again in another life.
Like strangers passing by.
Maybe we'll see clearly in a different light.

Keep dodging lights.
Like a thief in the night.
The sun will rise and expose all the lies.
So why deny that you and I lead different lives.
The rivers from your eye's can't change my mind.

So long this is good-bye.
Maybe we'll meet again in another life.
Like strangers passing by.
Maybe we'll see clearly in a different light.

Ohh...
The rivers from your eye's can't change my mind.

So long this is good-bye.
Maybe we'll meet again in another life.
Like strangers passing by.
Maybe we'll see clearly in a different light.
