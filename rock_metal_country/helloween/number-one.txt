Each time when one more year was over
You refused to hear heaven's bell sounds
And the hapiness in your heart's been set lower
You're searching for friends
But no one seemed to be 'round

You merely should think of the good times
'Cos there are so many ways you can go
Take a look at yourself
You're still very young
And big aims always take very long

Now it's time for hapiness
Stay hard and trust your fate
Don't forget you're something else
You'll never be to late
Trust your father's mighty spell
You'll never be alone
Fate will always turn out well
And you'll be number one

Shout at the world don't care what they say
'Cos your life is now, here and today
Luck is there, ev'rywhere
Go on reap it's goods, that's the way
You wanna have truth relief from your pain
But life takes its tool again and again
Don't fear the night
Your future is pay
And the tracks to your aims are laid

Now it's time for hapiness
Stay hard and trust your fate
Don't forget you're something else
You'll never be to late
Trust your father's mighty spell
You'll never be alone
Fate will always turn out well
And you'll be number one

Now it's time for hapiness
Don't forget you're something else
Trust your father's mighty spell
Fate will always turn out well
