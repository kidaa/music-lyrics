Too late to call for the priest
He is not here anymore
We look at the age of the beast
and we've seen its vast armies forms
Hear our call

Please, save us
Please, save us

In permanent madness we live
no time for life and for love
To take is the rule, not to give
Insanity commes from below
To take us all

Please, save us
Please, save us

We belive that the phenomena of nature
Are the expression of infinite inteligence
we express our belief that all forms of life
are manifestations of spirit
Ans thus, all man are childrens of God

Far from down below and thus, 
prepare to take us all
Waiting for his future
and a fighting call

We stand in the edge of the world
just one step more and we fall
Guide us and please take our hands
without you we will came alone

Please, save us
Please, save us. Now!

Save us! From the gods of thunder
Save us! From the gods of death
Save us! From the creapin'nightmare
Save us! From the evil storm
Save us! From all ignorance
Save us! From the Madam black
Save us! From the desolation
Save us! From the made attack
Oh, please save us now!
