Mrs. God, am I right?
That's your real address?
This time it's you
Ready to confess?
Free the masculine world
Cancel their humility

Mrs. God, can it be?
Can you be alike
One dressed to kill?
Walk on, high-heeled bride
This would state and explain
Why men are sometimes stumbling

Mrs. God are you there
Laughing at us is not fair
Mrs. God can't you see
All that shit you've done to me and us

Mrs. God, may I say
As wild card of my kind
We were so deceived yeah
You'd better left us blind

Mrs. God we are cool
We take it with a smile
But don't be cruel
Let's add it to the file
And in some 100 years
God has always had beard

Mrs. God are you there
Laughing at us is not fair
Mrs. God can't you see
All that shit you've done to me and us
