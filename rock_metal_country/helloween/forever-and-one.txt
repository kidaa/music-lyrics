M&L; - Deris

What can I do?
Will I be getting through?
Now that I must try
to leave it all behind

Did you see
What you have done to me
So hard to justify
Slowly is passing by

Forever and one
I will miss you 
However, I kiss you
yet again
Way down in Neverland
So hard I was triyng
Tomorrow I'll still be crying
How could you hide 
your lies, your lies

Here I am
Seeing you once again
My mind's so far away
My heart's so close 
to stay
Too proud to fight
I'm walking back into night
Will I ever find
Someone to believe?

Forever and one
I will miss you 
However, I kiss you
yet again
Way down in Neverland
So hard I was trying
Tomorrow I'll still be crying
How could you hide your lies
your lies
