They're spending millions for your thrill
Collective desperate overkill
Wrapped up in harmless words than grin
Forbidden games you'll never win
The more you see, the more you know
Intended media mind control
shut down and see how beautiful life can be
This is the prime if your lifetime
You see through eyes of someone else
More than a half of your lifetime
Is just a tale in a storybook

Push, enforce you independence
Push your real intention
Face your unconscious addiction
Push your private fiction
Push

It't getting sticker frame by frame
You're always staring at the same
What is a lie, what is the truth?
Incredible disgusting news
The world is rought, the end is near
Just calculation with your fear Without a shame nor least respect
The operators stand erect

This is the prime of your lifetime
You see through eyes of someone else
More than a half of your lifetime
Is just a tale in a storybook

Push, enforce you independence
Push your real intention
Face your unconscious addiction
Push your private fiction
Push
