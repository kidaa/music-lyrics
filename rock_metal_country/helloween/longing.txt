Feelings come and go - I've never known
Something longs to grow - won't let go
Spirits 'round my heod- are whispering
I turn inside instead - of wondering

Deep inside of me - I know there's got to be
A different kind of truth - that sets the spirit fee
If I don't wanna know - What's written inside me
How could I see anything - How could I be anything?

Restless minds have searched - long before
The truth will be the same - for evermore
The mightiness of trees - that you can feel
Can give you all you need - just listen still

Here is love and there is pain, 
it's all around, it's allthe same
There's nothing new that I could tell to you

But still there is the universe 
inside of us that neverbursts
We might not know the meaning yet, 
but I am sure we can't reject
The truth that is in everything - that is and has
Been and will be

There is long way to go - t
here is a high place to know
There is a world to go through - but there's so much 
More to do, until we're home!

Deep inside of me - I know there's got to be
A different kind of truth - that sets the spirit fee
If I don't wanna know - What's written inside me
How could I see anything - How could I be anything?

Feelings come and go - I've never known...
