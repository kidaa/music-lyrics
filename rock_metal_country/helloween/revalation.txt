Now we chase the end of time
Afraid of what we will find
Once again since Jesus christ
The stars look down on mankind

Revelation
Overcome creation
False illusions
Fade and die
Whatever we awaited
Charity or hatred
Whatever we awaited
Will arise
It's revelation
Revelation

Power and prosperity
It won't be like before
Name, rank and authority
Not counting any more

Revelation
Overcome creation
False illusions
Fade and die
Whatever we awaited
Charity or hatred
Whatever we awaited
Will arise
It's revelation
Revelation

Bemoan your words
Bemoan your deeds
Repent your thoughts of lies
Attain your sword
Attain your shield
Defend the sense of life
Bemoan your hate
repent your greed
Improve your rotten seed

Pray for the child
Thought born just by a fraund
and a whole
Pray for the child
Who won't know
what's crying for

Revelation
Overcome creation
False illusions
Fade and die
Whatever we awaited
Charity or hatred
Whatever we awaited
Will arise
It's revelation
Revelation
