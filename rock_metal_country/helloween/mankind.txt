Here is a mankind 
so proud of achievement
There is a stone
That is warmer than you

Look how we stand
in the stream of illusuons
No one says a word

Here you live
And there you cry
All that makes you move

There's no tear for anything
Anything but you

Animals dying for our vanity
Our world is
A beautiful place to be free

Drinking the blood 
Of the weak is so easy
No one hears them cry

Here you cheat
And there you lie
All that makes you gain

One day we will face His throne
There's nothin' we can say

Prosperity, luxury
Fast food is rising
It's the rainforest that dies

Here you live
And there you cry
All that makes you move

There's no tear for anything
Anything but you

Here you cheat
And there you lie
All that makes you gain

One day we will face His throne
There's nothin' we can say
