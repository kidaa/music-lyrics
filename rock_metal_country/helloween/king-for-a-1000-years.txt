Wouldn't it be nice
To plunder with your eyes
Whatever there's for you to see
Is yours to be
Let me be there
Just tell me you don't care
Just say you pay me afterlife
However high the price

I know your secrets
I know it all

I know your secrets
I see the hidden without light
I am your sickness
Bitting you right behind your eyes
Don't try to kill me
I cannot die, a death you know
You and I will be
Heaven above and hell below

Brother, believe me
Father, conceive me
Perceive me

Time will be a turning wheel
We shove or retard
Time will a toy
Time we will enjoy
Say you want to live forever
Minus one day
Say you will obey and I

I will show - I will show
I will show your Reich of gold
And I will show - I will show
I will show you friend and foe

Wouldn't it be nice
To reign and to decide
Whatever there's attracting you
Will give its due to you
Let me be there
Just say you want to share
A power no one will withstand
Just be my human hand

I know your secrets
You want it all

I will show - I will show
I will show you Reich of gold
And I will show - I will show
I will show you friend and foe

Alienation, elimination, chaos, no exoneration
No believers, all deceivers, no illusion, executions

[Melody: Sascha]

We are King For A 1000 Years
We are king of a million tears
We're the ones who bring desire
Binding their greed and fears
We are king of fallen men
We are keepers of the damned
Turning hope into obsession
We are the king
We are The King For A 1000 Years

Ages of fire - Aeon of darkness, fear and hate
Wake up my creatures
Stand up you bringers of man's fate
No one can kill us
We cannot die, a death one knows
Mankind is sleeping
My victory near, their end so close

I know their secrets
I know it all

[Solo: Both / Sascha / Weiki]

Goodbye sorrows
Borrow me your hand to turn the key
Release me - Believe me
Goddbye sorrows
Never more you have to fear futurity
Goodbye sorrows
Borrow me your hand to turn the key
Conceive me

Time will be a turning wheel
We shove or retard
Time will a toy
Time we will enjoy
Say you want to live forever
Minus one day
Say you will obey and I

I will show - I will show
I will show your Reich of gold
And I will show - I will show
I will show you friend and foe

We are King For A 1000 Years
We are king of a million tears
We're the ones who bring desire
Binding their greed and fears
We are king of fallen men
We are keepers of the damned
Turning hope into obsession
We are the king
We are The King For A 1000 Years
