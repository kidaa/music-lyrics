Can you imagine someone being true
Turn 'round and put himself in front of you
Sometimes it's fun
But then you never know
How far a thing like this might go

All my life I've 
waited for a chance to
get right out of here 
and when I had it in my hands
I could not let it go

We've got the power
We are divine
we have the guts to follow the sign
extracting tensions from sources unknown
We are the ones to cover the throne

Thy if you can to come where we have gone
You may achieve what can't be simply done
look back and there
you are where we have been
and still there's so 
much in between

All those years I've
travelled around this world now 
I am standing here
To make you sing these tunes 
and know they'll never
let you go

We've got the power
We are divine
we have the guts to follow the sign
extracting tensions from sources unknown
We are the ones to cover the throne
