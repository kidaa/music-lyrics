I've got that fever
Burning in my head
So many mmories
No tear to shed
Burns like a fire
Who stole my aims
My comrade fighters
Been set astray

How could I know
What others had in mind for me
How could be
What measures I take

Sole survivor of a kill without alert
Sing your feelings
Out your song remains unheard

We share like brothers
A light in the black
Totaly blended
Bold and erect
But we've grown intrigers
'till it's to late
Time has brought fire
fear greed and hate

Now I'm crying
I shatted on the ground
All I find
Has died anyway

Sole survivor of a kill without alert
Sing your feelings
Out your song remains unheard
Sole souvivor got a voice without a sound
mean mistreaters took away your ground

Now I'm crying
I shatted on the ground
All I find
Has died anyway

Sole survivor of a kill without alert
Sing your feelings
Out your song remains unheard
Sole souvivor got a voice without a sound
mean mistreaters took away your ground
