Well, I think it's really time
again for a revolution
Not to destroy at all costs but have 
a look at what is there

Can you remember a time when
water was sill water
Or are you too young to even know
what we won't give to our heirs

Inhale the bless of science through your lungs
skin and brain!
It'll surly make our cildren feel
a lot more sane!

Revolution now!
Revolution now!

I was born when April guaranteed a
sexual renaissance
And today we're all faced with death,
rubbers and AIDS

In '68 some people went out
to fight for freedom
They would never ever have through
that their children wear lies

And if you come to San Francisco
You're gonna meet some
broken people there

Revolution now!
Revolution now!
