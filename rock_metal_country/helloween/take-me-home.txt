Now I'm here all alone
Takin' care of my own
Down in no man's land
Got no friends got no dime
owly plenity of time
Where's the saving hand?

I got that feeling to need more and more atention
I got that fever, don't leave me alone
I got that feeling to make more than conversation
That is the fever, where's my home?

Take me home
Take me home 
Take me home

It's not truth what you see
Behind the mask that's not me
Try to reach my world
Can't you see I'm so blind 
Stay with me to change my mind
No more nightmares girl

I got that feeling to need more and more atention
I got that fever, don't leave me alone
I got that feeling to make more than conversation
That is the fever, where's my home?

Take me home
Take me home 
Take me home
