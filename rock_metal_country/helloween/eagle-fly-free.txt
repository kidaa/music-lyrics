People are in a big confusion
They don't like their constitutions
Everyday they draw conclusions
And they're still prepeared for war

Some can say what's ineffective
some make up themselves atractive
build up things they call protective
well you life seems quite bizarre

In the sky a migthy eagle 
doesn't care bout what's illegal
on it's wing the rainbow's light
It's flying to eternity

Eagle fly free 
Let people see
just make it your own way
leave time behind 
follow the sign
together we'll fly someday

Hey, we think so supersonic
and we made our bombs atomic
or the better quite newtronic
but the poor don't see a dime

Nowadays the air polluted
ancient people persecuted
that's what mankind contributed
to create a better time

In the sky a migthy eagle 
doesn't care bout what's illegal
on it's wing the rainbow's light
It's flying to eternity

Eagle fly free 
Let people see
just make it your own way
leave time behind 
follow the sign
together we'll fly someday
