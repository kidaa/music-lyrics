Forgotten in his reich from shadows-
Banned forever, one thought-
The Lord of evil was given name and place
Of the seventh sea, shelter of the seventh key
Who was betraying us? I guess you know
There would be more than one name to name
Now he, whose name is many, searches for the one...
The one strong enough to survive as his terrestial hand
enticement and promise will crown a king-
A puppet on a string- for a 1000 years,
...so they sing...
