Tell me prety girl do you know who I am?
Have you ever seen me as your friend
Anithing we have is those hungry nights
but there's so much left unsatisfied

All those little things you told me
ain't good enought to show me
That we're gonna make in throught the time

I find out in the midlle of a heartbeat
and I know that i'm doin' right
Together we're still so far apart
I find out in the midlle of a heartbeat
And the more I try to be your light
I can't get any closer to your heart

Now that I'm afraid just t ask for more
I'm stll waiting as I did before
If you owly sad that it's not too late
We could then rely upon our fate

All those little thing you tell me 
could bear enought to show me
That we're gonna make in trought the time

I find out in the midlle of a heartbeat
and I know that i'm tellin' right
Together we're still so far apart
I find out in the midlle of a heartbeat
And the more I try to be your light
I can't get any closer to your heart

I find out, I find out

I find out in the midlle of a heartbeat
and I know that i'm doin' right
Together we're still so far apart
I find out in the midlle of a heartbeat
And the more I try to be your light
I can't get any closer to your heart
