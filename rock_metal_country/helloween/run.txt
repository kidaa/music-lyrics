You think you're awake, the night was long
Don't be afraid, a new day is born
Just open your eyes and look around
You can't see a thing but still hear their sounds

Rememeber if you ask for release
Say the words and you'll be free

Run, run, run
Say the name of your enemy
Run, run, run
Lost and blind for eternity
Remember the words and you'll be free

Toss and turn, your sheets soaked with sweat
The poison of fear already reigns your head
The longer you wait the deeper you fall
Down to the demons you once dared to call

Remember if you ask for release
Say the words and you'll be free

Run, run, run
Say the name of your enemy
Run, run, run
Lost and blind for eternity
Remember the words and you'll be free
