A little thing you sure will know
Why you came here tonight
And not to those other places
I could imagine there's PCs and DVDs
And TV shows
And sex in cars what else you like
Now right here is the place I got to be
Tomorrow I'll be far away
If you got time and nothing else to do now
Together we can change the world

Let's get it up
Rock's here to stay
With the best years of our lives we paid our share
Yeah, yeah
Now tell me what is in our way
To push this right in the face everyday

We spread it further on the town
Now, what'd ya know we're good
To incite a few more disciples
No time to waste makin' haste we're movin' on
Where we'll suspend another night

Do I see grinning faces all round here?
...and is this due to my words
Come treat me nice, y' know, I wasn't raised here
But I mean everything I say

Let's get it up
Rock's here to stay
With the best years of our lives we paid our share
Yeah, yeah
Now tell me what is in our way
To push this right in the face everyday
