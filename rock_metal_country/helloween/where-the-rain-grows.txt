I never look higher
Than I could see
Never gave less
Than you have given me
The more you have taken
you turned into fakes
I finaly know now why for Heaven's sake?

Don't tell me you did not see that I cryed
Don't act so deaf and blind
Don't think that if someones made dumb to the core
He would stay like before

So I take my life
Back from where the rain grows
Die to survive
Back from where the rain grows

Now you call me liar
'Cause you are just the
"Always have right fools mojority"
I think that it's someones
start at your side
you'd all turn your back
Won't give any dime

Don't tell me you did not see that I cryed
Don't act so deaf and blind
Don't think that if someones made sad to the core
He would stay like before

So I take my life
Back from where the rain grows
Die to survive
Back from where the rain grows

From where the rain grows
I know where thr rain grows
I'm back from where the rain grows
