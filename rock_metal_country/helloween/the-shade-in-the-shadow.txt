You're reaching out in the dead of night
Searching for my hand
Your know I'm there in the waste of shadows
I'm your pain and friend

I hear your silent cries
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
I know your secret lies
I'm the Shade in the Shadow

I ban the light and I leave you blind
If you try your eyes
I am enemy or a trusty fellow
In yuor wailing mind

I hear your silent cries
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
I know your secret lies
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
I hide behind your shame
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
Crying out loud your name
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
The Shade in the Shadows of you

There I cry for you - In the shadows
As I always do - in the shadows
You may oust me there - in the shadows
But I'm always there - in the shadows
In the shadows

I hear your silent cries
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
I know your secret lies
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
I hide behind your shame
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
Crying out loud your name
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
The Shade in the Shadows of you

There I cry for you
In the shadows
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
As I always do
In the shadows
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
The Shade in the Shadow of you
