Black you stripped me
Reveal me the secrets of your pain - painful lies
Life itself that feeds your wisdom
Almost everyday you put yourself high on a shelf
Whatever you do, whereever you go
Never turn my back on you
Shwdows on the wall
Darkness is spreading
I warm my hands on the flames of lies
In vain I scream against the wind
They dont understand my last testament
Escalation 666
Escalation 666
Deciet and malice
Every smile hides betrayal and greed, Hypocrisy
Weve been like brothers
Now I hold out my hands to a bloodless soul
Shadows on the wall
Darkness is spreading
I warm my hands on the flames of lies
In vain I scream against the wind
They dont understand my last testament
Escalation 666
Escalation 666
