All you have said is still in my ears
You must have thought you're infallible
Oh no oh no
You're not gonna say that much anymore

Welcome to my peculiar dreams 
Fact is that here
I'm the master of reality
Hard to see?
But it's real tand you will read me

So many ways to go 
Before we're sanctified
Few will be chosen ones
Until we fade and die

Kings will be kings
Paws will bw paws
Aeons of tears Wild and severe
Blessed be the young
Strong enought to bear
What before long
Will come, will be, might never desapear

I know hat preide's before the fall
How can I fall if there's none left at all
Tell me, tell me
How far can one fall from down below?

It's either time or ev'ryone round
To show us what or who can be
exchangeable, disposeable
In the game of life we're playing

Close to eternity
I spread my wings and fly
Like from a distant age
I rule and you obey

Kings will be kings
Paws will bw paws
Aeons of tears Wild and severe
Blessed be the young
Strong enought to bear
What before long
Will come, will be, might never desapear
