Father it's time
Have a heart for your child who cries in pain
Not a new sign
But a strike that'll blow those fools away
Open your EYES
If you got for that just look for too ling at time
They split on your name
Doin'everything you deamed as highest crime

They beive they could walk on the waters
Playn'gos sleep with devil's daugther
They killed your sun
and might kill mine but you don't mind

Why, lord why
tell me why
In these lonely days
I've need your awser
There's a reason why

How could you fail
Still it's time turn the black into the light
Why do you wait
Do you look down and the law's that what you find

Can't you see they are mistreating their daugthers
they belive they could walk on the water
they killed your sun
and might kill mine but you don't mind

Why, lord why
tell me why
In these lonely days
I've need your awser
There's a reason why
Why, lord why
tell me why
You're the owly light
forever lastin'
tell me father why
