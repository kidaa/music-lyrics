Piece by piece you're tearin'me apart
Give to me and try another start
Brick by brick you really love that game
Things from witch I can't refrain

So many stories have been told
I give a damn, they're much too old
How often will we face the the end of our dreams
When will I see it all come true?
A splendid time for me and you
Can we expect it bein'the nice as it seams?

Will you be
My secret alibi
Angel of my night
Can we do it right?
Let's just try
Each others love so sweet
Till we can't deny
My secret alibi

Ding by ding can you dig my dong
It may come short but it might comes long
Limb by limb you're climbing up my tree
Making tuings mor fun for me

So many stories have been told
