Take me down
To a ground
Just let me feel it
If I let someone down
Please welcome
Him on the losing side

I shake you of
And make my choice
Don't wanna hear you
Your smiling free
Please go down, please
I don't wanna feel you around me

Take me down to a higher ground
To survive your mindless sound
If you know all the people
Why are you alone?
If you know all the people
You'll be goin'down

I feel that man
on my back
Don't promise any crap
Someone will break your neck
You don't know how
To soak my soul

Let me out, let me go
Open your eyes
You told nothing but lies
Please go down, please
C'mon, go down with your ego

Take me down to a higher ground
To survive your mindless sound
If you know all the people
Why are you alone?
If you know all the people
You'll be goin'down
Let me go ahead, let me go

I will find an explanation
Where's my owly destination
Separed ways now and forever
Is the on and owly measure

Tales full of exaggerations
No more manipulations
And I think you are not funny
Your brain is just a bloatd dummy

Take me down to a higher ground
To survive your mindless sound
If you know all the people
Why are you alone?
If you know all the people
You'll be goin'down
