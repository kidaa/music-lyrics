We're living in a constant fight
Too much pressure everywhere
And all around

Don't let it put you down
Hold on tight
Climb to your dreams

Don't you depend on someone else
Think for yourself and win the race

The chance you got
Comes never twice
Do your best, and do it right

Time will come
But you don't hide
You are on your way

You're let by God
But you're not a pawn
Should live your life
Don't care 'bout any scorn
just let them fool around
Don't need to cry
Don't give up!

Try to be as smart as you can be
I know you own so much ability

The chance you got
Comes never twice
Do your best, and do it right

Time will come
But you don't hide
You are on your way
