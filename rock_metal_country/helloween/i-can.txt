May I take you higher 
Feed well your desire
We won't be forgotten
Foes left slain and rotten

I will have my way
as once before
Others stand in awe
can't scorn at all

I can, I can, I can
make it all again
I don't wanna lose
I don't wanna get drowned
I can, I can I can
heed the call again
Fulfill my dreams until I'm cured

Some will leave here shattred
Wish us tarred and feathered

Show me anyone who doubts our ways
I will laught out loud and I will say

I can, I can, I can
make it all again
I don't wanna lose
I don't wanna get drowned
I can, I can I can
make the call again
Can attain ev'rything to leave you sure
I can

I can, I can, I can
make it all again
I don't wanna lose
I don't wanna get drowned
I can, I can I can
heed the call again
Fulfill my dreams until I'm cured
