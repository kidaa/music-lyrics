Give me two strong arms to fight my enemies,
Give me two strong eyes to see the truth.
Give me two strong legs I think I have to run,
And fill my heart with faith that I won't lose.
I don't wanna lose ...
Give me one real love that I don't freeze out there,
Make me feel your presence in the night.
Give me one strong heart that tells me when I lie,
And take my soul - so I won't have to hide.
I don't wanna hide ...
It's so cold deep down here, I know we had to fall,
Souls are dying everywhere but whatever I do I believe.
I Believe ... I Believe ...
[Solo: Roland Grapow and Michael Weikath]
It's so cold deep down here, I know we had to fall,
Souls are dying everywhere but whatever I do ...
There'll be no reason to live without you giving me light,
There is so much that you give, your love is shining so bright.
I Believe ... I Believe ... I Believe ... Believe ...
I wanna love but I always hate - I wanna give but I always take.
Want you to laugh but I make you cry, maybe I won't change 'til I die.
It's so much easier said than done - I know I can't just always run.
Got so much anger inside of me, I understand but I think I see what I'm not.
I know it's true what J.C. said - I got it all clear in my head.
Seens we were born to be unfair,
I am a sinner that's starting to dare ... to Believe.
Give me your hand until the end and I will waik into promised land.
I don't deserve anything you do - but I can't stop loving you.
No more lies, no false religions,
No more "whys" and wrong God missions.
No shiny T.V. priests begging for cash,
No more wars that no God's ever asked for.
There's a way back out of here - one day we're going home,
Tell everyone who wants to hear - whatever you do ... do Believe.
I Believe ... We Believe ... Believe ... Oh !
