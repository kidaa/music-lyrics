Come take a look up to the constelations
Take the book of God you will find your relations
If you understand you will know the solution 
things will fall back to the new constituction

I'm a son of a distant future
I'm the last of the seven troopers
And I came here for the 7th war

I'm a child of the stars
the blaster os the gods
and I have seen it all before
Before the war
Cold- hearted earth
I'm the master of the universe
And I have seen it all before
Before the war

Nature sets a limit to 
your millenary
Turning every place into 
a cruel mean scenary
All will get a chance to shun 
the holy fire
But you will be few getting 
under the wire

I'm a son of a distant future
I'm the last of the seven troopers
And I came here for
the 7th war

I'm a child of the stars
the blaster os the gods
and I have seen it all before
Before the war
Cold- hearted earth
I'm the master of the universe
And I have seen it all before
Before the war

Mind the 7th war- Mind the 7th war
Yes I came here for the 7th war

I'm a child of the stars
the blaster os the gods
and I have seen it all before
Before the war
Cold- hearted earth
I'm the master of the universe
And I have seen it all before
Before the war
