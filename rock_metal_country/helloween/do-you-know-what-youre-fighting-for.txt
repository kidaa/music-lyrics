Day by day you work off your claws
The line of fate in them
My not pay your loans
You got to keep goin' and goin' on
Strive day by day

Do you know, uh, do you know, do

Do you know what you're fighting for
The seed is sown
But we don't know the score
They will rule us, this breed of futility
You won't make an escape
'Cause we will still be alive

Disenchantment, alienation
A slog to feed future estranged generations
And, retired, will you get rewarded
Your brave restraint?

Do you know, uh, do you know, do

Do you know what you're fighting for
The seed is sown
But we don't know the score
They will rule us, this breed of futility
You won't make an escape
'Cause we will still be alive

Do you know what you're fighting for
The seed is sown
But we don't know the score
They will rule us, this breed of futility
You won't make an escape
'Cause we will still be alive

Uh, will they need you
Will they pay you
