I was born with a destiny
Born with guilt - shame on me
Can you judge me by my face
And not the history of my race

All my life I've lived and I see
All the eyes that watch over me
All my life - and I understand
That I'll always belong to this land

Why justify what I don't understand?
Just accidently born in this land
I can't escape the hand of the past
This legacy will always last

All my life I felt the same way
All the ears that hear what I say
And I hope that they understand
I'll always belong to this land

All my life I've lived and I see
All the eyes that watch over me
And I hope that they understand
That I'll always belong to this land
