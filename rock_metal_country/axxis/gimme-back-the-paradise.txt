I feel the hot rhythm
I feel the hot beat
Of the wild life of rock'n'roll

Travelling on roads
I've never seen before
And I feel the music in my soul

Every day another town
Every night another gig
And so many people to get to know

But you get no time for rest
Cause you wanna be the best
You give everything
Tonight the snow

This is a rock'n'roll paradies
And I hope it will never end 
But when we finished our tour
And the last day has come
I will cry again, again, again and again

Gimme back, gimme back the paradies
Gimme back, gimme back what I want

Gimme back, gimme back the paradies
Gimme back, gimme back what I want

So many different places
So many different faces
Things are strange and new
And when I look behind
The pictures in my mind
Makes me feel
As if I'd drank a witches'brew

Gimme more from this drink
It'a help for me to think
About all that I've seen
And I've learnt this time
Music changes every mind
Everywhere I've ever been

This is a rock'n'roll paradies
And I hope it will never end 
But when we finished our tour
