In the name of god people live and die
Living bombs made of believers
The world in war - religions lie
It's like opium of the masses
Shalom, shalom could this word be wrong
God will be there for everyone
Shalom, shalom soon a time will come
Let the peace shine bright like the sun

There's a wind in the night that can break the spell
A new world will arise forever
There's a wind in the night let the clouds dispell
By the place of our birth our fate was sealed

Hawks and doves let their idols live
On the back of the innocent
Don't really think it's a religious war
It's a fight rich against the poor

Shalom, shalom could this word be wrong
God will be there for everyone
Shalom, shalom soon a time will come
Let the peace shine bright like the sun

There's a wind in the night that can break the spell
A new world will arise forever
There's a wind in the night let the clouds dispell
By the place of our birth our fate was sealed
Feel the wind, feel the wind, feel the wind

Let us sing - let us pray
A million live and kill and die
Feel the wind who will bring us love
Hear a thousand children cry
Let us hope every day
And be sure night will fade away

There's a wind in the night that can break the spell
A new world will arise when freedom comes

There's a wind in the night let the clouds dispell
Forever night will fade away

Feel the wind and break the spell
Let us ring the freedom bell
Feel the wind and let us pray
Let us sing all tears away - all tears away
Wind in the night
