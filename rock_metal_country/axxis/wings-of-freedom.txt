There's no answer
Only silence
Emptiness spreading out
The calm before the storm
Birds don't fly
We know why
Do you realize the writtings on the wall?

A million visions let us believe in a better future world
Daring thoughts of genious minds let our hope still burn

Opinions were bought
To dispell our thoughts
Money is oue idol
Our greed for more

And I see the childrens dancing and I llok in to their eyes
How could they know today that their future is a lie

Singing ah... - wings of freedom fight - singing ah...
Singing ah... - wings of freedom fight
Singing ah... - Spreading out their might
Singing ah...

The voice of reason
Dies away
Is there anybody there
Who takes heart
Busy living
No misgiving
Will our world colapse like a house of cards?

Singing ah... - the wings of freedom fight
Singing ah... - spreading out their might
Singing ah... - sow the wind and reap the storm
Let a fire burn - there's no return
And don't give up at all

Let a fire burn - there's no return
And don't give up at all
