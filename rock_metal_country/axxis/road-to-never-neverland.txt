Every day
I sweated away
I got up early in the morning to earn my daily bread

Dud everything
All they said
But the more I did the more I got mad

Didn't like that life
Yeah, I was young
But at this time me dreams had begun

I wanted to be
Forever free
So I gave up this life to take the road

Oh... road to never-neverland
Even you can't see an end - it's not far away
Oh... road to never-neverland
Just goin' straight to reach the end - it's not far away

Every day - I play guitar
Just to stay alive - not to be a star
I'm not rich - but I'm not poor
Beacause I've got a freedom now that makes me feel secure
Ups downs all on my way
But I hold out to the last 'cause I wanna stay
On the road that never ends
To reach me dreams - my own never-neverland

Oh... road to never-neverland
Even you can't see an end - it's not far away
Oh... road to never-neverland
Just goin' straight to reach the end - it's not far away
