Night Time - shrouded in mystery
The mist, the fog - there is nothing to see
Full moon - shining down on earth
Now, tonight - starts the forbidden
starts the forbidden birth

Gruesome - howlin' to the moon
A creature - is on the hunt, the hunt
Somewhere - deep inside the man
A beast, awakes - undercover of the night

It cannot stop and there's no way out
The wolf possesses the man
It's howlin' loud

When the wolf prowls
When the wolf prowls
When the wolf prowls
When the wolf prowls

The wolf...

A man, a wolf - one body and one soul
Belong, together - for all eternity
A man, a beast - you know it's really true
Deep inside - the wolf is you
the wolf is you

All of your nightmares become reality
You know the wolf is in you
The wolf is in me

When the wolf prowls
When the wolf prowls
When the wolf prowls
When the wolf prowls

It cannot stop and there's no way out
The wolf possesses the man
It's howlin' loud
All of your nightmares become reality
You know the wolf is in you
The wolf is in me

When the wolf prowls
When the wolf prowls
When the wolf prowls
When the wolf prowls...
