You drag your nails across my back
I can feel your teeth upon my neck
I am in ecstasy

You blow my mind - heat me up
Take my spirit to the top - so high
I am in ecstasy

We fly...till we die
We fly...till we die

More than more is not enough
I need your mind expanding stuff
To fly...to fly

All my strength - down the drain
No escape - I tried in vain
I am in ecstasy

We fly...till we die
We fly...till we die

In your hand - helplessly
Sweat and blood - I cannot flee
On my skin - sweetest pain
A million needles like burning rain

We fly...till we die
We fly...till we die
