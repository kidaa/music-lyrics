When I hear your voice
In my loneliness
I look back and see my memories
I take a little look back
Just a little look back

Remember she's fire and water in one
A hunter who kills
Or a prey on the run
It's just a little look back
Just a little look back

Everytimes my thoughts
Bring me back to you
It's always hurts me Baby Whenever I do
I take a little look back
Just a little look back

What I need I'll never get
All that you've left me
Is just a little look back
What I need I'll never get
All that remains
Is just a little look back

Why don't you come back?
Why did you leave me alone?
I only have memories to call my own
I take a little look back
Just a little look back

I see her now as she has really been
The loveliest face I have ever seen
I take a little look back
Just a little look back

Everytimes my thoughts
Bring me back to you
It's always hurts me Baby Whenever I do
I take a little look back
Just a little look back

What I need I'll never get
All that you've left me
Is just a little look back
What I need I'll never get
All that remains
Is just a little look back
