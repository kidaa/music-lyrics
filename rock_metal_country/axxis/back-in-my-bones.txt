I saw the light
A great fire ball
As if the sun fell down on me

With every inch of my body I know
I'm on the point of no return

It wasn't my time to go forever
I held my soul back in my own
The beat of my heart
Rising blood pressure
Life was back in my bones

I feel it back in my bones
I feel it back in my bones

Was unconscious
Fell in a trance
Started slipping away
I had to fight for every breath
I knew I wanted to stay

It wasn't my time to go forever
I held my soul back in my own
The beat of my heart
Rising blood pressure
Life was back in my bones

I feel it back in my bones
I feel it back
I feel it back in my bones
