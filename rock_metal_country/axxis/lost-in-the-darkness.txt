Deep dark forest - I get lost
Out of sight - nothing to trust
Silence drives me to despair
This is a nightmare
Veil of mist across my way
Don't look back- don't stay

I'm lost in the darkness
- Lost in the darkness
shadows of eternity
I'm lost in the darkness
- Lost in the darkness
Don't believe in things you see
Find a way out of this haze
- Motionless - I just gaze

I'm lost, I'm lost, I'm lost

All the trees are scaring me
It seems they live and watch me
Dark and dangerous mystic atmosphere
That's more than I could bear
I can't see - I get lost
- There's nothing I can trust

I'm lost in the darkness
- Lost in the darkness
shadows of eternity
I'm lost in the darkness
- Lost in the darkness
Things are not how they would appear

Everytime when I think that I get lost
There's a small inner flame
That I can trust
Tending signs to heaven
So I can follow blind my way back home
- To you -
I will reach out for the signs in the sky
I'm lost, I'm lost, I'm lost

Panic's running down my back
Spilling out my - cold sweat

I'm lost in the darkness
- Lost in the darkness
shadows of eternity
Lost in the darkness
- Lost in the darkness
Don't believe in things you see
Lost in the darkness
- Lost in the darkness
Shadows of eternity

I've lost my way - I've lost my way
- I've lost my way - to you
