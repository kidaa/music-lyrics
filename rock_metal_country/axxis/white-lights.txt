So many years I have lived like a feather
The wind was trying to be my fate
I was dependent from rain storm and weather
But now I know it's not too late

Even if I'm just a tiny little wheel on earth
In this clockwork universe

White lights I can feel the energy
And the spirit of love will arrive
White lights I believe in what I see
The world of true love is alive

When suns and moons surge and fall every minute
Oh, I can only think of you
Planets exploding but mine is still turning
And now I know what I never knew

Yes I'm just a tiny little wheel on earth
In this clockwork universe

White lights I can feel the energy
And the spirit of love will arrive
White lights I believe in what I see
The world of true love is alive
