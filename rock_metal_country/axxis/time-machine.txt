Hear the clock as time goes by
We're born, we live, we die
Clockwork burns in my brain
Flashes are driving me insane
The past is not to change
Only the future can ever be rearranged

I'm on this trip through time and space
How would it be to meet each other
- Younger - face to face

I will fly in a time machine
One look - straight back - to you
I will fly in a time machine
One flash - we live - we die

One minute of my life could be
An everlasting journey to eternity
Cause on the day that I die
I would use the time machine - and fly

I'm on this trip through time and space
How would it be to meet each other
- Younger - face to face

I will fly in a time machine
One look - straight back - to you
I will fly in a time machine
One flash - we live - we die

Shadows hideaway but we survive
I invite you to the ride
Across the circle of my life

Hear the clock as time goes by
We're born, we live, we die

I will fly in a time machine
One look - straight back - to you
I will fly in a time machine
As time goes by
We live, we die
One flash

Let us fly
