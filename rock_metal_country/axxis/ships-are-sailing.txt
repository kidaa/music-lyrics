The wall  has fallen down tonight
I can't believe this dream
Tears of joy everywhere
We celebrate this day
I hope we'll always be free
I pray on my knees

Paperships sailing 
Just as a sign
To show the world now
There's no borderline

Ships are sailing cross the water
All the white lights shining bright
Ships are sailing cross the water
Burning candles in the night

Dance, dance and we dance around
On both banks of the stream
We are all together now
Now, now, now

Now the wall is broken
Will all dreams come true
We feel the freedom
We know what we have to do

Ships are sailing cross the water
All the white lights shining bright
Ships are sailing cross the water
Burning candles in the night

Our lights expel the darkness
Sailing into the night
Together we are fearless
Our eyes are open wide

Ships are sailing cross the water
All the white lights shining bright
Ships are sailing cross the water
Burning candles in the night
