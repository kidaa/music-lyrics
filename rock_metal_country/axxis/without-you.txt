An empty place and the silence all around me
And I see your face on a picture in my hand

I try to find
Yes, I'm searching for an answer
But I cannot find the reason why you wanna go

How can I reach you
I want to let you know

I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna say goodbye
I don't wanna miss you every day and night
Without you I would die
I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna say goodbye
Listen to the wind and hear my words
Forever you'll be mine

The world with you
Was turning without motion
And I never knew
About your deepest emotions

All excuses
Never bring you back to me

I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna say goodbye
I don't wanna miss you every day and night
Without you I would die
I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna say goodbye
Listen to the wind and hear my words
Forever you'll be mine

Can you feel me like I feel you
Gimme just a sign
I wanna hold you and I know
Forever you'll be mine

I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna say goodbye
I don't wanna miss you every day and night
Without you I would die
I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna say goodbye
And I never dreamed it could be over
Won't you give me one more night

Can you feel me like I feel you
Gimme just one sign
Wanna hold you and I know
Forever you'll be mine
