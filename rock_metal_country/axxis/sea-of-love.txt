Sea of flowers in my dream
all the colours are shining
I take a breath and I feel this place
far away from time and space

I will dive in the sea of love
touching the bottom of an endless ocean
Dive, dive, dive....
I will dive in the sea of love
Ride on the waves of love and emotion
Dive in the sea of my love

Like a leave in the wind I fly
see me drifting - see me dreaming
and I know I can touch the sky
like a bird I spread my wings

I will dive in the sea of love
touching the bottom of an endless ocean
Dive, dive, dive....
I will dive in the sea of love
Ride on the waves of love and emotion
Dive in the sea of my love

In the sea of my love where the water is the sky
I wanna dive and I feel like I can fly
wanna be with you in the ocean of our love
gimme a sign and we're flying high above

I will dive in the sea of love
touching the bottom of an endless ocean
Dive, dive, dive....
I will dive in the sea of love
Ride on the waves of love and emotion
Dive in the sea of my love
