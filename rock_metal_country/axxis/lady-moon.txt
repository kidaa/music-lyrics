A secret place silent as a grave
Oh, what a night I need to be saved
Moonbeams dance they are my guide
The days is lost in the dead of night

And I sat with my back against a cold stone
Waiting for you don't leave me alone
You're my dream my reality
Don't fade away don't hide away from me

Lady Moon you're holding the crow
Save my life before I drown
Queen in black your glory will shine
To the Moon is back for all of time

Let us sail with your ship up to the moon
In the clam of the night out of the blue
As my time runs out like sand through my hand
The nightmares leave at your command

I feel in this night you're close to me
Dance like a shadow now and I set you free
I'm paralysed love at first sight
Lady Moon so cold so bright
Lady Moon you're holding the crow

Save my life before I drown
Queen in black your glory will shine
To the Moon and back for all of time

Save my life before I drown
Queen in black now you come back

I'm always by your side
Even if we're world's apart
In the heat of the night
You will be mine

Lady Moon you're holding the crow
Save my life before I drown
Queen in black your glory will shine
To the Moon and back for all of time

Lady Moon you're holding the crow of time
Save my life before I drown of time
Queen in black your glory will shine
Flying to the moon and back now
Flying to the moon and back now
To the moon and back
My queen in black
