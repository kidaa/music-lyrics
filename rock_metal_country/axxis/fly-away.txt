You gonna make me feel
I get lost - your blood is cold as steel
All I got was hell
but I don't want a better world

Your world has made me blind
Your devil's on my heaven's side
Like a parasite - you're gettin into me

I feel my blood like fire
No mighty force can make me stay
The power of divine desire
Hold me back before I fly away

Fly, fly away
Fly, fly away

Just try to be myself
ain't easy when the world imprisons me
I try to flee from you
Into a land of my own phantasy

Shadows from the light
I hide away from you
Voices in the night
give me another point of view

I feel my blood like fire
No mighty force can make me stay
The power of divine desire
Hold me back before I fly away

Fly , fly away
Fly , fly away

I feel my blood like fire ...
