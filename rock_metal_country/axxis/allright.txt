It's like another kind of revolution
It's seems to be another century
Caught in a web of world wide information
A spider's net of digitally

There's no borderline
The borders fading with the time
No more one to one
A new age has begun

Alright
Feel the temptation
Alright
Feel the new time

We're looking for the latest chip creation
A cyber world based on data files
A new temptation for a generation
Lost in a system cold as ice

Walk in the cyber-space
I talk to you without a face
Tell me have you done it yet?
Surfing through the net

Alright
Feel the temptation
Alright
Feel the new time

Walk in the cyber-space
I talk to you without a face
Surfing through the net
What you seek is what you net

Touch a body - feel no skin
Hide yourself behind the screen
Find your cyber girl
Create your future
World

Alright
Feel the temptation
Alright
Feel the new time

Alright
Feel the temptation
Alright
Feel the new time
