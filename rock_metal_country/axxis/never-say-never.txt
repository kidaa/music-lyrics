Head over heels in love with you
Feeling like an eagle in the storm
All I do is dream of you
I feel like a new born
Forever, I will sell my soul

Never say never
Forever in love
I'll be forever in love

The way you move, the way you talk
Takes my breath away
I wanna resist, but this love exists
Deep in my heart youll stay
Falling in love, falling in love
Forever, I will see my soul
