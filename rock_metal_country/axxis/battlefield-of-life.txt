You're invited to my life
My inner thoughts are writen down
They are hidden in our sound

All that I feel, that I express
You will see it - more or less
My mind was easy to access

Do you really understand
What I try to say
This is my way and it's all about...

Live and love and die - All that I see around
What I feel and what I found
Live and love and die - Life's a battlefield
Live and love and die - That's all we do - We're going through
Live and love and die - It's all about - The Battlefield of life...

I write about love, war and pain
About the moon, the trees and rain
About things I really feel

But all the thoughts I've written down
Not made for you - are for my own
Words are only seeds I sown

Do you really understand
What I'm crying out
I make it easy for you
What is it all about?

Live and love and die - All that I see around
What I feel and what I found
Live and love and die - Life's a battlefield - Our fate is sealed
Live and love and die - That's all we do - No more, no less - We're going 
through
Live and love and die - It's all about - The Battlefield of life...

And now I'm sitting here and I know
Life is just a Broadway show
It doesn't change the universe
