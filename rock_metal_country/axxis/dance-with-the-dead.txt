And I dance with the dead on their holy night
Dance with the dead right now
Dance with the dead right now

I see the screen of fog is rising
Like a wall surrounding me
A nightmarish invitation
To this scary ceremony

There is no door there is no way out
There's no way out
I'm on the path of no return
With no return
Am I in danger l am I Dreaming? l am I dreaming
Cold sweat the dead let fires burn

And I Dance with the dead on their holy night
Let me dance l dance l Aha
And I Dance with the dead l drive out my fright
And I Dance with the dead right now
Dance right now

Like a dream like an illusion
Everything is so unreal
Look in their faces see them laughing
I could touch them l they are cold as steel l cold as steel

Behind the fog light's getting brighter
Behind the fog
A tunnel fading in this wall
Way down to hell
This is the time for a decisional time to decision
To go l or stay l to stand or fall

And I Dance with the dead on their holy night
Let me dance l dance l Aha
And I Dance with the dead l drive out my fright
And I Dance with the dead right now
Dance right now

Dance with the dead on their holy night
And I dance with the dead right now
Dance with the dead on their holy night
Let me dance dance Aha
Let me dance with the dead drive out my fright
And I dance with the dead right now
Dance with the dead dance
