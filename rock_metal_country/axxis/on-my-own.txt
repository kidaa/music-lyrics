Standing alone in flowered field
The silence around like a quiet shield
Colourful blossoms
With their pleasant smell
Carry my dreams to a wishing-well

This is the place where I wanna be
Where heavenly peace is covering me
A deep golden sky so far I can see
Time gets lost in eternity

On my own
Discovering the strength
I have never known
On my own
Aware of a world I've never known

I couldn't live in your "perfect" world
Locked in a cage like a captured bird
Drifted apart from the scheme of things
I felt like a bird with broken wings
...broken wings

On my own
Discovering the strength
I have never known
On my own
Aware of a world I've never known

I knew I'd loose you if I'd go and find
A world of my own to open up my mind
Now I believe in what I already knew
The wind it tells me I belong to you

On my own
Discovering the strength
I've never known
On my own
Here I've realised that I belong to you
On my own
Aware of a world I have never known
On my own
Now I know I belong to you
