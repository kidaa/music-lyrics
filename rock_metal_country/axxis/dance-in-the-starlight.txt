Moonlight eyes - you can break my spell
I never thought that you wanna be mine
I could not trust my eyes on that Saturday night
Holdign you in the moonshine

Light and shade - close together sometimes
But you fade all the shadows away
I feel the spirit of passion burnin' in me so let me say

Dance in the starlight light up the dark night
I'll never want to let you go
Dance in the starlight and light up my life
Oh our love will live and grow - live and grow

Under the roof of god all our prayers come true
Being one with the universe
Midnight wind will blow my promise to you
Let us embrace our mother earth

Losing time - losing space - in this hot summer night
Our witness will be our brother moon
Watching out for us, sending words with the wind
Listen to it's Midnight tune

Dance in the starlight light up the dark night
I'll never want to let you go
Dance in the starlight and light up my life
Oh our love will live and grow
I'll never want to let you go
Dance in the starlight
Oh our love will live and grow

Dance in the starlight light up the dark night
I'll never want to let you go
Dance in the starlight and light up my life
Oh our love will live and grow
Dance in the starlight light up the dark night
I'll never want to let you go
Dance in the starlight

Starlight - I'll never want to let you go
