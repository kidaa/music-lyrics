Love was a church and you were the priest of my lust
I was your toy your loyal disciple of trust

I was the slave to your pain
I was nailed at your cross

Helena, Helena
You've given love and massive pain
Helena, Helena
your words are burning like black rain
Helena
you set my soul in ecstasy
Helena
you were my saint my sanctuary

You were my saint and I always followed your words
through massive pain till I learned how deep love can hurt

I was the slave to your love
I was nailed at your cross

Helena, Helena
You've given love and massive pain
Helena, Helena
you words are burning like black rain
Helena, Helena
you set my soul in ecstasy
Helena, Helena
you were my saint my sanctuary

Helena, Helena ...
