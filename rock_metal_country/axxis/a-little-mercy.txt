They built cathedrals for the glory and the fame
While the kids down in the streets
Are dying in it's name

They try to hide away the truth from you and me
Must we be blind to see?
Sometimes life means misery

A little mercy, oh mercy - a little mercy ,oh mercy
A little mercy - for the souls living on the other side

A little mercy, oh mercy - a little mercy, oh mercy
A little mercy - for the souls crying to be understood

Golden hills and silver street made out of sweat and blood
In times of liberty - Millions are not free
Sitting pretty in a tower full of light
The wheel of fortune on their side
Are they deaf for the song that the people sing?

A little mercy, oh mercy - a little mercy, oh mercy
A little mercy - for the souls living on the other side

A little mercy, oh mercy - a little mercy, oh mercy
A little mercy - for the souls crying to be understood

And the wind will blow away what the children voices pray
When the sun is going down in a sea of misery
Alone with their fears
They need more than our tears
when the sun is going down - going down on you and me

A little mercy, oh mercy - a little mercy, oh mercy
A little mercy - For the souls living on the other side

A little mercy, oh mercy - a little mercy, oh mercy
A little mercy - For the souls crying to be understood
