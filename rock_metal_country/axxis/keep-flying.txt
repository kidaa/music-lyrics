I wanna built a world for you
But you don't want my dreams
I realize our feelings fade away

I wanna be so close to you
But we are worlds apart
How could we heal our love and our broken hearts

Why... Why I can't stop loving you
Keep flying, come on baby keep on flying
Why... Why I can't stop loving you
Keep flying high

Our love is like a bird
Flying through rain and storm
Drifting with the wind up to the sky

A new hope, a new horizon
Shining like the sun
Maybe our love has just begun

Why... Why I can't stop loving you
Keep flying, come on baby keep on flying
Keep flying high
Why... Why I can't stop loving you
Keep on flying un to the sky
