And when the lamb opened the
first seal,
I saw, I saw the first Horse.
The Horseman held a bow
Now when the lamb opened the
second seal,
I saw, I saw the second Horse
The Horseman held his sword

The leading horse is white
The second horse is red
The third one is a black,
The last one is a green

The leading horse is white
The second horse is red
The third one is a black,
The last one is a green

And when the lamb opened the third seal,
I saw, I saw the third Horse.
The Horseman had a balance
Now when the lamb opened the fourth seal,
I saw the fourth Horse.
The Horseman was the Pest

The leading horse is white
The second horse is red
The third one is a black,
The last one is a green

The leading horse is white
The second horse is red
The third one is a black,
The last one is a green

The leading horse is white
The second horse is red
The third one is a black,
The last one is a green

The leading horse is white
The second horse is red
The third one is a black,
The last one is a green.....
