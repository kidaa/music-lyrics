Ice dawn crystallized
Drifting snow I'm hypnotized
Restless lights shadows hide
Climate changed worldwide

All the signs we're so blind
It's like a thorn left in my mind
Sleeping visions come to life
Let our future survive

Ice Wind will blind my eyes forever
Look look the ice wind will blow
Ice wind so cold this world will never understand
The nature strikes back without grace

I cannot run I cannot hide
An odyssey without a guide
The frozen core is searching flames
To escape the devils game

Silent sea lost in ice
The bleeding sun is wrapped up tight
Ice will break the borders down
But I can't runaway
I cannot stay Is it time to pray

Ice wind will blind my eyes forever
Look look the ice wind will blow
Ice wind so cold this world will never understand
The nature strikes back without grace
Ice ice ice

Feel the ice wind ice wind
Feel the ice wind ice wind
Ice wind

Ice wind will blow forever
Look look the ice wind will blow
Ice wind so cold this world will never understand
The nature strikes back without grace
Ice wind Ice wind Ice wind will blow
