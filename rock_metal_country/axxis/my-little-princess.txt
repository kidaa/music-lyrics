Light up my life - more than the sun
my little princess - you are my only one
so pure, so lovely - your deep blue eyes
so innocent - your children's paradise

Hold you - touch you
I wanna live for you

My little princess - you're the one and only girl
I would give I would do everything for you
my little princess - I would build a world for you
oh its so nice - a children's paradise

Can find no words for what I feel
this must be true love, this love must be real
when I embrace you I touch the sky
in our fairy tales you let me think that I can fly
I wanna live for you

Hold you ...

My little princess ...
