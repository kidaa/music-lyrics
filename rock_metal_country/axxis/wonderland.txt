A wonderworld so far away
A land of dreams - how could we find the way
Oh, just this hope let us survive
To bide the days - to get through this live

Come and take my hand
And You will understand
That I promise you the never-never land

Get out, get out... get over to the wonderworld
Get out, get out and take my invitation
I don't belive you will find a better world
I wanna be the one who takes you to the sun

To feel the happiness - we need to be sad
To know whats good - we have to feel bad
The balance of our life is strong
We're living in between what's right and wrong

Come and take my hand
Searching till the end
And I'll promise you the never-never land

Get out, get out... get over to the wonderworld
Get out, get out and take my invitation
I don't belive you will find a better world
I wanna be the one who takes you to the sun

Why don't you take my - my invitation?
Why don't you want to get out, get out...?

Get out, get out... get over to the wonderworld
Get out, get out and take my invitation
I don't belive you will find a better world
I wanna be the one who takes you to the sun
