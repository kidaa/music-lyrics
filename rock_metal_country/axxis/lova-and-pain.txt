I feel lost now
When you said how
Could it go on
I don't want to be of these clowns

I'm not a piece in your game
I'm not the one to take the blame

Love and pain
Rule the game
Love and lust
In the circus of pain I'm the clown without a name

I feel sick now
When you said how
You want me to be
In the circus of your fantasy

I'm not a piece in your game
I'm not the one to take the blame

Love and pain
Rule the game
Love and lust
In the circus of pain I'm the clown without a name
In the circus of pain I'm the clown without a name

Love and pain
Rule the game
Love and lust
In the circus of pain I'm the clown without a name

Love and pain
Love and pain
I feel a love and pain
In the circus of pain I'm the clown without a name
