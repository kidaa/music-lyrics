Lights - I wanna get out - feel the sun
And I walk - this morning I can see no one

The daylight is warming up my life and now I know
You are the one - I never wanna let you go

A new day has begun - yesterday is gone... forever...

At the crack of dawn - when the city life awakes
I walk alone while the sunlight embraces my sleepy face
Crack of dawn - the sun has opened up my eyes
Here I change my life - here I realize...
...I'm sorry for my little lies

Life - the rhythm of our life is all too strong
And I know, yesterday I was so wrong

Another chance when another day is born
I - I feel the calm before the storm

At the crack of dawn - when the city life awakes
I walk alone while the sunlight embraces my sleepy face
Crack of dawn - the sun has opened up my eyes
Here I change my life - here I realize...
...I'm sorry for my little lies
