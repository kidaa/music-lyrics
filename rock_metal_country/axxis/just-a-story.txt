I - I saw her in the news
As someone robbed a bank today
He took a girl to getaway

I saw them drive off in a car
Hunted by the press
Looking for their own success

Why did no one help her?

Just a story
For the prime time news
A minute's attention
For a little girl's life

Just a story of a brave princess
Lived through hell
To see heaven I guess

I saw somebody from the press
Had the guy put the gun
Back on her head - just for fun

Flash - flashlights
Reflecting in her eyes
I saw her tears - I saw the gun
I saw her fear like everyone
Why did no one help her?

Just a story
For the prime time news
A minute's attention
For a little girl's life

Just a story of a brave princess
Lived through hell
To see heaven I guess

I saw the bullet on her head
A second later - she was dead
Why didn't anybody help her?

Just a story
For the prime time news
Just a minute's attention
For a little girl's life
