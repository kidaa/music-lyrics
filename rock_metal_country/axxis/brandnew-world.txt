A million promises were broken in the sea of lies
A million words were spoken in the depth of your eyes
Throwing all doubts away
Hope my words let you stay

Imagine we can find a way to live in paradise
Imagine we could get a vision that never dies
Nothings gonna be the same and I promise this way
For you...
I will find a brandnew world
What we share is magic, what we sare is fantasy
Don't belive it's all a mistery - belive in me
Like a small inner flame
Reaching out for an aim

Imagine we could find...

Imagine we can find a way to live in paradise
Imagine we could get a vision that never dies

We will never say goodbye - that is forever
Now I know you don't belive - but never say never

Nothing's gonna be the same and I promise this way
For you... I will find a brandnew world
