I am just a waterdrop
Fatefully I cannot stop my fall down to earth
Like a tear from heaven sent
I don't know where my way will end
I just fly in the unkown deep
in the unkown deep

Alone I'm weak and innocent
And yet I'm strong by my million friends
I'm one with the violence of the pouring rain

In a raging river
In a churning ocean
I'm the flowing blood of the world - the elixier of life

In a raging river
In a churing ocean
I'm the origin of life - I will survive
I will sirvive

I am just a waterdrop
I'm so weak - I cannot stop my fall down to earth
I'm formed to rain, clouds, ice and snow
Creating seasons - I let the nature grow
let the nature grow

When I rain down the wasteland
Green grass is growing in dry sand
I'm indispensable - the elexier of life

In a raging river
In a churning ocean
I'm the flowing blood of the world - the elixier of life

In a raging river
In a churning ocean
I'm the origin of life - I will survive
I will survive
I will survive
