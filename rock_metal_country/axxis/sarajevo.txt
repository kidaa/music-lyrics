Families worlds apart
War Torn - broken hearts
Thousand sad goodbyes
as this city dies
symbol of a war

Sarajevo
You're their hope their home
hear the people pray
Smoke will fade away

Ruins of a town
Tears of pain fall down
War has called your name
Who will take the blame
give them hope and light

Sarajevo
You're their hope their home
out of dust and smoke
give them peace and hope

Sarajevo
You're their hope their home
hear the people pray
Smoke will fade away

... will fade away ...
Sarajevo
You're their hope their home
hear the people pray
Smoke will fade away

Sarajevo, Sarajevo
