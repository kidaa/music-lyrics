My name is the devil
I'm playing a game
With what you call mankind
But now things have changed

Your good and my evil
Have covered the world each day
It was to be a neverending fight
But look at the world today

Forget our hostility
Join together with me
Now it's time for a fight against
The people we see

Get down From the throne in the light
Get down To stay right by my side

The good ald times are gone
When we used to live their hearts
But they've forgotten their beliefs
They live in a house of cards

I've always trusted in our might
That I'm the dark and you see it  too
Oh god, oh god what will we do

Get down From the throne in the light
Get down To stay right by my side
