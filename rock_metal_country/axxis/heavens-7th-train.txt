Sittin' in a train when the moon shines bright
The rollin' stream lights up the night
I close my eyes and begin to dream
Just listening to the noise of the engine's stream
the engine's stream

In a murderous heat I wake up
Afraid I realize the train won't stop
I'm sceared - my panic rises more and more
When I read the golden letters on my compartment door

Heaven's 7th train - no way back again
Hear the nightnares yell
In the train of your farewell
of your farewell

Am I alive or am I dead?
Can I belive what I just read?
A prisoner of this rollin' cell
Am I in a dream on my way straight to hell?

Heaven's 7th train - no way back again
Hear the nightnares yell
In the train of your farewell
of your farewell
of your farewell
or your farewell

Heaven
Heaven
Heaven - 7th
Heaven
Heaven
Heaven - 7th

Heaven's 7th train - no way back again
No tales left to tell
In the train of your farewell
of your farewell
of your farewell
of your farewell
