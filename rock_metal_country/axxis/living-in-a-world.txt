Fever is growing in their vains
Flashlights , cold eyes
Back to the start,
Take a coin for your game
The game sucks , your luck

Press all your buttons down to play
Like a drug, like a derailing train
Falling in the trap of these games

Living in a world of shame and glory
Living in a world of shame and lies
Living in a world of shame and glory
It's a flight into other lies, it's a lie

The coin is your key in a nightmare world
Machines and dreams
Luck for a minute, you're a loser in life
Once more, highscore

All our misery
Illusions of reality
Dont't let them take pessesion of you

Living in a world of shame and glory
Living in a world of shame and lies
Living in a world of shame and glory
It's a flight into other lies, it's a lie
