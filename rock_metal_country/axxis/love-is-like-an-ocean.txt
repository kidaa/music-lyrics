Hey darling, you're so far away
This wall can't divide our love, I pray
I need you, I wanna see you
No frontier can change my love

Cause every drop of love could be
A might stream of sympathy
And every stone is flowing away

Love is like an ocean
Love is where I'm diving in
Love is like an ocean
Love is a weapon which could win

A few footsteps, but worlds apart
And a thousand lonely fates
If they hold together with love
The stones come tumbling down

And every part of history
Builds up the wall and you will see
That every stone is flowing away

Love is like an ocean
Love is where I'm diving in
Love is like an ocean
Love is a weapon which could win
