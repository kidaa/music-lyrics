For our boredom we got a golden TV
For our souls we got a holy cross

And I will be your -
Be your holy cross
And I will be there
When you feel the loss

Alright
Idolators serve and idols rule
Alright
That's the reason why I'm here for you

For our wars we got
Mighty weapons
For what's left we got
A million graves

And I will be your
Final resting place
Cause I will be there
When your soul is saved

Alright
Idolators serve and idols rule
Alright
That's the reason why I'm here for you

Never before in the history of man
Have so few ruled, so many,
With man, guns and bombs
So let them see the writing on the wall

Alright
Idolators serve and idols rule
Alright
That's the reason why I'm here for you
