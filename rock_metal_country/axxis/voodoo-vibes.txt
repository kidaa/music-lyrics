What you do to me is voodoo
I'm the puppet in your hand
If you stick a nail inside it
I can feel the pain it sent

The moon will be my witness
when I break your magic spell
Take care of what I give you
'cos I've got only one soul to sell

I've got only one soul to sell
I lost my will...

You've given me Vooooodooo ; Give me Voodoo Vibes

You stick a nail inside a puppet baby - give me voodoo vibes
you'd go down without mercy baby - give me voodoo vibes
If I could I would protect myself - give me voodoo vibes
But listen baby when I say to you :" Give me Voodoo Vibes!"

You can kill my slowly
You can thrill me if you want
If you touch the world's horizon
You'll have fire in your hand

When we're feeling one with heaven
Hell is not far away
Give me magic satisfaction
cos I've almost lost my own will
I've almost lost my own will

You give me Vooooodooo , give me Voodoo Vibes

You stick a nail inside a puppet baby - give me voodoo vibes
You'd go down without mercy baby - give me voodoo vibes
If I could I would protect myself - give me voodoo vibes
but listen baby when I say to you : " Give me Voodoo Vibes ! "
