I'm alive

I was surprised how deep I live in your heart
How deep I've touched your soul - your life
We don't know each otrher we are worlds apart
But I will be there whenever you cry

Visions that you see - bring you close to me
You're looking through my eyes and I realize

I'm alive - forever my words and my songs will live
I'm alive - even if I should die I'll be close by your side

I'm not worthy of your giving me that crown
I underestimated my words
You must know I am only a clown
I make you laugh when you're falling down

Visions that you see - bring you close to me
You're looking through my eyes and I realize

I'm alive - forever my words and my songs will live
I'm alive - my spirit is one with your mind

Visions that you see - bring you close to me
You're looking through my eyes and I realize

I'm alive - forever my words and my songs will live
I'm alive - if I should die I'll be by your side

And forever I am living on
In your heart
By mi songs tonight
If I should die I'll be close by your side
I've touched your soul
Touched your heart
You're looking throungh my eyes
My spirit is one with your mind

I'm alive
I'm alive
