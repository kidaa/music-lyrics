Oh, I will paint my car pink if you like
I will sell my self - for you, I would fight
Wanna do everything to get you - now
When you want me on time, I wouldn't be late
But be aware - don't let me go

And history shows what men can do
For women they love - they can even start a war
We act, we live by this longing for love for girls like you - so...

Gimme your blood - gimme your flesh
Gimme your love - don't treat me like trash
This is what I want - you have to pay the price
Gimme your blood - gimme your flesh
Gimme your love - don't treat me like trash
Gimme a proof of your love
And not a compromise - not a compromise

I would rob a bank for the money you need
I would cool you with ice if you can't stand the heat
Let me be your one and only till I die
I would meet your friends that I don't like at all
Wanna give you a hand when you're about to fall
Would believe in you even if you lie

And history shows what men can do
For women they love - they can even start a war
We act, we live by this longing for love for girls like you - so...

Gimme your blood - gimme your flesh
Gimme your love - don't treat me like trash
This is what I want - you have to pay the price
Gimme your blood - gimme your flesh
Gimme your love - don't treat me like trash
I just wanna live out what men dream at night

You are my drug, you are my hell
In spite of all I'm feeling well
I'm addicted, I am sick, I'm in love

Gimme your blood - gimme your flesh
Gimme your love - don't treat me like trash
This is what I want - you have to pay the price
Gimme your blood - gimme your flesh
Gimme your love - don't treat me like trash
Gimme a proof of your love and not a compromise
Gimme your blood, gimme your flesh, gimme your love
You have to send me signs tonight - we live it up let love be dynamite
