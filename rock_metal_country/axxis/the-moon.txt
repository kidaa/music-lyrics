Full moon, I'm watching you
Your light touches my face
You seem to be so great tonight
I wonder if you change your light

When the moon falls down to earth
Danger in the universe
When the moon falls down to earth
Fire in the universe

Darkness around our light
I feel a danger in this night
Tonight the moon has got a face
Laughing into our space

It's grining, it's laughing
Depending our helpless lifes
We'll explode in a fireball
When the moon starts to fall

When the moon falls down to earth
Danger in the universe
When the moon falls down to earth
Fire in the universe

Days after the collision
Silence in the universe
An empty place, a dark space
Where our planet lived before

When the moon falls down to earth
Danger in the universe
When the moon falls down to earth
Fire in the universe
