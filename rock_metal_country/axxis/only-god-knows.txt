So many tears flow down the river
The world was coming to an end for me

You'll never see the sun shine brightly
I could never show what I feel for you
a single day, just to say:"goodbye."
all that's left is to cry out:"Why?"

Only god knows what he's done to me
heaven don't let you go
I have to understand god took you by the hand
to a foreign land

I`d sell my soul just to hold you tight
I`sell my soul just to see your eyes
a deep hole in my heart is still burning
I wanna cry out - I'm missing you

Only god knows what he's done to me
heaven don't let you go
I have to understand that god took you by the hand
to a foreign land
Heaven don't let you go

could never hold you
could never touch you
god leads you to a foreign land

I see my fate like a tear in the river
and the rain is falling down on me

Only god knows what he?s done to me
heaven don't let you go
I have to understand
god took you by the hand
to a foreign land

Heaven don't let you go
I have to understand
god took you by the hand
to lead you to a foreign land

Heaven don't, heaven don't let you go
I understand, god holds your hand
god holds your hand in a foreign land

So pure, so lovely, so beautiful
wherever you are I?ll send you all my love
