Love so innocent eyes don't understand
I must leave you for a while
I must say goodbye take my hand don't cry
Now we're victims of this war

Don't leave me with tears in your eyes
You must know that I'm still in love
For evermore tears in your eyes
Memories remain with you
And you know... I'll always love you

Pray! Forever mine
Stay! no borderline
War has torn our worlds apart
I'm not scared of dying
Oh I don't really care
Hope a better future will be there

Don't leave me with tears in your eyes
You must know that I'm still in love
For evermore the tears in your eyes
Let me know I'll always love you

All our fate is like a feather that is drifting through the rain
Life has got no shelter for all the tears of pain

Don't leave me with tears in your eyes
You must know that I'm still in love
Don't leave me with tears in your eyes

And you know... I'll always love you
Yes I know I'll always love you
Yes I know I'll always love you
