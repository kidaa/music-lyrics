Green horses on black rush
Are standing all around
White shadows of red clouds
Is all I dream about

Can see the trees are blue
Don't wanna see like you
Everything is clear - where is your fantasy?

Oh, I invite you to my wonderland
Where everything is posible all the time
I don't expect that you understand
But miracles can change your world like mine

I`m gonna live like a sphinx - spreading my wings - let miracles rain down on you
In the temple of dreams - the fantasy streams - break out of the circle of life

The flowers big like trees
Are feeding green red bees
A land where snow is pink
Here I can dream and think

All pictures of my life
Are painted in my mind
All colours that I see
They shine for you and me

Oh, I invite you to my wonderland
Where everything is posible all the time
I don't expect that you understand
But miracles can change your world like mine

I`m gonna live like a sphinx - spreading my wings......
Oh, I invite you to my wonderland
Where everything is posible all the time
I don't expect that you understand
But miracles can change your world like mine

I`m gonna live like a sphinx - spreading my wings......
