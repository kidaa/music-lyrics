No advice
Open up your eyes
Don't you realize that we live our lives
No advice

Nothing on my mind - day after day
Always party woth my friends - that's my way
We're nobody's fools when we hit the town
Turnin' our lives up side down

We're curisin' around - looking for fun
We're not wasting our time - always on the way
We need a rest from people who don't realize
'Cause we don't need nobody trying to moralize

Livin' for each other - We're got our peace of mind
Just livin' for each day and we need, need, need

No advice - Open up your eyes - don't you realize
That we live our lives
No advice - You'd better wise up and realize
That we live our lives
No advice, no advice...

We hate people telling us how to live
'Cause they've learned how to take, but not to give
But we think, "Who cares?!" - We're thick skinned
We make our own decisions - free like the wind

Livin' for each other - We're got our peace of mind
Just livin' for each day and we need, need, need

No advice - Open up your eyes - don't you realize
That we live our lives
No advice - You'd better wise up and realize
That we live our lives
No advice, no advice, no advice
