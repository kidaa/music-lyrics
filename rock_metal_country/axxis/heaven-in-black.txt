Are you cold as ice, are you hot like fire
Going to extremes - your desire
Go to the left - go to the right
In the middle you will find a reason not to fight

Different worlds, different things
Different thoughts of different people
God given blaze of colour everywhere

Heaven in black - heaven in white
Loving the darkness and the light
Different thoughts could make our life so colourful
Heaven in black - heaven in white
Living by day and loving the night
Opposites attract in our life

Everybody is black, every flower is grey
The same old prayers we all pray
A boring world without good and bad
Our life would really be so sad

Different...

Heaven in black - heaven in white
Loving the darkness and the light
Different thoughts could make our life so colourful
Heaven in black - heaven in white
Living by day and loving the night
Opposites attract in our life
Everybodies life

Heaven in black - heaven in white
Loving the darkness and the light
Different thoughts could make our life so colourful
Heaven in black - heaven in white
Loving the darkness and the light
