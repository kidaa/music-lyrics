Still feel your breath on my burning skin
Forbidden passion hidden deep within
Hear me saying: keep on praying save me
Hiding from the world will make you cry

Eyes try to meet each others gaze
Why do you always make me fight?
I can never get enough of you
I know you hear my call
Fight against the burning passion inside

I will guide you through the stormy night
Will hold you till the morning light
I know a place where we can hide

Take my Hand and I'll lead you through the night
Caught in the heat of love again
Why do we always have to fight?
And we never ever get enough
Take my Hand I will save you from the fall
Too proud to show you how I feel
I know you are waiting for my call
Call out my name into the night

I would rather kill myself right now
Than let a hint of feeling show
What's really going on

I know what you think see what you feel
You know I won't draw back
At night I know you're waiting for my call

Take my Hand and I'll lead you through the night
Caught in the heat of love again
Why do we always have to fight?
And we never ever get enough
Take my Hand I will save you from the fall
Too proud to show you how I feel
I know you are waiting for my call
Call out my name into the night

When I fall for your touch
In the night I can't hide
When I call for your love
And I feel you tonight
When we lose all control
We won't hide anymore

Take my Hand and I'll lead you through the night
Caught in the heat of love again
Why do we always have to fight?
And we never ever get enough

Take my Hand I will save you from the fall
Too proud to show you how I feel
I know you are waiting for my call
Call out my name into the night into the night
And I feel you tonight
