Oh, I feel the fire but you are cold
Look into my eyes why don't you hear my call
You're my obsession come fly with me
It's all you wanted love to be

You bring me up I'm flying
You bring me down I'm crying
Don't want to live on my own

Why don't you stay by me
Don't turn away and see
I'm the one and all I have done I've done for you
Why don't you stay by me don't turn away from me
Cause all I want is you I can't sleep all night through
Can't get you out of my mind all I want is you

Oh, live every moment love every day
My eternal vision for a better way
I hear you laughing so nice and bland
I think I'm dying when you take my hand

You bring me up I'm flying
You bring me down I'm crying
Don't want to live on my own

Why don't you stay by me
Don't turn away and see
I'm the one and all I have done I've done for you
Why don't you stay by me stay by me
Don't turn away and see
All I want is you All I want is you All I want is you

Why don't you stay by me
Don't turn away and see stay by me
Yes all I want is you I can't stop loving you

Why don't you stay by me
Don't turn away away from me
Cause all I want is you
I can't sleep all night through
Can't get you out of my mind
Can't get you out of my mind
All I want is you
