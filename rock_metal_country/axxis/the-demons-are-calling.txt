Light's above, shadows fly
The night will show the signs in the sky
A screaming noise, more and more
Someone has opened the door

Creatures crawl and spread about
Black wings of night are beating deadly loud
Flashing lights, eyes glow red
Am I alive or am I dead

When the demos are calling out my name
In my dreams, my fever
The demons are calling out my name
The are grabbing and touching and burning
They've captured my mind

A fire burns in my mind
Fading thoughts are living on behind
Subconscious will be dangerzone
Now I reap all the seeds I've sown

Creatures claws at my neck
Drag their niles across my back
Dreams at night don't disappear
It was more than fless and blood could bear

When the demos are calling out my name
In my dreams, my fever
The demons are calling out my name
The are grabbing and touching and burning
They've captured my mind

Creatures crawl, spread about
A screaming noise, deadly loud
An open door, the gate of hell
They're breaking out, hear them yell:

We come - We kill - We fight - Now

When the demos are calling out my name
In my dreams, my fever
The demons are calling out my name
The are grabbing and touching and burning
Like a flame - Like a flame

Grabbing, touching, burning
Still in my mind
