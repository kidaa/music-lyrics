More, more, I hear your voices crying
My sweat is running
My heartbeat is loud
The spots are burning like fire
High above
Restless, you can't get enough

Voices, I hear your voices and obey
Voices, and our voices singing every day

Now we're singing for a song
For a song we play
Now we're singing for a song
This time, and every day

The crazy crowd is screaming for more
It takes no end
You want more and more
Your hands are moving
Like waves in the sea
I'm exhausted, but I`m feeling free

Voices, I hear your voices and obey
Voices, and our voices singing every day

Now we're singing for a song
For a song we play
Now we're singing for a song
This time, and every day
