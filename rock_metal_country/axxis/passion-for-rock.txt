My state of elation
Into the light
Will energize my blood like oil ignites
Feel the temptation
Don't take the blame
I'll start the fire with a little blame

Cos I will rock
Coz I still rock
The passion for rock
A passion for life
I will fly
The passion for rock
A passion for life

We can make it if we try
Hey, generation
Where is your face
When will you ever awake out of your daze
There's only one
One point of view
When I'm on stage and looking down to you

I will rock
Cos I will rock
Coz I still rock
The passion for rock
A passion for life
I will fly
The passion for rock
A passion for life

My life my view l a million walls I run through
I stand alone l the more I fight I'm on my own
I feel no control l undying drug called "rock'n'roll"
See the faces eyes shine bright
Oh let us be one crowd tonight-tonight-tonight

I will rock
Coz I still rock
The passion for rock
A passion for life
I will fly
The passion for rock
A passion for life

The passion for rock l the passion
A passion for life l for rock
We can make it if we try
