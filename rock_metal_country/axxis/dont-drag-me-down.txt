I get lost in jungle
In the endless world wide web
A million spiders crawling - I never saw this yet

Instructions how to kill and to announce your suicide
People who wanna die could read advices like:
''Don't stop, don't be late - kill yourself don't wait
Now is the time to show if you really wanna go!''

I was shocked about this
This community of death
Where members push people to take their last breath

Buy drugs!
Deadly cocktails! This is the point of no return
One step into the fire and you will burn
Let us pray to god

Don't drag me down - leave the spiders on their net
Let them crawl - don't carry out your threat
Don't drag me down - only when you really seek
There's something you will find don't listen now
Shadows are crawling

I'm walking through this modern graveyard
Where people boast about their deeds
Future victims talking
All this makes my flesh creep

Sometimes - isolated
Behind a mask - out of control
A fall into silence, into a deep hole

Don't stare at the screen - susceptible to poison
Don't give up and go - back to real life
And I pray loud

Don't drag me down - leave the spiders on their net
Let them crawl - don't carry out your threat
Don't drag me down - life is better than it seems
Don't listen now when you can hear the shadows crawling

Don't drag me down - leave the spiders on their net
Let them crawl - don't carry out your threat
Don't drag me down - life is better than it seems
Don't listen now when you can hear the shadows crawling

Don't drag, drag me down into this modern graveyard
Don't drag, drag me down don't let me fall
