A black sun is arising dark clouds up ahead
No way out no relief pain is your best friend
Red sky means no sunset blood it fills the sky
Fog and rain and ice and snow your forecast never lies

These thoughts are lying
Make your heart dying
Now stop the crying
Birds are still flying

Life it's making you cry now open your heart
Life can give you a sign don't let yourself fear fear

Don't break your soul you'll find a way out
But you're watching how the shadows fall
Don't break your soul there is a way out
But you don't trust your eyes you believe all your lies

You can't run forever face your demons now
Drive'em out let'em fall you can resist their call
You have once been happy once upon a time
A fairy-tale it may come true once in a while

Don't you die forever you've got time ahead
The eyes of your worst enemy the mirror tells you

Don't break your soul you'll find a way out
But you're watching how the shadows fall
Don't break your soul there is a way out
But you don't trust your eyes you believe all your lies
Can burn like flames

Don't break your soul you'll find a way out
You're driving the shadows away
Don't you break your soul there is a way out
Open your mind lies can burn like flames
