We were forced to work
Forced to obey
We were dependent in every way
Oh yes, we've produced
And they've cashed in 
So they've improved us
They always win
And our might grows day by day
Yes, forever we'll stay

Kings made of steel
Hold the world in their hands
Something that we couldn't foresee
Kings made of steel
Have taken their chance
Humans are praying for mercy

They've built us to kill
We kill them all
Built us to rule
Rule over all

Now we are the masters
They are the slaves
They've dug their own
Their own graves
And our might grows day by day
Yes, forever we'll stay

Kings made of steel
Hold the world in their hands
Something that we couldn't foresee
Kings made of steel
Have taken their chance
Humans are praying for mercy

Kings made of steel
Drag humns to tjeir graves
Kings made of steel
Change masters into slaves
Kings made of steel
Take the world with fear and fright
We pay for our way into hell

Kings made of steel
Hold the world in their hands
Something that we couldn't foresee
Kings made of steel
Have taken their chance
Humans are praying for mercy
