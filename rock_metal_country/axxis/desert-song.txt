The world - the world has changed its old face
From blue to grey if you watch it from space

Oh mother earth you're giving sun - you're giving rain
Without a hope there will be nothing to remain

How could we sleep so quietly?
Why are we sure we can survive?

I can see the desert
I'm gonna miss the rain
I can see the desert
I will go insane

Go out - out there to turn back the wheel
of time, of fate, of my destiny
So take this chance nobody will show you the way
and if you don't - if you don't we'll fade away

How could we sleep so quietly?
Why are we sure we can survive?

I can see a desert
I'm gonna miss the rain
I can see a desert
I will go insane

How could we sleep so quietly?
Why are we sure we can survive?

I can see a desert
I'm gonna miss the rain
I can see a desert
I will go insane
