Please, save my soul, I cry
Before my love does die

And such a feeling I have never had before
I will never ever love anyone at all

I know it's true
All dreams come true
How could an angel break my heart like you do
Out of the blue
There is no angel of love
...Without you

Lets find the starry sky
Before you say good bye

As light as a feather I am flyin' high above
It ain't over till it's over - lost in love

I know it's true
All dreams come true
How could an angel break my heart like you do
Out of the blue
There is no angel of love
...Without you
