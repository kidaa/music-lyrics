Time, will show us a better day
A better day we both could use
I know there's no other way
Another way we both would lose

So here we are, again
woman and man
With our hearts, in hand
Sinkin' in the sand

Stay don't leave me, don't turn away
Love will prove what friend are for

Stay don't leave me, don't turn away
Love will prove what friend are for
What friend are for

Life, plays like a funnt game
A twisted rain, falls while we pray
I belive, we will love again
And 'till the end we both will stay

But here we are, again
Tyrin' to understand
What went wrong, we long
Cryin' out our song

Stay don't leave me, don't turn away
Love will prove what friend are for

Stay don't leave me, don't turn away
Love will prove what friend are for
What friend are for

Here we are again
Woman and man
With our hearts, we long
Cryin' out our song

Stay don't leave me, don't turn away
Love will prove what friend are for

Stay don't leave me, don't turn away
Love will prove what friend are for
What friend are for
