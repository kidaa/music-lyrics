Will god remember me?
Will god remember me?

The rain is falling down to earth this night my dear
A cold wind's covering my face l we're all in fear
Mighty clouds above the town will grow tonight
And the darkness creeps slowly down

The prince of darkness is floating in the sky
A flood of shadows l all the brightness dies
The prophecy will go on till we've died
Now we know the holy book has never lied

Will god remember me?
Will god remember me?
Will god remember me?
Will god remember me?
And the shadows hide

I feel the end oh my lord where are you now
How should I pray to escape l tell me how
Read the writings on the wall l but we don't care
Ignoring all the signs everywhere

This is the time l time
The world kneels down to pray
Our redemption will come closer day by day
We see the signs but we're going on Absurd
The prediction
Will be fulfilled Word by word

Will god remember me?
Will god remember me?
Will god remember me?
Will god remember me?
We're just a moment in time

Just a moment in time
Just a moment in time
Will be close when we die
Where is god now what have we done

A world of sickness to overcome
We're virus we are a shame
We set the world now aflame

Will god remember me?
Will god remember me?
How should I pray to escape?
Will god remember me?
Will god remember me?
And the shadows hide l And the shadows hide
