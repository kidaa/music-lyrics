There's a shining in the sky
It's a really good friend of mine
A light from high above
A mysterious, magic sign

Well, it covers everything with grey
When the day is away
And I'm praying when it's there
That your light be everywhere

Shine on me - shine on me brother
You have to shine on through the night
Shine on me - shine on me brother
I welcome brother moon tonight
Shine on me - shine on me brother

Welcome brother - welcome brother moonlight
Welcome brother - welcome brother moonlight
Welcome brother - welcome brother moonlight
Welcome brother - welcome brother moonlight
