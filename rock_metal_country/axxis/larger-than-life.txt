Feel the beat - hear the sound
Feeling so excited
Blazing eyes all around
Are watching me this night

Fade away reality
Feeling like a child
Another world that set me free
My heart is beating wild

Larger than life
All these days and this nights
Bathing in fame and in glory
Larger than life
You wanna see in my eyes
A hero, an idol for you
...I'm larger than life

All the towns I've seen
Many unknown places
Yellow, red, bland and white
All the foreign faces

Countries all around the world
Borders lost their meaning
Supersonic aeroplanes
We sat inside and dreaming

Larger than life
All these days and this nights
Bathing in fame and in glory
Larger than life
All that you see in my eyes
Am I really an idol
Am I - larger than life?

Blazing eyes!
All your looks let me live and survive
And you - you keep me alive.
You're dreaming and screaming
With you I'm larger than life
