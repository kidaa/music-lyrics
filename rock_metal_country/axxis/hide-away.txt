Like a black bird in the night
The shadows walk on ice
I will float down silently
Like a soul in flight

Bringing you my gift tonight
Put in words of love
Kisses like the coldest night
Come from high above

I was exiled to my dyin'
Captured by a spell
Mourning keeps my spirit flyin'
Out of my cold cell

'Cross the field of separation
To the house of pain
Slippin' through the bedroom window
Next to you again

So now you know - you can't hide away
I come and go - there's no hide away
So now you know - you can't hide away
I come and go - there's no hide away
I come and go

When the twilight promises
A new day to begin
You'll find my place beside you
Is cold again

You may feel an other's touch
But in your soul and heart
I'll keep stayin' for all time
As long as we're apart

So now you Know - you can't hide away
I come and go - there's no hide away
So now you know - you can't hide away
I come and go - there's no hide away
I come and go
