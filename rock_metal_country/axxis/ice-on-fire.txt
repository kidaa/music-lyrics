People calling
My heart is beating wild
Nervous and excited I'm waiting for show time
Now it's time and the lights go out
I feel I could die...the people cry and shout
I don't wanna go out

Someone's pushing me - there's no way back - I fall...
...into another world - the spotlights hit my soul
Here I can meet you all

Ice on fire and it burns
I can feel the sweat running my heart's beating wild
Ice on fire and I'm turning around
See me and feel me and hear what I say...
Ice on fire

Burning, beating
You're calling out my name
It's a temptation to go insane
Living in a world where I meet my other side
I feel the passion, it makes me feel allright
I feel it every night

Ice on fire and it burns
I can feel the sweat running, my heart's beating wild
Ice on fire and I'm turning around
See me and feel me and hear what I say
Ice on fire and it burns
In my paradise I'm breaking the ice

See me and hear what I say in my paradise
I'm falling into this world, where I'm breaking the ice

Ice on fire and it burns
I can feel the sweat running, my heart's beating wild
Ice on fire and I'm turning around
See me and feel me and hear what I say
Ice on fire and it burns
In my paradise I'm breaking the ice
