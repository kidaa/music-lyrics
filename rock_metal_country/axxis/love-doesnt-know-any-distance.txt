The day is gone - tears in your eyes
Now I know what I never realized
You're alone and I'm far away
I hear your voice - calling me day by day
Day by day

From show to show - from town to town
There's no rest - sometimes I feel bound
Ups and downs all the way
That put pur love to the test everyday

I want you - you want me - dreams come true
I want you - you want me - dreams come true

I keep on waiting for the day
We will live together
Belive me when I say...
...that love doesn't know any distance

I'm longing for a place with you
Belive in me - our dreams will come true
Now I try to build up what I'm aiming for
Please be patient - I don't want anymore

I want you - you want me - dreams come true
I want you - you want me - dreams come true

I keep on waiting for the day
We will live together
Belive me when I say...
...that love doesn't know any distance

At any time and any place
I feel your love - I see your smiling face
tyring to understand...

...that love doesn't know any distance
I want you - You want me - dreams come true
