Cold rain above
Ice on the floor
No more love
I even the score
I broke the chains
Of what you call life

You life in a box
I'm standing outside
You life in the dark
But I found the light
I've got no prison
Like you and your type

Watch out
Watch out - I'm the enemy
Watch out
Watch out for a man like me

Watch out - I'm the enemy
Get off my liberty
Watch out - all I wanna be
Footloose and fancy free

I need to loose everything
Finding the truth
Make me a real king
A new horizon, growin' up before my eyes

Watch out - I'm the enemy
Get off - get off my liberty
Watch out - what I wanna be
Footloose and fancy free

Watch out
Watch out - I'm the enemy
Watch out
Watch out - I'm the enemy
