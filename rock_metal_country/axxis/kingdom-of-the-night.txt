Dreaming, Dreaming in the cold night
I wish I were a big and famous star
Then I'm the king of a thousand queens
With golden rings and dirty jeans
Pots of money, and I'm feeling free

Move your legs, stamp your feet
Hear my voice you're gonna rock with me
The rhythm leads, the rhythm beats
Feel the beat and find another world

Allright, allright
I've got the kingdom of the night
Allright, allright
I've got the kingdom of the night

Screaming, Screaming in the wild crowd
Let me see you all raise your hands
I wanna dream, dream forever
Never waking up, no never
Oh, bring back this dream
And let us scream again
Move your legs, stamp your feet

Allright, allright
I've got the kingdom of the night
Allright, allright
I've got the kingdom of the night
