Can you read the stars - look in the future
Can you see what's going on with me
Feel the beat - the rhythm of the living
Ther is no time - there is no time...
...open my eyes...

Shadows are crawling on the wall of conscience
How do you feel when thoughts fill up your mind?
You never can hide - that might - all visions
Please foresee what will be with me life

And you get a flash - you get a light
All the pictures in your mind
Are living in that twilight zone

Shadows of the night. Shadows of the light
Never really hide with a second sight
A flash - A light - A sign

Shadows of the night. Shadows of the light
I can feel the magic might
It is not easy - walking in your mind with a second sight

Can you belive in stars and see the future
Would you change your live just 'cos you know
If I should know when I will die,
Would I be crazy or would I cry
I would give up my life and my soul

And I get a flash - get a light
All the pictures in my mind
Make life dependent of that twilight zone

Shadows of the night. Shadows of the light
Never really hide with a second sight
A flash - A light - A sign

Shadows of the night. Shadows of the light
Living in a prision of a magic might
Walking in your mind with a second sight

And the devilis dance goes round and round
You run yourself into the ground
By keeping all the secrets

Shadows of the night. Shadows of the light
Living in a prision of a magic might
The stars - The spell - Twilight

Shadows of the night. Shadows of the light
In the twilight zone you are on your own
Walking in your mind - With second sigh
