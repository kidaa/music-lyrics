When I jump to the left - you jump to the right
When I am dressing in black - you are dressing in white
You always do the opposite of everything I do
It I should name this kind of loving I would say to you

It's a little war - I get used to this fight
Like a little war - we're fighting side by side
Like a little war - the more we fight the more we love
Like a little war - we can't get enough

When I feel weak - you're got the power
When I'm late for a minute - you're late for an hour
I don't know the reason why we go to extremes
I feel that we need each other more than it seems

It's a little war - I get used to this fight
Like a little war - we're fighting side by side
Like a little war - the more we fight the more we love
Like a little war - we can't get enough
A little war

And when we're not together - you know it's really true
We feel we need each other more than this war
We belong together like summer and cold ice
The fight belongs to our love - that's what we're realized
A little war

In this little war - I get used to this fight
Like a little war - we're fighting side by side
Like a little war
Like a little war

The more we fight, the more love
We can't get enough
