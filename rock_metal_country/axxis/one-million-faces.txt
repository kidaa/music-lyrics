A long trek of people
Coming from everywere
Lost parents - Lost children
Their faces in despair

Could you realize
In all these starring eyes
Last hopes have blown away
Whose prize do they have to pay?

One million faces
The sign of war in their eyes
Deep in europe - oh, it's a shame

One million faces
With broken hearts and broken souls
I ask my self: Can we take the blame?
We fan the flames

Even my land has sent
Some rockets to this land
Exploding, destroying
Don't know how this could help

The rhythm of a war is beating more and more
Don't really understand
People suffering so badly just miles away

One million faces
The sign of war in their eyes
Deep in europe - oh, it's a shame

One million faces
With broken hearts and broken souls
Mistreated! mistreated
