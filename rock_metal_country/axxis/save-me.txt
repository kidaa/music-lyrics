Save me
The earth was young
When I was sown
Deep inside this land

Save me
Helpless I stand here alone
Waiting for my end

Save me 
Centuries have flown away
But I known my time has come

Save me
No escape I cannot stay
Do stay know what they have done!

Save me
If you save me you'll save yourself
Why don't you understand

Save me
Your fate will be sealed
If you destroy me
You will live in a wasteland

My life is your life
And your life is mine
We belong together
Since the beginning of all time

If I were a man
I know what I would think:
