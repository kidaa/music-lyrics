You watch the clouds and dream
Follow the flight of birds
Try to describe the feeling
But you can find no words

If you could be a bird
Then you'd be really free
Fly into the light
On to the rainbow that you see

Tough the rainbow
And all dreams come true
Spread your wings and 
Feel the breathe of the wind

Tough the rainbow 
And all dreams come true
Fly high
To breath the air of the sky

Colours of endless beauty
Painting the deep blue sky
Stairway to heaven
Where only eagles fly

Do you see ist beginning?
Do you see ist end
Only birds know the secret
As they come fly'ing across the land

Tough the rainbow
And all dreams come true
Spread your wings and 
Feel the breathe of the wind

Tough the rainbow 
And all dreams come true
Fly high
To breath the air of the sky
