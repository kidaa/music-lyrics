Can you hear the sirens
There's a house ablaze
Bald - headed drunken guys are starring at a strangers face

A sea of flames is spreding
The night is glowning bright
The shadows of the past are back with their scary pride

Now the sun goes down...

When the sun goes down, the new nightmares will arise
And the night will burn while we are sleeping
When the sun goes down - It's to late to realize
Idolaters take shape in this world...
The sun goes down
A gathering of loosers
so mighty in a crowd
shouting out stupid slogans - unthinking - no doubts

Misguided cowards
Let's put them all in chains
Following their leaders without using their brains

Yes, the sun goes down...

When the sun goes down, the new nightmares will arise
And the night will burn while we are sleeping
When the sun goes down - It's to late to realize...

Don't let them be stronger
Wake up right away
The root of all evil encriaches...
...day by day

When the sun goes down, the new nightmares will arise
And the night will burn while we are sleeping
When the sun goes down - It's to late to realize
Idolaters take shape in this world...
...the sun goes down
