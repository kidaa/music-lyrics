Brothers killing brothers
In our neighbourhood
All we do is stare

Blood runs out of
The television screen
The blame is ours to share

When freedom comes
For everyone
Out of the blue
A world as new
When freedom comes
For everyone
A new life has begun

Thought it was god given
That life in peace and wealth
Freedom was for everyone

Livin' in a small world
Isolated from the truth
Waitin' for the sun

When freedom comes
For everyone
Out of the blue
A world as new
When freedom comes
For everyone
A new life has begun
