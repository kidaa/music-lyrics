Spreding out the wings of night - Overtaking all mankind
Getting back the crown to rule again over the kingdom  of the night!

Now the time has come, when he open up his eyes...
...the eyes of the darkness

Can you hear the bells chime for the final goodbye.
Read the signs everywhere and beware

A million ravens will fly
Will hide the sun and the sky
They stand for every soul
That once a demon stole

The fall of burning rain
Suffocates the world in pain
Watch out for the signs
Watching the skies
Watch out for these red burning eyes

My eyes - in the darkness of your life
No scape, your world is mine
Everywhere my shadows fly

Eyes of the darkness - sings out of twilight
Look - face to face in the abyss of time
Eyes of the darkness watching the world now
Demons of darkness take shape in this world
And they stay... they stay... they stay

Can you hear the bells chime - life has passed you by
All the signs I have send - prophesasing your end

I'm a creature of dust
Feel the greed and the lust
Look in the mirror of pride
You see my eyes open wide

Forever darkness and night
Isuffocate your world with my might
See the heaven is black, there's no way back,
Invite you to the world of the dead

Eyes of the darkness - sings out of twilight
Look - face to face in the abyss of time
Eyes of the darkness watching the world now
Demons of darkness take shape in this world
...and they stay

Hear the bells! there's no way back.
Your world is mine. I'm still alive!

Can you hear the bells chime for the final goodbye
All the signs I have send - prophesasing your end...
