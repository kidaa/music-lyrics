I turn the radio off
Don't wanna hear that crap
All this computer stuff
Sounds like a handicap

They rap and hip and hop
they cover songs and sounds
they just create their style
stealing ideas from all around

I don't wanna change you, I don't say I'm right
their Music is a mirror of a world full of ice
Everybody fights alone, searching peace of mind

Hear the flashback radio - turn it loud the speakers blow
It will hit your ears, your heart and touch your soul

Hear the flashback radio - try the flashback-music-show
unforgotten songs and everlasting sounds

It's gonna make me sick
it's all this techno hype
can't hear is anymore
Oh, I don't like this vibes

Songs for the passing craze
come in a rush in and out
forgotten in the haze
lost in the mindless outer space

I don't wanna change you, I don't say I'm right
their music is a mirror of a world full of ice
Everybody fights alone, searching peace of mind

Hear the flashback radio - turn it loud- the speakers blow
It will hit your ears, your heart and touch your soul.

Hear the flashback radio ...
