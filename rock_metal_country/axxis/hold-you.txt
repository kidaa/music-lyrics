I see my life like a ship in the rain
Sometimes lost in the ocean
There's no aim it's drifting away
Tere's no wind tp set it in motion

Silence spreads itt's wings in the air
I can hear the waves whispering
And then i know what life means to me
The endless waiting for a sign

I wanna hold you in my arms
I wanna hold you in my arms

Sea of hope in the ocean of life
You can hear the voices singing
I search alone to find my way
To the shoreline of beginning

Huh When the wind turns to you
You feel a fresh breeze hits your sails
The voice of life whispers and sings

I wanna hold you in my arms
I wanna hold you in my arms

Through the storm 
Through the thunder and rain
With hopes and dreams
I search for an aim
Journeys beginning 
Voices are singing

I wanna hold you in my arms
I wanna hold you in my arms
