Got to know the people all around
Feeling like a preacher and a clown
Got a chance and I've paid the price
Now I know the million lies

My good old friends don't understand
I still believe in my band
I know the time is not the same
And you want me to play this game

Why not - why not - why not
Why not - I wanna get a lot
Why not - I can't get enough
Of my first love

Music was the first love of my life
It's the reason why I feel alive
But all the promises of liars
Burning inside like a fire

Sometimes the business is the shame
I don't need glory and fame
Do they believe we lost our way
But no, no, no, we'll stay

Why not - why not - why not
Why not - I wanna get a lot
Why not - I can't get enough
Why not...
I can't get enough
I wanna get enough
I don't need glory
