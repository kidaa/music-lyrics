Nothing's gonna steal my energy
Hell on earth when I break free - I'm burning - just like fire
My veins are full of elecricity
My blood is the current that's pushing me up - higher and higher

Don't hold me back - don't lock me up
Don't try to block, what even walls can't stop

I would bang my head against a brick wall
I can't stop doing things I wanna do

I would bacn my head against a brick wall
I can't stop doing things I wanna do

Overdosed with rock n'roll - I'm feeling out, out of control
I'm rockin'g an I'm rollin'

I never cool down - I never cool of
You can't stop me when I', blasting off
I'm exploding

Don't hold me back - don't lock me up
Don't try to block, what even walls can't stop

I would bang my head against a brick wall
I can't stop doing things I wanna do

I would back my head against a brick wall
I can't stop doing things I wanna do

Don't smoke, don't drick, sit down, shut up,
don't bug me,
Don't touch me, back off, get lost, I bang

I always break out - I'm full of energy
I can't restrain what I wanna be
Don't hold me back - don't lock me up
Don't try to block what even walls can't stop

I would bang my head against a brick wall
I can't stop doing things I wanna do

I would back my head against a brick wall
I can't stop doing things I wanna do

I would bang
Against a brick wall
I would bang
Against a brick wall
A brick wall
