lane driver
the forces against you, the rain
i know everybody wants to put you down
but i know everybody's gonna put me down
i want you
because i'm rushing to feel you
but i won't set you down, i don't need to
[x2]
fly fly fly fly fly fly fly
don't try try try try try
it's a brand new era, it feels great
it's a brand new era but it came too late
she won't let you know that i need a right to touch her
she won't let you wait for me
for me to touch you
crowds of the people and voices and steeples and wedding rings
wild are the horses and break-up divorces and seperate rooms from
My my my my my my my
 I love your tinted eyes
So bad, so bad, so so bad so so bad
She won't let me break you out
When the picture's cut it free  
three of us is enough
it's the simple stuff i need
can't you see the stuff i need?
can't you see?
can't you stuff me?
stuff me.
