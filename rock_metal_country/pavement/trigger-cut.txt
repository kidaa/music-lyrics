Lies and betrayals
Fruit-covered nails
Electricity and lust won't break the door
I've got a heavy coat- it's filled with rocks and sand
And if i lose it i'll be comin' back today
i've got a message for you
i'll be comin' back today
i keep it in my hand
you know i'm comin' back one day
i've got a sister or two 
and i'll be comin' back today
ex-magician, still knows the tricks
tricks are everything to me
until it's free- i've got a trigger cut
and i can't pull it back
but if i learn how i'll be coming back today
i've got a message for you
i'll be coming back today
i keep it in my hand
you just look at me and say
i've got a sister or two 
you know i wish you went away
i learned the truth
the truth of the words
truth i made for you
because it's just as good
and if i spit it out
before i chew the ring 
i'll rearrange it
'til it looks just right today
i've got a message for you
and i'll be comin' back back my way
i keep it in my hand
you will look at me and say
i've got a sister or two
you just wish i went away
