come on in...
grave architecture x2 
walk the marble malls [?]
the monuments to those who fall
and it's a pocket less than narco shell-bit
stiff the crypt and the others are rough
and the hood's so rad
and i'm fucking glad
glad to see that, know what it means
it takes a lot
grave architecture x2
stroll past the strip
is it old? am i clipped?
am i just a bathtub waiting to be gripped
or found on shady ground?
and the lampshade's poised on the overwhelm
drugs, and need the talent to breathe
it takes a lot
oh yeah, you wanna be like a blind fish
positive, we're positive-- go!
takes a lock-grip, baby
to put you to war
and i'm pushin' you back than ever ???
that'll push you hard
it takes em......
