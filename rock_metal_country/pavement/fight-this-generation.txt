woke up to people so tall to you
i can't so i won't stand 
up chuck break luck
look for the splinters you might see where they come in
go down, sweet yardley
i won't let you fall down, sweet yardley
i won't let you fall down, here, now
ah- god damn the guts and the gore
nobody's crying 'cause there's no one to score for
come up sweet randy 
i won't let you fall -what you got to lose?
what you got to prove? 
who you gonna screw down here? ..now
here now ..i am.. here now..i am... here... now...
your life is about to-to come
away from the mirror in a rainshed
generation
fight this generation x 15 or so
stop right
