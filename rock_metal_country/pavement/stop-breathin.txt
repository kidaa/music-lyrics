got struck by the first volley
of the war in the corps
never held my service
send em a wire, give em my best
this ammunition never rests
no one serves coffee, no one wakes up
stop breathin' 
stop breathin' 
breathin' for me now
write it on a postcard: 
dad they broke me. 
dad they broke me.
[repeat]
i can see the lines open shutters
and the leaves flocked on a grid
that's what they made my hero say
but nothing gets me off so completely 
but when you put it down
ten feet down in the ground
call and response in the negative home
stop breathin' 
stop breathin' 
breathin' for me now
write it on a postcard: 
dad they broke me. 
dad they broke me.
[repeat]
