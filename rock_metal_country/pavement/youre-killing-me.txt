you're killing me
you're killing me again
it's not my fault
it's not my fault again
a sign, a sign, a sign on the door
you're killing me
you're killing me again
you're killing me
you're killing me again
it's not my fault
it's not my fault again
there's a line, a line, a line for the whore
you're killing me
you're killing me again
