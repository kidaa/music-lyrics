well you greet the tokens and stamps
beneath the fake-oil burnin' lamps
in the city we forgot to name
the concourse is four-wheeled shame
and the courthouse's double-breast
i'd like to check out your public protests
why you're complaining Ta!
you sleep with electric guitars 
range rovin' with the cinema stars
and i wouldn't want to shake their hands
'cause they're in such a high-protein land
because there's 40 different shades of black
so many fortresses and ways to attack
so why you complaining? Ta!
