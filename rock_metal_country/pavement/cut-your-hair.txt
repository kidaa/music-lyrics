darlin' don't you go and cut your hair
do you think it's gonna make him change?
";i'm just a boy with a new haircut";
and that's a pretty nice haircut
charge it like a puzzle, hit me wearin' muzzles
hesitate to die, look around, around, the second drummer's drowned
his telephone is found
music scene is crazy, bands start up each and every day
i saw another one just the other day
a special new band
i remember lying
i don't remember lies
i don't remember what 
but i don't care, i care, i really don't care
did you see the drummer's hair?
advertising looks and chops a must
no big hair!!
songs mean a lot
when songs are bought
and so are you-
bitch, rant down to the practice room
attention and fame so
career, career, career....
