Started in the old south
i brought it to the new west
sold it for a dry claim
i bought it back the hard way
i've got a mine thats fine
isn't it the best one yet?
i bought it in '49
i've got a mine thats fine
heard about your bad fall
i guess its just the rock's fault
i bet you need some old south
i'll sell it for your gold teeth
i've got a mind thats fine
i swear its the best one yet
i bought it in '49
i've got a mind thats fine
she was just a moaner
she was never saved
bruises in my stomach fight
i fed it to my engine
i've got a mind thats fine
i swear it's the best one yet
i bought it in '49
i've got a mine thats fine
i've got a mine thats fine
i've got a mine thats fine
i've got a mine thats fine
i've got a mine thats fine.
