maybe somone's gonna save me
my heart is made of gravy
and the laps i swim from lunatics don't count
open up your stocking
pull out all the things you never wanted
'til room service calls
room service calls
open up your hands and let me see the things you keep in there
i want to split up fifty-fifty
that's the way we do it in this rogue's town
i've got all the glory in the world
and i hope it doesn't floor you before you go
room service calls
in the random falls -- go!
whenever x6 eve eve ever i feel fine 
i'm gonna walk away
from All This, all That.
the groovy groovy kitty and little little pity
with your slipshed ? watch in back
and skinny skinny people don't like that
when you call on them
spell me.
spritzer on ice in new york city
isn't it a pity?
you never had anything to mix with that
listen to the tender behind the open chest in the hall
room service calls
i'm blue 'n green, green and blue-oooo
whenever x4 ne ne ne ne never ho
i feel fi-i-ine, i'll walk the plank for you
i'll walk the plank
i wore your ?plank? for you in the d-d-d-d-dark 
of the captain seder row?
Jacob, Jacob Javitz, i'd like to thank you for everything
primarily your glass house
i'm workin' the ballin' stores 'n 
i'm cashmir wrap sellin'
come along lads, join hands, 1. 2. 3. go!          guess, levis, guess, levis
whaaaahahaahahooohoaoohoo
