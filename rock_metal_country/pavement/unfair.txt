down to Santa Rosa HALF MOON BAY
across the grapevine to L.A.
we've got deserts, we've got trees
we've got the hills of Beverly
let's burn the hills of Beverly!!
walk with your credit card in the air!!
swing your nachos like you just don't care!! your guess is as good as mine
this is the slow sick sucking part of me
this is the slow sick sucking part of me
and when i'm sucking kisses diee..worrkk [??]
up to the top of shasta gulch
and to the bottom of the tahoe lakes
manmade deltas and concrete rivers
the south takes what the north delivers
you fill hack???
lost in the foothills of my MIND
drinking STERNO, say good night
to the LAST PSYCHEDELIC BAND
FROM sac'to, northern cal.
FROM sac'to northern cal.
take it; neighbor; cuz you're my neighbor; 
and i mean famous; you're my neighbor; 
you do me favors; cuz i'm your neighbor; 
i'm not your neighbor, you bakersfield trash.
