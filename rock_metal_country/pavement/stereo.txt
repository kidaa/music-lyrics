Pigs, they tend to wiggle when they walk
the infrastructure rots
and the owners hate the jocks
with their agents and their dates
if the signatures are checked
you'll just have to wait
and we're counting up the instants that we save
tired nation so depraved
from the cheap seats see us
wave to the camera
it took a giant ramrod
to raze the demon settlement
but high-ho silver, ride
high-ho silver, ride
take another ride to see me home
listen to me! i'm on the stereo stereo
oh my baby baby baby baby babe
gave me malaria hysteria
what about the voice of geddy lee
how did it get so high?
i wonder if he speaks like an ordinary guy?
i know him and he does!
and you're my fact-checkin' cuz
Aww...
well focus on the quasar in the mist
the kaiser has a cyst
and i'm a blank want list
the qualms you have and if they stick
they will drown you in a crick
in the neck of a woods
that was populated by
tired nation on the fly
everybody knows advice
that was give out for free
lots of details to discern
lots of details
but high-ho silver ride
high-ho silver ride
takes another ride to make me
oh, get off the air
i'm on the stereo stereo
oh my baby baby baby baby baby babe
gave me malaria hysteria
