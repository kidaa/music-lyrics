when they fall in they fall in from the roof
they grab on to me tightly as if i knew the way
when i fight for something i fight because i care
when i fight with you i fight but i don't care
everybody wants the questions to be asked
the questions are the answers to questions in themselves
ask me if i really need it
ask me if you want to get hit
hit it
ask me if you want to be...fucked.
