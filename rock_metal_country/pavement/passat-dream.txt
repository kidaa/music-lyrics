You know you've got it all wrong -- there's no other way to find it
You know you gotta be strong -- and I really hope you plan to buy it
'Cause that's the way to Passat, babe
And that's the car to his soul
He will bring you all the millions in gold, child -- if you will only let
him have his role
Everybody wishes you'd gone -- I've got no time to find it
And the dealer with the jingly song will never match my price reduction
'Cause that's the way to Passat, babe
And that's the car to his soul
He will bring you all the millions in gold if you will only let him have
his role
Yeah, you gotta be strong -- there's no other way to fund it
All the plantings are young and able --
and I hope you find a way to buy it
'Cause that's the way to his heart, babe
And that's the way to his soul
You got to give him millions in gold, child --
before I go the way of the sold
And that's the way to his heart, babe
And that's the way to his soul
You've got to give him millions in gold, child --
before I go the way of the sold
