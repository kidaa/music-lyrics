take me down from the ridge where the summer ends
watch the city spread out just like a jet's flame
i've got a secret for you, i cut your angel in two
i left her bleeding and soaked it with a dry sponge
no life has singed her now [3x]
i can see it fade
we've got a license to live, it's our only one
if it expires we float up to the dust haze
i've got a picture of you, i cut your angel in two
i saw her spinning and dripping on your new dress
no life has singed her now [3x]
i can see it fade
