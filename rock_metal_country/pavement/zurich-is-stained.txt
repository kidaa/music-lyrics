i can't sing it strong enough
'cause that kind of strength i just don't have
if you watch the light change 
don't hold them hanging
you think it's easy, but you're wrong
i am not one-half of the problem
zurich is stained and it's not my fault
just hold me back or let me run
what does it mean, a mistake or two?
if it's the kind of mistakes no one can trace
to the fountain where we sold it
and held them hanging
you think it's easy, but you're wrong
i am not one-half of the problem
zurich is stained and it's not my fault
just hold me back or let me run
you think it's easy, but you're wrong
i am not one-half of the problem
zurich is stained and it's not my fault
just hold me back or let me run
