The actress is always breaking things
the things you made and she took you for
And I'm so tired -- I'd be lying -- I hope the prarie buys you more
The fitness coast is growing near
the shores they don't stay blond this year
That's why the marble lawns stay clear and warm in time
I want to stay but my time is wasting
The magic lands call my name
They want to fire a missle launcher
But I know I need to stay
We all know that by staying here it'll be a good high this year
So what's the use to staying there if you've got no use for time
The fitness coast is growing near
the shores they don't stay blond all year
the continent moves with growing fears
It's all for expensive lawn
I want to stay but my time is wasting
The magic lawns call my name
I want to fire a missle launcher
But I know I need to stay
I know I need to stay
and fight the day.
I know I need to stay
and fight the day.
I know I need to stay
and fight the day.
I know I need to stay
and fight the day.
