Ice baby,
I saw your girlfriend and she was
eating her fingers like they're just another meal
but she waits there
in the levee washes
mixin' cocktails with a plastic-tipped cigar
My eyes stick to all the shiny roses 
you wear on the protein delta strip
in an abandoned house but i will wait there
i'll be waiting forever...
i'll wait and wait and wait...
Minerals, ice deposits daily, dropped off
the first shiny robe
i've got a lot of things i want to sell, but
not here, babe-- tortuuurreeee...
every time i sit around i find i'm shot
every time i sit around i find i'm shot
every time i turn around i find i'm shot
every time i sit around i find i'm shot
every time every time...
you're my... summer babe
summer babe
