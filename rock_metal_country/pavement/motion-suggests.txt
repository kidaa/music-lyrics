i traced my family line
it ends up where the 
window-passing grainy days
forgetting she's away
here's the straight and narrow:
brought my wheelbarrow
and it's filled with the lies and the dirt and the hurt
but i won't need someone to let me be
i won't need someone to let me be
up up the counting thrones
and the voice could soothe your
captivate the senses like a ginger ale rain
those who've got the mirror
curse the tainted pharaohs
take off!
respect fun, you might learn how it runs
but i won't need someone to let me be
no i won't need someone to let me be [x2]
no i won't need someone to let me go
let me breathe
