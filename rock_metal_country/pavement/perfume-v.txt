fun for an hour til the hour's gone
can one trick nights feed 40 days?
in my bed at the break of dawn
she shivered like a vein slashed bright and new
she's got the radio active and it makes me feel ok i don't feel ok [x2]
grip-force the vials and strip the locks
smash the set & slash the beds
and when it looks life a wife's ex-plot
we'll cover all the rugs with cheap perfume
she's got the radio active and it makes me feel ok i don't feel ok [repeat]
like a docent's lisp, like a damsel's spit, like a dry gin's twist of lime
like a poor droll sir, like a pike's dull spurs, like a pastor's flock of sheep
