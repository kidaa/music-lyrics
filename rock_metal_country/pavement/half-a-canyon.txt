ahhh!!! shit, baby.
canyon bro', your life is worked in
dream about the witch trials
you get all too lot of pepper in your forecast
beneath the shady mezzanine
keep it when you want to belong...
july fourth, raging fortune
dream about the witch trials
send in the romance of people with their dreadlocks
tied like winshields in the night
keep it when you want to belong...
i keep my head on for pretty jades
i keep my head up for ships and shade
i keep my head up for richie raid?
i keep my head up for guilty rays?
--feel like i'm falling!!
allez! allez! allez! allez! allez! allez! allez! allez!...
