Animation
breathes a cloudless mind
Fascination
leaves the doubting blind
Until the circle breaks and wisdom lies ahead
the faithful live Awake
the rest remain misled
Some will transcend spinning years
One as if time disappears
Innocence faded
the mirror falls behind you
Trinity jaded
I break down walls to find you
Callow and vain
fixed like a fossil, shrouding pain
Passionless stage
Distant like brothers
Wearing apathetic displays
Sharing flesh like envy in cages
Condescending
Not intending to end
Some will transcend spinning years
One as if time disappears
Innocence faded
the mirror falls behind you
Trinity jaded
I break down walls to find you
Beginnings get complicated
the farther we progress
Opinions are calculated
Immune to openness
Beyond the circle's edge
We're driven by her blessings
Forever hesitating
Caught beneath the wheel
Innocence faded
the mirror falls behind you
Cynically jaded
The child will crawl to find you.
