Music by Dream Theater, Lyrics by Petrucci
8:04
Watching my window I was led like a child
As the roadway lamplights
Misguided my mind through the night
A shadow of limits
We were racing the rain
My hands held the wheel
My eyes tried to hold their place
There must have been a time
When I thought that you were watching
It had to be when my senses lost control
I thought I'd slipped away
I thought I could still feel us moving
It must have been a cloud
No bigger than a man's hand
Every reason I risk my life
To come back to you
Is locked behind your door
You're my immunity
Outside I watched you burn
Heavy hearts were bleeding
A cry for help, a familiar voice
My melting hands streaked the glass
As I walked away
I wondered what had really happened
Had I run out of time
Did I push myself to far
As my last step fell
Felt my hands upon the wheel
Had I come back to life
Or did I ever leave at all
In higher lives
We seem to be
Always a moment too late
We're past the time
When we looked on
Now we're
THE ONES WHO HELP TO SET THE SUN
This time for real
I locked the door behind me
My mind was still a wreck
From what I saw
For when my hands are still
I'll recognize the message
Never again will my senses lose control
In higher lives
We seem to be
lways a moment too late
We're past the time
When we looked on
Now we're
THE ONES WHO HELP TO SET THE SUN
