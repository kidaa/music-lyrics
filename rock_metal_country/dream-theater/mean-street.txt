      - David Lee Roth
        Van Halen - from the album Fair Warning
    At night I walk these stinkin' streets
    Past the crazies on my block
    And I see the same old faces
    And I hear that same old talk
    And I'm searching for the latest thing
    A break in this routine
    I'm talkin' some new kicks
    Ones like you ain't never seen
    This is home
    This is Mean Street
    It's our home
    The only one I know
