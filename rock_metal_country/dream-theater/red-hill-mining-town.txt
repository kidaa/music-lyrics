    From Father to Son
    The blood runs thin
    I see faces frozen still against the wind
    The seam is split
    The coal face cracked
    The lines are long
    There's no going back
    Through hands of steel
    And heart of stone
    Our labor day has come and gone
    Yeah, you leave me holding on
    In Red Hill Town
    See lights go down
    Hanging on
    You're all that's left to hold on to
    I'm still waiting
    I'm hanging on
    You're all that's left to hold on to
    Glass is cut
    Bottle runs dry
    Our love runs cold
    In the caverns of the night
    We're wounded by fear
    Injured in doubt
    I can lose myself
    But I can't live without
    Yeah, you keep me holding on
    In Red Hill Town
    See the lights go down
    I'm hanging on
    You're all that's left to hold on to
    I'm still waiting
    Hanging on
    All that's left to hold on to
    We scorch the earth
    Set fire to the sky
    We stoop so low to reach so high
    A link is lost
    The chain undone
    We wait all day
    For night to come
    And it comes
    Like a hunted child
    I'm hanging on
    You're all that's left to hold on to
    I'm still waiting
    I'm hanging on
    You're all that's left to hold on to
    Love slowly stripped away
    Love has seen a better day
    Hanging on
    Lights go out on Red Hill
    Lights go down on Red Hill
    Lights go down on Red Hill Town
    Lights go down on Red Hill
    Lights go down on Red Hill Town
    Lights go down on Red Hill
