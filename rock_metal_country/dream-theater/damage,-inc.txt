    Dealing out the agony within
    Charging hard and no one's gonna give in
    Living on your knees, conformity
    or dying on your feet for honesty
    Inbred, our bodies work as one
    Bloody, but never cry submission
    Following our instinct not a trend
    Go against the grain until the end
    [Chorus:]
       Blood will follow blood
       Dying time is here
       Damage Incorporated
    Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback
    Stepping out?  You'll feel our hell on your back
    Blood follows blood and we make sure
    Life ain't for you and we're the cure
    Honesty is my only excuse
    Try to rob us of it, but it's no use
    Steamroller action crushing all
    Victim is your name and you shall fall
    [Chorus]
    We chew and spit you out
    We laugh, you scream and shout
    All flee, with fear you run
    You'll know just where we come from
       Damage Incorporated
       Go
    Damage jackals ripping right through you
    Sight and smell of this, it gets me goin'
    Know just how to get just what we want
    Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt
    Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
    Never happy ending on these dark sets
    All's fair for Damage Inc. you see
    Step a little closer if you please
    [Chorus]
