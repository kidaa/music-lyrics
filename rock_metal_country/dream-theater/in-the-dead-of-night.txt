      - John Wetton and Eddie Jobson UK - from the album ";UK";
    Are you one of mine who can sleep with one eye open wide?
    Agonizing psychotic solitary hours to decide
    Reaching for the light at the slightest noise from the floor
    Palms of hands perspire,
    Heart goes leaping at a knock from the door.
    In the Dead of Night
    In the Dead of Night
    Rich and powerful ascend complicated bends to be free
    To indulge in what they will and jaded thrill or fantasy
    Shuttered windows that belie all stifled cries from within
    And prying eyes are blind to proceedings of the kind that begin
    In the Dead of Night
    In the Dead of Night
    In the Dead of Night
    In the Dead of Night
