    It's all the same, only the names will change
    Everyday it seems we're wasted away
    Another place where the faces are so cold
    I drive all night
    Just to {...a wise ass} get back home
    I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride {I ride}
    {Uh, wanted} I'm wanted {yah! dead or alive} dead or alive
    Wanted dead or alive {yah! this song sucks}
    {...man this has got to be boring}
    Sometimes I sleep {uh oh, here we go again},
    Sometimes it's not {man, give it a rest} for days
    And people {you suck} I meet always go their separate ways
    Sometimes I tell the day
    By the bottle that you drink
    And times when you're alone {I told ya you suck} all you do is think
    Cause I'm a cowboy {no you're a dick},
    on a steel horse I ride {bah}
    I'm wanted {yah!} dead or alive
    Wanted {wanted} dead or alive
    {...uh check out that, check out that that...}
    {check out this...                           }
    Cause I'm a cowboy,
    on a steel horse I ride {yeah ride this you faggot}
    I'm wanted dead or alive
    {yeah, gimme a gun I'll fuckin shoot you}
    Well I walk the streets {what are you a prostitute?},
    a loaded six string on my back
    {yeah I bet you got something else on your back}
    I play for keeps {yah!},
    'cause I might not make it back {make it back}
    I been everywhere {everywhere},
    still I'm standing tall {standing tall, yeah yeah}
    I've seen a million faces
    And I've rocked them all
    {yeah I'll fuckin rock you, you dick}
    I'm a cowboy {...a cowboy}, on a steel horse I ride
    {...I'll steel horse your lucky faggot}
    I'm wanted {wanted} dead or alive {dead or alive}
    Cause I'm a cowboy {cowboy},
    I got the night on my side {night on my side}
    I'm wanted {wanted} dead or alive, and all right {yeah!}
    Dead or alive
    Still I try {don't try me man}
    Dead or alive {alive}
