Images and Words: Dream Theater
8:21
Just let me catch my breath
I've heard the promises
I've seen the mistakes
I've had my share of tough breaks
I need a new voice, a new law, a new way
To take the time, reevaluate
It's time to pick up the peices,
Go back to square one
I think it's time for a change
There is something that I feel
To be something that is real
I feel the heat within my mind
And craft new challenges with my eyes
Giving freely wandering promises 
A place with decisions I'll fashion
I won't waste another breath
You can feel the waves coming on
It's time to take the time
Let them destroy you or carry you on
It's time to take them time
You're fighting the weight of the world
But no one can save you this time
Close your eyes
You can find all you need in your mind

The unbroken spirit
Obscured and disquiet
Finds clearness this trial demands
And at the end of this day sighs an anxious relief
For the fortune lies still in his hands
If there's a pensive fear, a wasted year
A man must learn to cope
If his obsession's real,
Supression that he feels must turn to hope
Life is no more assuring than love
It's time to take the time
You're fighting the weight of the world
And no one can save you this time
Close your eyes
You can find all that you need in your mind
I close my eyes
And feel the water rise around me
Drown in the beat of time
Let my senses fall away
I cna see much better now, I'm blind
Find all you need in your mind
If you can take the time
