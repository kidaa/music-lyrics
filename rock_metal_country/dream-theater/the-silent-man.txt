A question well served,
'Is silence like a fever?'
'A voice never heard?'
'Or a message with no receiver?'
Pray they won't ask
Behind the stained glass
There's always one more mask
Has man been a victim
of his woman, of his father?
if he elects not to bother,
will he suffocate their faith?
Desperate to fall
Behind the Great Wall
That separates us all
When there is reason
Tonight I'm Awake
when there's no answer
Arrive the Silent Man
If there is balance
tonight He's Awake
If they have to suffer
There lies the Silent Man
Sin without deceivers
A God with no believers
I could sail by
on the Winds of Silence
And maybe they won't notice
But this time I think
It'd be better if I swim
When there is reason
Tonight I'm Awake
When there's no answer
Arrive the Silent Man
If there is balance
Tonight he's Awake
But if they have to suffer
There lies the Silent Man
