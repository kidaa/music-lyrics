There was no time for pain
No energy for anger
The sightlessness of hatred slips away
Walking through winter streets along
He stops and takes a breath
With confidence and self-control
I look at the world and see no understanding
I'm waiting to find some sence of strength
I'm begging you from the bottom of my heart to show me understanding
I need to live life
Like some people never will
So find me kindness
Find me beauty
Find me truth
When temptation brings me to my knees
And I lay here drained of strength
Show me kindness
Show me beauty
Show me truth
The way you heard sounds makes all the difference
It's what decides if you'll endure the pain that we all feel
The way your heart beats makes all the difference
In learning to live
Here before me is my soul
I'm learning to live
I won't give up
Till I've no more to give
Listening to the city
Whispering its violence
I see out watching from above
The 90s bring new questions
New solutions to be found
I fell in love to be let down
Once again we dance in the crowd
At times step away
From a common fear that's all spread out
It won't listen to what you say
Once your touched you stand alone
To face the bitter fight
Once I reached for love
And now I reach for life
Another chance to lift my life
Free the sensation in my heart
To ride the wings of dreams into changing horisons
It brings inner peace within my mind,
As I'm lifted from where I've split my life
I hear an innocent voice
I hear kindness, beauty and truth
The way you heard sounds makes all the difference
It's what decides if you'll endure the pain that we all feel
The way your heart beats makes all the difference
In learning to live
Spread before you is your soul
So forever hold the dreams within our hearts
Through nature's in flexible grace
I'm learning to live
