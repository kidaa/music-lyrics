    She's not a girl who misses much
    Do do do do do do do do
    She's well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
    Like a lizard on a window pane.
    The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
    On his hobnail boots
    Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
       Working overtime
    A soap impression of his wife which he ate
    And donated to the National Trust.
    I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
    Down to the bits that I left uptown
    I need a fix cause I'm going down
    Mother Superior jump the gun
    Mother Superior jump the gun
    Mother Superior jump the gun
    Mother Superior jump the gun
    Mother Superior jump the gun
    Mother Superior jump the gun
    Happiness is a warm gun
    Happiness is a warm gun
    When I hold you in my arms
    And I feel my finger on your trigger
    I know nobody can do me no harm
    Because happiness is a warm gun.  Yes it is.
    Because happiness is a warm gun.  Yes it is.
    Because happiness is a warm gun.  Yes it is.
    Oh, don't you know that
    Happiness is a warm gun.
