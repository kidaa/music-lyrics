- John Petrucci
The God of Emperor deliverer of rakis
Stages his royal ascent
for the time has come for the tyrant
to unleash the golden path
The Lease of their lives has been spent
Revealing shadows of his past
Taking charge of his own life
distant to all mortal eyes
Never again the tyrant
the shock, the awe, the elation
[Chorus:]
There is no time, no distance ahead to continue
The fixity of visions determined
As God of emperor seizes thy Infinite grace
Transcending mystic worlds and time
Rage and confusion...War for supremacy
Valuable insight producing effect
As he marches down the royal road
his entourage embraces
never again
The shock!
The awe!
The elation!
As Arrakis undergoes a ghostly shift
The lessons now learned
Capturing reality
As the long awaited sacrifice unfolds
The march of the tyrant will end.
[Chorus]
