    Snow can wait, I forgot my mittens
    Wipe my nose, get my new boots on
    I get a little warm in my heart
    When I think about winter
    I put my hand in my father's glove
    I run off where the drifts get deeper
    Sleeping beauty trips me with a frown
    I hear a voice
   'You must learn to stand up for yourself
    cause I can't always be around.'
    When you gonna make up your mind
    When you gonna love you as much as I do
    When you gonna make up your mind
    Cause things are gonna change so fast
    All the white horses are still in bed
    I tell you that I'll always want you near
    You say that things change, change my dear
    Never change
