      - Cappeau de Roquemaure Traditional
    O holy night
    The stars are brightly shining
    It 'tis the night of our dear Savior's birth
    Long lay the world in sin and error pining
    'Til he appeared and the soul felt its worth.
    A prayer of hope the weary world rejoices
    For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
    Fall on your knees
    Oh hear the angel voices
    Oh night divine
    Oh night, when Christ was born
    Truly He taught us to love one another
    His law is love and His gospel is peace
    Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother
    And in His name all oppression shall cease
    Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
    Let all within us praise His holy name.
    Fall on your knees
    Oh hear the angel voices
    Oh night divine
    Oh night, when Christ was born
    Oh night divine
    Oh night, when Christ was born          [**A**]
    Oh night, when Christ was born
    When Christ was born

    Oh night, when Christ was born
    Oh night divine
    Oh night, when Christ was born
    Christ was born
