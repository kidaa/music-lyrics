Music by Dream Theater, Lyrics by Petrucci
5:10
"For this time in a long time... everything was right in my world... and then I woke up."
I can remember when,
In the unity of our five-day sessions
Not even once did we hear the siren song
What kind of imagination
Asleep in some lyrical coma
Who's vain futile memory
Could have been so wrong?
You can make a fortune in lies
You can keep a giant alive
You can ride the red
Until everybody smile
A trifling euphoria was such an untimely religion
Maybe your life can explain
The reason for my indecision
Here is a poor man
The heart of this monster creation
He said we both will be heroes
And I was led into temptation
You can make a fortune in lies
You can keep a giant alive
You can ride the red
Until everybody smiles
Can you show me your gold
And your silver?
A hero in frozen water
Now you've made a fortune in lies
And you kept a giant alive
You rode the red
You rode the red
