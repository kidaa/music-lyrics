Images & Words: Moore
2:31
Standing by the window
Eyes upon the moon
Hoping that the memory will leave her spirit alone
She shuts the doors and lights
And lays her body on the bed
Where images and words are running deep
She has too much pride to pull the sheets above her head
So quietly the lays and waits for sleep
She stares at the ceiling
And tries not to think
And pictures the chain
She's been trying to link again
But the feeling is gone
And water can't cover her memory
And ashes can't answer her pain
God giveme the power to take breath from a breeze
And call life from a cold metal frame
In with the ashes
Or up with the smoke from the fire
With wings up in heaven
Or here, lying in bed
Palm of her hand to my head
Now and forever curled in my heart
And the heart of the world
