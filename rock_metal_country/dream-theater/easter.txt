        Marillion - from the album ";Season's End";
    A ghost of a mist was on the field
    The grey and the Green together
    The noise of a distant farm machine
    Out of the first light came
    A tattered necklace of hedge and trees
    On the southern side of the hill
    Betrays where the border runs between
    Where Mary Dunoon's boy fell
    Easter here again
    A time for the Blind to see
    Easter
    Surely now can all of your hearts be free
    Out of the port of Liverpool
    Bound for the North of Ireland
    The wash of the spray and horsetail waves
    The roll of the sea below
    And Easter here again
    A time for the Blind to see
    Easter
    Surely now can all of your hearts be free
    What will you do?
    Make a stone of your Heart?
    Will you set things right
    When you tear them apart?
    Will you sleep at night
    With the Plough and the Stars alight?
    What will you do?
    With the wire and the gun?
    That'll set things right
    When it's said and done?
    Will you sleep at night?
    Is there so much love to hide?
