I. REFLECTION
  Cunning, Baffling, Powerful
  Been beaten to a pulp
  Vigorous, Irresistable
  Sick and tired and laid low
  Dominating, Invincible
  Black-out, loss of control
  Overwhelming, Unquenchable
  I'm powerless, have to let go
  I can't escape it
  It leaves me frail and worn
  Can no longer take it
  Senses tattered and torn
  Hopeless surrender
  Obsession's got me beat
  Losing the will to live
  Admitting complete defeat
  Fatal Descent
  Spinning around
  I've gone too far
  To turn back round
  Desperate attempt
  Stop the progression
  At any length
  Lift this obsession
  Crawling to my glass prison
  A place where no one knows
  My secret lonely world begins
  So much safer here
  A place where I can go
  To forget about my daily sins
  Life here in my glass prison
  A place I once called home
  Fall in nocturnal bliss again
  Chasing a long lost friend
  I no longer can control
  Just waiting for this hopelessness to end
II. RESTORATION
  Run - fast from the wreckage of the past
  A shattered glass prison wall behind me
  Fight - past walking through the ashes
  A distant oasis before me
  Cry - desperate crawling on my knees
  Begging God to please stop the insanity
  Help me - I'm trying to believe
  Stop wallowing in my own self pity
  ";We've been waiting for you my friend
  The writing's been on the wall
  All it takes is a little faith
  You know you're the same as us all";
  Help me - I can't break out this prison all alone
  Save me - I'm drowning and I'm hopeless on my own
  Heal me - I can't restore my sanity alone
  Enter the door
  Desperate
  Fighting no more
  Help me restore
  To my sanity
  At this temple of hope
  I need to learn
  Teach me how
  Sorrow to burn
  Help me return
  To humanity
  I'll be fearless and thorough
  To enter this temple of hope
  Believe
  Transcend the pain
  Living the life
  Humility
  Opened my eyes
  This new odyssey
  Of rigorous honesty
  Serenity
  I never knew
  Soundness of mind
  Helped me to find
  Courage to change
  All the things that I can
  ";We'll help you perform this miracle
  But you must set your past free
  You dug the hole, but you can't bury your sole
  Open your mind and you'll see";
  Help me - I can't break out this prison all alone
  Save me - I'm drowning and I'm hopeless on my own
  Heal me - I can't restore my sanity alone
III. REVELATION
  Way off in the distance I saw a door
  I tried to open
  I tried forcing with all of my will and still    [NOTE: the ";and"; is 
actually     ]
  The door wouldn't open                           [replaced with ";but"; in this 
line]
  Unable to trust in my faith
  I turned and walked away
  I looked around, felt a chill in the air
  Took my will and turned it over
  The glass prison which once held me is now gone  [";now"; is not heard in this 
line ]
  A long lost fortress
  Armed only with liberty
  And the key of my willingness
  Fell down on my knees and prayed
  ";Thy will be done";
  I turned around, saw a light shining through
  The door was wide open
