- Kevin Moore
Reaching
Too far away
Distance control
No contact today
Waiting
Empty again
Leaving me here
Is there no end?
Transcend!
Wait for me
Can't you see it's only time?
Here for you
Hearts combined can only climb
Distance
Emotions on trial
We close our eyes
transcending miles...
Wait for me
Can't you see it's only time?
Here for you
Hearts combined can only climb
Wait for me
Pour your heart inside of mine
Here for you
Love must stand this test of time.
