One brave cowboy
One brave man
who gave his own life and
she'll never see him again
high school sweetheart
frendship ring
and when they would pass by
ya know the birds would surely sing
country came calling
and took his life
when the news hit home
t'was the middle of the night
one brave cowboy
one brave man
gave his own life and
she'll never see him again
one brave cowboy
one brave man
gave his own life and
she'll never see him again
