Stop, cause your by yourself come on, your someone else
no time for another line, nonstop, around the clock

everybody knows somebody who's nobody
won't ya help him out
everybody knows somebody who's nobody
won't ya help him out
you want to talk
yeah then out the end come on
we didn't know where we'd talk and talk and talk
some of these sign have got to be attention
point yourself in the right direction
everybody knows somebody who's nobody
won't ya help him out
everybody knows somebody who's nobody
won't ya help him out
someone said get outta here come on

no time do what ya can come on, we gotta work it out
slow down thing and once again no way
I'm not driving with Lynne
