She falls apart by herself
No ones there to talk or understand
Feels sustained, dries here eyes
Finds herself, opens the door inside
People see right through you
Everyone who knew you well
Falls apart, might as well
Day is long and nothing is wasteful
Runaway runaway [Rodney background:] runaway runaway
Hold, hold you but your going away
Runaway runaway [Rodney background:] runaway runaway
[Rodney: Want] 
Hold Want you tomorrow but your leaving today
You walk along by yourself
There's no sound, nothing is changing
Been gone away, left you there
Emptiness is nothing you can't share
All those words that hurt you
More than you would let it show
Comes apart, by yourself
All is well and everything is wasted
Runaway runaway [Rodney background:] runaway runaway
[Rodney: Want] 
Hold Want hold you but your going away
Runaway runaway [Rodney background:] runaway runaway
[Rodney: Want] 
Hold Want you tomorrow but your leaving today
Sometimes we'll feel around and this dance instead can't be down
All the sound of me on my own
Any sound of me again it's time away surround around a friend
I know where I know where no where to runaway
She falls apart, no one there
Hold her hand, it seems to disappear
Falls apart, might as well
Day is long and nothing is wasted
Runaway runaway [Rodney background:] runaway runaway
[Rodney:] Want
Hold Want hold you but your going away
Runaway runaway [Rodney background:] runaway runaway
[Rodney:] Want 
Hold Want you tomorrow but your leaving today
Runaway Runaway
Hold Want hold you Want but your going away
But your leaving today, but your leaving today
