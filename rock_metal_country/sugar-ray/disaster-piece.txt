Ooh hoo! 
Ooh hoo! 
I just got hit by lightning again 
And she went right through me 
Pick me up 
Off my back replace my skin 
Woman 
Get your dirty mind outta my head 
Yeah 
I never knew how good 
I never knew how good it could be 

Chorus 
All over the world 
She's that kind of girl 
there's one in every scene 
Do you know what I mean 
She's got that kind of face 
You see in every place 
Another beautiful girl 
All over the world 

Ooh hoo! 
Ooh hoo! 
Once again 
Ask the devil how's he's been 
And my angel asked me 
Why do you always have to give in 
So I told them 
You never know what day it is 
until it's Saturday night 
Get your dirty mind outta my head 
Yeah 
I never knew how good 
I never knew how good it could be 

Chorus 
All over the world 
She's that kind of girl 
there's one in every scene 
Do you know what I mean 
She's got that kind of face 
You see in every place 
Another beautiful girl 
All over the world 

Yeah, yeah 
Ooh hoo! 
I finally got it right 
She knew what I was thinking 
I always knew how good it could be 
Stay tonight 
Ooh hoo! 
Stay tonight 
I always knew how good it could be 
Stay tonight 
Woman 
I always knew how good it could be 
All over the world 
She's that kind of girl 
There's one in every scene 
Do you know what I mean? 
She's got that kind of face 
You see in every place 
Another beautiful girl 
All over the world 

All over the world
