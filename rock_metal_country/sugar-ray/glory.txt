It's good to see you here again
I thought you almost died
Remember when we were listening
You barely had to try
Giant falling from the sky
Please tell me lie after lie
Now I know they're gonna take my glory
From the ones I left behind
And I know their gonna say their sorry
But I'll never change my mind
Everybody's gonna find me out
I'm going down this time
Everybody's gonna know about
The mess you left behind
Giant falling from the sky
Please tell me lie after lie
Now I know they're gonna take my glory
From the ones I left behind
And I know their gonna say their sorry
But I'll never change my mind
Hey hey hey heyahhhhhh [x2]
You say I'm lazy than you lie around
You tried to put me down
I know you're crazy when I see
You spin your head around
Giant falling from the sky
Please tell me lie after lie
Now I know they're gonna take my glory
From the ones I left behind
And I know their going say their sorry
But I'll never change my mind
Hey hey hey heyahhhhhh [x2]
Now I know they're going to take my glory
And I know their going to say their sorry
And I know their going to say their sorry
No I'm never going to tell my story
