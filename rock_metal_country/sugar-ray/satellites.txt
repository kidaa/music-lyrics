Easy I'm gonna fade away
I'm gonna find my way around
Knee deep I get no where from sleep
I'm running out of sheep to count
Not right I sit alone at night
And on the bed I write it out
No time for giving up that line
Or making up your mind
You've got a right to pine about

[Chorus]
I'm feeling you tonight
In the dream I think I'm falling
Bouncing off of the satellite
In the dream I think I'm flying
I feel you I feel you
Reach out and touch me will you
I'm feeling you tonight

No saving for a rainy day
When all of what they say you're out
No fame but all the rights the same
They're gonna know my name in town
No reason for another season
For some other teasing moans
No favor to the one that gave her
Made a morning haven
Inspired to save us all

[Chorus]
I'm feeling you tonight
In the dream I think I'm falling
Bouncing off of the satellite
In the dream I think I'm flying
I feel you I feel you
Reach out and touch me will you
I'm feeling you tonight

I can see you touch the sun
Make a wish and don't tell anyone
Then my eyes start focusing
Then my eyes start focusing
Then my eyes start focusing

[Chorus]
I'm feeling you tonight
In the dream I think I'm falling
Bouncing off of the satellite
In the dream I think I'm flying
I feel you I feel you
Reach out and touch me will you
I'm feeling you tonight
