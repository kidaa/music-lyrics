I put my hands right through the air and close my eyes and stare [x2]
You wanna talk about respect, its all behind you
cause too many people are waiting in the wings
born and bred this american pig
put your foot in your mouth but the hole's too big
you talk more shit, I'll make your eyes burn
if you dont quit, time for a hard learn
I put my hands right throught the air and close my eyes and stare
you want to talk about, you know about the little things you talk about
think you know me pretty well then I know it's time to sell
only move for money thats the
way it's gonna be
though it doesn't grow on trees I love to bask in the breeze
you talk more shit, I'll make your eyes burn
if you dont quit, time for a hard learn
I put my hands right through the air and close my eyes and stare
we'll sell you out so fast
we'll tear it down so fast
we get our culture from a mini mall, fuck inside a bathroom stall
rob peter pay paul I'm just like you I want it all
I talk more shit, I'll make your eyes burn
if you dont quit, time for a hard learn
we'll sell you out so fast we'll tear it down so fast [x2]
you talk more shit, well I'll make your eyes burn
if you
dont quit, time for a hard learn
I talk more shit [x4]
