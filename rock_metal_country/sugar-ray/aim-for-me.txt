[background] hit it!
It's a great big world
And you don't believe in nothin
Don't believe in nothin anyway
[background vocals] ahhhhhhh
So we got a lot to learn
But we started out with nothin
With my friends we're going on our way
[background vocals] ahhhhhhh
Some people changin'
Your life will rearange
Even when your so far from home
When it's said and done
And you got yourself a run
That's okay we'll never come undone
Aim For Me
Aim For Me
Aim For Me [background vocals] who who..
Aim For Me [background vocals] yeah!
They'll try to count you out
But you gotta count yourself in
There's no time to throw it all away
[background vocals] 
ahhhhhhh
Now I'm tellin' I'm rushing
See the trouble that we've been in
Didn't ask for nothing along the way
[background vocals] 
ahhhhhhh
When it's said and done
and you got yourself a run
That's okay we'll never come undone
Some people changin'
Your life will rearange
Even when your so far from home
Aim For Me
Aim For Me
Aim For Me
Aim For Me

[During Guitar Solo, various words] 
Yeah, come on mojo, eye eye, hit me, uhh,

Some people changin'
Your life will rearange
Even when your so far from home
When it's said and done
And you got yourself a run
That's okay we'll never come undone
Aim For Me [x5]
Some people change
Your life will rearange
Even when your so far from home
