Hay no lugar como en la casa [x2]
Can't take this anymore got my head down on the floor
my brain is burning inside of my head
can't speak a word and my face is blue
and I wanna get back to the arms of you
wanna get back I gotta get back to my
speed home california [x4]
got my 1894 with all my friends who pass at my back door
can see the light of another night in here
and you want it fast and you want it now
and if you ask they'll tell you how
wanna get back I gotta get back to my
speed home california [x8]
see you hear me not at all set you up to watch you fall
least I feel the starting of the end
gotta pick it up are you gonna be late
12 more hours to the sunshine state
wanna get back, I gotta get back to my Speed Home California [x8]
