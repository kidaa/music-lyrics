Call you on the telephone
supposing that your not alone
baby talking all around
saying that you can't be found
you say your never really satisfied it's not enough it's never enough [x2]
tell the truth, to find another lover [x2]
finding it hard, finding it harder [x2]
the room is kinda dark at night
used to have you by my side
seems the more I gave to you
kept us from being true
you say your never really satisfied its not enough its never enough [x2]
tell the truth, to find another lover
finding it hard, finding it harder
