Well it don't take much for me to do my thing
all I need is a mic and a ring magazine
big beats 'a pumpin while the guitar blasts
make the punk mother fuckers wanna kick my ass
I am not the problem, what ya gonna do
I am not the problem
coming up to you
I am not the problem
I aint gonna solve 'em
Im just gonna rob 'em
rhyme stealer
I see your rank moves and your rhymes aint tough
when you gonna learn that enough is enough
gettin loud and hard when I'm in your mix
I caught the bomb and I'm gonna get six
I am not the problem, what ya gonna do
I am not the problem, commin up to you
I am not the problem
I aint gonna solve 'em
Im just gonna rob 'em
rhyme stealer
I pull up to the party in my seventy-five 0
my car, my star, add it up- who's show
that's how I'm living, that's how I are
skip mother fucker and I'll take it too
far
I am not the problem, what ya gonna do
I am not the problem, commin up to you
I am not the problem
I aint gonna solve 'em
Im just gonna rob 'em
