Even though
She's on my mind
Even though
She's hard to find
Even though there's always something with you
Even though there's always somethin'
Even though
She's right on time
Even though
She's always lyin'
Even though there's always something with you
Even though there's always somethin'
[Chorus]
I know we don't talk about it
I know that that's true
I know we don't talk about it
I'm so scared that I'm losin' you
Even though
She just stopped trying
Even though
I can't stop cryin'
Even though there's always something with you
Even though there's always somethin'
Even though there's always somethin' with you
[Chorus]
Even though
Even though
Even though there's always something with you
Even though there's always somethin'
Even though there's always somethin' with you
