I heat up
I can't cool down
You got me spinnin round and round
Round and round and round it goes
Where it stops, nobody knows
Every time you call my name
I heat up like a burning flame
Burning flame for desire
Kiss me baby with the fire get higher
Abara abracadabra I wanna reach out and grab ya
Abra abracadabra... Abaracadabra
You make me hot you make me sigh
You make me laugh you make me cry
Keep me burning for your love
With the touch of a velvet glove
Abara abracadabra I wanna reach out and grab ya
Abra abracadabra... Abaracadabra
I feel the magic in your caress
I feel magic when I touch your dress
Silk and satin
Leather and lace
Black panties with an angel face
I see magic in your eyes
I hear magic in your sighs
Just when Ithink I'm gotta get away
I hear those words that you wont say
Abara abracadabra I wanna reach out and grab ya
Abra abracadabra... Abaracadabra
Every time you call my name
I heat up like a burnin flame
Burnin flame for desire
Kiss me baby with the fire
I heat up
I cant cool down
My situation goes run around
I heat up I cant cool down
My situation goes burning down
I heat up I can' cool down
My situation goes running down
