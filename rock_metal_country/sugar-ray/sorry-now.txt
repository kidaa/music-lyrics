I let you go, let you go, like a dozen balloons
Without even thinking
I didn't know, now I know, it was much too soon
It was much too soon
Why can't you call and say you miss me
The time we wasted just becomes history
Why can't you call and say you need me
The words I wanna hear deceive me

[Chorus]
Who's sorry now
Who's sorry now
Who's sorry
I know you're right
You're always right
So turn out the light
Who's sorry now

We'll never know, never know if all we had wasn't true
With me and you
Never really knew if right now was much too soon
It was much too soon
Why can't you call and say you miss me
The time we wasted just becomes history
Why can't you call and say you need me
The words you wanna hear deceive me

[Chorus]
Who's sorry now
Who's sorry now
Who's sorry
I know you're right
You're always right
So turn out the light

I wish she could tell me now
Where she has been
Where have you been
Now that she's let me out
I only want back in
Why can't you call and say you need me
The time we wasted just becomes history
Why can't you call and say you miss me
The words you wanna hear deceive me
Deceive me
Deceive me

[Chorus]
Who's sorry now
Who's sorry now
Who's sorry
I know you're right
You're always right
So turn out the light
Who's sorry now
Who's sorry now
Who's sorry
Who's sorry
Who's sorry
Who's sorry
Who's sorry now
