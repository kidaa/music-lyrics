your not alone, there's no one by
you got a reason for it
you took a try, you lost control
I got a feeling that it's coming 
I can see you, looking right through you, can you hear me
no time for you, staring right through me, can you see me
your on your own, there's no disguise
you feel it coming to it
there's no one by, you're feeling old
just want you feeling like the first time that I saw you
I can see you, looking right through me, can you hear me
no time for you, starring right though me, can you see me
you're all alone, as time goes by
must be a meaning to it
I never try, I'd rather sleep
but watch your head as I watch 
I can see you, looking right through me, can you hear me
no time for you, starring right through you, can you see me
