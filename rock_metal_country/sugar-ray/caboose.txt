Jump up, jump back
dare-devil woman try to tell me how to act
I feel mean, you look clean
your the best woman that I ever seen
no jock, let's rock
listen to the band rock, rock, rock
too loud, too bad
things were gonna do don't tell your dad
I wanna ride your caboose turn me loose [x2]
well I'm a king, you're a queen
can't be royal 'cause were so obscene
don't lie, let's fly
you know there aint nothin that could take it so high
the caboose, it's juiced
take it from the train now I'm gonna get loose
to the east, to the west
never slowing down till you shoot your best
I wanna ride your caboose turn me loose [x2]
I can't breathe, I'm out of air
when I'm back here all I see is your hair
I need time, to push a dime
rushing this thing would be a capital crime
don't quit, this is it
bumping & grinding yeah do the whole bit 
I'm done, I'm gone
when the rhymes over so is the song
I wanna ride your caboose turn me loose [x2]
