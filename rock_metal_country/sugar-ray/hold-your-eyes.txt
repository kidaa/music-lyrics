I got what you want, you know I got what you need
See me come along my baby
gonna give you some disease
I'm gonna see you in the morning
I'm going to feel you through the night
I'm 
close your breathe and hold your eyes
trying to suprise, you know what I mean [x4]
so I find you in the morning, lying on the floor
the break up dress inside your mess, going see you once a more
can I have all your digits, get a party on the floor
baby I got something for you baby gonna leave you all alone
Close your breathe and hold your eyes
trying to suprise, you know what I mean [x4]
Can you hear me, hear me, hear me
Close your breathe and hold your eyes
