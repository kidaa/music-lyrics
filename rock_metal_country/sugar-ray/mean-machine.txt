The only good thing that's creeping in city
Elvis had fifty but this one's mine
japanese cars, man, such a pity
am radio suits me fine
mean machine [x2]
my daddy said son your gonna drive me to drinkin'
mean machine [x2]
brakes are good, tires- fair
every now and then I drive just to get away
eatin' up two lanes I gotta find Sugar Ray
can't stop now gimme all your money
sometimes I drive slow, sometimes I drive quick
mean machine [x2]
my daddy said son your gonna drive me to drinkin' [x2]
don't you dare mess with my mean machine it's long and slick and olive green [x3]
a '68 coupe is all I need
so don't you dare mess with my mean machine
Jesus saves, Domi shoots and scores
I'm with stupid, caught my finger in the door
I'm wookin pa nub, like revenge of the nerds
but my ass it's a play on words
mean machine [x2]
my daddy said son your gonna drive me to drinkin' [x2]
don't you dare mess with my mean machine it's long and slick and olive green [x3]
a '68 coupe is all I need
so don't ya dare mess with my mean machine
don't fuck with it
