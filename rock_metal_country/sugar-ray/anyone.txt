Take, take what you want from me
it's my mistake if you let it be
and I dont think you even try
some miss and some get burned
you'll never know with out a turn
that's how you learn [x2]
dont let it bring you down
anyone, you can do it, if you want it, then you got it [x2]
I'm not one to inspire loud
your feeling dead you're feeling proud
and I don't think you even try
you fill the holes with dreams and dust
you feel it quick without the trust
beat down again [x2]
don't let it bring you down
anyone, you can do it, if you want it, then you got it [x2]
it's coming around [x2]
give, give what you want to me
it's no mistake if you let it be
but I dont think you even try
don't let it bring you down
anyone, you can do it, if you want it, then you got it [x4]
