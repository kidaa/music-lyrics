I'm not the one to stay up all night
but I am the one to turn off the light
I'm not the one to make it all come true
but I am the one who's good at two
say you just dont care but you still wanna try it then try it [x2]
10 seconds down
remote, remote control [x2]
now I told you so but you didn't believe
now you gotta goal that you didn't achieve
and I dont care I can't say the word
it's not my fault I didn't get past third
say you just dont care but you still wanna try it then try it [x2]
10 seconds down
remote, remote control [x4]
