You met her
persuade her
But still she's miles away
She crossed her fingers, won't look back at yesterday
Sometimes you feel like you can run back into her arms
You made her
persuade her
Don't let her slip away
Don't let her slip away

[Chorus]
Ooh, just a little more baby can't you see
You're running away
Just a little more baby stay with me
You're running away [3 x]

Surrender, protect her, I gave myself away
She rolls her eyes at all the stupid things I say
Sometimes I feel I can't run back into her arms
I made her
Forgave her
But some things never change
Don't let her slip away

[Chorus]
Ooh, just a little more baby can't you see
You're running away
Just a little more baby stay with me
You're running away [3 x]

And you know you got me running, got me thinking 'bout the other side
And you know you got me hoping, got me praying, need you by my side
Oh baby

[Chorus]
Ooh, just a little more baby can't you see
You're running away
Just a little more baby stay with me
You're running away [3 x]
