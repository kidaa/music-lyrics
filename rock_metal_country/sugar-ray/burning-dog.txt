Look around
Help me out
I'm breakin' up
I'm breakin' down
Take him out and leave him on a mission
Take him out and leave him on a shelf
Take him out and leave him on a mission
Take him out and leave him by yourself
All around
In my site
Back to back
Side to side [x2]
You're going down
Have the time [x2]
Close my eyes
There's no sound
Take him out and leave him on a mission
Take him out and leave him on a shelf
Take him out and leave him on a mission
Take him out and leave him by yourself
All around
In my site
Back to back
Side to side [x2]
Lift me up
Help me out
Lost control
Going Down
Take him out and leave him on a mission
Take him out and leave him on a shelf
Take him out and leave him on a mission
Take him out and leave him by yourself
All around
In my site
Back to back
Side to side [x4]
