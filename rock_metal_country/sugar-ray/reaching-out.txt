I want to be 
Something better than before 
You showed me what we should be fighting for 
Can you tell me 
Why I always see your face 
You are kind of like a supernatural kind of place 
Reaching out, reaching out 
You are the one 
Consciousness you're killing me 
I understand the clarity 
Now I can see 
How you touched so many lives 
You're on the way 
To another space in time 
I can feel you 
Every time I see your face 
You are kind of like a supernatural kind of place 
Your light shines for us to see 
A part of you lives on in me 
We are the same 
Follow through reality 
It's coming down...forget about 
Typical just what it seems 
Another day inside the dream 
So here it comes consuming me.
