Sometimes I just want to be left alone
Move your big head
It's my way go and get your own
[Elijah Blue sings:]
I don't care about the things you do
I don't care about the things you do
I don't care about the things you do
I don't care about, I don't care about
All my friends can't relate
No time off to hesitate
To my head touch my face
Two steps back you're in my space
One more impossible to position
Got the high score
Forgot to put the letterage
[Elijah Blue sings:]
I don't know about the things you do
I don't know about the things you do
I don't know about the things you know about
The things I know about the things you do
All my friends can't relate
No time off to hesitate
Feel my head touch my face
Two steps back you're in my space
[Elijah Blue sings:]
The valetting that we make
Or the illegal pictures on the net
Remember how we told you well
And that your playground is a gate to hell
I don't know about the things you do
I don't know about the things you do
I don't know about the things you do
I don't know care about
All my friends can't relate
No time off to hesitate
Feel my head touch my face
Two steps back you're in my space
You stink 
[Elijah Blue sings:] I don't know about the things you do
Touching me 
[Elijah Blue sings:] I don't know about the things you do
Can you say
[Elijah Blue sings:]
I don't care about the things you do 
[Mark sings in background:]
Sometimes
I don't care about the things you do
[Mark sings in background:] I just want to be left alone
I don't care about the things you do
[Mark sings in background:] Move your big head
I don't care about the things you do
[Mark sings in background:] It's my way go and get your own
I don't care about, I don't care about
All my friends can't relate
No time off to hesitate
Feel my head touch my face
Two steps back you're in my space
