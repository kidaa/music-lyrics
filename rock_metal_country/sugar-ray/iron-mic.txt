He was the heavyweight king at the age of 21
from the streets of NY where they're all called mean
he never had no mom, never had no dad
his aunt and Cus Da'mato was all he ever had
but he found his pot of gold, consequently came Givins
when they broke up it was him that was given
and we like to build 'em up and we like to see 'em fall
finally taken down by a hooker five feet tall
I said you gotta set him free [x4]
when push comes to shove [x4]
It was a battle of brains, a battle of wit
so my man got his mad skills, Allan Durschwitz
but he left him out to dry, the judge was a fool
using this case as publicity tool
so it's off to cell to meet the prison staff
the first thing they do is want his autograph
and I just laugh cause he suffered the wrath
now the man added time to his liberty path
I said you gotta set him free [x4]
when push comes to shove [x4]
I heard he gets a lot of visits still he's got no family
but he gets alot of love from the kids in Jodeci
what Desiree sucks man on his new TV
same name bitch but you look simular to me
but thats another story, I'm gettin off track
but when he gets out I think you better watch your back
I said now when he gets out I think you better watch your back
you might find yourself kid tagged and sacked
I say they gotta set him free [x4]
when push comes to shove [x4]
we gotta set that motherfucker free
