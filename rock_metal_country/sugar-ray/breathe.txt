You pull my head back watch me bleed
I need it again
no time to move can't even breathe
your face is stuck in a magazine
such a bitch
for once do something for yourself
so breathe
breathe [x3]
you found me out some how you found me out [x3]
you scratch and kick and pull and fight
and do it again
I do it wrong and you do it right
and now your gone your so uptight
It gets so hard
all we ever do is fuck and fight
so breathe
breathe [x3]
you found me out some how you found me out [x7] 
some how
It's all the same no matter what you say
I think I need it
you got the same no matter what you say
the grass is greener in L.A.
just a suspect
everybody's dead in their own way
so breathe
breathe [x3]
you found me out some how you found me out [x7]
some how
