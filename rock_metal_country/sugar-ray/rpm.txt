I am
you will recover when you discover baby
there is no other when you recover baby
and when the mood is right you'll get it every night
go on and play it like your on the other side
your beautiful, it's all or me
your beautiful, it's me
I will let you, I will let you down
into another don't run for cover baby
there is no other into another baby
and when the time is right
I got you in my sight
I'll reach into your life and look around inside
your beautiful, it's all or me
your beautiful it's me
I will let you, I will let you down [x2]
your beautiful, it's all or me
your beautiful, its me
I will let you, I will let you down [x2]
