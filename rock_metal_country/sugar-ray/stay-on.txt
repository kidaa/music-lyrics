My mind is spinning
Don't you know
That I'm outta control
I don't need you to tell me so
Again you're winning
Don't you know
That it's taking its toll
I don't need you

I don't need you
Is it me that you're looking for
Mmmm, that you're looking for, that you're looking for
Is it me walking out the door
Walking out, walking out
I be like

[Chorus]
Mmmm, I be like
Stay up, stay on
She only wants to see me break down
Stay up, stay on
Yeah
Stay up, stay on
She throws out the little cut-downs
Don't it seem absurd
Yay ahhh
In the beginning, don't you know
I thought I was in control
I don't need you to tell me so
The dirty linen
Don't you know
Is beginning to show
I don't need you
I don't need you
Is it me that you're looking for
Ahhhh, that you're looking for, that you're looking for
Is it mewalking out the door
Walking out the door
I'll be like

[Chorus]
Mmmm, I be like
Stay up, stay on
She only wants to see me break down
Stay up, stay on
Yeah
Stay up, stay on
She throws out the little cut-downs
Don't it seem absurd
Yay ahhh
You fight all night but you don't get it right
So you drink ten beers 'cause you don't wanna hear about
Fight all day but the feelings only stay
But there's nothing you can do 'cause she doesn't like you
Just when you get warm she pulls off the covers
And she leaves and goes straight for her mothers
That's when you wanna look her right in the eye and you hear her say goodbye
Goodbye [10x]

I be like
Stay on, stay on
She only wants to see me break down
I'm the last to have heard
Yeah
Stay up, stay on
She throws out the little cut-downs
Don't it seem absurd
Yay ahhh
Stay up, stay on
Stay up, stay on

Stay up, stay on
Stay on, on, on
Huh!
Don't every time we meet at this function junction
Not gonna believe the assumed presumption
Wanna talk it out, but it's not gonna be necessary
She's not so fragile, she plays the mercenary
Mercenary nary, nary

Stay up, stay on
She throws out the little cut-downs
Stay up, stay on
Stay up, stay on
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Stay up, stay on
Stay up, stay on
