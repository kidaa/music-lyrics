your throwin' sticks and stones, your breakin' my bones man
I can see you got to leave it alone
your trying hard, pushing hard, trying hard, pushing harder
but I'm smartest, I want you to know this
you gotta get down if you want to hang around [x3]
and if you want to hang around you gotta get down
what ever happend to girls that were freakin
everybody was streakin it was no big thing man
if I had the choice I'd bring it all back
everybody's talkin' bout me gonna blow my stack
you gotta get down if you want to hang around [x3]
and if you want to hang around you gotta get down
dance around the pool in a jock like Hammer
g-string up my ass so my cheeks are getting tanner
now I'm in the chaise lounge in a Burt Reynolds pose
socks on my feet you know I got ugly toes
motherfucker I'm Mark with a K not a C
when I'm face down get a ride from McG
you gotta get down if you want to hang around [x3]
and if you want to hang around...you gotta get down
