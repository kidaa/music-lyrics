Words and Music by Teddy Gentry and Richard Scott
Why, lady, why, can't I leave you alone?
I try, lady, try, but the feeling's too strong.
You stay on my mind.  Feel just like a fool.
Why, lady, why, can't I get over you?
Why, lady, why? It was easy before.  
I try, lady, try, but it ain't easy no more.
To be on my way would be the best thing to do.
Why, lady, why, can't I get over you?
Why, lady, why, can't I leave you alone?  
I try, lady, try, but the feeling's too strong.
To be on my way would be the best thing to do.
Why, lady, why, can't I get over you?
