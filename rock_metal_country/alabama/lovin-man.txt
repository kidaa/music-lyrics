Words and Music by Jeff Cook
I don't mind the cold and rain where I'm waiting.
I'm holding on to your mem'ry as tight as I can.
Silver wings are bringing you back so I can hold you, and let me know that
I'm still your lovin' man.
You carry my dreams through the darkness while I'm sleeping; the part of love
that I need to fit my plan.
I don't need nobody else to eas my feelings, as long as I can be your lovin'
man.
I been waiting here for days to see that big steel bird arrive.
And just the thought of lovin' you is what's kept this man alive.
Share with me all the joy life can bring us, though my kingdows may be
castles made of sand.
Darlin' please spend your sunshine days beside me, and let me always be your
lovin' man, your lovin' man.
Let me be your lovin' man.
Let me be your lovin' man.
