Words and Music by Randy Owen
Chorus:
Oh, play me some mountain music, like grandma and grandpa used to play.
Then I'll float on down the river to a Cajun hideaway
Drift away like Tom Sawyer, ride a raft with ol' Huck Finn.
Take a nap like Rip Van Winkle, daze dreamin' again.
Chorus
Swim across the river, just to prove that I'm a man.
Spend the day bein' lazy, just bein' nature's friend.
Climb a long tall hick'ry.  Bend it over, ";skinnin' cats.";
Playin' baseball with chert rocks, usin' sawmill slabs for bats.
Bridge:
Play some back-home, come-on music that comes from the heart.
Play something with lots of feelin', 'cause that's where music has to start
Oh, play me some mountain music, like grandma and grandpa used to play.
Then I'll float on down the river to a Cajun hideaway, hey hey.
