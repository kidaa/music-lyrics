Words and Music by Richard Berardi and Michael Berardi
Is that what time it is?
I'm sorry if I woke you with this call.
But all this wine is in my head, and I'm so lonely from it all.
Don't hang up.
Baby, hear what I gotta say.
We started out such a beautiful story.
We just can't end this way.
Chorus:
I wanna come over, I wanna love you tonight.
I don't care about the time or who's wrong or who's right.
Just say it's OK, and I'll be on my way.
I wanna come over. Could you get outta bed?
I'll try to unsay all the things I've said.
Please say its OK, and I'll be on my way.
Is that what time it is?
I'm sorry if I'm keeping you from your sleep.
But all thse feelings are running through me.
You know I never knew they ran so deep.
What's that you're sayin'?
That just before I phoned,
you were gettin' ready to give me call,
'cause you were feelin' so alone.
Chorus
I wanna come over. 
I wanna come over.
