Words and Music by Mac McAnally and Robert Byrne
He was a good time, beer bar picker until the night she came along.
He gave up his women and his liquor, and she put the sad in all his songs.
Something about hermade him sorry.
She was holy in his eyes.  She had him bound and hypnotized.
She put the sad in all his songs.  She put the blues in his guitar.
She took what he had and she made it wrong.
She put the sad in all his songs.
She was the rattle snake that bit him.
SHe was the blow fromup behind.
She thought the tear in his eye just might fit him, and he was the last thing
on her mind.
She put the sad in all his songs.  She put the blues in his guitar.
She took what he had and she made it wrong.
She put the sad in all his songs.
She put the sad in all his songs.
