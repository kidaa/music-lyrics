Written by Richard Leigh and Robert Byrne
He raced that engine down the track 'round the tree on Christmas day
I was so amazed my dad would play with trains
I saw a sparkle in his eye, then I heard him say, come on son let's play, I
was young once, too
He washed that Buick faithfully, Lord he kept her clean
I thought that machine meant more to him than me
On the day I turned sixteen he threw me the keys
Said I was young once, too, now she belongs to you
He was such a young man then, I'm older than that now
I hope I measure up to him, when the circle comes around
I saw him in the attic sittin' cross legged on the floor
With some old photographs, he point and laughed
He said, that's me in that picture, I said, no son, that's your dad
I was young once, too, and looked a lot like you
I was young once, too, I was young once, too
Merry Christmas son, I wish your grandpa were here
He was young once, too, and looked like me and you
