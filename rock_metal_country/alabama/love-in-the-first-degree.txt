Words and Music by Jim Hurt and Tim DuBois
I once thopught of love as a prison a place I didn't want to be.
So long ago I made a decision to be footloose and fancy free.
But you cam I was so tempted to gamble on love just one time.
I never thought I would get caught.
It seemed liek the perfect crime.
Chorus:
Baby, you left me defneseless.
I've only got one plea.
Lock me away inside of your love and throw away the key.
I'm guilty of love in the first degree.
I thought it would be so simple, like a thousand times before.
I'd take what I wanted and just walk away, but I never made it to the door.
Now babe, I'm not beggin' for mercy.
Go ahead and throw the book at me.
If lovin' you's a crime, I know that I'm as guilty as a man can be.
Chorus
Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.
Chorus
Oh yeah.  Love in the first degree.
Love in the first degree.  
Love in the first degree.
