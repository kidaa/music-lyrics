Words and Music by Randy Owen
I was born across the river in the mountains where I call home.
Lord, times were good there.  Don't know why I ever roamed.
Chorus:
Oh, Tennessee River and a mountain man, we get together anytime we can.
Oh, Tennessee River and a mountain man, we play together in Mother Nature's
band.
Me and my woman's done made our plans on the Tennessee River, walkin' hand in
hand.
Gonna raise a family, Lord settle down where peace and love can still be
found.
Chorus
Oh, Tennessee River.
Chorus
Oh, Tennessee River.
