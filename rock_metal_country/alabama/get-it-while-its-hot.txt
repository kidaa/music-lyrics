Words and Music by Randy Owen, Jeff Cook, and Richard Scott
I got something cookin' and I'm boilin' way down deep.
While I'm hot and bothered why don't you give me what I need.
Your kind of lovin' really hits the spot.
The things you're doin', baby, make me want what you got.
So get it, get it, get it while it's hot, get it while it's hot.
Well, standin' here beside you, I can really feel the heat.
I feel your body tremblin; from your head down to your feet. 
I know my mind is in it, but my body's almost shot.
If you want my lovin', babe, better get it while it's hot.
So get it, get it, get it while it's hot, get it while it's hot.
Get it, get it, get it while it's hot.
Get it, get it, get it while it's hot.
Get it, get it, get it while it's hot.
