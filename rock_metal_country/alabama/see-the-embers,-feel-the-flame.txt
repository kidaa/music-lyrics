Words and Music by Jeff Cook
Julianna, be mine tonight. 
The time has come girl, and the feeling's right.
Love forever, not fade away.
A reborn love of yesterday.
Chorus:
I can't believe it, this love I've found.
The fever's risin'; I can't cool it down. 
And just like the South, girl, we're goinna rise again, sharin' the love that
just won't end.
Oh yeah. Alright. Be mine, woman. Love me tonight. I got a burning love,
girl, and you feel the same. 
See the embers, feel the flame.
Chorus

See the embers, feel the flame.
See the embers, feel the flame.
