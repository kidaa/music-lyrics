Words and Music by Keith Darran McGuire and George Pearce
I remember campin' all night down by the river's edge, skinny dippin' in the
bright moonlight, divin' off a ledge, skippin' rocks across the water,
fishin' on an old trout line, gigging frogs till the early mornin', smokin'
dried crossvine.
Chorus:
Take me back down where the Red River rolls; send me back to Lou' sianne.
Take me back down where the white water flows, to the Cajun promised land.
Give me my line and my old pirogue.  Get me back as fast as you can.
Take me back home where the Red River rolls.
Take me back home where the Red River rolls.
Floatin' down the river on a patched up inner tube, eatin' dinner on the
ground, made of fresh caught catfish stew.
Lay wake at night when I hear a wildcat scream; tellin' takes around the camp
fire light about the girls in our dreams.
Chorus
