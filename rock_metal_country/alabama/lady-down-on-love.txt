Words and Music by Randy Owen
It's her first night on the town since she was just eighteen, a lady down on
love and out of hope and dreams.
The ties that once bound her now are broke away, and she's like a baby, just
learning how to play.
She never thought that love could ever end so soon.
Her mind drifts back in time to a mid-summer moon when he asked her to marry
and she glady said O.K.
And a woman came to be from the girl of yesterday.
Now she's a lady down on love.  
She needs somebody to gentley pick her up.
She's got her freedom, but she'd rather be bound to a man who would love her
and never let her down.
Well, I know a lady that's down on her love, 'cause I used to hold her and
have that special touch.
But work took me a way from home late at nights, and I wasn't there when she
turned out the lights.
Then both of us got lonely and I gave into lust, and she just couldn't live
with a man she couldn't trust.
Now she's a lady down on love.
She needs somebody to gently pcik her up.
She's got her freedom, but she'd rather be bound to man who would love her
and never let her down.  
Now she's a lady down on love.
