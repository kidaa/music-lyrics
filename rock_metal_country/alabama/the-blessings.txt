I satnd here lookin' up at the starts tonight, how can one man have somuch in
life
As I look around me, what a picture it paints, I'm muchmore than lucky, I
oughta give my thanks
There's food on the table, a log on the fire, and in my woman's eyes there's
love and desire
The blessings, sent from above, oh, the blessings, a life full of love
When I look around I can see, all that's been given me, so Ilift my eyes up
to the sky
I wanna give my, my, my, my, my thanks for the blessings
Sometimes I fall asleep at the end of the day and I forget to thank you, I'm
ashamed to say
But as I lay m down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep
I know you can hear me here on Earth, thank you for giving me more than I
deserve
The blessings, sent from above, oh, the blessings, a life full of love
When I look around I can see, all that's been given me, so Ilift my eyes up
to the sky
'Cause I wanna give my, my, my, my, my thanks for the blessings
Blessings, when I look around, I can see, all that's been given me
So, I lift my eyes up to the sky, 'cause I wanna give my, my, my, my, my
thanks for the blessings
The blessings, oh, the blessings
