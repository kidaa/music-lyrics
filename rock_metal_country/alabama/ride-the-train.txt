Words and Music by Teddy Gentry
Orange Blossom Special, the Wabash Cannonball, the Chattanooga ChooChoo, this hobo's seen 'em all.
I've watched the Sante Fe lay her smoke against the sky and listen to old
number three rollin' through the night.
Chorus:
Ride the train. Ride the train.
Anywhere I'm going I ride trains.
Sleepin' in a boxcar when it rains.
Ride the train, ride the train.
Southern Pacific, the Overland Express and up ahead the coal cars of West
Virginia's best.
And Oklahoma's Frisco, the biggest one of all. 
I've listened to the Silver Steed's lonesome midnight call.
Chorus
Ride the train.  Trains.
