There's a light, in your eyes tonight.
You know I know that look anywhere.
You got plans, and I'm one lucky man.
Before we get so carried away,
Theres just something I've been wanting to say.
When we make love
Its more to me than just an affair
I want you to know how much I care
When we make love
Oh its such a precious time
We share our hearts, our souls and our minds...
When we make love
Watching you, make your little moves
Well I can tell its gonna be a long night
All day long, we keep holding on
It couldn't be any better than this
I got it all in my fingertips
When we make love
Oh, its more to me than just an affair
I want you to know how much I care.
When we make love
Oh, its such a precious time
We share our hearts our souls and our minds...
These moments..these feelings..mmmmmm
When we make love
Its more to me than just an affair
I want you to know how much I care
When we make love
Oh, its such a precious time.
We share our hearts our souls and our minds...
Now lets make love, sweet love
