Words and Music by Donny R. Lowery
I got her in my heart and I got her in my head.
I got her in love and I got her in bed.
I got her thank for all I own.
If it wasn't for her love, I'd be all alone.
Chorus:
She's my woman back home that treats me right, early in the mornin' to late
at night.
It doesn't really matter.  Any time's all right.
Wish my woman back home was here tonight to hold me tight.
Thinkin' 'bout her now in my hotel room.
I'm wonderin' when and I'm hopin' it's soon.
I see her smile and her eyes are green.
She's the prettiest girl my eyes have ever seen.
Chorus
