Words and Music by J.P. Pennington and Mark Gray
Fly away with me tonight.
Take me on a one-way flight in your lovin' arms, and ev'rything's gonna be alright.
You're the one who took my hand when no one else could understand.
You're the one who moves me like nobody else can.
Chorus:
Take me down where I wanna be.
Turn around, the man who lives inside of me.
Take me down and love me all night long.
Hold me close and make me strong.
Take me down. Take me down tonight.
In your eyes I see the light.
It's your emotions glowin' bright.
So keep the fires burnin', and let it warm me through the night.
You can be a part of me, 'cause you're what love was meant to be.
You and me, baby, we'll set the flame inside free.
Chorus
You don't have to stay forever
Let's just put our hearts together, share another night in ecstasy.
We know that it's feelin' better ev'ry time we get together.
Maybe love was meant for you and me.  Whoa, take me down
where I wanna be.
Turn around, the man who lives inside of me.
Take me down and love me all night long.
Hold me close and make me strong.
Take me down.  Take me down tonight.
Take me down tonight.  Take me down tonight. Take me down tonight.
