She said, ";I spent eight years in California.  
That's the reason why I talk the way I do.
But I've hear how Southern men respect the ladies, and I'd like to meet a
gentleman like you.";
Well, I spent most of my life in Alabama.
That's the reason why I talk the way I do.
And I've always had this thing for sun-tanned ladies, and I'd really like to
spend some time with you.
And we walked on the beach till early morning. 
And we watched as the sun came up again.
And somehow we both shared the feelin' that we'd just made a very special
friend.
Tomorrow I'll go back to Alabama, and you'll fly from Atlanta to L.A.And I'll
get back to takin' care of bus'ness, and you'll go back to starrin' on the
stage.
But we'll think of the beach come Monday morning, when both of us get back to
push and shove.
And somehow we will always remember the night we shared a very special love.
I spent most of my life in Alabama.
That's the reason why I talk the way I do.
I know we shared a very special friendship the night we made a very special
love.
