Written by Ronald A. White and William Robinson, Jr.
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
And when its cold outside girl I've got the month of May
Oh I guess you'd say what can make me feel this way
My girl, talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl
I've got so much honey the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song baby than the birds in the trees
Well I guess you'd say what can make me feel this way
My girl, talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I don't need no money, fortune, or fame
I've got all the riches baby oneman can claim
Well I guess you'd say what can make me feel this way
My girl, my girl, my girl, talkin' bout my girl
My girl, talkin' 'bout my girl
On a cloudy day with my girl
I've even got the month of May with my girl
Talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
