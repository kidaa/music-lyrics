Chorus:
Is the magic still there whenever I hold you
Do these lips of mine send chills down your spine like they used to
Or is it slipping away, baby come out and say, I'm asking because I care
I just need to know is the magic still there
Oh I still recall our first time together
Oh we kissed and we touched, we couldn't get enough of each other
And when we said goonight beneath that old porch light it left us wanting more
But I'm wondering now if time has somehow changed what we felt before
Chorus
Am I still the one that you daydream of
When we turn out the light is there fire in the night when we make love
Don't want to take you for granted so baby I'm askin' only because I care
I just want to know
Is the magic still there whenever I hold you
Do these lips of mine send chills down your spine like they used to
Or is it slipping away, baby come out and say, I'm asking because I care
I just need to know is the magic still there
Is the magic still there, is the magic still there
