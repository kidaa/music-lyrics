Dave Gibson/Ronnie Rogers, 3:39
Chorus:
In the corner of my mind stands a jukebox
It's playing all my favorite memories
One by one they take me back
To the days when you were mine
And I can't stop this jukebox in my mind
I don't need no quarters
Don't need any dimes
You filled it up forever
When you said goodbye
Heaven knows I love old melodies
They were meant to ease the pain
But the kind that's playing on my mind
Are driving me insane
Repeat chorus
Song by song those melodies
Were meant to ease the pain
But the kind that's playing on my mind
Are driving me insane
Repeat chorus
Tag
No I can't stop this jukebox in my mind
Repeat chorus
