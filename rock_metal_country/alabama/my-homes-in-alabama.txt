Words and Music by Randy Owen and Teddy Gentry
Drinkin' was forbidden in my Christian country home
I learned to play the flattop on them good ol' Gospel songs
Then I heard about the barrooms just across the Georgia line
Where a boy could make a livin' playin' guitar late at night
Had to learn about the ladies; too young to understand
why the young girls fall in love with the boys in the band
When the boys turn to music, the girls just turn away
to some other guitar picker in some other late night place
Yeah, I held on to my music; I let the ladies walk away
took my songs and dreams to Nashville and then on to L.A.
Up to New York City, all across the USA
I lost so much of me but there's enough of me to say that my
Chorus:
..home's in Alabama, no matter where I lay my head
My home's in Alabama, Southern born and Southern bred
What keeps me goin'? I don't really know.
can't be the money the Lord knows I'm always broke
could it be the satisfaction of bein' understood
when the people really love ya and let you know when it's good
Well I'll speak my Southern English just as natural as I please
I'm in the heart of Dixie, Dixie's in the heart of me
and someday when I make it, when love finds a way
somewhere high on Lookout Mountain I'll just smile with pride and say that my
Chorus
