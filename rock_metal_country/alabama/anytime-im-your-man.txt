Anytime you wanna love me you can love me anytime
Early morning, late at night, anytime the time is right
Oh, if you want to hold me, well, you know that you can
Anytime, anytime, I'm your man
Baby you're something, you're something else
I'll keep you're loving all to myself
I live for the moment when its just you and me
Baby, just you and me
Anytime you wanna love me you can love me anytime
'Cause I'm ready and I'm willing, name the placem name the time
December through November, just give me your hand
Anytime, anytime, I'm your man
So hold me close, close as you can
Whisper to me, now what's your plan
You can trust me, understand baby, understand
Anytime you wanna love me you can love me anytime
Oh, if you want to hold me, well, you know you always can
Anytime, anytime, I'm your man
