I'll admit I could feel it
The first time that we touched
And the look in your eyes
Said you felt as much
But I'm not a man
Who falls too easily
It's best that you know
Where you stand with me
Chorus:
I will give you my heart
Faithful and true
And all the love it can hold
That's all I can do
'Cause I've thought about
How long I'll love you
And it's only fair that you know
Forever's as far as I'll go
When there's age around my eyes
And gray in your hair
And it only takes a touch
To recall the love we've shared
I won't take for granted
You'll know my love is true
'Cause each night in your arms
I'll whisper to you
Repeat chorus

Forever's as far as I'll go
