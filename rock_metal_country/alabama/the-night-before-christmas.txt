Ribbons and paper cover the floor, it's been a great Christmas with presents
galore
Everyone's happy and I'm happy, too
Oh, what a night, oh, what a night, night before Christmas I had with you
Frost on the window, snow on the ground, holiday spirit, holiday sounds
Everyone's thankful and I'm thankful, too
Oh, what a night, oh, what a night, night before Christmas I had with you
It all started underneath that mistletoe when we were waiting up just to help
ole Santa Claus
We were making merry in ways we'd never thought of when we heard those sleigh
bells and ole Santa almost caught us
We didn't take no pictures, but I still remember one very special
twenty-fourth day of December
Oh, what a night, oh, what a night, night before Christmas I had with you
It all started underneath that mistletoe while we were waiting up to help ole
Santa Clause
We were making merry in ways we'd never thought of when we heard those sleigh
bells and ole Santa almost caught us
If we don't do this nect year, honey, I'm sure gonna miss it
Why don't we make it a new Yuletide tradition
Oh, what a night, oh, what a night, night before Christmas I had with you
Oh, what a night, oh, what a night, night before Christmas I had with you
