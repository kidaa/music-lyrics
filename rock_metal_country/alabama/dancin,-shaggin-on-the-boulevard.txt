Well the Magic Attic's where the music rolls 
And the Army-Navy's got ol' Jackie Soul
Down on Peaches Corner there are Good Ol' Boys
And Mother Fletchers makin' lots of noise
They're dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard
Dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard
Well the Tams are playin' at the Port-O-Call
And the Drifters underneath the Boardwalk
At the Sapnish Galleon and Ol' Fat Jacks
Jukebox playin' and the place is packed
You bet they're dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard
You know they're dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard
Got the top down and the traffic's slow
Sun Fun Week and, we all go
Where the girls are sunnin' and lookin' good
Well I never met 'em but I wish I could
And we'd go dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard
We'd go dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard
Well the Embers singin' up on Ocean Drive
And the Castaways are gettin' loud tonight
At the Electric Circus they all getin' down
And the Carousel's spinnin' round and 'round
See them dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard
I see 'em dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard
Well I'm hangin out down at Sloppy Joes
They may doze but they never close
And the Bama Boys at the Bowery
They can't dance but they play for free
But they like dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard
They know dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard
They wrote dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard
Dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard
Dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard
Shaggin' on the boulevard
Dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard
Dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard
