Words and Music by Randy Owen
Whisper to me softly three words upon my skin.
No one's near and listenin', so please don't say goodbye.
Just hold me close and love me.
Press your lips to mine.
Mm, feels so right, feels so right.
Lying here beside you, I hear the echoes of your sighs.
Promise me you'll stay with me and keep warm tonight.
So hold me close and love me.
Give my heart a smile.
Mm, feels so right, feels so right.
Your body feels so gentle and my passion rises high.
You're lovin me so easy.
Your wish is my command.
Just hold me close and love me.
Tell me it won't end.
Mm, feels so right, feels so right, feels so right.
Aw, you feel so right baby.
