Words and Music by Jeff Cook
You go out on the town, feelin' alright.
Leavin' me here alone, you're stayin' all night.
You're good to me; do something sweet.
Tonight, you're back out on the street.
Lovin' you the way I do is killin' me.
I don't blame you for havin' fun, as long as I'm your only one.
So go on out, have a time, have a good time.
Don't forget if he asks, you're still mine.
You're tellin' me the same old lies, and I don't need your alibis.
Lovin' you, the way I do, is killin' me.
Lovin' you, the way I do, is killin' me
