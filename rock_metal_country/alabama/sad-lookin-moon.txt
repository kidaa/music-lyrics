I thought that you could fly, I thought that you had wings
I guess that I believed you'd never say goodbye
But my world stopped turnin' 'round, the stars turned upside down
It knocked me to the ground on my knees
Chorus:
Now there's a sad lookin' moon shinin' down on me
There's a sad lookin' sky as far as I can see
I always believed and I thought the stars could see
But there's a sad lookin' moon shinin' down on me
I shared with you my dreams, I gave you everything
I opened up my heart and I gave you my ring
Well I spent days and nights just thinkin' about the time
When you would be mine all my life
Chorus
There's a sad lookin' moon 
A sad lookin' moon
There's a sad lookin' moon 
Shinin' down on me
