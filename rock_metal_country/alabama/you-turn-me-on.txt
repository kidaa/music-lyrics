Chorus:
You know how t'turn me on in a special way all your own.
No one has been where you've gone in so long.
Oh, baby, you turn me on.
Your world fits right into mine with perfection time after time.
And my world's where you must belong, 'cause baby, you turn me on.
Oh, baby, you turn me on.
It's always so perfect with you every time.
Oh yeah, I love you.
Chorus 
Oh, baby, you turn me on.
Baby, you know every way to turn me on and on and on.
So why don't you just turn me on?
'Cause you know how to turn me on.
