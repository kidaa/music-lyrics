Well, I'mgladlittle Johnny wants that remote control
I know I'm gonna run it fast as it will go
And Jenny wants every game that Nintendo makes
It's just around the corner and I can't wait
I've got my stocking hangin', it's time to go to bed
I think I hear some reindeer, I better cover up my head
I know Santa's gonna bring us something just like he always dod
Yeah, when it comes to Christmas I'm still a kid
I still like shakin' presents underneath the tree
And tryin' to figure out what ole Santa's got for me
Oh, I get so excited on Christmas Eve
I try my best to close my eyes, but I can't sleep
Well, I've got my stocking hangin', its time to go to bed
I think I hear some reindeer, I better cover up my head
I know Santa's gonna bring us something just like he always did
Yeah, when it comes to Christmas I'm still a kid
When it comes to Christmas, I'm still a kid
Just a kid
