If you're gonna play the jukebox
Would you kindly keep it country
'Cause I'm feelin' so lonely tonight
Oh please play a sad song about a heart that's just been stepped on
Would you kindly keep it country for me tonight

I'd get up off this bar stool if you'd play something we could dance to
Oh, a song about a love that's gone astray
Oh I love to hear 'em sing about the misery and pain
Would you kindly keep it country for me tonight

Oh please play a sad song about a heart that's just been stepped on
Would you kindly keep it country for me tonight
Would you kindly keep it country for me tonight
