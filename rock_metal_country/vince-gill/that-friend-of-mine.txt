That friend of mine wears an old work shirt
For a long long time she has blessed this earth
And a smile that shines even when she hurts
O how I love that friend of mine 
That friend of mine gave her heart to me
How sweet and kind the truth can be
And Gods tie that binds us as family 
Oh how I love that friend of mine

Shes an angel shes the answer 
The sweetest piece of heaven in my eyes
Shes drawn to me like gravity
Id lay down and die for that friend of mineShes an angel shes the answer 
The sweetest piece of heaven in my eyes
Shes drawn to me like gravity
Id lay down and die for that friend of mine
Id lay down and die for that friend of mine
That friend of mine wears an old work shirt
