CHORUS:
When I look into your heart
I see us holding each other
I can finally see forever
When I look into your heart

Ive seen the moon dance on the waters
Watched the morning sun slip through the trees
But the sight of you is the vision
That takes me to my knees

REPEAT CHORUSIve never known such comfort
Ive never felt such release
Ive never felt so connected
Ive never know such peace

REPEAT CHORUS

I can finally see forever
When I look into your heart
