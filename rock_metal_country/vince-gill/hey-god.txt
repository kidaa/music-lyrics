Hey God I just lost a dear old friend
Hey God I hope hes in your angel band
Hey God you know he believed in you
Just help me understand why you do the things you do

Hey God send me down some comfort please
Hey God Ill be down here on my knees
Hey God will we ever comprehend
The forgiveness and grace that lies waiting in the end

Oh theres anger and tears
For all of the years that your children wont have you to hold
Oh my heart had been broken
The angels have spoken still I wish I could watch you grow old

Hey God I know he didnt die alone
Hey God tell my old friend welcome home
Hey God please hear me when I pray
Pray for a little peace til we meet again someday
Pray for a little peace til we meet again someday
