Well I've been spendin' all my spare time
Sittin' home alone
Listenin' for the front door
And starin' at the phone

Ever since that night in Texas
You're all that's in my brain
And long distance ain't the answer
My little heart can't stand the strain

Chorus:
I'm a waitin' for your love
Waitin' every night and day
Hopin' you'll come by and get me, baby
Take me far away
I'm a waitin' for your love
Girl, I ain't afraid to say
That you're all I ever wanted
So come and steal my heart away

Well I was never one to beg
You know I always played it cool... so cool
But you've got me on my knees now
You're the exception to the ruleWell there ain't no turnin' back
You know I'm too far gone
So I keep the front door open
And keep the porch light on

Chorus X 2

You're all I ever wanted
So come and steal my heart away
