The sweetest smile
The shyest kiss
Two wounded hearts
Were not expecting this

CHORUS:
Look what loves revealing
Something to believe in
Time to start the healing
For you and me
Look what loves revealing


Promises for keeping
Its natural as breathing
Look what loves revealing
Willing to trust
Well make it through
You reach for me
And find me reaching tooREPEAT CHORUS

Its natural as breathing
Look what loves revealing
