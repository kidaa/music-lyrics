Ive got a secret I keep in my heart
A secret that sure makes me smile
And Ive got a feeling deep down in my soul
That I havent felt in a while
Ive found somebody that really does love me
And I know that shell always stay
Im the luckiest guy in the world
Cause my heart feels this way

We watch old movies and cry at the endings
And get lost in each others eyes
We hold hands when were walking and
Spend all night talking and make love as the sun starts to rise
Shes found somebody that really does love her
And she knows that Ill always stay
Im the luckiest guy in the world
Cause her heart feels this way

We share the same hopes
We dream the same dreams
Oh lifelong companions Id say
Im the luckiest guy in the world
Cause our hearts feel this way
Im the luckiest guy in the world
Cause our hearts feel this way
