Oh baby when you came walkin' in
I went crazy wonderin' where you been
I think maybe I just fell in love again

Chorus:
She ain't no Peggy Sue, sweet Mary Lou
She ain't no Maybeline, pretty miss Norma Jean
But I'd give up everything
For just one dance with you

Oh baby I sure like the way you move
I go crazy when you shake that thing the way you do
You think maybe I could have a dance with you
