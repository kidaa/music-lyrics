Me and you and the Sunday paper
Spread all over the bed
A rose colored morning light
All to ourselves
Hot coffee and the comic strips
Pillow talk and your fingertips
Laying down and loving
Til theres nothing left 
CHORUS: 

Ill take the little things
The simple pleasures that your sweet love brings
Ill take the little things with you

Open the windows, leave that old fan on
Lay here with me til the sun is gone

Dont say nothin just let the time
Pass right on by
I want to hear you breathe
I want to brush your hair
I dont care if we go anywhere
Weve got everything we needRight here in this room

REPEAT CHORUS

Me and you and the Sunday paper
Spread all over the bed
