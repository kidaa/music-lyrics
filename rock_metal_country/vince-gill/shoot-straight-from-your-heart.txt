Theres no need to hide anything
Baby just know what you bring
Will always be enough
All of those things that you do
Are the reasons that I fell for you
And why, I believe in us

CHORUS:

Baby shoot straight from your heart
Youll never miss your mark
Baby always shoot straight from your heart
Let truth be the path that you choose
There aint no way we can lose
Baby always shoot straight from your heartWere gonna make some mistakes
Cause baby I sure aint no saint
I swear Im in for the long haul
It dosent matter how far
I love you just how you are
I will answer when you call

REPEAT CHORUS
