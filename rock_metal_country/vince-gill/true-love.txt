Is today my lucky day
Are you gonna look my way
And see true love

If you're not sure he holds your heart
Don't let pride keep us apart
You need true love

Chorus:
True love is all I'm after
I long to hear your laughter
The only thing that matters
Is it's true love
It's true love

I hear your voice in every sound
You're never there when I turn around
I need true love

I can't quit and I won't give in
Until you're back in my arms again
We need true love

ChorusWhen I look at you You look right through me
I wish you knew
What your love's done to me

Is today my lucky day
Are you gonna look my way
And see true love

Yeah...

Chorus

It's true love repeat to fade
