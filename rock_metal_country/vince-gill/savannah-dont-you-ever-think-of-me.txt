Do you ever think of me
When you lay your head down
Do you ever think of me
When he ain't around

Do you ever wonder why
Our love couldn't be
Ever since you said goodbye
Do you ever think of me

Chorus:
Savannah
The memory just won't fade
Savannah
I sure wish you'd stayed with me
Savannah

Do you ever see my face
In your new lover's eyes
Has my memory been erased
Am I out of your lifeI still remember our first night
We made love so tenderly
So when he doesn't hold you right
Do you ever think of me

Chorus

If he ever lets you down
Happiness just can't be found
I'll still be here hangin' 'round
Savannah

Savannah
Do you ever think of me
... repeat to fade
