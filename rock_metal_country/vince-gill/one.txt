Every little whisper every little sound
Brings me comfort whenever youre around
A heart full of wonder and sweet reverie
Gives me a reason a reason to believe

CHORUS:
Forevers just begun
Well never turn and run
Slowly weve become
One, one

Slowly weve become one
I love the way were different
And the way were the same
Making love to each other
Is like shelter from the rainIsnt it amazing
What I see in your eyes
Ill be your partner
And never leave your side

REPEAT CHORUS
