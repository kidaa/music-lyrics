I'm a long long way from home
Mendin' a broken heart
Runnin' away from a love gone wrong
Tryin' to make a new start
An old friend called me up to say
That you've made some wedding plans
I'm comin' home on that midhight train
And fight for you like a man

Chorus:
Midnight train make your whistle brlow
Engineer pour your load of coal
Midnight train make your engine whine
Midnight train get me home on timeOh the thought of another man holdin' you
Is drivin' me insane
My only chance is to ride all night
I can't let you change your name
Now hey conductor we can't be late
Rollin' on down the track
'Cause you know tomorrow's your wedding day
I gotta win my baby back

Chorus X 2
