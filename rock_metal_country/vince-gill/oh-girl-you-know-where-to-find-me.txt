Oh girl you know where to find me
Oh girl you know where I'll be
I'll be waitin' at the end of your line
'Cause baby I've got nothin' but time
Oh girl you know where to find me

It was love at first glance
I asked you may I have this dance
You said you would I froze right where I stood
I come here every night
Oh there's nobody special in my life
So if you think you'd like to
Find someone to hold you some night

Oh girl you know where to find me
Oh girl you know where I'll be
I'll be waitin' at the end of your line
'Cause baby I've got nothin' but time
Oh girl you know where to find meOh girl you know where to find me
Oh girl you know where I'll be
I'll be waitin' at the end of your line
'Cause baby I've got nothin' but time
Oh girl you know where to find me

Oh girl you know where to find me
