If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go, but I know
I'll think of you each step of the way

And I will always love you
I will always love you

Bitter sweet memories
That is all I am taking with me
Goodbye, please don't you cry
'Cause we both know I'm not what you needBut I will always love you
I will always love you

I hope life I hope life
Treats you kind treats you kind
And I hope you have all you dream of
I wish you joy wish you joy
And happiness and happiness
But above all this I wish you love

And I will always love you
I will always love you
Yes, I will always love you
I will always love you
