If we have to wait forever that's all right
If you say let's run away we'll leave tonight
I'll do anything you ever ask me to
Girl the reason my heart's beating is for you
And you alone

There's a price you pay for every choice you make
We'll have our day no matter what it takes
I'll be there for you whatever we go through
Girl the reason life's worth living is for you
And you alone

Chorus:
Oh you and you alone are with me from now on
Even if I never see your face again
The love that you have shown is unlike anything I've known
We both know its just a matter of when

I wish that we could just turn back the hands of time
To find a way to have your world fit into mine
I'll keep dreaming that some day it all comes true
Girl the reason my heart's breaking is for you
And you alone
