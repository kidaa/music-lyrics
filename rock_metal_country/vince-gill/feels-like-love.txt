Look what my heart has gotten into
The sweetest gift I ever knew
Its even better than my favorite shoes
Look what my heart has found in you 
CHORUS:
Feels like sunshine, feels like rain
Lord it feels like love finally called my name
I wanna jump and shout I wanna sing and dance
Lord it feels like love wants a second chance

Look what my heart can clearly see
How much I crave your company
A true companion I will always be
Look what my heart has done to me 

REPEAT CHORUSLooks like my heart has become
The safest place for us to run
Ill be here for you when the day is done
Looks like my heart has found someone 

REPEAT CHORUS
