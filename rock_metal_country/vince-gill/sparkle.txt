Sparkle, there's gotta be a sparkle
For you to love somebody
For you to really know
Brighter than the lights in the city
It's more than being pretty
The way you are inside

Why are you cryin'
Somebody's tryin'
To be with you only all the time
You hide behind tears
Counting the fears
You're so used to being alone

Sparkle, there's gotta be a sparkle
For you to love somebody
For you to really know
Sparkle, you got a certain sparkle
I know I love somebody
I gotta let it show

Instrumental BreakNobody knows you
They can't get too close to
A girl who won't let down her disguise
You won't believe how much someone could love you
That someone is looking in your eyes

Sparkle, it's gotta be a sparkle
For you to love somebody
For you to really know
Brighter than the lights of the city
It's more than being pretty
It's the way you feel inside
Sparkle
