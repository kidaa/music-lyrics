Baby dont go baby please dont go
Dont you leave me here feelin lonely
Dont you leave me here feelin low
All I know is what I know
And I know I love you so
Baby dont go baby please dont go 

I wasnt ready for love to hit me
Hit me right between the eyes
One by one Im comin undone
Cant you feel my temperature rise

Well Ive got you where you want me
Right in the palm of your hand
Im gonna make you feel like a woman
Cause you make me feel like a manREPEAT CHORUS

Lock your eyes right with me
Make time slow down to a crawl
Two hearts on fire with a wild desire
Climbin these bedroom walls
My heartbeats gettin stronger
Baby wont you rock me slow
I cant take it any longer
You got me shakin all the way to my toes

REPEAT CHORUS
