I am all alone this time around
Sometimes on the side I hear a sound
Places parallel I know it's you
Feel the little pieces bleeding through

[Chorus:]
And on And on
This goes on And on
And on And on
And on And on
And on And on
And on And on
And on And on
And on And on
And on And on
This goes on And on
And on And on
And on And on
And on And on
And on And on
And on And on
And on And on
And on

Now that I've decided not to stay
I can feel me start to fade away
Everything is back where it belongs
I will be beside you before long

[Chorus]

[x2]
Oooh we will never die
Oooh Beside you in time
