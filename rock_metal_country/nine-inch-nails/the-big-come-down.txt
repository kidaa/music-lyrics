there is a game I play
try to make myself okay
try so hard to make the pieces all fit
smash it apart
just for the fuck of it

bye bye oooh
got to get back to the bottom
bye bye oooh
the big come down isn't that what you wanted
bye bye oooh
find a place with the failed and forgotten
bye bye oooh
isn't that really what you wanted now

there is no place I can go there is no way I can hide
it feels like it keeps coming from the inside

there is a hate that burns within
the most desperate place I have ever been
try to get back to where I'm from
the closer I get the worse it becomes
the closer I get the worse it becomes

there is no place I can go there is no place I can hide
it feels like it keeps coming from the inside
