wherever I go
I take a little piece of you
I collect
I reject
photographs I took of you

well times I passed through
so many faces
so many places
I have got to have a memory
I have never been there
I have never had you

I can't remember
give me your reminder
I collect
I reject

memorabilia
now girl... only it's flavor... bow down here

keychains and snowstorms
the taste of your sweat
the look in your eye
I have been inside you
I know what it feels like
wet as it is... the whiter the honey
I collect
I reject

memorabilia
goodies come in here all day

give me your reminder
I can't remember
I collect
I reject
