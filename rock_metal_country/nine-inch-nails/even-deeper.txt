I woke up today
to find myself in the other place
with a trail of footprints
from where I ran away
it seems everything I've heard
just might be true
and you know me
well you think you do
sometimes, I have everything - yet I wish I felt something

do you know how far this has gone
just how damaged have I become
when I think I can overcome
it runs even deeper

and in a dream I'm a different me
with a perfect you
we fit perfectly
and for once in my life I feel complete
and I still want to ruin it
afraid to look
as clear as day
this plan has long been underway

I hear them call
I cannot stay
the voice inviting me away

do you know how far this has gone
just how damaged have I become
when I think I can overcome
it runs even deeper
everything that matters is gone
all the hands of hope have withdrawn
could you try to help me hang on
it runs...

I straight
I won't crack
on my way
and I can't turn back
I'm okay
I'm on track
on my way
and I can't turn back
I stayed
on this track
gone too far
and I can't come back
I stayed
on this track
lost my way
can't come back
