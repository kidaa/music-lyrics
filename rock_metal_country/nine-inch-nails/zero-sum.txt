They're starting to open up the sky, they're starting to reach down through. 
It feels like we're living in that split second of a car crash. 
And time is slowing down, and if we'd only had a little more time than this, I'll just hold
your hand.
Do you remember the time we...? 
And all the times we...? 
And should have...? 
And were going to...? 
I know.

And I know you remember. How would he justify it all? 
And we knew better; in our hearts... we knew better. 
And we told ourselves it didn't matter. 
We're trying to continue, and none of that matters anymore. 
In the hour of our twilight... 
And soon it will be all said and done, and we'll all be back together, as one... 
And we will... continue... at all.

Shame on us, doomed from the start
May God have mercy on our dirty little hearts
Shame on us for all we have done
And all we are worth is just zeroes and ones 

And you never get away, and you never get to take the easy way,
And all this is a consequence, born by our own hand...
If you believe in that sort of thing.
And did you ever really find, when you closed your eyes, 
Any place that was still, and at peace? 

And I guess I just wanted to tell you, as the lights start to fade,
That you are the reason that I am not afraid.
And I guess I just wanted to mention, as the heavens will fall,
We will be together soon if we will be anything at all.

Shame on us, doomed from the start
May God have mercy on our dirty little hearts
Shame on us for all we have done
And all we are worth is just zeroes and ones
