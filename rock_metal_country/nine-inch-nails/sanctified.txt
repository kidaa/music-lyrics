it's still getting worse after everything i tried.
what if i found a way to wash it all aside.
what if she touches with those fingertips.
as the words spill out like fire from her lips.

[Chorus:] 
if she says come inside i'll come inside for her.
if she says give it all i'll give everything to her.
i am justified.
i am purified.
i am sanctified.
inside you

Heaven's just a rumor she'll dispel.
as she walks me through the nicest parts of hell.
i still dream of lips i never should have never kissed.
well she knows exactly what i can't resist

[Chorus]

i think we should get in the front right now,
get in the front right now!
doesn't that feel good
now you're ready to go, get it.
now i want you to get in there and get the job done.
life is great!
life is terrific!
thank you God for another wonderful day!

i'm still caught up in another of her spells.
well she's turning me into someone else.
everyday i hope and pray this will end.
but when i can i do it all again

and if she says come inside i'll come inside for her.
if she says give it all i'll give everything to her.
i am justified.
i am purified.
i am sanctified.
inside you
i am purified.
i am terrified.
i am sanctified.
inside you

even when it's bowling shapes and see your life begin to change.
