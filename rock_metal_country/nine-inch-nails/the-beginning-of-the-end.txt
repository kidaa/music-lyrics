Down on your knees
You'll be left behind
This is the beginning
Watch what you think
They can read your mind
This is the beginning
I got my mark, see it in my eyes
This is the beginning
Well my reflection I don't recognize
This is the beginning

We think we've climbed so high
Up all the backs we've condemned
We face no consequence
This is the beginning of the end

You wait your turn
You'll be last in line
This is the beginning
Get out the way
Cause I'm getting mine
This is the beginning
There are some ones that can help themselves
This is the beginning
May be too late as far as I can tell
This is the beginning

We think we've come so far
On all our lies we depend
We see no consequence
This is the beginning of the end.
