i can't shake this feeling from my head.
there's a devil sleeping in my bed.
watching you from across the way.
i cannot make this feeling go away

[Chorus:] 
i know it's not the right thing.
and I know it's not the good think.
but kinda i want to.

i'm not sure of what i should do.
when every thought i'm thinking of is you.
all of my excuses turn to lies.
maybe God will cover up his eyes

[Chorus]

why does it have to be this way
why does it have to be
why does have to be this way

kinda i want to.
maybe just for tonight.
we can pretend it's alright.
what's the price i pay.
i don't care what they say.
i want to.
i want to i'll take my chance tonight
