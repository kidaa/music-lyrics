well you've got me working so heard lately.
working my hands until they bleed.
if i was twice the man i could be.
i'd still be half of what you need
still you lead me and i follow
anything you ask you know i'll do.
but this one act of consecration is what i ask of you

[Chorus:]
ringfinger.
promise carved in stone.
deeper than the sea.
ringfinger.
sever flesh and bone
and offer it to me.

you just left me nailed here.
hanging like Jesus on the cross.
i'll be dying for your sins.
and aiding to the cause.

[Chorus]

wrap my eyes in bandages.
confessions i see through.
i get everything i want.
when i get part of you.

[Chorus]

ringfinger.
promise carved in stone.
deeper than the sea.
ringfinger.
devil's flesh and bone
do something for me.
