Hey man, please don't make a sound
Take a look around, can't you see what's right in front of you
Have a little taste, no more time to waste
You don't wanna get left behind cause it's all coming down right now

How hard is it to see
Put your faith in me
'Cause you wouldn't want to be nailed
To the wrong piece of wood
You should get where you belong
Everything you know is wrong
Come on, sing along, everybody now

God given

And it gives us sight
And we see the light
And it burned so bright
Now we know we're right
And His Kingdom Come
And Thy will be done
We've just begun
We're the chosen ones

Wait, step into the light
How can this be right?
I'm afraid we're going to ask you to leave
This you cannot win
With the color of your skin
You won't be getting into the Promised Land
It's just another case
You people still don't know your place
Step aside, out the way, wipe that look of your face
Defiance
Raining from the sky

Come on, sing along, everybody now
God given

And it gives us sight
And we see the light
And it burned so bright
Now we know we're right
And His Kingdom Come
And Thy will be done
We've just begun
We're the chosen ones
