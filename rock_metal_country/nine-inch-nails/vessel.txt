I let you put it in my mouth
I let it get under my skin
I let you put it in my veins
I let you take me from within

They tell us what we can and cannot do
Same thing we've heard 100 times before
Well, I put you inside of me
But none of that matters anymore

Oh my God, can it go any faster?
Oh my God, I don't think I can last here

I am you and you are me
We will never be alone
I have finally found my place in everything
I have finally found my home

We can leave all the past behind
I can see right through the whole faade
I'm becoming something else
I am turning into God

Oh my God, can it go any faster?
Oh my God, I don't think I can last here
