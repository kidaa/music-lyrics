i can't believe that what i feel is really happening to me.
make it hurt.
and point the finger at my insecurities.
well i guess i just don't understand about those complexities in your mind.
and i guess i just don't understand why this world seems so unkind.

[Chorus:] 
maybe. maybe just once. i get what's coming.
maybe. maybe just once. i get what's coming to me.

so once again the way you feel will never ever stay the same.
and i'm to blame.
i wonder just who made the rules up for this game.
well i guess i just don't understand about what you want and what you need.
and i guess i just don't understand about how it has to be.

[Chorus]

you sat down on this bed and you said
"Christ, what the hell do you think this place is"
you know.
he just couldn't believe it!
and i said
"i don't know but it sure is something different"

so go ahead.
you say those thousand things you think you have to say.
look at me.
and tell me love's not such a hard word anyway.
well how can you count on me i thought you realized for sure.
and how can you just believe.
i thought i deserved just a little more.

[Chorus]

oh God.
oh what's coming to me.
