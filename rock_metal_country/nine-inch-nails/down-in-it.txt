wimp. wimp.

kinda like a cloud i was up way up in the sky.
and i was feeling some feelings you wouldn't believe.
sometimes i don't believe them myself and i decided i was never coming down.

just then a tiny little dot caught my eye.
it was just about too small to see.
but i watched it way too long.
that dot was pulling me down.

[Chorus:] 
i was up above it.
i was up above it.
i was up above it.
i was up above it.
now i'm down in it

shut up.
so what what does it matter now.
i was swimming in the hate now i crawl on the ground.
and everything i never liked about you is kind of seeping into me.
i try to laugh about it now but isn't it funny how everything works out.
i guess the jokes on me.

[Chorus]

i used to be so big and strong.
i used to know my right from wrong.
i used to never be afraid.
i used to be somebody.

i used to have something inside.
now just this hole it's open wide.
used to want it all.
i used to be somebody.

i'll cross my heart and hope to die.
but the needle's already in my eye.
and all the world's weight is on my back and i don't even know why.
and what i used to think was me is just a fading memory.
i looked him right in the eye and said "goodbye."

[Chorus]

rain rain go away.
come again some other day.

[Chorus]

na na na na na na na na.
