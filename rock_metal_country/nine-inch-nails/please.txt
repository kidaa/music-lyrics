this is how
it begins
push it away but it all comes back again
all the flesh
all the sin
there was a time when it used to mean just about everything

just like now

breathe, echoing the sound
time starts slowing down
sink until I drown
please I don't ever want to make it stop

and it keeps repeating
will you please complete me

never be enough
to fill me up

watch the white
turn to red
it fills up the hole but it grows somewhere else instead
all my life
yeah yeah yeah yeah, but it just left me dead
well guess what
the world is over and I realize it was all in my head

now everything is clear
I erase the fear
I can disappear
please I don't ever want to make it stop

you can never leave me
will you pleaseb complete me

never be enough
to fill me up
