Everytime I get hot
You wanna cool down
Everytime I get high
You say you wanna come down
You say its enough
In fact its too much.
Everytime I get a - Get down, get down,

I can feel - when you break me
Come on so heavy - when you take me -
You make love, you make love, you make love, you make love
You can make everybody get down make love,

In fact its too much
Everytime I wanna, get down, get down get down -
