you had all of them on your side, didn't you
you believe in all your lies, didn't you
the ruiner's got a lot to prove he's got nothing to lose and now he made you
believe
the ruiner's your only friend well he's the living end to the cattle he
deceives
the raping of the innocent you know the ruiner ruins everything he sees
now the only pure thing left in my fucking world is wearing your disease
how did you get so big
how did you get so strong
how did you get so hard
how did you get so long
you had to give them all a sign, didn't you
you had to covet what was mine, didn't you
the ruiner's a collector he's an infector serving his shit to his flies
maybe there will come a day when those that you keep blind will suddenly
realize
maybe it's a part of me you took to a place I hoped it would never go
and maybe that fucked me up so much more than you'll ever know
how did you get so big
how did you get so strong
how did you get so hard
how did you get so long
what you gave to me
my perfect ring of scars
you know I can see what you really are
you didn't hurt me nothing can hurt me
you didn't hurt me nothing can stop me now
