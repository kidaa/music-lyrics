kinda like a cloud i was up way up in the sky and i was feeling some feelings
you wouldn't believe sometimes i don't believe them myself and i decided i was
never coming down. just then a tiny little dot caught my eye it was just about
too small to see. but i watched it way too long and that dot was pulling me
down.

[Chorus:] 
i was up about it.
i was up above it.
now i'm down in it
i was up above it.
i was up above it.
now i'm down in it

well shut up so what what does it matter now. i was swimming in the haze now i
crawl on the ground. and everything i never liked about you is kind of seeping
into me. try to laugh about it now but isn't it funny how everything works
out "I guess the jokes on me." she said

[Chorus]

i used to be so big and strong.
i used to know my right from wrong.
i used to never be afraid.
i used to be somebody

i used to have something inside
now just this hole that's open wide.
i used to want it all
i used to be somebody

i'll cross my heart and hope to die but the needle's already in my eye. and
all the world's weight is on my back and i don't even know why. and what i
used to think was me is just a fading memory
i looked him right in the eye and said "goodbye."

[Chorus]
