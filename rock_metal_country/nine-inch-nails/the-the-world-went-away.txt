I'd listen to the world he'd say
but his voice I heard decay
the plastic face forced to portray
and the insides left cold and gray
there is a place that still remains
it eats the fear it eats the pain
the sweatest price he'll have to pay
the day the whole world went away
na na nah
na na na, nah
na na nah
na na na, nah
