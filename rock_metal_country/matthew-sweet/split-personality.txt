I can't remember what I thought of you
Just a minute before
I've got to take another look at who
I do believe it's true
I've got a split personality
When I let it fly
I've got a split personality
And I'm bottled up most times
But I don't think I'd forget you
My memory is fine
And I don't believe I've met you
It's time
I get a piece of your mind
You must prepare yourself for what you'll see
'Cause it won't be long
I'm going to ask you not to look at me
When it all goes wrong
I've got a split personality
When I let it fly
I've got a split personality
I can't remember what I thought of you
Just a minute before
I've got to take another look at who
I do believe it's true
I've got a split personality
When I let it fly
I've got a split personality
And I'm bottled up most times
But I don't think I'd forget you
My memory is fine
And I don't believe I've met you
It's time
I'm bottled up most times
But I don't think I'd forget you
My memory is fine
And I don't believe I've met you
It's time
I get a piece of your mind
I get a piece of your mind
