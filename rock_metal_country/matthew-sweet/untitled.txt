Don't let me go on
Sad and unfinished
Don't make mine a chord
That is diminished
Don't make me go on long
Untitled
Don't let me get lost
Fighting with nature
Do let me grow cold
Deep in a glacier
Don't let me hang on long
Untitled
I can feel that the swirl of the wind
Was made for me
The curve of the earth
Cuts through my dreams
The sun is up for the asking
If you follow it down
Don't let me go on...
Don't let me go wrong
Steer me the right way
Yes I will grow strong
Darling if you say
Don't let me go on long
Untitled
I can feel that the swirl of the wind
Was made for me
The curve of the earth
Cuts through my dreams
The sun is up for the asking
If you follow it down
Don't let me go on...
Don't let me go on on and on
Don't let me go on on and on
Don't let me go on on and on
Don't let me go on on and on and on
