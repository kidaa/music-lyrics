I don't have to speak, and you know what I'm thinking
You don't need to hear what I say,
I don't have to ask, 'cause you'll guess what I'm seeking
You don't need to hide what you know
Baby we're the same, when we fail in each other's eyes
Baby we're the same, so you should not be suprised
When I swear to you, I never told you what to do
Maybe it's me. Maybe it's you
I don't have to act, so you'll know what I'm feeling
You don't need to see to believe
Baby we're the same, when we shine in each other's sky
Baby we're the same, so you should not be suprised
When I swear to you, I never told you what to do
Sometimes it's me. Sometimes it's you
Baby we're the same, when we fail in each other's eyes
Baby we're the same, so you should not be suprised
When I swear to you, I never told you what to do
Maybe it's me
Maybe it's you
Maybe it's you
