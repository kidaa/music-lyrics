Daylight comes you lift your pretty head from your knees
In the past you always knew you could talk to me
I would look to help but certain things I can't see
You raise your eyes and nod your head
I'd rather talk this out instead
While time is ticking away time ticks away
We lose another day
We lose another day
I'm the first to know when something is going wrong
If we wait for night to fall it will take too long
I will fight if you believe we can both be strong
You raise your eyes and nod your head
I'd rather talk this out instead
While time is ticking away time ticks away
We lose another day
You raise your eyes and nod your head
I'd rather talk this out instead
While time is ticking away time ticks away
We lose another day
We lose another day
We lose another day
We lose another day...
We lose another day...
