Capture
The spirit of adversity
Be sure to put the lid on tight and watch it carefully
Sew shut
The mouth of the river slut
The entrance to a place discussed but hardly there for you
Hollow
An evil bigger than you could know
Has taken root
Rapture
So what do you care
You know if it was up to me I'd take you anywhere
Hollow
An evil bigger than you could know
An evil bigger than you could know
An evil bigger than you could know
Has taken root
Hollow
An evil bigger than you could know
An evil bigger than you could know
An evil bigger than you could know
Has taken root
