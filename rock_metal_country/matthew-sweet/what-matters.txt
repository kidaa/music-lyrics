In my mind I can't imagine
How the world has come to me
And in my heart I can't detach
The feeling that it couldn't be
And no, I don't want to kiss you
Don't want to miss you if you go away
I'll fake it don't want to make it 
Don't want to feel another way
Once you had a love and you let it go
Now you know what matters
Once you had a dream that you realized
But do you know what matters
'Cause you're alone in the sense that I am
But you know we're not alone
And we aren't perfect nothing is
But try to understand
The moment leaves you without a vision
Can't see decisions being made
I can describe the picture I'm painting
It's not amazing when you know
Once you had a love and you let it go
Now you know what matters
Once you had a dream that you realized
But do you know what matters
To leave your feelings in the past
Part of it is you know you can't go back for free
And no, I don't want to kiss you
Don't want to miss you if you go away
I'll fake it don't want to make it 
Don't want to feel another way
Once you had a love and you let it go
Now you know what matters
Once you had a dream that you realized
But do you know what matters
To leave your feelings in the past
Part of it is you know you can't go back for free
What matters...
