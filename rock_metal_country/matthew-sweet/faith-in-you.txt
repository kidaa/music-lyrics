I'm looking all around me
And there's so much room to move
But I don't believe in miracles
Should I put my faith in you
I lay down in the evening
And I look up at the stars
But I don't believe in miracles
Should I put my faith in ours
I wake up in the morning
And I look up at the blue
For something deep inside of me
Should I put my faith in you
Should I put my faith in you
What do I have to believe in
Now that everything else was a lie
Should I put my faith in you
Should I put my faith in you
What do I have to believe in
Now that everything else was a lie
Should I put my faith in you
Should I put my faith in you
I lay down in the evening
And I look up at the stars
But I don't believe in miracles
Should I put my faith in ours
I wake up in the morning
And I look up at the blue
For something deep inside of me
Should I put my faith in you
Should I put my faith in you
Should I put my faith in you
Should I put my faith in you
Should I put my faith in you
Should I put my faith in you
Should I put my faith in you
