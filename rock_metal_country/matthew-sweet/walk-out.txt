When you look into a mirror
The reflection that you see
Is a shell of what you were
It's not who you want to be
But you're gonna change
You've just about made up your mind
You're gonna change
You're gonna change
And when you leave it all behind
What will the past remember?
What will the future bring?
When you walk out
When you walk out
You were brought into this world
With a head full of good ideas
But the person you became
Well you just couldn't be for real
But you're gonna change
You've just about made up your mind
You're gonna change
You're gonna change
And when you leave it all behind
What will the past remember?
What will the future bring?
When you walk out
When you walk out
But you're gonna change
You've just about made up your mind
You're gonna change
You're gonna change
And when you leave it all behind
What will the past remember?
What will the future bring?
When you walk out
When you walk out
When you walk out
When you walk out
When you walk out
