When you said to me
You are not so old
Did I know it then?
'Cause I had just been told
I didn't think I'd find you
Perfect in so many ways
But I've been waiting [waiting]
And I want to [have you]
I've been waiting [waiting]
And I want to
The secret on your lips
That nobody knows
Gentle in your eyes
You can wear my clothes
I didn't think I'd find you
Perfect in so many ways
But I've been waiting [waiting]
And I want to [have you]
I've been waiting [waiting]
And I want to [have you]
I've been waiting [waiting]
And I want to
I've been waiting [waiting]
I've been waiting [waiting]
I've been waiting [waiting]
I've been waiting [waiting]
