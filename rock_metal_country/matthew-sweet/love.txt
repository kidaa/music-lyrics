You could change your mind forever 
You could change your style of dress
You could find another lover
But you'll never find love
You will never find love
You could swear you never live here
Forget you knew my name
You could find another lover
But you'll never find love Not like this, no
You will never find love
As the days begin to pass us
And the nights, well they tend to flow
And you're with some other lover
Will you tell him who I was?
And you will never find love 
You could find another lover
But you'll never find love
Not like this, baby
No, you will never find love
Not like this, baby
