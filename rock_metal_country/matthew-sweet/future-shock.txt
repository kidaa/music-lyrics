I never wanted to be more than passing time
And you would rather disappear than cross the line
And I'm only waiting for you
'Cause I can't decide
If you're only saying one thing
With something else inside
From the start there is a coldness in my eye
Until the moment that I speak you won't know why
But you never ask the question
You just close the door
And you never get the answer
I was waiting for
Maybe that's someplace time won't take you
Looking around I could replace you
Wanting for something you have never had
But you never ask the question
You just close the door
And you never get the answer
I was waiting for
Maybe that's someplace time won't take you
Looking around I could replace you
Wanting for something you have never had
You've never had
You've never had
You've never had
