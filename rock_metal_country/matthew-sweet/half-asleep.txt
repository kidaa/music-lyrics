Shut your eyes
And you'll remember like the first time what it meant to see
Take your time
Any reason why you can't go on is fine with me
As long as we don't sit in silence
I don't want to see the whole thing wasted
As long as we have time to be...Half Asleep
Half asleep
It takes a while
I'd give everything I've got to know how many days
I don't accuse you
'Cause any problem that there is I put in my own way
But I don't want to sit in silence
I don't want to see the whole thing wasted
As long as we have time to be...Half Asleep
Half asleep
We always have to say we're sorry
But every time we say we're sorry
It's closer to the real thing
We stay here some
'Cause we aren't going to get much closer to a real answer;
The sleeping cured you;
Ya know tomorrow we can waste the day and start another.
As long as we don't sit in silence
I don't want to see the whole thing wasted
As long as we have time to be...Half Asleep
Half asleep
I don't wanna sit in silence
I don't wannt see the whole thing wasted
As long as we have time to be...Half Asleep
Half asleep
