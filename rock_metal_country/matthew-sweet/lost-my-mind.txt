Well I know you are dying to give me advice
Speak to me once or a hundred times
Those are words I cannot hear
Thinking looks good but I don't like the taste
A mind is a terrible thing to waste
But it was a thin veil
Dropped it like a tail
Jumped into my face
Creeping up behind
Lost my mind
You can't stomach the truth
And I only tell lies
You don't care if I live
I don't care if I die
So we follow the same sound
Standing on the ground
The Earth she treat me kind
Left my thoughts behind
Lost my mind
We follow the same sound
Standing on the ground
The Earth she treat me kind
Left my thoughts behind
Lost my mind
Next time it will be all of me all of me
Next time it will be all of me all of me
Next time it will be all of me all of me
Next time it will be all of me all of me
Next time it will be all of me
