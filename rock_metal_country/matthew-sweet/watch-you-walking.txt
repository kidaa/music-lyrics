Safe in the night
When people look but can not see
Pale in the light
That shines above onto the street
I watch you walkin' on the other side
And I turn my head away in shame
Wishin' they'd talk in the worthless--
Quaint and reserved
The house that knows you in detail
Slender and curved
You come down stairs to get your mail
I watch you walkin' on the other side
And I feel my thinking rearrange
As slowly every thought will change
Summer has gone
October fled without a word
Winter is on
My conscience has remained uncured
I watch you walkin' on the other side
And I rush my fingers through my hair
Telling myself that it is not fair
I watch you walkin' on the other side
And I rush my fingers through my hair
Telling myself that it is not fair
