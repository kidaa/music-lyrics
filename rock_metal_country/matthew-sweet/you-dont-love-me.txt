What a beautiful moment 
The truth comes out at last 
Once your heart would own me forever 
Then this passed 
And what a beautiful moment 
As my heard comes apart 
Drunk and in a manner of saying, wasted 
'Cause you don't love me 
You don't love me 
You can't see how I matter in this world 
Even though I loved you 
You can't believe that 
If you find something 
You think might make you happy 
Then I guess it's okay, I think it's okay 
If you go away 
Blown right out of my senses 
I did not know what to do 
Lost and badly wanting someone 
To see me through 
That's why I needed you 
But you don't love me, you don't love me 
You can't see how I matter in this world 
Even though I loved you 
You can't believe that 
You think that leaving 
Is what will make you happy 
Then I guess it's okay, I think it's okay 
If you go away 
'Cause you don't love me 
You don't love me 
You can't see how I matter in this world 
Even though I loved you 
You can't believe that 
You think that leaving 
Is what will make you happy 
Then I guess it's okay, I think it's okay 
If you go away 
'Cause you don't love me 
You don't love me...
