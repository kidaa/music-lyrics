You can't give everything
There isn't much I can give
It's not a penny from the foot
He left in the door
Can't say anything
Not say things though they *
Some may be
But oh baby
It's only today
This above all
I thought you would remember
And the first song is out the door
This above all
You can remember
This above all
I will remember too
You can't just go ahead
And not look back at the past
Some call it black
Some hide it
Can't know anything
And think you know it at all
Without lying
But you can keep trying
It's only today
This above all
I thought you would remember
And the first song is out the door
This above all
You can remember
This above all
I will remember too
You can't give everything
There isn't much I can give
It's not a penny from the foot
He left in the door
Can't say anything
Not say things though they *
Well some may be
But c'mon baby
It's only today
This above all
I thought you would remember
And the first song is out the door
This above all
You can remember
This above all
I will remember too
This above all
This above all
This above all
This above all...
