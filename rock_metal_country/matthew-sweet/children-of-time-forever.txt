3014, we're still around
Even the cure for cancer was found
People come to life every day
Watching their futures drifting away
And there's a nagging thought in the back of my head
Would we love forever if we'd never be dead
Forever I'll be yours and you be my girl
Forever We will live in this magical world
Forever Children of time we sing and we shout
Forever Still don't know what our lives are about
At 4060, what might we see
I'm not concerned about you and me
But the crazy people still in their right minds
With nothing better to do with their time
Than driving in their cars with our kids
Higher than we've ever been
Forever You be mine and I'll be your man
Forever We will live in this magical land
Forever Children of time we sing and we shout
Forever Still don't know what our lives are about
I see planes in the sun
Will we not remember what we've done
I'm in love with this small planet
Any other way I just wouldn't have it
God sings his final song unto man
*Come back to the river where time began
Exploring all our senses as one
Sure will be a whole lot of fun
Forever I'll be yours and you be my girl
Forever We will live in this magical world
Forever Children of time we sing and we shout
Forever Still don't know what our lives are about
Forever You be mine and I'll be your man
Forever We will live in this magical land
Forever Children of time we sing and we shout
Forever Still don't know what our lives are about
Forever Children of time we sing and we shout
Forever Still don't know what our lives are about
Forever Children of time we sing and we shout
Forever Still don't know what our lives are about
