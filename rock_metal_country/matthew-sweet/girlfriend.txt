I want to love somebody
I hear you need somebody to love
Oh I want to love somebody
I hear you're looking
for somebody to love
'Cause you need to be back
in the arms of a good friend
and I need to be back
in the arms of a girlfriend
I didn't know nobody
and then I saw you coming my way
Oh I didn't know nobody
and then I saw you coming my way
Don't you need to be back
in the arms of a good friend?
Oh 'cause honey believe me
I'd sure love to call you
my girlfriend
[solo]
Don't you need to be back
in the arms of a good friend?
Oh 'cause honey believe me
I'd sure love to call you
my girlfriend
'Cause you
got a good thing going baby
You only need somebody to love
Oh you got a good thing going
You're only looking
for someone to love
'Cause you need to get back
in the arms of a good friend
And I'm never gonna set you free
No I'm never gonna set you free
