Your depth of sadness was a gift
And for a while I cherished it
I'm tired of wasting my time away
So I'm giving it back to you
Giving it back to you
It takes a lot to keep you going
Wearing me down without you knowing
My will to fight has gone away
So I'm giving it back to you
Giving it back to you
I'm tired of wasting my time away
So I'm giving it back to you
Giving it back to you
I'm tired of wasting my time away
So I'm giving it back to you
Giving it back to you
Giving it back
