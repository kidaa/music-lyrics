Without a single breath of noiselessness she can't speak
[But we'll] keep raging through the [cold rushes]
So I will quiet her
Tell her the words that she needs to hear
I will quiet her
Tell her the words that she needs to hear
And I won't be left at the battle front
I'll be getting off with the one I love tonight
Kicked up a lot of dust [ . . . started off] she took it
And love will falter if your faith is lost
But I can quiet her
Tell her the words that she needs to hear
I will quiet her
Tell her the words that she needs to hear
And I won't be left at the battle front
I'll be getting off with the one I love tonight
And I won't be left at the battle front
I'll be getting off with the one I love tonight
And I will quiet her
Tell her the words that she needs to hear
I will quiet her
Tell her the words that she needs to hear
And I won't be left at the battle front
I'll be getting off with the one I love...
I'll be getting off with the one I love...
