I thought I knew you
I was in for a surprise
I let my love flow 
From my heart into your eyes
And then I found out
That there was nothing I could know or guess about you
You'd go as far as you could go 
And it took me years to figure out
That there was nothing I could give to you
And years to figure out 
That there was nothing you would take from me
And how can I describe 
The way you slowly took my hope away
And all of the time
I thought I knew you
