Who cares if they don't think your cool?
They make everything about rules 
And your older than that now
Get older
The world will fall into its place
You may be sad 
When you get older 
You might be happy just to stay
Who cares if you don't know what you want
'Cause they don't know what they've got 
And you cannot resist
Get older 
Your memories won't slip away
And you'll be glad 
When you get older 
That you were happy for today
Who cares?
Get older 
The world will fall into its place
You may be sad
When you get older 
You might be happy just to stay
Resist
Get older 
Your memories won't slip away
And you'll be glad 
When you get older 
That you were happy for today
Who cares?
If you don't know what you want
If you don't know what you want
If you don't know what you want
If you don't know what you want
