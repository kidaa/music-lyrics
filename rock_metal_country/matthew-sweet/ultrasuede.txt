Ultrasuede heaven made
Honey never tasted so sweet
Ultrasuede finest grade
From my head up to your feet
I'm alive
You've got me running around in your
Ultrasuede
Ultrasuede I'll give anything you desire
If I get my way
I'm leaving it up to you
Ultrasuede heaven made
Hot enough to burn your lips on
Ultrasuede sweetly played
soft enough to sink my teeth and you'll see
I don't care where you've been 
Ultrasuede
Ultrasuede I'll give you anything you desire
If I have my way
I'm leaving it up to you
You take me high, and you don't know why
People show you what to do
Done thirty days in a million ways 
I am still in love with you 
Aww, let me show you
Ultrasuede heaven made
Honey never tasted so sweet
Ultrasuede finest grade
From my head up to your feet
I'm alive
But you've got me running around in your
Ultrasuede
Ultrasuede I'll give you anything you desire
If I get my way
I'm leaving it up to you
Ultrasuede
Ultrasuede I'll give you anything you desire
If I get my way
I'm leaving it up to you
Ultrasuede
Ultrasuede
I'm leaving it up to you
Ultrasuede
Ultrasuede
I'm leaving it up to you
Ultrasuede
Ultrasuede
I'm leaving it up to you
Ultrasuede
