It's a matter of choices
And a matter of time 
For you it's a matter of drive
You will let nothing
Get in your way
You set to conquer 
Each single day
everything Everything Changes changes
But change itself change itself 
You can take out 
What you think you know put it
Back on the shelf
And would you believe me
If I'd spoke my mind?
'Cause nobody gets there they just
Try, try, try
everything Everything Changes changes
But change itself change itself
Like a bird you'd sooner fly away
But you're stuck in yourself
as everything As everything Changes.... changes..
We stay the same
But we stay the same stay the same
You keep turning 
Before long you're going to find out
What's in a name
So you look for the answer
Then pull it apart
Tear it up 'til there's nothing there
'Cause it hurts your heart
Everything Changes
And for what you lack
You keep turning
Before long you're going to find out
Everything Changes
It's not hard to tell
Like a bird you'd sooner fly away
