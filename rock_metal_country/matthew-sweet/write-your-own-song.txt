I guess I live in a world you'll never get a glimpse inside of
If the thought of me selling out gets you excited
Do you think everything that nobody else has thought of
Do you feel everything that no one else can feel
I do too
Why don't you write your own song
If mine doesn't do it for you
You might get it all wrong
Or you might create the hit
You wish that I would write for you
'Cause I haven't been able to do what you need
And you're right there fighting for what I find appalling
Bringing me further down than I've already fallen
And you tell me that I only have one chance to win
And you only want to take me where I've never been
I'm with you
Why don't you write your own song
And I won't have to hear it
When you get it all wrong
I'll find a way to clear it
From my memory of you
You just do what you have to do
'Cause I'm not listening
Why don't you write your own song
If mine doesn't do it for you
You might get it all wrong
Or you might create the hit
Why don't you write your own song
I'll find a way to clear it
From my memory of you
You just do what you have to do
'Cause I'm not listening
