Me and my girl are going underground
Got no time to tell you what we found
People in this world aren't very kind
And love is blind, love is blind
All we want is on our minds
We don't have a map, we don't follow signs
Seems useless for you to look for attack
No tracking us down and no bringing us back
Me and my girl are going underground
Got no time to tell you what we found
People in this world aren't very kind
And love is blind, love is blind
We are going very far
You can't take a plane, you can't take a car
Seems useless for you to look for attack
No tracking us down and no bringing us back
All we want is on our minds
We don't have a map, we don't follow signs
Seems useless for you to look for attack
No tracking us down and no bringing us back
Me and my girl are going underground
Got no time to tell you what we found
People in this world aren't very kind
And love is blind, love is blind
Me and my girl are going underground
Got no time to tell you what we found
People in this world aren't very kind
And love is blind, love is blind
