Everything is perfect in a way
But not today
What could tomorrow bring?
Even when I beg you
Will you please be good to me?
You're running free
Just make believe you love me
And i'll try harder than before
'Cause it's a real love
That keeps us coming back for more
If anything Anything I question can be used
Against my will
And it will be 'til you
Understand the question is
A cup that cannot be filled
By what you feel
I'll make believe i love you
And i'll try harder than before
'Cause it's a real love
That keeps us coming back for more
Just make believe you love me
And i'll try harder than before
'Cause it's a real love
That keeps us coming back for more
