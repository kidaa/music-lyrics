If you're big enough to take it
When the truth gets overwhelming
Then along with many others
You fight
If you're small enough to fit yourself
Among so many millions
With your own set of problems to face
If it's worse to live than to let go
You've got to let me know
If it's worse to live than to let go
You've got to let me know
In my nightmare
When I try so hard to find you
I can't see your way or want you to be free
If it's worse to live than to let go
You've got to let me know
If it's worse to live than to let go
You've got to let me know
Worse to live
Worse to live
If it's worse to live than to let go
You've got to let me know
If it's worse to live than to let go
You've got to let me know...
