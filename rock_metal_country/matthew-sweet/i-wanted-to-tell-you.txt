Do just what you want to
I think you're right
I do what I want to to
I do what I want to to
I let the world surround me
'Cause I saw no real harm
I didn't stop to think of you
You were already in my arms
I was wrong but I
But I, I wanted to tell you, I needed to tell you, What I couldn't say
And love, I needed to find mine, But it took me a long time, to see
I wanted to tell you
I wanted to tell you
What I couldn't say [love]
I needed to find mine
But it took me a long time to see
Love... well never mind
I know how you feel about that
Now what do you think about time? [something...]
I wanted to tell you
I wanted to tell you
What I couldn't say [love]
I needed to find mine
But it took me a long time to see
I do what I want to to
I do what I want to to
I do what I want to to
I do what I want to to
I let the world surround me
'Cause I saw no real harm
I didn't stop to think of you
You were already in my arms
But there was something...
I wanted to tell you
I wanted to tell you
What I couldn't say [love]
I needed to find mine
But it took me a long time to see
Love...
