When it shines the sun is hot
And what you need you ain't got
Heaven and earth
Are hardly worth it
We'll begin the race by living in ecstacy
You may have your mind to show
But you've got no place to go
Heaven and earth
Are hardly worth it
We'll begin the race by living a life of ecstacy
We'll begin the race by living in ecstacy
Will you share with me to live
What nobody wants to give
Heaven and earth
Are hardly worth it
We'll begin the race by living a life of ecstacy
We'll begin the race by ripping a rib for u from me
We'll begin the race by living a life of ecstacy 
We'll begin the race by living in ecstacy
