Bad blood set you up for a fall
Think you're so smart that you're fooling us all
But it seems, there must of been something wrong
Say you'll get back if you have to crawl
Well it's a fat chance that you'll make it at all
And it seems, you must of done something wrong
And I remember what you said
It was all over my head
But now it's coming back to me
You don't have the system beat, no
You're traveling down a one way street 
Like the rest of us
You must of done something wrong
And I remember what you said
That it's all over my head
But now it's coming back to me
And I remember what you said
It was all over my head
But now it's coming back to me
You must of done something wrong
It was all over my head
You must of done something wrong
It was all over my head
