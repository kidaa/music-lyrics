Do You really Want to run away with me?
Would you really like to run away with me?
I can feel very clearly but no longer see
'Cause I'm Looking at the sun
Waiting for you to appear
Watched you getting nearer like 
I knew it in my heart
'Til the damage was already done
Looking at the sun 
Burned my eyes out and I'm blind now
Yeah I'm blind now
