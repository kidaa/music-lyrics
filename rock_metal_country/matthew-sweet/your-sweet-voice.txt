Speak to me with your sweet voice
And take me through another night
Speak to me with your sweet voice
And I will surely be alright
If I can close my eyes without a fear
Speak to me with your sweet voice
Near
Hold me in your warm hand
And I could sleep with you tonight
Hold me in your warm hand
And I could sleep with you tonight
And all my earthly cares might fade away
If you hold me in your warm hand that way
It's as close as I get to love
As close as I get to love
Speak to me with your sweet voice
Again
Speak to me with your sweet voice
And take me through another night
Speak to me with your sweet voice
And I will surely be alright
If I can close my eyes without a fear
Speak to me with your sweet voice
Near
Speak to me with your sweet voice
That way
Speak to me with your sweet voice...
