You've counted every star
That you could imagine
Broken when everyone took you for a fool
It gave you a reason
To find something strong enough to feel
You're reaching out reaching out
You're reaching out reaching out
You're reaching out
Beaten by a child
You can't even know when
Now you can never be free from what was done
You can't even hate them
You'll find something big enough to steal
You're reaching out reaching out
You're reaching out reaching out
You're reaching out
And if I can't know you
All my dreams are through
Every waking hour is filled with lead
I'm dead
I've counted every star
That you could imagine
Broken when everyone took me for a fool
It gave me a reason
To find something strong enough to feel
You're reaching out reaching out
You're reaching out reaching out
You're reaching out
And if I can't know you
All my dreams are through
Every waking hour is filled with lead
I'm dead
I'm dead
