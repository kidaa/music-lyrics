I don't wanna do it over 'cause I've made my case
But I wish that I could live another place
Try to make it over but it won't erase
So it looks like I'm still trapped inside this space
If time permits me
To right my wrong deed
If time permits me to live
I could throw a hundred things you did away
If it meant that we could have another day
If time permits me
To right my wrong deed
If time permits me to live
I don't want to do it over
I don't want to do it over
But it looks like I'm still trapped inside this space
If time permits me
To right my wrong deed
If time permits me to live
