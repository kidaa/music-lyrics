Well you can make your way through living and loving
Looking good from where I sit
But with your great big eyes you see what is coming
And you're not a part of it
Millenium Blues
Lived half in one and half in the other
They say it's not you anymore
Part of me wants to stay in the middle
But I know it's old news now
And how far forward will I have to travel
To stay ahead of you
Millenium Blues
Lived half in one and half in the other
It's not about you anymore
I'm finally up to speed
I'm in over my head
And I'm not looking back
Millenium Blues
Lived half in one and half in the other
They say it's not you anymore
Part of me wants to stay in the middle
Part of me wants to lose control
Millenium Blues
Lived half in one and half in the other
Millenium Blues
You'll never get the chance to recover
They say it's not you anymore
It's not about you anymore
It's not about you anymore
They say it's not you anymore
