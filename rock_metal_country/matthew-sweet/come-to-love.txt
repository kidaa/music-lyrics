You try to win
At a game that has no winners
You try to learn
When nothing can be understood
You try to feel
When all feeling is gone
And you come to love
What you used to hate
You come to find
What you threw away
You thought that time
Would be your rock
And now this time
It is unlocked
Time will fly
If you can't let it go
And you come to love
What you used to hate
You come to find
What you threw away
When will you discover
Who you really are inside
Follow any other reason
you won't be satisfied
If time will fly
If you can't let it go
And you come to love
What you used to hate
You come to find
What you threw away
And you won't wait for long
'Cause you come to love
What you used to hate
