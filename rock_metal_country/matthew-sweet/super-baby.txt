No Memory
Is quite the same
No gentle breeze
Can ease my pain
Lover you're the one
Super baby
You're the one
Super baby
You're the one
Promise you won't go far
I want you right where you are
I said it to your face
So it cannot be erased now
I got a hold
On destiny
Yeah I hear the sound
Of Liberty
Lover you're the one
Super baby
You're the one
Super baby
You're the one
Promise you won't go far
I want you right where you are
I said it to your face
So it cannot be erased now
A mountain higher
Than my dream
A dawn on fire
You will sing
You will sing
Lover you're the one
Super baby
You're the one
Super baby
You're the one
Promise you won't go far
I want you right where you are
I said it to your face
So it cannot be erased now
