You come looking for protection a revolver in your hand
And that puts it in a language that I think I understand
Don't need to concentrate to push it through
You know you've sent it so I'm coming back to you
Anybody with a half a brain will tell you that you cannot win
But just ask the brainless wonder living underneath my skin
I'll tell you anything but what is true
No sense in giving in i'm coming back to you
Back to you
Anybody with a half a brain will tell you that you cannot win
But just ask the brainless wonder living underneath my skin
I'll tell you anything but what is true
No sense in giving in i'm coming back to you
Back to you
