I'm in too deep
Drowning in the fire
Burning in the lake
Dying from desire, dying for desire
I'm in too deep
Grasping like a liar
Yeah, and do you want me
'Cause I'm gonna fly, yeah, I'm gonna fly
I'm in too deep
And even when you think you already know what to do, baby
There comes a hard road rushing at you
And honey ain't life sweet
Mmm, too deep
I'm in too deep
I've opened up my eyes now
'Cause now I understand how
It's easy when the fear is real with the fear
I cannot sleep
Walking in a dreamland
Wishing I could feel shame
'Cause there's nobody else to blame nobody else
I'm in too deep
And even when you think you already know what to do, baby
There comes a hard road rushing at you
And honey ain't life
And honey ain't life sweet
Ah, it's too deep
I'm in too deep
Drowning in the fire
Burning in the lake
Dying from desire, dying for desire
Dying from desire, dying for desire
Dying from desire, dying for desire
