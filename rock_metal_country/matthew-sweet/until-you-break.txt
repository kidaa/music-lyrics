Hanging on to your pride
Trying not to decide
Who could take you
Do you hold it inside
Or let it fall by the way
I'll feel the way you feel
And tell you after
But how long will it take
How long until you break
To talk you into space
How long until you break
Put an end to your day
Turn your light out and say
That first I'll get to know
And love you after
Just how long will it take
How long until you break
To talk you into space
How long until you break
I'll feel the way you feel
And love you after
Just how long will it take
How long until you break
To talk you into space
How long until you break
Just how long will it take
How long until you break
To talk you into space
How long until you break
'Til you break
