Started with a rose, ended up a millionaress queen
In your new electric chair, sweetly sitting there building up steam
Watch your mind little bit, or you're gonna have to make believe
Flew into LA, caught a screening of your lifelong dream
Blew it in LA, now you're desperate to create your own scene
But watch your mind little bit, 'cause you're headed into the machine
Come to California come to California
Come to California come to California
Come to California come to California
Come to California come to California
Come to California, baby let it all hang out
Come to California, tell us what it's all about
But watch your mind little bit, 'cause the future is beginning now
Come to California come to California
Come to California come to California
Come to California come to California
Come to California come to California
But watch your mind little bit, 'cause you're headed into the machine
Come to California come to California
Come to California come to California
Come to California come to California
Come to California come to California
