Are you made like God
When you start to bleed
Do you really know
What it is to breathe
Without a mind to think
Or a hand in fate
You're an animal
Filled with love and hate 
And you
And the way you move
And the things you say
Your desperate dreams
Are pathetic
I don't like knowing people
I don't like people knowing about me
I don't like knowing people
I don't like people knowing about me
Why should we care
What we do or say
Why would we long
For yesterday
What is here
And who wants to stay
No lasting life
And no judgement day
And the fact of you
And the way you move
And the things you say
Your desperate dreams 
Are pathetic
I don't like knowing people
I don't like people knowing about me
I don't like knowing people
I don't like people knowing about me
What are you lookin' at?
I don't like knowing people
I don't like people knowing about me
I don't like knowing people
I don't like people knowing about me
I don't like knowing people
And I don't like people knowing about me
I don't like knowing people
And I don't like people knowing about me
Get out of here
