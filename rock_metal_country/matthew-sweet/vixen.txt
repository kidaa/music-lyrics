If we stop to think of life
As time that's running slow
From birth to death like day to night
It isn't very far to go
So I'm cruisin' cruisin' with my pretty little vixen
I can't believe the strength of my addiction
To absolute freedom
Cruisin,' ah-huh, with my pretty little vixen
Guided by the depth of her conviction
To absolute freedom
Baby let me talk you down
Or pull you in the snow
Hey honey-thing now don't you frown
They say my feelings never show
'Cause I'm cruisin' cruisin' with my pretty little vixen
I can't believe the strength of my addiction
To absolute freedom
Cruisin,' ah-huh, with my pretty little vixen
Guided by the depth of her convictions
To absolute freedom
Lover, as you ride with me
Tell me what you see
I'm understanding by and by
Things you thought I'd never try
So I'm cruisin' cruisin' with my pretty little vixen
I can't believe the strength of my addiction
To absolute freedom
Cruisin,' ah-huh, with my pretty little vixen
Guided by the depth of her conviction
To absolute freedom...
