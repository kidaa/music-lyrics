Living with my hopelessness
I wasn't very smart
But I died an early death
But now I know I wasn't alive yet
There's a mountain in the side of me
My vision that you can't see
She never touched me like you do, mama
Each time I take a little bit, take a little bit
take a little more
You know, got vertigo
What about the things we said
In strictest confidence
Does this mean I'll have to stop pretending that I'm not scared of heights *now
There's a mountain in the side of you
My vision, I swear it's true
*You never touch you like I do oh no
Each time I take a little bit, take a little bit
take a little more
you know, that's vertigo
Each time I take a little bit, take a little bit
take a little more
you know, that's vertigo
Each time I take a little bit, take a little bit
take a little more
you know, that's vertigo
There's a mountain in the side of me
My vision that you can't see
She never touched me like you do, mama
Each time I take a little bit, take a little bit
take a little more
you know, that's vertigo
Got vertigo, that's vertigo...vertigo, got vertigo
