I should never have let you know
That I could be what I was not
I should never have let you know
That I was weaker than you thought
Can you show me
'Cause I did it for you once and now you owe me
'Cause you say that you possess me and then you loan me
Out to anyone who passes by
I should never have let you know
That I could see beyond the dawn
I should never have let you know
The night is short the day is long
Can you show me
'Cause I did it for you once and now you owe me
'Cause you say that you possess me and then you loan me
Out to anyone that passes by
Never have let you know
Never have let you know
Never have let you know
I should never have let you know
Never have let you know
Never have let you know
Can you show me
'Cause I did it for you once and now you owe me
'Cause you say that you possess me and then you loan me
Out to anyone that passes by
Never have let you know
Never have let you know
