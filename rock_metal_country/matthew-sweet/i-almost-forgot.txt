You would never turn around
You're laughing at everything
That's bringing me down
Did you say you loved me?
I almost forgot, I almost forgot
That I will never be free
There'll always be something
Stuck inside of me
Did you say you felt that?
I almost forgot, I almost forgot
I almost forgot, I almost forgot
I almost forgot, I almost forgot
You knew me
Changed my name
If love leaves us for a moment
Is it gone forever?
Make up your mind
But then you should never have to choose
Whenever you win you know
I'm wishing you'd lose
So you know I love you
I almost forgot, I almost forgot
I almost forgot, I almost forgot
I almost forgot, I almost forgot
