Now you're never gonna get back to the boy you had
You have broken the chains forever
Now you're never gonna get back to the girl you were
you are looking for a boy...
I have found you
Standing free, now that he...
No longer surrounds you
Wishing your memories
Away
Come catch your breath
Nobody's going to rush you
Catch your breath
This time you don't have to hide
All those hopes you're frightened of and have no strength to fight
Alone
It was written in the stars you'd be resting here
Slipping straight from the arms of heaven
No I never would have guessed in a million years
You were looking for a sign...
Now I hold you
Shivering in my arms...
Forget what he told you
Wishing your memories
Away
Come catch your breath
Nobody's going to rush you
Catch your breath
This time you don't have to hide
All those hopes you're frightened of and have no strength to fight
Alone
You were looking for a boy...
I have found you
Standing free, now that he...
No longer surrounds you
Wishing your memories
Away
Come catch your breath
Nobody's going to rush you
Catch your breath
This time you don't have to hide
Catch catch your breath
Nobody's going to rush you
Catch your breath
This time you don't have to hide
Catch your breath...
