Do you realize what they have done
Showed me I am not the only one
Planted something in my mind
Now I've begun to find
Missing time
I want back
I'm afraid that I can feel
Missing time
I want back
Didn't realize they took from me
Everything my eyes had lived to see
Even when they touched my heart
I felt I could not move
Missing time
Holds the key
Something they left here with me
Missing time
I want back
Is there something I can almost see
'Cause you know they're 
Coming back for me
Even as you watch us go
Finally you will know
Missing time
Holds the key
Something they left here with me
Missing time
I want back
I'm afraid that I can feel
Missing time
I want back
I'm afraid that I can feel
Missing time 
I want back
