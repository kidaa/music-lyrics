You think you're so fast, but I know who Said it was the first..
..place, it wasn't you
And you think you're so smart, but I don't know.........
know Every now and then..
... I guess it starts to show
And I'm just like you, I don't wanna be alone
I don't know what to do, I'm sittin' around at home
Waiting for love to appear when I feel again
I wasted the best of my time
time Hating to think it was mine
mine Looking away 
You think you're so cool, but I've seen through
People who for years have been holding you
And you think I'm so small, but I am not
Now we're talking big, honey, I miss you a lot
'Cause I'm just like you, I don't wanna be alone
I don't know what to do, so I'm sittin' around at home
Waiting for love to appear when I feel again
You think you're so cool, but I've seen through
The people who for years have been holding you
And you think you're so smart, but I don't know
Every now and then I guess it starts to show
And I'm just like you, I don't wanna be alone
I don't know what to do, I'm sittin' around at home
Waiting for love to appear when I feel again
I wasted the best of my time
time Hating to think it was mine
mine Looking away
