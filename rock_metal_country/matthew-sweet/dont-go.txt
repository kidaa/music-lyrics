Don't Go Don't let my love drive you away
There is so much I have left to say
Oh don't go Don't bring my darkness to the day
There is so much I have left to say
Oh don't go
There is so much I have left to say
Come back You know I wrote another song
They keep telling me the past is gone
But it looks like My evil deeds are coming 'round
I can't watch them put you in the ground
Oh don't go
I can't watch them put you in the ground
Don't go
Don't go Don't make me have to say goodbye
'Cause I need to look you in the eye
Oh don't go
I still need to look you in the eye
Don't go
I still need to look you in the eye
Don't go
No don't go
