Oh I used to sit around all day
What would I do if I found her
Figuring out what I might say
For a moment she was wonderful
So I know I've got a little luck comin' to me
Got a little luck comin' to me
I guess I'd never seen a girl as easy to explain
The wind and the sun got to talking
Wind and the sun * her there
Like I'd never seen a woman beautiful and tame
Wind and the sun got together
Wind and the sun in her hair
All the seasons seem to congregate
Winter the cool of her whisper
Summer the warmth of her hair
Autumn at her eyes of *
Spring at the sound of her laughter
Never will dissipate
And I guess I'd never seen a girl as easy to explain
The wind and the sun got to talking
Wind and the sun * her there
Like I'd never seen a woman beautiful and tame
Wind and the sun got together
Wind and the sun in her hair
Spring at the sound of her laughter spring at the sound of her laughter
Never will dissipate
And I guess I'd never seen a girl as easy to explain
The wind and the sun got to talking
Wind and the sun * her there
Like I'd never seen a woman beautiful and tame
Wind and the sun got together
Wind and the sun in her hair
