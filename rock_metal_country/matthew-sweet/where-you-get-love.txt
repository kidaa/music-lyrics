Instead of running
Stay and keep it coming
You're getting your kicks right at the source
You're taking your guidance from the force
But where do you get love
Down below or from somewhere above
Got a scary feeling I know
Where you get love
Am I the whore
You're working for 
I'm here if you want to keep me near
much further away than I appear
Where do you get love
Down below or from somewhere above
Got a scary feeling I know
Where you get love
Instead of running
Stay and keep it coming
Stay and keep it coming
Stay and keep it coming
Where do you get love
Down below or from somewhere above
Got a scary feeling I know
Where do you get love
Where do you get love
Down below or from somewhere above
Got a scary feeling I know
Where do you get love
Where do you get love
