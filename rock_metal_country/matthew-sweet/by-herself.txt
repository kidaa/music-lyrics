I left her the message
She won't let me down
She's coming right up my road
We'll take a *tribute to the finer shake down
We'll get her hard to *explode
'Cause I will not let her out of my head
Til she gets up on out of that bed
She's always by herself
She'll be all by herself
She's by herself
She'll be all by herself
First time * faith to believe
The cards she holds up her sleeve
I ask her what do you want to create
She said she's tryin' to make Mona Lisa shake, but
I will not let her out of my head
Til she learns she can do it with me
Still by herself
She is all by herself
She's by herself
She is all by herself herself
Herself herself she
by by herself
All by herself
She's all by herself
She *pinning up the things that tie up her mind
That kind of love could give sight to the blind
Why she's by herself
She is all by herself
She's by herslef
She'll be all by herself
By herself
She'll be all by herself
By herself
She'll be all by herself
By her, by by herself...
All by herself.
