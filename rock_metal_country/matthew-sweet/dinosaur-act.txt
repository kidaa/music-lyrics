Born on a Cloud, stupid and proud
I'm gonna take you back now
Cursed by the past, Held under glass
I was too hard to shake down
And I'm coming back with my dinosaur act
Did you forget me baby after the fact
I'm telling you
I'm coming back with my dinosaur act
I still remember baby what we both lack
We both lack
Lost in the head, lost in your bed
I wouldn't call you lucky
You're getting old, ready to fold
You do not feel like fighting
Don't worry
'Cause I'm coming back with my dinosaur act
Do you forget me baby
After the fact I'm telling you
I'm coming back with my dinosaur act
I still remember baby what we both lack
We both lack
We both lack
And I'm coming back with my dinosaur act
Do you forget me baby
After the fact I'm telling you
I'm coming back with my dinosaur act
I still remember baby what we both lack
We both lack
We now lack
We now lack
We now lack
