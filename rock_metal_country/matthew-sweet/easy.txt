She remembers how we met
Through a friend of ours
I took her for a ride and laid her
Underneath the stars
And even now it makes me laugh to think we wanted more
And always talked about how hard it was
When really it was so
Easy
It was so easy
It was so easy
And ever since this stroke of luck
I was feeling fine
Sometimes even seemed this life
Might be a friend of mine
But all these notions disappeared as soon as she was gone
It was as hard as they had always said
Somehow we were so
Easy
We were so easy
We always talked about how hard it was
When really it was so
Easy
We were so easy
We were so easy
We were so easy
