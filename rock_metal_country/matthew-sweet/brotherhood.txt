As my girl you make me strong
Watching and helping along
Come in and I'll play any game you play
I'll hear every word you say
Did you tell me how you feel about brotherhood
Between any two have it half as good
We must be feeling
Brotherhood
Tell me how you feel about brotherhood
Between any two have it half as good
We must be feeling
Brotherhood
So close to touching the end
More like a sister than friend
When I watch you go I hold my breath and *dream
Once I see you after me
So tell me how you feel about brotherhood
Between any two have it half as good
We must be feeling
Brotherhood
Tell me how you feel about brotherhood
Between any two have it half as good
We must be feeling
Brotherhood
Come in and I'll play any game you play
I'll hear every word you say
You can tell me how you feel about brotherhood
Between any two have it half as good
We must be feeling
Brotherhood
Tell me how you feel about brotherhood
Between any two have it half as good
We must be feeling
Brotherhood
Tell me how you feel about brotherhood
It's a word I never understood
Til now
Brotherhood
Tell me how you feel about brotherhood
It's a word I never understood
Til now
Brotherhood
Brotherhood
Brotherhood
Brotherhood
Brotherhood.
