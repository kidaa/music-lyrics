The way that you remember there was nothing to say
So you threw your arms around me, threw your arms around me
Girl you shouldn't think that I've got nowhere to go
But I'll tell you how I felt if you really want to know
How warm in the morning when you asked me to stay
And how cool in the evening when you sent me away
We were right in the middle I was ready to say
How cool in the evening when you sent me away
Baby when you touch me with that look in your eye
I can feel the air around me, feel the air around me
Close enough to whisper, as I soon hope to be
I'll wrap some words around you if that'll make you see
How warm in the morning when you asked me to stay
And how cool in the evening when you sent me away
We were right in the middle I was ready to say
How cool in the evening when you sent me away
Baby when you touch me with that look in your eye
How warm in the morning when you asked me to stay
And how cool in the evening when you sent me away
We were right in the middle I was ready to say
How cool in the evening when you sent me away
How warm in the morning when you asked me to stay
And how cool in the evening when you sent me away
We were right in the middle I was ready to say
How cool in the evening when you sent me away...
