Tell me what you want me to do
Tell me what you want me to say
When nothing I do or I say is enough
Everything fits but the size of my love
Out of proportion and into your drug
Into your drug
Into your drug
Now how can I give you the world
Painted on the side of a pearl
When neither the pearl nor the world's big enough
Everything fits into the size of my love
Out of proportion and into your drug
Into your drug
Into your drug
Nothing I do or I say is enough
Everything fits but the size of my love
Out of proportion and into your drug
Into your drug
Into your drug
