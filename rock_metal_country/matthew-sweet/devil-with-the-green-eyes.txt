I can understand you're living in a prison
I know you can only see me as a vision
I might fade away with the coming of a new dawn
And your heart is breaking.
What are you gonna do now
That you're tired of faking it?
Well, it's hard to take it
When you know what happens each time
The devil with the green eyes
Said you were never meant to be mine
'Cause I came up from a dark world
And every love I've ever know is dead
If you come close enough to see I am inhuman
I will tell you why you're feeling so uncertain
Every word I say has a way of turning evil in you
And your heart is breaking.
What are you gonna do now
That you're tired of faking it?
Well, it's hard to take it
When you know what happens each time
The devil with the green eyes
Said you were never meant to be mine
'Cause I came up from a dark world
And every love I've ever know is dead
And your heart is breaking
What are you gonna do now
That you're tired of faking it?
Well, it's hard to take it
When you know what happens each time
The devil with the green eyes
Said you were never meant to be mine
'Cause I came up from a dark world
And every love I've ever known
Every love I've ever known
Every love I've ever know is dead
