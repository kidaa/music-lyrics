I haven't been a good friend
For a long long time
You know I wasn't happy
Behind the smile
Anywhere you look
A reason to believe
But I think of what it took 
To bring me to my proper place
And I haven't been a good friend
For a long long time
I haven't been a good friend
While you've been mine
Now am I by your side
Or standing in your way
'Cause if this is a sign
I don't know what it's sposed to mean
And I haven't been a good friend
For a long long time
I haven't been a good friend
While you've been mine
I have seen my perfect day
I have watched it fade away
You know I'm fighting to be real
I haven't been a good friend
For a long long time
You know I haven't been happy
Behind the smile
