Ever since I first ran ahead
I've been living in the past
Only wanting what might last
And up until today disappeared
Though I saw it wasn't clear
I could not admit the love I trusted in
love I trusted
Couldn't hold the love I trusted in
love I trusted
Let her fly
And even if I'm walking down that road tomorrow
I will still be waiting around
For the girl who tied me down
For the face that lost me found
Wishing to the shot in the dark
By the touch and words I like
In her precious smile
The love I trusted in
love I trusted
Couldn't hold the love I trusted in
love I trusted
Let it fly
And even if I'm walking down that road tomorrow
I will still be waiting around
For the face that lost me found
For the voice that brought me *down/bound
Ever since I first ran ahead
I've been living in the past
Only wanting what might last
And up until today disappeared
Though I saw it wasn't clear
I could not admit the love I trusted in
love I trusted
Couldn't hold the love I trusted in
love I trusted
Let her fly
And even if I'm walking down that road tomorrow
I will still be waiting
the love I trusted in
love I trusted
Couldn't hold the love I trusted in
love I trusted
Let her fly
And even if I'm walking....
