Do you realize you're laughing while you're reaching for the gin
Even though I threaten that I'm never coming back again
The sweetest song you sing will never calm my fear
'Cause once the alcohol is talking, you're not even here
Look into my eyes and tell me I have been the only one
And that you put a limit on the things that you might do for fun
I tell myself there's nothing I should really fear
It's just the alcohol that's talking, you're not even here
That's right
Yes I figured out, hey you, that time is never gonna change
You say you get your life in order but you only rearrange
To say I'm disappointed, it isn't really fair
It's just the alcohol that's talking, I don't even care
It's just the alcohol that's talking, you're not even here
That's right
That's all
