She's just your size
She's sexy she's beautiful
Does she talk?
She's just your size
She's sexy she's beautiful
Does she talk?
'Cause man you can't teach
A slithering snake how to walk
Did she lick your palm
To tell you your fortune tonight?
Did she lick your palm
To tell you your fortune tonight?
You know sometimes it just isn't worth
Putting up a fight, is it?
Gonna need you a key
To open the door to her heart
Gonna need you a key
To open the door to her heart
Or are you afraid her body is
Missing that part?
Well I can *** you up the ***
You can *** me up the ***
Alright
Well I can *** you up the ***
You can *** me up the ***
Alright
Because they took channel 23
Off the air last night
Down home
You're gonna like it
You're gonna like it...
