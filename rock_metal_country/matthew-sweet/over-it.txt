You're over it
You're not angry anymore because
You're over it
No big deal unless you make it one
You don't even have to fake it now
You're over it, You're over it
And in a way
You should never have to feel
You didn't get your say
If you're looking all around you
And there's nothing that's profound
You know you're over it
I won't ask you what you think of me
'Cause I'm exactly who I want to be
Not like me
You're over it
I won't ask you what you think of me
'Cause I'm exactly who I want to be
Not like me
You're over it
You're not angry anymore because
You're over it
You can go back to being normal
'Cause I guess that makes it formal now
You're over it, you're over it, you're over it now
