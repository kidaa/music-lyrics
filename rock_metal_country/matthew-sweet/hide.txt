Now you'll have to be
Hurt when you think of me
With vision but you can't see far
You hide every thing you can
But the world keeps breaking through
Anywhere you run
And it always will
Before I knew I had you you were gone
Fake too close to the truth
Break when I look at you
And feel how I never knew why
I hide every thing I can
But the world keeps breaking through
Anywhere I run
And it always will
Before I knew I had you you were gone
Fake too close to the truth
Break when I look at you oh
You hide everything you can
But the world keeps breaking through
Anywhere you run
And it always will
Before I knew I had you
You were gone
