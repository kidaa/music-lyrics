You in brown checked suit
said my dress was very cute
I found you found me
dancing in this melody
Heavenly!

We were swinging on so nice
bubbly pink champagne on ice
Nancy, Jacques Closeau and Claire
I believe they all were there
Having the time of their livesYou had Rose's lime
mixed with vodka, I had wine
People having fun
cocktails in the evening sun
Give me one!

We were swinging on so nice
bubbly pink champagne on ice
Nancy, Jacques Closeau and Claire
I believe they all were there
Having the time of their lives

La la la do de do de do
