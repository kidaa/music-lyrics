There's a monster growing in our heads
raised up on the wicked things we've said
a great divide between us now
something we should know

There's something to remember
and something to forget
as long as we remember
there's something to regret
something we should knowThere's a mountain higher than we knew
it's high but such a bitter view
a great divide between us now
something we should know

A great divide between us now
on different sides of a great divide
