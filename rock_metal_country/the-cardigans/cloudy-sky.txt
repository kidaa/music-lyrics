I'd catch some stars for you
and just for you
I'd paint the grey sky blue
and just for you
so don't tell me you want the rain
from a cloudy sky
to wash away the pain
that I've given you again
I've always tried to find
what satisfies your mind
but I will never know
where you are to go
but I want you to know
do you want a golden ring
I would buy you anything.I'd read some poems for you
just for you
I hope they won't make you blue
like they used to do
so please tell me they're like the rain
from this cloudy sky
