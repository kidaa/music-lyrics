he's lonely
sitting by the mirror
awakened by the horses
in circles
running in the circus

his red nose
looking damaged in the mirror
cause no one has replaced it
he's dressed now
ready to make fun of... 

he loves sundays
and every place
where his circus stays 

he's lonely
he's sitting by the mirror
still broken
undressed now
ready for a new town 

he loves sundays
and every place
where his circus stays 

they love his show
thir favourite part
that gives them a laugh
they love his show
their favourite part
relaxes their hearts 

he loves sundays
and every place
where his circus stays
