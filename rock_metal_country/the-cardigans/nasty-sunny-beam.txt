i can't get out of bed
can't get my dreams out
of my sleepy head 

i open up my eyes
and wonder where you are
but soon i realise
that you're not real
and i am 

in between of day and dream
life and death, a lazy stream
in between of day and dream
hello, goodbye
you nasty sunny beam 

i try to seal my mind
and get back to where you were
you were that perfect kind
you drove me crazy
somewhere 

in between of day and dream
life and death, a lazy stream
in between of day and dream
hello, goodbye
you nasty sunny beam 

i'm floating down again
and my world is a syrup waterfall
i can't remember when
or where
or why 

in between of day and dream
life and death, a lazy stream
in between of day and dream
hello, goodbye
you nasty sunny beam
