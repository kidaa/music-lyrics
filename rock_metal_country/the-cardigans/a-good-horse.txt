It takes no match to give me a spark
Now I'm trying out another heart
I've been winding 'bout a fresh start
I've found myself a good horse

Eyes burning on the quicksand
And I run it through the hollow land
I've fed it with a shaky hand
I found myself a strong horse

These are the promises I can keep
These are the promises I can keep
To live like I must 
And ride with the dust in my face
In grace

I've found myself a good horse
Yes I've found myself a strong horse
But things remain not different then before 

These are the promises I can keep
Yes these are the promises I can keep
To live like I must 
And ride with the dust in my face

These are the promises I can keep
These are the promises I can keep
To live like I must 
And ride with the dust in my face
In grace
