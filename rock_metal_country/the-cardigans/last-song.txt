Words/Music: Sveningsson

the night she died in the rented room
as the whole town was sleeping
she held her breath like a star in bloom
could burn down tomorrow

the summer breeze was caressing me
as I walked through the market
the golden light of a friend beside
had died out for goodnow nothing can amaze me
as everything's behind me
no, nothing else can please me
since all I had has been set free

the night before in the dining room
I recall it now
she said ";I fear for you my friend
cause I'll soon be leaving";

the autumn comes just like other years
but I won't see the signs
the sun above's sowing magic seeds
but it wants someone back...
