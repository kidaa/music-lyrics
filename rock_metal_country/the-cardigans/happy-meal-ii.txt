Arrange my books in order
make up some nice stories to amuse you
make things look smart and easy
shape up the place
hungry for the meeting
the dinner we'll be eating
wine that we'll be drinking
and kinky thoughts I'm thinking
all because of youAnd now I've found a partner
no one can be happier than I am
and now I've found a new friend
no one can be happier than me

Prepare a meal with candles
sweet wine and strings
chosen for the purpose
then take a bath with bubbles
shape up my face
eager for the meeting
the dinner we'll be eating
wine that we'll be drinking
and kinky thoughts I'm thinking
all because of you
