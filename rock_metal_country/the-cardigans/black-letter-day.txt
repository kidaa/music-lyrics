I did all that I should, well all that I could
but will I be clean
I did all that I should, well all that I could
but it isn't me

all my strength is dead and gone
slept as long I could, as long as I should
to find comfort here
slept as long I could, as long as I should
but I still have fearall my strength is dead and gone...
black letter day
all the fun / joy / strength
...has gone away

I drank all that I could, much more than I should
in simple despair
I drank all that I could, much more than I should
to find someone there

I hope monday will be a better day
