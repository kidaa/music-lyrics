winter came by my bedroom today
falling in rows and covering the lane
morning shone on my windows today
passing the time I slumber away
to kill all the day

stumbling up at one
and put the kettle on
but wher's the coffee gone
in the afternoon
I put the TV on
but where's the drama gone
in the afternoon
and time is all that passessomeone came by my bedroom today
swaying around, then silently away
someone left home and my bedroom today
left by the time I slumbered away
to kill all the day

some people don't hurry
don't you worry they say
one day I'll be older
so much colder I say
this fear won't appear
if I keep stumbling up at one
