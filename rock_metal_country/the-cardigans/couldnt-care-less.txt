Oh my heart can't carry much more
It's really, really aching and soar
My heart don't care anymore
I really can't bear more
My hands don't work like before
I shiver and I scrape at your door
My heart can't carry much more

But you couldn't care less
Could you
Your face don't look like before
It's really not like yours anymore
Your eyes don't like me no more
They quiver and they shift to the floor
My heart don't beat like before
It's never been this lone
No my blood don't flow anymore

And you couldn't care less
Could you
Could we stop and sleep for a spare
We can turn this stitch into a ware
And send that old devil back to hell
But we don't care do we

Baby let's stop and sleep for a spare
We can turn this stitch into a ware
And send that old devil back to hell
Your back's not straight like before
You really shouldn't care in me no more
I'm much too heavy for you
I'm really quite a mess, yes
We just don't care anymore
We're cricket and were cut to the core
We're just not there anymore
But we really don't care do we
No, we couldn't care less
We couldn't care less
Could we?
