plain parade
well, where is all the profit laid?
plain parade
well, maybe we have lost our way 

some are lone
sickly running from
something so wrong
and nowhere to belong 

plain parade
well, when will i be repaid
plain parade
i might join you on another day 

some are lone
sickly running from
something so wrong
and nowhere to belong 

all you've given me is sadness
proof enough to feel i'm loveless
i wish that i could manage better now
and find a place that i can settle down
