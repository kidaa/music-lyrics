I will never know
cause you will never show
come on and let me know
come on and let me know 

Carnival came by my town today
bright lights from giantwheels
fall on the alleyways
and I'm here
by my door
waiting for youI will never know
cause you will never show
come on and let me know
come on and let me know 

I hear sounds of lovers
barrel organs, mothers
I would like to take you
down there
just to make you mine
in a merry-go-round
