We took off that sunny day
packed our things and went away
me and friends in daddy's car
to find out how summers are
found a card to send from wherever we wentFrom Luxembourg to Rome
from Berlin to the moon
from Paris to Lausanne
from Athens to the sun
our car became a spacecraft
flashing through the world
crashed down in Amsterdam
We'll take off some rainy day
pack our things and go away
families and hotelbars
to find out how summers are
find a card to send to some really old friends

From Luxembourg to Rome
from Berlin to the moon
from Paris to Lausanne
from Athens to the sun
our car became a spacecraft
flashing through the world
crashed down in Amsterdam
