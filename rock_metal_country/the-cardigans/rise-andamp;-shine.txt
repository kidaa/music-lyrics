I want to be alone for a while
I want earth to breathe to me
I want the waves to grow loud
I want the sun to bleed down

see the waves go down
see the moon alone
see the world unshown
I raise my hesd and whisperrise and shine
rise and shine my sister

I want to see the wounded moon
I want the sea to break through
I want it all to be gone tomorrow
so I've come to say goodbye...
