You're losing a friend
You got it all wrong
I'ts not about revenge
But you're losing a friend
I didn't see it coming
With my head stuck in the sand
But now I'm loosing a friend
And it's keeping me up
It's the ribbons I tied
I would rather just die
Go to hell and crawl back
Than let you go
You're losing a friend
You jeopardise me
Bad bad blood on your hands
And see, you're losing a friend
I'm fickle and I'm vain
And you trick me over and over again
And now I'm losing you
And it's killing me
It's the strings that I tie
I would rather just die
Go to hell and crawl back
Then let it all go
My mistake
To lose you
Oh no, oh no!
So this the end now
I'm losing you
Oh, look at you!
Look what you're wasting
You're losing a friend
Oh no, oh no!
I'm losing a friend
Oh, oh oh no
