Lyrics by Persson
This is where your sanity gives in
and love begins
Never lose your grip
don't trip
don't fall
you'll lose it all
The sweetest way to die
It lies deep inside
you can not hide
it's the meanest fire
Oh, it's a strange desire
you can not lie
that's a needless fight
This is where your sanity gives in
and love begins
Never lose your grip
don't trip
don't fall
you'll lose it all
The sweetest way to die
When your blood runs dry
you're paralyzed
it will eat your mind
Did you hold it back
It comes to you in slow attacks
