when the cats & dogs are falling
i'm recalling you
you said i'd be bored today
and i don't know what i want to do

wise eyes telling twice
dance like penguins on my table
ain't my kind of joy
on every friday night 

i'm just wistling on a song...
songs we wrote together 

when my world is far too evil
i'm recalling you
things are hard to understand
there's little that i really know 

wise eyes telling twice
dance like penguins on my table
ain't my kind of joy
on every friday night 

i'm just wistling on a song...
songs we wrote together
