after all you were perfectly right
but I'm scaring close to insanity
and on a night like this
nothing stays the same
nothing looks the same

after all you were perfectly right
though our relation just split me in two
and on a night like this
pieces fall apart
visions fall apartafter all you were perfectly right
I have never been happy before
and on a night like this
you can hear the words
see behind the words

after all you were perfectly wrong
though I thought I'd found love
and on a night like this
nothing could be worse
nothing could be worse
