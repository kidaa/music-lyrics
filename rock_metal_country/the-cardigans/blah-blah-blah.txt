hi, how are you i'm pretty fine
your eyes are red, well i am tired
please stay away from what is mine
blah blah blah blah blah blah 

my, i never thought of seeing you here
i'm really glad to meet you darling
where did we lose it, will you call? 

all we ever say
is blah blah blah blah blah
we feel safe
with blah blah blah blah blah 

no one's hurt
no one's weird
so all we ever say
is blah blah blah blah blah 

don't try to reach me, i am numb
and i don't want to look inside you
so let's just talk about the times
like normal people do!
