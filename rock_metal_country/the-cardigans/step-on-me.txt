Oh, I think you're standing
on my left foot
it's hurting, but that's OK
cause I'm in your way

You'll break that foot that
you're standing on
I'll walk with the other one

Do what you want to do what you want to
be what you want to be what you want to
go on and step on meYou're free to have everything
you can see, all that you want to be
do what you want with me

Oh, I think you're spinning
inside my head
I think of you all the day
cause you're in my way

Oh, I think you're holding
the heart of mine
squeeze it apart, that's fine
go ahead and step on me
