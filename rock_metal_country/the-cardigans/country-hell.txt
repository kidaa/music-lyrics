such a foolish thing
what a way to be
i couldn't stay in here
and it's not right to leave
i couldn't tell you how
but all the things i feel
have their qualities

if you fall apart
fall into my arms
one uneasy morning
doesn't make me leave 

such a simple thing
what a way to say
i couldn't help myself
for my foolish ways
you couldn't tell me how
but all the things you feel
have their qualities
