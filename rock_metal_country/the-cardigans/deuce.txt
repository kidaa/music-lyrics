I am afraid of you now
Now that you left me
Nothing I can say
No not now
Now that you left me

Now that you left me
Now that you left me

Just for how long
Did you know before you left me?
Nothing to do
It's up to you
Use it against me

Use it against me
Now that you left me

You are ahead of me now
Because you left me
Words that I said
All yours now
Use it against me

You have erased me
Now that you left me

I'll be gone
I'll be gone

I'll be gone
I'll be gone

I'll be gone
I'll be gone

I'll be gone
I'll be gone
