Upon a roof below the moon
nearby a park-bench in the sun
upon the stairway to your room
Why won't you wrap your life around
those certain words I just found

I wear your golden ring inside
suits me very fine
I wear your golden heart in mine
suits me very fineA backseat sofa in the dark
upon a viewpoint in our town
nearby a fountain in a park
Why won't you wrap your life around
those certain words I just found

I wear your golden ring inside
suits me very fine
I wear your golden heart in mine
suits me very fine
I wear your golden heart in mine
and life is very fine
