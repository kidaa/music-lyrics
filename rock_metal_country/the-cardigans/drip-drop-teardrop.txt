I'm gonna watch you
while you get me wrong
I'm gonna sing
to you hate this song

I'm gonna tell you
In my sweetest voice
I'm gonna choose you
'cause you have no choice

It's funny thing we got
It's never gonna stop. Oh no!

I'm gonna take you
to the wilderness
I'm gonna show you
things you might have missed
I'm gonna kiss the parts
that you have lost
Is not a course
You're burning my hair legs no estoy seguro de esta ultima parte

It's funny thing we got
It's never gonna stop
until we drip drop tear drop

I'm gonna work
til we get it on
I'm gonna love you
till we get alone
and when the rivers in your eyes are sored
I'm gonna love you just a little bit more

It's funny thing we got
It's never gonna stop
until we drip drop tear drop
