Smooth dreams in leaves
raised in teacup
Sticked down to sleep
like an envelope
filled up with words for you

Wrapped up in curls
sweet as the summer
cheek soft as a fur
grace in a slumber
beautiful wonderboySoft beams from an early sun
on my truly beautiful one
shimmer from a Saturday sun
on my truly beautiful one

rise in the morning
shine 'til the dawning

Stretched out to breathe
down from the rooftops
sticked down to sleep
like an envelope
filled up with words for you
