You hold your broken heart out
And you say it just won't stop hurting
Like there's something I can do

The rule is so plain
Party girl play like it's laying
Pack it up-hear what I'm saying
The party's over-better walk away

Turn the page-look, and listen
Somewhere music plays
Planes leave every day
Big girls walk awayYou want to play with princes
On a million dollar holiday
But you never met their mothers

You just go so high
Party girl just keep the earrings
Nothing else is worth a damned thing
Just save the party for another day

You know this old world is wide
And you're to catch another ride
You just go till you come out the other side
