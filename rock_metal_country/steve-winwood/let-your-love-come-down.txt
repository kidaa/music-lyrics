Some say I know, others say I don't
That's alright now
What I'm saying every day is that love will find a way
That's no lie now
When the road's getting tough and you think you've had enough
Don't give up now
Show the world how you feel, gonna let them know you're real
Don't be shy now

Let your love come down
Let it flow now
Just let it flow now, baby, yeah
Let your love come down
Come on and show me now
Don't hold it back now
Oh girl, you got to
Let your love come down
Let your love come down
Let it all go now
Let your love come down, baby
Let your love come down

Make sure that you're true in everything you do
Don't you fake it
And when you're caught in the heat and you think it's got you beat
You can take it
You got time on your side and this door is open wide
You can make it oh yes we can
It was there from the start, got the power in your heart
Don't forsake it

Give your heart, darling, every day
Wear your love now, baby, don't hide away
Roll it over, don't delay
Let's start a new day
