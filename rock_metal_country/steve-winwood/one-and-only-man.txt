Every time I see you, girl, it makes me feel so sad
Knowing you've been seeing some other guy that treats you bad
Did you know I'm burning deep inside for you?
Just give me the chance now and we can see it through
If you'll be my woman, I'll be your one and only man

Gonna take you with me far away from hearts of stone
We'll live in the country and raise some children of our own
I will be your lover, I will be your friend
I'll give you my loving, on that you can depend
If you'll be my woman, I'll be your one and only man

And there'll be no more crying, I'll make your dreams come true
You know I'll never turn my back on you

Take you to the city, girl, we're gonna buy some clothes
Dress you up so pretty and then we'll take in all the shows
Find a place that's jumping, where the music's tight
And we'll keep on dancing 'til the morning light
If you'll be my woman, I'll be your one and only man, oh yeah

If you'll be my woman, I'll be your man
Know I'm gonna give you everything I can
If you'll be my woman, I'll be your man, 
There'll be no more running, gonna make a stand
