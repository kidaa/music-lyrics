Chorus:
Now you're back into my life again
Yeah, you're back into my life again
Yeah, you're back into my life again
And I'm so glad, Cos baby I'm so glad

Repeat

How could my love have been so blind
While I was searching for some piece of mind 
I lost the finest girl I ever found 
Baby, I need you with me all the time
You went away, away from my side
Now you're back and now I'm satisfied

Chorus

I'm so excited, I'm so excited, I'm so excited, I'm so excited, 
I could cry

Chorus

Chorus
