Hear the night music playing? Don't you know what it's saying?
We should feel it together forever
Feel the beat and just hold on to the sweet midnight flowing
Feel the music inside you, I'll be there too
Now's the time that our dreams are finally coming true
Feels so good we're crying
Now's the time when it's down to me and you
Spread these wings - we'll be flying

Don't you know what the night can do?
Don't you know when it's touching you?
Don't you know what the night can do?

Time to show all your feeling, all the night is revealing
Let the rhythm enfold you, let me hold you
And we turn into music, now we never will lose it
When the rhythm and night ride, no heart can hide
There are times that never ever come again, memories there for making
When the night comes, we better let it in, all this love for the taking

Don't you know what the night can do?
Don't you know when it's touching you?
Won't you help me to let it through? 
Don't you know what the night can do?
