Some people get lonely, while some people get blue
But nobody can tell you just what you should do
Somebody is laughing while somebody is crying
While one child is born, there's somebody dying

You hold the key in the palm of your hand, my love
And it seems to me
There ain't no [special crime? sense in crying?] in heaven above

There's something about you, I don't know what you got
But you and me girl, we're gonna give it a shot
Feel my luck's in,
I feel like I'm flying
I don't want to see nobody crying

If you saw my love
Then you'd know what I mean
She's the only one
That makes this world like a dream

I think it's amazing just what you can do
When somebody wants you, and their love is true
Hot love is a fire, and you can get burned
I once was [?], now my luck's turned

Luck's In
