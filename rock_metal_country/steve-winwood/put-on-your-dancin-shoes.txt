So much going on out there, leaves us hanging in the air
And it's all that we can do to face each day and see it though
Life's a dance, put on your dancing shoes, take a chance

You can't shut your eyes to pain, faces crying in the rain
You can't keep it all inside, you need some way to let it ride
Life's a dance, put on your dancing shoes, take a chance

When you're all over, when you know you've done all that you can do
Put on your dancing shoes, it'll see you through

Voices shouting in the street, life lived to a ragged beat
Someone's world is tumbling down, and who's the saint and where's the clown?
Life's a dance, put on your dancing shoes, take a chance

When you're all over, when you know you've done all that you can do
Put on your dancing shoes, it'll see you through
When time is flying, when you know there's no end to these modern blues
Put on your dancing shoes, it'll see you through
