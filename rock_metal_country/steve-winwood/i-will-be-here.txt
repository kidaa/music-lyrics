Cry, you would cry in my arms
Far, far from the world and its harms
That kind of love begun is never done
I'll be here at close of day
When you bring your heart home to stay

I will be here when you call
I will be here standing tall
I will be here, you won't fall
Don't you know that love will save us after all?

Come - when cold winter blows
Come - when sweet summer glows
And all your wandering years will disappear
There are places inside the heart
We'll touch like we've done from the start

Almighty time rolls on, let's not spend it all alone
We are here, then we're gone
