You've been searching high and low, still so far to go
You've been searching everywhere, I know you care
Walking down the endless street, what will you meet?
Who knows, who knows?

You'll keep on searching till the very end
For one true lover and for one true friend
You'll get your answer on the whispering wind
When you find it, just don't let go

Laughed with saints and cried with clowns, lived that up and down
Walked out in the pouring rain to stop your pain
Cried out on a mountain high, why life goes by?
Why love can die, oh why?
