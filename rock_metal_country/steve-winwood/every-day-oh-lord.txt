I can feel the music deep down inside of me
When I see the new day rising, h it sets me free
Like a melody coming, what will it be?
I love life again though I don't know how this day will finally end
Each day is music - reach till I find the song
Every day I keep on singing

Every day, every day, every day, oh lord
Every day, every day, every day, oh lord
And my soul is still strong, every day I sing my song

What a world of trouble we are all asked to bear
But we have to keep on living, find our strength somewhere
And I choose to keep on hoping, faith is still there
There are mysteries unbound, there is truth we've lost and found
The song lines are there, they will bring us back around
Deep in the heart they play, every day
Love life again, though you don't know how this day will finally end
Each day is music - reach till you find the song
Every day just keep on singing

Reaching for the stars, for the song of us all
Looking through the lonely night for a faith that will not fall for morning
Glad I'm here when morning comes, here when morning comes
One more day to keep on singing
