US version:

Well, my temperature's rising and my feet hit the floor
Twenty people knocking 'cause they're wanting some more
Let me in, baby, I don't know what you've got
But you'd better take it easy, 'cause this place is hot

Chorus

So glad we made it, so glad we made it
You got to gimme some lovin', gimme some lovin'
Gimme some lovin' every day

Well, I feel so good, everything is sounding hot
Better take it easy, 'cause the place is on fire
Been a hard day and I don't know what to do
Wait a minute, baby, it could happen to you

Chorus

Well, I feel so good, everybody's getting higher
Better take it easy, 'cause the place is on fire
Been a hard day, nothing went too good
Now I'm gonna relax, honey, everybody should

Chorus
