It's a family affair ....

One child grows up to be somebody that just loves to learn
And another child grows up to be someone who needs concern
Mother loves both of them, you see it's in the blood
Father loves both of them, blood's thicker than the mud

It's a family affair ....

Newly-wed a year ago, still checkin' each other out
Nobody wants to blow, nobody wants to be left out
You can't leave cos your heart is there
But you can't stay cos you been somewhere else
You can't cry cos you look broke down
But you cry anyway cos you're all broke down

It's a family affair ...

Na na na one family, na na na one love ...
