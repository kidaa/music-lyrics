Come out and dance with me, darling, on that funky side of town
Come out and rock with me, baby, shake it up and dance it down
When you hear that good band play, it'll make you want to fool around
You can't sit down

I've got some moves for you, baby, that I learned from way back when
I've got a feel for you, baby, you'll believe in love again
When I knock on you door, you'll let me in
In love again

We go round and round, don't know where we're bound
Long as there's a beat I'll hang around, for one more round

Now baby, don't read the papers, 'cause they always make you sad
And honey, don't watch the TV 'cause the news is always bad
Come and dance with me tonight and you know your heart will be so glad
So very glad

Baby, don't you know the reason grandma smiles at grandpa so?
Grandpa can still keep it moving like he did so long ago
Grandma says, ";Hold me tight and don't let go";
Like years ago

Baby this is true romance, take it while you see a chance
If we got everyone dancing, wouldn't be no time for war
If they got into the feeling, they'd find out what life is for
Every day you'd hear them say, ";This has got to be what life is for";
And dance some more
