Used to live in the danger zone, any day it could get too rough
Now I'm glad I kept holding on, now I'm glad I had soul enough
You turned night into day and showed me how my soul could sing
You took my hurt away and showed me love conquers anything
When two hearts both feel the same, there's a way to beat the game

Holding on, now I'm standing in the light
Holding on, and this time I've got it right
Holding on, every day and every night
Holding on.

Fall asleep in your lover's arms and it's just like it ought to be
Just be thankful she keeps you warm in a world where there's nothing free
Give her love every day and pay attention when she dreams
And she'll be good to you 'cause sometimes love is just what it seems
When two hearts both feel the same, there's a way to beat the game

See the mountain water running down into streams
How it holds on forever, we'll be holding on forever

People soul-searching all night long for a reason to help them live
And I do hope they hear this song, get through take and you get to give
It can be in a smile, it can be there in a touch
It warms the world awhile, when it's love it can't be too much
