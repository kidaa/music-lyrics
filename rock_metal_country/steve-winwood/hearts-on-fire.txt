Night was falling and my chances were low
Nothing was happening, I was ready to go
Then I saw her walking through that door
And I knew right then I had to get me some more

Moved up close, up next to the bar
There she sat, lookin' like a movie star
Went up and asked her, 'Do you mind if I sit?'
She said, 'No, but if you see a chance, you'd better take it.'
Just the two of us sat talking together
The music and people all drifting away

Hearts on fire, burning with love
We were written in the stars above
Take us higher to the things that we know
There's no other place we can go

Told her everything that happened to me
A thousand limousines and the women for free
She said, 'That's when these words'll ring true -
You ain't nobody 'till somebody loves you.'
Love came to me the minute I saw her
I wanted to make her part of my life

Just the two of us sat talking together
I wanted to make her part of my life
