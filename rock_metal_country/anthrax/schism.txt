Don't look at me as a white man
I'm just a man
Don't look at me as a black man
I'm just a man
It takes a man to deal with ignorance
Prove that you can
Like having to climb a barbwire fence
Can ya tell me how it feels to be hated?
Can ya tell me how it feels to be loved?
Can you show me what it   means to be respected?
Or is the answer none of the above?
It's so easy to hate your brother
It should be hard
It's so easy to hate your friends
Why ain't it hard?
Love and hate come in the deck together
Play you card
Love or hate can rule your life forever
Can ya tell me how it feels to be hated?
Can ya tell me how it feels to be loved?
Can you show me what it  means to be respected?
Or is the answer none of the above?
Hating, fighting, lying, and I can't take...
Bitching, screwing, crying, and I just hate...
Taking, cheating, spying, and I can't take...
Hating, fighting, dissing, fighting, fighting,
Fighting...
And I can't take no...
SCHISM!
Schism, SK, SK, SK, SCHISM
A house divided can't stand
Prejudice is un-natural thought
When we were kids
It's not inherited, it's taught
When we were kids
If we were blind and had no choice
Differences hid
Would we hate each other by the tone of our voice?
Can ya tell me how it feels to be hated?
Can ya tell me how it feels to be loved?
Can you show me what it  means to be respected?
Or is the answer none of the above?
Hating, fighting, lying, and I can't take...
Bitching, screwing, crying, and I just hate...
Taking, cheating, spying, and I can't take...
Hating, fighting, dissing, fighting, fighting,
Fighting...
And I can't take no...
SCHISM!
CHORUS
