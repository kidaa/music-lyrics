Like the screaming eagle
I'm on the run
I blaze through the sky
I kill for the fun
No reason, no warning
Nor shadow be found
Got you in my sights
And I'll shoot you down
Jet fighter, jet fighter
Turbo jet engines ignite
Jet fighter, jet fighter
Death will filling the sky
Jet fighter, jet fighter
An airborne assault and attack
Jet fighter, jet fighter
A cold blooded stab in the back
Vengeance is calling on you
And there's nothing that you can do
Brings you the thing you deserve
Death from above!
