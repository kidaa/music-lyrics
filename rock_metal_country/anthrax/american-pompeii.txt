I try to imagine the best place I've been
Can I go back again ?
Open my eyes, what was no longer exists,
I can't go back again
I like to pretend that nothing has changed
And never went too far
But it started to lose me like a four-hour movie
I'd already seen
Holding onto my memory of what this used to be
Holding onto my memory of you
Sometimes I tell myself that things are O.K.
Another lie but it makes me feel better
Never as old as I was today
I'm gonna breakdown
In American Pompeii
In American Pompeii
Break myself just to live this way
Never as old, as I was today
American Pompeii
Look in my eyes and see how sick I feel
About what you've become
Filthy and twisted like you never existed
I know what you were
Your beauty forgotten under mountains of schism
I don't want to climb
Giving up my memory of what this used to be
Giving up my memory of you
Sometimes I tell myself that things are O.K.
Another lie but it makes me feel better
Never as old as I was today
I'm gonna breakdown
In American Pompeii
In American Pompeii
Break myself just to live this way
Never as old, as I was today
American Pompeii
Try to imagine the best place I've been
Can I go back again
Open my eyes it just no longer exists
I can't go back again
I'm giving up my memory of what this used to be
Giving up my memory of you
