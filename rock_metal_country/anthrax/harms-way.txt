Here comes the biggest asshole
That the whole world has ever seen
Watch as things turn to something
I never meant to be
Call it a side effect of my arrested development
Here with you I'm trapped, out of my element
I tear through all this wreckage
You left when you dropped the bomb
Is there something worth saving
Or do I act like nothing's wrong
The lesser of two equals gives me nothing at all
Lust and madness murder and mayhem
My whole life's been about playing
It's so surreal
Maybe that's why I touch but can't feel
Sittin' pretty as I sit up straight
Trying to find means to an end
I move into harms way
I see my face in the mirror
I feel my feet but I can't seem to walk in my shoes
When it hurts I feel closer to you
Closer than you ever knew
And the bottom line is knowing
I will die and the worms will eat me
The bottom line is knowing
Ain't no one else I can be
