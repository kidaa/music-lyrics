In dreams I can rule your life
With me nothing's ever right
Sing for me up on a stage
Keep your mind trapped in a cage
I'm your man I'm what you need
Dance with me but never lead
One deep breath will set me free
Don't you fuckin' look at me
You know that I am...
One fuckin' well dressed man!
Now it's dark, but I can see
Don't you fuckin' look at me
Now it's dark, your gonna be
Exactly what I want to see
Now it's dark, Mommy
Don't you fuckin' look at me
A sensation
Of elation
Intoxication
Now it's dark
A candy coated existence
Underneath is decadence
What was hidden you have found
Made it your own battleground
Pretty, pretty don't say please
Don't you fuckin' look at me
You know that I am...
One fuckin' well dressed man!
Now it's dark, but I can see
Don't you fuckin' look at me
Now it's dark, your gonna be
Exactly what I want to see
Now it's dark, Mommy
Don't you fuckin' look at me
A sensation
Of elation
Intoxication
Now it's dark
I'll send you a love letter
Straight from the bottom of my heart
You'll be fucked forever
The candy coated clown's done his part
I'm your man I'm what you need
Dance with me but never lead
One deep breath will set me free
Don't you fuckin' look at me
You know that I am...
One fuckin' well dressed man!
CHORUS
