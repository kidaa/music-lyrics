Move it to the front
Reaching for the light
Loosing all control
Using all your might
Wheels are gonna spin
Asses gonna shake
We are gonna kick
Walls are gonna break
The road is hard
The fight is tough
Gonna play it fast
She likes it rough
With my strength
With all my soul
Makin' love
I'm losing control
Guts begin to churn
Minds are in haze
Hell is gonna burn
Axes in a blaze
Go in for the kill
Always on the run
Fighting for you life
The battles never won
Move it to the front
Reaching for the light
Losing all control
Using all your might
Wheels are gonna spin
Asses gonna shake
We are gonna kick
Walls are gonna break
Backs are turned
Rock and roll
To the wall
I'm losing my mind
Yeah!
Hey, hey!
