Anthrax
I wait, I hate
Silence kills you like a loaded gun
My time, you waste
Resolution turn your back and run
Drunk with power
Your ivory tower
Never stood, never could
And around and around
You hit the ground
Reservation hellbound
Most people cry
When a person dies
You wanna know why?
Run it through,
Discharge!
Most people cry
Not when you die
You wanna know why?
Run it through,
Discharge!
Nobody cried
You lived a lie
You lived a lie!
Run it through,
Discharge!
Most people cry
When a person dies
You wanna know why?
Run it through,
Discharge!
Your life, what life?
What's the difference between you and death?
Overdose, comatose
You won't even leave a corpse that's fresh
Drunk with power
Go take a shower
I wish you would, I wish you could
And around and around
You hit the ground
Reservation hellbound
A surreal vision
Of a human being
Most people cry
When a person dies
You wanna know why?
Run it through,
Discharge!
Most people cry
Not when you die
You wanna know why?
Run it through,
Discharge!
Nobody cried
You lived a lie
You lived a lie!
Run it through,
Discharge!
Most people cry
When a person dies
You wanna know why?
Run it through,
Discharge!
Self inflicted crucifixion
Suicidal contradiction
Clusterfucked you load it up
Clusterfucked you self destruct
Get off my dick, it's sick
I refuse to feel sorry for you
I can't, believe
People put you on a pedestal
Drunk with power
Your ivory tower
Never stood, never could
And around and around
You hit the ground
Reservation hellbound
A surreal vision
Of a human being
Most people cry
When a person dies
You wanna know why?
Run it through,
Discharge!
Most people cry
Not when you die
You wanna know why?
Run it through,
Discharge!
Nobody cried
You lived a lie
You lived a lie!
Run it through,
Discharge!
Most people cry
When a person dies
You wanna know why?
Run it through,
