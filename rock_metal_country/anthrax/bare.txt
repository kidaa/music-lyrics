Standing on some dotted line
Reacting to the hands of time
A circumstance that I've been fed
Leaving questions in my head
Find the space that was left bare
An empty space I'd gladly share
One must live while one must die
Combined paired up for so many years
Unsure if I really want to shed a tear
Signing off is always so clearly done
A number 2 is now reduced to one
Find the space that was left bare
An empty space I'd gladly share
When your clock is up
And you rest for good
I will cut off my armpiece
Just like we agreed we would
One must live while one must die
While the other argues that
The world ain't fair
But then who ever promised
Anybody equal share
You might as well forget
What you gambled on
'Cause plans never go by the way they're drawn
When your clock is up
And you rest for good
I will cut off my armpiece
Just like we agreed we would
One must live while one must die
I can't say good-bye
It's all I can do to get up every morning
And when all else fails I try
To face myself and everything else
But mostly I wonder why
