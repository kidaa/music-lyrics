You should be happy
You should be really happy
I saved your life today
I didn't kill you, although I meant to
Now go and put your toys away
It's the pecking order, back of the line
Climb up tot he top jump off and take a nose dive
Another societal break down
What did you just say,
You said some thing, some thing that I already said
I smell like both of us, you smell like both of us
Revel in our sated lust
Open your eyes and watch me bust
Ride up to the top, jump off and do a face plant
And I don't need it around, I'm the king of the town
What did you do to me
I gotta get another hit off your energy
I'm cruising in neutral, you came into my life
And bam, kicked it up a big notch
I dropped in from the top
