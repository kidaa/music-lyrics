I want to be part of the program
I want to be part of the whole damn thing
I say, minimum effort, maximum gain
From the inside out it all looks the same
Making me feel stronger
Making me feel like The Hulk I'll be
King Size
Here it is,
I'll stake my claim and I'll be first to warn you
Here it is,
I think the devil lives in California
Check out the freak I'm laughing
Excuse me are you talking to me ?
I say, minimum effort, maximum gain
From the inside out it all looks the same
Making me feel harder
Making me feel like The Hulk I'll be
King Size
Here it is,
I'll stake my claim and I'll be first to warn you
Here it is,
I think the devil lives in California
I'm on a mission, I'm on a mission
For my survival, my king size position
I'm on a mission, in my condition
Outside my world I know there's
No place like home
I'm on a mission, my king size position
Outside my world I know there's
No place like home
I can't stop my life from crashing
Out of control, I'm out of control
Nothing to fear but fear itself and me
I, I'd never sell my soul
I never did a goddamn thing cause
I'd never sell my soul for something that's free
Minimum effort, maximum gain
From the inside out it all looks the same
Nothing to fear but fear itself and,
Nothing to fear but fear itself and,
Check out the freak and I'm still laughing
Nothing to fear but fear itself and me
Here it is,
I'll stake my claim and I'll be first to warn you
Here it is,
I think the devil lives in California
