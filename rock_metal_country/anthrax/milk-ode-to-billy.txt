Milano, Benante, Lilker, Rosenfeld
I woke up, can't wait to eat
Got my cereal, boy I was beat
Opened the fridge, and to my dismay
There was no milk, my mother will pay
I want some milk!
My coffee grows cold
I want some milk!
I shouldn't been told
I wish I had some goddamn milk
My cheerios just ain't the same
I wish I had some goddamn milk
Too bad the milkman never came
I can't go out to the store
I'll just wait 'till Mommy buys more
I'll just have wheat things and beer
If I get sick the toilet is near
I want some milk!
My coffee grows cold
I want some milk!
I shouldn't been told
I wish I had some goddamn milk
My cheerios just ain't the same
I wish I had some goddamn milk
Too bad the milkman never came
I want some milk!
My coffee grows cold
I want some milk!
I shouldn't been told
