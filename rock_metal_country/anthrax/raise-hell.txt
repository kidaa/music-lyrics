I'm running
I'm trying to break away
It's getting heavy
There's no way I can stay
I'm going under
It's burning up my mind
Release the feeling
I'm running out of time
Raise hell, raise hell, raise hell
I'm on fire raise hell, raise hell, raise hell
Can't hold back desire
Only desire
I'm on the outside
Always looking in
You know the heats on
Ready to begin
And when I'm inside
You stare into my eyes
When it's over
You see through my disguise
Raise hell, raise hell, raise hell
I'm on fire raise hell, raise hell, raise hell
Can't hold back desire
Only desire
Raise hell, raise hell, raise hell, raise hell
Raise hell, raise hell, raise hell
Can't hold back desire
Only desire
Raise hell
