Anthrax
We fell in love at first sight
I can't explain the feelings
When I first saw you we were so happy
A life of love sweet honey child
But then I played the fool
I never meant to hurt you
Or sleep with you friends
We reconciled we found ourselves
Our love was meant to be
Oh, baby can't you see
You left me standing in the mud
Crying to myself
A heart so full of pain
But we fell in love again
This time forever
True love prevails over all
She got hit by a truck
