C.Ridenhour, H.Shocklee, E.Sadler, ANTHRAX
Bass! How long can you go?
Death row, what a brother knows
Once again back is the incredible
The rhyme animal
The incredible D, public enemy, number 1
"Five-O" said, "Freeze!" and I got numb
Can I tell 'em
That I really never had a gun
But it's the wax
That the terminator X spun
Now they got me in cell
Cause a brother like me said
"Well Farrakhan's prophet and I think
you ought to listen what he can say
To you, what you ought to do"
Follow for now, power of people, say
"Make a miracle, D, pump the lyrical"
Black is back, all in, we're gonna win
Check it out, yeah Y'all C'mon,
Here we go again
Turn it up! Bring the noise!
Never badger than bad
'Cause the brother is madder than mad
at he fact that's corrupt as a senator
Soul on a roll,
But you treat it like soap on a rope
Cause the beats in the lines are so dope
Listen for the lessons
I'm saying inside music
That the critics are blasting me for
They'll never care for the brothers
And sisters now across
The country has us up for the war
We got to demonstrate, come on now,
They're gonna have to wait
'Til we get it right
Radio station I question their blackness
They call themselves black,
But we'll see if they play this
Turn it up! Bring the noise!
Get from in front of me,
The crowd runs to me
My Deejay is warm,
He's X call him norm ya know
He can cut a record from side to side
So what, the ride, the glide
Should be much safer than a suicide
Soul control,
Beat is the father of you rock'n'roll
Music for watch, for witchin',
you call band man
Making a music, abuse it
But you can't do it, ya know
You call 'em demos,
But we ride Limas too
What you gonna do?
Rap is not afraid of you
Beat is for Sonny Bono,
Beat is for Yoko Ono
Run-DMC first said a deejay
Could be a band
Stand on it's own feet
Get you out your seat
Beat is for Eric B. and L.L.
as well, Hell, Wax, for ANTHRAX,
Sill it can rock bells eyer forever
Universal it will sell, time for me
To exist terminator X-it
Turn it up! Bring the noise!
From coast to coast
So you stop being like a comatose
Stan my man?
The beat's the same with a boost-toast
Rock with some pizazz,
It will last, why you ask?
Roll with the rock stars
You'll never get accepted as we got to
Plead the fifth, we can investigate
Don't need to wait,
Get the records straight
Hey, posse's in effect, got flavor,
Terminator X to sign checks,
Play to get paid
We got to check it down on the avenue
A amazing or two
Is dishing me and dishing you
