Life can be so wonderful
Real love this time you fool
And the you wake up
And you'd chew off your own arm
Or face the only graduate from Satans school of charm!
I hear your mama callin' you
I hear your mama callin' you
You'd better stand and face the truth boy
I hear your mama callin' you
I drink three six packs, just so I can look at your face
Finally!
You give a respect, you get respect
And you just don't know your place
Finally!
You never learn, you always burn
Now I've got you off of my case
Finally!
I drank three six packs, just so I could look at your face
Finally!
See ya!
Over, finished, gone, done, out!
She's not the one you married
Not the one who cared
Maybe it's her evil twin thats got you by the shorthairs
Can you live without it?
Can you be a man?
Can you tell her take a walk and stick it up her can!
I hear your mama callin' you
I hear your mama callin' you
You'd better stand and face the truth boy
I hear your mama callin' you
I drink three six packs, just so I can look at  your face
Finally!
You give a respect, you get respect
And you just don't know your place
Finally!
You never learn, you always burn
Now I've got you off of my case
Finally!
I drank three six packs, just so I could look at your face
Finally!
See ya!
Over, finished, gone, done, out!
I hear your mama callin' you
I hear your mama callin' you
Now go and pack your bags we're through
I hear your mama callin' you
Rape my mind led down the wrong path
One too many rides and you crashed
Had the looks but had no class
Steal my life and taint my past
Sorry I don't mean to laugh take it Sam
How long have you been waiting to be set free?
Don't you know it's easy as 1,2,3
Don't be a faggot now that's the key
Don't you know it's easy as 1,2,3
Now I'm free, now I'm free, me me me finally!!!
Over, finished, gone, done, out!!!!
