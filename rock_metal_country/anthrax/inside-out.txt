I thought I knew what provacation was
I've eaten from the insane root that imprisons reason
It's in my stomach like fire, like cancer,like knife I've been gunshot
I gotta let it go, yeah
It's in my stomach like fire
It's in my stomach like cancer
It's in my stomach like a knife, I've been gunshot
Goddamn no where place to be
Dying deep inside of me
Always standing on the inside looking out
Can't break a hear so strong with pride
It's more than just being alive
I broke the rule with you I'm out
My only antidote to mental suffering is physical pain
It's in my stomach like fire, like cancer,like knife I've been gunshot
I gotta let it go, yeah
It's in my stomach like fire
It's in my stomach like cancer
It's in my stomach like a knife, I've been gunshot
Goddamn no where place to be
I gotta let it go, yeah
Goddamn no where place to be
Dying deep inside of me
Always standing on the inside looking out
Can't break a hear so strong with pride
It's more than just being alive
I broke the rule with you I'm out
