The cracks are showing, on my face
I didn't think that I was, that old my story is
I weathered every storm I, pulled it through
Falling by the wayside, I've seen a few
But I never went down, never went down
I never will
Taken every single blow and countered
Never went down, never went down,
and better still
Look at my face and see your father
I'm ready to take my turn
Taking the shot that I've earned
Chance is what keeps me rolling
Rolling
Diamonds in my eyes
Oceans full of pride
Can't you see I'm only human
I'm in perpetual motion I'm rolling, rolling
Can't you see I'm only human
The cracks are showing, on my face
The well ain't empty, never out of place
It seems to be harder, for some maybe
And I won't play, the game of wait and see
But I never went down, never went down
I never will
Taken every single blow and countered
Never went down, never went down,
and better still
Look at my face and see your father
I'm ready to take my turn
Taking the shot that I've earned
Chance is what keeps me rolling
Rolling
Diamonds in my eyes
Oceans full of pride
Can't you see I'm only human
I'm in perpetual motion I'm rolling, rolling
Can't you see I'm only human
I don't fight I win, underneath it I'm human
And my pride is not a sin,
underneath it I'm human
and I respect my mistakes,
and decisions that I make
In time I've earned my cake,
have my cake and then
I'll eat it
I'm ready to take my turn
Taking the shot that I've earned
Chance is what keeps me rolling
Rolling
Diamonds in my eyes
Oceans full of pride
Can't you see I'm only human
I'm in perpetual motion I'm rolling, rolling
Can't you see I'm only human
