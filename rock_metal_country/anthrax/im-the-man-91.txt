Anthrax, John Rooney
1991, always on the run
Seven year ago he wrote this one
Like Ernest and Julio, before it's time
Seven years later
And it's holding up fine
Stupid motherfuckers
Like to slag us and Dis
But there was no bandwagon
When he wrote this
We opened the door
That no one attempted before
Five guys in shorts, who gives a shit
We do what we like
We don't care where we fit
All you new jacks, what is it?
You're kidding me get off your dicks
Now we're ANTHRAX and we take no shit
And we don't care for writing hits
The sound you hear is what we like
And I'll steal your pop-tarts
Like I stole your Psych!
Beat the beats the beats you beat
The only thing harders's the smell
Of my feet, so listen up closer
Or you might get dissed
Go drain the lizard or take a piss...
Watch the beat
I'm on you case, I'm in your face
Kick you and your father Back in
Place, step off sucker understand
Don't you know I'm the man
We got real def rhythms and fresh jams
If ya think we've got egos
Well we're just hams
Scott plays stickball and likes to skate
Frankie's never on time, he always...
Drinking the drinks, the drink I drank
I put my money in the bank
They cut their cracks, they offer joints
We don't do drugs do you get our meaning
I'm on you case, I'm in your face
Kick you and your father Back in
Place, step off sucker understand
Don't you know I'm the man
For heavy metal band raps different way
But we like to be different & not cliche
Well they say, Rap & metal can never mix
Well all of them can suck our... dicks
Fart the farts the farts he farted
I pick my nose but I'm not retarded
Like el duce says "Smell my anal vapor"
And wipe my butt, with your fucking face
You stupid idiot...
I'm on you case, I'm in your face
Kick you and your father Back in
Place, step off sucker understand
Don't you know I'm the man
Soooooo, as this rap is winding down
It's plan to see I forgot my hat
You know ANTHRAX is number 1
But we don't care we just wanna have...
party Buff the buff the buff he buffed
We are the kings and all shall buff
We're like diamond, that is forever
And will remain the hardest ever!
