I'm standing on a ledge cold and naked
Will someone come and offer me their help
Sometimes I forget my medication
Sometimes I forget to pray
I'll make it through this fuckin' day
I'm unconscious, drunk and blinded
Count to ten and then I unwind it
I'm unconscious, drunk and blinded
Take a deep breath and then I unwind it
I'm wearing out my skin I'm under pressure
Pressure makes me burn it makes me ache
Sometimes I want to burn the things that make me...
Sometimes I stop myself too late
It's written all cross my face
I'm unconscious, drunk and blinded
Count to ten and then I unwind it
I'm unconscious, drunk and blinded
Take a deep breath and then I unwind it
Wired, wired
I'm in a zone, I'm in a zone, I'm in a zone
This is how I live
I never have to justify my actions
Scathing rhetoric my saving grace
Sometimes I really think that it's too noisy
Sometimes I have to hit myself
Words can kill as well as help
I'm unconscious, drunk and blinded
Count to ten and then I unwind it
I'm unconscious, drunk and blinded
Take a deep breath and then I unwind it
Wired, wired
I'm in a zone, I'm in a zone, I'm in a zone
This is how I live
You can't touch me, ever
Fear burns at my touch
Standing on a ledge will you come and help
Will you burn yourself, would you help me then
Fear burns at my touch, in its wake
An ugly jagged scar across your face
I'm unconscious, I'm unconscious, I'm unconscious, I'm
unconscious
Count to ten, I'm unconscious
Take a deep breath and then I unwind it
Wired, wired
I'm in a zone, I'm in a zone, I'm in a zone, This is how I ...
How I live, how I live, how I live, how I live
I'm in a zone, I'm in a zone, I'm in a zone, this is how I live
