Everything is perfect
Everything is sick, that's it
You can't tell me to stop it
You can't tell me not to quit, that's it
Revolve around yourself
It's you and no one else
Hard for me to stay
Swinging moods that change
From calmness to deranged
Unpredictable, unpredictable
You would see if
Only
You hadn't taken things out of my hands
Only
You never wanted to understand
Clashing ways to live here
Compromise for me
I'm at both ends of the spectrum
You're somewhere in the between
Ah, come clean
Revolve around yourself
It's you and no one else
Hard for me to stay
Swinging moods that change
From calmness to deranged
Unpredictable, unpredictable
You would see if
Only
You hadn't taken things out of my hands
Only
You never wanted to understand
Only
You hadn't taken things out of my hands
Only
You never wanted to understand
Only
You hadn't taken things out of my hands
Only
You never wanted to understand
Crucified, terrified, sacrifice, my whole life
My whole life, my whole life, my whole life
My whole life
If only...
I can't contain myself
I can't contain myself
I just can't take myself
