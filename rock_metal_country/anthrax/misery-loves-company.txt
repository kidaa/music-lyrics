I can hear you, I can hear you, lying
I can see you, I can see you, faking
I don't think you're, I don't think you're working
I want you to, I want you to, I want you to...
Write for me, and only me
A really extra special story
Make it mine, every line
Don't make me sorry
It's what I want, It's what I want
And I'll tell you what
You know me, and I can be
A very, very vicious critic
Another fans appreciation
A do-be, don't-be situation
Drag me down into your hatred
Misery loves company
I'm your number one fan
Misery loves company
Misery
Misery loves company
I'm your number one fan
Misery loves company
Die with me
I'll take good care, I'll take great care of you
Listen to me, listen to me you fool
Body and soul, body and soul, you're mine
I want you to
I want you to, I want you to...
Write for me, and only me
A really extra special story
Make it mine, every line
Don't make me sorry
It's what I want, It's what I want
And I'll tell you what
You know me, and I'll show you
How to keep your filthy mouth shut
Another fans appreciation
A do-be, don't-be situation
Drag me down into your hatred
Misery loves company
I'm your number one fan
Misery loves company

Die with me
Take, take, take, take, another  pound of my flesh
I'm givin' blood
You, you, you, you, should only have the best
I'm givin' blood
What the hell is, what the hell is happening?
I'm the one that made you into the king
Don't turn you back on, turn your back on,  my help
I'll kill you, I'll kill you, I will
I'll kill you, I'll kill you, I'll kill...
Write for me, and only me
A really extra special story
Make it mine, every line
Don't make me sorry
It's what I want, It's what I want
And I'll tell you what
You know me, and I can be
A very, very vicious critic
