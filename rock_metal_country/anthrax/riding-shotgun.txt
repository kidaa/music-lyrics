Do it, drive it, drink it, smoke it,
Choke it
Two steps forward
One hundred steps back
We're going the wrong way
It's backwards, it's backwards
Cuffed and branded
I can't stand it
Give me the lane I'm gonna play it my way
when I want to
Charged by the pain
I'm gonna scream out my name if I want to
Live, it, be it, hold it, touch it
Kick it, beat it, love it, suck it
Two steps forward
One hundred steps back
We're going the wrong way
It's backwards, it's backwards
Cuffed and branded
I can't stand it
Give me the lane I'm gonna play it my way
when I want to
Charged by the pain
I'm gonna scream out my name if I want to
I feel like I'm riding shotgun
Not a roll I can play
I would never get on my knees
And walk the walk of the dead
I won't take a back up,
I'm gonna get my back up
I won't take a back up,
charged by life and nothing more
Do it, drive it, drink it, smoke it
Live it, be it, hold it, touch it
Kick it, beat it, love it, suck it !
Give me the lane I'm gonna play it my way
when I want to
Charged by the pain
I'm gonna scream out my name if I want to
I'm riding shotgun
