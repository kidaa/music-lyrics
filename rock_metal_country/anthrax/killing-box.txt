I have always been an experiment in terror
At least I can only kill you once
Standing aloof when I made up my mind
Reaching, why it's better to be blunt
Your walking point through my minefield
You gotta get out
Your on point in my minefield
Forever waiting for a road map
Speak, say something, answer me
I left you in a killing box
Sketchy's not a name you can pin on my
I'll start a revolt with my honesty
A piece of you burns every time you like
So lets start a war, just to see how many die
