I'm wiping the slate spotless
I vow this is your final chance
Almost all but little faith has been thrown out the window
I promise to sustain my stance
You've taken everything from the get go
And you've given nothing in return
Your sadomasochism has reached the ninth inning
Still you're puzzled to see I'm concerned
Struggling, to come to terms with
This god-awful life that I live
Stumbling, but still I try
To get out from under your grip
Transparent in critical moments
You drop me when your hands aren't full
You call yourself my closest friend
Then you make yourself invisible
My simmering blood is rising
Primed and ready to explode
Get off your high horse and come to the party
I'll beat you into overload
Only through your limited viewpoint
You think you know how I exist
Easy to turn my back on the system
Hard not to be an atheist
Back in the days when promises were made
Equality for all
You go by the word from the man who gives it
Never expecting a fall
Struggling, to come to terms with
This god-awful life that I live
Stumbling, but still I try
To get out from under your grip
Transparent in critical moments
You drop me when your hands aren't full
You call yourself my closest friend
Then you make yourself invisible
Transparent in critical moments
You drop me when your hands aren't full
You call yourself my closest friend
Then you make yourself invisible
Make yourself invisible, make yourself invisible
Make yourself invisible, make yourself invisible again
Burn...
I never should've trusted
I never should've trusted
I'm sickened and disgusted
I never should've trusted
What happened to me?
Back in the days when promises were made
Equality for all
You go by the word from the man who gives it
Never expecting a fall
Transparent in critical moments
You drop me when your hands aren't full
You call yourself my closest friend
Then you make yourself invisible
Transparent in critical moments
You drop me when your hands aren't full
You call yourself my closest friend
Then you make yourself invisible
