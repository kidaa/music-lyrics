Disease, Disease
Spreading the disease
With some help from Captain Trips
He'll bring the world down to his knees
Power, yes Power
He'll show them all his power
It pulses through his ice cold blood
A whole world to devour
PRE-CHORUS
He's seeing, He's calling
His legacy, He's spawning
He's coming, corruption
Among the living
Murder, Murder
Commit cold blooded murder
Like Nazis during World War Two
The only follow order
Hatred, Hatred
A crucifix is your bed
Once he turns his eye on you
You'd be better off dead
He's seeing, He's calling
His legacy, He's spawning
He's coming, corruption
Among the living
CHORUS
I am the walkin' dude
I can see all the world
Twist your minds with fear
I'm the man with the power
Among the living
Follow me or die
Man, fights Man
Divided they can't stand
United they can battle back
And make him force his hand
Fear, yes Fear
His end is growing near
He didn't count on man's good faith
And their will to persevere
He's seeing, He's calling
His legacy, He's spawning
He's coming, corruption
Among the living
I am the walkin' dude
I can see all the world
Twist your minds with fear
I'm the man with the power
Among the living
Follow me or die
LEAD BREAK
Fire, hot Fire
Purge the world with fire
Damnation is the price he'll pay
For an evil man's desire
Good, vs. Evil
The stand to vanquish evil
Man can only live one way
That place right in the middle
He's seeing, He's calling
His legacy, He's spawning
He's coming, corruption
Among the living
I am the walkin' dude
I can see all the world
Twist your minds with fear
I'm the man with the power
Among the living
Follow me or die
AMONG
Caught in a Mosh
Why don't you listen to me when I try talk to you
Stop thinking of yourself, for just a second fool
Shut up, shut up, I don't wanna hear your mouth
Your mother made a monster, now get the hell out of my house
BRIDGE
Can't stand it for another day
I ain't gonna live my life this way
Cold sweat, my fists are clenching
Stomp, stomp, stomp, the idiot convention
PRE-CHORUS
Which one of these words don't your understand?
Talking to you, is like clapping with one hand
CHORUS
What is it? - Caught in a mosh
What is it? - Caught in a mosh
What is it? - Caught in a mosh
What is it? - Caught in a mosh
Don't tell me how to do my job
There's the door, your name's on the knob
You're always in the way, like a beast on my back
Were you dropped as a baby, cause brains you lack
Can't stand it for another day
I ain't gonna live my life this way
Cold sweat, my fists are clenching
Stomp, stomp, stomp, the idiot convention
Which one of these words don't your understand?
Talking to you, is like clapping with one hand
What is it? - Caught in a mosh
What is it? - Caught in a mosh
What is it? - Caught in a mosh
What is it? - Caught in a mosh
MOSH PART
Think - before you speak
Or suffer, for your words
Learn, to give respect
That others, give to you
AAAAAAAAAAH. The best you can do
LEAD BREAK
HARMONY LEAD
Hey Man
I'm trying to reason but you don't understand
Talking in circles, we'll never get it straight
Just you and me in our theatre of hate
Can't stand it for another day
I ain't gonna live my life this way
Cold sweat, my fists are clenching
Stomp, stomp, stomp, the idiot convention
Which one of these words don't your understand?
Talking to you, is like clapping with one hand
What is it? - Caught in a mosh
What is it? - Caught in a mosh
What is it? - Caught in a mosh
