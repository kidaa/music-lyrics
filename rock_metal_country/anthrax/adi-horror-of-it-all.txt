It's just to damn easy, to die in this life
Who's making the decisions?
Tell me, who's got the right?
BRIDGE
WOH, OH, OH, My grief turns to anger
WOH, OH, AN, OH, It's time to...
PRE-CHORUS
Say good-bye, It's a horror
Memories, Nothing's harder
I know that there's no answer, I mean what'd I expect
So many unanswered questions
I can't believe, I can't accept
WOH, OH, OH, My grief turns to anger
WOH, OH, AN, OH, It's time to...
Say good-bye, It's a horror
Memories, Nothing's harder
CHORUS
OOOOOH, AAH, OOOOOH, The horror of it all
The horror of it all, I'm gonna break
The horror of it all, Tell me why
You're not supposed to question, but why's there so much pain
When someone's taken from you
What can you do or say?
WOH, OH, OH, My grief turns to anger
WOH, OH, AN, OH, It's time to...
Say good-bye, It's a horror
Memories, Nothing's harder
OOOOOH, AAH, OOOOOH, The horror of it all
The horror of it all, I'm gonna break
The horror of it all, Tell me why
LEAD BREAK
END VERSE
The horror of it all
The horror of it all
The horror of it all
The horror of it all
Say good-bye it's such a horror
My memories there's nothing harder
Anger and hatred fill the page
So smash the walls it's time to rage
