Don't want a life like my parents had
Don't want a life like my rich friends have
Don't want to live by association
Don't want to live the great maybe
I want a life not a name online
I want to live it in real time
I want a life just so I can be
I never asked what was in it for me
Stealing from a thief
My humanity
I know my name, I know my pain
I know my frequency
Dancing with the beast
As a kid I'd play make believe
As a man I play make believe
As a kid I'd do anything
As a man I do everything
I live my life centered and humane
I live my life like a man insane
I get up, I get up and go
I grab a hold and reach way down
To find something that I really believe
I don't need to console myself
If I don't like what I see
