I've changed, by staying the same
What does it mean to be different ?
You've changed, faced from the start
Tell me, an alternative to what ?
How does it feel ?
How does it feel to be part of the picture you...
Paint me into a corner
Tearing my niche,
'Cause I'm the opposite of opposite
Test your new model and see
Test your new model against the original
I'm the man you wanna be
So test your new model and once again you fail me
Planted, I'm staying in touch
Driven, by something with substance
Plugging, away I'm O.K.
You'll be, here today, gone today
How does it feel?
How does it feel to be part of the picture you...
Paint me into a corner
Tearing my niche
'Cause I'm the opposite of opposite
Test your new model and see
Test your new model against the original
I'm the man you wanna be
So test your new model and once again you fail me
For me, things are the same
I have no problem with fame
I can be every man
'Cause my friends never shout my name
Test your new model and see
Test your new model against the original
I'm the man you wanna be
So test your new model and once again you fail me
