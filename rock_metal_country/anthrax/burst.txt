How much does an opinion weigh
Does it really matter what I say
I can't be responsible
Be yourself or be a tool
Who cares what you expect
What is politically correct?
All my ideas are in bad taste
Get off my case and...
Judge yourself
No one else
I don't intend to offend
I just offend with my intent
Beauty's in the beholder's eye
I just like the ugly side
Who cares what you expect
What is politically correct?
All my ideas are in bad taste
Get off my case and...
Judge yourself
No one else
See things the way I do
Walk a mile in my shoes
Don't assume and damn it, don't praise me
My thoughts would drive you crazy
See things the way I do
Walk a mile in my shoes
Don't assume and damn it, don't praise me
My thoughts would drive you crazy
Kill someone, save a life
Don't do drugs, drink all night
Worship Jesus, praise Satan
Opinions are all contradiction
It's not a case of wrong and right
You may hate what I may like
Vice versa, it's the same
Just do it, no pain no gain
Who cares what you expect
What is politically correct?
All my ideas are in bad taste
Get off my case and...
Judge yourself
No one else
See things the way I do
Walk a mile in my shoes
Don't assume and damn it, don't praise me
My thoughts would drive you crazy
See things the way I do
Walk a mile in my shoes
Don't assume and damn it, don't praise me
My thoughts would drive you crazy
Kill someone, save a life
Don't do drugs, drink all night
Worship Jesus, praise Satan
Opinions are all contradiction
