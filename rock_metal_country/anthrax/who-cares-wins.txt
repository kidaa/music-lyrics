Close your eyes to the horror
Close your eyes to the pain
When you live in a box
No one knows your name
Living in the street
Moms and kids with nothing to eat
Welfare hotels
Who says there's no place called hell
I can't see you
I can't hear you
You don't see me
You couldn't be me
Who cares wins
There but for the grace of god
There but for the grace of god
Who cares, who cares, who cares, who cares
There but for the grace of god
There but for the grace of god
Go you of I
Open your eyes
You don't see me
You couldn't be me
Invisible could be my name
Your excuses are so lame
Real pleas fall on deaf ears
Look away when I'm near
Freezing cold in winter's heat
Burning up can be a treat
Blisters breaking on my feet
At least I get a subway seat
I can't see you
I can't hear you
You don't see me
You couldn't be me
Who cares wins
There but for the grace of god
There but for the grace of god
Who cares, who cares, who cares, who cares
There but for the grace of god
There but for the grace of god
Go you of I
Open your eyes
You don't see me
You couldn't be me
Self help and preservation
Not now I'm on vacation
Priority is you
And screw all those around you
Now's the time for you to share
Indifference you have to care
Deep inside you know it's true
How do I get through to you
Open your eyes to the horror
Open your eyes to the pain
When you live in a box
No one knows your name
CHORUS
