Anthrax
I got so much trouble on my mind
Paranoia time
I'm running out of life
Clockwise and the seconds tick away
Each line that cuts my face
Cut as each hand moves into place
Paranoia
Amped and wired
Bile black the thoughts that run my head
There's so much to be said
They're so much living dead
Walking corpses shambling through life
With nothing in their sight
Dance on their bones, step in and fight
Paranoia
Amped and wired
Life and death are fighting for my time
I can't seem to find the time 
I want what's mine
Time through the clock just keeps talking
It just walks any damn place
It feels like walkin'
My mind keeps thinking
Clockwise as the seconds tick away
I make my move today
Time and life
Life and time
To have and hold
And sometimes find
It isn't mine, it isn't yours
Man to man I'll fight you for
Time and life
Life and time
One day I'll get what's mine
Through the persistence of time
Life and death as words they don't mean shit
It's what you do with it
And how you live with it
Raging like a bull inside a cage
Just give me a stage
Where this bull can rage
Paranoia
Amped and wired
Life and death are fighting for my time
I can't seem to find the time 
I want what's mine
Time through the clock just keeps talking
It just walks any damn place
It feels like walkin'
My mind keeps thinking
Clockwise as the seconds tick away
I make my move today
Time and life
Life and time
To have and hold
And sometimes find
It isn't mine, it isn't yours
Man to man I'll fight you for
Time and life
Life and time
One day I'll get what's mine
Through the persistence of time
Paranoia's lost its hold on,
Paranoia's lost its hold on,
Paranoia's lost its hold on,
Paranoia's got no hold on me,
Time don't have nothing
To do with how high you can,
Time don't got nothing
To do with how high you can count
Time and life
Life and time
To have and hold
And sometimes find
It isn't mine, it isn't yours
Man to man I'll fight you for
Time and life
Life and time
One day I'll get what's mine
