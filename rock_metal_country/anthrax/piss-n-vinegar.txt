It was a day to remember, twice as hard as long
That was the day that I convinced myself
That I found my God
I tip my cap and I step up
I fix myself to the right
I move right into the firing zone
And scream drink, fuck or fight
It's just a matter of respect
or is that something I missed
This ain't no peace train that you're jumping on
So shake my hand and shake it strong
And everybody come along
Long, strong am I
Sometimes I can't stop the shaking
At least I know I'm not dead
I don't remember whose blood this is
I've got a hammer inside my head
I get put up, I get put down
And I don't even try
I've burned a bridge, I've burned a whole town
'Cause I'm motherfucking fortified
I tell the truth or just a gilded lie
And then I charge like a bull with his balls tied
A heavy dose of reality
With a side of piss and vinegar
A free drink at the bar and you'll take it
