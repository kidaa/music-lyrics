Abandon all hope for those who enter
Cause there ain't too much of that down here
A clouded mist in a darkened tunnel
And twisted screams are growing near
Now you're down here, you're gonna all stay
Cause the howling furies wanna come out and play
You're headed for doom, you'd better prepare
Cause in this part of the woods almost anything's fair, yeah
You lied and cheated in your miserable life
You met your end with a butcher knife
We laughed when you died, you sit in your grave
Just waiting to turn into satan's slave
