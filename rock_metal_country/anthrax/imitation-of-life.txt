INTRO
There's nothing I hate more, than all these plastic people
With all their plastic promises, and all their plastic deals
They just can't be themselves, and live their own lives out
They're just an imitation of what life's all about
"Because of me you are who you are
So sign your name, and you'll go far
I'm your friend, I think you should
So sign your name, it's for your own good"
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU HEARD THIS TODAY???
Some bogus piss-on saying "Let's do lunch babe"
For them this bullshit, it's their whole life
Cut through their bullshit with a knife
IMITATION OF LIFE
BRIDGE ONE
OOOOOOOH, OOOOH, OH
ANGER BURNS
Whatever happened to the guy I knew
A media creation, a monster grew
Our story had an unhappy end
But this could change, I still call him friend
"Take my advice, listen to me
A great opportunity, can't you see
I only want what's best for you
The deal of a lifetime, what more can I do"
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU HEARD THIS TODAY???
Some stupid sucker says "It's great, we luv ya babe"
For them this bullshit, it's their whole life
Cut through their bullshit with a knife
IMITATION OF LIFE
BRIDGE TWO
OOOOOOOH, OOOOH, OH
ANGER BURNS
Bands dress like women, with hairspray and lace
I'd pass and image law, stick it in their face
Let's see how long they keep dressing this way
Wearing this image twenty four hours a day...
MOSH TALK PART
DID YOU EVER THINK FOR YOURSELF??
JUST ONCE, DID YOU EVER THINK??
THAT'S ALL I WANT TO KNOW
MOSH CHORUS PART
IMITATION OF LIFE, Living out a lie
You'll never be right, IMITATION OF LIFE
WHY ARE YOU HERE??, YOU'RE TAKING UP MY SPACE
The new imperfect race, IMITATION OF LIFE
LEAD BREAK
OOOOOOOH, OOOOH, OH
ANGER BURNS
Whatever happened to the guy I knew
A media creation, a monster grew
Our story had an unhappy end
But this could change, I still call him friend
There's nothing I hate more
Than all these plastic people
With all their plastic promises
And all their plastic deals
They just can't be themselves
And live their own lives out
They're just an imitation
Of what life's all about
IMITATION OF LIFE
