Killing myself
Someone said the fix is in
Killing myself
Once again, once again
Over easy
Burnt, my mind is overdone
Life's a jigsaw
Why can't I find the missing one
Even though I've felt I've proven what it is I'm worthy of
I can't exist inside the boundaries of the so-called world
of love
Someone rescue my downward virtue
I dropped the ball again
Hands that touch me
Take 'em all away
Patronizing
Will you hear what I say
Fuck your caring
No one knows what's in my heart
Bring it all down
Break it all down to parts
Every time I have considered why it is I'm even here
Calm collected copasetic, no good reasons why I fear
No one rescue my downward virtue
Even though I've felt I've proven what it is I'm worthy of
I can't exist inside the boundaries of the so-called world
of love
No one rescue, no one rescue
I dropped the ball again
I never felt for you for anyone
I never ate off the same plate
Drop the ball I dropped the ball
I take from you, I rape from you
I kill myself when I think of you
Drop the ball I dropped the ball
I take from you, I break from you
I used to know how to be human
Drop the ball I dropped the ball
I take from you, I hate from you
No one rescue my downward virtue
No one rescue, no one rescue
