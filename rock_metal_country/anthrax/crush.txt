Now you see me now you don't
Go before I am the goat
You get away with murder, kill me when you're through
Do I have to give up me, to be loved by you
From the smallest taste I use
From the smallest taste I lose
Won't you crush on me, crush on
Pile your dead on top of me
Tape my eyes so I can't see
I've been waiting for today
I can't touch you when you're far away
Nothing makes me feel this way
Except hate but that fades away
