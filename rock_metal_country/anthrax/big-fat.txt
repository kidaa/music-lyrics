Looming large like a favorite son
One more time comes my obsession
Like a mountain stream that ends in mud
I'm wading in waiting for the flood, sinking
You did
Left me hating, contemplating
Left me waning, slowly draining
Feet of clay that are stuck to the floor
And with vanity you want more
I'm drinking strength for comic relief
While I'm growing super weak in the knees
You asked me can I deliver
Like a monster crossing the Hudson river, stomping
Big fat kill
Carrying the weight of the world
In my arms
I'm biting my tongue so much it hurts
But at the same time I'm at a loss for words
The things I've seen should've left me blind
So it makes me happy that I'm losing my mind, laughing
You asked me can I deliver
Like a monster crossing the Hudson river
The things I've seen should've left me blind
