All these years I've been the hard man
All these years it's been so hard man
To live my life for someone else
In fear of being honest with myself
I perpetrated a lie
Juggling my life with one hand tied behind my back
Trying to find, and it had always been mine
I'm in, I'm out
I'm breaking though the darkness
And it knocked me over
Into the light of an older soul, and I'll never die
Cause everything I am is in your eyes
Angels in my heart, devils in my eyes
I'll live forever in your eyes
Crucify my inhibitions
The first born son he died for my sins
Nothing to worry about
And all these years I was the hard man
I always knew I'd find myself and prove
Because you told me the truth, it's all I wanted from you
My catharic dream, a primal scream
shedding my skin
somewhere between light and dark
I balance what I am
And I remember everything we said we'd ding a way
Laugh and cry, love and hate
Ain't no weak link this bond won't break
I put it out there it comes back
