I know I'll never be free
Change doesn't come easy
And if I'll never be free
You'll live in hell with me
Fear, a contradiction
Co-existense, darkness brought to light
My own skin don't seem to fit me right
Pain is my way, of self expression
A fatal choice that always hangs above
Love what I kill, kill what I love
I run, you run, you stop and then you take it
I run, you run, I stop and then you get it
I run, you run, you stop and then you take it
I run, you run, I stop and then you get it
From me,
The one who's giant steps ahead of where you'd be
What you don't see
I know I'll never save myself
Dying from this immortality
This is not an exit
I can never change it
This is not an exit
It's no way
Out, out of touch with
Mortal thoughts, humanity's a dream
Things are not what they seem
Hungry for you, but not to hurt you
Hunger for the secret of your life
I'm a timeless clock and you kill time
I run, you run, you stop and then you take it
I run, you run, I stop and then you get it
I run, you run, you stop and then you take it
I run, you run, I stop and then you get it
From me,
The one who's giant steps ahead of where you'd be
What you don't see
I know I'll never save myself
Dying from this immortality
This is not an exit
I can never change it
This is not an exit
It's no way out...
I know I'll never be free
Change doesn't come easy
And if I'll never be free
You'll live in hell with me
This is not an exit
I can never change it
You stop and then you take it
I stop and I can't fake it
This is not an exit
Pain is my way of self expression
A fatal choice hangs above
Love what I kill, kill what I love
Love...
This is not an exit
This is not an exit
I can never change it
This is not an exit
Hand over fist
Come and taste my dark trick
Hand over fist
Kill you when I give it
This is not an exit
This is not an exit
I can never change it
