I'm out to mix it up and change my complexion
To coat the feelings and cure my depression
A shot of petrol is my bonafide method
To lose control and get thoroughly distracted
I'm on the money, here I come
Fuel for my engine, and Im gone
I like to forget why I feel this compulsive
As I toss tomorrow's dreams in the garbage
What's important is a mind that's sicker
Turning Jekyll into Hide much quicker
I'm on the money, here I come
Fuel for my engine, and I'm gone
1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4
Kickstart and turn me over
Punchdrunk, but I'm still sober
Fourteen years and a whole lot bolder
And I don't flinch
Hungry and I'll take the best
'Cause I never wanted anything less
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger
It's like a war inside me, I'm good, Im evil
Two sides of the coin and I've been blessed with both
On one hand I am you, but I don't like you
I guess that's the nature of the way things work
Im on the money, here I come
Fuel for my engine, and I'm gone
1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4
Kickstart and turn me over
Punchdrunk, but I'm still sober
Bukowski's on my shoulder
With much to think
Hungry and I'll take the best
'Cause I never wanted anything less
What doesn't kill makes me stronger
It's like a war inside me, action is all I know
Tell me it's suicide, tell me something I don't know
I don't know why I've been made some kind of hero
When I've done all I can do to prove I'm not
It's amazing to think someone could trust me
Tell me what do you know about me really ?
And I you make the mistake of getting close to,
Me, you'll just give me all that you've got
So I don't know why I've been made some kind of hero
When I've done all I can do to prove I'm not
1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4
Kickstart and turn me over
Punchdrunk, but I'm still sober
Fourteen years and a whole lot bolder
And I don't flinch
Hungry and I'll take the best
'Cause I never wanted anything less
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger
1, 2, 3, 4, 1, I can't close this broken door
It's just the nature of the way things work
You wanna be me, I don't give a damn
Anyone can do it but it takes a man not to
Try so hard to give me a real life
Anyone can do it but it takes a man not to
It's just the nature of the way things work
