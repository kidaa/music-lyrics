All aboard
The feelin' good train

It's a long way from here to heaven
It takes a lifetime before you get in
You work so hard just tryin' to make a livin'
Still you wind up on the losin' end

Everybody needs a little sunshine
Forget your troubles leave 'em all behind
I know a place where they're feelin' no pain
So get on board the feelin' good train

There's a light at the end of the tunnel
Hear the whistle blowin' 'round the bend
We don't want to leave the station without you
You'll have the best time that you'll ever spendEverybody need some time to unwind
Dance all those blues right out of your mind
And there's a place where you can run from the rain
So get on board the feelin' good train

This train runs all across the country
This trail rolls all around the world
You don't even need to buy a ticket
So c'mon every man, woman, boy or girl

Everybody needs a little sunshine
Forget your troubles leave 'em all behind
I know a place where they're feelin' no pain
So get on board the feelin' good train
Feelin' good train
Feelin' good train
Feelin' good train
Feelin' good train
