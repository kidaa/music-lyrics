Dean Dillon/Donny Kees
You were the only woman for the longest time
And I'll admit that even now you still cross my mind
'Cause we had what others only dream about
But that was then, and this is now

We used to be red hot lovers
Swore we'd always be each other's
You and me, used to be, what might have been

There was a time I couldn't take my eyes off you
And I could tell by your touch you didn't want me to
And if I had you over again, we wouldn't be apart
'Cause I still go on loving you in my heartWe used to red hot lovers
Swore we'd always be each other's
You and me, used to be, what might have been

I wonder to this day
Why I let you slip away
We used to be red hot lovers
Swore we'd always be each other's
You and me, used to be, what might have been
Oh, you and me, used to be, what should have been
