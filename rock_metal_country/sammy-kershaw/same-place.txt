Dean Dillon/Buddy Cannon/Marla Cannon
Each night you show up about a quarter to two
And in my dreams you always come true
And for awhile it's just like old times
But before I know it you say goodbye

But I'll meet you same place, same time
I'll be waitin' at the front door in the back of my mind
When that old sun goes down, I'll lie in wait
For you to hold me in your arms
And love me like yesterday

I've learned to face and live with the fact
That in real life you're not coming back
Guess I'll never know why you said goodbye
My only consolation is I know that I

Will meet you same place, same time
I'll be waitin' at the front door in the back of my mind
When that old sun goes down, I'll lie in wait
For you to hold me in your arms
And love me like yesterday
Same place, same time
I'll be waitin' at the front door in the back of my mind
When that old sun goes down, I'll lie in wait
For you to hold me in your arms
And love me like yesterday
