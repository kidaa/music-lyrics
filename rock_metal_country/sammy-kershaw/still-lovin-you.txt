Rock Killough
I thought you might want to stay
If I put my guitar away
Quit the band and came home to stay
But that wouldn't do
And this old guitar of mine
Used to ease my troubled mind
But now every day I find
That it's lonesome too

Here I go again
Blowin?my show again
Unable to glow again
Still lovin?you
Losin?my hope again
At the end of my rope again
Unable to cope again
Still lovin?youI must of been million miles
I must have faked a million smiles
I just can't get reconciled
To be without you
And I'd like to start again
And replay my part again
Not break your heart again
I can't stand these blues

Here I go again
Blowin?my show again
Unable to glow again
Still lovin?you
Losin?my hope again
At the end of my rope again
Unable to cope again
Still lovin?you
I'm unable to cope again
Still lovin?you
