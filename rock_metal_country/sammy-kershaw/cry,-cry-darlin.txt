Jimmy Newman/J.D. Miller
Cry, cry darlin?
That's what I do
If you'd leave me with the blues

Cry, cry darlin?
That's all I do
If it's you I should lose
For me there'd be no sunshine
If we should ever part

Cry, cry darlin?
That's what I do
'Cause you're the one in my heartCry, cry darlin?
My eyes would cry
Never dry if you should go

Cry, cry darlin?
When shadows breathe
I just weep all night I know
Girl you know how much I would miss you
If we should ever part

Cry, cry darlin?
That's all I do
'Cause you're the one in my heart
Cry, cry darlin?
That's all I do
'Cause you're the one in my heart
