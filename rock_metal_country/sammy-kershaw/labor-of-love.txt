Billy Lawson/Larry Boone
Well I got a cousin that's twice removed
Had a crush on a girl back in school
She didn't know it he didn't let it show
Now she's married to a banker in El Paso

You gotta swing that hammer
And beat that drum
Swing that hammer beat that drum
Work work work
It's a labor of love

Well I once knew a couple from Arkansas
And she did hair and he hauled logs
Saved up their money and built on a room
Now there's three of them where there used to be two

You gotta swing that hammer
And beat that drum
Swing that hammer beat that drum
Work work work
It's a labor of love

No matter if you're low class, high class, middle class
Well it don't discriminate, no it don't
It don't matter if you're redneck, intellect, a beatneck
Well it all works the same, Lordy Lordy Lordy Lord now

You gotta swing that hammer
And beat that drum
Swing that hammer beat that drum
Work work work
It's a labor of love

Gotta swing that hammer
And beat that drum
Swing that hammer beat that drum
Work work work
It's a labor of love

Work work work
It's a labor of love
