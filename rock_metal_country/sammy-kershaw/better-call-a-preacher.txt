I thought I saw an angel just the other night
Wearin' five inch heels and a dress to tight
Showin' much more than a man should see
Lookin' at her lookin' back at me
My insides were shakin' like I'd caught the flu
Better call a preacher cause a doctor won't do

I'm in love with you honey
I came to testify
Now you're the one for me
I want the world to see
I got nothin' to hide
It's a bad case of lovin' so I'm tellin' you
Better call a preacher cause a docter won't do

Well she started walking toward me from across the room
And my heart was a poundin' and before I knew
She smiled and whispered something in a southern drawl
I started breathin' heavy had to lean against the wall
I stuttered and I muttered like a lovesick fool
Better call a preacher cause a doctor won't do

I'm in love with you honey
I came to testify
Now you're the one for me
I want the world to see
I got nothin' to hide
It's a bad case of lovin' so I'm tellin' you
Better call a preacher cause a docter won't do

I'm in love with you honey
I came to testify
Now you're the one for me
I want the world to see
I got nothin' to hide
It's a bad case of lovin' so I'm tellin' you
Better call a preacher cause a docter won't do I'm in love with you honey
