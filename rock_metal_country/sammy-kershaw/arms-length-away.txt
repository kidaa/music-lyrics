How long have we been the very best of friends
I've always heard you say, I could tell you anything
Oh the times I made you laugh, the times I dried your tears
Through the good and bad I've always been right there

An arms length away
Right in front of your face
This close to your lips, right at your finger tips
That one true love, you're dreaming of
Darlin' what would you say
If I told you it's an arms length away

For so long I've longed to hold you, oh the nights I almost told you
I stopped myself afraid, of just what you might say
And the love that you have searched for, that seems so out of reach
Have you ever stopped to think it might be me

An arms length away
Right in front of your face
This close to your lips, right at your finger tips
That one true love, you're dreaming of
Darlin' what would you say
If I told you it's an arms length away

That one true love, you're dreaming of
Darlin' what would you say
If I told you it's an arms length away
That one true love, you're dreaming of
Darlin' what would you say
If I told you it's an arms length away
