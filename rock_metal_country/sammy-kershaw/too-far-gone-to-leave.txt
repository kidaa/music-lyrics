Rock Killough/Larry T. WilsonTrack 8 - Time 2:52
I can't bear to ask the question
When the answer is goodbye
It only adds to my confusion
When you won't tell me why
And as I sit here on this bar stool
Blind but not naive
I'm probably acting like a fool
But I'm too far gone to leave

Too far, too far gone to leave
But I guess that's what I'll do
I can't keep on believin'
That you love for me is true
And though my heart tells my head to stay
My mind says walk away
I'm way on beyond grief
Too far gone to leaveThe years with me and Nick and Christi
Must not mean a thing to you
You just want it over quickly
Without giving us a clue
And as I sit here on this bar stool
With my heart out on my sleeve
I can feel your ridicule
But I'm too far gone to leave

Too far, too far gone to leave
But I guess that's what I'll do
I can't keep on believin'
That you love for me is true
And though my heart tells my head to stay
My mind says walk away
I'm way on beyond grief
Too far gone to leave
I keep hoping for a rerieve
'Cause I'm too far gone to leave
