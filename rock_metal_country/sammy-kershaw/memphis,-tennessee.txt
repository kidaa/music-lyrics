Long distance information
Give me Memphis, Tennessee
Help me find the party
Tryin' to get in touch with me
She could not leave her number
But I know who placed the call
'Cause my uncle took the message
And he wrote it on the wall

Help me information
Get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd phone for me here
From Memphis, Tennessee
Her home is on the south side
High up on a ridge
Just a half a mile
From the Mississippi bridge

Help me information
More than that I can not add
Only that I miss her
And all the fun we had
But we were pulled apart
Because her mom did not agree
And tore apart our happy home
In Memphis, TennesseeLast time I saw Marie
She was wavin' me goodbye
With hurry-home drops on her cheek
That trickled from her eye
Well Marie is only six years old
Information please
Try to put me through to her
In Memphis, Tennessee

So long distance information
Give me Memphis, Tennessee
Help me find the party
Tryin' to get in touch with me
Well Marie is only six years old
Information please
Try to put me through to her
In Memphis, Tennessee
