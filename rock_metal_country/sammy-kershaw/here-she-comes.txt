Here she comes boy, the one I've been talkin' about
The one I just can't live without
Here she comes boy

Her warm kisses they linger in my mind
I think of them all the time
Her warm kisses

Well everyone can see that we used to be
A picture made so perfectly
Now they don't see the ring
And all the things
I did for her to be free

Well my mistake was thinkin' she'd be her forever
And she wouldn't leave me no never
Yeah my mistake was

Well everyone can see that we used to be
A picture made so perfectly
Now they don't see the ring
And all the things
I did for her to be free

Well there she goes boy walkin' with a new one beside her
I guess I'll have to live without her
'Cause there she goes boy
I guess I'll have to live without her
'Cause there she goes boy
