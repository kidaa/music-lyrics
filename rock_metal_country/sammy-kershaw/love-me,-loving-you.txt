Love me, loving you
Is all I want from you
Forever and a day, is not long enough I say
To show you how much you mean to me
I love you, loving me

Hold me, holding you
And we'll always hold on to
The feelings that we share
We won't let go I swear
'Cause I'll show you how much you mean to me
I love you, loving me

Your pretty smile, it drives me wild
Something no one else can do
So take my hand and my wedding band
And tell me that you doNow kiss me, kissing you
We're one now, we're not two
Together 'til the end
We'll always be best friends

And I'll show you how much you mean to me
I love you, loving me
Yes I'll show you how much you mean to me
I love you, loving me
