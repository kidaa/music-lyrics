I rolled out of bed grabbed a cup of caffeine this morning
Walked out the door didn't even kiss you goodbye
Hurrying to work, a car pulled out no warnin'
In an instant it all flashed before my eyes

And I'm gonna live the rest of my life
Like I got one day left to live
One night left to love you
Startin' right now I'm startin' all over
Doin' what I should do
Should this be my last, or I've got a hundred years
From this day on I'm gonna live my life
Like I got one day left to live

What a close call
Could of been all she wrote me
Think I'll turn this car around and head back home
There's a reason to be learned in this it showed me
Take nothing for granted in a second it can all be gone

But I'm gonna live the rest of my life
Like I got one day left to live
One night left to love you
Startin' right now I'm startin' all over
Doin' what I should do
Should this be my last, or I've got a hundred years
From this day on I'm gonna live my life
Like I got one day left to live

One night left to love you
Startin' right now I'm startin' all over
Doin' what I should do
Should this be my last, or I've got a hundred years
From this day on I'm gonna live my life
Like I got one day left to live
