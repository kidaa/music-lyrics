Little Jolena, a dark haired darlin'
Skin of ivory, angel eyes
Every man in Louisiana wanted her sweet love
But she swore on the Bible, she was all mine

Hey little did I know, she was wild as the bayou
Catch a man on a cane pole, hang his heart on the line
I thought I could hold her, me oh my oh
Little did I know, she had bigger fish to fry

My brother tried to warn me, Mama she scorned me
My friends all told me, I was under her spell
But I wouldn't listen, I was lovesick
Without Jolena life would be a living hellHey little did I know, she was wild as the bayou
Catch a man on a cane pole, hang his heart on the line
I thought I could hold her, me oh my oh
Little did I know, she had bigger fish to fry

At the church in the Wildwood standin' at the alter
Little Jolena never showed
I heard later on she left with a dandy
And headed down to Mexico

Hey little did I know, she was wild as the bayou
Catch a man on a cane pole, hang his heart on the line
I thought I could hold her, me oh my oh
Little did I know, she had bigger fish to fry
Hey little did I know, she had bigger fish to fry
