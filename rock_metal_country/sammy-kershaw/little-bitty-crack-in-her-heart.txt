Shawn Camp/Jim Rushing
Shattered inside and scattered around
Were the pieces of her broken heart
I gathered up the pieces I found
Put her back together like a busted guitar
But some glues hold and some glues don't
In spite of everything I've tried
Somebody stole my darlin Lord
Right before my very eyes

He didn't walk, talk, push his way in
Fly through the window on a gust of hot wind
He didn't sprout wings
And he sure wasn't playing no harp
Low as he was I couldn't see him
Slithering around in the dark
Lord he must have crawled through
A little bitty crack in her heart 

Copin' with gone and hoping I'm wrong
But I sure see a definite change
There's a look in her eyes that's sayin' goodbye
And her snuggle when I hold her don't feel the same
The way her heart beats for the sneaky thief
You picture him dark and tall
But the feller that stole my darlin' Lord
He has to be very smallHe didn't walk, talk, push his way in
Fly through the window on a gust of hot wind
He didn't sprout wings
And he sure wasn't playing no harp
Low as he was I couldn't see him
Slitherin' around in the dark
Lord he must of crawled through
A little bitty crack in her heart

Low as he was I couldn't see him
Slitherin' around in the dark
Lord he must of crawled through
A little bitty crack in her heart
Low as he was I couldn't see him
Slitherin' around in the dark
Lord he must of crawled through
A little bitty crack in her heart
Well he must of crawled through
A little bitty crack in her heart
