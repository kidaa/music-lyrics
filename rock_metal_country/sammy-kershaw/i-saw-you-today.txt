Bobby Braddock
Despite all the distance and time
And the changes that I have gone through
You never strayed far from my mind
And I never stop hoping once more I'll see you

Then I saw you today
In the backyard at play
Baby blue eyes, blond hair in the wind
She's you all over again
Although you went away
I saw you todayI used to wish on a star
And I used to send up a prayer
To Heaven where I know you are
That some day I'd see you up there or somewhere

Then I saw you today
In the backyard at play
Baby-blue eyes, blond hair in the wind
She's you all over again
Although you went away
I saw you
I saw you today
