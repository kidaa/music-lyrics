Wynn Varble/Charles Victor
This ain't hoops, this ain't hopscotch
And this ain't dodge ball in the sandlot
And this ain't cards
It's our hearts we're dealing with now
No more games for me girl I'm fit to be tied down

I've lost at love, got some bruises
But the heart that don't give up
Never really loses
Since I met you
It don't make sense to keep on playing around
Anyone can see you've got me
Fit to be tied down

Tie me down, wrap me up in forever
I've found something sweet in surrendering now
Take me off this merry go round
Going round in circles has got me nowhere
But a love like yours is really so rare
And I'm amazed at the treasure I've finally found
I'm on bended knee
'Cause I'm fit to be tied downTie me down, wrap me up in forever
I've found something sweet in surrendering now
Take me off this merry go round

This ain't hoops, this ain't hopscotch
And this ain't dodge ball in the sandlot
And this ain't cards
It's our hearts we're dealing with now
No more games for me girl I'm fit to be tied down
No more games for me girl I'm fit to be tied
