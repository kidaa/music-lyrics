She still answers whenever I call
We talk about work and the weather and all
If I mention the past or maybe coming back home
It ain't long till I hear that old cold dial tone

I still got her number but I can't reach her anymore
I can't reach out and touch her heart the way I did before
She don't have much to talk about
Since my feet did the walking out
If she could only see them walk the floor
I still got her number but I can't reach her anymore

She says her job is hectic but it's beautiful outside
She might call in sick tomorrow and just take a drive
I said I'd really love to see you can I meet you somewhere
And then the conversation fades and long distance fills the air

I still got her number but I can't reach her anymore
I can't reach out and touch her heart the way I did before
She don't have much to talk about
Since my feet did the walking out
If she could only see them walk the floor
I still got her number but I can't reach her
I still got her number but I can't reach her anymore
I can't reach out and touch her heart the way I did before
She don't have much to talk about
Since my feet did the walking out
If she could only see them walk the floor
I still got her number but I can't reach her anymore
