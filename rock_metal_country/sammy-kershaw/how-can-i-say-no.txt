Sammy Kershaw
Do I love you, do I really care
The rest of my life, do I want you there
Would I hold you tight
'Til the morning light
How can I say no

If you give me your heart, would I do the same
Can you count on me for anything
Will I always be true
Would I die for you
How can I say no

How can I say no
You touched me deep in my soul
Loving you could never grow old
How can I say no

Will I stand by your side 'til death do us part
Will I dry all the tears when there's rain in your heart
If you said that you do
Would I say it too
How can I say no

How can I say no
You touched me deep in my soul
Loving you could never grow old
How can I say no
Loving you could never grow old
How can I say no
