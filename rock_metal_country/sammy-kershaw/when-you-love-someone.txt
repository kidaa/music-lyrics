When you love someone
Really love someone
You'd walk through fire to see her smile
To be the father of her child
What you wouldn't do
'Cause when you love someone
Your heart just comes undone
I'll never love again it's true
The way that I love you

Maybe it's just the sound of your voice
When you say hello
Or just the way you close your eyes
When I hold you close
There are so many reasons
You're all I taste, I touch, I breathe in

'Cause when you love someone
Really love someone
You'd walk through fire to see her smile
To be the father of her child
What you wouldn't do
When you love someone
Your heart and soul are one
I'll never love again it's true
The way that I love youSometimes I'm moved to tears
'Cause girl I just can't believe
I found the person I've searched for
Seems like eternity
When I look into your blue-green eyes
I see my future and I realize
That's it's paradise

'Cause when you love someone
Really love someone
You'd walk through fire to see her smile
To be the father of her child
What you wouldn't do
'Cause when you love someone
Your heart and soul are one
I'll never love again it's true
The way that I love you
I'll never love again it's true
The way that I love you
