duet with George JonesMark Petersen/Jim FosterTrack 11 - Time 2:21
I've been abused and used and skinned up and bruised
And thrown from a movin' train
I've been homeless, car less, lost in the wilderness
Out in the pourin' rain
I've been a business flop spent a year on top
Of the most unwanted list
But I never bit a bullet like this

I've taken many a fall and I got through 'em all
But I've never been hurt this bad
You're making plans with a brand new man
And the pain is driving me mad
I've had to bite the bullet when things got tough
But the sea of love has never been this rough
And I've never been this far from shore
I never bit a bullet like this before
I never bit a bullet like this

I've been tied up, fried up, chocked up and dried up
Under a lot of stress
I've been burned down, turned down, been run out of town
Up to my ears in a mess
I had a year go by with tears in my eyes
I didn't even want to exist
But I never bit a bullet like this

I've taken many a fall and I got through 'em all
But I've never been hurt this bad
And you're making plans with a brand new man
And the pain is driving me mad
I've had to bite the bullet when things got tough
But the sea of love has never been this rough
And I've never been this far from shore
I never bit a bullet like this before
I never bit a bullet like this
I never bit a bullet like this before
I never bit a bullet like this
