Steve Dale Jones
I can't imagine a symphony, without strings
And what good are tennis shoes, without strings
One without the other just can't be complete
What about us, what about you and me

Without strings, without ties
That's the way you want us to be
But if there's nothin' between us
There's nothin' between us
Without strings, without ties
Guess this is where we disagree
How can there be a you and me, without stringsYou can call me old-fashioned, 'cause I sure am
And when I tell you I love you, well I sure do
I don't play games, I say what I mean
When I whisper in your ear
So what do we do, where do we go from here

Without strings, without ties
That's the way you want us to be
But if there's nothin' between us
There's nothin' between us
Without strings, without ties
Guess this is where we disagree
How can there be a you and me, without strings
How can there be a you and me, without strings
