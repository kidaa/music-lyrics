Tony Martin/Byron Hill
Hey ole buddy, how you been
Not much has changed here on my end
No I don't think she's comin' back
We better not get into that

Let's talk about baseball
Talk a little small talk
There's gotta be a good joke

Let's talk about NASCARs
Old Hollywood movie stars
Let's talk about anything
Anything in this world
But politics, religion and her

And one more topic I won't touch
That one's her -- it hurts too much Let's talk about baseball
Talk a little small talk
There's gotta be a good joke
That you've heard
Let's talk about NASCARs
Old Hollywood movie stars
Let's talk about anything
Anything in this world
But politics, religion and her
