My baby came and got me in her Mama's Cadillac
We went parkin' by the river near the honeydew patch
She started talkin' 'bout the birds and the bees
My mind ran wild with the possibilities
Like Rhett and Scarlett climbin' up the stairs
We were on our way to heaven in the melons out there

She was the centerfold picture in a country boy's dream
Prettiest thing I ever had seen
Tupelo honey in a pair of blue jeans
The upper Mississippi Delta Cotton County Queen

She had a judge for a Daddy, he made her tow the line
Brother he was tougher than a year of hard time
He came by and caught us rollin' in the weeds
Said ";Boy get goin' if you're ever gonna leave";
I took off runnin' out of that place
All the while thinkin' 'bout her beautiful face

She was the centerfold picture in a country boy's dream
Prettiest thing I ever had seen
Tupelo honey in a pair of blue jeans
The upper Mississippi Delta Cotton County QueenSnuck up to the house in the heat of the night
Hid in the hedge 'til they turned out the lights
Tapped on the windows said ";Darlin' let's go";
And we were gone with the wind in her El Dorado

She was the centerfold picture in a country boy's dream
Prettiest thing I ever had seen
Tupelo honey in a pair of blue jeans
The upper Mississippi Delta Cotton County Queen

Yeah she's the cerfold picture in a country boy's dream
The upper Mississippi Delta Cotton County Queen
Upper Mississippi, Delta Cotton County Queen
