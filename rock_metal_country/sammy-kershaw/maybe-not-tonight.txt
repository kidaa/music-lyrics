Sammy Kershaw & Lorrie MorganKeith Stegall/Dan Hill
You don't touch me anymore
You never say the words I love you
You just sit behind your paper
The silence cuts me like a razor
I'm gonna leave you
Maybe someday soon
When I can give up this fight
But maybe not tonight

We don't talk much anymore
Not the same way we used to
Whenever I reach out to hold you
You turn away
What am I supposed to do
I'm gonna say goodbye
When the moment's right
Like an eagle I will fly
But maybe not tonight

Can you just hold me
In your arms so deep
Wanna feel you breathin' on my skin
We fell out of love
We can fall back inYou never look at me that way
So many times I've longed to say
You used to brush the hair back from my face 
Oh God, how I miss those days
You used to make me feel like someone
Tell me where did we go wrong
You were my best friend, my one and only love
You're still the only one
Just as I'm leaving you
You walk in the room
I see the flicker in your eyes
We say maybe not tonight

Can you just hold me
In your arms so deep
Wanna feel you breathin' on my skin
We fell out of love How did we fall out of love
Maybe we can fall back in

You don't touch me anymore
You never say the words I love you
I love you
