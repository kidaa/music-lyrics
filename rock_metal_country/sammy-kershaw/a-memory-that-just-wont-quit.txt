Walt Aldridge/Susan Longacre
I saw your car today
It looked like it anyway
Those foreign makes all look the same
It took me way back to
That time when I watched you
Slam the door and drive away
Ever since that night I just can't shake your memory
It's everywhere I go
And every thing I see

It's all over town
Tryin?to track me down
Makin?sure that your old flame stays lit
Just like a blue tick hound
Doggin?me around
You've got a memory that just won't quitI've been out a time or two
But what's a man to do
When your memory tags along
I tried to give it the slip
I got out in front of it
But somehow it always beats me home
It always seems to hunt me down
And chase me up a tree
No matter what I just can't lose your memory

It's all over town
Tryin?to track me down
Makin?sure that your old flame stays lit
Just like a blue tick hound
Doggin?me around
And you've got a memory that just won't quit
Just like a blue tick hound
Doggin?me around
You've got a memory that just won't quit
