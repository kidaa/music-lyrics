Sammy Kershaw/Mike Fornes
Well I really look a mess
Ever since you left I guess
And the grass outside needs mowin'
Laundry's stacked up three foot tall
But I don't even care at all
And I don't know where I'm goin'

Thank God you're gone
So you don't see me fall apart
Pickin' up the pieces of my shattered broken heart
When you left me, my world came down
It's a good thing you're not around to see
I'm really not that strong
Thank God you're gone

Well they took all my things today
Even hauled my truck away
And the vines died that grew our roses
Don't know if it will ever end
Seems like I can't find a friend
I find a door and it just closes, so...Thank God you're gone
So you don't see me fall apart
Pickin' up the pieces of my shattered broken heart
When you left me, my world came down
It's a good thing you're not around to see
I'm really not that strong
Thank God you're gone

Thank God you're gone
So you don't see me fall apart
Pickin' up the pieces of my shattered broken heart
When you left me, my world came down
It's a good thing you're not around to see
I'm really not that strong
Thank God you're gone

Thank God you're gone
Thank God you're gone
