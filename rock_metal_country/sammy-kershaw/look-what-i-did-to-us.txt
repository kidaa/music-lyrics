Hello baby - put your mama on the line
Hi, it's me again - this won't take much of your time
I know you told me to get some help
I guess I should 'cause I don't forgive myself

Look what I did to me
Look what I did to you
I took the love of a lifetime
And I tore it all in two
I broke their little hearts
And if that wasn't enough
Look what I did to you
Look what I did to me
Look what I did to us

Who won the ballgame - tell him not to cry
Win some, you lose some - tell him that's just life
I know how he feels sometimes
When I think of all I left behindLook what I did to me
Look what I did to you
I took the love of a lifetime
And I tore it all in two
I broke their little hearts
And if that wasn't enough
Look what I did to you
Look what I did to me
Look what I did to us

Well I just needed to hear your voice instead
Of the one that echoes in my head

Look what I did to me
Look what I did to you
I took the love of a lifetime
And I tore it all in two
I broke their little hearts
And if that wasn't enough
Look what I did to you
Look what I did to me
Look what I did to us
Look what I did to you
Look what I did to me
Look what I did to us
