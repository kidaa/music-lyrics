Buddy Cannon/Larry Bastian
When I go walkin?down the street
The girls that used to catch my eye don't interest me
I got my mind on you instead
Marilyn Munroe could not turn my head
Don't you see I've got a one track mind
You've got me wearin?blinders

You've got a lock on my love baby
Ain't goin?no where can't you see
You've got a lock on my love baby
Throw away the key

I never thought I'd see the day
I'd be happy 'bout a woman takin?my feedom away
Never thought I'd walk the line
But baby let me say the pleasure is all mine
Let the other guys make the rounds
Lookin?for what I foundYou've got a lock on my love baby
Ain't goin?no where can't you see
You've got a lock on my love baby
Throw away the key

Makin?love to me just used to be a game to play
But when I met you I threw my little black book away
You've got a lock on my love baby
Ain't goin?no where can't you see
You've got a lock on my love baby
Throw away the key
You've got a lock on my love baby
Ain't goin?no where can't you see
You've got a lock on my love baby
Throw away the key
Throw away the key
Throw away the key
Throw away the key
Throw away the key
