Sittin' in a tiny table in a ritzy restaurant
She was starin' at her coffee cup
He was tryin' to keep his courage up
By applyin' booze

And talk was small when they talked at all
They both knew what they wanted
There was no need to talk about it
They were old enough to scope it out
And keep it loose

She said, ";You don't look like my type
But I guess you'll do";

And he said, ";I'll even tell you that I love you
If you want me to";

When they left the bar
They got in his car
And they drove away
He drove to the family inn
She didn't even have to pretend
She didn't know what for

And he went to the desk
And made his request
While she waited outside
Then he came back with the key
She said, ";Give it to me
And I'll unlock the door";

She kept saying
";I've never really done this kind of thing before, have you";

And he said, ";Yes I have
But only a time or two";
