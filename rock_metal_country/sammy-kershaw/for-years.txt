There's a white mark on my hand
Where I wore our wedding band
Had to force myself to lay it down
So I put it in my drawer
Just can't wear that ring no more
I've carried it around for years

There's a picture that I've had
In my wallet hid in back
The one I like the best of me and you
Gonna take it out today
And make myself throw it away
I've carried it around for years

Clean the shelves and sweep the floors
Hide things in the back of drawers
Take down the curtains that you made
Birthday cards and valentines
Everything you ever signed
Take 'em all and throw 'em all awayClean the shelves and sweep the floors
Hide things in the back of drawers
Take down the curtains that you made
But some things you can't put down
Like the way I love you sounds
I'll carry that around for years

There's some things you can't put down
Like the way I love you sounds
I'll carry that around for years
