Bastian/Blackwell
Cardboard sign says ";Yard Sale";, 
Real estate sign says ";sold";
Family picnic table holds all that it can hold
On the grass and on the sidewalk, well there must be half the town
Ain't it funny, how a broken home can bring the prices down

Oh they're sortin' through what's left of you and me
Payin' yard sale prices for each golden memory
Oh I never thought, I'd ever live to see
The way they're sortin' through what's left of you and me

You left two summer dresses in the backyard on the line
A lady just brought them to me, she said she thinks they'll fit just fine
Well, there goes the baby's wagon and the mirror from the hall
I'd better take just one last look before they take it all

Oh they're sortin' through what's left of you and me
Payin' yard sale prices for each golden memory
Oh I never thought, I'd ever live to see
The way they're sortin' through what's left of you and me

Well, I wonder what you'd say if you could see
The way they're sortin' through what's left of you and me
