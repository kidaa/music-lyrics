I've seen the lights down on Sunset Strip
The Caribbean from the deck of a ship
But I've never gone this far before
Stood on a coast where the horizon stops
The Rocky Mountains, I've climbed to the top
But I've never gone this far before

I've been around the world
But never been to where I'm at
And I know girl
This feeling ain't on no map
I've been in love, heart and soul
But when I hold you, all I know is
I've never gone this far beforeI've walked the midnight streets of Spain
The Champs Elyse in the pouring rain
But I've never gone this far before
Not many places I haven't been
But here in your arms at the rainbow's end
Oh I've never gone this far before

I've been around the world
But never been to where I'm at
And I know girl
This feeling ain't on no map
I've been in love, heart and soul
But when I hold you, all I know is
I've never gone this far before
Ooh, I've never gone this far before
