Well I met her out at Murphy's restaurant
She said she was fresh from the farm
And I remember thinkin' for a country girl
That she went pretty well armed
We sat there talkin' by the lobster tank
I ordered her a slow gin fizz
And when them chicken fried steaks arrived
She said I like living like this

So I made her the queen of my double wide trailer
With the polyester curtains and the redwood deck
Times she's run off and I've got to trail her
Dang her black heart and her pretty red neck 

Well a few nights later I run into her
With some stranger on a park bench
She said he rebuilds engines and his name is Earl
He's the Charlie Daniels of the torque wrench
I whispered honey let's just go on home
And have some onion rings and watch TV
And as I walked her to the truck
Earl was cryin' don't you leave me
I told him 

This is the queen of my double wide trailer
With the polyester curtains and the redwood deck
Sometimes shes runs and I've got to trail her
Dang her black heart and her pretty red neck I said this is the queen of my double wide trailer
With the polyester curtains and the redwood deck
Sometimes she runs and I've got to trail her
Dang her black heart and her pretty red neck 

I said this is the queen of my double wide trailer
With the polyester curtains and the redwood deck
Sometimes she runs and I've got to trail her
Dang her black heart and her pretty red neck 

She's the Queen
She's the Queen
