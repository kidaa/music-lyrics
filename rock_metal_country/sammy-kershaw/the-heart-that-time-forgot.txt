Sterling Whipple/Tony MartinTrack 10 - Time 3:09
Just when I feel like a night on the town
Old friends haven't seen you around
And you seem out of my life
And you walk in on the arm of the new man you found
There's no way that I can slip out
Except out of my mind

They say time can heal every broken heart
Well time's had time enough to do it's part
By now I should be over you but I'm not
I'm the man with the heart that time forgotI look away but clear 'cross the loud smokey room
I swear I can smell your perfume
Just like rain on the wind
Your voice plays in my heart like an old favorite tune
No matter how long it's too soon
To see you again

They say time can heal every broken heart
Well time's had time enough to do it's part
By now I should be over you but I'm not
I'm the man with the heart that time forgot
I'm the man with the heart that time forgot
