Sammy Kershaw
Well you broke my heart
Then you said goodbye
You didn't stick around long
Enough to see me cry
I tried to get you on the phone
But you were long gone
Guess I'll just spend a whole bunch
Of nights sittin' all alone

Time and time again
I would let you back in
After foolin' around with
Some of my old friends
You thought it didn't show
And I would never know
That you were up to no good
Every time you walked out the door

You've been playin' with my heart
From the very start
Well we should've had a thing
They couldn't pull apart
You kept me standing in line
For a long long time
Just waitin' for you roamin' love
That should have been all mineYou've been playin' with my heart
From the very start
Well we should've had a thing
They couldn't pull apart
You kept me standing in line
For a long long time
Just waitin' for you roamin' love
That should have been all mine

You kept me standing in line
For a long long time
Just waitin' for you roamin' love
That should have been all mine
Just waitin' for you roamin' love
That should have been all mine
