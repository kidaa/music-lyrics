Josh Leo/Rick Bowles/Pat BunchTrack 7 - Time 3:41
Screeching to a halt in front of your house
The front door opened and your momma peeked out
I saw your silhouette brushing your long hair
Any minute now you'd be slipping downstairs
We were rarin' to go and the night was young
It was paradise from nine to one

We had wild streaks and reckless hearts
We came alive when the town got dark
We did a lot of living and loving under the gun
Oh it was paradise from nine to one
Paradise from nine to one

We had the whole town bettin' on what we'd do
They'd already seen how I looked at you
We'd hit the ground running for the county line
Cause the band was cranking up about that time
We never missed a beat of that rock 'n roll drum
It was paradise from nine to oneWe had wild streaks and reckless hearts
We came alive when the town got dark
We did a lot of living and loving under the gun
Oh it was paradise from nine to one
Paradise from nine to one

We'd tear ourselves away 'round about midnight
Steal a few kisses in a patch of moonlight
I knew your daddy waited up till I got you home
But it was paradise from nine to one

We had wild streaks and reckless hearts
We came alive when the town got dark
We did a lot of living and loving under the gun
Oh it was paradise from nine to one
Paradise from nine to one
Paradise from nine to one
It was paradise from nine to one
It was paradise from nine to one...
