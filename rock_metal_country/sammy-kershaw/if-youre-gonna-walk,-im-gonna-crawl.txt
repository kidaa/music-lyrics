Buddy Cannon/Larry BastianTrack 9 - Time 2:21
I'm a Monday night football, Friday night pool hall guy
I ain't never been one to let a good time pass me by
You're standin' there statin' you're tired of waitin'
My celebratin's gratin' on you
If you feel that way if it'll make you stay
Well here's what I'm gonna do

If you're gonna walk, I'm gonna crawl
You'll see how low a man can go
When his back's against the wall
I'll be grovelin' in the gravel
If you make that taxi call
If you're gonna walk, I'm gonna crawlYou're a one man pure gold genuine good ol' girl
You've been waitin' on me to get tired of my neon world
Now the turn you've taken has got me shakin'
It's a heart breakin' wake up call
Now I'm seein' how you see me
And I feel about shoe top tall

If you're gonna walk, I'm gonna crawl
You'll see how low a man can go
When his back's against the wall
I'll be grovelin' in the gravel
If you make that taxi call
If you're gonna walk, I'm gonna crawl
