I sat up thinkin' late last night
Do they have a way to count the stars
There's a lot of scientific minds
That claim to know what all the answers are
Well if that's the case
How much does the world weigh
Somebody's probably worked it out
You can look up what the experts say
But all you gotta do is look around
You'd be surprised who knows

Ask that woman tryin' to make the rent
And pay the bills and feed the kids
Six months ago their daddy walked away
Ask that man whose family stayed around
'Cause he finally put that bottle down
Now he has to fight that battle every day
Hey, how much does the world weigh

Human spirit is a funny thing
How far it bends before it breaks
To keep the world from caving in
How much strength does it take
Well don't ask meAsk that couple in the waiting room
The doctors say it's still too soon
It's their little girl, all they can do is pray
Ask that little boy who's gotta choose
Mom or Dad, either way he'll lose
They're breakin' up and he thinks he's to blame
Hey, how much does the world weigh

Ask that man hangin' on the cross
His last breath will save the lost
The answer's in the tears on his face
Hey, how much does the world weigh
Well, how much does the world weigh
Well, how much does the world weigh
