Buddy Brock/Kim Williams
Go down the road called Yesterday
Take a left on a Lost Highway
And make a right on Memory Lane
Drive until you feel the pain

And at the river of tears take one last turn
And cross the bridge that just won't burn
A run down house is love's graveyard
That's where you'll find my haunted heart

Well my haunted heart can't rest in peace
It's buried with her memory
And it's a living hell here after dark
All alone with a haunted heartLate at night a slamming door
Shadows move across the floor
Footsteps fall on silent stairs
I hear her call but no one's there

Her photograph hangs by the bed
A grim reminder love is dead
A love I killed just won't depart
It's living in my haunted heart

Well my haunted heart can't rest in peace
It's buried with her memory
And it's a living hell here after dark
All alone with a haunted heart
I said I'm all alone with a haunted heart
