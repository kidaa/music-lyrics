I've just reached a place 
Where the willow don't bend
There's not much more to be said 
It's the top of the end
I am going 
I am going 
I am gone.

I am closing the book 
On the pages and the text
And I don't really care 
Of what happens next
I am just going 
I am going 
I am gone.

I been hanging on threads 
I been playing it straight
Now I've just got to cut loose 
Before it gets late
So I am going 
I am going 
I am gone.

Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
And you'll be fine at the end of the line
All that's gold doesn't shine
Don't you and your own true love ever part"

I been walking the road 
I been living on the edge
Now I've just got to go 
Before I get to the ledge
So I am going 
I am just going 
I am gone.
