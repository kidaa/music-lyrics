I rolled and I tumbled, I cried the whole night long 
I rolled and I tumbled, I cried the whole night long 
Woke up this morning, I must have bet my money wrong 

I got troubles so hard, I can't stand the strain 
I got troubles so hard, I can't stand the strain 
Some young lazy slut has charmed away my brains 

The landscape is glowing, gleaming in the golden light of day 
The landscape is glowing, gleaming in the golden light of day 
I ain't holding nothing back now, I ain't standing in any body's way 

Well, I did all I know just to keep you off my mind 
Well, I did all I know just to keep you off my mind 
Well, I paid and I paid and my suffering heart is always on the line 

Well, I get up in the dawn and I go down and lay in the shade 
I get up in the dawn and I go down and lay in the shade 
I ain't no body's house boy, I ain't no body's well trained maid 

I'm flat out spent, this woman been driving me to tears 
I'm flat out spent, this woman she been driving me to tears 
This woman so crazy, I swear I ain't going to touch another one for years 

Well, the warm weather's coming and the buds are on the vine 
The warm weather's coming, the buds are on the vine 
Ain't nothing so depressing as trying to satisfy this woman of mine 

I got up this morning, saw the rising sun return 
Well, I got up this morning, see the rising sun return 
Sooner or later, you too shall burn 

The night's filled with shadows The years are filled with early doom 
The night is filled with shadows The years are filled with early doom 
I've been conjuring up all these long dead souls from their crumbling tombs 

Let's forgive each other darling,
Let's go down to the greenwood glen 
Let's forgive each other darling Let's go down to the greenwood glen 
Let's put our heads together now Let's put all old matters to an end 

Well, I rolled and I tumbled and I cried the whole night long 
Aah, I rolled and I tumbled and I cried the whole night long 
I woke up this morning and I think I must be traveling wrong
