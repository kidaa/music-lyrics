I had a pony, her  name was Lucifer
She broke a leg and needed shooting
I swear it hurt me more than it could ever have hurted her.

Sometimes I wonder what's going on with me back
You know she got such a sweet disposition
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.

I got a new pony, she knows how to fox-trot, lope and pace
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to fox-trot lope and pace
She got great big hind legs
And long black shaggy hair hanging in her face.

Everybody say you're using voodoo, your feet walk by themselves 
Well, everybody say you're using voodoo, I seen your feet walk by themselves 
Oh baby, that god you been praying to
Is gonna give ya back what you're wishing on someone else.

Come over here pony, I wanna climb up one time on you 
Well, come over here pony, I wanna climb up one time on you 
Well, you're so nasty and you're so bad
But I swear I love you, yes I do.
