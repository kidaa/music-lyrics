I got a wife and five little chillun
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan
With Saro Jane
Saro Jane 
Ain't nothin' to do
But to set down and sing
And rock about my Saro Jane

The boiler busted and the whistle squall
The Captain gone through the hole-in-the-wall
Oh Saro Jane 
Saro Jane
Ain't nothin' to do
But to set down and sing
And rock about my Saro Jane

The engine give a crack and the whistle gave a squall
The engineer gone to the hole-in-the-wall
Saro Jane 
Saro Jane 
Ain't nothin' to do
But to set down and sing
And rock about my Saro Jane

Yankee built boats to shoot them Rebels
My gun's steady gonna hold it level
Saro Jane 
Saro Jane 
But to set down and sing
And rock about my Saro Jane

I got a wife and five little chillun
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan
Saro Jane 
Saro Jane 
Ain't nothin' to do
But to set down and sing
And rock about my Saro Jane
