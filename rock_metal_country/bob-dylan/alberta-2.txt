Alberta, let your hair hang low, Alberta, let your hair hang low, 
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
If you'll only let your hair hang low.

Alberta, what's on your mind, Alberta, what's on your mind 
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time
Alberta, what's on your mind 

Alberta, don't you treat me unkind, Alberta, don't you treat me unkind 
My heart is so sad because I want you so bad
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind 

Alberta, let your hair hang low, Alberta, let your hair hang low, 
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
If you'll only let your hair hang low.
