The cat's in the well the wolf is looking down
The cat's in the well the wolf is looking down
He got a big bushy tail dragging all over the ground.

The cat's in the well the gentle lady is asleep
Cat's in the well gentle lady is asleep
She ain't hearing things silence is-a-stickin' her deep.

Cat's in the well and grief is showing it's face
The world's been slaughtered it's such a bloody disgrace.

The cat's in the well horses going bumpety bump
The cat's in the well horses going bumpety bump
But God is silent doing the American jump.

Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news
His hair's falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.

The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull
Tonight is so long and the table is oh so full.

The cat's in the well and the servant's at the door
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war.

The cat's in the well and leaves are starting to fall
The cat's in the well and leaves are starting to fall
Goodnight my love may lord have mercy on us all.
