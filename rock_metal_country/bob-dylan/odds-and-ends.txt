I plan it all and I take my place
You break your promise all over the place
You promised to love me but what do I see 
Just you comin' in and spillin' juice over me
Odds and ends, odds and ends 
Lost time is not found again.

Now you take your file and you bend my head
I never can remember anything that you said
You promised to love me, but what do I know 
You're spillin' juice on me like you got some place to go
Odds and ends, odds and ends 
Lost time is not found again.

Now I've had enough, my box is clean
You know what I'm sayin' and you know what I mean
From now on you'd best get on some-one else
While you're doin' it, keep that juice to yourself
Odds and ends, odds and ends 
Lost time is not found again.
