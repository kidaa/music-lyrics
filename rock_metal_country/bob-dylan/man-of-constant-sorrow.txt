I am a man of constant sorrow
I've seen trouble all my days
I'll say goodbye to Colorado 
Where I was born and partly raised.

Your mother says I'm a stranger 
My face you'll never see no more
But there's one promise, darling: 
I'll see you on God's golden shore.

Through this open world I'm about to trouble 
Through ice and snows, sleet and rain
I'm about to ride that morning railroad
Perhaps I'll die on that train.

I'm going back to Colorado 
The place that I started from
If I had known how bad you'd treat me honey 
I never would have come.
