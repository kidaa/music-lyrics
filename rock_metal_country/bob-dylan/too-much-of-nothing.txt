Too much of nothing 
Can make a man ill at ease
One man's temper might rise 
While another man's temper might freeze
In the day of confession 
We cannot mock a soul
Oh, when there's too much of nothing 
No one has control.

Say hello to Valerie 
Say hello to Vivian 
Give them all my salary
On the waters of oblivion.

When there's too much of nothing 
It can cause a man to weep
He can walk the streets and boast like 
Of what he'd like to keep
But it's all been done before 
It's all been written in the book
And where there's too much of nothing 
Nobody should look.

Say hello to Valerie 
Say hello to Vivian 
Give them all my salary
On the waters of oblivion.

And too much of nothing can make a man a liar
It can cause one man to sleep on nails 
It can cause others to eat fire
Everybody's doin' somethin' 
I heard it in a dream
But when there's too much of nothing 
It just makes a fella mean.

Say hello to Valerie 
Say hello to Vivian 
Give them all my salary
On the waters of oblivion.
