In the lonely night in the blinking stardust of a pale blue light
You're coming through to me in black and white when we were made of dreams
You're blowin' down a shaky street you're hearing my heart beat
In the record breaking heat where we were born in time.

Not one more night not one more kiss
Not this time babe no more of this
Takes too much skill takes too much of will
It's too reavealing.

You came you saw just like the law
You married young just like you ma
You tried and tried you made me slide
You left me reeling with this feeling

On the rising curve where the ways of nature will test every nerve
You don't get anything you don't deserve where we were born in time.

You pressed me once you pressed me twice
You hung the blade you'll pay the price
Oh babe that fire is still smoking.

You were snow you were rain
You were striped you were plain
Oh babe truer words have not been spoken
Or broken.

If there's a mystery in the foggy world of destiny
You can have what's left of me where we were born in time.
