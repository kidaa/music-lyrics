Under that apple suckling tree, oh yeah, under that apple suckling tree
Oh yeah ! Underneath that tree, there's just gonna be you and me
Under that apple suckling tree, oh yeah !

Old man sailin' in a dinghy boat
Down there
Old man sailin' in a dinghy boat
On there
Gonna pull man down on a suckling hook
Gonna pull man into the suckling brook
Oh yeah !

Now, he's underneath that apple suckling tree
Oh yeah ! 
Under that apple suckling tree
Oh yeah !
That's underneath that tree
There's gonna be just you and me
Underneath that apple suckling tree.

I push him back and I stand in line 
Oh yeah 
Then I hush my Sadie and stand in line 
Oh yeah
Then I hush my Sadie and stand in line
I get on board in two-eyed time 
Oh yeah !

Now, who's on the table, who's tell me  
Oh yeah
Who's on the table, who's tell me  
Oh yeah
Who should I tell, oh, who should I tell 
The forty-nine of you like bats out of hell
Oh, underneath that old apple suckling tree.
