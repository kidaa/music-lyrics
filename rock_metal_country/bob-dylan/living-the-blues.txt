Since you've been gone
I've been walking around
With my head bowed down to my shoes
I've been living the blues every night without you.

I don't have to go far
To know where you are
Strangers all give me the news
I've been living the blues every night without you.

I think that it's best
I soon get some rest
And forget my pride, but I can't deny
This feeling that I carry for you deep down inside.

If you'd see me this way
You'd come back and you'd stay
Oh, how could you refuse 
I've been living the blues every night without you.

I think that it's best
I soon get some rest
And forget my pride, but I can't deny
This feeling that I carry for you deep down inside.

If you'd see me this way
You'd come back and you'd stay
Oh, how could you refuse 
I've been living the blues every night without you.
