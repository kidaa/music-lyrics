Twilight on the frozen lake 
A north wind about to break
On the footprints in the snow 
Silence down below.

You're beautiful beyond words 
You're beautiful to me
You can make me cry 
Never say goodbye.

Because my dreams are made 
Of iron and steel
With a big boquet of roses hanging down
From the heavens to the ground.

The crashing waves roll over me 
As I stand upon the sand
And wait for you to come 
Grab hold of my hand.

Oh baby, baby, baby blue 
You'll change your last name too
You turned your hair to brown 
Love to see it hanging down.
