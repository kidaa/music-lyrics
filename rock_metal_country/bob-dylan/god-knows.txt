God knows you ain't pretty
God knows it's true
God knows there ain't anybody ever gonna take the place of you.

God knows it's a struggle
God knows it's a crime
God knows there gonna be no more water but fire next time.

God don't call it treason
God don't call it wrong
You're supposed to last a season
But its so strong for so long.

God knows it's fragile
God knows everything
God knows it could snap apart right now just like putting scissors to a string.

God knows it's terrifying
God sees it all unfold
There's a million reasons for you to be crying
You've been so bold and so cold.

God knows you when you see it
God knows you've got to weep
God knows the secrets of your heart
He'll tell them to you when you're asleep.

God knows there's a river
God knows how to make a flow
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.

God knows there's a purpose
God knows there's a chance
God knows you can raise above the darkest hour of every circumstance.

God knows there's a heaven
God knows it's out of sight
God knows we can get all the way from here today
if we gonna walk a million miles by candlelight.
