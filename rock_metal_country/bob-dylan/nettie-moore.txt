Lost John's sitting on a railroad track 
Some thing's out of whack 
Blues this morning falling down like hail 
Gonna leave a greasy trail 

Gonna travel the world is what I'm gonna do 
Then come back and see you. 
All I ever do is struggle and strive. 
If I don't do anybody any harm, I might make it back home alive. 

I'm the oldest son of a crazy man, 
I'm in a cowboy band 
Got a pile of sins to pay for and I ain't got time to hide 
I'd walk through a blazing fire, baby, if I knew you was on the other side 

Oh, I miss you, Nettie Moore 
And my happiness is over 
Winter's gone, the river's on the rise 
I loved you then, and ever shall 
But there's no one left here to tell 
The world has gone black before my eyes 

Well, the world of research has gone berserk 
Too much paperwork 
Albert's in the graveyard, Frankie's raising hell 
I'm beginning to believe what the scriptures tell 

I've gone where the Southern crosses The Yellow Dog 
Get away from all these demagogues 
And these bad luck women stick like glue 
It's either one or the other or neither of the two 

She says, "Look out, Daddy, don't want you to tear your pants. 
You could get wrecked in this dance." 
They say whisky will kill you, but I don't think it will 
I'm riding with you to the top of the hill 

Oh, I miss you, Nettie Moore 
And my happiness is over 
Winter's gone, the river's on the rise 
I loved you then, and ever shall 
But there's no one left here to tell 
The world has gone black before my eyes 

Don't know why my baby never looked so good before 
Don't have to wonder no more 
She's been cooking all day, it going to take me all night 
I can't eat all that stuff in a single bite 

The judge's coming in, everybody rise 
Lift up your eyes 
You can do what you please, you don't need my advice 
Before you call me any dirty names, you better think twice 

Getting light outside, the temperature dropped 
I think the rain has stopped 
I'm going make you come to grips with fate 
When I'm through with you, you'll learn to keep your business straight 

Oh, I miss you, Nettie Moore 
And my happiness is over 
Winter's gone, the river's on the rise 
I loved you then, and ever shall 
But there's no one left here to tell 
The world has gone black before my eyes 

The bright spark of the steady lights 
Has dimmed my sights 
When you're around me all my grief gives away 
A life time with you is like some heavenly day 

Everything I've ever known to be right has been proven wrong 
I'll be drifting along 
The woman I'm loving she rules my heart 
No knife could ever cut our love apart. 

Today I'll stand in faith and raise 
The voice of praise 
The sun is strong, I'm standing in the light 
I wish to God that it were night 

The world has gone black before my eyes.
