As I travel down life's pathway
Know not what the years may hold
As I ponder hopes grow fonder
Precious memories flood my soul
Precious memories how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious memories sacred scenes unfold.

Precious father loving mother
Glide across the lonely years
And old home scenes of my childhood
In fond memories appears
Precious memories how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious memories sacred scenes unfold.
