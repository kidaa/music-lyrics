I couldn't sleep
Took a walk down 2nd Avenue
Sick of dreaming dreams that never come true
One way street and I know where its leading to
There's a  For Sale  sign on the front door of the city hall
The subway line got graffiti crawling off the wall
I could take a hit but I ain't gonna take the fall
That's just one side of the story
In the two story town

Chorus:
It's just the same old sights
And the same old sounds
I'm gonna take my car and drive out of this two story town
The same old ship, it's going 'round
I'm going down, down, down, down, down
In a two story town

There's a girl that I sleep with
Got ecstasy eyes
He promised her roses and American pie
I called her and my demons
I kissed them both goodbye
Seven days of Monday morning
In this two story town

Chorus

One shot to make a move now
The ghosts are calling me out

And me I'm just one story
In a two story town
But you're never gonna find me in the lost and found

Chorus

Chorus 2:
It's just the same old sights and the same old sounds
I'm gonna take my horse and ride him off this merry-go-round
I won't give in and I won't back down
I'm going down, down, down, down down
Never going down, down, down, down, down
I ain't going down, down, down, down, down
In a two story town
In this two story town
