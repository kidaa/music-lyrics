An angel's smile is what you sell 
You promise me heaven, then put me through hell 
Chains of love got a hold on me 
When passion's a prison, you can't break free 

You're a loaded gun 
There's nowhere to run 
No one can save me 
The damage is done 

[Chorus:]
Shot through the heart 
And you're to blame 
You give love a bad name 
I play my part and you play your game 
You give love a bad name 
You give love a bad name 

Paint your smile on your lips 
Blood red nails on your fingertips 
A school boy's dream, you act so shy 
Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye 

You're a loaded gun 
There's nowhere to run 
No one can save me 
The damage is done 

[Chorus]
