How do you spend your minutes on the matters
All tomorrows come from yesterday's
When you're feeling broke and bruised and sometimes shattered
Blew out the candles on the cake, like everything's a big mistake
It seems you always wait for life to happen
And your last buck can't buy a lucky break
If all we've got is us then lifes worth living
And if your in, you know I'm in
I'm ready and I'm winning

[Chorus]
I Am
When you think that no-one needs you
See if anyone believes you
No ones there to understand
I Am
I'll be there to be that someone
When you think that no one, is there to hold your hand
I Am

We're just who we are, there's no pretending
It takes a while to learn to live in your own skin
Say a prayer that we might find our happy ending
And if your in, you know I'm in
I'm ready and I'm winning

[Chorus]

And I aint got no halo hanging over my head
I aint gonna judge you, I'm just here to love you
I Am
I Am

[Chorus x2]
