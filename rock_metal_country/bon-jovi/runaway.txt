On the street where you live girls talk about their social lives.
They're made of lipstick, plastic and paint, a touch of sable in their eyes.
ALL YOUR LIFE All your life all you've asked when's your Daddy gonna talk to you.
You were living in another world tryin' to get your message through.

No one heard a single word you said.
They should have seen it in your eyes
what was going around your heart.

Ooh, she's a little runaway.
Daddy's girl learned fast
all those things he couldn't say.
Ooh, she's a little runaway.

A different line every night guaranteed to blow your mind.
See you out on the streets, call me for a wild time.
So you sit home alone 'cause there's nothing left that you can do.
There's only pictures hung in the shadows left there to look at you.

You know she likes the lights at nights on the neon Broadway signs
She don't really mind,
it's only love she hoped to find.

Ooh, she's a little runaway.
Daddy's girl learned fast
all those things he couldn't say.
Ooh, she's a little runaway.

No one heard a single word she said.
They should have seen it in your eyes
what was going around your heart.

Ooh, she's a little runaway.
Daddy's girl learned fast
all those things he couldn't say.

Ooh, she's a little runaway.
Daddy's girl learned fast,
now she works the night away.

Ooh, she's a little runaway.
Daddy's girl learned fast
all those things he couldn't say.

Ooh, she's a little runaway.
Daddy's girl learned fast,
now she works the night away
