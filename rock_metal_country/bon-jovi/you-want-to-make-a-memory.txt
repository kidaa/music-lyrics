Hello again, its you and me
Kinda always like it used to be
Sippin' wine, killing time
Trying to solve lifes mysteries.
Hows your life, its been a while
God its good to see you smile
I see you reaching for your keys
Looking for a reason not to leave.

If you dont know if you should stay
If you dont say whats on your mind
Baby just, breathe theres no where else tonight we should be-
You wanna make a memory.

I dug up this old photograph
Look at all that hair we had
Its bittersweet to hear you laugh
Your phone is ringing, I dont wanna ask.

If you go now, Ill understand
If you stay, hey, I got a plan
You wanna make a memory
You wanna steal a piece of time
You could sing a melody to me 
And I could write a couple lines
You wanna make a memory.
