Hey Patty Garrett that's what I used to call you 
They tell me you want me but I hear they've got you 
They made you a lawman with a badge made of silver 
They paid you some money to sell them my blood 

But you say, this ain't about me and this ain't about you 
Or the good and the bad times we've both been through 
When the lines between brothers and justice have changed 
You do what you've gotta cause you can't walk away 

Wonder what would of have happened if you were the killer and I was the hero 
Would things be the same  
Or would I have traded your life for my own life  
Would I have paid your debts in your place  
I don't know 

But this ain't about me and this ain't about you 
Or the good and the bad times we've both been through 
When the lines between brothers and justice have changed 
You do what you've gotta cause you can't walk away 

Blood money, that's what I call it 
'Cause money for blood ain't no fair exchange 
Blood money 
Bought and then sold you 
But your conscience is all you can take to your grave
