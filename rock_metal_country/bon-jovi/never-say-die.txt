As we stood there older than men 
And younger than the boys that's right 
We were as still as the wind 
That blows on a hot August night 

And you were lonesome as a jukebox 
But deadly just the same 
I could be as gentle as a newborn 
Then spit into the eye of a hurricane 

And we knew how to laugh 
And we knew how to cry 
Yeah, we sure knew how to live 
But we don't ever 

Never say die, never say die 

I guess you'd say we had a pact 
These words we knew so well that's right 
Still they remained unspoken 
And we'd take them to the fiery gates of hell 

Once I was afraid of love 
But when it's your brother those things change 
'Cause love is just another word for trust 
So hear me when I say 

Never say die, never say no 
You got to look 'em in the eye and don't let go 
When it's your own blood you'll bleed 
And your own tears you'll cry 
When you're brought up to believe 
That it's the strong who survive 
Never say die 

[Guitar solo]

Yeah, and we could run like lightning we could run like lightning 
Through the pouring rain through the rain 
And we'll be standing like a soldier 
Who comes marching home again left, right, left, right 

They ask what it is that I want written they ask what it is that I want written 
On the gravestone where I'll lie on the gravestone where I'll lie 
Tell them it's just my bones that died there tell them it's just my bones that died there 
So save the tears they'll cry so save the tears they'll cry 

My spirit is still riding somewhere's in this night 
And it's these three words that come to me 
As I kiss this world good bye 

Never say die, never say no 
You got to look 'em in the eye and don't let go 
When it's your own blood you'll bleed 
And your own tears you'll cry 
When you're brought up to believe 
That it's the strong who survive 
Never say die, never say die... that's right
