You know your favorite old pair of shoes 
The ones with the hole in the toe you won't lose 
Your favorite record that's all scratched and used 
But still you love to play when your feeling blue 

That faded rose that's all dried out 
Those Bukowski poems we couldn't live without 
Your high school picture when you had wild hair 
That stormy day on the beach that got us here 

And oh, you better believe 
There's just one thing you need, oh, can't you see ... 

It's just me baby, it's just me baby 
There's just one thing that you should keep in your book of dreams 
It's just me baby it's just me 

Just like a shadow 10 feet tall 
Standing right behind you should you fall 
I'll be the one to hold you up to walk 
When this wicked world makes us want to crawl 

And if your waves should ever break at sea 
I'll be there waiting, I'm that sandy beach 
I'm the same old dog, scratching those same fleas 
I'll be by your side, you can count on me 

It's just me baby, it's just me baby 
There's just one thing that you should keep in your book of dreams 
It's just me baby, it's just me baby 
What's it gonna take to make you see  
What's it gonna take 'til you believe in me  oh... 

[Guitar solo]

Oh, how my smile fades and my heart just breaks every time you go away 

But it's just me baby, it's just me baby 
There's one more thing that you should keep in your book of dreams 
It's just me baby, it's just me baby 
What's it gonna take to make you see  
What's it gonna take 'til you believe in me  

And if someday some new memory comes along 
Looking shiny, new, feeling really strong 
You can tell him that I'll tell him he can just move on 
I'm a fighter, I've been fighting for you all night long 
It's just me baby, it's just me,  it's just me baby, it's just me baby
