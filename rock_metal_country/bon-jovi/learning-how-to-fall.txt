I was walking on a wire 
Looking down, there was no net 
Now, I'm standing at your door 
Me and my last cigarette, oh 

Yeah, we've been through this before 
Too late to cover up my tracks 
Damn the fool who begs for more 
I'll take my past and paint it black 

Now this circus has left town 
This clown has gotta get his feet back on the ground 

I'm learning how to fall learning how to fall 
Learning how to take a hit learning how to fall  
I had to walk before I crawled 
It was winner take it all 
Now I'm learning how to fall... learning how to fall 
Yeah, I got the hang of it 

I was standing in the light 
There were faces all around 
I put my gloves up for the fight 
One sucker punch and I was down 

I'm learning how to fall learning how to fall 
Learning how to take a hit learning how to fall 
Had to walk before I crawled 
It was winner take it all 
I'm learning how to fall... learning how to fall 
Yeah, I got the hang of it 

I was flying through the clouds 
Pucker up, it's time to kiss the ground 

I'm learning how to fall learning how to fall 
Learning how to take a hit learning how to fall 
Had to walk before I crawled 
It was winner take it all 
I'm learning how to fall... learning how to fall 
Now I got the hang of it learning how to fall, learning how to fall, learning how to fall 
Yeah I got the hang of it, learning how to fall, learning how to fall, learning how to fall 
Learning how to fall, learning how to fall, learning how to fall, learning how to fall
