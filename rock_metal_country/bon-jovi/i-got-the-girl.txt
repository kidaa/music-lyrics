It feels like I'm walkin' on air
Walk down our street
When the neighbors stop to watch us going by 
You can hear 'em talking let them talk
Sometimes I think that you're the only reason
The sun still shines when it shines
And when this wicked world starts bringing me down
I tell myself that I'm one lucky guy

Chorus:
I got the girl holding all the cards
I got the girl she's a work of art
I got the girl who's gonna break my heart
She likes to wear her stripe with her plaids
Won't brush her hair I swear
She don't like wearing shoes in December
But I don't care what she wears

Chorus

If I was a holy man I'd get down on my knees
So the angels that watch over her would give a break to me
Holy Mother of saint bubble gum and Sister band-aid knees
Won't you please pray for the ones like me
But the truth is someday 
Somebody is gonna take her from me
But the queen of hearts will always be
A five-year-old princess to me to me

Chorus

Chorus 2:
I got the girl she's gonna leave her mark
I got the girl she's a work of art
I got the girl she's gonna break your heart
I got the girl, oh yeah
I got the girl, I got the girl
She's gonnaI got the girl, yeah
I got the girl, I got the girl
I got the girl
