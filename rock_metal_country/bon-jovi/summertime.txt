Feels something like summertime
Top down ain't nothing but time
Radio's on and you're by my side
Feels something like summertime

These days life goes like this
Wake up, check that off of some list
Gotta be a little something more than this
The botton of my coffee cup
I keep a, postcard in the back of my mind
White sand, sunshine
And you sining like a brand new daimond
It's keeping me for giving up
Thinking like I had enough

You make me feel something like summertime
Top down ain't nothing but time
Radio's on and you're by my side
Feels something like summertime
Like a first slow dance and a first long kiss
There ain't nothing baby better then this
It's like a beach blanket and a bottle of wine
It feels something like summertime
Sum-summer-summertime

I was a warm breeze with a cool tan
Life mapped out on the back of my hand
When I was laughing I was making plans
But I didnt laugh when I found you
Theres a heaven baby your the proof

You make me feel something like summertime
Top down ain't nothing but time
Radio's on and you're by my side
Feels something like summertime
Like a first slow dance and a first long kiss
There ain't nothing baby better then this
It's like a beach blanket and a bottle of wine
It feels omething like summertime
Sum-summer-summertime

[Solo]

Feel something like summertime
Top down ain't nothing but time
Radio's on for me and my valentine
It's like that first slow dance and that first long kiss
There ain't nothing baby better then this
It's like a beach blanket and a bottle of wine yeah
Feels something like summertime
Top down ain't nothing but time
Radio's on and you're by my side,
Feels something like summertime
Just like summer time
Sum-sum-sumertime
Something like summertime
