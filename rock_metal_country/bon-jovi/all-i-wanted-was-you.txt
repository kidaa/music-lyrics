The last time that I saw her 
Was the night she said good-bye 
She said that love's a stranger 
And it's sure to pass you by 
As she packed up her belongings 
She wouldn't look me in the eye 
But I could see a tear roll off her face 
As we both tried so hard 
Not to cry she said  

Chorus: 
I never wanted the stars 
I never shot for the moon 
I like them right where they are 
All I wanted was you 
So baby just turn away 
Because I can't face the truth 
All I'm trying to say is 
All I wanted was you    

I tried so hard to remember 
Where when how why love went away 
I tried to drown myself in pity 
But your memory kept calling my name  
I bought you fancy cars and diamond rings 
Baby all the things that money brings 
And the servants to paint the skies blue 
And I worked so hard seven days a week 
Built a fortress for your heart to keep 
If I could I'd wrap these words up for you  

Chorus  

I may have built for you a dream house 
But never thought you were alone 
I filled the party up with company 
But never made our house a home   
All I got is my guitar these chords and the truth 
All I got is my guitar ... but all I want is you
