They say that no man is an island 
And good things come to those who wait 
But the things I hear are there just to remind me 
Every dog will have his day 

The spirits, they intoxicate me 
I watched them infiltrate my soul 
They try to say it's too late for me 
Tell my guns I'm coming home 

I swear I'm gonna live forever 
Tell my maker he can wait 
I'm riding somewhere south of heaven 
Heading back to Santa Fe 
It's judgment day in Santa Fe 

Once I was promised absolution 
There's only one solution for my sins 
You gotta face your ghosts and know with no illusions 
That only one of you is going home again 

And I blame this world for making a good man evil 
It's this world that can drive a good man mad 
And it's this world that turns a killer into a hero 
Well I blame this world for making a good man bad 

Now I ain't getting into heaven if the devil has his way 
I swear I'm gonna live forever 
Heading back to Santa Fe 
Got debts to pay in Santa Fe 
It's judgment day in Santa Fe 
Lord have mercy 

[Guitar solo]

So I save a prayer when I need it most 
To the Father, Son and the Holy Ghost 
And sign it from a sinner with no name 
When I meet my maker 
Will he close the book on the hearts I broke and the lives I took  
Will he walk away 'cause my soul's too late to save  

Now I ain't getting into heaven 
If the devil has his way 
I swear I'm gonna live forever 
Heading back to Santa Fe 
Got debts to pay in Santa Fe 
It's judgment day in Santa Fe
