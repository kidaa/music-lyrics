Once upon a time 
Not so long ago 

Tommy used to work on the docks 
Union's been on strike 
He's down on his luck...it's tough, so tough 
Gina works the diner all day 
Working for her man, she brings home her pay 
For love - for love 

She says we've got to hold on to what we've got 
'Cause it doesn't make a difference 
If we make it or not 
We've got each other and that's a lot 
For love - we'll give it a shot 

[Chorus:]
Whooah,  we're half way there 
Livin' on a prayer 
Take my hand and we'll make it - I swear 
Livin' on a prayer 

Tommy's got his six string in hock 
Now he's holding in what he used 
To make it talk - so tough, it's tough 
Gina dreams of running away 
When she cries in the night 
Tommy whispers baby it's okay, someday 

We've got to hold on to what we've got 
'Cause it doesn't make a difference 
If we make it or not 
We've got each other and that's a lot 
For love - we'll give it a shot 

[Chorus]

We've got to hold on ready or not 
You live for the fight when it's all that you've got 

[Chorus]
