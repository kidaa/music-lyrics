It's all the same, only the names will change 
Everyday it seems we're wasting away 
Another place where the faces are so cold 
I'd drive all night just to get back home 

[Chorus:]
I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride 
I'm wanted dead or alive 
Wanted dead or alive 

Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days 
And the people I meet always go their separate ways 
Sometimes you tell the day 
By the bottle that you drink 
And times when you're all alone all you do is think 

[Chorus]

I walk these streets, a loaded six string on my back 
I play for keeps, 'cause I might not make it back 
I been everywhere, still I'm standing tall 
I've seen a million faces an I've rocked them all 

I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride 
I'm wanted dead or alive 
I'm a cowboy, I got the night on my side 
I'm wanted dead or alive 
Wanted dead or alive
