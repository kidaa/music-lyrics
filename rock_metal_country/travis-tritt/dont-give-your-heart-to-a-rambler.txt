Jimmie Skinner
Don't fall in love with me darlin', I'm a rambler
Though you are the sweetest sweetheart in this world
It's all for your sake dear that I'm leavin'
So, don't give your heart to a rambler, little girl

Well I handed you a lie and now I'm sorry
You're just a little sweeter than the rest
Believe me when I say I don't want to hurt you
Or do anything to spoil your happiness

Repeat Chorus

If I ever get the blues, now sweet baby
Or the lure of the highway on my mind
I long to hear that whistle of the freight train
And the boxcars as they rattle down the line

Repeat Chorus Twice

Yeah, don't you give your heart to a rambler, little girl
