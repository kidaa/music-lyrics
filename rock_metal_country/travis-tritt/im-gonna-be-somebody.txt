Bobby  played his guitar on the harder side of town
Where it's hard for the poor boy to find the money
He had dedication, he had the heart and soul
Somehow knew he was born to play

People said ";Get a real job, support your family
'Cause there's no future in the road you're taking";
He never said a word, the dreamer just kept on
But late at night you could hear him say
He said

";I'm gonna be somebody
One of these days I'm gonna break these chains
I'm gonna be somebody someday
You could bet your hard earned dollar I will

The road was a struggle, took him ten years to the top
Now he's #1 on the stage and the radio
Still he can't believe how they come from miles around
When it only seems like yesterday he was sayin'

";I'm gonna be somebody
One of these days I'm fonna break these chains
I'm gonna be somebody someday
You could bet your hard earned dollar I will";

Bobby played his hometown one full moon August night
When he heard a voice in the front row singin'
It was a sandy- haired Rebel boy with the same old hungry eyes
Looked up at Bobby and said

";I'm gonna be somebody
One of these days I'm gonna break these chains
I'm gonna be somebody someday
You could bet your hard earned dollar I will";

Mmmmmm

";I'm gonna be somebody
One of these days I'm gonna break these chains
I'm gonna be somebody
You could bet your hard earned dollar I will";

Oh, yes I will

You could bet your hard earned dollar
I will
