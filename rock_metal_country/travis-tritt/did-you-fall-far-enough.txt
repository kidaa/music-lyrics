Travis Tritt/Troy Seals
As I watch you while you're sleeping
You don't know what I'm going through
Dealing with all my emotions
And wondering if your love is true
You've given me no cause to doubt you
And I know passion burns in your heart
But does that same fire keep on burning
In the hours that we spend apart

If you knew the question
That burns in my mind
Then you'd know why I worry so much
I can't help but wonder
When we fell in love Sweetheart
Did you fall far enough

There's something I feel when I touch you
And that's when I really get scared
'Cause I know there's men who would die for
The feeling I'm feeling right here
Oh I'll be tormented forever
Unless I can give my fear up
I've got to stop acting so foolish
I've tortured myself long enoughIf you knew the question
That burns in my mind
Then you'd know why I worry so much
I can't help but wonder
When we fell in love Sweetheart
Did you fall far enough

If you knew the question
That burns in my mind
Then you'd know why I worry so much
I can't help but wonder
When we fell in love Sweetheart
Did you fall far enough
