Well I got a buddy at the factory
I know him and he knows me
We were talking on the line today
You wouldn't believe what he had to say
I told him all about you
He said man that's strange she's my girl too

Well hello baby it's me again
You country daddy you sweet boyfriend
Guess what I heard out on the street
Yeah, they say you've been two-timing me
And if it's true you're running 'round
You've got double trouble coming down

You've got double trouble can't you see
You can't be in love with him
And veer around with me
You've got one man in the country
And one man in the town
You've got double trouble coming down

I'm sorry pal I didn't know
Well that's okay she's hit the road
I can't believe she'd be so cruel
Yeah she made us both look like a fool
She played her game until she found
She had double trouble coming downShe had double trouble you and me
Got lots of lovin' left to do
There's more fish in the sea
She had one man in the country
And one man in the town
She had double trouble coming down

She had double trouble can't you see
She couldn't be in love with you
And play around with me
She had one man in the country
And one main in the town
She had double trouble coming down

Yeah she thought that I'd be easy
She thought I'd be her clown
She had double trouble coming down
