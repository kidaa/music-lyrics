Chorus: 
Well its a long way to Richmond rollin up on 95.
With a red head ridin shot-gun and a pistol by my side.
Tearin down that highway like a modern day Bonnie and Clyde.

We met at a truck stop, Johnson City Tennessee. I was gasin up my Firebird when 
I heard her calling me. Said which way are you headed boy..Do you need some 
company.

She had me stoppin at a Quick Mart before we made it out of town. Next thing 
she was runnin at me tellin me to lay that hammer down cuz theres a man right 
behind me doing his best to slow me down.

Chorus: 
Well its a long way to Richmond rollin up on 95.
With a red head ridin shot-gun and a pistol by my side.
Tearin down that highway like a modern day Bonnie and Clyde.

Well we pulled up to a motel in the middle of the night. We were countin all 
the money, smokin stolen Marlboro Lights. Lord we never saw em coming till they 
read us both our rights.

and its a long way to richmond rollin up on 95.. With a sherriff right beside 
me, pistol pointed at my side

Such a dissapointing ending for this modern day Bonnie and Clyde.
