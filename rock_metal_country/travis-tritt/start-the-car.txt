Well I'm tired of the pressure, so tired of the pace
Just want to grab you baby, and get out of this race
I got no chance of makin' it, workin' downtown
And walkin' slow and talkin' low
I'm tired of goin' down...and down, and down
Yeah!

Start the car, we gotta move
This ain't no livin', this ain't no groove
It's been a long, hard road
Come on baby, drive it home
Start the car

Well, started out for paradise, ain't no promised land
This ain't no kinda livin' for an honest workin' man
There's people dyin' on the streets, they never make the news
My love is livin' up on the hill, singin' the white boy blues
Whoa yeah!

Start the car, we gotta move
This ain't no livin', this ain't no groove
The city's rich, we're dirt poor, somewhere waitin'
There's somethin' more
Start the car
Oh, yeah!

Well, goin' out with dignity, goin' out with style
We'll lay down that hammer baby and make our own road, across the miles
Cause I can't take this town, one more day baby, yeah!

Start the car, we gotta move
This ain't no livin', this ain't no groove
The city's rich, we're dirt poor, somewhere waitin'
There's gotta be somethin' more

Start the car, we gotta move
This ain't no livin', this ain't no groove
It's been a long, hard road
Come on baby, drive it home
Start the car

Yeah! Start the car baby...yeah! 
Uh uh...Ah baby

Start the car
Hoo...Start the car baby
Well, come on baby start the car
Whoa...
