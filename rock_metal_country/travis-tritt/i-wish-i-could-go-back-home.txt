Chorus:
I wish I could go back home
I'm so tired of living all alone
I left to sow my wilder seeds
Now look at all the pain I've grown
I wish I could go back home

It breaks my heart to see her cry
That's how I left her when I said good bye
I never meant to be so cruel
How could I have been such a fool
I got scared when love drew close
Turns out her love is what i'm needing most
Instead I'm back out on my own
Wishing I could go back home

Chorus

She waited as long as she could stand
Finally gave up and found another man
And he's getting love that once was mine
I can't believe I've been so blind
What goes around comes back they say
But I'd trade my future for one yesterday
We had a good thing now it's gone
Lord, I wish I could go back homeChorus

We had a good thing now it's gone

Lord, I wish I could go back home
