Paul Kennerley/Marty Stuart
Well first you said that you loved me
You swore that you'd be true
Never leave me lonesome
But that's just what you do
You go out honky tonkin'
All over town
With every step you take you just keep
Draggin' my heart around

I believe I'm slowly sinking
Feel I'm going down
It's bound to be the death of me
If you keep draggin' my heart around

The stars out on the water
That ol' moon up in the sky
They hang their heads in sorrow
Each time you pass me by
The way you hurt me darlin'
I believe I'll come unwound
I can't go on much longer
If you keep draggin' my heart aroundI believe I'm slowly sinking
Feel I'm going down
It's bound to be the death of me
If you keep draggin' my heart around

I believe I'm slowly sinking
Feel I'm going down
It's bound to be the death of me
If you keep draggin' my heart around
Keep draggin' my heart around
'Round and 'round and 'round
