Verse 1 

My baby knows me better than i do
Funny how a woman has that over a man
I can do anything with her beside me
Leaning on her is where I make my stand

Chorus

Where would we be without the love of a woman
Standing behind her man even when he's wrong
The true pure undying love of a woman
Makes a man a fool to think he can make it alone.

Verse 2

My daddy was a wild one when he was younger
Everybody told my mam he'd be hard to tame
Full of himself, he said sir to nobody
But you outta see him come runnin' when mama calls his name

Repeat Chorus
Whoa ya

Verse 3

A man goes crazy trying to catch his feelings
Too much pride and maybe the words come out wrong
But that's ok cause he's still her hero
Steady as a rock her love keeps rolling along

Repeat Chorus

Makes a man a fool to think he can make it alone
hmmmmmmm
