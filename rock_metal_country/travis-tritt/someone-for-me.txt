Travis Tritt, Stewart Harris
As I walk down this road, the rain is just starting to fall
How in the world did I let myself get so alone
I can't tell any difference
Between my tears and the rain falling down
It's hell when your heart is in need of someone all its own

I need/From someone with a heart just like mine
And someone who's trying to find true love
Everywhere that I go I see people in love
The way that I wanted to be
Tell me when will I have a love of my own
Will there ever be someone for me

As I sit with the rain coming down
All the memories surround me
Pieces of past loves and fast times keep haunting my mind
If I just had somebody to erase all the memories
Of yesterday's loves gone wrong
Oh, God, please have mercy, it's true love I'm looking to find

Repeat Chorus

Tell me when will I have a love of my own
Will there ever be someone for me
