Travis Tritt
She stayed up all night and cried into her pillow
And fought off the urge to just break down and call
Last night to find the fault seemed so darn easy
But now who's to blame don't matter much at all
She thinks if she calls him, it just shows weakness
So the hurt goes on with every tear she's cried
Ain't it sad to see a good love fall to pieces
Chalk another heartbreak up to foolish pride

Turn out the lights, the competition's over
The stubborn souls are the losers here tonight
And while the bridges burn
Another hard hard lesson's learned
As in the ashes, passion slowly dies
And this romance goes down to foolish prideHe relives every word they spoke in anger
He walks to floor and punches out the wall
To apologize to her, would be so simple
But instead he cries, 'I'll be damned if I crawl'
If he loses her, he's lost his best friend
And more than just a lover can provide
So he wrestles with emotions that defeat him
Chalk another love lost up to foolish pride

Repeat Chorus
