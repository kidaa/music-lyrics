Written by Bruce Springsteen

Well it's Saturday night
You're all dressed up in blue
I've been watchin' you a while
Maybe you're watchin' me too
So somebody ran out
Left someone's heart in a mess
Well if you're ready for love
Honey I'm tougher than the rest

Some girls want a handsome Dan
Or some good-lookin' Joe
On their arm, some girls like
A sweet-talking Romeo
Well around here baby
I learned you get what you can get
So if you're ready for love
Honey I'm tougher than the restWell the road is dark
And it's a thin, thin line
But I want you to know
I'll walk it for you any time
Maybe your other boyfriends
Couldn't pass the test
But if you're ready for love
Honey I'm tougher than the rest

Well it ain't no secret
I've been around a time or two
Well I don't know baby
Maybe you've been around too
But there's another dance 
All you gotta do is say yes
And if you're ready for love
Honey I'm tougher than the rest

If you're sure you're ready for love
Honey I'm tougher than the rest
