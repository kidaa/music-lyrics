Buddy Bue, J.R. Cobb
Guitars ring in the dead of night, sing so blue, sound so right
It makes you homesick
Listen close to the guitar man, narive sone of a foreign land
The boy's homesick

He's homesick, for days bygone
Homesick, for home sweet home

Where were you in '69, smokin' dope, drinkin' wine
Just an outlaw
Distant drums beats an old refrain, shakes your feet, pounds your brain
Like a buzzsaw

In the darkness down the hall, black-light posters on the wall
Jimi Hendrix
Someone's lost in yesterday, hazy dreams of Monterey
And Woodstock, all right

Repeat Chorus

Guitars ring in the dead of night, sing so blue, sound so right
It makes you homesick
Listen close to the guitar man, narive sone of a foreign land
The boy's homesick

He's homesick, for days bygone
Homesick, Lord, for home sweet home The boy's homesick
