Girl I know you see me
As a man who's strong and never filled with doubt
But your love gives me courage
You don't realize I can't be strong without
And though I try to hide it
You see right through my vulnerabilities
So as long as you're beside me
I'm all the man I'll ever need to be

I find myself daydreamin'
Longing hard to be your Superman
But then my dreams are realized
When your kiss tells me I already am
Sweetheart, I may not ever know
Exactly what it is you see in me
And why you think, with all my faults
I'm all the man I'll ever need to beAnd in my darkest hour
You can always see the dawn
Your trust in me has power
Like none I've ever known

Well I may get discouraged
My worried mind gets tired and beaten down
But I won't be depressed for long
'Cause you know how to get me off the ground
I really shouldn't question
You've shown me all I'll ever need to see
I should just thank God in heaven
I'm all the man I'll ever need to be

I should just thank God in heaven
I'm all the man I'll ever need to be
