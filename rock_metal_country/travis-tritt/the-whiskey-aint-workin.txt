Ronny Scaife, Marty Stuart
There was a time, I could drink my cares away
And drown out all of the heartaches
That hurt me night and day
When the thought of you came crashing thruough
I'd have one more
But now the whiskey ain't workin' anymore

I need one good honky-tonk angel
To turn my life around
That's reason enough for me to lay
This ol' bottle down
A woman warm and willin', that's what I'm lookin' for
'Cause the whiskey ain't workin' anymore

They knew my name at every bar in town
And they knew all the reasons why I comin' 'round
'Cause in my mind, peace I'd find when they'd start to pour
But now the whiskey ain't workin' anymore

Repeat Chorus

Lord, the whiskey ain't workin' anymore
That's for sure.....
