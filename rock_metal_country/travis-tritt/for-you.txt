You don't ask for much
And I tremble at the touch of your sweet hand
When I look into your eyes
I realize I'm such a lucky man
You've shown me love I never knew
And there is nothing I won't do for you
I'd almost given up 
On the hope of having someone of my own
But you came into my life
And you made this empty house into a home
I could never ask for more
And every day I'm thankful for you

The first time that I held you girl
I knew that it was real
And now I wake up every morning
Knowing what it's like to feel
So much love for youAs the years go passing by
There'll be lows and highs
That we'll go through
But I can close my eyes and rest
'Cause come what may I'm blessed if I have you
As time paints silver in our hair
Just turn around, I'll still be there for you

You've shown me love I never knew
And there is nothing I won't do for you
