Chorus:
I'm a little rough around the edges
I didn't come out of no GQ magazine
I don't use a lot of big words
But I'm bent on love if you know what I mean
I ain't in'trested in bein' politically correct
I stand right up and say what I believe

I'm a little rough around the edges, but I think I'm exactly what you need

As you can see, I ain't all spit and polish
And every hair on my head ain't in its place
I ain't got no big degree from college
And I guess to tell the truth I need a shave

Chorus

Whoa!

Well you may think I'm just a KC plowboy
Well just give me a chance to strut my stuff
I don't shine like some pin-up poster cowboy
But neither does a diamond when you pick it up

Chorus

I'm a little rough around the edges, but I think I'm exactly what you need

Yeah! Yeah! Whoa!
