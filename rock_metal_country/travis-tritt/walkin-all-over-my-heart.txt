Al Gore, Paul Overstreet
I'm so glad you found me
Wrapped your sweet love around me
And helped me to make a new start
I was down on the bottom
Sad stories, Lord, I've got 'em
She was walkin' all over my heart

She was cheatin', she was lyin'
Alibis, I kept buyin'
It was tearin' my whole world apart
And like the fool she made of me
I kept thinkin' that she loved me
But she was walkin' all over my heartOh, today more than ever
I believe love's forever
And it's you who brought back that spark
So, I'm stickin' with our love
I was so sick and tired of
Her walkin' all over my heart

Repeat Chorus
