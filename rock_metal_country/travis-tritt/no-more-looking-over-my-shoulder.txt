Written by Michael Peterson & Craig Wiseman

As a child I was told that I was destined to be nothing
Growing wild as I got older I fulfilled what had been said
Hiding ignorance and fear I prayed nobody saw me bluffing
But I was laying the foundation for a future I would dread
Yeah

Seems like every choice I made would somehow leave me second-guessing
'Bout the green grass I was passing racing toward the other side
I thank God for the blessing
That I finally learned this lesson:
One Step in the right direction's worth a wasted mile behind

Chorus:
Singin'
No more lookin' over my shoulder
No more hangin' on to the past
No more filling up my tomorrows
With yesterday's sorrows
No more lookin' over my shoulder

I could chill a room with reasons why I would not give forgiveness
To the people who had selfishly left me a wounded soul
I kept dragging 'round those memories
Like a ball and chain behind me
Wonderin' why my troubles followed me wherever I would go
Oh, but one night, sick and tired of being sick and tired
I realized forgiveness was the only open road
I swear I heard those shackles snap
The moment that I took that path
I never have one time looked back since the morning I arose

Chorus

I'm singin'
No more lookin' over my shoulder
No more hangin' on to the past
No more filling up my tomorrows
With yesterday's sorrows
No more, no more, no...

No more lookin' over my shoulder
No more hangin' on to the past
No more filling up my tomorrows
With yesterday's sorrows
No more lookin' over my shoulder
