Written by Travis Tritt

The roads that we've traveled
Ain't always been easy
Lord knows we've both seen our share
Of troubles and trials

It's hard to believe
We made it so far together
But just between you and me darling
It was worth every mile

Chorus:
It was worth every storm
We had to weather
It was worth all the evenings
We cried together
When the going got toughest
I could count on your smile
And looking back now I can say
It was worth every mileI know you and I both had our doubts
That we'd make it
But deep in the back of our minds
We knew all along

That love's not for quitters
So we kept ours moving
Oh and I think you'll have to agree
It was worth every mile

Chorus

And looking back now I can say
It was worth every mile
