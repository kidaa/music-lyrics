Written by Travis Tritt & Gary Rossington

When you told me you were leaving
Girl I didn't believe a word
'Cause to think that you'd walk out on me
Just sounded too absurd
I'd like to change the things I did
That tore our love apart
But that's just wishful thinking on my part 

Chorus:
Well I'm hoping and I'm praying
You'll give me one more try
'Cause it's an awful price I'm paying
With the tear drops that I've cried
I guess I should have listened
If I had only been that smart
But that's just wishful thinking on my part I found out it's the little things
That made our house a home
You'd be surprised how much I've learned
Every day since you've been gone
But I wished I'd learned that lesson
Before it broke my heart
But that's just wishful thinking on my part 

Chorus

Well that's just wishful thinking on my part
