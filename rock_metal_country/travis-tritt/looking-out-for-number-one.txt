Travis Tritt, Troy Seals
No matter what I do I can't make you happy
Though I go to great lenghts to do your will
If you say hurry, girl I make it snappy
Trying hard to keep your wishes filled
But I'm getting tired and feeling real discouraged
From being pressure underneath your thumb
So here's a message you can give your mama
Starting now I'm looking out for number one 

Lord everyone around me
I've tried so hard to please
Till the only one unhappy
Feeling broken down is me
But things are gonna change
With each new setting sun
Starting now I'm looking out for number one 

It's getting hard to face my morning mirror
There's a stranger in there staring back at me
He tells me every day it's getting clearer
Son you're not the man you used to be
Yeah it's time to get this monkey off my shoulder
And quit worrying 'bout the things that you want done
I'm gonna start the fire that you have smoldered
'Cause starting now I'm looking out for number one Repeat chorus

Yeah starting now I'm looking out for number one
