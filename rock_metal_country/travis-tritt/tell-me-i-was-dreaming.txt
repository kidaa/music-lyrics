Written by Travis Tritt & Bruce Ray Brown

When I woke up this morning
Wiped the sleep from my eyes
Found a new day dawning
And suddenly I realize
You're gone

Chorus:
Tell me I was dreaming
That you didn't leave me here to cry
You didn't say you don't love me anymore
And it was just my imagination telling lies
Tell me that you didn't say goodbyeI'm in a state of confusion
I hope things aren't what they seem
If this is really happening
Just let me go back to dream
You're home

Chorus 2 x's
