Travis Tritt
What made you think I'd let you
Go on treatin' me this way
What made you think I'd let you run me down
I have tried to keep my cool
But I will not play your fool
And it's all about to change starting now

Girl, if you had your way, I'd be crying everyday
Happiness it one thing you would not allow
I have listened to your lies, you can't say I haven't tried
But, it's all about to change starting now

I once believed you cared for me, boy, was I ever wrong
Still you made me love you I still don't know how
It's a game that I can't win but I'll be damned if I give in
'Cause it's all about to change starting now

Repeat Chorus

Yeah, it's all about to change starting now
