There's been times I've felt like half a man
Life's had me down on my knees
Troubled times I don't understand why they happen to me
I have struggled through the darkness and I have found the light of day

Chorus:
But if I lost you, there'd be no sunshine shining through
I don't know what in the world I would do if I lost you

Like a ship with no harbor like a bird with no wings
Like a fish out of water a dreamer without a dream
I have learned about losing I could lose most anything

Chorus 2 x's
