Travis Tritt
You say you were wrong to ever leave me alone
You're sorry, you're lonesome, and scared
And you say you'd be happy if you could just come back home
Well, here's a quarter, call someone who cares

Call someone who'll listen, and might give a damn
Maybe one of your sordid affairs
But, don't you come 'round here handin' me none of your lines
Here's a quarter, call someone who cares

I though what we had could never turn bad
So your leavin' caught me unaware
But the fact is you've run, girl, that can't be undone
So, here's a quarter, call someone who cares

Repeat Chorus

Yeah, here's a quarter, call someone who cares
