Michael Henderson
Well I was born the restless kind
Settlin' down never crossed my mind
Wild and wooly I guess that's me
People sure get nervous when a man is free
I can hold my tongue and I can hold my wine
I can hold my own I'm the restless kind

I've seen the country and I've been to town
Rode in fancy cars with the top rolled down
Comin' down the road like a summer breeze
Whatever it takes I do what I please
I can hold my horses I can hold the line
Yeah I can hold my own I'm the restless kind
Yeah the restless kindI was born the restless kind
I never assume what I'm gonna find
I can stand my ground I can slip through a crack
But as sure as I leave buddy I'll be back
I can hold my temper I can bide my time
Yeah I can hold my own I'm the restless kind
I can hold my tongue I can hold my wine
Yeah I can hold my own I'm the restless kind
Oh I'm the restless kind
Rough and rowdy restless kind
