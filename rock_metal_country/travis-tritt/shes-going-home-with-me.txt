Travis Tritt
Well I guess you'd call me trouble
I have been most my life
Been black and blue a time or two
'Cause I ain't scared to fight
But I got myself a sweetheart
That stands right by my side
Always around to cool me down
When I get dixie fried
And I know she loves to party
She knows I don't like crowds
But I compromise on Friday nights
And we go paint the town
She turns heads in every club
We hang out in 'til three
But I don't care how much they stare
She's going home with me

She's going home with me tonight
On that you can depend
She's not just some one night stand
That girl's is my best friend
And I don't have to be jealous
Just wait around and see
She don't want nobody else
She's going home with me

Well I used to go out prowlin'
Skirt chasing every night
Sniffing 'round like some ol' hound
Like all you other guys
Until from out of nowhere
She took me by the hand
I found what I'd been looking for
Dog days came to an end
So listen good now fellas
No need to act the fool
I treat her well, no way in hell
That she'd leave me for you
Your come on lines won't sway her
She's happy as can be
She made her choice, forget it boys
She's going home with meShe's going home with me tonight
On that you can depend
She's not just some one night stand
That girl's is my best friend
And I don't have to be jealous
Just wait around and see
She don't want nobody else
She's going home with me

I don't have to get jealous
Just wait around and see
She made her choice, forget it boys
She's going home with me
