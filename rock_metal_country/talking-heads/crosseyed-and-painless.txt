Lost my shape   Tryin' to act casual!
Can't stop   I might end up in the hospital
Changin' my shape   I feel like an accident
They're back!   To explain their experience

Isn't it weird   Looks too obscure to me
Wasting away   That was their policy

I'm ready to leave   I push the facts in front of me
Facts lost   Ya facts are never what they seem to be
There's nothing there!   No information left of any kind
LLLifting my head   L'L'Looking for danger signs

There was a line   There was a formula
Sharp as a knife   Facts cut a hole in us
There was a line   There was a formula
Sharp as a knife   Facts cut a hole in us

I'm still waiting  I..I..I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting  I..I..I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting  I..I..I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting  I..I..I'm still waiting

The feeling returns   Whenever we close out eyes
Lifting my head   looking around inside

The island of doubt   It's like the taste of medicine
Working by hindsight   Got the message from the oxygen
M'M'Making a list   Find the cost of opportunity
Doing it right   Facts are useful in emergencies

The feeling returns   Whenever we close out eyes
Lifting my head   Looking around inside.

Facts are simple and facts are straight
Facts are lazy and facts are late
Facts all come with points of view
Facts don't do what I want them to
Facts just twist the truth around
Facts are living turned inside out
Facts are getting the best of them
Facts are nothing on the face of things

I'm still waiting  I..I..I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting  I..I..I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting  I..I..I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting  I..I..I'm still waiting
