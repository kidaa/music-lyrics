'Round and 'round
and we won't let go
And where we stop
no one knows
uh-huh uh-huh

Down and down
in a spin we turn
Looking like
we'll never learn
uh-huh uh-huh

Think about
what ev'ryone is saying
Ruby dear
Oh don't you hear

Late at night
when the radio is playing
Ruby dear
So looky here

Oh this record's broken
It slips a beat
And all those watermelons
Have gone to seed

Nothing lives
in this dirty little river
No one here
Will shed a tear

It dried up
but it couldn't run forever
Ruby dear
That's what we hearI still like the ocean
Down by the sea
They left that door wide open
It tempted me
Hounding me
from the bedroom to the kitchen

Ruby dear
I'm still right here
Now they throwed
the fox amongst the chickens
It's too deep
I'll drown in my sleep!

Angels and prostitutes
They might look the same
And if to Hell we're going
I'll see you there

'Round and 'round
and we won't let go
And where we stop
no one knows
uh-huh uh-huh

Down the street
where the bonfires glow
Looking like
they lost control
uh-huh uh-huh

Settle down
in that rocking chair
Breathing in
that rotten air
uh-huh uh-huh

Johnny Jones
fell fast asleep
Down a hole
where the rocks are steep
uh-huh uh-huh
