Your stepmother hates my guts
But i don't really care
She don't like me comin' 'round
With my short greasy hair

She would be your best friend
If she had it her way
She would take all your best friends
And put them away

Your stepmother hates my guts
But i don't give a damn
She thinks i'm some kinda' scum
'cause i don't call her ma'am

She would be your best friend
If she had it her way
She would take all your best friends
And put them away

Your stepmother hates my guts
But i won't give up yet
I want you so goddamn much
But she sure is upset

Looking down again i knock 
On the door
There she is
Looking down on me again
