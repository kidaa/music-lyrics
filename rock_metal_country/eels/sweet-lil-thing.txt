The feeling of understanding is very rare
For someone like me it's hard to find
Somebody to care
She's got a way about her
Changes everything
She's got a way about her
She's my sweet li'l thing

Making love with her indie rock
Playing on her stereo
Holding hands going down the road
When she drives me home
She's got a magic about her
Makes me wanna sing
She's got a magic about her 
She's my sweet li'l thing

Spent the day laying in her bed
My nose against hers
Later we went for a drive
Didn't know where we were
Man i never felt so alive

Nobody gets the girl
But baby i do
Nobody gets me either
But she sees through
She's got a glow around her
Shines on everything
She's got a glow around her
She's my sweet li'l thing
