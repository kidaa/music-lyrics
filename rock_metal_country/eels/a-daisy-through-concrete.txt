wake up the dying, 
dont wake up the dead
change what your sayin, 
dont change what you've said
now that its time that 
i got out of bed 
when i'll walk myself 
down sycamore street
the sun beats down
no shoes on my feet 
and i stumble on 
a daisy through concrete
pink and brown babies 
in pink stroller cars, 
know that it's good
they dont care where they are
they know that home 
doesn't feel very far 
when i'll walk myself 
down sycamore street
the sun beats down
no shoes on my feet 
and i stumble on 
a daisy through concrete
airplane is flyin up in the sky
makin a pattern 
with the white lines
looks like a heart 
or maybe a pie
