Tomorrow i'll be nine
And everything will be the same
Tomorrow i'll be nine
It's only gonna be another day

They're always looking at me funny
I'm always doing something wrong
I'm thinking they'd be better off
If i was gone

Tomorrow i'll be nine
And everything will be the same
Tomorrow i'll be nine
It's only gonna be another day

They never tell me what they're thinking
They're always busy being mad
I start to thinking
Could it be 'cause I am bad

Oh i'll go
Where i can't hear them
Oh i'll go away

There's got to be someone who wants me
There's got to be someone who cares
Don't know where they are
But i am going there

Tomorrow i'll be nine
And everything will be the same
Tomorrow i'll be nine
I think it's time to make my getaway
