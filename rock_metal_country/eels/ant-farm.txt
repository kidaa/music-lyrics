hate a lot of things
but I love a few things
and you are one of them
hard to believe
after all these years
but you are one of them
walk down the streets
I'm thinking:
everybody move along
I've got a sad-hearted needing
to belong
nevertheless
it's all the mess you made
but I can't let it go
walk down the streets
I'm thinking:
look at all the ants in a farm
I've got a sad-hearted feeling
to harm
hate a lot of things
but I love a few things
and you are one of them
