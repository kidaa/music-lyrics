I saw some photos of a happy family
Hanging up on the thrift shop wall
I paid the man and i brought them back home
I feel better now when they don't call

Every once in a while
I see your face when i stare at the ceiling

I truly regret
The day i wrote you off

Always dreamed that one day i'd leave home
And now i do it again and again
And here i go looking for my new home
Or shall i say looking for a best friend

Every once in a while
I see your face when i stare at the ceiling

I truly regret
The day i wrote you off
