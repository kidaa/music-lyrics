she's never known acceptance
she's never known the world
she says i like to call myself M
but my real name is mockingbird
Mockingbird Franklin
so how do you do
Mockingbird Franklin
i'm a lot like you
she says her mother is gone now
she says her mother got killed
i said i'm sorry but is it true
did she really name you Mockingbird
Mockingbird Franklin
broke your heart in two
Mockingbird Franklin
i'm a lot like you
Mockingbird don't you change
just because you're not like them
oh Mockingbird you're not the same
alone along the sidewalk
her steps are barely heard
it's kinda funny that it's her name
'cus she's nothing like a mockingbird
nothing like a mockingbird
Mockingbird Franklin
don't it get to you
Mockingbird Franklin
i'm a lot like you
i'm a lot like you
it's true
