Mama grapped onto the milkman's hand 
and then she finally gave birth
years go by still i don't know
who shall inherit this earth
and no one will know my name until it's on a stone 
this could be your lucky day in hell
never know who it might be at your doorbell
this could be your lucky day in hell 
waking up with an ugly face
winston churchhill in drag
looking for a new maternal embrace
another tired old gag
am i just a walking bag of chewed up dust and bones 
this could be your lucky day in hell
never know who it might be at your doorbell
this could be your lucky day in hell 
father theresa you can't make me into you
i never wanna be like you
why can't you see it's me
you know it's time to let me go 
this could be your lucky day in hell
never know who it might be at your doorbell
this could be your lucky day in hell
