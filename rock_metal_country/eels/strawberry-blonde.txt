There she goes down in my head
Saying things she never said
E.e. cummings coming soon
But she'll be reading on the moon

And i don't know why she's gone
I'd welcome her in my arms
But she'll always be strawberry blonde

There she goes back in my heart
Pulling cobwebs in the dark
The five o'clock comes 'round the bend
And so she goes off with a friend

And i don't know why she's gone
I'd welcome her in my arms
But she'll always be strawberry blonde

She wrote a letter to her sister
She said this time it's the end
She never knew how much i missed her
Around the bend

There she goes down in my head
Leaving cobwebs on my bed
E.e. cummings coming soon
But she'll be laughing on the moon

And i don't know why she's gone
I'd welcome her in my arms
But she'll always be strawberry blonde
