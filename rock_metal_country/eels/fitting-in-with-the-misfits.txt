dear ma you might find it hard to believe
but i think i've finally found a home
the weather's loveley there's so much to see
and people who know what i know
now i've got friends that do want me
and take me as i am
now i've got friends that do love me
i'm all right with them
fitting in with the misfitts
living in the lost and found
and i will never be afraid
for lost souls don't know where they're bound
dear ma i know this is hard for ya too
but some things are better off said
i've always found it so hard to adjust
i'd rather stay in bed
now i've got friends that do want me
and take me as i am
now i've got friends that do love me
i'm all right with them
fitting in with the misfitts
living in the lost and found
and i will never be afraid
for lost souls don't know where they're bound
don't know where they're bound
i don't know where i'm bound
fitting in with the misfitts
living in the lost and found
fitting in with the misfitts
living in the lost and found
