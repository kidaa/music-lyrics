She has eyes disability blue
A german dog and a strict curfew
And if one man's cage is another man's stage
Then she's turned the script to another page
And she doesn't really give a damn
What you have to say

She makes a call on her friend's cell phone
The operator answers and says "you're not alone"
And if one man's ceiling is another's dance floor
Then she'll be the one running to the seashore
Trying to tell the seagulls this is home

And if one man's cage is another man's stage
Then she'll be the one wiser than her age
Trying to get the message to your ears
