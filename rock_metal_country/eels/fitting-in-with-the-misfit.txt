Dear ma
You might find it hard to believe
But i think i finally found a home
The weather's lovely
There's so much to see
And people who know what i know

Now i've got friends that do want me
And take me as i am
Now i've got friends that do love me
I'm alright with them

Fitting in with the misfits
Living in the lost and found
And i will never be afraid
For lost souls 
Don't know where 
They're bound

Dear ma
I know this is hard for you too
But some things are better off said
I've always found it so hard to adjust
I'd rather stay in bed

Now i've got friends that do want me
And take me as i am
Now i've got friends that do love me
I'm alright with them

Fitting in with the misfits
Living in the lost and found
And i will never be afraid
For lost souls 
Don't know where 
They're bound
