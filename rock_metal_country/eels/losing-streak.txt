Was i wrong about the world
It's a beautiful new place
Where else could a creep like me
Meet such a pretty face

Meeting every day with the rising sun
Looking up it's looking like
My losing streak is done

Used to always feel like
Wished that i was dressed better
Never had a lot of luck
Until i finally met her

Feeling like the weight that weighed a ton
Lifted off my shoulders now
My losing streak is done

Always felt like giving in
To the feeling i can't win
But i took it on the chin
Now i'm finally cashing in

Meeting every day with the rising sun
Looking up it's looking like
My losing streak is done

My losing streak is done
I said my losing streak is done
Did you hear me
I said my losing streak is done
