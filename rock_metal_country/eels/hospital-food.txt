coming down through the alley
trying to walk without a sound
it doesnt really matter
cause there aint no one around
tip toe through the alley and 
tip toe through your life
you still got it coming
be it gun be it knife
next thing you know
youre eating hospital food
karaoke castration
take the wasp alive
hes gonna sting you anyway
and take you to the hive
yesterday was suckin and 
tomorrows looking bad
who knew that today
was the only thing I had
hospital food
want some hospital food
hospital food
delicious hospital food
in your tribute album to the world
you must never forget
to sing the one about the cat
whos always getting wet
he always got a problem 
hes a very bitter dude
and now hes complaining
about his hospital food
hospital food
its gonna help the medicine go down
want some hospital food
gonna take a walk without a sound
a little hospital food
helps the spoonful of sugar come up
I want some hospital food
in your blender and in my cup
