i bought some rock star ashes, 
from the back of rolling stone
i guess he wouldn't mind it, 
they couldn't sell his soul
the tiger in my tank, is going to go extinct
and im not feelin so good myself, 
i think im on the brink
of disaster
i had a dream last night
the tv and the phone 
grew some legs and took a walk 
and left me all alone
the tiger in my tank, is going to go extinct
and im not feelin so good myself, 
i think im on the brink
of disaster
when i grow up ill be 
an angry little whore, 
ill give you all the finger
i'll  sell you all what for
