are you one of the beautiful people
is my name on the list 
wanna be of the beautiful people
wanna feel like i'm missed 
hey you with the walkie talkie
i know my clothes are not right
i wish i had my own walkie talkie
that reached to god every night 
everyone needs to be somebody
everyone needs to find someone who cares
but i don't know if you know what i mean
'cause i'm never on your list 
are you one of the beautiful people
am i on the wrong track
sometimes it feels like i'm made of eggshell
and it feels like i'm gonna crack 
everyone needs to be somebody
everyone needs to find someone who cares
but i don't know if you know what i mean
'cause i'm never on your list
