Blue light is flickering
Through the city streets
One billion tv sets
Glowing off concrete
One day closer to death
I know that i don't have too long
Whatever happened to soy bomb

Lunch box collector loves all the pussycats
But when he goes to bed
He wonders where he's at
Thrift store shirts and old haircuts
Living in an old sitcom
Whatever happened to soy bomb

The day is coming when you'll have to think of it
Was it really worth it
All that shit

Blue light is flickering
Through the cloudy sky
One billiob lonely hearts
Beat until they die
One day closer to death
I know i don't have too long
Whatever happened to soy bomb
