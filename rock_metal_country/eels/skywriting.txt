Don't cry
All the songs you sing
All the flowers you bring
I'm part of everything there ever was
And will be

Go on
You've got places to be
So many things to see
Don't worry 'bout me
I'm already where i should be

Look up
A plane writes in the sky
For every passerby
No one ever dies
They just write things in the sky

If you
Wanna think about me
Look out above the sea
And you can see that I am doing
Just fine
