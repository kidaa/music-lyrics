Guess i'm doing something wrong
Never feel right in these shoes
Pocket full of matches and a head full of flames
Got to warn you that i'm bad news

She tucks me in and then she screams
"one day you will have to choose
Either take care of me or take care of you
And don't pretend you're not bad news"

Come on now i'll take you home
You don't have a thing to lose
But stick around long enough and you'll find out
I am nothing but bad news

You can never change where you're from
No matter who i will accuse
I'm gonna get on with a better life
And one day i won't be bad news

It's the same everyday when i wake up
It's the same in the way that you 
Gave me up
In the middle of a swan dive

And i was soaring down
Perfect and slow
