Eels - Dog Faced Boy
-----------------------
Coming home from the school today
Crying all along the way
Ain't no way for a boy to be
Begging ma to shave me please
You little punks think you own this town
Well someday someone's gonna bring you down
Life ain't pretty for a dog faced boy
Life ain't pretty for a dog faced boy
You, take back what you said now
That's the last time i cry
You tell me what it is to be a friend, now
'Till i walk beside you on the street now
Ma won't shave me
Jesus can't save me
Dog faced boy
Life ain't pretty for a dog faced boy
Life ain't pretty for a dog faced boy
Life ain't pretty for a dog faced boy
Life ain't pretty for a dog faced boy
Going back to the school tomorrow
Hang my hairy head in sorrow
Ain't no way for a boy to be
Aint' no way to set me free, now
Ma won't shave me
Jesus can't save me
Dog faced boy
Ma won't shave me
Jesus can't save me
Dog faced boy
