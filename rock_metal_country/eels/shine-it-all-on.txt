Tarot cards
Said i'm already dead
Crystal ball
Fell down onto my head
Tenderness
If i want it i pay
My true love
Well she threw it away

But i can shine it all on
I can shine it all on
I can shine it all on
And still be amazed

Had some money
And a hole in my pocket
Had a house
But i forgot to lock it
Took a drag
From a smoke that may kill me
What a drag
How the winter wind chills me

I can shine it all on
I can shine it all on
I can shine it all on
And still be amazed

I'll shine it on just like macbeth
In the face of certain death
Of a salesman or a king
And when the palm trees are on fire
I'll take my boat out on the sea

Had a face
But i never could save it
Had a kid
But i never would name it
Have a life
Well that's what they call it
It's a road
But I guess i could crawl it
