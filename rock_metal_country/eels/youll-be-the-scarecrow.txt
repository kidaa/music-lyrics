one day i'll have to fly
to the next great unknown
one day i'll be outta here
back on my own
and when i come around for my goodbye
you'll be the scarecrow
you'll be the scarecrow
the one i adore
the one i'll cary with me
forever more
you were the special one
something we shared
the one that i'll miss the most
the one that cared
so when i come around for my goodbyes
you'll be the scarecrow
you'll be the scarecrow
the one i adore
the one i'll cary with me
forever more
there may not be a day
for a dou reunion
there may not be a day
for us
one day you'll look and see
a purple sunset
and then you'll know that i'm ok
i'm doing my best
and when i come around for my goodbye
you'll be the scarecrow
you'll be the scarecrow
the one i adore
you'll be the scarecrow
the one i miss most
and when i come around for my goodbye
you'll be the scarecrow
