You up there
Don't you think there's something you can do
Well no one ever told me it was gonna be this way
Me down here
Well look at all the things i try to do
Every day's another day
But nothing else is new

Everything i see is broken
There's no water in the well
Oh won't you please send me
Someone to break the spell

Well is it me
Or is it everyone that comes around
They always stay a little while
But they're gone before too long
Hey you up there
Looking down upon this sorry scene
Is it what it's all about
Or is this some bad dream

Everything i see is broken
There's no water in the well
Oh won't you please send me
Someone to break the spell

I've got a million dreams stuck in my head
If i could live a few before i'm dead
