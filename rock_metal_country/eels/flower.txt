turn the ugly light off god
wanna feel the night
everyday it shines down on me
don't you think that i see
don't you think that i see what it's all about
hard to look the other way
while the world passes me by
and everyone is trying to bum me out 
it's a pretty big world god
and i am awful small
everyday they rain down on me
flower in a hailstorm
flower in a hailstorm
i'm living for the drought
i could throw it back at them
but then i play their game
everyone is trying to bum me out 
when i came into this world they slapped me
and everyday since then i'm slapped again
tomorrow's king: an unsightly coward
you see, I know i'm gonna win 
turn the ugly light off god
don't wanna see my face
everyday it will betray me
don't you think that i know
don't you think that i know what they're talking about
if they step on me tonight
they're gonna pay someday
everyone is trying to bum me out
