What would you say if i left this town tomorrow
I guess i would
But know i'd miss the train
I know i would

I'll take a dog's life
Just layin' in the sun
I'll take a dog's life
'cause i don't care for this one

Chasing trains and planes and rain
Where is my rain
Falling down upon a thirsty world
I never want to be the same

Another time i might have fit in alright
But not this time
I guess i'm just too soon
To change my tune

I'll take a dog's life
Just layin' in the sun
I'll take a dog's life
'cause i don't care for this one

Chasing trains and planes and rain
Where is my rain
Falling down upon a thirsty world
I never want to be the same
