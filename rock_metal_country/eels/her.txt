Nobody's quite sure how it became
That something so good 
Could become of this day
But she's like a dream
Where you've lost all your fear

And in this life you're lucky to have 
Even one good friend
And it's her that i'll miss in the end

Love stories come 
And then love stories go
But this is the one 
That i'll always know
She is the one that makes me believe

And in this life you've got yourself
On which you can depend
But it's her that i'll miss in the end
Yeah it's her that i'll miss in the end

Love is a word that gets thrown 'round a lot
Sometimes it means something
Other times not
But she is the greatest love i'll ever know

And in this life you'll never know
What's waiting 'round the bend
But it's her that i'll miss in the end
Yeah it's her that i'll miss in the end
It's her that i'll miss in the end
