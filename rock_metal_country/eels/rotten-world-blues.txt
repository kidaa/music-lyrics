Well i went walking
Out yesterday
A man was carrying a sign that says
"the world is gonna end tomorrow"
Hey buddy, got a nickel i can borrow?

This rotten world's gonna chew you up
Swallow you whole and then spit you back out
The sooner you recognize this simple fact
Then this rotten world gives you what you lack

Ol' miss headtrip
She's gettin' down
You don't see her much walking 'round town
Well you could say that she needs a little lovin'
Looking for a light with her head in the oven

This rotten world's gonna chew you up
Swallow you whole and then spit you back out
The sooner you recognize this simple fact
Then this rotten world gives you what you lack

Miss kovaleva
She's lookin' good
Walkin' her ass through the neighborhood
She knows something that you don't know
Something she learned about a long time ago

This rotten world's gonna chew you up
Swallow you whole and then spit you back out
The sooner you recognize this simple fact
Then this rotten world gives you what you lack

This rotten world's gonna chew you up
Swallow you whole and then spit you back out
