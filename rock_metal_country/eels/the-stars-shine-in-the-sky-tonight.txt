I can't live in a world that you have left behind
Seen a lot, been through too much
But this is where i draw the line

It's not where you're coming from
It's where you're going to
And i just wanna go with you

December is a lonely month
In a year of lonely days
It's hard to tell which way is up
Or down or out
Or through the haze

People cheat and people lie
While you just watch it all go by
Counting days until you die

The stars shine in the sky tonight
Like a path beyond the grave
When you wish upon that star
There's two of us you need to save

It's not where you're coming from
It's where you're going to
And i just wanna go with you
