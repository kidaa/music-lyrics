If i could love you
I'm sure i would
If i could hold you
And feel understood
I'd be there now
But i don't know how
'cause i am an animal

Bundle of rags
Wrap me tight
Keep me safe inside
Warm at night

I am no more
I am not good
I am so sorry
If you misunderstood
I'd make it up
But i cannot
If i am an animal
