Don't know why
She thinks she loves him
Don't go cry
He's just a toy

She calls it only love
Her love it is not pure

She loves a puppet
She loves a puppet
And all that i can do is cry

Got no soul
Only a haircut
He's no man
Barely a boy

Why can't she understand
That i am her true love

She loves a puppet
She loves a puppet

He's made of flesh and blood
His footsteps make a heavy thud
His porch light's on
But no one's home

I'd love to make her mine
But i have to wonder why

She loves a puppet
She loves a puppet
And all that i can do is cry
