Well, the sun is shining but it don't feel good
Don't smile down on this neighborhood
When i go walking through this stinking town
Mister, i keep my eyes down

The brotherhood of the misunderstood
Live and die here in all likelihood
You're livin' in this town
Better pray for sundown
And baby, when you go downtown
You keep your eyes down

You keep your eyes down

Fair-weather friends need not apply
The man of the house is not inside
Baby, i'm keeping my eyes
Down

Go with the flow, well you've gotta be sick
Think i'd rather hear my heart not tick
But if you don't wanna wear a hospital gown
Better get out now
Or keep your eyes down

Fair-weather friends need not apply
The man of the house is not inside
Baby, i'm keeping my eyes
Down

Well the sun is shining but it don't feel good
Don't smile down on this neighborhood
When i go walking through this stinking town
Mister, i keep my eyes down

I keep my eyes down
