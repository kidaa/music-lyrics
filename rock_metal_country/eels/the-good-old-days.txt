I know i'm not too much of a bargain
And you know that's not what you bargained for
As the hours turn into days
Pretty soon lost in the haze
It's up to you and me
And who's to say
These could be the good old days

I like waking up after a bad dream
Makes it feel like life ain't bad
Little kids go out to play
They're just happy it's another day
It's up to you and me
And who's to say
These could be the good old days

I guess i could be a quiet hero
No one knows the good i've done
You're not sure
Well that's okay
'cause i am 
And i'm not afraid
It's up to you and me
And who's to say
These could be the good old days
