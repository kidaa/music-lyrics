so I wrote it all in a letter
but I don't know if it came
the nurse she likes my writings
so she keeps it just like me
so that it won't get away
I won't be denied this time
'fore I go out of my mind over matters
got my foot on the ladder
and I'm climbing up to the moon
got a sky that looks like heaven
got an earth that looks like shit
and it's getting hard to tell where
what I am ends
and what they're making me begins
I won't be denied this time
'fore I go out of my mind over matters
got my foot on the ladder
and I'm climbing up to the moon
Saturday in the yard
they'll bring you by
we'll lay down on the grass
and watch as the sky closes in
I won't be denied this time
'fore I go out of my mind over matters
got my foot on the ladder
and I'm climbing up to the moon
climbing up to the moon
