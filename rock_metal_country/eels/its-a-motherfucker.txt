It's a Motherfucker
Being here without you
thinking 'bout the good times
thinkin 'bout the bad
And I won't ever be the same
It's a Motherfucker
Getting through a Sunday
Talking to the walls just me again
But I won't ever be the same
I won't ever be the same
It's a Motherfucker
How much I understand
The meaning that you need someone
I could take you be the hand
And you won't ever be the same
You won't ever be the same
