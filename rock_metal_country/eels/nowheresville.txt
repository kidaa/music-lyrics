i wanna see Paris
insane on the sine
i wanna do that bull run thin in spain
i wanna go to england
and walk down penny lane
half a pint an island
may wash away my pain
i'm stuck in mud
spinning my wheels
and i'm all alone
on the road
to nowheresville
i wanna meet a little girl
with french horn lips
and introduce her to my trip
i'll make her smile on the nile
hold her hand in japan
but last things first for all my plans
i'm stuck in mud
spinning my wheels
and i'm all alone
on the road
to nowheresville
i'm on my way
i'm almost nowhere
i'm almost everything i swore i'd never be
when i get there
then i'll go somehwere
i'm going to pay my last repsects and get the
hell out of there
out of nowhere
i'm stuck in mud
spinning my wheels
and i'm all alone
on the road
to nowheresville
spinning my wheels
and i'm all alone on the road to nowheresville
nowheresville
nowheresville
