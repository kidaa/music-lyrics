Get off your sled and go to bed
Don't you ever tire?
Throw a bone i'm finally home
Curled up by the fire
Snow is falling from the sky
Like ashes from an urn
Sweet dreams my little one
Now it's my turn

Well christmas is going to the dogs
We'd rather have chew toys than yule logs
And things aren't looking very good it's true
So i'll just lay here and chew

Now when i sleep i like to dream
Of rabbits in the snow
Jumping right into my jaws
From their rabbit holes
Take one home and set him down
Right next to you shoes
Wake up to a big surprise
My gift to you

And christmas is going to the dogs
We'd rather have chew toys than yule logs
And things aren't looking very good it's true
So i'll just lay here and chew

And christmas is going to the dogs
We're scarfing down the turkey and eggnog
And things aren't looking very good it's true
So i'll just lay here and chew
So i'll just stay here and chew
