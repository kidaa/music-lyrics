feeling scared today
write down ";i am ok";
a hundred times the doctors say
I am ok
I am ok
Im not ok
skin is crawling off
mopping the sweaty drops
sticking around for this shit
another day
another day
not another day
pink pill feels good
finally understood
take me in your warm, embrace
I am trying
I am trying
