When you called
Your voice was so grave
I knew it would be
The last time we spoke

You said something
That i could not hear
To hear with my own ears
The last time we spoke

And it's a hard time
Trying to get through
All the days that drag on
Thinking about you

Nothing hurts
Like someone who knows
Everything about you
Leaving you behind

And it's a hard time
Trying to get through
All the days that drag on
Thinking about you

When you called
You might as well have killed me
And that was the last time
The last time we spoke
