Mother couldn't love me
But that didn't stop me
From liking her
She was my mom
And i was no son of a bitch

Daddy was a drunk
A most unpleasant man
Asleep on the floor
Just imside the front door
With a smile underneath his red nose

The wrong look his way
Well that could really wreck his day
And believe me when i say
It would wreck your day too

Grandma took me in
Though times were pretty thin
Said i was no son of a bitch

Down on my knees
Begging god please
