got a 3 speed and banana seat
sitting back on the sissy bar
went to sev and got got a drink
wish I was driving in daddys car
and I looked up at the sky last night
and I thought I saw a bomb
and why wont you just tell me whats going on?
riding down on sprinhill road
meeting alfred out in the woods
dogs bark and mosquitos bite
scratching the itch that makes it feel good
and I looked into the mirror last night
all I saw was a pretty blonde
and why wont you just tell me whats going on?
life is funny
but not ha ha funny
peculiar I guess
you think I got it going my way
then why am I such a fuckin mess?
want a pony and a birthday cake
want a party with a scary clown
kneel down and bow to the princess
kneel down for the queen of the town
and I looked up at the sky last night
and I thought I saw a bomb
and why wont you just tell me whats going on?
tell me whats going on
