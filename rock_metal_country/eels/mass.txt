It's really more than i can say
Looking at this tower
Angels are off duty and asleep
In these wee hours

And there's no place i can go
And this noise inside my head
It comes and goes
It comes and it goes

There's really nothing you can stop
So i guess i'm gonna try
Climbing up this tower
Walking up the stones
Stocking feet
To the clock

This is one place that i know
And the face in front of me
It comes and goes

Not some lucky charm
But something to hold onto
That could hold onto me

And there's no place i can go
And this noise inside my head
It comes and goes
It comes and it goes
