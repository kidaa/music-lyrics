Everyone is going fetal
It's the dance the kids all feel
Just get down under your desk
Feels like your mama's nest
Alright

Everyone is going fetal
It's the one thats really real
You're gonna love it if you give it a try
You just lay down like you're gonna die
Alright

Everyone is going fetal
If you feel like your fate is sealed
Then just get down and curl on up
Just like a little helpless pup
Alright

Everyone is going fetal
