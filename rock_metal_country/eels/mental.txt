Its like im dressed up in my mothers clothing 
its like im talking to a voice that doesnt exist
its like i got a wire crossed upstairs
but all i want is just a little truth and thats it
they say im mental but im just confused
thay say im mental but ive been abused
they say im mental cause im not amused my it all
another anchor man is on the T.V.
he's got that far away and vacant look in his eyes
i turn the channel but nothings changing
the only truth is that everythings a lie
they say im mental but im just confused
thay say im mental but ive been abused
they say im mental cause im not amused my it all
there's truth in everything
there's truth in lies
with all this knowledge
i think im gonna be wise
they say im mental but im just confused
thay say im mental but ive been abused
they say im mental cause im not amused my it all
not at all
not at all
