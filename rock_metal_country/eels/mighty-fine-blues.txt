Feeling mighty fine
Feeling mighty fine at this time
Yes i am
Feeling mighty fine
Feeling mighty fine at this time
Yes indeed

Walk down any street
Ask the people you meet
What is it about this place
Keeps you on your feet?

Feeling mighty fine
Feeling mighty fine at this time
Yes i am
Feeling mighty fine
Feeling mighty fine at this time
Yes indeed

Night is coming down
Closer to the ground
Gonna have a little fun 
While i'm still around

Feeling mighty fine
Feeling mighty fine at this time
Yes i am
Feeling mighty fine
Feeling mighty fine at this time
Yes indeed

Don't believe the words they say to you
When they are so absurd
And don't believe a word they say about me 
Because i'm 
Feeling mighty fine

I think i gotta go
I think i'm gonna die
Oh my god, something's wrong
The end is coming near
Because i'm

Feeling mighty fine
Feeling mighty fine at this time
Yes i am
Feeling mighty fine
Feeling mighty fine at this time
Yes i am
Yes i am

Oh yeah!
