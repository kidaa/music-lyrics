22 miles of hard road
33 years of tough luck
44 skulls buried in the ground
Crawling down through the muck
Oh yeah
Johnny don't like the teacher
Johnny don't like the school
One day Johnny is goinna to do somethin'
Show 'em he's nobody's fool
Oh yeah
Chorus
Sisters Brothers make better lovers 
Family Affairs are under the covers... 
Gina clocks the broken hearts 
won't let you leave until you're bleeding
Sally don't like her daddy
Sally don't like her friends
Sally and Johnny are watchin' TV
Waitin' for it to end
Oh yeah
Chorus
22 miles of hard road
33 years of tough luck
44 skulls buried in the ground
Crawling down through the muck
Oh yeah
