In this world of shit
Baby you are it
A little light that shines all over
Must take over and see us through the night
daddy was a troubled genius
Mama was a real good egg
Why don't we just get together
For whatever and see if it's alright
I spent so many days
Just staring at the haze
And I think that that's a book
That I don't have to write again
Now when I rise I shine
I got you on my mind
And the question isn't if
The question is merely when...
Baby I confess
I am quite a mess
So let's get married and make some people
More than equal in this world of shit
I will make a pledge
To get down off the ledge
You and I belong together
And forever we will have our love
