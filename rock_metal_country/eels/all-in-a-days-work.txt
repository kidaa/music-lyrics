When i was born the doctor said
There's something wrong inside that baby head
When i was a boy at sunday school
I told them all that they were fools

All in a day's work
To live and breathe
A sight to see
And so it goes

I went into the fortune teller's
She wouldn't read my horoscope
I go into the laundromat
The people all buy extra soap

All in a day's work
To live and breathe
A sight to see
