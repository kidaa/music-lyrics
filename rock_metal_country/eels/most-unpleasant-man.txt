Well i'll rise above
Once I forget
What it was like then
Before we met
I had no dreams
There was no plan
You see it's just that i was
A most unpleasant man

And now it all
Has come to pass
I guess i knew somehow
It couldn't last
And so i'm back
Where i began
And once again i've become
A most unpleasant man

Where will i go
If you're not there
I'll try to find you
Everywhere

Remember me
Not as i am
But how i was
As your truest friend
Remember me
Not as i am
How did i ever become
A most unpleasant man
I'll see you later baby
