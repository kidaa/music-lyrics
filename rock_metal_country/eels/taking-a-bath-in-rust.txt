Why don't you get me a way out of here
Buy me a ticket
A seat in the rear
'cause i'd say that daylight is time to go home

Every day
Voice in my ear
Telling me
Get out of here

I think that you know it's not so bad
Sitting in rust and taking a bath
But i think that i could find a new way

Every day
Voice in my ear
Telling me
Get out of here

Why don't you just think about it a while
Maybe i'm too much
Cramping your style
But now that it's daylight
It's time to come home

Every day
Voice in my ear
Telling me
Get out of here
