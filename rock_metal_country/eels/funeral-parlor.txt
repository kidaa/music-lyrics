Sitting in the funeral parlor
On the night before the day
Think i might have left the stove on
Think i might have left the door unlocked
I don't know if the stores will all be closed
When i get out
I don't know if the chores will all be done
When i get home

Sitting in the funeral parlor
Listen to the organ play
What if i forgot the trash cans
What if i forgot to telephone
I don't know if i wrote the number down
In my book
I don't know if i can stand to stay here
One more second
