Oh no
She's giving back my old raincoat
The one i said she could keep
Okay
She's taking back her umbrella
Well that's alright with me

Oh why
I feel like i'm a fighter
Who only wins despite 
My broken bones
The winner stands alone

Every pocket has a hole
There is no hope
I'm walking around
In my old raincoat

Oh yeah
She's tearing up my old letters
She's setting fire to the heap

Oh joy
She says she's feeling much better
She says it's easy to sleep
Without me there
In the cool night air

The sun is shining
The sky is blue
And I am cold
Just walking around
In my old raincoat

Now i know i'm really free 

Oh why
I feel like i'm a fighter
Who only wins despite 
My broken bones
The winner stands alone

Every pocket has a hole
There is no hope
I've searched them all
Looking for a note

The sun is shining
The sky is blue
And i am cold
I'm walking around
In my old raincoat

Now i know i'm really free
