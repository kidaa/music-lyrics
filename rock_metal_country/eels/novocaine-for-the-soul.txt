Life is hard and so am I
you better give me something
so I dont die 
Novocaine for the soul
before I sputter out 
Life is white and I am black
Jesus and his lawyer
are coming back 
Oh my darling will you be here
before I sputter out 
Guess who's living here
with the great undead
this paint by number's life is fucking with my head
once again 
Life is good and I feel great
'cause mother says I was
a great mistake 
Novovaine for the soul
you better give me something
to fill the hole
before I sputter out repeat
