Hello cruel world so this is you
a broken heart a withered view
i'm looking out to face another day
The angry mob, the happy mass
this birthday cake may be the last
i'm looking out to find another way
norman rockwell colors fade
all my favorite things have changed
what the hell,
hello cruel world
i thought i heard an opera star
who had no home under the stars
she sang and sang and sang the night away
and mother nature changed her name
she doesn't want to play the game
i don't believe she'll ever be the same
so big brother never came
howdy-doodie gets the blame
but what the hell
hello cruel world
fat and beautiful and strange
monkeys dancing in a cage
but what the hell
hello cruel world
venus de milo grew an arm
and old mcdonald bought the farm
say goodbye
hello cruel world
norman rockwell colors fade
all my favorite things have changed
but what the hell, hello cruel world
fat and beautiful and strange
monkeys dancing in a cage
but what the hell
hello cruel world
say goodbye, hello cruel world
but what the hell
hello cruel world
hello hello
ooooh ooooh
hello cruel world
