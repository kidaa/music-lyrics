How does her world spin
Without me and her nest
Could there really be
Such happiness
Oh, she's got a dark side too
Even murderous 
But i love that
Just like her
I don't have a chance at writing the book
I just wanna be a page
In Jeannie's Diary
One single page
In Jeannie's Diary
Yes i am intense
Maybe quite obsessed
Everything she does is curious
Oh, she's going to let me in
I just know it's so
Then again, who do i kid
I don't have a prayer for writing the book
I just wanna be a page
In Jeannie's Diary
One single page
In Jeannie's Diary
She could have anything she wants
So why not me
She could have anything she dreams
Oh, to be one single page
One single page in Jeannie's Dairy
