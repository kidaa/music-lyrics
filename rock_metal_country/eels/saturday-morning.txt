Saturday morning
And who's gonna play with me
Six in the morning baby
I got a long long day ahead of me

The parents are sleeping soundly
The neighbors are dead as wood
I'm getting up and coming over
We gotta rock the neighborhood

Nothing's ever gonna happen 'round here
If we don't make it happen
Sleep away the day if you want to
But i got something that i gotta do

It's saturday morning
And this ain't the place for me
I'm giving you warning baby
We got a whole big fat world to see

Nothing's ever gonna happen 'round here
If we don't make it happen
Sleep away the day if you want to
But i got something that i gotta do

It's saturday morning
And who's gonna play with me
Six in the morning baby
I got a long long day ahead of me
