Are you and me gonna happen
Are you and me gonna happen soon

The gods smile hard down upon
A love that's shared
Heaven's awaiting those who dare

Are you and me gonna happen
Are you and me gonna happen soon

A sweeter feeling i can't guess 
Will ever be
A truer union i can't see

I don't know how much more i can take
I will run through the streets
I will howl at the moon
If you and me cannot be happening soon
