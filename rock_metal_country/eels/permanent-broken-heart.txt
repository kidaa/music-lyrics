I walked by your window
To see if you're home
The candle was burning
I could see you weren't alone
I shouldn't have gone by
But what could i do
I've never known anyone
Who was quite like you

Life ain't very easy when you've got
A permanent broken heart

I walk down the dirty street
And see the old man
But now he seems different
I think i understand
Well maybe he had a love
And swore it was true
But then he blew it away
Just like i lost you

Life ain't very easy when you've got
A permanent broken heart

I'm looking out my window
There's not much of a view
And my hat is still quite blue

Maybe i'll move away
To some other town
And maybe i'll find that thing
I've never found
