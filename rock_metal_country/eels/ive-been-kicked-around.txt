well i've been kicked around
what do you see
am i alright?
i'm alright
i once had a heart
i was ripped from it
chewed up then spat out
like a cherry pit
and if i seem a little hard
it's just that i've been kicked around
i don't know how i got this far
the way that i've been kicked around
uh huh
well i've been kicked around
what do you see
am i alright?
am i alright?
well i've been kicked around
what do you see
am i alright?
am i alright?
i once had a soul
it was torn from me
i won't cry a tear
i will carry me
and if i seem a little hard
it's just that i've been kicked around
i don't know how i got this far
the way that i've been kicked around
don't worry, i'm all right
so if i seem a little hard
it's just that i've been kicked around
i don't know how i got this far
the way that i've been kicked around
the way that i've been kicked around
the way that i've been kicked around
the way that i've been kicked around
the way that i've been kicked around
the way that i've been kicked around
the way that i've been kicked around
