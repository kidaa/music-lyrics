spunky don't like her uniform
it never fit so good
going back to the orphanage
and the place where her garage once stood 
well it's a free-for-all
free-for-all, free-for-all
it's a free-for-all you and me
and if you don't like what they are telling you
you can't teach a blind man to see 
well i can see 
spunky looks good in her bright red wig
eating chocolate chip mint ice cream
a cat named lola with a violent past
is balled-up asleep 'cross her knees 
and it's a free-for-all
free-for-all, free-for-all
it's a free-for-all you and me
one day the world will be ready for you
and wonder how they didn't see 
spunky knows she can save the world
in her own little way
turning in her old uniform
'cause you know it really didn't pay 
'cause it's a free-for-all
free-for-all, free-for-all
it's a free-for-all you and me
i'll walk through the world with your name on my tongue
and your picture etched on my screen
