So whatch'ya gonna do about me
I've been hanging 'round a while
Trading books and knowing glances
I thought i'd stick around
But this really ain't my style

So this ain't heaven on earth
Looks like we'll have to wait
But we are standing at the gate

I took a look inside your attic
And secret shelves and hidden rooms
It didn't scare me when i saw it
Your hidden attic is no temple of doom

And this ain't heaven on earth
Looks like we'll have to wait
But we are standing at the gate

So whatch'ya gonna do 'bout me
Put me on a secret shelf
I wanna change myself around
You know i'd do it
If i thought that it would help
