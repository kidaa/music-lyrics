The smokestack is spitting black soot into the sunny sky
The load on the road brings a tear to the Indian's eye
The Elephant won't forget what it's like inside his cage
The Ringmaster's Telecaster sings on an empty stage
God damn right it's a beautiful day  Ahah
God damn right it's a beautiful day  Ahah
The girl with the curls and the sweet big ribbon in her hair
She's crawled out the window 'cause her daddy just don't care
Come on!
God damn right it's a beautiful day  Ahah
God damn right it's a beautiful day  Ahah
The clown with the frown driving down to the sidewalk fair
Finger on the trigger I tell you he is quite a scare
God damn right it's a beautiful day  Ahah
God damn right it's a beautiful day  Ahah
The kids fit their lids when their heads hear that crazy sound
Their neighbour digs the flavour still he's moving to another town
and i don't believe he'll come back
God damn right it's a beautiful day  Ahah
God damn right it's a beautiful day  Ahah
And I don't know how you're taking all the shit you see
You don't believe anyone but most of all openly agree
God damn right it's a beautiful day  Ahah
God damn right it's a beautiful day  Ahah
