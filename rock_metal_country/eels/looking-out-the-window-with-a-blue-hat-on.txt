oh she comes on like a fog
and then she goes out like a neurotic dog
so now i'm sitting her thinking all day long
looking out the window with a blue hat on
find me an open grave
just push me in
then let me up to live again
so she bought a little book
and filled it up with names she never shook
so i'm just one of them thinking all day long
looking out the window with a blue hat on
find me a sky high cliff
just let me try
to jump right off maybe i'll fly
looking out the window with the blue hat on
find me an open grave
just push me in
then let me up to live again
oh she comes on like a fog
