Little field mice
Living under the house
Never eating much
Tough life for a mouse
And if you think you're gonna be spared you're wrong
Field mice, head lice
Spiders in the kitchen
Don't think twice 'bout
Whatever keeps you itchin
Ice water, flyswatter
Gonna get you trough
The day
Heat is rolling in like
Hell's red rug
Stinking like the breath of beelzebub
And if you think you won't walk on coals you will
Field mice, head lice
Spiders in the kitchen
Don't think twice 'bout
Whatever keeps you itchin
Ice water, flyswatter
Gonna get you trough
The day
