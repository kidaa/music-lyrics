there's a spider crawling on the bathroom mirror
right on top of my right eye
and i can't stop staring back
how did i get this way
take a big look at a living lie 
rags to rags and rust to rust
how do you stand when you've been crushed
so rags to riches was a bust 
sometimes i dream about it
what it's like back home
the railroad tracks and the pussywillow
but i had to leave it
now i go back whenever my tired head hits the pillow 
rags to rags and rust to rust
how do you stand when you've been crushed
so rags to riches was a bust 
busted once again
well i'll show them one day
that i can buy and sell the world 
and one day i'll come through my american dream
but it won't mean a fucking thing 
rags to rags and rust to rust
how do you stand when you've been crushed
so rags to rags and rust to rust
don't let me go
