I've got something
Maybe i should tell you
I may check out
At any given time

Things won't get better
Until they get much worse
Is the curse stronger than me
Or am i stronger than the curse

Everyone is scared of me
And i'm scared of me too
Never know just what i'm gonna do

Heads up, kittens
Everything is bad
The sky is dark now
But it's the best dark i ever had

Hang on to a little thing
And let it guide the way
Bring it with you to
Another day

I've got something
Maybe i should tell you
I'm hanging on here
And i'm really gonna try

Things won't get better
Until they get much worse
Am i stronger than the curse
