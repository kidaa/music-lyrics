i have two eye gut i cannot see
i have a heart but i can not feel anything
don't give up now i'm almost there
i got a mouth but is doesn't say
the things i want it to say today anyway
don't give up now i'm almost there
life's just an ugly mess
the angry soul's in such distress
still there is a time when moments can be sweet
and it feels like someone is smiling down on me
sometimes it feel like i'm all alone
most of the time actually i am alone
that's alright
don't give up now i'm almost there
oh if i had a million bucks it wouldn't matter
'cause my soul's always climbing a ladder
oh i know
don't give up now i'm almost there
life's just an ugly mess
the angry soul's in such distress
still there is a time when moments can be sweet
and it feels like some one is smiling down on me
alright
