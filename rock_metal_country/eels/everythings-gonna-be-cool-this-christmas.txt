Remember last year when you were on your own
You swore the spirit couldn't be found
December rolled around and you were counting on it 
To roll out

Well, everything's gonna be cool this christmas
Everything's gonna be cool this christmas
Everything's gonna be cool this christmas

Well everybody's lookin' for you down at the house
The tree is looking so inspired
There's a yuletide groove waitin' for you to move
I'll go and throw another log on the fire

Everything's gonna be cool this christmas
Everything's gonna be cool this christmas
Everything's gonna be cool this christmas

As days go by the more we need friends
And the harder they are to find
If i could have a friend like you all my life
Well i guess i'd be doin' just fine

Everything's gonna be cool this christmas
Everything's gonna be cool this christmas
Everything's gonna be cool this christmas
