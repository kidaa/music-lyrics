If you're scared of dying you better
not be scared to live.
I've been spending all my days
giving all I can give.
Last night I heard someone walking
through my bedroom door.
What they want I'm not exactly sure.
Chorus:
A friendly ghost,
is all I need. x2
Working time on a broken watch,
countin' days till the the old shop sells me back my saxophone
and everyone's gonna leave me alone.
Two times I thought I heard someone
knocking on the glass.
I hit my head and prayed that it would last.
Chorus
If you're scared of dying you better
not be scared to live.
I've been carrying round a grudge,
I think I better forgive
Last night I heard footsteps walking
on the attic floor.
Got up and I opened up the door.
Chorus
If you're scared of dying you better
not be scared to live.
I've been spending all my days
giving all I can give.
