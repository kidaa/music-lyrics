there's a world outside
and i know 'cause i've heard talk
in my sweetest dream
i would go out for a walk 
but i don't think i'm ready yet
i'm not feeling up to it now
just not that steady yet
and i don't need you telling me how 
there's some happiness
and my stone face cracks again
maybe sometime sooner or later 
but i don't think i'm ready yet
i'm not feeling up to it now
just not that steady yet
and i don't need you telling me how 
so if i leave my room
don't you tell me to lighten up
maybe sometime sooner or later 
but i don't think i'm ready yet
i'm not feeling up to it now
just not that steady yet
and i don't need you telling me how
