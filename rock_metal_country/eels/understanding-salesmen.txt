A knock on the door means
Hello jesus calls
A ring on the phone means
A trip to niagara falls

Daddy don't let me down this time
I'm all alone inside my mind
And it's no small thing
That i must prove to you

A late night card game
With the guys is alright
But i would rather take you
For a test drive

Daddy don't let me down this time
I'm all alone inside my mind
And it's no small thing
That i must prove to you

While i look out
On the passing fields
The sun through the bugs
On the windshield
Makes me feel
Like i
Don't matter

A knock on the door means
Hello jesus calls
A ring on the phone means
A trip to niagara falls
