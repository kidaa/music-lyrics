Sad foot sign
Why you gotta taunt me this way
The happy side is broken now
It's gonna be an awful day
And if i have to drive back by
To see from a different side
Would it be enough to say
The first time was a lie 

Sad foot sign
The end is coming
That's what they say
Maybe you could see it 
In your heart for one day
To let me feel what it's about
To really be alive
To live and breathe and see and feel
Then i can die

And when i come back to this world
I'll put on the uniform
And go into the foot sign shop
Where you were born
