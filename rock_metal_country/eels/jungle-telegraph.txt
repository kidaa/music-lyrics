Mama had a epidural 
hoping I would be a girl. 
The night was black, the sky was blue 
the darker clouds are showing noon 
I heard screaming, the doctor shouts, 
Didn't give in, 
I came out. 
And here I am. 
I found my way, down the street. 
Chicken Hawks, filled with meat. 
The man was big, the gun was loaded, 
she had cash, but never showed it, 
I heard screamin', bleeding throat 
and baby I got on that boat. 
And here I am. 
Now im up here in the trees 
shaking off the bugs and fleas 
the days are long, the sun is beatin' 
He says It says I don't die with you
Send me some lovin' 
Send me some lovin' 
Send it now 
Send it by giraffe, on jungle telegraph
