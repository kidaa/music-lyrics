Jehovah's witness leave me alone
Jehovah's witness i'm not at home
Keep on a-knockin' and ringin' the bells
Knockin' your way straight to hell

Jehovah's witness let's not pretend
That for one second you are my friend
Knock on my door and i'll turn out the light
Close the curtains and turn in for the night

Jehovah's witness why must it be
Just when i'm feeling good i look out and see
You walking up in your very nice suit
Like i'm some old lady who'll give up her loot

Jehovah's witness leave me alone
Jehovah's witness i'm not at home
