This is the day
That i give myself up cold

The dust of ages 
Settles on your days
And so you shake your coat off
And get on your way

Bloodshot and trembling
A new day has begun

The dust of ages
Settles on your days
And you blow it all away
And get on your way

The dust of ages
Settles on your days
But i'm not fuckin' around anymore
I'm on my way
