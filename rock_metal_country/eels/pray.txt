never much of a hope for men
nothing good to say
but i couldn't help it
when i saw her
i had to know if
she don't know where to go
she don't know how to stay
and she don't know how good i can be
or how much i can pray
i pray
and soon i know her a little more
she's everything i dreamed
but still i wonder what it would be like
if she left me
she don't know where to go
she don't know how to stay
but she don't know how good i can be
or how much i still pray
i pray
there must be something that's folowing her
that keeps her from this state
there must be something that makes me want to
pray
pray
i pray
she says she's all right but she's not sure
and i'm not sure what that means
she says she's all right but she needs some help
i don't know how
i don't know how
i don't know how
