Am i gonna be all right?
No i'm not gonna be all right
Nothing is all right now
Am i gonna see the sun come up?
Or am i going down?
'cause every day i'm here
All i feel is sheer
Agony 

Friends tellin' me that maybe i need
Some psychiatric help
Yeah they're always so quick to tell you
Just how to get on with it
But i look into the mirror
And all i see is age, fear
And agony

If i could just remember what it was like
When i was younger
Before all the joy and happiness
Was replaced with hunger
Now all i've got to show for the seeds that didn't grow
Is agony
