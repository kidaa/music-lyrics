takin a walk down to the mall
smellin piss and beer and gas
that could be me in a coupla' years
suckin fumes under the highway pass
on a rainy day
while i wear newspapers for pants 
and a tee shirt that says ";damn i'm good";
people look funny when they cry 
'cause they just can't let it hide
typing into your little box 
press the cry button 
then it unlocks 
on a rainy day
no one has a thing to say
easier to look the other way
take a look in the killer's eyes
and you see there's nothin there
but something is sacred in your eyes
and something to believe 
on a rainy day
and as the world will blow to bits
i'll cradle you and hold you tight
