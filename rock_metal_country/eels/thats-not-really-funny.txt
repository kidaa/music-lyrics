Did you think that I would laugh when you said I was small
Did you think that that would pass as if nothing at all
You say a lot of funny things, my little bunny
And I almost always laugh, but that's not really funny
You play the little bells and tell a good story
You bake delicious pie and that's enough for me
But I don't think that I'm your man, and you're my little honey
And I like what you have to say, but that's not really funny
You must not continue to wear my ?? like me
The neighbour children threw the window to the sea
The little boy will wipe his nose bacause it's runny
Then point at me and laugh, but that's not really funny
