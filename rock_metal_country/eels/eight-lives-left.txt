Eight lives left
One chapter down
Still nothing new
In this old town

I'd like to spend at least
One life with you
Eight lives left
And a heart that wants
To be true

Five miles out
The depot is there
A greyhound is waiting
To take us somewhere

I'd like to spend at least
One life with you
Eight lives left
And a heart that wants
To be true
