The cut great mindwalking through the dirty streets
Of Paris in the hot August heat
Sun melts in the fake
Smile away
Just looking for a place to stay
The actress gave up all her old dreams
And traded up, now she is a queen
Royal families dont have time
for that shit
Your crystall ball you keep it hid
The tractor trailer driver radios
Help me someone I'm out here all alone
Truck drives from the black night away
Praying for the light of day
The kid in the mall works a hot dog on a stick
His head is a funny shape his heart is a brick
Taking your order he willlook away
He doesn't have a thing to say
But me I'm feeling pretty good as of now
I'm not so sure when I got here and how
sun melt in the fake
smile away
I think you know I'll be ok
