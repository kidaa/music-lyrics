Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat 
and coverin' the crossroads I'm standing at 
or maybe it's the weather or something like that 
but mama you been on my mind 

I do not mean you trouble, don't put me down, don't get upset 
I am not pleadinor sayinI can't forget you 
I do not pace the floor, bowed down and bent, but yet 
mama you been on my mind 

Even thomy eyes are hazy 
and my thoughts they might be narrow 
where you been don't bother me, or bring me down with sorrow 
I don't even mind where you be wakinup tomorrow 
but mama you been on my mind 

I'm not asking you to say words like yes or no 
Please understand me, I've no place I'm calling you to go 
I'm just whisperinto myself so I can pretend that I don't know 
Mama you been on my mind 

When you wake up in the morninbaby, look inside your mirror 
you know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near 
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear 
as someone who has had you on his mind 
As someone who has had you on his mind 
Mama you been on my mind
