Standing in the shadows of love 
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come 
Standing in the shadows of love 
I'm just waitin' for the heartaches to come 

I want to run but there's no place to go 
'cause heartaches will follow me I know 
Without your love the love I need 
It's the beginning of the end for me 
'Cause you've taking away all my reason for living 
When you pushed aside all the love I been giving 

Didn't I treat you right now baby didn't I 
Didn't I do the best for you now didn't I 
Don't you leave me 
Standing in the shadows of love 
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come 
Standing in the shadows of love 
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come 

All alone I'm destined to be 
with misery my only company 
Might come today, might come tomorrow 
but it's for sure I ain't got nothing but sorrow 
Now don't your conscience kind of bother you 
How can you watch me cry after all I done for you 
Now hold on a minute 

Didn't I treat you right now honey didn't I 
Didn't I do the best for you now didn't I 
So don't you leave me 
Standing in the shadows of love 
Getting ready for the heartaches to come 
Standing in the shadows of love 
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come 

I want to run but there's no place to go 
'cause heartaches will follow me I know 
Without your love the love that I need 
It's the beginning of the end for me 
Now don't your conscience kinda, kinda bother you 
How can you watch me cry 
after all the things I done for you 

Didn't I treat you right now baby didn't I 
Didn't I do the best for you couldn't I 
Didn't I do right by you didn't I 
Didn't I screw you right now 

Kept you in luxury didn't I 
Didn't I do the best for you didn't I 
Didn't I treat you right now didn't I 
Didn't I do the best for you now didn't I 

I'm trying hard not to cry 
You know my crying ain't gonna help me now 
Without your love the love that I need 
It's the beginning of the end for me 
So don't you leave me 

Standing in the shadows of love 
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come 
Standing in the shadows of love 
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
