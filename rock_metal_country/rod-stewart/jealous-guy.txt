John LennonWhat we really came back to play was this number - Jealous Guy 
I was dreaming of the past
and my heart was beatin' fast,
I began to lose control
I began to lose control

I didn't want to hurt you
And I'm sorry I made you cry, no
I didn't want to hurt you no I didn't care
I'm just a jealous guy

I was feeling insecure
You might not need me anymore
I was shivering inside
I was shivering inside

I didn't want to hurt you
And I'm sorry I made you cry, oww
I didn't want to hurt you no I didn't care
I'm just a jealous guy

I'm just a jealous guy
I'm just a jealous guy
I'm just a jealous guy
I'm just a jealous guy
I don't want nobody messing with you, oh no
Jealous guy

Goodnight cheers. Drive carefully home.
Thank you for your time, and your money.
