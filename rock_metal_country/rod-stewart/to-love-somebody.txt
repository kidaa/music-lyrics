Barry and Robin Gibbwith Booker T. & the MG's 1975 

There's a light,
a certain kind a' light
that never shone on me.
I want my life to be, to live with you.
To live with you.
And there's a way, ev'rybody says,
to do each and ev'ry little thing.
But what does it mean
if I ain't got you, if ain't got you?

'Cause you don't know what it's like
you don't know what it's like 
to love somebody, 
to love somebody 
the way I love you.

If I pray
I see your face again;
But I know not where to find
You ain't got to be so blind
I'm blind, so very very blind
I'm a man, 
can't you see what I am?
I move heaven and earth for you
But what does this man do 
if he ain't got you, if he ain't got you?'cause you don't know what it's like, baby,
you don't know what it's like 
to love somebody, 
to love somebody 
the way I love you, I love you, I love you

'cause you don't know what it's like, baby,
you don't know what it's like 
to love somebody, 
to love somebody 
the way I love you, I love you, I love you, ha

Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah
Oh baby

you don't know what it's like
you never never know what it's like
to love somebody, 
to love somebody 
the way I love you, I love you, I love you
yeah
you never, never know what it's like,
honey
ooh baby
I love ya, I love ya, I love ya
God almighty, I love ya
