Set me free why don't you baby 
Get out of my life why don't you baby 
You really don't want me 
You just keep me hanging on 
You really don't need me 
You just keep me hanging on 

Why do you keep coming around 
playing with my heart 
Why don't you get out of my life 
and help me to make a new start 
Let me get over you 
the way you got over me 

Set me free why don't you baby 
Get out of my life why don't you baby 
You really don't want me child 
You just keep me hanging on 
You never, never, never needed me 
You just keep me hanging on 

You said when we broke up 
you just wanted to be friends 
Tell me, how can we still be friends 
when seeing you just breaks my heart again 
and there ain't nothing I can do about it 

You really don't need me 
You just keep me hanging on 
You really don't need me baby 
You just keep me hanging on 

Set me free why don't you baby 
Set me free why don't you baby 
Get out of my life why don't you honey 
You just keep me hanging on
