You always said living with me was impossible 
Try it I said just like the wind I'm changeable 
We ain't got money but we sure got laughs 
lots of loving too 
So I confess on my behalf 
you're giving me honestly 
the best days of my life 

Your whispering girls said don't be a fool 
don't give into him 
He's an animal treat you like dirt 
then he'll turn you in 
You two are not compatible 
It'll never never last 
They said I wasn't even suitable 
But you're giving me honestly 
the best days of my life 

Sometimes I wonder 
why does she bother with me at all 
So staid in my ways 
Let's face it my dear, I'm insufferable 

The crazy nights spilling into days 
with all my noisy friends 
But they all love you as much as I 
Giving me constantly 
the best days of my life 
And a day without you at this point my dear 
seems unthinkable 
A night without you more often 
than not is unbearable 

But if it all can't work out 
one can never never tell 
In my heart there is no doubt 
you gave to me unselfishly 
the best days of my life 

But if it all can't work out one can never never tell
