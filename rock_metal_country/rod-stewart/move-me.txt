It's obvious darlin' 
you've become allergic to me 
Are my trousers to wide 
Do I drink and get mean 
Is my demeanor that embarrassing 
Are my jokes obsolete 
Or is it my sweat that's no longer sweet 
I work hard in the factory 
to keep you in luxury 
to which you've grown accustomed and you love 
Lately you don't light my fuse 
Is my fan belt coming loose 
Punch me in the Bible baby please 
Move me, move me, move me when I'm home 
Why don't you move me, move me 
move me when I'm home 

Sometimes baby I awake in the night 
I reach out to touch you 
but I'm scared you might bite 
A little emotion wouldn't be out of place 
Wake up and love me put a smile on my face 
Otis Redding said it best  try a little tenderness  
Aretha wanted more  Respect  
Give me just a little touch 
that ain't really asking much 
your dog gets more attention than I do 
Move me, move me, move me when I'm home 
Come on and move me, move me, move me when I'm home 

Sometimes I wonder if you'll miss me at all 
emotionally independent, as hard as a wall 
You're so wrapped up in your own little world 
your old time religion is your lunch with the girls 
When I'm standing next to you even in a crowd 
I might as well be on another planet 
Tell me what I've done to you to justify this ridicule 
if it's over why don't we forget it 
Move me, soothe me, move me, rock me 
move me when I'm home 
Why don't you move me, love me, move me, rock me 
move me when I'm home 
Why don't you rock me, move me, love me, soothe me 
move me when I'm home 
Why don't you rock me, rock me, move me, soothe me 
soothe me when I'm home
