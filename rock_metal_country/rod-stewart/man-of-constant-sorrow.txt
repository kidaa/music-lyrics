I am a man of constant sorrowI've seen trouble all my days 
I'll say goodbye to ColoradoWhere I was born and prob'ly raised 
Your mother says I am a strangerMy face you'll never see no more 
But there's one promise darlingI'll see you on God's golden shore 
Through this open world I'm about to rambleThrough ice, snow, sleet and rain 
I am about to rob the mornin' railroadPerhaps I'll die on that train 
I'm goin' back to ColoradoPlace that I started from 
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat meHoney I never would have come
