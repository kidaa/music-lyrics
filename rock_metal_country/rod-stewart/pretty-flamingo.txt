All around all of the guys call her flamingo 
'cause her hair glows like the sun 
and her eyes light up the sky 

When she walks by 
she moves so fine like a flamingo 
Crimson dress that clings so tight 
She's out of reach and out of sight 

When she walks by 
she brightens up the neighborhood 
and every guy would take her hand 
If he just could, if she just would 

Some sweet day 
I'll make her mine, pretty flamingo 
and every guy will envy me 
cause paradise is where I'll be 

When she walks by 
she brightens up the neighborhood 
and every guy would take her hand 
If he just could, if she just would 
Some sweet day 
I'll make her mine, pretty flamingo 
and every guy will envy me 
cause paradise is where I'll be
