Well if you ever want to come home to me 
I'll still be here waiting 

If you ever change your mind 
about leaving, leaving me behind 
Baby bring it to me, bring your sweet loving 
bring it on home to me 

I know I laughed when you left 
but now I know that I only hurt myself 
Honey bring it to me, bring your sweet loving 
bring it on home to me 
Let me tell you all about it 

I'll give you tulips and money too 
That ain't all, that ain't all I'd do for you 
If you'll bring it to me, bring you're sweet loving 
bring it on home to me 

You know I'll always be your slave 
until I'm buried, buried in my grave 
Oh honey bring it to me, bring your sweet loving 
bring it on home to me 

I tried to treat you right 
but you stayed out, stayed out late at night 
but I forgive you 
Bring it to me, bring your sweet loving 
bring it on home to me 

Just remember this one thing darlin' that 
You, you, you send me, you know this one 
You, you know darlin' you send me 
And I know that you, you thrill me 
Honest you do, honest you do, honest you do 
And I wanna tell you one thing that 

And I know this one thing that 
you send me honest you do, honest you do 
honest you do, let me tell you 
When I get home you're always there for me 
and I know that you're gonna send me 
Honest you do, honest you do, honest you do 
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know 
Well you thrill me 
Darlin' you're always gonna send me
