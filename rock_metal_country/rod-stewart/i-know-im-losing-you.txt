Your love is fading I can feel your love fading 
Woman it's fading away from me 
'Cause your personal touch has grown cold 
as if someone else controls your very soul 
I fooled myself long as I can 
I can feel the presence of another man 
It's there when you speak my name 
It's just not the same 
Oh honey I'm losing you 
I can feel it in the air, it's there everywhere 
Oh I'm losing you 

I can feel it in my bones 
any day you'll be up and gone 
Ooh I'm losing you 
It's all over your face someone's takin' my place 
Could it be that I'm losing you 

When I look into your eyes a reflection of a face I see 
Oh Lord I'm losing you 
I'm hurt, downhearted and worried girl 
'cause that face doesn't belong to me 

Your love is fadin', I can feel it fadin' 
Oh away from me 
I can feel it in the air, it's there everywhere 
ooh I'm losing you 

I don't wanna lose you 
but I know I'm gonna groove you 
Oh Lord I'm losing you, and I'm a losin' you 

Your love is fadin', I can feel it fadin' 
Oh Lord I'm losing you
