You wouldn't read my letters if I wrote them 
You ask me not to call you on the phone 
But there's something I've been waiting for to tell you 
So I wrote it in the words of this song 

Chorus: 
I didn't know God made honky tonk angels 
I might have known you'd never make a wife 
You gave up the only one that ever loved you 
And went on back to the wild side of life 

The glamour of the gay nightlife has lured you 
to the places where the wine and liquor flow 
Where you wait to be somebody else's baby 
And forget the truest love you'll ever know 

chorus 

The glamour of the gay nightlife has lured you 
to the places where the wine and liquor flow 
Where you wait to be somebody else's baby 
And forget the truest love you'll ever know 

chorus
