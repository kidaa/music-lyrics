Nobody feels any pain, 
tonight as I stand inside the rain. 
Ev'rybody knows 
that baby's got new clothes, 
but lately I see her ribbons and her bows 
have fallen from her curls. 

She takes just like a woman, 
she makes love just like a woman, 
and she aches just like a woman. 
But she breaks just like a little girl. 

Queen Mary, she's my friend, 
oh I believe that I'll go see her again. 
Nobody has to guess 
that baby can't be blessed 
till she finds out she's like all the rest, 
with her fog, her amphetamines and her pearls. 

She aches just like a woman, yes she does 
she takes just like a woman, yes she does 
she makes love just like a woman, yes she does 
But she breaks just like a little girl. 

It was raining from the first 
and I was dying there of thirst, 
So I came in here. 
And your long time curse a' hurts, 
but you know honey what's worse 
is this pain in here, 
I can't stay in here, 
ain't it clear. 

Oh I just don't fit, 
I believe that it's time for us to quit. 
When we meet again 
and introduced as friends 
please don't let on 
that you knew me when 
I was hungry and it was your world. 

You fake just like a woman, yes she does 
and make love just like a woman, yes she does 
Then you ache just like a woman, yes she does 
But you break just just like a little girl, break like a girl 

Ooh ooh ooh, ooh, ooh 
Just like a woman, woman, woman.
