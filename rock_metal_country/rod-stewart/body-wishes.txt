The night closes in on another day 
as the oldest game's gettin' underway 
on the minds of a million people body wishes 
So you climb on the carousel and take a chance 
the same old ritual the same old dance 
The hardest thing to resist is body wishes 
If the fire down below's gettin worse and worse 
you're so close to shootin' that you want to burst 
Somebody's sponge needs squeezin' body wishes 

What do I say 
Nobody gonna tell ya 
Where do I go 
Somewhere someone'll have ya 
Who do I tell 
Anybody that'll listen 
No one should know 
Won't solve the problem 
Body wishes, body wishes 
Body wishes, body wishes 

Away in the distance a baby cries 
but you know somebody's by her side 
The night drags on forever body wishes 
You can hear the tickin' of a lonely clock 
the howlin' wind that just won't stop 
Somebody's cherries need pickin' body wishes 

What do I say 
Nobody gonna tell ya 
Where do I go 
Somewhere someone'll have ya 
Who do I tell 
Anybody that'll listen 
No one should know 
Won't solve the problem 

It'll tear you apart like an angry sea 
keep you warm like a summer breeze 
It's all we've got in a cold cold world 
is to love someone 
Body wishes, body wishes 

Somethings happenin' in the air 
It feels so close but you don't know where 
The poorest people's riches body wishes 
And the cheatin' hearts never learn 
Someday somewhere gonna be your turn 
Don't start what you can't finish body wishes 

What do I say 
Nobody gonna tell ya 
Where do I go 
Somewhere someone'll have ya 
Who do I tell 
Anybody that'll listen 
No one should know 
That won't solve the problem 
Where do I run 
Anywhere that'll hide ya 
Who'll be the one 
Yeah 
Body wishes, body wishes 
Body wishes, body wishes 
Body wishes, body wishes 
Body wishes, body wishes 
Body wishes, body wishes
