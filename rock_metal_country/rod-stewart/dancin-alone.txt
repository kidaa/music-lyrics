On a boulevard in Paris 
I met a good old friend of mine 
 Come on over to my place 
bring yourself and a bottle of wine  
So I put on my leathers 
and I tried to look my best 
but I was apprehensive 
I noticed I was the only guest 
It was then I witnessed 
something I'd never seen 
some satisfaction 
dancin' alone 
dancin' alone 
listen

There's a white house in Georgia 
down the Mason-Dixon line 
They got Kentucky Derby winners there 
They got a Lear jet parked outside 
Yeah but every Friday weekend 
when the big tom cat's away 
you'll find the plantation shakin' 
by the butler and the upstairs maid 
Don't need no money, diamonds or cadillacs 
to get all the satisfaction dancin' alone 
dancin' alone 
dancin' alone 

Don't you worry 
'bout the problems of the human race 
get some satisfaction dancin' alone 
dancin' alone baby 
Listen to this 
At a hot spot in Texas 
on an endless Friday night 
I was listenin' to Waylon and Willie 
when a cowgirl passed my sights 
and I took a look in the mirror 
to make sure that my head was screwed on 
I was feeling rejected 
but I wasn't going home 
In a moment of a rash decision 
I threw myself right on the floor 
I did a backflip and somersault 
Yeah, the crowd called for more 
So if you're tired of watching 
being left on the shelf 
get your satisfaction dancin' alone 
dancin' alone, dancin' alone 
dancin' alone, dancin' alone 
dancin' alone baby
