I've got two and more to show 
I was dreaming of a mobile 
that couldn't be mine not without lyin? 
Was I feeling kind a silly 
when I stepped in soakin?beer down the cola machine 
Oh, stayin?seventeen 
Well she claimed she was a killer 
and she owned a flood lit villa 
a little aways from the main highway 
Oh take me way down yonder 

She was tall, thin and tarty 
and she drove a Maserati 
faster than sound 
I was heaven bound 
Although I must have looked a creep 
in my army surplus jeep 
Was I being too bold 
before the night could get old 
No, no, no, no 
She proved me so wrong 

Oh the Italian girls sometimes hold their religious habits 
in front of your eyes, just to get you tied 
Ah but not my little Bella ause I did not have to tell her 
I'd rather you go with the morning sun, she made me so tired 

She took me way, way, away down yonder 
till I was gone with the morning sun on my back 
Gotta get on back there soon as I can 
Take me there 
And I miss the girl so bad 
She broke my heart 
Gotta get on back there soon as I can 
I miss the girl, I miss the girl, I miss the girl so bad 
I was a lot better off
