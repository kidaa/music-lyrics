Willie Dixon
Ain't superstitious,
black cat crossed my trail.
I ain't superstitious,
but a black cat crossed my trail.
Bad luck ain't got me so far,
and I won't let it stop me now.
The dogs begin to bark,
all over my neighborhood.
And that ain't all.
Dogs begin to bark,
all over my neighborhood.
Mmm-mmm
This is a mean old world to live in,
And I can't face it all by myself, at all.
And, dogs begin to bark,
all over my neighborhood.
The dogs begin to bark,
all over my neighborhood.
I got a feelin' about the future,
and it ain't too good, I know that.
I know, I know, I know.
Ain't superstitious,
but black cat crossed my trail,
I said it so many times before
Ain't superstitious,
a black cat crossed my trail.
Bad luck ain't got me so far,
and you know I ain't gonna let it stop me now.
