You ask me if I love you 
and I choke on my reply 
I'd rather hurt you honestly 
than mislead you with a lie 
And who am I to judge you 
in what you say or do 
I'm only just beginning 
to see the real you 

And sometimes when we touch 
the honesty's too much 
and I have to close my eyes and hide 
I want to hold you till I die 
till we both break down and cry 
I want to hold you till the fear in me subsides 

Romance and all it's strategy 
leaves me battling with my pride 
But through all the insecurity 
some tenderness survives 
I'm just another writer 
still trapped within my truth 
A hesitant prize fighter 
still trapped within my youth 

And sometimes when we touch 
the honesty's too much 
and I have to close my eyes and hide 
I want to hold you till I die 
till we both break down and cry 
I want to hold you till the fear in me subsides 

At times I'd like to break you 
and drive you to your knees 
At times I'd like to break through 
and hold you endlessly 
At times I understand you 
and I know how hard you try 
I watched while love commands you 
and I've watched love pass you by 
At times I think we're drifters 
still searching for a friend 
a brother or a sister 
but then the passion flares again 

And sometimes when we touch 
the honesty's too much 
and I have to close my eyes and hide 
I want to hold ya till I die 
till we both break down and cry 
I want to hold you till the fear in me subsides 
Subsides
