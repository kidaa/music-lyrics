Never been a millionaire 
and I tell you mama I don't care 
Never gonna own a race-horse 
or a fast back mid-engine Porsche 
Don't think I'll own a private jet 
on the Stock Exchange I'm no threat 
So won't you help me make up my mind 
Don't you think I'd better get myself back home 

Sitting in the moonlight glow 
excuse me if my feelings show 
Watching all the trucks roll by 
dreaming up an alibi 
You see, back home I'm considered the fool 
but maybe they're right I don't know 
So can't you help make up my mind 
Don't you think I'd better get myself back home 
Who cares 

Daddy says he'll buy me car 
to drive just as far as I need 
He wants me back at any expense 
He's got a lot more money than sense 
Funny but now that I'm gone 
they all wanna be concerned 
Oh please can you make up my mind 
Don't you think I'd better get myself back home 
Just don't know what to do 
Maybe I'll walk, maybe I'll ride, maybe I'll never ever decide 

Get out da way 
I gotta get on home 
I gotta get home as soon as I can
