So far away 
Doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore 
It will be so fine to see your face at my door 
And it doesn't help to know that your just time away 
Long ago I reached for you and there you stood 
Holding you again could only do me good 
Oh how I wish I could 
but you're so far away 

One more song about moving along the highway 
I can't say much of anything that's new 
But if I could only work this life out my way 
I'd rather spend it being close to you 
but you're so far away 
Doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore 
It will be so fine to see your face at my door 
And it doesn't help to know you're so far away 
So far away, yeah you're so far away 

Traveling around sure get's me down and lonely 
Nothing else to do but close my mind 
And I sure hope the road don't get to own me 
There's so many dreams that I've yet to find 
But you're so far away 
Doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore 
It will be so fine to see your face at my door 
And it doesn't help to know 
you're so far away, you're so far away 
You're so far away, you're so far away 
Oh I need to get in touch with ya baby 
You're so very, very, very far away 
You're so, so far away
