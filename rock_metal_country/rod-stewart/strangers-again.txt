Here we go babe putting each other down
I don't know how long this love will last
if we keep kicking it around
We threaten each other with leaving
neither one of us giving in
We're walking on thin ice baby
I don't wanna see it end

And oh I've never let any woman this close to me
Don't let me down 
put in some trust don't give up on us
Strangers again 
We should talk it over
Strangers again 
Let's make love and say we're sorry
Strangers again
We both need a shoulder, don't let it go

I can't stand the silence 
when we don't get along
Both of us believing 
that the other must surely be wrong
So strange how two people
can be so very cruel
Both of us should know by now
neither one's the other one's fool

And oh I've never let any woman this close to me
So don't let me down 
put in some trust don't give up on us
Strangers again
We should talk it over
Strangers again
Let's make love and say we're sorry
Strangers again
We both need a shoulder, don't let it go

Oh I've never let any woman this close to me
So don't let me down
Why don't ya put in some trust 
don't give up on us
Strangers again
We should talk it over
Strangers again
Let's make love and say we're sorry
Strangers again
We both need a shoulder, don't let it go
Strangers again
I don't know what happened
Strangers again
Yesterday was full of passion
Strangers again
We both need a shoulder, don't let it go
