Found my love by the gaswork croft 
Dreamed a dream by the old canalKissed my girl by the factory wall 
Dirty old town, dirty old townI heard a siren from the dock 
Saw a train set the night on fireSmelled the spring on the sulfured wind 
Dirty old town, whoa-oh, dirty old townWe're goin' to take a good sharp axe 
Shining steel tempered in the fireAnd we'll chop you down like an old dead tree 
Dirty old town, dirty old townDirty old town, whoa-oh, dirty old town 
And oh we'll chop you downOh, dirty, dirty, dirty old town 
Dirty old town, dirty old townAnd oh whoa-oh dirty old town 
Chop you down one of these days
