I'm tired of buying Penthouse and Oui and Hustler 
It's Friday night I'm all alone still a bachelor 
She said she'd call me when she'd finished work 
Haven't heard a word all day 
I may not be Warren Beatty or Mohammed Ali 
Attractive female wanted 
I ain't asking a great deal, just a female to move in with me 
Attractive female wanted 
I'll share all my records, toothbrush and car 
and color TV, honestly 
A single girl for my single bed is my remedy 
Attractive female wanted 

She doesn't have to be a movie star 
cover of a magazine 
She can work in a garage all day 
in the evening some canteen 

I'm tired of blind dates making silly mistakes 
It's embarrassing 
Attractive female wanted 
I've had no complaints 
but obviously you've guessed 
no compliments 
Attractive female wanted 

Won't someone please answer my prayers 
before I'm old and grey 
Attractive female wanted 
I've been lonely too long 
all of my family think I'm gay 

She doesn't have to be a movie star 
cover of magazine 
She can work in a garage all day 
in the evening some canteen 

Attractive female wanted 
Active female wanted 
I may get drunk stink like a skunk 
but she'll look after me 
Attractive female wanted 
Put me to bed ease my aching head 
and made fuss of me 
You know what I gonna do 
Think I'll write a letter 
to Mr. Hugh Heffner confidentially 
Dear Sir 
A single girl for my single bed is my remedy
