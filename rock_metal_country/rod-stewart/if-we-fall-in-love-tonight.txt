Pain, flows like a river, just keeps on livin' 
with all them memories 
Shame, you're so heartbroken 
now you're scared to open and give your love again 
And now anticipation waits for love 
Will it be everything you dreamed this time around 
I know you have your doubts 
but I won't let you down 

Darlin' if, if we fall in love tonight 
you're gonna be alright 
your heart is in good hands 
Darlin' if, if we fall in love again 
on me you can depend, if you could take a chance 
Open your heart and let love, love again 

Blame, who's fault is it this time 
I can see it in your eyes, I know you're wonderin' 
Things can change, say you'll be all mine 
I'm gonna love you all the time 
Don't let it slip away 
And now anticipation waits for love 
Will it be everything you dreamed this time around 
I know you've got your doubts 
but honey I won't let you down 

Darlin' if, if we fall in love tonight 
you're gonna be alright 
your heart is in good hands 
Darlin' if, if we fell in love again 
on me you can depend, if you can take a chance 
and open your heart and let love, love again 

Honey I don't, I don't want you to have any doubts about me 
Whatever makes you happy, I'm gonna do 
Baby I'm so ready to love you down 
I can't wait another moment I need you right now 

Darlin' if, if we fall in love tonight 
you're gonna be alright 
your heart is in good hands 
Darlin' if, if we fall in love again 
on me you can depend, if you can take a chance 
[repeat once] 
Open your heart and let love, love again 
[repeat and fade]
