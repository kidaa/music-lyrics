Where was you last night 
And the night before 

You've got his number implanted in your brain, 
he's been calling you, putting on a stupid name, 
I don't own you honey but give me some respect, 
ev'ryone's laughin' laughin' behind my back, 
yeah and I'm jealous, yes I'm jealous, 
Oh! 

You're so cold baby it ain't like it used to be, 
I'm suspicious, you're acting so deviously, 
secret phone calls, when you think I'm not around, 
you've been seen with him all over town, 
yeah and I'm jealous when you look at someone else, 
I'm so jealous, I want you all to myself, 
I'm jealous babe, 
I'm so jealous. 

Now does he buy you ruby rings and perfumes from abroad, 
does he hypnotise you with things I can't afford, 
does he drive a Cadillac, is he white or is he black, 
What's he got that I ain't got, is he really that big 
You bet your life I'm jealous babe, 
yeah, 

You've been seen wit him all over town, baby 
Yes, I'm jealous, goddam' jealous 

You've been to Angelo's for a quiet dinner for two, 
then to Shakey Jake's where you danced until two, 
then to his place where I know you spent the night, 
got my spies girl, and they're all 
jealous 

Did he really blow your mind, 
did he alway treat you kind, 
does he kiss you like I do, 
did he crawl all over you, 
did he have you on the floor, 
were you screaming out for more, 
is he better than I am, 
are you seeing him again. 

I'm so jealous when you look at someone else, 
I'm so jealous, want you all myself, 
I'm so jealous, it's tearing me apart, 
I'm so jealous, it's ripping out my heart, 
I'm so jealous, 
yes I'm so jealous babe, 
I told you once before, 
I'm eatin' out my heart, baby, 
You make me so weak honey.
