Looking out on the morning rain 
I used to feel so uninspired 
But when I knew I had to face another long, long day 
girl I used to feel so tired 

Before the day I met you 
life had been so unkind 
but you're the key to my peace of mind 
'Cause you made me feel, you made me feel 
you made me feel like a natural man 

When my soul was in the lost and found 
you came along to claim it 
I didn't know, I didn't know just what was wrong with me 
till your kiss helped me to name it 
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for 
but if I make you happy I don't need to do more 
'Cause you made me feel, you made me feel 
you made me feel like a natural man 

Oo baby, baby look what you have done to me 
Can't you see that you made me feel so good inside 
Don't you know that I just want to be 
close to you, you made me feel so alive 
'Cause you made me feel, you made me feel 
you made me feel like a natural man 

Baby I ain't doubtful of what I'm living for 
but if I make you happy I don't need to do more 
'Cause you made me feel, you made me feel 
Well you made me feel like a natural man
