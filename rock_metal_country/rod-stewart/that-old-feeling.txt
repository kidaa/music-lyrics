feat. Arturo Sandoval

I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye
My heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me
It's foolish to start
For that old, old feeling is still in my heart

Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me
It's foolish to start
For that old, old feeling is still in my heart
Still in my heart
Still in my heart
