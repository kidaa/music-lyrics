Did you ever stand and shiver while looking at a freezing river 
Have you froze to the bone with just a coat to keep you warm 
to keep you from a howlin' wind to keep you from a howlin' windNow listen 
Have you perished in the drizzling rain 
Tried to light ... a lift but all in vainWith your sock on your head 
and that old coat on your backto keep you from the drizzlin' rain 
oh to keep you from the drizzlin' rainGoodbyeOne more time 
Did you sleep in a graveyard when it snowedLaid your head on a ..... 
With the Times on your face and that old coat on your back 
That kept you from a-withering away good God 
It just kept you from a-withering awayI know 
And did you ride a lift on a steam trainNow listen 
Had the misfortune not to pay your fareThrown off the next stop 
Thrown in the doorway of a shopWith that coat to keep you from the wind 
Oh that old school coat to keep you from the windAnd that ain't all 
Have you had some good friends on the road with ya 
who'd stand by you through thick and thinHere's to Kevin and Ben, Susie and Len 
And that coat which never lets you downIt never, never, never lets you down 
It never, never, never lets you downThat old coat which never lets you down 
That old coat which never lets you down Kept me from the drizzlin' rain 
And oh, kept me from the drizzlin' rain
