I was born and raised the only son of a lawyer 
till I was approximately the age of four or perhaps five 
I lost both my mother and my father 
Killed in a fire way up on the fourteenth floor 
Struck down by the time I was ten by an illness 
which robbed me of the sight of the morning sunAnd that ain't all 
A homeless child for the next five years 
with my dog Clown by my side and my only friend Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
I fought my way through schoolSound and touch the thing on which I could depend 
And you know what the, the, the kids down my street weren't too playful 
And right then it seemed like the whole world picked on meAnd ah yeah 
I worked my fingers to the boneStretchin' hide for a boot man in Jersey Town 
But then, but then I lost the last thing I had 
When fate reared its ugly head and took my dog Clown 
I wandered way up north found a girl that loved like a woman 
Sixteen years old and felt like a woman 
But, but, but, but, but what I'm trying to say is 
God please don't take her away from meI lost everything that I ever had 
you kicked my name into the dirtTread my name into the dirt yeah 
I lost everything that I ever had you kicked my name into the dirt 
What could I do I never knew how much love could hurt me 
But it never ever come my way beforeNo, no, no, no, no 
I never knew how much love could hurt me 
Good God it ain't never come my way before 
Oh but, but you know what I'm trying to sayreally what I'm trying to say is 
God please don't take her away from meAh turn it down 
I lost everything that I ever had you kicked my name into the dirt 
You got a lotta lotta lost everything that I ever had ever had
