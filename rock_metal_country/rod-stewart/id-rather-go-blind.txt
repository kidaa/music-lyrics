Something told me it was over 
when I saw you and him talking 
Something deep down in my soul said 'Cry boy' 
when I saw you and him out walking 
I would rather, I would rather go blind girl 
than to see you walk away from me child 
So you see I love you so much 
I don't want to see you leave me baby 
most of all I just don't, I just don't want to be free 

I was just, I was just sitting here thinking 
of your kiss and your warm embrace child 
When the reflection in the glass 
that I been held to my lips now baby 
revealed the tears I had on my face 
I would rather, I would rather be blind child 
than to see you walk away from me 
Baby, baby, baby I would rather go blind 
than to see you walk away from me
