Single file in the girls corridor 
Come along, Stewart laddie! 

Stewart boy, you'll never be much, 
'cause you're too busy acting the fool. 
Thank you Sir for them few kind words, 
on my last day of school. 

Oh, but my mama said, I could be a success, 
if I'd only get myself out of bed. 
Words of wisdom, but I wasn't list'ning, 
I had plans in my head. 

Only a boy, 
trying it on, 
coming on strong, 
restless to roam, 
only a boy, 
silly and proud, 
reckless and loud, 
impressing the crowd, 
only a boy. 

Rock'n' Roll was in my brain, 
Eddie Cochrane running through my brain. 
Skin tight trousers in council houses, 
the unemployment exchange. 

The blues I played were Mississippi made 
and ev'ry Friday night I'd fall in love. 
Football fields and teenage pills 
nothing's enough. 

Only a boy, 
dressing to kill, 
passion to spill, 
hand in the till. 
Only a boy, 
slipping it in, 
thin as a pin, 
chasing a dream, 
only a boy.

Oh and them dukes of freedom, I used to believe them, 
and all their rebelious vows. 
The critics, the cynics, who never understood it, 
where are they now 

And all the wondering and the stumbling 
that goes hand in hand with change. 
The yearning, the earning was it all part of learning, 
or am I still the same 

Only a boy 
laughing aloud, 
quick as a shot, 
nobody can stop. 
Only a boy, 
plans of his own, 
leaving his home, 
knows where he's going, 
only a boy. 

only a boy, 
only a boy, 
only a boy, ha ha, oh
