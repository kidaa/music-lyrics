Let me tell you about a place, somewhere up in New York way 
where the people are so gay, twistin' the night away 
Here they have a lot of fun, puttin' trouble on the run 
Oh man you'll find the old and young twistin' the night away 

Here's a man in evening clothes, how he got here I don't know 
but oh man, you ought to see him go, twistin' the night away 
He's dancing with a chick in slacks, she's moving up and back 
Oh man, there ain't nothing like twistin' the night away 

Feel much better 

Here's a fellow in blue jeans, who's dancing with an older queen 
dolled up in her diamond rings, twistin' the night away 
Man you ought to see her go, twistin' to the rock and roll 
Here you'll find the young and the old twistin' the night away 

They're twistin', twistin', everybody's doing great 
They're twistin' man, twistin', they're twistin' the night away 
Twistin', you know they're twistin', twistin' the night away 
They're twistin', twistin', man twistin' the night away 

Here they have a lot of fun, puttin' trouble on the run 
Oh man you'll find young and the old twistin' the night away 
Here's a man in evening clothes, how he got here I don't know 
I don't know but man you ought to see him go 
Twistin' the night away
