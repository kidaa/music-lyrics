You ain't gonna get me honey no way 
Tearing down the highway in the pouring rain 
escaping from my wedding day 
I heard the bells ringing in the local church 
the ceremony's nearly under way 
Telegrams came and the cheap champagne 
was driving everybody out of their brains 
But I convinced my best friends I lost my nerve 
and I pleaded I was being framed 

 Sailor show me which way to go  
I screamed out loud 
 Sailor show me which way to go  

Such a deadly silence 
due to my defiance 
the wedding ground to a halt 
Said I changed my mind 
ain't no use in your trying 
so her brother punched me in the throat 
her mother got hysterical 
the bitch was cynical 
father's in the corner drunk 
Picking myself off the floor 
I ran to the door 
damned if I was skippin' on my way 

 Sailor show me which way to go  
You should have heard the noise 
Said  Sailor show me which way to go  

So keep clean girlie 
find a man that's truly 
gonna love you from dusk till dawn 
Keep your front door key 
don't give him up for me 
'cause tomorrow I may be gone 
You see, your wouldbe keepers 
            all night creepin' 
nobody gonna change in there 
Who thinks a marriage life should be like a dog's life 
so let's renew it when the year runs out 

Sailor show me which way to go 
Sailor show me which way to go 

She had a belly full of lust but she had no bust
