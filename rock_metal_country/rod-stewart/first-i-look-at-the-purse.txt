Some fellows look at the eyes
Some fellows look at the nose 
Some fellows look at the size 
Some fellows look at the clothes 
I don't care if her eyes are red 
I don't care if her nose is long 
I don't care if shes underfeed 
I don't care if her clothes are wrong 
First I look at the purse.

Some fellows like the smiles they wear
Some fellows like the legs that talk
Some fellows like the style of their hair,
they want the waist line to be small. 
I don't care if their legs all vein
I don't care if their teeth are big
I don't care if she wears a ring 
Why waste time looking at the waist line 
Cause first I look at the purse....Yeah!

A woman can be as fine as can be 
Kisses sweeter than honey 
That don't mean a thing to me, 
if you ain't got no money, baby. 
Cause if the purse is fat, thats where it's at. yeahaa...

Some fellows like the way they walk, 
the way they swing and sway. 
Some fellows like the way they talk, 
if they can talk talk all day. 
I don't care if she waddles like a duck or talks with a lisp 
I still think I'm in good luck if the dollar bills are crisp 
Cause first I look at the purse....yeah yeah

Keep an eye on the money 
Womans got to have some fine greenbacks hah
I ain't greedy guys, 
Oh I don't wanna work no more
