I may not seem your ideal 
when you look into my eyes 
I don't smoke, I don't tell jokes 
I'm not the custom made size 
But baby let me take you 
out on the highway for awhile 
I'll show you where the man in me 
is when he doesn't hide 
He's cruisin' in the fast lane 
stuck behind the wheel 
Jekyll and Hyde going on inside 
when I'm your automobile 

And let me be your car for awhile child 
shift me into gear and I'll be there 
fill me up with five star gasoline 
I'll be your car I'll take you anywhere 

Don't you know I can't dance 
I don't dig it, I can't see it at all 
You say I'm just a specimen 
and baby I can crawl 
My physique just don't look 
the way the physiques really should 
But then again I've got an engine 
underneath my hood 
When I'm cutting up the road 
with a sports car on my tail 
Frankenstein's inside my mind 
and the wind's inside my sails
