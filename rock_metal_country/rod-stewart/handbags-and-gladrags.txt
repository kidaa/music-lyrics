Ever seen a blind man cross the road 
trying to make the other sideEver seen a young girl growing old 
trying to make herself a bride So what becomes of you my love 
When they have finally stripped you ofThe handbags and the gladrags 
That your Grandad had to sweat so you could buyBabyOnce I was a young man 
and all I thought I had to do was smileYou are still a young girl 
and you bought everything in styleListenBut once you think you're in you're out 
'cause you don't mean a single thing withoutthe handbags and the gladrags 
that your Grandad had to sweat so you could buy 
Sing a song of six-pence for your sakeAnd take a bottle full of rye 
Four and twenty blackbirds in a cakeAnd bake them all in a pie 
They told me you missed school today 
So what I suggest you just throw them all awaythe handbags and the gladrags 
that your poor old Granddad had to sweat to buy 
They told me you missed school todaySo I suggest you just throw them all away 
the handbags and the gladragsthat your poor old Granddad had to sweat to buy ya
