Everywhere I hear the sound 
of marching, charging feet boy'Cause the summer's here 
and the time is right for fighting in the street boyHey think the time is right 
for a palace revolutionWhere I live the game to play 
is just to compromise my solutionWhat can a poor boy do 
except to sing for a rock 'n' roll band'Cause you see bein' London town 
there's just no other place for a street fighting man 
Hey did I tell you that my name was called disturbanceAnd I'll shout and scream 
and I'll kill the king and I'll rail at all his servantsWhat can a poor boy do 
except to sing for a rock 'n' roll band'Cause you see bein' London town 
there's just no place for a street fighting manEverywhere I hear the sound 
of marching, charging feet boy'Cause the summer's here 
and the time is right for fighting in the street boyWhat can a poor boy do 
except to sing for a rock 'n' roll band'Cause you see bein' London town 
there's just no other place for a street fighting man
