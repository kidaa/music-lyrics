It's a common misconception 
about a man's role in this world 
A provider and survivor and 
a winner who must never fail 
But oh how he needs a woman 
to reassure and give him strength 
through the darkest nights 
and the hardest fights 
when there's no other corner left 
When the world outside is threatening 
and all his dreams have been destroyed 
take him in your arms watch all his guards 
melt like a little boy 

Tell him you really need him 
Tell him you really care 
Tell him you'll never leave him 
He'll be satisfied 

And he may not find it easy 
to say what's on his mind 
When he's full of doubt 
say 'we'll work it out' 
God knows how hard he's trying 
And he may never buy you roses 
and forget to notice your hair 
but as long as he says 'I love you my dear' 
that's all you need to hear 

Tell him you really need him 
Tell him you'll aways care 
Tell him you'll never leave him 
He'll be satisfied 

And they say the heart's a hunter 
but it's truth you can't deny 
He may never be everything you want 
but for you he'd lay down and die 
So Friday night when the phone rings 
and he's stuck in a downtown bar 
roll away the stone 
cause the last mile home 
is the longest mile of them all 

Tell him you really need him 
Tell him you'll always care 
Tell him you'll never leave him 
He'll be satisfied 
Tell him you really want him 
Tell him you understand 
and tell him that you love him 
He'll be satisfied
