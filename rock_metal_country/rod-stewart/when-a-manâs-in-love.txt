He wakes up in the morning like a newborn baby
The message on the machine says ";you're driving me crazy";
His feet don't touch the ground
he can hardly wait to see her tonight 
Now every new song on the radio reminds him of her
He says hello to strangers and he's singing in the shower
The sign in his eyes says this guy's got a problem so nice so nice
She don't know what she's doing to him
Every day's like Christmas it sure ain't a dream

When a man's in love when a man's in love
he'll fight like a tiger fly like a dove when a man's in love
He's early on the job and all his friends begin to sense
his attitude has changed he's serene and contented
His feet don't touch the ground he can hardly wait to see her tonight 
And he calls her on the telephone about a dozen times an hour
She's flattered by the avalanche of attention and flowers
He tells all his buddies ";Boys, I've finally found someone for me";
She don't know what she's doing to him
Every day's like Christmas it sure ain't a dream

When a man's in love, when a man's in love
ain't nothin' too hard or too tough when a man's in love
When a man's in love, when a man's in love
he'll fight like a tiger fly like a dove when a man's in love

When a man's in love

She dominates his every thought and dream and conversation
He talks about her constantly with an air of jubilation
There ain't nothin' in the world he wouldn't do to make her little face smile
But oh don't it make you want to smile and dance
May God bless us all with a little romance

When a man's in love, when a man's in love
she's in his heart and running through his blood
when a man's in love

When a man's in love
he'll fight like a tiger, fly like a dove
when a man's in love
when a man's in love
There ain't nothing he can't do
when a man's in love
when a man's in love
