Gerry Goffin, Carole King[A side of Mercury 6052 371, 1973] 

When my friends told me you had someone new,
I didn't believe a single word was true
I told them all I had faith in you.
I kept a-right on sayin'

Oh, no, not my baby,
oh no, not my sweet baby.
You're not like all those other girls
who play with the men's hearts like they were toys.

My mama told me, ";Son when rumors spread 
that there is truth somewhere, 
and you should use your head.";
But sure didn't listen to what she said, 
don't you know I kept a-right on sayin'Oh, no, not my baby,
oh no, not my sweet baby.

You're not like all those other girls
who lead you on and tell you lies
No, no, my baby

Tell me, baby
I don't believe what they say, no

Oh, no, not my baby,
oh no, not my sweet baby.
Oh, no, not my baby,
oh no, not my sweet baby.
Not my baby, not my baby
Not my baby, not my baby
Not my baby, not my baby
Not my sweet sweet baby,
Not my baby, not my baby
Not my baby, not my baby
Not my baby, not my baby
No way, not my baby
Not my baby, not my baby
not my sweet sweet baby
Oh, no, not my baby,
oh no, not my sweet baby.
Oh, no, not my baby,
oh no, not my sweet baby.
Oh, no, not my baby,
oh no, not my sweet baby.
Oh, no, not my baby,
oh no, not my sweet baby.
