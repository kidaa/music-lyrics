That's all right my mama, that's all right for you 
That's all right my mama any old way you do 
But that's all right, well that's all right 
Well that's all right my mama 
any way that you wanna do 

My mother she did tell me 
Papa did tell me too 
Son, that woman that you're foolin' with 
she ain't no good for you 

I'll be leaving here tomorrow 
leaving here for sure 
you ain't gotta be bothered with me 
hangin' 'round your door
