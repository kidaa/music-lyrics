If there's doubt and you're cold,
don't you worry what the future holds.
We've gotta have heroes to teach us all
to never give up on a dream.

Claim the road, touch the sun,
no force on earth could stop you run.
When your heart bursts like the sun
never never give up on a dream.

Shadows fall, daylight dies,
freedom never got a place to hide.
Search forever photo finish line
but never give up on your dream.

Crazy notions fill your head,
you gotta break all the records set.
Push yourself until the end
but don't you ever give up on your dream.

Now listen to me 
you don't need no restrictions yeah
Oh, sing it again
you can't live on sympathy.
You just need to go the distance,
oh the distance
that's all you need to be free, 
to be free, to be free, to be free.

Sing a song for me children 
you don't need no restrictions yeah
you can't live on sympathy.
You just need to go the distance, 
that's all you need to be free,

Now listen to me!
Inspiring all to never lose, 
it'll take a long long time before they fill your shoes 
it'll take somebody, somebody, who's lot like you 
who never gave up on a dream.
No, you never gave up on a dream 
no, you never gave up on a dream.

You never, never, never, 
never gave up on a dream
