Can I tell you what you mean to mean 
You're as central as the air I breathe 
Almost impossible to believe that you're mine 
You're like weekends all year long 
under a hot Jamaican sun 
You are a winner at a hundred to one 
yes you are 

Something you've got is something I need right now 
You don't have to prove it no more 
I'm down on my bended knees honey 

What am I gonna do I'm so in love with you 
What am I gonna say if ever you go away 

One in a million oh so rare 
a nightengale in Berkeley Square 
and baby I ain't goin?nowhere without you 
You are the goal that wins the game 
the very last bus home in the rain 
You're like rock and roll and champagne 
all in one 

Something you've got is something I need right now 
Let's not mess around any more 
I'm down on my bended knees honey 

What am I gonna do I'm so in love with you 
What am I gonna say if ever you go away 
What am I gonna do I'm so in love with you 
What am I gonna say if ever you go away 

I'll be a sleek one of a kind 
and so difficult to define 
I could drink a case of you any time 

The Sistine Chapel and the Eiffel Tower 
a national anthem an April shower 
tomorrow's fashion and now I've found you 
I'm complete 

Something you've got is something I need right now 
You don't have to prove it no more 
I'm down on my bended knees honey 

What am I gonna do I'm so in love with you 
What am I gonna say if ever you go away 

I'm like a schoolboy in your hands 
I wanna get up and sing and dance 
You see one hell of a happy man standing here 

Individually quite unique 
You really swept me off my feet 
and baby you look oh so neat 
with nothing on
