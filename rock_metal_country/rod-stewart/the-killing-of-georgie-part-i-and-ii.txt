In these days of changing ways 
so called liberated days 
a story comes to mind of a friend of mine 

Georgie boy was gay I guess 
nothin' more or nothin' less 
the kindest guy I ever knew 

His mother's tears fell in vain 
the afternoon George tried to explain 
that he needed love like all the rest 

Pa said there must be a mistake 
how can my son not be straight 
after all I've said and done for him 

Leavin' home on a Greyhound bus 
cast out by the ones he loves 
A victim of these gay days it seems 

Georgie went to New York town 
where he quickly settled down 
and soon became the toast of the great white way 

Accepted by Manhattan's elite 
in all the places that were chic 
No party was complete without George 

Along the boulevards he'd cruise 
and all the old queens blew a fuse 
Everybody loved Georgie boy 

The last time I saw George alive 
was in the summer of seventy-five 
he said he was in love I said I'm pleased 

George attended the opening night 
of another Broadway hype 
but split before the final curtain fell 

Deciding to take a short cut home 
arm in arm they meant no wrong 
A gentle breeze blew down Fifth Avenue 

Out of a darkened side street came 
a New Jersey gang with just one aim 
to roll some innocent passer-by 
There ensued a fearful fight 
screams rang out in the night 
Georgie's head hit a sidewalk cornerstone 

A leather kid, a switchblade knife 
He did not intend to take his life 
He just pushed his luck a little too far that night 

The sight of blood dispersed the gang 
A crowd gathered, the police came 
An ambulance screamed to a halt on Fifty-third and Third 

Georgie's life ended there 
but I ask who really cares 
George once said to me and I quote 

He said 'Never wait or hesitate 
Get in kid, before it's too late 
You may never get another chance 
'Cos youth a mask but it don't last 
live it long and live it fast' 
Georgie was a friend of mine 

Oh Georgie stay, don't go away 
Georgie please stay you take our breath away 
Oh Georgie stay, don't go away 
Georgie please stay you take our breath away 
Oh Georgie stay, don't go away 
Georgie, Georgie please stay you take our breath away 
Oh Georgie stay
