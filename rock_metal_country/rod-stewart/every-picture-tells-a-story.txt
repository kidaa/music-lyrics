Spent some time feelin' inferior 
standing in front of my mirror 
Combed my hair in a thousand ways 
but I came out looking just the same 

Daddy said, 'Son, you better see the world 
I wouldn't blame you if you wanted to leave 
But remember one thing don't lose your head 
to a woman that'll spend your bread' 
So I got out 

Paris was a place you could hide away 
if you felt you didn't fit in 
French police wouldn't give me no peace 
They claimed I was a nasty person 
Down along the Left Bank minding my own 
Was knocked down by a human stampede 
Got arrested for inciting a peacful riot 
when all I wanted was a cup of tea 
I was accused 
I moved on 

Down in Rome I wasn't getting enough 
of the things that keeps a young man alive 
My body stunk but I kept my funk 
at a time when I was right out of luck 
Getting desperate indeed I was 
Looking like a tourist attraction 
Oh my dear I better get out of here 
'for the Vatican don't give no sanction 
I wasn't ready for that, no no 

I moved right out east yeah! 
On the Peking ferry I was feeling merry 
sailing on my way back here 
I fell in love with a slit eyed lady 
by the light of an eastern moon 
Shangai Lil never used the pill 
She claimed that it just ain't natural 
She took me up on deck and bit my neck 
Oh people I was glad I found her 
Oh yeah I was glad I found her 

I firmly believe that I didn't need anyone but me 
I sincerely thought I was so complete 
Look how wrong you can be 

The women I've known I wouldn't let tie my shoe 
They wouldn't give you the time of day 
But the slit eyed lady knocked me off my feet 
God I was glad I found her 
And if they had the words I could tell to you 
to help you on the way down the road 
I couldn't quote you no Dickens, Shelley or Keats 
'cause it's all been said before 
Make the best out of the bad just laugh it off 
You didn't have to come here anyway 
So remember, every picture tells a story don't it
