If today was not an endless highway 
If tonight was not a crooked trail 
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time 
then lonesome would mean nothing to you at all 

Ah but only if my own true love is waitin' 
Yes and if I could hear her heart a softly poundin' 
only if she were lying by me 
would I rest in my bed once again 

I can't see my reflection in the mirror 
I can't speak the sounds that show no pain 
I can't hear the echoes of my footsteps 
and can't remember the sound of my own name 

Ah but only if my own true love is waitin' 
Yes and if I could hear her heart a softly poundin' 
only if she were lying by me 
would I rest in my bed once again 

There's beauty in the silver singin' river 
There's beauty in the sunlight in the sky 
But none of these, and nothing else 
can steal the beauty 
that I remember in my true love's eyes 

Ah but only if my own true love is waitin' 
Yes and if I could hear her heart a softly poundin' 
only if she were lying by me 
would I rest in my bed once again
