Bring over some of your old Motown records 
We'll put the speakers in the window and we'll go 
on the roof and listen to the Miracles 
echo to the alley down below 

Let's dance together just for the night 
Let's don't worry about the future or nothin' else 
'Cause just like the music's sayin' you gotta take chances 
Go ahead just do it and trust yourself 

There's a soul in the city 
watching over us tonight 
There's a soul in the city 
saying everything's gonna be all right 

So bring over some of your old Motown records 
We'll put the speakers in the window and we'll go 
on the roof and listen to the Miracles 
echo to the alley down below 

They wish us luck 
but they think we're just dreaming 
Let's prove them wrong baby 
'Cause you know what luck is 
luck is believing you're lucky 
that's all and showing just a little bit of faith 

There's a soul in the city 
watching over us I swear 
There's a soul in the city 
there's a whole world waiting out there 

Listen 
I got plans for us 
playing like a skip on a record 
through my head all night long 
But when we walk that darkened stairway 
and step out on the roof 
I know what we're feeling can't be wrong 

Bring over some of your old Motown records 
We'll put the speakers in the window and we'll go 
on the roof and listen to the Miracles 
echo to the alley down below 

Bring over some of your old Motown records 
We'll put the speakers in the window and we'll go 
on the roof and listen to the Miracles 
echo to the alley down below 
'Let the Temptations sing it one time' 
Bring over some of you old Motown records 
We'll put the speakers in the window and we'll go 
on the roof and listen to the Miracles 
echo to the alley down below
