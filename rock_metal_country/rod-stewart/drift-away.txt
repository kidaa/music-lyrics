Never get to bed before sunup, 
alway get caught in the rain; 
sometimes I might get in trouble, 
never was one to complain. 
Now gentleman, you must agree 
ain't it worth it when you're out on cloud thirty-three 
to be stone cold sober again, 
down in the alley again, 
stone cold sober again. 

Never found a dime in a gutter, 
always get my best friends drunk. 
If the pres'dent tries to call me, 
say   Rodney, come on over for lunch ; 
I'd say,   Gentlemen, exuse me please 
but I'm busy with my buddies up on cloud thirty-three.  
Yeah, stone cold sober again, 
down in the alley again, 
stone cold sober again. 

Sunday is a drag, so forget it, 
Monday you can make up for that; 
Tuesday, take a taste for dinner, 
if you're all right spend it in bed. 
But on Thursday prepare for your weekend 
and let Friday disappear into Saturday mornin' 
when you're stone cold sober again, 
down in the alley again, 
stone cold sober again. 
stone cold sober again, 
down in the alley again, 
stone cold sober again. 

I don't mind stone cold sober again, 
down in the alley again, 
stone cold sober again.
