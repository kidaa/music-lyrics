Paul Samwell-Smith, James McCarty and Keith Relf 

Shapes of things before my eyes
Has helped me to despise
will time make men more wise?

Here within my lonely frame.
My eyes just hurt my brain
will time make men more sane?

Come tomorrow will I be older?
Come tomorrow maybe a soldier now listen
Come tomorrow, maybe I'm older than today.

Listen to this
Here within my lonely frame.
My eyes just hurt my god-darn' brain
will time make men more sane?
