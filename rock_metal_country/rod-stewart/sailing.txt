am sailing, I am sailing, 
home again 'cross the sea. 
I am sailing, stormy waters, 
to be near you, to be free. 

I am flying, I am flying, 
like a bird 'cross the sky. 
I am flying, passing high clouds, 
to be with you, to be free. 

Can you hear me, can you hear me 
thro' the dark night, far away, 
I am dying, forever trying, 
to be with you, who can say. 

Can you hear me, can you hear me, 
thro' the dark night far away. 
I am dying, forever trying, 
to be with you, who can say. 

We are sailing, we are sailing, 
home again 'cross the sea. 
We are sailing stormy waters, 
to be near you, to be free. 

Oh Lord, to be near you, to be free. 
Oh Lord, to be near you, to be free, 
Oh Lord.
