I'm drinkin' again
Thinkin' of when
You left me
That happened once so long ago, hmm

I've been havin' a few 
And wishin' that you
Were right here by my side

Well I'm makin' the rounds
And settin' them up
A total stranger to myself
I'm just makin' a fool of myself

I'm just hopin' that you'll come right back once, someday,
But I know, I know, I know
That there's no second time around

Hmm. Now, listen!
I know, I know, I know.

Sure I know I can borrow a smoke
Or sit here all night long and tell a joke
But after all is said and done
Who's gonna laugh,
Who's gonna laugh at a broken, a broken heart?

I've been drinkin' again
And thinkin' of when
Of when you left me
And that weren't so long ago,

Hmm
I've been havin' a few
You know that you know, 
And wishin' that you
Were here right by my side

Hmm
Now listen one time!
I've been drinkin' again
I've been drinkin' again
Sometimes I can't help myself.
Hmm
