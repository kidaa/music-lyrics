thrill is gone
the thrill is gone away
I know the thrill is gone
the thrill is gone away
now you've done me wrong
you'll be sorry someday

the thrill is gone
it's gone away from me
yeah the thrill is gone
thrill is gone away from me

don't know if I'll still live on
but so lonely I'll be

the thrill is gone
it's gone away for me
oh the thrill is gone baby
it's gone away for good
someday I know I'll be over it all
just like I know a man should 

now I'm free free
now baby, free from your spell
well I'm
free free free 
now free from your spell

and I know it's all over
all I can do is wish you well
