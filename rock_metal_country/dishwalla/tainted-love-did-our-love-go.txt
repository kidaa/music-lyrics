sometimes i feel i've got to
run away
i've got to 
get away
cause you don't really want any more from me

to make things right
you should know the time
and they say love is play
well i'm sorry i don't play that way

once i ran to you
now i run from you
this tainted love you've given
i give you all a boy can give you
take my tears and that's not nearly all

tainted love
whoa-ohhh
tainted love

sometimes i feel i've got to
run away
i've got to 
get away
from the pain you drive into the heart of me

the love we shared 
seemed to go nowhere
though i've lost my mind
and i toss and turn i can't sleep at night

once i ran to you
now i run from you
this tainted love you've given
i give you all a boy can give you
take my tears and that's not nearly all

tainted love

don't touch me please 
i cannot stand the way you tease
c'mon girl i love you so
but i don't want you back 
so please let go

tainted love
whoa-ohh
tainted love
whoa-ohh

baby baby
where did our love go
oh can you tell me
do you really love me

cause i've got this 
burning burning yearning
feeling inside me
oooh deep inside me
and it hurts so bad

oh now that i've been surrounded
so hard to see
you let me believe 
you really love 
do you really love
me

baby baby baby
where did our love go
oh tell me
do you really love me

oh baby baby baby
where did our love go
oh can you tell me

do you really love 
do you really love

me

tainted love
tainted love

touch me baby tainted love
touch me baby tainted love
