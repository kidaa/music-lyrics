You're not angry at me
You're just angry
And I'm just standing here while you're down
Now I see the real world
When it's too late
When it's too late to matter now

Truth serum is in your veins
You're saying things I can't explain
Truth serum is in your veins
Saying things I can't explain

They always say the truth will find a way
It makes you sick cause you can't fake it
They always say the truth will find a way
Truth serum is in your veins

And now I see you stripped down
Never before have I ever seen you drown
Cause you're not angry at me
You're just angry
And I'm just standing here while you're down

Truth serum is in your veins
You're saying things I can't explain
Truth serum is in your veins
You're saying things I can't explain

Truth serum is in your veins
You're saying things I can't explain
Tell me more or I'll shove you around
