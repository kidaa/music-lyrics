He's a pro
Cause you'll find he'll go harder
And so hard B he'll step right in
So nice, he'll take a bullet for you

Hey, save your praises
Cause I've gone upside down
Hey, save your praises
Cause I've gone upside down B Spun around

Fresh surprise, cause you'll find
Free advice
He's so kind
Jump right in, and so high
He'll take a bullet for you

He'll take a bullet for you
I've gone upside down
