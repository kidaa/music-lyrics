You feel nervous
So much you can't swallow
Now you sit here worthless
Watch her sing, watch her shaking up my life
You're so blind
I know that you know

She makes me feel 
Like a man in a spaceship going down
Where no one has gone before
Far away so far away from here

You're so blind
You're sublime
I know that you know

Tonight could be all that is pure
For a night on the Lincoln bedroom floor
Too much is enough for us to burn
Shut up and listen to your life
Listen to your life B you're so blind
