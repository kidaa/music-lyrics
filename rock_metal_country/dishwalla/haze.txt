Untie
The hands that bind your mind
And be nice
She put a gun against her ear
Inside
Against a gin and tonic sky
She's a star
She finds a place to lose her pain

Caged as she waits inside
Hate and she wants to die
And she wants, and she wants to live

Deny
The problem never catches light
Rewind
She pours herself some self respect

Caged as she waits inside
Hate and she wants to die
And she wants, and she wants to live
She wants, she wants to live
She wants 
She wants, she wants to live 
Away from this haze
Away back from this haze

Still she's caged as she waits inside
Hate and she wants to die
And she wants, and she wants to live
She wants to live
Caged as she waits inside
Hate and she wants to die
Get me back from this haze
Get me back from this haze
Get me back from this haze
