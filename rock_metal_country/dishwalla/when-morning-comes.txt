feel the burn
feel the demons come to mix
fill the street with madness - don't
lay your hands and lesions over me
fall instead where midnight dies and 
morning comes
feel it here the silence

there's so much life here
and so much pain - we forget
there's so much life 
as morning comes
and its real - the silence

see the sun forever falling 
let the setback slip through the cracks 
keep us safe from ever crawling
let me know a life so sweet

there's so much life here
and so much pain - we forget
there's so much life 
as morning comes
and its real - the silence

say you wanted love
and you want it to feel
so real forever - well 
remember why you have come
and all the shit that's caving in is gone forever
