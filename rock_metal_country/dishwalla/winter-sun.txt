I could hear you fall,
I could feel your body through the floor,
And all I see is the red of your blood for the first time
As i hold you there,
As i rush your pale life through the door, 
I feel the heat rise up, from your shape in the cold light,

Will the winter sun keep us warm, in these cold times?
Will the winter sunlight keep you warm, untorn, untorn and alive?

See them hold you down,
Never felt them push me back to the wall,
Still i hear you cry terrified for the first time, first time

Will the winter sun keep us warm, in these cold times?
Will the winter sunlight keep you warm, untorn, untorn and alive? alive?

I would give my life to keep you safe, for a lifetime,
I would give my life to keep you safe, for a lifetime,
I would give my life to keep you safe, for a lifetime,

Will the winter sunlight keep you warm, untorn, untorn and alive?
Will the winter sunlight keep you warm, will it keep you warm, untorn, untorn and alive, untorn and alive?
