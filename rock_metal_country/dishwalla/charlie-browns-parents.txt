I can't hear what you're saying
What you're doing to me
It would take the jaws of life to pry open your words
so pry open your words

I don't want to talk about Elvis
No I don't want to go on pretending
It feels like I'm talking to
Talking to Charlie Brown's Parents
It feels like I'm talking to
A lonely man without a vision
Stuffed his mouth with indecision
Why he's a lonely man without a vision
Stuffed his mouth with indecision

I can't hear what you're saying
What you're doing to me
Can't you see
It would take the jaws of life to pry open your words

I don't want to talk about Jesus
And I don't want to go on converting, no
It feels like I'm talking to
Talking to Charlie Brown's Parents
It feels like I'm talking to 
A lonely man without a vision
Stuffed his mouth with indecision
He's a lonely man without a vision
Stuffed his mouth with indecision

I can't hear what you're saying
What you're doing to me
Can't you see
It would take the jaws of life to pry open your words

Why he's a lonely man without a vision
Stuffed his mouth with indecision
He's a lonely man without a vision
Stuffed his mouth with indecision
I can't hear what you're saying
What you're doing to me
can't you see
It would take the jaws of life to pry open your words
to pry open your words
