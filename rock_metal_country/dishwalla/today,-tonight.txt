waiting for a train to catch
waiting for the perfect match
waiting for someone to make a call
if only you had to make a change
every day and every night
as every hour goes

Today, tonight
tomorrow, the next night
too long too late
till then I'll wait

waiting for the plane to crash
waiting how long can you stand
and you hope it never ends
every day and every night
as every hour goes

Today, tonight
tomorrow,the next night
too long too late
till then I'll wait
