You were so perfect I couldn't see
That something was broken underneath
That you were so fragile, a landslide
You could give way

Pulling the world up overhead
You want me to pull you from the ledge
But I've got no answers, in the end
I hope you understand

So much time has passed us by
Though you try to make things right
You just give away tonight

Life was so perfect, we couldn't see
That something was broken underneath
That life is so fragile, a landslide
We could give way
