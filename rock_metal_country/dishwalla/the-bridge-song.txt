I don't know where to go
So I guess I have to fly
I'll have to dream of all good things before I die

So where to go
Lord I guess I'll have to fly
I'll have to dream of all good things before I die

And it's getting so much harder to be one these days
So much harder to believe 
So much harder to be one these days
So much harder to believe

And did they know that they'd need a fence so high
Cause giving up is a total waste of time
I stop to breathe in air B as I
Watch the ground beneath us blend into the sky
I don't know where to go
