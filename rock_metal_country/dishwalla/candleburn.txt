on Vineland past the candle shrine that burns on every night
for someone
she lets herself go
like an angel in the snow
she lays down on her back
down on her back - she goes

take me over when I'm gone
take me over make me strong 
take me over when I'm gone 
will they burn for me

on Vineland past the candle shrine that melts into the street design
she waits - for someone
tonight she'll give herself away
she'll break apart all by herself
its so easy how we come undone

take me over when I'm gone
take me over make me strong 
take me over when I'm gone 
will they burn for me

she pulls me in - strips me down
she pulls me in - turns me out
she pulls me in - strips me down

take me over when I'm gone
take me over make me strong 
take me over when I'm gone 
will they burn for me
will they burn for me
