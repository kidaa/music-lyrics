When you close your eyes 
Do you like what you see
Inside your mind
Do you like to dream about the stars above
Once in a while

Don't go to the other side, for nothing at all
Better make it worth your while
Gonna break down that wall, gonna take the fall

Don't go to the other side
You might mess up that hair
Just wait you might change your mind
To think that people might care, about your hair anyway

Don't go to the other side
Just get down on your knees
Show me what you are made of 
I'm begging you please, just please go away

Don't go to the other side
