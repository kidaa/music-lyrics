You're not the one to live for
You're not the one to die for 
And you think you know what life's about
But when the bottom of the floor starts falling out
It's falling out

Last night at the party, you let it out
You never seem happy, it wears me out
At something so stupid, you wear the crown
And there will always be this thing you just can't live without
So pull your head out

Later at the party I was passing out
You're something so filthy, it eats me out 
At needs never ending, you wear the crown
And there will always be this thing you just can't live without
So pull your head out
