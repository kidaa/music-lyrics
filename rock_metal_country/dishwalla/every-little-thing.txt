Let me in
to see you in the morning light
to get me on and all along the tears they come
see all come
I want you to believe in life
but I get the strangest feeling that you've gone away
will you find out who you are too late to change?
I wish I could be 
every little thing you wanted
all the time
I wish I could be 
every little thing you wanted
all the time 
some times

lift me up 
just lift me up don't make a sound
and let me hold you up before you hit the Ground
see all come
you say your all right
but I get the strangest feeling
that you've gone away- you've gone away
and will you find out who you are too late to change?

I wish I could be 
every little thing you wanted
all the time
I wish I could be 
every little thing you wanted
all the time 
some times

Don't give me up
don't give me up tonight
or soon nothing will be right at all
salvation 
will you find out who you are too late to change?

I wish I could be 
every little thing you wanted
