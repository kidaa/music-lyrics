you had something to hide
you should've hidden it shouldn't you?
and now you're not satisfied
with what you've been put through

it just time to pay the price
not listening to advice
deciding on your youth
on the policy of truth

it used to be so different now
it used to be so civilized
you will always wonder how
it could've been if you only lied

it's too late to change events
it's time to face the consequence
delivering the proof 
on the policy of truth

never again is what you swore 
the time before

the time before

and now you're standing there tongue tied
better learn your lesson well
and hide what you want to hide
and tell what you have to tell

see the problems multiply
if you continually decide
to faithfully pursue
the policy of truth

the policy of truth

never again is what you swore 
the time before

the time before
