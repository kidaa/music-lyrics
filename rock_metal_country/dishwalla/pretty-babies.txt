Everything about the world is sex
And it's a message, of popular culture
Telling all our children how to do it right
And all through their innocence you may ask yourself why?
why the need?
why the need to eroticize our children?

Oh our pretty babies
How they're ready
Oh our pretty babies
Oh how they're not ready

Just down the street in beautiful
There is tension, for a popular child
And it doesn't get much worse than that
In little beds in little rooms
Are the lost things, are the silver spoons
Why the need?
Can't you see all the damage that it's doing?

Oh our pretty babies
Oh how they're ready
Oh our pretty babies
Oh how they're not ready

And does it bother you to see her
Wrapped up?
Why the need?
And why the need to eroticize our children?
Oh our pretty babies
Oh how they're ready
Oh our pretty babies
Oh how they're not ready
