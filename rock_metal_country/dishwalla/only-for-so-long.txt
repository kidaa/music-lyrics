How many times has this gone on?
Call 'cause it's just been too long
Say it's good to hear it's going fine
Check that you're still featured in my mind

Tell me what you want to hear
And I'll play along
Tell me when you want me near
And I'll play along
But only for so long

Show me scars where it began
And I will come with violins
I don't need a clock to know it's wasted time
What's your mood ring doing now?

Tell me if you want me near
And I'll play along
Tell me what you love to fear
And I'll play along
But only for so long
Only for so long
Only for so long

Tell me if you want me near
And I'll play along
Tell me what you love to fear
And I'll play along
