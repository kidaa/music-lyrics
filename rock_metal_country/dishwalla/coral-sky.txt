Summertime, it's been almost a year since Coral Sky
All the time, I could tell that you were just untouchable
So I left alone said I had to go
Made it like I didn't care

Hey, don't let the sun go down
Don't let it end here now
Cause you're right, and I'm everything you're not
Could I ever be the one

Summertime, I can't believe she's in my head again
Don't you confuse
I might put up a fight, but I'm not bulletproof 
So I left alone just me and my Patron
Summer dies and so could I

Hey, don't let the sun go down
Don't let it end here now
Cause you're right, and I'm everything, everything, everything I'm not

Hey, don't let the sun go down
Don't let it end here now
Cause you're right, and i'm everything, everything, everything i'm not
cause you're right you're wrong, and i'm everything you're not
Cause you're right, i'm wrong
Could i ever be the one
Be the one
