I have never known such pure madness
And for her it's all she can see
I have never known such pure madness
And for her it's all she can see

How she laid low, laid low on the floor
How she yelled no, how she yelled with all of her 
Heart no
Still it's all she can see

And how the pain ran deep

How she holds her eyes to the ground
What a waste of soul, what a waste
Never, never, never will she
Live without it, think about it, can she live without it?
Never will she live without it
Still its all she can see
No more

Still it's all it's all
All she can see
Still it's all its all
All she can see
Still it's all
It's all she can see
