It's gonna take some time this time
To get myself in shape
I really fell out of line this time
I really missed the gate

Birds on the telephone line
Are crying out to me
I won't be so blind next time
And I'll find some harmony

But it's going to take some time this time
And I can't make demands
Like the young trees in the wintertime
I'll learn how to bend

After all the tears we've spent
How could we make amends
So it's one more round for experience
And I'm on the road again

And it's gonna take some time this time

It's going to take some time this time
No matter what I've planned
Like the young trees in the wintertime
I'll learn how to bend

After all the tears we've spent
How could we make amends
So it's one more round for experience
And i'm on the road again

And it's gonna take some time this time

yeah

It's gonna take some time yeah
It's gonna take some time

I'll learn how to bend
I'll learn how to bend
I'll learn how to bend

It's gonna take some time
It's gonna take some time
yeah
I'll learn how to bend
yeah

It's gonna take some time
It's gonna take some time
