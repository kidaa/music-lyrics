I feel it in the bones,
The creeps are in the stones
And i cant live another life among these streets of you

I can feel it in my head, another lie,
I see the rising in the dirt, another lie

Lately, lately, lately, lately

I feel it in the bones,
The creeps are in the stones
And i cant live another life among these streets of you
