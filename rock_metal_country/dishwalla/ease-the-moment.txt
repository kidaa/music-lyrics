Say that this life's unkind
Blasted out silent mind and quiet pain
They say we run with a demon's lie
But sometimes they break

And sometimes the angels
Keep us safe from drowning
So find a reason to live
Silence, love is in reach
They say that my love is
I won't go away
And all of my demons die
They just fade away

They just fade away

Say that this life is kind
If you ease up the moment
And shine like the sun
They say we run with a demon's lie
But sometimes they break

And sometimes the angels
Keep us safe from drowning
So find a reason to look
To the sky, keep it in reach
Say that my love is
I won't go away
Move in a moments kind
They just fade away
They just fade away

[interlude]

They say that this life's unkind
They rise as the demons lie
Fade away
Just fade away
And all of my demons die
They just fade away
say that my love is
I won't go away

And all of my demons die
I just fade away

say that my love is
I won't go away

And all of my demons die
Just fade away
