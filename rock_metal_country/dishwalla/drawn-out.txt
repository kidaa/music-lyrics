so the lines are lost
on the smallest details
of the life that we tossed
pushed out over the rail
and the wounds run deep 
through the one man so bad
he's fallen beneath
the touch of your hand

and its all drawn out
there's nothing inside
and nothing to hold 
nothing to find
its wearing' me out
this feeling inside
I'm all drawn out

and the promise we break it
and the reasons we fake it
bring us farther apart
from the love that we make
as the poisonous time 
leaves us gasping for air
we run for the past
but were already there

and its all drawn out
there's nothing inside
and nothing to hold 
nothing to find 
and its wearing me out
this feeling inside
and its all drawn out
its all drawn out
I'm all drawn out
