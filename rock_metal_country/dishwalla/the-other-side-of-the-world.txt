Down amid the grass and flowers
As this ballet floats for hours
It's a messy ride
In the countryside
On such a perfect day, yeah

We're moving fast on the other
The other side of the world

It's like a perfect day
Water flowing over from above
To the overflow
Stand and take a dive into the backslide
Flowing
Bodies sliding into the deep
Slide into the other side of the world

Getting high
Getting high
Summertime never felt so good

Gonna slide
On its concrete face

Gonna slide
Till I rip my shorts again

Gonna slide to get to
The other side of the world
