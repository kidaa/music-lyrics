I know how much you've paid
It just seems so insane, anyway and
I know we're not the same
I wish I was the best thing that you've ever had

Let me be your healing star
Let me take you far from there
And take you anywhere

I know it felt like home
The rats inside your bones, took you far away and
To miss it seems insane
To wish it was the best thing that you've ever had

I know I'd be happier
I know I'd be happier
Inside you
You know I'd be happier, inside

I'll take you anywhere
