Bouncing and pounding
My head the backboard
I need release to let it flow
And I was ready
Really ready
I was ready to explode

Oh wasted time
Oh wasted time
Wasted time, wasted time
Wasted time

All these revisions
All of them written
And Broadway needs a song to sing
Sentences broken
As they are spoken
Feel the ink spill so unclean

Oh wasted time
Oh wasted time
Wasted time, wasted time, wasted time
Wasted
