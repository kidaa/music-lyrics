Stay with me so far away
The world is beyond our reach
Brighten me with a thousand suns
Love me when I am wrong

Stay with me
Love me like a mistress sun
And I won't let you down
Broken by the moment now
As I surrender the crown

Lay with me so far away
The world is pure and in reach
Punish me a 1000 times
I'm the end of your leash

Stay with me
Lead me like a mistress should
And I won't let you down
Broken by the beauty and the love - as I
Surrender - give to the crown
Surrender - let me kneel down
Surrender - give to the crown
Surrender - let me strip down
Down - stripped down to the bone

Stay with me
Love me like a mistress sun
And I won't let you down
Taken by the moment now as I - as I surrender the crown
Give to the crown
