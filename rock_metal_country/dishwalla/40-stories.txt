This life is, harder, so much harder
You say that life has so much weight it wears you down
Higher, your so much higher
40 stories high is such a long way down

You can run - run into the middle
Or you can be still - lean into the ledge
Or you can fall hard as you feel it giving away

So much insane a deep black hole
The Sun will come and warm your soul
As fast as light the speed of sound
One life one love - down down down

Harder, its so much harder
You blame it on your friend you say she let you down
Angel, another angel
You blame it on the bitch you say she let you drown

You can run - run into the middle
Or you can fall hard - as you feel it breaking away

So much insane a deep black hole
The Sun will come and warm your soul
As fast as light the speed of sound
One life one love - never let them take it away

Higher, your so much higher
40 stories high is such a long way down
