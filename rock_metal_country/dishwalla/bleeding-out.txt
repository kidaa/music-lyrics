Do you know just what it's like to burn inside so often?
To see the life you give is not in vain and not forgotten
To feel it all.... i feel it burn in time
I give it all.... and still i feel denied

Now that i am bleeding out
I pray for something
Now that i am bleeding out
I fade to nothing
Now that i am bleeding out..... bleeding out

Is there no place safe, and nothing sacred for the living
I feel the life inside me stain the ground with love and yearning
To feel it all to feel it all
To feel it come alive
To give it all to give it all
So you won't be denied

Now that i am bleeding out
I pray for something
Now that i am bleeding out
I fade to nothing
Now that i am bleeding out

Be the change you wish to see, and all the world gives something

Now that i am bleeding out
I pray for something
Now that i am bleeding out
I fade to nothing
Now that i am bleeding out
Bleed...
