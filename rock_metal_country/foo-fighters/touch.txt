touch...light as a feather 
I will wait for you honestly 
I am yours - entirely... 
I remember last night's dream 
could it be the one of me? 

I've known the face inside the window 
and the voice forever in my heart... 
like an angel's arrow 

I remember last night's dream 
could it be the one of me? 
I've been waiting silently... 
would you risk it all... 
with me?
