Goddamn "these stars to your room"
This hazy afternoon
I'm breathing in the silence like I've never before
This feeling that i get
This one last cigarette
As i lay awaken and wait for you to come through the door
Oh maybe, maybe, maybe i can share it with you
I behave i behave i behave so i can share it with you

You are not alone dear loneliness
You forgot but i remember this
So stranger, stranger, stranger things have happened i know
I'm not alone dear loneliness
I forgot that i remember this
So stranger, stranger, stranger things have happened i know, oh ohh, oh ohhh

And i dream about somewhere, a smoke will fill the air
As i lay awaken and wait for you to walk out that door

I can change, i can change, i can change
But who you want me to be?
I'm the same, i'm the same, i'm the same, what do you want me to be?

You are not alone dear loneliness
You forgot but i remember this
So stranger, stranger, stranger things have happened i know oh ohh, oh ohh

I'm not alone dear loneliness
I forgot that i remember this
You're not alone dear loneliness
You forgot but i remember this
Oh stranger, stranger, stranger things have happened i know

I'm not alone dear loneliness
I forgot that i remember this
Oh stranger, stranger, stranger things have happened i know oh ohh, oh ohh, oh ohhh
