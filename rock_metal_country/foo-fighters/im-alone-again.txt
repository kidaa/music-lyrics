all the things I said I wanted turned out to be heaven haunted 
every time I dream I'm sharin 
all the things that I tried pairing too 

if the thought could ever barter 
time enough to make a pedal 
now I might help any other 
now that's it I'll simply ponder you. 
Its hard to recognize that's all 
true it wasn't that at all 

I'm alone again 
never thought I'd see the one I told you 
Head is along 
over now 

all the things I said I wanted 
turned out to be heaven haunted 
every time the dream I'm sharin 
all the things that I tried pairing too 
if the thought could ever barter 
time enough to make a pedal 
now I might help any other 
now that's it I'll simply ponder you. 
Its hard to recognize that's all 
true it wasn't that at all
