Tie up the transmission this one is not a test
Silent all these years but now I'm getting you off my chest
Reeling in the moment, I know it will never last
Tired of keepin quiet, riding with all the rest

Stuck in the middle no-ones making a move
I'm looking in and I've got nothing to lose

I will comeback, I will comeback
I will comeback, I will comeback
I will comeback, I will comeback
I will comeback, I will comeback for you
For you

Hide behind obsessions, I'm trying to keep in check
Ride you for the finish we're coming
Reeling in the moment I know it will never last
Rise up to the surface high but I'm sinking fast

Stuck in the middle no-ones making a move
I'm looking in and I've got nothing to lose

I will comeback, I will comeback
I will comeback, I will comeback
I will comeback, I will comeback
I will comeback, I will comeback for you

Stuck in the middle no-ones making a move
I'm looking in and I've got nothing to lose

I will comeback, I will comeback [x13]
I will comeback, I will comeback for you
