down in the park where the machmen meet 
the machine and play kill by numbers 
down in the park with a friend called five 
I was in a car crash or was it the war 
but I never been quite the same 
little white lies like I was there 

come to tom-tom's the place to eat 
like it was built in one day 
you can watch the humans trying to run 
oh look, there's a rape machine 
I'd go outside if it'd look the other way 
wouldn't believe the things they do 

down in the park 
where the chant is death, death, death 
til' sun cries morning 
down in the park with friends of mine 
we are not lovers, we are not romantics 
we are here to serve 
different face but the words never change
