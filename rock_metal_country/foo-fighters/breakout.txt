You make me dizzy running circles in my head
One of these days I'll chase you down
Well look who's going crazy now
We're face to face my friend,
Better get out
You know you make me break out
I don't want to look like that
You can see this on my face
It's all for you
The more and more I take
I break right through
Therapy still scares me
Putting me on my back again
I may be crazy, little frayed around the ends
One of these days I'll phase you out
Burn it in the blast off watching me crawl away
Try to get out
