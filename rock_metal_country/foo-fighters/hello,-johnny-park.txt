Come and I'll take you under 
This beautiful bruise's colours 
Everything fades in time, it's true. 

Wish that I had another 
Stabb at the undercover 
Was it a change in mind for you. 

It's impossible 
I can't let it out 
You'll never know 
Am I selling you out 
Sit and watch 
You're every mood, mood 

Your eyes still remind me of 
Angels that hover above 
Eyes that can change from blind to blue 

It's impossible 
I can't let it out 
You'll never know 
Am I sellin' you out 
Sit and watch 
You're every mood, mood, mood, mood 

Now that I've found my reward 
I'd throw it away long before 
I'd share a piece of mine with you. 

It's impossible 
I can't let it out 
You'll never know 
Am I sellin' you out 
Sit and watch 
You're every mood, mood, mood, mood
