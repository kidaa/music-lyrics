gas chamber, there's a light. 
stay at home, don't feel right. 
in my room, all the time, 
trapped inside this twisted mind. 

gas chamber, cannot breathe. 
time for lunch, cannot leave. 
in my room, all the time, 
trapped inside this fucking mind. 

no action no, no 
no action gas chamber 
oh, no 
no action
