we sat and watched a new day melt 'til dawn 
had my share of memories, now it's time to move on 
another lonely lesson never turned out wrong 
these things I've done without you - should have never been done 
call on me and I'll shout down... 

how do you do when I'm not around? 

I've never felt this wrong and now I know 
this love was burnin' thru me though it never did show 
let's spend 2 lives together kissing the stars below 
we're hot inside each other - never let you go 
call on me and I'll shout down... 

call on me and I'll shout down...
