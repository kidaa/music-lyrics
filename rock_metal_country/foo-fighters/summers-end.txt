Early morning without warning
Woke me with a scare
I had that dream again
That the sun won't set

Make me warm or take me home
Its so cold in here
Can't we meet somewhere
If we went up there
If we went up there
This winter

Meet me in the summertime
We can move the air
Sweet Virginia countryside
I will meet you there

Loving licks and cherry wine
Moonshine in your hair
Just keep stairing at the sun
Pray for summer's end.

Come on over break my storm
Oceans all ahead
Come inside by bed
Give me night out there

Every moment we have stolen
All we have to share

Noone wanted them
But you know I did
You know I did
This moment

Meet me in the summertime
We can move the air
Sweet Virginia countryside
I will meet you there

Loving licks and cherry wine
Moonshine in your hair
Just keep stairing at the sun
Pray for summer's end

Meet me in the summertime
We can move the air
Sweet Virginia countryside
I will meet you there

Loving licks and cherry wine
Moonshine in your hair
Just keep stairing at the sun
Pray for summer's end

Meet me in the summertime
Meet me in the summertime
Meet me in the summertime
We can move the air
Meet me in the summertime
I will meet you there
