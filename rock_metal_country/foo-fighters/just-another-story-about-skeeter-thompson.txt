so we were in Amsterdam 
and we were staying at this guy 
Toss's house 
good friend of ours 
uhh 
its kinda in the middle of the city 
we were just finished with our 
second European tour 
and everything was going pretty good 
Skeeter, he met this girl that lived 
next door to Toss's 
and within a couple of weeks he started 
living with her, you know? 
and I guess she had a lot of money or something 
cause she was constantly buying him clothes 
and getting him lots of stuff and loading him 
with money, you know? 
He was constantly going to the coffee shop 
always getting the best herb and the best 
hash, you know? 
he was in good shape 
she was really good looking, she was 
really cool 
I, I don't think he'd ever met her before 
but she had, you know, other boyfriends I suppose
so I'm sitting on the couch, you know, in 
Toss's apartment 
and I'm reading, you know, maximum rock and 
roll or flip side 
one of those punk things 
and I heard Skeeter come in 
and he came in and he had all these really 
nice clothes on 
she bought him all this stuff 
she like bought him cologne 
he was really really smelling good, you know 
he looked good too 
you know he came in and put his herb 
on the table and, whatever 
I'm just reading my little punk magazine 
not really paying attention 
and then he says, uh, he says hey Dave
and I look up 
and he's standing there with his dick 
in his hand 
and he's kinda got it like lifted up so 
he's looking at the head of his dick 
he kinda pointed it at me 
I didn't know what to think 
he said does that look like pus to you 
I said no I think its lint
