blew it all away 
blew it all away 
living green and gray 
blew it all away 

read to past the time 
sappy open line, turns to yours and mine 
read to past the time.. 

you and I in hells garden 
hells garden the way it used to work 
I'm in hells gard, hells gard, pay to watch em' burn 
I'm in hells gard, hells gard, wait another turn 
I'm in hells gard, hells gard, will be true the world 

blew it all away
