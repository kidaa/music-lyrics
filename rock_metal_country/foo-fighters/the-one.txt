Everyone makes one mistake 
One more time 
For old time's sake 
One more time 
Before the feeling fades 
One less born of memories 
One more bruise 
You gave to me 
One more test 
Just how much can I take 
You're not the one 
But you're the only one 
Who could make me 
Feel like this 
You're not the one 
But you're the only one 
Who could make me 
Feel like sh*t 

Somethin' never meant to be 
Everything you meant to me 
Wake me when 
This punishment is done 
Those who try and get away 
From the one who gets away 
Someone's always someone's one 

You're not the one 
But you're the only one 
Who could make me 
Feel like this 
You're not the one 
But you're the only one 
Who could make me 
Feel like sh*t 
You're not the one 
But you're the only one 
Who could make me 
Feel like this 
You're not the one 
But you're the only one 
Who could make me 
Feel like sh*t 

Until the end of time 
In another life 
Until the day I die 
Save it up for one more try 
Save it for the last good-bye 
We go on 
Get up 
Get on 
Get up 

You're not the one 
But you're the only one 
Who could make me 
Feel like this 
You're not the one 
But you're the only one 
Who could make me 
Feel like sh*t 
You're not the one 
But you're the only one 
Who could make me 
Feel like this 
You're not the one 
But you're the only one 
Who could make me 
Feel like sh*t 
You're not the one 
But you're the only one 
Who could make me 
Feel like this 
You're not the one 
But you're the only one 
Who could make me 
Feel like sh*t
