There is a place I'd love to go 
Strangers takin' me there 
I dream about the day I learn to fly 

I'm afraid of aeroplanes 
Even though I act the way 
that it feels to be a person in the sky 

It's alright 
and it's good 
this time 

I look out and on the ground 
really don't believe it 
gravity can pull me from this height 

One day we'll come crashing down 
What will I do 
Never had a chance to say goodbye 

Close my eyes and hope that it's 
a real smooth flight 
this time 
Close my eyes and hope that it's 
a real smooth flight 

And it's good 
this time 

I look down and on the ground 
I look down and on the ground 
I look down and on the ground 
I look out, we're going down
