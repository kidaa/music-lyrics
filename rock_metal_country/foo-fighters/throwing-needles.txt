what's there at the door that changed my life 
without a simple reason why 
feel another afternoon 
split my poor broken heart in two 
it's not a friend that you and I 
throwing needles at the sky 
march with friends that's you today 
put them on and walked away 

I walked away 
I walked away 
I walked away 

you laughed the while you kissed my head 
talk about the time we spent 
picking arms up from the sand 
sure to never never land 
in the middle of my story 
fuel the bed to keep you warm 
lie around and beat my head 
feed the cactus, I'm instead 

get lost instead 
get lost instead 
get lost instead 

the end.... 
the end.... 
the end!
