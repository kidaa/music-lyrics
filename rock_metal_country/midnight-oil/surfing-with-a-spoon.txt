Well you knew from the start
That a one way loving wouldn't last
You think I'm moving slowly girl
i tell you, you're moving way too fast
Working in the city from 9 to 5
Traffic on the highway gonna blow my mind
Surfing with a spoon all the rest of the time
Oh yeah, all the rest of time
You better find your way without me
'Cause I'm heading for the coast in june
Don't talk about me when I'm gone
You know I couldn't leave too soon
Working...
I'm back in town, you're still around
I guess I'll have to stay away
I'm going up north where the weather's fine
And I'm living it from day to day
Working...
