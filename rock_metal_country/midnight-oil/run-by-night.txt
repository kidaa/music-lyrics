I'm on the whiskey flying, and I'll run by night
I'm on the whiskey running, and I'll run by night
I'm on the winter cycle, shut my eyes to the bite
I'm on the winter cycle, shake my fist at the bite
I'm on the whiskey flying, and I'll run by night
I'm on the phone to summer, so I'll see you on the flight
My friends are at a party, playing games with the light
I hate to say I'm wrong, I just know I'm right
We all run by night
I'm on the whiskey flying, and I'll run by night
I'm on the glaze a burning, and it burns in the light
I'm on a turning circle, turn my face from the bite
I'm on a turning circle, hear me screaming at the bite
I'm on the edge of danger, and I'll run by night
I'm on the phone to summer, so I;ll see you on the flight
My friends are at a party, playing games with the light
I hate to say I'm wrong, I just know I'm right
We all run by night
