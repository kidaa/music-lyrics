Yeah, people of Australia, sing this song
See many faces from many places, yeah
We all live in one country
But we all come from many others you see
United we dearly hold
The principles of equality
And dignity
And sanctity
People of Australia
We live in a very, very old place
The aboriginal people have lived here for 40,000 50,000 60,000 years
They didn't sell it to anybody
They didn't give it away for toys
They didn't trade it in for houses up the coast
They had it stolen off of them, they had it nicked off them
People of Australia
People of Australia
Our continent is immense
It is unique in the world
But it needs our R.E.S.P.E.C.T.
Our devotionality
Our continent, our home it needs wise management
Some wise management
Your wise management
