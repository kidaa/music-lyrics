One things for sure that it's still the same
That young folk die from some noble aim
And they live so fast and they die so young
And we just keep wondering what the hell went wrong

For a wasted life for nothing gained
Cos they live so fast but they die so young
And we just keep wondering ... what goes on

We got everything to live for
Ain't nothing I want to die for no nothing at all
