My life is a valuable thing
I wan't to keep it that way, I won't cry
My life's such a valuable thing
Some things don't fade away, I don't mind
We give the best we can give
We won't forget, we can't forgive
Keep us radioactive free
Strike a bell in Hiroshima park
You know that we can't see in the dark
We try and we try and we try...
Who waits for the planes to come
When everybody's got you on the run
South Pacific carry on
It seems to me that what we're saying
Nobody really wants to talk about it
This is no time to be wondering why
I do the best I can do
The human jungle and the global zoo
I'll find my way it's a very special way
Why wait for the planes to come
When everybody's got us on the run
South Pacific carry on
Here come the hercules
Here come the submarines
Sinking south pacific dreams
