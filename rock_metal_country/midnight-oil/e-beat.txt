There is a place we're coming to
It is not green it is not blue
I hope that you understand
The devil was a dancing on the old foreshore
Hitting up on bright lights and the liquor stores
Save me, please save me
We got to prick that bubble in the shopping arcade
Gonna make amends for the things we've said
I do hope that you understand
Dirty washing on the line, footsteps in the sand
Whose gonna lead us on to some promised land
Save me
The devil was a dancing on the old foreshore
Hitting up on bright lights and the liquor stores
Yeah tell me, please save me
The land lives longer if we listen to the earth beat
Lives go forward if we listen to the hearts speak
Seasons won't falter, stars won't fade away
I know
Gonna find myself a place in the country
Wake up and reach out and breathe real air
Do you know how it feels clean tissue no scars
Dirty washing on the line, footsteps in the sand
Whose gonna lead us onto some kind of promised land
Save me 
Devil  was a dancing on the old foreshore
Hitting up on bright lights and the cut price the liquor stores
I say 
The land lives longer if we listen to our hearts speak
Lives go forward if we listen to the earth beat
Seasons won't falter, stars won't fade away
Fade away
They won't fade away
