I am gone, can't waste more time
I said, not quite joking
The fire has gone the big trees stand
The underground is smoking
Remember nothing you've been told
Means anything to me
And everything you hold is mine
In the barest degree
I walked up to the park
The lion rock was weeping
I walked on to the grave
The lizard king was sleeping
Remember nothing you've been told...
The day's draw long, too long to count
Cushioned by the wasting
Restless age, the rusted temple
A place of my own making
No matter what else you've been told
It's still all up to me
And everything you own, is mine
In the barest degree, in the barest degree
