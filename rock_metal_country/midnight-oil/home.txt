There is a place I was born
It is a place I've never seen
Don't even know where it is
Don't even know my name
Where is home, where is my home?
I'm searching far and wide
It's a bastard song
It is the feeling that everything's wrong
We are alive, we that have wings
We have devices can do anything, I say
Where is home, where is my home?
I hear my spirit cry
If you're out of transmission, way out on the road
If you're out of commission I can, give you the code
Darkness is coming and it's in your command
Time to be moving, time
There is a town I was born
Now there's a place I've got to call home
Where is home, where is my home?
I'm searching far and wide, oh yeah
Where is home, where is my home?
I hear my spirit cry
It's in the clear blue sky
