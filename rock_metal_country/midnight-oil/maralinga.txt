spoken
I come from a land of wide open spaces
Where the world turns around us and we just follow suit
There's heat in the air and peace reigns supreme
Got white flags on the clothes lines and the deals are new
In the wind, the ashes fly
The poison crown, the charcoal ground
And if you can't see the smile in me
That's where I want to be
There's only God, There's only Christ
Think I'll lie down, for just a while
So watch and check them out and listen as we learn
Throw the pearls before the swine, ebb and flow and turning tide
Yes we watch and catch them down no matter how they jump
The pigs will have to come to ground,we've got to make it happen now
It's not really that new, try and make it happen now
What are we to do, maybe there's a chance for you
All around, an eerie sound
Their dreams a cloud, their world in shrouds
In the wind, the ashes fly
Not much time, but time to try
And if you can't see the smile in me, that's where I want to be
I want to be here at the, I have to be here at the end
