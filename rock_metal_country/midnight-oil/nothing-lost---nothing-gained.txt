In my world there are sorrows
I'd rather drown in happiness
Come the morning, when the darkness through
That story's bound to change
And in my world
And in my world
It's all the same
And nothing's ventured, nothing's gained
And nothing's lost and nothing's changed
Go and jump aboard the train of freedom
It's a one way fare
You can find out now that when the tunnel's through
Your ticket's vanished, forgotten you
And in my world...
Turn up the TV, make the music loud
Better to ignore the rabid dog baying at your door
Draw the blind, change the channel if you dare
Better to say, I don't care
And in my world...
You hear the bell, you know it's time to jump off
Cause there's nothing at the platform's edge again
It's too late
It's over to you
