I was asleep with both eyes open
Dream freeze sprinklers in the sun
Beer soaked mansions block the sky,
Dingos howl and white flags fly
The future's put on hold and you're still young
But I know seeing is believing
I can't believe what I'm seeing
I was crying with both eyes open
But now all is quiet on dripfeed lottery night
Curse the dugong, free the jet ski,
Suckling babies at the eski
Invite the looters back the price is right.
