I was taken downtown for my part in the demonstration
I was used and abused with the light in my eye at the station
I said
No no	You got the wrong man
No no	Don't pick on me again
No no	I'm going home to my
Family and friends
I'm too busy making a living to make any money
And the living ain't easy and the money disappears in a hurry, now
I said
No no	I should,ve stayed at school
No no	They're treating me so cruel
No no	I'm breaking all the rules
Breaking all the rules
No no
I was talking to the man he said we're gonna make a deal
I was fooled into thinking the paper in my pocket was real
I said
No no	You've been taken again
No no	You're losing all your friends
No no	It's just a matter of sense
It's just a matter of sense
