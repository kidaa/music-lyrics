Tell all your friends I'm the cure
Tell them again and again
Watching the walls, spinning in doors
I can bring you peace of mind
Use me whenever you please
Sweeter than sweet memories
Everything's neat, avoiding the heat
I can give you peace of mind
All this pressure I can't handle
Everything else becomes dim
You're so much better than them
Waiting around for something to happen
Bring you this instant relief
Kilo pascals in my finger
God is hiding in this teacup
