Breaking me down - lunatic noises
Breaking me down - desperate voices
Breaking me down - phone is blistering
Breaking me down - death by listening
Somebody's out there, Somebody's waiting
Somebody's trying to tell me something
Somebody's trying to talk to me
Cracking me up - silence threatening
Cracking me up - storm is deafening
Cracking me up - pressure brought to bear
Cracking me up - now I'm getting there
