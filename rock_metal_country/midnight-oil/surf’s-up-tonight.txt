Wherever the wind blows
When it blows over the sea
The moon's sitting high
Waves will rise 
Water shapes
Waves will take you, take you there
Surf's up tonight 
Summers on hold
It will go running away
You've gotta move now
Get inside
Take that dive
Get inside today
Surf's up tonight
Now I was lonely 
And you were too
I met you down at the waterline
Now there's something we can do
Now there's something left to do
Oh yeah
Surf's up tonight
Wherever you are
When you're coming over land
There's a place where you can throw it away
There's a place you can forget
You get wet, it's free
You get high, you're alive
Surf's up tonight
Come on up tonight
Surf's up tonight
