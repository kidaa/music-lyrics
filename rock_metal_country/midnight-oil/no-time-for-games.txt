The raising of children, the rearing of young
Used to be simple but look what it's become
The choice of career, the proper vocation
Out of your hands, all for the needs of the nation
No inhibitions with the modern child
Wasted lessons or pleasure or pain
Easy to follow your natural instinct
Easy to follow, much too hard to learn
Useless expressions and sporting aggression
Don't waste my time, I can't wait for the end of the session
What opportunity, the modern child?
Waste passion and wasted mind
Some kids got no time for playtime
Some kids got no time for games
Some kids got no time for playtime
Some kids got no time for games
