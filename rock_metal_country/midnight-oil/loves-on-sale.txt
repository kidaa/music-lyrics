Haul me up I'm waiting
Oh yeah yes I'm waiting
Waiting now they say for shopping day
I'll pretend that I'm a rich man
And I'll carry it away
Oh yeah it sounds real nice
If you got money, then it's a steal
Give me a dollar, I'll give you a deal
Everybody says that love's on special and sale
And everything you've ever wanted you've got to pay for
It seems so easy and gettable, yes it's real
If you've got money, it's such a steal
Everybody says that love is the number one
But everytime you try to get some, you've gotta buy it
It's all so special, accessible, pretty and nice
It's oh so wonderful, at a price
You can rent a life today
Why worry about the real thing
Pay up now and plug in quick
It's easy to co-ordinate
Just credit card the right idea
Why wait around and contemplate
The hidden cost of what you've got
It's better not to
