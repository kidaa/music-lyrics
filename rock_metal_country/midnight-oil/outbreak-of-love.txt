The world is crashing down on me tonight
The walls are closing in on me tonight
Cos I know this is the end of the beginning of the outbreak of love
The stars come falling down on me tonight
Sharks are coming up to feed
I believe it's time to move
Diver's coming up to breathe
But I'm not in the mood
No I'm not in the mood
