I'm head over heels
You know how it feels to be in love
I'm head over heels
Holding back the chills in love
I think I like the sound we're chasing
I'm giving it all and you're reciprocating
I'm head over heels
Turning back the wheels of love
We're stealing the show
You're stealing my money and love
You're all the same you part-time lovers
When it starts to rain
You're hiding under the covers
It just don't add up
This summer fever
She turns the truth
And I don't believe her
Stories flying, love is dying
In the end I can't understand her lying
