Was it just a dream, were you so confused
Was it just a giant leap of logic
Was it the time of year, that makes a state of fear
Methods were the motives for the action
And did I hear you say
My country right or wrong
Did you save your face
Did you breach your faith
Women, there were children at the shelter
Now who can stop the hail
When human senses fail
There was never any warning, no escape
Did I hear you say
My country right or wrong
My country oh so strong
My country going wrong
My country right or wrong
I hear you say the truth must take a beating
The flag a camouflage for your deceiving
I know, yes I know
It's written on your soul
I know, we all make mistakes
This is not a case of blurred vision
It's a case of black holes, pocket holes, soul holes
And did I hear you say...
