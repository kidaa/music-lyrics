In the cities and the towns
The word is coming down
No more doubt, no more pain
There's been a dragging of the chain
Now there's a price we gotta pay
No way out, no way round
Where is the town that we lived in, brother?
Where is the sound of the church bells, sister?
Now is the time to heal
You keep running from the wheel
But there's nothing left to feel
Empty heart down and out
Now the writer's can't explain
Why we're playing up again
No way out, no way down
Where is the hope of a clean tomorrow?
Hope only offers when justice is coming
Now is the time to heal
Where is the ground, the beloved country?
Women and men who have fallen silent
Where are the words that can speak forgiveness?
Now is the time
Now is the time
Now is the time to heal
