It's 2am in Town Hall Station
Black walls and sleeping drunks
Are bad companions
Ice is there
Fear is there
Everyone is nowhere there's too much of nothing
Take me away
It' 9am in Town Hall Station
Flashing faces and grey herds no comparison
So sorry
So straight
Everyone is nowhere there's too much of nothing
Take me away
It's 2 am...
