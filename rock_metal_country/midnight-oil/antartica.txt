I'm a snow plough, I must now plow on, I'm a snow plough, I'm a settlers son
I'm a storm cloud, rain myself all over the place
I'm a storm cloud, gonna wipe that smile right off your face
There must be one place left in the world
Where the mountains meet the sea
There must be one place left in the world
Where the water's real and clean
I'm a landslide, I'm a downhill run, I'm a landslide, open season's just begun
There must be one place left in the world
Where the skin says it can breathe
There gotta be one place left in the world
It's a solitude of distance and relief
There gotta be one place left in the world
I'm a short fuse, I'm a slow blues
I'm a landslide humming, I'm a downhill running
There must be one place left in the world, where we can be
