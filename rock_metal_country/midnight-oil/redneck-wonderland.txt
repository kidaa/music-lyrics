I don't want to run I don't want to stay
Cos everything that's near and dear is old and in decay
Emergency has gone, apathy rolling on
Time to take a stand
Redneck wonderland
Got you in my sights, spotlit by the fence
If your small you're faking, it's just common sense
Brick and tile for miles, rolling in the aisles
Rifle in my hand
Redneck wonderland
Well the streets are clean, nothing gets away
I can see the beauty treatment draining from your face
It is vision free, it's poor bugger me
Something less than grand
Redneck wonderland
