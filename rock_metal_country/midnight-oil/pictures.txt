I just want to see that clear clear ight
Don't want to be a member of a species that's deceasing
Keep on making those promises that they aren't keeping
Oh I was a talking to the people next door
Said they don't want to die in a nuclear war
Now we went walking down the old north road
We got a common cause we got a heavy heavy load
Watching pictures of the world
Watching pictures as they pass me by
Don't stop at that light
Don't go out at night
My artificial heart
Expensive spare parts
I've been a sailor on the sea I've been a flyer in the air
I've seen a whole lot of bleeding hearts out there
They don't talk so much I tell you they still care
They can't go on living like this they can't go on
Don't sit around in silence you don't need a licence
It's moving in a hurrythere's no need to worry
We're really going to change it the critical mass approaches
I can almost hear it
