Hope you're a God, your turn to pray
Hope you've a God, it's your turn to pray
Light on the hill so far away
The light on the hill is so far away
Boy, where are you now
With skin so brown, get out of town
Star of Hope, star of Glory
Shine upon this half made man
To himself, he begs, steals or borrows
But you won't be seeing him again
Hope you've a God it's your turn to pray
Hope you've a God it's your turn to pray
Light on the hill is so far away
Sign on the hill says it's the judgment day
Howl, where are you now
Words fly around, get out of town
Star of Hope, star of Glory
Shine upon this half made man
Blinded by, a new tomorrow
You wont be seeing him again
Howl, where are you now
Where skin's so brown, get out of town
Star of Hope, star of Glory
Shining on this a frying pan
To yourself if there's some tomorrow
You wont be needing me again
Star of Hope, star of Glory
Shine upon me if you can
To myself, beg, steal and borrow
You wont be seeing me again
