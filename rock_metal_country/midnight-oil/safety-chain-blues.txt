Hanging on like hell to the safety chain
Lifebuoy crash lands in a vale of tears
All the lovers are in retreat
Out on the edge of the nervous street
So deaf to the call of the wild
Deaf to the first born's whispering plea
Expanding frame the city is in heat
Burning at the edges of the lonely street
But I want to hold your precious head
I will not leave you nor pretend
I'm going to hold you to the end
Hey mama didn't know we'd end up here
The snapshot is all tiles and red walls
Down at the squatter's camps they cannot compete
The shepherd has been bound up by his hands and his feet
Make love make peace make haste it's a slow release
Great changes gonna carry you
Make love make peace make haste it's a slow release
Great changes gonna carry you
