Rituals are carried out for reasons quite unknown
The fact remains you have no mind to call your own
Condoned by a bible I have written for myself
No duplicates, there's only one inside my shelf
The spell can't be broken
You all have been chosen
You're dying for me
Demoralized servant to my every need
A system of tyranny rages uncontrolled
One day soon you'll find it now controls your soul
Nothing's changed for many years, your dreams are run with rats
They won't hesitate to rip the shirt off your back
The spell can't be broken
You all have been chosen
You're dying for me
Demoralized servant to my every need
What will you do when your future unfolds?
Life as you've known it, you'll be much too old
Days of your youth were all spent in defense
Memories are painful, the thoughts you resent
I know I was meant for much better things
No time to sleep, so I've lost all my dreams
Look forward to nothing, look back at the same
I'll spend my life here and deal with the pain
The choice has been made, you all will be slaves
Unreasonable power
I mock at the suffering and grow strong by the hour
Hatred grows among the ones destined to be slaves
But only life itself can lead you to your grave
Lost in thoughts of what you're told to do for someone else
I don't think you're superior, you're making my life hell
The spell can't be broken
You all have been chosen
You're dying for me
Demoralized servant to my every need
