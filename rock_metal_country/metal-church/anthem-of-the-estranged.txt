K. Vanderhoof
Starved for destination, a beggar man by trade
A desperate man needs more than someone else to blame
Friendless he appears, he hides behind his tears
For things he's lost, or things he'll never have at all
The forgotten man wanders misplaced in the world
Obscurity is all the eye can see, and I recall
All alone again
As we pass on by and continue with our day
Can we appraise the quality of life some other way?
All alone again
When you take a longer look at someone on the run
You may see reflections of yourself becoming one
Take an extra moment when you find yourself at peace
To think about your values and your own affluency
Everything you've worked for and everything you've done
May be thrown by the wayside, and you're not the only one
Everything around you may seen worn and overused
But imagine yourself removed from all that you're used to
All alone again
Once an influential man, once was in his prime
He spends his days repeating lines like "can you spare a dime?"
Shunned by those loved you and by those who were your friends
Can you adjust to a different life of living on the edge?
The destitute find meaning in a different way of life
The doorways that they dwell in are shelter in the night
No shining crystal possessions set out for his display
His purpose is to find the food to get him throught the day
All alone again
Roaming aimless through the streets of supply and demand
Once a gypsy disconnected, no more, no future plans
Self discarded king of ruin, worthless to the world
Fight to keep his sanity, his voice is never heard
You may think it thoughtless and his mind is on a string ?
He always seems to find a reason to get him through the day
All alone again
He staggers down the alley to drink his spirits by himself
As he prays to God that he wakes up somewhere else
