No one's born with hatred, it's something that you learn
How do you think the good Lord feels, 
about the crosses you burn
What makes you hate the difference 
of someone's skin or race?
You must think you have more rights 
to be living in this place
I don't know what you feel, or have you lost your mind?
Afraid to take a look at yourself, 
afraid of the things you will find
You're no friend of mine
The Dark Ages are over, in case you haven't heard
While you're lost in ignorance, you killed a mockingbird
Hide behind your bedclothes, meet in some secret place
One day soon this hate you've brewed 
will blow up in your face
I don't know what you feel, or have you lost your mind?
Afraid to take a look at yourself, 
afraid of the things you will find
You're no friend of mine
Black and white and yellow, living side by side
The children always play together, 
we taught them otherwise
All men created equal, all have human rights
So tell me why we hate each other, 
no winners in the fight
I don't know what you feel, or have you lost your mind?
Afraid to take a look at yourself, 
afraid of the things you will find
You're no friend of mine
