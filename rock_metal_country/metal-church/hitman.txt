D. Wayne / K. Vanderhoof
Your woman's unfaithful, she's got a backdoor man
You've seen the signs and you understand
They'll soon be dead, now, I know just what to do
I got the guns, ha-ha, I got the tools
Inaudible
In the name of all, I'm just a hitman
I'll get the job done
No one will ever know it was you, it was you
They got their men promoted before it's time
You break a sweat and your balls before the moments time
Don't get excited, I got a plan
We'll take him down now, he'll be one dead man
Inaudible
In the name of all, I'm just a hitman
I'll get the job done
No one will ever know it was you, it was you
Just don't pay me, then you will see
What a dead man really can
You're at the cemetary feeling all alone
Just like a dog who can smell the bone
You start to cry or make one little sound
You'll be the next one, I'll put you in the ground
Inaudible
In the name of all, I'm just a hitman
I'll get the job done
No one will ever know it was you, it was you
