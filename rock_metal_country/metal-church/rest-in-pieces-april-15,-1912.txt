Integrity of construction
The best money can buy
Her size is greater than any
A Belfast shipyard's pride
Signal flags spelled out the word "Success"
On her maneuvering trials
Preservers and lifeboats were not in excess
Unsinkable, no plans to save lives
Athinai reports icebergs and field ice
At seven bells ahead just five miles
A black hulk against the night's darkness
Disaster along starboard side
Full speed astern were the orders
It would do them no good
No apparent collision
A rip deep below the waterline
Come at once, we have struck a berg
Interference in transmission
The newest, largest ship afloat
Had two hours to live
Lower all lifeboats, we have too few!
Women and children first!
Distress rockets fill the air
Abandom Ship!"
Sinking faster, every light ablaze
Machinery, engines, crashing to the bow
Arching vertical, stern points to the sky
The great ship fractured
Everyone must die
Watching their families make it to safety
Fifteen hundred went down
The orchestra played to the last moment
An eerie almost unreal sound
The calm and ice North Atlantic
Titanic's burial ground
