Rip it up, kick it out.
Blood begins to flow.
Taking chances,
The only way I know.
Sacrificed everything.
I'm the grinding stone.
Ripping flesh, drawing blood.
I'de love to eat your bones.
My world will not cave in.
I will dare so I will win.
Hear the timebombs begin to tick.
I'll hit you like a ton of bricks.
Hammer or anvil,
You must pay the price.
Thunder, lightning,
Yes, it does strike twice.
Vice grips hold me,
Keep me in control.
And if you think I'm kidding you,
You will feel the fatal blow.
My world will not cave in.
I will dare so I will win.
Hear the timebombs begin to tick.
I'll hit you like a ton of bricks, ton of bricks.
Oh yeah, you!
I know that it's true
Do you have a clue
To what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna
Rip it up, kick it out
Blood begins to flow
Taking chances
The only way I know
Sacrificed everything
I'm the grinding stone
Ripping flesh and drawing blood
I;de love to eat your bones
My world will not cave in
I will dare so I will win
Hear the timebombs begin to tick
I'll hit you like a ton of bricks
Ton of bricks, ton of bricks
Oh yeah, you!
I know that it's true
Do you have a clue
To what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna stop.
