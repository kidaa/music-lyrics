You won't find me, in my bed right off the bat
'Cause I've been working, all night long for centuries
Bloody Mary, the drink of choice for those who dabble
In the nightlife, a well dressed beast with savoir-faire
Great God Almighty, I get the craving whenever you're near
You are just the right type, a little bit closer my dear
When you start to realize, it's too late, you're hypnotized
I'm in the shadows, don't cross my path or stake my claim,
'Cause you'll fall victim, and you will not be seen again
Holy water, no thirst can make me drink it
My cup runs over, the crimson liquid that I need
Great God Almighty, I get the craving whenever you're near
You are just the right type, a little bit closer my dear
When you start to realize, it's too late, you're hypnotized
Prince of Darkness, just the thought of daylight sends me
Into hiding, waiting for the night to come
Great God Almighty, I get the craving whenever you're near
You are just the right type, a little bit closer my dear
When you start to realize, it's too late, you're hypnotized
When you start to realize, it's too late, you're hypnotized
You're hypnotized
