I'm trapped in the pressure cooker
when will I ever learn
While my world has reached the boiling
Point of of no return
Don't light a match near me
I'm bound to explode
Don't pull this shit with me
I want what I'm owed
I've seen the facts and the figures you hide
You time is coming, you're caught in a lie
Too many potions in my cabinet
Too lives left on the line
If you are one of those who made me end up crazy
You will get yours all in due time
One more hour of induced psychosis
I'll be a real nut case
That's what I get for listening to you
You put me in this place
Don't light a match near me
I'm bound to explode
Don't pull this shit with me
I want what I'm owed
My reservations have left me to die
You're two-faced and scheming, I spit in your eye
Too many potions in my cabinet
Too lives left on the line
If you are one of those who made me end up crazy
You will get yours all in due time
I'm in a no-win situation, with no timeouts left
Time for heavy ammunition, time for action, no regrets
Too many potions in my cabinet
Too lives left on the line
If you are one of those who made me end up crazy
You will get yours all in due time
