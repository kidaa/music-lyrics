No matter what you say,
You're gotta make it through the day.
You know you will, you know you will.
Just call the doctor on the phone,
Tell 'em you can't make it all alone.
Gotta get your fix.
So climb aboard your scarlet ship,
Stars are brightly dancing in your eyes.
Keep chasing all your dreams,
You know they're just a pack of lies.
The sands of time are running out.
You know this god ain't got a doubt
He's gonna get your soul.
Gonna get your soul.
Driving hard and living fast,
You know your life ain't worth a line of blast
Laid on the mirror.
So climb aboard your scarlet ship,
Stars are brightly dancing in your eyes.
Keep chasing all your dreams,
You know they're just a pack of lies.
Push the needle in your vein.
Ya laugh and shout that you're insane
You wanna die, you're gonna try.
Racing down the open road,
On your mind's heavy load of pain.
What will you gain?
So climb aboard your scarlet ship,
Stars are brightly dancing in your eyes.
Keep chasing all your dreams,
You know they're just a pack of lies.
Just a pack of lies.
Try, try, try, you're gonna try.
Lie, lie, lie, you know they're lies!
Die, die, die, you're gonna die!
