I've got nowhere to go
I've got some rocks to throw today
A child so lost in time
A kid whose mind's been blown away
He's heard all he can hear
And seen more than he wants to see
This town's all dead end streets
Signs saying what young men should be
He will take it down to the river
Face down on the ground
The day is pounding on your head
Lonely in a crowd
'Cause she's in someone else's bed
These halls are paved with gold
A combination lock on every door
The things he's learned today
Are stuck in books thrown on the floor
He will take it down to the river
Another daily grind
At sixteen you ain't got time to waste
Make some future plans
A blueprint of someone else's fate
Be yourself they say
As long as you do it like we say
What's wrong with kids today
They need a place to get away
They just take it down
Take it away
Take it all away
Down to the river
