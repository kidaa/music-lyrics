Just the pain has worn me down
Don't play me far ahead
Living quiet, fighting for some time
Your gonna see one day
Your not listening now
You haven't heard a word I said
Your laughter burns hot
An existing pawn
Your lies are open now
Nothin' left to hide
Now, I'm telling you
Leave all your troubles far away
I've listened now to this dead-end shit
It all just sounds the same
Your laughter burns hot
An existing pawn
Your lies are open now
Nothin' left to hide
You're a big boy now
Get up off the floor
You what?!
Do you want to know
Coming to get you
Yes, everybody wants a piece of your ass
It's time you know the pain
Your time is running out
We're gonna meet on judgement day
Your laughter burns hot
An existing pawn
Your lies are open now
Nothin' left to hide
Hide, hide, hide, ahh,
Your in the blood
