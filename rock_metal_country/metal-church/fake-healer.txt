K. Vanderhoof
I prey upon your morbid fear
Of terminal disease
You won't know the difference
Now it's time for surgery
Another shot, another pill
Two weeks therapy
I take all major credit cards
Your money is what I need
I'm a healer
I will keep you all alive
I'm a healer
A villain at your bedside
Take this and you'll be fine
Severely educated
Just pay your bill on time
I think it's time for another test
I need more of your blood
Sign this affidavit
So my insurance won't go up
I'm a healer
I will keep you all alive
I'm a healer
Research and development
Spend millions every year
You sickly and decrepit ones
Keep my yacht safe on the pier
You're dying on a stretcher
We'll try to save your life
If you can't afford my service
I will let you die
I'm trusted and respected
Says my diploma on the wall
Before I will do anything
I'll give your bank a call
I'm a healer
I will keep you all alive
I'm a healer
