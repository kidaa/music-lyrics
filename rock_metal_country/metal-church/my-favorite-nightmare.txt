D. Wayne / K. Vanderhoof / C. Wells
Better flood that restless soul of ecstacy and fright
In a path, splattered gore all through the night
Wakin' up at midnight, my bodies soaked in sweat
All my friends are down the stairs, watching the TV set
Hearing now a scratching noise outside my window pane
Wondering if it's real or am I going insane
Running fast to lock the doors, a banshee now awaits
Seconds count, I warn my friends, or is it now too late?
A friend of mine is the first one out to check
inaudible
Ripping flesh, something fly, we hear them slowly die
Then the cry of the banshee..., we run for our life
Scream! Scream for your life!
Scream! Scream for your life!
Ahh! No!
