Extended hand a friendly man who doesn't trust a soul
I wonder why that meeting eyes could put your life on hold
Do people feel humanity is something of the past?
A kind hello, a favor done, these days could be your last
Bar your windows, lock your doors, choose your colors
And stay down on the floor
Amidst a subtle war that's right outside your door
Amidst a subtle war
You can't go there at night 
unless you're feeling immortal
'Cause all of them have guns and knives, 
at least that's what we're told
A neighborhood or DMZ, but people call it home
Scared to death of living there, but got nowhere to go
Bar your windows, lock your doors, choose your colors
And stay down on the floor
Amidst a subtle war that's right outside your door
Amidst a subtle war
Pick your weapon
Talk to no one
Paranoia
Can we take this anymore
Amidst a subtle war that's right outside your door
Amidst a subtle war
