K. Vanderhoof / M. Howe
I hold the key to the world's security
Any price they'll pay to me, pay to me
I see the signs, and I heed the call, no one will know me, no one at all
Freedom is calling, the money's green, and to no country will I pledge my loyalty
I pass for someone who no one knows, I am the wolf who hides in political sheep's clothes
A peaceful world in jeopardy, it doesn't really matter all that much to me
If the people knew all that I know about their leaders and the ones who run the show
More cover-ups, legal deceit, there is no one in power who can destroy me!
I hold the key to the world's security
Any price they'll pay to me, pay to me
Change my face somewhere, lose myself out there
Change the way I speak, my past I will delete
I'll never know just how I made it out alive
But when I look into the future I look through a different eye
It doesn't really matter what they need to know
'Cause I can blow the lid off any scandal that they want to be exposed
I hold the key to the world's security
Any price they'll pay to me, pay to me
I'll change my name, a different look, another page in my life's book
It makes no difference just who I am, I'll take the money from Mother Russia or Uncle Sam
I'm filled with secrets of a nation, here at your disposal to benefit my greed
I take my liberties whereever I can find them, I am protected by the crime that lies behind
