K. Vanderhoof / M. Howe
I've been waking up shaking, and the bottles are gone
What will I do with my day, and how will I get along
I need a replacement for the habit I have
I just need to get something, I can't live in the past
The craving grows stronger the longer I'm away
The pain cuts deeper each bottle I betray
What looks like it's harmless, is rotten inside
What you don't know might not hurt you until after you die
I've always thought when you grow up somehow you get wise
But I've been living in a nightware behind a party disguise
The craving grows stronger the longer I'm away
The pain cuts deeper each bottle I betray
Just take a drink and you will find yourself back where you started
Temptation is the hardest thing, just push it all away
Once you take the first step, there'll be no more turning back
Just take a look at how far you progressed to be sober
Lose faith in yourself, off the wagon you will fall
Staying clean and sober is the only way to go
What looks like it's harmless, is rotten inside
What you don't know might not hurt you until after you die
I've always thought when you grow up somehow you get wise
But I've been living in a nightware behind a party disguise
The craving grows stronger the longer I'm away
The pain cuts deeper each bottle I betray
