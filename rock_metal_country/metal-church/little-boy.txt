Mama, I'm crying, did the silver angel warn the earth
From a blue sky falling?
Father, I'm frightened, what will happen if it falls again?
Will you be there to shelter me?
The little dot that falls, a little boy, that's all
That's all
Morning comes, I walk to school, 
but something's in the air
Things have changed, there's war at hand, 
but I'm too young to care
My home is a paradise, a jewel in the east
My family, they have seen the battles, 
they're praying for relief
Soon to be over, my father he said, victory is ours son
We will mourn all of our dead
I wonder what happens when a world is at war
In order to win, does someone else keep the score?
I think of my future on this beautiful day
How could I have known that the end's on its way?
The sky is quiet
Just one single plane
To bring destruction
Has mankind gone insane?
What happened to the land?
Metal fused with stone
Nothing remains, nothing lives
Burned through the bone
The sun touched the earth somehow, life melts away
One city barren wasteland, a split-second blaze
The heat turned the men to shadows, the sand into glass
A master stroke of evil in a blinding flash
The sea of dead and dying increases by the day
For years to come we pay the price of science gone astray
