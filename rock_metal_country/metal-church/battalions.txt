K. Vanderhoof / C. Wells
Deep slumber awakened by sirens
I realize life's been thrown to the lions
What I saw last night, our city's gone mad
And to my horror, the bloody town square
The time is now, we must avenge
We form tonight, we kill tonight
We must rest to regain our strength
We form tonight, we kill tonight
Tell all your something surrounding the back
In the night we'll attack with no questions of mercy
We'll take all they have and we'll drive them before us
Hear lamentations of women who cry for the loved ones we crush to oblivion??
Gather all survivors, the forces retreat
They never see the troopers in the streets
Surprise attack with no destination
What will we do with a steam-something nation
Death to come for what they've done
Snap their backs, their necks will crack
Stronger than ever, our guns held high
Snap their backs, their necks will crack
Tell all your something surrounding the back
In the night we'll attack with no questions of mercy
We'll take all they have and we'll drive them before us
Hear lamentations of women who cry for the loved ones we crush to oblivion??
The people have organized an army of vengeance
Struck out now, the bodies just like remnants
Don't you love living like a shark?????
We each have power, the battle has been won
The time is now, we must avenge
We form tonight, We kill tonight
We must rest to regain our strength
We form tonight, we kill tonight
Tell all your ... surrounding the back
In the night we'll attack with no questions of mercy
We'll take all they have and we'll drive them before us
Hear lamentations of women who cry for the loved ones we crush to oblivion?
