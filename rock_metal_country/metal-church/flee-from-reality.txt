C. Wells / J. Marshall / M. Howe
I've got no time for decisions
All I can do is complain
They threaten with institutions
I think they're all insane
Ruthlessly holding on
The person they want you to be
I took the easy way out
Flee from reality
I'm in a state of confusion
I don't know how to get back
Don't give a damn about the future
I can't remember the past
What the hell is going on?
Self-induced insanity
I took the easy way out
Flee from reality
Flee from reality
Flee from reality
Flee from reality
Flee from reality
How will I get there?
To where I find my destiny
I need an easy existence
Flee from reality
I hear the call of temptation
My willpower is young
Delivering my resignation
Responsible citizen
Ruthlessly holding on
The person you were meant to be
Confronted by reason within
Flee from reality
Flee from reality
