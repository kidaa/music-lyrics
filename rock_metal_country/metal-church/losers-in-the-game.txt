The endless years and hardluck tales, 
and some that have just moved on,
I guess it could be envy 
when I wonder what's gone wrong
Fingers point at all the problems, 
but that won't change my mind
I must have been held back 
in hardknox school a few more times
A few more years, a few more tears, 
are we the losers in the game?
When time is done and kingdom come, 
we'll not be losers in the game!
No one ever said it's easy to watch the world go by
Console myself by trying and trying, 
and trying just one more time
Put on a smile and fake your way in through another door
But only if you have more luck than a thousand times before
A few more years, a few more tears, 
are we the losers in the game?
When time is done and kingdom come, 
we'll not be losers in the game!
Try again, change direction, spend more money, 
new horizons, what's it gonna be?
Take your hits, I hate my job, live like who, 
think like what, no thanks I'll just stay me
A few more years, a few more tears, 
are we the losers in the game?
When time is done and kingdom come, 
we'll not be losers in the game!
