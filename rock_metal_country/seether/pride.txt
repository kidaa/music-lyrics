Pride

Take it. Break it. Rape it. Forsake it. 
In time you will 
Find it. Maim it. Thrill it and shame it 
In time you will 
Steal my pride 
Leave me blind 
Steal my pride 

Take it. Break it. Rape it. Forsake it. 
Take it. Break it. Rape it. Forsake it. 
In time you will 
Find me. Maim me. Thrill me and shame me. 
In time you will 

Steal my pride 
Leave me blind 
Steal my pride 
And leave me blind, blind, blind now. 
Leave me blind, blind, blind now. 

I am silence sent to find you 
I am violence sent to find you 
I am silence sent to find you 
I am violence sent to fuck you up 

Take me and break me. Rape me. Forsake me. 
In time you will 
Find me and maim me and thrill me and shame me 
In time you will 
Hate me. Hate me. Hate me. Hate me. 
Well now kill me. Kill me. Kill me. Kill me. 

Steal my pride 
Leave me blind 
Steal my pride 
And leave me blind, blind, blind now. 
Leave me blind, blind, blind now.
