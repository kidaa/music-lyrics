Have you ever wanted to die when you were without your friends? 
Haven't you said goodbye to the one on who your life depends? 
Could it be that I don't wanna save you anymore?
Could it be that we don't have what it takes?
Yeah

Have you ever wished for fire to burn away your mind restraints? 
Haven't you been for hire or suffered those cheap complaints? 
Could it be that I don't wanna save you anymore? 
Could it be that we don't have what it takes? 
Take it away 'cause I don't like this anymore
Take it away and throw it away
