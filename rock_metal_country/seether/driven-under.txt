Driven Under

Do you think I'm faking 
when I'm lying next to you? 
Do you think that I am blind 
nothing left for me to lose? 
Must be something on your mind 
something lost and left behind 
Do you know I'm faking now? 

Do you know I'm faking 
when I'm lying next to you? 
Do you know that I am blind to everything you ever do?
Must be something on your mind 
something lost for me to find 
Do you know I'm faking? 

Then she told me she had a gun 
it sounded like she'd used it once before on him 
Then she told me she had a gun 
it sounded like she'd used it once before, oh man 

I guess you know I'm faking 
when I tell you I love you 
I guess you know that I am blind 
to everything you say and do 
Must be something on my mind 
there's nothing left for me to hide 
Do you know I'm faking? 

Then she told me she had a gun 
it sounded like she'd used it once before on him 
Then she told me she had a gun 
it sounded like she'd used it once before, oh man 

We have to succumb to the feelings we can never face 
I need you. I breathe you. 
I can't go through this all again. 
We have to succumb to 
the feelings we can never face I need you. 
I breathe you. I can't go through this 

Then she told me she had a gun 
it sounded like she'd used it once before 

Then she told me she had a gun 
it sounded like she'd used it once before on him 
Then she told me she had a gun 
it sounded like she'd used it once before, oh man 
Then she told me she had a gun 
she says she wants to use it on me now
