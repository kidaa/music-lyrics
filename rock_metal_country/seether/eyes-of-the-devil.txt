It irks me when i get burned
And i realize, i don't get hurt
And always, it seems I've lost my way
When i feel you, it's not enough
And i need you to shun my touch
I notice the season's ripe for change

I'm weak
I'm weak

So with every new lesson learned
I could keep you before it turns
And the knowledge that things won't be the same
Now i realize that you have won
And there's nothing to be said or done
And i notice the wind won't blow my way

So run with the eyes of the devil
And keep them in your dreams
If you succumb to the lies of the rebel
You'll cleanse yourself of me

It kills me to watch this fade
And i realize it's all charade
And every mistake i make is the same
I beseech you to let me drown
Will it please you to let me down
And no one can save me from the pain

So run with the eyes of the devil
And keep them in your dreams
If you succumb to the lies of the rebel
You'll cleanse yourself of me [x3]

Jesus, save me! I'm weak [x5]
Jesus, save me from me
