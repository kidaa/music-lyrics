Go unnoticed
Let the freedom wash away
Losing focus
The pretense is second nature
It's a broken life that i cling to
Trying to make right

I feel dismay just like you do
I feel decayed

So find me a way to leave this wasted life
Behind me this wasted life
Find me a way to leave this wasted life
Behind me after all

Yes i see you 
Surrounded by the hopeless
When they need you
You're much too good and bloated
By the hopeless life that you cling to
Try to make right

I feel disdain just like you do
I feel decayed

So find me a way to leave this wasted life
Behind me this wasted life
Find me a way to leave this wasted life
Behind me after all

Go away 
Go away

And just leave me here
Just leave me here
Just leave me here

So find me a way to leave this wasted life
Behind me this wasted life
Find me a way to leave this wasted life
Behind me after all

This wasted life [x4]
