So I said this once before
I'm never gonna give you in
No, not again
Cause I've wasted all I've known,
to watch it fade and slip away now
from my hands
And what I have I have in mind
And I think about you all the time

[Chorus:]
I'm feeling miles away
You think I've got it made
I don't belong here
I'm feeling like a candle burning at both ends
I don't belong here

Now I hide myself away
I never wanna feel again
Cause I faced this all alone
I let it seep and wash away now
It's all the same
And what I have I have in mind
And I think about you all the time

[Chorus]

Never run away, son
Never run away, son
Never run away, son

Cause what I have I have in mind
And I think about you all the time

[Chorus]
