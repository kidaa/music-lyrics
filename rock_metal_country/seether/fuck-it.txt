Fuck It

I guess I like it when we play 
The way you drag me down
I guess I like it when you hate me 
The way you drag me down
'Cause I can't face myself in a mirror 
I'm left alone with all my pain 
And I disgrace myself in the mirror
I'm left alone with my shame 

Fuck it! I see you in me
Fuck it! I feel you in me
Fuck it! I'll heal you in me
Fuck it! I see you in me
Fuck it! I feel you in me
Fuck it! I'll heal you in me

I guess I like it when we fight 
The way you drag me down
I guess I like it when you smite me 
The way you drag me down
'Cause I can't face myself in a mirror 
I'm left alone with all my pain 
And I disgrace myself in the mirror 
I'm left alone with my shame

Fuck it! I see you in me
Fuck it! I feel you in me
Fuck it! I'll heal you in me
Fuck it! I see you in me
Fuck it! I feel you in me
Fuck it! I'll heal you in me

You're out of luck - can't get a piece of me
It's all blown up. Don't even fuck with me.
I cannot please you all forever
I cannot please you at all
I can feel you coming up behind me

Fuck it! I see you in me
Fuck it! I feel you in me
Fuck it! I'll heal you in me
Fuck it! I see you in me
Fuck it! I feel you in me
Fuck it! I'll heal you in me
