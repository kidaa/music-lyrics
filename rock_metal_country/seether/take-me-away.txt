As beautiful as fire against the evening sky
you fuel the lost desire- I no longer wanna die
Take me by the hand and see beyond the lies
Strip away the fences - leave me needing, leave me high
I know you're so solo, but I can't. 

[Chorus:]
Take me away - cause I dont wanna lose control
Take me away- cause I don't wanna lose it all

Relieved of all the pain you let me see again
Delievered from my shame now and I am lost for what to say
Cleansed and pure and weak, I suffer when I dream.
I need to find a purpose- I need to feel you needing me. 
I know you're so solo, but I can't.

[Chorus]

Pure and weak, I suffer when I dream
Cleansed of me, I suffer when I dream
Because I want you to stay, you take away the pain
I want you to stay, I need you here to keep me sane

[Chorus]

I want you to stay- you take away the pain
I want you to stay- I need you here to keep me sane
