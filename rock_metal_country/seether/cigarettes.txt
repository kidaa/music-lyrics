They suck you in like cigarettes
While hanging you out to dry, yeah
Making you feel like a hyprocrite
because you cannot lie, yeah

You are the reason we will never be set free
We wanna be like you- we wanna be so cool
Just like you

They're hanging you out with their whiskey breath
While leaving you out in the sun, yeah
Making you feel like a hyprocrite because you cannot run, yeah
