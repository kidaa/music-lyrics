Before you hedge those bets you placed against me
Be reticent of fortunes they foretell
Your verbal defecation i can't wash away despite myself
Your vanity, it seems, has served you well

You're so quick to choose the path walked by the righteous
So you can go and nest among the weak
The innocent observers will refuse to find the lie within
Renew the disappointment of the meek

You're no Jesus Christ!
You're no Jesus Christ!

Put the gun in my mouth and pull the trigger
I feel so alive here
Put the gun in my mouth that tastes so bitter
I feel so alive here
You're no Jesus Christ!
You're no Jesus Christ!

You keep takin' over
I keep rollin' over
I can't take it anymore [x2]

Before you hedge those bets you placed against me
Be reticent of fortunes they foretell
Your verbal defecation i can't wash away despite myself
Your vanity, it seems, has served you well

You keep takin' over
I keep rollin' over
I can't take it anymore [x4]
