Out of my way
Out of my, way

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't pass up this opportunity to make myself absurd,
I can't pass up this opportunity to let myself be heard.
Would you, like to, be the one who sees me lose this all,
Would you, like to, be the one who sees me fall.

[Chorus]
Nobody's gonna stand in my way
Give it up son, I'm doin' this my way
Nobody's gonna stand in my way
Give it up son, I'm doin' this my way

You like to think the worst is over now, but you cant breathe at all
You like to think you're owed a favor now, man you've seen it all

Did you, want to, be the one who pushed me off the wall,
Did you, want to, be the one who let me fall.

[Chorus]

You can't hold me down..
You can't hold me down..
You can't hold me down..
You can't hold me down..

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Nobody's gonna stand in my way
Give it up, I'm doin' this my way
Nobody's gonna stand in my way
Give it up, I'm doin' this my way
Out of my way
