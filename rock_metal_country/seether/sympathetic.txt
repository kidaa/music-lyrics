Sympathetic

And my words will be here when I'm gone 
As I'm fading away against the wind 
And the words you left me linger on 
As I'm failing again now, never to change this 

And I'm sympathetic, 
never letting on I feel the way I do 
As I'm falling apart again at the seam 

And it seems I'm alone here, hollow again 
As I'm flailing again against the wind 
And the scars I am left with swallow again 
As I'm failing again now, never to change this 

And I'm sympathetic, 
never letting on I feel the way I do 
As I'm falling apart again at the seam 
And I'm sympathetic, 
never letting on I feel the way I do 
As I'm falling apart again at the seam 

The same old feelings are taking over 
and I can't seem to make them go away 
And I can't take all the pressure sober, 
but I can't seem to make it go away 
The same old feelings are taking over 
and I can't seem to make them go away 
And I can't take all the pressure sober 
I can't make it go away. I can't make it go away 

And I'm sympathetic, 
never letting on I feel the way I do 
As I'm falling apart again at the seam 
And I'm sympathetic, 
never letting on I feel the way I do 
As I'm falling apart again at the seam 
And I'm falling, falling, falling, 
falling, falling, falling, falling 
Apart again at the seam.
