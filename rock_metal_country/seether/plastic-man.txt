I am a plastic man, wish I can be the one you could be proud of.
I'm losin heart again, wish I could show you what you think I'm made of.
Someday I know I'll find my place, someday I know this pain will fade.

I am a perfect sell, just wrap me up with a bow and flowers.
I will neglect to tell, I'll sell your story that we love each other. 
Someday I know I'll find my place, someday I know this pain will fade.
Someday I know I'll find my place, someday I'll sing my last refrain.

Why don't let me be, and I'll pretend I'm well.
Cuz you're blind to see, and I'm too tired to tell.
And in your apathy, your head begins to swell.
Another tradegy, but you're too cold to feel.

Someday I know I'll find my place, someday I know this pain will fade.
Someday I know I'll find my place, someday I'll sing my last refrain
