69 Tea

Lonely in this white room, there are pads everywhere 
Chafing straitjacket, I won't die in there 
Save me smiling Jesus, get off that cross 
Hate me screaming masses 
I don't care if I'm lost 
Don't tell me that you're all better 
I don't care if you are Don't tell me that you're trendsetters 
I don't care if you are 

Lowly with my head bowed, there are rats everywhere 
Feed me bread and water 
I won't die in there 
Save me smiling Jesus, get off that cross 
Hate me screaming masses 
I don't care if I'm lost 

Don't tell me that you're all better 
I don't care if you are Don't tell me that you're trendsetters 
I don't care if you are 

Say you will take my pills 
Say you will faking ill 

Don't tell me that you're all better 
I don't care if you are Don't tell me that you're bed wetters 
I don't care if you are 
Say you will take my pills 
Say you will faking ill 
Say you will say you will take my pills take my pills 
Say you will say you will faking ill
