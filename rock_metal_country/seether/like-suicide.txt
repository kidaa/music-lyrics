Premeditation will kill the trust
They'll never know if you fear me
With every second collecting dust
I feel so bloated and weary
'cause she belongs to heaven

She's comin' over like a suicide
And it's the same old trip
The same old trip as before
Another complicating suicide
And it's the same old trip
The same old trip as before

Burn...

She'll cut you down with a single thrust
She's taken over too quickly
No medication can cure the lust
So say a prayer for the sickly
'cause she belongs to heaven

She's comin' over like a suicide
And it's the same old trip
The same old trip as before
Another complicating suicide
And it's the same old trip
The same old trip as before... as before...

You set me up to fucking fail this time [x8]

She's comin' over like a suicide
And it's the same old trip
The same old trip as before
Another overbearing suicide
And it's the same old trip
The same old trip
She's coming over wearing genocide
And it's the same old trip
The same old trip as before
Another complicating suicide
And it's the same old trip
The same old trip as before... as before...
