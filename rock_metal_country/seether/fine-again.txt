Fine Again

It seems like every day's the same 
and I'm left to discover on my own 
It seems like everything is gray 
and there's no color to behold 
They say it's over and I'm fine again, yeah 
Try to stay sober feels like I'm dying here 

And I am aware now of how 
everything's gonna be fine one day 
Too late, I'm in hell I am prepared now, 
seems everyone's gonna be fine 
One day too late, just as well 

I feel the dream in me expire 
and there's no one left to blame it on 
I hear you label me a liar 
'cause I can't seem to get this through 
You say it's over, I can sigh again, yeah 
Why try to stay sober when I'm dying here 

And I am aware now of how 
everything's gonna be fine one day 
Too late, I'm in hell 
I am prepared now, 
seems everyone's gonna be fine 
One day too late; just as well 

And I'm not scared now. 
I must assure you, 
you're never gonna get away 
And I'm not scared now. 
And I'm not scared now. No 

I am aware now of how 
everything's gonna be fine one day 
Too late, I'm in hell 
I am prepared now 
seems everyone's gonna be fine 
One day too late, just as well 
I am prepared now, 
seems everything's gonna be fine for me 
For me; for myself. 
For me, for me, for myself 
For me, for me, for myself 
I am prepared now for myself 
I am prepared now, and I am fine again
