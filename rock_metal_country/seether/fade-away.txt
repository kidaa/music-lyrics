I wanna be there when you call
I wanna catch you when you fall
I wanna be the one you need
I wanna be the one you breathe

Today's the day we'll fade away, oh
Today's the day we'll fade away, oh
Today's the day we'll find our way grown
Today's the day we'll fade away

I wanna be there when you cry
And when you're down I'll help you fly
I wanna be the one you need
I wanna be the one you breathe

Today's the day we'll fade away, oh
Today's the day we'll fade away, oh
Today's the day we'll find our way grown
Today's the day we'll fade away, oh

But I'm coming back, 
and I'm taking back everything I can
It's breaking me up and tearing me up
It's all I have
And I'm coming back, 
and I'm taking back everything I can
It's breaking me up and tearing me up
It's all I have

Today's the day we'll fade away, oh
Today's the day we'll fade away, oh
Today's the day we'll find our way grown
Today's the day we'll fade away, oh
Today's the day we'll fade away, oh
Today's the day we'll fade away
