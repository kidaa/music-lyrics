Mary Danna/Jody Alan Sweet
I can't see you
But I can feel
Like a scar that
Just won't heal
Blue-eyed gypsy
You're still with me

Everywhere I go
Lonely
Won't leave me alone
You're everywhere I go
Lonely
Won't leave me alone

Another highway
One more town
I tried to lose you
But you tracked me down
Like the moonlight
On a dark night

You're down every winding road
Lonely
Won't leave me alone
Down every winding road
Lonely
Won't leave me alone
I know you told me
Our love's dead and gone
But here in my heart
It lives on
And on

You're every sad song
All night long
On my radio

Lonely
Won't leave me alone
Lonely
Won't leave me alone
Lonely
Won't leave me alone
I'm so lonely
Won't leave me alone
I'm so lonely
