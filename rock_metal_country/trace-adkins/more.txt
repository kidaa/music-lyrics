If anybody had told me that anybody'd have a hold on me
I'd say they were out of their mind
But speakin' of crazy, I'm findin' lately
All I want, all I need, all the time is

More of your sweet love
Too much just ain't enough
I never needed a fix like this before
Too strong to resist
I don't know when to quit
Like a kid in a candy store
You keep me comin' back for more

I can't explain it; I'm more than infatuated
You got me good, I got it bad
There's no doubt about it; I can't live without it
What you got I just gotta have
So gimme

More of your sweet love
Too much just ain't enough
I never needed a fix like this before
Too strong to resist
I don't know when to quit
Like a kid in a candy store
You keep me comin' back for more

Too strong to resist
I don't know when to quit
Like a kid in a candy store
You keep me comin' back for more
You keep me comin' back for more
You keep me comin' back for more
