I wanna tell you that I'm sorry 
I wanna say that I was wrong 
I wanna tell you that this circus 
That we been living in 
Ain't where we belong 
It's like the Grand Canyon 
And we're out here on the edge 
But we're still standin' 
Baby we haven't fallen yet 

I don't wanna talk anymore tonight 
Fallin' through the trap 
Of who's wrong and who's right 
It's easy to see 
The way you're lookin' at me 
That you just want the same things 
That I do 
All I want is to make love to you 
There's really nothing to say 
Don't let our words get in the way 

We both know love's not perfect 
It's good, it's bad, it's everything 
You know what makes it worth it 
For the all the moments in between 
There's a deep ocean 
Sometimes it's sink or swim 
These are real emotions 
So baby let's dive in 

I don't wanna talk anymore tonight 
Fallin' through the trap 
Of who's wrong and who's right 
It's easy to see 
The way you're lookin' at me 
That you just want the same things 
That I do 
All I want is to make love to you 
There's really nothing to say 
Don't let our words get in the way 

Baby 

You just want the same things 
That I do 
All I want is to make love to you 
There's really nothing to say 
Don't let our words get in the way 
Oh 
Don't let our words get in the way 
Don't let our words
