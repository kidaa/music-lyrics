They say that smokin' ain't allowed in here 
But I don't care 
Try to sneak you some 
Saw your buddies at the barber shop 
And they sure fight a lot 
Just like they've always done 
You look at me 
Like you don't know who I am 
But that's alright 
Cause I know who you are 

You're the stubborn one 
My great-granddaddy's son 
The one who drank his whiskey from a coffee cup 
Time has stripped you of 
So many things you love 
But you keep fightin' on 
Cause you're the stubborn one 

Remember when we saw Hank Aaron play 
I was in second grade 
You snuck me out of school 
And you wore overalls to Sunday church 
You said the Good Lord's work 
Ain't done in a monkey suit 
You bought your tires down at 
Eddie Shaw's garage 
You said K-Mart didn't need your dollar 

You're the stubborn one 
My great-granddaddy's son 
The one who drank his whiskey from a coffee cup 
Time has stripped you of 
So many things you love 
But you keep fightin' on 
Cause you're the stubborn one 

The nurses wonder why 
I keep comin' back 
They tell me you can't hear me 
I guess I'm more like you 
Than anybody knew 
I can't let go of what I hold so dearly 
The stubborn one 

You're the stubborn one 
My great-granddaddy's son 
The one who drank his whiskey from a coffee cup 
Time has stripped you of 
So many things you love 
But you keep fightin' on 
Cause you're the stubborn one 
You're the stubborn one 

Yeah, the stubborn one 
You're the stubborn one
