Maybe you were right, maybe I was wrong
Maybe I said goodbye a little too strong
But, you been away way too long... Come home
A little too harsh, a little too loud
Out there on the edge of a little too proud
But baby, you oughta see me now... Come home

Come Home, come home
Tell me all is forgiven, let's get back to livin'
Come home

I know there ain't no way to take it all back
Make it better after the fact
But I'd sure give my should for somethin' like that...
You just come home

Come Home, come home
Tell me all is forgiven, let's get back to livin'
Come homeCome Home Baby

Come Home, come home
Tell me all is forgiven, let's get back to livin'
Come home

I'm gonan wait, but it ain't too long
Come home, come home
Come home, come home
