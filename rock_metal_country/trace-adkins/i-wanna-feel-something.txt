If youre tellin me Im not on fire 
Youre just preachin to the choir 
Ive gotten dull as old barbed wire from livin 
Last night I watched the evening news 
It was the same ol nothin new 
It should have cut me right in two 
But it didnt 
I dont know why it didnt 

But I wanna feel somethin 
Somethin thats a real somethin 
That moves me, that proves to me Im still alive 
I wanna heart that beats and bleeds 
A heart thats bustin at the seams 
I wanna care, I wanna cry, I wanna scream 
I just wanna feel somethin 

If youre tellin me thats just how it is 
I dont buy it cause once I was kissed 
By a red-headed girl with cherry lips 
On her porch when I was sixteen 
And I felt it somewhere in my soul and time stood still and I couldnt let go 
I cant tell you cause I dont know how I got so cold 
When did I get so cold 

[Chorus:]
I just wanna feel somethin 
Somethin thats a real somethin 
That moves me, that proves to me Im still alive 
Run my fingers through your fingers, across your face and through your hair 
And close my eyes and breathe you in like air 
I just wanna feel somethin 

I hate that Im jaded and I make you cry 
But still you stick around me, only God knows why 
Damn it all to hell, Im done 
Cause I dont like what Ive become 
So come here, baby 
Come here, baby 

[Repeat Chorus]

Come here, baby
