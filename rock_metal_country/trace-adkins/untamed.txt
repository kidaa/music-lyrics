I like to be a little wild
I like to raise a litle Cain
I wanna keep it on the edge
Let my restless heart remain
Untamed

[Chorus]
I'm gunna live the way i love
And love the way i live
Walk the higest wire
And stay out on the limb
Away from any fences
Free of any chains
Unbound, untied, untamed

I only want what i've got coming
I'll take the credit and the blame
Even when im bent and broken
I pray my spirit always stays
Untamed

[Repeat chorus]

I take no map
I make no plans
I've let go of the reins
I have no rules
I feel no fear
No restraints
Untamed

Away from any fences
Free of any chains
Unbound, untied, untamed
