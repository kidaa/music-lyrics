Go ahead and tell me that you never really loved me, baby
Go ahead and tell me that the things I do have always made you crazy
Don't worry, darling
Don't worry, darling, that's okay
'Cause I'm gonna love you anyway
I'm gonna love you anyway

Go ahead and let it fall to pieces, tell me I've been blind
Maybe if I'd only seen it coming I'd have found a way to change your mind
Don't worry, darling
Don't worry, darling, that's okay
'Cause I'm gonna love you anyway
I'm gonna love you anyway

I'm gonna love you
In spite of it all
Drop everything, baby, run when you call
You're gonna stumble
You're gonna fall
And I'll be there
I'll be there for you

Go ahead and tell me that you're sorry no one else could take my place
I know that's what you're thinking I can see it by the way it's written on your face
Don't worry, darling
Don't worry, darling, that's okay
'Cause I'm gonna love you anyway
I'm gonna love you anyway
I'm gonna love you anyway

Go ahead and tell me that you never really loved me, baby
