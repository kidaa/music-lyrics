Alright 
Take a trip from here 

Bogalusa, Baton Rouge, 
New Orleans, Picayune, 
Boloxi, Pascagoula, 
Mobile Bay,Big full moon 
Diesel up just north of Destin 
Headed cross to Jacksonville 
Love to see the world come at me 
Through the bugs 
On a big windshield 
Yeah, that's right 

Tear it down in Raleigh-Durham 
Haven't got an hour to lose 
Head up to the coast to Virginia 
Read the newest Newport News 
Back across the Appalachians 
Blowin' into Louisville 
Love to feel the big wheels turnin' 
Always have and always will 

Somewhere inside me 
There's a new direction 
Somewhere before me 
There's an open road 
Can't go to sleep 
Without that diesel singin' 
Somebody tellin' me 
It's time to go 
Let's ride 
Come on boys, let's ride 
Come on boys, let's ride 

Little Rock, Texarkana, 
Dallas, Fort-Worth and El Paso 
110 in the desert 
Pedal down 
Go dog go 
Always love to see the people 
Always love to hear the crowd 
Always love to bring a party 
Turn it up and play it loud 

Somewhere inside me 
There's a new direction 
Somewhere before me 
There's an open road 
Can't go to sleep 
Without that diesel singin' 
Somebody tellin' me 
It's time to go 
Let's ride 
Come on boys, let's ride 

Let's ride like the wind 
I'll be back again 
As sure as this world's spins around 
One day I might find a reason 
To shut this thing down 
But for now 
Let's ride 

Somewhere inside me 
There's a new direction 
Somewhere before me 
There's an open road 
Can't go to sleep 
Without that diesel singin' 
Somebody tellin' me 
Tell me, it's time to go 
Let's ride 
Come on boys, let's ride 
Come on boys, let's ride 
Yeah 
Let's ride
