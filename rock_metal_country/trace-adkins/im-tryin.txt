This gettin up early pullin double shifts
Gonna make an old of me long before I ever get rich
But I'm tryin

It's been two years since we finalized
I still aint used to puttin Ex in front of wife
But I'm tryin

Send more money right away
Is pretty much all she has to say when she calls these days
And don't you be late

But all I can do, is all I can do
But I keep on tryin
And all I can be, is all I can be
And I keep on tryin
There's always a mountain in front of me
Seems I'm always climbing, and falling, and climbing,
But I keep on tryin

I remember daddy sayin keep your eye on the ball
Run like hell, play to win, get up when you fall
I'm tryin

Don't say nothin that you can't take back
Never do anything you might regret
No, don't do that
Daddy, I'm tryin

Know the difference between heaven and hell
Go easy on the bottle, be hard on yourself
And I know he meant well.

But all I can do, is all I can do
But I keep on tryin
And all I can be, is all I can be
And I keep on tryin
There's always a mountain in front of me
Seems I'm always climbing, and falling, and climbing,
But I keep on tryin.

Keep on tryin...

All I can do
Is all I can do
And I keep on tryin
And all I can be
That's all I can be
And I keep on tryin.

But all I can do, is all I can do
But I keep on tryin
There's always a mountain in front of me
Seems I'm always climbing, and stumbling, and falling, and climbing,
But I keep on tryin.

This gettin up early pulling double shifts
Is gonna make an old man of me long before I ever get rich,
But I'm tryin.
