A car goes by and I see a face
A stranger's face in the window
And I wish it was you
I'm in a room, it's a crowded room
A friend walks up to say hello
And I wish it was you
'Cause every memory that haunts my mind
Is just another reason why

[Chorus:]
I wish it was you
The phone ring in the middle of the night
The doorbell in the broad daylight
A letter in the mail that I come home to
I wish it was you
When I see two people on the street
Touchin' like they don't care who sees
Laughin' the way we used to do
I wish it was me and I wish it was you
I wish it was me and I wish it was you

I'll meet someone who could be the one
But something always happens
Before the night is through
There's that certain look and that certain smile
There's that old familiar pattern
And I wish it was you
Telling me that you'll be back someday
And I don't have to feel this way

[Chorus 2X]

I wish it was you
I wish it was you
