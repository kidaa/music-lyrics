it was a home run when the game was tied
a pick up truck when I could drive
one pink line when Katie said I'm late
it was a passing grade, a pretty girl
all the money in the world
what mattered then kept changing every day

but when I bow my head tonight
there'll be no me myself and I
just watch my wife and kids please lord
that's all I ask for any more

now a days it's crazy how
a passing storm, a siren sound
can make me drop it all and pick up the phone
to hear her say that all's okay is all I need to know these days
can't wait to see their faces when I get home

and when I bow my head tonight
there'll be no me myself and I
just watch my wife and kids please lord
that's all I ask for any more

let 'em outlive me by a hundred years
let their laughter dry up all their tears
let 'em love and be loved back like I have been

when I bow my head tonight
there'll be no me myself and I
just watch my wife and kids please lord
that's all I ask for any more

that's all that matters anymore
