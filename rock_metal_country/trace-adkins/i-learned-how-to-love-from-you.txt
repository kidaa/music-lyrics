I cannot be bitter
Even when the tears fall
Though I had to let you go
My heart knows
I learned how tho love from you

You found something hiding
I did not know was missing
An unlit fire down in my soul
Now my heart knows
I learned how to love from you

You loved like there never was a risk
Shared your heart with every tender kiss
Now I know how much I have to give
'Cause I learned how to love from you

If I start to fall again
I'll close my eyes and not resist
Without fear I'll just let go
'Cause my heart knows
That I learned how to trust
In the power of a touch
I learned how to love from you
