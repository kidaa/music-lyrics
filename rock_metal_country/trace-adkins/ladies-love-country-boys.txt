She grew up in the city in a little subdivision 
Her daddy wore a tie, mama never fried a chicken 
Ballet, straight-As, most likely to succeed 
They bought her a car after graduation 
Sent her down South for some higher education 
Put her on the fast track to a law degree 

Now shes coming home to visit 
Holding the hand of a wild-eyed boy 

With a farmers tan 

Shes riding in the middle of his pickup truck 
Blaring Charlie Daniels, yelling, Turn it up! 
They raised her up a lady but theres one thing 
They couldnt avoid 
Ladies love country boys 

You know mamas and daddies want better for their daughters 
Hope theyll settle down with a doctor or a lawyer 
And their uptown, ball gown, hand-me-down royalty 

They never understand why their princess falls 
For some camouflage britches and a southern-boy-drawl 

Or why shes riding in the middle of a pickup truck 
Blaring Hank Jr., yelling, Turn it up! 
They raised her up a lady but theres one thing 
They couldnt avoid 
Ladies love country boys 

You can train em, you can try to teach em 
Right from wrong but its still gonna turn em on 

And they go riding in the middle of a pickup truck 
Blaring Lynyrd Skynyrd, yelling, Turn it up! 
You can raise her up a lady but theres one thing 
You just cant avoid 
Ladies love country boys 
They love us country boys
