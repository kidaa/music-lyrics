Troubled soul, all alone
I can feel your sadness 
The hearache and the madness 

Are hittin' hard tonight 
You're cornered up and hunkered down 
The walls are tall around you 
For anyone to break through 
It's gonna be a fight 

[Chorus]
Bring it on, bring it on 
All your heartache and frustration 
You've been done wrong too long 
And I'm strong enough to change it 
Maybe in time, we'll turn water into wine 
Maybe love is what we'll find 
Bring it on 

It's not too late to fly away 
And I won't try to stop you 
So you do what you've got to 
I'll understand
But if you need a place to land 

A haven, safe and certain 
Someone to share your burden 
Then take my hand 

[Chorus 2x]
Bring it on, bring it on 
All your heartache and frustration 
You've been done wrong too long 
And I'm strong enough to change it 
Maybe in time, we'll turn water into wine 
Maybe love is what we'll find 
Bring it on 

Yeah, bring it on baby 
Baby, bring it on 
Bring it on 
Yeah, bring it on
