It's a song on the radio
It's your picture on the wall in my bedroom
It's any one of a million memories
Girl, everything takes me back but you

It's every place that we've ever been
It's running into someone we both knew
Or it's the face of a total stranger
Girl, everything takes me back but you

I've called you up I've begged and pleaded left love letters at your door
Though I broke your heart you gotta believe it hurt me even more
So what's it gonna take, what ya wanna hear Girl, I think I've paid my dues
And it might be just but it don't seem fair that everything takes me back but you

It's a sound or it's the silence
It's the thought of what I've done
I can't undo
Or it's the dream I can't put behind me
Girl, everything takes me back but you

I've called you up I've begged and pleaded left love letters at your door
Though I broke your heart you gotta believe it hurt me even more
So what's it gonna take, what ya wanna hear Girl, I think I've paid my dues
And it might be just but it don't seem fair that everything takes me back but you

It's the night or it's the morning
It's the thunder rolling in before it rains
Or it's a long, long, long, long stretch of highway
Girl, it's nothing and it's everything, it's everything

Everything takes me back but you
Girl, everything takes me back but you
