Well, I never really did anything wrong
But I guess I didn't do much right
It caught me off guard when I got home
And you weren't here tonight
Your not says I'm gonna be sorry
And that one of these days I'm gonna pay...well

You don't know what you're talking about
You think you've got it all figured out
Well I hate to be the one to break it to you
But when you said someday that
I would pay for lettin' you down
You were wrong
Cause I'm payin' for it now

Well I really didn't think I could hurt anymore
'Til you called me on the phone
You said you didn't want to talk,just had to be sure
That I didn't miss your note
Well, I think it's around here somewhere
And oh, baby, by the wayYou don't know what you're talking about
You think you've got it all figured out
Well I hate to be the one to break it to you
But when you said someday that
I would pay for lettin' you down
You were wrong
Cause I'm payin' for it now

Girl when you said someday
That I would pay for lettin' you down
You were wrong
'Cause, I'm payin' for it now
Oh, I'm payin' for it now
Trust me I'm payin' for it now
