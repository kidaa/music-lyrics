Look at you sittin' on that tailgate
All barefoot, beautiful & brown eyed
Just watching you breathin is blowin' me away
All I can think about tonight

Somebody find me a preacher
Somebody find me a man with a bible who can tie a knot.
I know what I got, I know who I love
Track him down, wake him up
Right here right now in this Tennessee Dirt
No long white dress No little white church
Just you in your cutoff jeans & my old t-shirt
Somebody find me a preacher

Baby I can't wait another minute
With you on my lap and your back against the wheel
I ain't got no diamond here to give ya
But if this is how loving you feels

Somebody find me a preacher
Somebody find me a man with a bible who can tie a knot.
I know what I got, I know who I love
Track him down, wake him up
Right here right now in this TN Dirt
No long white dress No little white church
Just you in your cutoff jeans & my old tshirt
Somebody find me a preacher

Cause I want to spend the rest of my life
Making you feel the way I feel tonight

Somebody find, Somebody find me a preacher
Somebody find me a man with a bible who can tie a knot.
I know what I got, I know who I love
Track him down, wake him up
Right here right now in this Tennessee Dirt
No long white dress No little white church
Just you in your cutoff jeans & my old t-shirt
Somebody find me a preacher

Somebody find me a preacher, find me a preacher
