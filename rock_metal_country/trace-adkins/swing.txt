First Base 
Why yes I went to Harvard 
SAFE 
I majored in pre-med 
He's got a big lead 
Picked off 
Just stayed for one semester 
It could be he's out 
Toms out who's next 
Swing batter batter swing batter batter swing batter batter swing

Swing batter batter swing batter batter swing batter batter swing 
Swing batter batter swing batter batter swing batter batter swing 
Swing it now 

[SOLO]

Everybody strikes out nine times out of ten 
But you got to step up to the plate son 'cause every now and then 
Fast ball 
She walked right up to me 
Here's the pitch 
Said could I take you home 
Theirs a drive 
Hey boys I'll see you later 
It could be, it...it is! 
Goin' goin' goin' gone 
Swing batter batter swing batter batter swing batter batter swing [6x]
