Everybody has their own idea of heaven
What kind of paradise they'll see 
Pearly gates, streets of gold
No getting sick, or growin old
Sounds like a beautiful place to be
But as for me

My heaven is a wood frame house with a great big porch goin all the way around
Sittin on the swing listenin to the sound of the birds singin
My heaven is a warm summer day in the back yard
While the kids all play, flies and mosquitos stay away 
While we're eattin watermelon
That's my heaven

You're always gonna find a few non-believers
Those who stay lost in the dark
But I believe there is a place
Full of light 'n love and grace
And I don't believe that its all that far in my heart

My heaven is a cell phone ring while I'm at work
And the only thing that you have to say 
Is you miss me and get home in a hurry
My heaven is the very worst day that I spent with you
When you were so mad but I still knew 
Nobody would leave cause that don't happen
In my heaven

My heaven is where I am now on the front porch of the wood frame house 
Swingin with you just lookin around at all I've been given and this life I'm livin
Is my heaven
My heaven, My heaven
