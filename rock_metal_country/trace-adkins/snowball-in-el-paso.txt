Trace Adkins/Trey Bruce
She left her boots she wears in the rain
She left her lady razor
She left a note that I can't explain
On the refrigerator
She left a book she's been reading for days
Beside her chest of drawers
She left her nightgown hanging
Behind the bathroom door
But she left me no choice as far as I can tell
When it comes to getting over her
She didn't leave me a chance in hell

Like a snowball in El Paso
Like a feather in the wind
Without a prayer I'll ever find someone like her again
A fast train is comin'
And my heart's a penny on the rail
No she didn't leave me a chance in hell

She left me wondering what I'm gonna do
With all these pieces left of me
She left her scent all over the room
So even in the dark I'd see
She left a thirsty man with no water in the well
And without a single storm cloud overhead
She didn't leave me a chance in hellLike a snowball in El Paso
Like a feather in the wind
Without a prayer I'll ever find someone like her again
A fast train is comin'
And my heart's a penny on the rail
No she didn't leave me a chance in hell

A fast train is comin'
And my heart's a penny on the rail
No, she didn't leave me a chance in hell
No, she didn't leave me a chance in hell
