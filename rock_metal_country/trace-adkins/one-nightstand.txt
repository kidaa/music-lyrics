Well it aint home
But itll have to do for a while
Got a fold down bed
Two windows on the parking lot
Three plates in the kitchenette
A table and chair where i can eat
A little black-and-white tv
A shower stall and a bathroom sink
And one two-drawer nightsand
Barely enough room to be a man

And on the nightstand
Sits a photograph
Of my wife and kids
Reminding me of how good it was
And right now, how bad it is
Beside it there's a coffe cup
Where i keep my wedding ring and stuff
And some nights it still keeps me up
How i got where i am
Funny how a man's life can be reduced
To one nightstand

On the fifth of last november
On a business trip in strangers
Alone for the night
She said 'hi im angie
And im from boston
Would you drink a beer with me
If i bought'em?
So i hit the hotel bar with her
Figured,what would it hurt?

Sittin' on the bed
Leanin' against the wall
With a bible and a gun
One of them was gonna save me
The only question was which one
So i got down on my shakin knees
Asked the lord forgive me please
Dropped the gun and grabbed my keys
That picture and my wedding band
Funny how a man's life can all come down
To one nightstand
One nightstand
One nightstand
