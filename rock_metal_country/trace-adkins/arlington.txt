I never thought that this is where i'd settle down, 
I thought i'd die an old man back in my hometown, 
They gave me this plot of land, me and some other men, for a job well done, 
There's a big white house sits on a hill just up the road, 
The man inside he cried the day they brought me home, 
They folded up a flag and told my mom and dad, we're proud of your son

[Chorus:]
And I'm proud to be on this peaceful peice of property, 
I'm on sacred ground and i'm in the best of company, 
I'm thankful for those things i've done, 
I can rest in peice, I'm one of the chosen ones, I made it to Arlington

I remember daddy brought me here when i was eight, 
We searched all day to find out where my granddad lay, 
And when we finally found that cross, 
He said, "son this is what it cost to keep us free" Now here i am, 
A thousand stones away from him,
He reconized me on the first day i came in, 
And it gave me a chill when he clicked his heels, and saluted me.

[Repeat Chorus]

And everytime i hear twenty-one guns, 
I know they brought another hero home to is

We're thankful for those thankful for the things we've done, 
We can rest in peace, 'cause we are the chosen ones, 
We made it to arlington, yea dust to dust, 
Don't cry for us,w e made it to arlington
