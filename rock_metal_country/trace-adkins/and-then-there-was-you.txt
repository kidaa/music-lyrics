No more than just a broken heart ago
I made a promise to myself I'd never
Trust someone again
Judging form my rough and rocky past
I wrote off love as just a game a fool will play and never win
And I felt certain I was right
'Til I turned a corner in the night

And there was you
Like an angel you just suddenly appeared
Sent to me With a love so true
That it could make up for the lies and wasted years
Now I see there were other loves I knew
And there was you

I've heard the words ";I love You"; said in vain so many  times
I quit believing that someone could really care
And after one too many dead end roads
I found myself stumbling through the dark down to my last prayer
I didn't know what else to try
'Til I raised my head and opened my eyes

And there was you
Like an angel you just suddenly appeared
Sent to me With a love so true
That it could make up for the lies and wasted years
Now I see there were other loves I knew
And there was you
