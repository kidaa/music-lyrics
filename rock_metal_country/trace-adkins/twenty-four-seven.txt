J.B. Rudd/Vip Vipperman
I've got this craving around the clock
And it's got a hold on me
I've had it bad since the moment we met
I can't get no relief

You're the only train of thought on my one track mind
Going ninety miles an hour baby all the time

Twenty-four, seven
You're the only thing that matters to me
Twenty-four hours girl, every day
Seven long days a week
I'm in heaven, heaven
Twenty-four, seven

Every night when I go to sleep
In my dreams there you are
You're the first thing I think about
And that's how the morning starts

It seems like everything I say and do
Is all about me being in love with youTwenty-four, seven
You're the only thing that matters to me
Twenty-four hours girl, every day
Seven long days a week
I'm in heaven, heaven
Twenty-four, seven

You're the only train of thought on my one track mind
Going ninety miles an hour baby all the time

Twenty-four, seven
You're the only thing that matters to me
Twenty-four hours girl, every day
Seven long days a week
I'm in heaven, heaven
Twenty-four, seven

I'm in heaven
Twenty-four, seven
Twenty-four hours girl, every day
Seven long days a week
I'm in heaven, heaven
Twenty-four seven
Twenty-four seven girl
