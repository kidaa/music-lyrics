Ahhh yeah.... 
I'm gonna preach you now brothers & sisters, listen... 

Northern dolls, pretty please 
Dot their I's and cross their T's 
Black skirt, high heels, show you no pity 

Sunshine smile, Pacific Gals 
Got the DNA mojo know-how 
Yes, man, they can make you so dizzy 

Made out of Heaven's grand design 
It's right there across that Mason-Dixon line 

Georgia girls get you jumpin' 
Bama belles set hearts pumpin' 
Texarkana maids are somethin' with their sweet tea hospitality 
Mississippi ladies' mission 
Keep them Yankee boys a wishin' 
Ol' Webster's definition is zippity-doo-dah what we do to ya 
The girls with Southern Hallelujah 

Well hey who knew the way they talk 
How do you dos and bless your hearts 
And hey y'all drawls melt you like butter 

Lose your Ps and Qs 
They'll set you down 
Give you a who to 
They'll hush your mouth 
Nice to find some spice in the sugar 

Restores my faith in humanity 
Can I get a witness out there 
Who agrees with me? 

Georgia girls get you jumpin' 
Bama belles set hearts pumpin' 
Louisiana maids are somethin' with their sweet tea hospitality 
Mississippi ladies' mission 
Keep them Yankee boys a wishin' 
Ol' Webster's definition is zippity-doo-dah what we do to ya 
The girls with Southern Hallelujah 

Their kinda beauties just born to make us cry 
Don't ask me how I know cuz I can't tell ya why 
Just know that I'm one helluva lucky guy 
Whoa oh and then some 
Can I get an amen, son? 
Amen now. 

Georgia girls get you jumpin' 
Bama belles set hearts pumpin' 
Carolinas maids are somethin' with their sweet tea hospitality 
Mississippi ladies' mission 
Keep them Yankee boys a wishin' 
Ol' Webster's definition is zippity-doo-dah what we do to ya 
The girls with Southern Hallelujah 
Southern Hallelujah 
Yeah, amen son
