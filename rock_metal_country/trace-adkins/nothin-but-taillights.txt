Bob DiPiero/Gerry House/Devon O'Day
She used to sit in the passenger seat
Tappin' on the dash with her bare feet
Poppin' that gum and paintin' her toenails blue
She'd turn on the radio and crank it up
That girl could never get it loud enough
She'd make up words to songs she thought she knew

Yeah saturday nights we'd lead the parade
Of tricked out Fords and Chevrolets
We'd cruise through town and head down to the lake
Well I was hangin' with the boys a little bit later
Talkin' 'bout tires and carburetors
When I happened to see my whole world drive away

Now I've got nothin' but taillights
Nothin' but goodbye
Nothin' but leavin' goin' on
And I'm nothin' but sorry
Got nothin' but memories
She's nothin' but taillights gone

I ain't sayin' she stole that car
But that was May and this is March
And all I get are tickets in the mail
She was doin' eighty-five in Tennessee
Clocked in Kansas doin' ninety-three
I just hope she lets me post her bailCause I've got nothin' but taillights
Nothin' but goodbye
Nothin' but leavin' goin' on
And I'm nothin' but sorry
Got nothin' but memories
She's nothin' but taillights gone...come back baby

I've got nothin' but taillights
Nothin' but goodbye
Nothin' but leavin' goin' on
And I'm nothin' but sorry
Got nothin' but memories
She's nothin' but taillights gone

Lord she's nothin' but taillights gone
