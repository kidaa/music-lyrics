Bernie Nelson/Scott Miller
From the time you were a baby
You had this notion in your head
Someone would come along and sweep you off your feet
Like in all those storybooks you read
Well if you're lookin` for salvation
Like some damsel in destress
Girl there ain't no heroes on white horses
At least I ain't seen 'em yet

There ain't no knights in shinin` armor
There ain't no never, never land
And I won't ever walk on water
I can only love you like a man

Now heaven knows I'm no angel
Just flesh and bone like all the rest
I never clamed to have a halo
All I can give you is my best
But, I will never try to hurt you
Or even give you cause to doubt
That my heart is yours forever
Ain't that what true love's all aboutThere ain't no knights in shinin` armor
There ain't no never, never land
And I won't ever walk on water
I can only love you like a man

No I won't ever walk on water
I can only love you like a man
