Darrell Scott
I am grounded
But I have wings to fly
I just don't use them
I just look up in the sky
And keep 'em hidden
Bound up in a coat and tie
'Til the world is ready for a man with wings to fly

But I will fly someday
I'll break these feet of clay
Then I'll be on my way
My way

I am feeling
Though I do not shed a tear
My eyes are dusty
Though I have faced my fear of fears
I am shaken by the coming on of the years
I am a feeling man but I cannot shed a tear

But I will cry someday
I'll break these eyes of clay
Then I'll be on my way, my way
SomedayOh someday

I am loving
Though I make my bed alone
I've had lovers
But I have no one of my own
But I could feed her
From the garden I have grown
I am a loving man though I make my bed alone

But I will love someday
I will break this heart of clay
Then I'll be on my way, my way
Someday
On my way, someday
I'm gonna love someday
