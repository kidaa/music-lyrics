I met a guy on the red eye
He spotted my guitar 
And said what do you do?
I said, I sing for a living,
Country music mixed with 
A little rock and a little blues
He said I'm sorry 
But I've never been crazy 
'bout that twang and trains and hillbilly thing
What ever made you want to sing stuff like that?
I just looked at him and laughed and said

Cause it's songs about me
And who I am
Songs about loving and living 
And good hearted women and family and God
Yeah they're all just 
Songs about me
Songs about me

So I offered him tickets
I said you'll see what I mean 
If you show up tonight
He said I doubt you'll change my opinion
I'll be kind of busy, but hey man, I'll try

Then later on when we finished our songs
About scars and cars and broken hearts
I saw him, he was standing there 
Right next to the stage 
And he shouted
Man you were right 
It was like you sang those

Songs about me
And who I am
Songs about loving and living 
And good hearted women and family and God
Yeah they're all just 
Songs about me
Songs about me

So I'll just keep on singing
'til I hear the whole world singing those 

Songs about me
And who I am
Songs about loving and living 
And good hearted women and family and God
Yeah they're all just 
Songs about me
Songs about me
