Trace Adkins/Sam Hogin/Jim McBride
You left without saying I love you
And that makes three days in a row
Now that you're tired of pretending
It's time that I let you know

I don't disagree with your feelings
We both need to find a new life
But this ain't the way we should end it
It's a bad way of saying goodbye

There must be a better way of sayin` it's over
Where nobody walks away with tears in their eyes
When you stay 'til regret is all you have left
That's a bad way of saying goodbye

When I think of you I'll remember
How you looked at me when we met
But the way that you're looking at me now
I'll do my best to forgetIt's not your fault, but it's not mine
We both made mistakes though we tried
So leaving without syaing I'm sorry
Is a bad way of saying goodbye

There must be a better way of saying its over
Where nobody walks away with tears in their eyes
When you stay 'til regret is all you have left
That's a bad way of saying goodbye

That's a bad way of saying goodbye
