Frank Rogers/Chet Biggers
That old photograph of us sure looks out of place
Laying on your bag out in the hall.
You're takin' it to remind you of our better days...
The one's you say you'll miss when you're gone.

Don't lie...don't try to fool me...
Cause girl I know what's goin' on.
Don't lie...you owe it to me...
Believe me leave well enough alone.
So just go ahead and say goodbye...
But don't lie.

Well I've seen all his letters in the closet
I've caught a trace of his cologne on you at night.
So don't stand there and act so broken hearted...
Tell me how its killin' you inside.Don't lie...don't try to fool me...
Cause girl I know what's goin' on.
Don't lie...you owe it to me...
Believe me leave well enough alone.
So just go ahead and say goodbye...
But don't lie.

Just come out and say it...
Don't worry I can take it...
Don't you think that I deserve the truth?

Don't lie...don't try to fool me...
Cause girl I know what's goin' on.
Don't lie...you owe it to me...
Believe me leave well enough alone.
So just go ahead and say goodbye...
But don't lie.
