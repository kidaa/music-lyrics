Down the street, up the drive
Park the car, step outside
Across the lawn, up the stairs
On the porch, I'm getting there

Key in the lock, through the door
Down the hall I've walked so many times before
I'm dog-tired, but I don't care
Bedroom door, I'm getting there

She's got a hundred candles burning
She's got next-to-nothing on, yeah, yeah

[Chorus:]
Baby, I'm home
I've been away way too long
I've been waitin', I've been workin'
Wantin' you so bad it's hurtin'
Now I'm back where I belong
Baby I'm home

My arms around you, your lips to mine
Feel our hearts beat-beatin' in time
Hands in your hair, everywhere
I hear you whisper, I'm gettin there

She's got a hundred candles burning
They'll be burning all night long, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]

Every night without you, I've been dreamin' 'bout tonight
Missin' everything about you, girl there's no place like

Baby I'm home
I've been away way too long
Baby I'm home
I've been away way too long

[Chorus]

Yeah baby I'm home
Oh I couldn't wait to get here
Yeah baby I'm home
Let me lock the door, close the curtains
That's what I been missin' right there
Looks like it's gonna be a long night
I miss you
