I been thinkin' 'bout our love situation
All this attraction in the present tense
I've reached the only logical conclusion
Love ain't supposed to make sense

This ain't no thinkin` thing, right brain, left brain
It goes a little deeper than that
It's a chemical, physical, emotional devotion
Passion that we can't hold back
There's nothin` that we need to analyze
There ain't no rhyme or reason why
'Cause this ain't, this ain't no thinkin` thing

Forget mathematical equations
Self help psychology
Gray matter don't matter much darlin`
When it's gettin` down to you and meThis ain't no thinkin` thing, right brain, left brain
It goes a little deeper than that
It's a chemical, physical, emotional devotion
Passion that we can't hold back
There's nothin` that we need to analyze
There ain't no rhyme or reason why
'Cause this ain't, this ain't no thinkin` thing

There's nothing that we need to analyze
There ain't no rhyme or reason why
'Cause this ain't, this ain't no thinkin` thing
This ain't, no this ain't no thinkin` thing
