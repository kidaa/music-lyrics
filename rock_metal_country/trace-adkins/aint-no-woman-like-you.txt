Ain't no ride like a 65 Mustang 
Ain't no cool like James Dean cool 
Ain't no man alive tough as ol' John Wayne 
And ain't no woman like you 

Ain't no rose like the yellow rose of Texas 
Ain't no freedom like the last day of school 
Ain't no whiskey like Tennessee Whiskey 
And there ain't no woman like you 

I ain't been around the world 
But I've been around the block 
Don't claim to know it all 
I just know what I got 
Something I've never had 
And I ain't gonna lose 
No baby 
Ain't no woman like you 

Thought I knew sweet 
Til I tasted your kisses 
Thought I'd been moved 
Til I saw you move 
Thought I knew love but now I know what I was missin' 
'Cause there ain't no woman like you 

I ain't been around the world 
But I've been around the block 
Don't claim to know it all 
I just know what I got 
Something I've never had 
And I ain't gonna lose 
No there 
Ain't no woman like you 
Ain't no other woman 

Ain't no sound 
Like a wide open Harley 
Ain't no blues 
Like the Memphis blues 
And baby by the way did I forget to mention 
That there ain't no woman like you 
No there ain't no woman like you 
No other woman 
Ain't no other woman like you babe 
You're the only one
