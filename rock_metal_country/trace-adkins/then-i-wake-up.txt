I smell the fragrance of your hair
Feel your fingers and your breath on my skin
When we're here alone like this
A crazy world makes perfect sense
I hear you whisperin' my name
Your kisses leave the sweetest taste, on my lips
When you say, "I love you too" 
Soft and tender like you do
I know all my dreams have come true

Then I wake up
On the floor, beside our bed
Where I sleep
Ever since the night you left me alone
In this old house
Days go by, but I'm still in love
With who we used to be
Now you're just a precious memory
I can count on every night to hold me tight
Then I wake up

I lay here while the truth sinks in
I'm still alone you're still not here
And we're still through
I remember our last night
Every word right up to goodbye
Slowly I drift off again
I'm saying words I wish I'd said
That night, to you
And you don't drive off in your car
And I don't have a broken heart
And you can't wait to be in my arms

Then I wake up
On the floor, beside our bed
Where I sleep
Ever since the night you left me alone
In this old house
Days go by, but I'm still in love
With who we used to be
Now you're just a precious memory
I can count on every night to hold me tight
Then I wake up

I'm still in love
With who we used to be
Now you're just a precious memory
I can count on every night to hold me tight
Then I wake up
On the floor, beside our bed
Where I sleep
Ever since the night you left me alone
In this old house
