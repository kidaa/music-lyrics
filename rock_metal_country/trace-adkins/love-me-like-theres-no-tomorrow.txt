Hold me like there's no next time
Like it's the last time you'll have the chance to
Show me how much you want me
Like I'm the only thing that matters
No one knows when the world's gonna end
So let's make love like we never will again

'Cause if the sun never rises, I wanna go down in flames
I want the last thing I hear to be you whisperin' my name
If every moment together is time that we borrowed

Then hold me tight and love me like there's no tomorrow
I hope we live forever
And that day will never come, but darlin'
I know if it ever happens
I couldn't imagine not being in your arms
There's so much we take for granted in life
So love me baby like we're running out of time

'Cause if the sun never rises, I wanna go down in flames
I want the last thing I hear to be you whisperin' my name
If every moment together is time that we borrowed

'Cause if the sun never rises, I wanna go down in flames
I want the last thing I hear to be you whisperin' my name
If every moment together is time that we borrowed

Hold me tight and love me like there's no tomorrow
