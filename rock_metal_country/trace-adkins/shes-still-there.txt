Darlin' here's a photograph of my old high school class
No I ain't been back in quite a while
See there that's Emma Lou, the one I gave my heart to
But there's a story you can't see behind her smile
It was gonna last forever, we were gonna see the world
So I guess you're curious just what became of her, well

She's still there in Oklahoma
She's still seventeen
She's livin' with her Mama
Workin' at the Dairy Queen
And she's still standin' on the front porch
With a red ribbon in her hair
The rest of us have scattered everywhere
But she's still there

Everett went to Omaha, he majored in business law
Jill's in Arkansas with husband number two
That's her best friend Jolene, she joined up with the Marines
I hear Billy Green's on a beach in Malibu
Yes and Emma would be happy if she could only see us now
'Cause we're livin' out the lives that she only dreamed about

She's still there in Oklahoma
She's still seventeen
She's livin' with her Mama
Workin' at the Dairy Queen
And she's still standin' on the front porch
With a red ribbon in her hair
The rest of us have scattered everywhere
But she's still there

Lord, I know I'll never see her
With silver in her hair
I know she's really gone
But in my heart I'd swear

She's still there in Oklahoma
She's still seventeen
She's livin' with her Mama
Workin' at the Dairy Queen
And she's still standin' on the front porch
With a red ribbon in her hair
The rest of us have scattered everywhere
But she's still there

Emma's still there
