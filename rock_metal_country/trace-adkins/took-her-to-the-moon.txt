Mark Nesler/Byron Hill
I'm not sure what I did just yet
But something kicked in on the night we met
Look's like her hearts out of control
What she's gonna do next, I don't know
She's already dreaming about a house on the hill
How does she think we're gonna pay those bills
When all I can afford is a two room shack
I took her to the moon and I can't bring her back

Now where did my fishing magazines go
Everywhere I look there's another Cosmo
Flowers in the kitchen and a new bedspread
Now you tell me, was it something I said
Even old blue's taking it rough
She clipped his nails and powdered him up
Her mind's running on a one way track
I took her to the moon and I can't bring her back

Where's that girl that I used to know
The one who said we'd better take it slow
What on earth do I do now
To put her feet back on the groundShe goes to the mall but she never says why
She brings home things that a man won't buy
I've already told her enough's enough
Now what are we gonna do with all this stuff
She bought a bunch of soap that she won't let me use
A toilet seat cover and hand towels too
The kind you don't touch, just leave 'em on the rack
I took her to the moon and I can't bring her back

Where's that girl that I used to know
The one who said we'd better take it slow
What on earth do I do now
To put her feet back on the ground

She's already dreaming about a house on the hill
Now how does she think we're gonna pay those bills
When all I can afford is a two room shack
I took her to the moon and I can't bring her back
Lord, I took her to the moon and I can't bring her back
