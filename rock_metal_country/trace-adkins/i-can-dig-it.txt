You say his memory is a habit that won't let you go I'll help you kick it
If you're looking for a ride on a real smooth road I'm your ticket
If you're holding onto seeds you been wanting to sow
If you wanna break ground, I'll break out the hoe
If you want a little garden where some lovin' can grow
I can dig it

If you wanna build a fortified house of love I can brick it
Name me something that you want, ain't a task to tough
I can get it, yeah I can get it
If you're lookin' for a man that can do all that
If you want your broken heart to be your last
If you wanna big hole to bury your past
I can dig it

If you're buying what I'm selling just say the word
And I'll roll up my sleeves and baby, I'll get to work

If you're sick and tired of a liar and cheater
If you want a true love 'til you meet St. Peter
A drink from a well where the water is sweeter
I can dig it, yeah I can dig it

I dug that

If you're buying what I'm selling just say the word
And I'll roll up my sleeves yeah and baby, I'll get to work

If you're sick and tired of a liar and cheater
If you want a true love 'til you meet St. Peter
A drink from a well where the water is sweeter
I can dig it, yeah I can dig it

Can you dig it, baby?
