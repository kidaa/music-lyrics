Pardon me mister, it was my mistake
I gotta be more careful in a crowd
If you caught me talkin` to someone you can't see
Don't mind me, I'm dreamin` out loud

I can't help wondering what did I do wrong
To lose the only one I care about
I can't stop living in the used to be
Don't mind me, I'm dreamin` out loud

All I hear is her whisper my name
All I see is her hair tumble down
When I feel the touch of her hand in mine
I find I'm dreamin` out loudWell I'd better be going, got some place to be
I know she's somewhere in this town
And until I find her and she comes back to me
I'll be dreamin` out loud

All I hear is her whisper my name
All I see is her hair tumble down
When I feel the touch of her hand in mine
I find I'm dreamin` out loud

I'm dreamin` out Loud
