I wake up late at night
Makin' sure you're still by my side
I try hard not to make a sound
Can't help my heart it just beats so loud
So full of love I could burst
The way I feel about you girl I wanna just

Scream at the top of my lungs
Tell the whole world how much I love you
Shout it from the highest mountain
Let 'em know I found the girl of my dreams
It's pure electricity girl, you got into me
Like nobody else could
It feels so good I could scream

How can I sleep with you right there
I wanna bury my face in your long blonde hair
Moonlight falls across your skin
I fight the urge building up again
But it's too late I feel the rush
Runnin' through my body girl I wanna justScream at the top of my lungs
Tell the whole world how much I love you
Shout it from the highest mountain
Let 'em know I found the girl of my dreams
It's pure electricity girl, you got into me
Like nobody else could
It feels so good I could scream

Can't help myself I gotta
Here it comes, I'm gonna scream
I'm sorry, I just couldn't help myself
Scream
Make me wanna scream baby
Here it come baby, I'm gonna
Scream, yeah
You scream too if you feel the need to
