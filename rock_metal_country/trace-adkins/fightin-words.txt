Alright 

Everyone knows I'm the hard workin' peace lovin' type 
I walk a thousand miles out of my way 
Just to keep from a fight 
Poke fun at the way that I talk 
Or this hat that I wear 
You can say what you want about me 
See if I care 

But one slip of the tongue 'bout my God Or my mama 
Or this flag that I wear on my shirt 
You'll see a side of me man 
That I don't think you wanna 
Cause them there's fightin' words 

Now don't get me wrong 
I've swapped skin now and then in my youth 
I was all for an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth 
Now the older I get 
The less I wanna stand toe to toe 
But before you go runnin' your mouth 
I think you oughta know 

That one slip of the tongue 'bout my God 
Or my mama 
Or this flag that I wear on my shirt 
You'll see a side of me man 
That I don't think you wanna 
Cause them there's fightin' words 

Chevrolet or Ford 
The south or the north 
That ain't gonna get me worked up 
But I'll draw the line 
Everytime when it comes to the things that I love 

So one slip of the tongue 'bout my dog 
Or my woman 
Or this country that I proudly serve 
You'll see a side of me man 
That you damn sure don't wanna 
Cause them there's fightin' words 
Yeah, them's fightin' words 
Ahh them's fightin' words, Hoss 

[spoken]
Excuse me 
First amendment? 
Son, the first amendment protects you from the government 
Not from me 
You can say whatever you want to out there 
You come within reach of me 
I'll exercise my right to give you a good ol' country ass whoopin' 
Is what I'll do for you 
By God
