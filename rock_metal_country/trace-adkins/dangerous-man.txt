Usually Im level-headed aint too excitable 
Keep it on the slow and steady, Mr. Dependable 
Always had the same job, the same look, the same friends 
Thats the way its gonna stay 
Thats the way its always been 

I never knew I had another side 
But girl with you Im Jekyll and Hyde 

[Chorus:]
When the lights are down low 
And you nibble on my neck 
I cant be held responsible 
For what might happen next 
No telling what Ill do 
When I get you in my hands 
With a woman like you 
Im a dangerous man 
Yeah Im a dangerous man 

All the things I want to do 
All the things I want to say 
I never met anyone 
Ever made me feel this way 
Youre like a drug, baby 
You make me crazy, honey 
Make me want to rob a bank 
And make love in the pile of money 

Dont try to act all 
innocent and sweet 
Cause you know exactly what it is you do to me 

[Repeat Chorus]

Im a fairly dangerous man 

[Repeat Chorus]
