It's the hour of ghosts I'm the soul surivior
You keep pushing me
To pull another all-nighter
Watching on these walls
Memory silhouettes
All the tender times
All the old regrets

And I wish I could take back our last goodbye
Knowing what I know now about foolish pride
I'd hold you in my loving arms
And say I love you so
And I would't start this story
Once upon a fool ago

It's the same routine
Ever since you've gone
You creep into my dreams
Won't leave me alone
So I haunt these halls
And I rattle my chains
And I moan about
What I can't change

And I wish I could take back our last goodbye
Knowing what I know now about foolish pride
I'd hold you in my loving arms
And say I love you so
And I would't start this story
Once upon a fool agoIt's the hour of the ghosts
I'm the soul survivor you keep pushing
me to pull another all-nighter

And I wish I could take back our last goodbye
Knowing what I know now about foolish pride
I'd hold you in my loving arms
And say I love you so
And I would't start this story
Once upon a fool ago

No, I wouldn't start this story
Once upon a fool ago.
