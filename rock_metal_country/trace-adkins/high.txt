Ain't no whiskey in this glass 
Try not to smoke too many cigarettes 
I stay away from Mary Jane 
These are my choices 

Ain't gonna judge you if you do 
So don't you judge me if I don't 
I got my reasons, my demons and my past 
But hey the truth is 
Yeah the truth is 

I get high 
Drivin' down the freeway 
Just knowin' that it's Saturday 
And I got no place to be 
I get high 
Standin' in the spotlight 
No words for what it feels like 
When you sing these songs back to me 
If you ask me now 
I'll tell you this is how 
I get high 

Sometimes this world can be too much 
Somedays I feel like bein' out of touch 
And I see a sunset that takes my breath away 
And I find hope again 
Set there and drink it in 
I get high 
Drivin' down the freeway 
Just knowin' that it's Saturday 
And I got no place to be 
I get high 
Standin' in the spotlight 
No words for what it feels like 
When you sing these songs back to me 
And if you ask me now 
I'll tell you this is how 
I get high 

I get high 
Standin' in the spotlight 
No words for what it feels like 
When you sing my songs back to me 
And if you ask me now 
I'll tell you this is how 
I get high 
Yeah this is how I get high
