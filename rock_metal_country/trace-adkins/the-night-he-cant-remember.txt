Trace Adkins/Kenny Beard/Sarah Majors
He lost his job that mornin' stopped off and bought a fifth of pride
A reality eraser, a little taste to help face her that night
He broke his same ol' promise when he showed up with whiskey on his breath
That night he can't remember, the one that she can't forget

Now he's been clean and sober since twenty-three October '95
His drinking days are over but there's that one she can't get off her mind
He tries to apologize but can't recall and don't realize
She won't forgive whatever he said
That night he can't remember, the one she can't forget

Well, she never has remarried 'cause she never has stopped carryin' the pain
It serves as a reminder that the man she left behind her just couldn't change
If she only knew she probably saved his life the night she left
That night he can't remember, the one that she just can't forget

Now he's been clean and sober since twenty-three October '95
His drinking days are over but there's that one she can't get off her mind
And he tries to apologize but can't recall and don't realize
She won't forgive whatever he said
That night he can't remember
Oh the night he can't remember, the one she can't forget

The night he can't remember is the one she can't forget
