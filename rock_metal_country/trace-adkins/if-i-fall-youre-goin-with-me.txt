Walt Aldridge/Will Robinson
I don't know what you had in mind
When you whispered those words to me
Maybe some fun, maybe someone
To be with temporarily
But if you keep making me feel this good
Whenever I'm close to you
It's only fair I make you aware
Of what you're 'bout to get into

If I fall you're goin` with me
It's a long way down
And I ain't about to go it alone
If I give all my heart
You better get ready
'Cause you're goin` with me
If I fall

Now I'm not sayin` it's all your fault
But what's a man supposed to do
Tryin` to play it safe gets harder every day
With a woman like you
Maybe you don't know what dangerous ground
That you're walkin` on now
But everytime your lips touch my lips
You're closer to finding outCause if I fall you're goin' with me
It's a long way down
And I ain't about to go it alone
If I give all my heart
You better get ready
'Cause you're goin` with me
If I fall

If I give all my heart
You better get ready
Girl 'cause you're goin` with me
If I fall
