Well, I said I'd call her sometime
No, I think I said I just might
'Cause I was cool as Colorado - Mr. Saturday night
We're talkin' shades on 
Leanin' on the payphone
I let her know right off I was the restless kind
Don't expect for me to get all tangled up and tied
I was one smooth cowboy
But, don't look now, boy

She's comin' on strong - From out of nowhere
She's some kind of sweet - I'm some kind of scared
She's touchin' my hat, and I don't even care
She's comin' on strong 
In her big blue eyes - I can do no wrong
I was doin' all right - Gettin' by on my own
'Til little miss, "You Know Who" comes along
She's comin' on strong

Now who's that calling me her little honey bear
Sittin' next to me, with her head on my shoulder
We're talking up close, and I'm thinkin' uh oh
Where's all this luvy-duvy stuff comin' from
I've tried to tell her I'm no good, and any day I'm bound to run
But she just laughs
Man, what's up with that

She's comin' on strong - From out of nowhere
She's some kind of sweet - I'm some kind of scared
She's touchin' my hat, and I don't even care
She's comin' on strong 
In her big blue eyes - I can do no wrong
I was doin' all right - Gettin' by on my own
'Til little miss, "You Know Who" comes along
She's comin' on strong - From out of nowhere
She's some kind of sweet - I'm some kind of scared
She's touchin' my hat, and I don't even care
She's comin' on strong
