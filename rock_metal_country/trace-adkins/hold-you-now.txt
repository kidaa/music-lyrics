I can't take back the things I said
To you in the past
Or make you forget the reasons why
We didn't last

I'm haunted by what might have been
Still I can't change who I was back then

But if I could hold you now you'd see
I've turned myself around and now
I'm someone you'd be proud to love
I'd do all the right things, make promises
That I'd keep
It'd hurt too much to let you down
And in my arms there'd be no room for doubt
If I could hold you now

It's funny how this empty room
Makes it all too clear
When I let you leave
A part of me just disappearedBut if I'd known then what I've come to know
There's no way I could have let you go

But if I could hold you now you'd see
I've turned myself around and now
I'm someone you'd be proud to love
I'd do all the right things, make promises
That I'd keep
It'd hurt too much to let you down
And in my arms there'd be no room for doubt
If I could hold you now

But if I'd known then what I've come to know
There's no way I could have let you go

But if I could hold you now you'd see
I've turned myself around and now
I'm someone you'd be proud to love
I'd do all the right things, make promises
That I'd keep
It'd hurt too much to let you down
And in my arms there'd be no room for doubt
If I could hold you now

If I could hold you now
If I could hold you now
