Give me a front porch with a summer breeze
Give me ";Yes Ma'am";, ";No Sit"; and ";Thank you";,
";Please";
Give me a hero who don't lie, steal or cheat
And a little good news
Give me Christmas through children's eyes
One vacation good as advertised
Most of all, as if it's any surprise
Baby, give me you

At the top of my list of life's good things
Is the pleasure and purpose your love brings
And of all that I hold near to me
That's real and right and true
Give me you , Give me you

Give me a day not so prearranged
In fact, give me the phone my plans have changed
Give me a break from chasin' dollars day
Baby, give me youAt the top of my list of life's good things
Is the pleasure and purpose your love brings
And of all that I hold near to me
That's real and right and true
Give me you , Give me you

At the top of my list of life's good things
Is the pleasure and purpose your love brings
And of all that I hold near to me
That's real and right and true
Give me you , Give me you

Baby, give me you, Give me, give me you
