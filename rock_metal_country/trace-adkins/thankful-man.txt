Stephen Allen DavisMy daddy was blue collar
He worked for the man all of his life
He showed up when he didn't want to be there
A man of his word, believed in doing things right
I remember when i was a kid
He'd say time and time again
It's a good life; it's a real good life
And I'm a thankful man
I'm a thankful man for every turn
On every highway I've been down
Every mile I've lost, every crossroad stop
Every storm that turned me around
Oh, it's better than I could have planned
It's made me who I am
It's a good life; it's a real good life
And I'm a thankful man
My mama was a dreamer
But she was the rock that we all leaned on
She taught me about the lessons in life
The difference between what's right and wrong
And every word was a gift from her
That helped me understand
It's a good life; it's a real good life
And  I'm a thankful man
I'm a thankful man for every turn
On every highway I've been down
Every mile I've lost, every crossroad stop
Every storm that turned me around
Oh, it's better than I could have planned
It's made me who I am
It's a good life; it's a real good life
And I'm a thankful man
It's better than I could have planned
It's made me who I am
It's a good life; it's a real good life
And I'm a thankful man
t's a good life; it's a real good life
