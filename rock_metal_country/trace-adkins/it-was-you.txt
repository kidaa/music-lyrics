Trey Bruce/Craig Wiseman
Some people say fallin` in love is purely chance
The random blend of time and place, circumstance
That couldn't be farther from the truth
'Cause with you

It wasn't the stars in the sky
That got to me that night
Or the music that we were dancing to
It wasn't the moon up above
That had me falling in love
It was more than all those things alone could do
It was youI do believe we're all a part of some greater plan
That only angels in our hearts can understand
Somehow I know I'd found my place
When I saw your face

It wasn't the stars in the sky
That got to me that night
Or the music that we were dancing to
It wasn't the moon up above
That had me falling in love
It was more than all those things alone could do
It was you
