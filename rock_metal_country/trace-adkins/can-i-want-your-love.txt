Is this wrong or is this real
Should I deny the way I feel
Every time I get close to you
Feels like I'm doin' somethin'
I'm not supposed to

Can I want your love
Would it be ok
I wonder what you would say
If I kissed your lips
Would it shock your heart
Or do you want to go that far
Can I want your love

Do I dare cross this line
'Cause girl, my desire might make you mine
This temptation is such a rush
How much of you am I worthy of

Can I want your love
Would it be ok
I wonder what you would say
If I kissed your lips
Would it shock your heart
Or do you want to go that far
Can I want your loveEvery time I get close to you
Feels like I'm doin' something
I'm not supposed to

Can I want your love
Would it be ok
I wonder what you would say
If I kissed your lips
Would it shock your heart
Or do you want to go that far
Can I want your love

Can I want your love
Can I want your love
