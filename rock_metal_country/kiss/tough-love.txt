I wanna take you down, until the morning light
Why don't you come around, and let me treat you right
I'm the one who gave you what you'd never had
You said I should be gentle and be good,
but hoped to hell I would be bad
I wanna take you, baby gonna make you gimme tough love
C'mon and please me, take your time and tease me, gimme tough love
I tie you to the rings, I feel your fever rise
We love to do the things that others fantasize
And then you smile and bring me to my knees
But when I try a gentle lullabye,
I swear I hear you sighing please
I wanna take you, baby gonna make you gimme tough love
C'mon and please me, take your time and tease me,
gimme tough love - tough
I never knew how much I needed you till now
But now I know, and tonight I'm gonna show you how
And then, I smile and bring you to your knees
And though I try a gentle lullabye,
I swear I hear you sighing please
I wanna take you, baby gonna make you gimme tough love
C'mon and please me, take your time and tease me,
gimme tough love - give it to me
Gimme tough love, tough!
