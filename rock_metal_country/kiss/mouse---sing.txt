lyrics

Uh uh uh uh uh uh, sing 
Uh all me people, sing it 
Uh uh uh uh all my ladys, sing it 
Uh uh uh uh everybody, sing it 

Uh yo, yo, ey yo 
Walk with me 
I don't even want you to talk to me 
You can't ignore me 
I want you to comprehend me story 
The plans before me 
My hunger helps my fans support me 
I seperate myself from others when I land in ? 
Show me royalty 
My life now is costly 
Wanna see chips 
Moms and strugglin' with shit 
I'm droppin' these hits 
Got the streets lockin' they lips 
Didn't know the flow was poppin' like this 
Sing this shit it's like... 

Uh, for MTV and BET and some old USC 
The crew that be with me rap ELZ 
And they all real niggers rap easily 
He's with me we here now 
Steam the tree came wild D 
And we got in for free 
You envy me you see 
Everywhere I be the flow got hotter 
Another day another doller sing it 

Uh uh uh uh all my peoples, sing it 
Uh uh uh uh all my ladys, sing it 
Uh uh uh uh everybody, sing it 

Yo, yo I feel I'm ready now 
I got what it takes 
I dig through boxes or loosleaf like DJs 
Dig through crates You see my face 
This hunger that I can't erase 
Is stuck in my brain 
Seems like I can't maintain 
The same damn thing is stressin' me 
Life won't change 
But I know that man upstairs is blessin' me 
You might call fame 
Is like the water that you might call rain 
It gets deeper to the point 
When people notice your name 
The flow is insane 
I'm growin' but I'm blowin' the game 
Niggers is gonna hate me 
But it's a wonderful thing 
I take pride in what I do 
I know you do too 
But you can't get mad 
When someone's better than you 
This letter's for you 
Listen to the words 'til I'm through 
Get a couple of friends and tell them to join too 
This song's for everyone 
Every father, son, mother, daughter 
In midlands on the border, sing it 

Uh uh uh uh all my peoples, sing it 
Uh uh uh uh all my ladys, sing it 
Uh uh uh uh everybody, sing it 

Uh uh uh uh uh yo yo 
Just hear me out I'm not Mouse I'm Jerry now 
We've already found the path to get the math 
I rap now to show the skills I have 
Used to be hoops 
High school I had mad juice 
Couple chicks on my shoulders 
Tryin' to get close 
So mine are now older 
Always been a little red soldier 
The chicks was always like, I thought I told ya 
Right now your baby cute 
In a few years we can do it boo 
I can't wait to holler at you 
Now I know I'm makin' songs can't go wrong 
'Cause my life's positive 
All the time I give 
Is the reason why it's not religion 
Just like the tropic is 
Let me know what the topic is 
There ain't no stoppin' this 
Anything I drop you can rock with it 
Better get a tape and pocket it 
Not in this 'cause there ain't no knock like this 
Don't forget in the game only harder it gets 
When the chorus comes in I wanna hear you sing this shit, sing it it's like 

Uh uh uh uh all my peoples, sing it 
Uh uh uh uh all my ladys, sing it 
Uh uh uh uh everybody, sing it 

Uh uh uh uh uh uh sing 
Uh uh uh uh all my peoples, sing it 
Uh uh uh uh all my ladys, sing it 
Uh uh uh uh everybody, sing it 
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh 
MOUSE talking
