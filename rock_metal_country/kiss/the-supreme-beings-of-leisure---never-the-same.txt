Soft hands my drug
You taste like home to me
Echoing reverberations
I am now remembering
Your kiss is a dream
Elations extreme

One step closer
I am one step closer to heaven
And now I'm never the same
Never the same girl twice

Mysterious chemistry
Someone's cookin in the kitchen
Elixir of the pearl
A luscious berry swirl
I'm losin some sleep
No company I'd rather keep
