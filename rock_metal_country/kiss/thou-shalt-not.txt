I lived most of my life in New York City
Born and raised in the promised land
One day this man in black said,  quot;Listen Jack quot;
Told me I was chosen to kiss the ring on his hand
He said  quot;Kindly reconsider the sins of your past quot;
And I said  quot;Mister you can kindly kiss my ass quot;
 quot;Thou shalt not quot; - but I know what I want -  quot;Thou shalt not quot;
 quot;Thou shalt not quot; - but I know what I need -  quot;Thou shalt not quot;
Well, the son of a bitch must be crazy
Tellin' me I'm gonna go down
I said,  quot;this ain't the inquisition, you ain't the son of God
And I sure as hell don't give a damn quot;
He said,  quot;You're long gone, can't you tell quot;
And I said  quot;Mister, if I'm goin', I'll see you in hell! Yeah! quot;
 quot;Thou shalt not quot; - but I know what I want -  quot;Thou shalt not quot;
 quot;Thou shalt not quot; - but I know what I need -  quot;Thou shalt not quot; - yeah
 quot;Thou shalt not quot; - gotta live my life -  quot;Thou shalt not quot;
 quot;Thou shalt not quot; - any way I please -  quot;Thou shalt not quot;
Don't even try, you know I'd die to be free, oh yeah
And you wonder why, you can't bring this guy to his knees
'Cause I know what I want, yes, I know what I need
Well, I know what I want, I know what I need
Gotta live my life just the way I please, ooh yeah
'Cause I know what I want, yeaaahhhhh!
 quot;Thou shalt not quot;,  quot;Thou shalt not quot;
 quot;Thou shalt not quot;,  quot;Thou shalt not quot;
 quot;Thou shalt not quot; - but I know what I want -  quot;Thou shalt not quot;
 quot;Thou shalt not quot; - oh, yes I do -  quot;Thou shalt not quot;
 quot;Thou shalt not quot; - I'm gonna live my life -  quot;Thou shalt not quot;
 quot;Thou shalt not quot; - any way I choose -  quot;Thou shalt not quot;
You got that right.
