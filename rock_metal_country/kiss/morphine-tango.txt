[ORDERLIES PRISONERS]

Ooh... 
First you take your arm and stick it out 
Then you take a tube you twist about 
Pull it tight until you find a nice blue vein 
And ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Then you take two fingers, pat the skin, 
Try the needle out, then stick it in 
Any second now, you'll feel no pain 
Just ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Not bad, is it? 
Dreams drift by 
Loved ones visit as you lie there... 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, 
Oooooooooooooooooohhhhhh...
