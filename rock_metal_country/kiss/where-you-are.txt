[MOLINA]

When you feel you've gone to hell in a hand basket 
And the world in which you dwell's no paradise 

[AURORA]

I've some counsel I can give 
You need but ask it 
I'm so very glad  to share this good advice 
You've got to learn how not to be 
Where you are 
The more you face reality, the more you scar 
So close your eyes and you'll become a movie star 
Why must you stay where you are? 
You've got to learn how not to see 
What you've seen 
The slice of hell you call your life 
Is harsh and mean 
So why not lie beside me on a movie screen 
Why must you see what you've seen? 
And if you find that you land in jail 
A little fantasy will not fail 
It's just as simple as ABC 
Come up here, play with me, play with me! 
You've got to learn how not to do 
What you've done 
The pistol shot can't kill if you unload the gun 
So build a place where you're the shah 
And we'll embrace in that Shangri-La 
If you run away, some matinee 
From where you are
