[MOLINA]

She wears satin 
Spanish lace 
She feels wild chinchilla 
Brush across her face 
She's lucky, she's a woman... 
She wears diamonds 
Bright as stars 
She has lovers open doors 
To fancy cars 
She's lucky, so lucky, she's a woman... 
A perfume by Lanvin 
To dab across her wrist 
A secret, ribboned diary 
Of all the men she's kissed 
Lilac waters bathe her skin 
At the opera, ushers gasp 
When she sweeps in 
Gifts of chocolate, roses too 
Hand delivered notes 
Confessing "I LOVE YOU!" 
Milky lotions, scented creams 
She's the climax 
Of your Technicolor dreams 
How lucky can you be? 
So lucky, you'll agree 
And I wish that she were me 
That woman...
