[AURORA]

I do miracles 
Though the lash of the whip 
Has caused your flesh to tear 
I will place my lips on you everywhere 
And I'll do miracles 
Blood 
On your slender hips 
Blood 
Underneath your eyes 
Blood 
On your firm young thighs 
Let me kiss it away 
So that i can hear you say 
That I do miracles 
Though your breath racks your ribs 
and you throb with pain 
There's a juice on my lips 
For each purple stain 
And my hair sweeps your chest 
Like the cool, black rain 
You can't explain, though you will see 
I do miracles in me 

[MARTA]

I do miracles 

[AURORA]

I do miracles 

[MARTA]

As I cradle you close and caress each bruise 
What I've come here to give, 
You must not refuse! 

[BOTH]

There is love in my touch that is yours to use 
And if you chose, just breath my name 
And I'll be doing miracles 
I do miracles 
There are miracles in me...
