Damn, there she go 

Over at table eleven 
Across the room from where I'm at 
I see you sittin' with your lover 
Fingers up and down his back 
Somethin' 'bout the way you touched him 
And the way he made you smile 
Tells me this has been goin' on 
For at least a little while 
Baby, and I wanna ask you 
What's goin' on 
And I wanna ask you 
Why you doin' me wrong 
Oh but this ain't the right time to make a scene 
Girl
'Cause I'm out here cheatin' on you girl 
Like you cheatin' on me 
'Cause girl 

CHORUS:
I've been cheatin' on you 
You cheatin' on me, cheatin' on me and you 
And you've been cheatin' on me 
Now what you gonna do, what's it gonna be 
REPEAT 1x 

When you turned around and saw me 
And when your eyes met mine 
We would wish that we were somewhere else 
But we have no place to hide 
Someone told me this could happen, no no 
I would never believe 
Got more chance to be a millionare 
If I play the lottery yeah 
And the guy you be leavin' with is part of a crew 
And the girl that you see me with girl you know 
I do 

CHORUS2x

When I was stickin' out the back with the plain 
You was stickin' out the front with the main 
Baby what goes around, it surely comes back around 
When I was stickin out the back with the plain 
You was stickin' out the front with the main 
Baby what goes around, it's gonna come back around 

CHORUS2 1/2x
