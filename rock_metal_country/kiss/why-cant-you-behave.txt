LOIS LANE:
Why can't you behave?
Oh, why can't you behave?After all the things you told me
And the promises that you gave,
Oh, why can't you behave?
Why can't you be good?
And do just as you should?
Won't you turn that new leaf over
So your baby can be your slave?
Oh, why can't you behave?

There's a farm I know near my old home town,
Where we two can go and try settlin' down.
There I'll care for you forever,
'Cause you're all in the world I grave.
Oh, why can't you behave?
