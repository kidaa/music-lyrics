Saturday morning alone and barely feeling 
Sitting at home after rocking and a-reeling 
All night in a cat fight 
With the only one who can make me cry 

Open the blinds and the world is in rotation 
Shaking my mind like an Etch-a-Sketch erasing 
Sunshine, you were bad, I'm 
Still mad but I can't remember why 

I believe you know me well 
I react like you're ringing a bell 
Are you sorry that you treat me unkind 
Never you mind 

Rolling along to the song that aggravates us 
Beckoned on by the mirage of an oasis 
Hurry, I'm getting blurry 
And it's no longer clear in my mind 

I believe you know me well 
I react like you're ringing a bell 
Are you sorry that you treat me unkind 
Never you mind 

I believe I got you down 
You react like anybody else around 
Are you sorry that we wasted our time 
Never you mind 

Sometimes it takes all my time guessing why I can't figure it out 
Sometimes it takes all my energy just to forget about 
All the memories that I'd be better off without 
I believe you know me well 

Switch on the box Mr. Spock is on the table 
Dr. McCoy is unable to connect his brain 
Sweatin and strainin  
Well it seemed so simple at the time
