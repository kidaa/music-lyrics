Dressing them up 
I love the dressing them up 
The subtle tilt of a hat 
Touches like that 
Makes  me the best of the lot 
At dressing them up 
I was the cream of the crop 
The way I buckled the belt 
Folded the felt 
Helped me to get where I got 
Before I got where I got! 
I was the absolute top 
For example: 
Once I asked for a Balenciaga scarf 
To stuff in a mannequin's purse 
They told me, no one on earth will see! 
I answered, no one on earth but me! 
I stood my ground as no other dresser does 
And darling guess what? Balenciaga, it was! 
Dressing them up, 
I was the creme de la creme 
As I adjusted each hem 
I keep on dazzling them 
At my particular store 
Which was the best in the town 
You'd never catch them wearing a frown 
Or catch them dressing me down 
For my finesse at dressing them up 
Raise that skirt, just an inch or two 
Add some rouge, just a pinch or two 
Start the fan 
No, much gustier 
Stuff that gauze 
Make her bustier 
Ooh! That frock, too much red in it! 
I would not be caught dead in it 
Well, they start out like hell 
But I make them sell by 
Dressing them up 
From earrings down to their boots 
In evening dresses or suits 
Unlike some second rate fruits 
At other second rate stores 
Which can't compare to my own 
You'll never catch them wearin a frown 
Or catch them dressing me down 
For my finesse at dressing them up! 
I had the touch... 
Thank you very much!
