Wanna bite the hand that feeds me, wanna turn the tides 
Set the demons free and watch 'em fly 
Strike down the one who leads me, I'm gonna take his place 
Gonna vindicate the human race 
Better watch out 'cause I'm a war machine 
Better watch out 'cause I'm a war machine 
Take the reins of power and seize them, draw the battle lines 
Armageddon's just a matter of time 
Tear down the voice of reason, let the arrows fly 
Your freedom's just a state of mind, yeah 
Better watch out 'cause I'm a war machine 
You better watch out 'cause I'm a war machine 
You better watch out 'cause I'm a war machine 
You better watch out 'cause I'm a war machine 
Better watch out 'cause I'm a war machine 
I'm a war machine, I'm a war machine
