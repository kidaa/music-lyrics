I feel you in my sleep 
I breathe your breath 
I hear you speak 
All I miss is the sleep 
Your an obsession clouding my mind 
Why don't you make up your mind 
Walk with me 

I'll suggest the place 
Only room for two 
I've been planning all the things 
That I'll do to you 

I'll adore you 
I'll adore you 
I'll adore you 

I step onto the edge 
Jump with me, into the sea 
I have kissed you relentlessly 
I feel your naked skin touching mine 
Why don't you make up your mind 
Walk with me 

I'll caress your skin 
I'll be there for you 
I've been planning all the things 
That I'l do to you 

I'll adore you 
I'll adore you 
I adore you 
REPEAT 1x 

Until you tell me to 
I'll never stop, wanting you 
Feeling you, breathing you 
I have given all of me 
All I need is you 
To adore you 

I'll adore you 
I adore you 
I'll adore you 
I'll adore you 
I adore you
