Dini, dini maak, ghir ana ou yak, dini maak 
Dini, dini biid, dini win, wian ahouek 

Life can be so wierd, so hard and so steep 
You never how, when or why 
And no matter how you try 
It's so hard to say goodbye 
But you gotta say goodbye 

All my life I thought I would heal 
All the pain that I feel 
The pain I feel 
Free me, take me away 
Free me, it's why I say 
Well maybe, yeah honey, dini 

Dini, dini maak, ghir ana ou yak, dini maak 
Dini, dini biid, dini win, wian ahouek 

I'm sick of silly games 
Silly boys like to play 
I look back and have no regrets 
I've been away from home 
I've been on my own 
On my own 

All my life I knew I would feel 
A lovin' that is real 
Are love's so real 
Free me, tell me you love me 
Free me, no take me away 
Well maybe, yeah honey, dini 

Dini, dini maak, ghir ana ou yak, dini maak 
Dini, dini biid, dini win, wian ahouek 

Let's just fly away from here 
To a place of love and peace 
Fly away my dear 
No more hurt and no more tears 
Let's just hide away from here 
Fly away my dear 

Dini, dini maak, ghir ana ou yak, dini maak 
Dini, dini biid, dini win, wian ahouek 
REPEAT 1x
