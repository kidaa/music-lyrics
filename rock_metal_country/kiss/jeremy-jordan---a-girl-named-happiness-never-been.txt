Happiness lights up a room when she smiles  
You can feel her warmth from miles and miles and miles  
Sun shines down on the flowers in her hair  
Sweet radiant beauty fills the air, oh yeah...  

CHORUS: 
I wanna find me that girl  
A girl named happiness  
Till then I've never been kissed  
When I see her you'll know there's nothing to compare  
A girl named happiness  
Meet me there  

With every reason a season gone  
It's never that fast believing that long  
My harem-scream ways just couldn't grasp  
She's the answer to sharpen my past  
I need to purify what my ego won't tame  
Maybe then I'll find a place to that name  
That I know so well, oh yeah..  

CHORUS1: 
I wanna find me that girl Can't get her off my mind  
A girl named happiness She's the one, my everything  
Till then I've never been kissed  
When I see her you'll know there's nothing to compare  
A girl named happiness  
Meet me there  

BRIDGE: 
I don't know when she'll arrive  
I'd be ready at any time...yeah..yeah..yeah...  
The days and nights of waiting have been long  
My only outlet is a song  
May be someday she'll realized who I am  
And then we could walk hand in hand oh yeah..  

Repeat CHORUS 2x  

A girl named happiness  
A girl named happiness  
Meet me there
