Check your weapons at the door
You don't live here anymore
For a heart cannot repent
When it doesn't know it's spent
Its lifetime beating itself to death

There you are still as stone
Stretching skin over bone
Well they say I've lost my will
But I'm just standing still
In a world that swallows cowards
For the crime of killing time

I'll be checking out the scenery
From as high as I can be
Come let faith be your garden
Always changing always still
Still breathing

There you are in my mind
Pale from living underground
Divided and divided
Until no one can be found
Nothing left to break down

I'll be checking out the scenery
From as high as I can be
Come let faith be your garden
Always changing always still
Still breathing
