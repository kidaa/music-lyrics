[PRISONERS]

Where's the woman I call my wife? 
Waiting for me to resume my life? 
Guarding her ass with a kitchen knife? 
Or screwing the janitor 
Over the wall 
Where is the friend in the photograph 
Tender amigo who made me laugh 
Splitting the shit with me, half and half 
Is he taking good care of it? 
Over the wall 

[MOLINA]

So I sit on my coat and my memory whirls 
As I think of the boys dressing up like girls 
Wearing too much mascara and phony pearls 
Over the wall 

[PRISONERS]

Where are the children who bear my name? 
Making a circle to play a game? 
Do they say to the neighbors I'm not to blame? 
Or spit at the thought of me? 
Over the wall 

[VALENTIN]

So I wait in my cell feeling half alive 
Sharing food with a rat, maybe four or five 
While the rats with the power can all survive 
Over the wall 

[VALENTIN AND PRISONERS]

Over the wall 
Over the wall 
Over the wall 
Over the wall 
Over the wall 
Over the wall 
Over the wall 
Over the wall 
Over the wall
