PETRUCHIO:
Were thine that special face?
The face which fills my dreaming,
Were thine the rhythm'd grace,
Were thine the form so lithe and slender, 
Were thine the arms so warm, so tender,
Were thine the kiss divine,
Were thine the love for me,
The love which fills my dreaming,
When all these charms are thine
Then you'll be mine, all mine.

Were thine the love for me,
The love which fills my dreaming,
When all these charms are thine
Then you'll be mine, all mine.
