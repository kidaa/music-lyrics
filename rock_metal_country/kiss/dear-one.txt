[MOTHER]

Dear one 
No, I don't think about you 
Dear one 
I do nicely without you 
Dear one 
Say that over and over 
Keep repeating it as the days go by 

[MARTA]

Dear one
Nothing warm is denied
Dear one
I don't miss you inside me

[MOTHER]

Dear one
Dear one

[MARTA AND MOTHER]

Dear one, say that over and over 
Keep repeating it as the days go by 
And someday you'll believe the lie 

[VALENTIN]

Dear one
I am through
With crusading
Dear one
All my anger is fading

[MARTA]

Dear one

[MOTHER]

Dear one

[VALENTIN AND MARTA]

Dear one, say that over and over 
Keep repeating it as the hours fly 

[MOLINA]

I don't see you crocheting

[MOTHER]

No, I don't think about you
I do nicely without you

You're saying

[MARTA]

Nothing warm is denied me
I don't miss you
Inside me

Keep repeating it
As the hours fly

The lie...
