I was thinking what I'd say  
For I found out when you left me  
It's the something I think everyday  
That I long for to tell the story  

I was wondering my love  
Our love is something special  
Here I found you could stay  
Today isn't the same  

As if you said nothing  
Nothing at all  
As if you said nothing  

All the time you knew  
I tried to be good  
To do the right things  
You can help me find my way  

Je repense  ce que tu disais 
 ce moment o' tu m'a quitte 
 ce n'est pas quelque chose auquel je pense chaque jour 
 j'aimerais te redire l'histoire.. 

Translation : 
I remember what you said 
The time you left me 
I don't think of it each day 
I'd like to tell you the story again  

As if you said nothing  
Nothing at all  
As if you said nothing  
Nothing at all  
As if you said nothing  
Nothing at all  
As if you said nothing  
Nothing at all  
As if you said nothing  
Nothing at all  
As if you said...
