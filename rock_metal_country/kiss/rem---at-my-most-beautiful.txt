i've found a way to make you  
i've found a way  
a way to make you smile  

i read bad poetry  
into your machine  
i save your messages  
just to hear your voice.  
you always listen carefully  
to awkwards rhymes.  
you always say your name.  
like i woulden't know it's you,  
at your most beautiful.  

i've found a way to make you  
i've found a way  
a way to make you smile  

at my most beautiful  
i count your eyelashes secretly.  
with every one, whisper i love you.  
i let you sleep.  
i know you're closed eye watching me, 
listening. 
i thought i saw a smile.  

i've found a way to make you  
i've found a way  
a way to make you smile
