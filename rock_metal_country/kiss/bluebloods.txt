[MOLINA]

Do you know why they call royalty bluebloods? 
Well, I do! 
They call royalty bluebloods 
Because their skin was so thin 
That their veins showed through, blue! 
There, that's something I've taught you 
No need to thank me! 

[VALENTIN]

Go to hell! 

[MOLINA]

Any more that you ever thanked me 
For nursing you through those first few days 
When they first threw you in here 
Remember that? 
Valentin, meet Molina, the resident queen! 
Well, I suppose some people are always 
The ungrateful kind, like you, 
To name a few! 
You, you, you, you, you! 

[VALENTIN]

Will you please shut up! 
Will you ever shut up? 
Can't you leave me alone? 
There's a side of this cell 
That's your own, with it's own space 
It's own air...Stay there!
