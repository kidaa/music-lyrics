NERD:
Dirty dog, uh I'ma I'ma dirty dog   
Uh I'ma dirty dog, uh I'ma I'ma dirty dog   
Uh dirty dog, uh I'ma I'ma dirty dog   
Dirty dog   

I'm an outlaw, quick on the draw   
Somethin' you never seen before   
And I dare a motherfucker to come in my face   
I got somethin' chrome, and I got it from home   
And it ain't a microphone   
And I dare a motherfucker to come in my face   
It's so real, how I feel   
It's just society that makes a nigger wanna kill   
I'm just straight ill,   
Ridin' my motorcycle down the streets   
My politicians, they sounded like strippers to me   
They sayin' but I don't wanna hear it   

VITA:
Ooh baby you want me   
Ooh baby you want me   
Ooh baby you want me   
Now you could get this lapdance here for free   
Now you could get this lapdance here for free   
Now you could get this lapdance here for free   
Ooh baby you want me   
Now you could get this lapdance here for free   

NERD:
It's a raw night, who wants to bar fight   
Ya'll come on, alright   
But I dare a motherfucker to come in my face   
Baseball bats, I got somethin' for that   
It goes blac-cac-cac-cat   
So I dare a motherfucker to come in my face   
It's so real, how I feel   
It's just society that makes a nigger wanna kill   
I'm just straight ill,   
Ridin' my motorcycle down the streets   
While the government, they sounded like strippers to me   
They keep sayin' but I don't wanna hear it   

VITA:
Ooh baby you want me   
Ooh baby you want me   
Ooh baby you want me   
Now you could get this lapdance here for free   
Now you could get this lapdance here for free   
Now you could get this lapdance here for free   
Ooh baby you want me   
Now you could get this lapdance here for free   

LEE HARVEY:   
When you think of Harvey, think of a Harley   
Built denim, spiked wrists and ?   
Slap ? and tattoos that's all me   
Two blondes, footballs, spinnin' like quansie   
You can find me drunk, whippin' and might crash   
Or find me chillin' with crack-heads who like thrash   
Find me in court, smokin' that nice grass   
Burnin' the flag all in the name of white trash   
It's Harvey baby, Christ on the arm   
I'm narley baby, fuckin' me now Harley baby   
And you know the flow ungarley baby   
So let's part baby   
Chicks nickname me Potter   
They get high on my dick   
Take 'em to my home, they call it the cockpit   
Time to take off them panties, they drop quick   
Not that's first-class fuckin'   
Ain't that some fly shit   

VITA:
Ooh baby you want me   
Ooh baby you want me   
Ooh baby you want me   
Now you could get this lapdance here for free   
Now you could get this lapdance here for free  Now you could get this lapdance here for free   
Ooh baby you want me   
Now you could get this lapdance here for free
