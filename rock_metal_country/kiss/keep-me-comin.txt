I know what you're like, you're not sleepin' at night 
I know you're losing control, I know your plans 
Where you're keeping your hands, I know it's taking its toll 
Sweet little innocent girl, making your way in this world 
Something you're feeling tonight tells you 
what's wrong and what's right 
You gotta keep me comin' keep me comin', 
keep me comin' keep me comin' 
You gotta keep me comin' keep me comin',
keep me comin' babe keep me comin' 
Hands on my shoulders now, you're getting bolder,
your fears are slipping away 
Each little bite lets me know that you're ripe, 
you're thinking maybe you'll stay 
Now that you're burning to know, how far you're willing to go 
Now that it's under your skin, now that you're lettin' me in 
You gotta keep me comin' keep me comin',
keep me comin' keep me comin' 
You gotta keep me comin' keep me comin',
keep me comin' babe keep me comin' 
You gotta keep me comin' keep me comin',
keep me comin' keep me comin' 
You gotta keep me comin' keep me comin',
keep me comin' babe keep me comin' 
Ooh yeah, comin', comin' 
Ooh yeah, right here, right now 
You gotta keep me comin' keep me comin',
keep me comin' keep me comin' 
You gotta keep me comin' keep me comin',
keep me comin' babe keep me comin'
