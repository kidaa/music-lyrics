[VALENTIN]

Will you please shut up 
Will you ever shut up? 
"Thank you very much!" 
You're making me sick 
With that prissy whine 
Watch me now, I draw a line 
So you stick to your side 
And I'll stick to mine 
Never, ever cross this line! 

[MOLINA]

Fine! But the pot, 
How about the pot? 

[VALENTIN]

What about the pot? 

[MOLINA]

It's on your side 

[VALENTIN]

So what? 

[MOLINA]

So when I have to use the pot 
I intend to use the pot 

[VALENTIN]

So what, that's an exception 

[MOLINA]

Oh, Gracious one, thanks a lot! 

[VALENTIN]

So don't ever try to be 
Don't ever dream you'll be 
Don't dare to think that you'll 
Ever be some fairy friend of mine 
Cause no, no, no, no, no! 
That's where I draw the line 

[MOLINA]

Fine! 

[VALENTIN]

I draw the line 

[MOLINA]

Fine! 

[VALENTIN]

I draw the line 

[MOLINA]

Fine!
