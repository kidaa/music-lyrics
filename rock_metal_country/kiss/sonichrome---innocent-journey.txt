love is an innocent, innocent journey 
love is a cancer, love ain't benign 
love is what keeps you going all the time now 
love it, don't leave it, don't leave it behind 

love is for free 
people like me 
crossing the seas, looking for that someone 
love is for free 
when people like me  
set their sights on you 
i'll know what to do 
love is what i came for 
love is what's in store for 

love is an innocent, innocent journey 
love is a cancer, love ain't benign 
love is what keeps me going all the time now 
love it, don't leave it, don't leave it behind 

love is for free 
people like me 
just crossing the seas looking for that special someone 
love is for free 
i've got eyes to see 
looking for someone 
love could come along 
love is what your waiting for  
love is what you came for 

love is an innocent, innocent journey 
love is a cancer, love ain't benign 
love is what keeps you going all the time now 
love it, don't leave it, don't leave it be 
love it, don't leave it, don't leave it be 
love it, don't leave it, don't leave it behind
