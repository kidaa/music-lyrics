Mmm, mm, mm, m, mmm 
Do do do do, do do do do 

Don't you blame it on I 
Don't you blame it on I and I 
Don't you blame it on I, I tell ya 
Don't you blame it on rise therefore right 
For when a guy ? a bank all day 
They blame it on I and I, now 
For when a wolf kill a guy all day 
They blame it on rise therefore right 

Anything they eat and do 
I and Ia get a play 
Anything they eat and do 
I and Ia get a play 
Yeay-e-yeay, whoa-oo-whoa yeah 

Don't yoy blame it on I, I tell ya 
Don't you blame it on I and I, yeah 
Don't you blame it on I, I tell ya 
Don't you blame it on rise therefore right 
Whoa-oh-ho-oh
Mm-m-m-hm-hmm-mmm-m
Hm-hm-hm-hm
Mm-hm-m-m-mm

Don't you blame it on I, I tell ya 
Don't you blame it on I and I, no 
Don't you blame it on I, I tell ya 
Don't you blame it on rise therefore right 
For if a guy ? a bank all day 
They blame it on I and I, now 
And when a wolf kill a guy all day 
They blame it on rise therefore right 

Don't you blame it on I, I tell ya 
Don't blame it on I and I, no 
Don't blame it on I, I tell ya 
Don't you blame it on rise therfore right 
Don't blame it on I 
Don't you blame it on I and I 
Don't blame it on I 
Don't you blame it on rise therefore right 

Everything they do I got the blame 
I got the blame 
Od-do-want-de-do
Od-do-want-de-do
