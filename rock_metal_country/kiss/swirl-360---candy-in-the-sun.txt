Going on a fieldtrip just like school 
Gonna go somewhere that's really cool 
Destination: Vacation traveling around 
the nation 

Hey-The time is now to start the show 
Hey-Rev it up and let it go 

Cos I know a place where the sun is always shining 
And I won't forget the face 
The one that's gonna keep me smiling 
You're like candy in the sun 
You're my angel on the run 
You're like candy in the sun 
Hey Hey Hey 

Speedin' down the highway 
With the top down 
We're gonna get out of this one way town 
Kick it into motion 
Got a notion 
We're gonna drive all the way to the ocean, yeah 
Hey-Rev it up and let it go 
Hey-Crankin' up the radio 

Chorus

It's time to take a chance 
You know it's true 
Come on let's break away 
Just me and you 

Cos I know a place where the sun is always shining 
And I won't forget the face the one 
That's gonna keep me smiling 
You're like candy in the sun 
You're like candy in the sun 
You're like candy in the sun 

Cos I know a place where the sun is always shining 
I know a place 
And I won't forget the face the one 
And I won't forget the face 
That's gonna keep me smiling 
You're like candy in the sun 
You're like candy in the sun 
You're like candy in the sun 
Everyday
Hey, Hey, Hey
