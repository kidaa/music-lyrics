Hey..
What did you hear me say? 
You know the difference it makes 
What did you hear me say? 
Yes,I said it's fine before 
But I don't think so no more 
I said it's fine before 

I've changed my mind 
I take it back 
Erase and rewind 
'Cause I've been changing my mind 
Erase and rewind 
'Cause I've been changing my mind 
I've changed my mind 

So...
Where did you see me go? 
It's not the right way, you know 
Where did you see me go? 
No...
It's not the light, oh no 
I just don't want it to grow 
It's not the light, oh no 

I've changed my mind 
I take it back 
Erase and rewind 
'Cause I've been changing my mind 
Erase and rewind 
'Cause I've been changing my mind 
I've changed my mind 

Erase and rewind 
'Cause I've been changing my mind 
Erase and rewind 
'Cause I've been changing my mind 
Erase and rewind 
I've changed my mind... 

I've changed my mind...  
I've changed my mind...  
I've changed my mind...  
I've changed my mind...  
I've changed my mind...  

I've changed my mind...
