People say I'm crazy, doing what I'm doing 
Well, they give me all kinds of warning to save me from ruin 
When I say that I'm okay 
Well, they look at me kind of strange 
Surely you're not happy now 
You no longer play the game 

People say I'm lazy, dreaming my life away 
Well, they give me all kinds of advice designed to enlighten me 
When I tell them that I'm doing fine 
Watching shadows on the wall 
Don't you miss the big time, boy 
You're no longer on the ball 

I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round 
I really love to watch them roll 
No longer riding on the merry go round 
I just had to let it go 

Ah, people asking questions, lost in confusion 
Well, I tell them there's no problem, only solutions 
Well, they shake their heads and look at me 
As if I lost my mind 
I tell them there's no hurry 
I'm just sitting here doing time 

I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round 
I really love to watch them roll 
No longer riding on the merry go round 
I just had to let it go 
I just had to let it go 
I just had to let it go
