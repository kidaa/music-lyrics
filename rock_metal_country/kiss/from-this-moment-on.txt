BIANCA, LUCENTIO, GREMIO & HORTENSIO:
From this moment on,
You for me, dear,
Only two for tea, dear,
From this moment on.
From this happy day,
No more blue songs.
Only whoop-dee-doo songs,
From this moment on.
For you've got the love I need so much,
Got the skin I love to touch,
Got the arms to hold me tight,
Got the sweet lips to kiss me good night.
From this moment on,
You and I, babe,
We'll be ridin' high, babe,
Ev'ry care is gone
From this moment on.
