You tell me that you're leaving, and I'm trying to understand 
I had myself believing I should take it like a man 
But if you gotta go, then you gotta know that it's killing me 
And all the things I never seem to show, I gotta make you see 
Girl it's been so long, tell me how could it be 
One of us knows the two of us don't belong in each others company 
It hurts so much inside, your telling me goodbye, you wanna be free 
And knowin' that you're gone and leavin' me behind 
I gotta make you see, I gotta make you see, I gotta make you see 
I still love you, I still love you 
I really, I really love you, I still love you 
People tell me I should win at any cost 
But now I see as the smoke clears away, the battle has been lost 
I see it in your eyes, you never have to lie, I'm out of your life 
Tonight I'll dream away and you can still be mine 
But I'm dreamin' a lie, dreamin' a lie, makes me wanna die 
'Cause I still love you, I still love you 
Baby, baby I love you, I still love you 
And when I think of all the things you'll never know 
There's so much left to say 
'Cos girl, now I see the price of losing you will be my hell to pay 
My half to pay, each and every day, hear what I say 
I still love you, I still love you 
I really, I really love you, I still love you 
Baby, baby, I love you, I love you, I really, I really love you
