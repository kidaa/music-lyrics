BILL:
Why can't you behave?
Why can't you behave?
LOIS:
Tell me how can you be jealous
When you know, baby, I'm your slave?
I'm just mad for you,
And I'll always be, 
But naturally

If a custom-tailored vet
Asks me out for something wet,
When the vet begins to pet, I cry "Hooray!"
But I'm always true to you, darlin', in my fashion,
Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin', in my way.
BILL:
There's a lush from Baltimore,
Who is rich but such a bore,
LOIS:
When the bore fall on the floor, I let him lay.
But I'm always true to you, darlin', in my fashion,
Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin', in my way.
BILL:
What about that Mister Thorne
Calls you up from night 'til morn?
LOIS:
Mister Thorne once cornered corn and that ain't hay.
Aha!
But I'm always true to you, darlin', in my fashion,
Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin', in my way.
BILL:
So you're out with Mister Fritz
You were dining at the Ritz,
LOIS:
Mister Fritz is full of Schlitz and Schlitz must pay.
But I'm always true to you, darlin', in my fashion,
Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin', in my way.
I could never curl my lip
At a dazzlin' diamond clip,
BILL:
S'pose the clip meant "let 'er rip,"
LOIS:
I'd not say "Nay!"
BILL:
But you're always true to me, darlin', in your fashion!
LOIS:
Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin', in my way.
BILL:
Mister Harris, plutocrat,
Wants to give your cheek a pat,
LOIS:
If the Harris pat
Means a Paris hat,
Bb, Oo-la-la!
Mais je suis toujour fidle, darlin', in my fashion,
Oui, je suis toujour fidle, darlin', in my way.
Mister Gable,
BILL:
You mean Clark?
LOIS:
Wants me on his boat to park,
If the gable boat
Means a sable coat,
BILL:
I know,
Anchors aweigh!
LOIS:
But I'm always true to you, darlin', in my fashion,
Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin', in my way.
