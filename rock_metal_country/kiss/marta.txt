[VALENTIN]

There's a cobblestone street 
And a little red door 
And three flights up is Marta 
Waiting there is Marta 

[PRISONERS]

Over the wall
Over the wall 

[VALENTIN]

And I still can see us lying together 
Talking, smoking, lying together 
Helps me through 
So I close my eyes 
And I hear her step 
And I know she's come to hold me 
So, my senses stir 

[PRISONERS]

Over the wall 

[VALENTIN]

But it's never ever her 
It's just a dream of her 

[PRISONERS]

Over the wall 
Over the wall 
Over the wall 

[VALENTIN]

So I close my eyes 
And I hear her step 
And I know she's come to hold me 
So, my senses stir 

[PRISONERS]

Over the wall 
Over the wall 

[VALENTIN]

But it's never ever her 
It's just a dream of her 

[PRISONERS]

And I wonder 
If I'll ever see them again
