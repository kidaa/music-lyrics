PETRUCHIO:
I've come to wive it wealthily in Padua,
If wealthily then happily in Padua.
If my wife has a bag of gold,
Do I care if the bag be old?
I've come to wive it wealthily in Padua.

ENSEMBLE:
He's come to wive it wealthily in Padua.

PETRUCHIO:
I heard you mutter, "Zounds, a loathsome lad you are."
I shall not be disturbed one bit
If she be but a quarter-wit,
If she only can talk of clo'es
While she powders her goddamned nose,
I've come to wive it wealthily in Padua.

ENSEMBLE:
He's come to wive it wealthily in Padua.

PETRUCHIO:
I heard you say, "Gadzooks, completely mad you are!"
'Twouldn't give me the slightest shock
If her knees now and then should knock,
If her eye were a wee bit crossed,
Were she wearing the hair she'd lost,
Still the damsel I'll make my dame,
In the dark they are all the same,
I've come to wive it wealthily in Padua.

ENSEMBLE:
He's come to wive it wealthily in Padua.

PETRUCHIO:
I heard you say, "Good gad, but what a cad you are!"
Do I mind if she fret and fuss,
If she fume like Vesuvius,
If she roar like a winter breeze
On the rough Adriatic seas,
If she screams like a teething brat,
If she scratch like a tiger cat,
If she fight like a raging boar,
I have oft stuck a pig before,
I've come to wive it wealthily in Padua.

ENSEMBLE:
With a hunny, nunny, nunny,
And a hey, hey, hey,

PETRUCHIO:
Not to mention money, money
For a rainy day,

PETRUCHIO & ENSEMBLE:
I He's come to wive it wealthily in Padua.
