Thanks to  Julie James for submitting the lyrics 

This is a man 
Who needs a woman 
I'm not afraid to say what I feel 
I'll never ne unfaithful 
I've been wrong and lived the lonely nights 
Silence is loud 
Without her whispers 
My body craves her touch 
Such are my prayers 
Every break of dawn 
To open my eyes 
And see her by my side 
Take it 
When the earth shakes 
And the tide breaks 
Feels like a woman 
So much power takes my breath away 
When the sun beats 
Satin blue sheets 
Feels like a woman 
So much power takes my breath away 
When the sun beats 
Satin blue sheets 
Feels like a woman 
I am sweating, begging her to stay with me 
This is a man 
Who needs a woman 
In all of my world and my nights 
If I don't live up to this promise 
Then I'm wrong, I have no right 
Take it 
When the earth shakes 
And the tide breaks 
Feels like a woman 
So much power takes my breath away 
When the sun beats 
Satin blue sheets 
Feels like a woman 
So much power takes my breath away 
When the earth shakes 
And the tide breaks 
Feels like a woman 
So much power takes my breath away 
When the sun beats 
Satin blue sheets 
Feels like a woman 
So much power takes my breath away 
This is a man 
Who needs a woman 
I'm not afraid to say what I feel 
I'll never be unfaithful 
And I've been wrong, but not tonight
