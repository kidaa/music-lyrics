I just hate when the girl says wait
I really want her by my side
Don't hesitate
I really want her by my side
The whole night through
We do all the things that we wanna do
Well, come on baby, don't leave me sad
'Cause you're good lookin', the best I've had
Makin' love makin' love, makin' love makin' love
Makin' love makin' love all night long
Makin' love makin' love, makin' love makin' love
Makin' love makin' love all night long
Ow, all night long
Red light, green light, don't say  quot;No quot;
I really want her, she says
 quot;Stop, baby quot; go, go, go
I really want her by my side
The whole night through
We do all the things that we wanna do
Well, come on baby, don't leave me sad
'Cause you're good lookin', the best I've had
Makin' love makin' love, makin' love makin' love
Makin' love makin' love all night long
Makin' love makin' love, makin' love makin' love
Makin' love makin' love all night
Whoo
Makin' love makin' love, makin' love makin' love
Makin' love makin' love all night long
Makin' love makin' love, makin' love makin' love
Makin' love makin' love all night long
Makin' love makin' love, makin' love makin' love
Makin' love makin' love all night long
Makin' love makin' love, makin' love makin' love
Makin' love makin' love all night, oh
