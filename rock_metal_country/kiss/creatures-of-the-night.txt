Searching in the darkness, running from the day 
Hiding from tomorrow, nothing left to say 
Victims of the moment, future deep in doubt 
Living in a whisper till we start to shout 
We're creatures of the night, we're creatures of the night 
Breathing in the madness, spitting out the lies 
Searching for an answer, keep your alibis 
Don't know where we're goin', just know where we've been 
Remember when the clock strikes twelve, the losers always win 
We're creatures of the night, we're creatures of the night 
Searching in the darkness, running from the day 
Hiding from tomorrow, nothing left to say 
Gathering up our courage, ready for the fight 
Howling in the shadows, till we start to bite 
We're creatures of the night, we're creatures of the night 
We're creatures of the night, we're creatures of the night
