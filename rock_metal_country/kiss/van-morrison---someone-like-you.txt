Thanks to  Julie James for submitting the lyrics 

I've been searching a long time 
For someone exactly like you 
I've been travelling all around the world 
Waiting for you to come through. 
Someone like you makes it 
All worth while 
Someone like you keeps 
Me satisfied. Someone exactly 
Like you. 
I've been travellin' a hard road 
Lookin' for someone exactly like you 
I've been carryin' my heavy load 
Waiting for the light to come 
Shining through. 
Someone like you makes it 
All worth while 
Someone like you keeps 
Me satisfied. Someone exactly 
Like you. 

I've been doin' some soul searching 
To find out where you're at 
I've been up and down the highway 
In all kinds of foreign lands 
Someone like you... etc. 

I've been all around the world 
Marching to the beat of a different 
Drum.
But just lately I have 
Realised
The best is yet to come. 
Someone like you... etc.
