Put your hand in my pocket
Grab onto my rocket
Feels so good to see you receive
Baby got to know
Do do you want to go
How you gonna make me feel
I said  quot;Go baby, you make me feel ah, ah, ah, ah yeah
Oh, baby, you make me feel ah, ah, ah, ah yeah quot;
So take me any way you want me
Just break me any way you can
Take me any way you want me, now
Make me feel like a man, yeah
Sittin' in the back
Her head down in my lap
The moonlight shinin' down on her hair
The radio was playin'
Her fingertips were strayin'
Her mama didn't she was there, no
She said  quot;Oh baby, you make me feel ah, ah, ah, ah yeah
Oh, baby, you make me feel ah, ah, ah, ah yeah quot;
