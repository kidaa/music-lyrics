Thanks to  Jessica for submitting the  
lyrics

Now everybody put your middle fingers in the air  
And repeat after me:  

Now fuck that  
I'm tired of bitches riffin' and trippin'  
Now fuck that  
You owe a nigger 'cause he went to prision  
Now fuck that  
You ain't givin' head, mom in and beat it  
Oh you a saint now but you pushin' me to eat it  

Now fuck that  
All of sudden Harlem ain't real, like we end all for money and we started pushin' grills  
Now fuck that  
Everybody singin' this and that  
Like bad for that nigger that be spittin' on them tracks  
Like motion record labels, who came at me with offers  
Like eight fuckin' albums and shorty's just a ?  

Now fuck that  
Thank bad bitches from when you holler  
Like you ain't in the fire but you walkin' right beside her  
Now fuck that  
Ma I don't let them front when you dared  
And them pay to get they number with they fingers in your hair  

Now fuck that  
Bitches with babies actin' for dollers  
Smokin high they kicks is proud of  
But don't know the baby father and  
Shorty run around with Gucci on her feet with a GAP outfit  
Like that shit is really sweet  

Now fuck that  
Niggers who charge for thing that's shitty  
Now fuck that  
Wack ass albums nigger come get me  
Now fuck that  
That's the hottest dog who fuckin' with me  
Not that nigger in your box  
You really think that nigger hot  

Now fuck that  
Some say that kid ain't nice,  
'Cause that song too hot,no that kid didn't write  
Like I don't go right  
Like I don't flow tight  
You know that nigger they just figure that he won't go life  

Now fuck that  
None of them broads who came at me wrong  
Like ooh you look young but don't know that I'm grown  
Now fuck that  
This is for my teens on the block  
Push green ? I rock  
Six teens in them glocks  

Now fuck that  
Bitch ass cops with head triggers  
Now fuck that  
Protect shit that air niggers  
Just a bunch of hate crimes like rape and luema  
And murder in the alleys  
Spittin' slugs from ?  
And they feel it's ok when they set up OJ  
But they wana bag G and Puff and throw the key away  

Now fuck that  
Hollywood rappers who never sold that  
If they jewelry last week is was gone  
Now fuck that  
Bring back them 4.0's  
Everybody ain't rich to go out on a 6  

Now fuck that  
That's right you only live once  
Fuckin' spin how you wanna go, trick on them stunts  
If you do a little exol, hit a few blunts  
Get high, get crunk, have fun, get drunk  

Now fuck that  
Niggers who come at you with tapes  
Like it's easy 'cause you sign and they won't have to wait  
Now fuck that  
Hearin' out every beat, wait  
When you find what you like, shit it ain't on the tape  

Now fuck that  
Look dogs I'm gone eat gray  
Fuck a feature they don't wanna  
Shit is hot any way any day  
We can battle dog verse for verse  
Fuck will I'm gone curse  
As matter fact you fuckin' jerk  

Now fuck that  

And shorty if you gonna get the Gucci shoes  
Get the Gucci outfit to match  
GAP don't match with that shit ma  
Ya heard  
He, Harlem is back  
Expect it and respect it nigger  
Yo Duro you got anything to say  

Now fuck that
