Stand up, you don't have to be afraid, 
get down - love is like a hurricane 
Street boy, no I never could be tamed, better believe it 
Guilty 'til I'm proven innocent, whiplash, heavy metal accident 
Rock on, I wanna be President, 'cos 
I love it loud, I wanna hear it loud, right between the eyes 
Loud, I wanna hear it loud, I don't want to compromise 
Turn it up, hungry for the medicine, two fisted to the very end 
No more treated like aliens, we're not gonna take it 
No lies, no more alibis, turn it up, it's got me hypnotized 
Rock on, I won't be tranquilized, 'cos 
I love it loud, I wanna hear it loud, right between the eyes 
Loud, I wanna hear it loud, I don't want to compromise
I love it loud, I wanna hear it loud, right between the eyes 
Loud, I wanna hear it loud, I don't want to compromise 
Headlines jungle is the only rule, front page roar of the nation cool 
Turn it up, this is my attitude, take it or leave it 
I love it loud, I wanna hear it loud, right between the eyes 
Loud, I wanna hear it loud, I don't want to compromise
