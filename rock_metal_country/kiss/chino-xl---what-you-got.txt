Y'all coward niggaz make a nigga like me laugh, 
what the fuck? yea, yea.. chargin y'all niggaz 
yea, yea.. behold the only thing greater than yourself 

Verse 1 
I'll slash ya grill, don't start me 
You'll be the only entertainer with less groupies than Biz Markie 
I'm never dull, Chino the pretty thug, style centerfold, 
I'll have every latin in the country aimin at ya skull 
I'll aim it at the ? who claim he sellin the most dope 
My Jersey blocks is locked tighter than prisoners hold soap 
And listeners where we vote out ya CD and vinyl, the final result 
Yell, fuck tricks and smoke, till our vocals combine with a Colt 
They playin this in every club, whip, party and bar you in 
Give you more blood clots than two jamaicans arguin 
Sweat till ya fake silver platinum chains is tarnishin 
Women shakin they ovaries, look what we accomplishin, what.. 

Chorus
We got better lyrics than you got "What You Got?" 
We got better bitches than you got "What You Got?" 
We run with more killas than you got "What You Got?" 
We got better whips than you got "What You Got?" 
We got better cribs than you got "What You Got?" 
We got better bitches than you got "What You Got?" 
We run with more killas than you got "What You Got?" 
We got better lyrics than you got "What You Got?" 

Verse 2 
Coming to kill me, I cant hear that 
Fear is a stimulus I haven't been programmed to feel yet 
Snatch you outta your Roots like I'm from Illadelph 
What I do to push your hairline back, Rogaine wont help 
My Quest for the Wealth, like Stone Cold Austin's quest for the belt 
I mention myself as a celestial cell, an extension of hell 
At a lynching I smile, cut myself down, murder your guest list 
My style murders an drags like they do black men in Texas 
Next rapper to mention this, I'ma show them the real threat 
Cause I'ma ride till my daughters like "Daddy are we there yet?" 
Ain't no priest in the streets, only drugs before miracles 

Seen more keys than the lots seen Hammers repossessed vehicles 
Told you I was coming, you ain't believe I'm assumin 
If we all super heroes, these bitch niggaz must be Wonder Women 
Fist to fist, skin to skin, I make you fall flat 
Brat little niggaz, the tat on my shoulder cover they whole back 
Cant hold back, splatter they whole rap to match my ? 
Shittin on MC's, wipin my ass on they notebooks 
How the broke crooks in videos leave me stressed 
I'll turn on channel 2 if I wanna CBS, bitch 

Chorus w/ slight variation 

Verse 3 
Least but not last, I'll blast an informant 
Until he has the cash to put end to his torment 
Now shine up the brass for his coffin 
I've mastered the ?, through passion and torment 
I've mastered the forces, I rap to the chorus, 
My cast is enormous, I'm fast and I'm cautious 
Twenty inch arms stronger than forklifts 
Smoke hash in front of reporters till I choke and they nauseous 
And smash through the glass of your Porsche's 
Show you how north is hard as Divorces 
Lay you out dead in the grass on the forest 
My rap is flawless, have ya flesh wrapped in a blackened sausage 
Blood Splashed across it for rhymin like a fag in a cordless 
Murder all witnesses, nosey, standing on porches, 
Like torches, super human, Chino's skin never scorches 
Drape your family reunion in black funeral mourners 
Have cats that sell ya drugs for you, avoid usual corners 
I never lost, there's mad lust to be Rap carassa's 
Breakin companies, Jersey got women strapped inside they office 
I got.. DJ Supporters and women makin sex offers 
I got.. A crib like a fortress, tuition for all my daughters 
I got.. Rhymes hot like sauna's, and thousands from Time Warner 
I got.. Killas on every corner, surrounded by jewish lawyers 
What what what..
