Life, a movie in my head 
A page of lines we read
The words remain unsaid 

Time, a race you never win 
Look back at where we've been
And throw the towel in

Every time I see a sign 
Tell me what's the bottom line
Tell me
I just wanna take my turn
Now before I crash and burn
Yeah

Hope, a candle burning bright
A temporary light
'Till we return to night
Love, the mighty drug we crave
The master and the slave
Will rule us to our grave

Everytime I see a sign
Tell me what's the bottom line
Tell me
I just want a place to rest
Count to four and catch my breath
One, Two, Three, Four

I don't know what to feel
Don't know what to say
Don't know what to do 

I don't know where to go
Don't know who to be
Don't know who to know

Life is never what it seems
It shakes you from your dreams
Wake up and start to....

Everytime I see a sign
Tell me what's the bottom line 
Tell me
I just want a place to rest
Stop and let me catch my breath
Everytime I see a sign
Tell me what's the bottom line
Tell me
Forget all that I've been told
I just wanna lose control
Everytime I see a sign
Tell me what's the bottom line
Tell me
I just wanna take my turn
Now before I crash and burn
