[PRISONERS]
There are big busted woman 
Over the wall 
Over the wall 
There are big busted woman 
Who bake on the beaches 
With oil on their bellies 
Over the wall 
Over the wall 
There is rum from the cane fields 
Over the wall 
Over the wall 
There is sun on my taxi 
And cakes in my oven 
And fish in my netting 
And grease in my barnyard 
And big busted woman 
Over the wall 
Over the wall 
Over the wall 
And I wonder if I'll ever see them again 

[SPIDER WOMAN]
And the moon grows dimmer 
At the tides low ebb 
And your breath comes faster 
And you're aching to move 
But you're caught in the web...
