[VALENTIN]

It was made out of mud 
And pieces of tin 
And boxes nailed together 
Cardboard boxes 
My castle 
My home 
And we slept on the floor 
My sister and I 
With gunny sacks for our pillows 
Coughing, hungry, cosy 
My home 
And every Sunday on our knees 
We would thank the Lord 
For his bountiful blessings 
And our mother poured soup 
Into little cracked bowls 
As she spoke of something better 
Beef steak, maybe, someday 
My home 
And that lady had eyes 
That were empty and cold 
At the ripe old age of thirty 
Death came 
Welcome 
To my home 
And still that Sunday 
On our knees 
How we thanked the Lord 
For his bountiful blessings 
And my sister and I 
Swore the day that we left 
There'd be no more children like us 
In the filth there in the heat there. 
In the smell there 
And no more Sundays 
On our knees 
Would we thank the Lord 
For his bountiful blessings 
And we came to the city 
And begged for our food 
Then, one April day we heard it 
Thunder rumbling 
One man speaking 
Thousands singing .. 
Someday we'll be free 
I promise you, we'll be free 
If not tomorrow 
Then the day after that 
And the candles in our hands 
Will illuminate this land 
If not tomorrow 
Then the day after that 
And the world that gives us pain 
That fills our lives with fear 
On the day after that 
Will disappear 
And the war we've fought to win 
I promise you, we will win 
If not tomorrow 
Then the day after that 
Or the day after that 

[VALENTIN]

and families of the disappeared 
Someday we'll be free 
I promise you, we'll be free 
If not tomorrow 
Then Or the day after that 
And the candles in our hands 
Will illuminate this land 
If not tomorrow 
Then the day after that 
And the world that gives us pain 
That fills our lives with fear 
On the day after that 
Will disappear 
Will disappear 
And the war we've fought to win 
I promise you, we will win 
If not tomorrow 
Then the day after that 
Or the day after that 
Or the day after that 
Or the day after that 
Or the day after that 
Or the day 
After that!
