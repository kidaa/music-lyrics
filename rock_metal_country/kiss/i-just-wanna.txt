I got a body built for sin and an appetite for passion
Yeah I can see the road to ruin and I'm lookin' for some action
I got my finger on the trigger and a match to the fuse
I'll make someone an offer that's too big to refuse
Tired of tryin' to be what I'll never be, baby,
you could never see that
I don't want a romance, I don't wanna dance, I just wanna forget you
Time to take my chances, find somebody new
I just wanna for, I just wanna for, I just wanna forget you
I'm gonna set the night on fire, shootin' like a Roman Candle
Ooh yeah, I'm burnin' with desire and I'm much too hot to handle
I'm like a runaway, crazy train, I'm out of control
If you try to put the brakes on, I'm still gonna roll
Tired of tryin' to do what you want me to, baby,
I'm just tired of you, yeah
I don't want a romance, I don't wanna dance, I just wanna forget you
Time to take my chances, find somebody new
I just wanna for, I just wanna for, I just wanna for
I just wanna forget you
Wake up, baby, don't you sleep, I can't take this one more week
If I can't go out to play, I can't make it one more day
I wanna play with dynamite, time is right for heavy breathing
Gettin' stone cold crazy till the dawn without a reason
I wanna take me a vacation down a long stretch of track
I'll find a new sensation and I ain't comin' back
Tired of tryin' to be what I'll never be, baby,
you could never see that
I don't want a romance, I don't wanna dance
I don't want a romance, or a second chance
I don't want a romance, I don't wanna dance
I just wanna for, I just wanna forget
I just wanna forget you, yeah!
