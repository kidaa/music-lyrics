[MOLINA]
Aurora, help me...I need you...
Come to me like you always have... 
Her name is Aurora and she is so beautiful 
No man who has met her can even forget her 
They're madly in love, forever in love 
I see her so clearly, I know her so well... 
She steps to her glass now 
All almonds and roses 
She's powered and pampered 
The sight of her dark eyes 
Igniting the screen... 
Scorching the screen 

[PRISONERS]
Look at her radiance 
See how she glows 
Look at her silken cheeks 
Pink as rose 
Tell us you secret madam 
Tell us please do 
What is this happiness shining from you? 

[SPIDER WOMAN]
So...you want to know... 
Why I'm aglow...Oh! 
Last night 
I went too see the gypsy 
And oh the things she had to say 
She told me I would meet a stranger 
A lean, handsome hero 
Who'd sweep in and sweep me away 
I sat there trembling at the table 
And smelled the incense in the air 
Someday you'll hear a cry, she told me 
A sharp piercing sound and when you look around 
The love of your life will be there! 
I cannot tell you how you'll meet him 
Or when you'll meet your love or where 
But soon you'll hear that cry, she told me 
And you'll look around... 

[PRISONERS]
You'll look around! 

[AURORA]
At that sharp piercing 

[COMPANY]
Sharp piercing 
Sharp piercing 
Sharp piercing 
Sharp piercing...
