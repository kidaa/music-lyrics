Inside you feel so tired,  
Your minds move too fast.  
Until you're knocked back on the ground, 
Feelings that will linger around.  
Summer here and the sun will find you, 
Falling out with the world around you.  
But you need not run away,  
Cause everything's bound to change. 

We could work this out or just let it go.  
It's time we learn what we should know.  
That's the problem with me,  
See, there's a problem with me,  
That's the problem, problem with me 
. 
So, now you're old and the world has left you.  
You're so sick, you see just where they kept you  
Down, locked up in fear.  
We can change it all from here  
Or simply let it disappear.  

We could work this out or just let it go.  
It's time to learn what we should know.  
That's the problem with me,  
See, there's a problem with me,  
That's the problem 

Fade out til tomorrow.  
You just keep standing there. 
Reeling will follow spinning in the air. 

We could work this out or just let it go.  
It's time we learn what we should know.  
That's the problem with me,  
See, there's a problem with me,  
That's the problem, problem with me. 

We could work this out or just let it go.  
It's time to learn what we should know.  
That's the problem with me,  
See, there's a problem with me,  
That's the problem, problem with me.
