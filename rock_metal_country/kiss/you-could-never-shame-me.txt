[MOLINA]

Am I dying mama? 

[MOTHER]

Hooo! Listen to him! A good son doesn't die before his mother. 
You are going to see me off, thank you very much, and I am going 
to be waiting for you with a good warm shawl. 

[MOLINA]

I'm so sick, Mama! 

[MOTHER]

A good son sees his poor old mother through her old age; he doesn't 
leave her for a tummy ache! 

[MOLINA]

You're not old...You're still beautiful. 

[MOTHER]

I bet you say that to all the girls! 

[MOLINA]

There are no girls, Mama... I have brought you such shame! 

[MOTHER]

No Luis, only if you did something cruel, or uncaring... 
You could never shame me 
There, I've told you so 
Many things confuse me 
But this I know 
Let the neighbors gossip 
At the mention of your name 
You have never brought me shame 
I know some mamas have roughnecks 
Who never bring them joy 
Thank God, you're not that kind of boy! 
I know that you're different 
I don't really care 
I would never change a hair 
You like this Valentin, don't you? 

[MOLINA]

To him, I'm a silly window dresser. 
That's all I am to everyone but you! 

[MOTHER]

Hoo! What nonsense! 
Some other mamas have children 
Whose secrets hurt them so 
But you have no secrets, I already know 
And...you could never shame me 
Let me say out loud 
I've a son, a loving son, 
Who makes me proud...
