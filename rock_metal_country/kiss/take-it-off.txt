Well my mind is gettin' dirty yeah
around eleven thirty, uh huh
I wanna watch some asses shakin'
to the noise the boys are makin', uh huh
Ooh, so I hop into my car,
hit the local titty bar, uh huh
'Cause that's my kind of situation 
when I need some perspiration, uh huh
I do my one-step shoppin' for the girl of my dreams
'Cause I can always be sure that she's as good as she seems
Take it off, give it to me
Take it off, like you'd do me
I wanna see what's inside, 'cause you got nothin' to hide
Take it off, pretty baby
Take it off, drive me crazy
You know you make me so hot, I wanna see what you got
Take it off, yeah!
Wave your panties in the air,
lick your lips and shake your hair, uh huh
Ooh, when you spread a little oil,
yeah, my blood begins to boil, uh huh
Yeah, it's so hard to choose,
when you all look so fine But I got nothin' to lose 
but my money and my mind
Take it off, give it to me
Take it off, like you'd do me
I wanna see what's inside, 'cause you got nothin' to hide
Take it off, pretty baby
Take it off, drive me crazy
