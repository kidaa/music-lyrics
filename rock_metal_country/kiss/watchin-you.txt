Livin' as you do and I'm watchin' you
And you don't really know a-just what to do
You don't really know
You don't really know
What to do
And I'm standin' here not quite aware
And I'm tryin' baby, tryin' not to stare
Ooh, 'cause everybody else is here
Yes, everybody else is here
Everybody else is here
Watchin' you
Ooh, 'cause everybody else is here
Yes, everybody else is here
Everybody else is here
Watchin' us
