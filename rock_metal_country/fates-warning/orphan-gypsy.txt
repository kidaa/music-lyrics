Young warrior to the drunken gallery slave
Running with the wind running wayward knave
I'm a vagabond with a maelstrom mind
My blood has left me behind
So go away leave me alone.
If you look in my eyes you see only stone
I won't let you in I can lock you out,
In your world, your fallacy, I don't want desolate
Isle of debris
Sister Superior, witch is on her winged flight.
Nightmare dream children scream,
Echo Orphanage Hall Tonight
I'm a misconception never had affection
I don't even know my name
Just as well who would know locked in
The closet all day, but I like it here
They leave me alone.
I the sheep, she is the wolf, I must run
Run to the end of the world.
Ophan Gypsy all I'll ever be
Magic for emotion I am free.
Ophan Gypsy all I want to be
Lift your chains from me.
No place to call home, sever my roots from
The earth, eternal exile from day one.
In this lease of life I entered as one
In the end I leave as one.
Not a single word of guile is heard
Come the clouds before the rain.
You've entered my sanctum blasphemed
And caused me pain.
You're a figment of my imagination
I am stone now you know I gave my
Soul to read your mind.
