Attempt the keyhole how

I don't wanna for free

all to stop moving now

you taught it all to me

but I can never walk out

I can never walk out

I'm getting down

I'm going out

I have a date with a pretty ballerina

I had a date with a pretty ballerina

how do I get into bed to sleep with you

crushed cause I tripped the alarms

I'm going sugarless

down enough to a crawl to be primitive

out of my head on the prowl

I'm going sugarless

kasabi courdarouy

how can you refuse

pissed out on engine noise

telepathic blues

you know I never lose

never ever lose

I'm getting down

I'm going out

I have a date with a pretty ballerina

how do I get into bed to sleep with you

crushed cause I tripped the alarms

I'm going sugarless

down enough to a crawl to be primitive

out of my head on the prowl

I'm going sugarless

I had a date with a pretty ballerina

I had a date with a pretty ballerina
