today was the end of a dream
as I watched your shadow disappear
another moment for the memory
as we lose another year
thought I heard You call my name
but YOU only said goodbye
always somewhere we only say goodbye
going nowhere
we only say goodbye
there's never time to say
all the things we need to say
when it's too late
we can only say goodbye
tonight I felt your presence again
as we shared the sorrow we've always known
but I heard the distance in your voice
and I knew I was alone
tried to tell YOU my deepest thoughts
but I only said goodbye
always somewhere we only say goodbye
going nowhere
we only say goodbye
there's never time to say
all the things we need to say
when it's too late
we can only say goodbye
across the miles
both of us reaching we try
but it's so hard to touch
when we only say goodbye
always somewhere
we only say goodbye
going nowhere
we only say goodbye
there's never time to say
all the things we need to say
when it's too late
we can only say goodbye
always somewhere
we only say goodbye
going nowhere
we only say goodbye
there's never time to say
all the things we need to say...
