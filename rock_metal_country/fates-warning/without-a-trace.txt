What lurks behind the minds of men,
The switch is triggered once again.
A silent rage makes the front page
A work of art so neatly done homicide
Cannot decide was it accident was it suicide
She's just a face without a name never made
It home.  They found her car down by
The lake the bottom was raked
The news says it's a classic case, she disappeared
Without a trace
A witness reward but nothing is heard but
Run rabbit run, hawk in sky hides in
The sun
Run for you life he'll take it away
Run run run fast away.
Don't look behind you'll stun if you look in his
Eyes
Run for your life he'll take it away
Run run run fast away
Defective unit on the street tonight
He hunts the weak and clips it wings
The moon ignites a flaming raging child
An empty soul is running wild.
He's just a name without a face, hides from
The camera in disguise.
His mother stands by wipes the tears from her eyes.
In an island in the sea rots a mind of seventeen.
He dreams of a girl he cast from this world.
