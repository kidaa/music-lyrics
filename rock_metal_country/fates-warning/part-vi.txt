i know that i don't know you
and you couldn't know me
but time and space collided
and here we are, here we are
i know that you don't understand
and i can't explain
but circumstance conspired
and here we are, here we are
"the time is four nineteen..."
"time flies..."
"???"
"the answer is no..."
and i know we can't turn back all the years
time reflected in a shade of gray
but i often wonder what could have been
and i still hold on to yesterday
and i know we're not children any more
innocence lost in a sea of gray
but i often wonder what else could be
and i still dream of running away
so where do we begin
and what else can we say?
when the lines are all drawn
what should we do today?
