walking through a wasteland of words and memories
looking for the person i used to be
thoughts i don't recognize make me realize
times have changed and so have i
and a familiar fear comes back to me
pale fire
dry land getting drier
nothing can grow
in the ashes of desire
pale fire
burned on the desire
no one can grow
with nothing to inspire
the bitter harvest of a barren land
i'm painting pictures you don't understand
dust blinds my eyes, makes me realize
i'm choking life with living lies
pale fire
dry land getting drier
nothing can grow
in the ashes of desire
pale fire
burned on the desire
no one can grow
with nothing to inspire
and a familiar fear claims another day
wondering have i said all i have to say
