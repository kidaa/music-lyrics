murdered in munich
crucified in rome
was killing time
on the long road home
let nothing bleed into nothing
and did nothing
let nothing bleed into nothing
and did nothing at all
withered in winter
wished away the night
was out of mind
while out of sight
let nothing bleed into nothing
and did nothing
let nothing bleed into nothing
and did nothing at all
let nothing bleed into nothing
and did nothing
let nothing bleed into nothing
and did nothing at all
watched the days just pass
as the seasons changed
and the shifting sands
slowly rearranged
but i will not eulogize
i won't apologize
i will not defend
anymore, anymore
i will not dramatize
i won't soliloquize
i will not pretend
anymore, anymore
