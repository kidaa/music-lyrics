this shade of gray
this certain sadness
this cold morning light
and this silent madness
it hangs in the air
it hangs like a memory
it hangs like a cloud
it hangs on desperately
between dark and light
between was and be
between young and old
between you and me
between you and me
i remember cities
and i remember rain
like the sound of your voice, falling
these memories and more remain
i remember winter
and i remember strain
like the sound of your voice, breaking
these memories and more remain
i remember the nights
and i remember pain
like the sound of your voice, alone
these memories and more remain
so where do we begin
and what else can we say?
when the lines are all drawn
what should we do today?
close our eyes awhile
as morning shadows play
and listen to the rain
wash the long night away
face to face we'll awake
to see another day
and with hope in our hearts
embrace this shade of gray
this pleasant shade of gray
