Old man time, Wisdom and Rhyme
Seeker of reason, reaper of time
Born to a spell he walks the beaten path
To hell, rusty shackles of time burden his mind
Once on his side time turns to defy.
In a flash of the lightning he's come and gone.
The clock strikes the hours, he climbs to the belfry
As he's done a thousand hours before.
Many dark years, not a vacant hour through
War and fear had the bell been ever strayed,
Hypnotized rhythmic pendulum synchronized
With the beat of the old man's heart.
Man or machine he's living a dream
Forever the clock lives so does he
Faces below fade with seasons of long ago
Forever awake in his brass bed.
Who holds the key.
It's all a matter of time, is there reason
Or Rhyme - is there?
Traveler in time another left
Behind - you are
Tangled in the web of time you've
Swallowed the pill of illusion.
Writings so clear on the wall you
Waste in seclusion
Mirror reflects the mark of the crowfoot
In his eyes now he realize.
Nearing his hour he climbs to the belfry
As he's done a thousand hours before
Moon of blue is in the sky
West wind he whispers why
Sacrifice living for life his perpetual vice
Lonely win blows through his empty soul.
He cries a river of tears on the clock below
Nothings forever and time will tell
His tears rust the clock and he died as well
