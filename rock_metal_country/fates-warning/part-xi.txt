do you think that i, that i remember
do you think that i, that i recall
when you were falling
and i just watched it all?
do you think that i, that i remember
do you think that i, that i recall
when you were breaking
and i just let the pieces fall?
don't you think that i remember
don't you think that i recall
when you were alone, oh all alone
and i didn't hear, hear your call?
call... hear your call, hear your call, hear your call...
