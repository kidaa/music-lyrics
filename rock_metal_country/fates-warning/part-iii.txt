there's a cloud above us
and there's a shadow on us
and outside of us
hangs this shade of gray
rain falling
hours crawling
all around this shade of gray
there's a chill about us
and there's a sadness with us
and deep within us
lies this shade of gray
rain falling
hours crawling
all around this shade of gray
this shade of gray
"rain's falling, hours crawling"
this shade of gray
"rain's falling, hours crawling"
there's a space beside us
and there's miles between us
and all around us
grows this shade of gray
rain falling
hours crawling
all around this shade of gray
rain falling
hours crawling
all around this shade of gray
this shade of gray
"rain's falling, hours crawling"
this shade of gray
"rain's falling, hours crawling"
