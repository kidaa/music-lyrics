are you listening
am i here screaming?
drowning in a silent sea
or only dreaming?
drifting in and out
his mind never rests
lying in shadows
replaying a thousand regrets
can you hear me
am i getting through?
a million miles away
or here beside you?
drifting in and out
his heart never forgets
lying in shadows
replaying a thousand regrets
and the minutes just pass
as the hours change
and the shifting sands
slowly rearrange
drifting in and out
his mind never rests
lying in shadows
replaying a thousand regrets
