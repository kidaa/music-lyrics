stayed up late last night
lying here in bed
looking for words
to say the things i left unsaid
wind at my window
whispers to me instead
and i lie alone
writing letters in my head
where you are, i am
through nights that never end
where you are, i am
in words i'll never send
walked alone last night
cold streets of could be anywhere
looking for words
to share the thoughts i could not share
road at my heels
takes me away instead
and i walk alone
writing letters in my head
where you are, i am
through streets that never end
where you are, i am
in words i'll never send
where you are, i am
through nights that never end
where you are, i am
in words i'll never send
never, never send
stayed up late last night
lying here in bed
still looking for words
still writing letters in my head
