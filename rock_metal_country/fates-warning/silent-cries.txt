Born to an air of apathy
Indifference shapes a fragile mind.
Questions formed at an early age
beg answers unasked
Silent cries
Behind curious eyes resides
a child who cannot speak.
Silent cries
Years find a mind alone whose
questions flow too deep for words.
Covered in a shroud of silence
watching the world go by
Silent cries
Behind outcast eyes, hides
a child who cannot speak.
Silent cries
Time blindly races on
toward the autumn years
Seasons unheeded pass
while we all drown in tears.
Questions unanswered remain
alone they mourn a fragile mind
Silent cries
Behind lifeless eyes, lies
a child who cannot speak.
Silent cries
Silent cries
