Never thought my time was coming
Wasn't in my dreams
Twice I visioned I was falling down,
Down to the ground, I screamed out loud,
Woke on a cloud.
Never really a holy man even though
I understand the father son and Holy Ghost
He's the on that scares me most
Ashes to rain you feel no pain.
Hell fire burns my conscience.  My mind explodes
Spine is severed, blood runs cold, confess the
Deepest of sin, invision a king
With a white violin.
Crucifix hung above my death bed begins
To bleed.
Imagination, lunacy, has he come to hear my plea,
Grant absolution condone my sin.
The lady in black I ask what do you see.
A glimpse in your glass what good
Fortune for me.
The lady in black said your lifeline is damned.
The tarot of death card she held in her hand.
Kyrie Eleison   Christe Eleison
Kyrie Eleison   Christe Eleison
Segments of my life flash through my mind
Things never seen.
It must be fate warning me for now
The walls are closing in.  Rosary in Hand,
Lost grain of sand.
Here I go I start to fall again.
Try to scream I'm mute it is the
End of my last fall.
To the land of nevermore
Shatter her glass I woke on the floor
