Isolation freezes my life, coldness grips my heart
Trapped within a world, a world apart.
Desolate am I, a tempest raging silently.
Lost a barren adrift at sea.
Catatonic state, it sharpens life's depressing edge
The clamor draws me closer to the ledge
As I gaze upon this burning world I curse this life.
A life through which I'm hurled
Lies, lies upon this side and that
Truthless violence deception mourned by the wise.
Thousands of voices drowning out his own
In a popular torrent of lies upon lies
Turn to stone.
So intense the pain that has crawled
From the bleeding corpse of pleasure.
That feeds the worm the writhes
Inside my brain.
In the deep of night it stirs again
In the heart of the sleeper,
From the crack of dawn I wake to curse
The rising of the sun.
Every life is built on hope
Now my dreams have surely passed,
Inner voices haunt my numbered days
Darkness calls me with her laughs
Torn between life and death inertia
Fills my soul.
No will to be nor pride to care
Reapers take your toll.
Strangers cast a menacing glance as
Existence I defy.
Shatter their dream like world I'm not
Afraid to die
Omen bird soars the desert land to the castle
Of idolence, there lies the shadow of a man.
See the colored flowers and marble towers
They fade to brown
Like the unknown inscribed in stone
He's abandoned, abandoned flesh and bones
He's lost in silence swallowed in vastness
Drowned in the depths of a meaningless
Past
