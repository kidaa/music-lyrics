Dark and dampness lingers
in body and in soul.
Dead wall of stone I cry out
for twenty years alone.
Exanimate a penance
not fit for man nor beast.
Innocent of mortal sin,
do hear me out at least.
Man of strong mind and soul
deserves a second chance.
Just to see a glimpse of light
would warm my icy hands.
Any kin or family
just an echo in my mind.
Silence loudens tribulations
that I left behind.
Just then a beam of light projects
from underneath a rock.
Could it be escape I'm free.
I'll dig my fingers raw.
Man of strong mind and soul
deserves a second chance.
Just to see a glimpse of light
would warm my icy hands.
Deep in your mind look for the answer,
it'll be there.
Life, strange illusion,
stay low, it'll take care.
Time is the sentence in which
you must abide.
Make sin your companion,
then Satan be your bride.
The tunnels deep and twisting
as I press my body through and through
Entrapped in this one way passage,
in light I must pursue and soon.
I grasp the bars at the end of my crawl,
as I gape down to the sea.
The skeleton of a man who tried,
a fool just like me.
Man of strong mind and soul
deserves a second chance.
Just to see a glimpse of light
would warm my icy hands.
Deep in your mind look for the answer,
it'll be there.
Life, it's a strange illusion,
take it slow, it'll take care.
No time is the sentence in which
you must abide.
Make sin your companion,
then Satan be your bride.
