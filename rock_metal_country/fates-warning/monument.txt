there's a blind desire there's a drive
there's a need to leave some lasting feat
something to hold, something to keep
a monument to complete
there's a written page there's a book
there's a search for something to say
something to share, something to speak
a monument to convey
is it fiction, is it confession
is it passion or just a profession
is it performance, is it expression
is it passion or just an obsession
there's a photograph there's a frame
there's a time, a moment to confine
something to save, something to see
a monument to enshrine
is it performance, is it expression
is it passion or just a profession
is it fiction, is it confession
is it passion or just an obsession
there's an empty room there's a blank page
there's a picture left incomplete
something is lost, something remains
a monument to defeat
is it fiction, is it confession
is it passion or just a profession
is it performance, is it expression
is it passion or just an obsession
