Bedroom mirrors do tell who's the fairest
of them all
Lime light silhouette transparent attic walls
Dancing shadows cascade paper walls
Wailing ghost guitars send in the clowns
Painted plastic faces stealing mommies
make up
Masque the false gods with mannequin smiles
Prima donnas play upon their pedestal
of fame
Unborn girls false fascade illegitamate child
I won't play your game
Blasphemous black bible bias you betray
bigotry
Slay the hydra prety fair maidens spread
leprocy
Hungry children feed from hype of
perpetual ego's
I slay the hydra, burn the talisman,
holocaust
Run with the pack illegitimate child the
unborn wench at war. tear him inside
she became a bride wedlock to a whore.
Shatter the dream the tangerine dream bow
to kings not queens. Back where you reign
rule your domain Valley of the Dolls!
Bow to kings of yesterday they have given
you wings to fly away, what have the
phantom queens but deceived you
Army of shadows climbing silvery moun-
tains lineing molton and ask kiss my
Camouflage the battle scars with oxy ten and
maybelline
Cloning the hero's in hype magazine
Pirates of underground lightening twice
the speed of sound. You will prevail.
