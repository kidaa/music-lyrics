and here we are again the door is closed behind us
and the long road lies ahead
where do we go from here
it's time to make a change
lets trace the problem to its source
no more riding the waves
on a river that's run its course
I stood at the door to a new beginning
two choices before me and I was afraid
leave the past behind
the long road lies ahead
bury your pride and say goodbye
leave the past behind
tied to a fading memory
of something lost in time
afraid to make the change
scared to leave the past behind
I stood at the door to a new beginning
the future called and frightened I turned away
leave the past behind
the long road lies ahead
close your eyes, forget the fear
leave the past behind
we stand at the door to a new beginning
two choices before us don't be afraid
leave the past behind
the long road lies ahead
close your eyes, forget the fear
leave the past behind
leave the past behind
the long road lies ahead
close your eyes, forget the fear
leave the past behind
