So you learn real hard, babe in the woods
Fight for your keep cause
Deep in the dark wolves rip at your
Heart as you lie asleep.
Endangered specie of the megahertz
Follow the yellow brick road, your
Asylum awaits you.
Sign on the dotted line.
Pirates of the underground, mutiny is in the air.
You're the wind in the sails mother ship
Drifters at sea remain to be, till
Land which speaks our tongue is found
n our way cut the tongues of dragons
Breathing fire
Ride the waves through the air down below
The mire.
Preacher man spins backward secret messages
What are you looking for?  Something your
Subconscience can devise
Such a sin to disappoint your suspicion
Your force is ours there are no hidden lies
Tuned out in neutral vegetation, prime time
Bleeding hearts howl at the moon.
Foul temptress, oh she sings seduction,
As vultures feast forbidden fruit.
Live an abstract life in your hibernation.
A rude awakening for the underdog typhoon,
Set the thames on Fire.
Climb aboard this man of war
She'll take you far away
To a land of fantasy in your imagination.
