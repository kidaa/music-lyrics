These walls are stained engraved with pain
You will find them under shadows casting
shame
Some it's all they'll ever know, Angels of
the fortunate sons come and go ... You
may not
Entities pass in the night Guardians and the
Reaper fight the will to live shall win
Mares of hope ride through their dreams
blinding light awakens sleeping dawn it
seems
It was all a dream endless dream
I will wish upon a star I believe in you
And if my will has strayed afar I
rememebered you
Will you remember me
I the one you sentenced Pennance
unabsolved
Answer me save my will have you forgotten
me
Pace the hallway blindman for a million
miles of stars
His mind has seen. think you may he lives
in darkness
We're the dark he's seen the light of dream
Karen's been asleep forever I know she
hears me
She has so much to say, Machine shoots
sparks through
face
Unto my hand, unto my heart
I'm a fire without a flame helpless child
without a name
With broken wings catch me I'm falling
I'm a question with no answer who are
you that takes my life away from me
unveil the bondaries of the black
I had a dream I was you strong as the fire
In your veins then when I called out your
Name I would remain and witness the pain
I am beyond silent black I will be back
As your guardian
Angels in white you have sacrificed witness
and bury the pain
Walk hand and hand with the fear stricken
child
Strengthen the weak and the lame
pillar of pennance and lore
Perpetual journey into the realm the
sovereign servitor
