staring, silent, naked and cold
outside looking in
peeling away this fragile shell
to face the fear within
and the man in the mirror looks on
as the cuts begin
outside looking in
getting over my fears and under my skin
tearing myself apart
to feel whole again, outside looking in
running, tired, tortured and torn
outside looking in
clawing away these open scars
to heal the wounds within
and the man in the mirror looks out
as he reaches in
outside looking in
getting over my fears and under my skin
tearing myself apart
to feel whole again, outside looking in
too many things left undone
too late to turn back
i could change course before the end
but when all is said and done
all i really want
is a chance to start again
staring, silent, naked and cold
outside looking in
feeling my way through this wilderness
for a place to begin
and the man in the mirror reaches out
to the man within
