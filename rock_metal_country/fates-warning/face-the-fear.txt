here i am looking out looking in
my eyes are open my mind's closed tight
i believe i know i need to let go
and i know i'm wrong but i think i'm right
so i shut you out
and hear what i want to hear
and hide in my opinions
afraid to face my fear
face the fear
there you are reaching in reaching out
your arms are open, your heart's closed tight
you believe you know you have to let go
and you think you won't but you know you might
so you close your eyes
and pretend you're no here
and hide in your secrets
afraid to face your fear
face the fear
and you close your eyes
i hear what i want to hear
and we hide in our suspicions
afraid to face the fear
face the fear
and i shut you out
you pretend you're not here
and we hide in our loneliness
afraid to face the fear
face the fear
here we are looking in reaching out
together and alone
facing the fear we're afraid to show
facing the fear of letting go
