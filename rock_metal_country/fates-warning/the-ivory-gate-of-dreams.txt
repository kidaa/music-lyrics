My life is such a waste
Begging on something to work this time
But why can't I relate?
Feeling all like who is scared?
What's mine
Holding on to faith
Never gave me nothing but despair
So why do I create just to be swallowed?

I can't take
We have a star
I can't take
We got a fantasy
Come what may
We are the stars
I can't wait
I'll take what's mine

Believing all this time, before a crowd could side
Believing all the basics of everything that I could find
Believing all this time, too far to cross the line
Believing all the basics of everything that I could find

I cannot leave this place
Burning up inside this space of mine
Why can't I replace feelings I find hard to really find?
I try but I can't taste
Memories they always fuck with me
So why do I create just to be swallowed?

I can't take
We have a star
I can't take
We got a fantasy
Come what may
We are the stars
I can't wait
I'll take what's mine

Believing all this time, before a crowd could side
Believing all the basics of everything that I could find
Believing all this time, too far to cross the line
Believing all the basics of everything that I could find

All my feelings have been eating all of me
Feed inside
Is there something wrong with me?

I can't take
We have a star
I can't take
We got a fantasy
Come what may
We are the stars
I can't wait
I'll take what's mine

Believing all this time, before a crowd could side
Believing all the basics of everything that I could find
Believing all this time, too far to cross the line
Believing all the basics of everything that I could find
