We were born to brave cold weather
Stormy seas in search of treasure
Light you wield must blind another
Doomed to run forevermore.
How much more can I take?
And how much more, 'till I break?
Rain will pour again today
never-ending daze cascades
Torn inside is there a way
To be freed before I fade
How much longer can I hold?
I'll live no longer in this cold!
close your eyes, what do you see
Dreams in rhyme with reality
Or life to die in black scenery
Empty shells and what could be.
How much more can I take?
And how much more, 'till I break?
How much longer can I hold?
I'll live no longer in this cold!
In this cold!
I'll live no longer in this, this cold
oh!
In this cold!
