talk, talk to me, tell me your secrets
speak, speak the words i need to hear
help to conquer this growing fear
and when the winds of change come blowing through
and all the things i thought i needed
go sailing out of view . . .
shelter, shelter me
when i need someone to turn to
i turn and i lie within
the light of you
shelter, shelter me
when i need somewhere to run to
i run and i hide within
the shelter of you
walk, walk with me through this darkness
teach, teach me to see the light
help me to see beyond this night
and when the sunset hides sea from shore
and all the things i thought i needed
don't mean that much anymore . . .
shelter, shelter me
when i need someone to turn to
i turn and i lie within
the light of you
shelter, shelter me
when i need somewhere to run to
i run and i hide within
the shelter of you
with this darkness all around
tomorrow is hard to see
but i will face this night
if you'll shelter, shelter, me
