Rainny clouds
covered the depth and sunny sky
now I know I'll sleep alone tonite
tears and prayers will be taken by the rain
And the lonelyness in my dreams
Now I know I'll never be the same
living this tragedy, insane,
All I wanna be
is to be free with you,
with me
I don't blame the fate
but it's too hard to face the truth
It was all just like paradise 1
just like we wanted it to be
far beyond the reason
rest our lives
eternity denies the guilt of reality
senselesness
FLY HIGH, reaching skies 2
too eagles trying to be free
moments of madness
will be left behind
the same horizon
but in different lands
