waking by the crystal veils of sorrow
cover selfs pretending our frustations
will gone
once again they're facing the day
we run away, 'cause our lives ...
we're close....
dreams last forever...
lay down on eternity
music in the air...
the queen of the night
the master of wisdom
returning from from past
with the grace of the thunder
