Simple minded brain
for now you succumb
Nothing changes your way
This world insists to be the same
based on our mistakes
The flowers fade along the road
Don't blindfold your eyes,
so loneliness becomes the law
of a senseless life
Follow your steps and you will find
The unknown ways are in your mind
Need nothing else than just your pride
to get there... go!
Now we have to face another day
You won't be alone
This life is forcing us to stay
- For how long?
Cold is the wind and thunder struck
on a stormy night
But can't you see, I'm by your side
We are marching on!...
Follow your steps and you will find
The unknown ways are in your mind
Need nothing else than just your pride
to get there...
So, carry on,
There's a meaning to life
Which someday we may find...
Carry on, it's time to forget
The remains from the past, to carry on
Follow your steps and you will find
The unknown ways are in your mind
Need nothing else than just your pride
to get there...
So, carry on,
There's a meaning to life
Which someday we may find...
Carry on, it's time to forget
The remains from the past
So, carry on,
There's a meaning to life
Which someday we may find...
Carry on, it's time to forget
The remains from the past
Carry on, it's time to forget
The remains from the past, to carry on
The remains from the past, to carry on
The remains from the past...
