Matos, Bittencourt
Time to believe in the dream that you've seen
In a world that is broken and mean
One day the sun it will shine for us all
Take the freedom that you have fore-seen...
Miles away
You're heading for the unknown
and there's no way to get back
Time to complain
Nobody is telling the truth
To live in the crowd
sick of your own vanity
Dead scattered petals around
Hymns of betrayal
calling you for the attack
Evil warning
You're much too fast
and much too high,
No time to worry!
It's over,
no more remaining time
to cry and feel the pain...
In the morning
You stagger up
to start to fight
You get so lonely...
with no fore-sight
until another day!
Run, don't wait for the sun,
cause it's setting on your hopes
Don't look far behind
for the shadows,
they will stand...
Until the end!
Time to believe in the dream that you've seen
In a world that is broken and mean
One day the sun it will shine for us all
Take the freedom that you have fore-seen...
Time to believe in the dream that you've seen
In a world that is broken and mean
One day the sun it will shine for us all
Take the freedom that you have fore-seen...
Evil warning
You're much too fast
and much too high,
No time to worry!
It's over,
no more remaining time
to cry and feel the pain...
Run, don't wait for the sun,
cause it's setting on your hopes
Don't look far behind
for the shadows,
they still stand...
Until the end!
And don't let your pride
make your blood
flow cold in vain...
Until the end...
