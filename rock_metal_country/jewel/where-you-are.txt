I called you late last night
Said you didn't feel like talkin'
Had to blow off a little bit of steam
Said you were tired of feeling so up-tight

You make me so blue
Oh, I get so lost inside of you, but
I can not always find my way
To where you are

Oh, used to be so easy
Use to be so much fun
You say yea that was back when you belived in my love, but that

Things are not so simple now
Oh, I've turned off the lights somehow, and
In the darkness you cannot always find your way
To where I am

Please don't
Take your lights from me
'Cause of you did
I would no longer be able to see
Please, can't you see
I need, you

I am a princess and I'm locked inside this stone tower of song, and I
I'm trying to write messages on the wondow baby, God I just wanna belong

Choose me
Choose me
Pick me, take me, oh I need to believe
Oh, no one else exsits for you now, and
No one else exsists for me
Oh, you are my home, and I have
Finally found my way
To where you are
