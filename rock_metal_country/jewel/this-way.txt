Love be still
love be sweet
dont you dare
change a thing
I want to photograph you with my mind
To feel how I feel now all the time

[CHORUS]
Say that you'll stay
Forever this way
Forever and forever
That we'll never have to change
Dont move
Dont breathe
Dont change
Dont leave
And promise me
Say you'll stay
We'll stay
This way

I get afraid
Dont think ahead
Lets just stay 
This way in bed
Feels so good inside your arms
Home is everywhere you are

[CHORUS]

Dont move
Dont breathe
Dont change 
Dont leave
Promise me
We'll alwayz be
This kind, this sweet
This good to me
Promise me
We'll alwayz be

[CHORUS]
