here's a little bird somebody sent 
Down to the Earth to live on the wind 
Blowing on the wind 
And she sleeps on the wind 
This little bird somebody sent. 

Light and fragile and feathered sky blue 
Thin and graceful, the sun shining through 
She flies so high up in the sky 
Way out of reach of human eyes. 

Light and fragile and feathered sky blue 
Thin and graceful, the sun shining through 
She flies so high up in the sky 
Way out of reach of human eyes. 

Light and fragile, she's feathered sky blue 
Thin and graceful the sun shining through 
And the only time that she touches ground 
Is when that little bird, little bird 
Is when that little bird, little bird 
Is when that little bird dies.
