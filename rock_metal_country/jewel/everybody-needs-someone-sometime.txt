Mary heard boys talking in voices low 
Said she weren't no spring chicken 
Like she didn't already know 
So she called up Jack from a few years back 
She turned him down once in his one room shack 
She said "Now baby, you don't look that bad" 

[CHORUS:]
Cuz everybody needs someone sometime 
Everybody needs someone, can't you see 
Everybody needs someone sometime 

Spivy Leaks was a drip of a man 
He looked like a potato shoved into jeans 
He recollects it wasn't that long ago 
That he could walk by 
Make the young girls scream 
But he thought he'd just let it all slide 
Let it all pass 
Cuz he thought love was best on the run 
He said "Now baby, it don't seem that fun" 

[CHORUS]

[BRIDGE:]
Hey there honeybee 
Will you give me...sugar 
And if you shake real cute 
I might give you some sugar 
I was doin' alright on my own 
Now I might just take you home sugar 

Sister Mary used to be a nun 
She thought that she'd retire and have her some fun 
Mr. Joe of the Philadelphia Joes 
Well he walked in the post office one night 
He said "Hey sweetheart, you know you look alright" 

[CHORUS to fade]
