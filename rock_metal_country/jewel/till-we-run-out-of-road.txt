It's leaving time again
I'm headed out
With all my friends
It's a roll of the dice
I've never thought twice
About the way
I've been spending my time
Trying my guts out
For every dime
Working in an
Office building tall
You don't know
Who's next to you at all
But being out here
The blood, the guts, the beer
Is a test
Only time will tell
It brings you close, man
Closer than hell

We're leaving
Leaving again
Can't recall
Where are we been
I guess we'll just go
Go till we're too old
Or we run out of road

The other day
I talked to Lou
He quit back in 92
Says he misses it bad
Those were the best time
He ever had
He said
"Give it hell to the end
'Cause once you quit
You can't get it back again"

We're leaving
Leaving again
Can't recall
Where are we been
I guess we'll just go
Go till we're too old
Or we run out of road

Expensive cabs
And sh*tty food
Washed down
With cancelled flights
This week endorsement holidays
You miss your boy and wife
Oh the late night drives
The calls
The dawn to strike you
Like a knife
Hey man
This is a beautiful life

We're leaving
Leaving again

We're leaving
Leaving again
Can't recall
Where are we been
I guess we'll just go
Go till we're too old
Or we run out of road

We're leaving
Leaving again
Can't recall
Where are we been
I guess we'll just go
Go till we're too old
Or we run out of road
