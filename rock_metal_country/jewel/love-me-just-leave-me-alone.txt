I saw you standing there
You had gold dust in your pocket and
You combed barbed wire
Through your hair
You thought I didn't notice
The skin on
Your teeth had a tear
To make me notice
You started to shout
Then you and all your minions
Started flapping your
Tiny arms all about
They said
You were a wise man
When did they teach
A wise man to pout
I tried to forget you 
but you tied bells  to your name
They jingled everytime i thought of you
without shame
I tried to be unlovable
Why couldn't you do the same
What's the matter
Does your love need a home
All right then, love me
Just leave me alone
Your mother was a wolf bite
Your daddy was a cigarette
Your brother was a rose bud
Crossbreed with a car wreck
Your sister was a stockbroker
But you ain't nothing
But a turtleneck
whats the matter
Does yout love need a home
alright then!
love me just leave me alone.
I tried to be unlovable
Why couldn't you do the same
What's the matter
Does your leave need a home
All right then, love me
Just leave me alone
It's not your little boys smile
It's not your little boys name
It's those big boy hands
That are the ones to blame
Well, I tried to be unlovable
Why couldn't you do the same
What's the matter
Does your love need a home
All right then, love me
Just leave me alone
What's the matter
Does your love need a home
All right then, love me
Just leave me alone
Love me just leave me alone
Love me just leave me alone
Love me just leave me alone
