Until tonight
My heart was just half full
Id never known the fruit which fed the soul
But now I see what may put to rest my longing

For I have seen, the face of love
The grace of god, the face of love

In silence I feared my heart
Would remain words unheard
Inside a seperate mess of skin
But now I know that the skin just veils the soul

For I have seen, the face of love
The grace of god, the face of love

So take my hand and knowing
With it I also give my heart
Wanting to never be seperate again
Let eternity begin

If you were flame
Id allow myself to be consumed completely
Were you wind Id wish you to pass through me
But now I know that the skin just veils the soul

For I have seen, the face of love
The grace of god, the face of love
