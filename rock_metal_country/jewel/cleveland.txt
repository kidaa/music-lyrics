Went walking underneath the shadows
Where dark and sweet secrets lay
When night tonight falls gently down
Hearts helplessly fall to the ground
Underneath a velvet sky
Only words can lie

I wanna tell you everything
I wanna make your toes curl
You be my only boy
And I'll be your only girl
There's not much I can say
You're in Cleveland today
You're in Cleveland today

Stewardesses like Cosmo magazine
Vogue makes me nervous I feel so plain
I could the world fearlessly
If you would face it here with me
Just our four hands and four eyes
Traffic cops would compromise

I wanna tell you everything
I wanna make your toes curl
You be my only boy
And I'll be your only girl
There's not much I can say
You're in Cleveland today
You're in Cleveland today

Daffodils and roulette wheels and rusty automobiles
Somewhere our things share the same window sill
Somewhere our hearts exist independent of time
Somewhere we are whole
One body
One body and one mind

From the air things look so ridiculous
Our fears so small, our fights so vain
I wanna pilot a plane with you
So all our problems look small, too
It's only an inch from me to you
Depending on what map you use

I wanna tell you everything
I wanna make your toes curl
You be my only boy
And I'll be your only girl
There's not much I can say
Cuz you're in Cleveland today
Oh, you're in Cleveland today
You're in Cleveland today
