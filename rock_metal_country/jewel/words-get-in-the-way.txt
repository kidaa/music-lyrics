Come here buttercup
Let me fill you up 
Can't you see i'm the blue in your skies 
You can tell by the stars in my eyes 
Dawn always comes too soon
It hurts me like a bruise
There's a hole in my pillow 
Where you used to be 
It feels like a hole in the middle of me 

[Chorus:]
Oh, oh, oh just take my hand
To have and hold if not obey
Oh, oh, oh say you're still my man
I'll try to find the words to say
That i want you always to stay 
To wake up with you every single day
But words get in the way
Words get in the way

Tell your boss you're dead 
And let's go back to bed
You make me want to break out in song
But everytime i try it just comes out wrong

[Chorus]

I leave a message on your answering machine
I try to say what i really mean

[Chorus]
