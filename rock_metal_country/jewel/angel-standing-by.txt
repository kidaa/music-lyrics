All through the night I'll be standing over you
All through the night I'll be watching over you
And through bad dreams I'll be right there, baby,
Holding you hand, telling you everything is all right
And when you cry I'll be right there
Telling you were never anything less than beautiful
So don't you worry
I'm you Angel standing by
