I wonder as I wander 
out under the sky 
how Jesus the savior 
did come to die 
to save lowly people 
like you and like I 
I wonder as I wander 
out under the sky 

when Jesus was born 
it was in a cow's stall 
with shepherds and wise men 
and angels and all 
the blessings of Christmas 
from heaven did fall 
and the weary world woke 
to the savior's call
