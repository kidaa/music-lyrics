Hey, you say you like the way the cowboys tip their hats and say, 
"How's it goin' ma'am" 
But you're never quite clear if their glares are sincere
Or really only just second hand
To you it's all voices, its a lavender haze
The man is a marvel, but it's a shame about his brains
But that's OK
You say "he's got straight teeth and it's good sex" 
you look to the sky
You look to the man
you claim innocence and not to understand 
Or do you, do you 
There's a big mad wearing a white suit and patent leather shoes
he want to take his monkeys to see the kids at the zoo
'Cause the gypsy on the corner said
"Hey, Mister you can't lose." 
And it's your first day at the track
you feel that beat of your back
We all want to find a way to beat the system
Find some rhythm in the madness
Get down on your knees and pray
Say, "I'll do whatever you want, God
Just let me have my way" 
Well will you, will you 
come on all you merry men
rally your cry
dance with the devil for tomorrow we'll surely
Hey, hey blow the men down
You with all girls today with nothing to say
No more pigtails and pony rides
They're sophisticated
They sip on lattes
And have their eyes on a bigger prize
We shake our fists and say, "Well good golly we're mad
That God kills children with our very own hands" 
We claim innocence and not to understand
Or do we, do we 
come on all you merry men
Rally your cry
dance with the devil for tomorrow we'll surely
Hey, hey blow the men down
Blow the men down
Hey
