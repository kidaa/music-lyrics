Tonight I have the strangest feeling
Look for answers on a hotel ceiling
When did my heart first feel this way?
Being alone used to be just fine.
Now life without you is just passing time.

I thought I heard you call my name.
Reached for you're hand, it was in vein.
When you're here, it feels like a hole in my chest.
Get dressed, look in the mirror, say
"You're heart will never be the same."

So I drive to you tonight
I was blind, now I have sight.
I could not leave you even if I tried.
You're heart beats inside of me.
Like a star in the dark of night,
Like birds lost in flight.
The clouds in the sky are blue
I belong with you.

I've been together, but alone.
I've made love without love being shown.
I've seen sorrow in a pair of dice,
All things that came in two's made me cry
Until tonight.

So I drive to you tonight
I was blind, now I have sight.
I could not leave you even if I tried.
You're heart beats inside of me.
Like a star in the dark of night,
Like birds lost in flight.
The clouds in the sky are blue
I belong with you.

Can't stop, won't stop.
Love is all we've got
Know how much I love ya
When I put my arms around you
Can't stop, won't stop
You are all I want

So I drive to you tonight
I was blind, now I have sight.
I could not leave you even if I tried.
You're heart beats inside of me.
Like a star in the dark of night,
Like birds lost in flight.
The clouds in the sky are blue, yea
The clouds in the sky are blue
I belong with you.
