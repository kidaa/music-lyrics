Barcelona where the winds all blew
And the churches don't have windows but the graveyards do
Me and my shadow are wrestling a gain
Look out stranger, there's a dark cloud moving in
But if you could hear the voice in my heart it would tell you
I'm afraid I am alone
Won't somebody please hold me, release me
Show me the meaning of mercy
Let me loose
Fly, let me fly, let me fly
Super paranoid, I'm blending, I'm blurring, I'm bleeding into the scenery
Loving someone else is always so much easier
But I hole my self hostage in the morror
But If you could hear the voice in my heart it would tell you
I'm tired of feeling this way
God, won't you please hold me, release me
show me the meaning of mercy
Let me loose
Let me fly, let me fly
I won't be held down, I wont be held back
I will lead with my faith
The red light had been following me
But don't worry mother
It's no longer my gravity
hold me, release me
Show me the meaning of mercy
Let me fly, let me fly, let me fly
