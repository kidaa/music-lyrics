Ophelia drowned in the water
Crushed by her own weight Hitler loved little blue eyed boys
And it drove him to hate
Birds always grow silent before the night descends 
'Cause nature has a funny way of breaking what does not bend
A hero's torso built of steel and Novocain
His heart a bitter beat inside a bloodless frame
There was a hole inside his soul a manicure could not fill
So he fund himself a whore to love while daisies choked in the window sill
We've made houses for hatred
It's time we made a place 
Where people's souls may be seen and made safe
Be careful with each other
These fragile flames
For innocence can't be lost
It just needs to be maintained
A small town in Ohio
Two boys are filled with violence
And darkness spreads its legs for hate and ignorance
We are given to a god to put our faith therein
But to be forgiven, we must first believe in sin
We've made houses for hatred
It's time we made a place
Where people's souls may be seen and made safe
Be careful with eachother
These fragile flames
For without fear 
I want always to feel the wings of grace near
We all will be Christed wen we hear ourselves say
We are that which we pray
We've made houses for hatred
It's time we made a place
Where people's souls maybe seen and made safe
Be careful with each other
These fragile flames
We've built houses for hatred
It's time we made a place 
Where people's souls may be seen and made safe
Be careful with each other
These fragile flames
For innocence can't be lost
It just needs to be maintained
