Fat boy goes to the pool
See his reflection, doesn't know what to do
He feels little inside and filled with pride
Oh, fragile flame
No one sees the same
fat boy goes about his day
Trying to think of funny things to say
Like, "This is just a game I play" 
And "I like me this way" 
Oh, fragile flame
When no one feels the same
Hush, sleep, don't think, just eat
You daddy's little boy
You mama's pride and joy
You know they love ya
But not because they hold ya
Fat boy says "Wouldn't it be nice 
If I could melt myself like ice
Or outrun my skin and just be pure wind" 
Oh, fragile flame
Sometimes I feel the same
