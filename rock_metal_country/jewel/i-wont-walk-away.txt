A lonely street lamp
I'm out on the street walking home
A small pale blur
Leaving trails like a snail I move so slow
Time can bruise*violent indigo
Rush home to your arms 
You soothe my weary soul

Wrong or right be mine tonight
Harsh world be damned we'll make a stand
Love can bind but mine is blind
Others stray, but I won't walk away
Walk away

The clubs are full
Of couples resisting being one
They wear their youth 
Like badges that tarnish all too soon
But we'll be a team
Our two will be one
Love will be our fortress
When all else comes undone

Wrong or right be mine tonight
Harsh world be damned 
We'll make a stand
Love can bind but mine is blind
Others stray, but I won't walk away
Walk away

Sometimes the world don't make sense
Small children filled with violence
Let our light
Shine through the night

Wrong or right be mine tonight
Harsh world be damned 
We'll make a stand
Love can bind but mine is blind
Others stray, but I won't walk away
Walk away

I won't walk away
[repeated till fade out]
