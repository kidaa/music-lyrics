Met her on a friday afternoon
In a neon dayglo pink
Chiffon satin room
She never looked back
She always looked good
Dressed in black
And she says oh
Do you want to play

She lived beneath the
Disco discount store
With pictures of Randy Newman
Scattered all across the floor
I said "This place
Looks sort of desolate"
She said
"Are you only half alive
Or have you simply always
Been this inarticulate"

Oh
Do you want to play

Don't think too hard
Don't think too fast
Don't ever try and say
What you can't take back
Don't try and comprehend
What you can't understand
Beneath the disco daylight
Neon crystal chandeleir
Pink champagne deity
I said "Take it back
Take it back
Take it back"

Oh
Do you want to play

Oh
Do you want to play
