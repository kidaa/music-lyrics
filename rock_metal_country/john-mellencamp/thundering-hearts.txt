In these long, hot summer days
Need a way to cool ourselves down
Pop off the top of that Chevrolet
Drive through the carwash
Laugh and fall around
Smokin' the old Ducados the old man got down in Spain
Eatin' eggs and french fries on the side
Ride that Harley Davidson in the hot summer heat
Lord knows that I just love to ride
Go by and pick up that Kentucky girl
She knew me when I got my start
Oh yeah, those were diferent days...
CHORUS:
In the valley of the thundering hearts
Thundering hearts
Thundering hearts
Thundering hearts
Get your crazy hair, girl, right on my face
This old redneck's on fire, burnin?up
Give us a kiss, baby, make it on the same place
Humiditys about to drive me all crazy wild
Pretty soon the sun will be goin?down 
And this little town will be cool and dark
Forget about heaven. Let me stay here forever
CHORUS:
In the valley of the thundering hearts
Thundering hearts
Thundering hearts
Thundering hearts
