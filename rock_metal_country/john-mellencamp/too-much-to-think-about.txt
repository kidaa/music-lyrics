Sister help take this pain from my heart
help me stand up and find out what's right
Don't want to exist here in the dark
When the gates of Eden offer so much light
But there's too much to think about
Too many problems in my brain
Yeah, there's too much to think about
How could I ever make up my mind
Young man lay down your guns
And hold your woman in your arms
The concrete's not worth dying fo
They say there's more to this life
But there's too much to think about
Too many problems in my brain
Yeah, there's too much to think about
How could I ever make up my mind
So what am i living for
They say the truth is not hard to find
It's right here in front of my eyes
If I could just open my heart sometimes
But there's too much to think about
Too many problems in my brain
Yeah, there's too much to think about
How could I ever make up my mind
But there's too much to think about
Too many problems in my brain
Yeah, there's too much to think about
How could I ever make up my mind
Make up my mind
Make up my mind
Make up make up my mind
