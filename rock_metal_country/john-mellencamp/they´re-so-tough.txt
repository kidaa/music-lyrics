They're so tough
They like to make us feel little
They like to meke us feel small
They like to put us down
'Till we feel no good at all
Then they tell us that we're stupid
That we got no sense at all
They'll take away the spark
Keep us in the dark
Make us feel we have no vision at all
CHORUS:
No, no, no, I don't believe it has to be this way
No, I don't believe it has to be this way
Then they tell us to be patient
That our time will come
But I've stood outside their doors
And walk their floors
And I ain't gonna do it again
They'd like to make me their nigger
I say to hell with them
I'm not getting down on my knees
And begging please
Can you throw me a crumb now and then
CHORUS:
No, no, no, I don't believe it has to be this way
No, no, no, I don't believe it has to be this way
I can't really speak to you
And I don't know about them
They must be out of their minds
Can't read between the lines
They can stick it where the sun don't shine
CHORUS:
No, no, no, I don't believe it has to be this way
No, no, no, I don't believe it has to be this way
No, no, no, I don't believe it has to be this way
They're so tough
They are so tough
