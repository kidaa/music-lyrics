I know you and you know me
we met many years ago
In the halls ofe some ivy covered university
Where we both used to go
Now we stand outside the Denmark Hotel
With Japanese men in ther business suits
It's midnight you're talking to some Frenchman
About who does what to you know who
You want the Big Jack
You want the sky to crack
You want something that's goin?to give you
The Big Jack 
You want the Big Jack
Hell we all want that
You want something that's goin?to give you
The Big Jack 
You say you want to go somewhere
Where your ideals were much more than luxuries
And just like some great old painting
You set there so smug
Whith your hands between your knees
You want the Big Jack
You want the sky to crack
You want something that's goin?to give you
The Big Jack 
You want the Big Jack
Hell we all want that
You want something that's goin?to give you a
Heart attack 
So go back down to that Missisippi town
Where you come from
Have a big time tonight
I can still see you in your fathers coat
On the delta shore
That he once owned
I want to be your fathers coat
I want you girl to matty me
I want the Big Jack
I want the sky to crack
I want something that's goin?to give me
The Big Jack 
I want the Big Jack
Hell we all want that
I want something that's goin?to give me a
Heart attack 
I want the Big jack
Yeah we all want that
We want something that's going to give us the Big Jack
I want the Big Jack
I want the sky to crack
