A cold day in December
And I'm still here alone
I look trough my window and I surrender
Should be gone
But I have no place to go
CHORUS:
Last chance to get up
Last chance to go
Last chance to get up and go
Last chance to get up
Last chance to go
Last chance to get up and go
If there were someone
I'd hold her
If there was love
I'd let it take me away
But I just stay here alone
CHORUS:
Last chance to get up
Last chance to go
Last chance to get up and go
Last chance to get up
Last chance to go
Last chance to get up and go
I feel nothing I feel no pain
I feel no joy nor hurt inside
I only have myself to blame
If I see that the world's passed me by
CHORUS:
Last chance to get up
Last chance to go
Last chance to get up and go
Last chance to get up
Last chance to go
Last chance to get up and go
