Got my hands on a little bit of dough
So I went to the crocery store
and got some steaks to go
Went by, and picked up my gal, Teddi Jo
We had ourselves a picnic
Beside a dirty road
CHORUS:
Rooty Toot Toot
Rooty Toot Toot
We had it made in the shade
Like a bell through the hoop
Spinnin' and tumblin' inside this
Hoola Hoop
Livin' and learnin'
Rooty Toot Toot
We laid out a blanket
And started a fire.
Had the radio playin'
From inside the car
I took off my shirt
And kicked off my shoes
She read the paper
And told me the news
She said, ";There's a lot of
People out there
Who are at the end of their rope
Sometimes, baby 
You've got to lay low";
CHORUS:
Rooty Toot Toot
Rooty Toot Toot
We had it made in the shade
Like a bell through the hoop
Spinnin' and tumblin' inside this
Hoola Hoop
Livin' and learnin'
Rooty Toot Toot
We stayed there all day
We both get us some real
Good suntans
I thought, that was OK
Sometimes life can be so grand
We were gettin' ready
To shake out that place
When the Illinois state trooper
Got in my face
He said, ";You're on pirvate property";
But once he cooled down, he was OK
Sometimes you're golden, man
That's all I got to say
CHORUS:
Rooty Toot Toot
Rooty Toot Toot
We had it made in the shade
Like a bell through the hoop
Spinnin' and tumblin' inside this
Hoola Hoop
Livin' and learnin'
Rooty Toot Toot
