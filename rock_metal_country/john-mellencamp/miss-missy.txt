There's a band playing down the street we could see, yeah
Movie showing down at the Von Lee
A church supper with Grandma and Grandad
Let's go out and have ourselves the best time we've ever had
CHORUS:
Say goodnight, my Miss Missy
Goodnight, it's time to go home
Hey, I might call you later
Oh Missy, girl, it's late, it's time to go home
Weight of the world's now on your head
I take back all those mean things I said
Little baby kicking down in your gut
I hope it doesn't grow up to be as crazy as us
CHORUS:
Goodnight, oh my Miss Missy
Goodnight, it's time to go home
Hey, I might, I just might, call you later
Oh Missy it's time to go home
So let's dance slow just one more time
Let me hold your face close to mine, yeah
Let's pretend that Jesus has come
To take us out just one more night for fun
CHORUS:
Goodnight, oh my Miss Missy
Goodnight, it's time to go home
Hey, I might call you later
Oh Missy, girl, it's time to go home
