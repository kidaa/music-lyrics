Have you ever ridden horses through a rainstorm,
or a lion through a busy street bazaar
there are many things that I'd love to turn you on to
but somehow I feel they're safer where they are
Chorus:
This is a man there is a man
I know
with no expression
he's got none at all
this is a man there is a man
that I know...
with no expression, darling
he's got none at all
Well some people are inbound with infatuation
and some others spill depression as the law
from one mother getting at no imagination
so beware then, baby, sin is at your door
Chorus
Would you remember, you've never seen this man laughing
come to think of it, I've never seen him cry
from where he might be sitting, you hear him singing,
and by and by, you stop and sigh
your voice doesn't even begin to speak, and he just cries
hit it
Chorus
Have you ever, ever ridden horses through the rainstorm??
Or a lion through a busy street bazaar
there are many things that I'd love to turn you on to
but somehow I feel they're safer where they are
Chorus
