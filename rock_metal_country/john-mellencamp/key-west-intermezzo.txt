In a hand painted night, me and Gypsy Scotty are partners
At the hotel Flamingo, wearing black market shoes
This loud Cuban band is crucifying John Lennon
No one wants to be lonely, no one wants to sin the blues
She's perched like a parrot on his tuxedo shoulder
Christ, what she's doing with him, she could be
Dancing with me
She stirs the ice in her glass with her elegant fingers
I want to be what she's drinking, yeah, I just want to be
CHORUS:
I saw you first
I'm the first one tonight
I saw you first
Don't that give me the right
To move around your heart
Everyone's lookin?br> But I saw you first
On a moon spattered road in her parrot rebozo
Gypsy Scotty's driving his big long yellow car
She flies like a bird over his shoulder
She whispers in his ear, boy, you are my star
CHORUS:
I saw you first
I'm the first one tonight
I saw you first
Don't that give me the right
To move around your heart
Everyone's lookin?br> 
In the bone colored dawn, me and Gypsy Scotty are singin?br> The radio is playin? she left her shoes out in the back
He tells me a story about a girl he knows in Kentucky
He just made that story up, there ain't no girl like that
CHORUS:
I saw you first
I'm the first one tonight
I saw you first
Don't that give me the right
To move around your heart
Everyone's lookin?br> But I saw you first
