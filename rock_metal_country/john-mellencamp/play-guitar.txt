You may drive around in your town 
Ina brand new shiny car
Your face in the wind your haircut's in
And your friends think you're bizarre
you may find a cushy job and I hope that you go far
But if you really want to taste some cool success
You better learn to play guitar
CHORUS:
Play guitar--play guitar 3X
You got your eye on the cheerleader queen
you're walkin' her home from school
You know that she's only seventeen
She's gonna make you a fool
You know you can't touch this stuff
Without money or a brand new car
Let me give you some good advice young man
You better learn to play guitar
