Let's get to the point now
Just because we've got the same mum and dad
That don't mean I'm your keeper
That don't mean I owe anything to you
You don't care for me
And man I don't think that much of you
Cause we're brothers brothers brothers
I don't approve of anything you do
Cause we're brothers brothers brothers
Cain and abel and me and you
You drove my car when we were young boys
And you tore it up too
You never paid to get it fixed
And you got me beat up a time or two
I know I should forgive and forget
But man I still hold a grudge against you
Cause we're brothers brothers brothers
I don't approve of anything you do
Cause we're brothers brothers brothers
Cain and abel and me and you
It is as normal as it can be
This sibling rivalry
We should have dropped it at 22
But man I cant stand the things you do
Cause we're brothers brothers brothers
You're always want something from me
Cause we're brothers brothers brothers
It was so much fun having you in the family
Cause we're brothers brothers brothers
Now that we're grown it ain't helped nothin?at all
Cause we're brothers brothers brothers
On my birthday, please don't bother to call
Cause we're brothers brothers brothers
Brothers brothers brothers
Yeah, you're my brother brother brother
brothers brothers brothers
Yeah, we're brothers brothers brothers
Yeah, we're brothers brothers brothers
