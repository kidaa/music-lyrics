Well I lived on the outskirts of town
In an eight room farmhouse, baby
When my brothers and friends were around
There was always somethin' doin'
Had me a couple of real nice girlfriends
Stopped by to see me every once in a while
When I think back about those days
All I can do is sit and smile
CHORUS:
That's when sport was a sport
And groovin' was groovin'
And dancin' meant everything
We were young and we were improvin'
Laughtin' laughtin' with our friends
Holding hands meant somethin' baby
Outside the club ";Cherry Bomb";
Where our hearts were really thumpin'
Say yeah yeah yeah
Say yeah yeah yeah
The winter days they last forever
And the weekends went by so quick
We ridin' around this little country town
We were goin' nuts, girl, out in the stick
One night me with my big mouth
A couple guys had to put me in my place
When I see those guys these days
We just laugh and say
Remember when
CHORUS:
That's when sport was a sport
And groovin' was groovin'
And dancin' meant everything
We were young and we were improvin'
Laughtin' laughtin' with our friends
Holding hands meant somethin' baby
Outside the club ";Cherry Bomb";
Where our hearts were really thumpin'
Say yeah yeah yeah
Say yeah yeah yeah
Seventeen has turned thirty-five
I'm surprised that we're still livin'
If we've done any wrong
I hope that we're forgiven
Got a few kids on my own
And some days I still don't know
What to do
I hope that they're not laughtin' too
Loud, when they hear me talkin' like This to you
CHORUS:
That's when sport was a sport
And groovin' was groovin'
And dancin' meant everything
We were young and we were improvin'
Laughtin' laughtin' with our friends
Holding hands meant so much baby
Outside the club ";Cherry Bomb";
Where our hearts were really thumpin'
Say yeah yeah yeah
Say yeah yeah yeah
