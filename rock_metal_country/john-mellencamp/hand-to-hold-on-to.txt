You can laugh and joke and make fun of your friends,
spin in the middle when your troubles begin,
Take it nice and easy and always pretend
that you're cool.........so cool..........so cool.
Say, ";I'munna hold onto that a while and I will and I'll be tame";,
Talk like a jerk on an educated brain,
Be an old girl drivin' the young boys insane,
Be a joker, a preacher....it does not matter.
Chorus:
Everyone needs a hand to hold on to
Everyone needs a hand to hold on to
Don't need to be no strong hand
Don't need to be no rich hand
Everyone just needs a hand to hold on to
Havin' good luck with your financial situation,
Play the ponies, be the president of the United Nation,
Go to work and be a Hollywood stand,
Drive your 4 wheel drive right into the mud, but
Repeat Chorus
And in those hours when you're alone,
And there's nobody there except yourself,
I know it.........You wanna pick up the phone,
and say, ";Talk to me, talk to me, somebody please
talk to me!"; Yeah!
Guitar solo
Ohh, yeah! 
Chorus
Repeat Chorus
