I've seen the Rolling Stones
Forgot about Johnny Rotten
Saw the Who back in '69
Saw Bobby Seal
Talkin' to the Panthers
Sayin' just what he had on his mind
I saw Marlon Brando
On a motorcycle
He was actin' out rebellion
I saw Rocky Stallone
In an X-rated movie
Called the Italian Stallion
I've seen lots of things
But I have not seen a lot of other things
CHORUS:
But I know
You've got to stand for something
Or you're gonna fall for anything
You've gotta stand right up for somethin'
Or you're gonna fall....for anything
I saw Nikita Krushchev
Kissin' Fidel Castro
Saw a man walkin' on the moon
I saw Miss America
In a girly magazine
I bet you saw that too
I've seen the London Bridge
In the middle of a desert
Seen 33 years go by
I know the American people
Paid a high price for justice
And I don't know why
Nobody seems to know why
I know a lot of things
But I don't know a lot of other things...
Yeah Yeah Yeah
CHORUS:
But I know
You've got to stand for something
Or you're gonna fall for anything
You've gotta stand right up for somethin'
Or you're gonna fall....for anything
Well I've been to Harlem County
And I've seen Paris, Texas
And I've spent some time in Rome
I know a lot of funny people
In a lot of funny places
But the Midwest is my home
We've got to start respectin' this world
Or it's gonna turn around and bite off our face
CHORUS:
But I know
You've got to stand for something
Or you're gonna fall for anything
You've gotta stand right up for somethin'
Or you're gonna fall....for anything
But I know
You've got to stand for something
Or you're gonna fall for anything
You've gotta stand right up for somethin'
Or you're gonna fall....for anything
