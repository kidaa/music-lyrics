Bobby Doll and Big Jim Picato
Call me up every single day
They don't work and they don't want to
Come on down to some damn cafe
Bobby Doll tells me
";Live in the moment";
Don't get too far ahead-
Don't live in the past
I blink my eyes
and the moment is over
I guess another day
has passed
CHORUS:
But it's just another day
It's just another day
Watching girls on the street
Well, that alright with me
But it's just another day
Bobby Doll and Big Jim Picato
Always there with their free advice
They've got pearl handled pistols
Underneath their wests
They want me to go out drinking
With them tonight
CHORUS:
But it's just another day
It's just another day
Watching girls on the street
Well, that alright with me
But it's just another day
You got to clean white sheets
in the mornin?br> Conversation all afternoon
Bobby Doll and Big Jim Picato, baby
And me and you
CHORUS:
But it's just another day
It's just another day
Watching girls on the street
Well, that alright with me
But it's just another day
But it's just another day
It's just another day
Watching girls on the street
Well, that alright with me
But it's just another day
