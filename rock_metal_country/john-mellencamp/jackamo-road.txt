I'd like to buy you a cabin cruiser
And we could sail around with our time
I'd like to get you a southern mansion
And we could burn it down,
Down to the ground
But I'm movin?on down
To Jackamo Road
Down my way through Georgia
And all the points unknown
Yeah, I'm goin?to heaven
I'll come back to get you
Someday someday someday
