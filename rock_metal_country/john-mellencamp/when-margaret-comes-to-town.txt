When you were a kid you recieved no good instruction
And your mother was never nowhere to be found
This lies were yelled and the truth was seldom spoken
That's what you get when Margaret comes to town
She likes to keep things upside down
When Margaret comes to town
When your thoughts are twisted and distorted
And your children are forced to choose sides and lie down
And the kepper is screaming drunk running around naked
It's for your pleasure when Margaret comes to town
She likes to keep things upside down
When Margaret comes to town
Oh, but those who believe in her
They cut off their noses to spite their faces
Leaving you the little one scared and lonely
Who really cares about you now
So if you see her coming man you'd bettertake cover
She stays down at the dark end of a frown
And just like the sirens that are so sweet singing
It's better just to leave when Margaret comes to town
When Margaret comes to town
She likes to keep things upside down
When Margaret comes to town
She likes to keep things upside down
When Margaret comes to town
