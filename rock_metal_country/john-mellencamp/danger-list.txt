Office girls, they pass me by
They don't know my name
Put me on the danger list
Just too wild to tame
Take the drinks off of the table
Throw my guitar out the door
Set my sights on some new sunrise
Help my feet to the floor
CHORUS:
I ain't looking for affection
I guess I need myself a shove
Give me someone I can look up too
Show me someone I can love
Good boys go to heaven
Good girls say their prayers
Me, I don't say anything at all
I hope the Big Man still cares
Touch my soul with your religion
Cut my throat with your spite
Hurt me with your silence, girl
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me tonight
CHORUS:
I ain't looking for affection
I guess I need myself a shove
Give me someone I can look up too
Show me someone I can love
Don't go starin' at me
Makes me feel so insecure
Talk behind my back if you want to
I don't hear no more
Take me to my destination
Put me on the plane
Fly me up to heaven, dear lord
Take me home again
CHORUS:
I ain't looking for affection
I guess I need myself a shove
Give me someone I can look up too
Show me someone I can love
