The president he's a pretty nice guy
I'd like to take him out to dinner sometime
Drive around in his motorcade
Talk about those bills that ain't been paid
And maybe later, on just for fun,
We'll shoot off his submachine gun
We'll shoot out the sky, shoot out the sea
Shoot out those dreams about you and me
CHORUS:
Take my hand girl, I know where you've been
Up the flag ppole and back down again
Walk on water or sink or swim
When you're with me Her Majesty, the Queen, is a pretty nice babe
And I'd like to take her down to St. Petersburg someday
Hang around with her friends and old Joe Kennedy
After dinner I might give her a squeeze
Then we'll just see how blue her blood really is
And in the morning she can introduce me to her kids
CHORUS:
Take my hand girl, I know where you've been
Up the flag ppole and back down again
Walk on water or sink or swim
When you're with me Well our lord Jesus he wants me to pray
So I do every single day
I don'r know if I coming in very clear
But supposedly he can hear me from here
And sometimes he gives me a little relief
When I'm down here on my knees
But there's no redemption on judgement day
For people like you and me
CHORUS:
Take my hand girl, I know where you've been
Up the flag pole and back down again
Walk on water or sink or swim
When you're with me
