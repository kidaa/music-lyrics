I may not be a pillar in my town
Or have the kind of job, you think that I should
I know you see me out runnin' around with a couple of people
You think are no good 
I've tried to clean it up a couple of times, but I'm a
Backslidin' fool when it comes to walkin' that line
It's OK. You think, you're better than me
Yeah, that's all right, girl, that's all right
CHORUS:
'Cause I'm close enough for rock and roll
Close enough for rock and roll
Close enough for rock and roll
I'm close enough for a little rock and roll
Yeah, it's true, I don't plan my time
When you're looking for me, I 'm hard to find
I know, you don't wanna run around with me
With my socks fallin' down, girl, I'm just poor company
I've seen your face, and it's a one-eyed Jack
We like to talk about this or that
None of these things really interest me
Hey, that's all right, girl, that's all right
CHORUS:
'Cause I'm close enough for rock and roll
Close enough for rock and roll
Close enough for rock and roll
I'm close enough for a little rock and roll
I know you think I'm a rough cut, baby
I ain't as rough cut as I am the blood on your hands
Gonna love that blood right off your hands
CHORUS:
Yeah, that's all right, girl, that's all right
Close enough for rock and roll
Close enough for rock and roll
Close enough for rock and roll
I'm close enough for a little rock and roll
