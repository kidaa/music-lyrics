There may come a day when you grow weary
Troubled waters stain the paper cup
From other venues other voices carry
Slipped dreams soaking into thirsty dust
Maybe then and there you'll find another
Lover with a blank and empty heart
Filled with breath and old cells to discover
Strenght to push the seas apart
CHORUS:
On the day we met
I began to want you
On the day we met
I began to lose you too
Both of us circling around the moon
Both of us circling around the moon
There may come a day when you feel anger
China cracked and glued by clumsy hand
Veins of memory touching only hunger
The heart devours what it cannot understand
CHORUS:
On the day we met
I began to want you
On the day we met
I began to lose you too
Both of us circling around the moon
Both of us circling around the moon
Maybe it whas then I saw my future
Saw it as a shadow on the ground
Beneath the earth old nails to discover
Strenght to hold my body down
CHORUS:
On the day we met
I began to want you
On the day we met
I began to lose you too
Both of us circling around the moon
Both of us circling around the moon
On the day we met
I began to want you, want you
On the day we met
I began to lose you too
Both of us circling around the moon
Both of us circling around the moon
Both of us circling around the moon
