Little ditty about Jack and Diane
2 American kids growin up in the heartland
Jacky's gonna be a football star
Diane debutante backseat of Jacky's car
Suckin' on a chili dog outside the Tastee Freeze
Diane's sittin' on Jacky's lap
He's got his hand between her knees
Jacky say ";Hey Diane lets run off
Behind a shady tree";
Dribble off those Bobby Brooks
Let me do what I please.
And Jacky Say
Oh yeah life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin is gone
Oh yeah say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin is gone, they walk on
Jacky sits back reflects his thoughts for the moment
Scratches his head and does his best James Dean.
Well you know Diane, we oughtta run of the city
Diane says ";Baby, you aint missin' no-thing";
Jacky say a
Chorus
Gonna let it rock
Let it roll
Let the Bible Belt come down
And Save My soul
Hold on to 16 as long as you can
Changes come around real soon
Make us women and men
Little ditty about Jack and Diane
Two American kids doing the best they can
