Raw deal institution
Wreck that I call myself
City slam penetration
Play it like a fool
Need born invention
Puts the war in your face
Payback time execution
Demon speed crackdown 

Compute the kill
Blackmarket war
Damnation sings
Brain waves roar
Escape the pain
In a pit of power
Deep sixer sleep
Like a devil flower 

Raw deal institution
Wreck that I call myself
City slam penetration
Play it like a fool
Need born invention
Puts the war in your face
Payback time execution
Demon speed crackdown 

Give the world
Blood syphony
How low is your
False sypathy
Justice claws
A death horizon
Freak-zone flesh
Maggot man rising 

I am your satisfaction
I am your memory
I am your suffocation
I am your sanity 

Demon speed too fast for you
Cry in the night
So lonely
Obsession
The only
Money talks
You listen
Hungry game
Submission 

Demon speed too fast for you
Innocent
The big time
Avenging
My mind
Generate
A smooth gain
Live in fear
With no pain
Demon speed too fast for you 

Fade away in the silence
Speed racer baby is
Lost in love
I see a blood sucker soul
Come on baby push to shove
Squeeze a drop of mercy
Place yourself outside of life
I see a blood sucker soul
Come on baby push to shove
