Yeah! I Penetrate the demons
Their teardrops burn away my eyes
I love the paper-thin cry of the locust
Is there and other way to die 

Find me another hell
And the deathbird ride
Yeah - Yeah - Yeah the motherfucker 

Yeah! I'm down-drifting slowly
Going close enough to the sky
New world gone slay the devil
Can you show me a better way to die 

Find me another hell
And the deathbird ride
Yeah - Yeah - Yeah the motherfucker 

New lovers bang the corpses
Eat the rain and don't ask why
I am a plague in an 18-wheeler
Get behind the wheel I'm gonna drive
