The siren sings a 
Lonely song of all the 
Wants and hungers 
The lust of love a brute 
Desire - the ledge of life 
Goes under - Divide the 
Dream into the flesh
Kaleidoscope and -
Candle eyes - Empty 
Winds scrape on the 
Soul - but never stop 
To realize -
Animal whisperings
Intoxicate the night
Hypnotize the deperate
Slow motion light - Wash 
Away into the rain
Blood, milk and sky
Hollow moons illuminate
And beauty never dies
Running wild running blind
I breathe the body deep
1,000 years beside myself
I do not sleep - Seduce 
The world it never 
Screams Dead water lies
Ride the only one who 
Knows - Beauty never dies
