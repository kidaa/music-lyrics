Who will survive and what will be left of them
Apocalyptic dreams see the ordinary madness
Who will survive and what will be left of them
I never lock the dogs when the wolf is in the darkness
Come on - come on the mutherfucker's on fire
He cut through the bone, he cut through the wire
Come on - come on the mutherfucker's on fire
He cut through the bone, he cut through the wire
Yeah - yeah - yeah - yeah
Who will survive and what will be left of them
Into another world number nine bring the death in
Who will survive and what will be left of them
Loser take it all - getting high on the kick in
Yeah - yeah - yeah - yeah
Who will survive and what will be left of them
Got 24 hours of psychoholic magic
Who will survive and what will be left of them
Illuminate the face and the eye of the serpent
Come on - come on the mutherfucker's on fire
He cut through the bone, he cut through the wire
Come on - come on the mutherfucker's on fire
He cut through the bone, he cut through the wire
Yeah - yeah - yeah - yeah
I'm already dead
