Great white eyes
Bleed away the
Trembling sound
No more time
Body spasm deep
And passing
Acid flesh
Human river stepping
Stones of
Love and death 

A living legend's legacy yeah!
Hustler of the dead
Revolution steals the world
And turns the sky to red
Home sweet hellhole to the
Last man on earth
See what the face of evil
Is truely worth yeah! 

Turn your eyes
To the sky
A corpse of blue
Night is time
Growing strong
With every moment
Acid flesh
Chaos pulsing
In my viens yeah! 

Hell house temptation
Walk on to salvation
Cold steel-pain trust
Hot blood-forever lust
Raw horror make cheap thrills
Twitch the nerve get your fill
Razor make clean cut
River red so what
Gut twisting holiday
Skin dripping pay to play 

Stain is blood
Without a doubt
Godslayer action
Eye to fist
Fist to eye
Dig the war anyway
Killing time
Killing time
Bending cracks up
In my mind 

Bite down
Bite down 

Money burns
In my hands
I can't seem to
Get enough
Hammerhead
Says to you
Love is the one
Thing money can buy 

Bite down
Bite down
Down
Down
