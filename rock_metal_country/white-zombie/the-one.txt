Blowing around, turning over and out
Apocalyptic dreams and a supersonic high
Get running now
Two hours to die
What's with this guy gonna think you're alive

Yeah, I am The One
Destroying you, every mother's son
Yeah, I am The One
King of the World as the Devil's son, Yeah, Yeah

I am alive, roll in my maze
Staying a step from the human race
The more I love, the more I die
The more I'm down, I wonder why

Yeah, I am The One
Destroying you, every mother's son
Yeah, I am The One
King of the World as the Devil's son, Yeah, Yeah

Run baby, Run baby, run away
Run baby, Run, Escape L.A.

Who do you love, you wouldn't know
 atomic flow
I am the one, demon red
American Dreams explode in my head

Yeah, I am The One
Destroying you, every mother's son
Yeah, I am The One
King of the World as the Devil's son, Yeah, Yeah

Run baby, Run baby, run away
Run baby, Run, Escape L.A.
Run baby, Run baby, run away 
Run baby, Run, Escape L.A.
Run baby, Run baby, run away Yeah, I am The One
Run baby, Run, Escape L.A.
Run baby, Run baby, run away Yeah, I am The One
Run baby, Run, Escape L.A.
