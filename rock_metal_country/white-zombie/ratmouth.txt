A knuckle duster is the most deadly in the ponderous pace 
Of floating justice single-handed dynamo. 
Take it now, say the way we want and not for you to point the finger
combustible in a word fuck'n. Say the word and you'll be free. 
Contunue your journey Superman say I am we can put you down 
not a wizard-boy question just a demonstration of definition. 
Silver city crusading to the top of a fug'n bone break most 
vile experiment ready to eat your ass. Clockface. Bigtime.
We are. Somekind. Say it. Like always. 
Sound + silence promote the zero. 
A steel hammer game from me to you, but I don't mind the matter. 
Ratmouth don't know what you need just know what you want.
'Walking dead' crawling bloodthirsty Hollywood demon flower grow in the 
Valley of Love like a freak highway accident.
Last ride rolling down say hi-density. 
Glory stomp gonna make the girl in the room +
in the house turn and see that I ain't there...
