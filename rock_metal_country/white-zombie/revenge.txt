Live to die
For a heart jam
Fight to love a
Super bitch
Drive her roots
Straight to hell
Atomic ass 99
Another cosmic monster
Spits his teeth
In your eye
More dead than alive 

Revenge is better than
Love
Revenge is better than
Love 

Frankenstein
Was built for you
But he must be
Destroyed
Cut him down yeah
In his prime
And let the party
Begin
Not much of a face
tombstone laughing
More dead than alive 

Revenge is better than
Love
Revenge is better than
Love 

Revenge
Revenge
Revenge
Revenge 

They sharpened their war
Pure fear as a weapon
Brilliance through
Centuries
Time rolls on and on and
The river of life
Drowning everyone but me 

Turn my back
And disappear
Chill is in my gut
Turns me loose
Head splits like wood
Mind collide confession
Rambling remember when
Sweat meant something
More dead than alive 

Revenge is better than
Love
Revenge is better than
Love
