Falling down I am a psychoholic
Erratic and sure I cannot fail
Replay slow smooth and automatic
Go easy riding danger
Yeah - two guns west I ride an instamatic
Polaroid rat crucifixion nail
Antenna down cruising in the deep red
Mouth of a demon angel 

GET IT ON! 
GET IT ON! 
GET IT ON! 
GET IT ON! 

Yeah! Rush of blood burn through my face
And vicious t-bird breed on the whore
Wonder wheel cool and hellamatic
Go easy riding danger
Yeah - shadowplay I blur the technicolor
Stain a holy bed - a diamond way
Blackened core clear fuk-o-matic
Mouth of a demon angel 

GET IT ON! 
GET IT ON! 
GET IT ON! 
GET IT ON! 

Straight to the top - sadistic or anything
Acid eat the face of night - strip to the bone 
Release me - violate - eye of God
A goddamn, right 

GET IT ON! 
GET IT ON! 
GET IT ON! 
GET IT ON! 

Yeah - falling down I am a psychoholic
Erratic and sure I cannot fail
Sit them there and sink into the deep red
E-Z riding danger
Shadowplay I blur the technicolor
Keep 'em running-go-demolition way
Going down deep into a hole
Called love of a demon angel 

GET IT ON! 
GET IT ON! 
GET IT ON! 
GET IT ON!
