Summer of love
What a waste now
Earth magic strikes out
A million dollar monster mind
In search of the devil's garden 

Make them die
Make them die
Make them die
Make them die 

In this land there's no return
Everybody licensed to thrill
A killer alien selling point
Invasion can be fun
Martian war death machine
Turns into a jungle hell
Hang 'em up in the trees
See how hard love bites 

Make them die
Make them die
Make them die
Make them die 

Shot down
Watch the skies
U.F.O. suicide
I say believe in me
Trip on mars
And get free
Interpretation
Wiped away
No more to say 

Time unleashes death
Mid-air plague
Brain damaged rage
Come and get me 

Death star reaches
Out to crush you
Idealistic super-hero 

Hell squad kingdom
Gets to jammin'
Somewhere in time
Rock the house down 

This is murderworld buddy
Not just another traffic jam
No credit card gonna get you home
Jewels in the night don't
Shine no more 

This murderworld brother
Nobody loves you anymore
Out of sight and out of mind
What is it what it is 

This is murderworld sister
A deep throating little baby-face
Horror of the body is alright
Come on baby and get it on
