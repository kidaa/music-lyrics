Out of the past
Machines of crime
Brute force side-split
Live and let die 

Dealing I am
Triumph blood is
Thicker water
Getting
Power hungry 

Track down weak flesh
Some like it hot
High roll get down
Fist face get down 

Dull years
Strait jacket baby
Wired from 10 years

Bending the rules
Seems more likely
Than going insane
Sweating time
In the hot house
Toyland broken yea
Eating away
All fascination
Got the power
To get away 

Steel crush destroy
Call of the soul
Money mindstorm
Run for your life 

Dealing I am
Triumph blood is
Thicker water
Getting
Power hungry 

Future alive
Robot city
Take what I need
Young stuff
Get down 

Taking refuge
In a breakdown
Extermination
Starts the
Takedown
Forming a theme
Staple characters
Flying god-head 

Non-conforming
Precision
No direction
Collision
Accelerating
Evolution
Dinosaur
Revolution
Slaughter house
Blood slamming
Emotional
Bitch scamming
Impossible
Demonstrate it
Power hungry
So I
