Thrust in deep there are no limitations - Wing shaped 
constellations everywhere now - Creep, babe, creep your 
life's a suicide and I said "I'm gonna ride it" She don't care 
now -Yeah! Maybe - the night ride gonna bleed - Yeah! 
Maybe - this is what ch'all need! Sink'n deep into your 
destination dig the demolition everywhere, now - Creep, 
babe, creep into your ring 'o' fire - Burned out on the 
wire - She don't care, now - Yeah! Maybe - the night ride 
gonna bleed - Yeah! Maybe - this is what ch'all need! Open
The darkness an hour later to the minute moment move 
under the guilty she went deep into the corner - Snap dog 
city hypnotize and break the mercury - Rig test - Oil inject
freak hallucination - Shot through the backdoor buzz a 
whirling locomotion West straight to another Through 
the sea of love - Life on the line - Still in time - You will find 
"She has gone away." Don't ask why - super sky - live or 
die "She has gone away." Figure this - no more, sis - Spanish
kiss. "She has gone away." Thrust 
into a diamond generation - 
Dexceleration everywhere - Up from 
hell a missile to the moon and zero 
to the 3 and 4 and 5 and Yeah! Maybe 
- the night ride gonna bleed - Yeah! 
Maybe - this is what y'all need! How 
fast can you really move me Come 
on, come on, come on, come on, yeah!
A ritual electro-nation - yow!!
