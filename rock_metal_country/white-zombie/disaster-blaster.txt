Conquest heat master
Skin crack move faster
Doomwatch got open eyes
Perversion never lies 

Disaster blaster
Disaster blaster 

Creature of destruction
Laughing dead corruption
Challenge to survive
Love butcher alive 

Disaster blaster
Disaster blaster 

Take a journey into fear
Demon warp invasion
Thunder wheels rolling
Crush 1000 faces 

Sworn to fun and loyal to none 

When the beast is clever
The best it ain't over
Walk alone on borrowed time
And kiss tomorrow goodbye 

Sworn to fun and loyal to none 

Lost inside a human zoo
Edge of life wants you
Got a grip on the wire
But my brain don't get no higher 

Disaster blaster
Disaster blaster 

Leather skin move to the beat
Beastman insulated heat
Looking for a sleeping dream
Hop-head body scream 

In the morning
Ready to learn
What's happening
And who's gonna burn 

Get on your feet
Time to die
On the floor
Machines don't die 

Stealing the world
Walking away
Poison mind
Everyday
