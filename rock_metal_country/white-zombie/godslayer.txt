Listen
To the horror of satan sea
Listen
To the guns of superman
Well I say
Return to a platinum stranger
Hooked on
The enemy under your skin
Panic
Despite the heart of stone
Doomsday
For all the beautiful people 

Hey I know what I want now
And it's right in front of me
And I know how to get it
The good things in life are
Always free 

Landscape of greed and hate
It keeps me going
Victim of what's inside you
Outside of truth
Only hurts now when I laugh
Live by fire
Forever is a long long time
War is hell 

Hanging man twitches in agony
Death rattle shakes itself free
Raise you hand to the mountain
Drown in your own bloody fountain
Shadows become longer the sun
Burns down
Don't need to look I am found 

Lucky
If you still remember your name
Freedom
Visions of a showdown
Blood is
Boiling in the midnight sun
Sizzling
Like the enemy under your skin
