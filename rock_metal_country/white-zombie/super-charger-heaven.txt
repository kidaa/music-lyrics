Jesus lived his life in a cheap hotel
on the edge of Route 66 yeah He lived a dark and 
twisted life and he came right back just to do it
again - Eye for and eye and a tooth for the truth - 
I ain't never seen a demon warp deal'n a 
ring-a-ding rhythm or jukebox racket my
mind can't clutch the feeling - yeah! 

DEVILMAN - DEVILMAN - calling DEVILMAN 
running in MY HEAD YEAH
DEVILMAN - DEVILMAN - calling DEVILMAN 
running in MY HEAD YEAH 

Hell hounds lead at the cowardly kings
And carry souls across the river Styx
yeah! They see no evil and feel no pain
Sucking juice from a fallen angel - I dreamed 
I was a super nova fucker nitro-
Burning and fuel injection - Feed the gods a strychnine 
Soul a motherfucker of invention 

DEVILMAN - DEVILMAN - calling DEVILMAN 
running in MY HEAD YEAH
DEVILMAN - DEVILMAN - calling DEVILMAN 
running in MY HEAD YEAH 

Yeah inbreed the witches 
and woship the dogs
Deformed and fuck'n lazy
Damn yourself and choke
On my name I'd love to love ya baby
Deadringer rats swinging in the trees
Immaculate conception Bury me an angel God I need 
some inspiration 

DEVILMAN - DEVILMAN - calling DEVILMAN 
running in MY HEAD YEAH
DEVILMAN - DEVILMAN - calling DEVILMAN 
running in MY HEAD YEAH
