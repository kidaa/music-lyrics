Gripping the wheel, his knuckles 
went white with desire! The wheels
of his Mustang exploding on the 
highway like a slug from a .45. 
True death: 400 horsepower of 
maximum performance piercing the 
night... This is black sunshine. Yeah! Move me in the 
silence baltic motorway hang me on the edge before I 
fall away - Apocalypse is dawnin' action on the mile. A 
"can-do" revolution - Earth to the river nile Sweet'n 
the ride - Black Sunshine - Sweet'n the ride - Yeah - Sweet'n 
the ride - Black Sunshine - Sweet'n the ride - Yeah! Cry a 
river "cosmic" - Moon in Scorpio, feel her body "breathe" - 
Acid radio - Tell me that you like it - when I'm going 
down! Tell me that you like it - Move to the speed of 
sound Sweet'n the ride - Black Sunshine - Sweet'n the ride 
- Yeah - Sweet'n the ride - Black Sunshine - Sweet'n the ride 
- Yeah! Go! Slide into - I said "44" cool heart can - A 
hypnotize dream into infinity - I turned the love to lies
- crawl across the water - wave and sink into the sea -
Reflect'n onto everything - that you can never be
"Check-out" Yeah! To the devil a daughter comes 2000 
worlds away Yeah Born to lose the love you choose - 
Destroy another day - check out!! Sweet'n the ride Black
Sunshine - Sweet'n the ride Yeah! Sweet'n the ride Black 
Sunshine - Sweet'n the ride - Stare into the T.V. kiss off 
the pain! Wonderland is falling - no sing - no rain
Momentary - damage into the high drift me to the 
circuit sky Finally nothing moves. High noon - Blacktop 
rolling below the asphalt drive - A concrete fascination 
scraping the edge of nothing - This is blacksunshine.
