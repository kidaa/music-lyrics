What are you I say to me. 
A privilege machine man in the valley of the ice house. 
Yeah Joke so old that it is new. 
Cause the innocent they know thier place. 
In this slug motion dinosaur. Skin beating heart breathing. 
Eyes humming. Walls splashing. 
Blue blood spits from the Butcherboy. 
Just split the head and stand back. 
Out of the chaos comes a reason whipcord yea!! 
Hell on Earth a semi-trane. Exression of pre-occupation skin beating. 
Heart breathing. Eyes splashing. Walls humming. 
Soul Crushing. Soul Crushing.
