What is it What it is. What is it 
Dazzling, yea starving town, starving town, out of the cold, out of the cold
Die, Die, Die! Moneyman rumble. Dreamtime maker. 
Dressed to kill. Crybaby keeper. 
Nature of the madness. Lies very still. 
Shadow boxing motions a real believer. 
Areal believer. Look here, get it and go, look here. 
Seduction in a new new world, seduction. Into the fire 
Die, Die, Die! Cannibal collision american girl. 
Suck in your gut. Unlike before yea, unlike before, if you murder. 
Object of desire. Now come and get it. Get it! Come get it! Come. 
While I roustabout. Brutalities inflictied. A rush across the room. 
While the city sleeps. I want to ask you. What's in store 
Fleshy jaws. Now wait a minute.
