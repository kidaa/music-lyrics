Been down yeah! Well I look down and my mind blows 
away - Deep in the darkness "illuminate" Beyond a 
million miles - Something slid up to my head Circling 
around my eye - eye - eyes And I said, "Smooth operator" 
sez: Get up - get up - and outta here, Smooth operator 
sez: Yeah! Lights - band the traffic thunder two blocks 
west of the rest - Tore away the bottom and saw life is a 
test - Beyond 1,000,000 miles - Well I ricocheted through 
my head - One hand kill the other's cra-a-crazy -
What she said - Smooth operator sez: Get up! get up! and 
outta here, Smooth operator sez: Yeah!!! Sail into night-
ghost ship a tripping - Struck by the plunge something to 
see - yeah - Bootleg the girl - she is a looka - Pure is the 
fear that breaks away - Straight to the sun I am a 
walk'n state of the art - all that I see Yeah New gods 
move whipp'n the shore and dash 
on the reef - surf city... I walk 
alone and stare, man, right in the 
sun - Tear-jerk asylum and cemetery 
run - Well, how'd I ever get this far 
man Smooth curves switchback the 
sweat - Underneath the body, baby - 
where what you see is what you -
see and what you get
