I black the temper
Never seen the face of truth
Sweet Mr. Jesus
Infected on my skin
Deep mist around you
I'm crawling on the side
Sheep for another
Another taste of life

It's alive, yeah everybody
It's alive, who will stop me

Dead barks around you
Crawl in a river black
I 
He's falling on the way,
Out with another
A falling wall of sound
Say that you love it,
Don't make me turn it down

[chorus]

Born to kill,
Black, blue and bloody fingers
Hong Kong head
 gonna face this wheel
Now tell me smooth,
I'll tell the pussycats
And ultra- pain,
I'll blow it all away

[chorus]
