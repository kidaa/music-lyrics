Alone against the world
Twist a reckless life - straight
Into the heart of the ripper - 
Trick of treat my mind to
A rebel ride - Heldorado
Move like a monster 

Creature of the wheel 
trigger wicked way -
Tangle like a web 
beneath me
Ankle-deep in hell 
through another way crucify the sky above me
New God kill machine 
And man say Lord of the 
Engines - Yeah 

Pocket full of dirt - frozen 
In my hands - hold on to 
The nameless 
God yeah
Breathe 
Into the deep 
And dying light 
Of day - Overdose 
On bloody wings 

Splinter in the 
Skin turn your 
Eyes away - sick and 
Swaggering - beneath me
Revolution mind ye of 
Little faith
Rusty and dull
Cut me
New God kill machine 
And man say Lord 
Of the engines 

And O' brothers and sisters
I ask you to look at him. Does 
he have the marks Do you see 
them NO. 

Demon-paper clowns
Stitched across my back
Easygoing dead black eyes
Microscopic giants on a chicken
Run - Everybody dies laughing 

Thrust into the drag on the 
Edge and wait Motivate the one 
Inside you Bastard kicker burn 
Blow the ash away - Heldorado 
Gonna get you - get you
Get you - get you
