September in the rain - her sweat come a frozen onto 
my skin - Eliminate the outerspace and come and get I'm 
swing'n down it again - Synchronize me - fall away - I 
believe that - I wicked on the way look alive now! Yeah! 
Stars explode my eyes - Well, "I been down a long time"
Days crawl away and die "forever is a long time!"
Remember howling "crazy" like at the moonlight 
superfly - A penetrating powerman "O baby" I'm painted 
in the sky - Iron fister - on the 
hour / paralyzing demon - flower
- Yeah! Stars explode my eyes - "I 
been down a long time" Days crawl 
away and die "forever is a long 
time!" Surround the pain the love's 
insane - got a pseudo-systematic 
gain Careening through the neon 
side - a horizontal "mind collide" -
Harum scarum holiday - Double 
deal'n on the ones who say 
"collapse me with a powerblast"
Groung to zero roll'n fast - Ride 
the glide - treasure slide - got a 
wooden symbol soul inside - "Freeze" 
the heart - a razor tear pack she 
doesn't care - If the pillow jacob sky snatch the pad I 
don't deny - Been a long time - been a long time - Step into
the wind a watch a red girl come alive She scream'n to 
the world "I diggin' on the fact that you will not 
survive!" Radiate me - walk away - You shook the devil's 
dig deep hand today - Yeah! Stars explode my eyes, Well, 
"I been down a long time" Days crawl away and die, 
"Forever is a long time!" A million miles an hour - a
million miles an hour - a million miles an hour - let's
get inside!
