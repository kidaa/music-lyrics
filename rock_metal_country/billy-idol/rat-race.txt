Wake me from my sleep
A cautionary tale
A walk in infancy
A way to derail
I wanted to be free
And I wanted only you
The walls are falling down

[bridge]
And somebody says
Give a little love, give a little love
But take your time
And somebody sighs
Yes, give a little love, give a little love
But take your time

[Chorus]
A private life, c'mon now
I said livin' gets to be
Just like a rat race, rat race
C'mon, I'm a-read between the lines
Fierce stuggle, a natural one
A Tough job gets to be
Just like a rat race, rat race
C'mon, I'm locked up in myself

Check before rising
Check before we work
Childproof the scene
No screams can be heard
The roof is caving in
The space between our hearts
The walls are falling down

[bridge]
[Chorus]

It's a rat, it's a rat, it's a rat race
It's a rat, it's a rat race
[x2]

Aah life, living in a rat race, c'mon

Hmm life, are you living in a rat race?
C'mon, here inside yourself

[Chorus x2]

I'm locked up in myself [x2]
