Here I come again
It is the end of the night
And baby stuck out tonight
Oh but to her strange vibes
To make her feel alright
For baby's feeling sick
Well now she tried so hard
So hard to be hip
She's shooting stars
With her friends
She's shooting stars
Till the end
What is the time of day
She thinks she's really hip
Oh it can be so maim
If you wanna play that game
Why don't you listen to me

Don't go out tonight
Don't go out with no boys
Oh your heads always to the ground baby
On the scrounge at the peppermint ground
Baby's feeling sense
Well now she tried so hard
So hard to be hip

She's shooting stars
With her friends
She's shooting stars
Till the end
What is the time of day
She thinks she's really hip
Well you wanna play the fool
You wanna be so cruel
You wanna shoot that hero
Oh don't you know that baby
Revolution or maim

It is the end of the night
And baby stopped out tonight
To many sing marks on her hearts
To do her any more harm
Baby's feeling sick
They tracked her down
And she tried so hard
So hard to be hip
She's shooting stars
With her friends
She's shooting stars
Till the end
She's shooting stars
With her friends
She's shooting stars
Till the end

Come on, be her friend
You know she's in my trust
You know she's in my strong
