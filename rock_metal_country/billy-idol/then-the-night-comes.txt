In this world of wild illusion
My room cold as the grave
Yes she knows I never pull my shade

Is it a fear, fear of madness
Or some strange alchemy
Is it a fear of fear itself
I think I'll get deranged

Then the night comes
I'm gonna be free
Never enough then the night comes
Then the night comes
I'm gonna be me

Never enough, haunts my psyche
Never enough, forever
Never enough as I begin to shroooom

Here she comes so wild so horny
My sony eyed medusa
She's acting strange, insane
Oh yeah, we're gonna get deranged

Then the night comes
She's gonna be free
Yeah, then the night comes
I'm gonna be me
Then the night comes
Baby make me
If the devil comes
He's gonna tangle with me

I take some GHB
I feel love, joy
And wonderful ringing music
Now, I just got to be me

We're here now, embrace this madness
We're here now, for sorcery
We're here now, there is no sadness
So take this town and bring it down

When the night comes
I'm gonna be free
Never enough then the night comes
Then the night comes
I'm gonna be me
Then the night comes
Yeah, then she comes
Mmm baby, I'm gonna be free
Yeah yeah, then the night comes
Wooo, then the night comes
Come on, woo, then the night comes
Come on yeah then the night comes
Then the night comes
Mmm, then the night comes
Alright, then the night comes
Eyeeeeaaaa, we're alright
When the night comes
