Had enough of hard times
Foolin' my babe

Any old which way
Had enough of
Saying to my love
How could you babe
Get enough of this stuff
Fed up with hard times

Sick of the boss

Get out my way
Sick of the boss
Just any old pay day
Laugh at them
When they say

Pick up my dough
Yes'n pay my own way
Fed up with hard times

That wanton fire
Pretty little lips saying higher and higher
Love me
