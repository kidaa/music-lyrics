They say all life
Will end one day
And friends yeah
Forget and die away
Well if fate is cruel
And dims the light
Our love c'mon yeah
Shine on for all right

But oh if you're lonely
And so blue
It's here inside saying

Man for woman
Love's unchained ah yeah
Man for woman
It's insane well

Times precious times
I've lost what I was looking for
And I can see it's true
A change had to come
Well baby

So blue
Looking at you and your wanting me
Man for woman
Love's unchained
C'mon walk with me baby
Man for woman
It's insane

Love's unchained

Well I want to greet you
Believe me I wanna touch too ah yeah
Man without woman
It's a lost lonely time
For love it cam be broken
Yes and love made unkind
