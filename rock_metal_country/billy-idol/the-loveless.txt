Well I know she's waiting for me
Yeah
Outside of society
I know she's sailing for me
Ooo baby
Ran out of society
Yeah dance with me

I said heal me
Hear me
I gotta confess
I'm one of the love love loveless

I know you're hungry for me
Love me
Outside of society yeah
I know you're hungry for me
Believe me baby
Out of rhyme and subtlety

I said heal me
Hear me
I gotta confess
That I'm one of the love love loveless

Yeah hopelessly we look
Into the barrel of a gun
We gotta pull ourselves together
And make a plan
Woah yeah
No control mama
One of the loveless baby
Rockin' tonight

Drunk n' stupid n' naked
Love me
Outside of society
Oooo rancid singin' lonely
Believe me baby
Drunken on sobriety

I said well heal me
Hear me
I gotta confess
I'm one of the love love loveless
I said hear me
Hear me
I gotta confess

That I'm one of the love love loveless
Ah yeah
Love love loveless
No control mama
waiting to be swept away
In your cold black storm
No control
