You and me have a passion
Escaping the days that go by
Just our desire
Patronise a secret painted salon
Let us talk about the live
Where the skins aren't out

But it was O.K.
It was all right
We were, we were
The untouchables tonight
The untouchables tonight

You and me while we're waitin' on a corner
Share a packet of two
With all the fools to savour
We laughed and cried, split our sides
At what they told us

But it will be O.K.
It will be all right
We were, we were
The untouchables tonight
The untouchables tonight

I've coloured my life blue and
Ice diamonds are the line of my life
But time strikes against us
It takes some of us home
Will pick our souls, turn up in you
While it sets me free

All things young and blue, what'll I do
When you're gone too

[Scat]

It'll be O.K.
It'll be all right
If I believe tonight
If I believe we're right
And then we'll be, we'll be
The untouchables tonight
The untouchables tonight
The untouchables tonight
The untouchables tonight
The untouchables tonight
