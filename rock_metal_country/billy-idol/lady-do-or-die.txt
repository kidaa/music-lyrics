What it takes
It takes a dog to cry
What it takes a boy must die
What it takes sometime
Before midnight
What it takes
It takes a life

'Cos I was o' so young
Misshaped before my time
Ride metallic monsters
And there's mud in your eye
For lady do or die

It makes a woman bleed
Can't give her all her needs
Close the door before you leave
Can almost hear her breath
It's a shame "what you've become"
The things I do for love
On this road tonight
Looking for her candlelight
For lady do or die
For lady do or die

Tumbleweed, passing by
Train whistle start to cry
More people start to die
I don't know why
God knows why

I wonder what it takes
To free someone
I wonder what it takes
Free you from your prison

Kings of the road keep travelin' on
Every mile a ragged woe
Kings on the road keep smiling on
Play the guitar and sing the blues and cry
Play the guitar and sing the blues and cry
Play the guitar and sing the blues and cry

For lady do or die
For lady do or die
For lady do or die
For lady do or die

For lady do or die
Play the blues and cry
For lady do or die
Play the guitar
For lady do or die
Sing, sing the blues and cry
For lady do or die...
