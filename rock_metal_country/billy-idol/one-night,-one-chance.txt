One night, one chance, she do most anything,
One night, one chance, she do and dream 
sweet dreams for you.

Woke up in the morning, I said boy, wake up.
Nothing will be done if you don't get up.
Silence is guilty and the truth can talk.
If you got the legs, boy, come on, let's walk.

One night, one chance for you.
She'd dream sweet dreams for me and you.

Take me out this morning, come on, let me sleep.
Been hard pressed to keep it. Better hold on me.
But silence is guilty and the truth be told.
If you got the legs, boys, come on, let's walk.

Is it over One night she dreamed for you.
One night, one chance for you.
One day, one night 
She dreamed sweet dreams for you.

Woke up this mornig and now the dream was 
out of sight.
Prison walls are breakin' down, and my 
threadbare back is whipped right.
Silence is guilty and the truth can talk.
Well yes, I got the legs, boys, and I, 
yes I walked.
And it's over, I'm glad it's over.
Are you glad it's over It's over for one night.

One chance for sweet dreams, oh, for you,
For one night, for one chance of success 
she'll sream and scheme for you.
Oh, oh, one night, oh, one chance she'll
dream sweet dreams for you.
One night, one life too. Her hole existence 
has fallen in two.
