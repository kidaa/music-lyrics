There wasn't a thing to say
As we drove past to the desert way
Through silent seas of sand
Feel time running through my hands
And the sun is burning bright
And the air says life is tight
And my brain says that someone dies
When she shows me the endless lies

And if you're asking why
She said look into the evil eye again
And if you're asking why
She said look into the evil eye again

When are you coming down?
Yes the world you see
Is spinning round
Days are short and lost and found
And the night is long
At the burial ground

And if you're asking why
She said look into the evil eye again
And if you're asking why
She said look into the evil eye again

It's all the same
It's all for nothing?

It's all to blame
It's all for nothin'

In my mind the day is dry
The car of chrome reflects the sky
When she flies all I know my insides hear me cry

Skulls can grin
Vultures spin
Engines whirl
Life begins
Snakes to skin
Blood to drink
And all I know is life begins

And if you're asking why
She said look into the evil eye again
And if you're asking why
She said look into the evil eye again

It's all the same
It's all for nothin'

It's all to blame
It's all for nothin'

It's all the same
It's all for nothin'

It's all to blame
It's all for nothin'

We stood on the ancient bones
With our sacrifice we atoned

For a world now lost in stone
Please come alive for us alone

There wasn't a thing to say
As we drove past to the desert way
Through silent seas of sand
Feel time running through my hands
