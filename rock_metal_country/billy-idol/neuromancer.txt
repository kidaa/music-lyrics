Age of destruction
Age of oblivion
Age of destruction
Age of oblivion

Discovered love,
In the rancid days of ruin
My body's sweatin' toxins,
Of my own demise

Only from space, can you see
How much earth is burning
Smokin' out the innocense inside
The child

It's the age of destruction
In a world of corruption
It's the age of destruction
And they hand us oblivion

Neuromancer and I'm trancing
I'm the Neuromancer--and I'm trancing

Man wallows in his insatiable greed
More in the answer that sweats
From desparate palms
Turn on the lies, the secrets,
Of our desolation,
Or be smothered, by the red hot core

It's the age of destruction,
In a world of corruption
It's the age of destruction
And they hand us oblivion

The neuromancer and I'm trancing
I'm the neuromancer and I'm trancing
I'm the neuromancer--I'm trancing
Trancing
Trancing
and I'm trancing

Denied love in the age of ruin
Suicide toxins of my own demise
In cyberspace, you know how much
The earth ain't learning
Smoking out the man, inside the child--yeah

It's the age of destruction
In a world of corruption
It's the age of destruction
And they hand us oblivion

The neuromancer and I'm trancing
I'm the neuromancer and I'm trancing
Neuromancer--trancing
Neuromancer--trancing
Neuromancer--trancing
Neuromancer

Age of destruction
Age of the neuromancer
Age of destruction
Age of oblivion
Age of destruction
Age of the neuromancer
