Well I feel you right up close to me
That's when I get the shakes all over me
Well it quivers in my backbone
Ooh the shakes in the kneebone
Ooh shakin' in the thighbone
Shakin' all over

I went to see the doctor just the other day
I'm about to tell you what the man had to say
He said well you shiver in your backbone
Ooh the shakin' in the kneebone
Ooh movin' on the backbone
Shakin' all over

Well you, you quivers in your backbone
Ooh the shakes in your kneebone
Well shakin' in the backbone
Yeah, I was
I was
Shakin' all over

Shakin'
Shakin'
Shakin' all over
Shakin'
Shakin'
Shakin' all over
Shakin'
Shakin'
Shakin' all over
