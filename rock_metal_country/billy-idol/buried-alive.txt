It's the season of the dark horse
The ocean of night
It's the angel of mercy
Leaving you behind
In this moment
You ache for the cure
You're pleading
Save me
Give me some more

There's no shelter tonight
Escape from the pain
There is nothing
No end to this game

You're so wicked
Evil and cruel
It won't save you
Save me
From what I'm gonna do

You're just a number
You're just a victim
A dead man walking
Buried alive

Hold out for a better hand
Wait for better days
You can feel it coming
The fury of my rage
My vengeance
Will rain down on you
There's no mercy
Have mercy
In what I'm gonna do
