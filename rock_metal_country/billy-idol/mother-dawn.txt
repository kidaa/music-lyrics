Hold me, hold me
Breathe the light into me
Hold me, hold me
Mother dawn
Mother dawn

Dancing 'round the fire
Circling the flame
Listen to the shadows calling out my name

They say
Rock me like a baby
Cradle me in the light
Bathe me in a rainbow
Sun restore my sight

Hold me, hold me
Breathe the light into me
Hold me, hold me
Mother dawn All night long yeah

Hold me, hold me
Breathe the light into me All night long yeah
Hold me, hold me
Mother dawn

Look into the light

Come and take a journey through the land of night
Darkness strokes the face and
Steals away the sight
Night is all around me
Stars are in my hair
I feel them tangled in the secrets we'll 
find hidden there all right
Reaching through the madness
To the other side
Where the sun is rising
With her arms held wide

Hold me, hold me
Breathe the light into me
Hold me, hold me
Mother dawn All night long yeah
Till the dawn light comes

Hold me, hold me
Breathe the light into me All night long yeah
Hold me, hold me
Mother dawn All night long
I know you're gonna love me
I know you're gonna love me

One star flew against the tapestry of the night
And the earth revolved in perfect symmetry
To a symphony of sun
The moon danced its final bow
As the birth of day
Exploded
In my eyes

Reaching through the madness
To the other side
Where the sun is rising
With her arms held wide

Rock me like a baby
Cradle me in light
You're gonna bathe me in a rainbow
And the sun restore my sight

Hold me, hold me
Breathe the light into me
Hold me, hold me
Mother dawn

Hold me, hold me All night long yeah
Breathe the light into me
Till the dawn light comes yeah
Hold me, hold me All night long yeah
Mother dawn I know you're gonna love me yeah
I know you're
Gonna love me
All night long yeah
Till the dawn light comes
All night long yeah
I know you're gonna love me love me
All night long yeah
Till the dawn light comes
All night long yeah
I know you're gonna love me love me
Mother dawn
