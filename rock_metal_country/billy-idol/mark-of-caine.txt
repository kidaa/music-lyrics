It's Christmas time
And I'm lonely
Here y'know the living
Ain't easy
If you forget
The power to love
I said
"Don't give up"
"Don't give up"
If only I could
See you once again
If only to put
My lips against you again
Don't hold back
The power to love
Don't hold back
From the pluck of the lyre
In the arms of desire

It was dry
And a fine day
When we first came ashore
I wasn't really
Sure what I was looking for
Tracks of my mind
Made the tracks of my arms
Seemed a lot more of a curse
To make matters worse
I was lonely for you
So lonely for you
Baby yeah
So lonely

Oh if I should
See you once again
If only to press
My lips to yours
Aaaaah

Don't give up
The power to love
And don't hold back
The power to love
Don't hold back ah yeah
From the pluck of the lyre
In the arms of desire

And the tracks of my mind
Seemed more like a curse baby

Right there and then
I saw or swore I could see
With my own two eyes
Yo' lying eyes
Yo' lying eyes
Yes right there and then
It made the tracks of my mind
A lot more of a curs
Oh lonely for you
Baby yeah
So lonely for you
Baby yeah
So lonely for you
Baby yeah
And the tracks of my mind
Seemed more like a curse
The tracks of my mind
Seemed more like a curse baby
I was lonely for you
Baby yeah
So lonely for you
Baby yeah
So lonely for you
Baby yeah
