And you say you wanna live forever
And you've got all the time to kill
And you're living in the dark forever
In your own little private hell

I wanna rule this world
I wanna walk the night
I wanna bleed this girl
Wanna shake it all night till the morning light

I wanna lead this world
I wanna wake the dead
And all the undead souls who walk the night

Are you sure you're so clean and pure
As you lie here in front of me now
And you're tempting the lord of darkness
As you see what's forbidden to see

I wanna rule this world
I wanna walk the night
I wanna bleed this girl
Wanna do it all night till the morning light

I wanna rule this world
I'm gonna wake the dead
And all the undead souls who walk the night

Oh yeah you know it's true
Yeah you yeah

When people say I'm from the underworld
Every kind of sin you best belive it girl
You come on over here from the other side
Come back to hell it's warm inside

I sleep through the day coz I'm into the night
I wanna through the day coz I live through the night
I sleep through the day coz I'm into the night
I wanna through the day coz I live through the night

Yeah you

I wanna rule this world, yeah
I'm gonna walk the night
I wanna rule this world
I wanna rule this night

And all the undead souls I wanna wake the dead
I wanna get you girl
I'm gonna rule this world

It's gonna be alright
Yeah
