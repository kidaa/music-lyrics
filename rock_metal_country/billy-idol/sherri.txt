Come home, it's a brand new day
Come home, my Sherri, Sherri runaway
Come on, there's a devil to pay
Come home, my Sherri, Sherri runaway

Sheri's on the run
'Cos no one seems to listen
There's something deep inside
Heartfelt that she's missing
They are no in your shoes
They are no you
Poor fools

You know it's a world of confusion
All usin' and self-abusin'
So...

Come home, it's a brand new day
Come home, my Sherri, Sherri runaway
Come on, there's a devil to pay
Come home, my Sherri, Sherri runaway

"When I'm out having fun
The whole world seems to glisten"
She said
"There's a fire going on
The choppers ain't detecting"
She said
"We have such simple views"
So I must see inside of you
Now that my world is changing
C'mon back, I should be celebrating
So...

Come home, it's a brand new day
Come home, my Sherri, Sherri runaway
Come on, there's a devil to pay
Come home, my Sherri, Sherri runaway

Duckin' in and out
Hiding from authority
Sittin' in a wayside home
I said come back to me

Duckin' in and out
Hiding from authority
Sittin' in a wayside home
I said come back to me

Come home, it's a brand new day
Come home, my Sherri, Sherri runaway
Come on, there's a devil to pay
Come home, my Sherri, Sherri runaway

This is a day in a life as it happens
Play by play, minute by minute
This is the way of life as it happens
Day by day, hour by hour

Come home, it's a brand new day
Come home, my Sherri, Sherri runaway
Come on, there's a devil to pay
Come home, my Sherri, Sherri runaway

Sherri runaway
Sherri runaway
Sherri runaway
Sherri run
Come home
There's a brand new
Brand new day
