We spent the summer running
Scared of what they might do
After we spent the winter crying
In the mist we came all unglued
Sometimes back to school
It seems so sad
And nothing's new
Until I spent the summer running
Just we two
Just we two

I followed you to Zion
The four corners and the redwoods too
The Mesa in Arizona
The Grand Canyon and Las Vegas too
All the bad-brained people
One of these days we'll run over you
And spend the summer running
Just we two
Just we two

I don't walk
I run
Ridin' into the sun
On my motorcycle
We can just blow
I don't know
What's ahead
We don't talk of the dead
On my motorcycle
C'mon let's go

'Cos there's always
There's always
The world you know
The world you know

Well I wear a grim
Smile day after day, baby
As I'm working into our future

Oh yeah

And I take a quick drink
In a world that stinks, baby
'Cos I'm standing up against the furies

Oh yeah

I can escape
I've got a Batman's cape
And I can cover myself, and baby
Yes I'm flying
I'm flying
I'm flying tonight

Oh yeah

Just we two
Runnin' down the highway
Smilin' at the problems
'Cos there's always
There's always
The world you know
The world you know

We spent the summer running
Just we two
Just we two
Just we two
