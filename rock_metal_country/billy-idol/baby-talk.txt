All around the world
I said listen, listen what I say now
For every boy and girl
Wanna hear some happy baby talk

Everything is mine
And mine, mine because I choose you
I lose it everytime
Just to hear some of your baby talk

Ride, ride, don't stop
Babe, baby, babe, baby, baby, baby
All your baby talk
Babe, baby, babe, baby, baby, baby
All your baby talk
Babe, baby, babe, baby, baby, baby
Now your baby talk, baby talk

Everything is mine
And mine, mine because I choose you
I lose it everytime
Just to hear some of your baby talk

Rosy's on my chest
I got Suzy, Suzy's on my arm now
Ride all around the world
Searching for some happy baby talk

Red Hot, don't stop
Babe, baby, babe, baby, baby, baby
All your baby talk
Babe, baby, babe, baby, baby, baby

Got a feeling on my mind
