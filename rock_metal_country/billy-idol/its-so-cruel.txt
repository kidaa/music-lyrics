Here I am again pretty baby
Hanging around
Tonight I've been in every bar in town
Here I am again pretty baby
Hanging around
Tonight I have to try out every girl in town
I took some ecstasy in love

I took my troubles to the East side
I'm getting messed up on my backside
Wall of blocks A-D
Ended up in somebody else's sheets

It's so cruel
I - I - I'm round
Without you, without you babe
It's so cruel
I - I - I'm round
Without you
Will it ever be over baby
Feel my love come on over
Over you

Here you are again
Pretty baby
Hanging around
Tonight you walked through all my pleasant dreams
Here I am
You know where I look leads to a late night
Low down, low down scene
Really mean
Took the subway to the East side
I get messed up on my backside
Wall of blocks A-D
Ended up in somebody else's sheets

It's so cruel
I - I - I'm round
Without you, without you babe
You know what I'm talking about
It's so cruel
I - I - I'm round
Without you
Will it ever be over

Feel my love slide
You know what I'm talking about now
It's so cruel
I - I - I'm round
Without you, without you babe
You know what I'm talking about now
It's so cruel
I - I - I'm round
Without you
Will it ever be over
Feel my love come on over
Over you babe
For you babe, for you babe, for you babe
