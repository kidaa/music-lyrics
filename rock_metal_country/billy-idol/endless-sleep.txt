The night was black rain fallin' down
I looked my baby she's no where aroun'
Chased her footsteps down to the shore
Afraid she's gone for ever more

Well I looked at the sea, seemed to say
I took your baby from you away
I heard a voice cry in the deep
Come join me baby in my endless sleep

Why did we quarrel why did we fight
Why did I leave her alone last night
That's why her foot steps ran down to the sea
That's wy my baby has gone from me

Well I looked at the sea seemed to say
I took your baby from you away
Well I heard a voice cry in the deep
Come join me baby in my endless sleep
Endless sleep

Out in the water heart full of fear
There in the breaker I saw her near
Reached for my darlin' held her to me
Dragged her away from the angry sea

Well I looked at the sea seemed to say
I took your baby from you away
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep
I took your baby from the endless sleep
I grabbed my baby from the endless sleep
