My road is long, it lingers on.
You stare at me and I'm holding on.
My eyes are dim, my breath is weak 
and tears stain my cheeks.
Up there so high where the air is so thin,
You look for signs. Am I giving in
All for me you bring crashing down, 
And still you condemn me.
Oh no no shame. All my life I'll not betray.
I'll not shed one tear for all my life,
For ever more, for ever more.

Sound tow'rs will crumble down, 
I see ev'rything is broken down.
His heart is breaking and recorded in sound.
We need a miracle joy, we need a miracle boy, 
A rock and roll toy, a rock and roll joy, 
a rock and roll boy! 

Now I know what's up for game. 
What's up for grabs, what's down again.
See all for me is crashing down,
The end of ev'rything, ev'ry decent human being.
Oh no no shame. All my life I'll not betray.
I'll shed all my fears all my life, 
For ever more, for ever more.

Sound tow'rs will crumble down, 
Well, ev'rything will be broke down.
See, his heart is breaking and recorded in sound.
We need a miracle joy, we need a rock and roll boy, 
I need a rock and roll joy, a rock and roll toy, 
a rock and roll boy!

The road is long and it lingers on.
But my eyes are dim, my breath is weak 
And tears stain my filthy cheeks.

Sound tow'rs will crumble down, 
I see ev'rything is broken down.
Well my heart is breaking and recorded in sound.
I need a miracle joy, I need a miracle now,
That rock and roll boy!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, I'm hangin' on a miracle tree,
yeah, hangin' like a noose for you and me.
Yeah! Said yeah! Right now!
