Riding down this road 
Like I've riden down a million 
I've run thru the epic rome 
But I can't miss town 
I laughed at all the signs 
They say speed will kill ya' 
A hit of you to slow me down 

And I've forgotten 
How to fly 
But I'll remember 
Before I die 

It's a crooked line I follow 
It's a rocky road I ride 
It's a bitter pill I swallow 
Just to keep you by my side 
Oh my 

I'm driving without sleep
There just ain't no tommorow 
Because misery is always colorblind 
I've taken every remedy for ignorance and sorrow 
Something to cure this wicked mind 

And I've forgotten 
How to fly 
But I'll remember 
Before I die 

It's a crooked line I follow 
It's a rocky road I ride 
It's a bitter pill I swallow 
Just to keep you by my side 
Just to keep you satisfied 

And I've forgotten 
The reason why 
But I'll remember 
Before I die 

It's a crooked line I follow 
It's a rocky road I ride 
It's a bitter pill I swallow 
Just to keep you by my side 
Just to keep you satisfied 

It's a crooked line I follow 
It's a rocky road I ride 
It's a bitter pill I swallow 
Just to keep you by my side 
Just to keep you satisfied 
Just to keep you by my side 
Satisfied 
Satisfied 
It's a wicked world baby 

I'm riding down this road 
Like I've riden down a million 
I've run thru the epic rome 
But I can't miss town 
I laughed at all the signs 
They say speed will kill ya' 
It took you to slow me down 

A hit of you to slow me down 
It took of you to slow me down 

A hit of you to slow me down 
It took of you to slow me down 

A hit of you to slow me down 
It took you to slow me down, baby 

A hit of you to slow me down 
It took you to slow me down
