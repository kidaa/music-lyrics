Cocaine and innocence
And Romeo's waiting
Candies and sugar daddies
They never stop wasting your time
Time to dance to the top
With champagne indifference
And I sit salivating
If I could touch you there
Would you be liberated?
Ah yeah

I don't wanna be
Another enemy
Even though you make be bleed
Like a Kennedy

Not when my body's so exciting
Sometimes you make me
So frustrated
How come it's me I end up hating?
Romeo's waiting
Romeo's waiting
Romeo's waiting
Romeo's waiting
And he don't wanna lose tonight

Blood on the dance floor
And Romeo's fainting
Showing pink and leather tonight
She's dancin' with fear in her eyes
Zero's no hero
But in his mind
He's Lancelot the Knight
And if his lady calls
It'll be so good
'Cos she'll be liberated

I don't wanna be
Another enemy
Even though you make be bleed
Like a Kennedy

Touch my body and it's so exciting
Sometimes you make me
So frustrated
How come it's me I end up hating?
Romeo's waiting
Romeo's waiting
Romeo's waiting

And he don't wanna lose tonight

Well the senses overload
To an L.A. strobe
Yeah, now you got him
Sweatin' he's the
Rebel that you know
Said I love that thing
God, I love ya heave-ho
Now you got him sweatin'
He's the rebel that you know
The rebel that you know
The rebel that you know
The rebel that you know

Sometimes you make me
So frustrated
How come it's me I end up hating?
Romeo's waiting

I don't wanna be
Another enemy
Even though you make be bleed
Like a Kennedy

Touch my body and it's so exciting
Romeo's waiting

I don't wanna be
Another enemy
Even though you make be bleed
Like a Kennedy

Touch my body and it's so exciting
Romeo's waiting
Romeo's waiting
Romeo's waiting now
