For the kids in the schools
And the teachers are fools
And you just want to break

Well you're close to the edge
And you're pissed at your work
And your boss is just a jerk

From promises to preachers
And nothing is Nietzsche
And I can't stand the church

I can have my opinion
And I don't want to win ya
Now I just have to work...alright!

[Chorus]
I feel the whole world comin' down on me [x2]

Well the judge and the jury
They thought they could school me
And teach me the value of thrift

They put me inside on a one ta five
And I just have to quit

Well early in the morning
When we are all balling
I nearly had a fit

It came to my head
And I just had to say
Ain't gonna be nobody's bitch

[Chorus]

Comin' down on me
It's comin' down
It's comin' down, down, down on me

There's only one thing that I can do now
Go lie in the sun, I want to soak up the rays
And burn myself black 'cos cancer day has come
And everything you do to protect yourself
Well it ain't gonna happen right
You junky pimps and mother-fucking whores
Enjoy yourself tonight...alright!

[Chorus]

Comin' down, down on me
It's comin' down
It's comin' down, down, down on me

Comin' down, down on me
It's comin' down
It's comin down, down, down
I feel the whole world
Comin' down, comin' down on me [x3]
I feel the whole world
Comin' down!

Down on me
It's comin' down
It's comin' down, down, down on me
