I'm bathing in warm liquid colour
Feel every cell in my body is music
Floating in hyperspacial sound
Visualizing the landscapes of my mind
I'm opening the door to inner space
I'm feeling the vibrasound

We can live forever
We can live forever
Strike that gong
We can live forever
Our love can live forever
In shangrila

Transform with inner guidance
To a place of peace and paradise
Oh what a feeling
Relax let your thoughts drift away
Oh what a feeling
Live in belief and harmony
Chance of freedom

We can live forever
We can live forever
Stike that gong
We can live forever
Our love can live forever
In shangrila om
In shangrila om

Access your new state of mind
Dedication discipline
Searching the sensory science
Has resulted in shangrila

We can live forever
Forever & ever & ever
We can live forever
Our love could live forever
In shangrila
We can live forever
Forever & ever & ever
We can live forever
Strike that gong
We can live forever
In shangrila om

A piece of a dream
The color of green
The color of healing
In shangrila
Color of love
In shangrila
I feel the sacred healing chants

I feel the moment
Of my death
I feel the higher learning
I feel the realization of forgiveness
Compassion and loving kindness
Om
