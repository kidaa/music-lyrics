A time warp scene
A cy-fi story
A dirt coloured love
Hey hope for glory
I like to fight,
I kill global oppression
If I quit, no hope of redemption

Blue eyes crying in the rain
For how long
Tomorrow people
I laugh tomorrow gone
For how long
Tomorrow people
Tomorrow people

Well you know I'm free on arrival
Left behind my babe, by guilt of survival
I don't know where I'm runnin' to
I lost my love, lost my hold,
I lost my heaven too

Blue eyes crying in the rain
For how long
Tomorrow people
I laugh tomorrow gone
For how long
Tomorrow people

Blue eyes crying in the rain
For how long
Tomorrow people
I laugh tomorrow gone
For how long, soon come
Tomorrow people
Tomorrow people
Yah come on loud

Now my life is truly misspent
I said
I'm here to tell you, to tell you
That I won't repent
World War III
Death pain
It's fate lets do it again
Tomorrow man
Tomorrow people
Tomorrow man
Tomorrow people
Tomorrow man

A time warp scene
A ci-fy story Tomorrow people
A dirt coloured sky Tomorrow people
New hope for glory

I like to fight
I kill global oppression
Tomorrow people
When I quit, new hope for redemption
Tomorrow people

Blue eyes crying in the rain
Tomorrow people
I laugh tomorrow gone
Tomorrow people
Tomorrow people
Tomorrow people
Tomorrow people
Tomorrow people
