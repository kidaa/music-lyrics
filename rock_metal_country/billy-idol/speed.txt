Running from the nightmare
In the middle of the road
Hell's no place for sleeping
In a world beyond control
Caught in the headlights
Coming after you
When I woke up this morning
I had to do what I gotta do
Blast me to Heaven for loving you
Blast me to Heaven for loving you

Speed
Give me what I need
Yeah
White lightning
Let's speed, on speed
On wheels, on wheels
Speed
Oh, let it bleed
Yeah
Greased lightning
Let's speed, on speed
On wheels, on wheels

I've seen a train full of pain
On the edge of overload
We're in Heaven, baby
You are gonna implode
I've got these crazy feelings
That I can't explain
I've gotta save you baby
Or I'll die in vain
Blast me to Heaven for loving you
I said blast me to Heaven just for loving you

I said speed
Give me what I need
Yeah
White lightning
Let's speed, on speed
On wheels, on wheels
Speed
Oh, let it bleed
Yeah
Greased lightning
Let's speed, on speed
On wheels, on wheels

Blast me to Heaven for loving you
I said blast me to Heaven for loving you

Now I'm rushing on the run, yeah
I wanna have me some fun
I'll speed
Give me what I need
Oh, set me free
Let's speed
On wheels, on wheels, on wheels
Said speed
Oh, let it bleed
Yeah
White lightning
Let's speed, on speed
On wheels, on wheels
Com'on

I said speed, speed
Give me what I need
I said speed, speed
Give me what I need
Alright
