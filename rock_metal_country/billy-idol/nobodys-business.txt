What a fool to step into those shoes
Either way you know they win or lose
You know money talks
Your eyes they ain't so blue
You love to watch the green-backs walk
You got a five-buck side-pack

Tell me, tell me someone stop this pain
It's your place I was in a rage insane
I wanted your love so bad
But your eyes are never blue
Droolin' over green-back poolin'
You got a five-buck side-pack

Well I must have been right about something
Yes to make it to here and to tell you something
Cause nobody's business but my own
Nobody's business but my own
Well I must have been mad about something
Cause I'm M A D and I spell it for nothing
Cause nobody's business but my own
Nobody's business but my own

What a fool to step into those shoes
Either way you know they you win or lose
You know money talks
Your eyes so paralysed
Don't you realise
For love and hate it's just too late
Nobody's business but my own
Nobody's business but my own
Nobody's business but my own
Nobody's business but my own
Nobody's business but my own
