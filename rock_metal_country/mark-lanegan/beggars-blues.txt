Night train, silver moon
You ask me why, I'm flyin'
To float on ashen wings
To choke on dust and feather
I learned you are a liar
It's right we should pretend
And lie with one another
It's right we should be twins
For I have loved no other
Look for me baby
Well I'm draggin' lonliness
And it's ten miles long
I thought I heard you scream baby
In the wheels of a train that crawls
When I don't wanna go
Cause you forget me when I'm gone, whoa
Look for me baby
Whenever ice is glistening upon the glass
D'ya ever find your dream baby
Well God knows I never hear mine close enough
I watched 'em slip away like this, whoa
I've been from one end of this street to the other
Now I want the gifts ya promised me lover
Look for me baby
Crow fly by with sister and brother
Deadly as a kiss, a sin to one another
Look for me baby
Well I'm draggin' lonliness and it's ten miles long
I thought I heard you scream baby
In the wheels of a train that crawls
And I don't wanna go
Cause you forget me when I'm gone, whoa
Night train, silver moon
You ask me why am I flyin'
To float on ashen wings
To choke on dust and feather
My dreams will go no further
Won't calm my violent river
Oh guardian of peace
Let the beggar walk in the winter
Look for me baby
Look for me baby
Look for me baby
Look for me baby
that's all
