Lanegan/Johnson/Richards
We came to walk on this boulevard love
Don't care where we're goin'
While it's true in time, we might close our eyes
This won't die
Now we stop by the oceanside love
You are all I see
And it isn't wrong, that we don't belong
Anymore
We came to walk on this boulevard love
I don't care where we're goin'
While it's true in time, we might close our eyes
This won't die
