Buck Owens
Together again
My tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights
Are now at an end
The keys to my heart
You hold in your hand
And nothing else matters
We're together again
Together again
The grey skies are gone
You 're back in my arms
Now where you belong
The love that I knew
Is living again
And nothing else matters
We're together again
And nothing else matters
We're together again
