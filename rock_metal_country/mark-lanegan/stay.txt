Lanegan/Johnson
The heart will pound until the breath is gone
You know what I love so, put me on
Something has badly gone wrong with me
Livin's not hard, it's just not easy
Always keepin' the dogs off
Down like the rain, down like the rain
Comin' down like the rain, comin' down
Oh I wanna be there, by your side
Cause this feels like dyin' baby
Let me stay around, let me stay around
You take my heart, and my breath is gone
You know what I love so, put me on
Feel a little light-headed, you know I'd have to be
Believin' ain't hard, it's just not easy
Stayin' blind to the obvious
Down like the rain, down like the rain
Comin' down like the rain, comin' down
Oh I wanna be there, by your side
Cause this feels like dyin' baby
Let me stay around, let me stay around
