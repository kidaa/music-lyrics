You take me back to the place where I cease to exist
To find in a kiss
Somethin' I've missed
You burn away my disguise and galaxies fall
Because of this 
Because of this
It hurt
God knows that it does
And when it hurts sometimes
You're there to quiet my mind
Because of this
Because of this
You pry open my eyes
I resist but you do
And when I stumble and bleed
You give your body to me
Because of this 3x's
Because of this 2x's
Oh and it hurts sometimes
Cause you're there to quiet my mind
You take me back to the place where I cease to exist
To find in your kiss
Something I've missed
You burn away my disguise
And the heavens fall
Because of this
Because of this
And it hurts
God knows that it does
But when I stumble and bleed
You give your body to me
Because of this 4x's
