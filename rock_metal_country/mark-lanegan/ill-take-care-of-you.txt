Brook Benton
I know you've been hurt
By someone else
I can tell by the way
You carry yourself
But if you'll let me
Here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I loved and lost
Same as you
So you see I know
Just what you've been through
So if you'll let me
Here's what I'll do
I got to take care of you
You won't ever have to worry
You won't ever have to cry
I'll be there beside you
To dry your weeping eyes
So darlin' tell me
That you'll be true
'Cause there's no doubt in my mind
I know what I want to do
And just as sure as
One and one are two
I just got to take care of you
I'll take care of you
I'll take care of you
