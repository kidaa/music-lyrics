I'll tell you how I woke up on the line
My sister I almost saw the light
Look my hands are tied
I'll see you in another hallway
Some other time
Well I don't understand this big parade
It's a five star decoration day
Look my hands are stained 
I was washin' 'em the water
Well the water fell away
I'll tell you how I woke up on the line
Sorry for a soul in heaven passin' by
Look my hands are tied
I will see you in another station
Some other time
