Goodbye my friend I hate to see you go
You brought me down the stars
The last one in the world
I hear you cry
But let's not waste this night
The last one in the world
Within your lonely room
I hear you whisper see you soon
I sense a dying spark
I watch you falling through the dark
Goodbye my friend, thank you for the dream
The last one in the world
I hear you cry
But let's not waste this night
The last one in the world
And I listen to you call
I hardly hear you at all
I walk the quiet night
Watch the river rolling by
The last one in the world 4x's
