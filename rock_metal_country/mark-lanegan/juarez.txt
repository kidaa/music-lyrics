Lanegan/Fisk
Night train is groovy
An orange jubilee
Feels good comin' and goin'
I'm warm all over me
Fire up the crack boys
And tie off my arm
Cinch up my diaper
Turn the TV on
Give me another blow job
Before I'm on the nod
Say you'll always love me and
Never do me harm 
Never do me harm
Never do me harm
Well you're a preacher's daughter
And I'm a bastard's son...
