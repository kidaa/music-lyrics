Here ya are, at the top of the tower
Could a body take that much
Alone through every waking hour
Asleep without nobody to touch
Whoa,whoa,whoa,and
Only silence here
Whoa,whoa,whoa,and
Lonely silence here
And I'm not the one
Make your house a home
Makes no sense to stay
Through one more lonely last day
Oh no babe, it's not right
Here ya are, cryin' in the night
Could a body take that much
Find yourself standin' outside
You ain't got nobody to touch
Whoa,whoa,whoa,and
There's only silence here
Whoa,whoa,whoa, and
There's only silence here
And I'm not the one
make your house a home
Makes no sense to stay
Through one more lonely last day
oh no babe, it's not right
