traditional
Went out last night, take a little round
Met little Sadie and I blowed her down
Then I run right home and went to bed
With a forty-four smokeless under my head
The girls all heard little Sadie was dead
They went home to be ragged in red
Come a slippin' and a slidin' down the street
In their loose mother hubbards and their stocking feet
Well I began to think what a deed I'd done
Grabbed my hat and I started to run
I made a good run just a little too slow
And they overtook me in Jericho
Standing on the corner reading a bill
Up stepped the sheriff of Thomasville
Said young man is your name Lee Brown?
Remember the night you blowed Sadie down?
Yes I said my name is Lee
I murdered little Sadie in a first degree
First degree and a second degree
If ya got any papers, read 'em to me
Took me downtown, dressed me in black
Put me on a train and send me back
Didn't have no one to go on my bail
Throw me back in the county jail
Judge and the jury took their stand
Judge had the papers in his hand
Forty-one days and forty-one nights
Forty-one years just to wear them stripes
