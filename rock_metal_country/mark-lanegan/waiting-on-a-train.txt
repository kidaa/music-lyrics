Lanegan/Johnson
It's time that I was leavin'
Shoulda left here long ago
You'd rather see me sorry
Than knowin' what I know
I wish it was asleep instead
Of hangin' here up above my head
I'm cryin'
In the winter time goin'
Pull all my shit together
Try for another breath
Lonely livin' sorrow
Holdin' on like death
From the play of lights below 
Is that church bells ringin' or my whistle blowin'
I don't care
I'm gone
Shootin' up and down the tracks
Mornin' comes, cold chills and shakes
Just remindin' me of my mistake
Well alright
Now get your smell off of me mama
It's time that I was leavin'
I left here long ago
You'd rather see me sorry
Than knowin' what you know
Wish it was asleep instead
Of hangin' here up above my head
Lady
Lady midnight crawlin'
Just waitiing on a train
