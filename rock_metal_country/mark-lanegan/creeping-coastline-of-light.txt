The Leaving Trains
Leaving Hollywood
Sunset to the sea
Where the waves
Ride in on horses
I'm looking for her light
Creeping coastline of lights
The seas and the trees
Calling me
She's a river between day and night
I'm looking for her light
Creeping coastline of lights
She's comin down 
From her mountian
Shinin white light 
Like a fountain
And I'm lookin for her light
Creeping coastline of lights
And I'm lookin for her light
Creeping coastline of lights
