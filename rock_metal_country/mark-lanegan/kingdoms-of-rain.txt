Are those halos in your hair
Or diamonds shining there
Without a hope, without a prayer
This rain beats down like death
You turn your eyes to better men
Before I go I'll hang in a cross on nails
I hung on for you in there
Girl lay your shame to rest
Hope lies close to your breast
You stoop to feed the crows
Some scraps of truth already cold
Before I go, I'll hang in a cross on nails
I hung on for you in there
And every kingdom of rain comes fallin' down
Cause I loved you somewhat
Cause I loved you somewhat
Would you put halos in your hair
Without a hope without a prayer
With lies close to your breast
You finally lay your shame to rest
Before I go, I'll hang in a cross on nails
I hung on for you in there
And every kingdom of rain comes fallin' down
Cause I loved you so long 
cause I loved you so long
Cause I loved you so long
