My girl, my girl, don't lie to me 
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun never shines
I would shiver all night through
Her husband was a hard-workin' man
Til a mile and a half from here
His head was found in a dried up well
And his body never was found
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun never shines
I would shiver all night through
Shiver for me now
My girl, my girl, where will you go
I'm goin' where the cold winds blow
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver all night through
