Gun Club/Jeffrey Lee Pierce
Come down to the willow garden with me
Come go with me
Come go and see
Although I've howled across fields and my eyes turned grey
Are yours still the same
Are you still the same
Carry home
I have returned
Through so many highways 
And so many tears
Your letter never survived the heat of my hand
My buring hand
My sweating hand
Your love never survived the heat of my heart
My violent heart 
In the dark
Carry home 
I have returned
Through so many highways
And so many tears
Come down to the willow garden with me
Come go with me
Come go and see
Although I've howled across fields and my eyes turned grey
Are yours still the same
Are you still the same
