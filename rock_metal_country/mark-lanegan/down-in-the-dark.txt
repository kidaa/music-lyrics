Baby, you're goin' down in the dark
Show my lonely night is fallin'
I don't have very long
I think my blood might boil
Then my veins might burn
And you're gonna make it better for a little while
Baby, you're gonna die someday
See you when you're crawlin', wasted
Then you'll start to fade
That won't be so I'm sinkin' faster
I wouldn't wait so long
It won't get any easier in the dark
Oh yeah
You will
You will
You will
You will
You will
Baby, you're goin' down in the dark

You will 11x's
