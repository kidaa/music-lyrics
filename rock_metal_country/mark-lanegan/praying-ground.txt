Lanegan/Johnson/Richards
Not feelin' any pain
But I know that it's real
Never see the color of the day
In the darkness I kneel
Prayin' for sleep
Prayin' that it will come easy
But there's something else
I see it miles away
Don't know what time of year it is
I can remember the fall
Yet all my strange and simple games
Play out on top of a wall
Prayin for sleep
Prayin' for something so easy
If only the moon
Would have left me alone
