Tim Hardin
It is so cold in Shiloh town
Birds can hardly sing
Pretty girls gonna leave the town
They won't be back 'till spring
War is done they've come back home
But they're the ones that lost
See a man and a woman alone
Was it worth the cost?
I'll sing hallelujah 
You'll sing hallelujah
We'll all sing hallelujah
When they arrive at home
Sun is out it's hot to today
Children all come out to play
Some are quick to come back home
Others, gone to stay
Gets so cold in Shiloh town
Birds can hardly sing
Pretty girls gonna leave the town
They won't be back 'till spring
I'll sing hallelujah 
You'll sing hallelujah
We'll all sing hallelujah
When they arrive at home
