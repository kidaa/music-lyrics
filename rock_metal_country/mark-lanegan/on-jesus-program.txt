On Jesus' program
I'll  wade out in the deep
Oh yes I will
On Jesus' program
Oh I cannot sleep
On Jesus' program
The Holy Spirit will creep
I know he'll take me, shake me
Make me what I have to be
On Jesus' program 
I'm working for Christ
Oh yes I am
On Jesus' program
I know someday I'll rise
On Jesus' program
To mansions in the sky
Where I'll be free to live on
To live on 
Eternally
I'm workin
On the program
Every day
When this life 
Is all over
I'm going home
When this life 
Is all over
I'm going home
