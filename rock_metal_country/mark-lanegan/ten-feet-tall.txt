Lanegan/Johnson
I see they're comin'
Just tell me it ain't true
How lonely sorrow, and I fall back to you
One time or another
Like I want
She is alone, and I don't walk that tall
Memories amounting, to nothin' I can't keep
Just as soon forgotten
Hate is all, that her tears ever show
Saying sing, well come on black cat sing
Hate is gone, drippin' lies from the tongue
Demanding my all, well I don't walk that tall
I see they're comin'
Just tell me it ain't true
Head down in sorrow and I, stumble back to you
One time or another
You might find
Hate is all, that her tears ever show
Sayin' sing, well come on black cat sing
I don't walk that tall
I don't walk that tall
