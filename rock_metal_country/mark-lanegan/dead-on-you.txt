You were a ragged
Turquoise and twilight coat
I got my head hung down for you
Some day you're gonna need it
But it's worn or the, cloth gets torn
And there's only one way to go
It's gone dead, dead
It's gone dead on you
Take off your ragged
Turquoise and twilight coat
I got my head hung down for you
Someday you're gonna need it
But it's worn or the, cloth gets torn
And then there's only on way to go
It's goin' dead, dead
It's going dead, dead
It's goin' dead on you
