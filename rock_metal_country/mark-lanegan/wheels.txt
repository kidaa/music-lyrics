Light ahead, proves that the wheels broke down
Here I am, still hangin' on
Well alright
Shadows only disappear
Just look around there's no one here
A little spirit turned my light on out and now
Can never be no doubt
You got to walk in the morning sun
And got to smile at everyone
Go my love on your way, to bigger and
Bright better days
And I'll go crazy for it all
And I won't stop lovin' you baby
Oh yeah here I am
This feeling inside a body
Light ahead, proves that the wheels broke down
Here I am, still spinnin' round
Shadows only disappear
Just look around there's no one here
A little spirit turned my light on out and now
Can never be no doubt
I'm gonna wait til the stars come down
My little love smiles on a wing
For all a raindrop and tears not wasted there
Been pourin' down all day
Runnin' round catchin' 'em baby
Run around catchin' 'em baby
Whichever way they fall
Won't stop lovin' you baby
Whichever way you go
Oh yeah
Here I am
Here I am
Just runnin' round catchin' 'em
Whichever way they fall
