Lanegan/Johnson
You hear them call your name
From your room
Far removed
Don't let 'em use you in, every way
Stay unchained
Around and round you go
They'll never know, what you've seen
Why have you turned away
You can believe, believe in me
Couldn't you try one time
See if they'll run, for a while
It's a solitary star
Shining precious light
Light on me
When I see your eyes
Tell me what you find
But I oughtta know, by now
Did you hear them call your name
From your room
Far removed
I'd only use you in, every way
Stay unchained
It's a solitary star
Shining precious light
