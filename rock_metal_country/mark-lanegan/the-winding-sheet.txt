Lanegan/Johnson
Saw God staring from the wall
I was alone and lost
Here to take me from this world
Still alone and lost
Night when the dogs from hell come out
Roam my house in chains of gold
The darkness dares my eyes to close
Saw a ghost in the shadows smile
I was sick in my soul
All tied up in a winding sheet
Still sick in my soul
Night when the dogs from hell come out
Roam my house in chains of gold
The darkness dares my eyes to close
With the setting sun3x's
Tired I lay me back on thorns
Full of fear in my head
Lay me back so I could not rise
Full of fear in my head
Night when the dogs from hell come out
Roam my house in chains of gold
The darkness dares my eyes to close
With the setting sun
Rose with the setting sun
With the setting sun
The night is born, my time has come
With the setting sun 
With the setting sun
Jesus touch my hand
Please touch my hand
Please touch my hand
With the setting sun
