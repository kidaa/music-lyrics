Lanegan/Johnson
See through the eyes of a child
And it won't be real
Eyes neither hateful or cruel
No lies conceal
Eyes that wander, eyes that strayed
While the shame in your heart
Remains
Cryin' were the eyes of a child
In pain, tonight
Tears that I bled on you
From the heart of an angel of fear, tonight
We can wander, we could stray
But the shame remains
See through the eyes of a child
And it won't be real
I have loved your eyes
Neither hateful or cruel
No lies conceal
We could wander, we could stray
But the shame, has remained
Has remained
It has remained
