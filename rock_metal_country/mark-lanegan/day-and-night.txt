Lanegan
Early morning, I don't mind
That's when I find you
Find you under orange skies
I'm gonna try and shine
Blue drownin' days
Thought I might go crazy
Blue lonesome nights away
Early evening, I don't mind
That's when I find you
Find you under orange skies
Makin' me try and shine
Blue drownin' days
Thought I was insane
Blue lonesome nights away
