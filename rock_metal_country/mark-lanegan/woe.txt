Lanegan
We got some poison in us
Cyanide and nicotine
More than you've ever seen
More than I can believe
Woe, woe, woe, woe
Guns guns they all got guns
Now they wanna shoot someone
I'd rather be drunk than dead
Or go where Jesus fled
So I'll get drunk again
Or maybe not
Woe, woe, woe, woe
I saw on a tombstone
He came in this world alone
Spent all his time alone
He left this life alone
Woe, woe, woe, woe
