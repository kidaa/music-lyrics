Lanegan/Johnson
Water will forgive me, I'm just tryin' to forget
Starin' at the water as the waves turn ruby red
Remembering
Fear and paranoia run together in my dreams
Water will accept me give me a peace I've never seen
Remembering
Wrap your arms around me
And I'm as light as anything
Through the air I can't breathe
Your lips form a curious smile 
Water will forgive me for everything I never should
Water will accept me for all the things I never could
Wrap your arms around me
And I'm as light as anything
Through the air I can't breathe
