I am my own parasite
I don't need a host to live
We feed off of each other
We can share our endorphns
Doll steak, test meat

I won my own pet virus
I get to pet and name her
Her milk is my shit
My shit is her milk

Doll steak, test meat
Look on the bright side is suicide
Lost eyesight I'm on your side
Angel left wing, right wing, broken wing
Lack of iron and/or sleeping
Protector of the kennel
Ecto-plasma
Ecto-Skeletal
Obituary birthday
Your scent is still here in my place of recovery
