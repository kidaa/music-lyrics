Somebody finally freed my brother
One more day to free my brother
Help me I won't find a way, no

I'm going there to free my brother
No one there to free my brother Don't go there to free my brother
Help me I won't find a way, brother

He's the friend to revive
With all the love I got
In every way I love you In every way I'll help you
Help me know

Going my way
