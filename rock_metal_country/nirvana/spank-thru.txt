This song is for the lovers and the mountains
And the little lights in the trees
And all the flowers have gingivitis
And the birds fly happily
We are together once again my love
I need you back, oh baby, baby
I can't explain just why we lost it from the start
Living without you girl, you'll only break my heart...

Yeah!
I can feel it! i can hold it! i can mend it! i can shape it!
I can mold it! i can cut it! i can taste it! i can spank it!
Smack it! Beat it! Masturbate it!

I've been looking for days now
Always hearing the same ol
City boy won't you spank thru
I can make it do things you won't think it ever could

I can feel it! i can hold it! i can mend it! i can shape it!
I can mold it! i can cut it! I can taste it! And spank it!
Smack it! Beat it! Masturbate it!

I've been looking for days now
Always hearing the same ol
City boy won't you spank thru
I can make it do things you won't think it ever could

I've been looking for day glow
Always hearing the same ol
City boy won't you spank thru
I can make it do things you won't think it ever could
You won't think it ever could
