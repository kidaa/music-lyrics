Afraid to grade. Wouldn't it be fun 
Cross, self-loss. Wouldn't it be fun 
Wet your bed. Wouldn't it be fun 
Some feel none. 
Wouldn't it be fun

Your eyes, teacher said [x3]
Preacher said. 
Don't have nothing for you [x7]

Spell the smell. Wouldn't be fun 
Search for a church. Wouldn't be fun 
Wet you bed. 
Wouldn't be fun Cold and coals. 
Wouldn't be fun.

Your eyes, teacher said [x2]
Your eyes, preacher said. 
Preacher said. Don't have nothing for you [x7]

[Solo]

Don't have nothing for you [x9]
