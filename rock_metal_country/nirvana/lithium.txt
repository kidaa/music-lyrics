I'm so happy.
Cause today I found my friends. 
They're in my head.
I'm so ugly.
But that's ok. 'Cause so are you.
We've broke our mirrors. 
Sunday morning.
Is everyday for all I care. And I'm not scared.
Light my candles.
In a daze cause I've found god.

Yeah [x bunch of times]

I'm so lonely.
And that's ok. I shaved my head.
And I'm not sad.
And just maybe.
I'm to blame for all I've heard. And I'm not sure. 
I'm so excited.
I can't wait to meet you there. 
And I don't care.
I'm so horny.
But that's ok. My will is good.

Yeah [x bunch of times]

[Chorus]
I like it. 
I'm not gonna crack. 
I miss you. 
I'm not gonna crack. 
I love you. 
I'm not gonna crack. 
I kill you. 
I'm not gonna crack. [x2]

I'm so happy.
Cause today I found my friends. 
They're in my head.
I'm so ugly.
But that's ok. 'Cause so are you.
We've broke our mirrors. 
Sunday morning.
Is everyday for all I care. And I'm not scared.
Light my candles.
In a daze cause I've found god.

Yeah [x bunch times]

[Chorus]...
