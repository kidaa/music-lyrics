Monkey see, monkey do I don't know why. 
I'd rather be dead than cool. I don't know why. 
Every line ends in rhyme I don't know why. 
Less is more, love is blind I don't know why.

Stay. Stay away [x3]

Give an inch, take a smile I don't know why.
Fashion shits, fashion stile I don't know why. 
Throw it out and keep it in I don't know why. 
Have to have poison skin I don;t know why.

Stay. Stay away [x3]

I don't know why. I don't know why. 
I don't know why. Stay. Stay away [x3]

Monkey see, monkey do I don't know why. 
I'd rather be dead than cool. I don't know why. 
Every line ends in rhyme I don't know why. 
Less is more, love is blind I don't know why.

Stay. Stay away [x3]

I don't know why. I don't know why. 
I don't know why. Stay. Stay away [x3]

Stay. Stay away [x5]
God is gay!
