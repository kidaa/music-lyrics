I will never bother you 
I will never promise to 
I will never follow you 
I will never bother you 

Never speak a word again 
I will crawl away for good 

I will move away from here 
You wont be afraid of fear 
No thought was put in to this 
I always knew it would come to this 

Things have never been so swell 
I have never failed to feel 
Pain [3x]

You Know your Right [3x]

I'm so warm and calm inside 
I no longer have to hide 
Let's talk about someone else 
The stinging soon begins to mount
Nothing really bothers her 
She just wants to love herself 

I will move away from here 
You wont be afraid of fear 
No thought was put into this 
I always knew to come like this 

Things have never been so swell 
I have never failed to feel 
Pain [5x]

You know Your Right [17x]

Pain [1x]
