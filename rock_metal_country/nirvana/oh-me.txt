If i had to lose a mile
If i had to touch feelings
I would lose my soul
The way i do

I don't have to think
I only have to do it
The results are always perfect
And that's old news

Would you like to hear my voice
Sprinkled with emotion
Invented at your birth

I can't see the end of me
My whole expanse, i cannot see
I formulate infinity
Stored deep inside me

same again
Infiny inside me
