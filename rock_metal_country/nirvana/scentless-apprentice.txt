Like most babies smell like butter
his smell smelled like no other
he was born scentless and senseless
he was born a scentless apprentice

Go away - get away, get away, get a-way
every wet nurse refused to feed him
electrolytes smell like semen

I promise not to sell your perfumed secrets
there are countless formulas for pressing flowers

I lie in the soll and fertilize mushrooms
Leaking out gas fumes are made into perfume

You can't fire me because I quit
Throw me in the fire and I won't throw a fit
