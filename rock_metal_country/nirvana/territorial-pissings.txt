Come on people now. Smile on your brothers. 
Everybody get together. Try to love another right now.

When I was an alien. Cultures weren't opinions.

[Chorus]
Gotta find a way. To find a way. 
When I'm here. Gotta find a way. A better way. 
I had better wait.

Never met a wise man. If so it's a woman.

[Chorus]...

Just because you're paranoid. 
Don't mean they're not after you.

[Chorus... x2]
