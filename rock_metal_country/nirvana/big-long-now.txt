It's not cold enough
please put his side up
she is moon gray
can we show our faces now

I'm not in a string
she's not turning gray
simple as it seems
can we show our faces now

endless climb
I am blind
what can I hear
call a lie
speaking a phrase
instantly grown
I am blind
waiting in line
[again, substituting 'why am I sure' as the last line]
