They need a lifetime that is comfortable. 
They travel far to keep their stomach's full.
They make a living off of arts and crafts. 
The kind with sea shells. Driftwood, and burlap. 
They make a deal when they come to town. 
The Sunday swap meet is a battle ground. 
She loves him more than he will ever know. 
[Third repetition:] She loves him more than she will ever know
He loves her more than he will ever show.

Keeps his cigarettes close to his heart. 
Keeps her photographs close to her heart. 
[Second repetition:] Keeps her photographs close his heart
Keep the bitterness close to the heart. [x3]
