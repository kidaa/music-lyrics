Sell the kids for food. Weather changes moods. 
Spring is here again. Reproductive glands.

[Chorus]
He's the one who likes all the pretty songs. 
And he likes to sing along.
And he likes to shoot his gun. 
But he knows not what it mean. 
Knows not what it mean. 
And I say yeah. [x2]

We can have some more. Nature is a whore. 
Bruises on the fruit. Tender age in bloom.

[Chorus x2]
