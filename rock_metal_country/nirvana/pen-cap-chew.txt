Ummm, lies again
Ummm, mine
Ummm, mmmm

You go, you give, you get, you get to me
All the years of tyrants such an easy way to go
You go, you give, you get, you get to me
Time to struggle and the scaling of fingernails

Ummm, lies again
Ummm, mine
Ummm, mmmm

You're lonely

Waste your time by saying he was gullible
Give up all additions in there where it's cold
Push that gate, it is the age of red eye shame
Protest swine, go to jail, the travesty

Two minutes slow...slow...slow...oh
