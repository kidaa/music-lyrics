Silence, here I am. I am, silence.
Bright and clear, it's what I am. Silence, I am.
Mother, father. Father, mother.
Death and violence. Exicitement, I am.
Dyin', lyin'. Dyin', fo to hell---aaoohh!
Mother, no was. No mas, Mama.
Still, silence. I am, hurt again. Imagine that, crime.
Here I am, chargin'.
Dead.
Die.
