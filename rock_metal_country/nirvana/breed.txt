I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. 
I don't care. Care if I'm old. I don't mind. 
I don't mind. I don't mind. I don't mind. Mind.
Don't have a mind. Get way. Get way. Get way. 
Get way. Way from your home. I'm afraid. I'm afraid. 
I'm afraid. I'm afraid. Afraid of a ghost.

Even if you have. Even if you need. 
I don't mean to stare. We don't have to breed. 
We can plant a house. We can build a tree. 
I don't even care. We could all three.
