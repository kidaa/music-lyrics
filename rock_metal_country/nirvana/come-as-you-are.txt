Come, as you are. As you were. 
As I want you to be. As a friend. 
As a friend. As an old enemy. Take your time. 
Hurry up. The choice is yours. Don't be late. 
Take a rest. As a friend. As a old memory, memory, memory, memory.

Come. Dowsed in mud. Soaked in bleach.
As I want you to be. As a trend. As a friend. 
As an old memory, memory, memory, memory.

And I swear that I don't have a gun. 
No I don't have a gun. No I don't have a gun.

Memory, memory, memory, memory don't have a gun.

And I swear that I don't have a gun. 
No I don't have a gun. No I don't have a gun.
No I don't have a gun. No I don't have a gun. Memory, memory...
