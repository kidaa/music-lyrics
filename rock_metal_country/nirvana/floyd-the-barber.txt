Bell on door clanks, come on in.
Floyd observes my hairy chin.
Sit down chair don't be afraid.
Steamed hot towel on my face.

I was shaved [X3]

Barney ties me to the chair.
I can't see I'm really scared.
Floyd breaths hard I hear a zip,
Pee-pee pressed against my lips.

I was shamed [X3]

I sense others in the room opie aunt bee I presume.
They take turns and cut me up.
I died smothered in Andy's butt

I was shaved [X3]
