Truth covered in security. 
I can't let you smother me. 
I'd like to but it wouldn't work. 
Trading off and taking turns. 
I don't regret a thing.

I've got this friend, you see. 
Who makes me fell. And I wanted more Than I could steal. 
I'll arrest myself. And wear a shield. 
I'll go out of my way To prove I still Smell her on you.

Don't tell me what I wanna hear. 
Afraid of never knowning fear. Experience anything you need.
I'll keep fighting jealousy. Until it's fucking gone.

I'll go out of my way to make you a deal. 
We've make a pact to learn from who. Even we want. 
Whitout new rules. We'll share what's lost and what we grew. 
They'll go out for their way to prove they still smell her on you. 
They still, smell her on you. Smell her on you.
