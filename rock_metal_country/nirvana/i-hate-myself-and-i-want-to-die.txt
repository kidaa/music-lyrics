Running nose and runny yolk
Even if you have a cold still
You can cough on me again
I still haven't had my full fill

In the someday...What's that sound
End it someday...What's that song

Broken heart and broken bones
Finger pressing down the hoarse pills

One more quirky cliched phrase
You're the one I wanna refill

Words are brokenlives
Five pieces of board turned around
Attached to the skull by common wood screws
A child would like to do it
