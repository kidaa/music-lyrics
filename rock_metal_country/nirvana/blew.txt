If you wouldn't mind, I wouldn't like it blew. 
If you wouldn't mind, I wouldn't like it lose. 
If you wouldn't care, I wouldn't like to leave. 
If you wouldn't mind, I wouldn't like to breathe. 

Is there another reason for your staying 
Could you believe him when you distrust his stain 
Here is another word that rhymes with shame. 

[Repeat]...

You could do anything.
