Mom and dad went to a show
droped me off a Grandpa Joe's
I kicked and screamed, said please, oh no

chorus
Grandma take me home
I wanna be alone

Had to eat my dinner there
had mashed potato's and stuff like that
couldnt chew my meat too good

chorus

said why don't you stop your crying 
go outside and ride your bike 
thats what i did, i killed my toes 

chorus

after dinner, i had ice cream
fell asleep, and watched tv
woke up in my mother's arms

chorus
