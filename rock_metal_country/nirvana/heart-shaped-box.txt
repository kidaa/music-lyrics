She eyes me like a pisces when I am weak
I've been locked inside your Heart-Shaped box for a week
I was drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn back

Hey
Wait
I've got a new conplaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hate
Haight
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your prieless advice
Hey
Wait
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice

Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet
Cut myself angel's hair and baby's breath
Broken hymen of your highness I'm left black
Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back
