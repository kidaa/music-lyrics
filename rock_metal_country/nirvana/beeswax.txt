Lying here sitting in front of a fire
Not only Megan said I could thrive on a shot
Grinning my manhood and judge the mantle
I cut it up for you
say hey hey
And I wake up
I got my do this way [3X]

She laughs about it
squeeking inflection when the wind blows just right
Dragging your thumbs of my shirt
How many jumps is in it 
Right hey
When I'm getting back
I got my do this way
[incomprehensible babble]

Hear my fucking hate
I got my do this way

If your world is getting ugly
Fiberglass situation is as can as cotton candy 
Sunning out to save a ranch you ovulate
Freedom and count out being wrong
I feel you will gladly take it anal
Filly sli reminds me of someone
I understand your fear for the Love Boat
Don't need to kneel
Save all the cho ho
And I get along
I got my feel this pay
I got a little tale
I got my do this way
[incomprehensible babble]
When you're getting in
I got my do this way
