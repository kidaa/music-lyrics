Polly wants a cracker
Think I should get off her first
Think she wants some water
To put out the blowtorch

It isn't me, we have some seed
Let me clip your dirty wings
Let me take a ride, don't hurt yourself
I want some help to help myself
I've got some rope, you have been told
I promise you I have been true
Let me take a ride, don't hurt yourself
I want some help to help myself

Polly wants a cracker
Maybe she would like more food
She asks me to untie her
A chase would be nice for a few

Polly said
Polly says her back hurts
She's just as bored as me
She caught me off my guard
Amazes me, the will of instinct
