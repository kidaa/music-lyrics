Ev'ry night I sit here by my window window
Starin' at the lonely avenue avenue
Watching lovers holdin' hand 'n' laughin' laughin'
And thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do 

[CHORUS]
Thinkin' of things Like a walk in the park
Things Like a kiss in the dark
Things Like a sailboat ride
Yeah-yeah What about the night we cried
Things like a lover's vow
Things that we don't do now
Thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do

Memories are all I have to cling to cling to
And heartaches are the friends I'm talkin' to talkin' to
When I'm not thinkin' of-a just how much I love you love you
Well, I'm-a thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do

[CHORUS]

I still can hear the jukebox softly playin' playin'
And the face I see each day belongs to you belongs to you
Though there's not a single sound and there's nobody else around
Well, it's-a just me thinkin' of the things we used to do

[CHORUS]

And the heartaches are the friends I'm talkin' to
Ya got me thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do

[FADE]
Starin' at the lonely avenue
