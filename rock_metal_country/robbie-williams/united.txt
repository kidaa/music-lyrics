You sit and scream at all the scandal 
That put the monkey on your back 
Don't put your idols on a mantel 
You'll only want your money back 

Don't slap my face and call me brother 
Lend a hand and knock me out 
So one disciple to another 
What's this really about 

Are we united? 
'Cos I'm really not that sure 
When you've decided 
Spread some love and ask for more 

I sit and think about my maker 
And what he's got in store for me 
I wanna be a right-on daddy 
Protect my wife and family 

Are we united? 
'Cos I'm really not that sure 
When you've decided 
Spread some love and ask for more 

Are we united? 
'Cos I'm really not that sure 
When you've decided 
Spread some love and ask for more 

Runnin' out of love 
Got a pain in my head 
It's bringing me down 
God send me something 

Got a gun on my hip 
Real tight grip 
Don't give me no lip 
Boy send me something 

When a woman needs a man 
Man do what you can 
Lend them a hand 
And send them something 
Send them something 

Are we united? 
'Cos I'm really not that sure 
When you've decided 
Spread some love and ask for more 

Have you decided 
To spread some love and ask for more 

Have you decided 
To spread some love and ask for more
