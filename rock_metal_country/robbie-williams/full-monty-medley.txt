The Full Monty Medley 

You've done it all, you've broken every code 
and pulled the Rebel to the floor 
You spoilt the game, no matter what you say 
for only metal - what a bore! 
Blue eyes, blue eyes, how come you tell so many lies 

Come up and see me, make me smile 
Or do what you want, run on wild

Or do what you want, run on wild

You gotta know how to pony 
like Mony Baronie. 
Mashed potato,
do the alligator. 
Put your hand on your hip, 
let your backbone slip. 
Do the Watusi
like your Aunt Lucy.

Put your hand on your hip,
