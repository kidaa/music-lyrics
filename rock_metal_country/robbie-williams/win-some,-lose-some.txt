We didn't think it'd last beyond summer
I met her father she met my mother
We didn't have anywhere else to go
She said to me when we grow older
Will we still need young love on
Our shoulders
Does it just fade away
Will we ever know

She touched my face and called me
Her lover
I never thought that I'd need another

Your cool suburban sun
You're foolin' every one
You win some you lose some

I didn't know what we had found
Just caught the bus and rode it to town
She wouldn't notice anything else but me

Your cool suburban sun
You're foolin' every one
You win some you lose some

Dancing at discos
And moaning at phone bills
Torremolinos and sun burnt in high heels
Swap it and sell it
And drop it and smell it
All those years ago

She touched my face and called me
Her lover
I never thought that I'd need another

Your cool suburban sun
You're foolin' every one
You win some you lose some

Your cool suburban sun
You're foolin' every one
You win some you lose some

Now it's gone, now it's gone,
You win some, you lose some
Now it's gone, now it's gone,
You win some, you lose some
Now it's gone, now it's gone,
You win some, you lose some
Now it's gone, now it's gone,
You win some, you lose some

Win some
