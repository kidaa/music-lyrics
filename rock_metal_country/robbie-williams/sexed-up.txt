Loose lips on ships 
I'm getting to grips 
With what you said 
Know it's not in my head 
I lay on bed 
That I'm okay 

Why don't we talk about it 
Why do you always doubt that there could be a better way 
It doesn't make me want to stay 
Why don't we break up 
There's nothing left to say 
I got my eye shirt praying they won't stray 
Oh! When I sexed up 
That's what makes the difference today 
I hope you blow away 

You said we're fatally flopped 
When I'm easily bored 
Is that okay 
Strike me off your list 
Made this the last kiss 
I'll walk away 

Why don't we talk about it 
I'm only here Don't shout it 
Given time we'll forget 
Let's pretend we never meet 
Chorus 

Screw you I didn't like your taste 
Anway, I chose you 
Let's all gone to wasted Saturday 
I'll go out and find another you 

Why don't we 
Why don't we break up 
There's nothing left to say 
I got my eye shirt praying they won't stray 
Oh! When I sexed up 
That's what makes the difference today
