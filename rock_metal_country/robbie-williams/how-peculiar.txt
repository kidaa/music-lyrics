How peculiar

I am all of the above babe
Johnny  to the grave
 all the stamps in
Spend it on a kettle

Rub me rub me up right lovely
If you lick it then lick it battery
Good if I believe 

I haven't got a clue what to do with you
Need for you to love me so much
Jesus what am I going to do with this crush
So get the old fella and wack it up against the touch

How peculiar

Bend your long legs against the sofa and the Dorchester
You can eat your All Bran
I'm not into heart sports

Oh I haven't got a clue what to do with you
Jesus all the things my head is going through
God what am I going to do with this crush
Just wack the old man out and get it up against the touch

How peculiar

Jesus what am I to do man
I am a depressed man
Not sure what I'm doing
All of the day

How peculiar

I am all of the above man
I am what you want man
If you want me here I am
Come and get it baby
