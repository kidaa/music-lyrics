It's Only Us 

And they want us to grow up 
We don't want to get a job 
We all need a decent rock 
Where it's all Kicking off 

Baby it's alright Baby it's alright 
You don't need to call it off 
Baby it's alright Baby it's alright 
It's Only Us 

We just stopped for cheaper thrills 
Since the price went up on pills 
 From Stoke-On-Trent to Beverley Hills 

We know it's all Kicking off 
Baby it's alright Baby it's alright 
You don't need to call it off 
Baby it's alright Baby it's alright 
It's Only Us 
It's Only Us 

Baby it's alright Baby it's alright 
You don't need to call it off 
Baby it's alright Baby it's alright 
It's Only Us 
It's Only Us
