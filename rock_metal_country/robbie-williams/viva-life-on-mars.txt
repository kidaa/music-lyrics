I just wanna be [x4]

I lost all faith in what I know
The future doesn't need me
So I kick a bo agen a wo and head it till it don't hurt no more.
Use my cuts and lacerations, feed myself a new sensation woah woah

Take a ride on your high horse
If the horse is blind, use the force
The falcon flies in two straight lines
Red five standing by
It's not a moon it's a space station
It feels good the good vibration woah woah

I know that you know some lovely people.
Send them all an invitation, yer party to a segregation woah. Woah

Viva life on mars I'm calling
Sending my frequency to the galaxy so you can see people down here

They don't want us to discuss the picture in the caves of us.
A nosebleed and a bag of coal then they put you in a hole.
We're knee deep in information
And they can't stop this conversation. Woah woah

I know that you know some lovely people.
Send them all an invitation, party to a segregation woah. Woah

Viva life on mars I'm calling
Sending my frequency to the galaxy so you can see we're all down here

I just wanna be [x8]

Love is natural love is good
Not everybody does it but everybody should.
With them and us we've made a mess,
till they decide which god is best.
Free yourself from liberation from lake Geneva to the freeland station woah woah

I know that you know some lovely people.
Send them all an invitation, yer party to a segregation woah woah.

Viva life on mars I'm calling
Sending my frequency to the galaxy so you can see people down here

Viva life on mars I'm calling [x4]
