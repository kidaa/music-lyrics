Let's all make babies
And salsa from Sainsbury's
Cos this is a Happy Song
Play on my pink flute
Butt naked from Beirut
Cos this is a happy song

You need a mood maker
Then go meet my tailor
I know it's going too fast
Your sister your brother
His mistress your lover
Is getting on with it

Yeah  debonair  
I'm feeling so debonair  cos I care  
Send you my love cos I care  it's a love song 
This is a love song 
We bring news from Jamaica

Goose step through Gangland
And drive Chitty Bang Bang
Cos this is a happy song
Bosnians and Kurds
Back with some big bird 
Who's singing a happy song

Fly in the sunshine
Get there at your own time
You tell us if I'm in Hong Kong
Your sister your brother
His mistress your lover
Just singing a happy song

Yeah  debonair  
I'm feeling so debonair  cos I care  
Send you my love cos I care  it's a love song 
This is a love song 
We bring news from Jamaica

Happy Song

Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do 
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do 

Yeah  debonair  
I'm feeling so debonair  in the air 
Everything's up in the air  from Jamaica 
Tease me from bedtime
We bring news from Jamaica

Yeah  debonair  
I'm feeling so debonair  cos I care  
Send you my love cos I care  it's a love song 
This is a love song 
We bring news from Jamaica

This is a happy song
