Rome Munich Rome
All the women and the money I've blown
Rome Munich Rome
There's still a shitload of seeds to be sown
And I've been stunned
I plan to have it all while I'm still young
And I know you're low
We'll be alright tomorrow

You know it's not enough
To kiss you in my sleep
A dream is not like love
So give me something I can keep

Rome Munich Rome
So many people, so alone
Rome Munich Rome
Pack your bags, take me home
In time you'll see
How much I mean to you and you to me
And I know you're low
We'll be alright tomorrow

You know it's not enough
To kiss you in my sleep
A dream is not like love
So give me something I can keep

Rome Munich Rome

Rome Munich Rome

You know it's not enough
To kiss you in my sleep
A dream is not like love
So give me something I can keep

[Background: You know it's not enough...]

To kiss you in my sleep
So give me something, give me something, give me something, give me something, give me something
I can keep
