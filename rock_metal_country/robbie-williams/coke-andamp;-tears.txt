[Spoken: "Ok settle down you all, settle down lady, 
he's gonna be on stage real soon, that's right Mama put 
your popcorn down, he's turning to the band, yeah he's running his 
legs off, ladies and gentlemen Mr Robbie Williams"]

Just because your dyslexic
Doesn't mean your not fake 
We know you're not that stupid 
You'll marry someone rich 
Bet you won't steal his watch 
When your down by near his crotch 
That'll explain the itch
You were such a lying bitch 

I know you hold my suitcase 
Down in Kensington 
And you were screwing Ewen 
When I wasn't in. 
Did it to me, you'll do it to him
Your friends just gave me grief 
I will make this brief
You were such a lousy thief
You were such a lousy thief
But you were good in bed
You were good in bed
So good in bed 

Now you tell my girlfriend
That I'll never change
You've been up since Wednesday
Don't you find that strange
You're ex-boyfriend is deranged
You'll tell them down in Browns
Haven't been for years 
It's full of coke & tears
Full of coke & tears
Full of coke & tears
But you were good in bed
Good in bed 

[Spoken: "Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to thank you on behalf 
of Mr Robbie Williams and the band, you've been a fantastic
audience. Robbie's opened his heart out to you tonight and you've 
really taken him on board. Remember the name and whenever
he's in the neighbourhood, you get yourselves down there alright. 
It's been a great evening, thank you very much. Robbie Williams 
has now left the buidling....................Oh no, I'm afriad he's come 
back for his coke - now he's left the buidling - thank you very 
much - thank you very much."] 

Glory Glory Hallelujah
Glory Glory Hallelujah 
Glory Glory Hallelujah
