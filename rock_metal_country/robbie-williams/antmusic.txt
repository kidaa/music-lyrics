Well I'm standing here looking at you
What do I see
I'm looking straight through
It's so sad when you're young
To be told you're having fun
So unplug the jukebox
And do us all a favour
That music's lost it1s taste
So try another flavour

I'm standing here what do I see
A big nothing threatening me
It's so sad when you're young
To be told you're having fun
So unplug the jukebox
And do us all a favour
That music's lost its taste
So try another flavour

Oi! Oi! Big one! I'm down here! 
Watch yourself, I'm trying to carry this crum! 
You! Oi big one! Big foot!

And do us all a favour
