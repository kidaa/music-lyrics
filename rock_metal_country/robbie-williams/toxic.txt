Sticks and stones may break my bones
But names can burn a happy home
It's true
I've got words for you

The past is done
It's gone forever is done
Don't tell me my pain is pleasure
You, you haven't got a clue

Oh, I wanna cry but I don't make a sound
I'm your child and your child is feeling down
Everybodys toxic in this town

All gods children fade and die
In the name of lets get high
And then, we do it again
I pray the lord, my soul to keep
That when you coming down I'll be asleep
I can't pretend, it's killing me again

Oh, I wanna cry but I don't make a sound
I'm your child and your child is feeling down
Everybodys toxic in this town

Call me in my lord I'm coming down
Coming down
Call me in my lord I'm coming down

Oh, I wanna cry but I don't make a sound
I'm your child and your child is feeling down
Everybodys toxic in this town

Oh, I wanna cry but I don't make a sound
I'm your child and your child is feeling down
Everybodys toxic in this town

Sticks and stones may break my bones
But names can burn a happy home
It's true
I've got words for you
