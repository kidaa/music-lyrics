Let me lie down 
Please dont wake me 
Nothings sacred 
And noone save me 

In my black eye 
I can feel it 
Moving 
Closer 
Cant you hear it 

Only gift you gave to me 
Self forfilling prophecy 
Here to change the sounds that shaped my life 

And if you die before i leave 
What on earth becomes of me 
Look around theres noone here 
To love me and hold me 

Take me 
Dancing 
I love music 
Keep on 
Singing 
We wont loose it 

Bet ya 
Leaving 
Missing noone 
If your hearts run free 
Why cant we go on 

Go on to till they kick us out 
We've everything to talk about 
I could bring a song into your life 

If you should die before i leave 
What on earth becomes of me 
Look around theres noone here 
To love me and hold me 

Maybe i been away to long 
And no wonder they are always right but is there wrong 
They say there is nothing i can do 
But to talk to strangers and wait for you 

If you should die before i leave 
What on earth becomes of me 
Look around theres noone here 
To love me and hold me 

And if you die before i leave 
What on earth becomes of me 
Look around theres noone here 
To love me and hold me 
Oooh ooh ooh!
