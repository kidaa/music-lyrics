This is how I pray in the summertime,
this is how I pray in the summer
Got my glass of shandy,
now I feel fine, this is how I pray yeah

The more you say, the more you pray,
the less it's getting you down
The more you pray, the more you stay, the less it's getting you down.

Auntumn time, leaves falling all around
Winter time follows suit
Little bunnies freezing in the snow
Winter's such an ugly bute

Mid-city bluss getting you down
Take a break from the strain
Get out your car,
drink a glass of wine
Admit it, you feel great
It's the summertime

This is how I play in the summertime,
this is how I pray in the summer
Got y glass of shandy,
now I feel fine, this is how I pray, yeah

This is how I pray in the summertime,
this is how we play in the summer
Got my glass of shandy
now I feel fine, this is how I pray, yeah

And if your love had met 
its sad refrein
Believe me, you will love again
And all the best laid plans
of mice and men go wrong
You can hear it in this song

This is how I break for 
the summer time,
this is how I play in the summer
What's mine is yours, yours is mine
This is how I pray, yeah, oh, yeah

You got the funky drummer in '89
This is how I pray, yeah, oh, woah

The Mondays, The Roses,
blocking all your noses
Wearing baggy clothes
and their buffalo poses
Bank tellers, dropping little fellas
Loved up in the clubs with 
football thugs, no malice
I dig your socks
Big fish, little fish, carboard box
So give me French-kiss, I love you
Voodoo Ray
I dream of Santa Ana
on the road to Mandalay

In the summertime 
Where the weather is hot
In the summertime
Where the weather is hot
On my mind, on my mind
In the summertime
Where the weather is hot
In the summertime
Summertime
When the weather is hot
In the summertime
On my mind

I got shivers down my spine
On my mind
Happiness is surface light
On my mind
On my mind
