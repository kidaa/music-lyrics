There She Goes 

There she goes
There she goes again
Chasing through my face
And I just can't contain
This feelin' that remains

There she goes
There she goes again
Chasing down my lane
And I just can't contain
This feelin' that remains

There she goes
There she goes again
She calls my name
She calls my name
No one else could feel my pain
And I just can't contain
This feelin' that remains

There she goes
There she goes again
Running through my veins
And I just can't contain
This feelin' that remains

There she goes
There she goes
There she goes
