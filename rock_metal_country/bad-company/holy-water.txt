In my life, there's been changes
But nothing seems to satisfy me the way you do, no
You make it easy, the way you please me, everytime I'm close to you
All this temptation, I can't see wrong from right
It's a new sensation, you know I'm blinded by the light
Chorus:
Feels like I'm walking on holy water
Feels like I'm walking on sacred ground, baby
Feels like I'm walking on holy water, everytime that you come 'round
You were all I ever wanted, never had a girl in my life 'til I met you, oh no
I got a certain feeling, you got my senses reeling
Whenever I get close to you
You're my salvation, I found you just in time
My one temptation, you know I can't believe you're mine
chorus
Ooh yeah, it's funny how it see,s like yesterday, lovin' of the first degree
One word was all I heard you say, ooh baby
It's funny what you've done to me, just wanna see you run to me
Solo
All this temptation, I can't see wrong from right
It's a new sensation, you know I'm blinded by the light
chorus repeats out...
