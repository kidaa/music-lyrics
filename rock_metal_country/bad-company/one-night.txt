I ain't got no money, but I sure got style
And if you got the time, girl, I'll show you how to smile
Come on make your mind up, ooh baby take a chance
Before this night is over, I'll show you how to dance, yeah
You like the danger, it's in your eyes, I can see it there
Throw your dance with a stranger, kiss him goodbye, yeah, bye bye baby
Chorus:
One night ain't no love affair, but I won't ask no more from you
One night with you anywhere, heaven knows what we can do
So sophisticated, I like the way you dress
The way you move your body, ooh, baby I'm obsessed
I don't want no lifetime, I just want tonight
Come on, take a chance, girl, I know you know it's right, yeah
I've got this feeling, it's feelin' so strong, when I first saw you
You've got me reelin', don't prove me wrong, oh come on, baby
chorus
Solo
Yeah, you like the danger, it's in your eyes, I can see it, baby
You took a chance with a stranger, kiss him goodbye, bye bye baby
