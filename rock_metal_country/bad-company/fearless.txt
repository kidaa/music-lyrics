Everyday of her life, she's been living in a fantasy world
Chasing her dreams, so close she could scream
Inside she's just a little lost girl
When she's hot for action, she knows the right place, yeah
But she's ready for trouble, she just can't wait, no, look at her face
You know she's
Chorus:
Fearless, fearless - dancing on the tables
Fearless, fearless - tearin' up the floor
Fearless, fearless - the girl is such a rebel
She's so hot, I can't take anymore
Oh no, she's so fearless
In the middle of the night, you know that sometimes she's gonna show
Never bothers to knock, 'cos baby ready or not
You know she'll find somewhere to go
Don't ever stop her dancing or get in her way, yeah
You know she's heading for trouble, the girl's a disgrace, look at her face
You know she's - chorus
The girl's got nothing to lose, she'll never be a lady
So don't put your head in her noose, you know she'll drive you crazy
Solo
she's hot for action, she knows the right place, yeah
But she's heading for trouble, the girl's a disgrace, look at her face
You know she's - chorus repeats out...
