The company I'm keeping, well it may be bad
But it ain't bad enough, compared to me
So baby start believing, I'm the best you've ever had
Just give me time and I will make you see
Gonna prove you wrong, gonna prove me right
You better make your mind up, it's gotta be tonight
Baby baby baby, I can light your fuse
You ain't got nothing, nothing to lose, baby
Chorus:
Put both feet in the water - put 'em in the water, baby
Put your fears in the past - put 'em in the past, yeah
Forget what people have told you - don't listen
If you want our loving to last
I know what you've been hearing, and it makes me mad
To think that you'd believe so many lies
Girl I'm gonna tell you one thing, the rumours may be bad
But you ain't got no right to criticize
Because I heard about you and the things you do
You gotta make your mind up, am I coming through?
So baby baby baby, it's time you made your move
I ain't got nothing, nothing to prove, baby
chorus
Solo
Gonna prove you wrong, gonna prove me right
You gotta make your mind up, it's gotta be tonight
I said, baby baby baby baby baby, gonna light your fuse
You ain't got nothing, nothing to lose, baby
chorus repeats 3x
You'd better listen, baby
