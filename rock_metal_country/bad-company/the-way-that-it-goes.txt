That's the way it goes
I've been waiting for the perfect woman, to come and rescue me
Well there she is and I can almost touch her, oh, but I just can't speak
Whoo yeah
Chorus:
Sometimes that's just the way that it goes, some you win, some you lose
Sometimes that's just the way that it goes, there ain't much you can do
I've been dreamin' 'bout a '50 Shevy, dry and red of gleaming chrome
Saved up my money and bought some beat up wagon, ooh but now I'm walking home
Don't you know - chorus
They say that life's the luck to the draw, well I ain't had no cards
I only know that nothing's for sure, and the only luck's hard
Solo
Cars and girls on an endless highway, the all American dream
Girl I'd better try, yeah try and find it, and it ain't what it seems
Don't you know - chorus repeats 2x
Sometimes...
