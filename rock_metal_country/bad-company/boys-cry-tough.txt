Bobby's going out tonight, looking for trouble
Everybody likes to fight sometimes
Heading south on 41, straight for the action
Meeting the boys at the county line
He kicks it into overdrive, really puts that pedal down
Feels so good to be alive, he's had enough of being pushed around
Bobby and the boys walk in, the heads start turning
They don't like no strangers in this place, no no
Everybody's acting tough, words get spoken
And someone pulls a knife in Bobby's face
He turns away but it's too late, he's gotta face them on his own
Left him there to meet his fate, Bobby's never going home
Chorus:
Boys cry tough, boys fight dirty
Life gets rough, when you're living on a fine line
Mary's waiting home tonight, she's dreaming of church bells
Bobby says the day is getting near
Mary hears the doorbell ring, the blue lights are flashing
At 2 am her dreams all disappear
Mary's world is turning upside down, she's been left here on her own
Her world is spinning 'round and 'round, Bobby's never coming home
chorus
He said that soon their lives would be as one
Looks like you're gonna be the lonely one
Solo
Maybe in a year or two, she'll find someone of her own
Mary don't you wait around, Bobby's never coming home
chorus repeats 2x
