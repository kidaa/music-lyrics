I've only known what it is to be lonely
When into my life, you came walking through
Can this be real, I don't know what I'm feeling
Ooh, there's something 'bout you
And I can't believe the way that you know me
You sense every mood, ooh you know when I'm blue
But here in my heart, ooh there's mixed up emotions
Ooh, there's something 'bout you
I never wanted anybody, and I won't start now
I never planned it, I don't understand it, so tell me what can I do
Don't turn away, ooh I think I'm still learning
Yeah, there's something 'bout you
Solo
Ooh, here in my heart, ooh there's mixed up emotions
But there's something 'bout you
You know there's something 'bout you
There's something 'bout you, you came shining through, babe
Now there's something 'bout you, I don't know, I don't know what I'm feeling
There's something 'bout you, I don't know, I don't know
Yeah there's something 'bout you
