I had your picture, I had it there on the wall
It's been a long time, I didn't notice it fall
Just goes to show you, things get strange, there's nothin', nothin' I can do
You got your own life, I got mine, I still got feelings for you
And I wonder what you're thinking, does it ever seem right
Don't you know there's something missing, we don't have to fight
If you call me tonight
Chorus:
I'll be with you in a heartbeat, just whisper my name
And I'll be with you in a heartbeat, no questions, no blame
And I'll be with you in a heartbeat, just whisper my, just whisper my name
I got no answers, sometimes I just wanna shout
Which way to turn now, can't seem to figure this out
I haven't seen you in oh so long, nothin', nothin' seems to fade
Tried to forget you, but you won't go, ooh the memories we made
And I tried so hard to fight it, but it keeps comin' through
Ooh you were all I ever wanted, I'm waiting for you, if you wanted me too
chorus
Solo
And I wonder what you're thinking, does it ever seem right
Don't you know there's something missing, we don't have to fight
If you call me tonight
chorus repeats out...
