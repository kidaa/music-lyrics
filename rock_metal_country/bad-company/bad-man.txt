I take what I want, I take what I need, ooh yeah
I do what I like, I like what's right for me, ooh yeah
You might think that you're gonna change me, ooh girl, don't even try
So many others tried so hard to tame me, so many others cried
I'm tellin' you baby
Chorus:
I'm a bad bad man, that's what I am, I'm bad for you
I'm a bad bad man, oh yes I am, so whatcha gonna do?
I say what I mean, I mean what I say, ooh yeah
You should know me by now, I like my own way, ooh yeah
You might think I can't live without you, ooh but girl you'd be wrong
'Cos I know whatever we've got here, it won't last too long
I'm tellin' you baby
chorus
You think it's just a game I'm playin', ooh wait 'til I begin
Just listen hard to these three words I'm sayin', you can't win, you can't win
Solo
Ooh yeah, you might think that you're gonna change me, oh girl, don't even try
So many others tried too hard to tame me, so many others cried
I'm tellin' you baby
chorus
I'm a bad bad man, oh yes I am, so whatcha gonna do about it?
I'm a bad bad man, that's what I am, too bad for you
I'm a bad bad man...
