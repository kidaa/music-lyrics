She knocked down my money, she knocked down my fame
Just wanna feel I'm a part of the game
On the radio, on tv, it's like a heartbeat deep inside of me
Know what I want, know how to get, it's like the sound of a hot Corvette
Start it up, let it roll, come on baby, let's lose control
Ooh yeah, I wanna live it up, ooh yeah, don't wanna give it up, oh no
I wanna rock the rock of America, yeah baby rock the rock of America, ooh yeah
I hear the beat everywhere, smalltown streets, union squares
Every city's got that sound, it's in the open, not underground
Turn it up all the way, you can't escape it, it's here to stay
Sounds like thunder in my soul, come on babe, let's lose control
Ooh yeah, I wanna live it up, ooh yeah, don't wanna give it up now, no no
I wanna rock the rock of America, yeah baby rock the rock of America, ooh yeah
Solo
Ooh yeah, I wanna live it up, ooh yeah, don't wanna give it up now, no
I wanna rock the rock of America, yeah rock the rock of America
An' I've gotta rock the rock of America, you know what I want
Rock the rock of America, yeah
