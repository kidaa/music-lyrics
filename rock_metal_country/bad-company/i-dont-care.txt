Who's that girl, looking kinda innocent and shy
I've been told, she's the kinda girl that waves you goodbye
Bad reputation, rumours going 'round
My friends are talking, putting her down
Ooh that girl, I really wanna know that girl
Gonna walk right up, get next to you, gonna tell you babe, what I'm gonna do
Chorus:
I don't care what people say - I want you, yes I do
I don't care what people say - I want you, yes I do
I don't care, everybody thinks I'm a fool
I'm aware, loving you ain't considered cool
I never worry what people say
You know my mind's made up, there's only one way
Ooh that girl, I really wanna know that girl
Gonna make my move, play my hand, got a lot to prove, make you understand
chorus
So get ready, I'm comin' through, know what to say, know what to do
I've looked you up, looked you down, you're the kinda woman, I want around
Solo
Bad reputation, rumours going 'round
My friends are talking, putting her down
Ooh that girl, I really wanna know that girl
Gonna walk right up, get next to you, gonna tell you babe, what I'm gonna do
chorus repeats out...
