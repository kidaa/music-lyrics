She's gettin' ready to dance tonight
Black high heels, a dress that clings on tight
Skin so smooth, a young man's dream
Lips so red, she's only just sixteen, yes she is

She's livin' with kicks, livin' to dance the night away
Young girl has found her stage, watch out, you're a dangerous age
Headline news, front page, ooh girl, you're a dangerous age
