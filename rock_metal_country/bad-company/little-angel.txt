Sooner or later, when the time is right, you know that I'll be waiting here
And I'm sure that you will find your way to me
Baby I'll be ready, I've had so many lonely nights
I want a love that feels so right, and you know I'll be waiting for you
And baby if I could let you know
It's more than a feeling, it's what I believe in, and I can't let this go
I need an angel angel in my life, little angel angel here tonight
I need an angel here by my side
It must be like heaven when you find someone, someone who's really wanting you
And I know there must be one love there for me
I spent a lifetime waiting, and now I feel the time is right
For you to come into my life, you know I'll be ready for you
And baby my love could be so strong
So don't keep me waiting, my heart's nearly breaking
I've been on my own too long
I need an angel angel in my life, little angel angel here tonight
I need an angel by my side
I'm waitin for an angel angel here tonight
Little angel angel shine your light, I need an angel by my side
'Cos I want a perfect lover, and I won't need another
Just wanna show ya, show you what my loving can do
Solo
Baby if I could let you know
It's more than a feeling, it's what I believe in, and I can't let this go
I need an angel angel in my life, little angel angel here tonight
I need an angel by my side
I'm waiting for you angel in my life, little angel angel shine your light
Baby, I need an angel by my side
I need an angel angel in my life for you, angel shine your light
I need an angel here tonight...
