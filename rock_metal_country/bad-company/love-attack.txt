You hit me with a body blow, you hit me fast, then you hit me slow
You knock me out with the way you look
You have me hanging, baby, on your hook
I think about you all day and all night, my friends all swear I'm going insane
Now I don't care who is wrong or who's right, 'cos you're the cure for my pain
Chorus:
I'm coming down with a love attack, I surrender, I can't turn back
Coming down with a love attack, stay with me the rest of my life
Lay a little love on me
You don't know what you've done to me
You hit me hard, but you still can't see
I need your love every single night, I don't know why it feels so right
I got the fever, I sure got it bad, you touch me and my heart catches fire
I can't find it, you're driving me mad, you send my temperature higher
chorus - and make a little love
Solo
Every thought seems to lead to you, I can't decide what I'm gonna do
There's only one thing that can put this right
I'm gonna tell you how I feel tonight
I got the fever, I sure got it bad, you touch me and my heart catches fire
I can't find it, it's driving me mad, you send my temperature higher
chorus
I'm coming down with a love attack, coming down
I'm coming down, there's no turning back, coming down
chorus to fade
