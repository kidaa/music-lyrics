I used to see those red tail lights, heading for another town
And wish that I was on my way
Looking back on these summer nights, wasting time, fooling 'round
And there was nothing here to make me stay
But that night I met you, the night you came through made me realise
There's no way I can leave, you made me believe
And now when I look in your eyes
Chorus:
I could walk through fire, I can feel it burning
And I could walk through fire, to get right back to you
And as the flames get higher, you know I'll get stronger
Baby I could walk through fire
It's crazy how these things work out, I used to think I had no chance
And I somehow thought you'd slip away
You pulled me through the fear and doubt, gave me all I'm looking for
Everything I needed to stay
How could something so good, something so simple, get serious
How could someone so right come into my life, and now I just want you to know
chorus
And I would go anywhere, I would do anything, I do what you want me to
You know that I would, I want you to know this, whenever you need me
Ooh wherever you are, no matter how far, you know I'll be coming for you
chorus
Baby I could walk through fire, right back to you
And I could walk through fire, and I could walk through fire
And I could walk through fire, right back to you, yeah
