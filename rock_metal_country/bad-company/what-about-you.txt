There's something about you that I can't let go
Your spell is unbroken and it hurts to know
And I can feel you, and I can touch you, your memories surround me
What about you, little darling, what about you
Living without you is a long hard climb
And just when I'm over it, I see a friend of mine
He said he saw you, and how he's sure you, you'd like us still together
What about you, little darling, what about you
What about you, little darling, what about you
They said that we were dreamers, chasing some illusion
Something came between us, and broke it all in two
Solo
I can feel you, I can touch you, I want us back together
So what about you, little darling, what about you
What about you, little darling, what about you
What about, what about you babe, tell me, what about you
Don't go, I'm tellin' you baby
What about you babe, oh baby...
