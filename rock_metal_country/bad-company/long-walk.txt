I need a long walk, with someone who knows what to do
I need a long talk, I need a helping hand to pull me through
I need a tall drink, with somebody who cares, I need someone here for company
It's time to rethink and somehow find a way to put an end to this mystery
See I don't know, the pain won't go
And the hurt inside is getting so damn hard to hide
So now I pay the price, I wonder how much it's gonna take
I've gotta roll the dice, and try to take all this heartache
But I still don't know, the pain won't go
And the hurt inside is getting so damn hard to hide
I gotta work it out, 'cause my heart is still racing, racing away
Work it out, 'cause my heart is still breaking, hey
So now I'll take this long walk, I don't want anybody listenin'
'Cause I really wanna pour it out, and all went out without ever giving in
But I still don't know, the pain won't go
I'm still hurting inside and it's so damn hard to hide
You gotta help me work it out, 'cause my heart is still racing, racing away
Work it out, 'cause my heart, my heart is breaking away
I've gotta work this out, 'cause my heart is still racing away
Yeah, work it out, 'cause my heart, it's so much a part of me
Work it out - gotta work it out
My heart is still racing - and I'm wasting away
Work it out - I've gotta work it out...
