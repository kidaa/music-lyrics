Last night, you said you didn't know what you wanted
Baby that's all right, I can help you see this one through
I know you won't leave him, you think it's all wrong
Why don't you open your eyes
You're so unhappy but you keep hanging on, so trust me, baby and you'll see
Chorus:
It's never too late to change your mind - get out and take what you need
It's never too late, so take your time - you just gotta believe
One day, you'll look back and think you were crazy
There's no way, that's how it gets you sometimes
Right now, you can't let him go, there's something inside you
I won't tell you, you should know, it's so clear, baby, I'm right here
chorus
Solo
One day, you'll come running to me, it's just a matter of time
I'm right here where you know that I'll be, so trust me and you'll see
chorus repeats out...
