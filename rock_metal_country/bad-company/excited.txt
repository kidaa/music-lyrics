I've had enough of watching everything you do
It's just too much, I feel I'm going crazy over you
When you smile, I'm burning with a hundred flames
You're my dream, and you don't even know my name, yeah
There's something about you, you've been on my mind
Oh I can't live without you, so now is the time to get
Excited, tonight's the night, you know that I'm
Excited, tonight's the night
Don't you know, ooh I'm looking over your shoulder
Tell me now, exactly what you feel for me
Set me free, can't you see I'm starting to smoulder
I'm on fire, tell me that you feel the same, yeah
I'm feeling a hunger, it's starting to show
Oh I know you're the one, girl, so baby let's go and get
Excited, tonight's the night, we're gonna get
Excited, tonight's the night, you got me
Excited, burning with desire, you know that I'm
Excited, yeah I'm on fire, see me burn, yeah
Solo
I'm feeling a hunger, it's starting to show
Yeah, I know you're the one, girl, so baby let's go and get
Excited, tonight's the night, you'd better get
Excited, ooh tonight, you get me
Excited, and now's the night, and I'm
Excited, you know I'm right, let's get

Excited, and I'm gonna set you in flight
