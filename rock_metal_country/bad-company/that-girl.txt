I've heard the rumours, I hear one every night
They say that you've been cheatin' on me, I know they're not right
They don't really know you, they just don't understand
I know you wouldn't do that, wouldn't be so underhand
Chorus:
And still they say, that girl, yeah the girl is playin' 'round again
That girl, yeah they say I oughta know
They say I haven't noticed, that you wanna be alone
And sometimes no one's there when I answer the phone
They say you tell me stories about the places you go
If there's somethin' you're not tellin' me, I've got the right to know
Yeah - chorus
I hear it every night, that girl, they say if I know what is good for me
Hey that girl, they say that I should let her go
My friends are tellin' stories, about your goings on
I just wanna talk to you, babe, I've got to know what's goin' on
They don't really know you, they just don't understand
I know you wouldn't do it, you wouldn't be so underhand
Yeah - chorus
Hear it every night
That girl, then they say it's for the company
That girl, I hear it everywhere I go
That girl, they say that I'm too blind to see
That girl, it seems she can't say no
That girl...
