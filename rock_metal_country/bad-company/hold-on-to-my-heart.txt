Whenever you need me, I would be there
Lookin' over your shoulder, you know that I care
But still you walked away
And I could never seem to find the words, the words to make you stay, so baby
Chorus:
Hold on to my, hold on to my heart - when it feels like it's fading
Hold on to my, hold on to my heart - you know I'll be waiting
All this crazyness, it keeps us apart
So hold on to my heart
Whatever you told me, I would believe
And over and over, I had my heart on my sleeve
And I gotta let you know
That no matter where you are tonight, I could never let you go, so baby
chorus
Never a day goes by without your memory
Oh yeah, I can still picture us, baby, you and me
Solo
chorus repeats out...
