Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
You got me cornered, there's no getting out alive
So wait a minute, woman, I need to switch out that light
We're a bad match, babe, you never know what's good for you
There's somethin' not right, I'm gonna tell you what to do
For 24 hours, you been comin' on so strong
Baby, I'm gettin' nervous, and pretty soon I'm gonna prove you wrong
I've gotta tell it like it is - I know it's down to me
Can't go on like this - our love is history
I'm gonna burn this bridge - you just wait and see
Tell it like it is - uh huh, hey
Face to face, a day I will never forget
Well I was beggin' for your love, you said you're not ready yet
Hey we've come a long way, babe, there's nothin', nothin' I won't do
And well I warn you tonight, my love is hot, I'm comin' for you
For 24 hours, you've been puttin' me on
Maybe I'm gettin' nervous, and pretty soon I'm gonna prove you wrong
I've gotta tell it like it is - I know it's down to me
Can't go on like this - our love is history
I'm gonna burn this bridge - just you wait and see
I'm gonna tell it like it is - uh huh, hey
Solo
For 24 hours, you been comin' on so strong
Maybe I'm nervous, pretty soon I'm gonna prove you wrong
I'm gonna tell it like it is - I know it's down to me
I can't go on like this - watch your step, it's history
Gonna burn this bridge - you just wait and see
Tell it like it is - yeah uh huh
Tell it like it is - wait and see
Can't go on like this - our love is history
I'm gonna burn this bridge - I'm gonna burn you down
I'm gonna tell it like it is - I'm waitin', I'm waitin'
Tell it - tell it - tell it - tell it - tell it - tell it - tell it like it is
No, you know it's still down to me
I said tell it - tell it - tell it - tell it - tell it - tell it like it is
You're history
You've gotta tell it, tell it, tell it!
