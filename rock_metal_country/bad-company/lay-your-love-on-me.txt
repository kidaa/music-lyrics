I've been up, I've been down, I've been in every situation
I've been pushed, pushed around, and I've been stuck at every station
Looking back, felt so good, searching for fortune and fame
Suddenly comes to you, you're only playing a game
Don't need no video no matter what they say
Don't need no radio you know, love is here to stay
Chorus:
Lay your love on me, each and every night, baby
Lay your love on me, it'll be alright
Straight up, down the line, I've got the blues in my soul
All I need is my guitar, I got this rock, I wanna roll
You gotta fight for what's right, I never did need the fame
Suddenly comes to you, you're only playing a game
Don't need no video no matter what they say
Don't need no radio you know, love is here to stay
chorus
Solo
Don't need no video no matter what they say
Don't need no radio love is here to stay
chorus repeats out...
