Tricky : 
I believe in 
I deceive in 
Bottom weaving 
I can breathe in 
Make a wish in 
Flower fishing
Moving vibration 
Mild relation 
I'm Jamaican on your radio station 
Got a curse in 
Could be worse in 
You first 
In a hearse in 
Good as dead in 
Nothing left in 
Nothing left in 
Some be heading 
I need a head rest in 
And a feed from a warm breast 

A man making hits 
For the childhood of hicks 
Underground like 
Who's it sound like 
You all sound the same 
But you don't know my name

Stephanie McKay: 
I believe in people lying 
I believe in people dying 
I believe in people trying 
I believe in people crying 

Alanis Morissette:
Ah 

Stephanie McKay: 
I believe in people balking 
I believe in people talking 

Alanis Morissette:
Ah 

Stephanie McKay: 
I believe in people breathing 
I believe in people being 

Tricky: 
We all sound the same 
You don't know my name 
Rearrange and
Things don't change 
Things remain
Feel the strain 
Stress 
Catch my breath 
There'll be a new tale of
Get some rest 
He and I
From the mess 
In fact any time
I couldn't care less 
Every day
Sugar cane
Write fictional stories
Is like smack to my vein 
Shook fame 
If you want to
But I don't complain 
On the street

Stephanie McKay: 
I believe in different reasons 
I believe in breath through seasons 
I believe when snow flakes fall 
I believe in buildings tall 

Alanis Morissette:
Ah 

Stephanie McKay:
I believe in people bombing 
I believe in people warring 
I believe diseases coming 
I believe that's why I'm running 

Alanis Morissette:
Ah 

Stephanie McKay: 
Keep living 

Alanis Morissette:
Ah 

Stephanie McKay: 
Keep living 


Tricky: 
Alanis Morissette in the background 
You gotta ask 
There'll be a new tale of
Before he attacks 
He and I
You got the flats 
In fact any time
Dub my sacks 
Every day
You've got the city 
Writing fictional stories
Move out of the country 
I'm scrunching 
If you want to
Friends that are punchy 
On the street

Stephanie McKay: 
I believe in people falling 
I believe in people warring 
I believe diseases coming 
I believe that's why I'm running 

Alanis Morissette:
Ah 

Stephanie McKay: 
I believe in people balking 
I believe in people talking 

Alanis Morissette:
Ah

Stephanie McKay: 
I believe in people breathing
I believe in people being 

Alanis Morissette:
Ah

Stephanie McKay: 
Keep living...
