Every night as I sit on my own, I still think I can hear you
I can't stand all this being alone, I just gotta be near you
I don't know if you're coming back, sometimes I could scream
But every night I know I'll see you, you still live in my dreams
Chorus:
In the dead of the night, when everybody's sleeping
Oh that is the time, when you come around
You left and my world fell apart, and I was desperate to find you
I want you back but where do I start, I need help to remind you
I don't know if you'll ever remember, when love reigned supreme
The only time that I get to see you now, is here in my dreams
chorus
Solo
Oh babe when you come back, and put and end to this pain
Meantime if I close my eyes, I'll see you again
chorus repeats out...
