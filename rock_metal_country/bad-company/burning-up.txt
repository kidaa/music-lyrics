I'm burnin' up, I'm burnin' up, I'm burnin' up for your love
I'm burnin' up, I'm burnin' up, I'm burnin' up for your love
You let me down, turned me 'round, you messed around with my heart
What kind of woman with a smile on her face
Can tear your whole world apart, hey
I'm on fire, I feel it burnin' up, I'm on fire
I'm burnin' up, burnin' up, I'm burnin' up every night
I'm burnin' up, burnin' up, and burnin' up can feel so right
I see the smoke, I feel the heat, my life is going up in flames
How could you be so indiscrete, and still be so unashamed, hey
I'm on fire, I feel it burnin' up, I'm on fire
Hey you said you'd never leave me, you said we'd never be apart
You turned out to be a liar, and left me with a broken heart
Why did you do it babe, yeah
Solo
I'm on fire, I'm burnin' inside, I'm on fire, why did you do it baby
Ooh I'm burnin' up, I'm burnin' up, I'm burnin' up for your love
Ooh I'm burnin' up, see I'm burnin' up, I'm burnin' up for your love
Watch me burn, see me burnin', 'cause my heart's on fire
Watch me burn, see me burnin' up for your love
Watch me burn, see me burnin' up for your love
Watch me burn...
