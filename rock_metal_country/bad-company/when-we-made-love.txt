Standin' there, a shadow in the hall
I'm hopin' that it might be you, but it wasn't anyone at all
I can still remember the way things were
If I could only bring you back, then I wouldn't need to say a word
When we made love, it felt so strong, I remember
We were so much in love, where did our love go wrong
Remembering the things we used to say
The memories are drifting by, but the pain is here to stay
And it's no illusion, I'm a lock without a key
I'm only livin' half a life, without you here with me
When we made love, a love that felt so strong, I still remember
We were so deep in love, where did our love go wrong
Solo
I can feel every touch again, as real as it is crazy
And I kiss every kiss again, so tender they amaze me
I live through the end again, feeling like I'm dying
And then I touch my cheek, realize I'm crying
When we made love, a love so strong, and I remember
We were so deep in love, so tell me, where did our love go wrong
When we made love, we belong together
It's those nights I'm dreaming of, they'll stay with me, they'll last forever
When we made love
