Ooh yeah, she could be my teacher, ooh yeah, she could be my queen
Me and the boys, we stopped talking, she came walking through
And one by one the subject got around, yeah, got around to you, thank God

I know you wanna show me baby, what the world's about
Don't treat me like I broke your toy, and I'll be your dirty boy
