If you want my love, you got it
A little something from above, tell me if you want it
But don't you leave me waiting, it don't matter where you are
There ain't nobody hiding, no matter how near or far you are
I'd pull the world apart, just to get a glimpse
One lie was all it took, I've missed you ever since, so get ready
Oooh, we're gonna take this town, oooh, we're gonna tear it down
And anywhere I go, baby, I see you
I gotta let you know, ooh darlin', just how much I need ya
This time I'm gonna find you, you gotta know how much I care
So take a look behind you, you'll see me everywhere, right there
I'm gonna do about anything to see your face again
And I'm gonna take this place apart, I'll find you in the end, so get ready
Oooh, we're gonna take this town, oooh, we're gonna tear it down, I said
Yeah, we're gonna take this town, baby I know, we're gonna tear it down
Solo
Oooh, we're gonna take this town, gonna tear it down, yeah, oh yeah - watch me
Oooh, we're gonna take this town, oooh, we're gonna tear it down
Yeah, we're gonna take this town, baby I know, we're gonna tear it down...
