This song started as a rant against haters
But that'd be giving in to the instigators
If there is one thing I'd like to pull off
When someone steps with hate all I do is just scoff
You can't burn me [2x]

The same force that flows through every circuit
The juice that's spent everytime you work it
Every life form is based on this simplicity
The soul that you have is electricity

You can't avoid that
Evolution is fact
We're all from the same Lucy
Despite differences you see

I'm in disbelief at what people will believe
All along I thought we had our hearts on our shirtsleeve
If one thing I can say as a piece of advice
Don't believe it till you see it and then see it twice
It's so funny [2x]

The same force that flows through every circuit
The juice that's spent everytime you work it
Every life form is based on this simplicity
The soul that you have is electricity

You can't avoid that
Evolution is fact
We're all from the same Lucy
Despite differences you see
A call out for unity
In every province and city
What do you think we've been saying
Since we first started playing
