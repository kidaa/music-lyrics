Are you missing us
maybe wanting to be kissing us
and if you must, please don't be dismissing us
and when we're gone, bailin' on the bus

Are we immersed in a sea of replicants
hard exteriors and fake gold fronts
loosing yourself in the flavor of the month
gotta be a better reason to colonize a star
gotta be a better reason man's come so far

Is that you in the mama-ocean-people-sea
is that you in this dream as see waving at me
closer with one hand, while the other shields your eyes
as if surprised to see the universe begin

Being up on the mindspin
are you still glad that it has been
six years and seven months
this is want you want, don't front
I'm feelin' it right now
in this, the gold hour
part clock and part man
reconciling my life span

Keeps things whole
we move out of the space where air flows
when all of a sudden
here we are, and here we go

The evolutionary mind
turns twist backflips
in space-time the continuum
real-life planetarium

It's a natural fact
time is speeding up there isn't much left
heart rate increasing
bustin' through your chest, compressed

Is your life in the physical
but out of memory
comes a vision which is a miracle
yeah, that

Normally we just can't see
it's not natural or typical
of our same old thing
livin' too fast, unable to grasp the past
or the future when at last we ripple
after our big splash

Being up on the mindspin
are you still glad that it has been
six years and seven months
this is want you want, don't front
I'm feelin' it right now
in this, the gold hour
part clock and part man
reconciling my life span

You remain
and refrain
from the pain
of wasted time
last thing on my mind is
running high
fuel supply
reason why
we just don't quit
can you get with
a melding of two minds
what's the worst thing you could find
a paper trail
that prevails
in demystification
people
want to believe
in mysteries
people
want to believe
in mysteries
is the truth so bad
is the truth so bad
is the truth so bad
is the truth so bad
