Let me take you down south
Hear it from the dover's mouth
The rhythm will make you want to move your body
I had it once and never ever forgot it
Feel the rhythm of rhapsody
Your body moves in raw ecstasy
Explosive eruption beyond compare, and

Take my advice don't think twice
Let me take you way down south

Step back cuz the funk is here and
The base is kickin' straight to your ear man
Because it's like that so don't talk back
And if you do then you're gonna get the back slap
Down south, that's an enigma
But to you it's a stupid dumb stigma
That's right it's outta sight

Let me tell you 'bout my baby
She loves me, don't mean maybe
She knows what I think and I don't have to say it
I love her so I don't have to play it
We sit and drink in the sun
I raise my glass and say she's the one
Cool breeze light squeeze life

Take my advice don't think twice
Let me take you way down south

Step back cuz the funk is here and
The base is kickin' straight in your ear man
Because it's like that so don't talk back
And if you do then you're gonna get the back slap
Down south, that's an enigma
But to you it's a stupid dumb stigma
That's right it's outta sight

Psychedelic freak out taco funk frolic
Grind fiend roots 'core soul music what have you
Psychedelic freak out taco funk frolic
Grind fiend roots 'core soul music what have you

Step back cuz the funk is here and
The base is kickin' straight to your ear man
Because it's like that so don't talk back
And if you do then you're gonna get the back slap
Down south, that's an enigma
But to you it's a stupid dumb stigma
That's right it's outta sight
