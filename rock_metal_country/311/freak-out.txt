Let the games begin if you wanna fuck with me
You can't disturb the course of P & C & T & D & me
I'm on a mission
To set straight
The vice, the curse, the date, the gate relate
to this. I insist B it's weak to dis see I'm runna up so suckers stick to your 40
How could I give a damn, give a damn if you approve what it's about. 
I just freak out

Just guess ya'll c'mon come back slipped outta whack as the master. 
Laid out the music

Death I just say fuck you, the void unknown we're thrown 
through while lost in life's psychedelic trip we take
There's another more bizarre we have to make
world we have nowhere beyond
Take out the earth the bass is gone
At life's end we'll feel the calm
How strange we should be here at all

[Chorus:]
If you don't have someone to do it with it's not worth doin'
To all my friends, it's not the end the earth has not swallowed me yet

Into whose womb were you woven what kin of your skin dropped you then
Bodies cloven
Light of daybreak blinded next exit
The wild darkness forming inside it
My day wasn't promised me each death it brings reminding me we
Are rumbling through this cursed universe where death is birth
Think not but what your manifest is worth
Giving up a verse the curse occurs a thirst
To burst first breaking through the center of the universe
Slamming down on the lingo flow so jam to the bumrush single
Long ago has been become now when you find out there's no break
In the rhythm. 
Black anima makes my stamina stand alone disown the cinema 
farewell to posing decades dozing comin up the steps of the new
Screen rising scenes from the lost world shapes hard to tell. 
Which is which as if drawn by a child holmes

[Chorus]
This is the heat to flush your face
