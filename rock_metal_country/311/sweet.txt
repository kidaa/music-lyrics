Take a chance on something star you gotta 
All the live long day 
If I had toname one thing you think data 
Be hard pressed to say 
You can't say I'm gushy, 
Atleast you know what I think I know that I'm lucky, I know you're on the brink
You got it good good good, 
You got it good so good 
You make up ridiculous words which mean exactly nothing 
I know just what you mean and that's the funny thingIt's understood, 
It's understood 
Buddy buddy buddy I know why you wander
Through the sweetness on the ground 
The sweetness of the flowers 
You make yourway on a cloudy day 
You've got to move 
The world you prove is too sweet, yeah 
We parted much too soon I know but that's how it goes 
There's someone better outthere for you and me 
Can't wait to get on the road and feel the shows 
And belike phenomenon number 1 and 2 and 3 
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast
But I am the guy that could give you the most 
It's good good good, It'sunderstood 
Buddy buddy buddy I know why you wander 
Through the sweetness on theground 
The sweetness of the flowers 
You make your way on a cloudy day 
You've gotto move 
The world you prove is too sweet, yeah
