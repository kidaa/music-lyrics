Yeah, uh-hu, unh
awww shit
what, unh
you know the freaks can't handle it
we keep on searching from the seaside
to the mountainside, come on
hardly outstyled and hardly outblazened
nectar natural, completely amazing
others more concerned with just fronting on hardness
I flow sweet with millennium niceness
I don't know if they're just scared or what
but a little sincerity would knock them on their butt
I keep my dogs at my side and I keep my shit tight
let me tell you how I feel, all right

Y'all's radio rock ain't that tuff
can't move to that ain't deep enough
one more time groove on the line
chill's up my spine, ready, rewind

The only thing that never gets old is honesty
you'll probably be caught up fronting
the only thing you always try to be is hard
because you're scared that someone might pull your card
the only thing that never gets played out
is melody, I'm hearing it calling me
it's plain to see because it's all laid out

Full ride, I'm a master of technology
livin' my life nice in pursuit of groove-ology
I'm getting vibes like you checking me out
without a doubt I pull clout and crush crews in a rout
I'm a Doberman in any given reaction
well-mannered and reserved, yet ready for action
I let you have it all, I got nothin to hide
I tell ya how we comin', we comin' full ride
full ride, full ride, we work in on the inside
as you'd expect we come correct
while others just run and hide
full ride, full ride, we work in on the inside
as you'd expect we come correct

I get fucked up rockin the jams, I bump disco
playin' records all day I then let go
I'm the king of my town
but when my girl is around
parlay like the Count of of Monte Cristo
so simple the jams are in front of me
get drunk in New York, make fun of me
when we play it's a serous thing
to all the people who that gather
here's what we bring

The only thing that never gets old is honesty
you'll probably be caught up fronting
the only thing you always try to be is hard
because you're scared that someone might pull your card
the only thing that never gets played out
is melody, I'm hearing it calling me
it's plain to see because it's all laid out

Yeah, yeah, what
full ride, full ride, we work in on the inside
as you'd expect we come correct
while others just run and hide
full ride, full ride, we work in on the inside
as you'd expect we come correct

yes, yes, full ride, full ride, we work in on the inside
as you'd expect we come correct
while others just run and hide
full ride, full ride, we work in on the inside
as you'd expect we come correct, unh
