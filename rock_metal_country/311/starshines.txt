I am a music lover some how I get paid
This song would still exist if no money was made
That's the difference
I summed it up in a sentence
I'm sittin' here perfectly still cuz I've got no place to go
Be about two months until we light up
The show follow me now
I sing of spring it's a marvelous thing
What else swing the thing you bring

Yo I got to say hola 
Orange County to Angola 
I go back to the beat [2x]
It never lets me down 
Zone in and let it rola 

I deem stream of sweat that connects me to you
I still be all about that thing that you do
We dip dip dive and herbalize
I don't look over my shoulder but I know there are spies
But then long time crew
Stuck like glue
You never let me down
Always came through
Always kept the flow
Even when you didn't know
Don't ask us
We make it up as we go

Yo I got to say hola 
Orange county to Angola 
I go back to the beat [2x]
It never lets me down 
Zone in and let it rola 

Seems like people are the viruses
And earth is simply tired of us
So many headz what if something would give
And kill off our race
Maybe diseases from space
Arriving from a comet
With a trail left for the planet
Say the wake it created was the start of the end
Filled with spores that were engineered
Plant pathogens
What's in the future for the view is many changes
Humans could be in danger
What would you eat to be a remainder
As your food is maimed
To take you out the frame
Some would vaporize
Some would remain
The same suckers with no cares about
The wave of the world I feel
Their lives are destined for hard times too

There's a parallel universe that might be blocked
But by emotion we put into it we could unlock
I'm not saying we could escape fate tunneling in this vast
Untranslatable energy filled of dust and ash
