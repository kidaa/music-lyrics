Will I say
leaving this Babylon

Say I'm leaving this Babylon
leaving this Babylon
will not be to long
will not be to long
say my people are starving
but your money's running

I said my people are starving
but your money's running

I say your dollar, dollar cut down real low
you ain't got nothin' to show
gonna' step right through the door
not gonna' come back no more
cuz a politition lied
my mama just did cry
and nothing ever gonna' change
my father just desides
her sisters just a line
and I ain't got nothing to claim
oh...

Will I say
will I say
that, did it go away
now did you leave today
yeah...yeah...
