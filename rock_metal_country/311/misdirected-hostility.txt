Not I'm not the type to just act like I know 
Puttin on an angle putting on ashow 
Speaking on nothing makes you a stunt 
I'll tell you right here yo I don't front I cross the t's and skip nonlegitimacies 
Or else please I cannont handleall the negative vibe merchants 
Is that all you have in you per chance 
So muchangst and pain it's so wack 
You should take a tip from the one Frank 
Black Playsome pachinko play some parcheesi 
Cause all the angst shit is just cheesy 
It's the 311 bliss too smooth for pissed 
Lyrics talkin loud again 
Yeah we are theparty men 
Cosmetics that you fretted 
We sport the high asthetic H
ere go rapkickin the dazzled crazy mathematic 
I am what I am mix some old school jams ontotape cuz the 
Party's in the crates I scan step into the realm 
What you gonna do
Give the party people something funky to listen to 
Misdirected hostility,that's what you got see 
Misdirected hostility, that's what you got see
Misdirected hostility, that's what you got see
Misdirected hostility, that'swhat you got
Bodyrock pop and lock here's an example 
Boulevard chrome beatsalways ampin' your temple 
Punks get got in the age of hip hop 
It's just begunlike stolen bikes on the blacktop 
Born to sing a lyric immaculately concepted 
Nostrain in your game if your game is respected 
Come as you are radio star 
Drownout the hatred with a rhyme
An electric guitar 
Dispatched when rap shattered theglass of radio access 
May we turn some soul on their rythmless dances 
You knowthe time and they'l know the scoop 
They'l say it was a rhyme and a beat of a rapgroup 
Your rhymes have been outmoded 
Your rhymes have been outmoded 
Your rhymeshave been outmoded 
Your rhymes have been outmoded 
Your rhymes have beenoutmoded 
So just quityourbellyachin' 
You're saying that your tortured 
Give me afuckin break and 
Maybe take out the source 
Of your disparing what do I mean 
Kickthe fuckin' heroin I speak from experience 
Because I didn't see clearly once
Acting like I dunce In 1989 I was cocaine and Jim Beam 
But now it's 95 and I'mginseng 
Misdirected hostility, that's what you got see 
Misdirected hostility,that's what you got see 
Misdirected hostility, that's what you got see
Misdirected hostility, that's what you got
