Now I know, fools get their own when they chit chat
Haven't heard yet but you can bet I'm not with that
With that talk with the digi walk
I stalk a bird you heard absurd word to the Fact
I'm a cat nippin sippin on the flask
Passin it talking shit but only if your ass
In front of me cause you could run from me but
In the end revenge send ends to the defendant
I can't get get caught in the spiral cause every bit of energy
It goes to my survival out my way
I'm a flicka flacka blotter ya try to find a weakness
But the shit keeps gettin harder

Fourth of July with Lucy in Sky
I remember pine trees and the coat of many colors
I was nineteen
I'd do anything
Shit like that now scares me but I'd like to do it again
It was Independence day
I've seen the other side and I say
I've been insane
And I won't ever be the same

Cuz we flow we must be fly
First to flow Nickel my brother, so wise
And then I rise
Here's an ill kid pimpin' cuz he is so slick
Step's from darkness his body electric
A drone buzzes the air a cracklin' tone
Then boomin' like thunder in a cosmic jungle
Deathe defyin; like Knievel he weeble
Words that will wobble awkward and evil
Cuz he flow and rock the hardest of the crowds
A marvel pow how you like me now
I've returned the kiss of death the last Damien
From the abyss fresh eternal alien
Now famished from pathless way I ma, do damage
To the wack MC's I know you can't stand this
Right about now get down I'm the annihilator
Rockin with the rhythm of my rhyme detonator
