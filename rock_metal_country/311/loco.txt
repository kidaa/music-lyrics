Hey you got to step outside to see what's going on 
Hey you can't run andhide when the 'psybin trip is on 
Not like this have you seen such green 
A spotlike this becomes serene I'm glad your here i have no fear

But you seem so agile we'll make it in tea 
And we'll see what there is to see

Boom boom you got the spinning of the room 
Quite right you got the breaking ofthe light 
Boom boom you got the spinning of the room 
Quite right you got thebreaking of the light 
And the sun and the moon and the spinning of the room
