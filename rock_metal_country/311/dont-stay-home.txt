Life could slip away in absent minded numbness 
I'm only sayin this 'cuz Iwish for the best 
When you always stay in self-incarceration I think it's such ashame 
Don't stay home this time now don't stay home 
If he don't have to hedon't want to
Don't stay home this time no don't say no 
Oh how I'd like todiffuse your time bomb anger
It's screaming danger danger this kind of world
Don't care if you're home so you better get some 
Don't stay home this time nowdon't stay home
If he don't have to he don't want to 
Don't stay home this timeno don't say no 
Everything I'm sayin' you can dismiss 
Because I sat alone onthis past Christmas I deserved to be alone 
But I guess I should have gone home 
Hey don't break the mold kid just eat around it 
Yeah that's what I did I'll berunnin around the block 
For no apparent reason 
Somethin' you'll catch me doin'in any given season 
Gotta break a sweat man gotta go bust out Buddy bye bye byebye 
Good-bye to the drought - yea
Don't stay home this time now don't stayhome 
If he don't have to he don't want to 
Don't stay home this time no don't say no 
Don't stay home this time now don't stay home 
If he don't have to he don'twant to 
Don't stay home this time no don't stay home
