H to the E to the X to the U to the M 
I'm Hexum, I always seem to vex them 
Even when I really don't mean to 
But I'm a brick house and you're a lean-to 
I kick the positivity like a shipwreck on a raft 
In a sea of negativity it covers them half 
Half of the world, the figure is intact 
Which way will you have an impact 
Come back to your bro, do what your soul 
But when you're in the mode just flow 
I stick to the brick of the house of the funk 
And the swing and the vibe of the reggae hip-hop 
Sing it for the people not the chase it to the steeple 
And whatever you do don't stop 
I come and drop a clue from me to you 
Like Fantasy Island Chad's got one tattoo

Miles I'm driving in the mach with mad 
Not unlike a box I am 
Endore how fox I am 
Inferior spinning is my hand 
I see a man like me stand 
Between mirrors and seem myself go all in lieu of them 
Flowing, I didn't know my soul dig 
Becomes the body of another one 
Constellation, the mirror is such a simple above collection 
And the mic down in my eye 
Today we're taking out Paris or say 
Of the lands heavy spirit of ill descending 
Oh my God I made a mess haul 
See mercury fall from hands flung 
Red, super and deadly as I step into an outer sea

Here's some advice, it's called A-B-C 
This is your world, you can be anything 
People look at me and think I know just what I am doin' 
But half of the fuckin' time, I do not have a clue and 
In any given situation I always say stupid things 
Not as bad as P-Nut, but he's cool just the same 
Norwegian, Scottish, Irish, and Mexican 
And on the drums is the one Chad Sexton 
Super phat beats that you just can't fuck with 
Doin the type of shit, gonna have a good run 
With the stupid motherfuckers and those party going thieves
