Just sever that leash and release
your freedom of speech
you just have to believe
your deed will be received
somehow, somewhere
you won't be repaid with a blank stare
let me know if you dare

There's no one that could cure you
like she does she does
no one could leave you so alone

Cuh, cuh, come on
Here I goes, my vibe is holy, my eyes close
either I'm asleep or what I'm thinking is deep
eventually I sigh and then I kick the sheets
and try to piece together why I'm here
nothing except my own damn eyes and ears
and then it sever so I listen to my heart always and ever
if it's not good it might get better
if it's not good it might just sever

I tell you money there's other honey
you always show it but you don't know it
staring at the door thinking about the mess you're in
in your couch sinking deep over the girl that's gone

Just sever that leash and release
your freedom of speech
you just have to believe
your deed will be received
somehow, somewhere
you won't be repaid with a blank stare
let me know if you dare

Now all you think about her
drink about her in vain
but all else feels
like you're betraying

We're wakin' it up face up, and shakin' it up
we know of an extended field
this is the deal
for letting and getting the vibes that we want
open up your heart
and proceed to feel
now you're inchin' up
to the summit never plummet
boot your system up
and then bail with the middle finger up
why are you so abrupt, baby don't be corrupt

Standin' in the club playin' the wall
but they're not her is all
you think, and that is true
but what else can you do
trying to turn back time
or just tow the line
cause the space you're in
is no place like home
