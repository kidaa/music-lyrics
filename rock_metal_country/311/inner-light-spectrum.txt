When I shadow box inside my skull
Bothered by the senselessness
I wish for the messiah
Indian woman, Babylon

There is one thing I will say on life
We are livin' yeah 
Let it flow
Cuz it won't stop

And when the kind consiousness yes come unto you
You will know and it won't stop

When I wipe the sleep from my eyes
Will my fondest dream please come true
Crush my heart with a hammer
Make a purer one Babylon

There is one thing I will say on life
We are livin' yeah
Let it flow
Cuz it won't stop

And when the kind consiousness yes come unto you
You will know and it won't stop

But mean people I say choke on it
Gagging all the way
May you remember the texture for days
But you'll get used to
The feeling of your pride
Of your pride [2x]
Chugalug it [2x]
Time after time [3x]
Learning your lesson [2x]
Will do you fine
Do you fine [2x]
