Well I beat a bad rap when I skip a soul trap 
Just trippin' and laughin' atthe crap 
Dap is what I get the best skins that I hit 
You know we rock thefuckin' joint and we split 
Singin' an ryhmin's what I'm better for 
When Idescribe I'm a scribe with a metaphor I use a simile lightly 
'cuz that shitsplayed 
The common way most ryhmes are made, ya know I rock like this I flow likethat 
But all those comparisons are just that 
Kickin' different styles I'll beright here 
Today, tomorrow, next week and next year I always say 
what I feel andthat is a promise 
Nothing in life is above being honest 
Sauna is cool comparedto being on stage 
But that's how it's gotta go in the stone age 
The fame in mygame I name rapture 
Like a polished rock I'll make it shine for sure 
Word isthat I've travelled become unravelled 
I been around the world baby gimme anapple 
I'll be your boogie man rather than son-of-sam 
What I am is what I am
Though we don't have too long to love a day a night 
We only love those who, loveus right back 
The kid is smart the kid is clever 
Stompin' in jack-o-lantern'sweather 
Backpack strapped 'cuz the world is cold 
Headphones pumpin' don't yaknow 
The kid is smart the kid is clever 
Stompin' in jack-o-latern's weather
Rocks his hood and playes it mellow
While maple leaves change into yellow 
And ohshit damn honey at it again 
Tryin' to beat my high score since the age of ten
See my high score flash on the back glass I was malcontented 
Doug in giftedclass 
Now here's the deal we came to heal we gonna rock in Rio 
Oh no it's not ajoke it's how we feel 
Put to test like a Sugar Ray scientist I'm always dancingin my 
Sunday best I'm betting on my bliss and my path is lit' see 
The microphoneis live and I'm rockin' my body 
Smooth like Reggie Miller in an airborne freezeframe
Funky like the kung-fu that can put you to shame 
The kid is smart the kidis clever 
Stompin' in jack-o-lantern's weather 
Backpack strapped 'cuz the worldis cold 
Headphones pumpin' don't ya know 
The kid is smart the kid is clever
Stompin' in jack-o-latern's weather 
Rocks his hood and playes it mellow 
Whilemaple leaves change into yellow I'm like hey wait a minute 
Give a check on twothen I'm ready to begin it 
With a boom boom bap coming outta your trunkies 
Givea fat shout out to the Phunk Junkeez 
Striken like a cancer taken chances 
But Ilove to see the girl windin' like the belly dancer 
Standin' up front with atight stomach showin 
Me on stage singin, flowin 
We just kickin' it live we justkickin' it live 
'Cuz if you can't kick it live you gonna die 
'Fraid so punk soquit talkin' junk 
You need a live show like a ball player needs a dunk
