Sometimes the only thing that saves you
Think of bad things luck never gave you
And although your true love has just left you
Well at least you mother kept you

Be sure that a dreams alive
There only short burst in life
Are you able to be satisfied
Do you expect fun all the time

Hey we can rock it easy and lay it in the fold
Hey we can shake you simply just by being cold
And if it falls apart will you still be my friend
Get back we're gonna stick together

And so many things that have gone wrong
At least you have ears to hear this song
And if you reading in close caption
There's still bad things that could have happened

Long time since we've first came here
And sometimes we fall on deaf ears
One thing I've got to say before sales dive
Stay positive and love your life

Hey we can rock it easy and lay it in the fold
Hey we can shake you simply just by being cold
And if it falls apart will you still be my friend
Get back we're gonna stick together
