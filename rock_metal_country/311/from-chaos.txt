From chaos comes clarity, I tell ya
what you appear to be, you ought to know
glycerin tears don't fool me, I tell ya
delusions plaguing everybody

Makin that hybrid music back in '90 now it's on ya
I hear we we're the model for the bad you front, we spawned ya
finding it hard to come original, we warned ya
we're shakin the white boys in New York, black girls in California
we come through hip-hop, drum-n-bass, and dancehall rhythms
you want our beats and lyrics, you want to get them
watchin you sink into the depths of opportunism
missing the point, music's about love not pessimism
I'm SA moving supreme and on my team
I rock the mic with a sweet lean
and you know that stated as a fact
the only DJ MC gettin' down like that
metaphorically we are the chief of police, you're rock n roll
and we're positive you stole more that just the radio
now it's 2, 1 and we are back in the control
the jammies are coming, people succumbing cuz we got soul

Everyone needs to forget upon re-enrty
orbiting space quantum saints, we're the only
beginning from a planet so naturally
gifted in the heart lies our technology
it's only right, right
entering in a space of pure delight, light
next contestant on this jam is, tight
feels spontaneous you'll improvise, vise

From chaos comes clarity, I tell ya
what you appear to be, you ought to know
glycerin tears don't fool me, I tell ya
delusions plaguing everybody

Don't even try it, you don't want to disrespect me
if dealing with punks was school, I'd have a Harvard degree
you can't make me hate you no mater how punk you act
no matter what you do I don't react
I'm a perfect example of not giving a fuck
about the catty rude people that just suck
what do you know all of the sudden, ah I usurp you
look it up in the dictionary to find out what I do
I go back to the style I came from
it's not something you can fake son
you're a con man who's run is done
you lead a world wide web of deception

Everyone needs to forget upon re-entry
orbiting space quantum saints, we're the only
beginning from a planet so naturally
gifted in the heart lies our technology
it's only right, right
entering in a space of pure delight, light
next contestant on this jam is, tight
feels spontaneous you'll improvise, vise

From chaos comes clarity, I tell ya
what you appear to be, you ought to know
glycerin tears don't fool me, I tell ya
