I can see it now have to show you how
The funny thing is that we couldn't have it any other way
Still it kills me when we say
All we've been through
All the congs that I've sung for you
We both know I'm gonna lose you

I hate to be alone
There comes a time to reap what you've sewn
All we've been through
All the songs that I've sung for you
We both know I'm gonna lose you

Let's think of all the good times
Instead of wish we could times
So much better that way
This is what I ask for
This is what I deserve
Be careful what you ask for
