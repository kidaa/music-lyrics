Coming like a nightmare word like I'm gonna go for it 
Fuckin' around what yagot to show for it 
Let it be know that I'm in the zone
And whatever I need Ijust pick up the phone 
'Cuz I'm true with it and you're new with it I just swingthe thing 
and then I'm through with it I don't need friends to act like foes
'Cuz I'm Nick Hexum the one who knows about things 
'Cuz it takes two and weswings better than you 
Then it's time for the dub so we roll out the club 
And you know just what I do I'm hitting in the freak mode 
Puttin' on a load sippin'on a guinny 
Then lo and behold una vision from bottom to top 
And I just can'tstop 311 show them the air is rarified 
But you don't give a damn 'cuz the grooveis hellafied 
Grew up punk, listening to funk I'm a hyper type of fella that doesnot touch junk 
You're the back of the pack and the bottom of the stack 
That'swaht you get when you're steady talkin' shit 
Not goin' for self that shit is onthe shelf 
It's 95 and we go for the hive 
Listen up this you're gonna bump tothis 
And if I'm feelin' mean I'm gonna clutch my fist 
Now when I say mean, Imean I'm gonna rock it 
You're gonna find out kid I'm bout to shock it 
When I'mon I'm gone I hear the beat that spawns 
The way we freak it and we kick up astorm
The day we turn to pop the show will stop 
So feel the beat and get lostnow 
Back to part 2 the hard way we play 
Sublime on time to all the fans I'm 
SAAnd if you don't know I say check the show 
Do what you got to on the dance floor
Some say the style is wack but I say fuck that 
Get the hell back and watch usrock the set 
We cast the mold bust it cold explode 
Megatrendsetters known aroundthe globe 
Friends takin' you where you never been 
We done what we wantedcraftin' poems 
You can rock there is a glow around you 
Lose control holmes justlike we do 
Hard to obtain brotha' what's my name 
Mad to find unlike ya mamma andyour masquerade I drive a mach-
1 no dashboard Jesus I hear voices say that's Doug Martinez 
You're all up in my mix like fuckin' Betty Crocker 
You thinkyou're playing me but actually you're a jocker 
You bad mouth me bitch man yougivin me juice
It aint nothin' but a party everybody get loose 
Notice what Idon't do when stress steps to me 
Whatever your complaint so sue me I say fuckthe naysayers and keep goin 
Gotta do what I gotta do to get the people glowin'
So let everybody gather the more the better I represent the traveler him 
he's ashredder
At ease with yourself and don't try to please me 
I'm just here todaythen quickly I'm out 
On the town one light I'm a glow worm 
For several hourswiggle jiggle like I'm a huge sperm 
Can't appreciate a brothers love of funkymusic 
You think I'm a silly rabbit 'cuz my style has tricks 
Of the way I feelnow I just got to rock 
The music be poppin through me like electric shocks Ithink 
and blink and I wink but that shits not tiny 
'Cuz in a blink of an eyelashyou will not find me 
You're the back of the pack and the bottom of the stack
That's what you get when you're steady talkin' shit 
Not goin' for self that shitis on the shelf 
'Cuz it's 95 and we go for the hive
