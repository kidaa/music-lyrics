You're a power spot rotating
Everchanging
Transmitting like a radio wave
Frequently feeling
What's goin' on
Times are weird all this static
Things erratic
Seems like we lost the magic
See hear how clear
Is inner quality
A yin and yang type of thang
Sacred geometry
Ascending mad
Energy crazy bad
You're something NASA
Fuckin' wish they had

Tune in for those who are wantin'
Vision feel it from within
Sing along
Tune in for those who are wantin'
Vision feel it from within
You know

You're a star creator
Soul craft generator
Movin' through time and space
Son you're a liberator
But you're memory
Has been erased
The things you knew
Misplaced check it out
Babylon
Life style we scorn
Now we live again
In LA Tokyo and New York
Come on pay a fee
Smoke your booty weed
Put gas in your tank
Keep you city bumpin'

Tune in for those who are wantin' 
Vision feel it from within 
Sing along [2x]
Tune in for those who are wantin' 
Vision feel it from within 
You know
