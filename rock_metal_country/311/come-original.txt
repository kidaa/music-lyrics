A warning to the crews out there who think they're hot
if you're not original rockers you will get shot
down by the kids neglectin' your art, the stuff you did
eventually it get so bad puts you to bed
cause when the lightning flashes sweet electricity
all the world then stands revealed with the clarity
of raw voltage, briefly we see and the hope is
you'll be able to tell just what dope is

Come on, come on
This is not a test there's no time to mope
how you gonna cope with radioactive isotope
and boss DJ illness upon you now quickly
infecting you fast upon the airwaves
this message brought to you by the so large system
activate and attune yourself with meditation
and green plants they've got mad life they're sentient
they're beautiful as you and they like to dance

1, 2, 3, 4
Everything we do we gotta come original
put your hands up in the air and prepare for battle
sit upon the rhythm like a tire upon a rim
we do it non-stop and then we do it again
some a them whine and some a them bitch
they can not do it never switch
comin' up from the heart and
delivered with a wild pitch
sit up on top the rhythm like a wild stallion
this is the ruling system
