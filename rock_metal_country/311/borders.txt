There are days I wanna leave LA
I wanna break out the maze
Escape the dark haze these days
So many kids I know your feelin' crazed
Crave material thangs and makin' slave wages
Baggy pockets only got laundry fluff
Livin' where rich people always buyin' some stuff
So you try to act tough and hide whats inside
Hold your head high gettin' fucked up and throwin' dice
As bad as yours and bad enough I'm sure
My heart wants to love but must navigate through war
Cuz seein' that we're wired to short circuit
Must mean the meek who will inherit the earth already work it

There's a land by the sand grab the money
Plastic the life end of the century
People actin' fake can't see the omens
Wake up yourself cause change is comin'
There's a land by the sand grab the money
Hollywood is such a place fuelin' the frenzy
And everybody starts to peep around corners
Before they take their next step they know their borders

In this $19.98 plus shipping and handling type
Netherworld everytime merchandise dips in our coffers
We buy that image that cost of livin' uh huh
The fakest shit and act cool our friends are watchin'
Attention shoppers check the selection in our reflection
Don't you feel good does it enhance your fresh complexion
You gotta have it you got got to have it [2x]
As the world turns and all the money we burn
On the bullshit to make us happy sometimes we never learn
We're self centered we think were better
We look down as a people upon our elders

There's a land by the sand grab the money
Now let go of it cause it's dissolving
It created all your fears and kept you hustling
Made you sever all the ties to your family
There's a land by the sand grad the money
Plastic the life end of the century
People actin' fake can't see the omens
Wake up yourself cause change is comin'
There's a land by the sand grab the money
Hollywood is such a place fuelin' the frenzy
And everybody starts to peep around corners
Before they take their next step they know their borders
