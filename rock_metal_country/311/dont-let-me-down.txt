Don't Let Me Down 
Don't Let Me Down Again 
Don't Let Me Down
Don't Let Me Down Again 
Don't Let Me Down 
Don't Let Me Down 
Swelled up eye's oh my the girl got beat 
And the stupid mother fucker who madeyou so 
That punk is a coward let that be told I hear voices in the night thatare electric 
He kicks the shit out of her because he's heartless 
She won't leaveshe has low self esteem 
He's got gravitational pull 
Sucks her body till herheart and her limbs grow cold 
Hang in there use your head 
How can I love youafter you're dead 
Hang in there keep trying 
How can I love you after dying
Here's what you got to tell him I'm thinking of a picture that's keeping me institch 
You're causing me a mental glitch 
'Cause jealousy is such a bitch Ihereby emancipate myself from that 
You can consider yourself free to flirt andchat 
With whoever you want It should have always been that way 
The way that youwant the way that you play 
My mind is blank slate I'm pretending you're erased
You cannot let me down when I cannot see your face
Hang in there use your head
How can I love you after you're dead
Hang in there keep trying 
How can I loveyou after dying 
Ode to a beat up girl, I know you're out there 
Stronger thanyou think, stand up if you care 
Get up off the ground, don't let me down 
Get upoff the ground, don't let me down 
Hang in there use your head 
How can I loveyou after you're dead 
Hang in there keep trying 
How can I love you after dying 
And you, I'm a let you pass without kicking you're ass 
Because I'm above it youhurt someone I love 
It takes two to make a thing go right and that's trite 
But one just to sneak and weasel through the night 
If you hurt her again I'll fuckyou up 
If you hurt her again I'll fuck you up, fuck you up 
If you hurt her again I'll fuck you up 
If you hurt her again I'll fuck you up, fuck you up
