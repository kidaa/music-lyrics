Whoa oh prisoner
My pretty oh oh prisoner

A black ocean is the sky above
Tiny lights bob what star you from

Trapped in material plane
She wants to fly and they think she's insane
But she knows what she know
Give that girl wings and that's all she wrote

Twilight zone [2x]
I'm floating in the dark alone and
Is there any love out here let me know

A laser lights pinpoints the top of my dome
Then through my body
As if Scotty's beaming up a wayward soul
Mutant races in an ancient universe
Dark shadows humans rhymin' in a raggae verse

It's gone if you blink
I can see it as soon as you think it

Dancehalls crystal balls
On sidewalk malls
Psychic people outdoors reading palms

I believe that you know more
To survive the dimension if four

Oh prisoner
My pretty oh oh prisoner

Look at the way she's searching
Trapped in a world that's hurting
So bad it makes her cry
But I won't let her say good bye

Twilight zone [2x]
I'm floating in the dark alone and [2x]
Is there any love out here let me know
No way [2x]
