Chill light on my sight as my ego becomes 
A funky child with some words onmy tongue 
Be like intake of breath and my mouth gets loose 
While I scatter myspit I dream of juice 
Have you ever made out in dark hallways 
Displayed a kissthat made your day or say 
Played a track from your record collection 
It's yourmix, congratulations 
We've changed a lot and then some - some 
You know that wehave always been down - down 
And if I ever don't thank you - you 
Then just letme do it now 
Come back in I bet you light up when we start the show 
Follow menow very closely 'cuz I told you so 
You know we glow because we throw sun-rays
We be freaky and we wanna stay 
We've changed a lot and then some - some 
You knowthat we have always been down - down 
And if I ever don't thank you - you 
Thenjust let me do it now 
Lightning strikes yo we be in that violent force of light
Guaranteed to turn it out as bad as dolemite 
Cuz we're dope kid change like achameleon and the 
Channel whenever that wack show real world is on 
You know wedazzle like ghetto box boomin' battles 
Rattle inside your head feel redeemedlike cola bottles 
Fall in love with your teachers on the wax 
We are self madecheck the technique, 311 in LA 
We've changed a lot and then some - some 
You knowthat we have always been down - down 
And if I ever don't thank you - you 
Thenjust let me do it now 
Keep my feet on the ground 
Keep my head in the clouds
Electrified by the sound 
Comes from the down - and 
We've changed a lot and thensome - some 
You know that we have always been down - down 
And if I ever don'tthank you - you 
Then just let me do it now
