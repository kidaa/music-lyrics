Sunshines
Are you outside
I am a simpleton by choice not speaking to hear my voice
Sunshines
Why are you sleeping
Gotta get outside

Cover the ground on foot
Not hithing around your spur
Over the river and trough the woods
I've come this far to bring in the goods
I get high, even when I don't try
Let 'em pass by with a wink to the eye
I reserve the right to be stoned
I reserve the right to take it to collect them sums I have the right
Don't try to be, there's really no point in you biting me
I'm glad to see that it's easy for me to be an MC
Let me tell you a little story
Like my dog Bobby, he hated the pool man
So I tried to play Kotter and make things cool
And I said just let him smell you, hold out your hand
He reached it on out, and then bam
He bit him, he bit him so fuckin' hard
Blood was steady gushin' all over my back yard
I kept apologizin', I felt so fuckin' bad
The dude was so cool, he didn't even get mad
He said man don't sweat it, that's the dog's meaning
Took some Neosporin and went bak to his cleaning

Thought I had a dream or else it was a movie
Your mind can have a joint easy like jungle boogie
$600 freebie and I gots my job
Would you mind come but I gots my dog
Come you can foam the water with the bone
I wanna tell my mom, ring her on the phone
Cherry popsicle, icy, cold, freezing
Loves on his gums now that he is teething
Got a wee-wee pass, lay them by the door
Nasty Little shits he dropped them on the floor

Sunshines
Are you outside
I am a simpleton by choice
Not speaking to hear my voice
Sunshines
Why are you sleeping
Gotta get outside
