Ooh, what else can I do [2x]
Ooh, face in a screw
Ooh, racing to prove
You never remember
The blossom sender
Still in a rub a dub style

Long time you don't know what I'm doing whoa
Long time see troubles are brewing yeah
Stick to the way you rock it and know that
You'll cope with that
Not gonna let it sit til I say
How dope was that
Keep you head pumping til you get in the zone
Not giving up not going home

Stick to the way you rock it just do it real slow
Nobody can really say cuz nobody really know
Only thing that matters if it's funky to you
You got a choice of what you can do
