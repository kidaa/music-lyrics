Head rush
come on, we take the stage
and what's up, it's on
this is a blow up
so just listen up
just take your mouth off interrupt
we came to throw down
it's a showdown
and you know why, we never lie
get the lowdown son
we're mashin and bashin
the stage we're crashin
if you're on the roof
I know you're dancin
I bet we get the people jumpin overseas
and I know why you're bustin mp3's
the shit shit shocker
the hiphop rocker
wiser than Baraka
stronger than Chewbacca
KISS never did this nor Ozzy Ozbourne
shakin that ass and shakin your firstborn
back to the future and past to the front
we appear like adrenaline it's just that blunt

Two score and five we came alive
a minor blow up has started
a song for the newly sane and
the broken hearted

Head rush
come on, we take the stage
and what's up, it's on
from midnight til daylight
you best believe that we're sick tight
you're cryin' bout your life
I think it's absurd
what could be so bad
you come from the suburbs
just like me
but I could never despair
most people in this world
ain't got shit to spare
suckas look up to thugs
they like the attitude
but fuck that
I'm talkin' gratitude
they harder they act
just to hide their insecurity
I'm talking honestly
we are assuredly
dope, I smoke it
but not everyday
cuz anything all the time's
a drag I say
three eleven you want to get next to them
my name's Nick H, E, X, U, M

Two score and five we came alive
a minor blow up has started
a song for the newly sane and
the broken hearted
we keep an eye for each other then again
our known associates endure
we make a sick tight connection when we
see our true people on tour

Head rush
keep it going now
you know we get it right
we keep it flowing now
we're sick tight

We keep an eye for each other then again
our known associates endure
we make a sick tight connection when we
see our true people on tour

Head rush
keep it going now
you know we get it right
we keep it flowing now
we're sick tight
