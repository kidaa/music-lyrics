In a minute everything you have can all be straight gone
In a minute things you though were tied can come straight undone
How about some knocks on wood some so far it's so good any day
What you think is solid earth can jump up and spread out
To the north and south that's what plates are about
Nature has no conscience no kindness or ill will
The dreams they had make me sad because of the vides of them
When one girl dreamt a fire in hers and then it happened
To me and my family my bro's and I were driving
The RV bleeding flames us leaping through fire surviving
Zoned with no home there was fire all on it
Umm let me have my life I want it

I'm gonna let you know that I said
We're coming in kill we're coming chill
We've comin in how we will
Gone to tell the whole world what's the deal
And I say know no critical boarder cuz
We do what we want
Got more funky styles that my laser jet got font
Not one to get over sounding like the norm
Friendly to the radio all that shit is corn
All we coming with is a little bit of swing
And we go on like it ain't no thing

Omaha stylee did not think there was one
Where you know the radios weak and the shows are more fun
But you know we fuck up the dance since 1988
Many did not think when they hear that we come from this state

Still we're down like that [x3]
Makin the funk that smells of skunk

Such occasions occur back in the day
It begins you're a raw kid all the way
Son of a gun but they you drifted
All are endowed but few are gifted
At the break of dawn behaving like a spy
Lampin in the light the cold world awakens
Deeper is the light to open up the sky
Look into my eyes see the dialatin'
Omaha Stylee is the shit we come with man

Embedded in out souls it breathes out from this band 
We always knew that we could
Thank you if you too felt we would

We will arise explore these worlds and find the grass roots
How to crew to do the grinding of the grounds to brew
My dude on the one come off like Teflon
Rock your shit and you will rise on

If you're a farmer outstanding in your field say
Do as you eill do as you wish follow your bliss say
We travel round the world giving it our best
Like to see the people dancing and bouncing and the rest
The hammer and the chisel and the rule it compass
We forged the sword chariots of war our battle axe
There's much power in anger but loves a bigger banger
Complete props to my crew this is what we do
