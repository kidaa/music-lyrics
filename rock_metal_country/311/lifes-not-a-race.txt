A day like today is for you
to let your mind unwind, like you ought to
feel the earth turn round when your heart rate slows
contemplating the thing only your heart knows
that life's not a race

So hard to believe part of me will fade
in a mystery, in a future world
long ago, parts feel for your love 
and lives to tell you so

The world revolves around your mind in a golden spiral
the natural way that things organize
you can't stop entropy so why even try
observe the conscious flow and don't mystify
life's not a race

So hard to believe part of me will fade
in a mystery, in a future world
long ago, parts feel for your love 
and lives to tell you so

Uh, hey
slippin' into a trance
a chance encounter in the autumn
what do I see an opportunity
and then, I got' em
saw the chill-out mix
carve some space
to make you want to listen
it's a bubbling spring
and double in kings
of this soundsystem

So hard to believe part of me will fade
in a mystery, in a future world
long ago, parts feel for your love 
and lives to tell you so

Do you see world without end
the rising my friend
imagine cloud like
you will form again
through spacey boredom
in the autumn of late afternoon
you are calm, just like a sleepy room
