This is happening, this here is life
days spent pondering, truth is a knife
respect due to those who have caught it
dedicated to our friends who have sought it

This is happening, this here is life
days spent pondering, truth is a knife
respect due to those who have caught it
dedicated to our friends who have sought it

Brainstorm superseding the norm
when we come together, new planet is born
you revel in the chaos when people are torn
then you come to find out your welcome is worn

We are advancing and retracting visionaries
really here, it's not imaginary
the way you work your mind, you find it's an art
where you feel it most, you feel in your heart

Everybody gets confused
delusions are everywhere
buy into fakeness, you'll feel used
double talk fills the air
looking all over for happiness
I've got the will to live
it's in front of you right now, don't you feel stressed
falls through my hands live a sieve

I'm on a new high
with a pen and a pad
and for fun I attend
a jam that's super bad
at the same time
give it all that I have
whether you're square
or the coolest lad

Eatin up my people, purgin their words
the jammies take flight like Icarus birds
drop on you and you get hurt
cuz if you're under the rock, you get worked

Say, what gives, are you after me
breakin me down won't you let me be
won't be having none of your mind control
it ain't gonna work on me no more
I said what gives, are you after me
breakin me down won't you let me be
won't be having none of your mind control
it ain't gonna work on me no more

woo! ha-ha!
you get worked

If you don't watch your back
people are scheming on you
exploiting all the things you lack
they'll do what they have to do
your good will is something they'll crack
how many times will the bust
your originality they will hack
don't know just who you can trust

I'm on a new high
with a pen and a pad
and for fun I attend
a jam that's super bad
at the same time
give it all that I have
whether you're square
or the coolest lad

Eatin up my people, purgin their words
the jammies take flight like Icarus birds
drop on you and you get hurt
cuz if you're under the rock, you get worked

Yeah, you get worked
yeah, you get worked
yeah, you get worked
yeah, you get worked

Say, what gives, are you after me
breakin me down won't you let me be
won't be having none of your mind control
it ain't gonna work on me no more
you get worked
