Let the cards fall
Let the cards fall where they may
All I can do all I can say
Gotta move to trust my instincts and surrender
Let my song sing itself
I am they who admit what they don't know
All my friends excitable they'll tell you so

So let the cards fall and fall where they may
In checkin' on our conviction dick
We run from the shit our own way
So what you will so what you wish
Follow your bliss on everyday
Never ask for an advantage
Let the cards fall where they may

So let the cards fall
And fall where they please
Ask me while we're at it
I do it with ease
Taking up space is the people
Who wish to hold you back
But in reality the majority
Really don't give jack
