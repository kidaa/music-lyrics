And I I notice the tapestries on the wall as well 
and I I stand up and hit my head on the mobile 
and you and you look around too 
and we time passes easily 

ai-yi-yi 
ai-yi-yi 

I've opened up my mind 
so you can step inside 
you could expect to find 
a scenic rhyme 

Pointyhead pizzeria perfect penetration 
mezcal cuts off my brain communication 
belligerence, lost of my intelligence
talkin mess like shut up and listen to me 
because cuttin' through the crap is my specialty 
like a bomb I'm droppin yes a ton a lead 
you're tryin' to figure out the last thing I said 
I'm a Redwood, I love to be a tree yes I'm a Druid 
my words they're flowin' out like a fluid 
never give in never conform 
I'll be bustin out rhymes in a triplet form 

Right now 
right now 
right now 

In another room I sit and contemplate 
that winter night my words were filled with hate 
in second sight I should have known my fate 
but it's all right now we're in a different state 

ai-yi-yi 
ai-yi-yi 

I've opened up my mind 
so you can step inside 
you could expect to find 
a scenic rhyme 

Expiate, to make amends for hostilities 
it's easy to see that for me, in reality 
I'm not one of those fools 
with an ecclesiastical whitewash 
to set my ethical standards 
you'll never catch me lookin' to Ann Landers 
or Moses or the law or even Buddha 
if there's one thing I know 
it's always be true to myself 
and learn from experience 
educated by nights of violence, trips to jail, 
broken knuckles and friendships 
but that gives me the power to write a groove that rips 

Right now 
right now 
right now 
I am 
I am 
I'm supposed to be and I am, damn
