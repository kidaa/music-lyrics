I used to have this idea
That getting a silver medal wouldnt set me free
Oh but you know that I really dont need
To catch no fame or credit
Nor a big fat bank account with no debit
So just set me straight,
Cause  your peace of mind just cant wait

I sent a telegram on , urgent
I hope it gets to my door, my big big door
Im going free if they kill me
Cause this aint much better anyway

Just push it away

Oh success, that elusive brainchild of breed
Something you want, not need
Face it, cause
Money cant buy true friendship or trust
And applause will never be any substitute for love
But not me man, check it out

I sent a telegram on , urgent
I hope it gets to my door, my big big door
Im going free if they kill me
Cause this aint much better anyway

Just push it away
