Don't fear mere words cuz if it takes a word ruin ya
You should have already hard you're finished through and soon ya
See that stifling sentences is so much more suspicious
Much worse could come of that so much more delicious
To the dastardly basturdly plans of little mice and men
Ugly rears its head and speaks from now and then
People love to disagree so avoid the endless bout make no attempt
To try and suss the stupid out
But of the racist institutions simple minds belong
Not happy just being human, no wish to get along
Little people need exclusions sucker groups to throng
It makes them feel special it makes them feel strong
Now I got a click but it's more like a family
Not an ethnic trip more like an ethic see
I write the rhyme today tell it to you later
Whether were coming in wack or what it's a waste to be a hater

Graffiti bombs-from the palms-love is so strong
Can't be stopped too long
For the night it will come
Shaped in the form of Mars that stone afar
Ghetto cool Oh well
Now you feel the spell
The color rocks the bell
The king of swing rise to the top
The thythm possessed in ya and it don't stop
The mise is broken The demon locin'
Dropping the bomb and all that is left is the smokin'
Cloakin' chokin; the lyrics are spoken
Infrared vision scopin' condition
Now breakin' 'em all to pieces like a sly rap bandit
Witha fly Lu-Kang kick in Mortal Combat and I land it
So get your own back when I jam it cold and
Hearing about you rhyme style been outmoded
The dopest flow upon the planet
Dope is the word the bro throw up on the down low goddammit

You juice your fucking friends like Dracula
But when we kick you out you're just brokula
You left a big surprise from Pacific Bell
Called all your relatives and your friends in Hell
Now let me tell you something you fucking piece of shit
You'll never have no money, now tell me was it worth it
You leave a trail of lies that's why you keep moving
We won't come after you we'd only end up provin
In the end revenge send ends to the defendant
I know that statement's true I wear it like a pendant
I know you'll hear this song so I think it's funny
The name is theif or trust and money.

Like Captain Picard we come hard in light years
Our star has long bust but now reappears
In your sky at night rising and immense
Yes you see ourselves in the shine of it
And so passing under the dome of the great sky
Beware we are the stars holmes that you ruled by
Where death reborn into the world is a gift
So the future with no voice of its own will uplift
All is gone
All is calm y'all
