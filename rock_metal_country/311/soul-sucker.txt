All through the scandel 
Of the small own scene I always handle 
You like to think my spirit is weak 
I thought you knew I thought you knew, 
it was gonna be this way I guess 
I thought that cuz I told you every day 
I know you're tryin' to suck my soul 
Oh 
Well I'm sick of the chinks and 
I'm sick of the bars 
I'm sick of the sea and blows to the stars 
I'm sad yea its getting me mad Hah, 
I'm tired of you pulling on me 
It makes you look foolish and you can't see 
That its weak just stand on your feet 
Get your arms off my shoulder 
And get a little older you 
Wait life's a creep it's a good life with me 
So take me 
But you cannot, cannot suck my soul, no 
Check it out 
Well the soulsuckers must be 
Suckin never can tell 
Well the soulsuckers must be 
Suckin never can tell 
The soulsuckers must be certain navagatin' 
The soulsuckers must be certain navagatin' 
The soulsuckers must be certain navagatin' 
But I promise you, I promise you I will not do what I want to anyway 
You're out of love 
Cuz the souls that you suck 
You're nothin so I say 
Make peace with me 
Cuz I'm sure that you'll see that its no big deal to me I wish you the best 
Move on and test without me 
Or someone like me 
Cuz you cannot suck my soul 
Oh Well you know the time 
YOu always are tryin' 
To flip your wings 
And make you not lyin 
Its love its always the same 
It's human dexterity too keep open eyes 
Its true it happened to you 
Its sad to be talkin 
While others do the walkin to the Promised Land 
The way that you creep 
Makes you look like a yeast 
So tell me But you cannot, cannot suck my soul 
NO, no Cuz the soulsuckers must be certain navagatin 
The soulsuckers must be certain navagatin 
The soulsuckers must be certain navagatin 
Check it out 
The soulsuckers must be certain navagatin
