People sing about the coming of spring 
But what is comin' down around it's snow or it's rain 
It's insane and I'm still in the same gang 
The way the weatheract's it's a shame ok 
Badder behavior in our shit is flavor 
Grandiose endeavorsyes the quest is greater 
Make no mistake I know the time and I wake I slip onlywhen 
P-Nut gets me baked from that shake 
Yeah you can't fuck with this 
You're Walter Middy don't take it as a dis 
But the fantasy has got to end this minute I had a fucking dream 
and yo now I'm in it I've been at many function 
but I knowI'm about the function 
If someone brings you down keep punching 
We bunched in alittle house where conditions got squalid 
But where we at now - solid I concurtime it slurs and it blurs 
The vision like a drug and yo it's the word
Howabsurd deliver us from nerds 
And funky 40 oz. glass littered curbs 
Soon thechurch pitted bell will clang 
Boys on the corner mack with slang play a dicegame 
When I walk by it some bag lady goes sha-na-na-na 
Your street time islimited 'cuz this band rocks it 
Take your whole crew put 'em all in your pocketIf your feelin' sick rub it on 
with vicks 'N take 2 to 6 of our sweet super mix 
Your street time is limited 'cuz this band rocks it 
Take your whole crew put 'emall in your pocket 
If your feelin' sick we got the elixir 
Rub it on down withthe sweet super mixer 
Late night radio players late night airwave invaders 
Yeahwe got the force late night radio 
Zooma zooma zooma yeah we got the boom
Blowin' up the spot so so give us room 
We prowl sometimes we howl hysterical
When we take the stage see a miracle I realize today nothing is more vestigial
Than the young space walkin' individual 
For years and years bubbling up withsoul power 
To detonate this planet or reach another 
Yeah we take it up a notch
We diggin' the shit so deep like 
Ralston digs scotch 
Botch this and I'll regretit no that's not what I'm saying 
Remember this instead I'm staying 
We played ina little house where conditions got squalid 
But where we at now - solid 
Wehauled a van with a RV that was a bad call It all went up in flames 
but Ihaven't seen it all 
Homey steps to me and say hey where ya goin' 
Oh just headin'back to where I done my growin' 
If you must go somewhere over the rainbow 
Theadventures of a cosmic hero 
From planet to planet my tags a crater 
If you're notin the future you're not here either 
Labeled psychedelic we can play disco 
Whenthe going gets weird you know the weird turn pro 
Your street time is limited'cuz this band rocks it 
Take your whole crew put 'em all in your pocket 
If yourfeelin' sick rub it on with Vicks 'N take 2 to 6 of our sweet super mix 
Yourstreet time is limited 'cuz this band rocks it 
Take your whole crew put 'em allin your pocket 
If your feelin' sick we got the elixir 
Rub it on down with thesweet super mixer
