You know I'm ready, yes to rock steady 
my name's not Betty or Teddy, but Nick 
and I'm what you might call a heretic 
yes, and I am from Nebraska my girl is satisfied 
you can ask her, you know I've never visited Alaska 
huh, where the oil was spilt, that drunken captain should 
be killed for polluting the sea, an atrocity 
that fucks with me, well 
this one goes to all the birds that drown 

Fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down 
fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down 
fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down 
fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down 

yo, fuck the bullshit 
and get with it 
it's time to throw down 
and so I said it words of wisdom that will keep 
you all guessing cause I'm tired of laying and 
I'm tired of messing around 
with all your suckers yes, those stupid mother fuckers 
who put down what I do, I stand alone with a groove that's new 
like now that you know that the rhymes that I say 
are mine alone and I surely dont play 
I kick in the teeth a condescending frown 

Fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down 
fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down 
fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down 
fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down 

Right about now I'd like to turn over the mic 
over to my mentor SA Martinez 

I'm sly, Nicoli, he know why 
get this kid high i'm gonna fly 
right out of this world and in to the next 
with a power ?? over worse than ?? 
go on open, i'm poetry in motion 
dont joke when you pray 
my mind is spoken 
the latest, the greatest, of hip-hop persuaders 
I find a rhyme that always amazes brothers 
the mic drum is loomin' 
and in your mind my rap rhyme is bloomin like a flower 
fuck the bullshit p-nut 
talk shit with your 

Just fuck the has been's and their stupid ass rambling 
promises it's bullshit they can't come through with 
do it in the basement no complacence 
it's time to kick the fuck in, begin to win no sin and then 
share it, declare it in the public domain refrain 
perfectly sad if ? was about 
but it's not so I'd frown then I'd give it a shot 
super dumb lyrics make you think I'm a clown 

I don't give a fuck it's time to throw down 
fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down 
fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down 
fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down 
fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down
