I wanna do what's right
Be kind to every single body
Open up to light
Just let it flow through
My body

But sometime's 
I'm unsure [2x]
I tell my baby 

I'm slippin' into darkness
I'm creepin' into darkness
I don't want to start this
I'm attracted to darkness

Be positive with love
Just see the good in everybody

But sometimes 
I'm unsure [2x]
I tell my baby 

There's something going on
In my heart
I feel it weigh me down
So I reach up for
Wide blue sky
Try to pull it into
The deep arc of my arms

I'm slippin' into darkness
I'm creepin' into darkness
I don't want to start this
I'm attracted to darkness
