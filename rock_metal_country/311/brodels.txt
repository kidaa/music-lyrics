Ooh you know we pepper you 
With a sonic assault side step a you I cannotthink of a better way 
That we could celebrate freedom 
Than make up a set ofgoals and cold beat 'em 
See dumb verbal tags like audio spaghetti
Give a shoutto the one they call 
Yeti I bet he put the cabash on any foes whatsoever 
Likeoriginal brodel Trevor 
Positive vibe merchant grandson of Lord Buckley 
Scottish Ralston shows up if you're lucky 
Ad Raspler the sweed a friend in deed 
He'skeeping an eye on the other guy's greed
These are 311 characters I dubbedeveryone 
The story ain't over but my rhyme is done 
It was the year that I firsttouched ground 
So I grabbed the microphone and I got down 
Just like James Browngather round of our sight and sound 
Pound for pound we throw down ratherprofound 
I'll put you in another world I can't hear you 
Like having phone sexwith a deaf girl 
No doubt we got the jams that'll smack ya I penned three booksof lyrics 
2 for action 1 for backup 
'Cuz I'm a cold rockin' brother gottransistor tunes 
And it feels real good to get close to you 
The brodels is thenazz and the nazz knows where it's at 
The brodels is the nazz who knows a catwho can feed a cat 
The goal is to be a poet and a carpenter 
To be one who lovesto be one who works 
The nazz not something that can be given 
The brodel isinside you it comes from within 
When I feel into the sea 
When the world came andkissed me 
Transformed my shit told the shark I was a dolphin 
Swam quick funnythough 
Pirranahs chilled and laughed at 
The way that I took off my polka dots ontop of that 
The whales know I'm quick watch out 
And I get funky fresh as for thefishes 
I'm lit luminous I'm not nouveau techno I glow like a glacial 
In skinthat swims faster than speed I am I be dropped out of nothing 
I will return tonothing
Rotate my style my rhyme my way magician of a rhythm 
Lover of animalsdamn I wanna hear 'em 
Aquatic my way I got soul shape 
Well I'm 6 foot 3 andlike Mohammed Ali I float like a butterfly 
but sting like poison ivy 
Drive a 69lincoln suicide doors
Around the town I'm slinking fat subs of course 
We're thegreatest show on earth 
You know we turn it out daily
In and out of town like Barnum and Bailey I know that is a simile 
but I couldn't resist 
From Solomon Roadie for the PJ's I don't think he'll be pissed I eat a cobb salad, 
smokedfish, duck, or clam chowder 
Chill with indica and 
Guinness Steer clear of whitepowder I run into my brother give him a pound 
and a yodel 
They know my word isbond talkin' bout the brodels 
The brodels is the nazz and the nazz knows whereit's at 
The brodels is the nazz who knows a cat who can feed a cat 
The goal isto be a poet and a carpenter 
To be one who loves to be one who works 
The nazznot something that can be given 
The brodel is inside you it comes from within
And we're fresh dude just check my man P 
He said I will not muddle my mind withimpertinency 
Lost a lot in Vegas plays a lot of Sega 
Saw a phrase that he likesand put it on his leg 
And we're fresh dude just check my man D he said 
Comin'in ruff and tuff all systems are tweakin' 
People all over the world they must bethinkin' 
All the shit that we kickin' our shoes must be stinkin'
