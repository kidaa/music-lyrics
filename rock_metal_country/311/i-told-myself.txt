Picked up on the wrong scent
not gonna make a dent
how many times
are you in my rhymes
burn me once shame on thee
but burn me again, shame on me
I'm chasing and facing the point misplacing
when I think of you my mind's racing
I'm spacing out when I get to the point
of no return, I get burned
I told myself I'm through with you
the last thing that I'll ever do
let down my guard shoudln't be too hard
I know it's over, got to elevate, disregard

I can't believe I fell for it, but did it again
I told myself I'm gonna quit, but did it again
I can't believe I fell for it, but did it again
I told myself I'm gonna quit, but

This was supposed to be the last time
I told myself this wouldnt happen again
I told myself I wasn't ever going to call you
I told myself I wasn't going to let you back in
but here I am dialing, trying

I told myself to get a hold myself
I won't freak out, let you tweak out
on ecstacy not next to me
somethin tells me baby girl that you're testin me
I told myself to get a hold myself
and I'm tryin' I'm not lyin'
don't make me mad, you know I love you bad
I want to sniff the glue that hold me to you
I told myself to get a hold myself
but don't rush me can't you trust me
the sound I hear whenever you are near
I know it's never wrong and it's my favorite song

I can't believe I fell for it, but did it again
I told myself I'm gonna quit, but did it again
I can't believe I fell for it, but did it again
I told myself I'm gonna quit, but

This was supposed to be the last time
I told myself this wouldnt happen again
I told myself I wasn't ever going to call you
I told myself I wasn't going to let you back in
but here I am dialing, trying

And now it's all turned bad
turned bad, turned bad
your ploy to make me jealous
is obvious and sad
it has the opposite effect
now you're left with what you had
you had

The rain comes down as love turns to dust
I was joking she took me serious
the rain comed down as love turns to dust
I was joking she took me serious
yes, serious

This was the last time that I was ever going to call you
I told myself I wouldn't let you back in
but here I am dialing, trying
