My computer is future shockin'
download this and you'll start talkin'
upgraded, you're now walkin'
compatible with all that is rockin'
comin' on fast, it's getting' digital
it's so huge, like a spiritual
rippling out to every individual
this is life, it is a miracle

Evolution has exponential timing
it'll be half as long
till the next breakthrough that blows our mind
its up to the people to brave on with experimentation
move forth the species
by using our imagination

But can we handle it
could we dismantle it
or should we fear the void
and just be para-paranoid
if it's understood
it could be used for good, and would
if you will believe in
all we can conceive

On the periodic table they got it all wrong
let me lay it down for you in this song
people want PT, they want AU
but lemme tell you what you really ought to do
figure out ways to master silicon
fiber-optic connectors, whatever's beyond
so many people don't even attempt to understand
the limitless possibilities of man

Evolution has exponential timing
it'll be half as long
till the next breakthrough that blows our mind
its up to the people to brave on with experimentation
move forth the species
by using our imagination

But can we handle it
could we dismantle it
or should we fear the void
and just be para-paranoid
if it's understood
it could be used for good, and would
if you will believe in
all we can conceive

I feel trapped, i gotta adapt
remain calm collecting before I get zapped
my computer is a rebel, acting all fine and
just like that payin' me no mind
what's up, is it's program over come by a glitch
is it becoming conscious 
and if so, ain't that a bitch
i'll paid too much for this piece
i'll be damned if it tries any funny business
it'll be the one that pays the price

Evolution has exponential timing
it'll be half as long
till the next breakthrough that blows our mind
its up to the people to brave on with experimentation
move forth the species
by using our imagination

using our imagination

But can we handle it
could we dismantle it
or should we fear the void
and just be para-paranoid
if it's understood
it could be used for good, and would
if you will believe in
all we can conceive

Yes we can handle it
we could dismantle it
we should not fear the void
and just be para-paranoid
if it's understood
it could be used for good, and would
if you will believe in
all we can conceive
