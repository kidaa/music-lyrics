Who's got the herb? is what the young boys ask me 
Who's got the herb? and then elders tell me 
Who's got the herb? is what the young girls ask me 
Who's got the herb? not the dread-locks 

Skunk, bud, indica 
Sativa, my reefer, la arriba 
Skunk, bud, indica

When we roll a big one 
it feels so right 
When we smoke it in our bong 
it feels so nice 

Who's got the herb? is what the young boys ask me 
Who's got the herb? and then the elders tell me 
Who's got the herb? is what the young girls ask me 
Who's got the herb? not the dread-locks 

Who's got the herb? 
Who's got the herb? 
Who's got the herb? 
Who's got the herb? What I'm talkin' 'bout 
Cramacaca cayaca die shocka fryaca 
From a coppa, yes I'm tellin' you 
Cramacaca cayaca, die shocka fryaca 
From a coppa

Who's got it? Who's got the herb? 
Who's got it? Who's got the herb? 
311, whoa, whoa, whoa 
Who's got the herb? 

311's got the herb and you can't avoid that 
and ya do want your hands with a fat blunt sack 
chill with indica and guiness, steer clear of white powder 
kick it you sing it in a space, go out to play it louder 

Plague my brain with no cocaine 
I don't wanna, I don't wanna go insane 

Roll up the bones if you can affix a word to smoke it 
except for you're doomed in the morning if you bake the hills 
Oh and I get up to the sun and then I smoke out 
It's beginning to smell like Mota and I'm high with no doubt, sing 

Plague my brain with no cocaine 
I don't wanna, I don't wanna go insane 

If you want to harm the 
world then you can stop the 
herb and you can use the 
serve and use the warrant.
