Wake your mind up, clear your eyes up
move and rise up before your times up
clock is ticking, your caught slippin'
stop to realize, look and listen

Well I guess that's life
when you see a dark road up the way
and I guess that's life
when you gotta roll through anyway
now don't scream, don't fight
fear never ever made it go away
same ghost town as yesterday
made you feel like love was miles away

Wake your mind up, clear your eyes up
move and rise up before your times up
clock is ticking, your caught slippin'
stop to realize, look and listen

Now those sleepless nights
thoughts just cloud up my brain
feeling helpless, repeating the same
old memories of pain and I wish it would rain, yo
gimmie starlit skies for dreamland
I know it's really smaller than it seems but when
the pressure gets under my skin
I just wanna get out and scream in the wind, yo

The world we're livin in is complicated
the streets that we walk on are dark and jaded
a wandering suld that's filled with hatred
in it is poison, the youth is tainted
social engineering keeps us separated
media control is highly overrated
ignorance is bliss to those uneducated
listen to the message cuz it's time we faced it

Wake your mind up, clear your eyes up
move and rise up before your times up
clock is ticking, your caught slippin'
stop to realize, look and listen

I'm controller of my destination
gotta change my mind to help me break away
the sun creeps over the hillside to shed this light
no man could take away
and I guess that's life
you see a new side from the norm
a new direction and meaning to the form
and the calm in the eye of a storm, yo

Show me a desert that can never be drenched
I'll show you a thirst that can never be quenched
temptation chronicles, the story of my life
been spent on a dose of balancing strife
inspiration it comes and goes
you can bet when it hits, I'm on the phone
singing to my voicemail trying to get it down
in a sensation of shape shifting sound
you're telling fables to cover up your foibles
from overindulgence on things you find enjoyable
designed to take my mind away from the truth
try to make me out to play the sleuth
they want you to think someone's watching you
so they can make up a set of rules for you
I'm just trying to find a path that I can stomach
just trying to make some sense out from it, unh
don't stop, don't stop what you got
don't stop til you find the sweet spot

Wake your mind up, clear your eyes up
move and rise up before your times up
clock is ticking, your caught slippin'
stop to realize, look and listen
