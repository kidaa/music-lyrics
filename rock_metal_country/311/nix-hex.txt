Story time
Sways away the haze
They spent contemplating, formulating, theory siring above me swimming
Pay tribute to the few we look up to
Come again
You my soul fool
Who will know us but our brothers
Those who down with us are thinking
New school, tip top, pound the feeble
Walking and talking
Low down and evil
Follow me now
Yo Vato
The nix hex is on

Would everybody just look at the hook
I took it straight from my brain
Reminds me of the time I was insane
And so I wrote it when I was loaded
And voted the least likely to turn out like a square

I'm singing it for your mind and know
I'm singing it for your ears
Jump up and down and leave the ground and know that's why you're here
And they say down diggy down down, down diggy diggy down,stronger, longer
Line up your ways of know what I'm thinking say it again

And now I'm with my home team back with a good seat
I gladwick like chadwick to tell you what I mean
Were laying back on it just like good sex
Smooth yet psychedelic its called the nix hex-um

The monologue of a singalong
Las banderas de san juan piden pa 
"I'm feelin' fine, lord it's time" Go tell it on a mountain,
then again bring a friend
You'll maybe get dizzy with a scence of vertigo

Uplifted soul from the view that I'm on nothin' but love
But love
But love in my blood sonic in the vortex
This is the hip thing
Called the nix hex
Dig it
