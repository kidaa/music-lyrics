Its good to be alive in the peaceful revolution
An honor to observe the beautiful solution
I tip my hat to we the people in order to form a more perfect world
This shall come to pass

The beginning of the end
Of the ignorance that once could sin
The tyrant to power
His day is done
In the worldwide revolution
Yeah, the peaceful revolution

All around this small world
Now the people demand to listen
These truths self-evident
Philosophical evolution
As the old die out
The young see a better way
Human rights guaranteed to all
Without regard to race, I say

The beginning of the end
Now the people vote, we will not sin
The tyrant to power
His day is done
In the worldwide revolution
In the peaceful revolution

I see the last frontier and the peaceful revolution
World peace is merely a product of social evolution
The conquest lies in accepting different peoples
And thinking right here at home
In the suns kingdom

The beginning of the end
And of the tolerance that once could sin
The tyrant to power
His day is done
In the worldwide revolution
In the peaceful revolution

Its the peaceful revolution
Its the peaceful revolution
