You got a wishing well within
that's ready to begin
see how we roll
see how we roll
i'm tryin' to compromise
because with me there are no lies
see how we run
it's already begun
now that i'm back to a pushing pen
that weighs two hundred tons
i'd like to drop it on you
and watch it all fall through

Nobody knows just what
you're battling inside
you can hide
nobody knows just why
most everyone will lie
if they need to

The ones who aggravate you most
and happen to be ever close
seem to be the ones lurching
for the same things that you are searching
the ones who make you feel ill
and you think that nature should have killed
those you curse when you're alone
seem to be so close to home

Not an even field
to be on
feels like standing still
for eons and eons
stare it dead in the eye
what now
all we can do is try
to shut it down
shut it down

Not an even field
to be on
feels like standing still
for eons and eons
stare it dead in the eye
what now
all we can do is try
to shut it down
