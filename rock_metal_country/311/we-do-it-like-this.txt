Now look out
whatcha say
now look out
it's time to kick the basics
flowing and knowing it's in your faces
sounds good when we're trading up places
when we fuck it daily I see something that sails me
from here to infinity it nails me
to do the groove til the suckas improve
on these so called grooves
that just don't move
a million ways to fuck it up and one to get it right
to the best of modern man keep movin through the night

Makin funky rhymes in a permanent bliss

we work it on out saw something you missed

People busy mulling over the worst case scenario
I just wind it up and let it go
I don't dis people, I dis ideas
and when I say dis I mean disagree
then we go to the studio and re-up
some new tunes and we make some new dubs
well that's where we grow the gems the pearls
take a trip to find there's another world

A battle against time to make use of your minds
to hook up your drum beats with my fresh rhyme
to make the best use of our strings and things
all cylinders go motherfucker we ring
a battle against time to make use of your minds
to hook up your drum beats with my fresh rhyme
to make the best use of our strings and things
all cylinders go motherfucker we ring

We put that shit on the map
for everyone to see it son, there it is
now we come what you see we be it no comparative
we can make up a word when just nothin else will fit
then we break it on down that's it
