I don't jones for nothing 
cause that's a waste 
waste of space in my frontal lobe and 
I just sit, deal with it, don't have a fit 
do you know what I'm sayin'? 

I just get as down as I can 
don't look to relief from a troubled young man 
just take a piece 
sometimes it sucks 

Oh and then and then I say 
I looked the other way 
I changed my point of view 
and here's what I do, one time, check it out 

This too shall pass 
this too shall pass 
this too shall pass 
all the good times, all the bad times 
face it bro, they all will pass 

Your problems will seem inconsequential and trivial 
when you realize one thing 
we're just a speck of dirt 
on this golf ball called earth 
so get stupid and sing 

fuck it up! 

Oh and then and then I say 
I looked the other way 
I changed my point of view 
and here's what I do 

This song is past 
yeah
