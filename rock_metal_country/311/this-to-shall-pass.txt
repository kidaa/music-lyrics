I dont jones for nothing
Cause thats a waste
Waste of space in my frontal lobe and
I just sit, deal with it, dont have a fit
Do you know what Im sayin

I just get as down as I can
Dont look to relief from a troubled young man
Just take a piece
Sometimes it sucks

Oh I'm not too sure if I can do this on my own guys 
Like I'm thinking maybe we should form a support group 
Or perhaps a church sponsored youth group 
Oh and then then I say I looked the other way
I changed my point of view
And heres what I do

This too shall pass
This too shall pass
This too shall pass
This..
All the good times, all the bad times
Face it bro, they all will pass

Your problems will seem inconsequential and trivial
When you realize one thing
Were just a speck of dirt on this golf ball
Called 
Its stupid insane

And didnt then I see
I looked the other way
I changed my point of view
And heres what I do
