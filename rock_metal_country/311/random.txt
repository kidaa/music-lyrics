Sound boy proceed to blast into the galaxy 
Go back rocket man into the skyyou'll see 
Hear it all the time, come back rewind 
Aliens are watching up in thesky 
Sound boy proceed to blast into the galaxy 
Sound boy when you come round
Sound boy won't you stay 
No one gonna harm you 
They all want you to play I watchthe birds of prey 
that hunt the canyon below my house 
Looking for a meal like alizard or a mouse I wonder 
if they appreciate the setting like me 
To controlyour own direction choose to be free 
And I reserve the right to be as trite as Iwant 
And you can lick but don't bite I toss you here to Vermont I kick it lickety split 
and hand it to the man in the tan van 
And as for you and your crewI don't hate you peace is my priority 'cuz 
Marley said for sure-ity 
Just what doyou think I'm doin' I'm not just here for screwin yo 
And if it's sore take careof it perhaps from too much stucking 
But anytime your aware of it then keep onfucking 
You know we cool 
Hey hey isn't that random 
When we come boutpeople get ready 
Hey hey isn't that random 
Gonna freak do it national
Sound boy gonna rock you 
People rock steady 
Hey hey isn't that random 
Tobe the one who has it all is not that hard 
And I'll be that type of dude in afunky car I dream of a suit that will fit my rhyme 
When I recognize my girl froma former life 
I love it when the only sound that I hear Is your infectiouslaughter 
I will hear you again in 800 years If I'm still lucky 
Go north on
Outpost then take a left on Mullholland 
To me that's where I like it and Macapa
Drive is callin' I get up to the sun and then I stretch out 
Beginning to looklike summer
And i'm down with no doubt swing 
You know we cool 
Hey hey isn'tthat random 
When we come bout people get ready 
Hey hey isn't that random
Gonna freak do it national 
Sound boy gonna rock you 
People rock steady
Hey hey isn't that random 
I break a silly peace for offering rap weasel 
ThenI'm boffering I'd give you an exclusive on my playlist 
The thought and styles Ikick are from a random hat pick
That's why most radio will never play this 
Tell'em again 
Me a rude boy from Omaha, Nebraska 
Sick as a porno flick yet gold asprecious laughter 
Many don't agree but we can't care about that 
'Cuz we're nevergonna wear the old hat.
