You've got to trust your instinct 
And let go of regret 
You've got to bet onyourself now star 
'Cause that's your best bet 
Watch me now with a wicked andwild and I said 
We come with the funky style that gets us known for the show 
Andwe'll mix the hip hop reggae if we say it is so 
And fuck the naysayers causethey don't mean a thing 
Cause this is what style we bring 
Now it's morning butlast night's on my mind 
There's something I need to get off my chest 
And nomatter what may come to shine 
The dream will always be mine 
All mixed up, youdon't know what to do 
Next thing you turn around and find the person is you
Thought a freak might be the thing 
But the first could be the last, so just getoff of your ass 
All mixed up, you don't know what to do 
Next thing you turnaround and find the person is you 
Thought a freak might be the thing 
But youknow this will pass, so just get off of your ass 
You've got to trust yourinstinct 
And let go of regret 
You've got to bet on yourself now star 
`Causethat's your best bet 
Watch me now with a wicked and wild and I said 
Sick sickbit got to have it 
Like bustin' in on a session but you got to call it quits
Sick sick bit just can't quit 
Fact that you don't even know makes it fully legit
Now it's morning but last night's on my mind 
There's something I need to get offmy chest 
And no matter may come to shine 
The dream will always be mine 
You keepme coming, 
That is a gal that'll kill dem stunning 
You keep me coming, 
That is agal that'll kill dem stunning 
You keep me coming, 
That is a gal that'll kill demstunning 
You keep me coming, 
That is a gal that'll kill dem stunning 
You make menervous, throat dry 
My brain is empty, don't know why 
But I saw you doingsomething 
Which is really truly nothing 
But you could bust me out all day 
Manymoons since first I saw you 
Many moons since first we did the do 
Many moonssince first I saw you 
Many moons since first we did the do 
And why did I trywhen I knew it was no and 
Why did I try when I say it was so 
But save it forlate we should just let it skate 
'Cause the waiting feel is fine
