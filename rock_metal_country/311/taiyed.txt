Returning from the water cold alive and shining
Rock a mic in the afterlife while your moon is rising
Heatin' up forcing steam whirling to be seen
The dark held stars are the frost of my breathing
Swimming through the darkness I'm a ghostly shark
Developing like a photograph slowly in the dark
The hearafter the action the main attraction
One love in all of this that I'm going after

Now there's fire inside but black space surrounds you
You think "Where oh where am I"
but even your light continues
See through us see a soul we have not yet
Learned to harness see the next world inside it
We are the people of skin who left water
Inside the dark womb inside of our mother
Prone to the beat and vibe of our tribe
We catch the drift and ride moving tides
Out from a love that will keep on burning
Now see yourself to the next world returning
This life an old place we face to live again
What is it to understand the heareafter
