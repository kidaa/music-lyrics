Everything seems turning
And the jam starts to break
 circles
And red and not pink

I know its not my place
But something to face
My economy seems to be
 In worse than actually 

Thriving to the scene
Thriving to the scene
Thriving to the scene

Then Im acting pissed
I couldnt share my fist 
The very word is coming 
But its a boy that I have missed 
Hit it

Thriving to the scene
Thriving to the scene
Thriving to the scene
