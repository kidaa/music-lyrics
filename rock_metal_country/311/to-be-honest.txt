To be honest
For the boy is hard
He doesnt mean to break all those girls hearts

Perks they flow
Loaded gun
Only says them just to have his fun
And it sounds like this

On my mind, all the time
Youre my one and only

Kick the booty
The boy is not hard
He throws down like a crazy retard

A gentle lie
And a clever line
A deceptive romance makes for him to 
And it sounds like

On my mind, all the time
Youre my one and only

And it sounds like this

On my mind, all the time
you know youre my one and only
