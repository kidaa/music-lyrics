Along the way to close my eyes
I lost where I was going
the more it will spin
the more that I try
to stop my mind flowing away, away
to all that I despise
along the way to close my eyes

You can't be let down if you don't expect the world
expect to lay awake and by your sleeping girl
if somebody cares then there is no way you can tell
cursed consciousness is your private hell

Along the way to close my eyes
I lost where I was going
the more it will spin
the more that I try
to stop my mind flowing away, away
to all that I despise
along the way to close my eyes

Tick, tick, tick the clock bludgeons your mind
endlessly replaying times that were unkind
go away sun I'm not prepared for you today
it seems you are, it seems you are, huh!

Along the way to close my eyes
I lost where I was going
the more it will spin
the more that I try
to stop my mind flowing away, away
to all that I despise
along the way to close my eyes
