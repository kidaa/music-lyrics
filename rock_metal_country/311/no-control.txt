Do you want me to cry
Cry for you
How can you say that you're blue
A rich rock star you are
Yet you still complain, that's insane
Imagine if you had a child of two
You're a single mom, son named Tom
You work a long hard day just to bill pay
With no time to play then what would you say

Still in this world what it means to me
Losin' my grip as I trip on anomalies
My thired eye is the prize of unifyin' Horus
The Pleadies will smash out of Taurus
Energy pure decompose in the porous
Soil of life moving on it's courses
Crystals 'neath the surface radiate the cycle
Combing minerales they will flex and let go
Toxically were built to never last
Cuz the waste we make all day
Steady growin' fast
I get up intake my blue-green algae
Let it penetrate
Strengthen my grasp
Holistic healers dealin' our galactic growth
Reversin' fx of shit wrecked Chernobyl

Wanna take it further [2x]
Let's take that funk further 

We've all got pain that's real
And we should say how we feel
And I've felt so alone
But I know I've always got a home
The question I'm up serving
Is am I really deserving

Gamma waves bacterial plagues
Cow mutilations all the time
Not to mention visitations
More than 2000 years
Of fuckin' with our fears
The only thing true
We gotta love each other
Try to leep a positive vibe
They make it tough for ya
You're cut off and lonely
While you hustle for dough
We can overcome the wrongs
While we're reachin' the point
Stick together all forever
Now continue to flow

Wanna take it further [2x]
Let's take that funk further
