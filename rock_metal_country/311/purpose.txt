I believe in your purpose baby 
Coming up to the surface and maybe 
I'll neversee you again then again who knows 
Make me quiver hands will shiver 
Still gotall the things that I woulda give her 
Yeah, yeah but it's slow going 
Something's showing yeah, yeah 
Love is a stream that will find it's own course
Making dueis a thing a thing I will do no more 
Whenever you come back I'll be waiting
Trifling the slack no head gating 
This is all pure fiction you know that's right
Just pure fiction 
That's all right I believe in your purpose baby 
Coming up tothe surface and maybe 
I'll never see you again then again who knows 
Make mequiver hands will shiver 
Still got all the things that I woulda give her, yeah
But it's slow going something's showing 
Yeah, yeah
