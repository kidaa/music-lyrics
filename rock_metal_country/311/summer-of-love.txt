I thought about my scene today
And I've finally got the words to say
The truth is cutting like a knife
Gonna use it to cut away my strife
The grass is green and the sky is blue
My head is clear and my thoughts are true, yeah
Thats what Im sayin

Callin' out young and old
We got a thing that can't be sold
The time it takes to rise above
In the summer of love

It's the summer of love I say

I wake up each day to the sun
And it's hard to chose what to do for fun and man thats a drag
A blissful world surrounds me
And my brothers and sisters love is always free
Don't you know that I've waited my whole life
Just to show what's inside and let my love flow
That's what I'm sayin'

Callin' out young and old
We got a thing that can't be sold
The time it takes to rise above
In the summer of love

It's the summer of love I say

I declare by the power vested in me
This is the summer of love and unity
Oh I say by the power vested in me
This is the summer of love and unity
I declare by the power vested in me
This is the summer of love and unity
Oh I declare by the power vested in me
This is the summer of love and unity
Oh I declare by the power vested in me
It is the summer of love

It's the summer of love I say
