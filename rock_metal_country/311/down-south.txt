Let me take you down south 
hear it from the dover's mouth 
the rhythm will make you want to move your body 
I had it once and never ever forgot it 
feel the rhythm of rhapsody 
your body moves in raw ecstasy 
explosive eruption beyond compare and 

Take my advice don't think twice 
let me take you way down south 

Step back cuz the funk is here and 
the base is kickin' straight to your ear man 
because it's like that so don't talk back 
and if you do then you're gonna get the back slap 
down south that's an enigma 
but to you it's a stupid dumb stigma 
that's right it's outta sight 

Let me tell you 'bout my baby 
she loves me and I don't mean maybe 
she knows what I think and I don't have to say it 
I love her so I don't have to play it 
we sit and drink in the sun 
I raise my glass and say she's the one 
cool breeze light squeeze life 

Take my advice don't think twice 
let me take you way down south 

Yo, step back I'm about to get hectic 
chalk it up as another dialectic 
hard like a jam 
smooth like a ballad 
call it what you want but I call it sound salad 
a salad grown in the garden of Eden 
seekin' out pleasures like my boys in Sweden 
that's right the grooves tight like 

Sit back just relax, let your mind unwind 
pull your good thing close, let tranquility surround 
psychedelic freak out taco funk frolic 
grind fiend roots 'core soul music what have you 
psychedelic freak out taco funk frolic 
grind fiend roots 'core soul music 

Yo, step back and think about the topic of this song 
strong innuendo end over end goes your brain 
I won't say it's plain figure it out here's a clue 
it's about winding, grinding, finding that spot 
that get's her hot the joy of giving pleasure 
is beyond measure, you know
