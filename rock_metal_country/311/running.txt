Here in the world feel it flowing
River of life on a human journey
Don't be afraid of becoming the sea
Don't worry yourself [3x]
Many stories will
Be left untold
But understand everything must go

Slow slow lover
Rub you down
We don't want no one
Hurting don't make a sound
Oh livin' is a journey
Waking believing running
For shelter now
Slow slow lover
Rub you down
We don't want no one
Hurting don't make a sound
Oh livin' is a journey
Waking believing running

What's that you do
You're running around
There's people that need you
And you're letting down
And when it's time to care
You always leave town
Don't hurry yourself [3x]
There's some wildness
There and mercy
It's the emptiness we
Love touching

Slow slow lover
Rub you down
We don't want no one
Hurting don't make a sound
Oh livin' is a journey
Waking believing running
For shelter now
Slow slow lover
Rub you down
We don't want no one
Hurting don't make a sound
Oh livin' is a journey
Waking believing running

Give thanks and praise
For good things you found
Humble people
Not ashamed nor proud
And always try to keep
Your feet on the ground
And love yourself

Slow slow lover
Rub you down
We don't want no one
Hurting don't make a sound
Oh livin' is a journey
Waking believing running
For shelter now
Slow slow lover
Rub you down
We don't want no one
Hurting don't make a sound
Oh livin' is a journey
Waking believing running
