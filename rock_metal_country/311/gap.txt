Purified sounds brush 'em on like paint
Teenage dream to work with Ron Saint
Home he ain't, we layin' tracks in cali
The dude is excitable as a pep rally
Since the days of The Eds
Grew up westside keeping it real
Got nothing to hide
Now we are a number there is none greater
Take me out sound king yo peace see ya later

Let's step out tonight, all night
The groove is soothin'
Let's step out tonight, alright
It's a fellow feelin'
With my friends, once again

Grape Vess soda pop licorice stick
Aunt Mary's summertime backyard picnic
"Did you dring my beer Doug"
Yeah I did it
Don't tell me to bring you a beer if you think
I won't sip it
Swingin' on swingin' on jungle gym sets
Daddy talkin' bout the horses he bet
When I got home my friends phoned
Hey holmes

Let's step out tonight, all night
The groove is doothin'
Let's step out tonight, alright
It's a fellow feelin'
With my friends, once again

Eat smoked fish that is my favorite dish
Eat smoked fish that is my favorite dish
Eat smoked fish that is my favorite dish
Eat smoked fish that is my favorite dish

Let's step out tonight, all night
The groove is soothin'
Let's step out tonight, alright
It's a feelin'
With my friends, once again
