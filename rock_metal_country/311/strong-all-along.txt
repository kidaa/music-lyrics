Feel the bass knives past your flesh enter your bone
solitude in your dance floor rhythm zone
let your body go, just don't follow the letter
do what you feel, the more absurd the better
don't be afraid, whatever you got, show
flaunt your personality let 'em know you stylo
you could make a mean hand out of what you been dealt
311 on wax, wax on felt

Feeling real great cause the weather is mild
so you re-evaluate your personal style
what makes you laugh, stand apart
makes you feel good what's in your heart
feeling real great cause the weather is mild
so you check us out on tour, cause your likin' the style
drums, the bass, the master plan
nice guitars, the mics in our hands

Strong all along, strong all along
come to find out the arm of the truth is long
i'll break it down for you like this for the hard of listening
you think you're taking the cake, but what's left icing, jump!

To every foundation and every crew
we've got the medium, here's what we're gonna do
sending out props straight from us to you
to every foundation and every crew

you wanna touch us, we wanna touch you too
givin' respect, to those who keepin' it true

If you are real or a replica
if your steez be like Akira
the wild ass Sioux or the Chippewa
your tribes Pawnee or the Omaha

Strong all along, strong all along
