Here I sit in idle envy
T.V. show still holds me in
Thin steel creases my 
Begging till the end

And then it hits me
And then I see, then I see
Today my love, we shall let the world slide
For we, will never be
Younger again

Well, I'm tired of the ladies and the stupid excuses
Sitting on my ass makes me feel useless
Earth accelerate, hurry up and turn that's right
I'm starting to burn

Well I get kinda mad like a  crawdad
It's time to throw down, too bad so sad
Don't step to me when things don't go as you planned
No, I don't give a damn

And then it hits me
And then I see, then I see
Today my love, we shall let the world slide
For we, will never be
Younger again, younger again
Younger again, younger again

It's easier to hurt than heal
Hipocrites they make me ill
Young men yearn to turn the tables
That too is a sin

And then it hits me
And then I see, then I see
Today my love, we shall let the world slide
For we, will never be
Younger again

We all look to the end of a certain social stress
I'm down for that day, but don't forget the progress
Of wakening things up the passion understanding
Here's to the youth who aren't afraid to put a hand in

And then it hits me
And then I see, then I see
Today my love, we shall let the world slide
For we, will never be
Younger again, younger again
Younger again, younger again
