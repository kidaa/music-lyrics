Mister you don't know me
But I've heard about you
And how you spend your nights in here
Just what you put her through
So I came here to find out
If they sell the drink so strong
It would make a man fool enough
To go and do her wrong
Tell me what was you thinkin'
What was you drinkin'
I don't want none of that stuff
It must have made you lose your mind
Or you never would've lost her love
It would really help me
Mister if you tell me
I'll never bother you again
What was you thinkin'
What was you drinkin'
I guess I'd better go now
It's gettin' kind of late
And I don't have to tell you
She don't like to wait
I heard it's better to have loved and lost
And I must say I agree
Since you're the one who lost her love
And drove her straight to me
But tell me what was you thinkin'
What was you drinkin'
I don't want none of that stuff
It must have made you lose your mind
Or you never would've lost her love
It would really help me
Mister if you tell me
I'll never bother you again
What was you thinkin'
What was you drinkin'
Tell me what was you thinkin'
What was you drinkin'
I don't want none of that stuff
It must have made you lose your mind
Or you never would've lost her love
It would really help me
Mister if you tell me
I'll never bother you again
What was you thinkin'
What was you drinkin'
