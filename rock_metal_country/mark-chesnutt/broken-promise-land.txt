Theres a Bible on the dresser and a sign hung on the door
And a woman in my arms who shouldnt be
Im to the point of no returning but Ive been here before
This cheating life is nothing new to me
Theres someone to be considered so I call her on the phone
And say the job is taking longer than I planned I dont have the heart to tell her
That a strangers turned me on and Im headed for
The boken promise land
Chorus:
Tonight, Im crossing over and Ill reach the cheating side
And Ill hate myself for coming here again
Where the streets are paved with misery and lives are built on lies
A place they call the broken promise land
I found a note left on the dresser and a key left in the door
And on the floor I found her goldeb wedding band
Guess she finally had to tell me Shes not waiting anymore
Shes headed for the broken promise land
Chorus II:
Tonight shes crossing over and shell reach the cheating side
And Ill hate myself for giving her the chance
Cause the streets are paved with misery and lives are built on lies
a place they call the broken promise land
