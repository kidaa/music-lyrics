I never claimed to know everything
I ain't got no Ph.D.
But boys listen up when it comes to love
You can learn a thing or two from me
I'm no expert on makin' love work
I really can't tell you a lot
Well I don't know how to keep a woman around
But I sure know how to run one off
So listen to my words of no wisdom
There's no secret to my lack of success
Once she draws the line just cross it one time
That's the way you make an ex
I never could spell misery to well
But I know it ends with a Y
Why did I do what I did when I knew
She'd get her half and half of what's mine
Takes more than luck to really mess up
It don't just hapen this way
It took sacrifice and all my exwives
To get me where I am today
So listen to my words of no wisdom
There's no secret to my lack of success
Once she draws the line just cross it one time
That's the way you make an ex
Once she draws the line just cross it one time
That's the way you make an ex
That's the way you make an ex
That's the way you make an ex
