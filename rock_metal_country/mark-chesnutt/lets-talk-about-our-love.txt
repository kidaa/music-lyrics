Robert Arthur, Mark Chesnutt, Roger Springer
Well I dont wanna hear no more about how he broke your heart
Relivin your old memories is tearin me apart
Id just soon forget about the past cause thats the one thing we cant change
Lets stop this useless conversation 
Thats just lovin time were waistin
Losin any more would be a shame
Chorus
Lets talk about you and me, lets talk about forever
How its gonna be and how therell never 
Come a day when we give up on us
Lets talk about the way we feel whenever were together
And how we never get enough lets talk about the good stuff
Lets talk about our love
Now weve been over everything hes ever done to you
Its time you figured out that weve got better things to do
I dont mean to sound like I dont care - girl you know your the one I love
You can tell me anything you want to 
And everything youve ever been through
But when it comes to him Ive heard enough
Repeat Chorus
