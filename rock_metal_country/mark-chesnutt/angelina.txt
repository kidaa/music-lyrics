Always knew it, I'd recognize your face
And I rehearsed it, just what I would say
But then I say you and all that I could do
Was just smile
In your brown eyes the past disappeared
And my future was suddenly so clear
I was made for, I was meant for
Lovin' you
Oh Angelina, I loved ya long before I'd ever seen ya
So many nights I could only dream ya
But now you're here my Angelina
I watch the moonlight softly brush your hair
Are you a vision; are you really there
But then you touch me and the fantasy is so real
Oh Angelina, I loved ya long before I'd ever seen ya
So many nights I could only dream ya
But now you're here my Angelina
Oh Angelina, each day there's somethin'' 
new I love about you
And I wonder how I ever lived without you
Oh how I need you, my Angelina
