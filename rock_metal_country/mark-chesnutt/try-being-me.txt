You say you don't know where to start
Telling me is breakin' your heart
It's not that you don't care for me
It's just that you're not in love anymore
You stare at the floor
You say it's no one's fault that feelings change
And you'd rather not get into blame
You don' know if it's a choice or fate
But you can't fight this need to be set free
Tomorrow you'll leave
You tell me this is hard for you
You should try being me
Try watching dreams
Crash to the ground without warning
Try not to beg
When the one you love says they're going
Hells' near and you know it 
You tell me this is hard for you
You should try being me
You say you don't deny what we had
But we can't tie the future to the past
I'll always be a part of you
And hurting me's the last thing on your mind
But you can't live a like
You tell me this is hard for you
You should try being me
Try watching dreams
Crash to the ground without warning
Try not to beg
When the one you love says they're going
Hells' near and you know it 
You tell me this is hard for you
You should try being me
