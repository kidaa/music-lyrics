Marv Green, Rick Orozco
Sittin at a table conversation 
Me and may buddies, I follow what theyre sayin
100% of the daily events
But the minute she walks in my direction
Well there goes my span of attention
One look in her eyes and Im gone for a ride
Chorus
Im gone, Im history, she gets the best of me
My mind drifts away and instantly Im in another world - wishin she was my girl
And nothin else matters at all, Im gone like yesterday, to another time and place
One sweet smile and I got swept away, she gives me just enough to dream on
And Im gone
Yeah I been comin in here for quite some time
Ive got it all figured out in my mind, what I wanna say, and todays the day
Oh here she comes, heart be steady, play it cool, I got the words ready
She says hello and I away I go 
Repeat Chorus
