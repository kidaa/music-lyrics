There's a photo in my baby book
Of the first step that I ever took
I ended up on my butt with a puzzled look
Ever since I've been kinda confused
When life tripped me up I was easily bruised
But time has a way of healing wounds
Now I'm a guy who does what he feels
But I never seem to spot that banana peel
With eyes shut tight and nerves of steel
I'm takin' the plunge baby head over heels
Fallin' never felt so good
It don't scare me like I thought it would
Coming down, droppin' fast
I got a feelin' that it's gonna last
Here I come baby ooh, ooh, ooh
Fallin' in love with you
Who can say what may lie in store
Smooth sailin' on a sea of love or
Runnin' aground on a rocky shore
Now that I've found you I'm not lettin' go
";Cause I've been searchin' high and love
Only one thing that I know
The higher you take me the deeper I go
Fallin' never felt so good
It don't scare me like I thought it would
Coming down, droppin' fast
I got a feelin' that it's gonna last
Here I come baby ooh, ooh, ooh
Fallin' in love with you
