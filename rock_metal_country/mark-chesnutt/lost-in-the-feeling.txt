Lewis Anderson 
We step out on the dance floor the band starts to play
Holding you close I get carried away
Finding that  falling is easy to do
Lost in the feeling with you
Time's standing still as I Whirl you around
We're dancing without even touching the ground
Finding that falling is easy to do
Lost in the feeling with you
No words are spoken
None need to be said
You and the music
Have gone to my head
But I'll just go on when the music is through
Lost in the feeling with you
Lost in the feeling with you
Lost in the feeling with you
