Ron Peterson, Harlan Howard
I said Im through with honky tonks 
They only bring me down
I dressed my best and headed for 
The brightest spot in town
Ive watched the rich folks come and go and one things very clear
Theres just as many lonely people here
Chorus
Im just hangin round a better class of losers 
It dont matter if you drink bear or champagne
Ive only found a better class of losers
Uptown, downtown misrys all the same
Its been all downhill for me
since baby walked away
Im down here at the bottom 
And I guess thats where Ill stay
Im looking for the answers
But all that Ive seen here
Is the same old lonely phony atmosphere 
Repeat Chorus
For the blues are still the blues
Still just as hard to lose
Uptown, downtown...miserys all the same
