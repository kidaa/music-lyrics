Youve been gone almost a month
Girl I nearly died
For twenty seven days and nights
Sat right here and cried
If it wasnt for your memory
Id been here all alone
Goodbye heartache, darlin, welcome home
Chorus
Treat me any way you want to
Even cuss and swear
Call me anything you need to
I promise I wont care 
Just let it all out, youre right I was wrong
Goodbye heartache, darlin, welcome home
Theres really just no good excuse 
For the things I said 
The way that I stood up to you
I must have lost my head
And Im not ashamed to say 
Thank God those days are gone
Goodbye heartache, darlin, welcome home
