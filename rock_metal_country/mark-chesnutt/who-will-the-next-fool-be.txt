After you get rid of me - who will the next fool be
I know I know I know I know
Theres things hed like to know
About the girl I love so
Cause after all is said and done 
You wont be satisfied with anyone
So after you get rid of me 
Who will the next fool be
Chorus
Will he believe all those lies
End up like me with tears in his eyes
I know I know I know I know
And Id like to be the one to tell him so
Cause after all is said and done
You wont be satisfied with anyone
So after you get rid of me
who will the next fool be
