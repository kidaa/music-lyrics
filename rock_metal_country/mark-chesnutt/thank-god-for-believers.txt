Last night I came home again
Three sheets to the wind 
And broke the promise I swore Id never break
And it came As no surprise
To see the hurt in her eyes
Or the Bible on the table where she prayed
This time I thought for sure she was good as gone
But she just wiped the tears away and put some coffee on
Chorus
I dont know why she even hangs around
After all the hell Ive put her through
And the times Ive let her down
She has more faith in me than I have ever found 
Heaven knows how much I need her
Thank God for believers
She says ";Boy I still love you";
Oh shes Stronger than the ninety proof
I sent coursing through my veins 
She says ";dont give up the fight
Before long youll get it right";
I pray to God someday Ill feel the same
Sunday morning beside her in the pew
Through blood shot eyes I try to see her point of view
I dont know why she even hangs around
After all the hell Ive put her through
And the times Ive let her down
She has more faith in me than I have ever found 
Heaven knows how much I need her
Thank God for believers
