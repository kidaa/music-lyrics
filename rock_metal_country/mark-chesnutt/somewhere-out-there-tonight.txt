Bonnie Rogers
Well I'm slippin' on my old party clothes
Wondering if they're still in style
Ain't had 'em on
Since you've been gone
And that's been along long while
And I wonder if these old dancing shoes
Will they still feel right?
Guess I'll never know 
Unless I go somewhere out there tonight
Been livin' alone
Since you've been gone
Hoping you might return
And I've yet to let
A stranger in my door
But I'm feeling more willing
Than ever before
Oh I wonder if I'll feel out of place
Should new arms hold me tight
Guess I'll never know
Unless I go somewhere out there tonight
