We gathered with the lawyer for the reading of the will
Mama sat there quietly between all of us kids
Then he opened up the papers 
And my fathers words were read
You could have heard a pin drop
When we heard the things he said
To all my loving family I leave this old house
Just split up all the money and pass it all around
But now that thats all settled and its all said and done
Heres a few things that Ill leave with each and everyone
To the boys I leave the family name, the honesty and pride
To both my precious girls, I leave a million lullabies
Sing them to your children and let them know you care
And take what strength I gave to you and be patient, kind and fair
To all I leave undying love, let no one shed a tear
Cause I was the luckiest man on earth in the time that I was here
And finally to mother whos love was ever true
The greatest a man can give, I leave my heart to you
We all just kind of sat there, not knowing what to say
Then mama looked at all of us and said, ";Id like to pray";
So right there in that office in words so soft and still
We all swore that wed honor the things in Daddys will
