Steve Leslie, Roger Springer
Last night I dreamed I went to sleep for good 
And in the crowed that gathered round. There you stood
When it finally came your turn to say goodbye
Right then and there I watched you break down and cry
Chorus
And thats when I knew I was dreamin
The vision was to good to be true 
Itd take much more than me dying
For me to ever see that side of you
At first I thought you were an angel
Waiting there to carry me away 
Then the pain left my heart when I felt your touch 
And in your arms I found everlasting love
Repeat Chorus
