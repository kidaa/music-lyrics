Don't get me wrong, I'm doing all right 
Can't you see I'm OK 
I'm not at home all alone every night 
I'm out here dancing old memories away  
Chorus 
But it wouldn't hurt to have wings 
To lift me above all the pain of the past 
And your mind-wrecking love 
They say time can fly like a magical thing 
But it sure wouldn't hurt to have wings  
I don't see things like love any more 
The rose-colored glasses are gone 
I won't be fooled like I was before 
I'm learning now how to fly on my own  
Repeat chorus  
I'm gonna fly like an eagle 
And rise above it all  
Repeat chorus  
No, it sure wouldn't hurt to have wings.
