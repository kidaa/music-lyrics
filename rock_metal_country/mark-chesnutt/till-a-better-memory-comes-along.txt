See the lines in my face, theres one for everyday
Ive lived without you and held you only in my mind
See these hands, how they shake, how long it will take
Before I leave you in the past where you belong
One day I might forget, but right now Im not that strong
So Ill hold on til a better memory comes along
If someone could really touch me
The way you used to do 
If she could find one single feelin
That didnt start with me and you 
Maybe then I might forget, but right now Im not that strong
So Ill hold on til a better memory comes along
Maybe then I might forget, but right now Im not that strong
So Ill hold on til a better memory comes along
Im holding on,til a better memory comes along
