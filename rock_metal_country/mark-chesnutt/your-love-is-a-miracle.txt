Bill Kenner, Mark Wright
Out on the highway a lot of pretty girls go by
But none have been right
Up until today I would never settle down
But you keep comming around
Chorus: 
And your love is a miracle
Its spiritual
Got here just in time
Your love is a miracle
Its visible
Even to a heart thats blind like mine
Out in the wild life, a lot of people telling lies
Lookin right in your eyes
And up until tonight, I was always on the prowl
But now Im settlin down
Repeat Chorus
Bridge:
Anyone can see what youre doing to me
And everyone can see that youre everything I see
Chorus:
Cause your love is a miracle
Its spiritual 
Stands the test of time
Your love is a miracle
Its visible
Even to a heart thats blind like mine
