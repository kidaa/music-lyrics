The day you said goodbye
Without a tear in your eye
I just can not believe
You could take from my life
Half of everything and all of my heart
Loneliness and your name
They are one and the same
And though I've tried and I've tried
I know that you will not remain
Half of everything and all of my heart
I know that I'm just another
Heartbroken lover
With a great big chip upon this lonely shoulder
But if I ever find out that
There's a life out there for me, for me
I know that time will take
Care of a lot of things
That we're scared of
And I know it won't be long until
I get my share of
Half of everything and all of my heart
I know that I'm just another
Heartbroken lover 
With a great big chip upon this lonely shoulder
But if I ever find out that
There's a life out there for me, for me
I know that time will take
Care of a lot of things
That we're scared of
And I know it won't be long until
I get my share of
Half of everything and all of my heart
Half of everything and all of my heart
