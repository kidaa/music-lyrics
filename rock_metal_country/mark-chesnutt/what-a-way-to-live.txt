Willie Nelson/Hank Craig
Each night I make the rounds
To every spot in town
A lonely man with lonely time to kill
All I can say is what a way to live
The paths my memories take
Just make my poor heart ache
I think of her I guess I always will
All I can say is what a way to live
I'd rather lay me down tonight
And never wake again
Than to face another day the shape my life is in
The jukebox playing loud
A face among the crowd
So much like hers it makes my heart stand still
All I can say is what a way to live
I'd rather lay me down tonight
And never wake again
Than to face another day the shape my life is in
The jukebox playing loud
A face among the crowd
So much like hers it makes my heart stand still
All I can say is what a way to live
All I can say is what a way to live
