Waylon Jennings
Oh rainy day woman
I never seem to see your for the good times or the sunshine
You have been a friend of mine, rainy day woman
That woman of mine, she ain't happy
'Til she finds something wrong and someone to blame
If it ain't one thing it's another one on the way
Woke up this mornin' to the sunshine
It sure as hell looks just like rain
But I know where to go on a cloudy day
Oh rainy day woman
I never seem to see your for the good times or the sunshine
You have been a friend of mine, rainy day woman
Always the same never complain
Though times gotta be tough
It's not right for you what can I do
I can never think of givin' you up
Oh rainy day woman
I never seem to see your for the good times or the sunshine
You have been a friend of mine, rainy day woman
Oh rainy day woman
I never seem to see your for the good times or the sunshine
You have been a friend of mine, rainy day woman
