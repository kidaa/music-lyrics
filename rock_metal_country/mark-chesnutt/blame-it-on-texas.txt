Been havin a ball since I was a boy in Beaumont
Love that town but I just couldnt stay
Two stepped all the way to Amarillo
Shuffled my way into Santa Fe
Just had to see the sun set out in Frisco 
The Golden Gate is great
But it aint home
Give me a rodeo
Chorus
Blame it on Texas
Dont blame it on me
I am who I am 
And thats what Im gonna be
You can say what you wanna say
About my insanity
Blame it on Texas
Dont blame it on me
Met a girl out in eastern Oklahoma
Her daddy was a Tulsa millionaire
With miles and miles of oil wells hed leave her
All a man could want was waitn there
But one night while she lay sleepin I slipped away
Like no man in his 
Right mind would do
call me a fool
Repeat Chorus
