Summer after graduation
Two kids stuck in Alabama
We'd be lovers any way we could
A ten buck wedding ceremony
A guy outside the courthouse told me
The weather down in South Beach 
sure was good
So we hit the road like any dreamers would
She was mine for a time in Miami
Thought I had her in the palm of my hand
Like the sunrise the truth finally hit me
That her heart was halfway back to Birmingham
This ain't what she really wanted
So baby we went on back to Mama
Found a note when I got home last night 
Left a fifty for the landlord
Nothin' here to stay around for
Ain't but one way left to make it right
So I'm headed for that Alabama line
She was mine for a time in Miami
But things don't always fw9ork out like you plan
Now I'm nearly out of gas and it's raining
But I'm almost halfway back to Birmingham
Like the sunrise the truth finally hit me
That her heart was halfway back to Birmingham^
