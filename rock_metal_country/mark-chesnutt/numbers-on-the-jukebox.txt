Mark Chesnutt, Roger Springer, Slugger Morrissette
I cant recall how many times she said shed never leave
Or the times she swore the only one for her was me
But the angel I was counting on has all but disappeared
And the only trace of her thats left I find each night in there
Chorus 
Cause shes just numbers on the jukebox that I lean on 
Theres a little bit of her in every hurtin song
I used to hate the thought of her til her memory I forget
Cause shes just numbers on the jukebox
B-11 takes me back to the first dance we shared
And A-14 reveals the truth she never cared
One by one theyre telling all the stories of my past 
And why the love I thought could never die lies here behind this glass
Repeat Chorus
