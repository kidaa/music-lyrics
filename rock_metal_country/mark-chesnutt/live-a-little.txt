Roger Springer/Tony Martin
You've got to give a little take a little
Sit a spell learn to whittle
Live a little now and then
Unwind take your time leave your cares all behind
And see what's around the bend
This life ain't coming 'round again
So give a little take a little
Live a little now and then
In a hurry late for work
Rush and worry but what's it worth
You might earn a rich man's pay
But it won't buy you one more day
You've got to give a little take a little
Sit a spell learn to whittle
Live a little now and then
Unwind take your time leave your cares all behind
And see what's around the bend
This life ain't coming 'round again
So give a little take a little
Live a little now and then
Busy making your weight in gold
But you can't take it when you go
Don't care how high you build your stack
They don't make a hearse with a luggage rack
You've got to give a little take a little
Sit a spell learn to whittle
Live a little now and then
Unwind take your time leave your cares all behind
And see what's around the bend
This life ain't coming 'round again
So give a little take a little
Live a little now and then
This life ain't coming 'round again
So lean back chew the fat
Take a day just to piddle
Live a little now and then
