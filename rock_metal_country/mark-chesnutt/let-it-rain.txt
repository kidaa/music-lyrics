Storm clouds rising flash of lightning rattles that ole porch swing
Window open curtains dancing just you and me
As the thunder rolls on we'll just hold on neath the light of this candle flame.
Oh this is perfect what a night let it rain
Let your love pour down down all around let it 
Fill my heart let it flood this house
Let the world outside just wash on by we'll just lay right here and hold on tight
Let it rain
Let it rain
Old man weather had it together when he planned this night 
From out of the blue he set the mood turned down the lights
Just when we thought the storm was over here it comes again
So lay back down in these arms let it rain
Let your love pour down down all around let it 
Fill my heart let it flood this house
Let the world outside just wash on by we'll just lay right here and hold on tight
Let it rain
Let it rain
