It's been too long
Since I traveled down
That ol' gravel road
On the north end of town
And I need a taste
Of the good ol' days gone
So tonight I let my memory
Take me home
And I'll be seventeen on my way to pick her up
With a half a dozen roses
In my daddy's pickup truck
And for a little while I'll just hold her in my arms
Dream on and on and on
Tonight I'll let my memory take me home
We grew apart and I moved away
It's a choice I regret
A little more every day
God I love to go back
To the good ol' days gone
So tonight I'll let my memory
Take me home
And I'll be seventeen on my way to pick her up
With a half a dozen roses
In my daddy's pickup truck
And for a little while I'll just hold her in my arms
Dream on and on and on
Tonight I'll let my memory take me home
Yesterday ain't that far away
I'll just close my eyes
And drift away
I'll be seventeen on my way to pick her up
With a half a dozen roses
In my daddy's pickup truck
And for a little while I'll just hold her in my arms
Dream on and on and on
Tonight I'll let my memory take me home
Dream on and on and on
Tonight I'll let my memory take me home
