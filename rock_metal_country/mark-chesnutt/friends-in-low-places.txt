Dewayne Blackwell, Bud Lee
Blame it all on my roots, I showed up in boots
And ruined your black tie affair
The last one to show, the last one to know
The last one you thought youd see there
I saw the surprise, and the fear in his eyes
When I took his glass of champagne
Then I toasted you, said honey we may be through
But youll never hear me complain
Chorus
Cause Ive got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns and there beer chases
My blues away and Ill be OK
Hey, Im not big on social graces
Think Ill slip on down to the Oasis
Oh Ive got friends in low places
I guess I was wrong. I just dont belong
But then Ive been there before
Everythings all right, Ill just say goodnight
And Ill show myself to the door
Hey, I didnt mean to cause a big scene
But give me an hour and then
Ill be as high as this ivory tower
That youre livin in
Repeat Chorus
