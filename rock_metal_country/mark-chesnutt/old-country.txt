Bobby Harden
City sun goes down at night 
Making way for neon lights 
Country boy is lookin at the moon 
City girl is dressed just right
She may stay out late tonight
Country boy just plowed today til noon
Chorus:
From Birmingham to Ohio
How they met nobody knows
Every now and then they get together
She used to want to climb the walls
Shed never been loved at all
Not until old country came to town
Hes the first one to the room
Ice and drinks will be up soon
Everything is perfect when she walks in
They kiss and hold each other tight 
They know whats in store tonight
This aint some place they have never been
Repeat Chorus
