Steve Earle
Seems like Ive been here before
Just outside some closing door
Standing here just searching for a line
Youd think by now Id have it down
I know I should be wiser now
Cause no ones gonna bail me out this time
Chorus
Im not gettin any better at good-byes
Im not any better now than when I first began
It hurts every bit as much as it did way back then
I suppose Ill cry a lot
The only thing for sure is Im not gettin any better at goodbye
Friends may come and friends may go 
Lovers memories die so slow
And they wont always let you know its time
But even this shall pass I guess
Youll just be like all the rest
Ill start dusting off all my best lines
Repeat Chorus
