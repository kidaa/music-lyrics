Jim Rushing, Herb McCullough
Hey you there in the mirror 
I didnt know you had a smile
Ive watched the canyons on your face
Grow deeper with the miles
With your heart barely beating
And your spirit black and blue
I was sure that you were headed
For an early waterloo
Hey you there in the mirror
What happened to your frown
That twinkle in those smiling eyes
Is shining like a crown
You must have met somebody
With compassion in her heart
Who looked upon your Haggard face 
And saw a work of art
Chorus
Hey you there in the mirror
Well aint you lookin proud
And not long ago you harbored thoughts 
Of throwin in the towel
Each day youre feelin stronger
Theres new life in your blood
Why I thought that weathered face
Would look so good in love
Repeat Chorus
