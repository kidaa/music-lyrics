Tim Mensy/Gary Harrison
Thirty years today she's been upon this earth
And she can't help but wonder what it's all been worth
She swears she loves those kids and she doesn't mind that load
But there ain't much conversation with a three-year-old
She's trapped inside these walls
A prisoner in this fine suburban home...so
She dreams she dreams
He'll come home from work and carry her away
And he'll see she needs
The man she's still in love with when she dreams
And he's proud of his work and the ladder that he's climbed
But from that high-rise office he can't hear her cry
Ringing telephones and decisions to be made
Even when he gets home he's so far away
Then he drifts off to sleep
And she enters her world of make believe
She dreams she dreams
He'll come home from work and carry her away
And he'll see she needs
The man she's still in love with when she dreams
