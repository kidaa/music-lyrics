Weel, earll this morning it dawned on me
the kind of man she needed me to be
she made a list and laid it there beside me on the bed
now what I should-a done keeps running through my head
Chorus
Oh I should-a done this and I should-a done that
I should-a been there then shed-a never left
I should-a been hangin on every word she ever had to say
but its a little too late shes a little too gone
shes a little too right Im a little too wrong
now would be a good time to change 
but its a little too late
Last night I came home at a quarter til three
and to my suprise she wasnt mad at me
I thought she finlly realized not to worry Id be home
and then I realized this morning she was gone
repeat chorus
