Mark Wright, Ronnie Rogers
Lightning hit that oak tree weve been lookin at for years
This summer oh I know well miss the shade - we just made it through
The coldest winter we ever knew and our ole hound Dixie passed away
Yeah I guess Ive got things to be down about but in spite of it all honey aint no doubt
Chorus 
Im livin the life of a lucky man
Counting my blessings holding your hand
I thank the Lord above for sending me your love
And for giving me the life of a lucky man 
So many things we talk about never do come true 
But Heaven knows I wish they could for you - believe me I know
You should be tempted to go that would be the easy thing to do
So many just give up and walk away but in spite of it all youre strong enough to stay
Repeat Chorus
Bridge
I guess Ive got things to be down about
But in spite of it all honey aint no doubt
