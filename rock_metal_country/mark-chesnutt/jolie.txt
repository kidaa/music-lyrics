Well I left Louisiana 
Lookin' for some higher ground 
Trying to make my crazy dream come true 
But six months in Atlanta 
Done tuned my heart around 
Tell me you still want me too 
Let me come back home to you 
Please Jolie 
Put me under your spell again 
Won't you make me feel well again 
Take me out of this Hell I'm in 
Oh please, Jolie 
This time I'm gonna treat you right 
All I want to do is hold you tight 
Believe me I've seen the light Jolie 
That day I left you cryin' 
On the shores of Ponchatrain 
I left the only dream I'll ever need 
Baby I ain't lying 
I can't put out this flame 
Gonna get down on my knees 
Meet me down in New Orleans 
Please Jolie 
Put me under your spell again 
Won't you make me feel well again 
Take me out of this Hell I'm in 
Oh please, Jolie 
This time I'm gonna treat you right 
All I want to do is hold you tight 
Believe me I've seen the light Jolie 
Please Jolie 
Put me under your spell again 
Won't you make me feel well again 
Take me out of this Hell I'm in 
Oh please, Jolie 
This time I'm gonna treat you right 
All I want to do is hold you tight 
Believe me I've seen the light Jolie 
Tell your momma tell your daddy too 
Tell 'em that I'm comin' home for you 
Gotta ring for your pretty little hand 
Gonna be your ever lovin' man 
Tell your momma tell your daddy too 
Tell 'em that I'm comin' home for you 
Gotta ring for your pretty little hand 
Gonna be your ever lovin' man.
