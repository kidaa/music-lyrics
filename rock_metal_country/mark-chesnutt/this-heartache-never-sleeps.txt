I worked myself to the bone
Tired as a man can get
It's the only way that I know
Might help me to forget
I lay me down
And I pray my soul to keep
Now it's two a.m. and I should be
Sleeping like a log
But I can't blame the poundin' rain
Or the neighbor's barkin' dog
It's what you do to me
This heartache never sleeps
Yeah twenty four hours of every day
I can feel it down in my chest
From the moment you walked away
Well I ain't got no rest
It won't let me be-eee-eeee-e
This heartache never sleeps
Well like a ghost that haunts me
Down at the end of my bed
Your memory, it taunts me
And it won't stay out of my head
Till you come back
It ain't never gonna leave
So I might as well get out of this bed
And put the coffee on
Girl you know I'm not alone
At the breakin' of the dawn
'Cause just like me
This heartache never sleeps
Yeah twenty four hours of every day
I can feel it down in my chest
From the moment you walked away
Well I ain't got no rest
It won't let me be-eee-eeee-e
This heartache never sleeps
It won't let me be-eee-eeee-e
This heartache never sleeps
It won't let me be
It won't let me be
This heartache never sleeps
