Mark Wright
Chorus
Theres danger at my door and I dont need no more
Of her danger at my door - All Ive been livin for
Was for her to love me more than she ever loved anybody before
But she broke my heart oh so many times and Im trying to fight
my will and send her home tonight
Theres danger at my door and I dont need no more
Of her danger at my door
Too many times Ive chased a false alarm
Too many lonely nights let down my guard
Too many memories make this moment extra special hard
Cause all that I can remember is laying there in her arms
Theres danger at my door and I dont need no more
Of her danger at my door
I finally fall asleep alone again
But I know my day has not come to an end
Cause somewhere in the night shell try to find her way back in
And all that I can hope for is for strength to be my friend
