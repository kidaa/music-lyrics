Bobby Braddock, Rafe Van Hoy
I left town two years ago and moved on up to Idaho
But swore that Id be back again - Pick up where I left off, oh man
Left behind some lovely ladies
Grown up sexy Texas babies
I got back in town tonight
Anticipating much delight
I pulled out my black book and called up my old lovers
I got five newlyweds and two expectant mothers
Chorus:
All my old flames have new names
Theres a lot of girls in town
Who tied the knot and settled down
I thought Id start a fire with one of my old flames
But theyve all got new names
My sexy little dirt road sport is now called Mrs. Davenport
My pretty little black-eyed Susies now Mrs. Susan Van Der Hoosie
Rosie who could blow my mind is sister Rose on channel nine
The wildest lover of my life is now a federal judges wife
They dont want to recognize this old familiar face
Im just a bad reminder of their wild and woolly days
Repeat Chorus
