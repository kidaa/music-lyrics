Chorus
My hearts too broke to pay attention
If love was a penny I couldnt afford to fall
Every girl in the world tonight could have sweet intentions
My hearts too broke to pay attention
I was heart broke and feelin down
Billy Joe said lets go to town
He said an ounce of cure 
Is worth a pound of prevention
He said I know a little waterin hole 
Where the band is hot and the beer is hot
Theres more woman there
Than at a Tupperware convention
Repeat Chorus
I aint ready for another love
Billy Joes trying to fix me up
Hes a friend to the end 
Hes a man on a mission
He just punched me in the side 
said did you see what just walked by
She had a million dollar smile
And a body in mint condition
