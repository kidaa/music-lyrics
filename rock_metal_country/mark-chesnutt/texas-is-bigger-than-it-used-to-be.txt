Ronnie Rogers, Mark Wright, Joe Johnston
Lucky me I grew up beneath that ole lone star
I was raised on fiddle and the steel guitar
Well it used to be if you wanted to swing to a good ole country song
You had to sing your way to Ft. Worth, Houston, Dallas, San Antone
But oh how its grown
Chorus
Texas is bigger than it used to be 
Coast to coast its alive in most
Every town and city
I should know Im on the road
And lovin what I see
Texas is bigger than it used to be
Its one, two, three step dancin in the line
Stretchin that denim having a good time
My daddy told me years ago - he said son therell come a day
When itll spread to Minnesota, New York City to LA
Its happening just that way
