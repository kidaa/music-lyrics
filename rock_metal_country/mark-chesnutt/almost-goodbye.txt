There was rain on the street last night 
We stood beneath the front door light 
And everything we said we made sure the neighbors heard 
You called me this, I called you that 
Standing on the welcome mat 
Everything we felt it all came down to just one word 
But you couldn't say it and I couldn't say it 
CHORUS:  
You know I tried my best to go 
I know you cried 'cause I hurt you so 
It should have been easy to say that we were through 
But to walk away from love was more than we could do 
It was almost goodbye 
Almost goodbye 
Now there was sun through the blinds this morning 
When I opened up my eyes  
Outside I could hear a mockingbird 
And I could feel your heartbeat as you layed there by my side 
I thought of how the world could end with just one word 
But you didn't say it, and I didn't say it 
CHORUS 
Sometimes the most important words are the ones that you leave unspoken 
You know I tried my best to go 
And I know you cried 'cause I hurt you so 
It should have been easy to say that we were through 
But to walk away from love that way was more than we could do 
It was almost goodbye 
Almost goodbye, no, I couldn't say it was 
Almost goodbye, oh oh 
Almost goodbye.
