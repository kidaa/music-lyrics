Roger Springer, Slugger Morrissette
I used to come in here maybe once or twice a year
But only when I had a good excuse
Id have one or two then be on my way
But thats way before she told me we were through
Chorus
Now any ol reason will do, any ol thing that I can use
These days, these nights, the clouds, the rain, the moon
I dont have to think about the love I live without
Or the heart she left that never will be used - really, any ol reason will do
At first I told myself shed never cross my mind
Unless I was to meet her eye to eye 
And only when I felt alone would I turn her memory on
Well I guess that means I told myself a lie
Repeat Chorus
