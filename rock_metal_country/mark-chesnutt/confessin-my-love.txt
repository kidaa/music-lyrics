Shawn Camp/John Scott Sherrill
I tossed and turned and tried counting sheep
When will I ever learn how I'll ever sleep
'Til you're by my side it's just a waste of time
Ain't no use tryin' to get you off my mind
So I guess I'll be confessin' my love, confessin' my love
There ain't gonna be no restin' at all 'cause I want you too much
I might get all embarrassed and a little tongue-tied
";Cause I ain't had no lessons in expressin' it right
Yes I guess I'll be confessin' my love to you tonight
Toughest thing to do is up and speak my mind
I've been wanting you for too long a time
I just can't take this anymore
'Bout to hear some knockin' on your front door
So I guess I'll be confessin' my love, confessin' my love
There ain't gonna be no restin' at all 'cause I want you too much
I might get all embarrassed and a little tongue-tied
";Cause I ain't had no lessons in expressin' it right
Yes I guess I'll be confessin' my love to you tonight
