David Lott, Glenn Gorden, Mark Chesnutt
Its early May and the summer heat is comin down
Aprils gone and my heart is nowhere to be found
Teardrops fall like showers from the sky
And what Id give just to look in Aprils eyes
Another year goes by and I wait for her to return
She leaves a chill in my soul, but a fire always burns
And she cant break the tie that binds, so Ill never make her choose
Ill just go on being Aprils fool
So little time, when she is mine I know
Ill hold her close and never let it show
If I could only make her stay, God knows
I would, as she turns and walks away
I know Ill always remain Aprils fool
As she turns and walks away, I know
Ill always remain Aprils fool
Its early May and the summer heat is coming down
