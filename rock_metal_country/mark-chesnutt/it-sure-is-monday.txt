With the alarm clock ting-a-ling ringin' in my head 
                          I woke up dog tired, beat down, half dead 
                          Tryin' to recover from another wild weekend 
                          Chuggin' down coffee while I should have been sleepin'  
                          Well it sure is Monday idn't it now 
                          I gotta myself through the week somehow 
                          I had a ball Friday, Saturday and Sunday 
                          But it's all over now and it sure is Monday  
                          Oh, I got to the job site at a quarter past nine 
                          And somehow I stayed awake till lunch time 
                          And then I caught a little nap, stretched out in my truck bed 
                          My feet still twitchin' to the music in my head  
                          Well it sure is Monday, ain't it the truth 
                          I partied too hardy, now I'm payin' my dues 
                          I had a ball Friday, Saturday and Sunday 
                          But it's all over now and it sure is Monday  
                          Well it sure is Monday, ain't it a sin 
                          I gotta work my way through the week again 
                          I had a ball Friday, Saturday and Sunday 
                          But it's all over now and it sure is Monday 
                          Yeah, it's all over now and it sure is Monday.
