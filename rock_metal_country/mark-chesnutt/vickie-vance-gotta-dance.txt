Bill Kenner, Mark Wright
Spinnin those curlers round all day
Her little beauty shop provides a way
To work at home and sleep in late
So she can dance the night away
Chorus
Pilot gotta fly---eagle gotta soar
Give a baby candy---gotta give it more
Cowboy gotta ride---gambler gotta chance
Vickie Vance gotta dance---Vickie Vance gotta dance
She can be dancin to nothin at all 
And she does a mean swing with the shadows on the wall
Yeah and I bet shes done the two step a million times
Yeah she drives all the boys on the dance floor wild
Repeat Chorus
Oooh, she cant stand still
Yeah, shes dancin off the wall 
Dancin on the window sill
