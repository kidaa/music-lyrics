Gotta find somethin' to ease my mind
Gotta get it off of you
You tear at my heart strings one more time
With what you're puttin' me through
I'm not much on hangin' around
Where I'm not wanted at all
I'm not gonna be your love sick clown
Waitin' for your beck and call
I'm gonna get a life
That's what I'm gonna do
So startin' now
You can find one too
I'm gonna get a life
Like I should have done
A long time ago
Before you wrecked this one
This'll be the last time you spin your wheels
Leaving like a maniac
You don't care about the way I feel
There's no need in comin' back
I'm gonna get a life
That's what I'm gonna do
So startin' now
You can find one too
I'm gonna get a life
Like I should have done
A long time ago
Before you wrecked this one
Yeah, I'm gonna get a life
Before the gettin's done
I'm gonna get a life
That's what I'm gonna do
So startin' now
You can find one too
I'm gonna get a life
Like I should have done
A long time ago
Before you wrecked this one
I'm gonna get a life
Before the gettin's done
