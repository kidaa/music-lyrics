Mark Wright, Larry Kingston
You can tell everyone love is over and done
You can pack all your things and go
You can lie to yourself and say theres nothing else
But theres something I think you should know
Chorus
And Its never really over even though you say were through 
You may be over me but cant you see Its not over if Im not over you
Theres not much I can do if its over for you
Ill just wish you the best when you leave
But youve played such a part in my life and in my heart
Youll always be a part of me
Repeat Chorus
You may be over me but cant you see 
Its not over if Im not over you
