Mark Chesnutt, Roger Springer, Slugger Morrissette
Ever since you told me we were through
Ive been down, Ive been down
The love you said Id find to take your place
Never came around, never came around
But one of these days Ill stand on my own
And Ill turn this bleeding heart in to stone
Chorus
Gonna reach way down inside and find a brand new way to live
Got plans to forget about the way you made me feel
Gonna walk outside one night and turn your memory loose
And when I do, I might even quit loving you
And when I do, I might even quit loving you
There was time I thought I knew for certain 
Youd come home, youd come home
But judging from the nights Ive spent without you
I was wrong, I was wrong
The time has finally come to face the truth 
Theres only one thing left I can do
Repeat Chorus
