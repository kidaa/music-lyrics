At night the wind blows in the rain
Against the window pane
I hear you call my name
Your voice whispers in my ear
The words are still so dear
It's almost like you're here
I can almost feel your breathing
I can almost touch your face
You didn't know that you'd be leaving
Memories time cannot erase
At night with feelings running deep
As I fall asleep
It's almost like you're here
In silence as I sit and stare
I see you sitting there
Brushing down your hair
And even through a blur of tears
The vision is so clear
It's almost like you're here
I can almost feel your breathing
I can almost touch your face
You didn't know that you'd be leaving
Memories time cannot erase
At night the wind blows in the rain
Against the window pane
It's almost like you're here
It's almost like you're here
