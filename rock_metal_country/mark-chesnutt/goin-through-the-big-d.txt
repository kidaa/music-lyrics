Mark Wright/Ronnie Rogers/Jon Wright
Six short months we went together
Decided it should be forever
Two paychecks are better than one
A diamond ring and it was done
Bought her a house like I said I would
In sub-divided neighborhood
The fuse got short and the nights got long
It was over long gone
Before I knew
Where I was headed to
I'm goin' through the big D
And don't mean Dallas
I can't believe what the judge had to tell us
I got the Jeep she got the palace
I'm goin' through the big D
And don't mean Dallas
Things like this are never final
I'm still payin' on the vinyl
Flooring in the laundry room
It's multi-colored and waterproof
It's a little bit tough to face my friends
The ones that said I jumped in
The river of love a little too soon
That was August
This is June and it's a different tune
I'm goin' through the big D
And don't mean Dallas
I can't believe what the judge had to tell us
I got the Jeep she got the palace
I'm goin' through the big D
And don't mean Dallas
I'm goin' through the big D
And don't mean Dallas
I can't believe what the judge had to tell us
I got the Jeep she got the two bedroom 
Mortgage is due
Siding light blue palace
I'm goin' through the big D
And don't mean Dallas
I'm goin' through the big D
And don't mean Dallas
