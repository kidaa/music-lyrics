Brother Jukebox...sister wine
Mother freedom...father of time
Since she left me by myself
Youre the only family Ive got left
I go down to that same old cafe
Where I try to wash my troubles away
Im still down and Im still all alone 
But it beats stayin home all night long
Repeat Chorus
I go home and I climb that old stairway
And I tell myself ";Tomorrows a new day";
But I know Ill just go down again
And spend my time with my new next-of-kin
Repeat Chorus
