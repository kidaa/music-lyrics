Gary Scruggs, Mark Wright
Im dying to forget about those goodbye words you said
I thought everything was right but you went and left instead
No pain, no gain, well Im not out to win
All I really want to do is live to love again
Chorus
Trying to postpone the pain - Stay in from the rain
Buy a little time - Keep you off my brain
Get out and go insane - Stay off memry lane
Tonight Ill be flying trying to postpone the pain
Until that day arrives
Ill spend all my nights
Repeat Chorus
The best way to survive
Is spending all my nights
Repeat Chorus
