Roger Springer, Tony Martin, Reese Wilson
Once in a lifetime love comes along
And I know that its you that Im waiting on
And that sweet promise of our first kiss
Keeps me hangin on through times like this 
Chorus
So wherever you are Im thinking of you 
I wonder if youre thinking of me, too
Theres only so long time can keep us apart
So until we meet keep me in your heart 
Keep wishing upon that same ol star
And know that I love you wherever you are
Tag
So until we meet keep me in your heart 
Keep wishing upon that same ol star
And know that I love you wherever you are
