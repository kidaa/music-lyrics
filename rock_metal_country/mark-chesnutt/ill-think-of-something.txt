Jerry Foster, Bill Rice
I dont know how Ill get her off my mind - but give me time
Ill think of something
I cant say that Im all right - but by tonight
Ill think of something
Ill find so many things to do that I wont have the time to think of her
And then if shes still on my mind Ill try to drink enough to drown the hurt
And if that dont work 
Ill think of something
Where do I go for love that I still need - now that Im free
Ill think of something
And if someday by accident we meet - and I cant speak
Ill think of something
If I cant say a word to her Ill blame it on this lump thats in my throat
And standing there what will I do to hide my love enough that it wont show
Well I dont know
But Ill think of something
