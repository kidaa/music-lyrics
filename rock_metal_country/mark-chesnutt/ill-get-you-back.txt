Why couldn't I hear the sound of your heart breakin' 
Why couldn't I see the mistakes I was makin' 
Why didn't I feel the distance in your kiss 
Well I can't let you get away with leavin' me like this 
I'll get you back, this ain't over yet 
Don't know what I'll do but I'll think of somethin' 
I'll get you back, you're gonna get 
All the love that you've got comin' 
I won't give up until I prove 
My heart and soul belong to you 
Whatever it takes 
I'll get you back 
Now I'm gonna be the man you've always dreamed of 
Love's the only thing I'll let come between us 
You still ain't got the best of me 
I'll show you my love is true, just you wait and see 
I'll get you back, this ain't over yet 
Don't know what I'll do but I'll think of somethin' 
I'll get you back, you're gonna get 
All the love that you've got comin' 
I won't give up until I prove 
My heart and soul belong to you 
Whatever it takes 
I'll get you back 
Whatever it takes 
I'll get you back.
