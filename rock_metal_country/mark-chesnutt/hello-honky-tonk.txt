Hows the world been treatin you
Lord how long has it been
We got some catchin up to do
Good to see you my old friend
Chorus
Hello honky tonk long time no see
Never knew that old jukebox could ever sound so sweet
How I missed your neon lights they sure are a welcome sight
Goodbye lonely nights - hello honky tonk
Im glad nobodys patched that hole
where my head went through the wall
Cause I just may head that way again
Before we reach last call 
Dont guess I was cut out for 
That old domestic life 
When she told me to hit the door 
I hit yours tonight
Repeat Chorus
Tag
Who cares whos right or wrong
The pain will soon be gone
Goodbye wont hurt too long 
Hello honky tonk
