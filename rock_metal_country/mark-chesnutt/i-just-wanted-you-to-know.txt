Are you alone---can you talk to an old friend
Right or wrong---I had to hear your voice again
Unwritten law, protocol
Says to leave the past alone
Chorus
I just wanted you to know 
Sometimes driving home at night 
I let your memory take control
And you're sitting by my side
I turn up the radio
And cruise down old route 59
And girl it's solid gold, well, I'll let you go
I just wanted you to know
Through the vine---I heard your life has turned out well
As for mine---you know it's really hard to tell
'Cause now and then what might have been
Interferes with what might be
Repeat Chorus
Please don't cry, I'll say goodbye
And I wont call you anymore
Repeat Chorus
