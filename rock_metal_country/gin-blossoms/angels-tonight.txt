Party girls between the sheets
She can't show that much to me
I'd rather drink until I see
Angels tonight
I had a girl I thought was mine
I wised up and just in time
Such wisdom makes these sluts look like
Angels tonight...
As we collide as the lights go out
There's someone else she thinks about
It's all for the best that I can't figure out
Angels tonight...
