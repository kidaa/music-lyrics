Jesse Valenzuela, Jim Swafford
You can see it in her letters
On the paper with her pen
Her response is getting stronger 
I think she's coming round again
Tell me Mrs. Rita 
What's it say in my tarot
Read my palm and tell me 
Why do lovers come and go
Is she coming round for me once again
Around or was that just the end
I just hope she's coming round again
I've been keeping myself busy 
With my books and with my tapes
Every day's much better 
Since I've slowed my drinking pace
There's no swimming in the bottle 
It's just someplace we all drown
I lost myself in sorrow 
lost my confidence in doubt
Is she coming 'round for me once again
Around or was that just the end
I just hope she's coming round again
Get in the car and drive through town
Down the block and back around
Pretending that she's there with me we drive
Gone forever...
My patience keeps me plaintive 
My high hopes keep me alone
My lover's will is shaken 
I wish she would just come home
So tell me Mrs. Rita 
What's it say in my tarot
Read my palm and tell me 
Why do lovers come and go
Is she coming round for me once again
Around or was that just the end
