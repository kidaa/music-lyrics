Written in 1908 by Jack Norworth and Albert Von Tilzer 
Katie Casey was baseball mad 
had the fever and had it bad 
Just to root for the home town crew 
every sou, Katie blew 
On a Saturday her young beau 
called to see if she'd like to go 
to see a show but Miss Kate said ";No, 
";I'll tell you what you can do..."; 
CHORUS 
Take me out to the ball game 
take me out to the crowd 
buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack 
I don't care if I never get back 
So it's root, root, root for the home team 
if they don't win it's a shame 
for it's one, two, three strikes you're out 
at the old ball game 
SECOND VERSE 
Katie Casey saw all the games 
knew all the players by their first names 
told the umpire he was wrong 
all along, good and strong 
When the score was just two to two 
cagey Casey knew what to do 
just to cheer up the boys she knew 
she made the gang sing this song 
CHORUS
