It was dark and cool
She said I didn't know all the rules
She made her mind up fast
She took a walk and she didn't come back
Girls can't wait...
Everyone should know
Life ain't no picture show
You'll lose your place in line
You'll end up in the life's back row ?
Girls can't wait
Now I'm all alone
Four empty walls and a telephone
All I know right now is girls can't wait...
I'm just marking time
I hold court with some friends of mine
I think I love that girl 
I'm thinking that I could change her mind
Girls can't wait...
