The fireworks from the rooftops fall down around this hotel 
So tell it seems like so long since I've had you beside me here
We used to walk together 
I've nothing to show me now and it seems like so long 
Since I've had you beside me here
Well he's got ropes and chains all around her heart
And nothing I can say could ever tear them apart
Her mumbles come now softly ?
From the other side of this room
And the things she won't say
Just reminds she's not alone
Well I can't help but feeling a little more than blue
Cause the things that matter just don't mean a damn to you
Well he's got ropes and chains all around her heart
And nothing I can say could ever tear them apart
The fireworks from the roofs all fall down around you 
So tell it seems like so long since I've had you beside me here
Lets a walk together 
I've nothing to show me now and it seems like so long 
Since I've had you beside me here
Well he's got ropes and chains all around her heart
And nothing I can say could ever tear them apart...
