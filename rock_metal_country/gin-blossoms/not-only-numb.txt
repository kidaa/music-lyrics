Phillip Rhodes, Robin Wilson
Looking all around the room I see the clutter in the gloom
I'm not only back, I'm not only numb
Changing shades within the evening
In a day then I'll be leaving
I'm not only back, I'm not only numb
When the air at home is thin
Getting out then looking in
Yeah she knows, she knows, she knows
It ain't awful hard to tell
What it's like, my little hell
Yeah she knows, she knows, she knows
I'm now familiar with the tone I hear in bed when I'm alone
I'm not only back, I'm not only numb
In the shade below the eaves
Think I could chain smoke anything
I'm not only back, I'm not only numb
When the air at home is thin
Getting out, then looking in
Yeah she knows, she knows, she knows
It ain't awful hard to tell
What it's like, my little hell
Yeah she knows, she knows, she knows
She knows, she knows, she knows
She sees all the cars around the parking lots of bars we've played and stayed
Started laughing, looking down upon the bed that we've made
We've made, we've made, we've made
She sees all the cars around the parking lots of bars we've played and stayed
Started laughing, looking falling down across the bed that we've made
We've made, we've made, we've made
The air at home is thin
When getting out, then looking in
I'm not only back, I'm not only numb
Changing shades within the evening
In a day, then I'll be leaving
I'm not only back, I'm not only numb...
