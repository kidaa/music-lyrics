Phillip Rhodes, Robin Wilson
Looking up I saw nothing
But blue in the bluest sky
And now it's creeping across my eye
Going down in my mind, down in my mind
I'm high and I'm hopeless
So help me to get untied
Fast asleep now I'm going blind
Falling down in my mind, down in my mind
Just fine
Emulate the style
A competition smile
Now I'm running, not looking
And opening up my brain
Where it's easy to lose my name
Looking dumb in the rain, dumb in the rain
I'm hoping you'll notice
That no one else helps me grow
Oh, it's not easy to let you know
What I'm dying to show
Dying until you know
Pretending all the while
A competition smile
Now I've thrown something far
And it haunts me like a curse
I'm like a stone
Falling hard
And I'm only getting worse
Looking up I saw nothing
But blue in the bluest sky
And now it's creeping across my eye
And going down in my mind, down in my mind
I'm high and I'm hopeless
So help me to get untied
Fast asleep now I'm going blind
Falling down in my mind, down in my mind
Just fine
Pretending all the while
A competition smile
