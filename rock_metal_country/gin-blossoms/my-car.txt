Streetlights on, the night air's cool
I'm driving right past my old school
I'm looking for my pack of cigarettes
I'm thinking back on things I've done
I can't forget the stupid ones
It seems I do my best by accident
What's that sound, what's that song
What's this street I'm driving on
In my car
In my car
I miss her feel, her touch, her taste
I feel the distance everyplace
This distance can't be taken casually
I take my time, just drive around
Feeling lost in my hometown
Every turn I take is comforting
What's that sound, what's that song
What's this street I'm driving on
In my car
In my car
I'll take a break from all their big plans
My first mistake was listening to them
I made a mess it's all been proven
Over and over again
Over and over again
Streetlights on, the night air's cool
I'm driving right past my old school
Looking for some face I can't forget
I take my time, just drive around
Feeling lost in my hometown
Every turn I take's an accident
