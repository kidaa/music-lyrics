I've been waiting around all night
Your warm kiss is on my mind
A piece of you is all I've got
But the whole damn thing is what I want
I've been waiting around here all night long
Holding on to these memories until they come undone
My hands are tied...
Telephone's ringing by my bed
I pick it on up and the line goes dead
I splash summer water on my face
Clears my mind I'm out of this place
I've been waiting around here all night long
Holding on to these memories until they come undone
My hands are tied...
My nerves are frayed and I've had enough
I'm a lot afraid that it'll hurt too much
I'm can't seem to stop at all
I'm plain wore through waiting for your call
I've been waiting around here all night long
Holding on to these memories until they come undone
My hands are tied...
Want you round here all the time
Just can't seem to shake you off my mind
