I'll stick around 
And see how bad it gets 
I'll settle down 
And deal with old regrets 
You know I 
I adore you 

I can't let you go 
Can't let you go 
You're part of my soul 
You're all that I know 
Can't let you go 

Is it better now 
Do you feel like all is fair 
Can we work it out 
So it's easier for me to bear 
Because life 
It can blind you 

Down from the edge 
I can see where we end 
I'd give up all my days to go back 
There was all this wonder 
And all this magic 
Is all this wonder 
Over and done 

If love were a whisper 
What would I give you to speak 
Maybe you're out of my reach 

I can't let you go
