It's sitting by the overcoat, 
The second shelf, the note she wrote 
That I can't bring myself to throw away 
And also 
Reach she said for no one else but you, 
Cuz you won't turn away 
When someone else is gone 

I'm sorry 'bout the attitude 
I need to give when I'm with you 
But no one else would take this shit from me 
And I'm so 
Terrified of no one else but me 
I'm here all the time 
I won't go away 
It's me, yeah I can't get myself to go away 
It's me, and I can't get myself to go away 
Oh God I shouldn't feel this way 

[chorus]

Reach down your hand in your pocket 
Pull out some hope for me 
It's been a long day, always ain't that right 
And no Lord your hand won't stop it 
Just keep you trembling 
It's been a long day, always ain't that right 

Well I'm surprised that you'd believe 
In any thing that comes from me 
I didn't hear from you or from someone else 
And you're so 
Set in life man, a pisser they're waiting 
Too damn bad you get so far so fast 
So what, so long 

chorus 

It's me, yeah and I can't get myself to go away 
It's me, yeah and I can't get myself to go away 
Oh God I shouldn't feel this way 

[chorus]
