Well, it's for sure 
Well, things came down hard 
But you couldn't wait here 
Well all I ever think about is myself
Well anyone else
Well they get strung out But I get high, high, high  
But it's something you'd better get straight 
I don't got no room in my life Pick up the anchor and set it straight 
Stop, well I, I don't want to thank you Honey, 
I don't think so
You'd better stop, well try, 
And if there's a distance here between us 
It's you and I and I Yeah, well it's a shame 
You pander to me 
Come on stroke on my ego 
Well I've never been dumped before here by anyone else 
And what doesn't kill you It makes you linger 
And it makes you wonder, yeah
For goodness sake have you ever been asleep 
Thinking one thing, I'd be here 
What doesn't kill you, doesn't stay 
Stop, well I, I don't want to thank you
Honey, I don't think so 
You'd better stop, well try, 
And if there's a distance here between us 
It's you and I and I 
But it's something you'd better get straight
I don't got no room in my life 
Pick up the anchor and set it straight 
Stop, well I, 
I don't want to thank you 
Honey, I don't think so 
You'd better stop, well try, 
And if there's a distance here between us 
It's you and I and I 
Stop, well I,
I don't want to thank you Honey,
I don't think so
You'd better stop, well try, 
And if there's a distance here between us 
It's you and I and I
