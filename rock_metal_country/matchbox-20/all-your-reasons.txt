Why dont you just go away
I cant seem to get my head straight
There's so much i need 2 say
It could take
All day

But what you got
I dont need it
I cant listen 
To all your reasons
Wake up 
I dont feel it
I cant listen 
To all your reasons

Your bad mood just ties my hands
Turning cartwheels into headstands
I've done everything i can
Gave all
I had

But what you got
I dont need it
I cant listen 
To all your reasons
Wake up 
I dont feel it
I cant listen 
To all your reasons

Tell me whyyyyyyy...

It dont have to me
So worn down 
So torn up 
Still your love

But what you got
I dont need it
I cant listen 
To all your reasons
Wake up 
I dont feel it
I cant listen 
To all your reasons

Woman 
I dont need it
I cant listen 
To all your reasons
Wake up 
I dont feel it
I cant listen 
To all your reasons

Tell me why
