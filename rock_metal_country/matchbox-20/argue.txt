She don't, but she will 
He says anything to keep her by him 
She takes, what she gets, and she never did flinch 
over, and over, well anyone 
With any mind would think that's all she gets 

[chorus]

If you want you can get to know me well 
We get along so we shouldn't argue 
And I don't know, said I don't know 
All these feelings cloud up my reasoning 
Cloud up my reasoning 

I know, but I still 
Believe in ignorance as my best defense 
So go on, wreck me 
Funny how I carry on, and not be taken over 
Will not roll over on anyone, 
cuz anyone would stand up on my side 

[chorus]

You know it's funny how sometimes, 
It don't work out like you want to 
No you never get nothing at all 
Then she tells you that it's nothing at all 
Then she tells you that it's over, boy don't you hate it 
When it's over 
I guess something just got lost, and it deeply saddens me 
So over, and over anyone, who's anyone 

[chorus]
