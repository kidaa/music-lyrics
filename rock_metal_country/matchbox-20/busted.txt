I forget when words were only words 
She knows the party makes me nervous 
In this stage we can't get hurt 
Don't try to understand me 

We're too cool to be alone 
But, not too crazy to get busted 

I found out one life ain't enough 
I need another soul to feed on 
I'm the flame I can't get burnt 
I'm wholly understated 

I found silence in this space 
An on and off again attraction 
I need such amazing grace 
Heaven sweep me away 

[chorus]

Love don't change, don't come around here 
Don't wear my heart on your sleeve 
Like a high school letter 
Don't strain, cuz nothing ever comes from it 
And the people we've become, well 
They've never been the people who we are 

I strap on one horse and prayed for luck 
I dug another hole to bleed 
I know exactly how this works 
I need a new feel dirty 

I don't need you crowding up my space 
I just want to get inside you 
You can't blame the heart you save 
Giving something awa 

[chorus]

I dreamed that the world was crumbling down 
We sat on my back porch and watched it 
I dreamed that the buildings all fell down 
We sat on my back porch and watched it 
In my head I heard the sound 
Like fifteen strangers dancing 

But oh how I want you to know me 
Oh how I want you to know me 
Oh how I wish I was somebody else, baby 
Oh how I wish you could own me 

[chorus]
