Something is wrong with the sum of us
That I can't seem to erase
How can I be the only one
Without a smile on my face

[Chorus]

Well now, you're laughing out loud
At just the thought of being alive
And I was wondering
Could I just be you tonight

You show your pain like it really hurts
And I can't even start to feel mine
Well, I'm standing in place
With my head first and I shake, I shake
I see your progress stretched out for miles and miles

[Chorus]

You're laughing out loud
At just the thought of being alive, yeah
And I was wondering
Could I just be you tonight

This is the sound that I make
These are the words I chose
Somehow the right thing to say
Just won't come out
Just won't come out

[Chorus]

And you're laughing out loud
At the thought of being alive
And I was wondering
Could I just be you tonight

And I was wondering
Could I just be you tonight

na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

And I was wondering
na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
And I was wondering
na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Yeah, and I was wondering
na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
I was wondering, yeah
