When i get close to something beautiful
Then i feel low because i know
I'll never have it for too long
I've been everywhere
Im like an institution
I fell down on myself
Just to pray for sweet sunshine

If i fall
Fall

When i get home i swear i'm gonna
Change my ways
And i'll start dancing
Live a little
Live it up these days
I say all the words
But lack a real solution
I tell all my friends
Stick around to see who's right

And if i fall
Fall
Help me if i fall

Help me if i fall
Don't let me go
You just give me the strength
To guide me
Get me my
Get me high
Help me take over this city
Let it go
Don't let it go

Help me if i fall.
