Yes it's true that I believe
I'm weaker than I used to be
I wear my heart out on my sleeve
And I forget the rest of me

Yes there's times I've been afraid
And there's no harm in that I pray
Cuz I'm more frightened everyday
Someone will take the hope I have away

But you gotta give it up
To get off sometimes
You gotta give it up 
To get off sometimes
You gotta give it up
To get off sometimes I know

But you gotta give it up
To get off sometimes
You gotta give it up 
To get off sometimes
You gotta give it up
To get off sometimes I know

All the times I've given in
You fit me like a second skin
And one by one I will begin
To wear you on the days I'm feeling thin

But you gotta give it up
To get off sometimes
You gotta give it up 
To get off sometimes
You gotta give it up
To get off sometimes I know

But you gotta give it up
To get off sometimes
You gotta give it up 
To get off sometimes
You gotta give it up
To get off sometimes I know

You'd better stop, stop, stop 
Using me up
You'd better stop
Cuz I've had enough
And I'm ready to forget the reasons
That keep me here

You'd better stop, stop, stop 
Using me up
You'd better stop
Cuz I've had enough
And I'm ready to forget the reasons
That keep me here
