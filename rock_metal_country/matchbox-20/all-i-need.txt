Everywhere someone's getting over
Everybody cries
And sometimes you can still lose even if you really try
Talking about the dream
Like the dream is over
Talk like that
Won't get you nowhere
Everybody's trusting in the heart
Like the heart don't lie

[Chorus]

And that's all that I need, yeah
Someone else to cling to, yeah
Someone I can lean on 
Until I don't need to 
Just stay all through the night
In the morning let me down
Cause that's all that I need right now

Everywhere someone's getting over
Everybodys life is someone
People still use other people with a crooked smile
And all around the world there's a sinking feeling
Out there right now someone's feeling
Down on themselves and don't know why
Every night

[Chorus]

And that's all that I need, yeah
Someone else to cling to, yeah
Someone I can lean on 
Until I don't need to 
Just stay all through the night, yeah
In the morning let me down
Cause that's all that I need right now

And life ain't no beauty show
We don't know where tomorrow ends
And when we're sad
It's kind of a drag

Just stay all through the night
In the morning let me down
Yeah, cause that's all that I need
Yeah, that's all that I need
Yeah, that's all that I need
That's all that I need right now
Right now
