I will do without
The spaces in between
If you can tell me now
What it means to be

You have been found out
I have been deceived
By the one that I need

[Chorus]

Tell me why you gotta be so cold
How'd you get so high
Why you're keeping me low
You dont know, you don't know
Tell me how we're gonna make it last
You're ready to fly
I'm ready to crash
Don't go, don't go, no

You will go without
A better part of me
There will be no doubt
What this all could mean
You will be found out
I can not believe
In the one that I need

[Chorus]

Tell me why you gotta be so cold
How'd you get so high
Why you're keeping me low
You don't know, you don't know, don't know
And tell me how we're gonna make it last
You're ready to fly
I'm ready to crash
Don't go, don't go away

[Chorus]

Tell me why you gotta be so cold
How'd you get so high
Why you're keeping me low
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know
And tell me how we're gonna make it last
You're ready to fly
I'm ready to crash
Don't go
Yeah, don't go

Tell me why you gotta be so cold
Tell me anything about you I don't know
I don't know by now
Know by now
Tell me how we're gonna make it last
You're ready to fly
I'm ready to crash
Don't go
Yeah, don't go
