I've tried so many times
To tell you how I feel
But you're far too disbelievin'
Are you tryin' to get even with me

Maybe once or twice
I wasn't fair I wasn't nice
But now I've got myself together
When I promise to be better you say

Whoa, I'll believe you when
Whoa, I'll believe you when
Whoa, when everything you say
Don't turn out wrong

I could call you everyday
Give you presents by the score
And I could send you pretty flowers
Have them waitin' at your door

I could write up in the ski
Forgive me, I apologize
Still if I when through every measure
With my promise to be better, you'd say

Whoa, I'll believe you when
Whoa, I'll believe you when
Whoa, when everything you say
Don't turn out wrong

Whoa, I'll believe you when
Whoa, I'll believe you when
Whoa, when everything you say
Don't turn out wrong

There's nothin' you can say that I haven't tried
Nothin' I can do will ever change your mind
Yeah, maybe I'd do better
If I told somebody else

Hell, I can't hear a thing

Whoa, I'll believe you when
Whoa, I'll believe you when
Whoa, when everything you say
Don't turn out wrong

Whoa, I'll believe you when
Whoa, I'll believe you when
Whoa, when everything you say
Don't turn out wrong

Whoa, I'll believe you when
Whoa, I'll believe you when
Whoa, when everything you say
Don't turn out wrong

Oh, and I'll believe you when
Whoa, and I'll believe you when
Whoa, and I'll believe you when
Everything you say don't turn out wrong.
