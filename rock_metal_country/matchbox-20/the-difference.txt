Slow dancing on the boulevard 
In the quiet moments while the city's still dark
Sleepwalking through the summer rain and the tired spaces 
You could hear her name when she was warm and tender
And you held her arms around you
There was nothing but her love and affection
She was crazy for you
Now she's part of something that you lost

[Chorus]

And for all you know
This could be
The difference between what you need
And what you wanna be
Yeah, what you wanna be

Night swimming in her diamond dress
Making small circles move across the surface
Stand watching from the steady shore 
Feeling wide open and waiting for
Something warm and tender
Now she's moving further from you
There was nothing that could make it easy on you
Every step you take reminds you that she's walking wrong

[Chorus]

Yeah, for all you know
This could be
The difference between what you need
And what you want

Every word you never said 
Echoes down your empty hallway
And everything that was your world 
Just came down

Day breaking on the boulevard
Feel the sun warming up your second hand heart
Light swimming right across your face
And you think maybe someday, yeah
Maybe someday

[Chorus]

For all you know
Yeah, this could be
The difference between what you need
And what you want  

Yeah, for all you know
For all you know
Yeah, for all that you know
This is what you wanna be
Girl, what you wanna be
