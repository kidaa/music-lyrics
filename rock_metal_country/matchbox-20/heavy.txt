It's bad enough that we had to learn
The hard way about giving it up
Man I thought that you were joking
And I'm broken

You burn for a little while
Pass it on and try something else
Yeah, you know that you're the one
And you turned on me
'Cause that's the way you heard it was supposed to be

Right away you start thinking about
The wrong things and start giving up
Yeah, you know that we're all quitters
Big sinners

So tell me 'cause I don't understand
Just how to be more to the right
You know, you know that means so much

And you turned on me
Yeah, 'cuz I'm so sick and thin
Do you remember where you were when things were heavy
So go

You could sell me about anything
And I would buy because I like your face
Yeah, you know that I'm a sucker
A little fucker

Tell me it's only me
And I'll tell you it's only you
'Cause only you can make me weak

And you turned on me
Yeah, 'cuz I'm so sick and thin
Do you remember where you were when things were heavy
Were when things were heavy
Love got so heavy
Love got so heavy...

Yeah, I'm sick and thin, thin, thin, thin

It's bad enough that we had to learn
The hard way about giving it up
Man I thought that you were joking
