This old world well 
Don't it make you wanna think damn 
This cold girl well 
Don't she wanna make you scream, damn 

What's the matter girl 
Don't you think I'm good enough 
This old heart's had a whole lot a breakin' down 
She's got all these reasons in her head 

[chorus 1]
All that time she knew if I lied 
You can bet she will 
She's taking her time 'til I thought I would die 
And I can't sit still 

Things got turned 'round 
Don't know where I started from, damn 
Can't eat, can't sleep 
Could have been a bigger man, damn 
What's the matter girl don't you think I'm bright enough 
This old man had a hard time getting here 
You can leave your number at the door 

[chorus 1]

And there's nothing at all 
Yeah there's nothing at all 
Well there's nothing at all 
To make her change her mind 

This old house been quiet since 
You went away, damn 
Mixed up fixed out 
Don't forget who got you here, damn 

What's the matter world 
Don't you see I opened up 
This whole part been played by another man 
I pulled out the reason card instead 

[chorus 1]

[chorus 2]

Says she can find 
The things that make up a life 
I bet she will 
She stays behind, I could stay here all night 
I could stay here until 

Until there's nothing at all 
Yeah there's nothing at all 
Well there's nothing at all 
To make her change her mind
