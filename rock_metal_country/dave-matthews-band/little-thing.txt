Little Thing 

Oh, hello and goodbye 
So fast it's gone 
I can't get your face from my mind 
Can't get your eyes from my 
Can't stop your voices 
On that day you told me directions to where I don't know Now 
It all flew by me 
So all I can do is hope that you 
Come my way 

Oh, and you're nowhere near me 
And wait 
That you'll be there and hope that 
With luck, I'll see you again 

Oh, I didn't get your name 
Nor you mine 
Or the time of day 
But you're stuck on me like a fly on a table 
Oh, I'm waiting here where we stood for just a moment 

And you stole my way 
And I, and I wonder 'will I see you again?' 
And way, way 
Without the smile, the smile that blows away 
The wait is too long 
I want this thing to go on 
And there's no way that I might find you again 
I must walk a while 

I'm all released by mine 
Bump into each other 
It seems so right 
And say "hey, 
Aren't you the, 
Weren't you the, 
Don't you think?" 

But I don't think it's going to happen that way 
I fear you'll remain a dream 
Rain, rain on me, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Your life is burned 
Your life burned into me
