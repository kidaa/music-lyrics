Spoon

Spoon in spoon 
Stirring my coffee 
I thought of you 
And turned to the gate 
And on my way came up with the answers 
I scratched my head 
And the answers were gone 

From hand to hand, 
Wrist to the elbow 
Red blood sand 
Could Dad be God? 
Crosses cross hung out like a wet rag 
Forgive you? Why? 
You hung me out to dry 
And maybe I'm crazy 
But laughing out loud 
Makes the pain pass by 
And maybe you're a little crazy 
But laughing out loud makes it all subside 
Holding, I'm holding 
I'm still falling, 
I'm still falling 

Spoon in spoon 
Stirring my coffee 
I thought of this 
And turned to the gate 
But on my way 
Crack lightning and thunder 
I hid my head 
And the storm slipped away 
Well, maybe I'm crazy 
But laughing out loud 
Makes it all pass by 
And maybe you're a little crazy 
And laughing out loud 
Makes it all alright 

Laughing out loud 

From time to time, 
Minutes and hours 
Some move ahead while 
Some lag behind 
It's like the balloon that 
Rise and then vanish 
This drop of hope 
That falls from his eyes 

Spoon in spoon 
Stirring my coffee 
I think of this 
And turn to go away 
But as I walk 
There're voices behind me saying: 
"Sinners sin, come now and play." 

Laughing out loud... 

The Last Stop Reprise 
Come in from the cold for a while 
Everything will be alright 
Come in from the noise for a time 
Everything will be alright 
Everything will be alright 

For now, goodbye, friend, 
Goodbye.
