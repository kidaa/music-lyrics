Last night, no way

I was gonna be left hungry
and then your daddy caught me sneakin' out your bed.
It's just a game I play
It's just I roll that way
Don't think sweet baby
I'm messing with your head.

I'm a smooth rider baby
You know I just keep moving on,
I don't know why I like to carry on the way I do why

It's just that I'm in love with you

If you see me out there runnin'
And you hear the sheriffs comin'
Your daddy's crazy with that gun in his hand.
If you know they coming for me
And you know they running for me
You know my love won't let them keep me away

I'm a smooth rider baby
You know I just keep moving on,
I don't know I like to carry on the way I do

It's just that I'm in love with you Ahhhh

If you see me out there running
And you If you hear the sheriffs coming
Your daddy's crazy with that gun in his hand.
If you know their coming for me
And you know they running for me
You know my love won't let them keep me away

I'm a smooth rider baby
Oh, I'm a smooth rider baby

Oh, they out there runnin'...
