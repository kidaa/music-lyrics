Mother's Night 

Oh, people killing people 
Kings to conquer kings 
Always in the seeker 
Taking the light 
Away from me 
Death comes to the seeker 
And death comes to the fool 
Death comes to us all one day 
Let the river of time swim over you 
Oh swim over you 
Oh time swim over you 
Mother fighting mother 
Children killing kings and kings and children too 
[ HELP!!! I can't figure this one out ] 
Playin a different tune 
The music binds them ho 
The music binds them all 
The music binds them 
{Ahh another line to figure out!!!] 
Stronger than the chain gang 
Smarter than the song 
Let the music bind them 
Each my face inside here? 
Teach my light to wear a different? 
I have many parents 
I have only one mother too 
Of the open west you waitin' 
Sprung me unto you 
Sprung me unto you 
That sprung me unto you 
I have many fathers 
But only one mother 
Sprung beyond emotion 
That sprung me unto you 
So I bring a word 
So I bring a word here 
So lights out away 
Death comes to the seeker 
Well death come to the fool yes he do 
Death come to us all one day 
Sit back and let the river of time run over you 
Oh and mother make them... 
Rhythm is the one I climb as 
The heartbeat of the time is beating on us 
Speaking of the time is beating on us 
Snap up the gate shut on yourself 
Snap up the gate shut on yourself 
Snap up the gate shut on yourself 
Snap up the gate shut on yourself 
Snap up the gate shut on yourself 
Snap up the gate shut on yourself 
Oh yeah 
Oh I was dreaming 
Oh...??? 
Some people locked in cages 
With the keys on the inside 
With the keys on the inside 
Ahhh well aww too bad ......[don't know] 
King to King oh many colors 
Paint the songs that roll to smother everyone 
Black as night oh black as night 
[don't know???] 
If you are in the corner 
Locked in the shadow 
Don't try to cast your shadow 
On the bear upon your [don't know] 
Just step out into the light 
Yes and let the sun shine bright on you 
Just step out into the light 
Yes and let the sun shine bright on you 
All these changes happen with changes 
One day has a good king 
One day has a bad king 
All the same in time 
Be your own king
