Two Step 

Say, my love, I came to you with best intentions 
You laid down and gave to me just what I'm seeking 
Say, love, you drive me to distraction 

Oh, Helena, do you believe that we might last a thousand years 
Or more if not for this, 
Our flesh and blood 
It ties you and me right up 
Tie me down 

Celebrate we will 
Because life is short but sweet for certain 
We're climbing two by two 
To be sure these days continue 
Things we cannot change 

Change... oh, I want to change it... 

Hey, Helena, you came to me like wine comes to this mouth 
Grown tired of water all the time 
You quench my heart and, oh, you quench my mind and say: 

Celebrate we will 
'Cause life is short but 
Sweet for certain 
We climb on two by two 
To be sure these days continue 
Things we cannot 
Celebrate we will, you and me 
Climb on two by two, to be sure 
These days continue 
Things we cannot change 

Oh, Helena, I came to you 
With best intentions 
You laid down and gave to me 
Just what I'm seeking 
Say, love, watch me celebrate... 
Celebrate we will 
'Cause life is short 
But sweet for certain 
We climb on two by two 
To be sure these days continue 
Things we cannot change... 
Things we cannot change.
