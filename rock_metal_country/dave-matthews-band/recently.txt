Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy, 
Sunshine almost always makes me high. 

Some people drink, some people don't, 
Some people think, some people won't. 

Some people like to smoke a bowl, some don't, 
Some people do, and some people don't. 

It's okay, because it's meant to be that way... 
Some people do, some people don't. 
Some people do, some people won't. 

Some people do, some people don't. repeat 

Recently I've been 
All of content and dreaming I have been 
'Cause I been lately seeing 
Quite a bit of this woman live on my street 

People stare and we just ignore, 
And we just ignore everything 
People stare and we just ignore them 
And they go away, go away, go away 

She comes to me, 
I watch her drink, 
I watch her comb her hair. 
Both say that we never before have 
Felt as recently 

People stare and we just ignore 
What's the use in hiding out 
She says all the time 
Let their eyes do the worrying 

She and me go to places quiet 
Where we are quite alone 
Kiss and we hold together 
We will be until we done 

People stare and we just ignore 
What's the use in hiding out 
She says all the time 
Let their eyes do the worrying 

Walk and talk, we both do quite well 
And kissing all the time, all the time 
Always looking forward to much more 

So we dance away, and dance around our love all day. 
We do our best to contain this thing inside everyone. So fear we fear and speak to no one else... 

I say, "I will give you water, 
If you will share your wine, 
And I will feed your heart, 
If you promise to feed mine." 
And so we will dance together, 
Until the end of time, 
Until the end of time.
