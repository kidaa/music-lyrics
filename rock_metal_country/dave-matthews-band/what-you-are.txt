I walk into this room
Oh, all eyes on me now
But I do not know the people inside
They look straight through me, these eyes
Seeking more wisdom than I have to give away
Realize, realize what you are...

What you've become,
Just as I have
Are you and I so unalike
I don't hear you
Just as I am
Afraid if we dance we might die
Mock the world
Live safe, say why
Don't you know if you live life
Then you become what you are

The seasons sparing
We're all drifting away
Away from you
I pray for you now

Hoping to God on high
Is like clinging to straws
While drowning, oh
Realize, realize what you are...

What you've become
Just as I have
Are you and I so unalike
I don't hear you
Just as I am
Afraid if we dance we might die
Mock the world
Live safe, say why
Don't you know
When you live life
Then you become what you are

What you are
Is the beast in a lover's arms
What you are
Is the devil in the sweet, sweet kiss
What you are
Is missing a piece
What you are
Is a puzzle to me

What you've become
Just as I have
Are you and I so unalike
I don't hear you
Just as I am
Afraid if we dance we might die
What the world gives to you
Don't you know
When you give life
Then you become what you are

Don't trust me
Trust you...
Up to you...
Trust you...
