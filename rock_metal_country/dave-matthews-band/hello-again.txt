Sinnin' I've done my share of this, still I hope the Lord forgive me my sins
Ten years ago down by the lake, I saw my sweet love - her watery grave
I closed my eyes still see her face, I'd give my soul take back that day

Hello again
Its been too long,
Too long,
Too long,
Hello again
You know you got what it is I want

Anyway I'm gonna take it from you

Hello you know you got what it is I want anyway I know I'm gonna take it from you

Hello
Hello
You know
Hello again

??

Over and over I'm gonna see her face
I like to side my soul together well, man
Over and over I'm gonna see her face blown away on that day, I am

I am a waste of the flesh on my bones
I am a waste of the air in my lungs
Go far from me man go and be safe
The serpent, not God pours through my veins

Here we go

Hello again its been too long, too long, too long, hello again
You know you got what it is I want anyway I'm gonna take it from you
Hello again you know you got it what I want anyway I'm gonna take it from you

Hello, hello
You know
Hello again

Tuck a low __ dock shelter me, but
Over and over I'm gonna see her face

Come at me it likes the devil's skin, man
Over and over I'm gonna see her face blown away on that day, yeah

Hello
You know
Hello
Hello again

You know you got what it is I want anyway

you know, my love, I'm gonna take it from you
Hello
You know
Hello
