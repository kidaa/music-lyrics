Dreamed I Killed God 

Dreamed I killed God, and woke up 
Dreamed I killed God, and woke up 
He's begging, "Please, please, please." 
"No, don't..." 

Dreamed I killed God and woke up 
Time dries, time dries my mind 
Oh, I'll survive, no one can save us 
Talk to myself, talk to my soul 

I want you to follow 
Yes, follow... 
It's only, it's only a dream, only 

Dreamed I killed God and woke up 
He was lying, bleeding, wishing 

It's passing 
It's passing 
Dreamed I killed God 
Dreamed I killed God 
Is he dead? 
And then I dreamt of him
