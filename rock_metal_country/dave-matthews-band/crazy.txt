Crazy

Crazy as I may 
Make my way through this world 
It's for no one but me to share 
What direction I turn in 

'Cause I am the captain of this ship 
Eyes, eyelids, and kissing lips 
The same as it was and should be when you will 
You give 
Roll me back again 
You give 
Roll me away 
You give 
Roll the homes back again 
You give 

The same respect for them that turn and change 
And don't you see the strange way 
That the girl dances away a day 
Even ridiculed display 
Won't stop her feet from moving 

Because I am the captain of this ship 
Eyes, eyelids, and kissing lips 
Just the same as it was away ? 

Maybe it's strange 
I live a lie 
I'm going back again 

Oh, turn back 
The lights from yourself 
And turn the spotlight down 
Or turn it on yourself 

Because you are the captain of this ship 
Eyes, eyelids, and kissing lips 
Just the same as for all 
I reign and waiting to be 

Why should I be hypnotized 
By someone else's lie? 
Why should I 
Oh, take time and pride in 
What someone else believes? 
Oh, tell me go on 
Won't you roll on then maybe you 
You give 
Roll the backside on the wind 
You give 
Roll me away 
You give 
More than ever seen before 
You give 

Say, It may be all I can 
Same as it was 
And made me believe my head, my whole
