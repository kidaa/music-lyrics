The Stone  

I've this creeping  
Suspicion that things here are not as they seem  
Reassure me  
Why do I feel as if I'm in too deep?  
Now I've been praying  
For some way to show them  
I'm not what they see  
Yes, I have done wrong  
But what I did I thought needed be done  
I swear  

Unholy day  
If I leave now I might get away  
Oh, but this weighs on me  
As heavy as stone and as blue as I go  
I was just wondering if you'd come along  
To hold up my head when my head won't hold on  
I'll do the same if the same's what you want  
But if not I'll go  
I will go alone  
I'm a long way  
From that fool's mistake  
And now forever pay  
No, run  
I will run and I'll be ok  
I was just wondering if you'd come along  
To hold up my head when my head won't hold on  
I'll do the same if the same's what you want  
But if not I'll go  
I will go alone  
I go a long way  
To bury the past for I don't want to pay  
Oh, how I wish this  
To turn back the clock and do over again  
I was just wondering if you'd come along  
To hold up my head when my head won't hold on  
I'll do the same if the same's what you want  
But if not I'll go  
I will go alone  

I need so  
To stay in your arms, see you smile, hold you close  
And it weighs on me  
As heavy as stone and a bone chilling cold  
I was just wondering if you'd come along  
Tell me you will. 

Let it all fall down... 
Let it all fall out...
