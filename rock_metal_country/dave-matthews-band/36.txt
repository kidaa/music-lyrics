Honey, honey, come and dance with me 
Honey, honey, come and dance with me 

Oh, I say, oh, look here 
Oh, it's a lovely night 
And I feel fine, I feel alright tonight 
And I see you there 
I remember callin' love 
Facing, oh, sittin' by yourself 
But I don't want to see you blue, no 
I don't want to see you in the corner by yourself 
Come on now, girl, lovely, lovely, lady 
How 'bout you, how 'bout you, how 'bout you 
Come and dance with me? 

Honey, honey, come and dance with me 
Honey, honey, come and dance with me...

Scat lesson

Honey, honey, come and dance with me 
Honey, honey, come and dance with me... 

Honey, honey, come and dance with me 
Honey, honey, come and dance with me... 

Oh, I love tonight 
I must go sit down, take the girl of the night 
To warm you up 
How much time, how much time 
Should I take from the night 
To warm you up? 

Sweet honey, honey, come and dance with me 
Honey, honey, come and dance with me... 

Honey, honey, come and dance with me 
Honey, honey, come and dance with me... 

"The lovely ladies..."
