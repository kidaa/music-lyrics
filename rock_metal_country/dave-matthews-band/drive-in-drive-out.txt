I hear more than I like to...
so I boil my head in a sense of humor...
I laugh at what I cannot change...
I throw it all on the pyre again...go then and do this
I'd do it for you...
when all that I want is so badly to be...
by myself again...
it's going to drive me right out of my brain 

Drive in drive out I'm leaving
Drive in drive out
I'll come back again
Drive in drive out I'm leaving
Drive in drive out 

I don't care if we all turn to waste...
so when I beg...you avoid me...because I smell of dirt... hungry,
hungry boy...you won't leave me all alone...the boy won't go 

Sooner or later we're done
Sooner or later I'm gone
because, because
Sooner or later we're gone
Sooner away 

Ooh, my head is pounding now...god has all but left me behind...
not a sense of worry...I'm going to drive in and drive out again
Drive in drive out I'm leaving
Drive in drive out I'll come
Drive in drive out I'm leaving
Drive in drive out 

I'm over this arrangement...
around here...emptiness
sounded so good...I want to
drive you right into my world 

Drive in drive out I'm leaving
Drive in drive out I'll come
Drive in drive out I'm leaving
Drive in drive out
