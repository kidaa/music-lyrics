I'm mixing up a bunch of magic stuff
A magic mushroom cloud of care
A potion that'll rock, the boat will rock
And make a bomb of love and blow it up

I did it
Do you think I've gone too far
I did it
Guilty as charged
I did it
It was me right or wrong
I did it
Yeah

I never did a single thing that did a single thing
To change the ugly ways of the world
I didn't know it felt so right inside
I didn't know it all
I opened up the curtains
I heard sirens there, the lights flash and crawl
But I did it justice
I just did it for the buzz, oh

It's a nickel or a dime for what I've done
The truth is that I don't really care
For such a lovely crime I'll do the time
You better lock me up I'll do it again

I did it
Do you think I've gone too far
I did it
Guilty as charged
I did it
It was me right or wrong
I did it
Yeah

I never did a single thing that did a single thing
To change the ugly ways of the world
I didn't know it felt so right inside
I didn't know it all
I open up the curtains
I heard sirens there, the lights flash and crawl
But I did it justice
I just did it for us all, you know

All you people are the skewers of our dreams
Like the cat that collared me:

Oh, what I gotta say to you
You got love
Don't turn it down
Turn it loud
Let it build
We got a long way to go
But you, ya gotta start somewhere

Go door to door
Spread the love you got
You got the love
You get what you want
Does it matter where you get it from
I for one
Don't turn my cheek for anyone
Unturn your cheek to give your love
Love to grow

I did it
Do you think I've gone too far
I did it
Guilty as charged
I did it
It was me right or wrong
I did it
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I did it
I told you, I told you I did
I did it
Guilty as charged
I did it
I told you, I told you I did
I did it
Yeah

I never did a single thing that did a single thing
To change the ugly ways of the world
I didn't know it felt so right inside
I didn't know it all
I open up the curtains
I heard sirens there, the lights flash and crawl
But I did it justice
I swear I did it for us all, you know
