Oh my head lay back on the seating 
Been so tired throw away my surrounding
Like the sun and moon take for granted 
Soon we move through the flood and we fade away 
Lie about it 
Cry about it 
We'll be ok 
Lean upon me 
I'll lean upon you 
We'll be ok 
Oh I lay myself at your feet laughing 
Hope mine eye made of the soul choir 
Lean upon me 
I'll lean upon you 
We'll be ok 
Lie about it 
Cry about it 
Soon fade away 
Lie about it 
Cry about it 
We'll be ok 
Lean upon me 
I'll lean upon you 
We'll be ok
