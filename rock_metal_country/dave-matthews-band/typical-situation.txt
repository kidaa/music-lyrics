Typical Situation 

Ten fingers we have each 
Nine planets around the sun repeat 
Eight ball is the last if you triumphant be 
Seven oceans pummel the shores of the sea 

It's a typical situation 
In these typical times 
Too many choices 

Everybody's happy 
Everybody's free 
We'll keep the big door open 
And everyone'll come around 
Why are you different 
Why are you that way 
If you don't step in line 
We'll lock you away 

Six senses keeping 
Five around a sense of self 
Four seasons turn on and turn off 
I can see three corners from this corner 
Two is a perfect number 
But one 

Everybody's happy 
Everybody's free 
We'll keep the big door open 
And everyone'll come around 
Why are you different 
Why are you that way 
If you don't step in line 
We'll lock you away 

It's a typical situation 
In these typical times 
We can't do a thing about it
