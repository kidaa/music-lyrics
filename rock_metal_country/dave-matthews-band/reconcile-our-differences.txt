Reconcile Our Differences 

Oh my dear, 
When I was dreaming, 
I wish you would take your lies elsewhere 
Don't give them to me. 

Oh my friend, 
Old as you are, 
How could I trust you as far 
As I could throw your brother? 

As to you my love, 
My precious baby, 
If I die be sure that you meet me up 
Where I can stay with you. 

Take my flesh, 
And eat it down 
Drink my blood for every pound you can brother. 

We reconcile, our differences, 
When I saw God and the devil walking on and on. 
We reconcile, our different tastes, 
When I saw the devil swimming in the Lord's swimming pool. 

To drink his wine, 
God forgive him, 
Your falling angels doing fine 
He's got you under boards. 

Oh then God, 
This dream may be done, 
How he had given rise to him what would we care. 

If there were no Judas, 
Or there were no devil, 
Where would God and this little boy be now? 
No where I swear. 

Oh it's said, 
When it seems extreme, 
When all we do is reconcile our differences here. 


Bartender 
And if I go, before I'm old 
Oh brother of mine, please don't forget me if I go 
And if I die, before my time 
Oh sweet sister of mine, do not regret me if I die 

Bartender, please fill my glass for me 
With the wine you gave Jesus 
That set Him free after three days down 

Bartender, please fill my glass deep for me 
With the wine you gave Jesus 
That set Him free after three days down 

On bended knees, I pray, Bartender please 
On bended knees, God please 

Oh, and if this gold, should steal my soul away 
Oh mother of mine, please redirect me if this gold... 

Bartender, please fill one up for me 
Of the kind you gave Jesus 
That set Him free after three days down 

On bended knees, I pray, Bartender please 
On bended knees, Bartender please
