Crush

Crazy, how it feels tonight. 
Crazy, how you make it all alright, love. 

Crush me, 
With those things you do 
And I'll do for you 
Anything, too, oh... 

Sitting, smoking, feeling high... 

And in this moment 
Oh, it feels so right... 

Lovely lady, I am at your feet, 
Oh, God, I want you so badly. 
And I wonder this: 
Could tomorrow be so wonderous 
As you lay sleeping? 

Let's go drive 'til morning comes, 
Watch the sunrise and fill our souls up, 
And drink some wine 'till we get drunk. 
Yeah... 

It's crazy, I'm thinking, 
Just knowing that the world is round 
And here I'm dancing on the ground 
Am I right side up or upside down? 
And is this real, or am I dreaming? 

Lovely lady, let me drink you, please. 
Won't spill a drop, no, I promise you 
Lying under this spell you cast on me 
Each moment the more I love you. 

Crush me, come on 
Oh, yeah... 

It's crazy, I'm thinking 
Just knowing that the world is round 
And here I'm dancing on the ground 
Am I right side up or upside down? 
Is this real at all, or am I dreaming? 

Lovely lady, I will treat you sweetly 
Adore you, I mean... 
You Crush me, 
And it's times like these 
When I think that feeling 
I know how I love you. 

Come on, come on, baby... 

It's crazy, I'm thinking 
Just as long as you're around 
And here I'll be dancing on the ground 
Am I right side up or upside down? 
To each other we'll be facing 
My love, my love, 
We'll beat back the pain we've found 
You know I mean to tell you 
All the things I've been thinking 
Deep inside, my friend. 
Each moment the more I love you. 

Crush me, come on, baby... 

So much you have given up 
That I would give you back, again and again. 
Oh, my love, many now hold you, 
But please, please, just let me, always.
