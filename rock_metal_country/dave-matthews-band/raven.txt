What you got what you got in your hand - a father said to son
I got the whole world here Daddy between my fingers and my thumb
Well you take care of it please - it's the only one
Well it would take me a lifetime old man to undo what you've done
To undo what you've done

Oh come on now boy think what would Jesus do
He shake his head like an angry mother - spoke the boy and say I did what I could do
But you take care of it please  it's the only one you got
And it'd take ten lifetimes boy to undo what I've done

Boy shrugged walked away
The man stood and watched as he was leaving 
Boy just walked away 
The man stood alone thinking

One hand is bleeding and the other hand holds a gun
While everything is open everything is shut down, down, down
Begin to ending is really just a go round and round and round
As I stand here - the ground beneath is nothing more than one point of view

What you got what you got in your hand Your secret's safe with me
Well I found the truth friend let me whisper in your ear
Take good care of it please - it's the only one there is
Can I twist it please can I give it just a little twist

Boy shrugged walked away
The man stood and watched as he was leaving
Boy just walked away
The man stood there twisting

One hand is bleeding and the other hand holds a gun
Everything is open now everything is shut down, down, down
No one is holding even if you even if your sure
You never know it all the ground beneath is nothing more than my point of view

Boy shrugged walked away
The man stood and watched as he was leaving
Boy just walked away
The man stood there twisting

One hand is open and the other hand holds the gun
Everything is open now is everything coming down, down, down
No one is hoping even if you even if you know
You never know it all - nothing more than, nothing more than my point of view

Boy shrugged walked away
The man stood and watched as he was leaving 
The man stood there twisting
