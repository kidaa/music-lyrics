Tripping Billies 

We were above 
You were standing underneath us 
We were not yet lovers 
Dragons were smoked 
Bumblebees were stinging us 
I was soon to be crazy 

Eat drink and be merry 
For tomorrow we die 
Eat drink and be merry 
For tomorrow we die 
We're tripping billies 

We're wearing nothing 
Nothing but our shadows 
Shadows falling down on 
The beach sand 
Remembering once out on 
The beaches 
We wore pineapple grass bracelets 

So why would you care 
To get out of this place 
You and me and all our friends 
Such a happy human race 
We're tripping billies 

We are all sitting 
Legs crossed around a fire 
My yellow flame she dances 
Tequila drinking, oh, 
Our minds will wander 
To wondrous places 

So why would you care 
To get out of this place 
You and me and all our friends 
Such a happy human race 
Eat drink and be merry 
For tomorrow we die 
Eat drink and be merry 
For tomorrow we die
