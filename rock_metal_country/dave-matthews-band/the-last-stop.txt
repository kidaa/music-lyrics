The Last Stop 

Fire 
The sun is well asleep 
The moon is high above 
But fire grows from the East 
And how is this 
Hate so deep? 
Lead us all so blindly, killing, killing 
Fools are we 
If hate's the gate to peace 
This is the last stop. 

For raining tears... 

War 
The only way to peace 
Well, I don't fall for that 
Raining tears 
You're righteous, so righteous... 
You're always so right 
Go ahead and dream 
Go ahead believe that you are the chosen one. 

Raining tears... 

Oh no 
Gracious even God 
Bloodied on the cross 
Your sins are washed enough 
A mother's cry: 
"Is hate so deep 
Must my baby's bones 
This hungry fire feed?" 
Smoke clouds roll in 
The symphony of death 
This is the last stop. 

Scream 
Right is wrong now 
Ha, shut up you big lie 
This black and white lie 
You comb your hair to hide 
Your lying eyes 
You're righteous, so righteous... 
You're always so right 
But why your lie 
Go ahead and dream 
Go ahead believe that you are the chosen one 
This is the best stop. 

Here there's always blowing up 
And I hope that we can break it down 
So it's not so black and white 
This is the last stop. 

Here there's more than showing us 
And I hope that we can break it down 
So it's not so black and white 
Black and white 
You're righteous, you're righteous... 
You're always so right 
And there you are nailing a good tree 
And then say forgive me, forgive me 
Go ahead and dream 
Go ahead believe that you are the chosen one 

This is the last stop... 

Here there is more than growing up 
And I hope that we can break it back 
It's not so black and white 
So right...
