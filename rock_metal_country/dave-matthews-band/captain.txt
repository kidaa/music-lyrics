Crazy as I may make my way through this world
It's for no one but me to say what direction I shall turn
I am the captain of this ship
Curious hands and fingertips
Day after day how I long for you my love how I long

Strange but it seems like there's a mutiny brewing inside me
But I don't want your pity only the promise that you'll stay with me tonight
Now I am the captain of this ship
Curious hands and fingertips 
Day after day oh how I long for you like crazy

Oh our love - how you do me
Oh my love - come now lets go again
Oh our love - everything
Oh won't play with me again got all night

Same old song won't you come stay all my life after all
Oh how could I even try to fight after falling into your arms
Oh mesmerized by your smile the way it lights up under your eyes
Oh how could I even try love won't you stay with me

Oh our love - how you do me
Oh my love - come now lets go again
Oh our love - everything
Oh won't play with me again we got all night

The same old song
Won't you come dance with me my love after all
