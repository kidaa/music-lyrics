Hello again
Seem like forever between now and then
You look the same
I mean you look different but you haven't changed

Funny to think how the time gets away
Funny how you take me right back again
Stole me away
First time I saw you, you did me that way
What should I say?
I saw you laughin' and I was afraid that I'd get in the way

I did not think I would see you again
So how have you been?
Do you remember, lose everything

Funny I think how the time gets away
Funny how you take me right back again

Stole me away
First time I saw you, you did me that way
What should I say?
Saw you there dancin' but I was afraid I might get in the way

I did not think I would see you again

Funny to think how the time gets away
Funny how you take me right back again
Funny the feeling when forever ends
Stole me away
First time I saw you, you did me that way
What should I say?
I saw you there dancin', well I was afraid I might get in the way

Never thought I would see you again
How have you been?
Been watchin' the years as they trickle away

It's everything, how time gets away
Funny how you take me right back again
Steal me away

It's like the first time I saw you, you do me that way
What should I say?
See you here standin', and I am afraid I might get in the way

I never thought I would see you again
How have you been?
Do you remember I mean everything?

You steal me away
Like the first time I saw you, you do me that way
What can I say?
That's you here standin', well I am afraid I might get in your way.
