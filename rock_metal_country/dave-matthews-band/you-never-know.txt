Sitting still as stone watching - watching
People walking by you wondering why
No one ever stops to talk or thinks about it  if they ever did
What if God shuffled by

One day we might see 
Doing not a thing
Breathing just to breathe
We might find some reason

But rushing around seems what's wrong with the world
Don't lose the dreams inside your head
They'll only be there til you're dead
Dream

Lying on the roof counting
The stars that fill the sky I wonder if
Someone in the heavens looking back down on me  I'll never know
So much space to believe

Funny when you're small
The moon follows the car
There's no one but you see
Hey, the moon is chasing me

I worried if I looked away she'd be gone
Don't lose the dreams inside your head
They'll only be there til you're dead
Dream

Walking through the wood
No cares in the world
The world has come to play
She's all mine just for a day

There's not a moment to lose in the game
Don't let the troubles in your head
Steal too much time you'll soon be dead
So play

All fall down
It won't be so long now
Out of the darkness comes light like a flash
You think you can you think you can
Sometimes that is the problem
Dream little darling dream

Spinning on the wind
The leaf fell from the limb

But everyday should be a good day to die
Oh all fall down
It won't be too long now
Every fire dies
I find it hard to explain how I got here
I think I can I think I can
Then again I will falter
Dream little darling dream

Spinning on the wind
The leaf fell from the limb
