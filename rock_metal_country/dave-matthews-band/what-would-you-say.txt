What Would You Say 

Up and down the puppies' hair 
Fleas and ticks jump everywhere 
'Cause of original sin 

Down the hill fell Jack and Jill 
And you came tumbling after 
'Cause of original sin 

Rip away the tears 
Drink a hope for happy years 
And you may find 
A lifetime's passed you by 

What would you say 
Don't drop the big one 
If you a monkey on a string 
Don't cut my life line 
If you a doggie on a chain 
Don't bite the mailman 
What would you say 

I was there when the bear 
Ate his head, thought it was a candy 
Everyone goes in the end 

Knock knock on the door 
Who's it for, nobody in here 
Look in the mirror my friend 

I don't understand at best 
I cannot speak for all the rest 
But you may find a lifetime's passed you by 

Every dog has its day every day has its way 
Of being forgotten - "Mom, it's my birthday!" 

What would you say 
Dont' drop the big one 
If you a monkey on a string 
Don't cut my life line 
If you a doggie on a chain 
Don't bite the mailman 
What would you say
