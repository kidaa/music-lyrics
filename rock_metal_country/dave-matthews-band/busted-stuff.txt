Not enough,never too much, baby look just like love
Rolling stone gathers no moss but leave a trail of busted stuff
You know she's going to leave my broken heart behind her
I'll take what she's giving up
You know she's going to leave my broken heart behind her
I'll take what she's giving up yeah

Moving to kiss, sweet sugar lips, baby look just like love
Without a care she floats above me, she got me down here looking up
You know she's going to leave my broken heart behind her
I'll take what she's giving up
You know she's going to leave this broken man behind
She's the one for me

When she move, she move so cool got me feel just like a fool
But inside is where the devil rides woman look just like love
You know she's going to leave my broken heart behind her
I'll take what she's giving up
You know she going to leave this broken man behind
She's the one for me

You know she going to leave this broken man behind
