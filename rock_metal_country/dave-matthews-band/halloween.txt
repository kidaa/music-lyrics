Halloween

Oh, little chicken eyes open and staring up at me 
Only two lonely eyes, so rare and raging... 
Wait 'til I come and she would leave you 
Wait 'til I come and she would go 
Wait 'til I come and she would leave you 
Wait 'til I come and she would go 

Watch it man, leave it where you lie 
I come for you, a-lightly 
I suck up into your mind 
We'll leave it all behind 
I silence you to lonely 
I march up into your eyes 

Lonely two chicken eyes 
Open and staring up at me... 
Wait until my momma gonna see me with a you 
Take a good look, momma, gonna see me with a you 
Take a good look, mama, let me tell you well my momma said "Lie..." 

Hey man, watch it where you lie 
I come into your psyche 
You're sleeping - I'm in your mind 
Filled waiting on desire 
I was hoping we'd be lonely 
I suck up into your... 

Why do you run around here? 
'Til I ask why do you run around me? 
'Til I ask why do you run around here? 
'Til I ask why, then, why, then, 
Ask you silly fuck. 

I'm going away... 

Why this lonely, why this lonely, why this lonely love? 
Why this lonely, why this lonely, why this lonely love for me? 
Carry on, carry on, carry on 
Carry on, carry on, carry on 
I will forget 
Tell me are you satisfied with fucking? 

Don't walk away 
Don't walk away 
Don't walk away 

I'm talking to... 
Lovey dove 
Lovey dove 
Lovey dove 

Love him, I'll see you 
Love, love, love 
Love him, I see you 
Love, love, love 
Love him, I see you 

Thank y'all very much. Carter Beauford on the drums, Carter Beauford on the drums, Carter Beauford on the drums, Carter Beauford on the drums!
