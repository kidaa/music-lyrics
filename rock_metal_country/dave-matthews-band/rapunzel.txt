Rapunzel

Ha, open wide 
All so good I'll eat you 
Take me for a ride 
In your sweet delicious, 
Perfect, little mouth 
There upon I linger 
You will have no doubt 
That I'll do my best for you 
I do, love... 

Let's stop to get it going 
Lost myself just thinking 
'Bout the two of us 
From each other drinking 
Begin with the lips 
Fingertips and kissing 
Turn me inside out 
I do my best for you 

Up and down we go 
From the top you push me 
This is such a thrill 
Lost in love and dancing 
Shake your tambourine 
You blow my head open 
Of one thing I'm sure 
I do my best for you 
I do... 

For you I would crawl 
Through the darkest dungeon 
Climb a castle wall 
If you're my Rapunzel 
You let your hair down 
Right in through your window 
Good, they locked the door 
'Cause I do my best for you 

I think the world of you 
All of my heart I do 
Blood through my veins for you 
You alone have all of me 
I give my world to you 
To you I will be true 

Too good to be real 
The smell of something cooking 
My soul you're to steal 
Food of love we're filling 
What you've given me 
For it there is no measure 
Of one thing I know 
I'll give my best for you 

I think the world of you 
All of my heart I do 
Blood through my veins for you 
You alone have all of me 
From you my strength is full 
To carry your burdens, too 
I give my word to you 

Hip lock up so tight 
You know drive me crazy 
Crazy is alright 
With you looking at me 
You make me feel high 
Every single thing you do to me 
Is like I'm drunk 

Given me, given me the shivers
