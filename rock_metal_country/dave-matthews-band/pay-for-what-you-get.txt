Work ourselves, fingers to the bone
Suck the marrow, drain my soul
Pay your dues, and your debts
Pay your respect, everybody tells you
You pay for what you get
You pay for what you get

Everybody asks me how she's doing
Has she really lost her mind
I said, I couldn't tell you
I've lost mine

Words, words, words, have you heard
A bird in hand is much better than,
Any number free to wander
Fly away...stay
You pay for what you get
You pay for what you get

Everybody asks me how she's doing
Since she went away
I said I couldn't tell you
I'm okay, I'm okay
Surprise, surprise you pay for what you get
You pay for what you get

Everybody asks me how she's doing
has she really lost her...

Everybody asks me how she's doing
Since she went away
I said I couldn't tell you I'm okay I'm okay
How are you
You pay for what you get
Pay for what you get..oh..oh...
