Mother Father please explain to me
Why a world so full of mystery
A place so bitter and still so sweet
So beautiful and yet so full of sad sad

Mother Father please explain to me
Why forests march to deserts be
While snow capped mountains melt away
What do we tell our babies
What do we say

Mother father please explain to me
How a man who rocks his child to sleep
Yet pulls the trigger on his brother's heart
He digs a hole right to the middle of a storm of hatred

Mother Father please explain to me
How it could be so this world has come to be
A precious balance in between
Such cruelty and such kindness please please

Mother Father please explain to me
How this world has come to be
Unequalled in her blessings oh I see
Unbridled hatred so extreme please tell me

Mother Father please explain to me
How the world has come to be so
Twisted between time and dreams
Oh Mother Father please explain to me

What's all this talk about
All this talk about it
Spinning down down down down down
All this talk about
All these words without
And nothing done

Mother Father do you know
Why one mans belly overflows
Another sleeps in hungers bed

Mother father please explain to me
How this rare worlds come to be
A place so full of color yet overflowing always
In black and white black and white
Drowning in the waters of our

Mother father please explain to me

Come on out you
Come on out you
Come on out you
We're taking on water
Taking on water
We're taking on water
But we've got the freedom
We've got the freedom

There's no God above
No Hell below
It's here with us
It's up to us
To keep afloat oh

Mother Father please explain to me
How this world has come to be
How we've come to this oh
Mother Father please explain to me
How this world has come to be
