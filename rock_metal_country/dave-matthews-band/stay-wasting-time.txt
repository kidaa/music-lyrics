Stay Wasting Time 

We were walking 
Just the other day 
It was so hot outside 
You could fry an egg. 
Remember you were talking 
I watched as sweat ran down your face 
Reached up and I caught it at your chin 
Licked my fingertips 

We were just wasting time 
Let the hours roll by 
Doing nothing for the fun 
A little taste of the good life 
Whether right or wrong 
Makes us want to stay, stay, stay for awhile 

Then later on the sun began to fade 
Then the clouds rolled over our heads 
And it began to rain 
Oh, we were dancing mouths open 
Splashing tongue taste 
For a moment this good time would never end 
You and me 
You and me 
Just wasting time 
I was kissing you, 
You were kissing me love 
From good day into a moonlight 
Now a night so fine 
Makes us wanna stay, stay, stay, stay for awhile 

Makes you wanna... 
Makes me wanna... 
Don't it make you wanna? 

Wasting time 
I shall miss this thing 
When it all rolls by 
What a day... 
Wanna stay, stay, stay, stay for awhile 

Hey love 
Oh just groping you 
Rolling in the mud 
Stay a while 
Come on love 
Wanna stay, stay, stay, stay for awhile 

Makes me wanna, makes me wanna stay. 

Makes me wanna, makes me wanna stay... don't it? 
Make you wanna stay... don't it?
