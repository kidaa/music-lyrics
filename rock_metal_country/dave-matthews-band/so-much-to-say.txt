So Much to Say 

I say my hell is the closet I'm stuck inside 
Can't see the light 
And my Heaven is a nice house in the sky 
Got central heating and I'm alright 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Can't see the light 
Keep it locked up inside 
Don't talk about it 
Talk about the weather 

Yeah, yeah, yeah... 
Can't see the light 
Open up my head and let me out, little baby 
'Cause here we have been standing for a long, long time 
Treading trodden trails for a long, long time 

I say my hell is the closet I'm stuck inside 
Can't see the light 
And my Heaven is a nice house in the sky 
Got central heating and I'm alright 
'Cause here we have been standing for a long, long time 
Treading trodden trails for a long, long time 

I find sometimes it's easy to be myself 
Sometimes I find it's better to be somebody else 

I see you young and soft, oh little baby 
Little feet, little hands, little feet, little baby 
One year of cryin' and the words creep up inside 
Creep into your mind, yeah 

So much to say 
So much to say... 

'Cause here we have been standing for a long, long time 
Treading trodden trails for a long, long time 

I find sometimes it's easy to be myself 
Sometimes I find it's better to be somebody else 

So much to say 
So much to say... 
Open up my head and let me out, little baby.
