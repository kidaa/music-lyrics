Christmas Song 

She was his girl; he was her boyfriend 
She be his wife; take him as her husband 
A surprise on the way, any day, any day 
One healthy little giggling dribbling baby boy 
The wise men came three made their way 
To shower him with love 
While he lay in the hay 
Shower him with love love love 
Love love love 
Love love is all around 

Not very much of his childhood was known 
Kept his mother Mary worried 
Always out on his own 
He met another Mary for a reasonable fee, less than 
Reputable as known to be 

His heart was full of love love love 
Love love love 
Love love is all around 
When Jesus Christ was nailed to the his tree 
Said "oh, Daddy-o I can see how it all soon will be 
I came to shed a little light on this darkening scene 
Instead I fear I spill the blood of my children all around" 

The blood of our children all around 
The blood of our children all around 
The blood of our children all around 
So the story goes, so I'm told 
The people he knew were 
Less than golden hearted 
Gamblers and robbers 
Drinkers and jokers, all soul searchers 
Like you and me 

Rumors insisited he soon would be 
For his deviations 
Taken into custody by the authorities 
Less informed than he. 
Drinkers and jokers. all soul searchers 
Searching for love love love 
Love love love 
Love love is all around 

Preparations were made 
For his celebration day 
He said "eat this bread and think of it as me 
Drink this wine and dream it will be 
The blood of our children all around 
The blood of our children all around" 
The blood of our children all around 

Father up above, why in all this anger have you fill 
Me up with love 
Fill me love love love 
Love love love 
Love love 
And the blood of our children all around
