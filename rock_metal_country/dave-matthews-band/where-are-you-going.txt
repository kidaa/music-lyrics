Where are you going, with your long face pulling down
Don't hide away, like an ocean
But you can't see, but you can smell
And the sound waves crash down

I am no superman
I have no answers for you
I am no hero, oh that's for sure
But I do know one thing for sure
Is where you are, is where I belong
I do know, where you go, is where I want to be

Where are you going, where do you go
Are you looking for answers, to questions under the stars
If along the way you are growing weary, you can rest with me until a brighter day
It's okay, where are you going, where do you go

I am no superman
I have no answers for you
I am no hero, oh that's for sure
But I do know one thing for sure
Is where you are, is where I belong
I do know, where you go, is where I want to be

Where are you going, where do you go
Are you looking for answers, where do you go

Where are you going
Where do you go
Let's go.
