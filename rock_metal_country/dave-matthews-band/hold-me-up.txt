Hold Me Up 

Hold Me Up 
So I can see you 
Hold me down 
If running's what's got into me 
What cries my name 
I won't set you away 

Oh I'm older 
Still the years give 
And I'll walk into the big line 
And I'll hold me 
And soon I'm in the big door 
And your deceit is growing big ?!? 

Oh, I know 
That you rather be somewhere else 
But I'm not here all alone 
Trying to wish you so 

Hold Me Down 
If I've got the fear 
Hold Me up 
If running's what's gotten into me 
Cause cry as I may 
These tears won't wash you away 
Though I'm older 
I cry like a baby everyday 

Then I come into the big line 
Let it all go out in the wee hours of the morn' 
I'm coming back a chased time ? 
And the fool will leap to bed ? 

Cry as I may 
These tears won't wash you away 

Then I'm -- 
And I'm all facing at an empty room again 
No one's coming to the *something* 
I feel the *something* is rising 
Oh, *something* 

Cry as I may 
These tears won't wash you away.
