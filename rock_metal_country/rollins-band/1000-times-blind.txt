1000 times blind, see me fallin' see me hit the floor
1000 times blind, see me fallin' see me lose my mind

Don't touch me you'll touch yourself
Don't find me you'll lose yourself
Don't love me you'll hate yourself
Don't hold me you'll drop yourself
Yeah! 1000 times blind, see me throw myself to the floor
1000 faces lookin' back at you
1000 times blind
I reach inside I can't feel myself
I open my eyes I can't see myself
I scream out loud I can't hear myself
I try to recognize I don't know myself
Yeah!
1000 times blind, I get cutoff from myself
Smashed up, cut up, 1000 pieces
1000 times blind...
