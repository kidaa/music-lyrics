you reached out, you got burned, 
made tough by the lessons you learned
you never thought they could be so mean,
be so hard and cause you so much pain
like a fool you tried again, you really wanted to be their friend
but looking back you see they just wasted your time X3
self loathing, the anger inside, you covered it up with pride, 
you always found a way to blame it on yourself, 
on yourself, blame it on yourself

looking back you get yourself together...
looking back you get to go on...
looking back you see that you
get to change your mind about yourself and you get to go on...

so mad, so mean, the pain remained unseen
all that time pent up wanting to explode X3
what they did, the things the said, you wished that you were dead
anything not to have to deal with them X3
they made you hate, you couldn't wait to go out 
and do something great
turn around and throw it right back in their face X4

looking back you get yourself together
looking back you see all the hatred inside
now you see that you get to change your mind about yourself
and you get to go on, so go on..!
looking back you see you just wasted your time
buying into the talk and the lies
looking back you see all you've got is yourself
you can tell by the look in their eyes

alien man, I'm an alien man, I'm an alien man, I'm an alien man... yeah!

now you see how you are, the wisdom mixed it with all the scars
go on out and watch all the fools passes souls on by
they never knew, they never do, it was always up to you
you gotta go out and get it for yourself x3
you never were one of them, they could have never been your friends
the best revenge is to always survive yourself X bunch of times
