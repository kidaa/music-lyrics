OH man
I can't believe the things I said to you
hey, I must have been out of my mine
Desperation crept in from all the things I kept in
I am sorry I just couldn't help my self

I could tell by the look in your eyes
that you think I'm a fool, its allright
to late to turn back now

I pull theses lines out
I'm throwing my line out
hoping you'll bite and drag me in with you

I go so low and then I see
its when I hit the bottom
I know for sure
it gets pathetic
when you're lonely
you will do anything

I can't believe what I've become
the things I say and do
loneliness will make you throw you sense away
here I am trying to get through
here I am feeling so small
I'm running my mouth at youI'm feeling strang like a stranger
I'm hear but I know I am out of there
as close as I get is so far away
am I coming off like I am crazy
my lack of breath is to intense
am I telling you more that you want to know

I go so low and then I see
its when I hit the bottom
I know for sure
it gets pathetic
when you're lonely
you will do anything
I mean anything

I go so low and then I see
its when I hit the bottom
I know for sure
it gets pathetic
when you're lonely
you will do anything

OH man
I can't believe the things I said to you
hey, I must have been out of my mind
playing it hard on a Saturday night
I am walking down both those streets
I am looking in through the windows at goodtime shows
my loneliness how it huts and how it shows how it shows
