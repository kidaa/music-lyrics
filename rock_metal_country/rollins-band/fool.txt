I should have seen my end coming from a long way off
my friend said. man, she'll give you the blues so man..
don't get caught but I went right ahead and told myself
a pack of lies and spend night after hammered night
getting back my mind

I am a fool when I need you, I'm a fool to believe
my heart is so wide open, I'm so easy to deceive
I'm a fool, I'll keep believing, I'm a fool, I believe it all
I'm a fool who'll keep on trying and like a fool I will crawl

I waste my time in my mind thinking of you
I am a fool I know
I should be healing myself instead of hurting myself
I am a fool I know, I know, I know
and it hurts to keep learning the same, lessons and pain
I am a fool I know
self mutilation is the only thing that I know, I'm a fool I know
I've seen your front teeth sharpen and I've watched
your muscles fles, you have the kind of eyes
that turn mere mortals into wrecks
I know first hand so well, all the hard times you direct
seduced, rejected, reduced, ejected...again...

you can do anything you want
you all tell your city's calling after you

I am a fool, I know, because it's all I know, I am a fool I know
I know, I know, yeah, I am a fool I know, Yeah
