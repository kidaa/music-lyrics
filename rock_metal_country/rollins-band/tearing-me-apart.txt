The way you look at me is tearing me apart
And the way  I let you feel is tearing me apart
I think as we do it, do it to eachother, it's tearing us apart
Look at you and me - tearing eachother apart
I don't mean to do it, you don't mean to do it
So we better stop it now, because we're tearing eachother apart

Tearing me apart
Tearing you apart
Tearing us apart

It's hard to be alone, but it's harder to be with you
But you know that I'm a liar, a liar with your pants on fire,
Tearing you apart
Slam down the phone right in your face, tearing myself apart
So close, too close, not close enough
Tearing eachother apart
When I see you I wanna tell you but then I lose the words
And it tears me apart

Better walk away, better walk away, better walk away
Before you cry away
Well I've got a hole inside and I keep it deep inside
Deep inside and in there I'm gonna hide
I've gotta get away to see if I'm okay
I've gotta get away to see if I'm okay
Sometimes things don't work out, sometimes things don't work out
Sometimes things don't work out, sometimes things don't work out
And it tears me apart
