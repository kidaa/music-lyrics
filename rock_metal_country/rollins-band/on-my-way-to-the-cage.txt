on my way to the cage
I am getting taught a lesson
on my way to the cage
I am choking on the medicine
on my way to the cage
I am stepping hard on four leaf clovers
on my way to the cage
I'm learning the same thing over and over

on my way to the cage
the taste of blood is in my mouth
on my way to the cage
the fear is in their eyes
on my way to the cage
my animal blood is pure
on my way to the cage
no regrets and no last words

on my way to the cage
I heard the crowd roar
those of you alone behind me
I couldn't ask for more
the lights are almost blinding
come closer
tears open my eyes
and fear me and fear me

your soul is on a leash
your mind is on a string
your world's inside my fist
you put yourself above me
but there's something that you missed

you'll always say you'll hate me
but you'll watch me anyway
its a pain
you can't resiston my way to the cage
I'm looking at life
and laughing at death
on my way to the cage
I'm tripping on pain and feeling fine
on my way to the cage
you're paying your price and I'm paying mine
on my way to the cage
I'm watching you cry and wave good-bye

on my way to the cage
I heard the crowd roar
those of you alone behind me
I couldn't ask for more
the lights are almost blinding
come closer
tears open my eyes
and fear me and fear me

your soul is on a leash
your mind is on a string
your world's inside my fist
you put yourself above me
but there's something that you missed

you'll always say you'll hate me
but you'll watch me anyway
its a pain
you can't resist
