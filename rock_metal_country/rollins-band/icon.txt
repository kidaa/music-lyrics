all eyes turned up to the hero, charismatic icon animal man
lyrical visionary caught in the spotlight
the more you make the more you get it right, right?

oh nothing can stop you and no one can bring you down
don't give a thought to tomorrow 'cause you're the man right now

it doesn't matter what you say 'cause they always find
some meaning in it anyway, so you make them feel like
they're a part of some big event
they'll be too busy cheering to wonder where your talent went

oh they really hate you, they got to have you
you're the only 1 who understands

slender Messiah, God with a song, turned out wreck
who stuck 'round too long
targic hero coming down hard
the jokes on you, you got played like a deck of cards

you're paying the priceof the fame
cruch under the wight of the flames X2 yeah solo

feel the backlash, watch the tables turn
now you need them, see that fire burn

all eyes turned up to the hero, warned out self-abusive circus freak
that one thing that you might not know. there'll be another Messiah
right here next week
