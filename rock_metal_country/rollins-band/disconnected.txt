don't like to think too much, it makes me think too much,
it keeps my mid on my mind
don't wanna see too much, it makes me see to much
sometimes I'd rather be blind

all the things that they're saying & doing
when they pass me by it just fills me up with noise
it overloads me
I wanna disconnected myself
pull my brains damn out, unplug myself
I want nothing right now, I want to pull it out

yeah, I want to pull it out, yeah
I wanna break it all down, hey, I wanna pull it out
yeah, yeah, disconnect myself, disconnect myself

a thousand miles an hour going nowhere fast
cluding to the details of your past
talking 'bout your damages and wasting my time
wanna be the king mainstain in line
all the numbers and the colours of the fax
back by the rumours and the figures of the statch
I think I'm gonna download my ind

I wanna pull it out

too damn bad if at the end of the day the only thoughts
in your brain are all the things that they say, what a waste
too damn bad if at the end of the line you got no idea of
what's on your own mind
you got no one to blame but yourself
too much to know, too much to see
if I mean something to you but it's nothing to me

I wanna disconnect myself, pull my brains damn out, unplug myself
I want nothing right now, I want to pull it out
