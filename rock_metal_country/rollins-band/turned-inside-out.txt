Turned inside out for all to see
Turned inside out for all to see
Touch this, feel this
See yourself, see the monster
Feel the beast
Laugh, laugh, laugh out loud
Say Freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak
freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak
Take this

You're a criminal
Could that be you? Could that be you? Could that be you? Could that be you?
Freak, freak, freak, freak, freak
Turned inside out for all to see
Turned inside out for all to see, see, see
See it till your eyes blind you
See it till your eyes blind you, killer, killer, killer
Freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak

Get up get up, get up, get up, get up
Entertain me, entertain me, entertain me, entertain me
Laughing, laughing, laughing, laughing
Turned inside out for all to see
Turned inside out, out, out, out, for all to see
Laughing, laughing, laughing, lauging, as you fall
Ohhhh, you fall
Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?
Freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak
Turned inside out for all to see, for all to see, for all to see
