please let me see the faults that my ego denies me
please don't let me grow so tall that I forget the ground beneath me
don't let me forget that satisfaction has no friends
that glory always fleeting, already gone

I've wasted so much time
I've wasted so much time

I'm trying to get it straight
I'm trying to get it straight
I'm trying to keep it straight in my mind

don't let me think its love when its only just obsession
I spent so many nights punching that wall
so me the difference between decision and denial
I want to know why I ask why

I'm trying to get it straight
I'm trying to get it straight
I'm trying to keep it straight in my mind

I'm trying to keep myself in check
I'm trying to keep myself in check
so tired of regret

let me see confusion for exactly what it is
don't let me make my rage a total regret
allow me to side step my frustration and hostility
and the violence that comes to me so easily to easily
I've wasted so much time
I've wasted so much time

I'm trying to get it straight
I'm trying to get it straight
I'm trying to get it straight in my mind
I'm trying to keep myself together
struggling struggling struggling when did they lose it
