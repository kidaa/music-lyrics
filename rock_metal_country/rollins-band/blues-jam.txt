They always pry
They always want to know why
And then they pull you in
And then you want to die

You'll burn so deep inside
And then it gets on top of you
It won't let you go
Believe me when I tell you
Life will not break your heart
It'll crush itYou never felt so good
You never felt so well
And then you open your heart right up
And say come on in
And then that's when you stop breathing, man
And the bleeding will never end

Heart smasher
Knives in your mind
