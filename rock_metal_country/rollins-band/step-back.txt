you're so fuckin' weak, you disgust me! It's a drag when you bring me 
down
and all the things that you say, no one cares anyway
but then you've gotta deal with me...

you step back! X2
or you fall down!!

I see through the lies to the bottom of your eyes
your fake charisma pulls you through!
and the house of cards that you built on the cheap shot guilt
doesn't mean a fuckin' thing to me!

you step back! X2
or you fall down!!		*solo*

you're pathetic and you're weak, you're a fake and you lie
I'd like to crush you like an insect but I don't wanna do the time
do you really wanna confront me?
do you really wanna deal with me? uh? uh? uh?, no!
I really don't think so!!	*solo*

you step back! X2
or you fall down!!

now. what the fuck is going through your tiny little mind?
I'm gonna show ya how fragile you really are... yah.
yeah! I think I'm gonna fuck with you, I think I'm gonna fuck with you
yeah you, yeah you! yeah you, motherfucker!	*solo*
