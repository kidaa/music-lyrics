It becomes hard to face
It becomes hard to see the face
The face that sees you without flinching
The face that you put on when you're all by yourself
I wear a mask, I wear a mask
The mask is intact
You see no cracks on the outside
I'm smooth, expressionless
You can't read me 
Behind the mask I die over and over
I scream from behind the mask
Now the mask is cracking
My truth comes out, my mask falls to the floor
I see the face that I got
I see myself, ugly, so ugly, it's ugly
