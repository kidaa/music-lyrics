It's hard to get high
And it's hard to get through
And it hard to hear me, but I'm talkin' to you
And you see these hard eyes you know what I mean
And these eyes got hard
Now I can't see
I mean hard, man so good to find
I'm not hard, man, well I am mine
Go! Oh yeah!
I got hard, and I stayed hard
You can't keep me down because I'm hard
I keep movin' because I'm hard
I keep burnin' because I am hard
I'm goin' over not gettin' back
Hard sense makes sense
Go! Aww, talk about death bass
Real pain is what I reach
The real thing is what I came for
I am - because I'm hard
