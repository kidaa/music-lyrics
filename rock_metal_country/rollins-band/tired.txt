I'm so tired of myself
I'm so tired in my sleep
I'm so tired of my lies
I'm so tired of all the secrets I keep
I'm so tired of looking inside myself
Trying to find something 	
I'm tired... so tired...
And I know I need something
Because the grind is just burning me out
And I don't wanna have to hurt one of them
But I'll do it 'cause I'm tired...
Real tired...
I'm so tired of all the things that I hear
I'm tired of the things that I fear
I've never seen the end so clear
And I'm tired... real tired
'cause I know I need something...
Something, wanna just this to keep me sticking around
But I'll do it...	
'cause I'm getting real tired...
'cause I know I need something...
You want just this...
The grind is wearing me down
And I don't wanna kill one of these walking insects
But I'll do it...
