Here it is on the news
someone I know is now someone I knew
I can't believe it happened again

Another mound
Another one down
Pounded by a lion into the ground
My disgust has got no place to go

So sick of saying good-bye again
So sick of saying good-bye again
So sick of saying good-bye again

Rebel in the dirt
what was it worth
I left his grief and so much hurt

so much loss
so much pain
so much sorrow
and so much strain
so much anger
so much rage
no the sadness never fades
you're gone
I'm left to move on

seems like I am saying good-bye again
seems like I am saying good-bye again
seems like I am saying good-bye again
seems like I am saying good-bye

so young
too late
so sad
good-byeso young
too late
so sad
good-bye

so young
too late
so sad
good-bye

Just last week I saw you hanging out
who would have know you had two days to live
I left town and heard that you did to
the difference is I can come back I can come back

So sick of saying good-bye again
So sick of saying good-bye again
So sick of saying good-bye again
So sick of saying good-bye

so young
too late
so sad
good-bye

so young
too late
so sad
good-bye

good-bye
good-bye
good-bye
