I don't step on roaches as they crawl across me floor
And If I saw your body burning in the street,
I'd put you out with gasoline
And when the garbage pile up past my knees, and the rats running free
I'll say we're even
and you'll know its the end of something

touch your fear, don't be afraid
touch your fear, don't be afraid
don't be afraid, don't be afraid, don't be afraid, don't be afraid
it the end of something

And the tears from you eyes that you've cried have dried and there's nothing left to say
and when you've seen that time we spent together meant nothing and you couldn't make me stay
remember me and my eyes and how they saw you
remember me and my voice and what I said
its over
and know there's nothing
oh its the end
the end of something

touch your fear, don't be afraid
touch your fear, don't be afraid
don't be afraid, don't be afraid, don't be afraid,  don't be afraid
it the end of something

its so cold
its the end its the end
its so cold

the laughter's died away, and now I see the joke was on me
the cold winds blowing through my cloths and I've got no one, nothing, no where to go
my flesh is pulling tight across my bones
and I'm thinking, man you'd be better off stoned
but I know, yes I know, oh I know
this is the end of something

touch your fear, don't be afraid
touch your fear, don't be afraid
touch your fear, touch your fear, touch your fear, touch your fear,
it's just the end
of something

its so cold
its the end something
don't be afraid, don't be afraid, don't be afraid, don't be afraid
to touch your fear
