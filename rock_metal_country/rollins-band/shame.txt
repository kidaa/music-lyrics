I wonder if you can see
I wonder if you can tell
I wonder if you see through the mask I wear so well
I'll never let you know what's going on inside me
My shame, locks me down

All the things I wanted to tell you
are all the things I never will
ever time you reached down to me
all I did was put you away
I can't unchain the thing that screams inside me
I hate it, its what I am

It makes me sick a piece of me
Of what I've been and what I've seen
From top to bottom
I am obscene

you smile at me, I smile back
you ask me how I am
I tell you that I am fine
I don't know why I'm so torn up inside my mind, the darkness, it swallows     me hole

It makes me sick a piece of me
Of what I've been and what I've seen
From top to bottom
I am obscene
it stands in my place
it spits in my face
its shame shame
its shame

at least I don't lie
at least I don't lie
I look at myself and say "man you doing just fine, you're doing great"
I'm not liv'in in a lie
not liv'in in a lie

Or am I?

It makes me sick a piece of me
Of what I've been and what I've seen
From top to bottom
I am obscene
it stands in my place
it spits in my face
its shaaaaaaaaaaame

Don' go to deep
don't ask me why
don't try to know me
don't make me lie

I wish I didn't know the things I don't know well
I'm trying to change, but its what I am

It makes me sick a piece of me
Of what I've been and what I've seen
From top to bottom
I am obscene
it stands in my place
it spits in my face
its shame shame
its shame shame

Not liven in a lie
am I?
I'm Not liv'in in a lie
am I?
NO
