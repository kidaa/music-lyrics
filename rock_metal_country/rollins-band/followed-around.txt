I'm being followed around again, around and around again
I'm being followed around again, around and around again
I'm being followed around again, around and around again
I'm being followed around again, around and around again

Finding myself in all the dark places
Can't see their eyes, can't make out their faces
Feeling like the only one talking on the telephone line
Tried so hard but I still can't lose my mind

I'm being followed around again, around and around again
I'm being followed around again, around and around again

Self-doubt, put your hands on my shoulder
................ only gets colder
And while you're standing here you're gettin' older
And if you're looking for the end of my eyes, 
come and make them ...., it's right on the corner

I'm being followed around again, around and around again
I'm being followed around again, around and around again     
Lookin in their eyes I see the one I despise, around and around again
Lookin in their eyes I see the one I despise, around and around again

I'm being followed around again, around and around again
I'm being followed around again, around and around again 
I'm being followed around again, around and around again 
I'm being followed around again, around and around again 
I'm being followed around again, around and around again 
Yeah!
I'm being followed around again, around and around again 
I'm being followed around again, around and around again
