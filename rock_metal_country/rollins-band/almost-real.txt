I looked deep into your eyes
Saw men lying broken
Shattered at the bottom of your well
You took their simple affection
Turned it into bad infection
Sent them packing straight to hell
I see what sweats you
Reality threatens you
You can't hide yourself from me
When you see the one that sees through you - It's me

Canine men
Fighting, lying, trying to be the one
That gets to feel your touch
I see them lined up like broken heroes
Spitting out pieces of their broken luck
I guess I've got good sense and hindsight
Because to me it never meant that much
When you see the one that laughs at you - It's me

Wasted time spent thinking about you
You know I've come to hate myself
Smashing my hands against the wall
Trying to forget the foolish way I felt
You're so kind when it serves you well
Your crueltyNo more trying
No more lying
No more messing around with my mind
I'm going, I'm gone

Because now I see you
You must think I'm blind
When you need those arms around you
You won't find my arms around you

When you see the one that sees through you
When you see the one that laughs at you - It's me
