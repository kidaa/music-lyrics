You turned me in and you burned me out
You pulled me in and you locked me out
You ripped your feelings right across my back
You didn't see that I was bleeding
You turned away when I spoke to you
You looked away when I looked right through you
You didn't need to do that to me

When I touched you
Did you feel it?
Did you ever feel anything at all?
Do you ever lie awake at night?
Do you ever think of me?
I've got my arms wrapped around myself
You've got your arms around someone else
I try to tell myself
I'm not downI didn't want it but I got it anyway
I didn't want it and I couldn't get away
I can't deny it
I miss you
Even though it hurts inside
In my dreams I kiss you
I keep a lie alive

I wrack my brain trying to remember
Everything I said to you
I wreck my brain trying to dismember
Any part attached to you
I'm sorry I still feel this pain inside
It shows on my face like a scar
It's something I can't hide
Some people are better left alone
It hurts so much when you have nothing to say
It hurts so much to have to walk away
