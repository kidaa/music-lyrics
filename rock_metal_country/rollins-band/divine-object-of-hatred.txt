they killed me, they've tied my hands with rope 
and now they drag me up the street
a woman is struggling to kick me in my skull, 
if she could she would kill me again...
I can see her teeth shine as she 
kicks at my dirt covered eyes, so blind
oh mother! they hate me so much, 
the hatred's real! and now it's mine...

they sit below me, stare up and scream out threats- at my nakedness
their tongues are hanging from out of their mouths, 
I hope they don't tear me
...limb from limb
so much noise, so much hatred, so much violence... they love me!
they'd kill to have me... they'd have to kill me! 
Their hatred's pure, I am divine!

you do things to me that you never thought ya would!

I am divine!
