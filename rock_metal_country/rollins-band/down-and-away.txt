Well I close my eyes and I look inside
Well I realize I'm a bad case
Well I'm at the last place that I wanna be
I open my eyes and I wanna get away
Push me, Pull me, ... ... ... and I wanna run, I wanna hide
And I can't get away, I can't get away

And I can't get in, I can't get out
I can't get to myself, so I can't get to you
And I can't get close when I get close to you
And I can't get through myself so I can't get to you

There's an ego followin' the way I feel
The closer I get, the farther away I feel
I can't get in and I can't get out
Why don't you touch me so I can feel it
I want you to touch me so I can feel it
I'm dead as I look to your eyes
I'm a prisoner trapped in life
I am the loser in the game I play
I am the garbage that I throw away
I'm alone in the place I stay
And I can't understand why I can't get in and I can't get out

The closer I get the farther away you feel
The closer you get the farther away I feel
The closer I get the farther away you feel
The closer you get the farther away I feel

I can't get close, I can't get close, I can't, I can't get it
I can't get close to you

I've got thrown in a hole
Down and away, down, down, down, down and away
Down and away, away, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
down, down, down 
Away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down and away
Down, down, down and away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away,
away, away, away, away, away
