I don't need no friends to tell me who my friends are
I don't need some pig to tell me what the rules are
See me walkin' I'm loaded
See me walkin' I'm loaded
I've got an ear for every sound
I've got an ear down to the ground
These blues come down
These blues come down
The streets are burnin'
The years are turnin'
The sky is falling down
The line has been drawn
Been pushed too far
Been pushed too hard
Knocked down, knocked down, no, no, no, break it
I don't need your lovin'
I don't want your beauty
I go back in my head, I go ugly in my head
This home is loaded, it's ugly
This lonely ghetto, it's ugly
See him walkin' with a gun in his hand
See I'm walkin' with a gun in my hand
See him walkin' with a gun in my heart
Loaded, ugly, loaded, ugly, loaded, ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly...
