I like you, but I don't like you
I want you, but I don't want you
I need you, but I don't need you
I am one time, I am right now, I am what's left, I am right now
I touched you, but I don't touch you
I feel you, but I don't feel you
I know you, but I don't know you
I am one time, I am right here, I am what's keft, I am right here
I remain burned beyond recognition
I remain burned beyond recognition
I like you, but you don't like me
I want you, but you don't want me
I need you, but you don't need me
I am one time, I am right here, I am what's left, I am right now
You touch me, but you don't touch me
You feel me, but you don't feel me
You know me, but you don't know me
I am one time, I am right here, I am what's left, I am right now
I remain burned beyond recognition
I remain burned beyond recognition
I remain burned beyond recognition
I remain burned beyond recognition
