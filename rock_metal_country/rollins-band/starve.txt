I stay out late
I go alone
I needed sleep
I go without
I go along

I go all night
I go all night
I make the colors go
I push my senses out
I push my senses out
I keep my existence lean

I starve starve
I make the colors go
I starve starve
I make the colors go

and hear I am keen eyed my mind is low to the ground
and in my mind real time is mine and I know what I know
I step up and get none
I step up and get none
I take less and less and less and less and less than none

I starve starve
I make the colors go
I starve starve
I make the colors go

at the back of mind I hear the engines whine
at the back of mind I hear the engines whine
go all night go all night
I make my blood scream
I kiss my fear on the mouth
I kiss my fear on the mouth
I make my blood burn

I starve starve
I make the colors go
I starve starve
I make the blood scream
I make the blood burn

and when I step up I get up all the way
and when I step up I get off all the way
when turn my back and walk away
I never come back
I go without I feel the cold but I never come back
I go loooooong
I am goooooone

I starve starve
I make the colors go
I starve starve
I make the blood scream I make the blood burn
