when I close my eyes
all I see are visions of you
and when I open my eyes
your absence pulls me down
and I try to but I can't shake myself loose

I can't command my brain
all I do is shrink and think of one thing
I am sitting alone beside me
I'm digging a hole inside myself

all I want is world I think I found
when I look in to your eyes
all I know is that I am tired of the world around me
please please please don't ignore me

then it came
here I am
thinking of you is everything within me
and I know that you will never feel me
never see me
never know these thoughts of mine
but in my mind you're always there
always smiling and always reaching out for me
the days go on with heart ache
the days go on with emptiness

all I want is to some how matter to you
even if all else rejection
all I know is that I am hammered
from the world around me
please please please don't destroy me
don't destroy me
don't destroy me
don't destroy meall I want is world I think I found
when I look in to your eyes
all I know is that I am tired of the world around me
please please please don't ignore me

and I burn down time
trying to find a way to get through to you
I know I am standing in line for a hand out
it'll never come
but still I don't care

felling like
looking like
naked fear is everything
fear is everything I am

laid out
wide eyed
exposed
unable to forget you

all I want is to some how matter to you
even if all else rejection
all I know is that I am hammered
from the world around me
please please please don't destroy me
