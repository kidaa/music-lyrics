I try
not to let it get above me
don't make me, don't hurt me, don't push me, don't confront me
I try to separate real from unreal
don't make me have to open my eyes
don't make me have to feel

crime likes burning like a heylow
sidewalk under me feet
passing trees below
I keep walking, with nothing in my head
where am I going?, where am I going?, where am I going?, where am I going?

some nights I walk mile after mile, after mile
I need you, I need you, I want to smile, at your smile
are you out there somewhere? waiting? looking for me?
I am falling fast, falling, falling broken
reach out and catch me

and the city is in my blood like a curse
and the people and the noise, only make it worse
and I can't tell you why there's no place I'd rather be
where am I going?, where am I going?, where am I going?, where am I going?

and the city drops on my head
when the city drops on my head
when the city drops on my head

dirty gray dropping rain down in my dreams
no one knows me, no one knows me, no one knows me, no one knows me
so when you see me, just walk on by
I'm caving in and I don't know why
there's got to be more than this
but I just can't find it

I'm wondering in a city, unknown to myself
a stranger to everyone I meet
I'm wasted on insomnia, paranoid to the hilt
where am I going?, where am I going?, where am I going?, where am I going?,

when the city drops on my head
and the city drops on my head
and the city drops on my head
where am I going?
