Somebody cried the death of culture 
Somebody spit in a little boy's face 
Somebody said you robbed my homeland 
Somebody got the wrong impression 
So we came across the water 
From the shores of the isle of green 
Speaking separate tongues 
In the death of culture 
Somebody said you stole my language 
Some people will say anything 
Somebody said you robbed my heritage 
Some people will believe anything 
Somebody said you always spoke English 
Somebody got the wrong impression 
So we came across the water 
From the shores of the isle of green 
Speaking separate tongues 
In the death of culture 
It was the death of culture 
It was the death of culture 
Bhi machree 
Ohin trasna na farraige 
Bhi machree 
Ohin trasna na farraige 
So we came across the water 
From the shores of the isle of green 
So we came across the water 
Speaking separate tongues 
In the death of culture
