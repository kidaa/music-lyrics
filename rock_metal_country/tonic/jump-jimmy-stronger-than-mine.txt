Come on baby walk with me
Come on baby talk with me
Underneath the tree line
Oh
Come on baby lay me down
We don't have to make a sound
Underneath the tree line
Oh 
Sister moon's been shining all day
Nothing but blue skies coming our way
Sister moon's been shining all day
You know what I'm saying

Ooh ooh Sunshine
Ooh ooh Good time
Ooh ooh You're mine
No love is stronger than mine

So come on baby make me see
You're the only one for me
Underneath the tree line
Oh Sister moon's been shining all day
Nothing but blue skys coming our way
Sister moon's been shining all day
You know what I'm saying

[CHORUS]

No love is stronger than mine
Ooh ooh My my
Ooh ooh Good times
Ooh ooh My my
Ooh ooh
