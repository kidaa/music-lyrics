Underneath the weight
Of a heavy sky
I will grow my wings
I will learn to fly

Cause even though my heart is
Big enough to fly away
Underneath the confidence 
I will never say I'm strong enough
To be alone

Do you know do you know
Do you know how it feels to be angry
Do you know how it feels to be hurt
When you live all your life for a moment
Just to prove that you know what it's worth
Do you know

I will show no fear
I won't hide my scars
I will learn to give
I will love what's ours

Cause even though my heart is
Big enough to fly away
Underneath the confidence 
I will never say I'm strong enough
To be alone

Do you know do you know
Do you know how it feels to be angry
Do you know how it feels to be hurt
When you live all your life for a moment
Just to prove that you know what it's worth
Will you trust in a better tomorrow
If you learn to forgive everyday
All the times that you thought could be trusted
In the end they could all fall away

Cause even though my heart is
Big enough to fly away
I am strong enough to be
Alone, alone

Do you know how it feels to be angry
Do you know how it feels to be hurt
When you live all your life for a moment
Just to prove that you know what it's worth
Will you trust 
Will you learn
All the times that you thought you could be trusted
In the end they could all fall away
