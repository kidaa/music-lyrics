Hey people, looking out the window at the city below
Hey people, looking out the window, full of fun and sorrow
Hey people, looking out the window at the city below
Hey people, looking out the window, you'll be gone tomorrow

The rollercoaster ride
The rollercoaster ride
Of all the trouble kept her inside

Take Judy, with her bow and arrow, she's a mastermind
Too frumpy for the teenage population of her time
Car coat, she has a quilted jacket with a hood if it rains
Big pockets for the pharmaceuticals she takes to fix her brain

The rollercoaster ride
The rollercoaster ride
Of all the trouble kept her inside
Of all the trouble kept her inside

A puzzle, for the moment settle down to do it with him
You're happy cause your cosy and the rain comes rattling in
It tickles, and it's something that is very good for the skin
You're waiting for a baby, Baby, watch the idiot running

Refrain

You're hanging from the balcony upon the riverboat glass 
You're watching with your mouth wide open for the top of the class
She came on with the boys while you were stuck in various poses 
If you were to remove your clothes d'you think the singer would notice?

Refrain
