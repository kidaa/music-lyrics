Seymour Stein- I've been lonely
I caught a glimpse of someones face
It was mine and I'd been crying

Half a world away
Ticket for a plane
Record company man
I won't be coming to dinner

My thoughts are far away
I'm working on that day
North Country girl
1 think she's going to stay

Promises of fame, promises of fortune
LA to New York- San Francisco back to Boston
Has he ever seen Dundee?
Won't he hire a limousine?
Seymour bring her back to me

Instrumental

I heard dinner went well
You liked Chris's jacket
He reminded you of Johnny
Before he went Electronic

Seymour Stein- sorry I missed you
Have a nice flight home
It's a good day for flying
