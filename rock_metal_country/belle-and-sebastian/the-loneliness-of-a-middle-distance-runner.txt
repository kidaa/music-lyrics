I'll take a second of the day to think about the things that we have done this 
year 
The dog lies down, the pouring rain, I'm underneath the smokers' railway arch 
again 
The future's looking colourful 
It's the colour of blood, chaos and corruption of a happy soul 
A happy soul will ride in the field 
Ride in the field 
Ride in the field 
'Til the rain dies down. 

The railway ticket states the destination but it doesn't mean that we will show 
There's a fork upon the line, we'll pay the guard to switch the sign, off we go 
The future's looking wonderful 
It's the wonder of the businessman's conspiracy to sell you wares, no one cares 
Oh, you care I know 
You care I know 
You care I know 
I forgot for a while

On a sulky afternoon spent in dispute you'll give yourself a headache, yeah 
So I spend the day in stories and in dreaming of the time when we're on stage 

Have you seen the loneliness of a middle distance runner, 
When he stops the race and looks around 
I like the stage, I've seen it now ? 
I'll walk to the station 
Walk to the station 
Walk to the station 
Won't you follow me? 

Walk to the station 
Walk to the station 
Walk to the station 
Won't you follow me?
