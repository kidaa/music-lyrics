Mary Jo, sitting alone
Drinking tea, she just got home
She wants, I don't know what you want

Mary Jo, living alone
Drinking gin with the telly on
She wants

The night to follow day and back again
She doesn't want to sleep
Well who could blame her if she wants?
The night to follow day and back again
She doesn't want to sleep
Well who could blame her, if she sleeps?
Well who could blame her, if she sleeps?
Well who could blame her, if she's sleeping?

Mary Jo, back with yourself
For company, keep telling yourself you're young
It'll happen soon

Mary Jo, no one can see
What you've been through
Now you've got love to burn

It's someone else's turn to go through Hell
Now you can see them come from twenty yards
Yeah you can tell
It's someone else's turn to take a fall
And now you are the one who's strong enough to help them
The one who's strong enough to help them
The one who's strong enough to help them all

Mary Jo, you're looking thin
You're reading a book,  The State I Am In 
But oh, it doesn't help at all
What you want is a cigarette
And a thespian with a caravanette in Hull

Because life is never dull in your dreams
A pity that it never seems to work the way you see it
Life is never dull in your dreams
A sorry tale of action and the men you left for
Women, and the men you left for
Intrigue, and the men you left for dead
