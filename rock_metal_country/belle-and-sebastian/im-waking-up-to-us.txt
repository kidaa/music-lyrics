I need someone to take some joy in something I do
You need a man who's either rich or losing a screw
You know I love you here's the irony
You're going to walk away intact
I think you never liked me anyway
You like yourself and you like
Men to kiss your arse
Expensive clothes
Please stop me there
I think I'm waking up to us
We're a disaster
You don't want to know me
'Cause you move in circles of the brave
Where art defines their lives

She was the one love of my life, and I let her go
And if I look like death today
then please let her know
I never wanted to do harm to her
I only wanted her to see
The beauty of the world surrounding her
But when she opened up her eyes
It's much too late
Our chance has gone
She's with a guy
Who takes the prize for everything I ever showed her
Digging all the fun
Because she's older
I fed her with a spoon
I made her mother smile
I helped the kid survive

She was the one love of my life,
she showed me the road
I loved her dog, her steady gaze, the chapter is closed
I always wanted all the best for her
The best thing was to stay away
She grew up and she left the rest of us
And now the understanding's gone
I haven't changed, how could I?
I'm pretty much the same person
I cannot keep the anger hidden anymore
But lucky for you, you are not around
My anger turns to pity and to love
The season has arrived
