In the board room the quiet man takes a
Second to think what to do
He's out of his seat and he's starting to speak
And he hears his own voice
For years and years he's done nothing but bow down and put up with all their demands
She sits like a viper and offers the clock
Without giving a damn
He takes it

"Honour forbids me but honour be damned
You have whined till you got what you want
I did the work and when things were going badly
You left us to rot"

He locked the door or the boardroom
And turned like the scene from the old country song
Towering over the table he's lost
He is drunk with it all

"You only
Came back to us when we'd turned it around
When we'd rescued your arse from the fire
Your contribution to all that we did was to say 
it was dire"

"Night after day after night I've been working
Despite of you fucking us all
Now I'm going to die I don't care if you cry
Just please leave me alone
And spare your tears from yourself
We've had those till we're sick
You should leave while you still have the chance"

The others were shocked at this shameless disgrace
At the end of an honoured career
He paused in the silence to pull down his tie
And observe the melee
