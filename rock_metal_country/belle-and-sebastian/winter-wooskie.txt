Who's that girl? 
She must be nearly freezing 
Who's that girl? I'll bet 
All that snow makes it hard so see her 
Takes you away to me 

And maybe I'm in love 
Love love, love love 
And maybe that's enough 
That stuff, that stuff 

Made a film 
I made it through the window 
Who's that star I cast? 
All wrapped up in her winter wardrobe 
She hurries by so fast 

And maybe I'm in love 
Love love, love love 
And maybe that's enough 
That stuff, that stuff 

On summer days when the sun shines 
I watch the tape 
And through the snow, through the window 
I watch her wave to me 

Who's that girl? 
She must be nearly freezing
