I could hang about and burn my fingers 
I've been hanging out here waiting for something to start 
You think I'm faultless to a 't' 
My manner set impeccably 
But underneath I am the same as you 

I could dance all night like I'm a soul boy 
But I know I'd rather drag myself across the dance floor 
I feel like dancing on my own 
Where no one knows me, and where I 
Can cause offence just by the way I look 

And when I come to blows 
When I am numbering my foes 
Just hope that you are on my side my dear 

But it's best to finish as it started 
With my face head down just staring at the brown formica 
It's safer not to look around 
I can't hide my feelings from you now 
There's too much love to go around these days 

You say I've got another face 
That's not a fault of mine these days 
I'm honest, brutal and afraid of you
