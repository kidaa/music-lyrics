You're just a baby, baby girl
So kiss me on the cheek and then go off to sleep
You're just a baby, baby girl
So kiss me on the cheek before you know what's sweet
You will be working in the morning
And I won't be there to see you go off you're head
You will be working in the morning
And I won't be there to see you go off you're head

There must be a reason for all the looks we gave
And all the things we never said before
So what's the score?
Cause there must be a reason for all the looks we gave
And all the things we never said before

You're just a baby, baby girl
So kiss me on the cheek before you go to school
You're just a baby, baby girl
So kiss me on the cheek before you know what's cool
You will be crying in the morning
And I won't be there to see you go off you're head
Yeah, you will be crying in the morning
And I won't be there to see you go off you're head

Refrain

You're just a baby, baby girl
So kiss me on the cheek and then go off to sleep
You're just a baby, baby girl
So let go of my hand so we can get some sleep
I will be leaving in the morning
And I won't be there to see you go off you're head
Yeah I will be leaving in the morning
And I won't be there to see you go off you're head
