I went looking for my darling, I went looking for a sign
and I found her in the morning, somewhere in the back of my mind

I'm not what I could be, I need a true love
I went looking and I found one

The wrong girl
The wrong kind
The wrong hand to be holding
The wrong eyes to go searching behind
The wrong dream to have on my mind
