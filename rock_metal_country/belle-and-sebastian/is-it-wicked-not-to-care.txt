Is it wicked not to care when they say that you're mistaken 
Thinking hopes and lots of dreams that aren't there? 
Is it wicked not to care when you've wasted many hours 
Talking endlessly to anyone that's there?

I know the truth awaits me
But still I hesitate because of fear

Skipping tickets making rhymes
Is that all that you believe in?
Wearing rags to make you pretty by design
Rusting armour for effect
It's not fun to watch the rust grow
For it will all be over when you're dead

Counting acts and clutching thoughts 
By the river where the moss grows 
Over rocks the water running all the time
Is it wicked when you smile Even though you feel like crying
Even though you could be sick at any time?

But if there was a sequel
Would you love me as an equal?
Would you love me till I'm dead

Instrumental

If there was a sequel Would you love me like an equal? 
Would you love me till I'm dead 
And if there was a sequel 
Would you love me as an equal?
Would you love me till I'm dead 
Or is there someone else instead?
