I think it's going to be all right 
I think it's going to be just fine 
I think it's going to get much better than before 

I think we're going to see the sun 
I think we're going to have some fun, 
I think we're going walk out through the open door 

And maybe when we wake up in the morning 
Maybe when the darkness starts to fade 
Maybe in a paper boat we'll both just float away 

Underneath the river trees 
Off towards a lazy sea 
Underneath the bridge that carries people home 

Past the church where Jesus saves 
Up and down upon the waves 
Sailing off towards adventures of our own 

Maybe when we wake up in the morning, 
Maybe when the darkness starts to fade 
Maybe in a paper boat we'll both just float away 

Maybe when we wake up in the morning, 
Maybe when the trumpet starts to play 
Maybe in a paper boat we'll both just float away 

Trumpety bit 

I think it's going to be good fun.
