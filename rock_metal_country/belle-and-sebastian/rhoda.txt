Young girl, she's a simple person 
Not as young as she looks 
But whoever is in this day and age 
In this day and age, yeah 

She gives me goosebumps, fits and malaria 
Funny feeling like buying whisky in a whisky bar 
The things she says 
Yeah the the things she says 

And on her arm there's freckles and scars 
Do you know what they are? 
Do you know where they came from? 
Wondering, 'cause she wouldn't tell me 
No she wouldn't tell me, no 

She likes to sing a lot, she likes to play a lot 
But it hurts her so she gave it up for medicinal drugs 
Now she's really happy 
Now she's really happy, yeah 

And she is happy with a fag in her lips 
And a faggot friend 
And a fag in the morning with her Special K 
A ray of sunshine 
A ray of sunshine, yeah 

Well I'm in love with a certain boy 
He's a simple person 
Not as young as he looks 
But whoever is in this day and age

He gives me goosebumps, fits and malaria 
Funny feeling like buying whisky in a whisky bar 
The things he says 
Yeah the things he says 

And on his arms there's freckles and scars 
Do you know what they are? 
Do you know where they came from? 
Wondering, 'cause he wouldn't tell me

He likes to play a lot, he likes to sing a lot 
But it hurts him so he gave it up for medicinal drugs 
Now he's really happy 
Now he's really happy, yeah 

And he is happy with a fag in his lips 
And a faggot friend 
And a fag in the morning with his Special K 
A ray of sunshine 
A ray of sunshine, yeah 

Yeah he fell to Earth in a rainstorm 
I don't care wherever he came from 
'Cause the boy's all right by me 

Yeah she fell to Earth in a rainstorm

'Cause the girl's all right by me, yeah
