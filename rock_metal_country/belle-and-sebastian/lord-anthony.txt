Anthony, bullied at school 
Get your own back now you are cool 
Or are you scared you're bunking off though you're a toff ? 
It's all gone wrong again, you've got Double Maths 

But the teacher's got no control 
The boys all run riot 
"You all stay quiet or you will die" 

Tony, the back of the gym 
Smoke another one, your chances are slim, 
'Cause here they come again 
And they got you on the ground 
You're tasting blood again 
At least it's your own 

When will you realise it doesn't pay 
To be smarter than teachers, smarter than most boys 
"Shut your mouth, start kicking the football" 
Bang on the teeth you are off for a week, boy ? 

You may as well take it in the guts, it could get worse 
Just take it in the guts, it could get worse 
Just take it in the guts, it could get worse 
Just take it in the guts, it could get worse 

Oh but hey, you'll soon be old enough to leave them all 
And without a notion of a care 
You'll leave two fingers in the air 
To linger there 

Tony, you're a bit of a mess 
Melted Tolberone under your dress 
But if the kids could see you they would pass you right by 
Your blue mascara's running over your eye 

Why don't you realise it doesn't pay 
To be smarter than teachers, smarter than most boys 
"Shut your mouth, start kicking the football" 
Bang on the teeth you were off for a week boy ? 

They call you Lord Anthony but hey, it could be worse 
Lord Anthony but hey, it could be worse 
Lord Anthony but hey, it could be worse 
Lord Anthony but hey, it kind of suits you anyway 

You'll soon be old enough to leave them there 
Without a notion of a care 
You'll leave two fingers in the air 
To linger there
