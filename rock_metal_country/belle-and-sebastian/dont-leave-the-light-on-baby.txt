It's been a bloody stupid day
My baby called me up to say
Don't call me love, don't call me
It's not all she said

I truly love her but I know
I'm bad for her, I'm bad and so
At least she may forgive me for my honesty

My friend came back from being abroad
He was rich and I was overawed
His ship came in
I'm standing on the harbour wall

Another friend, the one I love
Turns to me  Have you seen enough? 
 Let's hang about
There's nothing like a sunset 

It's been a bloody stupid day
Don't leave the light on baby
My baby called me up to say
Don't leave the light on baby
I'll see you sometime maybe
Don't leave the light on baby
It finally dawned on me tonight
Best to go down without a fight
I know you will forgive me for my honesty
