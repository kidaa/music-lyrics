I haven't been myself these days according to friends
I tend to lose part of me when my heart's on the mend
I'll be alright it's safe to say
Cause just like your love this is only a phase

Oh, I've been on this road a time or two, it's nothing new
I'll get on my feet and over you
I tell myself that everything will be just fine
I'm just going through a little down-time

Some might think I've gotten caught up in heartache's aftermath
But your memory's taken second to a good book and nice long bath
I must admit it threw me at first
But I'm convinced I'm over the worst

Oh, I've been on this road a time or two, it's nothing new
I'll get on my feet and over you
I tell myself that everything will be just fine
I'm just going through a little down-time

Time is meant to play the part
In taking care of broken hearts

Oh, I've been on this road a time or two, it's nothing new
I'll get on my feet and over you
I tell myself that everything will be just fine
I'm just going through a little down-time

I'm just going through a little down-time
