Billy Joe had a bumper sticker on the back of his beatup Chevrolet
Said this truck eats fords for lunch so I pulled up beside him my new mustang
I was just getting ready to say boy that trucks seen it's last meal
But I was wanting to climb in that Chevy when I saw what was sitting behind that wheel

[Chorus:]
Mornin' sun found a new mustang
Abandoned in a Walmart parking lot
Mud on the seats so don't tell me away
Didn't stop the gossip tongues from waggin'
'Til next day somewhere around 3 o'clock
No tellin' what they're talkin about
What's going 'round
It's too late to worry about that now

Where do men so big and bad learn all them words so sweet and soft
It made my world spin 'round so fast I thought it was gonna sling me off
Red mud on the finders might have gave a clue as to where we'd been
And no one knows just what went on except the moon, me and him

[Repeat chorus]

Now that we come showin' up
Rumors bouncin' off of that truck
Just a let 'em stare at him and me
'Cause I don't care about anything but us

[Repeat chorus]
