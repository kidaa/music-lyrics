Do you want to be a poet and write... 
Do you want to be an actor up in lights 
Do you wanna be a solider -- and fight for love 
Do you want to travel the world 
Do you wanna be a diver for pearls 
Or climb a mountain and touch the clouds above 
Be anyone you want to be 
Bring to life your fantasies 

Chorus: 
I want something in return 
I want you to burn 
Burn for me baby, like a candle in my night
