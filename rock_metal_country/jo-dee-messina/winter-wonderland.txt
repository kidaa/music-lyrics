Over the ground, lies a mantel of white
A heaven of diamonds shine down through the night
Two hearts that are thrilling
In spite of the chilly.... weather

Mmmmhmmm...

Sleigh bells ring, are ya listening?
In the lane snow is glistening
It's a beautiful site
We're happy tonight
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is the new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are ya married?"
We'll say, "No man, but you can do the job while you're in town."

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

Here we go...

Mmmhmm...

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are ya married?"
We'll say, "No man, but you can do the job while you're in town."

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

To face unafraid the plans that we made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland... Yeah...
