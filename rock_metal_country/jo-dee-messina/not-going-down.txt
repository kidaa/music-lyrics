I woke up today with a headache
More bills to pay than a corporation
Hey, when will it end
My mirror says I could use a break
An easy day, some appreciation
Hey how 'bout a friend
When days like these start to fall in on me
I gotta face my reflection and say...hey

[Chorus:]
Been burned by the fire
Been stuck under water
Strung up on a wire and still the world goes around
Been tossed like a free throw
Knocked out when the wind blows
Pull the curtain on the hurtin'
'Cause I'm not going down
I'm not going down no no

Inside of me is the only
Highway that leads to a true freedom
Holding out it's hand
I close my eyes and it's all right
The sun will shine on a new horizon
Just around the bend
Days like these bring out the strength in me
So I can face my reflection and say...

[Repeat chorus]

I still get dizzy and frantic, lonely and paniced
But next time I won't let it beat me, no
I can see clearly, I know who I am
And that's how I know I've begun living

[Repeat chorus out]
