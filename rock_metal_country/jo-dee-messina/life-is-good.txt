I used to think that life was all about the joneses
Trying to find a way to just keep up some how
I had to have it, do it, be it, had to own it
A little secret that I finally figured out

We spend so much time climbing up the ladder
And then we're missing all the things that really matter

[Chorus:]
I've got my two feet on the ground
Breathin' in and breathin' out
Oh yeah
Life is good
I'm gonna grab on to today
Live every minute in the way I know I should
Life is good

I like to move, I like to run, I like to get it done
Or I can stay home on the couch and watch tv
Give me sunshine, give me rain, it makes no diffence to me
It's all the same, all the same to me

Call me simple, call me crazy
I believe that it's all in what we make yah

[Repeat chorus]

Call me simple, call me crazy
I believe that it's all in what we make yah

[Repeat chorus out]
