Everybody wants an easy ride on the merry-go-round that we call life 
Take a drive on cruise control, then you wake to find it's a winding road 
I had my dreams in view when the money ran out and the engine blew 
Hung my tears out to dry, then my dreams fell outta the clear blue sky 
And I, I was walking in the clouds feeling so safe and sound 
'Til something else knocks me down 
Chorus: 
Oh and that's the way it is 
You gotta roll with the punches 
Oh and that's the way it goes 
You gotta bend when the wind blows 
You live, you learn 
You crash, you burn 
And that's the way it is 

One fine day you wake up, completely, hopelessly fallen in love 
He's just what you're looking for, the only problem is that the man's not sure 
Another guy will give you everything, the only problem is you don't feel a thing 
Well I know from experience, nothing's ever gonna make perfect sense 
Oh, one day you get what you want, but it's not what you think, then you get what you need 


Chorus: 
Oh and that's the way it is 
You gotta roll with the punches 
Oh and that's the way it goes 
You gotta bend when the wind blows 
You live, you learn 
You crash, you burn 
And that's the way it is 

Yea 
They say your soul is growing 
But sometimes I feel like throwing something 
And that's they way it is 
You gotta roll with the punches 
And that's they way it goes 
You gotta bend when the wind blows 

Repeat chorus
