I woke up at 5 a.m.
Hearing your voice again
But it was just the TV
Coming from the other room

Your half empty coffee cup
Is sitting right where it was
I almost moved it last night
But it didn't feel right
It's too soon, it's too soon
It still feels like

[Chorus:]
You were just here
You were just holding me
I was alright
I never would have believed
That you'd go away
That you could just disappear
When you were just here

The calendar on the wall
Doesn't miss you at all
It still says you'll be there
With us all on christmas eve

The picture you hung last week
Keeps staring back at me
There we are still laughin'
Like nothin' ever happened
I still feel you in the air
It's not fair, it's not fair

[Repeat chorus]

I reach out and you're not there
But I still feel you everywhere
No matter how much I try
Or how hard I cry
It still feels like

[Repeat chorus]
