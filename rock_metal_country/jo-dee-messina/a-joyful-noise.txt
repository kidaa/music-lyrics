Somethin' 'bout the season
Puts my heart in my throat
Puts a light in my eye
Fills me with hope
There's so many reasons
For the smile on my face
I can't keep from singin'
When I'm feeling this way

Make a joyful noise
Send it out across the sky tonight
Send it racin' through the cool starlight starlight
Let it fall on Heaven's ears

Sing a song of peace
A song of all the gifts that peace can bring
Make a joyful noise and let it ring
For all the world to hear.

Somethin' 'bout December
Gets me thinking of the past
How the child that I was
Grew up so fast
But I still remember getting caught in the thrill
In the magic of the season, and I know I always will

Make a joyful noise
Send it out across the sky tonight
Send it racin' through the cool starlight
Let it fall on Heaven's ears on heaven's ears

Sing a song of peace song of peace
A song of all the gifts that peace can bring
Make a joyful noise and let it ring let it ring
For all the world to hear

Ohhh make a joyful noise
Send it out send it out across the sky tonight tonight
Make a joyful noise and let it ring
For all the world to hear the world to hear
Yeah, just let it ring
For all the world to hear
