I've never been one to believe much in ghosts,
But to tell you the truth now, my mind is not closed.
I've heard there are souls that are lost in between
Somewhere they're goin', and the places they've been.
That sounds a lot like a woman I know,
Her love is long gone, but she will not let go.
Somebody oughtta take her by the hand and tell her,

 Don't be afraid, just walk to the light.
Let go of the past and get on with your life. 
Somebody's waiting out in the night,
Ashes to ashes, walk to the light.

Now I understand that some things can take time,
Especially those of the heart grievin' kind.
But there comes a point you've got to move on ahead,
Read the last rites and bury the dead.
Said she can't make the journey to get past the pain.
She moans in the night and she rattles her chains.
Somebody oughtta take her in their arms and tell her,

 Don't be afraid, just walk to the light.
Let go of the past and get on with your life. 
Somebody's waitin' out in the night,
Ashes to ashes, walk to the light.

Oh, don't be afraid of the choices that you made,
The choices are behind you.
When you give in, the healin' can begin,
Love is gonna find you.

Don't be afraid, just walk to the light.
Let go of the past and get on with your life.
Somebody's waitin' out in the night,
Ashes to ashes,
Oh, oh, don't be afraid just walk to the light,
Let go of the past and get on with your life.
Someone is waiting out in the night,
Ashes to ashes, walk to the light.
Walk to the light.
Walk to the light.
