I'm dreaming tonight of a place I love
Even more than I usually do
And although I know it's a long road back
I promise you...

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the lovelight gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

Mmmhmmhm...

You can count on me...

Presents on the tree...

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the lovelight gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

Ohhh...
If only in my dreams...
Woooo...
