Pick up any morning paper
Turn on the 6 o'clock news
The devil's been so busy lately
That even God must get the blues

A young man lies there in the street
His life gone like it was nothin' to lose
And for the shoes there on his feet
Yes even God must get the blues

When this rain falls down from heaven
It must be the angels cryin'
For all the sorrow in the world tonight

A young girl hides her face in shame
So they can't see it's been battered and bruised
Like she's the one to blame
Yes even God must get the blues

Pick up any evening paper
Turn on the 10 o'clock news
The devil's been so busy lately
That even God must get the blues
Yeah even God must get the blues
