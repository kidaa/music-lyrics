Still thristy
But the well has run dry
I could fill it with tears
But I ain't gonna cry
So hungry for some kind of sign
I look for forgiveness
But there's rage in your eyes
I should've seen it comin'
I should've been warned
Now I'm runnin' from a heartache into a storm

If we don't let it go
Lay down the anger
Let the wild winds blow
If we don't let it go
We're soon to be strangers
If we don't let it go

So clever 
In your choice of words
But the time to talk is over
When no one gets hurts
So crazy
To leave it this way
With so little said
And so much to say
I should've seen it comin'
I should've realize love has a dark side that can't be denied

If we don't let it go
Lay down the anger
Let the wild winds blow
If we don't let it go
We're soon to be strangers
If we don't let it go

We're holdin' on so tight
We're shutting out the lights
On a love we'll never know

If we don't let it go
Lay down the anger
If we don't let it go
Lay down the anger
Let the wild winds blow
If we don't let it go
We're soon to be strangers
If we don't let it go

Lay down the anger
Let the wild winds blow
If we don't let it go
We're soon to be strangers
If we don't let it go

If we don't, if we don't, let it go
