Every week it comes round
With a feel like New Year's Eve
Get dressed, de-stressed, tonight I couldn't care less
Take a look at me

So I put myself together
Paint my lips and lashes on
Cause I know there's someone out there
Wantin' me to come along

It's the night of the week when my dreams hit the street
With boots and blue jeans on
Take a shot at romance, do I stand a chance
Will destiny be good to me
It's the thrill of the kiss that on
Monday I'll miss
When I look back and say
Well, oh my Lord you should have seen me Saturday
Saturday, Oh Saturday Night

Mary's got a Mustang
We all pile in
Downtown, top down, rockin' while we ride around
Let the night begin

I'm just searchin' for a dreamer
Who'll steal my heart away
Strong and shy with I dare you eyes
And a smile who lights the way

It's the night of the week when my dreams hit the street
With boots and blue jeans on
Take a shot at romance, do I stand a chance
Will destiny be good to me
It's the thrill of the kiss that on
Monday I'll miss
When I look back and say
Well, oh my Lord you should have seen me Saturday
Saturday, Oh Saturday Night

Five days out of seven slavin'
I need one that's just for me

It's the thrill of the kiss that on
Monday I'll miss
When I look back and say
Well oh my Lord you should have seen my Saturday
Oh Saturday, Saturday, Saturday,
Oh Saturday night
