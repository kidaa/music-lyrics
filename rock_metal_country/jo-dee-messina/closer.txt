I love the way you look at me
Can't you see
You're the only one that I could ever need?
Can't you feel how much
How much I wanna get
Maybe just a little, just a little bit

Closer
Closer than anything
Don't you wanna be?
Closer
Til there's nothing in between
You and me

I gotta make a secret confession
All I really want is all your affection
Get a little crasy every time we touch
Close as we are, we could get so much

Closer
Closer than anything
Don't you wanna be?
Closer
Til there's nothing in between
You and me

Baby don't you wanna get
Maybe just a little bit
Look into my eyes
Just get hypnotized
One little magic kiss
We could always feel like this
Come on over here and get
Closer

Closer
Closer than anything
Don't you wanna be?
Closer
Til there's nothing in between
You and me

Baby don't you wanna get
Maybe just a little
One little magic kiss
Look into my eyes
Just get hypnotized
Come on over here
