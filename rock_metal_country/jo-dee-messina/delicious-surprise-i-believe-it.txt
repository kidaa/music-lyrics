If I won me the lottery
I'd dance naked in the street
With a top hat full of money
And you'd wanna get to know me
If I won me the lottery

And if I was a movie star
I'd sip honey from a pickle jar
In the back of my limousine
They'd call me an icon
And I'd be lookin' back at you
From the cover of the people magazine

[Bridge:]
I guess it's all for the takin'
I guess it's all yours and mine
My sister says I got to see it and believe it

[Chorus:]
I believe it
I believe it

If I am just an outside
I'm livin' in a trailor with a black and white tv set
If only I was president, yah
You know I'd paint the white house pink
And never have to pay the rent
If only I was president

[Bridge:]
I guess it's all there for the takin'
I think it's all yours and mine
My preacher says I've got to see it and believe it

[Chorus:]
I believe
I won't sleep 'til I've had enough
I believe
Won't sip my wine from no paper cup
I believe
Won't sleep 'til I've had enough
Until I've had enough

Delicious surprise
Now I do believe
Now it's there all the time
Inside I knew it all the time

Got me somethin' to believe in
But all I really want now is
A handful of salvation

[Repeat chorus 2X out]
