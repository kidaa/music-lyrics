Lauralee had a headache, I bet you know the feeling
Bangin' your head all day long against the glass ceiling
Lauralee made her mind up, she had enough
She jumped the fence right there and then to go someplace she's never been

[Chorus:]
She waived the nine to five a big goodbye, she just got tired
Of living someone else's life
She heard the sky is full of stars in Buenos Aires
There gonna says she crazy
Cashing in her ira baby v2 maxin' out her visa, baby
She's gonna start living
It's time to start living
Someone else's life
Someone else's life

Maryanne was a waitress, started out as part-time
Six years on she's in a cocktail apron doing hardtime
Maryanne called her sister said put my stuff in storage
Yah and feed the cat, I don't know when I'm coming back

[Chorus:]
She waived the nine to five a big goodbye, she just got tired
Of living someone else's life
She heard the sky is full of stars in Buenos Aires
There gonna says she crazy
Maxin' out her visa, baby
She's gonna start living
It's time to start living
Someone else's life
Someone else's life

There's a whole new world
Waiting for you girl

[Chorus:]
She waived the nine to five a big goodbye, she just got tired
Of living someone else's life
She heard the sky is full of stars in Buenos Aires
If you're gonna say she's crazy
You better say it in Spanish baby
She's gonna start living
It's time to start living
It's time to start living
Time start living
Someone else's life
Someone else's life
Hey
Someone else's life
