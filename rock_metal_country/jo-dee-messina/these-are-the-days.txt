I wake up to the sunshine out my
window and the passin' sound of a homeless man
Singin' an ol' Cole Porter song
The faucet leaks, the TV's on the blink again
But my restless dreams are still intact
Even though it's takin' way too long
Got a hundred dollars in a coke tin on my shelf
And I'm thinkin' to myself, whoa

These are the days you will remember for the rest of your life
These are the memories you'll pack in a box and pull em out sometimes
So pick your flowers, count the seconds, roll the dice
But baby, don't wait till its too late
Put a smile on your face
These are the days

Outside the people rush to get ahead for checks, promotions and fancy cars
Happiness is just around the bend
Old Mrs. Jones sits out and suns her face, and as I walk by I hear her say
This is as good as it gets
There goes the business suit who owns this whole damn block
His roller coaster never stops
I wanna say to him

These are the days you will remember for the rest of your life
These are the memories you'll pack in a box and pull em out sometimes
So pick your flowers, count the seconds, roll the dice
But baby, don't wait till its too late
Put a smile on your face
These are the days
