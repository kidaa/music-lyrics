He said  I grew up in Wichita
In a Mayberry kind of town 
He never liked overalls
Or haulin' hay 'til sundown
He said he dreamed about L.A.
As he plowed away the day on an old John Deere
I said  Boy let me warn you
In southern California there's some fast trains here 

You're not in Kansas anymore
Can't be too careful that's for sure
City lights will led you on
Morning comes and they'll be gone
So write my number on your wall
You can call me anytime at all
I'm so happy now boy
You're not in Kansas anymore

He said do you know where Carson lives
So we drove up to Malibu
Cruisin' down Sunset Strip
I let him steal a kiss or two
Under the Hollywood sign
I tried to hide a smile as I whispered low
I wanna be the first to tell you
Here we say Rodel, not rodeo

You're not in Kansas anymore
Can't be too careful that's for sure
City lights will led you on
Morning comes and they'll be gone
So write my number on your wall
And call me anytime at all
I'm so happy now boy
You're not in Kansas anymore

I'm so happy now boy
You're not in Kansas anymore
