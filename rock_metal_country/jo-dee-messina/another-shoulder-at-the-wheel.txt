There are times when the winds blow every word I cry back again
And it gets hard, hard as I try to find the strength to even survive
But when I've done all I can do
I can always turn to you

Another shoulder at the wheel to see me through
When the road is long, and the tears are real
When I'm past the poin of giving up
There's nothing like the feel of another shoulder at the wheel

In my path there's stones I could never roll away alone
There are times when I wake and my knees will tremble and shake
But there's someone who cares
And when I need you, you'll be there

Another shoulder at the wheel to see me through
When the road is long, and the tears are real
When I'm past the poin of giving up
There's nothing like the feel of another shoulder at the wheel

Another shoulder at the wheel to see me through
When the road is long, and the tears are real
When I'm past the poin of giving up
There's nothing like the feel of another shoulder at the wheel

Oh another shoulder at the wheel
