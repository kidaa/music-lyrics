I gave you everything I had
Oh but it wasn't enough
It don't seem right to hurt so bad
When all you're giving is love
You wouldn't let me love you
You're just too hard to hold
I gotta break the chains that bind me
So I'm

Gonna take a cab, take a train
Maybe a limousine
Anything to get me out of here
Ain't no way around it
Oh no doubt about it
One thing is clear
Oh there's no time for tears
Oh no

A wall too steep too high to climb
Is protecting your heart
I tried to break through time after time
Oh but it keeps us apart
I've cried enough to know that
It's killing me to stay
I'd rather be alone
Than hurt this way

Gonna take a cab, take a train
Maybe a limousine
Anything to get me out of here
Ain't no way around it
Oh no doubt about it
One thing is clear
Oh there's no time for tears

The time has come
To move ahead
And find what waits for me
Ooh whoa whoa

Gonna take a cab, take a train
Maybe a limousine
Anything to get me out of here
Ain't no way around it
Oh no doubt about it
One thing is clear
Oh there's no time for
No time for, no time for
There's no time for tears
Oh no
No time for tears
Yeah
No time for, no time for tears
No time for tears
Oh no no no no
