Ohhh just hear those sleigh bells jinglin'
Ring-ting-tingling too
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, "Yoo hoo."
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Giddy-up, giddy-up let's go
Let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow

Giddy-up giddy-up its grand
Just holdin your hand
We're gliding along with the song of a wintery fairy land

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

There's a birthday party at the home of Farmer Grey
It'll be the perfect ending to a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop... pop! pop! pop!

There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy
When you pass around the chocolate and the punkin' pie
It'll be nearly like a picture print by Currier and Ives

These wonderful things are the things we remember for all our lives
These wonderful things are the things we remember for all our life
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring-ting-tingling too
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, "Yoo hoo!"
Come on its lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
It's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you, yeah...
