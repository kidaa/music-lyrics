His heart was tougher than a piece of leather
Had a will carved out of stone
He was stallion who had thrown every rider
No woman could seem to hang on
He had always been a fortress
With walls to high to climb
But then again he'd never seen Julie cry

He wasn't lookin for a woman
He was racin' with the wind
But he kinda took to Julie
Cause she kept up with him
Thought he'd out run her like the others
Leave her somewhere down the line
But then again he'd never seen Julie cry

He never thought that love would hit him
Like a train comin' out of the dark
He never thought a friend would hand him the keys to his own heart
He was like a ragin' river
One that's just to rough to ride
But then again he'd never seen Julie cry

But then again he'd never seen Julie cry

Oh how he wanted just to hold her
And wipe away the tears
But she turned him a cold shoulder
Said I've tried lovin' you for years
He didn't know that it was over
He thought he could make it right
But then again he'd never seen Julie cry

He never thought that love would hit him
Like a train comin' out of the dark
He never thought a friend would hand him the keys to his own heart
He was like a ragin' river
Oh one that's just to rough to ride
But then again he'd never seen Julie cry

Oh but then again he'd never seen Julie cry

Ooooooohhh

Until then he'd never seen Julie cry
