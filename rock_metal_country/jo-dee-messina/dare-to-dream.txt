You and me baby, can meet for the weekend
To solidify our plans
We'll follow a jet stream to some place exotic
All in the name of romance...
Cause

We're still young and in love
And we just believe
We can be strong and do anything
If we dare to dream

We'll find a place on a cliff by the ocean
And pay a couple months' rent
I'll sell my paintings down by the boardwalk
So we'll have enough money to spend...

Dare to dream, take it to the extreme
Let your heart and soul lead the way
Live, love, seize the day and
Dare to dream, dare to dream, dare to dream

Don't try to stop us, don't tell us we're crazy
You're only wasting your breath
We're bound and determined to make it all happen
It's just a matter of when
Cause

Dare to dream, take it to the extreme
Let your heart and soul lead the way
Live, love, seize the day and
Dare to dream, dare to dream, dare to dream
