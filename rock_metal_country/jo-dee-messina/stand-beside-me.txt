He left me cryin' late one Sunday night outside of Boulder
He said he had to find himself out on the road
I guess when love goes wrong
You've gotta learn to be strong

So I worked two jobs and I moved three times
I ended up south of Memphis workin' down in Riverside
I may not be so lucky in love
But the one thing I'm sure of

I want a man that stands beside me
Not in front of or behind me
Give me two arms that want to hold me not own me
And I'll give all the love in my heart
Stand beside me
Be true don't tell lies to me
I'm not lookin' for a fantasy
I want a man that who stands beside me

I didn't expect to see him one hot July morning
His hair was longer but his eyes were the same old blue
He said, I've missed you for so long. Oh baby, what can I do
I said, I want a man that stands beside me
Not in front of or behind me
Give me two arms that want to hold me not own me
And I'll give all the love in my heart

It's hard to tell him no when I want him so bad
But I've got to be true to my heart This time

I'm not lookin' for a fantasy
I want a man who stands beside me
I want a man
Who stands beside me
Stand beside me
Stand beside me
