There's a little bitty flame burnin' deep in my heart
You wanna make something of it?
Oh do you feel the same maybe just a little spark
You wanna make something of it?
Do you wanna turn it into somethin' that's a burnin' like a ragin' fire outta control
Well I'm waitin' for you tell me what you wanna do
You wanna make something of it?

There's a little bitty seed growin' deep in my soul
You wanna make something of it?
You got everything it needs just to help it to grow
You wanna make something of it?
Run wild like a vine if you only took the time
To meet me in the garden of love
It be a sweet situation if you had the inclination
Wanna make something of it?

Chorus:
Oh yeah I admit it
I love you yes I do
What you do with it is all up to you
ooooohhhhh yeah

Oh yeah I admit it
I love you yes I do
What you do with it is all up to you

oooooooooohhhh..

There little bitty flame burnin' deep inside my heart
Wanna make something of it?
Oh do you fell the same maybe just a little spark
You wanna make something of it?
Do you wanna turn it into something that burnin' like a ragin fire out of control
Well I'm waitin for you tell me what you wanna do
You wanna make something of it?

Well I'm waiting for you tell me what you wanna do
You wanna make something of it

Well I'm waiting for you tell me what you wanna do
You wanna make something of it?
