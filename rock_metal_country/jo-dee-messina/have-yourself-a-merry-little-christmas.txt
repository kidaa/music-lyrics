Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on our troubles will be out of sight
Mmmmmm...

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the yuletide gay
From now on our troubles will be miles away

Here we are, as in olden days
Happy golden days of your
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest cloud
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Wooo...

Have yourself a merry little Christmas now
