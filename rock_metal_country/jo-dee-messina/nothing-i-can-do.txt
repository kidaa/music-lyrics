Here I am beggin' you to hold me
When everything is tellin' me to run
I could turn around, leave this town
Without a sound and never say word one
And just call it done

But I'm torn right down the middle
I'm on both sides of the line
I know I should be leavin'
But the choice ain't mine

There's nothin' I can do
I can't fight it
I got a heart like a rocket
I just gotta ride it
Oh the cold, hard truth
When it comes to lovin' you
There's nothin' I can do

These footprints on my heart could
Tell a story - many times it's been a steppin' stone
It's been pushed around, broken down, until I found
I was better off alone, out on my own

I remember every heartache, just like it was yesterday
But baby when you hold me, you take all that pain away

There's nothin' I can do
I can't fight it
I got a heart like a rocket
I just gotta ride it
Oh the cold, hard truth
When it comes to lovin' you
There's nothin' I can do

I couldn't help myself from fallin'
Even if I really wanted to

There's nothin' I can do
I can't fight it
I got a heart like a rocket
I just gotta ride it
Oh the cold, hard truth
When it comes to lovin' you
There's nothin' I can do
