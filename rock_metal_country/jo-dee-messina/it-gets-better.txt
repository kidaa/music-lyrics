This old world can be cruel sometimes
When you're looking for answers
You can't seem to find
No one understands what you're going through

Oh I know it can get lonely out there
When you feel like nobody cares
Well you look around thinking
If they only knew
Well I do

[Chorus:]
I've felt the chill of this world cut down to the bone
I've walked many a mile down this road on my own
I've been through hell on my knees
Come face to face with the devil
And I know that it's hard to believe
But it gets better

Time is a healer but we can't see how
When you're caught in the moment
And the hurting is now
We don't wanna see that maybe somethings
Weren't meant to figure out

[Repeat chorus]

This old world can be cruel sometimes
When you're looking for answers
Well just keep in mind
No you're not alone
We're all trying to find our way through this life

[Repeat chorus out]
