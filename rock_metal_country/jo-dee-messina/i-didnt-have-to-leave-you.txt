Remember me
The one who picked up all the pieces, me
The one whos love for you increases everyday
And it won't go away like she did
Remember her
The one who left your heart abandoned, her
Well she's back again and I can't stand it
It hurts 'cause with her tears all glistening
She's got you listening to her promises
Well remember this

I didn't have to leave you to love you
I didn't have to lose you first to want you more than ever
I didn't have to leave you to love you
I didn't have to see if I could tear your world apart
And still win back your heart
I didn't have to leave you to love you
I loved you from the start

You know me
I only want whats best for you and I'd leave
If you really wanted me to
But if I say that I don't want to stay
It would be right
You know her
And she knows how to get to you
Oh the nerve, she's offering her bed to you
And what's worse
Is that she knows you started over
But she still insists that you owe her one more try
Well I knew

I didn't have to leave you to love you
I didn't have to lose you first to want you more than ever
I didn't have to leave you to love you
I didn't have to see if I could tear your world apart
And still win back your heart
I didn't have to leave you to love you
I loved you from the start

I didn't have to leave you to love you
