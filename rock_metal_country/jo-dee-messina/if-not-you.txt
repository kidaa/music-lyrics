I'll admit, I can be hard to please
Now and then I disagree just to disagree
There are times I want what I want cause I want it
There are things I don't know I have when I've got em
But when I look at you I ask myself
How could there be somebody else

If not you - who
Is ever gonna make me happy
If not love - what
Is it I feel for you
If I search the world
Over, under, still I wonder
Who would I be looking for -
yeah, who
If not you

When I'm stuck and feel locked up, you turn the key
You minimize all of my insecurities
You always seem to know what
I need when I need it
And when I say I need only you... believe it
Of all the may mysteries yet to come
I've solved the most important one

If not you - who
Is ever gonna make me happy
If not love - what
Is it I feel for you
If I search the world
Over, under, still I wonder
Who would I be looking for -
yeah, who
If not you

There are times I want what I want cause I want it
There are things I don't know
There are things I don't know
I have when I've got em
But when I look at you I ask myself
How could there be somebody else

If not you - who
Is ever gonna make me happy
If not love - what
Is it I feel for you
If I search the world
Over, under, still I wonder
Who would I be looking for -
yeah, who
If not you

If not you, if not you - who
