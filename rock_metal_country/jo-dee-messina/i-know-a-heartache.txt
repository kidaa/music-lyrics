Look at who the wind's blowin' up the road
Shining like a northern star
Actin' like the answers to all my prayers
But baby, I know what you really are

So don't you knock on my door
I won't be home anymore
You can find me out walking in the sun
Oh you hide it so well
It isn't easy to tell
But I know a heartache when I see one

There was a time I was a true believer
Your love was the only way
Well you can save all your sweet talkin' for some other fool
Only a fool would believe what you say

So don't you knock on my door
I won't be home anymore
You can find me out walking in the sun
Oh, you hide it so well
It isn't easy to tell
But I know a heartache when I see one

Time is a teacher oh and it's taught me well
The loser is the one who cries
And when you've cried like a baby and you've hurt like hell
You know the devil by the look in his eyes

So don't you knock on my door
I won't be home anymore
You can find me out walking in the sun
Oh, you hide it so well
It isn't easy to tell
But I know a heartache when I see one

So don't you knock on my door
I won't be home anymore
You can find me out walking in the sun
Oh, you hide it so well
It isn't easy to tell
But I know a heartache when I see one
I know a heartache when I see one
