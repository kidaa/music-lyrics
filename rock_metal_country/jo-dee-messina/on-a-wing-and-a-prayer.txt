She sits in the dark
Quietly cursing him and this love
While she's rehearsing every line
She's gonna say when she walks away
On a wing and a prayer

Looking back at her in the mirror is a stranger
Years that have passed, how they seemed to change her
A woman once able to stand on her own
Searches for strength to stand on her own
On a wing and a prayer

On a wing and a prayer
She's leaving tonight
Holding her heart in her hands
Somewhere out there she knows that she'll find a love that understands
Why she left there on a wing and a prayer

She held on to maybe as long as she could, knowing he wouldn't
Believeing he would, give her a single reason to stay
To keep her from breaking away on a wing and a prayer

On a wing and a prayer
She's leaving tonight
Holding her heart in her hands
Somewhere out there she knows that she'll find a love that understands
Why she left there on a wing and a prayer

Somewhere out there she knows that she'll find a love that understands
Why she left there on a wing and a prayer
Oh, why she left there on a wing and a prayer
