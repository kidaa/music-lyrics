What child is this who lay to rest
On Mary's lap, is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping?

This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, Haste, to bring him laud
The Babe, the Son of Mary.

So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh
Come peasant, king to own Him
The King of Kings salvation brings
Let loving enthrone Him

This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, Haste, to bring him laud
The Babe, the Son of Mary
The Babe, the Son of Mary
