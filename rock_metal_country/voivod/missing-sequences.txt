Sleeping sky
Winding walk
Breezing by
Ravaged rock
Swarming locust-land
Spiders spinning sand
Grubbing enterprise
No time to reply

Down, down
Far underground
Prime spot
Sound, sound
Ten thousand mounds
Live-stock

Stupendous flaking fume
Tremendous dancing doom
Smoke stack spill
Momentous reeking ooze
Enormous creaking crew
Vapour-ville
Neuro-link dementing
Limbo-Inc. AmnesiaI did, I didn't know
I think, I should go, go!
Bio-atrophy
Doxite double-wind
Forgetful retry
Aphasic clouded cult
Synaptic planet pulse
Lost engram

Ellusive mythic doubt
Reactive spastic pause
Dis-programmed
Which was right
Who knows when
Where was that?
Do I know how
Where to go now
Mother lose out
