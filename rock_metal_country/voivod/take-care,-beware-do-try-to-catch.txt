the eclipse"

obsession, the will to fly
it would be nice
still, a nagging doubtful mind
it will be fine
straight ahead half luna shines
now is the time

here comes darkness
distanced from above
bold emptyness
omniscient fogup on the edge
ready! one, two...go!
rat or angel
does one really know?

the idiot walk along a canvas
