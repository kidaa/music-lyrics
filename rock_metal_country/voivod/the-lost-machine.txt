Lost machine, giant maze
Big engine, cruising space
Ozone years, controlled daze... keeps the engine running

Silver beams, analyze
Robot teams, supervise
That was then, this is now... it must run anyhow

Don't you try, to know why
We can't talk, close that door

My father, remembers
Grand-father, remembers
Patching holes, in the sky... it's running all of the time

I can tell, this is hell
No one talks, no one talks
One day will we understand
How much the future is here right now?
One day will they understand...
How true... the future is here, and how!

Remain silent

Lost machine, never fails
3-D screen, one message
Keep working, generate... it's the same everyday

Don't you try, to know why
I can't talk, close that door

My father gave me a small stone that he received from his father.  This
stone was brought from earth by our early ancestors over 3OO years ago,
since the machine started working.  Our mission... my mission, to reach
central control and throw it into some vital part of the main engine...
and blow the precious generator... I do not want to have to pass this
down to my own son...
