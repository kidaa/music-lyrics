A mistake
Through my veins
Now I ache
I'm in pain
A mistake
All it takes
Now I pray
For a change
Down fall down below
Last call time to go
To the other side
Dark is the last ride
Rotten days
Come ahead
Memories
On a deadbed
Misery
Taking place
Hopeless case
What a waste
Down fall down below
Last call time to go
To the other side
Dark is the last ride
Decay is my foe
Staring as a crow
Picking at my pride
Ruining my last ride
Down below you're on your own
No escape Here I lie
Their mistake
Took my life
Down fall down below
Last call time to go
To the other side
Dark is the last ride
Drifting down below
