He is anark
Can you hear the sound of the phantom bell
People gather around
Burn in his half-world hell
Proto-overman
User of the dead hand
To the tower
He is anark
Screams that calm the wind
Hear the black birds shriek
Death is your last breath
We have one enemy
Proto-overman
User of the dead hand
To the tower
He is anark
Dark dance
Break of dusk
Cold wind
Time to kill
Eyes closed
See his blood
Fear not tomorrow will
Proto-overman
User of the dead hand
