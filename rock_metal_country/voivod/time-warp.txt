What will happen if I can't come back?
What if I should fall between the cracks?

Will I go back and forth down on-line?
Wherever!  It's a question of time

Watching my sand glass
I count to a thousand
I flip it over
A lifetime in my handI set the counter
And switch on the power
Transform my matter
Am I gone forever?

Am I tomorrow or yesterday?
Another second's just passed away
Upcoming present and future past
Am I the first?  Could be the last

Over and under
I spiral down the line
I'm getting closer
I must be right on time
Closer, closer
