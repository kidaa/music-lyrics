all under one command
clouds overcast the land
infinite division
chaotic creation
patterns of flat spiral
spinning a triangle
wind on the schizosphere
nuage fractal appears

out there!

dynamic intruder
mutating whole numbers
systems are compromised
viruses organize
one simple memory
in every theory
all random elements
become determinantsout there lives someone
pirate space kingdom

we get lost
in this chaos
too soon for us
to be in touch

tomorrow we will know
something about the code
salvation's on it's way
in the light of today
cloud of all destiny
ghost of reality
nobody can detect
the butterfly effect
