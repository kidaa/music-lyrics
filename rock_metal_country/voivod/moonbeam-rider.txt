Ride
Ride on
Ride the sunrise
To higher ground

Ride
Ride on
Ride the hog high
You're glory bound

Ride
Ride on
There is no time
You're moving on

Ride
Ride on
There is a sign
Another town

Bad muckin' luck and misery
All is forgotten memories
Trouble and time left way behind
Trouble and time, a thousand crimes
And all the things you will regret
And all the things you can't forget
There's no reason to be ashamed
For your many ill-gotten gainsAnd the Moonbeam shines on the Chrome

Ride
Ride on
Don't you realize
What's going on

Ride 
Ride on
The road to the stars
You're riding on

Did you ever live in this world?
Were you ever within your world?
Ride on and on until you're gone
Do you believe you now are free?
Do you believe you're born to be
The Moonbeam Rider in the sky
The Moonbeam Rider in the sky
