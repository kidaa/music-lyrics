there you are, you're with me
protecting all my crew
I carved you, from a tree
my vision is you
Lorelei, I have thee
in front of my ship
cutting waves, at full speed
savouring the trip

down the mirror of the waterline
leaning over underwater life
hidden treasures of the seven seas

I'm starboard to nowhere
on the milky way
howling wind, salty air
tearing at the sails
looking down the crow's nest
gliding in the sky
without sound, going west
boating on the flybut some day
you'll go home
far away
on your own

dans la mer
you'll go down
go down where
you belong
