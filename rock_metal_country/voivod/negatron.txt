High, some positron
speeding ion
cruising along
low, down inward flow
magnetosphere
negative glow
now, what's going on
Motive, unclear
There's something wrong
Yes, hypnotronik
Polarity
Rising sun
No, guide lining lead
Generator
Breaks over me
So close to the core
Lay down, here comes
The negatron
Maybe plan a-1 should be
to make a b-line out of here
sub-electrosquad
of vagabond
ultra matter
out, get out of here
nucleonik
vacu-vampire
out, get out of here
you magno void
