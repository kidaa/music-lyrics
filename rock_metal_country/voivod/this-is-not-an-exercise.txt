Don't adjust your Brain
It's now, it's real, real, real
Woken up by a lot of noise this morning
The day begins by the fear
I'm looking through the window at this outside
Something's happening
Smashed up cars, fucked up traffic
People plunged in their TV set
Watch to see the daily bad news
Stand to know who's gonna pay

Burning, destroying, pulverising
They can't take the time to realise
Talking, screaming, protesting 
All that time spent
Let's start this bad surpriseBut today is not like another day
Listen to the radio
Caution, all alert is on
They're gonna blow your bones away
You know the human history
The street must be running red
The citizens can't believe
That they're all the victims
And this is it, you better watch it live
I wake you up, this is no an exercise!!
Don't adjust your Brain
It's now, it's real, real, real

You stand mute today
It's all over, shaking the ground
With their foolish toys
Your mind turns to broil
You keep yourself away
It's all over, shaking the ground
Now I change my opinion about you
I can't trust you, not even my friends
Dehumanization and the lost cause
What's the future, it's up to me...
No one's gonna say, that's a crime
Who's gonna say
There is not too much time !!
