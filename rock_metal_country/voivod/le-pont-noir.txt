I'm going to the bridge tonight
Venus shines so ever bright
Deep in the woods under the stars
How did I come to get this far?
Have this feeling...what will I find
Around the corner of my mind?

A thousand trees of creeping sin
Dead leaves blowing in the wind
I'm whistling an old melody
To keep the beast away from me
I hear the call of croaking frogs
Answering me lost in the fog
I tell myself, everything's fine
Here in these woods, for the first time

Uh, ohh!

Out in the dark, a shadow sound
Fear to look, but turn around
I realize I'm face to face
Two yellow eyes, an evil gaze
Ugly blood hound, no wagging tail
How long has he been on my trail?
Down to the bridge, he's leading me
What is it he wants me to see?

Uh, ohh!

Already we've arrived, Here I am
There's the bridge, Where's the man, What a scam!
That story 'bout the bridge isn't true
I'm enjoying myself, what a view!They say the bridge is not what it is

No one ever comes back...so they say
What could happen to me, anyway?
>From away, a tall man comes to me...
Has he been here waiting...just for me?

He says there's no more fishing in the lake
But one thing for sure...I'm the catch of the day!

This is what happens
When one looks for gold
Turn'd into gray stone
And down deep you are thrown!!

All this is over X4
