Living in a daze, beyond belief
Withdrawn from all that I know
Disturbed by darkened thoughts
Of haunting agony, restrain the memorie
Fearing for my life
The government denies their sole existence
But it's much too late for them
Can't wait to see their faces
When they arrive again
Mental impairment, sanity lost, it's vanished away
But all I know, the men in black
Are secret spies, as the tension grows
Deep down inside, I know they're coming for me
For the 2nd time, I'm going, going away
Why am I caught in this conspiracy
Have to find a way
Don't care what it takes
I shall persevere
Tell me why it is this way
One more cosmic watergate
Can't believe it's me, strange captivity
Confused in this maze, no chance to escape
As the end draws near
New technology, high-tech slavery
Horrid state control, truth is far behind
Face the end of time
Tell me why it is this way
One more cosmic watergate
Psychic war, deletion zone
