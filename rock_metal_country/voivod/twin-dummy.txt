dummy says
I have dreams
frightening screams
I have dreams

dummy says
it's too late
big mistake
it's too late

the circus left without me
and I'm alone with you now

dummy says
stay with me
talk to me
stay with me

dummy says
holiday
come and play
holiday

big top
carousel
cotton candywhere am I?

fun house
acrobat
fortune teller

all of me, all fades away

dummy says
my dear friend
here you stand
my right hand

dummy says
'til the end
my dear friend
my right hand
