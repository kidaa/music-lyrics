I lost my key...Where is the door?
Am I living here anymore?
My souvenirs thrown on the floor
It's never been this bad before
I went outside to get a life
But everything was closed up tight
Why should I care?  Why should I run?
Now that I'm home...my guitar's gone!

I'm taking it day by day
Life goes on...oh, yeah, life goes on...

Awake at night  I look outside
A burning car in the dawning light
A sorry sight...another fight
A scenery in black and white
What can I do?  What can I say?
It's a hard time in a hard place

I'm taking it day by day
Life goes on...oh, yeah, life goes on...Don't ask me if I feel alright
I'm glad that I am here tonight
Don't ask me if it's wrong or right
Remember everything is fine
Remember...Forever

It's getting worse, most everyday
But has it always been this way?
This price I have to pay today
My goddamn house is in flames
A traffic jam...commercial breaks
And politicians' big disgrace
This planet earth...it's where I live
It's where I'll die, I do believe

I'm taking it day by day
Life goes on...oh, yeah, life goes on...
