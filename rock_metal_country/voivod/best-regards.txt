to whom it may concern
your well-known address
again, with no answer
to my last request
disregard ink spots
my presentation
consider my clear thoughts
my speculations

what a warning
the way you're talking
I'm more than worried

the sky is burning
the clouds are falling
I'm more than sorry

you write me back
blank empty words
you don't write back

acknowledge my statement
a creased white receipt
what a disappointment
was I indiscreet?
perhaps I'm impolite
am I out of place?
have I the right to write
to express my case?the time is coming
the world is dying
I'm more than worried

the clock is ticking
real action's missing
I'm more than sorry

I stay well-behaved
waiting for the mail
best regards, good world

I stay well-behaved
well into my grave
best regards, good world
