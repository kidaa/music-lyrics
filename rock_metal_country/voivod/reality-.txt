Struggling through this
Disturbing life
Surviving is
the only way
to understand
the reasons why
each of us live
riding the blind
tension will pull
you down beneath
way underground
you shall remain
using your soul
dying to breathe
nothing to say
no one to blame
I've always been
slightly confused
all things appear
doomed in a way
whispering voice
is this the end?
my only fate
Tormented, down
Reality...
Tormented, down
Reality...
Upside down reality
I can't hide anxiety
Say goodbye to sanity
