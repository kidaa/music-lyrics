Evaluate just what it's worth
This rotting world
This dump we call the earth
What do I care, have no regret
The future sky
A blackened mournful death
Disbelief, irritate
Disagree, circulate
Expedite, disengage
Blast off, disarray
Radio signals, complete shutdown
Stereo vision, freedom unbound
What do I see, a layer of cloud
In front of me
The future wanders on
Shift the gear, elevate
Disappear, gone away
Lost control, hesitate
Destroy, terminate
Radio signals, complete shutdown
Stereo vision, freedom unbound
A shooting star is crashing down
this meteor
has left a burning ground
Negative, desolate
Sorrowful, purity
Positive, energy
Depressed, isolate
Radio signals, complete shut down
Stereo vision, freedom unbound
I don't care no more
I don't fucking care
