Conventional TV
Standard basic design
harmful beyond belief
X-Ray, your mind
Watching the new TV
Wired into your brain
It all becomes so clear
You'll never be the same
Normal viewing distance
Much more than meets the eye
Closer to the picture
Transmit, full time
If you do not believe
What I'm telling you
Be ready to receive
A lesser point of view
Bio-TV is what you see
Transformation
In no time
Bio-TV is what you'll be 
Transmutation
A new life line
Information
It's show time
Bio-TV is what you need
Transformation
In no time
Transmutation
A new headline
This is Bio-TV
This is Bio-TV
This is Bio-TV
