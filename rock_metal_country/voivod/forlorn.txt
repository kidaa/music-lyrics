Now i've come back
Crusing the day my maker took
My strength away
Planet control
To save my world
Mission complete 
Though i am weak
Lost in this world
I am forlorn
Loss of this world
I am forlorn
I fight alone
Me with my selves
Battling ghosts
Part of this hell
Give me some rest
I feel so old
My blood is drained
Turning me cold
Lost in this world
Feeling forlorn
Loss of this world
I am forlorn
Lost in this world
Feeling forlorn
Loss of this world
I am alone
Shadows here
In this place
Planet fear
Death is near
Anark my given name
Close my eyes
