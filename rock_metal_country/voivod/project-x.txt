Living in this age
imminent destruction
soon to leave this earth
and all it's corruption
until the final day comes
they prepare to ride
so long, into orbit
shadowy programs
guaranteed deception
Apollo 2000 is ready for lift off
and at the darkest hour
they head for the sky
so long, into orbit
one way trip into space
soon will start
new human race
Project X has commenced
new world soon
so different, so different
finally have reached
their docking zone
the president and his crew
find a new home
everything seems perfect
then new problems arise
overpopulation
starts when they multiply
so long, into orbit
