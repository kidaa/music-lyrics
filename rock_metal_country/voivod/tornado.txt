Nature deadly twisters
War of winds strikes again
You live in a nice neighborhood
As nice as it will be after
They drop down from the clouds
Completely out man's control
Some day it's gonna catch me
The tornado is right behind
It picks me up to overseas
The tornado is right there
Cumulonimbus storms arrive
Lightning flashes a hundred miles around
Electrical collision course
Creates the elephant trunk
Creeping and looking for your home
Sucking anything from the ground
Go 25.000 feet in the air
The deadlist of all thunderheads
The strong winds and the vacuum
Are gonna take you to the heart of the storm
Moving and turning
No escape, you disappear
It rips you off, keeps you in
Rises you up and pushes you out
Into the guts of the tornado
Get high by the suction of the funnel
Spinning at 300 miles an hour
And trying to outwit this monster
Moving and turning
No escape, you disappear
It rips you off, keeps you in
Rises you up and pushes you out
The frontal attack, now is in the past
Is it finished, or is it coming back?
No one knows, where it goes
Am I safe ? Am I gone with it ?
Running scared !!
Do it quickly, if you see it
There is no time, for a warning
The tornado has struck, hope you have some luck
Dust will make you blind, nothing you can find
Running scared !
