the red grass, up to my knees
an aura comes towards me

someone's changed the formula
un-chaining another law

the structures, the colors

uniform chaos is alternating

the nature of things!immense inertia
nearly nirvana

is this quest forever?

oceans of motion
a field of questions

I won't last forever!

the nature of things!
