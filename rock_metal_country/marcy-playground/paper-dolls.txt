Who's the captain of the ship I think it's sinking 
I know I don't know what I know I don't know what was I thinking 

Paper Dolls 
Before The folding 
Schools like malls 
That all are closing 
Afraid to dance 
Don't talk to strangers 
Avoid romance 
Read what the sign says 
Parental guidance is advised 
Another teenager surprised 
blah, blah, blah, blah 
Feels so good to be alive 
blah, blah, blah 
Yeah, life was easier at five 
blah, blah, blah 
Feels so good to be alive 
blah, blah, blah 
Yeah, life was easier at five 
What was I thinking? 

I can't make up my mind 
Can't even make up my bed 
Yeah, I should clean up my act 
But first I clean up my head 
My books are on the shelf 
I don't apply myself 
You always check up on me 
But check yourself, oh
