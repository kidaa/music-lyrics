Puppets of hay and a king for sale
Cries Jolly Roger
The jester dance the joker strut'
In the court of rebel sodville
Bring wine for the knights in crime armour
As time beats away and
Bring em all shattered glass in flowers
In hopes that they all might stay
One more day 
Put a jack for hire on the cold wheel of fire
Cries dolly dagger
With a ripple hot in the wing iron pot
In the court of rebel sodville
Bring wine for the queen in red; courage
As time beats away
And she smiles as they drift past her humor and hopes
They all might stay
One more day 
What a master of power in the cold ivory tower
Cried sully Stephen
As a snowdrift night brings a chilling bite
To the court of rebel sodville
Bring wine for the knights in crime armour
As time beats away
And wiling in an acid bath of hours
We hope that they all might stay
One more day
