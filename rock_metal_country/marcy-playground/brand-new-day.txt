The secret that you keep
Is trouble on your mind
Even when you sleep
It's trouble on your mind
When you need to get it out
Say it
Well you know it's up to you
Yeah, and maybe you should cry
Until you feel brand new
And when you get it out you'll find
That you can't keep anything inside
And there's a brand new day
There's a brand new day, it's true
A brand new day for you

The secret that you keep
Is burning in your mind
Even when you sleep
Burning in your mind
When you need to get it out
Say it
Well you know it's up to you
Yeah, and maybe you should cry
Cry loud and true
And when you get it out, you'll find
That you can't keep anything inside
And there's a brand new day
There's a brand new day
There's a brand new day, it's true
Yeah a brand new day is shining through
