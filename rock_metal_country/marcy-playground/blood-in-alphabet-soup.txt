I think I'll tell a friend
Just to let 'em in on a secret I know
No, I better not
I'm too paranoid to let anyone know

I'm feeling so proud
I can spell blood in alphabet soup
Can you

No sorry...so sorry
I'm the only one
I'm the only one
I'm the only one
Hahahahahaha
And you will never know
You will never know
You will never know
hahahahahahh
I'm feeling so proud
I can spell blood
In alphabet soup
Can you

I think I'll tell a friend
Just to let 'em in on a secret I know
That there's blood in alphabet soup...
