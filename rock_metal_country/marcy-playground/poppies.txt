Long long ago, In China I'm told
To England was traded some tea
And so sealed the fate
In pieces of eight
All England and all of the world
Yeah...poppies
When soon his majesty
sent soldiers and thieves
To India Searching for gold
Instead from the ground
Some magic they found
Something far better I'm told
Yeah...poppies
Yeah...poppies
And now this story told
from days of our own
When gossamer doggies ran ran
They'd patiently wait
With pieces of eight
So everybody could smile one more time
Yeah...poppies
Yeah...poppies
