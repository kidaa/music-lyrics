On through the woods and you go through the snow
Walk to the tree and you breathe on the limb
How many times have you seen me with her 
When the night comes and you find that you're bound
Tied to the tree and the straps at your knees
How many times have you seen me with her 
I'd say never, aw lover.
Say never, here. 
Hide in the willow and wait for the dawn
Carve another dream in the limb that you're on
How many times have you seen me around 
I'd say never, aw lover
Say never, here
Here, say never, aw lover 
When the sun comes and you find that you're free
Walk to the water and bleed in the stream
And think of the lover that once you were wrapped around 
Breathe in the water, breathe it in deep
Just like the winter, fall into sleep
Don't ever wander, don't ever move again
Never, aw lover
Say never, aw lover
Say never, aw lover
