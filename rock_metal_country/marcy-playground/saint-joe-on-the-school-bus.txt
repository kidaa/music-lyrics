J. Wozniak
Saint Joe he said he's never been
Dressed up like a woman
Saint Joe they said your dad was gay
They said your mom she's a whore
They said it 'til you were raw
They said your mom's she's a bore
They made her beg them for more
My Aunt Mary, Aunt Mary
Aunt Mary says they have the darkness there in their eyes
Saint Joe he said he's never been
made up like a woman
Saint Joe the time is coming when
When Mary never will return
When Mary never will come back here..yeah
Mary never will return
O' Mary please come home
O' my Aunt Mary, Aunt Mary
Aunt Mary says they have the darkness there in their eyes
O' my aunt Mary, Aunt Mary
Aunt Mary says they have the darkness there
They have the family disease
They have the darkness there in their minds
--This song is about being picked on.
