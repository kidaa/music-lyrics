Come see the vampires of New York
Come lose your mind in Central Park
But don't leave your soul behind 
Come take in 8th street after dark
Such peculiar people you'll remark
You might even see a murder
And all the whores on Blecker Street
They wear the blissful grin
Caused by the drugs they take
To relieve them of their sins
And ";oh lord I think she's dying"; I head somebody say
I think she's dying
And ";oh lord I think she's dying";
Or maybe she's already dead and maybe she's gone to Mars
Maybe we could write her epitaph in the stars
It'd say ";If you go away from here..If you go a million miles...";
Come downtown to see them go
Into the den of the vampires of New York
But please watch your step as you're getting off, kids
