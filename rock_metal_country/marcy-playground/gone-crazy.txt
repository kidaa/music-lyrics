Come back and be
Come back for free
Come back and stay child
Have you gone crazy
Molly, it must be fine
It seems so dreamy to be sublime
Molly has gone to Spain
Has gone with Venus to watch the rain
And it seems that's not the place where you belong
And it seems that's not the place where you belong
When there's no sun and there's no moon
And there's no stars child
Have you gone crazy
Molly it must be fine
It seems so dreamy to be sublime
And Molly the whipporwhill
Has gone to space boy, she is there still
When there's no sun and there's no moon
And there's no child have you gone crazy
