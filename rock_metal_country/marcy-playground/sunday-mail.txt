I'm just out here in the street practically
I'm just waitin' for the Sunday mail
Oooo it doesn't come 
Will you send me something soon
Will you swing me near the moon
With those words, I know
I know you will, I know you will
I know you will 
I'm just out here in the street, practically
I'm just waitin' for the Sunday mail
Aooo it never comes oooo 
Will you send me something soon
Will you swing me near the moon
With those words, I know
I know you will, I know you will
I know you will, I know you will
