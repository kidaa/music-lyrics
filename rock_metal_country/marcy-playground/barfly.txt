She come around here
Past midnight
She's always looking soft and far away
Yea she knows shes looking alright

Yea, Hey angel what you tryin to be
Hey angel what you tryin to be 
What you drinkin'?
Just tryin to be polite
Looks like a Tanqueray and Kamikaze night
That's alright
Why don't you climb on and ride

Down my street, away with me
Instead of looking soft and far away
Come why don't you learn to live a little
Dangerous  

Hey angel what you tryin to be
Hey angel what's the tragedy
What you drinkin
A Nappa Valley white
Well it's tanqueray and Kamikaze night
That's right 
Why dont you climb on and ride
Ride a little baby, alright
Hey angel what you tryin to be 
Hey angel what's the tragedy
What you drinkin?
Just tryin to be polite
Well it's tanqueray and kamikaze night
Last call to climb on and ride
Take a chance...   ...on some late night romance
