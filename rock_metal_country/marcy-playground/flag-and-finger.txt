So where o' where do all the revolutionaries hide
Have they all decided not to come outside
Give me a simple sign
To know if you're alive...or dead

Just raise the flag and finger
And leave it there to linger
Yeah this is my solution
This is my American revolution

Let's take the condom off the microphone
Cause there's no one to protect
And no you can't spread disease
Through profanities...or your intellect

So I raise the falg and finger
and I leave it there to linger
Yeah this is my solution
This is my American revolution

Freedom is fragile
Like the freedom to speak out
Yeah, the freedom to tell them
When to shove it where the sun don't shine

And we raise the flag and finger
And leave it there to linger
Yeah this is our solution
And this is my American revolution
Yeah this is my American revolution
Yeah this is my American revolution
