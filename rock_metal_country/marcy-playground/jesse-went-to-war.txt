Jesse when you went to war
And never did return
Summer came and all the girls were
Sitting on the lawn
Looked down at all those letters
And I knew that you were gone
But I came back
I came back

Brothers inseparable
Two rabble rousing boys
Dreaming all the new mischief
And making all the noise
When Bobby bought that Chevy man
Well I knew that we were poised
But I came back
I came back

And tonight when darkness comes
I dream of how we were once
And tonight when I sleep
An angel hums

Jesse when you went to war
And never did return
Summer came and all the girls were
Sitting on the lawn
Looked down at all those medals
And I knew that you were gone
But I came back
I came back
I came back
