S. Fraser/J. Wozniak
Ancient wall of flowers tumblin' down
Black cat petals and a smiling clown
I like to keep them in a jar beside
Just enough to mess my mind inside
But I never heard you callin' from the sun
Did you ever care to shoot your silver gun
So I never heard you callin' from the moon
Did you ever care to sing your free love tune
Ancient walls of whispers falling low
Murmur simmer and I'm feeling slow
Keep me up but keep me in my head
I'll ping a pound of posies 'til I'm dead
But I never heard you callin' from the sun
Did you ever care to shoot your silver gun
So I never heard you callin' from the moon
Did you ever care to sing your free love tune
Ancient walls of flowers tumblin' down
Ancient walls of flowers tumblin' down
Ancient walls of whispers tumlin' down
Ancient walls are tumblin' all over this town
