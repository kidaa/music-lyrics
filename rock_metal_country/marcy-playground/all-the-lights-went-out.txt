She came in from stormy weather
And asked her friend to be there with her
When she slid down Cupid's bow
Oh lookin' fine that day 
I had a dream that we were lovers
I had a joke and she would smile when I'd say
We could blow
Blow a fuse in heaven
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Well today
All the lights went out in heaven
Yeah today
All the lights went out in heaven 
And I knew that she was all
All that I needed
Yeah, yeah, 
Cause today
All the lights went out in heaven
Yeah today
All the lights went out in heaven 
And I knew that we were doomed
Doomed to love each other
