The sign says...
Rainbow's ending two miles
The sign says here..
That there is a pot of gold
For your immortal soul
Now on and on we go
We danced with the devil
And we walked down his road
To live the life we know
All the towns and the fans we've rocked

We've been hotter than the sun
And biggere than the Milky Way
When you're number one
Pay no mind to what they say
We never never dwell
Let me tell you how we got there
To rainbow's ending
And if you wanna come
I'll tell you this...
The sign still stands
Two miles down the road
So you better go
Then on and on you'll go
You'll dance with the devil
And walk down his road
To live the life we know
And all the fans and the towns you rock
Ten million strong

Hotter than the sun
Bigger than the Milky Way
When you're number one
Just remember what I say
That when you go to hell
Rock and roll is how you got there
Rock and roll is how you got there
Rock and roll is how you got there
To rainbow's ending
