Some cats, they know how to fight
Some cats run
I'm a thousand generations, ahead of them
Cool as they come
See all my suits are Calvin Klein
My lucky number's 69
I got all the things I need
It's the nature of my breed
I'm independant, smooth and confident
Always in command
With a graceful element
a tasteful compliment
Do you know who I am
...look up, look down, watch out the tiger's on the town tonight...
I'm a deadly handsome man
...look up, look down, watch out the tiger's on the town tonight...
I'm the lion and the lamb
...look up, look down, watch out the tiger's on the town tonight...

Everywhere I go I make the scene
The ladies love to stroke me
I'm Pimped out and lazy in my limousine
Oh, come on in here sweetie
Everything I say...like Socrates
Most people love to quote me
My real name is Mephistopheles
But you can call me Baby
