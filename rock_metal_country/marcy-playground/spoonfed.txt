Forces in my mind
Talking all the time
Don't let the home fires burn away
Spoonfed mush and jam
Spoonfed peas and ham
And all the medicine they can

And I'm stuck in this place
I never wanted to be here
You gotta help me mom and dad
I never wanted to be here
They lock me in my room
They think I'm crazy
But if you had all these rules
You would be crazy too

Forces in my mind
Talking all the time

And I'm stuck in this place
I never wanted to be here
You gotta help me mom and dad
I never wanted to be here
They lock me in my room
They think I'm crazy...
Crazy...crazy...
