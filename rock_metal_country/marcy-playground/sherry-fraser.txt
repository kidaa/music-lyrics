Oo I saw stars falling all around her head
Red, gold, and blue
Sherry Fraser where are you
'Cause I saw starts falling all around your head
When we were young
Sherry Fraser where have you gone
We're all wondering
When will you come back
And play..some day.
Sherry yeah
The mad hatter he waited for Alice
To come to tea again
He waits forever for his old lover
And always wonderin'
Will I see stars falling all around your head
When you return
Sherry Fraser what have you learned
And we're all wondering
When will you come back
And play..some day
And please do come back
And play..some day
Please do come back
And play..some day
