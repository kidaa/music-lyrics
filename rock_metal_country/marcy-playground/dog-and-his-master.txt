Hey little boy see the Johnny and Janes
Hey little boy see them all go insane
Look and see Spot run
'Cause he pissed in their hallway
Run Spot run
Run away from it all
And I say you can be any way that you wanna be
How I'll be, that's up to me
Hey little girl see them all run around
Hey little girl see them all tumble down
Johnny will boss
Janey will buy
Spot will beg
But everyone dies
As I said you can be any way that you wanna be
How I'll be, that's up to me
One little, two little, three little idiots
Four little, five little, six little idiots
Seven little, eight little, nine little idiots
All in suit and tie
One little, two little, three little idiots
Four little, five little, six little idiots
All dressed up to die, and I say
You can be any way that you wanna be
But how I'll be, that's up to me
