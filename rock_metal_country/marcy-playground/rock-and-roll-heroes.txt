Rock and roll heroes
Keep me so mesmerized
In the confines of my room
I'm moving to the sound
And rock and roll heroes
They help me sleep through the night
And in the morning wake up to that song
That played the night before

I may be a teenage rebel
I live life on bass and treble
but I know that these years
They won't come again

So I have rock and roll heroes
And baby I love them all
I got my headphones all turned up
Just cruising down the hall
Without my rock and roll heroes I would be miserable
And so everywhere I go
Ba-boom the radio

I may be a teenage rebel
I live life on bass and treble
but I know that these years
They won't come again

Yea mamma I'm more than crazy
Oh baby all my sense is gone
And when I'm pushing daisies
I'll have my tunes to carry on
Oh my rock and roll heroes
Oh my rock and roll heroes
Oh my rock and roll heroes
I'm lost without my rock and roll heroes
I'm lost without my rock and roll heroes
I'm lost without rock and roll
