Angel,
You missed your chance
To be the prom queen
And so you turned
Into a wet dream
Star of your own video
Late night show on the floor
A bad girl
No one's watching
As you slow move
To the rhythm
Of this sweet sound
Booming through the radio
Late night show that they ignore
Are you lonely

Cause I'm no ones boy
I'm no ones boy
And I'll be all you need
Only if you plead
Pray do
Angel blue

If you'll be my girl
If you'll be my girl
I'm no ones boy
And I'll be all you need
But only if you'll bleed
Pray do

Hey hey, don't walk away from me
I found you
I can find you
