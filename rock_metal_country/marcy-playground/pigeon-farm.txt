If you could see in my eyes
I'd show you a darling
Surprise
There is a place
There is a fortune
It has everything and
I want to share it with my friends 
So please don't be so afraid
Cause there's nobody insane
Here here on the Pigeon Farm
Here here on the Pigeon Farm
Here here I'm the Pigeon Farm boy 
Out where the sun's in my eye
And out where the hills hit the sky
There is a place
There is a fortune
It has everything to
Help you fit in with everyone 
So please don't be so afraid
Cause there's nobody insane
Here here on the Pigeon Farm
Here here on the Pigeon Farm
Here here I'm the Pigeon Farm boy 
So please don't be so afraid
Cause there's nobody insane
Here here on the Pigeon Farm
Here here on the Pigeon Farm
Here here I'm the Pigeon Farm boy
