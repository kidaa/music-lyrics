I wanna be a Punk Rock Superstar
I'm gonna be a Punk Rock Superstar
And if you love me when I'm a star
With all my money and my fancy cars
I'll wink at you as I smash my guitars
This is just a pussycat's life
And everybody knows it is insane
It is insane

I wanna be a Punk Rock Superstar
I'm gonna be a Punk Rock Superstar
And if you love me we'll make a scene
And I'll sue the ass of every magazine
Who do you sleep with, where do you go
Inquiring minds want to know

And if you love me, come take my hand
I'll tell you all about my special plan
Just say you love me for who I am
Just like my supermodel wife
Oh yeah!
