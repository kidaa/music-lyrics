Christopher O'Malley went out on a bridge
Down in Chehalis
And clutching his bible and a letter from her
Fell into the river
Pity no one was there
No angels in the air
And the morning paper ran
One more suicide
His mama stayed by the river side
Down in Chehalis
And clutching her bible and a letter from him
Fell into crying
Pity no was there
No angles in the air
And the morning paper ran
One more suicide
Pity no one was there
No angels in the air
And the morning paper ran
One more suicide
One more suicide
One more suicice
