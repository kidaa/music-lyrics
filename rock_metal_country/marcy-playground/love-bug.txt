Here is love bug
Found in heaven
Yeah, love bug is blind
And one of a kind 
It is growing
It's all knowing
It is glowing bright
Bright red 
And so, I'm in love
Yeah, love bug, his kind
Will forever shine
So open up your heart and let it in
Or, or check inside 
It' is growing
It's all knowing
It is glowing bright, bright
Bright red
