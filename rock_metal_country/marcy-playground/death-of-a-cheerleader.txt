She was so pretty, everyone said
The more so the pity
That she was found dead
And now the flag only flies at fifty percent
In the school yard where she once went
Push 'em back, push 'em back
Way back, way back
B-E A-G-G-R-E-S-S-I-V-E

And the death of a cheerleader
Take me by surprise
How the death of a cheerleader
Can open eyes

Yellow carnations and roses galore
Were sent to the mother and
Placed by the door
And in the spot where her daughter had
Taken her life
Was a sweet sixteen photo
On homecoming night
Push 'em back, push 'em back
Way back, way back
B-E A-G-G-R-E-S-S-I-V-E

And the death of a cheerleader
Takes me by surprise
How the death of a cheerleader
Can open eyes
And it's sad that she had to die
To open eyes

Nobody doubted her future was vast
Nobody noticed she grew up so fast
It's a shame that her future's a thing of the past
Tomorrow's the funeral you know
L-E-T-S-G-O
