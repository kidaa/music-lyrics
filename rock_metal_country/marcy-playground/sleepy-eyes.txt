Dreaming again
Warm in your arms
Sing me a song
Beautiful sound
And you love me
With your sleepy eyes
But you're not around
I'm riding a ghost
You're already gone
And I wake up to a cold day
Just another in a long line of cold days
Clear as a bell
There in my bed
Holding your hands
Beautiful hands
And you love me
With your sleepy eyes
But you're just a dream
I'm walking alone
And I should have known
You'd find another soul mate
I'm just another in a long line of soul mates
