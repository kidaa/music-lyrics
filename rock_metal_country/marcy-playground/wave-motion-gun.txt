Backstage behind the curtain there's an
There's an armchair with a secret engine and you
You climb in and get naked watching Star Blazers 
Wish you had their amenities
To fend off your enemies
In one big blast from your wave motion gun 
And so you reach down to that secret panel and there's a
There's a whole raft of little buttons and you
You pick one and hope it takes you to Mars 
Soon there'll be no pain again
You'll feel like yourself again
When you shoot all your heroin
In one big blast from your wave motion gun 
And so downstairs behind the oven there's a
There's a dark hole where, where the gas comes in
You know you should, you should climb in
It'll get you there so much faster 
Soon there'll be no pain again
You'll feel like yourself again
When you shoot all your heroin
In one big blast from
In one big shot from
In one big blast from
In one big shot
>From your wave motion gun
Wave motion gun
Wave motion gun
Wave motion gun
Wave motion gun
Wave motion gun
