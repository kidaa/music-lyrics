Mom I'm dyin'
I'm dizzy and fryin'
My throat hurts
I think I should stay in bed 
Cause I got some kind of disease
And there are no remedies
Think I should stay in bed today
Maybe tomorrow go out and play
It's Saturday 
With Ginseng
And fresh squeezed juice
Of wheat-grass
Oh, and some hot chicken soup
That just might keep me alive
A couple days 
But I've got some kind of disease
And there are no remedies
Think I'll join Timothy Leary
In a cryogenic freeze
Next Saturday 
Yeah I've got some kind of disease
And there are no remedies
Shoulda listened when you said beware
Of horny girls with New Jersey hair
Last Saturday
