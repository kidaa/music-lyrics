Look around I'm moving in
Hold around when it begin
We can do it, we can do it
Anything what they could try I never get near
And they can get out of there
Gotta keep on driving never stop
United united united we stand
United we never get fall
United united united we stand
United we stand one and all
Give me hope don't give in
To make us stand we gonna win
We can do it, we can do it
Anything what they could try I never get near
And they can get out of there
Gotta keep on driving never stop
Forgive me love
