Like wild fire
Comes roaring
Mad whirlwind
Burning the road
Black thunder
White lightning
Speed demons cry
The Hell Patrol
Night riders
Death dealers
Storm bringers
Tear up the ground
Fist flying
Eyes blazing
They're glory bound
The Hell Patrol
Brutalize you
Neutralize you
Gonna go for your throat as you choke
Then they'll vaporapeize you
Terrorize you
Pulverize you
Gonna cut to the bone as you groan
And they'll paratamize you
Solo: K.K., Glenn
Chrome Masters
Steel Warriors
Soul Stealers
Ripping out hearts
They're Devil's Dogs
The Hell Patrol
