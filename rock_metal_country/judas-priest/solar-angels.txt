Golden halos radiating higher
Diamond visions softly breathing fire
Sky processions we are watching you arrive
Silver crystals arching beams below
What light spirals lifting up to go
Glass formations solar angels spread their wings
Spectral gliders drifting in the air
Wheels of wonder floating everywhere
Draped in rainbows gently we ascend
