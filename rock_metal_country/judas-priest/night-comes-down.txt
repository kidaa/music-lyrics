In the last rays of the setting sun
And the past days, that's where our
 memories run
And all of those times
Still race through my mind
I'm shattered inside to find
When the night comes down
And I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's no place to go
Call me and I'll wait till the summer
You never understood
Call me and I'll wait forever
For a love that's only good
As the light starts to dim
The fear closes in
And the nightmares begin
Oh no you won't be there tomorrow
Oh no say it isn't true
Can't take this pain and sorrow
Oh can't you see my heart is broken in two
