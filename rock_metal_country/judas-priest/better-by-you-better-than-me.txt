You can't hide away to ease my passion
You listen to the blood for win my pain
You heat the teaching out on the wind
Tell them while I'm in love within
I can't forget the world my mind is dead
It's better by you better than me
Guess you have to tell her how I try
To speak of out hell so inside
Tell her now I got to go
I'll sleep in down the shore
Tell the world how much we living for          
It's better by you better than me
Everybody, everybody knows
Better by you better than me
You can tell everybody what to be
You can say you can look you can see
It's better by you better than me
