I'd spend my days alone
I used to stay at home
Lost in seclusion there.
Like I was in a cell
A captured heart as well
Surrounded by despair.
Darkness filled my soul
Losing all control.
Down on the streets below
Bright city lights would glow.
The energy would rise
And through the heat I'd gaze
Still counting empty days.
With fire in my eyes
Living through this hell
Can I break this spell.
Fever.  You set my soul on fire.
Fever.  You fill me with desire.
Fever.  You always get it right.
Fever.  All day and all night.
Then one night as I walked
I heard your body talk
I saw a shooting sta
In some magnetic trance
Our beating hearts would dance
And crash down from afar.
Oh how strange fate is
Never dreamed of this.
So destiny has brought us
Oh so close together
We were like angels in the night
e dream
At last I'll be with you forever.
And all at once it feels so right.
