4:40
Storm warning
But there's no fear
Lies forming
The sacrament lays bare
The sinner
Will testify
They'll suffer
When sacrificed on high
The burning sermons purge their evil words
Between the Hammer and the Anvil
Force rises
False ritual
Baptises
The body and the soul
Our union
Their fall from grace
Confession confess your sins
Will seal them to their fate
The burning sermons will survive their curse
Between the Hammer and the Anvil
Solo: K.K. / Glenn
Transgression
They prey on grief
Our mission
To purify believe
This alter
Gives power and light
They'll falter
While we are shining bright
The burning sermons consecrate their sin
Between the Hammer and the Anvil
Storm warning
But there's no fear
