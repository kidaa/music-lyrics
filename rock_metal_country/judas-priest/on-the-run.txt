I'm rollin' and ridin' away
Cause I'm a reelin' and feelin' o.k.
Forget about tomorrow
Go for it today
Cause I'm on, on the run
I'm a rockin' and sellin' my soul
Cause I'm livin' for rock and for roll
Forget about tomorrow
Go for it today
Cause I'm on, on the run
I'm shakin' all day and all night
Yeah I'm doin' what I know is right
Forget about tomorrow
Go for it today
Cause I'm on, on the run
