Twenty-four hours of the day, you're on my trail and I can't get away
I can't shake you off. You're a wolf on the prowl
You got my scent and I can hear you howl
No where to run. No where to hide. No where to go
No where to run to. No where to hide this hurt insight
Hot for love
When the sun goes down, I can feel you heart
Till the sun comes up, when you've got me worn deadbeat
I said I'm all burned out, I'm a physical wreck
But there you go again with your hot breath on my neck.
