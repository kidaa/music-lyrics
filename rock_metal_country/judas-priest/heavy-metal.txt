When the power chords come crashing down go
Tearing through my senses
It's for strong, not for the weak
In light and dark dimension
It stimulates, regenerates
It's therapeutic healing
It lifts our feet up off the ground
and blasts us through the ceiling
Between the eyes
I hear it screaming
And it electrifies
Your inner feelings
Hot shock waves charge the air
All heads are banging
Fists pumping everywhere
Guitars are cranking
Heavy metal. Heavy metal
What do you want
Heavy metal. Heavy metal
What do you want
Ten thousand lights come blazing down
With razor sharp precision
The speakers pour our molten steel
The beat gives double vision
An armour plated raging beast
That's born of steel and leather
It will survive against all odds
Stampeding on forever
Between the eyes
I hear it screaming
And it electrifies
Your inner feelings
Hot shock waves charge the air
All heads are banging
Fists pumping everywhere
Guitars are cranking
Heavy metal. Heavy metal
What do you want
Heavy metal. Heavy metal
What do you want
