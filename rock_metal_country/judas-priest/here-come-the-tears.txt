Once I dream love would coming sweetly of away
Now it seems like pass me by I still long to the way
Here come the tears
Looks like you're always be the same
No one hear you come with me
Here come the tears
All alone no one care
So much you give do you all like that
Take me now in your arms
Let me rest safe from harm
Well
I want to be loved
I need to be loved
Oh somebody else
Here come here come the tears...
