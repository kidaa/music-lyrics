Got no silver in my pockets
Got no pillow for my head
And the winter it gets stronger
Got to ease my aching head
In the morning when I wake up
Get this feeling deep inside
And I wonder if I'll die young
Or I'll go out of my mind
I still get this awful feeling
When the snow falls to the ground
It still sends my senses reeling
Knowing winter's come to town
