No one can stop me now
I'm like a human dynamo
Live wired and chargin' out with power
This time I won't hold back, I'm rarin' to get up and go
Fuelled up and growin' by the hour
Look out, I'm blastin' through the lines alive and kickin'
Watch out, I'm young and lethal
I'm goin' from here until eternity
I'm feelin' reckless
Way outa hand, a real survivor
Reckless, comin' at gale force ten
Around me I feel the shock waves, building from the energy
A force field that no one can break through
Solid as rock no wonder I am indestructible
First placed in everything I do
Radio active I'm shootin' through the atmosphere
Takin' off, I'm headin' like a rocket through the stratosphere.
