Fast and furious
We ride the universe
To carve a road for us
That slices every curve in sight
We accelerate,
No time to hesitate
This load will detonate
Whoever would
Contend its right
Born to lead
At breakneck speed
With high octane
We're spitting flames

Freewheel burning

On we catapult
We're thrusting to the hiltUnearthing every fault
Go headlong into any dare
We don't accept defeat
We never will retreat
We blaze with scorching heat
Obliteration's everywhere

Look before you leap
Has never been the way we keep
Our road is free
Charging to the top
And never give in never stops
The Way to be
Hold on to the lead
With all your will and concede
You'll find there's life
With victory on high

Freewheel Burning
