Shooting for the stars
Cruise the speed of light.
Glowin' god of Mars
Body burning bright.
Well I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind
Yes I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind.
Tearing up through life
Million miles an hour
Blinding all in sight
Surging rush of power.
Thunderbolt from hell
Shattering aloud.
Screamin' demons yell
Bursting through the clouds.
