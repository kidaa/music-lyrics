I'm gonna break-out
I'm gonna drive my car
I'm gonna get up and go
I want some action
I've been working so hard
I'm gonna over load
Can you feel the beat
Everybody's rockin' in the summer heat
As the sun goes down
Well deep down inside
You feel your tempature rise
For those wild nights
Hot and crazy days
Wild nights
Hot and crazy days
I'm feeling good tonight
I'm gonna cruise around
Makin' every head turn
Wind up the radio
I'm in the mood for some lovin'
Cause the night time's comin'
Can you feel the beat
Everybody's rockin' in the summer heat
As the sun goes down
Well deep down inside
You feel your tempature rise
For those wild nights
Hot and crazy days
Wild nights
Hot and crazy days
Come on
Gettin' hot tonight
Come on
That's right
Come on
There's no end in sight
Come on
Alright
I'm gonna break-out
I'm gonna drive my car
I'm gonna get up and go
I want some action
I've been working so hard
I'm gonna over load
Can you feel the beat
Everybody's rockin' in the summer heat
As the sun goes down
Well deep down inside
You feel your tempature rise
For those wild nights
Hot and crazy days
Wild nights
Hot and crazy days
Wild nights
Hot and crazy days
Wild nights
Hot and crazy days
Wild nights
Hot and crazy days
Wild nights
Hot and crazy days
Wild nights
Hot and crazy days
