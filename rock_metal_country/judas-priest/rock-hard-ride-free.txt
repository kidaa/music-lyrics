Get a grip on the action, moving heaven and earth
Gotta get a reaction, push for all that you're worth
No denying we're going against the grain
So defiant they'll never put us down
Rock Hard Ride Free all day, all night
Rock Hard Ride Free all your life
Tough as steel stop at nothing
Look at fate in the face
Don't take no for an answer
Grab the lead in the race
Rock hard with a purpose
Got a mind that won't bend
Diehard resolution
That is true to the end
