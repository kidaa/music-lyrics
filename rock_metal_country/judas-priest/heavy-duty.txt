I know you like it hot
Love to writhe and sweat
You think that this feels good
You ain't felt nothing yet
Red-hot licks in the palm of my hand
Feel your baby quake
As we hit the promised land
I'm heavy duty
We'll rise onside ya till the power splits your head
We're gonna rock ya till your metal hunger's fed
Let's all join farces
Rule with an iron hand
And prove to all the world
Metal rules the land
We're heavy duty
So come on let's tell the world
