Been awake all night, can't get no sleep
I need a steel blue heart walkin' down the street
With your razor nails, and your painted smile
You're gonna get richer, I gotta get wild
Any time you want to
Any way you need
Get your love for money there, satisfaction guaranteed
Wo oh, love zone
You know what I mean
Wo oh, love zone
Live that fantasy
I'm behind the wheel, throttle open wide
The gas tanks full do you want to ride
Drivin' in the fast lane late at night
I can't keep my eyes off your red tail light
You know where we're goin'
I know where we are
Set the rear view mirror for
the backseat of the car
Wo oh, love zone
You know what I mean
Wo oh, love zone
Live that fantasy
In your leather and chrome you're all the rage
All you want to do is get backstage
You heard all the stories, are they true
The rock 'n' roll circus is calling you
When you get there baby
You'll be hypnotised
Never seen nothin' like it no
You won't believe your eyes
Wo oh, love zone
You know what I mean
Wo oh, love zone
Live that fantasy
Wo oh, love zone
You know what I mean
Wo oh, love zone
Live that fantasy
Everybody get in
Everybody get in that love zone
