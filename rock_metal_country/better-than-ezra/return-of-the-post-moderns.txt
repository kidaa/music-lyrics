Ten cent lovers
beneath the covers 
Riding on a wet dream Silver tonic free

High stool sweet tarts
Equipped with green cards
Chomp their 401 k's
Semi-chocolate brie

Digging in Los Cruces
for an army drab container 
Carbon dating clothes for the last time they were washed

Shelby and Sheila
Onomatopoeia
Catch hang nail on Banlon
Shiver Martin Sheen

Preschool mothers
in Technicolor
Are fire bombing Dresden
Stanton, Harry Dean

Feeding line caught tuna to a neutered Bodhisattva 
Writhing peaches for the President 
Out on the White House lawn Beating Herbert Hoover 
With a leather tipped Pinada Thorn and Katy drink the milk tinted 
Amerasian Green RETURN, RETURN, RETURN
