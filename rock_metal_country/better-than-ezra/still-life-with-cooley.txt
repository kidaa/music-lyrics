Everybody talking saying you will be walking
This neighborhood will never be the same
You said we'd understand. 
You found out what's happening now.
So we all sat down and you broke the news.

Now Daddy don't love her anymore.
It's still life with Cooley
Now Daddy don't love her anymore.
It's just still life with Coolly.

All your friends show on time.
They come in bringing red wine.
You said if it's over then we'll go in style.
You better best take care keep one hand to your ear
So you're not left hanging when they're finally gone.

[Chorus:]

Watcha' saying
You're going to stay of at St. Madigan's
reeled in again
You're just fooling around fooling around

People hanging with their good friends
Listening to those old songs.

Now Daddy don't love her anymore.
It's still life with Cooley
Now Daddy don't love her anymore.
It's just still life
It's just still life with Cooley.
