Past the road to your house
That you never called home
Where they turned out your lights
Though they say you'll never know

I remember running through the wet grass
And failing a step behind 
Both of us never tiring 
Desperately wanting 

When they pumped out your guts
And filled you full of those pills 
You were never quite right 
Deserving all the chills 
They say the worst is over
Kicked it over and ran 
Then they ask what went wrong 
When they turn you on again
They turn you on again. 

[Chorus:]
Kick them right in the face 
Make them wish they weren't born 
And if they bring up your name 
Well they'll say you won the war.
Baby burst in the world 
Never given a chance 
Then they ask what went wrong 
When you never had it right 

Oh the letters have dropped off 
Though they say you got them all 
I finally figured out some things you'll never know. 
Take back your life and let me inside 
We'll find the door if you care to anymore. 

I remember running through the wet grass 
and falling a step behind 
Both of us never tiring 
Desperately Wanting.
