Down by the dock, hot blood in the sun.
The body lays up against the reeds.
The locals said, the man had it coming,
and it's time someone put him six feet in the ground.

[To Chorus:]
Where did she go that night
Where did she sleep when the morning came
to the summer house

Missus showed up to I.D. the body
Then shed a tear as she hid a smile.
The sergeant laughed and smiled in frustration.
One life is lost while another one is found.

[To Chorus:]
Where did she go that night
Where did she sleep when the morning came
to the summer house
