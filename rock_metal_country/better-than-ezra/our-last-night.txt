We were standing in an empty room.
The moonlight was falling.
You were holding my hand when the car
Pulled up for you.
And I could have spent a life with you,
But those days were over.
You were calling my name when 
Your face faded from view.

And wasn't it you who told me
The sun would always chase the day?
Wasn't it you who told me?

Angels fly in the air tonight.
Saying, Wasn't it just like swimming
Out on the lake?
Stars collide, and the air's alive.
Or was it just like those promises that you made
On our last night?

I remember waking up with you.
The days doing nothing,
You meant more to me then
Than I think you ever knew.
But you were going to be a doctor,
A movie star, a poet at a Nobel seminar,
I hope the world never tore that out of you.

And wasn't it you who told me
The sun would always chase the day?
Wasn't it you who told me?

Angels fly in the air tonight.
Saying, Wasn't it just like swimming
Out on the lake?
Stars collide, and the air's alive.
Or was it just like those promises that you made?

And what ever happened to the things you loved, the songs we played,
On the Indian days?
What ever happened to the things you gave away,
Like 'Harold and Maude' and singing?

I was waving as you drove away.
The sunlight was falling.
You were writing backwards
In a dusty windowpane.

Angels fly in the air tonight.
Saying, Wasn't it just like swimming
Out on the lake?
Stars collide, and the air's alive.
Or was it just like those promises that you made
On our last night?
