"Calmly, like a razor 
I got us on the door" 
Or "I got a tape of 'clerks' 
Someone left the night before" 

So I go over later 
You're sitting in that chair 
Smoking on your cigarette 
Fingering your hair 

So I get drunk and stoned 
Every time you come around 

Twenty-nine and aimless 
You bartend down on fourth 
Your parents pay insurance 
And the Parson's audit course 

Over-schooled and uninspired 
A trust fund up your nose 
All that wasted talent but, uh 
Ain't that how it always goes? 

So I get drunk and stoned 
Every time you come around 
Yeah, yeah yeah 

So long Allison Foley 
So long, bye-bye 

Come up higher, take a step higher 
Sometimes you understand 
The reasons how you went astray 
But least of all the answer 
That it hurts to watch you waster away 

So I get drunk and stoned 
Every time you come around 
Yeah, yeah yeah 

So long Allison Foley 
So long, bye-bye
