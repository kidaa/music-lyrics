ALONG THE EDGES, COLORS BLUR AT SEEM FAMILIAR.
WHILE YOU READ YOUR MAGAZINE,
I WAS COUNTING ALL THE MARKERS.

AND CALIFORNIA SEEMED TO DRAW YOU LIKE A SIREN
FROM A POSTCARD, OR A LETTER, IN A FRAME OF FILM MELTING.

BUT UNDER YOU, I HEAR YOUR BREATH MOVE IN, OUT SLOWLY. 
UNDER YOU, LET GO COMPLETELY FEELING YOU TAKE OVER ME.

A HOLLYWOOD FLAT WHERE WE'D LAUGH ABOUT OUR FORTUNES 
WELL WE HELD JOBS IN THIS BAR DOWN AT 3RD AND SAN VICENTE.
AND RAMEN NOODLES AT 4:30 IN THE MORNING, 
WHEN WE BARELY COULD SURVIVE, I WAS NEVER MORE ALIVE. 

UNDER YOU, I FEEL YOUR BLOOD FLOWING OUT SLOWLY. 
UNDER YOU, LET GO COMPLETELY FEELING YOU TAKE OVER ME 

YOU MOVED IN SLOW DEGREES
A SUDDEN MEMORY
YOU'RE A LEONARD COHEN SONG

BUT EVERY NOW AND THEN I'D SWEAR I SEE YOU STANDING ON A SIDEWALK, IN A 
RESTAURANT, FROM A TAXI CAB PASSING.

UNDER YOU I FEEL YOU MOVING IN/OUT SLOWLY
UNDER YOU LET GO COMPLETELY FEELING YOU TAKE OVER ME. 

TAKE OVER ME.
