feat. DJ Swamp

I got a little bit of hope
Like a soap on a rope
Sweeter than sour
But getting thinner by the hour
Falling fast, and I'm running out of gas

Muggin on your sister!
Smart as Bobby Fischer!

Still I couldn't get arrested
Though I got more hooks
Than Madonna got looks
And just like that AC/DC song
Come on baby, shake me all night long

All I want to do
Is stay till early in the morning
You know I love you baby
And all I've got to say
Is your love's extra ordinary
You're extra ordinary, baby

Somebody push me through the door
I been sleeping on the floor
Thirty-one flavors, listen to the neighbors 
Through the wall
At a debutante ball

Cumba lada vista!
Got a Mona Lisa!

So much for the late rent
Cause your money's spent
And it's cold inside
But just like that Barenaked Ladies' song
I'm hot like wasabi when I'm next to your body

All I want to do
Is stay till early in the morning
You know I love you baby
And all I've got to say, yeah
Is your love's extra ordinary
You're extra ordinary, baby

Ain't love such a sweet thing!
Ain't love such a sweet thing!

Con fuego, baby ...

All I want to do
Is stay till early in the morning
You know I love you baby
And all I've got to say, yeah
Is your love's extra ordinary
You're extra ordinary, baby
