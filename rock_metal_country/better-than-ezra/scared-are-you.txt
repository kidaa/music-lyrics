Strong hands
Big plans
All reduced to this.
Hard won Freedom
How could you have missed

Scared, are you
You do it on your own
You do it all alone.
We all did.
Scared, are you
Half the lines we make up dear
The best that you can do

Everything you would be
Passed you like a ghost.
And kind words are scarce at best
When you need them most.

Scared, are you
You do it on your own
We all did.
Scared, are you
Half the lines you make up here.
The best that we can do.

Hope brings you luck
Doors open up.
And if you should fall,
I'll catch you dear.
It must be!
It must be!

Scared, are you
Finally on' your own
You do it all alone
We all did
Scared, are you
Half the lines you make up dear.
The best that we can do
And we do
