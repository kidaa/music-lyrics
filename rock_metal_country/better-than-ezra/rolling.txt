feat. Toddy

Rain drops bead again
They make a tide pool
On your summer skin

Shoplifting corner store
I should have got,
Should have got some more.

How'd you get so low
How'd you get so low
Baby I don't know.

God, how you look the same.
I recognize the face,
But not the name.

Pull over, never stop
A caramel-colored girl in a halter top.

How'd you get so low
How'd you get so low
She said

Me and you 
Got a lot to do.
We go rolling
From Friday till Sunday noon.
Stop! Start a letter,
Rent-A-Saint in back
Want to hit the interstate in a Cadillac,
And we're rolling.

Could it be that hard
To never mind the rent
And then quit your job

Flying, at what cost
Shout outs to the ones we've lost.

How'd you get so low
How'd you get so low

Don't mind me.  Me  I'm fine.
I just get a little lost sometimes.
But what I really meant to say,
I couldn't live without you another day.

How'd you get so low
How'd you get so low
She said

Me and you
Got a lot to do.
We go rolling
From Friday till Sunday noon.
Stop! Start a letter,
Rent-A-Saint in back
Want to hit the interstate in a Cadillac,
And we're rolling.

Are you just worried to see me
Are you just worried to need me

Me and you
Got a lot to do.
We go rolling
>From Friday till Sunday noon.
Stop! Start a letter,
Rent-A-Saint in back
Want to hit the interstate in a Cadillac,
And we're rolling.
Yeah, we're rolling.
Me and you, we're rolling.

On a Sunday afternoon.

Yeah...
