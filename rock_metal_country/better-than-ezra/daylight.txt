You're a long walk in a rain storm
You're a cut that refuses to heal
You're a dull ache that I can't shake
You're a cold that's clogging up my head
Or a broke watch keeping time still
Till you pull me in pull me in
And I can't fight 

If the night is cold
And you're feeling old
And the morning cuts you
Like a knife
And you're wearing thin
Feel you're giving in
In the darkest hour of the night
You find daylight

You're a stalled car in the desert
You're a song I can't get off my mind
And in a dire strait
With no hope at all in sight
You come rushing in rushing in
With a lifeline

If the night is cold
And you're feeling old
And the morning cuts you
Like a knife
And you're wearing thin
Feel you're giving in
In the darkest hour of the night
You find daylight

Pull me closer to your breast
I need you finally I confess
I'm drifting I'm drifting
I love you but I hate you too
God only knows what I could do
I'm drifting I'm drifting

Come on give me one reason
Come on find me in daylight
Come on give me one reason
Come on find me in daylight

If the night is cold
And you're feeling old
And the morning cuts you
Like a knife
And you're wearing thin
Feel you're giving in
In the darkest hour of the night
You find daylight
You'll find daylight
