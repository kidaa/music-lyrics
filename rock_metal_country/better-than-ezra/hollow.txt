Well they say your life was marked
And you were wondering if it would ever start
Stop

Sunlight on a razor blade
Three different souls 
And the lives they made
I grew up in the 80's 
In the pallisades
I was listening to Devo

And everybody catered to their needs
All voted most likely to succeed
Holly came out
And Billy got paid
But Jenny got pregnant the first time she got laid

All my rage
Sits inside
When even the finest things
Are leaving you hollow
And all my days
Left behind
And even the finest things
Are leaving you hollow

Cut to an interior view
Holly married well but so did you
One was black one was blue
I was watching the days go by
Could you be seen in a silly dream
Where Billy lives on Prozac and nicotine
Holly got her GED living in maternity
Nursing her broken heart for the love she lost

All my rage
Sits inside
When even the finest things
Are leaving you hollow
And all my days
Left behind
And even the finest things
Are leaving you hollow

And the sky is blue
And so are you
Mary takes a drag off a cigarette
And the stereo is coming up behind her
Like she needs someone to remind her
That life is richer in a minor key
Bill and Holly disagree
But I don't think so

All my rage
Sits inside
When even the finest things
Are leaving you hollow
And all my days
Left behind
And even the finest things
Are leaving you hollow

Sunlight on a razor blade 
Three different souls and the lives they made
Well Holly came out and Billy got paid
But Jenny got pregnant the first time she got laid
