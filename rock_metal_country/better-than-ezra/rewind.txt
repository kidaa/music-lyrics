Cut a tape of my favorite songs
Said what I can't face to face
I hoped that you would share all my thoughts 
We are young and unimpressed, with all you'd recognize.

So play it all over
Turn it wide.
Now there is nothing but a
Mix tape left behind
Now it won't rewind

In my car we are superstars
Run your lipstick down your chin
While up ahead we saw such a crash 
Right there a song became a soundtrack for this space in time.

So play it all over
Turn it wide.
Now there is nothing but a
Mix tape left behind
Now it won't rewind

Wonder is often lost
Jaded at such a cost
Time undermines you when you close your eyes.
We pass right by you.

So play it all over
Turn it wide.
Now there is nothing but a
Mix tape left behind
Now it won't rewind.
