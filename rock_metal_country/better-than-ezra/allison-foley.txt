"CALMLY, LIKE A RAZOR
I GOT US ON THE DOOR,"
OR "I GOT A TAPE OF 'CLERKS'
SOMEONE LEFT THE NIGHT BEFORE." 

SO I GO OVER LATER,
YOU'RE SITTING IN THAT CHAIR
SMOKING ON YOUR CIGARETTE
FINGERING YOU HAIR 

SO I GET DRUNK AND STONED, 
EVERY TIME YOU COME AROUND. 

TWENTY-NINE AND AIMLESS
YOU BARTEND DOWN ON FOURTH
YOUR PARENTS PAY INSURANCE
AND THE PARSON'S AUDIT COURSE

OVER-SCHOOLED AND UNINSPIRED
A TRUST FUND UP YOUR NOSE
ALL THAT WASTED TALENT BUT, UH
AIN'T THAT HOW IT ALWAYS GOES 

SO I GET DRUNK AND STONED, 
EVERY TIME YOU COME AROUND. 
YEAH, YEAH YEAH 

SO LONG ALISON FOLEY 
SO LONG, BYE-BYE 

COME UP HIGHER, TAKE A STEP HIGHER
SOMETIMES YOU UNDERSTAND
THE REASONS HOW YOU WENT ASTRAY
BUT LEAST OF ALL THE ANSWER, 
THAT IT HURTS TO WATCH YOU WASTE AWAY. 

SO I GET DRUNK AND STONED, 
EVERY TIME YOU COME AROUND. 
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. 

SO LONG, ALISON FOLEY 
SO LONG, BYE-BYE
