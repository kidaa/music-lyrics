I am bending
Made of steel
I am stumbling 
Towards something real
How can you forget this feeling
Of standing straight while the world is reeling?

Don't leave me here alone
You're as close as it gets to home

Don't look down 
You might fall
Life made rookies of us all
In our finest year
Don't wait up 
We'll be fine
Somehow we might get it right
In our finest year

I am hopeful
Full of doubt
And I am trying to work this whole thing out
So how can you just sit there sleeping
When your worlds on fire
And your chest is beating?

And I want to think you feel the same

Don't look down 
You might fall
Life made rookies of us all
In our finest year
Don't wait up 
We'll be fine
Somehow we might get it right
In our finest year

In this moment
While you're breathing
If the future leaves you needing
Will you be the one who stayed?
As your life just slipped away?

Don't leave me here alone
You're as close as it gets to home 

I'll be there if you fall
Love made suckers of us all

Don't look down 
You might fall
Life made rookies of us all
In our finest year
Don't wait up 
We'll be fine
Somehow we might get it right
In our finest year
