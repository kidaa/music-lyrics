A Low 

I push the limits of good taste 
Whenever I open my mouth 
You got a worn in your ear 
Like Chekou from Kahn 

Shame! Shame! 
I hit a new kind of low 

All the way from south Dakota 
I like a green leprechaun 
She got a sun dress in heat 
He got his latex gloves on 

Shame! Shame! 
I hit a new kind of low 

And if you ever come here 
You're tweaking on the phone 
"I got a new connection" 
I never leave the light on 

Shame! Shame! 
I hit a new kind of low... 

B Coma 

All the time 
A loss 
Black like you were blessed 
I was sobered blind 
Let you take me there 
And laughed loud when they found 
I was devoured, devoured 
Devoured
