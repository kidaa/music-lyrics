WE'RE ALL A SCENE IN MONA'S DREAM...

A PARIS STREET.
A QUIET STREAM.
FAR AWAY FROM CABRINI GREEN.
FORGOTTEN LOVE AT SEVENTEEN,
WHERE HER CHILDREN GOT A CHANCE,
NOT A DEAD END STREET.

CAUSE SOME GOT RELIGION,
AND SOME GOT DRUGS,
SOME GOT MONEY AND,
SOME GOT LOVE,

ALL OF HER DAYS IN A DRY-EYED HAZE,
JUST ANOTHER SCENE IN MONA'S DREAM.
