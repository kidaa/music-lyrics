Will you fight for the cause?
Can you teach the savage mind, their ways are wrong, 
Help them see what they want and what they need?
And if we have to twist their arms,
They know not what they do is wrong.

[To Chorus:]
And if you said I would go to heaven 
Now, maybe I'll try.
And if you said I would go to heaven
Now, maybe I'll try.

Heretics and hypocrites,
Wear the same face through the years.
Telling lies and laying blame.
Damn the fire to feed the flame.
Don't dance or sing or try to think,
They're images planted in your head.

[To Chorus:]
And if you said I would go to heaven 
Now, maybe I'll try.
And if you said I would go to heaven
Now, maybe I'll try.

Ivy is just a dog
With a heart that's noble as
The greatest man who ever lived.
Won't you please help her learn?
And if we have to twist her arms,
She knows not what she does is wrong.

[To Chorus:]
And if you said I would go to heaven 
Now, maybe I'll try.
And if you said I would go to heaven
Now, maybe I'll try.

And if you said I'll be a rich man...
