Listen to them fight.
Hear your mother cry.
Weekend at your dad's.
They don't know what they do to you.
Teenager. Teenager...

Wrap yourself in black.
Listen to the Cure.
Love line won't call back.
They don't know,
they don't care,
they don't see,
but I do.

[To Chorus:]
And if it feels good do it.
And if it tastes fine drink.
Well, there's a range of possibilities to find.
Teenager. Teenager...

No one knows your name.
No one hears your cry.
Fall in with the fringe
because they know what you're going through.
They do.

[To Chorus:]
And if it feels good do it.
And if it tastes fine drink.
Well, there's a range of possibilities to find.
Teenager. Teenager...

[BRIDGE:]
No one's wrong,
no one's right.
It comes down on you.
And I have found, your life inside mine.

Hear your mother cry
Fade into the night.
When they ask you why,
They won't know, they won't feel,
They won't see,
But you will.

[To Chorus:]
And if it feels good do it.
And if it tastes fine drink.
Well, there's a range of possibilities to find.
Teenager. Teenager...
