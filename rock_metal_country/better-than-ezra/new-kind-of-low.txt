[A LOW]

I PUSH THE LIMITS OF GOOD TASTE
WHENEVER I OPEN MY MOUTH
YOU GOT A WORM IN YOUR EAR
LIKE CHECKOV FROM KAHN

SHAME! SHAME!
I HIT A NEW KIND OF LOW.

ALL THE WAY FROM SOUTH DAKOTA
LIKE A GREEN LEPRACHAUN
SHE GOT A SUN DRESS IN HEAT
HE GOT HIS LATEX GLOVES ON

SHAME! SHAME!
I HIT A NEW KIND OF LOW.

AND IF YOU EVER COME HERE
YOU'RE TWEAKING ON THE PHONE
"I GOT A NEW CONNECTION"
I NEVER LEAVE THE LIGHT ON

SHAME! SHAME!
I HIT A NEW KIND OF LOW...

[B COMA]

ALL THE TIME,
A LOSS.
BLACK LIKE YOU WERE BLESSED,
I WAS SOBERED BLIND.
LET YOU TAKE ME THERE
AND LAUGHED LOUD WHEN THEY FOUND
I WAS DEVOURED. DEVOURED.
DEVOURED.
