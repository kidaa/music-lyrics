And though you will say I'm wrong.
It's much easier with you along.
Sundays were made for this.
Seeing Bond give the villain a kiss ....

Holding your face in the glow
Play on, play on
Happy endings

I thought that you'd like to know.
I'm finally letting her go.
You always said, "Tell me when
You're ready at last to begin."

Learning to chance it again.
Play on, play on
Happy endings

So let them all dissolve
And welcome a new resolve
Here's where the credits run.
Riding off into the sun

And love is real
Reading your eyes in the glow
Play on, play on
Happy endings
