Here we go

I got with somebody's date
You're like a Soap Opera cover
My lover self-automates
Juicy

You say a-somebody say
You're like a salve for a leper
You're sweet for somebody's pain
Juicy
Aw, Juicy

Yeah, you got to live for your own
You say you got all the sordid details
Check-out retail
Watch it sell
Juicy
Aw, Juicy

I Gotta Delay

Mothers, children on the street
Can't get enough to eat
Off the record
Dishes fly
Don't know the reason why
Meet me in the check out stand
See who can be the lover man
Conscience bleeding in a song
Guilty as the day is long
Goodbye

Yeah, you got to live for your own
You say you got all the sordid details
Check-out retail
Watch it sell
I got to see that lie
You say what you're going to say
You got to know it's a bitter poison
Sapping all of your soul away

Yeah, Juicy
Juicy
