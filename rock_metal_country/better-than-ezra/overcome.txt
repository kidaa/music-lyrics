North light comes uninvited
Through the window to where you lie
Disjointed, dust and silence
Quite at a loss

I feel strange
I feel changed
I feel strange
Overcome
Overcome by you

I fell in too deep
But I learned to swim
In an undertow
I sense I'm giving in

I feel strange
I feel changed
I feel strange
Overcome
Overcome 

I'm a little bit wiser
I'm a little bit sadder
I'm a little bit less you might have guessed
But if you could be staying
Tell me now darling I think I'm fading
I swear I'll never trade your life for a lie

I feel strange
I feel changed
I feel strange
Overcome
Overcome by you

Overcome by you
