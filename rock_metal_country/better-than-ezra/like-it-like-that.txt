THAT CALLING FROM THAT PORCH AGAIN
LOW DRESS BLOWING IN THE WIND
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN I'D REGRET IT LATER
BUT SHE BLOW LIKE A TSUNAMI

I LIKE IT LIKE THAT
I LIKE IT LIKE THAT 
I LIKE IT LIKE THAT 

TERRA COTTA, WINDOW PANE 
BROWN SKIN SOAKING UP THE RAIN 
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN A CYNICAL WRITER 
BUT SHE DON'T CARE JUST WHERE HE BE 

I LIKE IT LIKE THAT 
I LIKE IT LIKE THAT 
I LIKE IT LIKE THAT 

SHE CAN MOVE YOU! 
SHE CAN MOVE YOU! 
WHAT'S YOUR NAME 
DESTINY. 

I LIKE IT LIKE THAT
I LIKE IT LIKE THAT 
I LIKE IT LIKE THAT
