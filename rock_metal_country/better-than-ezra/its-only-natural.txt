Girl, your daddy's knocking on your door
I hear your footsteps on the floor to me
Stumbling back to your room

Pain it is a thing I can't explain
I only feel it when you go away
I'm waiting for you to return

Don't fight it if it feels good
Don't fight it girl
You hide it but you never should
Don't hide
Don't listen to voices in your head
What are you and me but monkeys in a tree?
It's only natural
Na-na-na-na natural

Hey, I know your mother's off at work
You say your daddy's such a jerk to you 
Why can't they just all fade away

Girl, is that the way it's going to be?
I'm only happy when you're down on me
You can be my honeybee

Don't fight it if it feels good
Don't fight it girl
You hide it but you never should
Don't hide it
Don't listen to voices in your head
What are you and me but monkeys in a tree?
It's only natural
Na-na-na-na natural

Don't fight it if it feels good
Don't fight it girl
You hide it but you never should
Don't hide
Don't listen to voices in your head
What are you and me but monkeys in a tree?
It's only natural
It's only natural
It's only natural
Na-na-na-na natural
don't fight it girl
It's only natural
don't hide it
Is it the colour of your hair?
Is it the silly way you stare?
don't fight it girl
It's only natural
Na-na-na-na natural
