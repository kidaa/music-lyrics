I WROTE A THREE PAGE NOTE
SO I COULD ASK YOU WHY YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE
DISREGARD THE PRETENSE THAT YOU MADE.
COME ALIVE, COME ALIVE, WATCH THE CITY GO BY.
TURN ME UP, TURN ME UP, TURN ME UP, TURN ME UP, TURN ME UP

YOUR FACE IS CREASED BY THE PILLOW CASE SHEETS,
THE BEDROOM IS A MESS.
CAN I GET SOME ROOM SERVICE PLEASE
ARE YOU LUCID DRUG INDUCED
THROUGH BLOODSHOT EYES THE CITY COME ALIVE,COME ALIVE,COME ALIVE.

AH, HOW WONDERFUL YOU ARE!
AH, HOW WONDERFUL YOU ARE!

OUTSIDE, YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE BORN WITH A KICK-ME SIGN 
TAPED PERMANENTLY TO YOUR BACK.
I CAN RELATE, VIDEO TAPE,
YOU GOT A LAUGH WHEN YOU FELL FACE FIRST ON THE FLOOR.

AH, HOW WONDERFUL YOU ARE!
AH, HOW WONDERFUL YOU ARE!

ARE YOU LISTENING
ARE YOU BREATHING
GIVE ME SOMETHING, I CAN BELIEVE IN,
BECAUSE YOU GIVE ME SOUL
ILLUMINATING EVERYTHING!
AW, PUSH IT BOY, PUSH IT LIKE YOU NEVER SHOULD. 

UNDERSTATE.
YOU WERE GREAT,
SUMMERING OUT ON THE CAPE.
I SAID LAST NIGHT HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU,
BUT YOU WOULDN'T RECALL NO,
YOU DON'T RECALL ANYTHING DO YOU

AH, HOW WONDERFUL YOU ARE
AH, HOW WONDERFUL YOU ARE
