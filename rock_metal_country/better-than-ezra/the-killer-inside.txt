Well, she believes that I'd be better off without her.
And she believes in me.

Well, she believes that time can make things right.
And I want to believe that there's been a change in me.

[Chorus:]
And I hope that she believes.
Yes, I wonder if she sees the killer inside me.

The lights go down
And the clouds are building outside.
You close the door and turn the key,
But there's no place to hide.

[Chorus:]
And I hope that she believes.
Yes, I wonder if she sees the killer inside me.

The killer inside me.
The killer inside me.
The killer inside...
