DON'T FEAR,
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE AT A LOSS.
I'M NUMB,
A SHELL OF EMPTY THOUGHTS.
BUT YOU GLOW,
YOU STRETCH AND PULL ME OUT.
DOES THAT TROUBLE YOU
DOES THAT TROUBLE YOU

[CHORUS:]
LOVE ME 
HATE ME 
MAKE ME LIVE AGAIN 
I NEED YOU AROUND

HEAL ME
HURT ME
MAKE ME LIVE AGAIN
I WANT YOU AROUND 

SO LONG,
I NEVER HAD EXPERIENCED
THIS BLISS.
SO HOW COULD I RESIST
AND I'M FINE
A LITTLE LIGHT-HEADED.
DOES THAT WORRY YOU
I DIDN'T MEAN TO WORRY YOU.

[CHORUS:]

NOW, RETREATING FROM THE LIGHT
I LOVE IT WHEN WE FIGHT
IT MAKES ME THINK
AT LEAST YOU STILL CARE

GIVE UP, YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE
MOONLIGHT, ILLUMINATES YOUR STARE
AND IT'S GREAT, CAPTIVATING YOU
DOES THAT TROUBLE YOU
I DIDN'T MEAN TO TROUBLE YOU 

[CHORUS & FADE]
