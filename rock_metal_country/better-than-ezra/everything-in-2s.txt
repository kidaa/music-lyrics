CUT ME OUT OF THIS ROLE.
I CAN'T PLAY IT ANYMORE.
IT MUST BE SOMETHING IN THE WATER HERE.

GIVE ME UP,
I CONFESS.
I FEEL AS THOUGH I'M LIVING LESS.
THE STRANGEST GRAVITY AFFECTS MY WAY.
BECAUSE I WAS BORN INCOMPLETE,
DROWNING IN THE BREVITY.
KIND OF LIKE A ROAD YOU'RE TRAVELLING ON.

[CHORUS:]
EVERYTHING IN 2'S
YOU OFTEN LOSE
YOU MAKE ME WHOLE AGAIN
EVERYTHING IN 2'S
YOU NEVER KNEW
YOU'D MAKE ME WHOLE AGAIN.

SOMEONE SAID, SOMEONE WROTE,
WE'RE FLOATING TETHERED TO A ROPE.
SO COMPLICATE ME,
I COULD USE THE WEIGHT.
IN HOW YOU MOVE THE SCENERY,
LOVER, HOW YOU MIRROR ME.
BUT STOP ME IF YOU'VE HEARD IT ALL BEFORE.

[CHORUS:]

AND NOW AND AGAIN,
YOU FIND YOURSELF OVER YOUR HEAD.
IN A CYNICAL TIME, IN YOU I FIND
A REASON TO LIVE.

[CHORUS:]

CUT ME OUT OF THIS ROLE
I CAN'T PLAY IT ANYMORE
IT MUST BE SOMETHING IN THE WATER HERE.
