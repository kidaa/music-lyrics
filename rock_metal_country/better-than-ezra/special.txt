Are you real?
Are you real or just a dream?
It's been so long, I don't know.
I can feel. I can feel you here with me.
Even though you're far away.

Some are special.
They come back, racing through your mind.
You were special.
Your light, your heat
Will never die.

I was lost.
I was lost and I found you.
I will know no further love.
People move.
People move and fall away,
Love, you refuse to fade.

Some are special.
They come back, racing through your mind.
You were special.
Your light, your heat
Will never die.
So regretful, how could I ever be so blind.
You were special.
I thought I'd never lose my mind.

I was pulling far away.
You were begging me to stay.
And I thought I was losing you.
Funny, how the opposite was true.

Some are special.
They come back, racing through your mind.
You were special.
Your light, your heat
Will never die.
So regretful, how could I ever be so blind.
You were special.
I thought I'd never lose my mind.

Some are special.
