Wake me up
Slap my face
Draw me closer in
To your embrace

Cause nobody wants to be the butt of every joke
And nobody wants to be the one to pull the rope
So you harden your shell
Slowly losing yourself

And now I'm close
But not touching
And I'm cold
But not freezing
And I'm only alive
Only alive
Briefly

Can you feel
Could you love
Are you further now from where you started
I bet you do enough just to get by
Don't you

Cause nobody wants to be the butt of every joke
And nobody wants to be the one who's full of hope
And a cop's light goes by
And the moon lights the night

And now I'm close
But not touching
And I'm cold
But not freezing
And I'm only alive
Only alive
Briefly

And you're a starlight that shines
For a moment in time
In time
