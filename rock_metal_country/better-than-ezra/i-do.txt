I got a little bit of reason
For everything I've done
I might just serenade the moonlight

And I get so lonely in this crowd
I want to scream but make no sound
And yeah I'm lost but maybe I'll be fine

Cause when I'm in over my head
I hear the words you said
That someone out there's 
Listening to the same song
Feeling the same way that I do
Make me a believer pick up the receiver
And tell me you feel just like I do
I do

And I couldn't bear to see you walk out
And leave it all behind
I couldn't bear to see the sunlight

And I love the sound of rain on tin
Your screen door beckoning me in
And yeah I'm mad but overcome with joy

Could it be so damn naive
To hope you could agree?
That someone out there's
Listening to the same song
Feeling the same way that I do
Make me a believer pick up the receiver
Tell me you feel just like I do
I do

In a world that's cellophane
You get so lost I know you do
In a world that's cellophane

Someone out there's
Listening to the same song
Feeling the same way that I do
Make me a believer pick up the receiver
Tell me you feel just like I do
I do
Someone out there's
Listening to the same song
Feeling the same way that I do
Make me a believer pick up the receiver
And tell me you feel just like I do
I do
