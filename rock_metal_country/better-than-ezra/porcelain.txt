Hey, you've got a lot of nerve to show your face around here.
Hey, you've got a lot of nerve to dredge up all my fears.
Well, I wish I could shake some sense into you and walk out the door.

[To Chorus:]
But your skin is like porcelain.
Yeah, your skin is like porcelain.

Just the other day I felt I had you by a string.
Just the other day I felt we could be everything.
But now when I see you, you're somebody else.
In somebody's eyes and your skin...

[To Chorus:]
But your skin is like porcelain.
Yeah, your skin is like porcelain.

[BRIDGE:]
I don't know what I'm saying.
Well, I don't know if you're there.
In the words you are feigning.
Do you even care

Well I wish I could kill you, 
savor the sight.
Get in to my car, drive into the night.
Then lie as I scream to the heavens above.
That I was the last one you ever loved. 
Yes, your skin is like porcelain.

[To Chorus:]
But your skin is like porcelain.
Yeah, your skin is like porcelain.
