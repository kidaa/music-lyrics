I still remember you dressed in grey.
Working undercover for the CIA
You were cursing Silber living in Back Bay
Sailing on the Charles when I heard you say

Let's go down to Normal Town
Right now
Down,Down,down

I washed you lover and scrubbed your face
Running from Miss Porter's you showed up one day
From a flat in South End where you made me strong
You said, "We're burning out at both ends."
So I came along.

Let's go down to Normal Town
Right now
Down,down,down

Hey! Wouldn't it be great to never worry about your future never asking why
Hey! Hey In a subdivision watching television and our lives go by.

Let's go down to Normal Town. Let's go down to Normal Town. Right now

Down,down,down ....
