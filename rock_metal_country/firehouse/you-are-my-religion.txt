I

I want no other one, dear, but you.
I only hope that you'll want me, too.
Till then life will be so lonely
And only your love will make my dreams come true.

I want to feel your lips close to mine;
I long to know that moment divine.
And I swear by stars above
That my love will not die; no other love have I.

Instrumental interlude

I want to feel your lips close to mine;
I long to know that moment divine.
And I swear by stars above
That my love will not die; no other live have I.
