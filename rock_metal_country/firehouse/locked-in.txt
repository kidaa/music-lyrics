Keeper of the Talisman of miraculous, virtues and powers
Greedy alchemist with inhuman knowledge endowed
Chosen initiate guardian of the unknown grialic plants
Prepare the elixir for immortality and rebirth
Open the portal to the astral gates of science
Mental illumination drunk from the golden chalice
Gaucuma, key to clairvoyance
Muchamor, shaman's mushroom with mystic visions of truth
Honda, for the sacred delirious healing rites
Ayakuasa, death liane of the sorcerers
Yage, to see through walls and rocks
Guanata, sweet coma to the journey of no return
The secret of divinity lives in this spell
The laws of creation now in my hands
Nature speaks to me in her occult tongue
Reveals to me the keys of her sacred entity
Etherial energies, the principle of life
I am the only mortal with the solar eye...
The third Eye!
Little by little the spiral takes its form
A vortex of magic sucks me to the core...!
