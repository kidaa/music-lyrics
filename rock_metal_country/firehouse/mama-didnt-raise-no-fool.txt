Make it right
Make it right

You've been on my mind
'Cause the last words I said
Felt so wrong ,so unkind
No one's to blame
But somewhere along the way
I know that something's changed

What was said
And what was done
Is not the way of love
Just look what we've become

Chorus:
Feel me touch you tenderly
I'm makin' an apology
Please hold me close tonight
Make it right
Can we try to love once more
And make it like it was before
I need you by my side

Make it right
Make it right

As we close our eyes
Can you hear me prayin'
How can lovers be so blind
It hurts me so, just don't know
That we could fall again
Help me understand

Can we forgive
Can we compromise
Just believe that we can
Leave it all behind
We can get to where
We feel good inside
Open up our hearts
And keep this love alive

Chorus

Make it right
Make it right
Ooh make it right for me, babe
Make it right

Are we gonna Make it right
We can see it See it in our eyes
Can we do it Do you wanna try
Don't you know I
I'll always love you, baby
Give a listen
Listen to the words I'm sayin'
Tell you that it's
It's only love we're makin'
All you gotta Ooh

Chorus

Make it right
I'm touchin' you so tenderly
Please hold me close tonight
Never let me go Make it right
Can we try to love once more
And make it like it was before
I need you by my side
Make it right

Chorus

Make it right
