Barricades and brickwalls won't keep me
from you
You can tie me down on the railroad
track
You can let that freight train lose
Iron bars and big ole cars
Won't run me out of town
I'll be damned if you're not my man
Before the sun goes down

You can chain me down
On the edge of town
You can leave me there to die
But the railroad track

Will bring me back
When the lonesome whistle cries
You can lock me out
You can scream and shout
You can try to change your name
But by the end of the day
I'll take you away
Like a force 10 hurricane
