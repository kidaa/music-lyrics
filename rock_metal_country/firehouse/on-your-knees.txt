Who'll save the poor little girl
Henry Darger, Henry Darger
Who'll save the poor little girl
Henry, Henry
Oh Henry Oh
Henry, Henry

Who'll tell the story of her
Henry Darger, Henry Darger
Who'll tell it to all the world
Henry, Henry
Oh Henry Oh
Henry, Henry

Who'll buy the carbon paper now
Henry Darger, Henry Darger
Who'll trace the lines of her mouth
Henry, Henry
Oh Henry Oh
Henry, Henry

Who will conquer foreign worlds searching for the stolen girls
Princesses you'll never fear the patron saint of girls is here!
Who will draw the cavalry in and risk his very own precious skin
To make our Angelinia a free and beautiful land again
Henry

Who'll love a poor orphan child
Henry Darger, Henry Darger
Lost, growing savage and wild
Henry, Henry
Oh Henry Oh
Henry, Henry..
