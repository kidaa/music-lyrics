Photograph tell me this
What I see in a kiss
Fireworks can't explain
Why I wrap my heart around this flag of pain
One by one
They kiss me on the head
Soldiers drinking wine and body bread
Two by two
Who understands the blues
Flowing down in a long sea of red
Silver cup full of wine
Don't be fooled by the shine
Drink it up
It'll make you high
Just remember when it's time to say goodbye
