I am the Ghost of Evil
I am the Sadness
I can take you into Death
I can see how life dissolves

Temple of innocence
Smells stolen from gods
Footmarks on the cold floor

I pain Charon the promised coins
Don't ever mind power and reign
Now they are coming
Life leaves you

Song of Sadness
Song of Blackness
Black Matter
