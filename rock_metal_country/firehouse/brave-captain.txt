Wake up in the morning
Always rushing around
Trying not to be late again
Cause it's no time to slow down

I'm sick and tired of the same thing everyday
Same old song the radio always plays
I think I need some time away
But there's no place to go now

I want to run away
Leave it all behind
We only have one life to live
And it's your life so go on

When the world gets the best of me
All I need is a little company
To put me back on my feet
I hit so hard when I fall down

Sometimes I feel like I just can't go on
There's nothing left to keep me hanging on
At the end of everyday
All I want to do is run away

It's your life so go on
It's your life so be strong
It's your life run away

Leave it all behind
We only have one life to live
And it's your life so go on run away

Make your dreams come true
We only have one life to live
And it's your life
So go on, it's your life, so be strong
Run away
