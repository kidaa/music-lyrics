Who says a man's not suppose to be
Sensitive
I'm keeping the faith that you still love me

Girl I know there's something wrong
And something strange is going on
And no matter what I do
Wanna can't break through

Girl I need to understand
Cuz you won't give me answers
How can I help you
If you don't want me to

I never hear you laugh
I never see you cry
Never heard you say you need a love like mine
See I'm giving you everything that's inside
But you need to fill me up
Cuz you're not playing with the flame
Girl you won't get burned
You know that's not the kind of thing I do
I guess I need to get what I give
What can I say girl I'm sensitive

Ain't nobody out to control
You or what you stand for
Baby girl I really need to know
Do or don't you want this love

Won't you help me understand
Girl I really need some answers
How can I help you
If you don't want me to

I never hear you laugh
I never see you cry
Never heard you say you need a love like mine
See I'm giving you everything that's inside
But you need to fill me up
Cuz you're not playing with the flame
Girl you won't get burned
You know that's not the kind of thing I do
I guess I need to get what I give
What can I say girl I'm sensitive

Sensitive
Who says a man's not suppose to be
Sensitive
I'm keeping the faith that you still love me
Sensitive
Baby I'm not ashamed to be
Sensitive

Baby I love you
But is it time to let you go
I don't know where we are girl
And you won't let me know

I never hear you laugh
I never see you cry
Never heard you say you need a love like mine
See I'm giving you everything that's inside
But you need to fill me up
Cuz you're not playing with the flame
Girl you won't get burned
You know that's not the kind of thing I do
I guess I need to get what I give
What can I say girl I'm sensitive
