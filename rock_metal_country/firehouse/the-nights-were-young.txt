And I've made goals I've never meant to break them
and go beyond the outer depths
and stranger things have happened since you've been here
it's been so long since I've seen your face
or even been to this place

This town was cool for one night
early July
childhood friends have all grown up
and I don't think that I can ever remember one time
that this place felt quite like home

And I've lived my life with no regrets
regardless of circumstance or chance I'd have to take
and stranger things have happened since you've been here
it's been so long since I've seen your face
or even been to this place

This town was cool for one night
early July
childhood friends have all grown up
and I don't think that I can ever remember one time
that this place felt quite like home
