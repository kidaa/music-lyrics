How Did We End Up Here?

I let you go, you did just the same
We must have thought that we'd be
Better off that way
Now here we are, free to move on
Searching just to find the love we both
Had all along

After all the words were
Said now
I'm thinking we
Should just be friends

How did we end up here?
Didn't we say godd-bye?
I guess it took breaking up
to make us realize
How did we end up here?
I thought we couldn't work it out?
It seems the circle of love
Brought us back around

We acted strong, we thought
We tired our best
To save what we had,
By giving up on all the rest
It all just seems so clear,
At least at the time
Convincing ourselves, we were
Just doing what was right

After all those talks together
Thought we gave up on forever

Sometimes the truest lies
Are the ones we tell ourselves
The very last time, we said good-bye
Inside we meant don't go

How did we end up here?
