Take me back to an easy life
Robin Hood and Marian
A lone ranger on a silver horse
Make believe in a box of sand
Bang, bang, we all fall down
Just about dinner time
I'm eatin' bullets: come on Fury
Take me for a ride
Rocking Horse: Rocking Horse
Rocking Horse: Rocking Horse
Sun down with a chorus girl
Ragtime and whiskey pour
Midnight in a rented room
With a key inside the bedroom door
Bang, bang, we all fall down
Just about out of my mind
Come on Lily: come on honey
Take me for a ride
Rocking Horse: Rocking Horse
Rocking Horse: Rocking Horse
Last chance for an easy life
Double down and let it ride
Lone ranger with a silver bullet
For the one arm man inside
Bang, bang, we all fall down
Just about run out of time
Come on seven: come on eleven
Take me for a ride
Rocking Horse: Rocking Horse
Rocking Horse: Rocking Horse
