I've got nothing
Left for you to take away
I know you blame me
For every time you walked away
So what you hate me
And everything I seem to do
So look back
Don't turn away
It was my face that you
Were lying to

And in our lives
We could find
Everything just separates
And in my live
You could find
Everything you want to take away

So what its not the same
Every word out of your mouth is shit
So look back
Don't turn away
It was my face and I am through with it

Why its all its old
And every part it takes
I know your faith
You give but take another way

So what you hate me
And everything is seem to do
I know that you blame me for everytime
I walk out on you
I've got nothing
