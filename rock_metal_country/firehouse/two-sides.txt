Tonight I wanna give it all to you.
In the darkness. There's so much I wanna do. Yeah.
Tonight I wanna lay by your feet.
'Cause girl, I was made for you and girl, you were made for me.
I was made for lovin' you baby, you were made for lovin' me
and I can't get enough of you baby, can you get enough of me?
I was made for lovin' you baby, you were made for lovin' me
and I can't get enough of you baby, can you get enough of me?
Yeeeaah!!

Tonight I wanna see it in your eyes.
Feel the magic. There's something that drives me wild.
And tonight we're gonna make it all come true.
'Cause girl, I was made for you and girl, you were made for me.
I was made for lovin' you baby, you were made for lovin' me
and I can't get enough of you baby, can you get enough of me?
I was made for lovin' you baby, you were made for lovin' me
and I can't get enough of you baby, can you get enough of me?
Yeeeaah!!

I was made for lovin' you baby, you were made for lovin' me
and I can't get enough of you baby, can you get enough of me?
I was made for lovin' you baby, you were made for lovin' me
and I can't get enough of you baby, can you get enough of me?
Yeeeaah!!
