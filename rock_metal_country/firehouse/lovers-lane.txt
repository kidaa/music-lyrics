I've got blood on my hands,
From this little timid life
It's just like a man,
to trust me with all his might
I've got mud on my feet,
When I kicked you back 3 weeks
If I promised to keep my mouth shut,
can I sit her while you speak
Finally mine, you're finally all mine [x2]
Where did it get me, all mine
What did it teach me, all mine
Somebody stop me,
I'm losing control again
I've got honor to earn
But I guess I lost my turn
When will I learn,
to treat you with concern
Finally mine, you're finally all mine
Where did it get me, all mine
Look what it taught me, all mine
Somebody stop me, I'm losing control
Where did it get me, all mine
Look what it taught me, all mine
Somebody stop me, I'm losing control
All mine
Where did it get me, all mine
Look what it taught me, all mine
Somebody stop me, I'm losing control again
