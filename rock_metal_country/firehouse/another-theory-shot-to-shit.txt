as i walked across the land a thousand faces came before me
and i followed it all the way from the night until the morning

now i feel you in my mind and i feel you in my soul
you can take it all away but i'll never let you go

and if i tell you one thing i want it to be true
and if i say i'm leaving everything you knew
now you can stop believing and start to wonder why
but you can't have it all 'till you leave it all behind

but i walked away from you when i was young and just to get away
but in time you can get through everything must have an ending
so i walked a thousand miles through the sand and stormy weather
just to get to where i am just to get just to get back to you
just to get back to you
