Tell me, is everything unplanned?
It's all so unexpected that I just can't understand
We run so hard and always end up in the same place
";Glad that went so smoothly"; well that never is the case


One day the darkest cloud is bright
Who will shake away the shadows of eternal night
It's just the storm before the calm
Like the life held in your palm - it's clay, one day


And you stand there, with ashes blowing past
Dipping into gilt-edged love that will be made at last
And the gold you spend and the hastening end
That you throw into the sea
Coming back a hundredfold, there's no guarantee


We'll walk and be like giants, we'll all be honest men
I go back to my blindness so that I may see again
A woman standing on a hill is gazing out to sea
Dreaming of a new age waiting there for me
I call her from a distance and she smiles into the sun
And men and gods begin their dance, for their time has begun
And holy wars extended and battlefields of pain
Washed away, forgotten in the perfect rain
Princes, kings and humble things are well-worn and content
Messengers come everywhere, envoys have been sent
";Na na na na, na na na na na
A palm tree nodded at me last night he said
'Hey you look so pale.' ";
