There's a fire in the eastern perimeter
There's an alligator in the stew
And everybody who's going to heaven
Would they kindly stand in this queue


Because there's far too many
And there's much too much
When the news sinks in holding on to our skin
I only want to give you a touch


At the break of day I was breaking
At the fall of night well I fell
Like a fool I wept as the starbeams crept
Illuminating this hell
And there's far too many
And there's much too much
When the news sinks in holding on to our skin
And I only want to give you a touch


Don't ask me if I'm ready
I'm standing with my ticket in hand
When the boss comes back and he looks at this crack
He sure aint gonna understand


And there's far too many
And there's much too much
When the news sinks in holding on to our skin
I only want to give you a touch
