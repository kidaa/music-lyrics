People getting frightened 'cause the night is very thick
When I think about you sister, we need to panic here
You better take an arrow, you better take a sled
When it starts blowing just remember what I said


You gotta freeze until it burns
You gotta burn until you learn
You gotta learn until you seize
You gotta freeze until you burn


People think they're dreaming, they're really wide awake
I did it for the money and for goodness' sake
Meet me in the igloo with a factual gaze
Help me to decipher the shadow of this maze


You gotta freeze until it burns
You gotta burn until you learn
You gotta learn until you seize
And you freeze until you burn


Now look
Fire in the rude banks, eyes inside the grave
Everything is opposite, right now it's too late
When you hear the birdsong stop, when you see the glow
That's the only certainty that you'll ever know


You're gonna freeze until it burns
You're gonna burn until you learn
You're gonna learn until you freeze
Freeze until you burn
OK
You're gonna freeze until it burns
You're gonna burn until you learn
We're gonna love it when you freeze
Freeze until you burn
Alright
