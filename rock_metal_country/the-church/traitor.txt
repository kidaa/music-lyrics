I never understand why you put up your hand
And volunteered to play the company man
You wanna come back you wanna have a crack
But the train is gone - it's never coming back

You should have realized by the ominous skies
That destiny was dealing you a joker old guy
Next time don't come don't pursue that something
You should've known better that you can't come

Every little trend that comes round the bend
Carries you aloft and you're getting soft
Struggles and sports under halogen quartz
One eye on the meter, one eye in the mirror
Its all getting dearer, it's all getting clearer
Come in peace with a sheep to fleece
Lamb noisette ? says she won't forget but
She'll never remember if she is dismembered

Traitor / Never understand / Feel so good / Feel so young

Should've realized by the ominous skies...

Repeat ";Traitor"; and ";Should've realized..."; except for one line saying ";I feel like spring has sprung"; till end
