You're so easy to love
You're so easy to adore
You're easy to want
I always want more.....
The way you talk
It puts me in a dream
Makes me feel like the cat who had the cream

You're so easy to love
You're easy to be with
I'm telling everybody that you must be a gift from higher planes
As a broken soul below I always wanna be living in your glow

You're so easy to love
You're so easy just to like
Don't change a thing
Cos everything's just right....
You fly like a swan
You sing like a bird
I wanna tell you everything
But I can't find the words

You're so easy to love
You're so lovely just to touch
So beautiful to see
I wanna see so much....
Alone in your head
I wonder where you roam
It doesn't really matter if you always come home

You're so easy to love
So nice just to kiss
You're standing in the light
I'm bathing in the bliss
Beautiful as hell
Wonderful as well
Don't you know I'm buying whatever you can sell

You're so easy to love
So easy to be round
Asleep so sweet but with your tiny sleeping sound/hand
I hold you in my arms
I see you in my mind
I need you every day
I need you every night

You're so easy to love
You're so easy to admire
You've got me by the heart
If anyone inquires
You're soft and you're strong
You're cool and your warm
Delicate, intricate, triumph over form

You're so easy to love
You're so crucial to my life
I want you to know
That everything's alright....
The way that you love
It's pure and it's strong
If you stay around
Nothing can go wrong
