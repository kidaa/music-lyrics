The boat goes out, surrender yours
It could be any day
The fishermen shout, approaching storm
It's just like yesterday
Sometimes I can't tell what I'm doin' here
Am I s'pposed to be a clown or a buccanneer
From the vaguest clue to the faintest idea
A Roman holiday
Chorus:Surrender smiles, epiphanies
It's almost every day
And the sea's in my bed
And the moon's in my head

We live in a house upon the hill
Its just a mile away
We look out to sea
Dawn's early light
It chased the night away
Sometimes I can't tell if I'm you or me
Alone in this room with the moon and the sea
Listen to the space where she used to be
Another life awayChorus
