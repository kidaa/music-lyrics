Have I told you 'bout the case of the man who had no face? 
I'm sure I have
His wife suspected something, that's why she brought me in
We arranged to meet one night at a bar called Aphrodite's
On second street
But when I looked into her eyes I very quickly realized 
The danger
The price was right, a deal was struck
I don't think that she gave it a thought
It was plain to see
That the lady was loveblind
It was clear to see
It was clear that she was loveblind

Out into the foggy night, into the city's blurry light 
I drove alone
I wondered then what kind of place would make a man lose face
I pieced together clue by clue just what a faceless man would do
It wasn't hard
Who would he love, where would he go, places faceless men would know
On second street
I was close, I was near, but that woman just wouldn't hear
It was plain to see
That the lady was loveblind
It was clear to see
It was clear that she was loveblind
Loveblind
Next morning came as mornings do, I had a shave it was close too
A close shave
In the mirror in my space, there was a man without a face
I rang my client and I banged on her door
I told her it was me that we was looking for
It was plain to see


That the lady was loveblind
It was clear to see
It was clear that she was loveblind
