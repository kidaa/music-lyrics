Don't open the door to strangers
Don't let them in, to your heart
They only want to take you far from me
Don't open the door tonight

Don't trust the man in the windows
Don't let him buy all your dreams
He only wants to make them all his own
Don't open the door tonight

See the angry sea, it's a sign for me
There's another shore, what we waiting for
Feel the wind is sad, all the things I had
Blown away and falling around me

Don't leave your thoughts unguarded
Don't let them float where they will
They never tell me what I want to know
Don't open the door tonight
