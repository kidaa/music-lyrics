It was only seven years ago
Your mirror finally broke
Your little bunch of followers turned you into a fool
The butt of all their vicious jokes, screaming

You're still beautiful baby
Nobody can take that away
You're still beautiful baby
Even when you fall down that way

You turned up backstage at the palace
We thought you was wearing a mask
I felt so fucking embarrassed
When you looked at your reflection and asked, you askedAre you still beautiful baby
Nobody can take that away
You're still beautiful baby
Baby don't believe what you see 

Once upon a time I would have killed for you
I'm sorry that you got in this mess
But you're the walking picture of Dorian Gray
At least it's artistic I guess
