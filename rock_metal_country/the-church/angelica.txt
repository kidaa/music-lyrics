Stretching out to catch the slender message


Angelica I want you x8


Crashing down
Crashing down
Crashing down in a shower of sparks
Crashing down
Crashing down
Crashing down in a shower of sparks


The civilized gentleman
The civilized gentleman
The civilized gentleman is gonna be nice
The civilized gentleman
The civilized gentleman
The civilized gentleman isn't gonna be nice
To you tonight
To you tonight
To you tonight unless you pay me
Pay me good
Pay me well
Pay me with a trip to hell


She reaches for him in a jealous moment x3

And I'll share it
My tongue is wet
My tongue is wet
This verbal caress is gonna get wet


Angelica I want you x4
