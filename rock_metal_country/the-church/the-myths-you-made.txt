When the failing light
With the feeling's gone feeling's gone
I'll ask you twice tonight
To make sure I'm wrong sure I'm
Still you looked to fold in two behind the shade
Are you lying there in wait


Here's all the love you lost
The myths you made
Here's all the things you didn't say


All the days and hours
Pass by slow pass by slow
With the crowded tears
And the lights on low lights on
If lips mean some beauty freeze again
Ripple up in flames


Here's all the time you took
The myths you made
Here's all the things you didn't say
The myths you made
The things you didn't say


You gotta get a story
Where there's love where there's love
With my hand on the bible
And the fable done fable
Still 'til all the little details are exposed
Here comes the final blow


Here's all the love you lost
The myths you made
Here's all the things you didn't say
Here's all the time you took
The myths you made
Here's all the things you didn't say
