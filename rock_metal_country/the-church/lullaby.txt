We come to pay homage to the golden one
We share and bear the message of your newborn son
We follow paths of falling stars
In and out of mangers, other bars

Opportunity knocked you up I guess
Gave you your little baby's success
You've got potential, you have the gift
You have the chance to heal a million rifts

We've been sent to sing a lullaby for you
We've been sent to sing a lullabyWe've brought oils, gold and wine and bread
A dreaming pillow for his divine head
Asttrologers all we plot the charts
And wise men we can look into people's hearts


A doom is on the child that I can see
He don't belong in this time with you and me
His life will not be very long
Before you know it he will be gone 
We've been sent to sing a lullaby for you
