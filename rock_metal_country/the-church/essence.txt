The universe is female
Eluding the science of men 
You sway and you swagger with your neat little dagger
You're gonna blow it again 


I'll prove her existence in everything
The soul of her rivers and stones
Her acquiescence in everything
Her essence, her presence, her bones


Lust and love take the masculine
Ambition and war take the boys
Pin the tail on the alpha male
A little man making big noise
It's not the engine or chassis
It's not the weapon or length
Your war dance I guess got this place in this mess
But there's something that's stronger than strength


Metaphor is a goddess
A king that's fit for a queen
The opposite side of that armored old hide
I hope you know what I mean
