She said thanks for the present
Thanks for the future too
But it'll take something better than this creature you left
To make me come back to you


You better take it back take it to the bottom
Take it back take it to the bone
Take it back take it anywhere I go
Take it back take it all night long


When I first arrived in this brand new life
With my halo and clean slate
But then I dabbles and I meddled until I couldn't backpedal
And I hate my fate


I want to take it back take it to the bottom
Take it back take it to the bone
Take it back take it anywhere I go
Take it back take it all night long


She said thanks for the memories
She said thanks for the booze
She said thanks for everything that made me sing
These elemental breakdown blues


Why don't you take it back take it to the bottom 
Take it back take it to the bone
Take it back take it anywhere I go
Take it back take it all night long
