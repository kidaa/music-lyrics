Listen
Protect your thoughts, don't hide
If you
Can't face yourself, collide
The blue sheet of sky
Dazzle your eyes
And leaves you slumped against the night


They captured you, chopped off your hand
Left for dead
And buried your body in sun-soaked sand
Fly home


Is there patience where you think
Only empty arms to take you in
Pale luminescent glare
Surrounds you 'til you can't see it's there


Uncoiled flag below the wind
A torn head
You can't come out 'cause you're so far in
Fly home


Ancient in the image cast
Reminds you the future's like the past
Time split into equal spheres
Haunting you, using up your fears


Something hateful in your head
Then kick it out
You're skull and heart scullin' hard but your wings are dead
Fly home
