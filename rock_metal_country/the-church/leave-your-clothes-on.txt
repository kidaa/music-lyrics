First thing you know is you don't know a thing
Second thing you think about is that you're sinking
Third thing is water, fourth thing is air
Five are the fingers of wind in your hair
You can leave the city that you used to call home
You can leave your lover just to love all alone
You can leave your father or leave your son
And you can leave your clothes on
A nerve so sleek has entered your head
Take up your sickle, throw it and leave your bed
Make sure your will is good and hard
Make sure you never let down your guard
You can leave your body, you know the technique
Leave for two minutes or for two weeks
You leave your work and your pleasure undone
You can leave your clothes on
You can leave the city you used to call home
You leave your lover just to love all alone
You leave your father or leave your son
And you can leave your clothes on
