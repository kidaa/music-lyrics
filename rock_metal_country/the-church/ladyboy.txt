An open door, an extended hand, 
What can I say, I understand
She talks like a bird yet she walks like a man
She'll be here tonight I understand 
She hunts in a pack yet she ends up alone
She tells you its not alright darling, why'd you worship that stone ? 

Chorus
Hold me closer ladyboy, there's a rope that's dragging you out of this world
It doesn't care if you're heavy girl
Hold me closer ladyboy, if you look you can see that it's just you and me
There's nothing left of our world 

So you think it's a sin, I bet it's a miracle
You think that you're safe, I tell you you're critical


The merciless gods who sometimes pour down their scorn
They cannot die and also cannot be born 

Chorus 

An open door, an extended hand, what can I say - I understand
I understand, I understand, I understand 

Chorus 

Guitar : Pow ! Zing ! :-
