You should decide what you want to believe in
How can I describe what I'm receiving
It's like the marquee says, ";One Night At The Stage";
You want to live forever but you don't want to age


I just can't help wondering
It's such a waste of time


The life-buoy in the life-boat he was a sailor
You could not describe him, oh the words would just fail you
And Justine's laced up tight in her shoes
You're gonna get it whatever you choose


I just can't help wondering
It's such a waste of time


That's the blues man
That's the big town
That's the rebound 
That's the comedown


As high as a mountain as fast as a first ?
Lying beside a fountain dying of thirst
And the marquee says, ";One Night At The Stage";
Wait 'til I let this soul out of it's cage


And I just can't help wondering
It's such a waste of time


That's the blues man
That's the big town
That's the rebound
That's the comedown


Quiet section
That's a weird trick ?
That's a bad hit
That's the rebound
That's the comedown
