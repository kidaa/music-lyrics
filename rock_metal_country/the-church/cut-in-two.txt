Cut in two, that's the kind of ship I'm running
Cut in two, that's the kind of spell I'm casting
Cut in two, that's the type of time I'm killing
Cut in two, that's the kind of song I'm singing


Falling in 
Falling in
Falling in love again my face in your bedroom window
Falling in 
Falling in
Falling in love again


Separation no one looking in through my intrigue
Separation yeah I've been another me
I will run for you, I think


Champagne drink, it's a lie


Cut in two, that's the kind of axe I'm grinding 
he was not perfect, nor had he ever claimed to be
Cut in two, that's the kind of sleep I'm getting
enraptured, drifting toothpullers
Cut in two, that's the kind of love I'm making
reckon myself schoolmaster
Cut in two, that's the kind of life I'm having
smoke from the distant chimneys


Falling in eggshell polonaise, polonaise ghosts
Falling in
Falling in love again
Falling in it's a contest of stone hearts caress
Falling in
Falling in love again


Separation there's someone in here sharing it with me
Separation someone I no longer trust I can't see
Separation he's circling, waiting to make his move dead face
Separation it's just a memory I can't prove French fishwife


Incidentally, I like the word trespass, serendipity


Falling in protected
Falling in I feign unconsciousness
Falling in love again oh Goodbye
Falling in
Falling in I feign unconsciousness to see if god is there
Falling in love again


Separation I hate you he was only doing it for me 
Separation I'm just gonna have to hate you
and I, I was only doing it for the children
Separation and the children are sleeping and frightened
Separation 
Separation
Separation
Separation
