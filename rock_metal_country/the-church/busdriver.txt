Busdriver, busdriver you have taken me too far
And I feel that I've been lost
And I don't know where we are
Busdriver, busdriver I never saw your eyes
When we left the sun was up
Now, moons are in the sky
I woke up this morning
But I don't remember how
There was nothing left to care about
Oh busdriver where are we now
Busdriver, busdriver I don't recognize this town
Someone called me miles ago
You must have heard the sound
Busdriver, busdriver there's noone else but us
And I can't picture any time
When I wasn't on the bus
I was late this morning
It was early I was sure
There was nothing left to think about
Oh busdriver there just must be more
Busdriver, busdriver there's noone else but us
And I can't picture any time
When I wasn't on the bus
I woke up this morning
But I don't remember how
There was nothing left to talk about
There was nothing left to think about
