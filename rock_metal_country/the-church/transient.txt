Here for now, here for now
An island coincidence away
Boarding a train always leaving today
Approaching a station starts to slow
Ushered out, no will against the flow


Dark as the night comes to share
With stars in her hair
And grand majestic flair
Framed, a world passes by
With the sound of a young girl's sigh
Man carrying a brow
Smoke rises from the crowd 
Here for now, here for now
Tug in the sound as if to say
There's left a part of now in yesterday
The hurry for fear to miss the show
Not as strong as the wind's eternal blow


Wondering if the leaves will fall in May
Only know if I decide to stay
