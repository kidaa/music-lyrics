There is no reason to struggle
Nothing on earth you should fear
You say you received it but I just don't believe it
We both know why you're here
You never make an appointment


You never make anything clear
You say you're for real like that's a hell of a deal
But we both know why you're here
You need it and you read it and you feed it and you don't believe 
It's just a joke
You follow it you swallow it and then you like to wallow in it
Like civilized folk
Who like their rewards nice and easy
But you thought you were the four musketeers
You say you've got the stuff but there's never enough
And we both know why you're here
You say some rich man really loves you
Did you really think he's sincere
He wants all you got, that isn't a lot
And we both know why you're here
You walk it and you talk it but you never balked in it
Like nothing's wrong
You rush it and you crush it I'd hate to ever see you suss it 
But my curiosity is strong
