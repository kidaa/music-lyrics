Walking down the street, I'm walking down the street
People drift by and they dance a certain beat
I'm walking towards you with flower in my hand
One of these days you're gonna understand

The lives fall away ? but the road goes on
I lose my way inside a song
Sing about the things that you've never had
It's funny how I'm happy when you're sad

Where can I get over it ?
