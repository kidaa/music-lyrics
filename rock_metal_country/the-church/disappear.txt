Like a womb, night was all around
Someone, somewhere must have talked some sense
I could feel it moving underground
So many things I still don't understand
The dream I was having took on an ugly face
I don't know if I was walking through heaven
It could have been any place
Skipping 'cross the water, wading through the sand
Awake to find you gone, emptiness is where you lay
I just had to smile for all the things you'll never hear me say
Oh, I know, I could never get that near
What do you expect me to do, disappear?
You and me, we're as free as we can be
Can't you see, like the trees so obviously...
The message disturbs me so I throw it to the wind
And after all the hellos good-byes etc. etc.


We can't start this thing again
It's like the fog you walk towards, but never seem to reach
Every morning now I hear that same old song
And though the singer is long dead, his voice goes on and on
Ugliness you have to learn, beauty you can't teach
Awake to find you gone, a note pinned to my sleeve
It wasn't just the things you took
It was the things you had to leave
Now it seems you were never here
What do you expect me to do, disappear?
