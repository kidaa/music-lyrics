It seems you think I promised you the moon
You must be seeing stars
The callous future with a nervousness soon
But that's all in the past
You got off light
Lying there in your own world tonight
Turn off the charm, it's too damn bright
Hey you got off light
The rude rumors you started were partially true
You should be very proud
How will it be when they catch up with you
You're standing face to face with the jeering crowd
You got off light
Lying there in your own world tonight
In the dark with your second sight
You got off light
You didn't make such a big mistake
I should have checked on your credit
I pressed your hand in a clammy handshake
And I knew that I'd regret it
You got off light
Lying there in your own world tonight
But you're just too civilized to fight
You got off light
You got off light
Lying there in your own world tonight
Turn off the charm, it's too damn bright
