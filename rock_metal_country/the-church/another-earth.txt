At the back of your mind
Where you hide your real self
Lay down your head
You see her once more

She wants the moon and stars
She, she needs her time and space
She wants another Earth Bastard Universe
Wants another ..........
She wants the moon and starsAt the end of the day
When the light is so soft
You take off your mask
See she's never around
She wants the moon and stars
She, she wants the world to end
She wants another Earth Bastard Universe
Wants another ..........
She wants the moon and stars
She, she wants the world to end
She, she needs some time and space
She, she wants another Earth
She needs some time and space
She wants another Earth
