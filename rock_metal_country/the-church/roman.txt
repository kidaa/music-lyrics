Oh what a feeling baby, knowledge and brutality
Whose soul you stealing baby, lost your immortality
Another empty conquest, Venus set me free
Oh what a ritual father, father why you leaving me
They've found another martyr, rather it was him than me
They took away his language, then his memory
He said ";I'm never, never coming back again";
Oh what a battle master, what a noble enemy
We have to kill them bastards, then compose an elegy
I thought I saw their leader fallen on his knees
He said ";I'm never, never coming back again";
Oh what an ending baby, promise you'll remember me
I'm not pretending baby, your sweet and wicked treachery
Water all my orchids, save my dynasty
I said ";I'm never, never coming back again";
