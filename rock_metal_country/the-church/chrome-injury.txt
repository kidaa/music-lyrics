Cut your life into the steel
Take your place behind the wheel
Watch the metal scene just peel away
Don't forget me, don't regret me
Don't replace and don't upset me
But don't forget to come and get me someday

I was somewhere far away
But I knew I couldn't stay
German girls in an expose
Sitting on an empty train
Staring at the winter rain
Going through the scene again and again

Poor tormented automan
Giant pincers for a hand
Sinking slowly in the sand
Chrome injury on his cheek
Three days strong, four days weak
Listen as he tries to speak
If only I could feelFalling down standing still
Always there's more time to kill
Flamingos startled in a shrill display
Don't forget me, don't regret me
Don't replace and don't upset me
But don't forget to come and get me some day

If I only wasn't steel
