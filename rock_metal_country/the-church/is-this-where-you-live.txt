Oceanic lights are cleverly dim
Bluish features in the lower reaches
We raise out traffic flares to him
Fishnet, girlish the red ones spark
Holy arcs tracked in the dark
The more I see the less I look
Here's another name I took
Listen! In the early morning air
The remnants of their evening wear
Branching off, the road winds east
Deluxe locations just near completion
Come dine with wine and oyster feast
The pearls are real, have one for free
They're washed up by the foam waved sea
The more I look the less I smile
Never mind let's stay awhile
The fans blow secrets on the night
Out of mind but not out of sight
Is this where you live

Broken voices the nylon choir
Nothing left to stoke that fire
All they own is on their tongues
They never see or wonder if
Is this where you live

Thin dog's don't vie for bones
Why desert just to be alone
All they own is on their backs
They can't believe it's you I'm with
Is this where you liveDon't blush as I brush your touch
No need for any speed or rush
All you own is on the floor
I'm buying all you're gonna give
Is this where you live

Coffee stories the lying truth
Electric lights don't help my youth
All I owned is on my face
Urbane mirror anger myth
Is this where you live
