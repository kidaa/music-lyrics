Empty birdcage in her room
Curtains pulled against the moon
Follow her down to Louisiana
Hotel room bedside manner
God I've got to get back soon
She wriggles like a fish in a net
Details you can never forget
One thing or another
Never any bother? considering the regret?
//or//
Never anybody causing me no regret ?

That's my story
Cost a fortune
Louisiana

Black rain falling in the night
Strangers meet in the lamp light
Once in her life Louisiana
Standing alone out on the veranda
Christ I must have been a sight
She struggles like a leaf in the wind
Waiting for the music to begin
One thing or another
Always miss the other lover ?
Look what a state I'm in

That's my story
Nothing special
LouisianaBilly moved to Abilene
Lou is searching for morphine
Next stop is Louisiana
No-one there with a welcome banner
I don't suppose that they're too keen
She juggled her gentlemen friends
And suddenly the war ends
Coming home finding other men in hiding
Biding her lonely weekends

What a story
Cast of thousands
Louisiana

Empty birdcage in her room
Shadows shrunk against the moon
Follow her down to Louisiana
Hotel room bedside manner
God I've got to get back soon
God I've got to get back soon
