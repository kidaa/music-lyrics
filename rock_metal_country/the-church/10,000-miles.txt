Dark, small, so fragile
A treasure to your heart
Grace your fingers across the lacquer
Think of someone miles away
Piano sounds that bow in the distance
Bring me back to my room again
Ten thousand miles away
My memory is leaking
She lost a ruby thing
Trying to focus, times in the past
The music has stopped and can't carry on
All of a sudden I start to remember
Summer, Germany, then it's gone
Ten thousand miles away
The dancers are sleepy
The keys are put away
The jewel on my jacket talking, talking
Telling stories everyone's heard
My box of ghosts bids me goodnight
Clockwork spirits have the last word
