After the demise of our beloved leader
Everybody knew that something had to give
Cassandra she told me
But no-one would believe her
I wish I had helped her more than I did
We tried to overcome the threat of the monster
We tried to kneel down and call up the beast
Maria she told me
That her kid had just appeared one day
I just can't tell who I adore the least

The rivers run astray
Ricochet
Night feels just like day
Ricochet
And everybody just walk away

In one side of my mind resides a controller
In one side of my mind revolves a/the relief
And one pain in my brain remains unchanged
I say you cannot explain the grief
Once in a while when the wind has slowed down
Me and the girls visit struggle town
There's a shop down there
Selling skulls spells/stones and powder
But/we don't ask any questions about her/it

You can't be a lover if you want to keep on using
What are you using that's stronger than the love
Sometimes I'm knocked out by the damage that you're doing
Knocked out, locked out, push comes to shove
Listen to the wind tearing at the windows
Watching how the white moon melts into the cloud
Important little tyrants, impotent little pharaohs
Men/man of sorrows lost into the crowd

The rivers run astray
Ricochet
Night feels just like day
Ricochet
Everybody walk away

So if the ladies ask you over to play
Just beware of the ricochet
