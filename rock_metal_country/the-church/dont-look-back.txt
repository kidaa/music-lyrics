Sometime up here, watching a cloud
Funny how they shape your thoughts
Right out loud
Some days you laugh
Some days you cry
So deep in a night
It leaves you stranded high and dry
Keep to yourself, keep it in case
Keep it when you need it for a pretty smile
For your face
Walk out in the sun
Walk out in the rain
Keep on walking
And don't look back here again
