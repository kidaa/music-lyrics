Out in the open high in the sun


Blue fields of sky where the West is one
I fell into town and I covered up my wings
Yet to get a taste for everything


You're gonna ride into the sunset
I guess you can count me in
Don't feed the fire in here
Don't tell a soul
This uniform and war
Well it's all been done before
I'm nervous playing someone else's role


Take a look around you these walls aint real
There's nothing behind these facades
Get our gifts exchanged, why do you think that's strange
Why do you make it so hard
