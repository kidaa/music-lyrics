A war's being waged and the world's just a stage in this city
The real estate's prime, the number plates rhyme liquidity
Wear a gun and be proud, but bare breasts aren't allowed in this city
Dream up a scam and then rake in the clams liquidity

It's neither here nor there It's neither here nor there
North and south and east and west
It has to be somewhere It oughta be somewhere
North and south and east and west
I take my payment, I catch my flight,
And don't wait up for me tonight
And you might find me there and you might find me there
North and south and east and west

Have a quick throw or host your own show in this city
To a wolf from a lamb for just half a gram liquidity
The face of today just a scalpel away
Restore your lost soul for two dollars plus toll liquidity

Backs are patted when calves are fatted in this city
The emperor's clothes are host for the proles liquidity
The guys with the brains are all bitter and vain stupidity
The guys with the luck got the bimbos and bucks liquidity
Chorus
