I know it was the wind that kept your door closed
The echo of another time, an age of beauty
She lived in the future, she lived in the past
She gave it all to me, she gave it all to me
Travel by thought
Don't think I've forgotten the thoughts of your room
It told unlikely tales, an age of beauty
Some nights I walk through the heat to your street
I lose my bearings, but I can see clearly
Travel by thought
Where do you want to go?
Imagine the feeling before that last jump
Come back to mother earth, an age of beauty
Oh you just can't define, the sad things in your mind
Just give them all to me
Travel by thought
Who do you want?
What do you want?
How do you want it?
Why do you want to go?
Anywhere that ignorant
Travel by thought
Who do you want?
Where do you want to go?
Don't think I've forgotten
The stranger's arms
That scares the bird that carries home dinner
Into the eggshell arms of the eggshell earth
Don't think I've forgotten


Don't think I'll keep that promise
Don't think I've forgotten
Travel by thought
