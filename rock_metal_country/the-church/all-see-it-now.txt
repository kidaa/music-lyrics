You shouldn't have to feel so frightened
And you just wanna feel enlightened baby, in front of you
Oh my what love can do

You shouldn't have to hide in darkness
Its not such a good likeness baby, less of you
Oh yeah what love can do

And we all see it now

You talk a lot without a purpose
You walk around just like circus baby, is it true ?
That's what love did to you

You've got a friend who's very famous
I know you'd never ever shame us baby, but look at you
That's what fame can do

And we all see it now

You took a lot of people with you
And now expect them to forgive you, you're not through
That's what it means to you
And then you lie down on the sofa
You know you shouldn't really bother baby, I'm here too
That's what it does to you

And we all see it now
