Trust her distant island cluster
Protecting her from intrusive things
I know I really shouldn't trust her
She's looked at all my dreams
Chorus:
Now she's hiding out in the distance somewhere
Falling down towards sleep
Gotta get a little feeling out there
Gotta get in deep 
Second time only
Before she goes to sleep, to dream about guitars 

One of the sisters is a flight assistant
One of them is a plane
One of them is a typhoon
Never going back againOne of their mothers was a mother lode
One of them was a mermaid
One of them was a long gone woman
Do you think that's funny ?

Chorus
