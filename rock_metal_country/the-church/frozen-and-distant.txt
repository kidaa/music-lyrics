We are seething
All those pretty pretty months were so deceiving
We are glowing
All those lucky lucky stars we've been blowing
The hammer falls and it's going, going, gone
And all the pulse in this reflection
We are freezing
And you thought that all that cold war stuff was teasing
The weather's strange so we stay in bed
Prophet of doom went straight to your head

Frozen and distant, release the cold ice cannot see
Here in an instant, could be next week eyes cannot see
Frozen and distant relic


We say one day
This ice will all melt down but we'll be washed away
Funny how it seems important here and now
Tryur daily bread


Frozen and distant, really sublime ice cannot see
Here in an instant, could be next time eyes cannot see
Frozen and distant relic
