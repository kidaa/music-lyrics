These are the marks you made
You never meant to fade
They come in to take your place
And these are the stories I heard
Come back, a sad farewell
They come in to take your place
But all of the treasure you saved
And none of the lives you lost
Will come in to take your place
And three free ? are the days in May
But not one single moment
Will come in to take your place

Will come in to take your place repeat
They come in to take your place repeat
