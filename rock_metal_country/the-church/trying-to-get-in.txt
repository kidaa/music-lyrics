Curled in the warm winter sun
All alone number one ?
Gentle caramel melting dream
Things meant for something else
What else did you give to me ?

There's someone outside, they're trying to get in
Mirror denies it, I can't wake up this morning

Curled in the cool summer moon ?
Loses himself in the chances that fortune has given him

Someone outside, they're trying to get in
Mirror denies...

Oh Mr Silver please come in
We've been sitting here waiting for you
Such a long long time

Right speaker
None may dare to watch your grandeur
None may walk
Left speaker
Moses by the seaside in 1974
Listens to the music of the skyscraper carnivoresThere's someone outside...

Moses by the seaside...

Somewhere in this wilderness you wander like a river
Crossing the wheatfields and crying to the sorry ocean,
We're crying to the sorry ocean

Wrapped in the arms of the night

Someone outside

There's someone outside, they're trying to get in
