Turn down the gravity, this is all too heavy
I'll show you how the ancients once traveled
They used to call this a Chevy
Just before the continents sank, you could still go outside
I was sitting on a hot off ramp
She pulled up and asked me if I needed a ride

Terra nova cain I need you again
Deep space jam on an alien terrain
Terra nova cain I need you again
Some for the little boys who live down the lane

I should have known there was something amiss
She had unearthly eyes
She had a way of sifting through your mind
Like she'd done it to a million guys
She said will you help with our research
I said take me to your leader
She put her foot down on the oscillation pedal
She was a transdimensional speeder

Terra nova cain I need you again
Protect me from the meteor rain
Terra nova cain I need you again
Put your exploratory probe right into my brain

They brought me back after thousands of years
I hadn't aged at all
We used to float around her weightless bedroom
That drove me right up the wall

Terra nova cain I need you again
You dropped me off and you've left me quite drained
Terra nova cain I need you again
Help me break these telekinetic chains
