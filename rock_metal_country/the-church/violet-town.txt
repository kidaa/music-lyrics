Newspaper face against the ground
Phantom bus pass through violet town
On its way through the yellow fields
Past the graying fences
When I'm here I have this feeling
I don't want to know
Inviolate town
Big trees throw shade that falls around
The empty streets of violet town
Gardeners the houses stand
And eyes in windows, strange...
Big truth progresses never to be found
I walk the corners straight to violet town
And I tell you sometimes when we're old
Of the useless boy and his dream
