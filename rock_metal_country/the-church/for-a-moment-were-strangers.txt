In the empty place the soul stripped bare
Of skins and heart and I come apart
In your icy hands
I forget my role, as I stare into your soul
In the empty place you change your mind
You change your clothes you change your pose
For a perfect fit
I forget the cast, as I stare into your past

For a moment we're strangers
For a minute you look away
For a second or always
For an instant another day
Such strange things you sayIn the empty place we dress our wounds
Collect our coats, a window gloats
Above a street
I prepare my case, as I stare into your face

Just one me one you
The world contains a few
Is it true, is it truly new
Are we through the stolen door once more
