With lipstick on his collar and a trace of cheap perfume 
He undresses in the darkness and eases into bed 
With her face turned to the other wall she pretends to be asleep 
But it doesn't really matter 'cause there's nothin' to be said 

He calls from work to tell her he's sorry about last night 
If he uses all the right words she'll forgive him once again 
But the phone just keeps on ringin' and he knows that something's wrong 
He feels his heart start pounding, and his head begins to spin 

Phones are ringin' all over town 
North and south and east and west on main street up and down 
He's got friends of his callin' friends of hers 
But she's nowhere to be found 
Phones are ringin' all over town 

He calls the hospital, her sister's house and the place that does her hair 
God, if somethin' ever happened he'd surely lose his mind 
And he's thinkin' it's just like she's disappeared into thin air 
As American flight #204 departed right on time 

Phones are ringin' all over town 
North and south and east and west on main street up and down 
He's got friends of his callin' friends of hers 
But she's nowhere to be found 
Phones are ringin' all over town 

Well he knows she'd never leave him 
She's just got to be around 
Phones are ringin' 
Phones are ringin' 
Phones are ringin' all over town
