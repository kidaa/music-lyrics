Slow down that's right 
Give it all you got 
Yeah you got the right stuff 
Kick back let go 
Trust yourself you know 
Yeah what you got is good enough 

Hey don't give 'em what they think they want 
'Cause they don't have a clue 
Yeah if you really wanna give 'em something different 
Something to sink their teeth into 
Well baby then you just do what you do 

All eyes were on Alice 
They laughed and made her cry 
Yeah she was a little different 
But hey you know what 
She found a way to fly 
You see Alice she got her strength from the inside 

Hey don't give 'em what they think they want 
'Cause they don't have a clue 
Yeah if you really wanna give 'em something different 
Something to sink their teeth into 
Well baby then you just do what you do 

The cost of living just went up today 
As soon as you started doing things your way 
You'll be shakin' 'em off your coattails from every side 
They'll be trying to catch that free ride 

Hey don't give 'em what they think they want 
'Cause they don't have a clue 
Yeah if you really wanna give 'em something different 
Something to sink their teeth into 
Well baby then you just do what you do 
Do what you do 
Do what you do
