Sometimes I feel like I never quite fit in
Like I'm always a little out of place
It's hard to be everything to everyone
There's so many roles I have to play
Sometimes I'm just barely hanging on
Seems like I'm always fighting to be strong
To find somewhere that I belong

[Chorus:]
When you love me every part of me feels
Like I'm right where I'm meant to be
When you touch me you reach through to
My soul to the truest place in me
Baby in your arms I'm free
To just be a woman

I can't believe how beautiful I feel
There is nothing here to hide
I'm unafraid and so completely real
Oh and never more alive
This life can be so hard to understand
But your eyes oh they see me as I am
And you take me as I am

[Chorus]

Baby hold me close never let me go
Never let me go

[Chorus]

To just be a woman
