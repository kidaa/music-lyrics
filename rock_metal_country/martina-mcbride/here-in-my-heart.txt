Wondering, waiting 
Restless for a sign 
I thought you walked so slow 
In my haste I left you behind 
Caught in the pace of this madness 
Searching for shelter I find 

That here in my heart there's a refuge waiting 
Here in my heart you just won't let me go 
I could run away run away 
But you stay here in my heart 

Meaning, purpose 
Got lost in pursuit of my dreams 
I've been longing, aching 
In quest for a love that's supreme 
I couldn't see you were reaching 
But I should've known all along 

That here in my heart there's a refuge waiting 
Here in my heart you just won't let me go 
I could run away run away 
But you stay here in my heart 
There's a refuge waiting 
Here in my heart you just won't let me go 
I could run away run away 
But you stay here in my heart 

I couldn't see you were reaching 
But I should've known all along 

That here in my heart there's a refuge waiting 
Here in my heart you just won't let me go 
I could run away run away 
But you stay here in my heart 
There's a refuge waiting 
Here in my heart you just won't let me go 
I could run away run away 
I could run away run away 
I could run away run away 
But you stay here in my heart 
Here in my heart Here in my heart 
Here in my heart Here in my heart 
Here in my heart Here in my heart 
Here in my heart Here in my heart 
Here in my heart 
Here in my heart
