I never believed in the straight and narrow 
Always took the rocky road 
Spread my wings like a wayward sparrow 
Where the wind blew I would go 
Thought no one could ever tame me 
And no chains could tie me down 
But your love put my feet back on the ground 

I wanna walk that line 
True lovers do 
Your hand in mine 
Now I belong to you 
I wanna join our hearts 
With the ties that bind 
And make a brand new start 
I wanna walk that line 

All my wild and crazy ramblings 
And the things that I lived for 
Were so easily abandoned 
I don't need them anymore 
With a tender touch you tamed me 
And I'll never be the same 
'Cause your love led my heart back home again 

I wanna walk that line 
True lovers do 
Your hand in mine 
Now I belong to you 
I wanna join our hearts 
With the ties that bind 
And make a brand new start 

I wanna walk that line 
True lovers do 
Your hand in mine 
Now I belong to you 
I wanna join our hearts 
With the ties that bind 
And make a brand new start 
I wanna walk that line
