Here I go restless heart 
Another lovely misadventure in the dark 
All my friends who knew me when 
Tell me not to wander down that road again 
What they don't know what they can't see 
It's being on that road that makes me free 
Some say I'm running 
I know I'm falling back to you 

The water's deep under the bridge 
As I pass by our old house upon the ridge 
All our sins have washed away 
Now all that's left are all the things we didn't say 
Oh restless heart you beat so fast 
While my mind is telling me that it won't last 
Some say I'm running 
I know I'm falling back to you 

Against the odds I'll roll the dice 
I guess my heart has won despite all good advice 
So grab your things and come on in 
And get to know your children once again 
When does a fool stop being a fool? 
And since when is love obliged to any rules? 
Some say I'm running 
I know I'm falling back to you 

Let's learn to give let's talk things out 
Let's give them someone else to talk about 
Some say I'm running 
But I know I'm falling back to you
