In waters calm I sailed from shore 
To see what I might see 
And having never sailed before 
I drifted aimlessly 
A warm breeze rocked my boat until 
In slumber I fell sound 
But woke to find the light grown dim 
And dark clouds gathering 'round 

In haste I worked at turning back 
But now the wind blew wrong 
And when the night came cold and black 
My strength was almost gone 
But with one last small thread of hope 
I bowed my head to pray 
Then through the dark I saw a rope 
And heard a calm voice say 

Grab the rope hold it tight 
In the distance shines a light 
Neither fear nor feel alone 
There is one who'll lead you home 

I heard my heart beat loud and fast 
But did as I was told 
And with the rosy dawn at last 
Dry land I did behold 
I kissed the sandy banks and swore 
My sailing days were through 
But should I ever stray from shore 
I know now what to do 

Grab the rope hold it tight 
In the distance shines a light 
Neither fear nor feel alone 
There is one who'll lead you home 

Grab the rope hold it tight 
In the distance shines a light
