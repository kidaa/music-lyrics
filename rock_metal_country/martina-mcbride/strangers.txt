Two strangers passing on the sidewalk 
Barely brush each other's hand 
He says "I'm sorry" 
She says "Don't worry" 
And that is how it all began 

A few short days and night together 
And it's like they were meant to be 
Lying there with her he softly whispers 
Just think what we were so recently 

Strangers, strangers 
The world greatest lovers 
Last week we were strangers 

Two strangers passing in the hallway 
Barely touch each other's heart 
Now they're pretending 
Two shadows blending 
But they're a million miles apart 

Soon she'll be packing up her suitcase 
They'll be dividing all the blame 
They know how they started 
Now empty hearted 
They don't have a clue how they became 

Strangers, strangers 
The world greatest lovers 
And now they are strangers 
The world's greatest lovers 
Have turned into strangers 
Strangers, strangers
