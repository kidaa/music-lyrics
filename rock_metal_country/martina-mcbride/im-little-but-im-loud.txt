I'm puny short and little but I'm loud 
I learned to do my singing walking 'long behind a plow 
The singing teacher always passed me by 
And so I have to sing the only way that I know how 
Just rear back open up and let her fly 

I'm little but I'm loud 
I'm poor but I'm proud 
I'm countrified an I don't care who knows it 
I'm like a Banty Rooster in a big red rooster crowd 
I'm puny short and little but I'm loud 
I'm puny short and little but I'm loud
