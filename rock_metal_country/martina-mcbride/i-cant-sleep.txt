I can't sleep for dreaming about you 
When you're gone there's nothing I can do 
But lie awake alone and dream the whole night through 
I can't sleep for dreaming about you 

I close my weary eyes 
And see your face 
I hold my pillow tight 
And dream of your embrace 
I know I could use the rest 
But my lonely heart cries out for your caress 

I can't sleep for dreaming about you 
When you're gone there's nothing I can do 
But lie awake alone and dream the whole night through 
I can't sleep for dreaming about you 

They say absence makes a love grow stronger 
But I don't believe my empty arms can hold out any longer 

I can't sleep for dreaming about you 
When you're gone there's nothing I can do 
But lie awake alone and dream the whole night through 
I can't sleep for dreaming about you 
I can't sleep for dreaming about you
