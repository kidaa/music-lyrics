There you are in the early light of day 
There you are in the quiet words I pray 
I've been blessed by the simple happiness 
Of the perfect love we've made 

Every time I turn around 
When I'm lost and when I'm found 
Like an angel standing guard 
There you are 
Every time I take a breath 
And when I forget to breathe 
You're watching over me 
There you are 
When I'm looking for the light 
In the middle of the night 
Searching for the brightest star 
There you are 

There you are in standing in a crowded room 
There you are the earth and I'm the moon 
My desire is to stand by the fire 
That burns inside of you 

Every time I turn around 
When I'm lost and when I'm found 
Like an angel standing guard 
There you are 
Every time I take a breath 
And when I forget to breathe 
You're watching over me 
There you are 
When I'm looking for the light 
In the middle of the night 
Searching for the brightest star 
There you are 

When I'm looking for the light 
In the middle of the night 
Searching for the brightest star 
There you are 
There you are 
There you are
