This is no
Yellow brick road
We've been travelin' on

A river of tears
Washed us here
We're right where we belong

We rode it out
No we didn't drown
And look at what we've found

[Chorus:]
Every street we take
Is paved with truth
If a mountain's in our way
That's a mountain we move
Baby there ain't nothin' we can't do
Since me and you
Built a city of love

Through shiftin' sands
With our own hands
We dug to solid ground

Where we found out
What love's about
Yeah there's no stoppin' us now

Yeah on our own stone by stone
We built a fortress strong where

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
