Heartache number 1 was when you...left me,
I never knew that I could hurt this way,
And heartache number 2,
Was when you...come back again,
You came back and never meant to stay.

[Chorus]
Now I've got heartaches by the number,
Troubles by the score,
Every day you love me less,
Each day I love you more,
Yes, I've got heartaches by the number,
A love that I can't win,
But the day that I stop counting,
That's the day my world will end.

Heartache number 3 was when you...called me,
And said that you was coming back to stay,
With hopeful heart I waited,
For your...knock on the door,
I waited but you must have lost your way.

[Repeat Chorus]
