I was standing in the grocery store line 
The one they marked express 
When this woman came through with about 25 things 
And I said don't you know that more is less 
She said this world is movin' so fast 
I just get more behind with every day 
And every mornin' when I make my coffee 
I can't believe my life's turned out this way 
All I could say was 

Love's the only house big enough for all the pain in the world 
Love's the only house big enough for all the pain 

He was walkin' by the other day and I said 
Hey baby...how you been 
Yeah I got me a little girl now and she's 4 years old 
And she's got her daddy's little grin 
And you only wanted what you can't have 
And baby you can't have me now 
I gave me heart to another 
Yeah I'm a mother and he's a father and we're a family and we got each other 
And I found out the hard way that 

Love's the only house big enough for all the pain in the world 
Love's the only house big enough for all the pain 

You drive three miles from all this prosperity 
Down across the river and you see a ghetto there 
And we got children walking around with guns 
And they got knives and drugs and pain to spare 
And here I am in my clean white shirt 
With a little money in my pocket and a nice warm home 
And we got teenagers walkin' around in a culture of darkness 
Livin' together alone...all I can 

Love's the only house big enough for all the pain in the world 
Love's the only house big enough for all the pain 

And I can't explain it and I can't understand 
But I'll come down and get my hands dirty and together we'll make a stand 
Somewhere 'cross the parking lot some bands playin' out of tune 
City streets are gonna burn if we don't do something soon 
And se?orita can't quit cryin baby's due now any day 
Don Juan left got sick of trying 
No one there to show him the way 
She came down to the grocery store and she said I 
I wanna buy a little carton of milk but I don't have any money 
I said hey I'll cover you honey 'cause the pain's gotta go somewhere 
Yeah the pain's gotta go someplace 
So come on down to my house 
Don't you know that 

Love's the only house big enough for all the pain in the world 
Love's the only house big enough for all the pain 
Don't you know that 
Love's the only house big enough for all the pain in the world 
Love's the only house big enough for all the pain
