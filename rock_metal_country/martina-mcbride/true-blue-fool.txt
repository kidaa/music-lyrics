I'm so blue lonely for you 
What makes you treat me the way that you do 
I've been true only to you 
Just call me your true blue fool 

Every day you're away lasts forever 
Oh what price my heart pays just to stay together 

I'm so blue lonely for you 
What makes you treat me the way that you do 
I've been true only to you 
Just call me your true blue fool 

First you lie then I cry then you're sorry 
I forgive once again it's just the same old story 

I'm so blue lonely for you 
What makes you treat me the way that you do 
'Cause I've been true only to you 
Just call me your true blue fool 
Just call me your true blue fool
