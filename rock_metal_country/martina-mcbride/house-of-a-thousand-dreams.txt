He says, "I'm just a man, I work with my hands
But lately no work has been around
I wish that I could put more on the table
Provide the life I'm sure my family dreams about"

[Chorus]
"But there's cracks in all the walls and all the windows
And the flies, they find their way in through the screen
I just pray that hope will go on living
In this house of a thousand dreams"

She says, "my husband's a good man
Gives all that he can
I know he thinks he's let me down
I just want him and the children to be happy
It's not always easy, but it's all I dream about"

"So I'll find some yard-sale curtains for the windows
And I'll sew some yellow trim along the seams
And I'll keep praying hope will go on living
In this house of a thousand dreams"

The boy says, "my daddy's a strong man
My momma, she loves him
And they love my brother and sister and me
Sometimes at night we lay out in the backyard
And take turns wishing on the first star we see"

"And the crickets always sing outside the windows
And I love to feel the wind blow through the screen
And I sure hope that we can live forever
In this house of a thousand dreams"

"Yeah I sure hope that we can live forever
In this house of a thousand dreams"
