I'm still waiting 
Tell me you love me and make me feel it 
Convince me that your heart is true 
Don't say you need me if you really don't mean it 
'Cause boy I ain't nobody's fool yeah 

Baby I'm trying to find a place inside your heart 
Oh but it's hard to start a fire without a spark 
If you wanna be the man that rocks me to my knees 
Baby just make me believe 

'Cause I'm still waiting 
Every night I bring you all my broken pieces 
But you just put them on your shelf 
Tell me why you put this wall between us 
And keep your reasons to yourself ah 

Baby I'm trying to find a place inside your heart 
Oh but it's hard to start a fire without a spark 
If you wanna be the man that rocks me to my knees 
Baby just make me believe 

You say you feel the same 
But my heart's full of doubt 
You say you'll find the time 
So we can work it out 
But I'm still waiting 

Baby I'm trying to find a place inside your heart 
Oh but it's hard to start a fire without a spark 
If you wanna be the man that rocks me to my knees 
Baby just make me believe 

Baby I'm trying to find a place inside your heart 
Oh but it's hard to start a fire without a spark 
If you wanna be the man that rocks me to my knees 
Baby just make me believe 
Baby just make me believe 
Baby just make me believe
