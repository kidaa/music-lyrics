We came out west together with a common desire 
The fever we had might-a set the west coast on fire 
Two months later got a troublin' mind 
'Cause my baby moved out and left me behind 
And it's all right 'cause it's midnight and I got two more bottles of wine 

Well, the way he left sure turned my head around 
Seemed like over night he just up and put me down 
Ain't gonna let it bother me today 
'Cause I've been workin' and I'm too tired anyway 
And it's all right 'cause it's midnight and I got two more bottles of wine 

Well, I'm sixteen hundred miles from the people I know 
I've been doin' all I can but opportunity sure comes slow 
Thought I'd be a big star by today 
But I've been sleepin' in a warehouse in West L.A. 
But it's all right 'cause it's midnight and I got two more bottles of wine 

Well, I'm sixteen hundred miles from the people I know

Yes, it's all right 'cause it's midnight and I got two more bottles of wine 
Well it's all right 'cause it's midnight and I got two more bottles of wine
