I'll need time
To get you off my mind
I may sometimes bother you
Try to be in touch with you
Even ask too much of you
From time to time

Now and then
Lord ya know I'm gonna need a friend
Til I get used to losing you
Let me keep on using you
Til I can make it on my own

I'll get by
But no matter how I try
There'll be times you know I'll call
Chances are my tears will fall
And I'll have no pride at all
From time to time

But they say
Oh there'll be a brighter day
But til then I'll lean on you
That's all I mean to do
Til I can make it on my own

Surely someday I'll wake up and see the mornin sun
Without another lonely night behind me
Then I'll know I'm over you and all my cryin's done
No more hurtin memories to find me

But til then
Lord ya know I'm gonna need a friend
Til I get used to losing you
Let me keep on using you
Til I can make it on my own
Til I cn make it on my own
