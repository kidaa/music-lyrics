You have worn a path 
Right up to my heart 
You come in for a while but you don't stay 
And I've come to realize 
That your promises are lies 
To buy you time when you want to get away 

You must think my heart has swingin' doors 
The way that you keep comin' back and forth 
I can feel it's getting close to closing time 
And I won't be leavin' my heart open anymore 

Well I've heard you're back in town 
I suppose you'll come around 
When nights are cold and friends are hard to find 
You always seem to wait 
'Til all the pieces are in place 
Then you walk back in and rearrange my life 

You must think my heart has swingin' doors 
The way that you keep comin' back and forth 
And I can feel it's getting close to closing time 
And I won't be leavin' my heart open anymore 
So if you're walkin' down my street just keep on walkin' by 
I'm hangin' out a sign sayin' this well has run dry 

You must think my heart has swingin' doors 
You must think my heart has swingin' doors 
The way that you keep comin' back and forth 
I can feel it's getting close to closin' time 
And I won't be leavin' my heart open anymore 
I won't be leavin' my heart open anymore 
I won't be leavin' my heart open anymore
