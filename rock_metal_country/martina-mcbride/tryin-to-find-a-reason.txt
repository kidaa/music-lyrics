No love can survive for long like this
When you're standing' on a bridge that's always burnin'
Maybe it's just time to walk away
If you're tryin' to find a reason
Tryin' to find a reason to stay

I don't know how long this pain will last
All I know is it can't go on forever
Isn't this just pointless anyway
If you're tryin' to find a reason to stay

It's hard to admit it what we know inside
We've tried everything, everything but goodbye
Say goodbye

If your heart has nothin' left to give
If your world feels like it's just stopped turnin'
Maybe that says all there is to say
If you're tryin' to find a reason to stay

It's hard to admit it what we know inside
We've tried everything, everything but goodbye

Maybe it's just time to walk away
If you're tryin' to find a reason
Tryin' to find a reason to stay
Baby it's just time to walk away
If you're tryin' to find a reason to stay
