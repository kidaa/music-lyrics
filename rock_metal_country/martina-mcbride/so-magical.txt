I was walking down the street
In my blue jeans and my bare feet
I saw old Mrs. Mayo in her garden so high

She got her prize azaleas 
And her big ole fat tomatoes
She invited me in to have a piece of her pie

And later on I thought I'd head on down
By the Caley River to the old rope swing
There was a bunch of kids laughin' and jumpin' in
I sat down on the grass and I just watched them play
And all my worries seemed to wash away

[Chorus:]
Oh it's a magical thing
When the sun is shinging down on me
And this is such a beautiful place
Don't wanna miss a minute of today it's
So magical

Tonight I'll go home and write myself a letter
Tell myself to live a little freer and love a little better
Gonna soak it in like there's no tomorrow
And drink up every second like a big ole glass of water

[Chorus]

Oh I feel like I could fly
When I see the world through these eyes
