When the world is on your shoulders 
Just too much to bear 
Boy my love can make you stronger 
I ain't goin' nowhere 
When you're followin' all the rules 
But life just will not play fair 
Come to me and we'll roll with the punches 
I ain't goin' nowhere 

By your side by your side day and night 
I will be always 
There's a place in my heart in my heart 
Just for you always 
I ain't goin' nowhere 
I ain't goin' nowhere 

I can't guarantee that your dreams 
Won't fade into thin air 
But as sure as I'm livin' breathin' 
I ain't goin' nowhere 

By your side by your side day and night 
I will be always 
There's a place in my heart in my heart 
Just for you always 
I ain't goin' nowhere 
I ain't goin' nowhere 

But straight to you 
No one else will do 
My love will shine right through your rain 
I will lift you up I will lift you up 

I ain't goin' nowhere 
I ain't goin' nowhere 
I ain't goin' nowhere 
I ain't goin' nowhere
