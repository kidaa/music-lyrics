My right hand holds matches 
My left holds my past 
I hope the wind catches 
And burns it down fast 
I'm gonna step into the fire 
With my failures and my shame 
And wave goodbye to yesterday 
As I dance among the flames 

So don't try to save me now 
Let the walls of my world all burn down 
Just stand back and wait 'til the smoke finally passes 
And I will rise 
From the ashes 
From the ashes 
From the ashes 

For all that I'm losing much more will I gain 
The hard part is choosing 
To change what needs changed 
My step will be much lighter 
With these demons off my chest 
I'm born a better spirit 
And lay the old to rest 

So don't try to save me now 
Let the walls of my world all burn down 
Just stand back and wait 'til the smoke finally passes 
And I will rise 
From the ashes 
From the ashes 
From the ashes 

And I'll walk away stronger 
I will be flyin' 
Higher and truer 
Than I've flown before 

My right hand holds matches 
My left holds my past 
I hope the wind catches 
And burns it down fast
