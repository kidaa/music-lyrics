When you are old and tired and gray 
Wear you overcoat on sunny days 
When your brave tales have all been told 
I'll ask for them when you are old 

When you are old and full of sleep 
And death no longer makes you weep 
When your body aches with cold 
I'll warm your heart when you are old 

You'll still be the same to me 
A comfort and a mystery 
And I will be old too see 
I'll need someone to comfort me 

When you are old and pale and gone 
And a gentle hand is all you want 
I will give you mine to hold 
And I'll be here when you are old 
Yes I will give you mine to hold 
And I'll be here when you are old
