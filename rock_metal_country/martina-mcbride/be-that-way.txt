Every time I turn around 
I run right into your pride 
Sometimes I'm not so sure if I wanna 
Know that guy, know that guy 
'Cause you've got a rock hard head 
Stubborn as a mule 
Oh, yeah, and by the way, I still love you 

Go on and be that way 
Slam that door 
Make a scene 
Yell some more 
Come on let's have it out 
Have your say 
'Cause with a love this strong 
Baby it's okay 
For you to be that way 

Sometimes what you don't say 
Can make the deepest cut 
And I get my feelings hurt 
And I just go nuts, well a little nuts 
So try to ignore that girl 
She's just blowin' off steam 
Oh and I don't know about her 
But I hope you say to me 

Go on and be that way 
Slam that door 
Make a scene 
Yell some more 
Come on let's have it out 
Have your say 
'Cause with a love this strong 
Baby it's okay 
For you to be that way 

Baby let's get emotional 
What do you say we let it all go 
Let it go 

Go on and be that way 
Slam that door 
Make a scene 
Yell some more 
Come on let's have it out 
Have your say 
'Cause with a love this strong 
Baby it's okay 
For you to be that way 

Be that way, oh yeah
