I don't wanna think 
That you could be runnin' around 
After all the love 
That I have shown you 

I won't knock on your door 
I won't call to see if you're home 
But I won't close my eyes 

Love's a matter of trust 
And I just want to believe in us 
But last night in your kiss 
I felt a lie on your lips 

I won't knock on your door 
I won't call to see if you're home 
But I won't close my eyes 

There are two kinds of love 
Those who are true and those untrue 
I see black and white 
Are you somewhere lost between the two 

I won't knock on your door 
I won't call to see if you're home 
I won't knock on your door 
I won't call to see if you're home 
But, I won't close my eyes 
No, I won't close my eyes 

I don't wanna think 
That you could be runnin' around
