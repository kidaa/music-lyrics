Red sun sittin' on the road behind her 
A hundred miles out of her hometown 
Drops a quarter in a beat up pay phone 
Listens to it rattle on down 
Voices cold as the phone she's holding 
The connects way too clear 
He's yellin' where's my dinner 
She's too far gone to care She says listen here 

There's a time to stand and the time is now or never 
A time to fly, a time to let go forever 
A time to grow, and a time to discover 
Life is precious, every second 
You've wasted mine and it's my time 

She puts a few more miles between them 
He pours a distance of his own 
Starts talking to the bottle 
It's all that left now she's gone 
He rages on till the National Anthem 
Comes on his TV 
Then he looks straight at the bottle 
And says you did this to me 
And then he screams 

There's a time to stand and the time is now or never 
A time to fly, a time to let go forever 
A time to grow, and a time to discover 
Life is precious, every second 
You've wasted mine and it's my time 

It's my time, it's my time, it's my time 
And the time is what you make it 
It's my time, it's my time, it's my time 
And time is what you're taking 

There's a time to stand and the time is now or never 
A time to fly, a time to let go forever 
A time to grow, and a time to discover 
Life is precious, every second 
You've wasted mine and it's my time
