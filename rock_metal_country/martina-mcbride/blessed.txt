I get kissed by the sun each morning 
Put my feet on a hardwood floor 
I get to hear my children laughing 
Down the hall through the bedroom door 
Sometimes I sit on my front porch swing 
Just soaking up the day 
I think to myself, I think to myself 
This world is a beautiful place 

I have been blessed 
And I feel like I've found my way 
I thank God for all I've been given 
At the end of every day 
I have been blessed 
With so much more than I deserve 
To be here with the ones that love me 
To love them so much it hurts 
I have been blessed 

Across a crowded room 
I know you know what I'm thinking 
By the way I look at you 
And when we're lying in the quiet 
And no words have to be said 
I think to myself, I think to myself 
This love is a beautiful gift 

I have been blessed 
And I feel like I've found my way 
I thank God for all I've been given 
At the end of every day 
I have been blessed 
With so much more than I deserve 
To be here with the ones that love me 
To love them so much it hurts 
I have been blessed 

When I'm singing my kids to sleep 
When I feel you holding me 
I know 

I have been blessed 
And I feel like I've found my way 
I thank God for all I've been given 
At the end of every day 
I have been blessed 
With so much more than I deserve 
To be here with the ones that love me 
To love them so much it hurts 
I have been blessed
