How can you just stand there 
And act like nothing's wrong 
You haven't even kissed me 
Or held me for so long 
There's no lipstick on your collar 
There's no perfume on your clothes 
There's no number on a matchbook 
But a woman always knows 

A woman knows without asking 
A woman knows what's left unsaid 
A woman knows when a man's been sleeping 
In someone else's bed 

I don't have all the answers 
And you haven't left a clue 
But in my heart there's just no question 
You've found somebody new 

A woman knows without asking 
A woman knows what's left unsaid 
A woman knows when a man's been sleeping 
In someone else's bed 

When you refuse to talk about it 
In your silence my suspicion grows 
You don't have to paint a picture 
Somehow a woman knows 
You don't have to paint a picture 
Somehow a woman knows
