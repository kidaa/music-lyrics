Yeah 
The sun is shinin' everyday 
The clouds never get in the way for you and me 
I've known you just a week or two 
But baby I'm so into you 
Can hardly breathe 

And I'm in so totally 
Wrapped up emotionally 
Attracted so physically 
Actin' so recklessly 
I need you so desperately 
Sure as the sky is blue 
Baby I love you 
I love you 

I never knew that I could feel like this 
Can hardly wait till our next kiss 
Your so cool 
If I'm dreamin' please don't wake me up 
'Cause baby I can't get enough 
Of what you do 

And I'm in so electrically 
Charged up kinetically 
Actin' erractically 
Need you fanatically 
You get to me magically 
Sure as the sky is blue 
Baby I love you 

I can't believe that this is real 
The way I feel 
Baby I'm gone head over heels 

And I'm in so totally 
Wrapped up emotionally 
Attracted so physically 
Actin' so recklessly 
I need you so desperately 
Sure as the sky is blue 

And I'm in so electrically 
Charged up kinetically 
Actin' erractically 
Need you fanatically 
You get to me magically 
Sure as the sky is blue 
Baby I love you 
Baby I love you 
Do you love me too 
Baby I love you
