Where I used to have a heart 
Feels like a mile wide ditch 
I got a hole inside 
The doctor just can't stitch 
Gone without a trace 
You left a hollow place 
There's not a stone to mark 
Where I used to have a heart 

There were times when I would hold you 
And feel the pounding in my chest 
Now I'm just as empty 
As a canyon way out west 
That's how deep I loved you 
And babe, I love you still 
To the bottom of this place I'll never fill 

Where I used to have a heart 
Feels like a mile wide ditch 
I got a hole inside 
The doctor just can't stitch 
Gone without a trace 
You left a hollow place 
There's not a stone to mark 
Where I used to have a heart 

I guess I'll learn to live with 
A different kind of pain 
I'm suffering from a sickness 
That I cannot give a name 
Such a strange sensation 
I've never felt before 
Missing you has cut me to the core 

Where I used to have a heart 
Feels like a mile wide ditch 
I got a hole inside 
The doctor just can't stitch 
Gone without a trace 
You left a hollow place 
There's not a stone to mark 
Where I used to have a heart 
Where I used to have a heart
