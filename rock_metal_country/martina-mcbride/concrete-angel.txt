She walks to school with the lunch she packed 
Nobody knows what she's holdin' back 
Wearin' the same dress she wore yesterday 
She hides the bruises with linen and lace 

The teacher wonders but she doesn't ask 
It's hard to see the pain behind the mask 
Bearing the burden of a secret storm 
Sometimes she wishes she was never born 

Through the wind and the rain 
She stands hard as a stone 
In a world that she can't rise above 
But her dreams give her wings 
And she flies to a place where she's loved 
Concrete angel 

Somebody cries in the middle of the night 
The neighbors hear, but they turn out the lights 
A fragile soul caught in the hands of fate 
When morning comes it'll be too late 

Through the wind and the rain 
She stands hard as a stone 
In a world that she can't rise above 
But her dreams give her wings 
And she flies to a place where she's loved 
Concrete angel 

A statue stands in a shaded place 
An angel girl with an upturned face 
A name is written on a polished rock 
A broken heart that the world forgot 

Through the wind and the rain 
She stands hard as a stone 
In a world that she can't rise above 
But her dreams give her wings 
And she flies to a place where she's loved 
Concrete angel
