I know she must've cut you deep 
She's gone but you won't let her leave 
I know your heart has not healed yet 
But sometimes I think that you forget 

That wasn't me 
That wasn't me 
I'm not the one 
Who made love bring you to your knees 
You can't love if you can't trust 
Her memory's hurt you long enough 
Let your heart see 
That wasn't me 

I can no longer pay the price 
For damage done by her careless lies 
We can't move on 'til you let go 
I always thought by now you'd know 

That wasn't me 
That wasn't me 
I'm not the one 
Who made love bring you to your knees 
You can't love if you can't trust 
Her memory's hurt you long enough 
Let your heart see 
That wasn't me 

You can't love if you can't trust 
Her memory's hurt you long enough 
Let your heart see 
That wasn't me
