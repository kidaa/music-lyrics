There's a silence on the front lines 
You can cut it with a knife 
You can stay and take your chances 
Or you can run to save your life 
And one side is retreating 
And the other's runnin' scared 
And the drums of war are beating 
Ever through it's undeclared 

And both sides say they're winning 
And both sides know they're losing 
And neither one knows what they're fighting for 
And in the quiet little places 
You can see the little faces 
Huddled right outside the bedroom door 
Praying for an end to this uncivil war 

Papa needs a new job 
So he's swallowing his pride 
Oh but it don't go down easy 
And it eats him up inside 
And mama, she don't notice 
Little sister's ragged dress 
Lately she don't notice 
Much of anything I guess 

They're just fightin' off the hunger 
Tryin' to keep from goin' under 
But the wolves just keep on gatherin' 'round the door 
There's no place to run for cover 
So they're turning on each other 
'Cause there really ain't no winners anymore 
Just victims in this uncivil war 

There's a silence on the front lines 
You can cut it with a knife 
You can stay and take your chances 
Or you can run to save your life
