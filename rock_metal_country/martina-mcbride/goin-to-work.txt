The alarm went off but I wasn't asleep 
After tossin' and turnin' all night what a relief 
To go to work, get up and go to work 
So I get onto the highway and I head into town 
There's one part of my life I won't let you tear down 
Yeah and that's my work-right now I'm goin' to work 

When the whistle blows, I'll be there 
Life goes on even when it's not fair 
And who's got time to hurt, right now 
I got to go to work 

Now I remember what it is I do 
For a while I thought my life was just loving you 
But now it's back to work 
Oh thank God for my work 
So from nine to five I take a break from an empty 
Bed and a heart that aches, I'm good at my work 
Oh I'm good at my work 

When the whistle blows, I'll be there 
Life goes on even when it's not fair 
And who's got time to hurt, right now 
I got to go to work 

Oh I got to stay busy that's the only way 
Throw myself into my business and collect my pay 
Watch me keep it together while I fall apart 
'Cause a world won't stop for a broken heart 
Oh no, no 

When the whistle blows, I'll be there 
Life goes on even when it's not fair 
And who's got time to hurt, right now 
I got to go to work 
Watch me I'm goin' to work 
Oh yeah you know I'm good at my work 
Right now I'm goin' to work 
Goin' to work
