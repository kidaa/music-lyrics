I'm keeping my calandar open 
Even if it takes me years 
'Til you figure out what your plan is 
You figure out all of your fears 
I don't wanna know anything about her 
Or what you feel like you have to defend 
But I've seen your situation 
And the world she keeps you in 

I'm keeping my distance 
I'm keeping my distance 
And I'll wait until my time is here 
I'm keeping my distance 
I'm keeping my distance 
And I'll wait until you make it clear 

If you don't want to rush it baby 
Well then by all means don't 
But I'm gonna wait for the day when 
When you see that it's me you want 
I can see, I can tell that you need me 
You know that I need you too 
So why on earth can't you ever let her go 
Will you ever try anything new 

I'm keeping my distance 
I'm keeping my distance 
And I'll wait until my time is here 
I'm keeping my distance 
I'm keeping my distance 
And I'll wait until you make it clear 

Where will you find the strength 
I can't hold you against your will 
You keep me at arm's length 
I'm reaching out to hold you still, yeah, yeah, yeah 

I can see that you need me 
You know that I need you too 
So why on earth can't you ever let her go 
Will you ever try anything new 

I'm keeping my distance 
I'm keeping my distance 
And I'll wait until my time is here 
I'm keeping my distance 
I'm keeping my distance
