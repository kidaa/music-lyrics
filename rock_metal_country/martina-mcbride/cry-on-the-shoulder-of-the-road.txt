I'm rolling out of Bakersfield 
My own private hell on wheels 
But this time I'm gone for good 
I've never gone this far before 
Beyond the slammin' of the back screen door 
But you never loved me like you should 

And there ain't no telling what I'll find 
But I might as well move down the line 
'Cause there's no comfort here in your zip code 
I'd rather break down on the highway 
With no one to share my load 
And cry on the shoulder of the road 

It makes me feel a little low 
Steel guitar on the radio 
And it's kinda scary the way these truckers fly 
So this is how leavin' feels 
Drinking coffee and makin' deals with the One above 
To get me through the night 

'Cause there ain't no telling what I'll find 
But I might as well move down the line 
'Cause there's no comfort here in your zip code 
I'd rather break down on the highway 
With no one to share my load 
And cry on the shoulder of the road 

And there ain't no telling what I'll find But I might as well move down the line 
'Cause there's no comfort here in your zip code 
I'd rather break down on the highway 
With no one to share my load 
And cry on the shoulder of the road 
Cry on the shoulder of the road
