Oh the sun's gonna shine in my life once more love's gonna live here again
Things're gonna be the way they were before love's gonna live here again
Love's gonna live here love's gonna live here love's gonna live here again
No more loneliness only happiness love's gonna live here again
[guitar]
I hear bells're ringin' birds're singin' love's gonna live here again
And I hear bees a hummin' well I know the days're comin' love's gonna live here again
Love's gonna live here...
