You can spend your whole life buildin'
Somethin' from nothin'
One storm can come and blow it all away
Build it anyway

You can chase a dream
That seems so out of reach
And you know it might not ever come your way
Dream it anyway

[chorus]
God id great, but sometimes life ain't good
When I pray it doesn't alway turn out like I think it should
But I do it anyway
I do it anyway

This worlds gone crazy and it's hard to beleive
That tomarrow will be better than today
Beleive it anyway
You can love someone with all your heart
For all the right reasons
An in a moment they can choose to walk away
love 'em anyway
