[Chorus:]
Today I started loving you again

I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
And then today I started loving you again

What a fool I was to think I could get by
With only these few million tears I've cried
I guess I should have known the worst was yet to come
And the crying time for me had just begun

[Repeat Chorus Twice]

Today I started loving you again

Today I started loving you
Today I started loving you again
