She was only ten when her daddy got fired
He drank away the family home and left them all alone
And then her mommy was just too tired
So she got sent away

She moved in with her aunt in Arizona
Everything was fine until she told on Uncle Bill
When he said he only wanted to hold her
She had to run away

[Chorus]
But when it rains, the past gets washed away, and then
She smiles 'cause she knows in the end
The world gets beautiful, beautiful again

Her boyfriend said I'm way too young to get married
But she made up her mind that somehow she was gonna
Find a way to keep that baby she carried
And he just walked away

[Repeat Chorus]

And when she's lying all alone
Thinkin' about her life she wonders
If she is wrong to believe in a better world
Then she sees her little girl
And she knows she is right 'cause

[Repeat Chorus]
