I tried to hold our love together 
But you let us fall apart 
Now your leaving me for someone else 
Taking what's left of my heart 
But this time the pain don't feel that same 
I'm not aching like I should 
'Cause loving you has hurt so bad 
That losing you feels good 

I know you'll come back running to me 
When the thrill is dead and gone 
And you realize the love you need 
Was right here all along 
When you try to restore what we had before 
There's no way you ever could 
'Cause loving you has hurt so bad 
That losing you feels good 

Don't get me wrong I'll still long to hold you every night 
But my heart can't take another break 
When there's no relief in sight 

I guess you're wonderin' why I haven't cried 
'Cause usually I would 
But loving you has hurt so bad 
That losing you feels good 

If there was a way to make you stay 
I wouldn't if I could 
'Cause loving you has hurt so bad 
That losing you feels good
