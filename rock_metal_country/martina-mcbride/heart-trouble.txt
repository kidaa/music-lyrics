The way you treat me baby 
Cheat and tell me lies 
I guess I shouldn't care at all 
But still I sympathize 
'Cause you got heart trouble comin' on 
Yeah you got heart trouble comin' on 
Well you think that you don't need me baby 
But you're gonna miss me when I'm gone 

You say that love can't touch you 
You feel no pain at all 
You think that you're above it baby 
But I believe you'll fall 
'Cause you got heart trouble comin' on 
Yeah you got heart trouble comin' on 
Well you'll get down on you knees baby 
Begging me to come back home 

You tell me you'll find someone else 
But no one's gonna care 
'Cause you have left a trail 
Of broken hearts everywhere 
Now you got heart trouble comin' on 
Yeah you got heart trouble comin' on 
Well you'll know just how it feels baby 
When you're left here all alone
