There's a photo in an album he don't notice anymore 
That's me, that's me 
There's a stack of cards and letters buried deep inside a drawer 
That's me, that's me 
And the shirt that I once slept in hanging loose behind the door 
Tossed aside so carelessly 
That's me, oh that's me 

There's a picture in my wallet and one less faded in my mind 
That's him, that's him 
There's a name that always haunts me and it slips from time to time 
That's him, that's him 
There's a yearning that I feel in my heart and in my soul 
An old flame that'll never dim 
That's him, I know that's him 

That's me 
Hangin' on to the end 
That's me 
Starting all over again 
That's love 
Oh that's the way it goes 

There's a woman in the chapel in the back row by herself 
That's me, that's me 
And a man at the altar says "I do" to someone else 
That's him, that's him 
As the wedding party leaves throwing rice and wishing well 
A single tear falls silently 
That's me, oh Lord that's me 

Oh, that's me 
That's me
