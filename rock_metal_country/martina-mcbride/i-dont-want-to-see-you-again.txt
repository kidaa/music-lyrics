I don't want to see you 
'Cause I don't want to feel you 

Don't look so surprised 
I told you that I'd say good-bye 
If you couldn't just make up your mind 
You keep saying love can wait 
But I can't and it's too late 
This old heart has just run out of time 

I don't want to see you 
'Cause I don't want to feel you 
I don't want a love that I can't win baby 
I don't want you to call 
'Cause if I can't have it all 
I don't want to see you again 

When your new life gets you down 
Don't be tempted to come around 
Just think of all the times I let you slide 
And when your teardrops finally come 
You'll realize that I'm the one 
But I won't be there when it's your turn to cry 

I don't want to see you 
'Cause I don't want to feel you 
I don't want a love that I can't win baby 
I don't want you to call 
'Cause if I can't have it all 
I don't want to see you 

I don't want to see you 
I don't want to feel you 
I don't want a love that I can't win baby 
I don't want you to call 
'Cause if I can't have it all 
I don't want to see you again
