My heart's not ready for the rocking chair 
I need somebody who really cares 
So tired of livin' solitaire 
Someday I'm gonna be 
Safe in the arms of love 

Strip your heart and it starts to snow 
Love is a high-wire act I know 
Someday I'll find a net below 

Someday I'm gonna be 
Safe in the arms of love 
Safe in the arms of love 

I want arms that know how to rock me 
Safe in the arms of love 
I wanna fall and know that love has caught me 
Safe in the arms of love 
Safe in the arms of love 

I want a heart to be forever mine 
Want eyes to see me satisfied 
Gonna hang my heartaches out to dry 
Some day I'm gonna be safe in the arms of love 
Safe in the arms of love 

I want arms that know how to rock me 
Safe in the arms of love 
I wanna fall and know that love has caught me 
Safe in the arms of love 
Safe in the arms of love 
Safe in the arms of love
