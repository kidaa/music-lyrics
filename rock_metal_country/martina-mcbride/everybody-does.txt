This ain't the first time you've fallen in love
With your heart wide open
Feeling just like a fool knowing that
You're the only one left holding on
He broke your heart
You can't cry hard enough
But you're not the only one

[Chorus]
Everybody loves someone
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody says they'll never fall again
But everybody does
Yeah, everybody does

How many times have you said he's the one
And found out that he wasn't
Always thinking it's gonna hurt forever
But then one day it doesn't anymore
You've come so far
Still a long way to go
Just remember you're never alone

[Repeat Chorus]

Everybody jumps in
Never really knowin'
Where it's really goin'
You just have to trust in
Your heart, oh yeah

[Repeat Chorus]
