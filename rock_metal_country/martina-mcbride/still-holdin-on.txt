There's something out there left for you 
But it's not me 
We've reached a point of no return 
It's only right I set you free 

I know I'll have to turn away 
But there's nowhere for my love to go 
And there won't come a day 
When I won't honor what we've vowed 

But I'll go on with my life 
We can even say goodbye for now if 
If that's what we have to do 
But here in my heart 
Even when my arms are empty darlin' 
I'm still holdin' on to you 

We can't deny that this one's 
Out of our control 
Stronger than the both of us 
And bound to take its toll 

I can stand the test of time 
And as far as I can see 
There are no walls that we can't climb 
Standin' between you and me 

But I'll go on with my life 
We can even say goodbye for now if 
If that's what we have to do 
But here in my heart 
Even when my arms are empty darlin' 
I'm still holdin' on to you 

And there's a place you'll always be 
No matter where you are 
You're here with me 
When the world is turning upside down 
Together we can stand our ground 

We can even say goodbye for now if 
If that's what we have to do 
But here in my heart 
Even when my arms are empty darlin' 
I'm still holdin' on to you 

I'm still holdin' on to you... 
When I'm gone 
When I'm gone 
I'm holdin' on
