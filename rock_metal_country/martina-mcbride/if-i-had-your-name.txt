If I was a raindrop I would be fallin'
I would be fallin' by now
If I was a rocket I would be flyin'
I would be flyin' by now
If I was a wise man I would be doin'
What I should be doin' by now

[Chorus]
'Cause you're like a new key made with the wrong cut
Stuck tryin' to break into my home
You're like a bottle sent with a message
But you're sinkin' like a stone
If I had your name
I'd be changin' it right now

If I was a blanket I would be foldin'
I would be foldin' by now
If I was a fast train I would be speedin'
Smokin' and steamin' with a hell of a sound
If I was a gambler I'd go for the quick win
I'd cash all my chips in and get outta town

[Repeat Chorus]

[Repeat Chorus]
