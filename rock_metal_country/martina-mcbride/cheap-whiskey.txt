He sits all alone in his easy chair 
Staring back on his lost yesterdays 
Long before he encountered the bottle 
And the demons that drove her away 

In his hand he is holding her photograph 
Her image all tear-stained and worn 
Tonight he's embracing reality 
And he curses the day he was born 

And the darkness still echoes her warning 
You can't have two loves in your life 
Now the things that will haunt him 
Until the day that he dies 
Is the smell of cheap whiskey 
And the sound of goodbye 

Since the hour that she left he's been sober 
And each breath that he draws makes him think 
About the light of his life gone forever 
When he traded her love for a drink 

And the darkness still echoes her warning 
You can't have two loves in your life 
Now the things that will haunt him 
Until the day that he dies 
Is the smell of cheap whiskey 
And the sound of goodbye 
The smell of cheap whiskey 
And the sound of goodbye
