You think I'm always makin' 
Something out of nothin' 
You're sayin' everything's okay 
You've always got an answer 
Before I ask the question 
Whatever you say 

Now we can change the subject 
Pretend I never brought it up 
Same old story anyway 
Later we can work it out 
Right now you're talked out 
Yeah, whatever you say 

Oh I know you can hear me 
But I'm not sure you're listening 
I hear what you're sayin' 
But still there's somthing missin' 
Whether I go whether I stay 
Right now depends on 
Whatever you say 

You say yes you need me 
And no you wouldn't leave me 
And this should be enough to make me stay 
And even though I want to 
I don't hear I love you 
In whatever you say 

Oh I know you can hear me 
But I'm not sure you're listening 
I hear what you're sayin' 
But still there's somthing missin' 
Whether I go whether I stay 
Right now depends on 
Whatever you say 

Oh whether I go whether I stay 
Right now depends on 
Whatever you say 
Whatever you say 
Whatever you say
