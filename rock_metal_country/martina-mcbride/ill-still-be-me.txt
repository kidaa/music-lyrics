Woke up in the middle of the night and saw you sleepin'
I was hopin' you were dreamin' about me
Kissed your cheek and said "I love you"
You reached for me and then you mumbled
"I love you too, is everything ok?"

I said I'm fine baby, go back to sleep
I've just been thinkin' life is changin' 'round us
And I hope you believe

I'll still be me
Just a normal girl from small town nowhere
I'll still hold your hand and wear this ring
I'll still be me
If you can count on one thing, I'll be here
The same girl that you've known for centuries
I'll still be me

We said we wanted all of this
We made the plans together
And promised that we'd never forget
Drinkin' apple wine in our first kitchen
Throwin' pennies in the well and wishin'
We'd spend our lives forever holdin' hands

And here we are still holdin' on
But if all the pretty things tied up in bows were gone

I'll still be me
Just a normal girl from small town nowhere
I'll still laugh at your jokes and argue over silly things
I'll still be me
If you can count on one thing, I'll be here
The same girl that you've known for centuries
I'll still be me

Empires could rise and fall
The sun could swallow the moon
And I don't hold a crystal ball
But I promise you

I'll still be me
Just a normal girl from small town nowhere
I'll still be the mommy of our babies
I'll still be me
If you can count on one thing, I'll be here
The same girl that you've known for centuries
I'll still be me
