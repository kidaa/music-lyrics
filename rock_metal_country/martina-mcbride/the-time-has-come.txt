The time has come to let you go 
My tears will run and they'll keep me afloat 
I set you adrift like a burning boat 
The time has come to let you go 

The time has come to turn you loose 
It took my heart this long to face the truth 
If I lost you I can lose these blues 
The time has come to turn you loose 

We had our moment in the sun 
But that time has come and now that time is gone 

The time has come to set you free 
Tonight's the night I'll untie all these dreams 
I'll send them away so I can find some piece 
The time has come to set you free 

The time has come to let you go 
My tears will run and they'll keep me afloat 
I set you adrift like a burning boat 
The time has come to let you go 
I'm gonna let you go
