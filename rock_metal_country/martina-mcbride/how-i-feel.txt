Confetti fallin' from the sky
My hometown on the 4th of July
A midnight snow on Christmas Eve
Like standin' up for what you believe

[Chorus]
That's how I feel when I'm with you
That's how I feel when I'm with you
That's how I feel
That's how I feel when I'm with you

Your lucky coat, the first day of fall
When you wake up laughin' just because
An old church door that stays wide open
A perfect heart that's never been broken

[Repeat Chorus]

That's how I feel when I'm with you
Every day there's something new
To cry about, to laugh about
Those moments I can't live without
That's how I feel
That's how I feel
When I'm with you
