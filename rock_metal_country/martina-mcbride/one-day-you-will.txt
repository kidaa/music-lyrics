I am timeless, I am patient 
I'm beside you and above 
I'm the words when you need comfort 
I'm the feeling you call love 

You say that you can take or leave me 
You think right now that you don't need me 
Some way, somehow young heart believe me 
One day you will 
One day you will 

You're a vessel, your a temple 
You're a journey just begun 
You're a young one who is running 
You are destined to find love 

And when you're lost, that's when you'll find me 
We can't see till we are blinded 
It's already all been decided 
That one day you will 
One day you will 

You say that you can take or leave me 
You think right now that you don't need me 
Some way, somehow young heart believe me 
One day you will 
One day you will 
One day you will 

I am timeless, I am patient 
I'm the feeling you call love
