Don't need no copy of Vogue magazine 
Don't need to dress like no beauty queen 
High heels or sneakers he don't give a damn 
My baby loves me just the way that I am 
My baby loves me just the way that I am 

He never tells me I'm not good enough 
Just give me unconditional love 
He loves me tender and he loves me mad 
He loves me silly and he loves me sad 

He thinks I'm pretty, he thinks I'm smart 
He likes my nerve and he loves my heart 
He's always sayin' he's my biggest fan 
My baby loves me just the way that I am 
My baby loves me just the way that I am 

When there's dark clouds in my eyes 
He just sits back and lets 'em roll on by 
I come in like a lion and go out like a lamb 
My baby loves me just the way that I am 
My baby loves me just the way that I am 

He thinks I'm pretty, he thinks I'm smart 
He likes my nerve and he loves my heart 
He's always sayin' he's my biggest fan 
My baby loves me just the way that I am 
He thinks I'm pretty, he thinks I'm smart 
He likes my nerve and he loves my heart 
Don't see no reason to change my plan 
My baby loves me just the way that I am 
My baby loves me just the way that I am
