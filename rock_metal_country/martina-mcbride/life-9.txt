Don't tell me no stories I don't wanna hear no lies 
No reasons, or excuses, none of you alibis 
The phone rings I pick it up nobody's on the line 
I know she's waiting for you she's just biding her time 
You'd have me believe it's just a night out with your friends 
But I know you're going back to see her again 

You're stealing love 
Living on life #9 
Breaking my heart 
Living on borrowed time 
You're cattin' around 
Playing with fire 
You're stealing love 
Living on life #9 

Your runnin' on empty troubles on every side 
You've used up your last chance 
You've got no place to hide 
I'm tired of these heartaches tired of livin' a lie 
Go to her she's waitin' 
But someday you're gonna find 
The grass ain't always greener on the other side 
Now what you thought was love was what you left behind 

You're stealing love 
Living on life #9 
Breaking my heart 
Living on borrowed time 
You're cattin' around 
Playing with fire 
You're stealing love 
Living on life #9 

You're stealing love 
Living on life #9 
Breaking my heart 
Living on borrowed time 
You're cattin' around 
Playing with fire 
You're stealing love 
Living on life #9
