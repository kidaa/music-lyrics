It's been a while since she heard him say 
See you tonight his usual way 
There's always some place he's gotta go 
Somewhere he needs to be 

And it's not the same now when they touch 
But she figures he's just working too much 
Somehow that makes it all okay 
And gets her through another day 

She's heard the talk all over town 
But she don't wanna believe he's runnin' around 
Deep down in her heart she's willing to bet 
Oh but she ain't seen nothin' yet 

She wouldn't read that heart shaped note 
She found in the pocket of his coat 
That time in the car she found an earring 
You know that doesn't prove a thing 

She's heard the talk all over town 
But she don't wanna believe he's runnin' around 
Deep down in her heart she's willing to bet 
Oh but she ain't seen nothin' yet 

He's not the same man that she met 
Oh but she ain't seen nothin' yet 
She thinks it's as bad as it's gonna get 
Oh but she ain't seen nothin' yet
