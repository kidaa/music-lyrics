I have listen to the sound 
Of a lonely night 
Gone a thousand miles 
Through a storm-filled sky 
Looking for some light 

Never dreamed of turning back 
But faced the wind instead 
'Cause I knew somewhere 
You'd be waiting there 
Down the road ahead 

All through the longest night 
Your burning light did shine 
Like little bits of lightning 
Lighting up the whole world with your flame 
Every day to make it better 
Strong enough to carry the weight 
Your love became my saving grace 
Like little bits of lightning 
Shining through the rain 

If I should ever lose my way 
Find the strength in me is gone 
I won't worry what to do 
'Cause Darlin' I know you 
Will come and take me home 

All through the longest night 
Your burning light did shine 
Like little bits of lightning 
Lighting up the whole world with your flame 
Every day to make it better 
Strong enough to carry the weight 
Your love became my saving grace 
Like little bits of lightning 
Shining through the rain 

Strong enough to carry the weight 
Your love became my saving grace 
The kind of feelin' words can't explain 
Like little bits of lightning 
Shining through the rain 
Like little bits of lightning 
Shining through the rain
