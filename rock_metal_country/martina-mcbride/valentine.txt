If there were no words 
No way to speak 
I would still hear you 
If there were no tears 
No way to feel inside 
I'd still feel for you 

And even if the sun refused to shine 
Even if romance ran out of rhyme 
You would still have my heart until the end of time 
You're all I need, my love, my Valentine 

All of my life 
I have been waiting for 
All you give to me 
You've opened my eyes 
And shown me how to love unselfishly 

I've dreamed of this a thousand times before 
But in my dreams I couldn't love you more 
I will give you my heart 
Until the end of time 
You're all I need, my love, my Valentine 

And even if the sun refused to shine 
Even if romance ran out of rhyme 
You would still have my heart until the end of time 
'Cause all I need is you, my Valentine 
You're all I need, my love, my Valentine
