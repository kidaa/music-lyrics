See that cowboy at the bar
The one at the end with all the scars
He got stomped by the meanest bronc in Santa Fe
But if he looks a little down and out
It ain't that bronc he's thinking about
It's that girl that broke his heart along the way
When a cowboy falls he falls hard
Sometimes he falls way too far
But you can bet that when he hits the ground
He'll get back up and play the part
Even with a broken heart
He'll hold the reins and hide the pain inside
Love's always a cowboy's toughest ride
Girl, just listen to me now
I should know what I'm talking about
Everything I learned I learned from you
I have rode broncs from hell
And it hurt me every time I fell
But not half as much pain as you put me through
When a cowboy falls he falls hard
Sometimes he falls way too far
But you can bet that when he hits the ground
He'll get back up and play the part
Even with a broken heart
He'll hold the reins and hide the pain inside
Love's always a cowboy's toughest ride
