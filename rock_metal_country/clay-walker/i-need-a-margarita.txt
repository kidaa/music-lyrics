Met a little senorita named Margarita down in Mexico 
She taught me more about love in a day or two than I'll ever know 
I had to go back across the Rio Grande 
And leave that little girl behind
I can't believe how heavy she's laying on my mind
Oh tonight I need a Margarita and I need it bad 
I'm hoping that the tequila is gonna take me back 
Give me the salt and the lime 
So I can taste her and hold her one last time
Oh tonight I need a Margarita and I need her bad
Those eyes and that smile they drove me while, I just couldn't resist 
I couldn't get enough from our first touch to our last kiss
I never understood a single word she said 
Oh but she left no doubt 
When she spoke to me in the language of love 
She turned my world inside out
Oh tonight I need a Margarita and I need it bad 
I'm hoping that the tequila is gonna take me back 
Give me the salt and the lime 
So I can taste her and hold her one last time
Oh tonight I need a Margarita and I need her bad
