Aaron Barker/Tom Shapiro
I can't sleep at all
I'm making late night calls
Just to talk to you and hear your voice again
That flower shop on Main
Knows me by my first name
And how I want the card to read
And where I want the roses sent
Now I'm not saying I'm in love
I'd admit it if I was
I'm just saying I believe
You're beginning to get to me
The way I need you all time
The way you hold this heart of mine
I think it's time I concede
You're beginning to get to me
Got your picture up
On the dash of my new truck
So I can have you with me on every road I'm on
babe what I feel
Is just the tip of what I will
I can only guess what it will be like
When I'm completly gone
Now I'm not saying I'm in love
I'd admit it if I was
I'm just saying I believe
You're beginning to get to me
The way I need you all time
The way you hold this heart of mine
I think it's time I concede
You're beginning to get to me
Now I'm not saying I'm in love
I'd admit it if I was
I'm just saying I believe
You're beginning to get to me
The way I need you all time
The way you hold this heart of mine
I think it's time I concede
You're beginning to get to me
