Clay Walker
Solid gold candle holders
And an old bottle of wine
You let your hair down on your shoulders
And you pressed your lips to mine
The rain beat soft against the window
As the night turned into dawn
As I looked deep into your eyes
I knew where my heart belonged
I'm ready for the next step in love
Girl, you're all that I can think of
Isn't my love good enough
I'm ready for the next step in love
Solid white wedding dress
And a long white veil
We put all our fears to rest
And we let this ship set sail
I placed the ring on your finger
Then you looked at me and smiled
The we sealed our love with one last kiss
And I walked you up the aisle
I'm ready for the next step in love
Girl, you're all that I can think of
Isn't my love good enough
I'm ready for the next step in love
I'm ready for the next step in love
Girl, you're all that I can think of
Isn't my love good enough
I'm ready for the next step in love
I'm ready for the next step in love
