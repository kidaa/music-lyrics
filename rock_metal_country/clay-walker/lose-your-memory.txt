Last night is the last time she's ever leavin' me
'Cause I've taken all the past times and I've stored 'em in my memory
She probably thinks I'm crazy
She probably thinks I've lost my mind
'Cause when she drove away, well I just waved goodbye
It's been one time, two times, three times more
Than I can bear to stand
The clock is stopped from that slammin' door
And I can't turn the hands
Well I've lost track of time, but you're still right here with me
'Cause honey I might lose my mind, but I'll never lose your memory
Everybody asks me how I got over you
Well I just tell them that we are just about overdue
Well it don't matter how far you go, cause you're never far from me
'Cause honey I might lose my mind, but I'll never lose your memory
It's been one time, two times, three times more
Than I can bear to stand
The clock is stopped from that slammin' door
And I can't turn the hands
Well I've lost track of time, but you're still right here with me
'Cause honey I might lose my mind, but I'll never lose your memory
Baby, you made me lose my mind, but I'll never lose your memory
