Clay Walker/Kent Blazy/Kim Williams
She's got a mind of her own
But her heart belongs to me
Oh, she could make it alone
But where on earth would I be
She'll listen but she won't do
What she's told
Sometime's she's hard to handle
But she's always easy to hold
She's strong enough
To stand on her own two feet
Oh but I'm so glad
Sometimes she leans on me
She's the kind of woman
That no man can control
Sometimes she's hard to handle
But she's always easy to hold
When she don't
Get what she wants
There's hell to pay
And the truth be known
I wouldn't want her
Any other way
There's some devil in every angel
There are thorns with every rose
Sometimes she's
Hard to handle
But she's always easy to hold
