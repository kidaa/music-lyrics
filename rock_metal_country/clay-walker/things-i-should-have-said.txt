Shawna Harrington-Burkhart/John Paul Daniel
I love you so much in so many ways
I need you more and more every day
I want to spend my life with you
My love will never end
These are a few of the things
I should have said
Before you gave up on me
And walked out the door
Before you found someone else
You thought loved you more
He probably told you everything
That's running through my head
Now it's much too late to say
The things I should have said
You told me just as plain as it could be
How you needed to hear some words of love from me
I never thought it mattered much
Now it sure looks like it did
Oh, why didn't I say the things
I should have said
Before you gave up on me
And walked out the door
Before you found someone else
You thought loved you more
He probably told you everything
That's running through my head
Now it's much too late to say
The things I should have said
He probably told you everything
That's running through my head
Now it's much too late to say
The things I should have said
Now I'll never get the chance to say
The things I should have said
