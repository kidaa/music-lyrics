Been tryin' so hard just to talk to you
Haven't heard half of what you want me to
I hurt so bad over where we've been
Don't know how not to go back there again
I know what I wanna say
Can I get it through to you now
In some other way...like
There was this woman and there was this man
There was this moment they had a chance to hold on to what they had
How could they be so in love and still never see
Now nothin' could be sadder than
This woman this woman and this man
A stranger's eyes in a lover's face
See no signs of a better time and place
Have we lost the key to an open door
I feel the need to reach out to you even more
It's a circle we're goin' 'round
If we don't get us out from under
It's gonna take us down...see
There was this woman and there was this man
There was this moment they had a chance to hold on to what they had
How could they be so in love and still never see
Now nothin' could be sadder than
This woman this woman and this man
For all we've got to lose there's so much to gain
If we come this far and leave it behind
There's only you and me to blame...see
There was this woman and there was this man
There was this moment they had a chance to hold on to what they had
How could they be so in love and still never see
Yeah we can get it back again
This woman this woman and this man
Yeah we can bring it back again
This woman this woman and this man
