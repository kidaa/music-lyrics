Jon Robbins/Dickie Kaiser
You stirred up a breeze that felt like heaven
As you walked by
And when you smiled and handed me your number
You changed my life
What could I do but call
Face it girl it's all your fault
You'll never hear the end of it
Girl I'll never get tired
Of sayin' I love you
I'll say it and then
I'll say it again
You'll never hear the end of it
I can promise that I'll never leave you
Room for doubt
Nothing's ever gonna come bewteen us
We can't work out
Our love will go on
Until forever has come and gone
You'll never hear the end of it
Girl I'll never get tired
Of sayin' I love you
I'll say it and then
I'll say it again
You'll never hear the end of it
I don't have a choice
I hope you like
The sound of my voice
You'll never hear the end of it
Girl I'll never get tired
Of sayin' I love you
I'll say it and then
I'll say it again
You'll never hear the end of it
You'll never hear the end of it
