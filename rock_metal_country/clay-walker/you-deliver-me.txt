Deep as the ocean
And right as rain
This powerful emotion
Lifts me up above the plain
Taking me places
I never thought I'd go
Showing me a grace
I never thought I'd know
When I feel like
I can't go on
You deliver me
And when the road is winding
And way too long
You deliver me
You deliver me
I feel like a sinner
Whose sins
Have been washed clean
An absolute beginner
Whose heart has never seen
I must be forgiven
For sometimes asking why
I was chosen to be given
You in this life
When I feel like
I can't go on
You deliver me
And when the road is winding
And way too long
You deliver me
You deliver me
When there's a distance
Between what I am
And who I wanna be
You deliver me
When I feel like
I can't go on
You deliver me
And when the road is winding
And way too long
You deliver me
You deliver me
