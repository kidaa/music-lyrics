Steve Wariner/Bill LaBounty
Back when we let the good times roll
You held on to my heart and soul
It wasn't really very long ago
Let's go back again
Reach out and turn the TV off
Slow down and let the world get lost
Slip into something nice and soft
And lie here in my arms
Love me like you love me
Do it like you mean it one more time tonight
Hold me close and love me like you love me
Take all your dreams and shattered hopes
And every angry word we ever spoke
Trade m in for a couple cherry Cokes
And stay here for a while
There are no questions that we need to ask
Every precious kiss could be our last
There is no future and there is no past
All we've got is now
Love me like you love me
Do it like you mean it one more time tonight
Hold me close and love me like you love me
