Clay Walker/M. Jason Greene
Everything I touch turns to ashes
So I wouldn't dare lay a hand on you
I've never had much luck with passion
But I can tell you're wantin' me too
Everytime you look my way I shiver
I'm havin' a hard time keepin' my cool
I see the message your eyes deliver
Or is it just the smoke in the room
I feel the heat
It's gettin' harder and harder to breathe
I feel the sweat
Rollin' down the nape of my neck
You're burnin' me up
Just look at this ragin' fire you started
Don't stop now
Baby you're cold hearted
Well I've always been a little bit reckless
Oh and now here I am playin' with fire
With every sweet kiss from your red lips
You make my temperature rise
I feel the heat
It's gettin' harder and harder to breathe
I feel the sweat
Rollin' down the nape of my neck
You're burnin' me up
Just look at this ragin' fire you started
Don't stop now
Baby that's cold hearted
I feel the heat
It's gettin' harder and harder to breathe
I feel the sweat
Rollin' down the nape of my neck
Oh you're burnin' me up
Oh look at this ragin' fire you started
Don't stop now
Baby that's cold hearted
