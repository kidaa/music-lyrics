If you've never felt what happens when two hearts
Fall together
Or never seen love written in the stars
And knew it was forever
If you dont believe that destiny
Can start with just one wish
Watch this
I'll show you love like you've dreamed of
I've got so much to give
Watch this
Dont be afraid, you'll be amazed
At all the ways that I can
Show you what you've missed
Just close your eyes
And watch this
A broken heart cant always live in fear
Afraid to fall
I can make those feelings disappear
In no time at all
If you wanna feel the world stand still
From the magic of one kiss
Watch this
I'll show you love like you've dreamed of
I've got so much to give
Watch this
Dont be afraid, you'll be amazed
At all the ways that I can
Show you what you've missed
Just close your eyes
And watch this
