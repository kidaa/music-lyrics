Bucky Jone/Ed Hill
Kindergarten, five years old
You and me and mother goose
Learning lines to nursery rhymes
That's when I feel in love with you
Back when it was
One, two buckle my shoe
Three Four shut the door
Five Six pick up sticks
Even then my heart was yours
College days miles apart
So afraid you'd forgot
Writing letters every day 
And ending every one like this
One two I miss you
Three Four I walk the floor
Five Six come back quick
I dont wanna miss you no more
A little girl and little boy
Playing on a swing in the yard
As we watch I hold your hand
And you're still holding onto my heart
And now its 
One two I love you
Three four lets have one more
Five six I wouldnt miss
A day of this for all the treasure on the ocean floor
One two I love you
Three four let's shut the door
Five six, kiss after kiss
I cant wait to hold you once more
