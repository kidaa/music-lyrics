I love flying down the road
Buddy make this big rig roll
We got miles and miles to go
Before we sleep
>From the big sky of Montana
To the peaches in Savannah
We're on our way to play that
Texas swing
Dallas, Ft. Worth, Amarillo
On down to San Antone
Gonna turn it loose in Houston
Y'all it's good to be back home
Lubbock, Texarkana, Corpus
Austin, Abilene
Man we love to play that Texas swing
Saw the lights in New York City
Up in Maine the leaves were pretty
California knows what Western
Really means
Partied down in Arizona
Swung up through Oklahoma
Now we're all turned up to do that
Texas swing
Dallas, Ft. Worth, Amarillo
On down to San Antone
Gonna turn it loose in Houston
Y'all it's good to be back home
Lubbock, Texarkana, Corpus
Austin, Abilene
Man we love to play that Texas swing
