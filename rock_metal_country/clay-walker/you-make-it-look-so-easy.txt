I never thought it would hurt me so bad
Seein' you look so good
You're moving on and you're not lookin' back
Just like I hoped I would
How do you stop lovin' someone
And turn what we had into nothin'
I wish I could
You make it look so easy
The way that you got over me
You act as if your leavin' was natural as the air you breathe
You're so together while I'm fallin' apart
You make it look so easy
And that's what makes it so hard
I've seen you out at at the places we went
Dancin' with someone new
You didn't take long to start livin' again
After our life was through
How do you let go of the good times
With a wave of your hand and a goodbye
I wish I knew
You make it look so easy
The way that you got over me
You act as if your leavin' was natural as the air you breathe
And you're so together while I'm fallin' apart
You make it look so easy
And that's what makes it so hard
You make it look so easy
And that's what makes it so hard
