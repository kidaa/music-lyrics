Tom Shaprio/George Teren
You're telling me
We gotta talk
That you can't go on
Holdin' it inside
No it isn't
Anybody's fault
I shouldn't blame myself
You know I tried
You thought it through
How you agonized
Though it took some time
Now you know for sure
What we have really isn't what
You're looking for
Say no more
Baby I get the picture
Say no more
'Cause I'll never understand
How you fell out of love
But you spelled it out enough
I'll be ok
And you'll be ok
Please walk away
And say no more
No it really doesn't
Ease the pain
When you say you wish
It had all worked out
And being sorry
Isn't gonna change
What I'm losing here
What I'm feeling now
There'll be nights
When I toss and turn
With your hollow words
Ringing in my ears
I think I heard enough to hurt about
You made it clear
Say no more
Baby I get the picture
Say no more
'Cause I'll never understand
How you fell out of love
But you spelled it out enough
I'll be ok
And you'll be ok
Please walk away
And say no more
