Paul Nelson/Larry Boone/Tracy Lawrence
She loves to buy those designer clothes
And she tends to cry at the picture show
And she'll make plans without telling me
And I don't understand
I guess it's just a woman thing
Oh but whatever it is that I can't figure out
It all comes clear when she walks in
And the lights go down
And it's a mystery that I can't explain
But I love what she does to me
When she's doing that woman thing
Now she'll go on about losing weight
While all along I'm thinking she looks great
I never know where her mood will swing
'Cause I'm just a man
And that's just a woman thing
Oh but whatever it is that I can't figure out
It all comes clear when she walks in
And the lights go down
It's a mystery that I can't explain
But I love what she does to me
When she's doing that woman thing
Oh it's a mystery that I can't explain
I love what she does to me
When she's doing that woman thing
Oh I love what she does to me
When she's doing that woman thing
