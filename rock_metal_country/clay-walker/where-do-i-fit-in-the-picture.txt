Clay Walker
Well it looks like you finally mad the front page
You always did look good in white
And I hope you like the ring of your new name
The one you'll be given tonight
But all of this is news to me
I wondered why you never called
I guess that's the way that it's meant to be
If you're gonna ride you've gatta learn to fall
But...
Where do I fit in the picture
Or do I really fit at all
Or have I become a fixture
On an old forgotten wall
Well it looks like I finally made the front page
You know you always said I would
And things are well here in room 28
God I hope you're doin' good
There's a picture in my wallet that I look at sometimes
It sends chills through my bones
For long lost love or whatever you wanna call it
Whoa, but it left me all alone
Where do I fit in the picture
Or do I really fit at all
Or have I become a fixture
On an old forgotten wall
On an old forgotten wall
