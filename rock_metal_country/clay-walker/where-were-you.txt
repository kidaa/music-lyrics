Tim Mensy
I used to wake up nights
Callin?out your name
Then I'd cry myself back to sleep
Knowing I'd only dreamed
I stayed inside for days
Trapped within my mind
Wonderin?where you had gone
Convinced I could not go on 
Now just when I started feeling
Those hands of time start to healing
You're here at my door
Saying your new dreams
Have led you back to me
Where were you
When I was going crazy
Where were you
Did you know what your leavin?
Put me through
You were feeing lost, last thing I knew
You went off to find yourself
Where were you
I can't pretend I'm strong
Or act like I don't care
But I won't betray my heart
Now that we've come this far
I let you go 'cause I had to
I'll close this door 'cause I need to
This tunnel has a light
It's not that far away
It's brighter every day
Where were you
When I was going crazy
Where were you
Did you know what your leavin?
Put me through
You were feeing lost, last thing I knew
You went off to find yourself
Where were you
