My boss told me again just today
To get my mind on my job
That's so easy for him to say
He's never held you in his arms
And my mind's wherever you are
If a man ain't thinkin' 'bout his woman
If a man ain't thinkin' 'bout love
If a man ain't thinkin' 'bout his woman
Then what's he thinkin' of
Some folks think that I'm lost in space
But I've got my own point of view
If they could see what's goin' on in my head
They'd know why my mind is on you
I'm just doing what my heart tells me to
If a man ain't thinkin' 'bout his woman
If a man ain't thinkin' 'bout love
If a man ain't thinkin' 'bout his woman
Then what's he thinkin' of
I've got a one track mind it's true
My train of thought never leaves you
If a man ain't thinkin' 'bout his woman
If a man ain't thinkin' 'bout love
If a man ain't thinkin' 'bout his woman
What's he thinkin' of
If a man ain't thinkin' 'bout his woman
If a man ain't thinkin' 'bout love
If a man ain't thinkin' 'bout his woman
What's he thinkin' of
