The frost on the ground in this tiny Texas Town
You're packing up the U-Haul in the yard
I gave you everything, all I'm taking is the blame
And you wonder if I'm gonna fall apart
Well darling I just won't have the heart
Chorus:
I won't have the heart to love again
Just ask anyone who knows
No I won't have the heart to love again
You'll be taking it with you when you go
The morning air is cold sending shivers to my soul
But it's warmer than the look I got from you
If you're gonna leave tell me where does that leave me
Don't tell me I'll find somebody new
'Cause darling I won't have the heart to
Chorus
