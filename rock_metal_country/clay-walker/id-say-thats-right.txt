Was I nervous the night I first met you 
Was it love at first sight 
Did I know you were the girl I'd marry
I'd say that's right
When your daddy said, ";Son do you love her
With all your might";
I looked him in the eye and said, ";Yes sir
I'd say that's right
I'd say that's right on the money 
Sure as a summer in Florida's sunny 
I'd say that's right as the rain on a tin roof Texas night
I'd say that's right down the middle 
Ain't no doubt not even a little 
Will I love you for the rest of my life I'd say that's right
If I woke up tomorrow up in heaven 
Saint Peter looked me in the eye 
And said, ";Mister would you rather be with her"; 
I'd say that's right
I'd say that's right on the money 
Sure as a summer in Florida's sunny 
I'd say that's right as the rain on a tin roof Texas night
I'd say that's right down the middle 
Ain't no doubt not even a little 
Will I love you for the rest of my life I'd say that's right
