Clay Walker
I'm not the kind to take things for granted 
A simple mind and two strong working hands 
But at the time I thought my feet were planted 
You came along and uprooted this simple man 
A strong-willed woman with every chance to show it 
But I didn't mind 'cause you made my life worthwhile 
A beautiful woman with every reason to know it 
You liked my courage and honey I sure liked your style
A country boy and city girl makin' life in this old world 
We went against the grain and against all odds 
It don't matter what they say, I'm gonna love you anyway 
And time won't undo what you've gone and done to my heart
I always thought we'd stay together 
And I still think about you from time to time 
But I should have known nothing lasts forever 
But I'd never be the one to say goodbye
And I remember
A country boy and city girl makin' life in this old world 
We went against the grain and against all odds 
It don't matter what they say, I'm gonna love you anyway 
And time won't undo what you've gone and done to my heart
