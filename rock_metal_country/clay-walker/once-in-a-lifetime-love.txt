Girl I know you don't really know me
Still I want you to listen closely
This might sound crazy
But after all isn't love like that
I would be crazy to let this moment pass
What if I don't say what's on my mind
And you walk away
I might live out my life
And never feel this way
What if you are the one
That I'm meant to love
What if tonight is the night
What if once in a lifetime love
Don't come twice
Girl take a chance time is unfolding
We could be blessed without even knowing
Just for a minute
Close your eyes and don't take another breath
'Cause what if you miss it
And it never comes again
What if you don't say what's on your mind
And I walk away
You might live out your life
And never feel this way
What if I am the one
That you're meant to love
And what if tonight is the night
What if once in a lifetime love
Don't come twice
I don't wanna wake up by myself
Years from now wishin'
That I'd told you what I felt
Your eyes are a window to your soul
If you don't open up
I may never know
What if we don't say what's on our minds
And we walk away
We might live out our lives
And never feel this way
What if I am the one
And you are the one
What if tonight is the night
What if once in a lifetime love
Don't come twice
Oh girl what if you are the one
And I am the one
What if tonight is the night
What if once in a lifetime love
Don't come twice
