Aaron Barker/Ron Harbin/Anthony Smith
Now I really should have known
That you'd
Show up sooner or later
Knowin' every Friday night
They always have
Your favorite band
Though someone new
Is with you at our table
Would it be too much
For me to ask
To ask you not to dance
Not tonight, not until
My heart's had some time to heal
Not right now, til I'm gone
I won't be here very long
And when I leave, you can stay
And just dance the night away
But 'til then, do you think
That there's a chance
I could ask you not to dance
I saw you slip the leader of the band
A piece of paper
I knew what song they'd play
Before he took it from your hand
I wonderin' if you'd do me
One last favor
And if the answer's no
I'll understand
Could I ask you not to dance
Not tonight, not until
My heart's had some time to heal
Not right now, til I'm gone
I won't be here very long
And when I leave, you can stay
And just dance the night away
But 'til then, do you think
That there's a chance
I could ask you not to dance
