Clay Walker
Skippin?rocks, skippin?rope
Laughin?at all my best friends jokes
Things I loved when I was a kid
Muddy roads, muddy feet
I didn't live on no blacktop street
Things have changed a lot but I never did
And I don't wanna think about tomorrow
I don't need anything money can buy
I don't have to beg, steal, or borrow
I just wanna live until I die
Livin?right, livin?in this little old town I grew up in
But I still held on to my dreams
Standin?proud, standin?tall
Standin?smack dab in the middle of it all
I don't worry 'bout  things that I can't change
And I don't wanna think about tomorrow
I don't need anything money can buy
I don't have to beg, steal, or borrow
I just wanna live until I die
And everything around me are
Things I dearly love
And every night I get on my knees and thank
The Lord above
And I don't wanna think about tomorrow
I don't need anything money can buy
I don't have to beg, steal, or borrow
I just wanna live until I die
I don't have to beg, steal, or borrow
I just wanna live until I die
