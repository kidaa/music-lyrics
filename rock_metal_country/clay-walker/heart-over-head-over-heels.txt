Straight up strong and steady 
Hard falls I don't take any 
Both feet right beneath me 
Firmly on the ground 
But each time I see you comin' 
The earth moves 
Girl you're somethin' 
I start right into stumblin' 
Catch me now
I'm heart over head over heels over you
Look at what I fell into 
You throw me girl like a tumbleweed on a Tilt-A-Whirl
I'm all turned around, got my down side up 
Either way it looks like what they say about true love's true 
'Cause I'm heart over head over heels over you
I need you to hold me real tight 
Next thing you know I just might 
Break loose and I could fly right into the stratosphere 
Oh girl, are you with me 
Do you feel a little dizzy
This view is a thing of beauty 
Way up here
I'm heart over head over heels over you
Look at what I fell into 
You throw me girl like a tumbleweed on a Tilt-A-Whirl
I'm all turned around, got my down side up 
Either way it looks like what they say about true love's true 
'Cause I'm heart over head over heels over you
