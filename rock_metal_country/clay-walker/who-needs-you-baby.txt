So, long, see you around
Seen all I wanna see of this town
I'm out of time and I'm out of tears
Out of my mind and I'm out of here
Chorus:
Who needs the heartache, who needs the pain
Who needs to hang around and take the blame
Who needs a woman to make him blue
Who needs you baby - I do
Why are you wearing that negligee
Sure makes it hard to walk away
I gotta go, I can't take this abuse
Why are you smiling, would I lie to you
Chorus
You've got your fingers in my hair whispering
in my ear
Filling my head full of doubts
Well tell me just what you think you've got
That I can't live without
Chorus
