You bought my love with a lot of sweet nothin's
Promises and lies
Had all I want of your kind of lovin'
It's time to say goodbye
After all you've given me
Don't look so surprised
What do you want for nothin' baby
A solid gold guarentee
That you get everything you need
But there is no love in it for me
You wanna deal on the way I feel
But I'm not buying that
What do you want for nothin' baby
Your money back
What do you want for nothin' baby
Your money back
I hate to spoil the party baby
But I've got to be on my way
All I wanted was your love
But it was more than you would pay
Now you want a second chance
To give me more of the same
What do you want for nothin' baby
A solid gold guarentee
That you get everything you need
But there is no love in it for me
You wanna deal on the way I feel
But I'm not buying that
What do you want for nothin' baby
Your money back
What do you want for nothin' baby
Your money back
What do you want for nothin' baby
A solid gold guarentee
That you get everything you need
But there is no love in it for me
You wanna deal on the way I feel
But I'm not buying that
What do you want for nothin' baby
Your money back
What do you want for nothin' baby
Your money back
What do you want for nothin' baby
Your money back
What do you want for nothin' baby
Your money back
