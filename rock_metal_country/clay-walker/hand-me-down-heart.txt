Well baby I ain't gonna lie
This ain't my first ride
I've saddled up and bruised my hide a time or two
It's true I'm not a brand-new man
I've been around a block or two and back again
But I've already been broken in
Yeah, I'm the one for you
Chorus:
Well, if you don't mind a hand me down heart
I've got just the thing for you
It's been bruised and it's been used
But it still beats like new
It's got a few burned valves, it's a little worn out
But baby it'll love you true
So if you don't mind a hand me down heart
I've got one for you
I've seen miles and years
I've cried a few thousand tears
But honey let me calm your fears
And leave no doubt
'Cause when you got a rebuilt heart
You only use the very best parts
And it's guaranteed to start lovin?you right now
Chorus
It's been bruised and it's been used 
But it still beats like new
So if you don't mind a hand me down heart
I got one for you
