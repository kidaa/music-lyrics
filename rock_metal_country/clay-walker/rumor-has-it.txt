Darlin' you know its true
The rumor you heard about me loving you
Well I never told a soul, so
Tell me how the whole world know
It must have been the roses and wine
Or maybe this unexplainable smile
They say where there's smoke there's fire
Well I hope its true
Cause rumor has it, you love me too
Well, I got a ring and a plan
But I see you're onto what I'm gonna ask
Well, I never said a thing
Tell me what gave it away
It must have been the roses and wine
Or maybe this unexplainable smile
They say where there's smoke there's fire
Well I hope its true
Cause rumor has it, you love me too
It must have been the roses and wine
Or maybe this unexplainable smile
They say where there's smoke there's fire
Well I hope its true
Cause rumor has it, you love me too
Yes you do
I heard it too
