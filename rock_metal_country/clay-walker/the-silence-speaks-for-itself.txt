There's an oil well down on Johnson's Road
Where we'd go to be alone
I never thought I'd go there by myself
I stood there calling out your name
No one answered just the same

And I've walked through the fires of hell
Are you coming back, Lord, I don't know
I guess the silence speaks for itself
The last time you talked to me
I did all the talkin? now I see
You were telling me there was someone else
What I'd give to hear your voice
But I'm not given any choice
'Cause the silence speaks for itself
I guess the silence...
