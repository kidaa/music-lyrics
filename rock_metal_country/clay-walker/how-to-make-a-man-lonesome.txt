Randy Boudreauz/Kim Williams
Three weeks in Phoenix one night to go
You're lookin?too good and you're standing to close
That song on the jukebox
Your dance-with-me smile
Has got me thinkin?of someone 
I haven't seen in a while
You sure know how to make a man lonesome
I see so much of my woman in you
You sure know how to make a man lonesome
But she knows how to keep her man true
Yes, I know that it's early
Why am I leaving so soon
Well, it's too warm in here
And it's me not the room
And the way that you're starin?
I've seen that look before
You're makin?me want her all that much more
You sure know how to make a man lonesome
I see so much of my woman in you
You sure know how to make a man lonesome
But she knows how to keep her man true
You sure know how to make a man lonesome
But she knows how to keep her man true
