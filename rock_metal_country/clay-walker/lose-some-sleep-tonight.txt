What's that look you're givin' me
Starin' me down with fire in your eyes
But it's alright baby 'cause you look so good
When you're givin' me a hard time
I can tell by your smile
That makin' up might just take a while
Maybe we should lose some sleep tonight
Wrap yourself around this heart of mine
Let's count the stars in each other's eyes
Maybe we should lose some sleep tonight
Yeah that's right I meant what I said
I'm gettin' tired of playin' around
That's enough I've had it to here
Let's settle this right now
Who says that fussin' ain't fun
I hope we're in for a long one
Maybe we should lose some sleep tonight
Wrap yourself around this heart of mine
Let's count the stars in each other's eyes
Maybe we should lose some sleep tonight
Baby lyin' here with you now
Makes me wanna drag this whole thing out
Maybe we should lose some sleep tonight
Wrap yourself around this heart of mine
Let's count the stars in each other's eyes
Maybe we should lose some sleep tonight
Maybe we should lose some sleep tonight
Wrap yourself around this heart of mine
Let's count the stars in each other's eyes
Maybe we should lose some sleep tonight
Maybe we should lose some sleep tonight
Wrap yourself around this heart of mine
Let's count the stars in each other's eyes
Maybe we should lose some sleep tonight
