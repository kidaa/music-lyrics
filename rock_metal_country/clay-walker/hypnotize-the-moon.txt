She knew she caught my eye
And that was all it took
Ain't it strange how forever changed
With just one look
The magic filled the night
She touched my soul like no one else
Yes, the way that woman made me feel
Left me talking to myself
Oh, oh
Chorus:
You better run for cover
You better hide your heart
'Cause once you start to love here
You know you'll never stop
She shines like a diamond
When she walks into a room
She can charm the stars
Hypnotize the moon
Once I held her close
I knew just where I stood
No, you never get a secon chance
To ever feel so good
Then and there I knew
These words were etched in stone
If you can't feel the power of
The greatest love you've known
Chorus
