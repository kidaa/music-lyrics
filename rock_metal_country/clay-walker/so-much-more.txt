Clay Walker/M. Jason Greene
Lyin' in the dark I'm lost in you
I'd do anything you want me to
I've never felt more completed
You're exactly what I needed
You take my breath away
Every time you look at me that way
You look right inside my soul
And I know that you know
That you're all I've ever wanted
And all I've never had
How can we call this love
When it's so much more than that
Listenin' to your heart I'm swept away
Your every move carries me away
Deep in you eyes I see an ocean
That can't be measured by one emotion
You take my breath away
Every time you look at me that way
You look right inside my soul
And I know that you know
That you're all I've ever wanted
And all I've never had
How can we call this love
When it's so much more than that
