I'm a little bit rough around the edges
Yeah, girl I've been known
To fall too hard
I ain't afraid to dance around
On jagged ledges
That's why I'm rough
Around the edges of my heart
I'm a working man
I've got callused hands
And I can't stand a suit and tie
Hey, I'm at home in here
I like this atmosphere
And drinking beer on a Friday night
I've been knowing you
For a dance or two
I think I'd better warn you now
I'm a little bit rough around the edges
Yeah, girl I've been known
To fall too hard
I ain't afraid to dance around
On jagged ledges
That's why I'm rough
Around the edges of my heart
I could fall for you
Before this night is through
And if I do, hey that's okay
I'd like to share my dreams
Friends and front porch swings
The simple things, hey what do you say
You don't know me yet
I work without a net
And what you see is what you get
I'm a little bit rough around the edges
Yeah, girl I've been known
To fall too hard
I ain't afraid to dance around
On jagged ledges
That's why I'm rough
Around the edges of my heart
