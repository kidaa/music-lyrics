Maybe it's the glance from across the room
Or a hint of just the right perfume
Suddenly two strangers become friends
I don't know how love starts
But I sure know how it ends
A few angry words you just can't take back
Cold bitter tears as a suitcase is packed
Next thing you know you're back
To being strangers again
I don't know how love starts
But I sure know how it ends
Maybe it's the way she says your name
And no one else's touch feels quite the same
Suddenly you find you're fallin?in
I don't know how love starts
But I sure know how it ends
A few angry words you just can't take back
Cold bitter tears as a suitcase is packed
Love comes and goes
But don't ask me why or when
I don't know how love starts
But I sure know how it ends
I don't know how love starts
But I sure know how it ends
