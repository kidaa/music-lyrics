Clay Walker/Tim Mensy
Sometimes I ignore reality 
But baby that's me 
I've always been a dreamer 
You'd rather face the cold head truth
But baby that's you, you called it like you see it 
Half the time my head's up in the clouds 
And you're the only thing that keeps me on the ground
That's us
As different as the night and day 
That's us 
But the good Lord had planned it that way 
That's love 
He looked down and knew 
A man would need a woman's touch 
Two souls come together and make one 
That's us
And when I feel I just can't go on 
The dreams have come and gone 
I know you'll always be there 
And when that old cold truth is hard to face 
I'll carry you away 
Years from now I'll still care
In rockin' chairs we'll share old memories
Made up of part of you and part of me
That's us
As different as the night and day 
That's us 
But the good Lord had planned it that way 
That's love 
He looked down and knew 
A man would need a woman's touch 
Two souls come together and make one 
That's us
