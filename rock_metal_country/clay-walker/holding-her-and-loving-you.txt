It's the third hardest thing I'll ever do
Leaving here without you
And the second hardest thing I'll ever do
Is telling her about you
She's been good to me
When things were going rough
How can I tell her now
That good ain't good enough
The hardest thing I'll ever have to do
Is holding her and loving you
If she'd give me one good reason I'd be gone
But she ain't done one thing wrong
So don't expect me just to walk out of the door
I still love her but I love you more
She's been good to me
When things weren't going right
She made my days
Long before you made my nights
The hardest thing I'll ever have to do
Is holding her and loving you
Yeah the hardest thing I'll ever have to do
Is holding her, loving you
Girl the hardest thing I'll ever have to do
Is holding her, loving you
