The sun's reflecting off the city limit sign
I better keep moving before I change my mind
Lookin' in the rearview mirror
Comin' home didn't make it clearer
I didn't wanna hear her say goodbye
Heartache Highway why didn't I say
What she wanted to hear
Why must the most important words go unspoken
Heartache Highway now it's too late
To ever change her mind
Oh it's a hell of a road
When you're leavin' heaven behind
Memories of her dance in my headlights
As I'm ridin' my pain into the night
Headin' for the next horizon
Watchin' the full moon risin'
Gotta keep on drivin' goin' nowhere..on this
Heartache Highway why didn't I say
What she wanted to hear
Why must the most important words go unspoken
Heartache Highway now it's too late
To ever change her mind
Oh it's a hell of a road
When you're leavin' heaven behind
Oh it's a hell of a road
When you're leavin' heaven behind
