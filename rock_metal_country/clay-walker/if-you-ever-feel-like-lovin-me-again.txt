I remember when it all began
You couldn't keep your body
>From my hands
I remember nights we felt
So close
How we got so distant
I don't know
So as you plan
Your brand new life
Keep this one thing in mind
If you ever feel
Like lovin' me again
The door's wide open
Baby walk right in
I'll be waitin'
'Til the end of time
Heart and mind
Now just like back then
If you ever feel
Like needin' someone
Who will live you
Like I've always done
Girl I'll show you
Some things never end
If you ever feel
Like lovin' me again
People change
And baby so do dreams
They move along
To where the grass is green
So I won't hold you down
To what we had
Last thing I wanna do
Is make you sad
But is things don't fly your way
Girl it's never too late
If you ever feel
Like lovin' me again
The door's wide open
Baby walk right in
I'll be waitin'
'Til the end of time
Heart and mind
Now just like back then
If you ever feel
Like needin' someone
Who will live you
Like I've always done
Girl I'll show you
Some things never end
If you ever feel
Like lovin' me again
