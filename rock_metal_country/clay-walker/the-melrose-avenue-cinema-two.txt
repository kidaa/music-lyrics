The last day of school was the first of June
Me and Bobby watched the clock all afternoon
Waitin' for the bell and Mrs. Greer
To say have a good summer, see you next year
That night I couldn't sleep 'cause the very next day
They started up the summertime matinees
With a different movie every afternoon
At the Melrose Avenue Cinema Two
Me and Bobby rode rockets into outer space
We drove Daytona and we won the race
We shot a lotta bull and some bad guys too
At the Melrose Avenue Cinema Two
The Melrose Avenue Cinema Two
Well the years went by and the price went up
From a couple of quarters to a couple of bucks
Bobby and his family moved away
So I found my little girl to take his place
Me and Betty saw our share of love scenes
We even saw a couple on the movie screen
John Wayne won the lady and I did too
At the Melrose Avenue Cinema Two
The Melrose Avenue Cinema Two
Now the Melrose Avenue Cinema Two
Is a second-hand store called Nothin' New
All that's left of the old marquee
Is some broken glass and one crooked ";T";
And I watch old movies on a new TV
With Betty on the couch sittin' next to me
We still hold hands like we used to do
At the Melrose Avenue Cinema Two
The Melrose Avenue Cinema Two
The Melrose Avenue Cinema Two
Yes we do
