Tony Arata
I spent half my life on bended knee
Begging somebody to change
And the other half prayin'to God
That they never would
And all it got me was twice as lost
When it all turned out the same
But all that beggin?finally did somebody good
I used to dream all night
Of a day that was gone
But come the morning light
Forever from now on
Gonna do my dreaming with my eyes wide open
I'll do my looking back
With my eyes closed
We can do some living
Or spend our whole life hopin?
In the end we're left with
The one we chose
So I'll do my dreaming with my eyes wide open
Every time the world moved on
I fell a little further behind
From running back or following someone home
Until I learned that one step forward
Will take you further on
Than a thousand back or a million that ain't
Your own
I used to dream all night
Of a day that was gone
But come the morning light
Forever from now on
Gonna do my dreaming with my eyes wide open
I'll do my looking back
With my eyes closed
We can do some living
Or spend our whole life hopin?
In the end we're left with
The one we chose
So I'll do my dreaming with my eyes wide open
We can do some living
Or spend our whole life hopin?
In the end we're left with
The one we chose
So I'll do my dreaming with my eyes wide open
