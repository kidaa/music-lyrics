Once again he's left you here crying
It hurts me to see him hurt you this way
Once again here I am trying 
To make the tears desappear from your face
For your sake
Chorus:
Let me take that heartache off your hands
You've stood more than one heart can stand
Don't give up on love 'til you give me a chance
Let me take that heartache off your hands
These shoulders were made for you to cry on
If you need them they're yours any time
These arms are yours to try on
I'll make sure they fit you just right
They'll hold you tight
Chorus
