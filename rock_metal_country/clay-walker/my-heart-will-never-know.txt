I pour two cups of coffee
Put the paper on the table
So we can share the morning news
Your voice answers our phone when we're not home
Friends who call leave a message here for you
Every night I leave the light on, you're just working late
As far as I can see everything is still the same
And my heart will never know
So I don't fall apart
I fool myself for another day
That you're not really gone
After all this time it's still too hard to let you go
As long as I don't say goodbye
My heart will never know
It's been a long cold December, the snow outside keeps fallin'
I'll light a fire when you get home
It reminds me of the first night we make love
Like it would last forever, and nothing could go wrong
You're a part of me, a part of everything I do
So I keep holding on, hiding from the truth
And my heart will never know
So I don't fall apart
I fool myself for another day
That you're not really gone
After all this time it's still too hard to let you go
As long as I don't say goodbye
My heart will never know
After all this time it's still too hard to let you go
As long as I don't say goodbye
My heart will never know
