Oh love you know I'm so afraid to fall
'Cause remember the last time
You backed me against the wall
Oh like a fool I trusted you
I was a little too naive
But this time love
You're asking way too much of me
This time love
It would be too much to take
'Cause once I fall for her
There'll be no way to escape
She'll be the one to take my heart
And never set it free
This time love
You're asking way too much of me
Oh love I don't know how long I can wait
And any minute now just might be too late
So stop me now if it can't work out
'Cause I already see
Oh this time love
You're asking way too much of me
Oh this time love
It would be too much to take
'Cause once I fall for her
There'll be no way to escape
She'll be the one to take my heart
And never set it free
Oh this time love
You're asking way too much of me
Oh I said this time, this time love
You're asking way too much of me
