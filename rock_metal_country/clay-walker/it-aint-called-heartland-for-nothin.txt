Bryan Wayne/Justin Lantz
She could see him comin' from a mile away
Kickin' up dust down the dirt road
She ran and met him at the front gate
Hopped in the truck and said let's go
You wouldn't think there'd be much to do
So far from the city lights
But give two kids all that room
And there's no tellin' what they'd find
They felt the rhythm of the wind
Blowin' through the wheat fields
The sun wasn't all that fell
As the moon began to rise
Beneath the stars in each other's arms
They were onto somethin'
It ain't called heartland for nothin'
The thing about bein' from a town that small
Is everyone's lookin' for a way out
But that never crossed their minds at all
After twenty good years there's no doubt
The two of them saw so much more
Than corn and barbed wire fence
They found a love worth stayin' for
And they've been together ever since
They felt the rhythm of the wind
Blowin' through the wheat fields
The sun wasn't all that fell
As the moon began to rise
Beneath the stars in each other's arms
They were onto somethin'
It ain't called heartland for nothin'
Oh they felt the rhythm of the wind
Blowin' through the wheat fields
The sun wasn't all that fell
As the moon began to rise
Beneath the stars in each other's arms
They were onto somethin'
It ain't called heartland for nothin'
3We're in heartland, heartland
