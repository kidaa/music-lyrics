Chuck Jones/Chris Arms
Got a long list of things to do
It begins and ends with gettin' over you
I can't quit 'til I'm through
I get up with the sun and go down with the moon
Pain and tears
Can't be all there is
Is it any wonder I'm feeling six feet under
Baby you're nothing but too much trouble
Gotta bury this love and bury the shovel
Gonna dig me a hole and make it deep
Gonna lay down what's left of us
And then put this thing to sleep
Let my soul rest in peace
Gotta nail down the lid
On these stone cold memories
'Cause
Pain and tears
Can't be all there is
Is it any wonder I'm feeling six feet under
Baby you're nothing but too much trouble
Gotta bury this love and bury the shovel
I'm gonna hold on tight to what I've got
And not worry 'bout what I've missed
Someday I'm gonna leave this world
Knowing that I've been blessed
Even if it never gets been than this
Pain and tears
Can't be all there is
Is it any wonder I'm feeling six feet under
Baby you're nothing but too much trouble
Gotta bury this love and bury the shovel
