Yeah here she comes
Two hours late
But that girl's always
Worth the wait
And I love it
She's got a tie-dyed shirt on
Wrong side out
But she makes left of center
Seem right somehow
And I love it
She's got a way
Of being nonchalant
Kind quirky
Everything I'm not
She's so unordinary
So unpredictable it's scary
I think I got more than
What I bragained for
But I keep coming back
For more of it
'Cause I love it
She's got her two tattoos
One on her back
And I ain't saying
Where the other one's at
Ooh I love it
She don't own a dress
But she's a beauty queen
Taking glamour shots
In cut-off jeans
And I love it
But if there's one thing
That I love the most
It's how she does exactly
What I think she won't
She's so unordinary
So unpredictable it's scary
I think I got more than
What I bragained for
But I keep coming back
For more of it
'Cause I love it
That girl's so unordinary
So unpredictable it's scary
I think I got more than
What I bragained for
But I keep coming back
For more of it
'Cause I love it
