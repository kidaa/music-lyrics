Winds are fake but you're over there
Didn't sit here long inside my stare
In those pale blue skies you spy the errors
Strange to see how your vision narrows

An unspoken claim
In your ears it rings
You know where it's at now

Maybe a time for one inspection
You took off in the wrong direction
And nobody wants to hear
Like so many did when the days were clearAn unspoken pain
In your ears it rings
You know where it's at now
Something died when you said goodbye, yeah

Hardly time for one last look
Giving up on what we took
It's no good unless we stand
Face to face alone my friend

An unspoken thing
In your ears it rings
You know where it's at now
You know where it's at now
Something died when you said goodbye
