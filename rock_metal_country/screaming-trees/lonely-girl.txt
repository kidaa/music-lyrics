Alone in a room with shadows staring at the wall
Gotta shade my eyes for a moment try and understand it all
Disappear I'm just a ghost left over from another day
Lost in thoughts with a lonely girl
Never find out another way

Where are you
Lonely girl
Where are you
Not in my world

Every day in total darkness, every day is hell
Every day is black as night, no one left to tell
Disappear I'm just a ghost left over from another day
Lost in thoughts of a lonely girl
She went out another way

Where are you lonely girl
Where are you
Not in my world
Left me lonely
