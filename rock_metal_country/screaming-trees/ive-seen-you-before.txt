Tears are falling one by one
I stop awhile and come undone
Holding onto a world that changed
A backwards glance at what remains

I have seen you before
When your eyes had turned to black and left me waiting here

Water drips inside my head
It won't stop until I'm dead
All at once I've come undone
So I'll fall into the sun

I have seen you before
When your eyes had turned to black and left me waiting here
Waiting here

Yes I've seen you before
When your eyes had turned to black and left me waiting here
Left me waiting here
