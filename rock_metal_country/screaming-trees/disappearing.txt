Don't you try to find me any more, I want to stay
Outside of your world
This time you've thrown it all away
That was one mistake
I never thought you'd make
Once you walk the path that has no end

Close the door and think awhile
When You are all alone
Staring into nothingness
Your eyes have turned to atone
Return, to yesterday
There is no easy way
Once you walked away, but now you standFaded out of memories
And moments that you took
Locked away inside a box
I never thought you would
Follow it down and back
Disappearing in you own tracks
Don't you think you've had enough of that?
