Sleep awaits somewhere distant that I miss
Nights fade but there's one I won't forget
Light another cigarette and just wait
And wish for something to take me far away

Flames well up deep inside
Change has come and you can't hide in the ashes, no

One touch leaves a mark upon the hand
Alone with thoughts I can't understand
Roaming down the sidewalk I'm in hell
Words come rushing back just as clear as a bellFlames well up deep inside
Change has come and you can't hide in the ashes, no

Grimace softly but gently on my face
Hope sleep comes fast, there's a world to erase

Flames well up deep inside
Change has come and you can't hide in the ashes, no
You can't hide in the ashes, no
Don't you hide in the ashes
Don't you hide in the ashes
Don't you hide in the ashes, no
