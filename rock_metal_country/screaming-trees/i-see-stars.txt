The scene looks very empty
Held in front of what might be
The books they all want to tempt me
And try to set me free

And now I'm on the other side
Looking back at me
The voices gnarl against us all
Telling what must be

And I see stars in the morning
Not knowing if I'm dead
I see stars with my eyes closed
Remember everything you said

Ten years after I have read
These words were still all in my head
I'm alive but you are dead
The words she used and what she said

Now I'm on the other side
I can't tell if she's right
Voices call against us all
Living out my lifeI see stars in the morning
Not knowing if I'm dead
I see stars are my eyes closed
Remember everything you said

After midnight broken gate
It closed upon my soul
Your frozen image standing there
Warning me not to go
Into the cold

When I always start to fall
It all looks very clean
All along has she been gone
Or will she haunt my dreams
Now I'm on the other side
Looking at that dream
Then she waits to seal my fate
The stars above shining

And I see stars in the morning
Not knowing if I'm dead
I see stars are my eyes closed
Remember everything you said
