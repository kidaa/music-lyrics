Well call the doctor quick baby
I think I'm going insane
I get the feeling that maybe
I'll be dying today
Pictures in my mind
Seem so hard to find

Just so glad that you found me
Lying here on the floor
Tried but I couldn't make it
All the way to the door
Pictures in my mind
Seem so hard to findWoke up feeling real funny
Yes I'm feeling real strange
Went from light into the darkness
Guess it's time for a change

Pictures in my mind
Seem so hard to find
Seem so hard to find
