Deep into my tears
Hold me under drowning in despair
So many years
The only place to hide
Where she could fly
Never in the sky

And I would not hesitate
To tell the story of her fate
In a storm was she dead
Or disappeared
Or did she fly
Never said goodbye goodbye

The leaves have turned to gold
All the trees have fallen to the ground
I can't explain
But I think she diedGoodbye

Goodbye
