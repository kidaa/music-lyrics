When the daylight shines
I'm gonna see your face

Whoa yeah
Can we go back to the moments that we held before
Now I'm movin' inside to the place beyond the door
You said son it seems its time you wait
Trip into the hazy shadow crawlin' down his face

Now you can do it, don't let it slip right through
Don't let the maddest peak pick a part of you
Walk away in the dark
Too much prayin'
Too strange to sleep
Come down to my house baby
There's things you wont believe

Black sun morning
Coming up to greet the dawn
Black sun morning
Coming up to greet us all
To greet us allOh should I go or stay if I hear lies
I feel them burnin' me in the back of my eyes
And I see it all the time
Visions scarin' me inside
Half a simple day and night
Should I stay or should I hide

chorus

I can see in her eyes
Lyin' above her
Shout it out if I'm left out
Call it now
I feel it slippin'
Through my fingers
I feel it slippin' away, away, away

chorus
