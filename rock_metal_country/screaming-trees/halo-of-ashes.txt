She wears a halo of ashes
Specter on the wind
Waits on me so patiently
I no longer can pretend

Sky lies a thousand mile below
Stars shine and the moon is clear
With nothing I can only warn
Won't you be left near here

I been a long long time away
With one foot in the grave
Glorified in the dying of the sun

My angel pulls me closer
As my poison she crawls thru
Walks with me so silently
I no longer can refuseTomorrow my thousand miles behind
Star shine and the moon below
Wake me where you find me
Pretend you don't know

I been a long long time away...repeat

She wears a halo of ashes
Specter on the wind
Waits on me so patiently
I no longer can pretend

Tomorrow my thousand miles behind
Face painted in the moon below
Wake me where you find me
Pretend you don't know
I been a long long time away...repeat 2x's
