Count the miles before they pass you by
Shadow of the sun has crossed the sky
Fill your head with everything you find

Beyond this horizon
Beyond this horizon
Beyond this horizon

Somewhere in the valley where you lie
Pray for those whose sun will never rise
Ghosts are laughing everywhere you land
Take another step and then you canBeyond this horizon
Beyond this horizon
Beyond this horizon

Count the miles before they pass you by
Shadow of the sun has crossed the sky
Fill your head with everything you find

Beyond this horizon
Beyond this horizon
Beyond this horizon
