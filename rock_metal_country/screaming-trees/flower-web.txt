Stare into the empty space here in front of us
Storms crowd your daydream scene what will you find
We're not alone when it's the two of us
Sleep comes to haunt the hours passed behind
When you put your head into the flower web
When you put your head into the flower web

And the world will change into a fog of butterflies
Within our reach and in our sky
Sorry that we couldn't find the time to cry
When you put your head into the flower web
You put your head into the flower web
Right now

Inside the empty space here in front of us
Storms crowd your daydream scene what will you find
We're not alone when it's the two of us
Sleep comes to haunt the hours passed behind
When you put your head into the flower web
When you put your head into the flower web

And the world will change into a dark and withered night
Around our head and in our sky, sky, sky
Sorry that we couldn't find the time to cry
When you put your head into the flower web
When you put your head into the flower web
When you put your head into the flower web
When you put your head into the flower web
