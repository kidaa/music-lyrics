Walking down a different kind of plain
Are you really in this
Not at all, said I'd never go
Why don't you close your eyes now
The yellow moon could never reach the corner
The looking glass cracked

Stumble past the doors and leap beyond
Beyond the mirror
Behind my back now you will disappear

Do you feel
Can you reach my hand
Or do you just believe there's
Nothing wrong I ask but always wanted
Turn your mind offStumble past the doors and leap beyond
Beyond the mirror
Never really goin' anywhere but here
Behind my back now you will disappear

Walking down a different kind of plain
Are you really in this
Not at all, said I'd never go
Why don't you close your eyes
Then the yellow moon could never reach the corner
A looking glass cracked

Stumble past the doors and leap beyond
Beyond the mirror
Never really goin' anywhere but here
The yellow moon is rising
It's getting clear
Behind my back now you will disappear
