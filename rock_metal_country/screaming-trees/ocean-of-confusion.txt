On a day so long ago, now no one can remember
There's a change this too will pass
And vanish in the haze
This is moving too far
Under the skin of your sight
Ocean of confusion took me back to the
End of the night

Transparent dreams fade in my head
In my eyes, I'm looking back for one last time

Now day has broken
Shattered in the wind
Lies, still unspoken
Nothing left to sendSliding by a picture handing, folded in your hand
Ride it out in the hopelessness now you'll understand
This is moving too far under the skin of your sight
Ocean of confusion took me back to the end of the night

Transparent dreams fade in my head
In my eyes, I'm looking back for one last time
