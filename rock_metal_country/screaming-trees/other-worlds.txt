Action in the ways I see today
Hold me back into the world where I can stay
Go away so I can see you in my eye
The world is a panic lost in time

Chorus

Other worlds for us to find
Leaving all these things behind
Sun is fire in the sky
Burns a hole into our lives

I look into the eyes of my disguise
There you are waiting for my cries
Hide in darkness staying out of sight
Flashing feelings cloud the nightChorus

Knowing when I'm going to fall
I try so hard to do it all
Flames surround this dream I'm in
Suddenly it never ends

Chorus
