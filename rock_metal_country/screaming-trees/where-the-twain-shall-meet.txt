All right now
Push against the wooden table
A sliver cut no trace of pain
I lose its image as it blurs away
I feel the rope as it slowly frays

Chorus
You never know where the twain shall meet
You never know which one stays
Keep aware of the trap that snares
And which one stays

Statue people move like dripping water
It's a nail into the cracking ice
You sleep with thoughts of a coming day
I drag behind on a frozen chain

repeat chorus
Which one staysSo I'm down but I don't know what way I'm going
So very long and it doesn't matter where this has gone

Slide a coin into the magic light machine
Watch a story that is never free
It takes a toll and it melds you wise
Keeps you alone nearly all the time

You never know where the twain shall meet
You never know which one stays
Keep aware of the trap that snares
You're never gonna know which one stays
Which one stays
Which one stays
