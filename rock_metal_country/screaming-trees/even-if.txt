Come walk down the long hall
In the dim light of morning
Step inside my room, I'm waiting alone
It's so weird that you're finally here
In the place where you're going to see
All the sights and the sounds

And then the animals come out of the jungle
Curious to see us waiting here
On the shore of the crystal blue sea
And the waves meet the ship
That we're going to be on
On a flight from this day
To the place where we can stay
And never ever be alone
I know that I'm never going to go back home

I stand at the window, the dim light is fading
It's cold inside my room and it's getting late
Then the animals come out of the jungle
Curious to see me stare at the waves
As they roll out to sea and the waves meet the ship
That we're going to be on

On a flight from this day
To a place where we can stay
And never ever be alone
You know that I'm never going to go
You know that I'm never going to go back home againWell alright now!

Come walk down the long hall
In the dim light of morning
Step inside my room, I'm waiting alone
It's so weird that you're finally here
In the place where you're going to see
All the sights and the sounds

And then the animals come out of the jungle
Curious to see us waiting here
On the shore of the crystal blue sea
And the waves meet the ship
That we're going to be on
On a flight from this day
To the place where we can stay
And never ever be alone
You know that I'm never going to go
You know that I'm never going to go back home again
That's good
