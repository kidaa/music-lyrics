Take a minute just to breathe
Take a minute 'till I'm wide awake
And I'm searching' once again
And the sun has left the sky

And you're on my mind
And you're on my mind

Take a second to believe
Just a second you won't have to wait
Don't ya turn your back on me
I couldn't look into your eyes

And I don't know why
And I don't know why

But I'll try again on another day

You make my mind
Just wanna leave this world behind
You make my mind 2x's

Let the silence creep in
Let the silence creep in
In the silence I'm awake all night
Just searching' once again
Searching' once again
Well could i reach you in the morning lightIf I closed my eyes
If I closed my eyes

Well you're here right away

You make my mind...2x's

You're on my mind
I'll try again on another day

And I don't know why 2x's
If I close my eyes 2x's
Well you're here right away

You make my mind
