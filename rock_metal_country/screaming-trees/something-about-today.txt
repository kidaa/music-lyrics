Gone so long and feeling so let down
Seems as though I'm living underground
Something about today
I can't explain

Walked on burning bridges so I said
I think I'll take another way instead
Something about today I can't explain
Something about today
I can't explain

War from sea to oily sea
Waves have washed home their disease
All the miles couldn't make it change
I might know tomorrow but not todayChased by shaded night mares till I'm dead
Following most everywhere I tread
Something about today
I can't explain

Something about today
