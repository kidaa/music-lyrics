I'm burning baby, catch on fire with me
There's a ghost in my head
And he's chasing me through my dreams
I want to take a train today
I'd take it straight to any place

I keep on riding, keep on rolling away
Woah yeah

I'm burning baby, got no place to go
It's just a crawl through the weeks
To destination unknown

And doesn't it seem strange
Some things never change
Some things never change
Woah yeahGet burned away, yeah
I get burned away

I'm burning baby, catch on fire with me
There's some ghosts in my head
And they're chasing me through my dreams
Yeah, I want to take a train today
I'd take it straight to any place
I keep on riding, keep on rolling away
I get burned away

Yeah, I'm leaving town
In the midnight rain
I been burned away
