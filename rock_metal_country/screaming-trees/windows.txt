Yeah, oh
You count every word I say
Over again you might find a way
Seven verses to magnify
Drop the feathers you will never fly

Tapestries of black and gold they're crying
Looking through the windows I am watching you
You as you go by

Turn on a wave of fire
Your pale skin cant turn any whiter
Grab a wheel sing a bitter tune
Never stops to forget you've seen

repeat chorusWalk along a lonely mile
Saw a bird falling at my feet
Crawling like a wounded child
Moving farther out of reach
Don't wanna be alone, no
Come on, come on, come on

You count every word I say
Over again you could find a way
Seven verses to magnify
Drop the feathers you will never fly

repeat chorus
