Time speaks with golden words
You watch them burn
When there's nothing to be heard
Hides behind the stars
Silver in the night
She can't be right
Lies in the coming light
She speaks with diamonds in their eyes
She won't

Time living with today
Who is to say
In a lonely way
She whispers never a surprise
She won't tell you whyTime speaks her golden tongue
Nowhere to run
And when everything is done
She lies to no one
Never found her here
Her words so clear
She lives within us here
She speaks with diamonds in their eyes
She won't tell you why
