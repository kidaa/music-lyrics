If you see my birds flying
On your way past people crying
Give them all a wave and tell them
That I'm going to save some time for them

If you pass me in the square
Just pretend that I'm not there
Just reach over into my pocket
Take the paper and written on it's what to do
It's up to you
Ah, ah, ah
Transfiguration
Hey hey

If you think I'm taking too long
Just imagine that I'm gone
Everybody wants to sleep but
Sleep is something they must keep from getting into
You know
And I know

Playing cards who can't pretend
But only you would remember when
Close our eyes and see each other
One last time and you know my mother said it's true
That it's up to you
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Transfiguration
Hey hey

Ten thousand different things to be
It's impossible that's all
If you decide which one you want
They'll help you if you fall
Transfiguration
Hey hey

If you see me trying to swim backwards up the stream
Remember I'm the only one who only had that dream
If you jump into the water and try to swim but then you sink
Try not to look behind yourself, just have yourself a drink
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Transfiguration
Hey hey, hey hey...
