Stand against barriers
Through cruel hallways
Up against barriers
In every day
Give me another shot
Come and let me hear you talk
Glassy eyes I look like chalk
Call a word and hear it mocked
The hands of the clock

Night is a barrier
In dark hallways
Lights in the barriers
In every way
Show me fantastic lands
Come pick through little sands
Just what is out of my hands
Like the world I just go around, manTest the barrier
Daylight ever come
Up against the barrier
So I take some
Time to throw my life away
Feel it slipping every day
All they see is down in pain
Give it to me let it reign
Through the dark window pane
Up against the barrier

The daylight ever come
Up against the barrier
So I take some more man gonna take some more man
Up against the barrier
So I take some more man gonna take some more
