It's a broken morning outside
Go easy on my mind
cos you're this dream I'm hanging' on
And I'm trying' to meet the dawn

And the longest way I traveled
From the darkness to the light
Lord it's been a million miles
In these prisons I can't abide

I'm half way here, I'm half way there repeat
All along i've been the traveler, yeah

Forever outta time
Forever just unwinds
I see the green beyond the blue
And I'm trying' to make it thruAnd the longest way I traveled
From the darkness to the light
Lord it seems a million miles
All my brothers
I can't unbind

I'm half way here, I'm half way there repeat
Oh Lord I been the traveler, yeah

It's why the world is cold
Go easy on my soul
cos you're this dream I'm hanging on same as first

I'm half way here, I'm half way there repeat 2x's
All along I been the traveler, yeah
