Smoke rings drift in the wind
Looks like they're never coming back again
A sideways street till we reach the end
Wishing all the while that I'd never been here

Feeling like the leaves and I blow about fast
Making me think nothing ever lasts
Reflection mirrored in a shade of grey
Now I don't remember why I ever stayed

Dark clouds are moving in
Dogs howl out in the wind
Smoke rings drift over me
Smoke rings are dreams

Ice cold kiss on a cold steel rail
Like all of the sights that I've watched fail
You told me that you never want to change your place
Just another story that you can't eraseDark clouds are moving in
Dogs howl out in the wind
Smoke rings drift over me
Smoke rings are dreams

Smoke rings drift in the wind
Looks like they're never coming back again
A sideways street and the fog sets in
Wishing all the while that you'd never been, yeah

Dark clouds are moving in
Dogs howl out in the wind
Smoke rings drift over me
Smoke rings are dreams
