Fade into the picture and you're always there
Long liquid fingers and a bloodshot stare
Screaming like the way I hear an angel sing
Call you once and fall away from everything

Oh, I know we've already gone
In the direction of the sun
In the direction of the sun

I hid behind the curtain where the serpent went
Watching many moons go by around your head
Close enough to feel that I'm cold inside
I've seen you shake and now I know whyOh, I know it's already gone
In the direction of the sun
In the direction of the sun

Fade into the picture and you're always there
Long liquid fingers and a bloodshot stare
Screaming like the way I hear an angel sing
Call you once and fall away from everything

Oh, I know I've already gone
In the direction of the sun
