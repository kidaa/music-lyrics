It's taken everything
Everything I got and it's hung me on the line
Water rising up over me
And I think I'm gonna die
Think I'm gonna die

I told a lie
That's what I said
I told the one you know I'll always keep
Whose God is mine 3x's
Whose God is
The one with the witness

Shine your lonely light on me
I'll be there to hold the mirror
I can take you down with me
Show you lonely, lonely, lonelyDeath wastes no time it seems
And it's hung me on the line
Hung me on the line
Hard rain falling all over me
And I think I'm gonna die
Think I'm gonna die

I told a lie
That's what I said
I told the one you know I'll always keep
Whose God is mine 3x's
Whose God is
The one with the witness
Shine.......
