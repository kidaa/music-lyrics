Born to work under the way your velvet lies
Smoke unfolding hazy in the sky
Arise

I've been where you never been
I've seen what you've never seen
I've dreamed what you've never dreamed
I've left what you'd never leave
But now I can only find one way
Take me higher

Rays of shattered light to bleed my eyes
The spark has burned away until I'm blind
InsideI've seen what you've never seen
I've been where you never been
I've dreamed what you've never dreamed
I've left what you'd never leave
But now I can only find one way
Take me higher

There's only your reflection left to hide
Once you know the aim I call you is
Still mine

I've seen what you've never seen
I've been where you never been
I've left what you'd never leave
I've dreamed what you've never dreamed
But now I can... repeat 2x's
Take me higher 3x's
