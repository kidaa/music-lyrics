You try to think but you find your head full
Time slips into the hands of the wrong people
I know you know
Crashing, howling something's coming at you
You know I know
Turns to go when you don't want it to, yeah

She turns her head and never tells you who
I'm moving fast so I'm unveiling
The many ways that I am failing to see
I can see you
Feeling like two people I can't be
You can see too
So many things that got away from you, yeah
Turns to go when you don't want it toTry to speak with so many voices
They cloud the space with so many noises
I know you know
Other different days on different planets, yeah
Turns to go when you don't want it to, yeah
The girl with silver eyes is calling you
So look into the sun it's shining blue
