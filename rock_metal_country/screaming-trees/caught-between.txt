When you walked into the room
I'd never seen your face, I'm here
On the ground with all the crawls
Into your head before the dawn

Now I'm caught between
And tired of all this pain
Hold you under but the shadows
Still remain
Time has taken me, down
Time has taken me, down
Time has taken me, down

When you walked into the room
I'd never seen your face before
Close my eyes to see the sky
Won't follow you there anymore
