Subtle poison slips through my veins
A dark cloud inside of me
It hovers slow till you finally know
I'm waiting just to set it free

Whoa the walls are closing in right on you
What are you gonna do now
The walls are closing in right on you
What did you think I would do now
Hey, come on

What I wanted still evades me
A black fog behind me
I think it will be over my shoulder
Pushin' me so very nearNow the walls are closing in right on you
What are you gonna do now
The walls are closing in right on you
What did you think I would do now
Hey, they're closing in right on you, yeah

Subtle poison slips through my veins
A dark cloud inside of me
It hovers slow til you finally know
I'm waiting just to set it free

Well the walls are closing in right on you
What are you gonna do now
The walls are closing in right on you
What did you think I would do now
