Yeah I can see for miles and the time is empty
I bounce on a wire just try and stop me
A million things I could think of today
Cause my mind is racing, I wanna stay
And get lost in your eyes
But can you swim when you cry, hey

I'm walking down a spiral staircase
Never gonna ever be able to place
The kind of things I see and hear
A room that's washed in burnin' tears
Well I walk that on by
I can't rest well when you cry, heyToday my world has been painted light
Where's the snow that's painted white
A million things I could think of today
Cause my mind is racing and I just wanna stay
And get lost in your eyes
Slap me don't even try
Tomorrow's gonna pass on by
But can you swim when you cry
