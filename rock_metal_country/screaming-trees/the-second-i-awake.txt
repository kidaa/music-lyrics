Well your eyes are out of my soul, cold and tired
Open like a door to a winter's night
Silver sky becomes a background that begins to grey
Won't find me falling the second I awake

I thought I was going backwards
Walking down the lane
Found a foggy street
Now I'm not the same
Through a maze of walls and fences 
Nothing can be heard
Where a million images are spun to just one

My memories are twisted here as I stand
They hold no meaning for me now without a sound
I can hear the bells are ringing calmly in my ears
Cross the fields that stretch forever
It won't disappear
