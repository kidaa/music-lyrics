Histories are held within your heart
So let it go
Open all the doors around your eyes
And let us know
Certain keys are held within your hand
So let it show

Bring us closer to the flame
Bring us closer to the fire
Where's the spark within your eye
Where's the spark

Thunder in your ears
Until you can't hear this at all
Rivers flowing tears
Until your destinies dissolve
Drifting through the years
Until a voice receives your callBring us closer to the fire
Bring us closer to the flame
The end and beginning are the same
It's all the same

Mysteries are kept within your heart
So let it show
Open all the doors around your eyes
And let us know
Certain keys were held until they must have let you go

Bring us closer to the flame
Bring us closer to the fire
This world can't take us any higher
