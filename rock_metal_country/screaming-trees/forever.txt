Come on now I'm waiting
No one is walking by my side
I believe that if I get off track
You've got something that can bring me back
I go to you now and in a way you're very different somehow

Come on come on let's go inside
Come on come on go back to find
Come on back she's asking why
Go out into my side forever
Forever
There's only you forever
Forever, to the end now
There's only you
There's only you

Come with me to the place that's real
Look below you into the fields of green
The sound of my soul to capture you and let you go
Come on come on let's go inside
Come on come on go back to find
Thing about you that you hide
Run out into my side forever
Only you forever
Forever to the end now
There's only you
There's only you

Come on up to the higher ground
Even if you're falling down
Surround you with the moonlight
Now here's the door into the night

Come on come on let's go inside
Come on come on go back to find
Thing about you that you hide
Turn around into my side forever
It's only you forever
Forever to the end now
It's only you
It's only you forever repeat
We will see forever

I feel like a jerk...
