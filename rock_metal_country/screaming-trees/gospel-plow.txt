If you wanna get to heaven let me tell you how
Keep your hand on the gospel plow
Hold on 3x's
Mary had a golden chain
Every link spelled Jesus' name
Hold on 3x's
Mary had a golden chain
Hold on
If you wanna get to heaven let me tell you how
Keep your hand on the gospel plow

Waking up without you now I'm on my own
Coming down the sky burns into my soul
And I wanna know that you're mine
I gotta know you're mine

Come on back tomorrow said you'll be all right
I'll never find the way now to kill the timeAnd I wanna know what's in your mind
I gotta know you're mine

And I fell alone
And my dreams are torn

You're not at all
Not at all
Not at all
Who you say you are
Gotta know
Gotta know
Gotta know where
You're going
Waking up without you girl... same as beginning
And I fell alone... same
