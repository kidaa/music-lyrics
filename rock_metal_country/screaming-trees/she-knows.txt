She senses the presence of the smallest motion
Wasted like a sad devotion
Turns her glance at where I stand
She knows that the time is this
A sweet invader that could never miss
She knows, she knows

Waves of doubt cascading clearly [ah, she knows]
They make believe that I'm no good [ah, she knows]
And her eyes won't find me here
She knows that the time is this
A sweet invader that could never miss
She knows, she knowsDon't hesitate, it's my fate
To freeze my mind, so messed up
See her eye in the sky
Burn one more into my mind
Today she's gone away
To leave me hung up in her wake
Yeah...

She senses the presence of the smallest notion
Wasted like a sad devotion
Turns to glance at where I stand
She knows the time is this
A sweet invader that could never miss
She knows...
