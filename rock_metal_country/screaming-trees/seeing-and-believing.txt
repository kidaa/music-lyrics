Moving slowly in the morning light
Waiting for you to come along
Understand it's time for a change
Now I know I've got nothing to say
Looking through me like there's no one there
Journey to the great nowhere

If you are seeing what you're believing it's nothing new
Don't say you're seeing what you're believing
I've been there too, yeah

Today you bring yourself around
Only walking in the shade
Say I should change before it's too late

Now I know I've got nothing to say
Looking through me like there's no one there
Send me to the great nowhere

If you are seeing what you're believing it's nothing new
Don't say you're seeing what you're believing
I've been there too, yeah

Moving slowly through the morning light
I waited for you to come along
Too bad that it's too late
You should know I've got nothing to say
I'll be alone and I don't care
Journey to the great nowhere

If you are seeing what you're believing it's nothing new
Don't say you're seeing what you're believing
'Cause I know too
