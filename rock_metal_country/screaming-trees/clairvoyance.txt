Clairvoyance Repeated
Wild into the dead of night
Around the corner I see a light
See it coming my way run
Standing on the ground waiting for the sign

Whoa I can't go on I can't sleep
I can't last more than another week
'Cause I know what's coming then

Forgive my lies, I see it's too much
Doing all I can not to see your plan
I know it's no good
No good to keep you waitingWhoa I can't go on I can't sleep
I can't last more than another week
'Cause I know what's coming then
'Cause of my clairvoyance

Daylight isn't here
But it's a part of us
I see it coming my way run
Standing on the grass waiting for the sun

Whoa I can't go on I can't sleep
I can't last more than another week
'Cause I know what's coming then repeat
'Cause of my clairvoyance
