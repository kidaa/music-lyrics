Talk to me now with your ruby blues
You wanna give me something give you something too
I've led an angel to the edge of the night
A long day's journey into black

Flashes of you sounds of shadow coming through
Flashes of you whisper you're right

Phases of praises you can choose
The ride of your life baby you can't lose
Draped in a puzzle with black and white light
A second echoes in your sightFlashes of you sounds are shattered coming through
Flashes of you whisper you're right

Talk to me now with your ruby blues
You wanna give me something that you can choose
I've led an angel to the edge of night
A long day's journey into black

Flashes of you sounds are shattered coming through
Flashes of you whisper you're right
Flashes....
