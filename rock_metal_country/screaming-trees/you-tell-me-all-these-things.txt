Well you're the only key
The one that's deep inside of me
Late at night in the pale of fright I wake up only to turn on the light
You tell me all these things in the desperate creeping night
You tell me all these things while the darkness hides the light

Seventeen colors on the back of the wall
I run out the door and into the hall
You know I've never seen your face before
But there you are when you open the door
You tell me all these things in the desperate creeping night
You tell me all these things while the darkness hides the light

Gonna turn the only key
Now that's the one thing that I need
Late at night looking at the sky
And I see the things you say I'm not
You tell me all these things in the desperate creeping night
You tell me all these things while the darkness hides the light

You tell me all these things
You tell me all these things
