Windshield frames a picture of the night
Cold driving, desert highway line
Road keeps twisting slow so I know
Recognise the diamonds flashing by

Nothing I fear could touch me here
Oh Lord, it won't change

I've seen the way they turn the talk around
And all the children going down
You've got to move along until your gone
You've got to leave this ugly townBut the words they said don't leave my head
Oh Lord, it won't change
Oh Lord, it won't change
It won't change...

I never thought the night would find me here
Black raindrops washed away with drunken tears
I live another lie in every mile
One wasted day, one million wasted years

Better keep on going
It's the only thing I know
Oh Lord, it won't change
Oh Lord, it won't change
It won't change
