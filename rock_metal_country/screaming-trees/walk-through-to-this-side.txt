Walk through to this side
I'm sinking in the pale light
Drawing breath in from thin air
When I think about the place I've been

Walk through to this side
Walk through to this side

You stand on a tightrope
You take away and no one knows
The evening sun is dripping fire
And tears are burning into your side

Walk through to this side
Walk through to this side
Walk through to this sideYeah, music's coming down
No one is around
Got the doors open wide
Come on inside

Walk through to this side
Been waiting such a long time
I've gone travelling everywhere
I turn around but you're not there

Walk through to this side
