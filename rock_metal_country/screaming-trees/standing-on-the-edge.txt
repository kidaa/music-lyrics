Standing by myself on the sidewalk
Nothing in this world could make me talk
I'm nailed to this floor where there is no air
Alone I see myself and stare
Locked inside this world you gave me
It's lonely here through the smoke I can't see clear

And I know all the ways and I'll try
And I've seen all the places I get eyed
If I bear myself in the yard
Would the end of the day always seem so hard

Wait for the world to turn around
Then I won't go up or down
Gentle winds must sometimes sit
The face that looks on in my mirror

And I know all the ways and I can try
And I've seen all the places where I hide
If I bear myself out in the yard
Would the end of the day always be so hardStanding on the edge of the wall
Sometimes I get too close and I fall, yeah

And I know all the ways and I can try
And I've seen all the places where I hide
If I bear myself in the yard
Would the end of the day always be so hard

Well all the nights last a thousand years
When you're in a time that feels so near
I'll just say you were the word I found
And then I won't go up or down
And I know all the ways and I can try
And I've seen all the places where I hide
If I bear myself in the yard
Would the end of the day always be so hard
Standing on the edge of the wall
Sometimes I look down and I fall, yeah

Just standing on the edge of the wall
I always go to far and I fall, yeah
