Well clouds divide and I see a shape
Pretty girl through the mind gape
Running back fast away
Past the shadows where I stay
Long, long hair
Knock, not there
Wind dissolves the clouds
But the street light you're the only witness

The girl behind the mask
She's the one
Who never has to ask, yeah

With magic pouring from her eyes
There's nothing she can't recognize
Makes me want to understand
Makes me feel like melting black
When you're the last flash
When time stands still I ask
Where to fall and I could be calling
Never been in a dream where she could seeThe girl behind the mask
She's the one
Who never has to ask
She reads through your disguise
It's too late
You never realize
And I never realized

Up the stairs her picture's waiting
In the room she might be waiting
We're baptized still getting blinded in the darkness
If I get back to her I'd walk away into the forest
And into the thicket, where can I go Lord

The girl behind the mask
She's the one
Who never has to ask
She reads through your disguise
It's too late
You never realize
You never realize
Then you cry please don't...
