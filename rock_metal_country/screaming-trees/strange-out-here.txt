Were you around
Spring came today
Outside your room
You were away
All the lost hours spent in the cold
I didn't care
I dreamed you were there
Now I'm counting my chances gone 1 2 3
If you see me today would you remember me
Say you are free why don't you really live
You gotta hate forever never can forgive
And it's clear
I learned to trust the rain
I'm drifting out of reach
It's kind of strange out here

In this city built on broken glass
And the carcasses of a million dead sheep
Where the blood runs thick down third street
Down the gutter to the railroad station
And takes a train
Up, over these big mountains to the sea
That's where you gotta be
You gotta go to the seaYesterday I'm so glad to forget
I was so sane all life remains
But think of the time you learned to love
The rain in the park we walked in the dark
Now I'm counting my chances gone 1 2 3
If you saw me today would you remember me
Been raining forever, go ahead and leave
But you gotta hate forever, you never can forgive

So clear
I can't distrust the rain
I'm drifting out of reach
It's very strange out here
