Where do you stand when it's all over
Washed from the earth
And down to the sea
Do you lie in a bed of roses

Are you still aware
I guess that you don't care about it now

I see your shadow knocking at my door
All plastic face and shaking hands
Now how much space could ever hold your here

Are you still aware
I guess that you don't care about it nowWhere do you stand when it's all over
Washed from the earth
And down to the sea
Do you lie in a bed of roses

Are you still aware
I guess that you don't care about it now

Are you still aware
I guess that you don't care about it now
