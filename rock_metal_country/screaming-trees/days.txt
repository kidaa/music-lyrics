Do you remember old dead eyes in the sun
Days last forever through somewhere we run
Doesn't look so bad with a voice beyond your head
With some experience we'll go
Anything here that you see is in the wrong reality
Days within a glass cube

An uncertain path to bring me up to your door
Cracks in your walls greet me just like before
The cycle smiles on your face and in your hair
A different room we're in some other
Anything here that you see is in the wrong reality
Days within a glass cube
Days within a glass cube
Days within a glass cube

All the walls are crystal glass
You never find the time to ask
You gotta lose your way to find it
You don't think you can but you willThis will be all right for today
It's all right for today repeat

We're all round the table and I will slip behind
Broken hearted daydreams in back of all our minds
Welcome to reality it's not a realization
It's everlasting but I would go through
Anything here that you see is in the wrong reality
Days within a glass cube repeat 2x

You gotta lose your way to find it
You'll think you can't but you will
You will
You will
