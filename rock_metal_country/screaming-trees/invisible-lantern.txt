Locked in this darkened room, a timeless view
Shall I not ponder everything inside
Can't escape my mind
I just let the shadow rot through my soul

But I got illumination on the street
Just a flash of confusion when we meet
My invisible lantern, it's my invisible lantern

Anxious echoes seal the door
Shoes on the floor kicking in my eye
To all my friends I'm crazy and I'm shut away
The don't care about anything I saySo I took my illumination into the street
Just a flash of confusion when we meet
My invisible lantern, it's my invisible lantern

The heavy warm lights shade me from the thoughts
That try to creep in my c-c-c-consciousness 
Transparent wheels always make me feel
Like I've never been in the right dimension
The girl I've been seeking through all these dreams
Dissolves with a touch 'cause nothing's left to see
I imagine myself outside with you
And there everyone's whispering only what's true

That I got illumination on the street
Just a flash of confusion when we meet
My invisible lantern, it's my invisible lantern
My invisible lantern, my invisible lantern
