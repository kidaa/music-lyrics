Day breaks and I don't care
The kiss of light upon the stairs
Is coming to the doorway
But there's nothing out there

Time's stopped within my mind
Same as all the rest behind
Everything has changed while I was sleeping
One day you'll find she's of another mind
And it won't be long until the night comes creeping

Loud voices fill the sky
Strange faces in her eyes
And I'm a stranger now but I just don't know it
The circle closes up too slow
Shining in translucent glow
It's darker now 'cause that's the way she sees it

One day you'll find she's of another mind
And it won't be long until the night comes creepingNext train to outer space
But of her love there is no trace
The world just turns to silver when you're alone
A different way to bring you down
Falls apart and hits the ground
'Take it from me' they said
So you take it with a trembling hand

One day you find she's of another mind
And it won't be long until the night comes creeping

Ten million directions coming up and coming on strong
These roads run together in my mind's eye
All I'm leaving behind is a river run dry
I'm not stealing your vision, you're just blind
