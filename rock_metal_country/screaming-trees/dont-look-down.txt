Don't look down...

As we begin to travel mysteries unravel
Control just seems to twist around
Follow me and oh that sound
Don't look down

Never find that key somewhere
So fire ties your walking stick
It served me well but now it's gone
Changing shape and end is long

Don't look down
Don't look down

Get the strangest feeling
Til both become the ceiling
I'm closer for you
You're closer to the secret I'm revealingDon't look down

We go back to a time when
Things weren't quite so numbered
Like ashes in the air I'm being scattered everywhere

As we begin to travel the mysteries unravel
Control just seems to twist around
Follow me and oh that sound

Don't look down
Don't look down
Don't look down
