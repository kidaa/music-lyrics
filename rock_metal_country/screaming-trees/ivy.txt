You're climbing down fast
Down where no one can see
Your eyes in the moonlight turn white to blue
Don't think I really want to know where you've been
Just want your grip tight around my skin

I said ivy on the wall
I know way that you creep and crawl

There's a dark-haired girl on a mattress
And there's a room suspended in the air
Echoes screaming through my empty soul
And when it melts in my mouth
Well then I just don't knowIvy on the wall
I know the way that you creep and crawl
I said ivy on the wall
And in your eyes I can see it all

Wake up in the morning, it's another time
Blood red rain on the window pane
Oh, I've got to let you go
But you know I don't believe it
They tell me it's all over

Ivy on the wall
I know by the way that you creep and crawl
I said ivy on the wall
And in your eyes I can see it all
Ivy on the wall
Ivy on the wall
Ivy on the wall
Ivy...
