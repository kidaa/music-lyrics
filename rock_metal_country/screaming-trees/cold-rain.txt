I walk in cold rain
With my telescope in my hand
I had to go 27,000 miles with this cane
Now it's broken into pieces
So little time remains

I hear these voices in in the air
And I know they're just repeating
The language of the land
And the sky that I survey

I'm reciting all the verses
Prayin' straight from the book beside my bed
It's different now I'm here
Every question's coming clear

Yeah I found so many places
That I don't know where I'm at
Came right on every story
And now I can't come back

And these voices in the aisle
And I know they're just repeating
The language of the land
And the sky that I surveyEverywhere I have to go
Is so very far away
Away
Yeah, so far away
Too far away

I get these voices in my head
But I know they're just repeating
The language of the land
And the sky that I survey
Everywhere I have to go
Is so very far away

I walk in cold rain
I got my telescope in my hand
I had to go 27,000 miles with this cane
But it's broken into pieces
And so little time remains

I walk in cold rain
I walk in cold rain
Cold rain
I walk in cold rain
Cold rain falling down
I feel the cold rain falling down
I feel cold rain falling down
