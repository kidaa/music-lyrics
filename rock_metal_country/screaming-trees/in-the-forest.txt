Ah come on now won't you tell me how you feel
Black and white explaining that my eyes are all but sealed
Sentimental memories call you back to your life
But a vaguely clouded window pane destroys my views tonight
Come on baby do like me, a cat on the prowl

Gotta go where my thoughts would take me
Not a lot of miles to take me
Gotta go where my thoughts would take me
Wanna live in the forest baby, yeah

Now I don't wanna hear it if you're telling me your lies
I wanna leave the city and a million staring eyes
All the leaves surrounded brought up in a sea of green
I've got a pain inside my heart now can't you see babe
Do like a cat, say meow
All right now

Gotta go where my thoughts would take me
Not a lot of miles to take me
Gotta go where my thoughts would take me
I wanna live in the forest baby
Not a lot of miles to take me
Out here to the forest baby, yeah

Well come on out into my forest
Out here they're gonna all ignore us
In the middle of a brand new day
I wanna love you mama, yeah
As many times as a I can
I wanna see this town explode without a sound
Cause no one else would come around, yeah

Gotta go where my thoughts would take me
Not a lot of miles to take me
Gotta go where my thoughts would take me
Wanna live in the forest baby
Not a lot of miles to take me
Out here to the forest baby

Oh out in the forest
And she's white and black
They can't call me or turn me back
This animal's wild and he roams where he wants
Don't care about the people cause I can't hear 'em talk
Out here in the forest
Out in the forest
