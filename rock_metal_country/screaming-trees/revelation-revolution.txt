Come down with me
I've got a time machine held between my fingers
Knowing now your head is loaded
So heavy as the smoke still lingers
Restless lights creeping in
Your body splits in two again

It's easy when you're finding that
Stars don't sparkle where you're at
Tomorrow comes too late held back
It's a revelation revolution

Residing in a land that's either
Far away or near to my eyes
Life inside a tear with someone
Tellin' fears that fall from blue skies
Back into the darkest cell
Light won't come soon you can tell
That it's fading fast as time
It's a revelation revolutionCome down with me and see
This time machine held between my fingers
Confused and unused landing
Heavy as the smoke still lingers
Anxious sounds creeping in
Your soul splits in two again

It's easy while you're finding that
Stars don't sparkle where you're at
Tomorrow comes too late held back
It's a revelation revolution
It's a revelation revolution
Whoa
