In the land where we must speak every one of us will roam
The birds that fly here never know
Tallest trees or windows blow

Now your mind is next to mine
Infinity leaves us behind
Now your mind is next to mine
We go on down the road of time

Mirrors go on down below
No one knows just where we go
In a sea far past the night
Don't wake up and scream in fright

Repeat chorus

Now we know where we will be
Together in the darkened trees
The human race down on its knees
Someday yeah you will see

Repeat chorus
