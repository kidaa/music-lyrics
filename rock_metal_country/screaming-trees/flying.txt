Moving around in the outer reaches
Hiding out with all the creatures there
The dirt is drifting down upon us
But my friends would never crack a frown
We're going to the poison planet
We're going to it now
Looking beyond this point in time
Seems unreal somehow

Time to know just what I'm buying
Cold still walls remain
And I'm flying

Trapped in the valley of love you're giving
Special power
Now what was that
Looking to you with gratitude that seems unreal somehowTime to know just what I'm buying
Cold still walls remain
And I'm flying
Flying

Moving around in the outer reaches
Hiding out with all the creatures there
The dirt is drifting down upon us
But my friends would have never cracked a frown
Million worlds our soul is gutted
It seems unreal somehow

Time to know just what I'm buying
Cold still walls remain
And I'm flying
Flying
You gotta watch me fly
