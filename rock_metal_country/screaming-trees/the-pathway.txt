Come on
The sound of the ocean destroys the silence
And he stands on the edge of the morning
With the rising tides and he's watching day lay
His will is strong but his legs are failing, yeah
On the pathway
Moving ever forward down the pathway

Throw flowers from electric circles
No mother, father, brother, sister
The whole of the ocean is bathed in sunlight
His first contact is his only sight
On the pathway
Moving ever further down the pathwayThe sound of the ocean destroys the silence
As he stands on the edge of the morning
Maybe the answers don't come at all
Just the pain and echo of his call
On the pathway
Moving ever further down the pathway
Moving ever, ever further down the pathway
Go on
Pathway....
