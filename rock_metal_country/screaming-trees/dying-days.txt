All these dying days
I walk the ghost town
Used to be my city
I seen a holy man
Seen him crying with the Mother Mary
All these dying days

Yes it's too late
This life isn't mine
Lord hear me pray
Can you ease my mind
Now they're gone forever
Jesus I done gone over
Sleeping alone you
Stay on your side
If I couldn't lie
Like all of a thousand other times
I wouldn't be on this highway
Taken on down this highway

all these dying days... repeat, waiting for the sunshine x2
