Yeah, come on, it's nice and cozy along

If you'll only look into yourself
And find the time but dear it's past
Pigeonholed behind the canvasses
Shades here like you've never witnessed

Step out of your frightened circle
The gaze of eyes will feel so cold
Where blackness covers all you want to know

Faces turning in upon themselves
Climbing up and falling down from above
It's you I want to give my loveThrough colors bending we would see
Reflect the best come back to me
Tell me if you have to be

chorus
Whoa I see it

If you're lonely look into yourself
And find the time to fear is past
Pigeonholed behind the canvasses
Shades here like you've never witnessed

chorus
