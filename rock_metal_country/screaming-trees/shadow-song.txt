Can't get back, can't remind you
We're closer now than I would want to be
They think it's easy if you just imagine
Before the dust will trip you up again

Choose the way that you want to go now
I'll meet you there, meet you there somehow
We leave behind all this worried puzzle
Wake from a dream, I knew you'd be there still

Don't you step into the shadows
Into a place where nobody goes
Through a gate where everything flows
With the fallen shadows

Down the street lined with dirt and plastic
When you appeared I just happened to be
In the midst of another nightmare
Taking me back just like I knew it wouldDon't you step into the shadows
There's a place where nobody goes
Through a gate where everything flows
With the fallen shadows

In the dark there's no-one with me
There's no stars to warm my skin
I'd light a match if I could hold one
It's coming over me again
It's coming over me again, yeah

Let this feeling go on past us
Let this cage turn into rust
So many pieces and so many people
You'll never figure out just who I was then

Don't you step into the shadows
Into a place where nobody goes
Through a gate where everything flows
With the fallen shadows
