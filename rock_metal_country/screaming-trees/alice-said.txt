Alice said to come on in now it's time for bed
The hour's Quite late I need a nap to clear my head
And later, down, the pillow softly calls to me

I've never sent down, bounced all around
Now I can't see
Blind, happily

Alice said have you forgotten what will be
Concealed in smiles that come too late now I can't see
The sun goes down, thoughts go astray
She might take my soul away

Don't close the shade
Until the twilight fadesAlice said to come on in now it's time for bead
The hour's Quite late I need a nap to clear my head
The sun goes down, thoughts go astray
She might take my soul away

Don't close the shade
Until the twilight fades

Don't close the shade
Until the twilight fades
