Where are you walking to
There's a trap door straight ahead, falling through
What are you gonna do
Gonna do

Visions have us on the wall
Sister's spellbound in the hall
The house is dark and everybody's happy
Close my eyes to the dawn
There's a wheel of destruction coming on
It's all we never said, never said

Visions have us on the wall
Sister's spellbound in the hall
The house is dark and everybody's happyThe time for light is over
Darkness dropped you couldn't deal
These are things we shouldn't let go
Secrets you shouldn't know
But it's alright
Just as far as you know, it's alright

Where are you walking now
Your neck's inside a trap coming down
Our heads are filled with all the things
We used to say and everything we never said
Never said

Visions have us on the wall
Sister's spellbound in the hall
The house is dark and everybody's happy
