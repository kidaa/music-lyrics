I sit alone, discontent
Your ears don't hear what I say
After awhile you disconnect
To set you apart from the pain
I walked past you all your life
But there is only one place
Next to you where I decide in the presence of your grace

Hide your eyes from what is real
And you don't know what I'll do
Your pattern's locked in all these drawers
But only one holds your clue

Watch for people coming through
They don't know where I stand
One foot is by your side and one in another land

I've been down so many roads
As a child too far away
I've been down so many roads
I was travelin' too far away, and I say

I return from miles away
To find that I didn't know you
I would go where the river flows if I were able to
But I walk by you once again
There is only one place
Next to you where I decide in the presence of your grace

I've been down so many roads
As a child too far away
I've been down so many roads
I was traveling too far away
I've been down so many roads
I was traveling too far away
