Watching shadows fall across the floor
And the wind blows wild
Step outside into the night
Step outside myself for awhile

It all comes apart but then my eyes
Try to put it back together
It all comes apart could I ever
Put it back together

The yellow truck slows to a halt
Now come the dogs it don't matter
Walking all alone down a one way street
Best time I ever hadIt all comes apart but then my eyes
Try to put it back together
It all comes apart could I ever
Put it back together

I watch the shadows fall across the floor
And the wind blows wild
Step outside into the night
Step outside myself for awhile

It all comes apart and my eyes
Try to put it back together
It all comes apart could I ever
Put it back together
