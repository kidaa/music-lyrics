A dark cloud a hangin' out over my head
I woke up this morning to an empty bed
Why she left me is hard to say
Well is this fate or just a bad day
Chorus
Is this bad luck or just bad timin'
Or is it the lies I told it's hard to say
Can you get back what's gone they say so
If you get down on your knees and believe and pray
But some prayers are hard to pray
Well some things it's hard to say
Thumb up in the air and I'm a hitchin' a ride
Plenty cars passin' but I'm on the wrong side
If I cross over will they go my way
Is this fate or just a bad day
Chorus repeats twice
