It's bone dry and hot here in Paradise Arkansas
Never seen cracks like the cracks in this dirt
It's Uncle Cliff on the phone, but I really think the Lord called
When he said come on down boy and I'll put you to work
It hasn't been easy letting you go
But I think I'm finally on that road
Chorus
Cause there ain't no blue '92 Cavalier
There ain't no moonlight drive-in here
There are days you don't even cross my mind
There's no one here that I don't want to see
There's no one here that don't want to see me
I ain't found it yet, but I'm convinced there's a life
Somewhere between you and Paradise
I've been hanging around with a girl here in town
Every time I look she's looking better
But I'm still not sure I can take your voice on the phone
So I wrote you this letter
It hasn't been easy letting you go,
But I think I'm finally on that road
Chorus
I'm not gonna apologize for the way I just disappeared
I couldn't bear another minute without you
Thank God I'm here
Chorus
Somewhere between you and Paradise
