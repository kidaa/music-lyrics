Oh what a night in Bethlehem
Something's going on in Bethlehem
Gonna head that way --- gonna check it out
And see what all this fuss is about in Bethlehem
Chorus
And oh what a night
And oh us shepherds we all came
And the wise men proclaim
Of this virgin girl is a King
And the light of the world
And oh what a night
Oh what a night in Bethlehem
I had to see for myself in Bethlehem
A light came down now it reaches out
To show us what this fuss is about in Bethlehem
And oh what a night
And oh us shepherds we all came
And the wise men proclaim
Of this virgin girl is a King
And the light of the world
And oh what a night
And oh what a night
Oh what a night in Bethlehem
Oh what a night in Bethlehem
And oh
And oh
And oh
Oh what a night in Bethlehem
And oh
Oh what a night in Bethlehem
