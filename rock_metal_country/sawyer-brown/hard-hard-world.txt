Out of bed, hit the floor a cup of coffee and hit the door
Start the car, wave goodbye try to get to work on time
Whistle blows, you make it home to see your kids before their grown
You love your woman and do her right and try to get a little sleep at night
Chorus
Cause it's a hard world
Getting tougher by the minute
It's a race to finish and everybody's in it
I don't know what I'd do without you girl
Livin' in a hard hard world
You punch a clock you do the job you pull the lever and turn the knob
You bite your tongue and let it slide
Anytime I hurt your pride
Come Friday you get your pay get in your car and drive away
A can of beans a chunk of ham with what you didn't give to Uncle Sam
Chorus
Cause it's a hard world
Getting tougher by the minute
It's a race to finish and everybody's in it
I don't know what I'd do without you girl
Livin' in a hard hard world
Bridge
It's a hard world
Getting tougher by the minute
It's a race to the finish and everybody's in it
And I don't know what I'd do without you girl
Baby it's a hard it's a hard world,
Getting tougher by the minute
It's a race to the finish and everybody's in it
I don't know what I'd do without girl
Baby it's a hard hard world
Baby it's a hard hard world
Were livin' in a hard hard world
yeah
