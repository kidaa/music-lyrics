So tell me all about it baby
How loves a conquest of the heart
How life's a motel for your dreams
It's just a runnin' start
Love's an addiction, love survives
It's so connected to our lives
I look in your eyes and all I see
Is my life go by
Chorus
So break my heart again on Monday morning
Crash the car into a bridge of sighs
Tear our love apart on Thursday evening
Put it back together Friday night
I keep on falling down your street
Oh nothin' can save me now
No little voices speak to me
Love's an addiction, love survives
It's so connected to our lives
It's like a lion in the dark, it waits for you
Chorus
Love's an addiction, love survives
It's so connected to our lives
And like a matinee, I watch as tears go by
Chorus
So break my heart again baby
Oh nothin' can save me now
Put it back together Friday night
Break my heart again baby
So break my heart again on Monday morning
