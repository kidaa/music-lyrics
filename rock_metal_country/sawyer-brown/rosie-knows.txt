Am I the only one who's runnin' 'round in Rosie's mind tonight?
Was there a fight?
And could there be another behind that look in Rosie's eyes tonight
She's tryin' to hide?
Is my imagination runnin' wild?
Is someone runnin' after my honey child?
chorus
Rosie knows, but she won't say
What's goin' on inside her head that makes her look that way
No, no, the girl ain't talkin'
But by the way she's walkin'
Rosie knows, but she won't say
She says i got no reason for ever disbelievin' she'd be true
Boy you got no clue
I got to pull myself together before I pave a jealous rode to ride
It's gonna break my stride
My heart don't care what my mind says it heard
When she gives me that look without a word
chorus
Rosie knows, but she won't say
What's goin' on inside her head that makes her look that way
No, no, the girl ain't talkin'
But by the way she's walkin'
Rosie knows, but she won't say
chorus
Rosie knows, but she won't say
What's goin' on inside her head that makes her look that way
No, no, the girl ain't talkin'
But by the way she's walkin'
Rosie knows, but she won't say
