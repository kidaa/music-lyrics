Well I came up from Goodland, Kansas
I turned eighteen today
I'm college bound for Lincoln
Nebraska's where I'll stay
It's been my dream all my life
To play football on this field
And if I ever get the chance
I'll make you this deal
I'll work hard I'll do my part
You won't hear me complain
I'll never go down easy
I swear I'll pull my weight
Hey there Mr. Osborne
I'll do anything to play
And it sure would be a honor sir
To call you coach someday
Here in the middle of the middle west
We ain't afraid to fight
Well I've looked to you sir
Now I'll look you in the eye
Well I hear something calling me
Like I've never heard before
It's a red and white freight train
And I wanna get on board
I'll work hard I'll do my part
You won't hear me complain
I'll never go down easy
I swear I'll pull my weight
Hey there Mr. Osborne
I'll do anything to play
And it sure would be a honor sir
To call you coach someday
I came up from Goodland, Kansas
I turned eighteen today
I'm college bound for Lincoln
Nebraska's where I'll stay
