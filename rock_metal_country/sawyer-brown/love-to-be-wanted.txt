Well I get suspicious girl and I guess I shouldn't be
Your dressin' up to kill is killin' me
When you start turnin' heads it turns me inside out
Well I ain't a jealous man but I got a doubt
And I gotta find out
Chorus
Do you love to be wanted or want to be loved
When you let your hair down and push comes to shove
Is all that I have always enough
Do you love to be wanted or w-w-want to be loved
You're just so pretty girl you can't help the way you look
And you know when it comes to fools I wrote the book
I don't mean to point my finger
I don't mean to accuse
But I'm so in love and you're so much to lose I gotta know the truth
Chorus repeats twice
Do you love to be wanted or w-w-want to be loved
Do you love to be wanted or w-w-want to be loved
