Who would have thought an innocent dance
Would leave two hearts with even half a chance
And who would have know after all this time
We would search and that we would find
Chorus
In a town this big in a house this small
In a world so flat that there could exist
A love like that a love like this
So young so green so blue so bold
Who would have thought that
We would brake the mold
So afraid to fall and scared not to
If we had only known what our hearts knew
Chorus
Repeat Chorus
