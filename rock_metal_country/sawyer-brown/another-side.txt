We came out from sheffield and they put us on the line
You could smell the powder burning and man it hurt my eyes
They knew them boys were tired and weak
We were fresh and we were strong
We could not what to blast away and make our presence known
Every time I took my aim and got one in my sight
In my heart I knew the way and this way was not right
Chorus
I guess my daddy would be proud but my mamma she's ashamed
And I know deep down we need a change
Them Northern boys are friends of mine
But I've got my Southern pride
I'm standing here a fighting wishing there was another side
We burned each others crops and fields
And took the very best
We fought are we back and forth and they puts us to the test
I know that some things are wrong
But what gave them the right
To point their righteous fingers and expect us not to fight
We all cried on the night they burned Atlanta down
How much more can we take and still stand our ground
Chorus
I guess my daddy would be proud but my mamma she's ashamed
And I know deep down we need a change
Them colored boys are friends of mine
But I've got my Southern pride
I'm standing here a fighting wishing there was another side
In four years the smoke had cleared
And I went back to the farm
Little brother met me at the bridge and he held out his arms
He was thin and weak and wounded and dressed in Yankee blue
Well I cried and I held him and together we both knew
If it could be done other there would be a better way
Still one family and one nation oh but what a price we pay
Chorus
I guess my daddy would be proud but my mamma she's ashamed
And I know deep down we need a change
Now some of them boys were friends of mine
But dang this Southern pride
I'm standing here a crying wishing there was another side
I'm wishing there was another side
Wishing there was other side
