Past the fields of his dreams all the cars drove
Ninety to nothin' towards town
He'd wave and he'd watch and he'd wonder
Then the dust would all settle back down
Well ain't nothin' out there but an old drive in screen
Where Elizabeth Taylor was queen
And like the rest she quit comin' around
To the outskirts of town
They say there's so much out there for you
Maybe he never will know
The buses they load up the dreamers
But leavin' was to far to go
Washed in the blood and surrounded
By the land and the love he had known
Now he'll plant his dreams in the ground
On the outskirts of town
Chorus
On the outskirts of town he's livin' a dream
Where they weather their storms
Praying down on the their knees
And they hold to each other 'cause they know what they found
On the outskirts of town
He looks past the fields at the sun rise
Watchin' the stars as they fade
He sits on the hood of his pick-up
Thinkin' that he's got it made
Because the prettiest girl that he's ever seen
Lives up the road just a piece
And they're talkin' about settling down
On the outskirts of town
Chorus
On the outskirts of town
On the outskirts of town
