There were clouds rollin' in
Rain on the wind
There at the end of September
Your sweater was white
It was buttoned up tight
Darlin' you see I remember
Chorus
Every little thing, every little thing
So real so strong, such a long time gone
Here I am still holding on
To every little thing, every little thing
I remember again how you squeezed my hand
Now and then as we walked down the hall
We stood under the light
When you kissed me goodnight
Now I can't help but recall
Chorus
Where you've gone I don't know
But some how I've got to let go
Here I am still holding on
To every little thing
Every little thing
