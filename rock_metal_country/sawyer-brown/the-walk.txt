Down our long dusty driveway
I didn't wan't to go
But I set with tears in my eyes wondering
Daddy took me by the hand
Looked out at the school bus and his little man and said,
Don't worry boy it will be all right
Chorus
Cause I took this walk your walking now
Boy, I've been in your shoes
You can't hold back the hands of time
It's just something you've got to do
So dry eyes I understand just what your going through
Cause I took this walk with my old man
Boy, I've been in your shoes
Down our long dusty driveway
I set my mind to go
I was eighteen and wild and free and wondering
Daddy took me by the hand
Look at the world and his grown man and said,
Don't worry boy it will be all right
Chorus
Down our long and dusty driveway
This time we both would go
He had old and gray
And his mind was wandering
Daddy took me by the hand
Said, I know where were going and I understand
Don't worry boy it will be all right
Chorus
