The world's full of questions you thought I had the answers for
I see you look at the world with eyes I had before
You see in me something I never found
'Till I found you by my side
Now I never want to let you down
Chorus
But sometimes a hero
Seems awfully far from home
But even a hero
Can't all ways stop the cold wind when it blows
But If you hold tight, the long night
Will soon be tomorrow
And you'll find me when you need
Sometimes a hero
Without the wind, there would be no sails
And If not for you
There would be no hero in me
There are times I have shined
And there are times that I fail
Sometimes a hero he'll ride off
But he'll be back again another day
Chorus repeats twice
