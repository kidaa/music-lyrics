Mama told me when I was three
The street'll never get you no where
You take a street car jumpin' and back beat bump
And get along like it isn't there
You hold your head up high
Like you're gonna fly
You take the bitter 'til you find the sweet
And when you got that crowd and it's screamin' loud
You leave them sittin' on the edge of their seat
Chorus
You gotta step that step
Walk that walk
Shake that thing
Honey talk that talk
Hollywood, if New York could
Keep you babblin' 'til the break of day
No time to rest and you've got to feel blessed
'Cause you're gonna get it anyway
You start to wail and your face turns pale
You've got to pump it till your pistol pops
And as the eagle flew baby so will you
Cause you're climbin' all the way to the top
Repeat Chorus Six Times
