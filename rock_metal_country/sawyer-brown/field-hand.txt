I could not repay in one lifetime
All the love you gave me
You've become such a woman
Still you let me call you baby
I love you now and I always will
I would gladly be the fieldhand, if you were the field
I'd take the rain - it makes us grow
That's what you always told me
I'd take the plow firm in my hand
Just the way you hold me
I'd cultivate the valley and the hill
I would gladly be the fieldhand, if you were the field
I would sprinkle the morning dew
When the lonely nights were thru
I would hang a harvest moon
So its light would shine on you
To help you grow would truly be my will
I would gladly be the fieldhand, if you were the field
I would gladly be the fieldhand, if you were the field
