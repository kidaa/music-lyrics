Pretty packages are flashing down the sidewalk
Bells are ringing as the people go their way
Christmas time around the world
For every boy and girl
There will come a time they'll
Wonder how it started
Chorus
In just one night the world was changed forever
Just one life given willingly
And I remember ---
That December how it started
In just one night
Little children with a list of all their wishes
Busy shoppers with a list of what they need
Every year we start anew with so many things to do
We forget sometimes just why it is we do them
In just one night the world was changed forever
Just one life given willingly
And I remember ---
That December how it started
In just one night
In just one night
