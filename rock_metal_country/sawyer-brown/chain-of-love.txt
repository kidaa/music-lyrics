Everyone should know a love like this
One you can't hold back, you can't resist
One that shows without a doubt
What life is all about
Chorus
You showed me the more love's given
The more love's found
It's a circle that just keeps goin' around
You gave somethin' to be a part of
You made me a link in the chain of love
You made me a link in the chain of love
I've been up against the wall a time or two
But I never thought that love would get me through
Now I know that love will abide
Because I'm standing on the other side
Chorus repeats twice
