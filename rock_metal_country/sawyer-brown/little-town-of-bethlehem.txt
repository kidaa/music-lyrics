Oh little town of Bethlehem how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep a thousand stars go by
Yet in thy dark street shineth the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight
How silently, how silently the wondrous gift is given
So God imparts to human hearts all the blessings of His heaven
No ear may hear His coming but in this world of sin
Where meek souls will receive Him still the dear Christ enters in
Music Break
Yet in thy dark street shineth the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight
Oh little town of Bethlehem
Oh little town of Bethlehem
Oh Little town
Oh Little town
Oh Little town
Oh little town of Bethlehem
