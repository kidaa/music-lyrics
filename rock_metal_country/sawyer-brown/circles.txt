There's one around my finger
One around my coffee cup
One around the hands of time
And that big orange ball a comin' up
There's one around my eight to five
Four beneath me when I drive
An extra one for overtime circles
There'll be one in the hugs around my legs
And one around my waist
And one around the table holdin' hands and sayin' grace
Chorus
I thank God for circles
For you for me for family and friends
I thank God for circles
May they go 'round and 'round and never have to end
There's one around the block
There's always one around the bend
Any to and from you go
And back again
Some are green and some are golden
Summer turns to winter cold
And into spring the seasons roll circles
There'll be one around the candles
One around the birthday cakes
One around the table holdin' hands and sayin' grace
Chorus
I thank God for circles
For you for me for family and friends
I thank God for circles
May they go 'round and 'round and never have to end
Bridge
There's one around the world
That goes around so we can see it all
One around the halo
When we're called
Chorus
I thank God for circles
For you for me for family and friends
I thank God for circles
May they go 'round and 'round and never have to end
I thank God for family circles, may we find and have so many more of them
