I need to sit and talk to you and open up my heart
I can feel it comin' up from the deepest part
I guess I am tryin' to say I love you, I'm callin' out
Can you hear me now
Chorus
Can you hear it in a whisper
Can you hear it when I shout it loud
Can you hear it in the way I try to say
I feel about you and don't know how
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
I never had a way with words so I haven't said
What I'm getting closer to the closer we get
I think I'm tryin to say I love you ain't no doubt
Can you hear me now
Chorus
Can you hear it in a whisper
Can you hear it when I shout it loud
Can you hear it in the way I try to say
I feel about you and don't know how
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
It really isn't such a meticulous thing
We shouldn't have to work this hard
It can get to be a ridiculous thing
When you let it go this far
I love you
I said I love you
I said I love you
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
