The more you think the less you know
'Cause every heart's got a mind of it's own
And love's a chance that we all take
Again and again make no mistake
it's another little lesson in love
Chorus
Your heart's on fire but it won't burn
Just blowin' until you learn
Answers the questions where love's concerned
Another little lesson in love
Another little lesson in love
Well talk's been cheap since the dawn of time
Ain't nobody bought those pickup lines
It's easier to invent the wheel
Than say the way we really feel
It's another little lesson in love
Chorus Repeats twice
Answers are questions where love's concerned
Another little lesson in love
Another little lesson in love
Just a little lesson in love
