Well I've been called a self-made man
Girl don't you believe it's true
I know exactly how lucky I am
when I'm gettin' this close to you
It's high time I'm giving some praise
to those that got me where I am today
Chorus
I gotta thank mama for the cookin'
Daddy for the whuppin'
The devil for the trouble that I get into
I got to give credit where credit is due
I thank the bank for the money
Thank God for you
A strong heart and a willing hand
That's the secret to my success
A good woman... I try to be a good man
A good job, Lord I know I've been blessed
I'm just a part of a greater plan
It doesn't matter which part I am
Chorus
I gotta thank mama for the teachin'
Daddy for the preachin'
The devil for the trouble that I get into
I got to give credit where credit is due
I thank the bank for the money
Thank God for you
