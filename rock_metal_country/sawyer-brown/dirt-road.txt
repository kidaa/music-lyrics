Daddy worked hard for his dollar
He said some folks don't-but that's ok
They won't know which road to follow
Because an easy street might lead you astray
Chorus
I'll take the dirt road-it's all I know
I've been walking it for years
It's gone where I need to go
Oh it ain't easy-it ain't supposed to be
So I'll take my time
And life won't pass me by
Cause it's right there to find, On the dirt road
I have lived life in the fast lane
You gotta watch your back and look both ways
When it's said and done the time we have Is borrowed
You better make real sure you're headed the right way
Chorus repeats twice
