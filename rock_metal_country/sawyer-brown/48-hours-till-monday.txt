It's friday night and I've been
Workin' all week long
After the rent all I have left
Is this old song
My baby's right beside me
We're gonna have a ball
Ain't gonna care about anything
Anything at all
Chorus
I've got 48 hours and 25 dollars
In change, til monday
Got on my skin tight jeans
And my shirt with the ketchup stains
I've got a hole in my pocket
And the world by the tail
And everything is going my way
I've got 48 hours and 25 dollars in change
We'll get a double dip down
At the Tasty Freeze
Listen to the gossip
Laugh till we can't breath
We'll join the cavalcade of
Down home on parade
Here in our town U.S.A
We really got it made
Chorus
I've got a hole in my pocket
And the world by the tail
And everything is going my way
I've got 48 hours and 25 dollars in change
I've got 48 hours and 25 dollars in change
I've got 48 hours and 25 dollars in change
I've got 48 hours and 25 dollars in change
