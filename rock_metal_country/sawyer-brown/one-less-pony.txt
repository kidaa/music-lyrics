You can wind up empty handed at the altar all alone
Or you can rob a bank in San Antone
She just rambled on a drinking staring at her ring
She look at me and said I just came here to ease the pain
Chorus
'Cause there'll be one less pony in this one horse town
When my spurs hit the ground I'm gonna just ride on out
There'll be one less pony in this one horse town
I've been lassoed by loneliness branded by the blues
I'm gonna exit west put on my hat and cruise
She was talking crazy but her heart was making sense
I moved a little closer and kindly listened in
The hurt was runnin' deeper then the scars would ever show
She looked at me and asked when love leaves where dose it go
Chorus
I've been lassoed by loneliness branded by the blues
I'm gonna exit west put on my hat and cruise
Chorus
I'm gonna exit west put my hat on and cruise
