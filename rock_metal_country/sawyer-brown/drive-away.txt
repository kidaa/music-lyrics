Duet With Dana McVicker
Pack your bags it's time to go
The clock down town runs way to slow
Daddy say's I'll have to wait
But all we got to do is drive away
Chorus
Drive away you and me
We'll blow this town and we'll find our dream
Where we'll stop it's hard to say
We'll leave a trail smokin' when we drive away
We'll leave a trail smokin' when we drive away
With me the lead and you the star
We're way out front in a faster car
Like two dots fading on a silver screen
The credits rolling as we leave
Chorus
Call ahead and tell'em that we're comin'
We'll keep the motor runnin' from now on
Chorus
