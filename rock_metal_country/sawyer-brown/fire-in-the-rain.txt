Well I've been running right behind you
Lord I'm wearing out my shoes
I been saving up my lovin' Saving it for you
Well it's like trying to build a fire in the rain
Chorus
It's like trying to build a fire
When the rain Is pouring down
Like swimming in muddy water
Treading slow until you drown
It's like trying to stop a clock lord
like trying to stop a train
It's like trying to build a fire in the rain
Well I keep asking 'bout your love, dear
But you won't ever say
I've been looking for direction
But you won't show the way
Well it's like trying to build a fire in the rain
Chorus
Well it's like trying to build a fire in the rain
Chorus
