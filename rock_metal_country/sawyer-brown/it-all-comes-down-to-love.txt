Oh it all comes down to love
Talking heads talking to us on the television
Silver screen preachers and politicians
They say they got an answer
First they gotta squeeze us
Send a little money there's a tax on Jesus
Fix it with a prayer fix it with a dollar
Does anybody out there ever want to holler
It all comes down to love
Self help guru has got a best seller
Ricki Lake's got a drag queen bank teller
1-900 look into a crystal
NRA says you better buy a pistol
They made a little pill but it might cause cancer
It's just a cheap thrill when
You're looking for an answer
Chorus
It all comes down to love
It all comes down to love
Suits on wall street make another million
Dealer on the back street talkin' to your children
You cry for help and nobody listens
You lie awake at night a wonderin' what's missing
Don't it make you want to start a new revolution
look into your heart for the one solution
Repeat chorus twice
