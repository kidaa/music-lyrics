I've got to look out my backdoor
Check and see if the coast is clear
I'm talking to my self and I keep it low
Making sure that you don't hear
I never know day to day
If you feel the same way
And I can only believe in
Half of what I'm feeling
Chorus
And I walk the line time after time
You keep me in the middle
The only thing I know
I'm half a heart to stay girl
And half a mind to go
Now I've come to a fork in the road
Which way do I go from here
There's one thing that you got to know
There ain't nothing perfectly clear
You want to know where this ends
I wanna know where it begins
And I'm left here in between
What you say and what you mean
Chorus
I'm half a heart half a mind
Half a heart half a mind
You keep me in the middle
The only thing I know
I'm half a heart to stay girl
And half a mind to go
Half a heart to stay
And half a heart to go
