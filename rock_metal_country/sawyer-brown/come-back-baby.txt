I'm sitting here and got myself situated between a rock and a real hard place
My name is mud and here it gets complicated
I got egg dripping all over my face
You tell me your leaving
You oughta be doing something else tonight
But before you go girl there's just one thing
Chorus
Come back baby
Don't stop coming back baby
Run back baby
Don't stop running back girl
You can call me any ole time
I'll be here with my arms open wide
Come back baby
Don't stop coming back girl
I've been a fool and don't you know I've been taken you for granted
Way way too long I'll be here yeah ready and a waiting
Girl I'll miss you when you're gone
You say that you're leaving
Cause all I do is make you cry
When you've gone too far girl and you want to come home
Chorus
Come back baby
Don't stop coming back baby
Run back baby
Don't stop running back girl
You can call me any ole time
I'll be here with my arms open wide
Come back baby
Don't stop coming back girl
The moon is out and I feel a rush
The stars are shinning bright
Don't want to see you walking away to a lonely night
Chorus
Come back baby
Don't stop coming back baby
Run back baby
Don't stop running back girl
You can call me any ole time
I'll be here with my arms open wide
Come back baby
Don't stop coming back girl
Got to come back
Got to come back
Got to come back
Got to come back
