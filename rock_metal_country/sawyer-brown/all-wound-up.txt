Since I was a baby maybe two or three
Ain't nothin' ever really bothered me
Some poeple rattle at the smallest thing
I thought I could handle anything
But I'm
All wound up nothin' I can do
I get all wound up
Just from talkin' to you
I used to believe I was Immune to love
But look at me now I'm all wound up
I never wondered what it's all about
Never saw a thing I couldn't do without
My feet are used to bein' on the ground
These days I wanna kick 'em around
Cause I'm
All wound up nothin' I can do
I get all wound up
Just from talkin' to you
I used to believe I was Immune to love
But look at me now I'm all wound up
All wound up
All wound up
All wound up
Fame and fortune I can take or leave
One touch from you and
I can barely breathe
Hung out and dryin' for the world to see
Well I've got you all over me and I'm
All wound up nothin' I can do
I get all wound up
Just from talkin' to you
I used to believe I was Immune to love
But look at me now I'm all wound up
I can't get over how I'm all wound up
