Standing in line at the grocery
A bunch of magazines are looking back at me
They got a Bigfoot Elvis and a UFO
Well it's on TV so it must be so
We wanna believe we take the bait
We take it hook and line
Chorus
It's small talk don't you know what I heard about so and so
Can't wait to tell somebody it's getting better every time
It don't seem to matter who we talk about or we taking to
It's just small talk all small talk
Daddy told me when I was young
You got two ears boy and just one tongue
He said the reason why were made that way
We got more to learn then we have to say
I still believe every word he said
But I get caught up sometimes
Chorus
In small talk don't you know what I heard about so and so
Can't wait to tell somebody it's getting better every time
It don't seem to matter who we talk about or we taking to
It's just small talk all small talk
We got a TV show
Talking about a radio talk show
Talking about the way nobody's talking anymore
And by the time it gets around
It leaps the truth with a single bound
And what we need to hear goes out the door
Chorus
With small talk don't you know what I heard about so and so
Can't wait to tell somebody it's getting better every time
It don't seem to matter who we talk about or we taking to
It's just small talk all small talk
