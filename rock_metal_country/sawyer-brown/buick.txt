Rubber necks starin' at the long nose runner parked beside this old GMC
Bright light burnin' but the girl ain't a sayin'
Nothin' she don't want to say
You think that you've got trouble and you think that you been through it
But you ain't seen nothin' till your baby drives a buick
Chorus
My baby drives a buick
My baby drives a buick
You think that you've been through it But you ain't seen nothin' till your baby drives a buick
Slow down sally there's a boulder in the alley and it's lookin' like a no u-turn
I'm scared to death lord I'm holdin' my breath, it looks like we're gonna get burned
I crossed my heart, I said a prayer, she said ain't nothin' to it
But you can never tell when your baby drives a buick
Chorus
You know I could of went steady with a girl in a chevy
I almost went back with a lady in a Cadillac
A Shirley in a pearly white bonneville
Ain't the way I go around gettin' my trills 'cause
Chorus
