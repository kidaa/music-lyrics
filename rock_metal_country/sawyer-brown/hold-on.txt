Hey there remember me
The baby on your knee
The one you said never cried
It's me I'm back again
Things broke that need to mend
Am I to late for old lullabies
And you sang hold on - hold on
There are strong ties in this place
Hold on - hold on
They won't let you slip away
Mornings I once knew
Rise with the new day too
There's things that time can't take away
And that keeps me comin' 'round
So glad to stand home ground
And feel it calling out my name
Saying hold on - hold on
There are strong ties in this place
Hold on - hold on
They won't let you slip away
And you said hold on - hold on
There are strong ties in this place
Hold on - hold on
They won't let you slip away
