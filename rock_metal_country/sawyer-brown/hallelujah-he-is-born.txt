A mighty prayer went up -
An answer came down from above
To save a lonely world God sent His only Son
He came as a baby, quiet as a lamb
With peace in His heart and us all in His hands
Saying I'm gonna show you now
What love is all about and I sing
Chorus
Hallelujah, hallelujah He is born
Hallelujah, He is Christ the Lord
He's the King of Kings, our redeemer and friend
Hallelujah, He is born, amen
Hallelujah, hallelujah He is here
Hallelujah, we've got nothing to fear
To this dark old world He brings a light without end
Hallelujah, He is born, amen
He came in love and peace on that holy night
They came from near and far in that guiding light
Lying in a manger was a baby King
And from that night until this day we sing
Lord Jesus is His name
Heaven and earth proclaim and I sing
Chorus
Repeat Chorus
Hallelujah, amen
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Amen
Hallelujah, hallelujah He is born, amen
