Movin' like a fast train
Callin' it the wild thang
Hopin' that you don't say
Well I've been denied
Lordy I've been denied
Your fever Is high
Your tossin' about
But it ain't love till twist comes to shout
Chorus
When twist comes to shout
Katie bar the back door you ain't gonna let her out
When the walls come a tumblin' down, I said down
You've got heart you got soul you got love
When twist comes to shout
Dancin' with a new shoe
You think you got the swine flu
A hopin' that it ain't true
Well I'll testify
Lordy I'll testify
Gotta make you see
What you've been doin' without
Cause it ain't love 'til twist comes to shout
Chorus
I'm gonna make you see what you've been doin' without
Cause it ain't love 'til twist comes to shout
Chorus
You've got heart, you got soul, you got love
When twist comes to shout
