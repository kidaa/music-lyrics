I can see you've thrown my old slippers out the door
And once again I'll hide 'em like I've done those times before
Honey they just got to where they're feelin' good
And if you only knew me better, you'd know why they would
chorus
I'm just like an old pair of shoes
That get to feelin' good right when a hole wears through
You can wear me like an old pair of shoes
That have done a lot of walkin' through a lot of bad blues
Well I've walked in and out of love before
And like me it won't be the first time these old shoes
Have been thrown out the door
We can shine 'em up and make 'em look as good as new
Wear 'em out on the town and dance a dance or two
You can see they still got a mile or two
You'd have a change of thought and know they're not
Just another old pair of shoes
chorus
I'm just like an old pair of shoes
That get to feelin' good right when a hole wears through
You can wear me like an old pair of shoes
That have done a lot of walkin' through a lot of bad blues
Well I've walked in and out of love before
And like me it won't be the first time these old shoes
Have been thrown out the door
