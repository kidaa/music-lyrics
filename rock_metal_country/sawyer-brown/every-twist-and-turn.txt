Chorus
With every twist and turn we take
We'll get out in the passing lane
And we'll go on like two rolling stones
We live and learn with every twist and turn
You're Mama and Daddy didn't like me none
They didn't like my style
But I worked real hard and I got their respect
But it took a while
Gonna find us a preacher, gonna find you a ring
There's a rock or two on the road
Ain't never gonna think about turning around
No matter how heavy the load
Chorus
We're underpaid in overdrive getting by
Working to find our way
Can't see around the bend so till then
I bought us a lotto ticket just in case
But win or lose girl I'm with you
This much I know for sure
We ain't getting lost where ever we go
Cause your my map of the world
Chorus
It's a long winding way
That's the way love goes they say
Chorus
We live and learn with every twist and turn
