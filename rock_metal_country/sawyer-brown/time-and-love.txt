As she drags on a cigarette
You can tell it's been her first pack
A leopard coat and piled high hair
Thick makeup, skin tight slacks
Tonight she's steppin' out
She thinks If only he could see her now
Chorus
She will leave a trail of turnin' heads
Smokin' bridges and ice cold beds
Avoiding the blame at any cost
She Is spinning wheels and throwing stones
Burying hearts and digging up them bones
Making up for time and love that was lost
She's makin' up for time and love that was lost
She's headed down a one way road
Where hearts don't touch and ends don't meet
Fired by a danger glow
It's in her eyes and on the street
And tomorrow they will talk about
How tonight she went to town
Chorus
And tomorrow he will think about
How tonight she went to town
Chorus
