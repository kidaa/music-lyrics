Nothing to say but I keep on talking
Nowhere to go but I keep walking anyway
Night and day
It's been this way since the day I found you
It's getting worse every time I'm around you what can I say
It's night and day
Chorus
Oh my day judgement was the night met
I say I don't remember but I can't forget
The only time you're on my mind this way...
Is night and day
I miss every time your gone for five minutes
Even if I have a dream your in it anyway
Night and day
We got a love that goes a distance
I used to wonder if that made a difference either way
It's night and day
Chorus
If I'm waking sleeping eating breathing
Making money breaking even
Bottom or the top of the world girl your on my mind
If it's spring fall hot cold
Feast or famine young or old
Maybe not Super Bowl
But that's the only time
We got a love that goes a distance
I used to wonder if that made a difference either way
It's night and day
Oh all I want to say....
It's night and day
