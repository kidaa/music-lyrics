Take a look at my life things are goin' well
It's a good life I'm livin'
When I met you baby I could tell
There was somethin' missin'
What was missin'
Chorus
I need a girlfriend
To show me to show me what love can do
I need a girlfriend
To hold me one that I can hold on to
I need a girlfriend
Who walks and talks like you know who
Oh I need a girlfriend who looks a lot like you
Now I can see, I can see real well
I think they call it intuition
How you got me talkin' to myself
Got me in this condition
Are you listening
Chorus
I need a girlfriend
To show me to show me what love can do
I need a girlfriend
To hold me one that I can hold on to
I need a girlfriend
Who walks and talks like you know who
Oh I need a girlfriend who looks a lot like you
I see em walking around all over this town
I guess I didn't have a clue
Jimmy's got one, Ronnie's got one
Look at Ricky he's got two
He's got two
All I really want
All I really want
All I really want is you
I need a girlfriend to hold me
I need a girlfriend who walks and talks a lot like you know who
Oh I need a girlfriend who looks a lot like you
I need a girlfriend
I need a girlfriend
I need a girlfriend
