I believe this world we live in
Is like a big blue door
That we come in to and then we pass thru
Like so many have done before
And I believe a baby is a miracle
So is the love that life becomes
So begins this beautiful journey
With our Father and with His Son
Chorus
Leading and Guiding
And giving us strength in our faith
I know it's thru grace
I got a plan to be with angels
I got the sweetest promise there has ever been
I got a hand full of people I love
And I want to be there with them
A seven-day saint or a seven-day sinner
It seems my soul is always on the run
But I got a plan to be with angels
I love where angels are comin' from
Sometimes I have this vision
I see that river, and I see the shore
And I walk down into the water
'Till I don't want, 'till I don't want no more
I wake up with this peaceful feeling
In my heart, my soul and my mind
What was once a weight on my shoulders
Is now the hand of something divine
Chorus
Leading and Guiding
And giving me strength in my faith
I know it's thru grace
I got a plan to be with angels
I got the sweetest promise there has ever been
I got a hand full of people I love
And I want to be there with them
A seven-day saint or a seven-day sinner
It seems my soul is always on the run
But I got a plan to be with angels
I love where angels are comin' from
I Got a plan to be with angels
I love where angels are comin' from
