Love up and beat a path to my back door
I could always walk away before
I thought I could get away untouched
But you think to much when you run from love
When you run from love
Chorus
When you run from love
The quickest way ain't fast enough and the
Trains and the planes will let you down
If you hide your eyes
You make a chain of pain and lies and you
Know that you're only losing ground
When you run from love
My heart never beat the beat of a losing kind
could always touch the flame and not feel the fire
Your heart ain't the place you want shelter from
When you run from love
When you run from love
Chorus repeats twice
When your runin' from love
