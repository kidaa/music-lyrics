Well it seemed to be just a dream
But how Is one to know
There was a cat and a man made of tin
There was a chick and an old scarecrow
I got all shook up
I raised my cup
To toast that girl I'd seen
I got my nerve
I threw a curve
And I told her what I mean
Chorus
I said ooh ooh
Where'd you get them ruby red shoes
They look like they could take a man
To a place he could use
We could tap our heels girl
And chase away my blues
If I could talk you out of them ruby red shoes
It ain't hard to tell on a carousel
Just where that horse might go
So I jumped ship
A shootin' from my hip
Headed down that golden road
Well the sky got black
So I turned back
I'm not one to steal the show
Scarecrow was cool
And the cat was too
But me and tin man want to know
Chorus repeats twice
