They tried to lose us in the hype of fortune and fame
We've got them to thank and only us to blame
Now the joker is dealing 'cause the king went blind
We're stayin' out of the shuffle with an ax to grind
We're out of the shuffle with an ax to grind
chorus
I've got by jeans on tight and my shades when it's sunny
You can break my heart-but don't take my money
It's a long long road and an uphill climb
Just leave me my guitar - I'll have an ax to grind
Leave me my guitar - I'll have an ax to grind
Something we're not is what plenty of us were
We've got houses and cars and people callin' us sir
I'd like to give it all up and leave it behind
And join a nameless bunch of pickers with an ax to grind
A nameless bunch of pickers with an ax to grind
chorus
I've got by jeans on tight and my shades when it's sunny
You can break my heart-but don't take my money
It's a long long road and an uphill climb
Just leave me my guitar - I'll have an ax to grind
Leave me my guitar - I'll have an ax to grind
They say our songs are simple and little too wordy
A little bit fast and a little too dirty
You don't make it down the track without any ties
But we've made it this far with just an ax to grind
chorus
I've got by jeans on tight and my shades when it's sunny
You can break my heart-but don't take my money
It's a long long road and an uphill climb
Just leave me my guitar - I'll have an ax to grind
Leave me my guitar - I'll have an ax to grind
