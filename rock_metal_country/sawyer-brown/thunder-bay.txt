I never thought that anyone could do me like you do me
I never thought that love would get in the way
But there was magic in the air and there were stars out on the water
On a moonlit night in thunder bay
Chorus
Was it the lightning on the water
Was it the thunder from the bay
When the night goes down they are hard to tell apart
Just like howling at the moon and barking at the dark
Just like howling at the moon and barking at the dark
The eyes of disillusion keep burning holes right through me
Down in watertown you'll see it all
A willing hand, a second glance at evil in a red dress
I threw in my hand and bet it all
Chorus
I could've walked away
I should've been afraid
I never would've strayed
But I did - yes I did - in thunder bay
Chorus
