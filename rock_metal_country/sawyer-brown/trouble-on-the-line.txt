Operator we must have a bad connection
If you got someone wantin' me
I changed my number when she changed her mind
Operator can't you see
Chorus
There's trouble on the line
Tears are gonna fall
It happens every time
She's up against the wall
Somebody broke her heart
Now she's after mine
The minute that she calls
There'll be trouble on the line
Operator now if we've been disconnected
How does she keep gettin' through
I won't have a choice
If I hear her voice
Operator can't you see
Chorus
The minute that she calls
There'll be trouble on the line
