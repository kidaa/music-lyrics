I had some words with her old man
When I asked him for her hand
'Cause eye to eye, you know, we never could see
Now we're off and we're on our own
As we head in to the danger zone
To find a little pink house for her and me
chorus
We did it for love
We did it for satisfaction
It was the rage of the age and the hour of the main attraction
We finally said, enough is enough
We played it by ear, it came from the heart
We did it for love
Now Mary Beth is doin' all she can
She had her child without her man
She never cared to hear what the town folk would say
They tried to talk her out of keepin' that boy
But in this world she's found no greater joy
Now she's a proud mama
Watchin' the little man play
chorus
She did it for love
She did it for satisfaction
It was the rage of the age and the hour of the main attraction
She finally said, enough is enough
She played it by ear, it came from the heart
She did it for love
My brother fought in the Vietnam war
He left his job and his family chores
I never understood when he said he couldn't let it be
Now it's been twenty years or so
He still talks about how regular joes were somethin' man
Defendin' the land of the free
chorus
They did it for love
they did it for satisfaction
It was the rage of the age and the hour of the main attraction
They finally said, enough is enough
They played it by ear, it came from the heart
They did it for love
chorus
We did it for love
We did it for satisfaction
It was the rage of the age and the hour of the main attraction
We finally said, enough is enough
We played it by ear, it came from the heart
We did it for love
