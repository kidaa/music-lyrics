love doesn't die
it just stops talkin'
there's no good-bye
you just start walkin'
out into the chill of the night
wonderin if your timin was right
but you still can't deny
it was good while it lasted
we had it all for a minute or two
and there's no other place
where the best that two dreamers can do
turns out too good to be true
we really did it this time
there's no returning
we lit up the sky
and went down burnin
if we're burned a little too bright
you showed me what beautiful light
you still can't deny
it was good while it lasted
we had it all for a minute or two
and there's no other place where the best of two dreamers can do
Turns out too good to be true
there's a star up above the world so bright
fallin fast will we ever get it right
make a wish wish i may i wish i might
have you back again for one more night
it was good while it lasted
we had it all for a minute or two
and there's no other place where the best of two dreamers can do
turns out too good to be true
too good to be true
