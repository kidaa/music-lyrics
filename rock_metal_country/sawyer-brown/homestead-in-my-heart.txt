Well it seems that we've been runnin' from are past
Life never gave us time to settle down
And you questioned whether frightened love can last
And that ole highway song is just not where it's at
The trees roll by and the white lines hold me back
From mobile to Denver there's something that they all lack
So until we find a place to make a new start
I will build you a homestead in my heart
Well I'm lookin' at you sleepin' across the seat
And the whine of the trucks are fillin' up my ears
All the highs and lows left somewhere in between
All those one night stands between Dallas and new Orleans
Well I can't offer much except the love
Of a guitar picker ain't nobody thinkin' of
So until we find a place to make a new start
I will build you a homestead in my heart
So until we find a place to make a new start
I will build you a homestead in my heart
