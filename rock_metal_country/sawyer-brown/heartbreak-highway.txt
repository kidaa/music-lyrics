Well I put on my overcoat and shined my walkin' shoes
I've got the sense to get out of the rain
You've got the best of me and I know I can't win
Well I've come to recognize that old familiar pain
Chorus
Well I've been too long on a heartbreak highway
On the wings of love there's a heavy load
But if it can't fly I'll take the train dear
I've done enough cryin' on the shoulder
Of a heartbreak highway
You've thrown away the king of hearts leavin' you the queen
If you play other hearts there in your hand
I won't be the victim of this catch me if you can
It's hard to keep on dancin' girl if you can't hear the band
Chorus repeats twice
Of a heartbreak highway
