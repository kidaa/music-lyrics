Duet With Donna Mc Elroy
Lord, I talk too much and say the wrong things
Time and time again
Still when times get rough yours is the voice
That says I can come home again
Chorus
Beside the still water
This world can't touch me
You're my shield - You're my true friend indeed
You're the still water where I find my peace
When I feel for from you all I need do
Is sit and whisper your name
You're the one place I know where I can go
And find love - that never will change
Chorus
When I feel I can't go on
I can feel you hand gently lead me home
Yes you are Your the still water
Water
Where I find my peace
