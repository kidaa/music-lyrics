Mary, the Son of God is sleeping in your bed
It's a holy mighty crown that awaits His head
But that's not who sweet Mary sees at all
She sees a precious baby lying in a manger stall
Oh but He deserves more than this
This child who's know God's kiss
Chorus
And Mary, sweet Mary cries
And prays inside her heart for God to dry her eyes
And Mary, she understands That we're all in God's hands
Every mother, every child and sweet Mary cries
When the boy became a man they took Him away
He who was without sin was made to pay
When Mary looks upon the cross
She sees that precious baby lying in a manger stall
Oh but when she sees His face
Her heart can't help but break
Chorus
With all this celebrating we get lost along the way
When we forget the reason why we have a Christmas Day
And Mary, sweet Mary cries
And prays inside her heart for God to dry her eyes
And Mary, you understands That we're all in God's hands
Every mother, every child and sweet Mary cries
