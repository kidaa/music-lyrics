At the cafe down on the corner
With a lost look on his face
There ain't no fields to plow
No reason to now
He's just a little out of place
They say crime do pay
But neither does farmin' these days
And the coffee is cold
And he's fifty years old
And he's got to learn to live some other way
At the cafe down on the corner
With a lost look on his face
There ain't no fields to plow
He's busin' tables now
He's just a little out of place
And the meek shall inherit the earth
And the bank shall repossess it
This job don't pay half what it's worth
But it's a thankful man that gets it
At the cafe down on the corner
With a lost look on his face
There ain't no fields to plow
He's wishin' for one now
He's just a little out of place
All these soldiers without wars
And hometown boys without a home
Farmers without fields
Dealers without deals
And they sit here drinking coffee all alone
At the cafe down on the corner
With a lost look on their face
There ain't no fields to plow
They're wishin' for one now
They're just a little out of place
