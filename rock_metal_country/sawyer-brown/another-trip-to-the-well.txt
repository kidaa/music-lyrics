She finds her self alone more and more these days
The man she loves Is gone but the love ain't gone away
Like drawing water up from a well beneath the earth
She dips down in the love she's known to wash away the hurt
Chorus
And she keeps on goin' even when the heartache's growin' strong
There's a peace she's knowin' like a river flowin' on
It's been there all along
And when the darkness fell
She made another trip to the well
She's worked real hard for love - she's earned her memories
She may be looking back - but that ain't all she sees
She wears a cross around her neck to show what she believes
It's the love at heart not the love at hand that never ever leaves
Chorus repeats twice
