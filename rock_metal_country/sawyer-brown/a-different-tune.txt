I need a harder heart to take the place
Of this one you brake in two
Man I could use a new guitar
To play a different tune
Your trail is hot man it's still smokin'
You're gone for good baby I ain't dumb
I knew that you were tired of hearin'
The same ole song I sung
You packed up your magazine
The one that tells you what to do
I'm not the kind of man you need
To make your dreams come true
Chorus
I need to find a faster car
To give you a little more room
I need a longer lariat
To lasso you the moon
I need a harder heart to take the place
Of this one you brake in two
Man I could use a new guitar
To play a different tune
Babe was I that ripe for the pickin'
You set your sights like a loaded gun
The bullet hit but it ain't stickin'
It's hard to shoot when your on the run
I'm the one you set your sights for
But not the one you're gonna keep
You go out running after midnight Walkin' in my sleep
Chorus
I need a harder heart to take the place
Of this one you brake in two
Man I could use a new guitar
To play a different tune
Man I could use a new guitar To play a different tune
