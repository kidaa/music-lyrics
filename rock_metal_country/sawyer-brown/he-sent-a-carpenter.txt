In a manger filled with hay
The Virgin Mother's baby lay
While shepherds stood trembling at the site
This child was the King of Kings
But God who knows and sees all things
Sent a simple man to show the world the light
Chorus
He sent a carpenter
A carpenter to build His kingdom here
A carpenter
He sent a carpenter
To build on faith not fear
The proof lay in those nail scarred hands
So every heart could understand
He sent a carpenter to
Build His kingdom here
His father's house here on earth
Was built on faith and by His works
Grew strong just like the rock it stood upon
Then God spoke to His only Son
And told him that his job was done
When that last nail was finally driven home
Chorus
The proof lay in those nail scarred hands
So every heart could understand
He sent a carpenter to
Build His kingdom here
He sent a carpenter to
Build His kingdom here
