I'll say my peace and I'll play my hand
And maybe this way you'll understand
I'm short on words I was raised that way
But I still mean all the ones I say
Chorus
And with ring I promise you
Everything that I have or can do
There's so many roads that love can run
But here in my heart your the only one
I do all right here on my own
But you give me things I've never known
Oh here I am getting up my nerve
It may not be all that you deserve
Chorus
Repeat Chorus
Here in my heart your the only one
