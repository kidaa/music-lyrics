You can tell by the way the kids are all grinning
And by the size of the crowds in and out of church
When there's this many men
Out shopping with the women
You know it's not just another day off from work
Chorus
It's Christmas
It could only be Christmas
Perfect strangers on the sidewalk singing songs
Giving is such a part of living
Oh I wish it could be Christmas all year long
If people smile even when it's against their nature
When the news hunts down something nice to say
And they even get along in the legislature
You know it's not just any old holiday
It's Christmas
It could only be Christmas
Perfect strangers on the sidewalk singing songs
Giving is such a part of living
Oh I wish it could be Christmas all year long
I wish it was Christmas all year long
I wish it was Christmas all year long
I wish it was Christmas all year long
I wish it was Christmas all year long
