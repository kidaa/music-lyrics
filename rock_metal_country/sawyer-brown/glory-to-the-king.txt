Happy birthday baby Jesus
We just wanted You to know
We still think the whole world of You
Even when it doesn't show
Chorus
And all the angels sing
Glory to You, the King
With Your birth came new beginnings
Echoes from that silent night
Like the star above the manger
You still guide us with Your light
And all the angels sing
Glory to You, the King
And all the angels sing
All the angels sing
No one need walk all alone now
No heart should be without joy
Love has come and lives among us
Since You came as a baby boy
And all the angels sing
Glory to You, the King
And when we sing, we sing for You
We sing to You
We sing glory, all glory to the King
And all the angels sing
And all the angels sing
Glory to You, the King
