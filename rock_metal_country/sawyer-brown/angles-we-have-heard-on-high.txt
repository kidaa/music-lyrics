ANGELS we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains
Gloria in excelsis deo
Gloria in excelsis deo
Shepherds, why this jubilee
Why your joyous strains prolong
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly song
Gloria in excelsis deo
Gloria in excelsis deo
Come to Bethlehem and see
Him whose birth the angles sing
Come adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord, our newborn King
Gloria in excelsis deo
Gloria in excelsis deo
Gloria ANGELS we have heard on high
Gloria Sweetly singing o'er the plains
Gloria And the mountains in reply
Gloria Echoing their joyous strains
