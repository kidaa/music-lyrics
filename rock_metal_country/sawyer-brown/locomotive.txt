A wreckless heart was beatin' in that restless girl of
Mine and I was thinkin' that she'd be all right,
That train has been around and now it finally crossed her
Mind and the midnight run was rollin' right on time
It was rollin', rollin' right on time.
chorus
It was a lo-loco motive,
Even if it were a bull she would have rode it
To get out of here she didn't care.
It was a lo-loco motive,
It would have been a car, could have been a plane,
Just so happened to be the midnight train
Those mighty wheels will rumble as they pass the hobo
Jungle and I bet he's wishin' now that he had stayed,
I never should have let her, guess i should have known her
Better and I would if it wasn't for that train.
If it wasn't, wasn't for that train.
chorus
It was a lo-loco motive,
Even if it were a bull she would have rode it.
To get out of here she didn't care.
It was a lo-loco motive,
It would have been a car, could have been a plane,
Just so happened to be the midnight train.

She never really left me, she just left that one horse town
She hit the track and she won't be back to stand on common ground
chorus
It was a lo-loco motive
Even if it were a bull she would have rode it.
It was a lo-loco motive,
It would have been a car, could have been a plane,
Just so happened to be the midnight train.
