Your lookin' lonely
And only the lonely would know
Your thinking far from here
Would be an ideal place you could go
But the stars on the water dancin' from the sky
Makin' the way for that big one out tonight
Chorus
There's still a moon over Miami
And I know this is love hangin' in the air
This could be the night
The night of all nights
If we just take our time
Oh I know we'll find
There's still a moon over Miami
Key Largo is just way too far to go
These old trade winds are blowin' warm and slow
There's no mistaken what's goin' around tonight
The evidence is shinin' in your eyes
Repeat chorus twice
