[3D]

Take me where the tides start
And i can pull you into me
You're really crushing gravity
Your corona is reaching consequences
 my 

It all comes back to me

Collects like dust around my head
And lightly rings and clings
Can't be shakin' off the 
Like characters we  and 
You're  to  you
There's nothing i can save for this
No fold it up in 2 of this
No  string
No flight-path
No cream

Comes back to me
Comes back to me
It all comes back to me
It all comes back to me
It all comes back to me
Comes back to me
Comes back to me
Don't kiss me

Infrared to find you
I fly in to remind you
I burnt my universe for you
Attracted to opposing poles
As you know the proverb goes

It  you history
No use to me, no mystery
No use to me, no use to see
No use to me, no use to see
No use to me, no use to see
Comes back to me
No use to me,  to me
