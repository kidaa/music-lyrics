You sure you wanna be with me i've nothing to give
Don't lie and say this lovin's best
Don't leave us in emotional place
Take a walk take a rest now take a rest

I seen ya diggin a hole in ya neighborhood
You're crazy but you're lazy
No need to live in a lean-to
Your troubles must be see-through
See through money like it's paper
With faces i remember
I drink on a daily basis though it seldom calms my temper
Ya leave me in peace, ya leave me in pieces

I walking through the suburbs
We're not exactly lovers
Your a couple specially
When your body's double
Duplicate and then you wait for the next kuwait

Deflowering my baby are you my baby mate
I must be crazy you see i'm swayze
You diggin a hole in ya neighborhood
You're crazy but you're lazy must be lazy

The fire that rises in me
The daisy ??? dwindle
??? like a jungle in decline
My time has been so wasteful
I never fight time
Deflowering my baby are you my baby mate
My baby
Deflowering my baby are you my baby mate
I must be crazy i know you're lazy
