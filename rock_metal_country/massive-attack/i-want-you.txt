[Madonna]

I, yi yi yi

I want you the right way
I want you, but i want you to want me too
Want you to want me baby
Just like i want you

Da da, da da, da da da

I'll give you all the love i want in return
But half a love is all i feel, sweet darling
It's too bad, it's just too sad
You don't want me no more
But i'm gonna change your mind
Some way, somehow

I want you the right way
I want you, but i want you to want me too
Want you to want me baby
Just like i want you

Da da, da da, da da da

One way love is just a fantasy
To share is precious, pure and fair
Don't play with something you should cherish for life
Oh baby, don't you wanna care
Ain't it lonely out there

I want you the right way
I want you, but i want you to want me too
Want you to want me baby
Just like i want you

I want you the right way
I want you, but i want you to want me too
Want you to want me baby
Just like i want you

I want you, the right way
Want me, baby
Don't play with something
You should cherish for life
