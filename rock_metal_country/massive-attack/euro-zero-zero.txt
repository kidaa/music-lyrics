[3D]

Sitting in my day care
It was day-glo painted
You see me i'm a drinker
You see me now i'm sainted
Chased by the plaintive
Haunted by the medium
Too high to flow too bored to break the tedium
Glow from my tv set was blue like neon
Activate the remote i put the BBC on
I've seen this city, so on
I'm looking out for no-one
Pilot in my eye it gets blue like neon

It gets blue like neon
It gets blue like neon

[Horace Andy]

Can't see nothing wrong
Can't be nothing wrong
Inside of me

[Daddy G]

I walk in a bar, immediately sense danger
You look at me, girl, as if i was a
A total stranger

[3D]

Hysterical, ecstatical no matter, call me stags
It's kind of hard to get a drink or
Just a girl to relax on
Phono, no go zone i go through
Aching aways just to relocate you
Kill us with your fist 
So you mix it with me
I function better when i get approximately
High by my technical flyby
I function better with the sun in my eyes
I function better with the sun in my eyes
I function better with the sun in my eyes

[Horace Andy]

Can't see nothing wrong
Can't be nothing wrong
Inside of me

[Daddy G]

Take a second of me you beckon i'll be
And when you're sad i'll mourn
And when you're down i'm torn
Take a second of me
Said take a second of me
I stand firm for our soil
Lick a rock on foil
Reduce me, seduce me
Dress me up in stussy
Will you be my victim
Show me where to stick em
Take a second of me a second to see

[3D]

In my day-care
On my sofa
One spliff makes daddy go sleep
Makes daddy go sleep
