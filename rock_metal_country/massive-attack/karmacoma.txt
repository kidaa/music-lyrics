[Tricky]

You sure you want to be with me
I've nothing to give
Won't lie and say this lovin's best
Well leave us in emotional pace
Take a walk, taste the rest
No, take a rest

[3D]

I see you digging a hole in your neighborhood
You're crazy but you're lazy
I need to live and I need to
Your troubles must be seen to see through
Money like it's paper with faces i remember
I drink on a daily basis
Though it subtle cools my temper
It never cools my temper

[Tricky]

Walking through the suburbs though not exactly lovers
You're a couple, 'specially when your body's doubled
Duplicate, then you wait for the next kuwait

You sure you want to be with me i've nothing to give
Take a walk take a rest taste the rest
Take a walk take a rest taste the rest
Take a walk take a rest a taste of rest

[Tricky]

Don't want to be on top of your list
Monopoly and properly kissed
We overcome in sixty seconds
With the strength we have to together
But for now, emotional ties they stay severed
When there's trust there'll be treats
And when we funk we'll hear beats

[Tricky]

Don't wanna on top of your list
Monopoly and properly kissed
