The mistery of the New World Order
America - You should leave
You should leave...
America - You should leave
If you can't live your dream
And only the fear of dying
Keeps you going
And then your life becomes
Just another digital restorage!
We are sentenced to death
Before we were even born!
I can't feel you anymore!
I can't feel you anymore!
You fade away! You fade away! x8
Away...
