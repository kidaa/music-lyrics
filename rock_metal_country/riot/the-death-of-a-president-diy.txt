Pussycat pussycat! Kill! Kill! Kill! x2
Kill! Kill! Kill! How far can we go?
Kill! Kill! Kill!
We bring the chaos to your house!
It's a death trap!
My life? - Your life? What you gonna do?
We don't scream for total control!
Just a start but we move fast!
And if you steal this record... We don't care!
And if you buy this record... Be aware!
They want to cut an advert out of your dreams!
No! What do you say? No! What do you say?
Cleaned up - Be polite... Quickly mainstreamed...
It's so dumb, man!
The Atari No-Culture's spreading like fire!
Faced up! Destroy the buy out...
Some like it hot and some are too cool -
Moaning about - Creating rules -
We try to survive in a society
That coordinated lives like files!
Wipe out! No more criticism -
Everybody's trying to get out...
If you denounce me I put the gun up your mouth -
Take you out! And do it loud!
The death of a President! D.I.Y.!
Cute execution but I won't go
Another exemption won't free me!
The illusion grows that we ain't exist...
Your suicide attempt glows in the dark...
The death of a President! The death of a President! D.I.Y.!
The death of a President! The death of a President! D.I.Y.!
The Death of a President! D.I.Y.! x6
The Death - The Death of a President...
Kill! Kill! Kill! x11
The Death of a President!
The Death of a President! D.I.Y.! x6
How far can we go?
Just a start but we move fast!
Spread like fire! Faced up... Spread like fire! Faced up... 
Destroy the buy out - Destroy it now... 
Destroy the buy out - Destroy it now... 
Take my eyes out of my head. Take my eyes out of my head....
I can't take it anymore...
The illusion grows... that we ain't exist
The illusion grows... that we ain't exist
Everybody's trying to get out!
Can you help?
How far can you go!
I can't take it anymore! I can't take it anymore! [?]
