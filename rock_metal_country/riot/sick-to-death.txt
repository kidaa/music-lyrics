I will fuck the system!
I'm sick to death like I've never been sick before!
I'm sick to death like I've never been sick before!
Sick to death! sick to death! sick to death!
I'm sick to death like I've never been sick before!
I wanna destroy!
When you touch me I wanna cut you
And you suck for more!
I could die for you when you put lipstick on my brain!
Drving through the night...
Get caught up in an endless fight!
I wanna be the mover to real anarchy!
Burn Berlin burn! Burn Berlin burn! x3
I'm sick to death like I've never been sick before!
I'm sick to death like I've never been sick before!
Sick to death! Sick to death! Sick to death!
I'm sick to death like I've never been sick before!
Please, let's just go home now
OK? Let's go
Don't do this. Please!
Nation against nation!
Nobody speaks up but we are laughing!
Nationalism against nationalism!
Burn Berlin burn!
As we got bigger the others get weaker!
Fuck a 1,000,000 trendy hardcore members!
Never talk! Always listen!
I won't be afraid of the new time!
Burn Berlin burn! Burn Berlin burn! x4
I'm sick to death like I've never been sick before!
I'm sick to death! I'm sick to death!
I'm sick to death like I've never been sick before!
I'm sick to death like I've never been sick before!
Sick to death! Sick to death!
Sick to death! Sick to death!
I'm sick to death like I've never been sick before!
I'm sick to death. I'm sick to death
I'm sick to death. I'm sick to death
You can't stop me! You can't stop me!
You can't stop me! You can't stop me!
Sick to death. Sick to death
I'm sick to death like I've never been sick before!
