Is this the future? Is this the future?
Is this the future of war? Is this the future of war?
Is this the future of war? 
The future of war! The future of war! The future of war!
Come on down to the end of the future...
We not gonna make it another day
Fighting the fight we have to fight!
You not gonna make me run away!
A white moon is shining down on me...
Where do we belong? Where do we belong?
Punk for money, piss for gold
Nothing ain't what it used to be!
I don't fear the live I wanna live
I don't fear the nothing I have to see:
The future of war! The future of war! x3
We never talked a revolution
We never played the cliche!
That was you having old images in your head!
We do not need to provoke anyone...It's just a waste of time
Two minutes before action...
Check my card - It's O.K.
Check my soul and throw it away!
Crack my life and you gonna die!
I saw his eyes...
A pose like this at midnight!
It's obvious that capitalism has failed!
This is the future...
The future of war! The future of war!
The future of war! It's like a heatwave burning through my soul!
The future of war! The future of war! 
The future of war! The future of war! 
War! War! War! War! War! War! War!
The future is war!
