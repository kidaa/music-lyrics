Test the world ... United colours
I told myself I wasn't about to give up! 
What time is it? It doesn't matter anymore!
I watch the sea through my colour tv - It's all over now
But I knew that for me throwing myself 
Into the world of helplines, charities, clinics, socialworkers
Doctors, nurses and specialists was not the answer
But there are 1,000,000 different ways of living with it!
I partied harder than ever before 
All night, every night, every second, every minute and tonight ...
Enjoy Everything!
I had been blind and I'm blind today!
One last chapter and another plane awaits us ... I feel in love
