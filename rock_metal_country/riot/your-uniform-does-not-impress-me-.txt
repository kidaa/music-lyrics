Freeze! I said freeze! Stop moving!
Freeze! I said freeze! Stop moving until I kill you...
You don't scare me! x3
I said you don't scare me! 
You don't scare me! x4
You think you can look down on me
Pointing your fucking gun at me
With your fucking magazine!
But yeah we both what we gonna do...
When you come down
We'll fuck you to the ground!
The feeling everything will be wiped away
And even if you dig a fainted society...
Marching along representing what you do
I'd rather crush my head in and
Fuck your rules!
Your uniform does not impress me!
Your uniform does not impress me...
Cast my shadow, break my mind
Cut my tounge and you'll see
What you'll find!
I don't fear the truth anymore!
I won't believe the police
Forcing shit on me!
You're like a parasite!
I was born at the end of disruption...
Your corrupted smile 
I don't take it anymore! I never did!
Fuck you! Wait when we come for you!
The soulless suppression!
Protect the peace, oh yeah, ya gun piece!
Fuck you gangsta's
With uniforms and dumb beast
Throw me on the wall slowly we brawl
Know me not at all - Stop!
Show me who fall it's me and ya'll
Hold me on the floor - What!
Your uniform does not impress me!
Your uniform does not impress me!
Your technology never scared me! 
Your uniform does not impress me!
Disconnected, lost and I don't feel free
I walked through the streets of death
Suppression's coming at me
I won't detect the fact 
That I couldn't choose from
Just another totalitarian regime!
I perform human's history as a pose
Supposed to be... That's how it goes
My future died years ago
A digital concentration camp - That's how I feel!
You don't impress me - Fucker!
What you want? Scare me? Fuck you!
Your uniform does not impress me! x3
Your uniform does not impress me at all!
Your uniform does not impress me! x3
You don't scare me! You don't scare me! x3
Why you looking at me? What did I do?
Is there a problem that you have here with my crew?
I never did nothing to your family
So why you mad at me?
Is it because I don't treat you like my majesty?
Why you looking at me? What did I do?
Is there a problem that you have with my Arsonist's crew?
Do you want me to kill your family?
Then don't be mad at me
Is it because I don't treat you like my fucking majesty?
Or that I ain't quiet pissed off cause
We don't buy it - Don't try it!
Don't try it you'll die quick mutha...
