Get up while you can! Get up!
They try to knock us to the ground! Sell out! Sell out! Push us around!
Watch your back - here comes the incredible!
The change for future is makin' noise in my head!
The bloodsuckers keep tryin' on
They do me in! They do me in!
I always wanted to see the end of the world... A thousand silverpearls
Crack down my brain!
The city's covered by dark shadows not too late to give your blood away!
You're in control of being under control!
The rules are clear - You have no fear!
Get up while you can! Get up!
Your times are never changnig and you're gonna be suprised!
Always do what others do!
They want you to compromise!
I stand by the fire and I'm not satisfied
Death takes place like lightning and nothing's ever the same again!
Get up while you can! Get up!
If you're just here to consume the new hippness - forget it!
Everything's still the same!
Global changes have been made but the enemies stayed!
Get up! Get up! Get up!
Get up while you can! Get up!
