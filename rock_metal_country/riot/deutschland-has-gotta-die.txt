Deutschland has gotta die! eins, zwei, drei, vier!
Wake up! Wake up! Get off your knees...
Where will the West strike next?
The war is still between East and West...
Money talks! Money! You're so bored and sick!
Lets burn Germany!
Building up economy of dead bodies! That's what they want!
We react very strongly to tranquilizers you know...
I need a diversion for a silent escape! Harder! Faster!
You know what they're after
You haven't suffered the same as I have!
Senseless neverending terror!
We make em nervous... We make em nervous! x3
Deutschland has gotta die!
Wake up! Wake up! Get off your spleen!
What will the West strike next?
The war is still between East and West... 
Money talks! Money knows!
You're so bored and sick!
Let's burn Deutschland!
The bloody wankers tried to pull us down...
Blow'em up! Blow'em up!
The bloody wankers try to pull us down but
We're gonna smash them in! x4
The time is right to fight!
