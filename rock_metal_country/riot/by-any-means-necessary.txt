By any means necessary!
Come on!
By any means necessary!
I can't hear you!
By any means necessary!
Come on!
By any means necessary! x4
Come on, come on, come on!
By any means necessary!
By any means necessary!
We are the Atari Teenage Riot 
And this ones called 'By Any Means Necessary'
So are you ready? Yeah!
Are you ready? Yeah!
I can't hear you! Yeah!
How many people like to see you dying
For no other reason than this?
This can't be fought in a fair way!
And if you agree - raise your fist!
Illegal protest for the rest of us!
I go fight cause it's the best for us!
I'm staring at the TV like it makes no sense!
Your changing definitions like it's self-defense!
By any means necessary! By any means necessary!
I can't hear you!
By any means necessary!
And you call that revolution!
They consume our lives like its and advert on TV!
They sell us a future that we ain't going to see!
Moral jugements will not do it - they ain't not gonna do!
You better turn it off and fucking screw 'em!
By any means necessary! x5
