I lit a candle in your honor today
Prayed for forgiveness for the things that I said
And now I wake up and see I was wrong
All those years wasted / now come and gone
How many years have I been this way
The lines grow deeper / time fades away
Now etched in stone don't have the strength anymore
To break down these walls again
I lit a candle In Your Honor today
Everything will come around again
And you never know that maybe someday
Everything will come around again
Now I see you on the other side
Sunshine raining down upon your face
You look so beautiful that place where you live
You walk among your dreams we talked about
So I stand here and I stare
In my garden of neglect
Never noticed it before
That it's winter all the time
Was too busy staring at
Your garden that you grew in time
I can see it took a lot of years
Your colors fill my mind
I lit a candle In Your Honor today
Everything will come around again
And you never know that maybe someday
Everything will come around again
Even though the years keep passing / I reflect
About the one I truly loved and pushed away
Suddenly I stop and feel
That winter rain I know so well
And close my eyes
Wish you all the best
And you never know
I lit a candle In Your Honor today
Everything will come around
And you never know that maybe someday
Everything will come around
I lit a candle In Your Honor today
Prayed for forgiveness for the things that I said
And you never know that maybe someday
