Dokken, Lynch
When I wake in the morning
I'm on the telephone
And I try to talk to ya
They say you're not home
Way back in the background
I hear you callin' my name
You say you don't wanna talk to me
You've had enough of me
Now I'm back in the streets
I've got nothing to lose
Just leave me alone
Don't call me no more
And I'm back in the streets
Now that you told me to go
Just leave me alone
Don't call me no more
And I'm out on the corner
I hear the sirens wails
You know they're coming to get me
Yeah, they'll take me to jail
Well, I can't stay out of trouble
Since you let me go
Now I'm back on the streets
I got nothing to lose
Now I'm back on the streets
Like you told me to go   
Just leave me alone
Don't call me no more
And I'm back in the streets
Now that you told me to go
Just leave me alone
Don't call me no more
I'm out on the corner
I hear the sirens wail
And they're coming to get me
And they'll take me to jail 
Well, I can't stay out of trouble
Since you let me go
Now I'm back on the streets
I got nothing to lose
Now I'm back in the streets
Like you told me to go
Just leave me alone
Don't call me no more
Now I'm back in the streets
Now that you told me to go
Just leave me alone
Don't call me no more
Now I'm back on the streets
And I'm back in the streets
Don't call me no more
