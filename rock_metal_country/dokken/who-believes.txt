Tried to go to sleep last night
But too many things were in my head
Then the sun began to rise
Still I haven't gone to bed
Why do all these questions dance around inside my head
All I want to do is close my eyes and go to bed
Let tomorrow bring the answers that I need instead
And let it go / let it go
Is there anybody Who Believes
That the questions and the answers will come easily
And this sadness that I felt will finally set me free
Set me free / set me free
Hope that I can sleep tonight
Close my eyes and slip away
Dream about some other place
Where the sun shines in my head
Out of all the people in my life I love you more
And I hope that time will find a way to make it sure
That we stay one and the same
Is there anybody Who Believes
That the questions and the answers will come easily
And this sadness that I felt will finally set me free
Set me free - Set me free
You're the only person in my life
And I hope that time will find a way to make it right
And whatever happens you will know
I love you more
Is there anybody Who Believes
That the questions and the answers will come easily
And this sadness that I felt will finally set me free
