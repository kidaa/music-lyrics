All my friends think it's their appointed duty
They keep tryin to tell me
That you just want to use me.
But my answer
To all that use me stuff
I want to spread the news, that if it feels this good gettin used
Will you just keep on using me
Until you use me up.

My brother, he sit me right down and he talked to me
And he told me he thought I ought to not let you just fuck on me.
And I know, I know that my brother he meant well
But I just don't know what's really true.
And I said oh brother if you only knew
You'd be wishin you were in my shoes.
So keep on using me, keep on using me
Until you use me up.

It's really true it's really true, you really do you really do
You really do abuse me.
You get me in a crowd of high-class people
And then you gotta act all rude to me.

I want to spread the news, that if it feels this good gettin used
Will you just keep on using me, keep on using me
Until you use me up.
