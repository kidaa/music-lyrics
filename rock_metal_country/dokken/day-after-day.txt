Dokken, Lynch
Day after day
You always break my heart
I can't take no more
From you
So I'll go far away
Won't see me no more
I'll just realize
You're not the one for me
You don't care for me
But I can't stop caring for you
You don't love me
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
Waited for so long
For you to love me too
I can't take no more
This time I'm through
So I'll go far away
Won't see me no more
I'll just realize
You're not the one
You don't care for me
But I can't stop caring for you
You don't love me
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
You don't care for me
But I can't stop caring for you
You don't love me
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
