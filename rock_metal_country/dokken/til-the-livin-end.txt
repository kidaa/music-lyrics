It's too late to tell me you're sorry
It's too late to walk out the door
Last time, last time you left broken hearted
Only to come back for more
I'm not with you for love
You'll be back on your knees again
Til the livin' end
When will it ever end
Til the livin' end
You know I can't wait
Can't wait, til the livin' end
It was you that wanted affection
It was you and all of your lies
This time, this time I'm changing direction
Changing the look in your eyes
I'm not with you for love
You'll be back on your knees again
Til the livin' end
When will it ever end
Til the livin' end
You know I can't wait
Can't wait, til the livin' end
Got no hope for the future
When you live in the past
Not gonna wait for tomorrow
Can't wait, til the livin' end
Til the livin' end
When will it ever end
Til the livin' end
You know I can't wait
Can't wait, til the livin' end
Can't wait, til the livin' end
Can't wait, til the livin' end
Can't wait, til the livin' end
