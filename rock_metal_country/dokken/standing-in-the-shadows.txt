Dokken, Lynch, Pilson
He was a desparate man
They couldn't understand
He wanted more from life
It was his one device
Yeah, he fell tried and hung
When the lights were low
Yeah it was in his eyes
And it was no surprise
Through the streets at night
He's smiling like no other
As he paid again
Look to find another
Standing in the shadows
Watching the world go by
Standing in the shadows
He was looking
Looking for a place to hide
He felt this way before
And knew he wanted more
He knew the dawn would come
And he'd be on the run
But still they drove him on
Like a loaded gun
His time was running out
And he realized that he'd been here before
Like a scream in the night
For his crime they showed no pity
Even though they'd done the same
It's the way of life in the city
Standing in the shadows
Watching the world go by
Standing in the shadows
He was looking
Looking for a place to hide
Lock your doors
Standing in the shadows
Watching the world go by
He was standing in the shadows
Looking
Looking for a place
Standing in the shadows
He was standing in the shadows
Watching the world
Standing in the shadows
Standing in the shadows
He was standing in the shadows
Standing in the shadows
Standing in the shadows
