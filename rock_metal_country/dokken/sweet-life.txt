Take me along to a place I remember
where all of my friends - now they're gone forever
how they love the sweet life
I'm destined to run with the Holy
I must wait
dying inside ever slowly
I'll be on my way
I saw the flame of the candle burning down so low
I danced with my friends 'til they had to go
my spirit stayed -give me no relief
my spirit stayed -gave me no release
how they loved the sweet life
I'm destined to run with the Holy
I must wait
dying inside ever slowly
I'll be on my way
Sitting alone in a darkened room
trail of smoke and warn out mind
mister depression overstayed his welcome
something inside took me away
Take me along to a place I remember
all of my friends -thought I knew them better
how they loved the sweet life
