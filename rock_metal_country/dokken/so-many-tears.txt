Dokken, Lynch, Pilson
I, yeah, I'm leaving today
Sorry is not enough
Like so many things
We were lost forever
I can't turn the hands of time
Back to the way it was
I can only go on
To find a better road
I can't stop you now
My back's against the wall
There's only so many tears you can cry
There's only so many ways you can say goodbye
There's only so many tears you can cry
There's only so many ways you can say goodbye
So many tears you can cry
You had such a foolish heart
You thought it would last forever
But you were the one
That brought it to an end
Now I'm standing in the rain
'Cause I wasn't there for you
Such a fool was I
It should have never been
I couldn't stop you now
My back's against the wall
There's only so many tears you can cry
There's only so many ways you can say goodbye
There's only so many tears you can cry
There's only so many ways you can say goodbye
So many tears 
So many tears
Only so many tears you can cry
You can't change the world
Place the blame on me
Life goes on without you
There's nothing left for me
I can't change the world
Place the blame on me
Life goes on without you
And now at last I see
There's only so many tears you can cry
There's only so many ways you can say goodbye
Only so many tears you can cry
There's only so many ways you can say goodbye
I can't take anymore
So mnay tears
Life goes on without you
So many tears
There's nothing left for me
So many tears
And now we're lost forever
So many tears
