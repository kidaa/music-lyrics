Dokken, White
In one man's mind, we could have anything
In one man's life, we could lose everything
Look to the sky to what the future would bring to me
'Cause when it's all said and done
Who's gonna put away the gun
So give it up
Stop all you fighting, yeah, yeah,
So, give it up
It's my world
We're dancing with destruction
Just one more chance knocks opportunity
But it won't wait if we don't find the key
Listen to me, I've had enough of the sorrow and pain
'Cause when it's all said and done
Who's gonna put away the gun
So give it up
Stop all you fighting, yeah, yeah,
So, give it up
It's my world
Are we too blind to see Don't fuck it up for me
