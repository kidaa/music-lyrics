Dokken, Lynch, Pilson
There seems no justice 
When you fall in lve
It gives you blindness 
When you are the one
The one that's hurting 
'Cause they got the gun
There seems no justice 
When you fall in love
Save me
Dont let me fall
Heaven sent
I heard the call
Stop me
Dont let me go
Touch my heart
Then let me know
Heaven sent
Thought you would set me
Heaven sent
Thought it could never be
Heaven sent
If I had only seen
That you were burning the fire in me
You took passion
Most of my soul
But I will come back baby
Stronger than before
Take my feelings
Leave me in pain
I will forget you
One of these days
Stop me
From feeling this way
Heaven sent
You drive me insane
Hold me
Dont let me go
Touch me now
Then let me know
Heaven sent
Thougth you would set me free
Heaven sent
Thought it could never be
Heaven sent
If I had only seen
That you were burning the fire in me
Passion burned
I felt the fire
Touch my soul
I felt desire
Now I see
Where we went wrong
Am I to blame
I've fallen in love
Passion burned
I felt the fire
Touch my soul
I felt desire
Now I see
Where we went wrong
Heaven sent
But you're not the one
Heaven sent
Thought you would set me free
Heaven sent
Thought it could never be
Passion burned 
I felt the fire
Heaven sent but baby you're not the one
Heaven sent
Heaven sent
I felt the fire
Heaven sent
Heaven sent
Heaven sent
Hevaen sent but baby you're not the one
