Lynch, Brown, Dokken, Pilson
When the sun fades to black and the night has come
There's a will to survive that's ruled by the gun
There's a fear in your eyes and a dream that was lost
There's a hand of fate let you die on the cross
You never really had a chance
Die Mauer muss weg
Tear it down
All of your life grows cold
When you're lost behind the wall
All of the dreams you've ever known
Will be lost behind the wall
Misfortune can hide the freedom to choose
The strong will survive and there's no win or lose
There's reason to fight but no way to cope
It's better to die than to live without hope
You never really had a chance
Die Mauer muss weg
Tear it down
All of your life grows cold
When you're lost behind the wall
All of the dreams you've ever known
Will be lost behind the wall
Lost behind
All of your life grows cold
When you're lost behind the wall
All of the dreams you've ever known
Will be lost behind the wall
All of your life grows cold
When you're lost behind the wall
All of the dreams you've ever known
Will be lost behind the wall
Lost behind the wall
Lost behind the wall
