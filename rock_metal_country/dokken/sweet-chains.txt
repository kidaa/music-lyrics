Dokken
Sun shine on me
You were my sunflower, yeah
Been a long cold winter
Summer's come and gone
Your words were so bitter
My resurrection's just begun
Dead of winter
No pain only borrowed
You drink from my soul
You'll taste bitter sorrow
	They say the sun won't shine
	Where I'm going
	It's too late to change my mind
	It's over
[Sweet chains]
[Sweet chains]
You were the one that took me there
All the king's horses
And all the king's men
Never gonna put my love
Back into your arms again
	They say the sun won't shine
	Where I'm going
	The bitter sorrow chimes
[Sweet chains]
[Sweet chains]
[Sweet chains]
[Sweet chains]
You were the one that took me there
Tears of joy for a soul that had died
A soul, kept for so long in fear of it's passing
So would he or at least, so would he have believed
Revelation came late and unexpected
The soul dies only to be reborn a birth of pain and peace
The pain of knowing the hurt it had brought to so many
Revelation...
The peace of life unfolding through eyes anew
A chance of finding the truth
Or at least, so would we have believed
