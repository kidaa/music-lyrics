Dokken, Pilson
Let go of your mind
And see what there is to see
It can be real
Not just a fantasy
Open your eyes
And leave the world behind
Open your mind
Come along for the ride
    Do what you want to do
    Be what you want to be
    Do what you want to do
    It's just a short trip from reality
Chorus
    I'm on the inside
    Looking outside
    I'm on the inside looking out
    I'm going somewhere
    Feeling nowhere
    I'm on the inside looking out
I can't be free
Till I know what free is
I can't be me
Till I know who I am
Do you believe
There's more than what you see
All that we need
Is some free association
    Painted pictures in a room of glass
    Looking throught the floor above
    Don't know what has brought me to this place
    Ectasy confused by love
Chorus 2
    I'm on the inside
    In the dark so long
    What's been going on
    Come and look inside my mind
Looking outside
It's up to you
You can make the changes
You make your dreams come true
What will you do if you don't start
Rearranging the things that you do
It's all up to you
Chorus 3
