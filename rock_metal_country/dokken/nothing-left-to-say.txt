Dokken, Pilson
There were days when we were closer
You were all I had
Lost a soul, but not forgotten
Had to give it back
     Lost, feeling so lost
     No more tears can we shed
     And time slipping through our minds
     Wishing I could forget
Chorus
    Guess there's nothing left to say
    Guess there's nothing left to say
      Nothing left to say
    When there's nothing left
Memories of the days now passing
Still they come and go
Visions of a word we tried to say
We didn't know, we were
     Lost, feeling so lost
     No more tears can we shed
     And time, slipping through our minds
    Wishing I could forget
Chorus
     Guess there's nothing left to say
     Guess there's nothing left to say
        Nothing left to say
     Guess there's nothing left to say
        Nothing left to say
      When there's nothing left
There were other days
When I believed we'd make it through
I was such a fool
For the way it used to be
Now it's time to set you free
Chorus
     Guess there's nothing left to say
     Guess there's nothing left to say
     When there's nothing left
