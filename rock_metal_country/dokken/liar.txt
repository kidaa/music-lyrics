Dokken
Liar
Deceiver
Mistreater
You, you are the one I wanna know
Oh, I gotta go
I gotta get away from here
'Cause you, you're not the one
I realize
Oh, when will I know
Waiting for the last show
When you tell me lies
It's in your eyes
You're a liar
You are
You're a liar
Wait
Always alone
You never would come home
So, I gotta go
I gotta get away from here
Oh, when will I know
Waiting for the last show
When you tell me lies
It's in your eyes
It's in your eyes
It's in your eyes
Liar
Sinner
You, you're not the one
You're a liar
Oh, when will I know
Waiting for the last show
When you tell me lies
It's in your eyes
It's in your eyes
It's in your eyes
Liar
