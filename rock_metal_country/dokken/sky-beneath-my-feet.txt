So -- so incomplete
we look into the world -- find no peace
once -- it seemed serene
we'd be forever young and so it seemed
what does it mean -- I find no answers
kept in a dream -- soft colored layers
I see myself through the looking glass
a shade of gray
a shade of black
no ups or downs
just in betweens
The gentle rain begins to fall
come with me and see it all
Rise above the world upon my wings
I was sleeping with the
sky beneath my feet
Now I drift endless and free
with the wind that carries me
what does it mean -- what does it matter
kept in a dream with soft colored layers
The gentle rain begins to fall
come with me and see it all
Rise above the world 
upon my wings
I was sleeping with the
sky beneath my feet
