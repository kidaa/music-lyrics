Lynch, Dokken
I talk with you
I think of her
It always turns out the same
I changed my mind
Then I'm not sure
Love's got me shackled in chains
Win or lose
We've lit the fuse
I've lost control
Then you explore my soul
Chorus
In the middle
Of love
In the middle
Of love
Torn apart
Right from the start
Is it too late to be true?
Now things have changed
We're not the same
I've lost control
Then you explore my soul
Repeat Chorus
Repeat Chorus
Solo
Repeat Chorus
Repeat Chorus
In the middle
I lose control
In the middle
I lose my mind as well
In the middle
Everyday
In the middle
Love's got me chained
Repeat Chorus and fade
