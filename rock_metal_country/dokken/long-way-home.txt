Dokken, Pilson, Lynch
Sitting in the crossfire all alone
Waiting for a world to show the way
Tried to find a rose without a thorn
Such a foolish notion fades away
	[If it's all] in my mind
	Then why does it feel
	Like there isn't any time
Walk the road [Follow the madness]
Of someone's path
Search for self [Well it doesn't mean you're wrong]
If you can
'Cause it's gonna be ['Cause it's gonna be]
A long way home
Wandering through the maze of all the fears
In the mind it makes no sense at all
Tell me not what I'm supposed to do
Crucify you christ without my cross
	If it's all in my mind
	Then why does it feel
	Like I'm running out of time
Walk the road [Follow the madness]
Of someone's path
Search for self [Well it doesn't mean you're wrong]
If you can
'Cause it's gonna be ['Cause it's gonna be]
A long way home
	Mythical past
	Future behind me, shattered
	I could not be
	Someone beside
	Take back my soul, my soul
Walk the road [Follow the madness]
Of someone's path
Search for self [Well it doesn't mean you're wrong]
If you can
'Cause it's gonna be
A long way home
