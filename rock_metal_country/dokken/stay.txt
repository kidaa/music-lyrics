Dokken, Brown
Girl, when I think of you, you know it makes me sad
And I wonder, wonder about what we had
Say we're over baby T
That we're through
Can't believe it say that it's not true
Please believe me when I say I do 
I'm still loving you,loving you
loving you
CHORUS:
Won't you stay
Can't you see my love is waiting here
Darling, stay
Don't you leave me drowning in my tears
Do ya love me baby let me know
Show your feelings
'Cause I gotta know
Am I wasting my time, am I being a fool 
For loving you, loving you
Every night your name is on my lips
I feel your body at my fingertips
Please beleive me when I say I do 
Am I a fool?
CHORUS
BRIDGE
Won't you touch me and stay for awhile
I need you so badly
Darling...
Won't you stay
