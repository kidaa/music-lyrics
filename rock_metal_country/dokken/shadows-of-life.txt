Dokken, Pilson
Tale of woe open up my eyes
Keeping me from the other side
Satisfy what my soul believes
If it could only see
	On a red sky
	In a green sea
	On a black night
	I fell to my knees
Save it for the innocent
Save it for the cruel
And leave it in the shadows of life
On a ship full of hopes and dreams
Took a trip down to misery
Realized that I'd been before
I found it hard to believe
	On a red sky
	In a green sea
	On a black night
	I fell to my knees
Save it for the innocent
Save it for the cruel
And leave it in the shadows of life
Read between the lines
These are angry times
Save it for the innocent
Save it for the cruel
And leave it in the shadows of life
