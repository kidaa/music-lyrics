Pilson, Lynch, Dokken, Brown
I'm the one that loves you
I'm the one that cared
Night comes and I think of you alone
We've changed
Love remains
So give me one more chance
I'll wait another day
Until there's nothing
Stop fighting love
Baby I just want to know the reaosn why
Stop fighting love
Don't say goodbye
And you'll be back in my arms again
I can make it better
I can make it right
If only you could try and see the light
Someday
Someway 
I'm gonna make you see
That I've paid 
For my mistakes
Until there's nothing
Stop fighting love
Baby I just want to know the reason why
Stop fighting love
Don't say goodbye
Stop fighting love
When you gonna tell me, show me you're right
Stop fighting love
Don't say goodbye
And you'll be back in my arms again
I let your lust for love excite me
You took my heart instead
And now there's nothing
Stop fighting love
Well I just want to know the reason why
Stop fighting love
Don't say goodbye
Stop fighting love
Baby there's no reason why
Stop fighting love
Don't say goodbye
And you'll be back in my arms again
Stop fighting--stop fighting love
Stop fighting--stop fighting love
Stop fighting--stop fighting love
