There's a girl next door with a leather coat
And she looks pretty good to me
My friends all say that you better watch out
There's a side of her you haven't seen
Still I took a ride / it was late at night
We were cruising along on her motorbike
Everything was right / til Crazy Mary went down
So let me tell you about Mary
[Mary] Crazy Mary Goes Round
Let me tell you about Mary
[Mary] Crazy Mary Goes Round and round
Round and round
Called my doctor and I tried to explain
Cuz it didn't make sense to me
Seven different sides and I've seen them all
One for everyday of the week
She gave me a scare / she was combing her hair
A long conversation there was nobody there
Does anybody know / what Mary's talking about
So let me tell you about Mary
[Mary] Crazy Mary Goes Round
Let me tell you about Mary
[Mary] Crazy Mary Goes Round
So let me tell you about Mary
[Mary] Crazy Mary Goes Round and round
Round and round
[Mary] Crazy Mary Goes Round
Funny thing about Mary
[Mary] Crazy Mary Goes Round and round
Round and round
Round and round
