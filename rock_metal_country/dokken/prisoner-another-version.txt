Lynch, Pilson, Brown
It wasn't just your innocence
No, It wasn't temptation 
It was just your own way
Of placing the blame on me
Stop thinking that it's all the name
You keep trading your love for pain
Someday her answer will come
'Cause there ain't no way to escape
Baby I'm a prisoner
Chained by love
It's so easy to see
I can never be free
I'm a prisoner
Chained by love 
The answer for your lonliness
Is only frustration
So you gave it all away
By placing the blame on me
Remember how it used to be
Your lies won't ----- that easily
Something's wrong
Why can't you see
There ain't no way to escape
Baby I'm a prisoner
Chained by love
It's so easy to see
I can never be free
I'm a Prisoner 
Chained by love
Chained by love
It's so easy to see
I can never be free
I'm a Prisoner 
Chained by love
---- and misery
'Cause I'm a prisoner
Did my time so let me be
Let me go
Your holding me
Someday her answer will come, you wait 
Something's wrong
Why can't you see
That there ain't no way to escape
Escape
Baby I'm a prisoner
Chained by love
It's so easy to see
I can never be free
I'm a Prisoner 
Chained by love
Chained by love
It's so easy to see
I can never be free
I'm a Prisoner 
Chained by love
Chained by love
It's so easy to see
I can never be free
I'm a prisoner
Chained by love
