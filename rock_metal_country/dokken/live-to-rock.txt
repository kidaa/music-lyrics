Lynch, Crouchier, Dokken
Run out of breath
And I feel I'm moving too slow
Backwards and forwards
I don't know which way I should go
There's a solution 
To make all your feelings alright
The music's here waiting 
So come on and get it tonight
Live to rock
Rock to live
It's all you got when
You're down on the skids
Live to rock
Rock to live
One way or another
Survive until the end 
Over and under
I'm feeling the thunder take hold
Feeling it flow through my veins
Rock will never get old
There's a solution 
To make all your feelings alright
The music's here waiting
So come on and get it tonight
Live to rock
Rock to live
It's all you got when 
You're down on the skids
Live to rock
Rock to live
One way or another
Survive until the end
Live to rock
Rock to live
It's all you got when
You're down on the skids, yeah
Live to rock
Rock to live
One way or another
Survive until the end
Live to rock
Rock to live
Til the end
Til the end
Til the end
Live to rock
Rock to live
