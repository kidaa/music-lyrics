Overtake me -- seize
the vision through my eyes
and reinstate me --
bathe me in your sunlight
until I know -- until I know
constant motion -- kept me standing still
howling silence -- penetrate
and break my will
so re-embrace me -- the release
me one more time
until I know -- until I know
so re-embrace me -- the release
me one more time
until I know -- until I know
