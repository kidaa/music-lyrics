Dokken, Lynch, Brown
Felony
What you do to me
It's just like mruder
In the first degree
You're killing my heart
It's a felony
Felony
In tight blue jeans
I did know
She was so sweet
You're killing my heart
It's a felony
I've been shot down
By a heart so cruel
You're laughing
You take me for a fool
I've been struck down
Left lying in the dirt
I never knew
How much love could hurt
You're killing my heart
It's a felony
So come on baby
What you gonna do
I can't help myself
Now it's up to you
Felony
What you do to me
It's just like murder
In the first degree
You're killing my heart
It's a felony
What you do to me
Felony
What you do to me
