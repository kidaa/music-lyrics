One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
Two can be as bad as one
It's the loneliest number since the number one-uh
No is the saddest experience that you'll ever know
Yes it's the saddest experience you'll ever know
Cuz one is the loneliest number / that you'll ever do
One is the loneliest number / wouldn't work for two
One is the loneliest number
One is the loneliest number
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
It's just no good anymore since you went away
Now I spend my time / making rhymes of yesterday
One is the loneliest number
One is the loneliest number
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
It's just no good anymore since you went away
[Number] One is the loneliest number
[Number] One is the loneliest number
[Number] One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
[Number] One is the loneliest number
[Number] One is the loneliest number
[Number] One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
