Told you I had to leave, I had my reasons
I said that it hurt to stay, the way that I'm feelin'
It's not love
That left you standin'
It's not love
That left you cold
It's not love
Misunderstandin'
Only a mistake
There's nothing left to take
Why, baby, why did you make me let you go
And leave you so lonely
Why, baby, why did you have to hold on
You know it's not love anymore
Gave you your last chance but you didn't believe me
You can't keep me satisfied, the way that you treat me 
It's not love
That left you standin'
It's not love
That left you cold
It's not love
Misunderstandin'
Only a mistake
There's nothing left to take
Why, baby, why did you make me let you go
And leave you so lonely
Why, baby, why, stop playing with my heart
I told you
It's not love
Telling you to be this way
It's not love
Sayin' you can never change
It's not love
When I told you
Is he putting you down
Down, down, down
