Seeing no one 
touching something
fingers reaching out
Senses burning
all from learning
no ones sees 
the colors in my mind
Silent darkness speaks my name -
everything changes yet stays the same
like darkness into day
I know what is to come
long days without sun
CHORUS
I feel
I feel
Slowly moving 
endless motion
floating forward now
soaring higher
drifting nowhere
I felt that I was somewhere else
Total blindness still remains
everyone changes - I stay the same
the hours slip away
I'll feel this pain no more
my future waits outside the door
CHORUS
I feel - I feel crystallized - piece of time
I feel
The sun is shining over me
warming my senses 
I make a plea
I'm guilty of feeling 
so why is it so hard to see
CHORUS
I feel - I feel crystallized - piece of time
I feel - I feel
blood stained eyes - open wide
I feel
