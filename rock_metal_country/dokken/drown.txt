I been left in the crossfire / sacrificed to love and hate
Out of ammunition to regain my mental state
I found myself adrift upon an endless sea
Of lies and bitterness / horizon out of reach
I see the starts that shine / Reflection in the waves
I need to find that distant shore
Before I Drown
Slip beneath the waves and Drown
Takes me to my grave
Of love and heartache / there's got to be a way
That I can save myself before I Drown
Too much conversation can erode our little minds
My emancipation comes with solitude at night
As the world sleeps / I contemplate all that's been done
I profess no innocence / I've held - held that smoking gun
I found myself atop a sea of ocean blue
Cast from a world that left me too
To Drown
Slip beneath the waves and Drown
Takes me to my grave
Of love and heartache / there's got to be a way
That I can save myself before I Drown
I'll Drown
Slip beneath the waves and Drown
Takes me to my grave
And Drown
From the pouring rain
Of love and heartache / there's got to be a way
I can save myself
Save myself Before I Drown
