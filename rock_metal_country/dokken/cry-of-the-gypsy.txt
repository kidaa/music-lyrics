Dokken, Pilson, Lynch
You say I'm a restless soul
I don't mind
If living this way is right
I guess I want to be wrong
You can say anything you like
Still it's my life
If I'm on the run
It's my freedom of choice
Sometimes I can't take anymore
I got that feeling
Don't wanna stay
Its got me reeling
You know what they say Hey
Must be the gypsy
The cry of the gypsy
Must be the gypsy
The cry of the gypsy
Must be the gypsy in me
Sometimes, yeah, I feel so alone
But I don't mind
As long as you don't close me in
Everything will be just fine
Don't tell me about society
Don't want to hear anymore
I got my own cross to bear
And its a heavy load
Sometimes I feel it
And I just wanna get out
Must be a reason
That I just wanna shout Hey
Must be the gypsy
The cry of the gypsy
Must be the gypsy
The cry of the gypsy
Must be the gypsy in me
The cry of the gypsy
It's the cry
Cry of the gypsy in me
Hey
The cry of the gypsy
Must be the gypsy
The cry of the gypsy
Must be the gypsy
The cry of the gypsy
Yeah I'm feeling it now
The cry of the gypsy
Yeah it's calling for me
The cry of the gypsy
Must be the cry of the gypsy
The cry of the gypsy
The cry..the cry of the gypsy
The cry of the gypsy
Must be the gypsy in me
