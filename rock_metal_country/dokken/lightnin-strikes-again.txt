The lights go down
You can feel it all around you
Like a razor's edge that cuts through the air
You can hear the sound
It's coming down like thunder
You don't have to tell me why
You don't have to care
When the lightnin' strike again
And the lights go down
And you might be near the end
When the lightnin' strikes again
You draw the line
And you leave it all behind you
You lost your mind and then you lose control
By the time
That you feel the lightnin' strike you
You know you've been holding back
You've got to let it go
