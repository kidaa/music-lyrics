You didn't see me, but I overheard
A short conversation was just a few words
A lie and a whisper, a knife in my back
The things you were saying lead me to believe
You want no part of me
Leave me go, turn and walk away, turn your back on me 
If you stay, there's just one thing that I've got to say
Just don't lie to me
Don't treat me like a fool
Just don't lie to me
Like the way you used to do
Voices that whisper, dark deep despair
Burns me like fire, these things that I hear
Leave me go, turn and walk away, turn your back on me
If you stay, there's just one thing that I've got to say
Just don't lie to me
Don't treat me like a fool
Just don't lie to me
Like the way you used to do
Tell me it's over, don't tell me you care
Don't wanna hear it no more
Don't say you love me, if the feeling's not there
Just turn and leave me, I want no part of you
Just don't lie to me
Don't treat me like a fool
Just don't lie to me
Like the way you used to do
Just don't lie to me
Don't treat me like a fool
Just don't lie to me
Like the way you used to do
Just don't lie to me
Or I'll be on my way
Just don't lie to me
I won't be back again
Just don't lie to me
Don't treat me like a fool
Just don't lie to me
Like the way you used to do
Just don't lie to me
