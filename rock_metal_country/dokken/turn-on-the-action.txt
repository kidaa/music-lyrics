Lyrics: Brown, Lynch, Pilson
     I'm like a wildcat at midnight
     I'm like a stick of dynamite
     Evil senses taking over me
     Gonna let the action steal the night

     Turn up the heat
     Turn down the lights action, action
     Turn up the heat
     Baby go all night

     Turn on the action
     Turn on the night
     Turn on the action
     Turn on the night

     I'm looking over my shoulder
     I'm running reckless thru the night
     Forever young not getting older
     Satisfaction guaranteed tonight

     Turn up the heat
     Turn down the lights action, action
     Turn up the heat
     Baby go all night

     Turn on the action
     Turn on the night
     Turn on the action
     Turn on the night
