wait for me behind
the walls behind the sky
revolution finds
the road to ease our minds
can we walk outside and
leave our fragile pride
within the holes forever
deeper we must hide
shattered pictures of
a moment lost in time
between the cracks in the ground
between the cracks in the ground
I see a painted face
through a colored haze
an enchanted place
its time to sail away
In my eyes I've lived a life
that's so surreal
my imagination questions what is real
shadows spinning in my mind
just like a wheel
between the cracks in the ground
between the cracks in the ground
passing through the doors
I stop to close them one by one
looking through the keyholes far behind
