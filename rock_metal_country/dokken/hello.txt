Liquid fused around my body
swimming in the night's black water
justifies a child's exsistance
innocence abounds within us
but what does it matter
Watch my hand turn shades of gray
feel my life's breath fade away
soon I'll walk through gates of steel
to a place not yet revealed
but what does it matter
Hello death, hello death
hello death -- how do you do?
I don't remember calling you
All I need is just a drink of water
help me Jesus -- try to ease my pain
all I need is just to drink your water
hello Mr. Death please go away
Here I go into the earth
and here I'll wait until my birth
I will rise again someday
tranquility will find a way
but what does it matter
Hello death, hello death
hello death -- how do you do?
I don't remember calling you
All I need is just a drink of water
help me Jesus -- try to ease my pain
all I need is just to drink your water
hello Mr. Death please go away
