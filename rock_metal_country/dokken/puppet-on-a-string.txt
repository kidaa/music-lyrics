Why do you -- Invade me
I beg you -- don't leave me
Don't trust you -- don't trust me
I stand here -- benignly
What is inside that's pushing me
We're all a puppet on a string
This wooden world is just like me
We're all puppets on a string  -- on a string
I hurt you -- you killed me
I love you -- you hated me
You gave in -- it thrilled me
You sex was -- fulfilling
What is inside that's pushing me
Like a puppet on a string
This wooden world is just like me
We're all puppets on a string  -- on a string
I hurt you -- you tortured me
I love you -- you hated me
You gave in -- it thrilled me
Your sex was fulfilling
I hurt you -- you cut me
Your painful emission of how you felt
How you felt -- how you felt
My ego -- could not take
What is inside that's pushing me
Like a puppet on a string
This wooden world is just like me
We're all puppets on a string  -- on a string
We're all puppets on a string
You buried me
You buried me on a string
