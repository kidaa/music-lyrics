Norum, Dokken
Does it seem that we're going nowhere again
Can it be that love has passed us by the way
Can't sy that we played the game so well
Are we to a point where time stands still
Nothing can save us now
If you only want to believe in fairy tales and dreams
If I'm not what you're looking for set me free
CHORUS:
Living a Lie, now that your love has run
Living a lie, now that you've come and gone
It's sad to think what we have wasted
Over and over trying to make you see
Feelings are not something you can play with
Maybe once, but never twice
Better listen to my advice
If your gonna belive in someone who still cares for you
If your wanna believe in fantasies say we're through
In my darkness I will find the light
Lone survivor, someone to save me
When I look back I think of all the years
Wasted on your love...it's over now
So if you wanna beleive in someone who still cares for you
If your wanna believe in fantasies Say we're through
CHORUS
Living a lie
Living a lie
Living a lie
