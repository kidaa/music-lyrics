Lyrics: Dokken, Pilson, Brown, Lynch
     The shootin's over
     The smoke is clear
     Another notch in my gun
     Another round of ammunition
     Before the damage is done

     She wanted this
     I gave her that
     She said she will
     I took good aim
     She felt no pain
     When I started moving in for the kill

     Cuz I've got bullets
     Bullets to spare
     I've got bullets- bullets to spare

     My barrel's ready
     My hand is steady
     Tonight I'm ready for fun
     I got my finger
     It's on the trigger
     Another night on the run

     She wanted this
     I gave her that
     She said she will
     I took good aim
     She felt no pain
     When I started moving in for the kill

     Cuz I've got bullets
     Bullets to spare
     I've got bullets- bullets to spare
