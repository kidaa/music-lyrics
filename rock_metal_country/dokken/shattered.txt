Lonely / why do I feel this way
If you're so in love with me / why do you stay away
Heartache / breaking down my pride
The closer that I get to you the more I hurt inside
Feeling I've been wrong about you
Try to justify
I'm feeling empty inside
I see the heartache you hide in your eyes
I'm feeling empty inside
Shattered
Shattered / trying to get to you
Left my heart in broken pieces / haven't been so true
Leave me / in my barren world
When I try to give you all I hear the cry of love
There's no words and there's no time for
All the reasons why
I'm feeling empty inside
I see the heartache you hide in your eyes
I'm feeling empty inside
Shattered
I'm feeling empty inside
I see the heartache you hide in your eyes
I'm feeling empty inside
Shattered
Spoken word: Yellow walls / I light another cigarette
Rainbow dreams crossing through my eyes
Shattered pictures in my mind
Love lost / lorn
