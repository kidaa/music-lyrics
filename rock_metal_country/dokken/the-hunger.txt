You gotta love like you've never been hurt
Work, like you don't need the money, sing, like nobody's listening,
Dance, like nobody's watching, love like you've never been hurt
From far I am, nearby I stand, in my eyes your tears, in my heart your fear

You gotta love like you've never been hurt
Live, like nobody dies, believe, like nobody lies,
Run like nobody waits, run like nobody

From far I am, nearby I stand, in my eyes your tears, in my heart your fear
Love like you've never been hurt
