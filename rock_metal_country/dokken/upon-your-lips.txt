There's no reason you can't understand me now
There's no point in living up among the clouds
Tiny innuendoes circling your mind
Come to find out you've been left so far
Left so far behind
And all the time you thought it's turning out so well
You turned your back on me
And wished me straight to hell
That's where I'll go if you want me to
I'll see you there
I'll see you there when your life is through
I'll see you there
Soaring higher now you're bound to come unglued
You're supported by a love that was untrue
Write your story on a single grain of sand
Heed the warning when you let go
Let go of my hand
A promised kiss upon your lips for not to tell
You turned your back on me
And wished me straight to hell
That's where I'll go if you want me to
I'll see you there
I'll see you there when your life is through
I'll see you there
So write your story on a single grain of sand
Heed the warning when you let go
Let go of my hand
A promised kiss upon your lips for not to tell
You turned your back on me
And wished me straight to hell
That's where I'll go if you want me to
I'll see you there
I'll see you there when your life is through
I'll see you there
That's where I'll go if you want me to
I won't care
I'll see you there when your life is through
I'll see you there
I'll see you there
