Lynch, Brown, Pilson
Oh yeah..
I stay up on the high until the morning
Stay in bed until day becomes light
I've been so refused
Even more confused
I wish I could make it right
Looks like a sleepless night coming my way
Yeah, I knew that I'd be feeling this way
On a sleepless night
Got a restless mind
On a sleepless night
I've been waiting for you
On a sleepless night
Gonna tell you one more time
You're all I need on a sleepless night
You got tired of the way you were feeling
Threw away your ball and chain
Your shot in the dark
Put a hole in my heart
Still I'm the one that's taking the blame
Looks like a sleepless night coming my way
Yeah, I knew that I'd be feeling this way
On a sleepless night
I got a restless mind
On a sleepless night
I've been waiting for you
On a sleepless night
Gonna tell you one more time
You're all I need on a sleepless night
On a sleepless night
Listen to the music
On a sleepless night
Try to leave your troubles all behind
On a sleepless night
Wide awake
Lying on the bed
Can't find no peace at mind
Because it's so hard to unwind
Looks like a sleepless nights coming my way
Yeah, I knew that I'd be feeling this way
On a sleepless night
Got a restless mind
On a sleepless night
I've been praying for you
On a sleepless night
Gonna tell you one more time
You're all I need on a sleepless night
On a sleepless night
On a sleepless night
