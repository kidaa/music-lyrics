Lyrics: Lynch, Pilson, Brown
     Desperate living- driving me mad
     Writings on the wall
     Crushed all our hopes and the dreams we once had 
     Just to watch them fall

     Tearing it up in the daytime
     Burning it down at night
     How long does it take
     To break the spell
     Straight to the top
     Tooth and Nail

     Last generation- reckless and free
     Up against the odds
     Toughts of revenge are going trough me 
     Fate lies in the cards

     Tearing it up in the daytime
     Burning it down at night
     How long does it take
     To break the spell
     Straight to the top
     Tooth and Nail

     Desperate living- trying to see
     Breaking all the rules
     Only the strongs are gonna be free
     From a world of fools

     Tooth and Nail
     Tooth and Nail
     Straight to the top
     Tooth and Nail
