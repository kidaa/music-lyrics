I was lost without you
I was sinking in a storm
I thought the world had left me
now I know that I was wrong
It's Resurrection Day
gonna leave it all behind
gonna clear my mind of you
gonna pave my own road
CHORUS
I don't mind -what you want
I don't mind when your
hounds begin to beg
I don't mind when you
kick the ones that fall
I don't mind - I don't mind at all
It's better to be lonely
than to live with all your pain
I was walking through the desert 
I was calling out your name
but I never got an answer
still I loved you just the same
the sun began to burn me
reminded me of all those days
CHORUS
I don't mind -what you want
I don't mind when your
hounds begin to beg
I don't mind when you
kick the ones that fall
I don't mind - I don't mind at all
When you leave me for another
I won't be calling out your name
now that burning sun is setting 
only one thing left to say
CHORUS
I don't mind -what you want
I don't mind when your
hounds begin to beg
I don't mind when you
kick the ones that fall
I don't mind - I don't mind
