Lyrics: Pilson, Lynch, Brown
     Every night is the same old thing
     Baby I tried, yeah I tried
     Let's put an end to this misery
     Baby I cried, yeah I cried

     So hot - stone cold, why'd you let me go

     You got a heartless heart
     Got a heart of stone
     You got a heartless heart
     And it's just gonna bring you down

     You tell me things that I know ain't true
     Baby you lied, yeah you lied
     I just wanted to be with you
     Baby I tried, yeah I tried

     You got a heartless heart of stone
     It's bringing me down- baby
     You had to play the only game you've known
     With my heart- with my heart- oh

     Every night is the same old thing
     Baby I tried, yeah I tried
     Let's put an end to this misery
     Baby I cried, yeah I cried
