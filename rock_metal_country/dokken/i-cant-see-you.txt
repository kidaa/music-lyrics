Dokken, Croucier
You keep me waitin'
Why I don't know
Seems like forever
You know the show
I wanna see you
Don't want it to end
But when I'm callin' 
You tell me again
Chorus
I can't see you anymore
I can't see you anymore
All my friends keep tellin' me, yeah
That I'm just a fool
But baby I can't help myself
I'm in love with you
Give me just one chance
And I'll make it right
Could be forever
Don't tell me tonight
Repeat Chorus
All my friends keep tellin' me, yeah
That I'm just a fool
But baby I can't help myself
I'm in love with you
Give me just one chance
And I'll make it right
Could be forever
Don't tell me tonight
Repeat Chorus
Repeat Chorus
Repeat Chorus
Repeat Chorus
Repeat Chorus and fade...
