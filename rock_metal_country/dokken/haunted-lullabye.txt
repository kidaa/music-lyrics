You - you took me to a place I'd never been
High - much higher than before
Now - the vision of you haunting me again
Your spirit chills me to the core
Sing to me / Your twisted melody
Mesmerized / It never seems to end
Another Haunted Lullabye
I don't know the reason or the rhyme
Another Haunted Lullabye
Steal away the cradle in my mind
Gone - and left me with insatiable desire
Still - I can't escape your trance
Take - your pleasure when you play with my lament
You cast a shadow bound romance
Sing to me / Your symphony of woe
Deafening / oh will it ever end
Another Haunted Lullabye
I don't know the reason or the rhyme
Another Haunted Lullabye
Steal away the cradle in my mind
I can't stand the way your silence leaves me broken
And my loneliness is playing on the strings of my despair
Another Haunted Lullabye
I don't know the reason or the rhyme
Another Haunted Lullabye
Steal away the cradle in my mind
