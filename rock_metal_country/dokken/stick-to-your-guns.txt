Well I've been trying this for so very long
To make you understand
If you'll fight for what you need
Don't come crawling over to me
I'm not the kind of person who quits
Even when the chips are down
You gotta fight for what you want
Don't give up
Stick to your guns
You gotta fight for what you want
Gotta believe in what you do
You gotta fight for what you want
Don't give up
Stick to your guns 
Stick to your guns
Stick to your guns
A hard time you've been having
Don't feel bad if you're on your own
If you fight for what you want
Things ain't gonna turn out so bad
You gotta fight for what you want
Gotta believe in what you do
You gotta fight for what you want
Don't give up
Stick to your guns
Stick to your guns
You gotta stick to your guns
Well, I'll tell you
You gotta fight for what you want
Gotta believe in what you do
You gotta fight for what you want
Don't give up
Stick to your guns
Stick to your guns
You gotta stick to your guns
I gotta tell you
Stick to your guns
Don't give up
Stick to your guns
You got to stick to your
You got to stick to your
You got to stick to your guns
