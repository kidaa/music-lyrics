I'm walkin' down these dark streets - all alone
a light ahead free coffee if you have no home
a parking lot full of people - same as me
waiting for the Messiah - his shift will start at three
CHORUS
He's a real convenience store messiah
idol worship for an idle mind
he's a real convenience store messiah
turning bottled water into win
waiting for the papers to come outside 
they make such nice warm blankets - get in line
sometimes he might let us - stay inside
the only one who will listen
he can be so kind
CHORUS
He's a real convenience store messiah
idol worship for an idle mind
he's a real convenience store messiah 
turning bottled water into wine
 They see through eyes
looking through his window
a glowing light
staring at his vision late at night
they idolize, they realize
reaching out their hands
CHORUS
He's a real convenience store messiah
idol worship for an idle mind
he's a real convenience store messiah
turning bottled water into wine
