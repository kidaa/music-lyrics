Lynch, Brown, Dokken
Demon eyes
And the fate is coming down on you
Fire in her eyes
The love she gives she says is all for you
Come the night
You will pay the price
In the night 
No one by your side
In the night
She will come to you
In the night
She take you down
Seven thunders
In her eyes
Seven thunders
And no where you can hide
If you can
Won't stop to look at where she's been
All the same
She's telling lies if you believe its true
Comes the night
You will pay the price
In the night
No one by your side
In the night
She will come to you
In the night
She'll take you down
In the night
You will pay the price
In the night
She will come and take your life
In the night
She will seal your fate
In the night
She'll take you down
Seven thunders
In her eyes
Seven thunders
She threw the dice
Seven Thunders
You pay the price
Seven Thunders
Now she took you in the night
Seven Thunders
She told you lies
Seven Thunders
The love she brings is not for you
Seven Thunders
Seven thunders
In her eyes
