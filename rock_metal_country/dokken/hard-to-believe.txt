In the middle of the night you
know I heard the voices call
said they'd try to ease me through my pain
then I started to question 
am I sane or confused
don't think that I will ever know
CHORUS
It's hard to believe
that the sun still sets without you
I was so afraid to let you know
It's hard to believe
that the world still turns without you
I was so afraid to let you go
I was starting to believe
that I was destined for the worst
It was all the life I'd ever know
It was getting to the point that I'd
thought I'd not return
I was so unsure of where I'd go
CHORUS
It's hard to believe 
that the sun still sets without you
I was so afraid to let you know
It's hard to believe
that the world still turns without you
I was so afraid to let you go
In the middle of the night
sometimes I hear the voices call
don't think that I will ever know
CHORUS
It's hard to believe
that the sun still sets without you
I was so afraid to let you know
It's hard to believe
that the world still turns without you
I was so afraid to let you go
