Like a whisper, you came in the night
Gone forever, seems you were right
Long ago, thought it was real
Should've believed love's not forever
I'm slippin' away
Can't seem to hold on
I'm slippin' away
Darkness comes, so cold
Gentle one, so soft and warm
I tried to touch you, I meant you no harm
I'm slippin' away
Can't seem to hold on
I'm slippin' away
Darkness comes, so cold
I'm slippin' away
Can't seem to hold one
Save me
Save me
Save me
Like a whisper, you came in the night
Gone forever, seems you were right
Long ago, I thought it was real
I should've believed that love's not forever
I'm slippin' away
Can't seem to hold on
I'm slippin' away
I just can't hold on
I'm slippin' away
Darkness comes, so cold
I'm slippin' away
Now that you're gone
