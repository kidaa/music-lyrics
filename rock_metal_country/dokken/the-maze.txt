Dokken, Pilson, Lynch
Down these halls with many doors
Around each corner, right back where I started
Deep inside my mind it seems
I try to find an open door to go through
So they can see
I'm all right
     Wanderin' round inside without a key
     Watching with these open eyes
     Locked inside the place that no one sees
     Talking with eternity, trying to explain
Chorus
     Why I'm stuck inside the maze
     All the corners look the same
     Thought I'd finally found the way
     But I'm right back where I started
     Now I'm stuck inside the maze
     All the corners look the same
     Thought I'd finally found the way
Another door, an empty room
No one seems to have been here for some time
Where have they gone
An endless world of corridors
Searching for the one that finds the way
They look the same
I remain
     Wanderin' round inside without a key
     Watching with these open eyes
     Locked inside the place that no one sees
     Talking to eternity, trying to explain
Chorus 2
Down these halls with many doors
Around each corner, right back where I started
Deep inside my mind it seems
I try to find an open door to go through
So they can see
I'm all right
Chorus 3
     Now I'm stuck inside the maze
     All the corners look the same
     Now I'm right back where I started
     Another door, anorther room
     I've been this way before
     All the corners look the same
     Now I'm stuck inside the maze
     Now I'm stuck inside the maze
     All the corners look the same
     All the corners look the same
     Now I'm stuck inside the maze
     All the corners look the same
