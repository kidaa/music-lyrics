I will rise up - over this
'till I come to a higher place
I will find strength - let go
of all the ties to my disgrace
I'm no more - and no less
than anyone else
looking for a new horizon
I can find in myself
CHORUS
It's all right the shadow's gone
shine your light with the risin' sun
It's all right take me as I am
yeah yeah yeah cuz here I stand
No hesitation - holdin' back
I'll take each step one by one
but I might fall - I could stray
If I loose my eye's today
I'm only one in a crowd
I'm just one voice on the line
looking for a new horizon
another place another time
CHORUS
It's all right the shadow's gone
shine your light with the risin' sun
It's all right take me as I am
yeah yeah yeah cuz here I stand
CODA: In our hands a light shines
we still wonder
change our world into sand
we will hunger
like a child -fears the night-
draws near its mother
like a son -fears no one-
will cast our shadow forever
'cause here I stand
