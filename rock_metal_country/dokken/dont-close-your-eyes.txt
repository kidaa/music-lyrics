Lyrics: Lynch
     Somebody's watching me, is it just a crazy dream
     Is it my memory, playing tricks on me
     Out in the streets in the heat of the city
     Here comes the night
     Sky's turning grey and black
     You knew that you were right

     Don't close your eyes
     Don't close your eyes or I'll be there
     Don't close your eyes
     Don't close your eyes or I'll be there

     Just a shadow in the dark, you've seen this face before
     Is it just a fantasy, is he coming back for more
     Out in the alleyways, there is no second chance
     Moving up behind you, you've lost the game at last

     Don't close your eyes
     Don't close your eyes or I'll be there
     Don't close your eyes
     Don't close your eyes or I'll be there

     Somebody's watching me, is it just a crazy dream
     Is it my memory, playing tricks on me
     Out in the alleyways, there is no second chance
     Moving up behind you, you've lost the game at last

     Don't close your eyes
