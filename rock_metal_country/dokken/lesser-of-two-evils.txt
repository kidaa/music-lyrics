Dokken, Pilson, Lynch
Too many days come and go
Can't find a reason to go outside
Too many things running through my mind
Brings me down for the hundredth time
Has it all been said and done
I try to find some piece of mind
Searching everywhere
For all the answers taht I can't find
Doesn't really matter
It's hard to rise above
	You might find me
	In a downward spin
	My wings are all aflame
	Saw the world beneath me
	Wonder where I'm gonna hit
	I try to embrace the sun
	But it's hard to fly
	When you just wanna die
Chorus
	Thought I knew where I was going
	It's hard to see
	Thought I knew where I'd been
	it should have been so simple
	Caught in a world unforgiven
	it could have been me
	Caught in between the lesser of two evils
Sail the sea of indecision
Tried to find a reason why
Just like staring at a picture
I watched the world go by
	I hear whispers in the darkness
	From the voices that I locked away
Chorus 2
I tried to touch the sun, yeah
But it just kept getting colder
I tried to find my soul, yeah
But he said, son you ain't getting any closer
Chorus 3
