Life is a mystery
Leaves me no consolation
Life fades like distant waves
Return again
No need to hide
Soon you'll be born again
A new chance to live
And walk that road to the end
It must be the sign of the times how I feel
Now I surrender the day
It must be the sign of the times how I feel
And I hope that you feel the same
Love is a mystery
That gives up no secrets
Embraces everyone
No hesitation
We try to find religion
How many books can we read
We look for love and romance
How hard can it be
It must be the sign of the times how I feel
Now I surrender the day
It must be the sign of the times how I feel
And I hope that you feel the same
In a way - we lost our innocence
In a day - we'll walk that road to the end
It must be the sign of the times how I feel
Now I surrender the day
It must be the sign of the times how I feel
In the way I look at you
It must be the sign of the times how I feel
I can feel that there's been a change
It must be the sign of the times how I feel
