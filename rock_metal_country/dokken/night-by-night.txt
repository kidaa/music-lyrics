It's bad enough being under control
Same thing every day
Then at night
There's a place we can go
Where nothing can stand in our way
Night by night
I can't keep it away
Night by night
Not living for the day
Night by night
It's now or never
So baby can't you see
We're living night by night
It's just you and me
Living night by night
We're living night by night
We never see the light of day
So baby can't you see
We're living night by night
yeah, we're living it night by night
The night is all that we need
I got alot 
But I wanna have more
Things just haven't been right
I'll show you to my paradise
And let you see the light
It's now or never
Gget out of the way
It's now or never
So baby can't you see
We're living night by night
It's just you and me
Living night by night
We're living night by night
We never see the light of day
So baby can't you see
We're living night by night 
Yeah, we're living it night by night
The night is all that we need
When the shadows come
Might be no moon at all
You can never tell
When you're under the spell
The night is all that we need
It's now or never
Get out of the way
It's now or never
So baby can't you see
We're living night by night
It's just you and me
Living night by night
We're living night by night
We never see the light of day
So baby can't you see
We're living night by night
It's just you and me
Living night by night
We're living night by night
We never see the light of day
Night by night
We're living night by night
Night by night
We're living night by night
Night by night
We're living night by night
Night by night
We're living night by night
