Lyrics: Dokken, Pilson
     I'd like to see you in the morning light
     I like to feel you when it comes to night
     Now I'm here and I'm all alone
     Still I know how it feels, I'm alone again


     Tried so hard to make you see
     But I couldn't find the words
     Now the tears, they fall like rain
     I'm alone again without you
     Alone again without you
     Alone again without you

     I said stay, but you turned away
     Tried to say that it was me
     Now I'm here and I've lost my way
     Still I know how it feels, I'm alone again

     Tried so hard to make you see
     But I couldn't find the words
     Now the tears, they fall like rain
     I'm alone again without you

     I tried so hard to make you see
     But I couldn't find the words
     Now the tears, they fall like rain
     I'm alone again without you
