I've been uptown, all around
I've looked here there everywhere
He killed my babe, today, with a gun
I'll get him now, he can't run
Well I'm looking for, looking for

Looking for Jack Action
To get my satisfaction
Looking for Jack Action
I'm looking, looking...

Now I can't believe she's gone away
He better run, ya know I don't play
Took my babe, my life, he's on the run
Look out Jack now, here's my gun, yeah
Well I'm looking for, looking for

Looking for Jack Action
To get my satisfaction
Looking for Jack Action
I'm looking, looking...Oh no, a man with a war to wage
I'm a suicide brigade
He's mine, he's all mine
My bullets are bearing his name
And his life is mine to claim
It's time, now it's time

Jack Action, where are you?
It's been too long since I've known
Won't give up on you till I'm done
You'll be dead soon, you can't run, no
Cause I'm looking for, looking for

Looking for Jack Action
To get my satisfaction
Looking for Jack Action
I'm looking, looking...
