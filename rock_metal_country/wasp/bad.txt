You hear
The cries of love
The sad tone
And feel the softly stinging
Love's wound
But, those tears you cry
Being of love's fame
They fall to love
Crying like a sweet rain

Cause bad girls
They do...

B.A.D.
BAD! Make your mommy and daddy say,
B.A.D.
BAD! It's the bloody fix you do
Oh look out!
You see what it's in your head
Only what you see
And need
But you can have B.A.D.
Call a spade a spadeOnly if you want to
Cause by any other name
It's taboo!
Case bad girls, they do...

The bloody fix you do! Yeah?
B.A.D.
BAD! Make your mommy and daddy say
B.A.D.
BAD! Don't it drive your women mad!
Wow!
