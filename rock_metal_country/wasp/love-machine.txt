Lady, have you no reason?
To pass this love unseen
There go my heels rising
Venus make me king

That chain of broken hearts
They all belong to me
Magic runs through my fingers
One touch you'll see!

L.O.V.E.
All I need is my love to sing, oh
L.O.V.E.
All I need is my love to sing, oh
L.O.V.E.
All I need is my love to sing, oh
L.O.V.E.
All I need is my love to sing tonight! Tonight!
What can I do for you
And I know your wildest dreams
What do I move in you, and
How would I seem?Mercy! Life! You cry
Love brings you pain!
And if you try to love me
You'll not be the same!

L.O.V.E.
All I need is my love to sing, oh
L.O.V.E.
All I need is my love to sing, oh
L.O.V.E.
All I need is my love to sing, oh
L.O.V.E.
All I need is my love to sing tonight! Tonight!
L.O.V.E.
All I need is my love to sing, oh
L.O.V.E.
All I need is my love to sing, oh
L.O.V.E.
All I need is my love to sing, oh
L.O.V.E.
All I need is my love to sing tonight! Tonight!
