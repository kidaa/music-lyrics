Dancing with danger
Right out your door
The silk hat you buy
And you sell

Mommy and daddy said
The life that you led
Will probably lead your way to hell!

On your knees!
Are you sassy?
On your knees!
Cause I want you
On your knees!
Are you sassy?
On your knees!
Cause I need you
Playing with fire
Lusting with burns
Thrusting the flames in your eyes!

Sex is painted same
They're really the same
Just use and abuse themOn your knees!
Are you sassy?

On your knees!
Cause I want you
On your knees!
Are you sassy?
On your knees!
Cause I need you

On your knees
that's where you all shall be!
Well, I'll get you contest
Your first really sin, ha-ha-ha!!!
Running in the wild wind!
And the dark fills the mystery!
We'll all be there someday!

On your knees!
Are you sassy?
On your knees!
Cause I want you
On your knees!
Are you sassy?
On your knees!
Cause I need you
Yeah!
