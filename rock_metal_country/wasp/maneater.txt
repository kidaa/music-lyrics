Blackie Lawless
Turn loose the lightning metal hawgs
And set me free
Turn loose my crying metal hearts'
1200 C.C.
Cold steel forever I'm gonna ride
And burn the flame
It feels like thunder, it's breathing fire
And can't be tamed

Thunder rolling down the highway
These wheels of fire eat you alive - them
Outlaw riders going my way
A Harley child until I die

Maneater - born free I ride
Maneater - wings of freedom
Burn the line for metal minds

Run to scorching desert sun
V-twins will scream
Into the blackness of the night, at twisting speed
High on the hawg I'm riding on
Engines explode
It feels like thunder, it's breathing fire
It rules the roadMilwaukee metal on the highway
These wheels of fire eat you alive - them
Outlaw riders going my way
Only the strong here will survive

Maneater - born free I ride
Maneater - wings of freedom
Burn the line for metal minds

Them bad boys riding on forever
When they die, they ride in Harley heaven

Maneater - born free I ride
Maneater - wings of freedom
Burn the line for metal minds
