Blackie Lawless and Chris Holmes
One night as I rode down some long winding road
I saw you, and I knew, I couldn't let you go
Half child and all woman, vision fantasy
Cast against the moonlight, bathed in ecstasy
Leopard skin and cat's eyes
Has the jungle made you wild
The prey you're after, if you faster
Will it make you smile
Ride with me, I'll set you free
Chains can't hold us down
I need you, if you want me
Lovers we are bound

Sweet Cheetah, Cheetah
I love it when your claws run through me
Fever, fever, I love it babe
Come do it to me
Cheetah, Cheetah
I love it when your claws run through me
Fever, fever, I love it babe
Come do it to me now, to me nowSkin tight you move in, so slowly to thrill
Waiting for the nighttime then you're in for the kill
Amazon so sleekly, you know what to do
Eat the flesh, and save my heart
And leave it when you're through
Pain and pleasures all mine
Untamed and running wild
Sink your teeth into me
Lick your lips and smile
Take my hand and ride the land
Forever you and me
Hold on tight, to me all night
And set your spirit free

Sweet Cheetah, Cheetah
I love it when your claws run through me
Fever, fever, I love it babe
Come do it to me
Cheetah, Cheetah
I love it when your claws run through me
Fever, fever, I love it babe
Come do it to me now, to me now
