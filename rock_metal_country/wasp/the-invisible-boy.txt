Jonathon:
I was the boy unwanted, a prisoner I'm born to them
My brother was the one, the couldn't do no wrong
And I was there dying in the shadow of him

Jonathon to his father:
Red, crimson red, am I the invisible boy?
Feel the strap, cross my back
Yeah I'm the new whipping boy

Who am I - the orphan son you would never need?
Who am I - cause I'm the boy only the mirror sees
Who am I - the slave you gave just the air I breathe?
Who am I - cause I'm the boy only the mirror sees

Jonathon:
Oh I got the same old reruns, horror movies in my head
And I can't rest, the scare me to death
But if I'm not alive, how can I be dead?

Jonathon to his father:
Red, crimson red, am I the invisible boy?
Feel the strap, cross my back
Yeah I'm the new whipping boyJonathon to the mirror:
Oh, why me?

The mirror:
Why him

Jonathon:
Can you tell me?

The mirror:
It's confession again?
Come talk to me, I see in your eyes
Titantic misery, ashamed that you're alive
I'm the face that you see
When the face isn't yours
I'm the mirror my boy
