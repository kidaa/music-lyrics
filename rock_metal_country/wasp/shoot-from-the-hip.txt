Blackie Lawless
All my life I've taken what I want
Give an inch, take a mile
Always on the hunt
Ooh - sex, money, fast cars, never get my fill
I ride hard and die free
Paying for my thrills
Firewater moonshine, going to my head
Me and my pistols loaded
Go out and knock'em dead

I'm gonna shoot it, bang-boom
Shoot it from the hip
Got it loaded bang, pull the trigger boom
I don't never miss

I'm gonna shoot it, bang-boom
Shoot it from the hip
Got it loaded bang, pull the trigger boom
I don't never miss
Cock it and let'er rip

Hot sweaty steel, a woman's fingers on my gun
Pull it hard, touch the trigger squeeze it when I'm gone
Ooh - come woman, touch me, put it in your hand
Take a hold, heart and soul
Honey, I'm your man
Cock the hammer slowly, and aim it at your love
Put my barrel in your holster
Like a velvet glove

I'm gonna shoot it, bang-boom
Shoot it from the hip
Got it loaded bang, pull the trigger boom
I don't never miss

I'm gonna shoot it, bang-boom
Shoot it from the hip
Got it loaded bang, pull the trigger boom
I don't never miss
Cock it and let'er rip

Hot and sticky, here it comes
Emotion you can't tame
Kinda tricky watch it run
Smoking like a flame, flame, flame, flame

Hot and sticky, here it comes
I got the bullets, load it up
Slide it into place
My emotions
Coming down all across your face

I'm gonna shoot it, bang-boom
Shoot it from the hip
Got it loaded bang, pull the trigger boom
I don't never miss

I'm gonna shoot it, bang-boom
Shoot it from the hip
Got it loaded bang, pull the trigger boom
I don't never miss
Cock it and let'er rip
