This is a thing I've never known before
It's called easy living
This is a place I've never seen before
And I've been forgiven

Easy living, and I've been forgiven
Since you've taken your place in my heart

Somewhere along the lonely road
I had tried to find you
Day after day on the winding road
I had walked behind you

Easy living, and I've been forgiven
Since you've taken your place in my heartWaiting, watching, wishing my whole life away
Feeling, fainting, ready for my happy day

Somewhere along the lonely road
I had tried to find you
Day after day on the winding road
I had walked right behind you

Easy living, and I've been forgiven
Since you've taken your place in my heart
Easy living, and I've been forgiven
Since you've taken your place in my heart
