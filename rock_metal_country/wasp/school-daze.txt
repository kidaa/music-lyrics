"I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of American. And
to the republic for which it stands. One nation under gob,
indivisible... with liberty and justice for all!"

My eyes are burning
Bells are ringing in my ears
Alarm clock's wailing
Class bells screaming
I can't hear!

A text book mad house
Twelve years
I'm here in a rage
A juvenile jail
And I'm here locked up
In their cage!

School daze! School daze!
I'm here doing time
School daze! School daze!
My age is a crime
School daze! School daze!
I'm here doing time
School daze! School daze!
I'm attending "Hell high"
A blackboard jungle tows the line
The rulers made
A homework hellhouse
Screams at me
Yes, it's a grave!
Tick-tock, 3 o'clock
I'm sitting here
I'm counting off the days
A fire bell's ringing hell
And I'd sure like to see the blaze!

Write it down!

School daze! School daze!
I'm here doing time
School daze! School daze!
My age is a crime
School daze! School daze!
I'm here doing time
School daze! School daze!
I'm attending "Hell high"
I pledge no allegiance
And I bet
They're gonna drive me craze yet
Nobody here
Is understanding me

I pledge no allegiance
And I bet
They're gonna drive me craze yet
I'm dying here
And trying to get free!
Wow!
