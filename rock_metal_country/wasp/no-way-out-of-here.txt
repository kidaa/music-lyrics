I went away for whole lot of days
And stripped the soul right outlaw me
Lead away in a crimson haze
The red was rain over me

There ain't no way outta here
I try to scream, I can't even speak
Why am I the only one
I can't get out and I can't go on

There ain't no way outta here
Forever red and I'm never free
Climb the walls, I can't hold on
I can't go back and I can't go onThere were faces in the dark and
In me I could not see
The mirror cracked in amillion pieces
And so did I cause Johnny's me

I'll fade forever black away
I'll give all my tomorrows for just one good today
I'm numb to feel, don't know what's real
The ghosts is killing me
