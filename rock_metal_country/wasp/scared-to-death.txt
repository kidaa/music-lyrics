Grit your teeth, and listen for the gun
Get in the runners block and kneel
And run the human race
That decadent decathlon and
Let the games begin for real
Stop scaring me - It's bedlam in paradise
Stop I can't see - Nowhere I can't hide
Scared to run, this monstrous
Marathon of fear

I run the races with a dark horse to win
Across a finish line of fear
I swim a sea of skin, afraid to drown in flesh
X-Generations revolutions here
Scared to have sex - I don't wanna die
Scared I'll be next - I'm scared for my life
Dying to live, but there ain't no way
Outta here alive - All we're all scared there's

Nowhere to run - I'm scared to death
Nowhere to hide - Scared I'll be next
Oh - Stop, stop, stop, stop
Nowhere to run - I'm scared to death
Nowhere to hide - Scared i'll be next
Oh - Stop, stop, stop, stopAm I a prisoner of the universe ?
Is destiny fixed among the stars ?
Should I cry or laugh ?
All I know is that
The best time to laugh
Is anytime you can
Life's one big party - Thrown here by god
We all get invitations - If we want them or, not
It's all truth or dare and nothin gis fair, no, no, no
We're all scared there's

Oh, it's the decade of fear
No way out of here, no, no, no
No, no, no - No, no, no - No, no, no
Oh scream in my ears
Oh stop what I hear, no, no, no
No, no, no - No, no, no - No, no, no
