You say you don't want to run and hide
A face that no one knows
And everyone you meet
You're going to show
You're nobody's slave
Nobody's chains are holding you
You hold your fist up high
And pride too

Oh, you've just go to be
Up high where the
Whole world is watching you and me
Cause I...
I've got the guts to be somebody!
To cry out
I want to be somebody
Be somebody soon

I want to be somebody
Be somebody soon
I want to be somebody
Be somebody too
You say you don't want to starve
Well, take the table crumbs and go!
You don't want to take your feed at all?
You don't want no 9 to 5 job
Fingers to the bone
You don't want the rock piles dirty
Go!
Oh, you've just got to be...
Up high where the whole world's
Watching you and me
Cause I...

I've got the guts to be somebody!
To cry out
I want to be somebody
Be somebody soonI want to be somebody
Be somebody soon
I want to be somebody
Be somebody too

I want shiny pots
And dirty ?
And lots of rock and roll
I will live in vain
And die in flames
I'm never getting old

I want to be somebody
Be somebody soon
I want to be somebody
Be somebody tall
I want to be somebody
Be somebody soon
I want to be somebody
Be somebody too
I want to be somebody
I want to be somebody!
I!
