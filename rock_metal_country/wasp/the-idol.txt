If I could only stand and stare in the mirror would I see
One fallen hero with a face like me
And if I scream, could anybody hear me
If I smash the silence, you'll see what fame has done to me

Kiss away the pain and leave me lonely
I'll never know if love's a lie
Ooh - being crazy in paradise is easy
Can you see the prisoners in my eyes
Where is the love to shelter me
Give me love, love set me free
Where is the love, to shelter me
Only love, love set me free
Set me free
