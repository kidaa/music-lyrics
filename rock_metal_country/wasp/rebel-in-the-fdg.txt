Blackie Lawless
I live my life like
A shot in the wind
If tomorrow don't come I know
I stole my share of fun for me
Cause I'm too fast, too rad
I'm going wasted when I go
The cost of freedom's never free
It's the deep six, it's my fix
It's my best friend
Cause it's my way or the highway
I tell ya it's the living end

I'm a rebel in the F.D.G.
And I say only God in heaven knows
I'm a bad child, come and love me
And I say oh, yeah
I'm a rebel in the F.D.G.
And I say only God in heaven knows
I'm a bad child, come and love me
And I say oh, yeah

If you're fast ya might last
Slow ya gotta go
A wild one in the decadent zoo
Ooh, I lick up all my seven deadly sins
Cause I'm too hot, too cool
Oh I been playing in the fire of fools
I might burn, but I'll burn in the wind
It's the deep six, it's my fix
It's the big jam
Cause it's my way or the highway
I'll tell ya what I am

I'm a rebel in the F.D.G.
And I say only God in heaven knows
I'm a bad child, come and love me
And I say oh, yeah
I'm a rebel in the F.D.G.
And I say only God in heaven knows
I'm a bad child, come and love me
And I say oh, yeahOh I, I feel the heat and I
I touch the flesh and bone
And I feel the kiss of fire
Too fast to live, too fast to die
Mom and Daddy say, "I'm dancing in the fire"

Sometimes I feel like an animal in a cage
I pace back and forth, and look around
For something to sink my teeth into
But nobody knows what's going on inside me

I'm a rebel in the F.D.G.
And I say only God in heaven knows
I'm a bad child, come and love me
And I say oh, yeah
I'm a rebel in the F.D.G.
And I say only God in heaven knows
I'm a bad child, come and love me
And I say oh, yeah
