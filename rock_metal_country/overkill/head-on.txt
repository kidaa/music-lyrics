she hit head on
couldn't stop the car
she hit straight on
didn't get 
too far
she wasn't happy
in Minneapolis
in really no place, the wheels iced a turn
and she hit head on
Lisa got hit head, head on

she hit head on
couldn't stop the car
she hit straight on
didn't get too far
she wasn't happy
in Minneapolis
in really no place, her wheels iced a turn
but she hit head on
Lisa got hit head, head on 

oh, no more sunshine,
she wasn't laughing,
she hit head on
oh, no more sunshine,
she wasn't laughing,
she hit head on
oh!
