Mind's eye hurricane
It feels nothin' like I'm missin' you
Self-inflicted pain, has turned me upside down
In the drenchin' bloody rain
I know nothin' I'm supposed to do
So I think I'll entertain thoughts of the underground
All I possess has becomes laid to rest
And the things that I love don't make a sound
All I hope is slain
Ain't nothin' more I'm gonna lose
Everything obtained is buried in the ground
As I'm goin' down the drain
I finally know it's me I screwed
So I think I'll entertain thoughts of what I found
All I possess has become laid to rest
And the things that I love don't make a sound
CH
I got the feelin getting high
I'm getting higher gonna fly
Now I'm kneelin way too high
Still getting' higher you gonna die
All night dreamin' hear the screamin'
Tear it up, run and hide
Inside burnin', the wind is turnin'
