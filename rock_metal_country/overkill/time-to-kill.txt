Violent Indecision, Surge Of Mass Religion
Let Me Out Of Prison
I'm Just Killing Time
Every Time I Turn Around
I Start To Hear Familiar Sound
Counting Down As Time Stands Still
Yes I Think It's Time To Kill
Chorus
Time To KillX4
All The Mental Anguish
Speaks A Common Language
I Have Yet To Lavisha Chance To Walk Away
Every Time I Turn Around
I Start To Hear A Familiar Sound
Counting Down As Time Stands Still
Yes I Think It's  Time To Kill
Chorus
Unknwowing, Unseeing
Revelations Unfold Before Your Eyes
Relenting, Repenting.
No Time To Think Or Comprimise
Time Falling, Time Calling
Into A Vord And Seal The Past
You're Waiting, Annihilating,
Making It Real, Making It Last
Worn Out Comprimises
Must Be Out Of Rises
See Through All The Lies
We Don't Walk Away
Every Time We Turn Around
Start To Hear That Familiar Sound
New Beginnings Time Stands Still
Yes I Think It's Time To Kill.
Chorus
