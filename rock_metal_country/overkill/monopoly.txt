We're given life to live in
And we're never gonna live it again
Gotta lead it like a dog on a leash, yeah,
But my dragon kinda's wearing thin
Rolling dice with God as our witness
Down avenues, utilities and towns
It's survival of the richest
Moving our sinful pieces 'round and 'round

It's you and me on the Monopoly board
You land on the block where I got three hotels
But it's not like you want me to win

It was your face that placed the blame on you
And your kiss that turned to brown
Your face that placed the blame on you
And your face that turned me down
But when the night is over and you need a friend
Shame on you, You're your own Monopoly

Death is always annoying,
But then nothing here is meant to last
We're spending too much time on life's preparations
Haven't we lived and died before in the past
I know we have

Now it's you and me on the Monopoly board
You land on the block where I got three hotels
Now you cheated before 'cause you know you're gonna win
and you do it again

It was your face that placed the blame on you
And your kiss that turned to brown
Your face that placed the blame on you
And your face that turned me down,
But when the night is over and you need a friend
Shame on you, you're your own Monopoly

'Cause when the night is over and you need a friend
Shame on you, you're your own Monopoly
Yes, you know you are
Your own monopoly
Yes, you know you are
Oh Monopoly
Monopoly.
