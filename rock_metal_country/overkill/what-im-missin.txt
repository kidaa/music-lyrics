In a wiped-out section of your sanity
Somewhere next to mine
There's a line between what is and what should be
A line you'll never find
It takes me far away from me, it keeps me where I've been
In the blackout, rage-filled, kill the sanity
No I never win
Take me far away from me safe within your heart
Take me where I cannot fall apart
Keep me close Don't let me go
Teach me what I need to know
Take the time & show me once again
What I'm missin'
CH
There's a little somethin' eats away at me
Deep inside my soul
Behind the wall of pure insanity
Where my dark unfolds
it takes me far away from me to a darker place
In the chaos I kill sanity, it's me I cannot face
CH
BR
WAKE
Let the sleeping lie, let 'em drop, let 'em lay
Just let 'em die
FALL
To a brand-new high, where I drop, where I lay
Where my inner dies
TAKE
What I need inside, for the long-haul vision
For the long hard ride
WALL
That I hit head on, it's the cost, the payment
It's gone
