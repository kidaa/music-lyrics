I'm comin' home, comin' home to you.
'Cause you can't live, without me.
Who left the door the window gate locked?
Who did the didn't want me in?
Way back when I was just a psychopath,
C'mon c'mon c'mon and let me in!
Whoa! They tell me I'm insane.
Whoa! Just something with my brain.
I'm a good boy now, good boy now!
Certifiable.
I'm a good boy now, good boy now!
I know I know I know you're in there,
I know that murder is a sin,
I know I'm better than I ever was,
C'mon c'mon c'mon now let me in!

3 again
You know I'm the same,
You know I havn't changed.
4 again
What you done! 
Just ain't right but I thought of you!
Every night,
It was a painful as a human bite, but we'll be together again.
An' I know that you've been thinkin' of me, cause you want it the way it used to be,
So leave the light on so I can see and you better let me in!
You better! Let me! In!
Mother fucker!
C'mon c'mon c'mon an' let me in!

Whoa! They tell me I'm insane.
