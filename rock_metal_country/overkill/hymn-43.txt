Oh father high in heaven -- smile down upon your son
He's busy with his money games -- his women and his gun.
Oh Jesus save me!
And the unsung Western hero, he killed an Indian or three
And then he made his name in Hollywood
To set the white man free.
Oh Jesus save me!
If Jesus saves -- well, He'd better save Himself
from the gory glory seekers who use His name in death.
Oh Jesus save me!
If Jesus saves -- well, He'd better save Himself
from the gory glory seekers who use His name in death.
Yeah, oh Jesus save me!
Well I saw him in the city and on the mountains of the moon --
His cross was rather bloody --
He could hardly roll His stone.
Oh Jesus save me!
