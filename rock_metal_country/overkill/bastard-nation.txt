Twisted torn and ripped,
The balance goes away.
Mine is but an active immagination.
Tear the boundary down!
Know more line.
Take a look inside the bastard that you find.
Yelling screamed and ripped,
Just to have a say.
Yours is but an over exaggeration.
Throw the civil down!
Kill your fear.
Feel the need, to act on what you hear!
Did they say we were hard?!
Did they say we were separation?!
Citizens of a bastard nation?!
Waste me for what I do,
Not for what you hate.
Guilt became the prime motivation.
Throw the civil down!
Kill his seed.
Let's cut out the heart to see if it bleeds.
Crippled lame and trapped,
The balance falls away.
Move, to total separation.
Dissolve the boundary now!
Kill the line.
You become the new! bastard that you find.
Did they say we were hard?! Did they!
Did they say we were separation?!
Citizens of a bastard nation?!
I'll walk away if you do.
And I'll stay if you do.
What you fear? Fearing be a man. ?
3 again
6 again
Did they say we were hard?! Hard!
Did they say we were separation?! 
Citizens of a bastard nation?! bastard nation!
Ahhhhhhhow!!!!!
