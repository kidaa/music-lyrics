MOTRHEAD Kilmister/Clarke/Taylor
Only way to feel the noise is when it's good and loud,
So good I can't believe it's screaming with the crowd,
Don't sweat it, get it back to you,
Overkill, Overkill, Overkill
Shut up
On your feet you feel the beat, straight to your spine,
Shake your head you must be dead if it don't make you blind,
Don't sweat it, get it back to you,
Overkill, Overkill Overkill
Shut up
Know your body's made to move, you feel it in your guts
Rock 'n' roll ain't worth the name if it don't make you strut,
Don't sweat it, get it back to you,
Overkill, Overkill, Overkill
