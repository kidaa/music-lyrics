We were together since we were far
She was so pretty, Emma was a star in everyone's eyes
And when she said she'd be a movie queen, nobody left
A face like an angel, she could be anything

Emmaline, Emma Emmaline,
I'gonna write your name high on that silver screen
Emmaline, Emma Emmaline,
I'm gonna make you the biggest star this world had ever seen

At seventeen, we were wedded
And work day and night to earn our daily bread
And every day Emma would go out searchin' for that place
That never, ever came away
You know, sometimes she come home so depressed,
I hear her cry in the bedroom, fellin' so distressed
An'I remember back when she was far
To the words that used to make Emmaline come alive
It was...

Emmaline, Emma, Emmaline
I'gonna write your name high on that silver screen
Emmaline, Emma Emmaline,
I'm gonna make you the biggest star this world had ever seen

It was cold an'dark in the summer night
When I opened up the bedroom door
To find her lain still and cold upon the bed
A love letter lain on the bedroom floor
It read: "Darling, I love you,
But I just keep on living on dreams anymore,
I tried so very hard not to leave you alone...
I just can't keep on trying no more"

Emmaline
