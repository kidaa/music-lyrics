Travellin' across the USA,
It's hard sometimes to keep it together.
Nothing but the songs that you play
And a couple kids believing your sound.
Living's just this social disease
So you, you took it straight to the highway.
Roll one up and do as you please,
Just be certain not to fall with the wrong kind of crowd.

Be extra carefull when you cross,
'Cause static comes from every erection.
Find some one or you'll be lost
And you're just the kind who's liable to never be found.
Think of you whenever it rains
And I, I hear your song on the jukebox.
Jesus don't you know it's a shame
That there really isn't any like you left around.

Mistake...
Be carefull what you take,
You've got a lot at stake,
More than you'll ever know.
Beware the overdose,
Beware the overdose.

Mistake...
Be carefull what you take,
You've got so much at stake,
It's stronger than you know.
Beware the overdose.

In the USA
You'll never find the time for slackin',
Never gonna make it today
Until you finally exit the dragon.

Look inside, inside my soul,
There's a catchy song, a catchy song,
It's coming through the radio.
There's a certain song, a certain song.
Stuck inside my soul,
It's a catchy song; it's number one,
Too bad you had overdosed.
