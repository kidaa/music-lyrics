the Sun came shining through the rain
looks like it's gonna be a rainbow day
Fruity Pebbles falling from the sky
all the colors of a rainbow high
was soothin' my soul till I seen it sail away

Bedrock in the sky
with Jesus Christ Rubble
sitting on the right hand
a hand with four big toes
now I'm not wigging on Disney anymore
God Flintstone loves me, that's for sure
God Flintstone
God Flintstone
God Flintstone
God Flintstone

aghast I walk these streets of stone
at last I find myself alone
now night is falling on a shapeless Sun
I beg forgiveness for the things I've done
no citizens for miles and miles
I await my judgement with a smile

Bedrock in the sky
with Jesus Christ Rubble
sitting on the right hand
a hand with four big toes
now I'm not wigging on Disney anymore
God Flintstone loves me, that's for sure
God Flintstone
God Flintstone
God Flintstone
ah-ooh!
I'm not wigging on Disney anymore
God Flintstone loves me, this I know
God Flintstone
God Flintstone
God Flintstone
God Flintstone
God Flintstone
God Flintstone
God Flintstone
