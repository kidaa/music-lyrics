Heaven and Hell - Black Sabbath
Sing me a song, you're a singer.
Do me a wrong, you're a bringer of evil.
The devil is only a maker, 
The less that you give, you're a taker.
And it goes on and on and on.
Heaven and Hell.
The lover of life's not a sinner.
The ending is just a beginner.
The closer you get to the meaning,
The sooner that you know you're dreaming.

The Ripper - Judas Preist
In for a surprize, in...
Well, we'll prob'ly meet,
Underneath the gas lamp, 
Where the air's cold and damp.
I'm a nasty...
Never turn your back on the ripper.
Awww...
