Long view on the eye a pocketful a pestilence  
Got a fistful of momories,a long lost innocence   
Hey baby, dead baby devil he embracin' you
With a long forked-tongue-kiss
Suckin' all the life from you
If you need to reach me
I'm broaking one through ten
And if you really need me
Can I get an amen...
Passion on a  ??????? gotta get it while it's not
With a self-centered psychopath givin'a lorget-me-not
Rapo me , rape me evrybody gets in line
With  a long forked-tongue-kiss
Sucked away the rest of time
Longview in your eye
Seal it with a kiss, you get the...
Long forked tongue kiss
Memory in your fist,you get the..
Long forked tongue kiss
Lay on down  in the bad you made
It's a little too late to cry
Or too be afraid
Driven by the high heat, call it love
Driven by the high heat
Of the velvet glove
Call it free-will,call it choice
You know you ain't alone now
There's a swecond voice
When you're not alone
Short view on the eye, a pocketful a' pestilence
With a fistful a' memories, a long lost innocence
B-b-b-baby devil he embracin' you
with a long-forked-tongue-kiss
