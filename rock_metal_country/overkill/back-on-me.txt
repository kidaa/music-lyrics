When I take you down, I don't wanna take you down.
Don't ask why I never been there, cause I don't know, oh no
If I close my eyes, I don't wanna close my eyes,there are dreams of
phantom doorways
there were dreams of you and me.

Turn your back on me [x3]

Will you drag me down, will you see just who I am.
Don't have much and never will have, but I got dreams yeah, yeah

Turn your back on me [x3]

Turn your back on me [x7]
