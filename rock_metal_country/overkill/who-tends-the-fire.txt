Who Tends The Fire
Who Keeps The Torches Lit
Who Fills Your Eyes With Smoke
So You Can't See
I Need The Fire
I Need The Torches Lit
To See Through All The Smoke
Covering Me
Chorus
I Have Seen The Fires Burning
Burning Through The Night
I Have Watched The Tides A Turning
And They Go From Dark To Light
What Is This Meaning
What Does This Writing Mean
Where Do I Go
What Do I Do For Now
Propheces Are Foolish
They Never Last
They Never Speak The Truth
So Why Are They Calling Me Now.
Chorus
I Don't Know Cause I Cannot See
All I'm Sure Is Gotta Be
I'm Not Sure That I'm Even Me
But I Know That I Gotta Be
Yes I Know That You're Gonna Die.
Birth, Life, Death, Is The Reason Why
Save Those Fears That You're Gonna Cry.
Cause I Know That You're Gonna Die
Yes I Know I Cannot See
And I'm Sure That I Gotta Be
All These Voices Are Killin' Me
But They Say That I Got
Say That I Got
Say That I Gotta Be Me.
Who Tends The Fire
Who Keeps The Torches Lit
Who Fill Your Eyes With Smoke
So You Can't See
I Need The Fire
I Need The Torches Lit
To See
Chorus
