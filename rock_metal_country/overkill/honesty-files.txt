Do you care what the line is,
Do you care if you won't,
Lesson one is let's stop waiting for the sunlight
It's not crazy to bow down in the full moon, in the full moon

Do you care what the riot is,
Do you care if falsefied,
Lesson one is let's stop waiting for the sunlight
It's not crazy to bow down in the full moon, in the full moon

Hey, hey I'm dead on arrival,
Hey, hey I'm distant
Crawling right back, yes, I'm crawling right back
'Cause I'm honesty, don't break my heart,
Honesty won't break it,
Honesty won't break your heart,
Honest it won't, it won't

Hey, hey I'm dead on arrival,
Hey, hey I'm distant
Crawling right back, yes, I'm crawling right back
'Cause I'm honesty, don't break my heart,
Honesty won't break it,
Honesty won't break you heart,
Honest it won't,
It won't, it won't, it won't, it won't, it won't...
