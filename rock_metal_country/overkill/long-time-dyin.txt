Seen this happen once before
with a little of touch of denial
A man on his knees he was licking the floor
like he's trying to reconcile
You fill your pot with anger,
You eat all that you can,
Tell you one thing as I look back now
I don't ever want to be that man again
Cannot feel it at all
Can't you feel it
Can't taste it at all
Can't you taste it
Then I looked him straight in the eye
And I said hey man
Are you gonna take a long time dyin'
No
Standin' on a white line
Tryin' to free my soul
Sey hey God would give me a sign
I'm actin' like a fool
I filled my heart with hatred
Puked up all I would
Tell you one thing I got on my knees
I wouldn't do it again even if if I could
Can't feel it at all
Can't you feel it
Can't taste it at all
Can't you taste it
Then I looked him straight in the eye
And I said hey man
Are you gonna take a long time dyin'
No
Sometimes I think it's not my fault
It's everything but me
And sometimes it's the third time
And I drown in misery
Sometimes it's the way it is
Sometimes it ain't fair
Most times I'm the architect
Who builds a just dont care
Just don't care
Happened to me once before
Little of touch of denial
I was on my knees
I was lickin' the floor
Tryin' to reconcile
Shit out a luck looks like your fucked
reconcile
I don't wanna be that man again
Can't feel it no more
Can't you feel it
Can't taste it no more
Can't you taste it
Then I looked him straight in the eye
And I said hey man
Are you gonna be a long time dyin'
No
