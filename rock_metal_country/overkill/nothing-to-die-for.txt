Old Enough To Know Better
Too Young To Core
Bent On Self Destruction
Goin' Nowhere
If I Had A Reason
I Could Make It Work For Me
If I Had An Answer
I Wouldn't Be So Hard To See
I'm Feelin' Just The Same
I'm Feelin' Just No Pain
I'm Not Goin' Down The Drain
Make My Own Decisions
Just Go Away
Take The Consequences
Just Not Today
Got Enough Reasons
Still Nat Workin' For Me
Got Enough Answers
Still So Hard To See
Somethin' Is Confusin' Me
Somethin' Is Abusin' Me
Somethin' Is Refusin' Me. Life
Chorus
Let Me Live. I Wanna Give
I've Been Through Hell And Back
So Many Times Before
Take Me There
I Don't Care Where
And Show Me Why
There's Nothin' To Die For Too.
Old Enough To Know Better
Too Dead To Change
Went In With A Full Deck
Goin' Out Deranged
Thought I Had A Reason
Tried, It Didn't Work For Me
I Had All The Answers
I Was Too Blind To See
Mirror Man In My Eye
Mirror Man Make You Cry
Mirror Man Make You Die.
Chorus
