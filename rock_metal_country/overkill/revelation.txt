Got a better  night...got a better ' for somebody kill me
Got a better tight..for me it seem better
That I ever had known before
How do you see with blindness all around you
How do you understand...
and when you see the enemy surround you
When do you show hand
Got to leave it alone
Call me a nation
Got to leave it at home
Call me a brand new revelation
I am a homicide
I am a shadow waiting for a casket
I am preoccupied
You know I think
Someone want to kill me
How can you bleed with vultures all aroound you
How can you give them hope...
How can you sleep with murderers inside you
I could never cope...
I feel your cold hand lying over me
I feel  the underside , your generosity
And I hear the angels singing,
Do they sing for me
I feel your cold hand
How can you sleep at night
How can you bleed with vultures all around you
How do you understand
How ca you sleep with murderers inside you
When do you show your hand...
