THE SEX PISTOLS Jones/Cook/Matlock/Rotten
Seen you in the mirror when the story began
and I fell in love with you I love yer mortal sin
Your brains are locked away but I love your company
I only ever leave you when you got no money
I got no emotions for anybody else
You better understand I'm in love with myself
Myself my beautiful self
No feelings no feelings
No feelings for anybody else
Hello and goodbye and a runaround Sue
You follow me around like a pretty pot of glue
I kick you in the head you got nothing to say
Get out of the way cos I gotta getaway
You never realise I take the piss out of you
You come up and see me and I'll beat you black and blue
Okay I'll send you away
No feelings no feelings
No feelings for anybody else except for myself
My beautiful self dear
Ain't no moonlight after midnight
I see you stupid people out looking for delight
well I'm so happy I'm feeling so fine
I'm watching all the rubbish you wasting my time
I look around your house and there's nothing to steal
I kick you in the brain when you get down to kneel
and pray you pray to your god
No feelings no feelings
A no feelings for anybody else
No feelings no feelings
No feelings for anybody else except for myself
Your daddy's gone away be back another day
