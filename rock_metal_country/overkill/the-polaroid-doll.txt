ooh!
you said you wanted something
I give no promises
is that what you want, baby
you gave me half a chance
and half your body - I had to take it 
it's a doll-faced polaroid
I'm gonna hang it on my wall
and call it polaroid doll
I wanted a polaroid 

now I just wanna talk about it
child, I got something to say
though don't worry mama, I'm not about to give it away 

it's a doll-faced polaroid, gonna hang it on my wall
and call itpolaroid doll
I wanted a polaroid
polaroid doll
I wanted a polaroid 

you wanna stick around, baby, I don't care
if you gonna take a ride to my dead-end heart
don't ever take my kissin' for a handshake
