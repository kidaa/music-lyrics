You're Killin'me, Your Mouth Is Movin'
But I Cannot Hear You Speak
Life's A Tragedy. Go On Livin'
In A World Not For The Weak
Keep Your Dreams Inside Your Heart
Never Let The Pressure Tear You Apart
Truth Is Whispered On A Breath
Loud Enough To Cover The Smell Of Death
Chorus
Never Thought Too Important To Mention
Livin' Through The Birth, The Birth Of
                               Tension
Never Thought Too Important To Mention
Livin' With The Tension, Tension, Tension.
Don't You Understand Too Much Tension,
                                 Snap
Where You Lose Your Grip
Too Many Demands Start At Birth, Snap
From The Bomb You're Ripped
Leave Your Dreams Inside, Behind
Never Had A Reason That You'll Never
                                Find
Tension Builds Another Way
Gonna Make You All Go Away
Chorus
Too Much Tension, All Around
Too Much Tension, Bring You Down
All The Pressures In The Narrow Mind
All The Reasons You'll Never Find
Did You Kill Your Father,Sleep With Your
                                  Mother
Idolize Your Sister, Jealous Your Brother
Did Ya Kick The Dog, Were You Beat A Strap
Were You Really Be Abused, Were You Fakin'
                                  All That
Too Tense
You're Killin' Me So Many Ways
So Little Time To Think
Life's Catastrophe,My Glass Empty
And I Really Need A Drink
Movin' All So Very Quick
Movin' So Fast That It Makes Me Sick
Let Me Outta Here
Livin' Ain't Livin' With The Tension And
                                The Fear
Chorus
