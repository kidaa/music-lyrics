Miracle Man
You're Miracle Man many times
Save me from the outside
Save me from the hurt
Save me from this cold inside and
Save me from myself
What you see when you're looking at me
Take me out, take me out of captivity
Got my head, my dreams, my dead my screams
Started up the engin of the afterlife machine
I've got your head and your covenant of dreams I've got your head
I've got your dead and a collection of your screams
Not your ordinary bout with madness
I'm in love with the infinite sadness
Can you see clear to save me, save me
From myself, save me
Miracle Man
You're Miracle Man many times
Keep me safe and warm
Keep me underground
Keep me from what I deserve and
Don't just keep me down
What I want, what I need to be
Take me out, take me out of obscurity
Got my head, my dreams, my dead, my screams
Gone o.d. on the afterlife machine
I've got your head and your afterlife machine I've got your head
I've got your dead and a collection of your screams
Not your ordinary bout with madness
I'm in love with the infinite sadness
Can you see clear to save me, save me
From myself, save me
Just a victim of my imagination 4x
What you see when you're looking at me
Take me out, take me out of captivity
Got my head, my dreams, my dead my screams
Started up the engin of the afterlife machine
I've got your head 3x
I've got your dead 3x
Not your ordinary bout with madness
I'm in love with the infinite sadness
Can you see clear to save me, save me
From myself
Not your ordinary bout with madness
I'm in love with the infinite sadness
Can you see clear to save me, save me
From myself
save me
Miracle Man many times
