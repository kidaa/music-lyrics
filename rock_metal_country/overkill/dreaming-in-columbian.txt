Worlds apart, separation from my mind.
Just close my eyes to bring me there.
I fall apart, the peices are so hard to find.
A puzzle peice is torn in half.
The absence, of colour. surrounds a broken dream.
Call my eyes to take me there...
One by one I watch, as the peices disappear,
My friends become the ones I hate.
This house of cards it, won't withstand the wind.
I shut my eyes to escape.
All my whites have turned to black.
Everytime I close my eyes, dream in columbian.
All my bugs are comin' back.
Crawlin' on my face, they speak in!
Columbian.
Oo oo OO OO! oo WO! OO oo AHOo oo Oo oo WAOo.  whatever :2x
Worlds apart, a separation from my soul.
Worlds apart, the separation is now whole.
I watch the peices fall apart.
I try to make a brand new start.
I'm fallin' in, I'm fallin' out,
I'm fallin' up, I'm fallin' back,
I'm fallin' down, an' fallin' round, an' askin' why?
