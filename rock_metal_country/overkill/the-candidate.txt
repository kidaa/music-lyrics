I am the candidate, I hope your voting for me,
Candid candidate, making promises so easily
I am the candidate,
But I'm not your favorite son - you say
I hope you come out on election day

I am the candidate, but you don't need me,
Looking down like a satellite, oh, how I wish I could see.
I am the candidate,
But I'm not your favorite son - you say.
I hope to see you on election day.

All these people that I call friends,
Can't beleive what I've done.
I'm just a criminal lost on my own.
I've got to run, got to run, got to run, got to run...
I'm running

I am the candidate,
I am your candidate,
I hope your voting for me...
