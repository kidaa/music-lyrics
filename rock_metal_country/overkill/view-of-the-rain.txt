I don't try anymore, 'cause only booze improves with age,
I don't fight anymore, but sometimes my fists clentch up in rage
And I don't cry anymore, but sometimes my skies get cloudy
And sometimes them clouds rain down upon a dream,
But I don't mind anymore 'cause now my mind is wasted on a dream

Take a walk upside yourself,
Get to know the person behind the face,
Is it someone you can really love
Is it someone who looks down from above
With a view of the rain
Rain

I don't smile anymore, too many smiling faces lie,
I don't pray anymore 'cause too many of God's children die, yes they do,
And I don't love anymore, you said you knew where love is,
I never knew where you was coming from,
But I don't mind anymore 'cause now my mind is wasted on a dream
Mind wasted on a dream

You've got to
Take a walk beside yourself,
Get to know the person behind the face,
Is it someone you can really love
Is it somebody who looks down from above
With a view of the rain
Rain
View of the rain

Take a walk upside yourself,
Get to know the person behind the face,
Is it someone you can really love
Is it somebody who looks down from above
With a view of the rain
Rain
View of the rain
View of the rain
View of the rain
View of the rain.
