a full-grown baby
you're growin' so tired of growin' old
and how old are ya'
and were you ever really ...baby 
there'll be a new Sun risin'
for another day's passin'
over your gray horizon 

today is the first day of the rest a' your life
time goes away
you've thought about checkin' out and don't deny it
time goes away
but if you really wanna can the music,
you better sleep on it
fill your life with the love or lose it,
like a' rock 'n roll music
no more agin' now
today you're gonna help celebrate Blackie's birthday
he's 22 today

he's 22 today
so you're gonna get up
you're gonna wrap him up a big surprise
today is Blackie's birthday
and we'll sing happy birthday to you 

today is the first day of the rest a' your life
time goes away
you've thought about checkin' out and don't deny it, already tried it
time won't go away, no it won't
but if you really wanna can the music,
you better sleep on it
fill your life with the love or lose it,
like a' rock 'n roll music
no more agin' now for us
