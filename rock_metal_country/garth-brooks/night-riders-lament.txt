One night while I was out a ridin' 
The grave yard shift, midnight 'til dawn 
The moon was bright as a readin' light 
For a letter from an old friend back home 
And he asked me 
Why do you ride for your money 
Tell me why do you rope for short pay 
You ain't a'gettin' nowhere 
And you're loosin' your share 
Boy, you must have gone crazy out there 
He said last night I ran on to Jenny 
She's married and has a good life 
And boy you sure missed the track 
When you never come back 
She's the perfect professional's wife 
And she asked me 
Why does he ride for his money 
And tell me why does he rope for short pay 
He ain't a'gettin' nowhere 
And he's loosin' his share 
Boy he must've gone crazy out there 
Ah but they've never seen the Northern Lights 
They've never seen a hawk on the wing 
They've never spent spring on the Great Divide 
And they've never heard ole' camp cookie sing 
Well I read up the last of my letter 
And I tore off the stamp for black Jim 
And when Billy rode up to relieve me 
He just looked at my letter and grinned 
He said now 
Why do they ride for their money 
Tell me why do they ride for short pay 
They ain't a'gettin' nowhere 
And they're loosin' their share 
Boy, they must've gone crazy out there 
Son, they all must be crazy out there
