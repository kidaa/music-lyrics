There was a bad boy in the school yard 
Waited on you every day 
Seemed like every time you turned around 
Well he was standin' in your way 
Well he broke your glasses 
The girls all laughed 
As he pushed you to the floor 
But then you stood up one day knowin' 
You couldn't stand it anymore 
And your gentle hand was finally clenched in rage 
You were face to face 
Face to face with the devil that you've been dreadin' 
Eye to eye finally has arrived 
But bad as it was, well now brother wasn't it better 
Dealin' with him face to face 
Your date showed up with flowers 
And you thought your dreams had come 
But with every passing hour 
You felt it come undone 
Then the night exploded and you begged him no 
But he forever changed your life 
And now he waits a judge and jury 
Thinkin' you'll break down inside 
And with a finger you can put his fists away 
And you're face to face 
Face to face with the devil that you've been dreadin' 
Eye to eye finally has arrived 
But bad as it was, well little sister wasn't it better 
Dealin' with him face to face 
'Cause it'll never go away 
Until the fear that you are runnin' from is finally embraced 
Drivin' by the grave yard 
On a wicked winter's eve 
And you're wonderin' why a man of faith 
Is whistlin' nervously 
Then you stop the car 
And you hold your heart 
'Cause you finally realize 
Hell, the devil ain't in the darkness 
He's a'rattlin' 'round inside 
And with folded hands you truly start to pray 
And you're face to face 
Face to face with the devil that you've been dreadin' 
Eye to eye finally has arrived 
But bad as it was, well now brother wasn't it better 
Dealin' with him face to face 
'Cause it'll never go away 
Until the fear that you are runnin' from is finally embraced 
Face to face
