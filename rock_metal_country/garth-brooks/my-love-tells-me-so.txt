Lead Singer: Gordon Kennedy 

You don't have to cry when I say good-bye, good-bye 
You know I'll be coming back real soon 
And when I do, you know 
It will be such a sweet hello 

Rising like the sun above the sky line, sky line 
Love is brighter than ever before 
And that should be understood 
When is said I do you knew I would 

Some things can be good forever 
My love tells me so 
Two hearts can be one together 
My love tells me so 

Let me lay your head upon my pillow, baby 
Whisper what you need to me, my dear my dear 
Don't worry, close your eyes 
Morning will find me by your side 

Some things can be good forever 
My love tells me so 
Two hearts can be one together 
My love tells me so 

whispered
Give me a chance and I'll sing for you 
I have a song for you 
To be with you is a dream 
I dream of you 

Some things can be good forever 
My love tells me so
