Well Santa looked a lot like daddy 
Or daddy looked a lot like him 
It's not the way I had him pictured 
Santa was much too thin 
He didn't come down the chimney 
So mama must have let him in 
Santa looked a lot like daddy 
Or daddy looked a lot like him 
Well they thought that I was fast-a-sleepin' 
They thought that I was tucked in bed 
They never figured that I'd come a peepin 
Or I'd hear what was said 

Santa put his arms around mama 
And mama put her arms around him 
So if santa ain't daddy 
Well then I'm gonna tell on them 
Well santa looked a lot like daddy 
Or daddy looked a lot like him 
It's not the way I had him pictured 
Santa was much too thin 

I never saw dancer or prancer 
I never heard the sleigh bells ring 
I never saw a red-nosed reindeer 
Like they show on the TV screen 
But he sure had lots of presents 
So santa claus he must have been 

Well he sure looked a lot like daddy 
Or daddy looked a lot like him 
Well santa looked a lot like daddy 
Or daddy looked a lot like him 
It's not the way I had him pictured 
Santa was much too thin
