Tell the children of Abraham 
There's a star over Bethlehem 
And the light in the manger 
Come a Christmas morn 
When baby Jesus is born 

Angel came to Mary 
Said, I'm tellin' you 
The light of this world 
Is shinin' inside of you 
His sweet forgiveness 
Gonna set men free 
The lame will walk 
And the blind will see 

Tell the children of Abraham 
There's a star over Bethlehem 
And the light in the manger 
Come a Christmas morn 
When baby Jesus is born 

Wise men following a holy light 
Shepherds heard singing 
In the midnight sky 
And they all came a runnin' 
Through the stable door 
The meek and the mighty 
The rich and the poor 

Tell the children of Abraham 
There's a star over Bethlehem 
And the light in the manger 
Come a Christmas morn 
When baby Jesus is born 
Baby Jesus is born
