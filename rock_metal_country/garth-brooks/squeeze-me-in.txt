Honey, I know
You got a good job
You're out there
Making all that dough
They keep you late
Working that overtime
And I don't ever
See you no more
I guess you're not
Checking your message machine
Seems like you're never in
But I've got a hunch
If we can just do lunch
I could get your attention again

[BRIDGE:]
Whoever said
It's a man's world
Don't know what
He's talking about
You've got me working
Around the clock
Honey, trying to figure you out
I know time is money
But there's more to life honey
Than how much you can spend
You've got to make a little time
For the good times
Honey, can you squeeze me in

[CHORUS:]
Whoever said
It's a man's world
Don't know what
He's talking about
You've got me working
Around the clock
Honey, trying to figure you out
I know time is money
But there's more to life, honey
Than how much you can spend
You've got to make a little time
For the good times
Honey, can you squeeze me in

I've got it circled in red
On the calendar, baby
You told me that
Tonight's the night
I've got the champagne chilled
I've got a gourmet meal
Soft music and candlelight
I try to get you on the phone
I get stuck on hold
I guess you keep getting sidetracked
I've been faxing you
Love notes all day long
But you don't ever fax me back

[Repeat bridge]
[Repeat chorus]
