I can tell by the way you've been turning men down 
Not your ordinary guy is gonna do 
You've been waitin' for that someone 
Who can turn your head around 
Well now honey, I'm that special one for you 

There must be a million fish out in that ocean 
So you must find the one that's right for you somehow 
Well, it's up to you, I'm here for years 
Or 'till the night-time disappears 
I'm Mr. Right or Mr. Right now 

And if you'd choose to be my wife 
I would love you all my life 
I'd do everything your precious heart allowed 
Or we could make love all night long 
And in the morning I'd be gone 
I'm Mr. Right or Mr. Right now 

There must be a million fish out in that ocean 
So you must find the one that's right for you somehow 
Well, it's up to you, I'm here for years 
Or 'till the night-time disappears 
I'm Mr. Right or Mr. Right now 

I'm Mr. Right forever or just until whenever 
Mr. Right or Mr. Right now
