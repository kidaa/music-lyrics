For a change
I headed South
Across the border
For the pesos and
A different horse to ride
I'd be back to make
The rodeo in Waco
But that was long
Before I saw them
Dark brown eyes
With long black hair and
English bad and broken
Her body said the words
She couldn't find
As I hung on every word
She left unspoken
The question started
Leaning on my mind

[CHORUS:]
Rodeo or Mexico
They both can keep
A cowboy satisfied
Rodeo or Mexico
The only way
I know how to decide
Is just to get on and ride

We danced all night
Beneath that sheet of cotton
And you just don't
Tell a girl like that goodbye
But the cowboy life
Ain't easily forgotten
Though lying there
I couldn't help
But wonder why

[Repeat chorus]

The morning
Found the answer
Dawning on me
As I woke up to the
Sharp end of a knife
He was screaming at
The woman hanging on me
Does anybody know the
Spanish word for wife

[Repeat chorus]
