Jesus our brother kind and good 
Was humbly born in a stable of wood 
And the friendly beasts around him stood 
Jesus our brother kind and good 
"I" said the donkey shaggy and brown 
I carried his mother up hill and down 
I carried her safely to Bethelhem town 
"I" said the donkey shaggy and brown 

And "I" said the cow all white and red 
I gave him my manger for a bed 
I gave him my hay to pillow his head 
"I" said the cow all white and red 
"I" said the sheep with the curly horn 
I gave him my wool for his blanket warm 
And he wore my coat on that Christmas morn 
"I" said the sheep with the curly horn 

"I" said the dove from the rafters high 
I cooed him to sleep that he should not cry 
We cooed him to sleep my love and I 
"I" said the dove from the rafters high 
And "I" said the camel all yellow and black 
Over the desert upon my back 
I brought him a gift in the wise men's pack 
"I" said the camel all yellow and black 

Thus every beast remembering it well 
In the stable dark was so proud to tell 
Of the gifts that they gave Emmanuel 
The gifts that they gave Emmanuel
