She got an unsigned letter from her secret someone 
And she fell into the mystery 
Words were few and specifically vague 
Intrinsic intrigue 
But it said everything 
When it just read come to me 

She's always been that responsible someone 
Safe within her simplicity 
But all this cloak and dagger is stoking her heart 
Stroking her curiosity 
Is plain little Jane 
Gonna risk everything 

Is she gonna strike the match 
That'll surely light the flame 
Is she carrying a torch for love in vain 
Is she gonna break the locks 
Take a look inside the box 
Knowing that she could release Pandora's shame 
Welcome to the game 
What's in a name 

She must be dreamin as she boards a plane 
And flies into her fantasy 
A first class ticket to the city of Boston 
Is all she knows of her destiny 
When she touches down 
Will her feet hit the ground 

Is she gonna strike the match 
That'll surely light the flame 
Is she carrying a torch for love in vain 
Is the gonna bread the locks 
Take a look inside the box 
Knowing that she could release Pandora's shame 
Welcome to the game 
What's in a name 

Is our little plain Jane 
Gonna risk everything 

Yeah.
Is she gonna strike the match 
That'll surely light the flame 
Is she carrying the torch for love in vain 
Is the gonna break the locks 
Take a look inside the box 
Knowin that she could release Pandora's shame 
Oh, welcome to the game 
What's in a name
