We all came here for a party tonight 
And your gonna get left if you don't get right, child 
So forget your troubles and forget the news 
We're gonna pull the plug and black out them blues 
And if your tie's to tight then adjust the noose 
'Cause if your gonna hang tight, cut loose 

Tearin' it up 
And we're burin' it down 
Hey daddy's hide your daughters 
'Till the sun come back around 
'Cause we all came here to party 
We came to come unwound 
So go tell everybody that the boys are back in town 
Just to tear it up 
And to burn it down 

We love to hear you stomp and sing 
Just swamp a little southeast western swing thing 
So just grab unto each other and let go 
Make a little midnight moonlight mo-jo 
When the magic happens let it all hang out 
If you wanna join the fun shout 

Tearin' it up 
And we're burin' it down 
Hey daddy's hide your daughters 
'Till the sun come back around 
'Cause we all came here to party 
We came to come unwound 
So go tell everybody that the boys are back in town 
Just to tear it up 
And to burn it down 

INSTRUMENTAL BREAK 

Tearin' it up 
And we're burin' it down 
Hey daddy's hide your daughters 
'Till that sun come back around 
'Cause we all came here to party 
We came to come unwound 
So go tell everybody that the boys are back in town 
Just to tear it up 
And to burn it down 

We know you like to party 
We know you like to throw it down 
So go tell everybody 
Let's get them all around 
We're gonna tear it up 
And burn it down
