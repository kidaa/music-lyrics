Love was burning like the summer 
We were lost in one another 
Holding on, holding on 
We could not escape the heat 
Love was dangerous but sweet 
And it was strong 

Now you're talking 'bout your freedom 
What is that you say 
You suddenly declared to me 
Your independence day 

Caught me by surprise 
Fog turning to ice 

Well it ain't even cold, baby, 
How could it snow in July 

Well, you led me to believe that 
You found everything you needed 
In my arms, for so long 
I thought everything was fine 
Now you're turning on a dime 
And moving on, moving on 
Now I should have brought my sweater 
For a chill is in the air 
There's a sudden change of weather 
For which I am not prepared 

Caught me by surprise 
Fog turning to ice 

Well, it ain't even cold, baby 
How could it snow in July 

Well, I should have brought my sweater 
For a chill is in the air 
There's a sudden change of weather 
For which I am not prepared 

Caught me by surprise 
Fog turning to ice 

Well, it ain't even cold baby 
How could it snow in July
