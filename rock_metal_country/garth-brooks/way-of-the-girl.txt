The very air that surrounds her 
A breath you can't live without 
Can't think straight since you found her 
What's this creature about 

You persue her in mazes 
Always one step behind 
You'd change the world for her graces 
But she keeps changing her mind 

It's just the way of the girl, just the way of the girl 
It's just the way of the girl, just the way of the girl 

Some made it for money 
Some made it for love 
Some made it for romance 
My baby's all the above 

It's just the way of the girl, just the way of the girl 
Just the way it is, can't help it 
It's just the way of the girl, just the way of the girl
