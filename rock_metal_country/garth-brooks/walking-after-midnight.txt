I go out walkin' after midnight 
Out in the starlight 
Just like we used to do 
I'm always walkin' after midnight 
Searching for you 
I walk for miles along the highway 
Well, that's just my way 
Of sayin' I love you 
I'm always walkin' after midnight 
Searchin' for you 
I stop to see a weeping willow 
Cryin' on his pillow 
Maybe he's cryin' for me 
And as the skies turn gloomy 
Night winds whisper to me 
I'm as lonesome as I can be 
I go out walkin' after midnight 
Out in the moonlight 
Just a-hopin you may be 
Somewhere a-walkin' after midnight 
Searchin' for me 
I stop to see a weeping willow 
Cryin' on his pillow 
Maybe he's cryin' for me 
And as the skies turn gloomy 
Night winds whisper to me 
I'm as lonesome as I can be 
I go out walkin' after midnight 
Out in the moonlight 
Just a-hopin you may be 
Somewhere a-walkin' after midnight 
Searchin' for me 
I go out walkin' after midnight 
Searchin' for you
