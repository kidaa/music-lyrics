There's a fire burning bright 
At our house tonight 
Slow music playing 
And soft candlelight 
On her lips I keep tasting 
The warm red wine 
I'm there in her arms 
But it's all in my mind 

The snow is piled high on the highway tonight 
I'm a ship lost at sea on this ocean of white 
Eighteen wheels anchored somewhere out of Dover 
I wish I could hold her 
Instead of huggin' this old cold shoulder 

This old highway 
Is like a woman sometimes 
She can be your best friend 
But she's the real jealous kind 
She's the lady that leads me 
To the life I dream of 
She's the mistress that keeps me 
From the ones that I love 
The snow is piled high on the highway tonight 
I'm a ship lost at sea on this ocean of white 
Eighteen wheels anchored somewhere out of Dover 
I wish I could hold her 
Instead of huggin' this old cold shoulder 
God, I wish I could hold her 
Instead of huggin' this old cold shoulder
