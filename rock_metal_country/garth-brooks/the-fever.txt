He's got a split finger wrap 
And his rope's pulled way to tight 
He's got a lunatic smile  
'Cause he's really drawn deep tonight 

He's got a fever, fever, fever, fever 
Grab a hold of anything and hold on tight 
It hits you like the venom from a rattle snake bite 
We're all here 'cause he's not all there tonight 

He takes one breath  
And time turns inside out 
Then the gate busts open to the world he dreams about 

He's got a fever, fever, fever, fever 
Stick a rope on anything 'cause he don't care 
He'd even take a ride on the electric chair 
We're all here cause he's not all there tonight 

He says it's really kind of simple 
Keep your mind in the middle  
While your butt spins 'round and 'round 
Take heed to Sankey's preachin' 
Keep liftin' and reachin' 
And ridin' like there ain't no clowns 

What he loves might kill him 
But he's got no choice 
He's a different breed  
With a voice down deep inside 
That's screamin' he was born to ride 

He's got a fever, fever, fever, fever 
Fever makes you crazy 'cause it makes no sense 
Like runnin' from your shadow out of self-defense 
He won't run and baby he can't hide 
He thinks the odds are even leavin' one hand tied 
He gets so tired of hangin' on so tight 
I know you think he's crazy well I think you're right 
We're all here 'cause he's not all there that's right
