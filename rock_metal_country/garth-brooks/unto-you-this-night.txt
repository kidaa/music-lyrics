On a night so long ago 
By the light of one bright star 
Two weary travellers far from Galilee took refuge in a stable 
Where a little child was born to bring the gift of love to you and me 
When the angels told the shepherds of his birth 
There came a great rejoicing on the earth And they sang glory to God in the highest 
Dawning that first Christmas morn' 
Peace on earth and tidings of great joy 
For unto you this night a child is born 
And, lo, these many years since then 
That ancient star still guides us 
And now again our Christmas voices ring 
Blessed we are and safe at home with loved ones here beside us 
And in the still and silent night we sing 
How the angels told the shepherds of his birth 
And there came a great rejoicing on the earth 
And they sang glory to God in the highest 
Dawning that first Christmas morn' 
Peace on earth and tidings of great joy 
For unto you this night a child is born
