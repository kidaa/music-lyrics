On a two lane north of Casper
Is where this all begins
Heading back to Oklahoma
For a week to visit friends
She was walking 'long the highway
So I pulled off to the side
And asked her if she needed a ride

We tor up that ole blacktop
'Til we found I-25
And just into Colorado
She asked if she could drive
I'd never met nobody like her
I'd never laughed so much
And I grew hungry for her touch

I used to think of autumn
As sweaters and leaves
And I used to think the night
Was just for dreamers and thieves
But that was before she came
Allison Miranda was her name

By the time that we hit Kansas
We both felt pretty beat
So we found ourselves a motel
And grabbed a bite to eat
We'd rest a few short hours
Soon we'd be out of there
Three days later we came up for air

I used to think of autumn
As sweaters and leaves
And I used to think the night
Was just for dreamers and thieves
But that was before she came
Allison Miranda was her name

Now I can't forget
The morning when I woke alone in bed
To a rose left on her pillow
And a goodbye note that read
You cannot grow a flower
If you don not have the seed
Now I've got everything I need

I used to think of autumn
As sweaters and leaves
And I used to think the night
Was just for dreamers and thieves
But that was before she came
Allison Miranda was her name
