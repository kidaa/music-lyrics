Lazy yellow moon coming up tonight
Shining through the trees
Crickets are singing and lightning bugs
Are floating on the breeze
Baby, get ready

'Cross the field where the cerrk turns back
by the old stump road
I'm gonna take you to a special place
That nobody knows
Baby, get ready

You and me going fishin' in the dark
Lying on our backs and counting the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moonlight
We'll be falling in love in the middle of the night
Just moving slow
Spend the whole night through
Feels so good to be with you

Spring is almost over and the summer's coming 
The days are getting long
I've waited all winter for the time to be right
Just to take you along
Baby, get ready

And it don't matter if we sit forever
And the fish don't bite
We'll jump in the river and cool ourselves
From the heat of the night
Baby, get ready

You and me going fishin' in the dark
Lying on our backs and counting the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moonlight
We'll be falling in love in the middle of the night
Just moving slow
Spend the whole night through
Feels so good to be with you

You and me going fishin' in the dark
Lying on our backs and counting the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moonlight
We'll be falling in love in the middle of the night
Just moving slow
Spend the whole night through
Feels so good to be with you
