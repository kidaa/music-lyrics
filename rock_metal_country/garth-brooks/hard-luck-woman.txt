If never I met you 
I'd never had seen you cry 
If not for the first "hello" 
We'd never had to say good-bye 
If never I held you 
My feelin's would never show 
It's time I start walkin' 
But there's so much you'll never know 
I keep tellin' you hard luck woman 
You ain't a hard luck woman 

Rags, the sailor's only daughter 
A child of the water 
Too proud to be a queen 
Rags, I really love ya 
I can't forget about you 
You'll be a hard luck woman 
Baby, 'til you find your man 

Before I go let me kiss you 
And wipe the tears from your eyes 
I don't wanna hurt you girl 
You know I could never lie 
I keep tellin' you hard luck woman 
You ain't a hard luck woman 
You'll be a hard luck woman 
Baby, 'til you find your man 

Rags, the sailor's only daughter 
A child of the water 
Too proud to be a queen 
Rags, I really love ya 
I can't forget about you 
You'll be a hard luck woman 
Baby, 'til you find your man 
You'll be a hard luck woman 
Baby, 'til you find your man
