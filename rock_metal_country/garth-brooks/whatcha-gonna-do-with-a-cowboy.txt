Brooks, Sanders 

I can see you got your eye on this old cowboy 
And I can tell you never had one for your own 
Or you never been around one 
Now you're thinkin' that you've found one 
Well, it might be kind of fun to take him home 

You giggle every time that I say, "Yes, Ma'am" 
And I get this feeling, if I held you tight 
You'll be seeing "his" and "hers" 
Buckles, boots and spurs 
But that's a feeling you'll get over overnight 

'Cause whatcha gonna do with a cowboy 
When that old rooster crows at dawn 
When he's lyin' there instead 
Of getting out of bed 
And puttin' on his boots and gettin' gone 
Whatcha gonna do when he says, "Honey, 
I got half a mind to stay" 
Whatcha gonna do with a cowboy 
When he don't saddle up and ride away 

You see it takes a special kind of woman 
To put up with the life a cowboy leads 
'Cause his boots are always muddy 
And his beer-drinkin' buddies 
They'll camp out on the couch and never leave 

Don't even start to think you're gonna change him 
You'd be better off to try to rope the wind 
What he is is whatcha got 
And he can't be what he's not 
And honey, you can't hide it from your friends 

So whatcha gonna do with a cowboy 
When that old rooster crows at dawn 
When he's lyin' there instead 
Of getting out of bed 
And puttin' on his boots and gettin' gone 
Whatcha gonna do when he says, "Honey, 
I got half a mind to stay" 
Whatcha gonna do with a cowboy 
When he don't saddle up and ride away 

Yeah, whatcha gonna do with a cowboy 
When he don't saddle up and ride away
