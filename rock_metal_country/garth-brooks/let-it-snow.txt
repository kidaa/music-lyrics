The weather outside is frightful 
But the fire is so delightful 
And since we've no place to go 
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow 

Well, it doesn't show signs of stopping 
But we've got some corn for popping 
And the lights are turned way down low 
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow 

When we finally kiss goodnight 
How I hate going out in the storm 
But as long as you hold me tight 
Oh, all the way home I'll be warm 

The fire is slowly dying 
But my dear we're still goodbye-ing 
And as long as you love me so 
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
