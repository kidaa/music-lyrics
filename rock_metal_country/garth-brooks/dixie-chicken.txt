I seen the bright lights of Memphis 
And the Commodore Hotel 
And it was there beneath the streetlamp 
Where I met a southern belle 
Well she took me to the river 
Where she cast her spell 
And it was 'neath that Memphis moonlight 
She sang this song so well 
If you'll be my Dixie chicken 
I'll be your Tennessee lamb 
And we can walk together 
Down in Dixie land 
Down in Dixie land 
We hit all the hotspots 
My money flowed like wine 
Till the lowdown southern whiskey 
Began to fog my mind 
Well I don't remember church bells 
Or the money I put down 
On the white picket fence and boardwalk 
At the house on the edge of town 
Now but boy do I remember 
The strain of her refrain 
And the nights we spent together 
And the way she called my name 
If you'll be my Dixie chicken 
I'll be your Tennessee lamb 
And we can walk together 
Down in Dixie land 
Down in Dixie land 
It's been a year since she ran away 
Guess that guitar player sure could play 
She always liked to sing along 
He was always handy with a song 
Then one night in the lobby 
Of the Commodore Hotel 
I by chance met a bartender 
Who said he knew her well 
And as he handed me a drink 
He began to hum a song 
And all the boys there at the bar 
Began to sing along 
If you'll be my Dixie chicken 
I'll be your Tennessee lamb 
And we can walk together 
Down in Dixie land 
Down in Dixie land 
If you'll be my Dixie chicken 
I'll be your Tennessee lamb 
And we can walk together 
Down in Dixie land 
Down in Dixie land
