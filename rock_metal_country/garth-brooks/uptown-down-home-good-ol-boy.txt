He'll never wear a business suit 
Cowboy hats and bull hide boots just suit him fine 
See that buckle shine 

He won it in a rodeo 
On a horse named Desperado 
And he won the ride but he broke his back 
Hist so hard he heard it crack 
No more rodeo 

But you can't keep a good man down 
A line of western wear uptown heard of his fame 
And they bought his name 

Now he looks down from a suite 
At the silver limo parked out on the street 
And he's not just a face in a martini crowd 
He drinks long neck Bud and gets a little loud 
The man's back on his feet 

He's an uptown down-home good ol' boy 
In a business world so fast 
On a horse of a different color 
But he'll hang on 'til the last 
He's still the local hero 
He's the hometown pride and joy 
He's an uptown down-home good ol' boy 

A woman loved him through it all 
Through his rowdy days and hardest fall when he almost died 
She stayed by his side 

She's still right there today 
He wouldn't have it any other way 
And he never did get too proud 
To hang out with the same old crowd 
We're proud to say 

He's an uptown down-home good ol' boy 
In a business world so fast 
Oh but it's a different saddle 
Than he once rode in the past 
Well he's still the local hero 
He's an uptown down-home good ol' boy 
He's an uptown down-home good ol' boy
