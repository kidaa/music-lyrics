They married on a fancy yacht out on the water 
He knew she was young enough to be his daughter 
There always questions in the heart of millionaires 
Would she make heartfelt promises if the money was not there 

And he said, do you love me, baby, do you want me to hold 
Or are you just digging for gold 
Do you care enough to give me your heart and soul 
Or are you just digging for gold 

She ran his weary heart through the ringer 
And she wore him like the diamond ring around her finger 
Well, his advances and affections, she managed to avoid 
But, she got the lap of luxury and he got paranoid 

And he said, do you love me, baby, do you want me to hold 
Or are you just digging for gold 
Do you care enough to give me your heart and soul 
Or are you just digging for gold, digging for gold 

Big house, limousines, 
Fine wines, fine cuisines, 
Vale and Vegas twice a year, 
Trips to Paris on the leer 

Black Tuesday when that wall of wealth came crashing down 
Bad news day when that little queen had to give back her crown 
And he said, hey babe, we can live on love cuz love is worth much more 
But he barely got his feelings out, she was half way to the door 
And she never even heard him cry 

Do you love me, baby, do you want me to hold 
Or are you just digging for gold 
Do you care enough to give me your heart and soul 
Or are you just digging for gold
