It was a hundred and seven
We were heading to town
She had her sleeves rolled up
And the windows rolled down
That girl is a cowboy
Robert Earl was singing out
The "Buckin' Song"
With every word that Keen was bringing
She was singing along
That girl is a cowboy

Sometimes the best cowboys ain't cowboys at all
She's got my back
Even when it's against the wall
When I need a friend
She's the guy I call
'Cause sometimes the best cowboys
Ain't cowboys at all

so I took her tout to show her
how to rope and ride
I can't believe that it was me
That wound up broke and tied
The girls is a cowboy
So that night I decided
We should paint the town
I made it home although
I really don't remember how
That girl is a cowboy

Sometimes the best cowboys ain't cowboys at all
She's got my back
Even when it's against the wall
When I need a friend
She's the guy I call
'Cause sometimes the best cowboys
Ain't cowboys at all

There's just something that a cowgirl has
Ain't no cowboy's got
Man she's something when she's one of the boys
But something else
Any time she's not

Sometimes the best cowboys ain't cowboys at all
She's got my back
Even when it's against the wall
When I need a friend
She's the guy I call
'Cause sometimes the best cowboys
Ain't cowboys at all
