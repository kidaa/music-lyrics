Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays 
'Cause no matter how far away your roam 
If you long for the sunshine and a friendly gaze 
For the holidays you can't beat home sweet home 

I met a man who lived in Tennessee 
And he was looking for 
Pennsylvania and some homemade pumpkin pie 
Now in Pennsylvania folks are traveling 
Down to Dixie's sunny shore 
The Atlantic to Pacific 
Oh, the season is terrific 
Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays 
For the holidays you can't beat home sweet home
