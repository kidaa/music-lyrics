They packed up all his buckles 
And shipped his saddle to his dad 
And by the way the house looked 
She must have took it bad 
The workers come on Monday 
To fix the door and patch the wall 
They say she just went crazy 
The night she got the call 

He was up in Wyoming 
And drew a bull no man could ride 
He promised her he'd turn out 
Well it turned out that he lied 
And their dreams that they'd been livin' 
In the California sand 
Died right there beside him in Cheyenne 

They she just went crazy 
Screamin' out his name 
She ran out into the ocean 
And to this day they claim 
That if you go down by the water 
You'll see her footprints in the sand 
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne 

They never found her body 
Just her diary by her bed 
It told about the fight they had 
And the words that she had said 
When he told her he was ridin' 
She said then I don't give a damn 
If you never come back from Cheyenne 

They she just went crazy 
Screamin' out his name 
She ran out into the ocean 
And to this day they claim 
That you can go down by the water 
And see her footprints in the sand 
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne 

Nobody can explain it  
Some say she's still alive 
They even claim they've seen her 
On the shoreline late at night 
So if you go down by the water 
You'll see her footprints in the sand 
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne 

Every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne
