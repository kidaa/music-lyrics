Just hear those sleigh bells jingling 
Ring-ting-tingling too 
Come on it's lovely weather 
For a sleigh ride together with you 
Outside the snow is falling 
And friends are calling yoo-hoo 
Come on it's lovely weather 
For a sleigh ride together with you 

Our cheeks are nice and rosy 
And comfy cozy are we 
We're snuggling close together 
Like two birds of a feather should be 
Let's take the road before us 
And sing a chorus or two 
Come on it's lovely weather 
For a sleigh ride together with you 

There's a birthday party 
At the house of farmer Gray 
It'll be the perfect ending 
To the perfect day 
We'll be singing the songs 
We love to sing 
Without a single stop 
At the fireplace where 
We'll watch the chestnuts pop 

There's a happy feeling 
Nothing in the world can buy 
When they pass around the coffee 
And the pumpkin pie 
It'll nearly be like a picture print 
By Currier and Ives 
These wonderful things are the things 
We remember all through our lives
