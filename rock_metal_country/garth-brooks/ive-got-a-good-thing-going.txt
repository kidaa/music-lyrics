She swears there's nothing wrong, but something's missing 
She's never been much good at telling lies 
'Cause you can hear the sound of leaving, if you listen 
This may be California, but Oklahoma's in her eyes 

I've got a good thing going 
It's plain to see she's tired of hanging on 
I've got a good thing going 
It's killing me that she's as good as gone 

By now she must be tired of always giving 
And tired of what she's getting in return 
I guess Oklahoma's more her style of living 
'Cause I can see her heart is heading 'cross a bridge I thought she'd burned 

I've got a good thing going 
It's plain to see she's tired of hanging on 
I've got a good thing going 
It's killing me that she's as good as gone 

Lord it's killing me that she's as good as gone
