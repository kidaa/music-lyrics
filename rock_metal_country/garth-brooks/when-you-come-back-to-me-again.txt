More info about this song in the Song Database 
There's a ship out, on the ocean 
At the mercy of the sea 
It's been tossed about, lost and broken 
Wandering aimlessly 
And God somehow you know that ship is me 

'Cause there's a lighthouse, in the harbor 
Shining faithfully 
Pouring its light out, across the water 
For this sinking soul to see 
That someone out there still believes in me 

On a prayer, in a song 
I hear your voice and it keeps me hanging on 
Raining down, against the wind 
I'm reaching out 'til we reach the circle's end 
When you come back to me again 

There's a moment we all come to 
In our own time and our own space 
Where all that we've done, we can undo 
If our heart's in the right place 

On a prayer, in a song 
I hear your voice and it keeps me hanging on 
Raining down, against the wind 
I'm reaching out 'til we reach the circle's end 
When you come back to me again 
And again I see my yesterday's in front of me 
Unfolding like a mystery 
You're changing all that is and used to be 

On a prayer, in a song 
I hear your voice and it keeps me hanging on 
Raining down, against the wind 
I'm reaching out 'til we reach the circle's end 
When you come back to me again 

When you come back to me again
