We were walking 'long the ocean
Together hand in hand
When I stopped to write "I Love You" in the sand
And when I looked up you were standing
Ten miles out at sea
And in a sweat
I woke up from that crazy dream
As I reached to hold you in the morning light
It was your pillow
I clung to so tight

[Chorus]
For a minute there
I thought it was you
For a minute there
My prayers had finally come true
For a minute there
I began again to live
What I wouldn't give
For just a minute there

Five o'clock on Friday
Sitting at a light
When this angel walked right by me
On my right
And the cars all started honking
As my feet hit the ground
And though I chased and called
You never turned around
Oh the walk, the hair, the perfume
Were the same
How I wished she would've answered
To your name

[Repeat Chorus]

Tonight the stars in heaven
Are bright as they could be
And I swear on of them
Is winking down at me

[Repeat Chorus]

What I wouldn't give
How I'd love to live
For just a minute there
