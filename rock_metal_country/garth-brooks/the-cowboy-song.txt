Pushin horns weren't easy like the movie said it was 
And I don't recall no dance hall girls 
Or hotel rooms with rugs 
You worked hot and tired and nasty 
Rode your pony's head too low 
There were all the nights you couldn't sleep 
'Cause it was too damn cold 
And you'd sing "Strawberry Roan" and "Little Joe" 
Like the time we hit the river 
And the rains began to fall 
And the water was risin' so damn fast 
We thought it'd drown us all 
We lost a lot of steers that day 
And four to five good mounts 
But when all the boys rode into camp 
We knew that's what counts 
And we sang, yippie ti yi yay and "Amazing Grace" 
Or the night they broke behind us 
And then took us by surprise 
I whistled out to Bonner, I seen the terror in his eyes 
And he rode for all his horse would ride 
And I know he done his best 
But he crossed over Jordan ridin' Dunny to his death 
And we sang "Bringing in the Sheaves" and "The Rugged Cross" 
So when you see the cowboy, he's not ragged by his choice 
He never meant to bow them legs 
Or put that gravel in his voice 
He's just chasin' what he really loves 
And what's burnin' in his soul 
Wishin' to God that he'd benn born a hundred years ago 
Still singin' "Strawberry Roan" and "Little Joe"
