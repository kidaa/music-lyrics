One light blinking off and on 
Blood of life in this town is gone 
Lost all its pieces but the pawn 
Tomorrow stopped coming with the dawn 

In my dreams, I've seen 
Things that only seem to happen on the silver screen 
When it's over there's no walking out 
Cuz I've been all they talk about 
Cuz what ain't goin' down 
On Main Street 

I went too early with a friend of mine 
just to see what it was all about 
Hit the freeway and it blew my mind, 
I had to find a way of gettin' out 
She said, they say, hey you gotta live a little 
In my mind, I'd find lost ain't living, 
even there in the middle of Main Street 

Yeah....

Never did the things I though I would 
Woulda left just didn't know I could 
If things don't work like they should 
It ain't for better but it's for good 

Cuz in my dreams I've seen 
Things that only seem to happen on the silver screen 
When it's over there's no walking out 
Cuz I've been all they talk about 
Cuz what ain't goin' down 
In my dreams I've seen 
Things that only seem to happen on the silver screen 
When it's over there's no walking out 
Cuz I've been all they talk about 
Cuz what ain't goin' down 
On Main Street
