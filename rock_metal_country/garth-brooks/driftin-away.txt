With all of my heart, I know I could love you 
But, with all of my soul, I'm driftin away 
With all of my mind, I know you could save me from myself 
And anything else, 
With all of my strength, I wanna reach out for you 
With every breath, I call out your name 
With every step, I just wanna turn around and say 
Baby make it okay 

But I'm so afraid 
that you've forgiven me one too many times 
And I'm so afraid 
to give my heart again, just to have a change of mind 
And I'm not quite sure that you can trust me 
And I would hate to have you find me again 
Baby, like the wind, driftin away 

It blows and nobody knows where it's going to 
I'm driftin away 
It blows and nobody know what it's gonna do 

With all of my heart, I know I disappointed you 
And although I'm real sorry 
I don't know how to save this time 
But, if I would lose you 
I know I would go completely out of my mind 
I'm running out of time 

And I'm so afraid that you've forgiven me one too many times 
And I'm so afraid to give my heart again just to have a change of mind 
And I'm not quite sure that you can trust me 
And I would hate to have you find me again 
Baby, like the wind, driftin away 

It blow and nobody knows where it's going to 
Driftin away 
It blows and nobody knows what it's gonna do 
You see my heart at night 
At night you can hear it cry as the tear drops fall from heaven's eyes 
Fallin down 
And somehow you know it's true, these tears that fall are fallin for you 
Fallin for you 

It blows and nobody knows where's it going to 
Fallin down 
It blows and nobody knows what it's gonna do 
At night you can hear it cry as the tear drops fall from heaven's eyes 
And somehow you know it's true these tears that fall are for you 

Repeat
