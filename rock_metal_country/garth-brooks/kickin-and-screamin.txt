Well, I don't know what my uncle did 
But he must have done it right 
They sure strung him up one Saturday night 
He had spent his whole life fussin' 
Would have spent his last breath cussin' 
'Til he realized the deal was really done 
He started screamin' "hallelujah" 
Tryin' to make his peace with everyone 
Yeah, he was kickin' and screamin' 
Just like he came in 
He was kickin' and screamin', darlin' 
Right to the bitter end 
Ain't it funny how we come in kickin' giddyup 
And go out hollerin' whoa 
Lord, we never want to be here 
Sure don't ever want to go 
Well, I could hear those church bells ringin' 
To my best friend I was clingin' 
Screamin' "If you love me brother don't let me go" 
Well then the whole scene was repeated 
Two years later I begged and pleaded 
Screamin' "If you love me, honey, 
Now you know you wouldn't want to let me go" 
No, I didn't want to do it 
But I sure don't want to see it come undone 
Yeah, I was kickin' and screamin' 
Just like I came in 
I was kickin' and screamin', darlin' 
Right to the bitter end 
Ain't it funny how we come in kickin' giddyup 
And go out hollerin' whoa 
Lord, we never want to be here 
Sure don't ever want to go 
Yeah, I was kickin' and screamin' 
Just like I came in 
I was kickin' and screamin', darlin' 
Right to the bitter end 
Ain't it funny how we come in kickin' giddyup 
And go out hollerin' whoa 
Seems, we never want to be here 
Sure don't ever want to go
