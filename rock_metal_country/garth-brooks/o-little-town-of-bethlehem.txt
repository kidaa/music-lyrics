O little town of Bethlehem 
How still we see thee lie 
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep 
The silent stars go by 

Yet in they dark streets shineth 
The everlasting light 
The hopes and fears of all the years 
Are met in thee tonight 

Oh holy child of Bethlehem 
Descend to us we pray 
Cast out our sins and enter in 
Be born to us today 

O morning starts together 
Proclaim thy holy birth 
And praises sing to God the King 
And peace to men on earth 

O hear thy sacred angels 
As faith holds wide the door 
Then darkness wakes, the glory breaks 
As Christmas comes once more
