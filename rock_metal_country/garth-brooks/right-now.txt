Maybe it's the movies, maybe it's the books 
Maybe it's the government and all the other crooks 
Maybe it's the drugs, maybe it's the parents 
Maybe it's the gangs, or the colors that we're wearin' 
Maybe it's the high schools, maybe it's the teachers 
Tattoos, pipe bombs underneath the bleachers 
Maybe it's the music, maybe it's the crack 
Maybe it's the bible, or could it be the lack 

Come on people, now 
Smile on your brother 
Everybody get together 
Try to love one another, right now...right now 

Okay, maybe it's the papers, maybe it's the family 
Maybe it's the internet, radio, TV 
Maybe it's the president, maybe it's the last one 
Maybe it's the one before that 
Maybe it's the athletes, maybe it's the dads 
Maybe it's the sports fans, agents, fads 
Maybe it's the homeless, aliens, immigrants 
Maybe it's life, don't tell me that it's imminent 

Come on people now 
Smile on your brother 
Everybody get together 
Try to love one another right now 

Come on people now 
Smile on your brother 
Everybody get together 
Try to love one another right now 
You gotta love one another 

Maybe it's the fallout, maybe it's the ozone 
Maybe it's the chemicals, the radiation, cell phones 
Maybe it's the magazines, maybe it the next page 
Lotteries, fast food, bad news, road rage 
Maybe it the unions, big business 
Maybe it's the KKK and the skinheads 
Maybe it's the daughters, maybe it's the sons 
Maybe it's the brothers of the mothers or the guns 

Come on people now 
Smile on your brother 
Everybody get together 
Try to love one another right now 

Come on people now 
Smile on your brother 
Everybody get together 
Try to love one another right now 

You know, if we don't talk about it 
It ain't gonna get better 

We gotta love one another 

So, whadda say, let's talk 

Maybe it's the parks, maybe it's the sex 
Maybe it's the talk shows, maybe it's a reflex 
Maybe it's the taxes, maybe it's the system 
Judges, lawyers, prisons 
Maybe it's the Catholics, maybe it's the Protestants 
Maybe it's the addicts, and the hippies and communists 
Maybe it's a fashion, maybe it's a trend 
Maybe it's the future... maybe it's the end
