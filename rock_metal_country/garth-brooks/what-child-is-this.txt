What child is this who laid to rest 
On Mary's lap is sleeping 
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet 
While shepherds watch are keeping 
This, this is Christ the king 
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing 
Haste, haste to bring him laud the babe the son of Mary 

Why lies he in such mean estate 
Where ox and cattle are feeding 
Good Christians fear for sinners here 
The silent word is pleading 
This, this is Christ the king 
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing 
Haste, haste to bring him laud the babe the son of Mary 

So bring him insence, gold and myrrh 
Come peasant king to own him 
The King of kings salvation brings 
Let loving hearts enthrone him 
This, this is Christ the king 
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing 
Haste, haste to bring him laud the babe the son of Mary
