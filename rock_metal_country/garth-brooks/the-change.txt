One hand  
Reaches out 
And pulls a lost soul from harm 
While a thousand more go unspoken for 
They say what good have you done 
By saving just this one 
It's like whispering a prayer 
In the fury of a storm 

And I hear them saying you'll never change things 
And no matter what you do it's still the same thing 
But it's not the world that I am changing 
I do this so this world will know  
That it will not change me 

This heart 
Still believes 
The love and mercy still exist 
While all the hatred rage and so many say 
That love is all but pointless in madness such as this 
It's like trying to stop a fire  
With the moisture from a kiss 

And I hear them saying you'll never change things 
And no matter what you do it's still the same thing 
But it's not the world that I am changing 
I do this so this world will know  
That it will not change me 

As long as one heart still holds on  
Then hope is never really gone 

I hear them saying you'll never change things 
And no matter what you do it's still the same thing 
But it's not the world that I am changing 
I do this so this world we know  
Never changes me 

What I do is so 
This world will know 
That it will not change me
