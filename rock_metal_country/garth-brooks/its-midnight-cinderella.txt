It's midnight Cinderella but don't you worry none 
'Cause I'm Peter Peter the Pumpkin Eater 
And the party's just begun 

I guess your prince charming 
Wasn't after all 
'Cause he sure seemed different right after the ball 
I guess more than horses are turnin' into rats 
And by the way he's walkin'  
I can guess where your slipper's at 

It's midnight Cinderella time that you should know 
There's gonna be some changes in the way this story goes 
It's midnight Cinderella but don't you worry none 
'Cause I'm Peter Peter the Pumkin Eater 
And the party's just begun 

I'm gonna help you get over  
Bein' under that spell 
You're gonna learn to love midnight 
Inside this pumpkin shell 
I gotta few new magic tricks 
Your godmother can't do 
I'll show you what it means to 
Bip, bip, bip, bip, boppity boo 

It's midnight Cinderella time that you should know 
There's gonna be some changes in the way this story goes 
It's midnight Cinderella but don't you worry none 
'Cause I'm Peter Peter the Pumkin Eater 
And the party's just begun 

I'm Peter Peter the Pumpkin Eater 
And the party has now begun
