She used to be my rosa amarilla
My litte mexicali tomatilla
But then one night i drank to much sangria
Woke up and found a note that said I'll see ya

Oh my baby no esta aqui no more
My baby no esta aqui no more
She left me here with nada
Broken heart like a pinata
My baby no esta aqui no more

Whoa, whoa, whoa, if you see her
PLease, please tell her that i need her
I used to be her number one vaquero
Her numero uno caballero
But i've had to hock my spurs and my sombrero
'Cause when she left she tookall my dinero

Oh, my baby no esta aqui no more
My baby no esat aqui no more
she left me here with nada 
Broken heart like a pinata
My babay no esta aqui no more

Whoa, whoa, whoa if you see her 
Please, please tell her that i need her

Oh, my baby no esta aqui no more
My baby no esta aqui no more
She left me here with nada
