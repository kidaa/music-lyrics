She wants something with a ring to it
Like a church bell makes
Like a pretty white gown to wear
And some vows to take
She wants something with a ring to it
I think I understand
Gonna have to put a ring on her finger
If I'm gonna be her man

My baby's playin' hard to please
And I think I figured out
What it is she wants from me
'Cause when I hold her close
When we go out at night
I can hardly see the moonlight
For the diamonds in her eyes

She wants something with a ring to it
Like a church bell makes
Like a pretty white gown to wear
And some vows to take
She wants something with a ring to it
I think I understand
Gonna have to put a ring on her finger
If I'm gonna be her man

My baby did but now she don't
And if I don't say I do
It's a safe bet that she won't
Love me like she used to
When our love first began
Now the only way to change her tune
Is with a wedding band

She wants something with a ring to it
Like a church bell makes
Like a pretty white gown to wear
And some vows to take
She wants something with a ring to it
I think I understand
Gonna have to put a ring on her finger
If I'm gonna be her man
