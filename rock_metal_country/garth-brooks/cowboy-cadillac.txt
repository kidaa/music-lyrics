I've never know one better 
She's a real go getter 
If you met her you'd be good as gone 

She's a real red liner 
Likes it all behind her 
She's the kind that keeps you hangin' on 

She's a cowboy's buddy 
Even when she gets muddy 
Lord, she's lovely from her front to back 

So either comin' or goin' 
Know her best sides showin' 
She's my cowboy Cadillac 

She's the perfect picture 
Of the perfect mixture 
'Tween a woman and fine machine 

She's a hard work lover 
A real tough mother 
She's the cover of a magazine 

And I'm happy knowin' 
That what keeps me goin' 
Is what's gonna keep me comin' back 

She's my honkin' tonkin' 
Everything I'm wantin' 
Cowboy Cadillac 

She loves to haul them cattle 
All my ropes and saddle 
And it doesn't matter work or play 

If it's a mountain 
She can crawl it 
If it's hay 
Then she can haul it 
She's the last one to call it a day 

Every cowboy loves her 
Lord, they all dream of her
Oh and brother, don't they all react 

At the end of the evening 
When they see my leaving 
With my cowboy Cadillac 

She's the perfect picture 
Of the perfect mixture 
'Tween a woman and fine machine 

She's a hard work lover 
A real tough mother 
She's the cover of a magazine 

And I'm happy knowin' 
That what keeps me goin' 
Is what's gonna keep me comin' back

She's my honkin' tonkin'
Everything I'm wantin'
Cowboy Cadillac

She's my honkin' tonkin'
Everything I'm wantin'
Cowboy Cadillac
