It's the most wonderful time of the year 
With the kids jingle-belling 
And everyone telling you 
Be of good cheer 
It's the most wonderful time of the year 

It's the hap-happiest season of all 
With those holiday greetings 
And great happy meetings 
When friends come to call 
It's the hap-happiest season of all 

There'll be parties for hosting 
Marshmallows for roasting 
And caroling out in the snow 
There'll be scary ghost stories 
And tales of the glories 
Of Christmases long, long ago 

It's the most wonderful time of the year 
There'll be much mistletoe-ing 
And hearts will be glowing 
When loved ones are near 
It's the most wonderful time of the year
