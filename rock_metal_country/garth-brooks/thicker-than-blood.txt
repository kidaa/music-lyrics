She was born in Kansas City
Raised in Arkansas
Fell in love with an ex-Marine
She already had three babies
He had one of his own
They came together
For another and me
Our family never shared
The same last name
But our family
Was a family, the same
And they say
Blood is thicker than water
Oh, but love is
Thicker than blood

Wreck out on the highway
Rain falling down
Lord, he must have
Fell asleep at the wheel
There's a number of people
Just standing around
Lord, I can't condemn
The fear that they feel

For that river of red
Could be the death of me
God, give me strength
And keep reminding me
That blood is thicker than water
Oh, but love is
Thicker than blood

And if blood is
Thicker than water
Then what are we fighting for
We're all sons and daughters
Of something that
Means so much more

I see it on my TV
But I can't understand
Lord, it's one
Big contradiction to me
How in god's name
We love thy neighbor with fists
In our hands
And kill each other
When we just don't agree

Why can't we see the walls
We can't see through
And see what God's
Been telling me and you
And that is
Blood is thicker than water
Oh, but love
Love is thicker than blood
