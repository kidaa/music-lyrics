Silent night, holy night 
All is calm, all is bright 
'Round young virgin, mother and child 
Holy infant so tender and mild 
Sleep in heavenly peace 
Sleep in heavenly peace 

Silent night, holy night 
Shepherds quake at the sight 
Glory streams from heaven a far 
Heavenly host sing allehlujah 
Christ the saviour is born

Silent night, holy night 
All is calm, all is bright 
'Round yon virgin, mother and child 
Holy infant so tender and mild 
Sleep in heavenly peace
