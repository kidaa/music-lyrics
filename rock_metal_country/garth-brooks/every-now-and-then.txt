I walked down to the park last night 
Warm breeze stirring up a soft moonlight 
And my mind started drifting to way back when 
Yes I do think about you every now and then 
The other day I saw a car like you used to drive 
I got a funny feeling down deep inside 
And for the briefest moment I felt a smile begin 
Yes I do think about you every now and then 
I love my life and I'd never trade 
Between what you and me had and the life I've made 
She's here and she's real, but you were too 
And every once in a while I think about you 
I heard a song on the radio just yesterday 
The same one you always asked me to play 
And when the song was over 
I wished they'd played it again 
Yes I do think about you every now and then 
I love my life and I'd never trade 
Between what you and me had and the life I've made 
She's here and she's real, but you were too 
And every once in a while I think about you 
I've been layin' here all night listenin' to the rain 
Talkin' to my heart and tryin' to explain 
Why sometimes I catch myself 
Wondering what might have been 
Yes I do think about you every now and then 
Every now and then 
Every now and then
