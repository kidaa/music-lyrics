Mary had a little lamb 
Little lamb 
Little lamb 
Mary had a little lamb 
It's fleece was white as snow. 

Everywhere that Mary went 
Mary went 
Mary went 
Everywhere that Mary went 
The lamb was sure to go. 

It followed her to school one day 
School one day 
School one day 
It followed her to school one day 
Which was against the rules. 

And so the teacher turned it out, 
Turned it out 
Turned it out 
And so the teacher turned it out, 
But still it lingered near 

And waited patiently about, 
Patiently about 
Patiently about 
And waited patiently about 
Till Mary did appear 

"Why does the lamb love Mary so?" 
Love Mary so? 
Love Mary so? 
"Why does the lamb love Mary so?" 
The eager children cry 

"Why, Mary loves the lamb, you know." 
Loves the lamb, you know, 
Loves the lamb, you know 
"Why, Mary loves the lamb, you know." 
The teacher did reply
