The dining room fell silent 
I can't believe what I just said 
I just told my dad he's full of it 
And I watched his face turn red 
And I should've said, "I'm sorry" 
But I matched him shout for shout 
I can still hear that screen door slammin' 
The night I called him out 
He said, "Son it's gonna hurt me more than it hurts you" 
But somehow I couldn't help but have my doubts 
'Cause I'd seen my own dear brothers crawl back in the house 
Each time they called the old man out 
Fist to fist and eye to eye 
Standin' toe to toe 
He would've let me walk away 
But I just would not let it go 
Years of my frustration 
Had let me to this night 
Now he'll pay for all the times that he's been right 
He said, "Son it's gonna hurt me more than it hurts you" 
But somehow I couldn't help but have my doubts 
'Cause I'd seen my own dear brothers crawl back in the house 
Each time they called the old man out 
It was over in a minute 
That's when I realized 
The blood came from my mouth and nose 
But the tears came from his eyes 
And in memory of that fateful night 
I know the greatest pain was his 
And I just pray some day I'm half the man he is 
He said, "Son it's gonna hurt me more than it hurts you" 
But somehow I couldn't help but have my doubts 
'Cause I'd seen my own dear brothers crawl back in the house 
Each time they called the old man out 
Just like my own dear brothers 
I crawled back in the house 
The night I called the old man out
