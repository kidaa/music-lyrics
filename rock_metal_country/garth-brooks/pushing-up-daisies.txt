Sometimes I tell you
The way that I feel
I swear that
I'm going crazy
Keep telling myself
It ain't that big a deal
It's better than
Pushing up daisies
I felt the arrow from
Death's fatal quiver
Come so close
It actually grazed me
I bled the blood and
I felt the cold shiver
God only knows how
He saved me

[CHORUS:]
There's two dates in time
That they'll carve
On your stone
And everyone knows
What they mean
What's more important is
The time that is known
In that little dash
There in between
That little dash
There in between

Sometimes my heart is
As true as a dove
Sometimes my heart
It betrays me
So I draw my sword for
To fight for my love
But without a whisper
She slays me

My mother died but
Somehow she keeps living
She'll never cease to amaze me
Now Dad turns his back
On each day that he's given
Because he'd rather be
Pushing up daisies

[Repeat chorus]
