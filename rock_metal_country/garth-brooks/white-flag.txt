I say black, you say white 
I say day, you call it a night 
What's wrong with this scene 
What does this mean 

You set me up, shoot me down 
I'm wounded on this battleground 
It's time, for sure, for ending this war 
Cuz my heart can't take anymore 

Sendin' up, sendin' up, sendin' up a white flag 
Love won't have a chance if all we do is just fight about it 
Sendin' up, sendin up, sendin' up a white flag 
Damn these circumstance 
Love is headed for a fall 
So before we lose it all, oh baby 
I'm sendin' up a white flag 

Place no blame, what's the use 
Lay these weapons down and call a truce 
Can't we can't we work it out work it out 
Cuz I love you baby, ain't no doubt 
Isn't that what love's about 

Sendin' up, sendin' up, sendin' up a white flag 
Love won't have a chance if all we do is fight about it 
Sendin' up, sendin' up, sendin' up a white flag 
Damn these circumstance 
Love is headed for a fall 
So before we lose it all, oh baby 
I'm sendin' up a white flag 

Repeat
I'm sendin' up a white flag
