Hey, all the neighbors lights 
Came on last night 
Just like they do every time 
We have a little fight 
It's gettin' to the point 
We can't get along 
We're always fighting about things 
That should be dead and gone 

We bury the hatchet 
But leave the handle stickin' out 
We're always diggin' up things 
We should forget about 
When it comes to forgettin' 
Baby, there ain't no doubt 
We bury the hatchet 
But leave the handle sticking out 

Well, I was kissing on Cindy 
Hey, that I won't deny 
But that's a long time ago 
I let a dead dog lie 
But if you want to cut deep 
How 'bout you and ol' Joe 
I caught you down at the creek 
Just ten years ago 
We bury the hatchet 
But leave the handle stickin' out 
We're always diggin' up things 
We should forget about 
When it comes to forgettin' 
Baby, there ain't no doubt 
We bury the hatchet 
But leave the handle sticking out 
Hey, we got enough on each other 
To wage a full scale war 
If we could ever remember 
What we were fightin' for 
We bury the hatchet 
But leave the handle stickin' out 
We're always diggin' up things 
We should forget about 
When it comes to forgettin' 
Baby, there ain't no doubt 
We bury the hatchet 
But leave the handle sticking out 
We bury the hatchet 
But leave the handle stickin' out
