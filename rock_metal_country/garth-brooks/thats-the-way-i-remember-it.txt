It's only natural with time 
Details can somehow slip your mind 
Something so sweet, though incomplete 
You fill the spaces in-between 

It never will be that way again 
Maybe it wasn't way back when 
But to my heart and soul 
This is the way the story has to be told 

That's the way that's the way I remember it 
I remember it that way 
From the day I was living there 
I remember it that way 

Some of our stories fade as we grow older 
Some get sweeter every time they're told 
That's the way that's the way I remember you that way 

Guess now if the truth were known 
Among diamonds they were stones 
To say would be fair, girl, nothing compares 
To when I called you all my own 

So darling don't ever you think twice 
Those were the best days of my life 
When I held you there 
And I'll tell this story this way, time and again 

That's the way that's the way I remember it 
I remember it that way 
From the day I was living there 
I remember it that way
