Hit the road in wander mode 
inquire along the way 
Savoir faire in full despair 
while living day to day 
My heart is not a cold cauldron of proof 
I don't ever need to prove myself to you 
No! 

Looking back I'm off the tracks 
more times than I recognize 
Mistakes are another opportunity to refine 
My heart is not a cold cauldron of proof 
I don't ever need to prove myself to you 

There's no such thing as hell 
But you can make it if you try 
There might come a day 
When emotion can be quantified 
But as of now there's no proof necessary 
no proof necessary 
no proof necessary 
no proof necessary 
it's only in your mind
