We strike first 
And we're unrehearsed 
Here we go again 
To stage the greatest show on heaven and earth 
Come on, get your money's worth 

Don't wanna live 
can't live 
Don't wanna give 
can't give 
Don't wanna be 
won't be 
E-M-P-I-R-E 
Don't wanna live 
Don't wanna be 
E-M-P-I-R-E 

We're comin on fast 
And we're built to last 
We stumbled once in 'Nam
Now we're glad to finally say 
Those days have passed 
Tell me how long can it last! 

Don't wanna live 
can't live 
Don't wanna give 
can't give 
Don't wanna be 
won't be 
E-M-P-I-R-E 
Don't wanna live 
Don't wanna be 
E-M-P-I-R-E 

We just started out 
You don't need to be afraid 
Yeah you deserve two minutes hate

Well, we spit and we cursed and our bleeding hearts burst
But even ten million souls 
Marching in February couldn't stop the worst, 
Couldn't reverse 

Don't wanna live 
Don't wanna give 
Don't wanna be 
E-M-P-I-R-E 
Don't wanna live 
Don't wanna be 
E-M-P-I-R-E 

I can't live 
If it isn't with you
