Dedication is the price you pay: the initiated are
Coddled and caged
Before you walk, as soon as you crawl
Hope is pointless 'cuz you're stuck in the trawl

Fuck the freshman lectures and brandishments
They just betray impoverished accomplishments
The puppet masters fear originality
They tighten up the tethers and they shackle your feet
Submission complete!

Young recruits never have a chance, enticed to 
The drill, admonished to dance
Early to rise and early to shine, life is long but the end is nigh

Break the guilty trammels from yesteryear
Remember how rejuvenation conquers all fears
Lowly opportunists take commanding roles
And hawk ultimatums so their weakness won't show

The sad reflection of dead ambition
You live for nothing 
Submission complete!

Yeah, break the guilty trammels from yesteryear
Remember how the taste of failure makes it all clear
The lowly opportunists take commanding roles
And hawk ultimatums so their weakness won't show

The sad reflection of dead ambition
You live for nothing

Expectation, indoctrination
Life's a damnation
Submission complete!

Dying on your feet
Submission complete
A total defeat
