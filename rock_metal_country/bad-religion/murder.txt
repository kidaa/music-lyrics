If you're discontent to know you world's a pile of shit,
Listen to a riddle that'll tickle every bit of it,

HA HA HA!

Ape shall not murder - Ape wasn't so sure
Bad ape you made a mistake,
Annihilation in a cannibal war!
Well cultivation might have served you
Might have raised you up unscathed
If you had called that fucker by its name!

Did you listen to the arbiter's beck and call?
Did you find what you were looking for or not at all?

NOT AL ALL!

Ape shall not murder - Ape take the cure
Bad ape you made a mistake,
Annihilation in a cannibal war!
Culture might have cured you
And raised you up unscathed
If you had called that fucker by its name!

Say the name!
Say the name!
Say the name!
