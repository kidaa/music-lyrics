lie lie lie... the full moon is rising over dark water and the fools
below are picking up sticks and the man in the gallows lies
permanently waiting for the doctors to come back and tend to him, the
flat earth society is meeting here today, singing happy little lies
and the bright ship humana is sent far away with grave
determination... and no destination, lie lie lie... yeah, nothing
feels better than a spray of clean water and the whistling wind on a
calm summer night but you'd better believe that down in their quarters
the men are holding on for their dear lives, the flat earth society is
somewhere far away, with their candlesticks and compasses and the
bright ship humana is well on its way with grave determination... and
no destination, lie lie lie, ad inifinitum
