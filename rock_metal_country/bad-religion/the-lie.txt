How do you know what you can be 
if you can't see where you are going 
What breaks the silence Misery 
Can make you see where you belong 
It's a dangerous stage but the show must go on 

Why do you lie 
Why do you lie 
Would you betray your soul 
Why do you lie 
Why do you lie 
Don't let your weakness show 
You just might be the last to know 

Freedom is such a loaded word 
So full of hurt and such a plomb 
Loneliness saunters in its breeze 
Like a disease it drags along 
The time of your life can't be had for a song 

Why do you lie 
Why do you lie 
Would you betray your soul 
Why do you lie 
Why do you lie 
Don't let your weakness show 
You just might be the last to know 

Why do you lie 
Why do you lie 
Would you betray your soul 
Why do you lie 
Why do you lie 
Don't let your weakness show 
Why do you lie 
Why do you lie 
Only the meek follow 
Why do you lie 
Why do you lie 
Trample the fear below 
You just might be the last to know
