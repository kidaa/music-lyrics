Hey you 
Is there something worth aspiring to 
And can it be found in a record store 
Well it's not there anymore 
Just think of all the things we did 
We were different 
Just like all the other kids 

Missy was a teen blue video star 
Tom took his life in his mother's car 
Milo went to college but you knew about that 
Rodney played our record 
GG started riots 
Laurie was always quiet 
She was battling depression 

Hey you 
Is there something worth belonging to 
And can I pick it up for a song 
Or a diploma or a worthy cause 
Well let me tell you that there's nothing wrong 
It's just that ones like us will never belong 

Jack wore a skirt but he knew how to scrap 
Billy went to county on a class one possession 
Wendy went to school while her daddy shot smack 
Eugene kept a list 
Mugger was security 
Mary she kept her purity 
We were all in it together 

Yellowed postcards on the wall 
Serve to cover up a blankness after all 
So I will carry them along 
Like a song when I'm gone yeah 

Hey you 
Is there something worth belonging to 
You know we've been here all along 
Like a confederacy of the wrong 
And I confess it could be prejudice 
But to you I dedicate this song 
Yeah to you
