Every day we profit so
leaning toward the great unknown
asking how it pertains to tomorrow
aim for places we've not been
trample paths that go between
yesterdays foundations and tomorrow
it's the way they say it's got to be
we spear ahead and forge our destiny
who do they represent?
who do you belive?
make a sound decision for others to heed
try to set a faster pace
try to build a master race
one that will make a contribution to tomorrow
it's the way they say it's got to be
we put aside our fears and make history
the clothes are in the dryer and the writing is on the wall
we're trying everything we can to stop this fall
everyday we profit so
leaning toward the great unknown
