i know a man
who doesnt have many friends
i know a place he lives
where trouble never ends
i know its hard for him
to read 'tween the lines
and his days are getting so much shorter
he simply turns away
instead of bearing down
his ship is crumbling
his crew is one of clowns
he doesnt care
as long as he can wear the crown
i know this man all too well
its my poor friend me
a portrayal of the great dichotomy
a reminder of a tragic history
its my poor friend me
and im running out of steam
i know there are people
who are cynical and vane
they point their finger
'cuz they can't accept the blame
they live their lives
under a blanket of shame and their progeny
crawl from underneath it
lately i've come
to see the solution
and it begins with me
but i'm so fallibly human
i've picked the lot
