You're obsesssed and distressed 
Cause you can't make any sense of the ludicrous nonsense 
and incipient senescence 
that will deem your common sense useless 
this aint no recess! 

I want to believe in you, but my plan keeps falling through 
I knoe I have to face the harshnes, grin and bear the truth 
And I have to walk this mile in my own shoes 
and I'm no fool! 

[Chorus]
I'm materialist 
a full-blown realist 
physical theorist 
and I guess I'm full of doubt 
so I'm prone to hear you out and refuse 
I'm materialist 
There ain't no fear in this 
it's for all to see, so don't talk of hidden mysteries with me... 

Mind over matter, it really don't matter 
If the street's idle chatter turns your heart strings to tatters 
Flatter hopes don't flatter and soul batter won't congeal to mend 
a life that is shattered into shards 
Was it in the cards 

The process of belief is an elixir when you're weak 
I must confess, at times I indulge it on the sneak 
but generally my outlook's not so bleak 
and I'm not meek! 

[Chorus]
I'm materialist 
a full-blown realist 
physical theorist 
and I guess I'm full of doubt, 
but I'll gladly have it out with you 
I'm materialist 
I ain't no deist 
it's there for all to see, so don't of hidden mysteries with me 

Like Rome under Nero, our future's one big zero 
Recycling the past to meet the immediate needs 
And through it all we ramble forth with perservere and climb 
Our mountains of regret to sow our seeds 

I'm materialist 
I'm materiliast 
I'm materialist 
I'm materialist hold
