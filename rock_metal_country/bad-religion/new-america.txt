do you know the cost of future misery
have you lost your sense of sustainability
we are just a step away
from realizing what we strive to be
but we've got to break out
from this insulated blind and lame senility
wake up the new america
wo-oh!
transcend the mass hysteria
wo-oh!
change is the thing you're wary of
wo-oh!
we need a new america
wo-oh!
laurels, human triumph,
bestowments from the past
victories don't mean a thing
if they don't last
we are just marching toward extinction
with blinders on our eyes
jeopardizing everything
we've learned and come to realize
you call that wise
open your eyes america
wo-oh!
see through the lies they tell to us
wo-oh!
confront the fears that worry us
wo-oh!
we need a new america
wo-oh!
we don't have to be afraid to re-invent
we've got to start to build,
progress, and implement
for when we take our fill,
and never pay the price
we only build ourselves a fleeting,
false paradise
you can live in staunch denial
and mark me as your enemy
but I'm just a voice among the throng
who want a brighter destiny
they say with me
we are the new america
wo-oh!
this is the new america
wo-oh
