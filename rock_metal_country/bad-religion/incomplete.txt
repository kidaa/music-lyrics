mother, father, look at your little monster,
I'm a hero, I'm a zero,
I'm the butt of the worst joke in history,
I'm a lock without a key,
a city with no door, a prayer without faith,
a show without a score,
I'm a bad word, a wink, a nod, a shiver,
an untold story, sex without fury,
a creeping gray memory,
I am incomplete....incomplete....incomplete....incomplete

doctor, cure me; what is the cause of my condition,
this madness shoots me,
like bullets smashing glass in a silent movie,
I'm a trap without a spring,
a temple with no god,
a jack without an ace,
the tip of your tongue,
I'm a promise, an unmailed letter,
an unbuilt motor, deck without a joker,
a creeping gray memory
I am incomplete....incomplete....incomplete....incomplete

tell Saint Peter not to bet on me,
I got a naked obsession,
a good intention gone bad,
I am incomplete....incomplete....incomplete....incomplete
