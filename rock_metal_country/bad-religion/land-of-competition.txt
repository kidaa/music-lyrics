See there's a girl who's afraid of the world so she stays at home.
Next there's a boy who seems so lost in his joy, he's all alone.
The camera's on them, they're in the land of competition.
Southern California air feeds them.
And they know they are best 'cuz of the way they are dressed,
But you can bet you are not welcome in their home.
See there's a girl who sits and watches the world from her blue screen.
Also a boy who truly wants to destroy his hometown scene.
They both want to travel to the land of competition.
Southern California will destroy them,
And they won't be the best, they'll be the poseurs who dress
Like the plastic idiots who they copy.
Tell me what do you need to make you happy Indeed, is it out of your reach
Beware of number one, see all the damage it has done, there are so few of them.
You won't find to many in the land of competition.
Southern California doesn't breed them.
If you just want the best turn to yourself for the rest
And forget about the ones who "have it all."
Be careful of the ones who "have it all."
Be careful of the ones who "have it all."
Forget about the ones who "have it all."
