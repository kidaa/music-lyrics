It's all right to have faith in god
But when you bend to their rules and their fucking lies
That's when I start to have pity on you.

You're living on a mound of dirt,
But you can't explain your reason for existence
So you blame it on god.

So much hatred in this world and you can't decide
Who's pulling the strings
So you figure it's god.

Your whole life foreshadows death
And you finally realize you don't want to die alone
So you'll always have god.

It's all right to have faith in god
But when you bend to their rules and their fucking lies
That's when I start to have pity on you.

It's all right to have faith in god
But when you bend to their rules and their fucking lies
That's when I start to have pity on you.

There's people in the world today
Who say they're Jewish, Christian and such,
They're all ignorant fools.

They'll tell you you can't have your own way
unless you pay money and dedicate your life
Or you'll be damned in hell.

Don't be feeble like all of them,
You have your own brain full of thoughts and choices,
So use it don't let them use you.

It's all right to have faith in god
But when you bend to their rules and their fucking lies
That's when I start to have pity on you.
