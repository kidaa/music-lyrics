I'm incurable but durable it's easy to see 
Lack of restraint is a complaint of those around me 
I know that others postpone 
Gratification well I lack that affectation 

Let's get it right 
there's no end in sight 
And I 
Can't stop 
Can't stop 
Can't stop it 
Can't stop 
Can't stop 
Can't stop shocking but I just can't stop it 
That's right 

Uncontrollable 
I'm inconsolable 
My pleasure center is the shelter for a reptile 
I hate when I gotta tolerate 
Frustration see I lack the motivation 

Let's set this straight 
I never wait 
And I 
Can't stop 
Can't stop 
Can't stop it 
Can't stop 
Can't stop 
Can't stop shocking but I just can't stop it 
That's right
