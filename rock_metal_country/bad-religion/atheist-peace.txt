Maybe it's too late for an intellectual debate, 
but a residue of confusion remains. 

Changing with the times, 
and developmentally tortured minds
are the average citizen's sources of pain.

Tell me what we're fighting for 
I don't remember anymore, 
only temporary reprieve 

And the world might cease 
if we fail to tame the beast 
from the faith that you release 
comes an atheist peace. 

Atheist peace. 

Political forces rent
bitter cold winds of discontent
and the modern age emerged triumphantly.
But now it seems we've stalled
And it's time to de-evolve 
and relive the dark chapters of history 

Tell me what we're fighting for 
No progress ever came from war, 
only a false sense of increase 

and the world won't wait 
for the truth upon a plate 
but we're ready now to feast on an atheist peace. 

Atheist peace
