Not long ago, and yet the image is so vague 
I hesitate to label it a memory 
There was a show of local color and I felt astray
Cause I had nothing to offer but insufficiency 

And you know that it's such a bitch 
When you learn to scratch that itch 
Of blatant fallibility 
Sooner to some, but eventually 
All gets pointed in the same direction 
While the human masses and their vague conceptions
Obliterate each other with impunity 
And you wonder, what's in this for me? 

To another abyss 
To no avail 
The search is bound to fail 
To another abyss 
To no avail 
So long ago I set sail 
And it chills me to the bone 
That I'm so far away from home 
To another abyss 

So what should I do now? What should I celebrate? 
Given finite means and a penchant to depreciate 
How can I still avow and depend upon a state 
That cares nothing for my happiness, welfare, or fate? 

And I know I can't explain 
The commotion in my brain 
Like a terrifying reality 
Deconstructed but inadequately 
All gets pointed in the same direction 
While the human masses and their vain conceptions 
Obliterate each other with impunity 
And release the weight of history 

[Chorus]

So long ago, so long agooh, I set sail 
And I'm struggling on the way 
And I'm waiting for the day to another abyss 
And I'm looking for the way back home to another abyss 
So far away to another abyss 
So far away to another abyss 
to another abyss So far away 
to another abyss
