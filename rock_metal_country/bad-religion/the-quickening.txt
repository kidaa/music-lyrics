The quickening is an ephemeral thing 
That only happens in the dark 
Like catching lightning in a jar 
And the pain that it brings 
Is just the promise of spring 
It's madness on the way 
Oh, what does it mean 

To come alive 
To come alive 
To come alive 
To come alive
To come alive 
To come alive 
To come alive 

The entering is soulful conjecturing 
Oh, lost and by the wind grieved ghost 
Come back to me again 
Because the way that she bleeds 
Is in the law that he reads
Confusing words and deeds 
So what does it mean 

[Chorus]

To pierce the vein of the sacred and profane 
Poor science, in service of a faith 
But who will bear the mark of Cain? 

[Chorus]
