Porcelain and alabaster, decaying ever faster, 
Unaware of imminent disaster open up your eyes.

As you ruminate the hopeless sands of time, 
Did you wander out your days lost and resigned?
Or recreate the universals in your mind?

Everybody is bastard: my world is like plaster
Crumbling apart from pressure of the blaster, waiting for a sign

And the momentary pleasures take their turn
As a wistful boy runs out of things to learn, 
The episodes of yore are never to return.

Scare up some hope, you're gonna need it just to cope,
You are the decision, numbers don't lie
When you bite the dust, was it for purpose or for trust?

You'll never relive it, think before you die.
Yeah, think! Think before you die.

Deficit and depravation - in the wake of desperation
Rewrite the morals, rectify the nation. 
Now may be your time!

As you ruminate the hopeless sands of time, 
Do you wonder how your life has been defined?
You know eternity can't ever change your mind.
You know eternity can't ever change your mind

So think! Think before you die!
Yeah, think! Think before you die
