Long ago in a dusty village
full of hinger, pain and strife
a man came forth with a vision of truth
and the way to a better life
he was convinced he had the answer
and he complelled people to follow along
but the hunger never vansihed
and the man was banished
and the village dried up and died
at a time when wise men peered
through glass tubes toward the sky
the heavens changed in predictable ways
and one man was able to find
that he had thought he found the answer
and he was quick to write his revelation
but as they were scutinized
in his colleagues eyes
he soon became a mockery
don't tell me the answer
I've got ideas too
but if you've got enough naivete
and you've got conviction
then the answer is perfect for you
an urban sprawl sits choking on its discharge
overwhelmed by industry
searching for a modern day savior from another place
inclined toward charity
everyone's begging for an answer
without regard to validity
the searching never ends
it goes on and on for eternity
