Oh yeah! 
A study of history reveals an unflagging appeal to mystery 
You talk about abstraction at the top of the list 
But you might as well get pissed, cause in me the essence does not exist, no-oh-oh 
Yeah yeah! 
You're so shallow 
How can your romance hope to be the veil of an ersatz human nature 
That can pacify but never slept well when there's the pretension of living a lie 

Take me as I am, judge me for my crimes 
I can say I'll behave freely all the time 
You can predict what I'll say, it's in my DNA 
But soon I'll be a catalogue number anyway 

So say a little prayer 
Convince yourself that someone cares 
All I am is what you see 
There is nothing more than the surface of me [x2], 

you know 

Oh yeah! 

Apologies to Skinner, but I do believe that I feel like I'm a winner 
Having just discovered a long solved modal secret, of how I always feel 
So goddamn downtrodden and desperate 

Take me as I am, judge me for my crimes 
I can say I'll behave freely all the time 
You can predict what I'll say, it's in my DNA 
But soon I'll be a catalogue number anyway 

So say a little prayer 
Convince yourself that someone cares 
All I am is what you see 
There is nothing more than the surface of me [x6]

What you see is the surface of me
