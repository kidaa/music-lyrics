There'a light on in the hallway
so I can't understand
why you hide underneath the covers
there's a baby in your womb
so don't be scared tonight
because Raggedy ann is in the closet picking posies
two babies in the dark
like diamonds in the sand
while pap's far away making children's stories
the little one's inside
so afraid to be alone
she's trying to brave until the daddy comes home
so if you chance to see her
please tell her it's alright
'cause everyone fights the tendency to snap
sometimes it's not a matter
of being brave and strong
'cause noises in the house are terrifying
I'll put you to sleep at night
like a foreign movie
I'll sing you lullabies
and I'll teach you about everything
and I'll only ask you one thing
please save me
