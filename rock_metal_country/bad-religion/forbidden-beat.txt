There was a boy who had too many toys and an ache inside of his bones.
He sought extrication through chemical vocation and now he answers to Jones.
It's deadly and alluring, the sound of pounding heat,
Enslaving all who dare succumb to the temptations of the forbidden beat.
Thinking today of what I want to say, thinking of inhibition and vice.
What they call straight I do relegate as I cautiously saltate along.
It's deadly and alluring, the sound of pounding heat,
Enslaving all who dare succumb to the temptations of the forbidden beat.
It thunders away at first light of each day and the simpleton lifestyle evolves
But soon enters dusk as the last surrey rusts and a new day upon us results.
It's deadly and alluring, the sound of pounding heat,
Enslaving all who dare succumb to the temptations of the forbidden beat.
