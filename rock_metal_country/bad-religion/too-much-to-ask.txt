A refreshing plunge
a drink of platable water
a deep inspiration on a warm summer day
a safe stroll in the middle of the road community
a neighbor who in times of need will not turn away
I ain't no politiciam
I am a citizen
And I wonder if I'm living too far out of bounds
community protection
rehibilitation
police that serve without legitimate right to maim
global aareness
ecological guilt
cultural and environmental awakening
I ain't no optimist
I try to be a realist
and I think that we are living too far out of bounds
is it too much to ask?
Could it be the world is shrinking?
I can see the walls closing in
no one can take much for granted anymore
remote control
three cars for every family
corruption at the expense of the simple majority
a violent crash
a plunder of the third world
any wretched ploy that bolsters our economy
I ain't no blind supporter
I'm a conscious citizen
and I know that we are living too far out of bounds
is it too much to ask?
can we keep the earth from sinking?
I can see the walls closing in
No one can take much for granted anymore
you better not take it for granted anymore
I'm not taking nothing for granted anymore
