It's superficial progress, they call it liberation.
With opiates of silicon, Big Brother schemes to rule the nation.
We're one nation under God, we stand above the rest;
With mighty high technology, we're never second best.
Our specialty is infiltration!
Prepare yourself for subjugation,
Victory through domination.

The trepidatious throngs all fears the big eye in the sky.
The government observes them with their own electric eye.
We're one nation under God, we stand above the rest;
With mighty high technology, we're never second best.
Our specialty is infiltration!
Prepare yourself for subjugation.
Automatons, illiterates, and indigents of every shape and size
Don't stop but aid this cruel crusade, participate in their own demise.
We're one nation under God, we stand above the rest;
With mighty high technology, we're never second best.
Our specialty is infiltration!
So pack your bags you third-world nation,
Victory through domination.
