all good soldiers crack like boulders
The sun climbs up to a razon,
violins, new boots, and numbers on a chain
All good soldiers
all good soldiers fall in line
when they march and shout-
are a spectacle
marching and singing-
will go abnywhere the president says-
because the president believes in god-
like all good soldiers wait like warheads-
When the fighting starts who will
be accountable, a cannibal, a cannoball
It's six A.M. I can see my breath
and the clay dirt
is laughing at the weekling boy-
today is the day
that I'll write my friends
its something I've been
trying to remenber-
I had a dream of a wall
that was twenty-one stories tall...
All good soldiers fall in line
when they march and shout-
are a respectable
marching and signing-
will go anywhere the president says-
because the president believes in god-
like all good soldiers should
