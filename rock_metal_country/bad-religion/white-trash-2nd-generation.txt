Wasted children, fixed blank eyes, blood and sweat, we socialize
Broken homes from which they come, beer-stained dad, compliant Mom.
Fear and love, much despised, replaced by comfortable lies.
Teenage classic, more cliche, one step further on the edge of decay.
White trash, 2nd generation, white trash, 2nd generation,
White trash, 2nd generation, don your crown and cleanse the nation.
Are you ready to fight for your morality Right wing allies, white supremacy.
Pretty fascist on the tube draped in red and white and blue
White trash, 2nd generation, stupid foibles, indignation
Offspring of suburban fright, pearl-white creatures of the night
White trash, 2nd generation, white trash, 2nd generation,
White trash, 2nd generation, don your crown and cleanse the nation.
Stiff blue collar, coat and tie, brand new breeds side by side.
Christian ethic, right extremes, shoved down our throat as the American Dream.
White trash, 2nd generation, stupid foibles, indignation
Offspring of suburban fright, pearl-white creatures of the night
White trash, 2nd generation, white trash, 2nd generation,
White trash, 2nd generation, don your crown and cleanse the nation.
White trash, 2nd generation, white trash, 2nd generation,
White trash, 2nd generation, don your crown and cleanse the nation.
