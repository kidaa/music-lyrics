I'm sorry about the sun,
how could I know that you'd burn,
and I'm sorry about the moon,
how could I know that you'd disapproved,
I'll never make the same mistake,
the next time I create the universe
I'll make sure we communicate at length
but until then . . . better off dead,
a smile on the lips and a hole in the head,
better off dead, yeah better than this,
better off dead, yeah better than this,
take it away cuz there's nothing to miss
I'm sorry about the world,
how could I know you'd take it so bad,
and I'll never make the same mistake,
the next time I create the universe
I'll make sure you participate
But until then . . .
Better off dead, yeah better off dead,
why don't you try pushing daisies instead
and I'll never make the same mistake,
the next time I create the universe
I'll make sure we communicate, just in case.
