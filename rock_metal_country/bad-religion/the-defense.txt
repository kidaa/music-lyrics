Nothing comes easier than madness in the world today 
Mass paranoia is a mode not a melody 
Yeah I'd like to watch all thousand cable channels but there's nothing on 
And my high speed connection's monitored daily by the pentagon 
These things are seldom what they seem 
I'm not inclined to enjoy my dreams 
won't go away 

No Peace and No Friends 
We Trace the mortal edge with no defense 
To State the obvious 
This world is perilous for us 
No sense and No Guide 
ain't it beautiful to be alive Yeah right 
I won't resign before the struggle ends 
So I'll construct this sound defense 

We are the prey and culture is the predator 
I'm running out of time where conditions are positionnal 
Shadows of a doubt cast reluctance and depravity 
There's got to be a way to overcome this grim reality 
Is there an option left for me 
I'm not immune to despondency 
There's no way 

No Peace and No Friends 
We Trace the mortal edge with no defense 
To State the obvious 
This world is perilous for us 
No sense and No Guide 
ain't it beautiful to be alive Yeah right 
I won't resign before the struggle ends 
So I'll construct this sound defense 

There's a signpost on the corner 
and it keeps everybody safe 
We were all made in the shade 
And your mother's in the kitchen 
where she's patching all the cracks in the wall 
We never had to care in the world 

Too much to sacrifice 
it's hard to recognize 
Just a compromise of purely deadly alibies 
It's combinational 
the pressure so intense 
So I'll construct this sound defense 

Nothing's plainer than the madness in the world today 
I must conceal myself and steal myself and break away 
I seek initiatives in matters that are black and white 
So I'll construct this sound defense
