let your mind wander,
look beyond the shadows
focus on the skyline,
read the silhouettes
your deepest desires
are a picture of tomorrow
all your darkest fears
are just a vestige of regret
and it's wo-oh oh oh
it seems like such a long way to go
as obstacles get bigger,
prevailing winds blow stronger
and the fire continues to grow
don't let shallow water limit your perception
heed the new horizon,
muster to it fast
the moments of your yesterdays
are in the wake behind you
you can't assess the future
if you're living in the past
keep it stoked!
if you are committed
to a life of understanding
then there's no agenda
for vengeance in your life
sharpen all your senses,
face the opposition
you can overcome
with fortitude and mental might
the fire continues to grow,
in your soul
so be bold, let it grow
don't let it die
let it burn!
