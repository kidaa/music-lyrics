Well am I making haste or could it be haste is making me 
What's time but a thing to kill or keep or buy or lose or live in 
I gotta go faster 
Keep up the pace 
Just to stay in the human race 

I could go supersonic 
the problem's chronic 
Tell me does life exist beyond it 
When I need to sate 
I just accelerate 
Into oblivion 
Into oblivi yah yah yah yah yah yah yan 

Now here I go again 
everything is alien 
How does it feel to be outstripped by the pace of cultural change 
My deeds are senseless 
and rendered meaningless 
When measured in that vein 

I could go supersonic 
the problem's chronic 
Tell me does life exist beyond it 
When I need to sate 
I just accelerate into oblivion 
Into oblivion 

I won't lie 
it's exciting 
When I try 
to decide things 
I just want to live 
decently 
meaningfully 
I'm in misery 

I could I go supersonic 
the problem's chronic 
Tell me does life exist beyond it 
When I need to sate 
I just accelerate into oblivion 
Into oblivi yah yah yah yah yah yah yan
