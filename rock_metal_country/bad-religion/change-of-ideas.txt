Well the sheaves have all been brought, but the fields have washed away,
And the palaces now stand where the coffins all were laid,
And the times we see ahead, we must glaze with rozy hues,
For what don't wish to admit what it is we have to lose.
Millenia in coming, the modern age is here.
It sanctifies the future, yet renders us with fear.
So many theories, so many prophecies,
What we do need is a change of ideas.
When we are scared we can hide in our reveries but
What we need is a change of ideas.
Change of ideas, change of ideas,
What we need now is a change of ideas.
