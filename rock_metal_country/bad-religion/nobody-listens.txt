hey mister, don't point at me
you shout rhetoric nonsense like a Pavlovian model
responding to his questions

hey teacher, arrogance is bliss
you spend your time turning water into life
as if you were God's foreman

is it any wonder
things seem so awry
the masses are cloaked in confusion
we don't have to think to survive
so nobody listens

hey recluse, dont shout at me
you proclaim yourself expert by extensions of the methods
detailed in your magazines

hey downer, don't prey on me
we've all got bum raps that torment us day to day
that we hoist on our own shoulders

is it any wonder
people pass you by
your plea for understanding
is heard as desperate lies
nobody listens

I can't help you...

is it any wonder
things are so inane
so many quests for compassion
are just for someone's personal gain

so nobody listens to you
