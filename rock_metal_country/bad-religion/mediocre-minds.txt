Look around the country, an abundance you'll find of
Mediocre minds
Sift trough the fodder as the sane justice declines because of
Mediocre minds
Shrouded under cover, the most flamboyant guise hides a
Mediocre mind
You got yours but you can never bend mine with your
Mediocre minds
When the cry foul you had better watch out becaus you never know which
aptitude they'r griping about
Don't act too smart for their stenoscopic ways
You'll be discarded away
Reason's not to be what the privileged define with their
Mediocre minds
So many sighted people act so helplessly
Blind from their
Mediocre minds
If you want attention then you will be asked to bend but the surest
insurrection is enlightenment
Then you can live outside inharmoniously
An enemy
They wanna keep me locked away
`Cuz I'm an overactive brain
Leaders, presidents and the nightly news guys cater to
Mediocre minds
Reason's not to be what the privileged define with their
Mediocre minds
You got yours but you can never bend mine with your
Mediocre minds
The only natural thing that I despise are
Mediocre minds
