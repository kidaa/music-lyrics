I hate my family, hate my school, speed limits and the golden rule.
Hate people who aren't what they seem, more than anything else, American Dream.
American Dream's gonna swallow you whole, it's bursting at the seam,
It'll sweep you away, so enjoy it today, tomorrow you'll be old thus useless.
American Dream... American Dream....
American Dream, that's ok, 'cause no one dare give you away.
I hate my job, I hate your god, I hate hypocrites and common slobs.
Hate people who aren't what they seem, more than anything else, American Dream.
Promise me today I'll have a Chevrolet, with whitewalls on the side,
One boy, one girl, comfortable lies
The American Dream... American Dream...
American Dream, that's ok, 'cause no one dare give you away.
American Dream!
bleah!
