I was born on planet earth
the rotating ball where man comes first
it4s been around for a long, long time
but now it4s time to watch it die

I saw a man on my big blue screen
he ruled the world economy
he said the rich would never concede
but some day soon he4ll be put to sleep

I4ve seen the life of the forest green
and adaptations of the deep blue seas
and who knows who is the fittest
they will all soon be put to rest

On a plunging flight and we4re sitting
in the pilots seat in the midst of life
people on a dark horizon praying
somebody will save their lives

I was born on planet earth
at a drastic time full of plastic mirth
and everyday I4ve seen increasing signs
and you would too if you4d opened your eyes
you had a chance you did not try
so now it4s time to watch it die
