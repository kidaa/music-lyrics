He's the latest superhero with powers so profound.
He can leap a dotted line in just a single bound.
I know you must have seen him in books and magazines.
He's the quintessential mindless modern epicine.
His life is meaningful because he gets things done.
Bang bang he's dead, chalk up another triumph for our hero,
The Automatic Man.
It's true you must have met him, he's your best friend and your foe.
His opinions are determined by the status quo.
A true creature of habit, he smokes three packs a day.
When he has an original thought, he forgets it right away.
He's a paradigm of carefree living.
He's our mentor, disturb him if you can.
He's the answer if your peace of mind is lacking.
He's our savior, he is the common man.
So if you are troubled by the daily bump and grind,
Then take a careful look around and brother you will find...
The Automatic Man.
