It's a matter of prescience 
No, not the science fiction kind 
It's all about ignorance, 
and greed, and miracles for the blind 
the media parading, disjointed politics 
founded on petrochemical plunder 
and we're its hostages 

If you stand to reason 
you're in the game 
the rules might be elusive 
but our pieces are the same 
and you know if one goes down we all go down as well 
the balance is precarious as anyone can tell 
this world's going to hell 

Don't allow 
this mythologic hopeful monster to exact its price 
Kyoto now! 
We can't do nothing and I think someone else will make it right 

You might not think it matters now 
But what if you are wrong 
You might not think there's any wisdom in a fucked up punk rock song 
But the way it is 
cannot persist for long 
a brutal sun is rising on a sick horizon 

It's in the way 
we live our lives 
exactly like the double-edge of a cold familiar knife 
and supremacy weighs heavy on the day 
it's never really what you own but what you threw away 
and how much did you pay 

In your dreams 
You saw a steady state a bounty for eternity 
Silent screams 
but now the wisdom that sustains us is in full retreat 
Don't allow 
this mythologic hopeful monster isn't worth the risk 
Kyoto now! 
We can't have vision for the future if it can't be fixed 
Alien 
We need a fresh and new religion to run our lives 
Hand in hand 
the arid torpor of inaction will be our demise 

Oh, Kyoto now!
