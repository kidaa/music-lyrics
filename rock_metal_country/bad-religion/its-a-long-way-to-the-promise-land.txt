it's a long way to the promise land
so you'd better well know your way
where's a ship on the ocean
and an albatross who is trying to lead you astray
leaders, politicians, and power whores
are in line to receive your choice
and you bet your ass, if you give it to them,
they will gladly take your voice
and it's a long way to the promise land
wo-oh oh oh oh
it's a long way to the promise land,
if we work we might find it here
there's no substitute for enlightenment,
there's no reason for bridled fear
when you join the people who've joined the club
you gotta clench and play your hand
cuz if you fall in line you're gonna fall in time
and you'll never make a stand
it's a long way to the promise land
wo-oh oh oh oh
what are you going to do
when they call for you
bend and capitulate
or keep your head on straight
easy answers bought without experience,
is gonna lead you to certain doom
because the truth is just what you make of it,
it begins and ends with you!
and it's a long way to the promise land
wo-oh oh oh oh
