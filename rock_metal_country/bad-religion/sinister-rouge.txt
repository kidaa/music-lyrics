Innocents burned, 
alive at the stake
Tortured and dumped
In nameless graves
Centuries wane
Authority died
Scattering seeds of ancient lies

Sinister rouge
Coming back for more
To even the score
Sinister rouge
Coming back for more
To even the score

Child molesters
And Jesuits 
Holding secret conference
Underneath the pontiff's nose
And only God will ever know

Sinister rouge
Coming back for more
To even the score
Sinister rouge
Coming back for more
To even the score

Give us this day
Our daily bread
Your legacy 
We'll not forget
Lick the wounds
Cleanse the land
The modern world
Rejects your hand

Sinister rouge
Coming back for more
To even the score
Sinister rouge
Coming back for more
To even the score

Sinister rouge
The nightmare comes in sinister rouge
