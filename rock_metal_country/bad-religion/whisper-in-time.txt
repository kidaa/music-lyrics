all those stories that my dad told me,
they are just a whisper in time
all those things that never came to be,
they are just a whisper in time
a whisper in time, a whisper in time
things that I can't shake from my mind
a whisper in time, a whisper in time
moments that just flicker and die
memories that flicker and die
all those places I wanted to go,
they are just a whisper in time
all those friends who now I do not know,
they are just a whisper in time
maps and roads that brought me here today,
they are just a whisper in time
circumstances that were explained away,
they are just a whisper in time
...we are messengers of memory,
just whispers in time
