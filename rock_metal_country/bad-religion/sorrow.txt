Father can you jear me
How have I let you down
I curse the day that I was born
and all the sorrow in this world

Let me take you to the herding ground 
where all good men are trampled down
Just to settle a bet that could not be won 
between a brightful father and his son

Will you guide me now for I can't see a reason 
for the suffering and this long misery
What if every living soul could be upright and strong 
Well then I do imagine

There will be sorrow
Yeah there will be sorrow
And there will be sorrow no more

When all soldiers lay their weapons down 
or when all kings and all queens relinquish their crowns
Or when the only true messiah rescues us 
from ourselves it's easy to imagine

There will be sorrow
Yeah there will be sorrow
And there will be sorrow no more

There will be sorrow
Yeah there will be sorrow
And there will be sorrow no more

Yeah there will be sorrow
Yeah there will be sorrow
And there will be sorrow no more
