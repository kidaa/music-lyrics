shut off the t.v. and peel off those sunday gloves, and i'll stain the
clean that you've been counting, old mr. fletcher passed by here
today, after 40 years of toil he just stood up and walked away,
fantastic the panic that showed in his eyes, he shrugged when i asked
him about it, he said "young man pay heed, you listen well to what i
say, now there comes a time for a man to walk away", walk away, i'll
be a parade, and i'll be determined that no one shall dissuade on my
way, i'll sure take some time to burn all the bridges that i'm leaving
behind, he passed by again and he was shivering from the cold, i'm not
sure but i think that he was trying, he told me about the weather and
something old to pay, "but tomorrow", he said, "i'm gonna surely walk away"
