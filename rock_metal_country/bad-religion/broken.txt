She said 
Thanks but I'm broken 
I guess 
You must have misspoken 
What a laugh 
I've never been chosen by anyone 

She was barely a teen 
Hanging out in between 
Just a part of the scene 
With mercurial smile 
And incurable style 
She was only a dream 
How's that 
He didn't know a thing about 
Making love to the kind of girl you read about 

He said 
I'm bound to be broken 
My Daddy bet 
That I'd amount to nothing 
He won't let anybody show him anything 

He was a troubled child 
Had been down for a while 
Always kept to himself 
No she couldn't defend 
He only wanted a friend 
Now he's made something else 
It's so sad no one saw it coming 
The paper said that he hit the ground running 

Oh yeah 
I know I'm not broken 
A little cracked 
But still I'm not broken 
I wanna laugh but I think that I'm choking on reality 

When the 
World is turning for you 
Don't turn on me 
Who are you here to repair 
Well I don't know what you mean 
You could never resist 
Glorifying despair 
Well now it's coming to you and I don't really care 

Well I'm not 
The kind to insist 
You couldn't have missed 
We must co exist 
So please listen to me 
There is no such thing as human debris 

Oh yeah 
I know I'm not broken 
A little cracked 
But dad I'm not so nothing 
I wanna laugh 
I'm not joking 

I'm unbroken 
Oh yeah I said I'm unbroken 
I said I'm unbroken 
A little cracked it's just a token 
I'm really not broken 
What a guess I'm unbroken
