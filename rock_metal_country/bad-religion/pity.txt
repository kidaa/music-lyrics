I show pity on the human race,
On the ignorant plenty who devote their lives
To an icon that they've never known.
I show pity on eons past,
When early man started the first civilization
And human aggression was born.
I show pity on the future to come,
When the government system will be omnipotent
And we'll be worse off... than we are now!
Pity, pity, on the billions of ignorant people.
Pity, pity, on the masses of aggression.
Pity, pity, on the future centuries to come,
on the billions of ignorant people,
on the future centuries to come,
on the masses of aggression.
It's all a matter of looking at the past.
It's all a question, are we gonna last
If we endure the aggression that's inside all of us
We'll wipe out our own species and thus... the world!
Pity!
Pity on...
on the masses of aggression,
on the billions of ignorant people,
on the future centuries to come,
on the masses of ignorant people,
on the future centuries to come.
