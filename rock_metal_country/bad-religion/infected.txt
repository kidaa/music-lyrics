now here I go,
hope I don't break down,
I won't take anything, I don't need anything,
don't want to exist, I can't persist,
please stop before I do it again,
just talk about nothing, let's talk about nothing,
let's talk about no one, please talk about no one, someone, anyone

you and me have a disease,
you affect me, you infect me,
I'm afflicted, you're addicted,
you and me, you and me

I'm on the edge,
get against the wall,
I'm so distracted,
I love to strike you,
here's my confession,
you learned your lesson,
stop me before I do it again

you're clear - as a heavy lead curtain want to drill you - like an ocean,
we can work it out, I've been running out, now I'm running out

don't be mad about it baby,
you and me, you and me,
I want to tie you, crucify you,
kneel before you, revile your body,
you and me, we're made in heaven,
I want to take you, I want to break you,
supplicate you, are incurable,
I want to bathe you in holy water I want to kill you,
upon the alter, you and me, you and me
