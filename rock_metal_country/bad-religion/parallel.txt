sleeping on a time bomb, staring into space
there's an ocean of unpleasantries we are not prepared to face

sitting on the fence post to watch the storm roll in
and terrified of the damage it will bring when it begins
it will begin

splintered dreams of unity our lives are parallel
so far from reality our lives are parallel
independent trajectories our lives are parallel
separate terms of equality our lives are parallel

our lives are parallel

is there no redemption no common good
is there nothing we can do for ourselves or only what we should

comes the hard admission of what we don't provide
goes the insistence on the ways and means that so divide

they so divide

side by side suffering loneliness our lives are parallel
phony collective progress our lives are parallel
accepting that it's all such a mess our lives are parallel
gesturing without hope of redress our lives are parallel

our lives are parallel

forging little plays of deception and pain
as we watch our foundation crumble away
staggering like birds against a hurricane
and trying all the while to stay out of each other's way

broken dreams of unity our lives are parallel
independant trajectories our lives are parallel
screaming out for understanding our lives are parallel
turning inward and suffering our lives are parallel
