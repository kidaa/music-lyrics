everybody is talking about the girl who went and killed the delivery
man, but she looks so kind and gentle, it just doesn't stand to
reason, i saw her right there just like the other night as stately as
a slot machine, but when she looked my way something mad as hell came
over me, anasthesia, mona lisa, i've got a little gun, here comes
oblivion, i never loved y ou, how did youfind me the cops will never
prove complicity now, anna..., all good children go to heaven! i
remember your face that august night when we lied about the beautiful
time to come and that crazy old man who came much too late and caused
a chain reaction, i've been hanging out here for eleven long yeras
like now is driving me to distraction
