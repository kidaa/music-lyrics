you were the one,
you were my everything
never apart,
no one in-between
then one day,
when you went your own way
you felt justified,
and I was mortified
but today...
you are just a picture
and a thousand memories
is all I take with me
cuz your smile
is just too much to see
you're just a thousand memories
fantasies, broken dreams
reveries, sordid histories
following my heart,
laden with reaction,
without calibration or design
committed to a trial,
a life of understanding
can't somebody show a sign to you
for me, to see if you only knew
that you were the one...
cuz a picture is worth
one thousand memories
