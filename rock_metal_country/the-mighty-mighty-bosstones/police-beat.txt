Original song by SS Decontrol 
Police pick me out of the crowd, 'cause I dress different, act real loud.
Police, Police
There's no questions asked, They just wanna kick my ass.
Police beat me, Police kick me, Police chase me, Police mace me, Police cuff me, Police rough me
Just to show how tough they be
Police Police
Police who judge me... why won't they just let me be? Police Police
