Original song by Van Halen 
Oh yeah I heard the news baby,
all about your disease
you may have all that you want to honey
but I got somethin' you need Oh yeah,
I ain't talkin' 'bout love
My love is rotten to the core
I Ain't talkin' 'bout love
Just like I told you before,
you know you're semi-good lookin',
and on the streets again
and you think you're really cookin' mama,
you better find yourself a friend, a friend, 
'cause I ain't talkin' 'bout love
My love is rotten to the core
I Ain't talkin' 'bout love
Just like I told you before jello
And I Ain't talkin' 'bout love
my love is rotten to the core
I Ain't talkin' 'bout love
Just like I told you before yeah before
you know I've been to the edge,
and I stood and looked down
I lost a lot of friends there baby,
I got no time to mess around
so if you want it got to bleed for me baby
you got to got to bleed for me baby
got to got to got to bleed for me baby and
I won't dance in a club like this
'cause all the girls are sluts
and the beer tastes just like piss
Ain't talkin' 'bout love
My love is rotten to the core
I Ain't talkin' 'bout love
Just like I told you before
hey hey hey hey 4x
