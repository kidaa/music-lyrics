Don't mind when it happens
no problem when I am sayin' it,
but when I lose my mind
kick my behind
because I hate when my mind keeps replayin' it.
I'm not braggin', and I'm not proud
I hang around a drunken crowd
we are happy, that I can say
and until we're not, I kid you not
we're gonna stay that way.
We're down, down, down,
one more day of sayin' we won't be no more,
down, down, down,
one more good day of sayin' we won't be no more
drinkin' the other day
I said ";I love you";, you turned away
maybe the drinkin'
it made me cry,
but I'm a happy, very happy, very happy guy
drunks and children they tell the truth
that's just what I am, I'm drunken youth
and when I am drinkin' I don't know why
but I'm a happy, very happy, very happy guy
sometimes when when I'm playin'
I never watch what I'm sayin'
sometimes I lose my head
I lose my head and things get said
I never should have said
sometimes I get housed
I get housed I get soused
and shoot off my mouth
and sometimes I can't get out
and I don't know what I'm talkin' about
you know i've made mistakes,
I've had my ups and downs
my ins and outs
my share of bad breaks
but when it's all
been said and done
I raise my beer and I swear
";God it's been fun!";
Good God oh my God good God good God
