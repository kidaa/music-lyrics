How did this could this come to this?
Helpless heartless loneliness,
A hand held out hope someone gives
I'm a man without a place to live
A man without a place to go
And it just might be my fault I know
Won't hold you up or bag your eyes
But I'm a man please realize
How did this could this come to this?
Helpless heartless loneliness
Heartless, had a heart just yesterday
Helpless didn't used to be this way
Homeless, that's the worst part of it all
Fuck this,
What I scream at every wall
Are my screams being ignored
I'm screaming can you help me Lord
No one hears a man like me 
 It's easier if they don't see
So let all just pretend to feel and make believe that I'm not real
Help is what I'm screaming for,
Help me please don't just ignore
It's come to this
Helpless heartless loneliness
Hand held out, hope someone gives
I'm a man without a place to live,
A man without a place to go
And it just might be my fault I know
Won't hold you up or bag your eyes
But I'm a man please realize 
How did this could this come to this,
Did this could this come to this,
Did this could this come to this,
Did this could this come to this
