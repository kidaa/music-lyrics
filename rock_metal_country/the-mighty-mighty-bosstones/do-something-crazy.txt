Do something crazy for me again,
call me up, I need a friend
lose your mind, just one more time
I wanna see you again
Hey! Hey! Hey! please look at me
I haven't been crazy since we were we
and I wanna be, I wanna be, now can't you see?
I wanna be crazy like I used to be
so do something crazy for me again
and we'll start our crazy love again
do something crazy, go out of your head
say the crazy things that you once said
do something crazy, give me a break
go out of your mind, girl, for heaven's sake
do something crazy 'cause I know you can
I wanna see you again
I know, I know, I know what you can do
I've seen you in action, and I know it's true
and I was crazy at one time too
but the craziest thing I ever did was losing you 10x 
Pick up the phone! I'm so goddamn alone
please name the place and date
well use the dial, it's been a while
I really just can't wait
do something crazy... come on and do something crazy
