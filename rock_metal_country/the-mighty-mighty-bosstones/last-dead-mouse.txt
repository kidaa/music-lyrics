Step right up,
Gather round,
Greatest salesman in town
Selling something 
Seldom sold
Step up, step up, step up behold
Dead mice for sale,
They're going fast
Like hell
Last dead mouse don't be shy,
There's never been a better time to buy
Last dead mouse but I'll get more
I'm a businessman and an entrepreneur
Folks say I'm nuts, they can say what they please
You've got to be crazy with prices like these
No overhead so I can keep down the cost
I make my own hours 'cause I'm my own boss
I believe in my product,
I love what I sell
Last dead mouse that's why I yell 
 Step right up ladies and gents
Last dead mouse costs fifty cents
It's a steal at any price
Going once, going once, going once, going twice
Half a buck, last in stock
Be the first one on your block
No need to walk, no need to feed, satisfaction guaranteed 
Last dead mouse but I'll get more
I'm a bussinessman and an entrepreneur
Folks say I'm nuts, they can say what they please
You've got to be crazy with prices like these
No overhead so I can keep down the cost
I make my own hours 'cause I'm my own boss
I believe in my product, I love what I sell
Last dead mouse that's why I yell
Nice and easy now,
Nice and easy now,
Nice and easy now
Last dead mouse,
Last dead mouse
