never lose my wallet
it would put me in a spot
never lose my sense
at least how much I've got
never lose my family
never lose my friends
never lose my youth
I hope it never ends
hope I never lose my wallet
and hell I hope to hell
and only time will tell
I hope I never lose my mind
or lose myself somewhere
not too far from here
that nobody can find
never lose my hair
I would hate to go without
never lose direction
and wander all about
never lose my courage
never lose my hope
never lose my girl
it would make it hard to cope
hope I never lose my wallet
and last of all
not least of all
I hope I never lose my mind
or lose myself somewhere
not too far from here
that nobody can find
