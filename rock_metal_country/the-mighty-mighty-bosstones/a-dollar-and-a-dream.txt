I've got a dollar, that I want to save
safe in my pocket, I'll try to hold fast
hey! it might be my last
I know what I've got, folded safe in its spot
I earned a dollar, it's not here to share
I've got a dollar and that's all I've got
a million more is just a single grain
a grain of sand, or just one drop of rain
a small amount might make the difference these days
a dollar and a dream is all I can raise
I had a dream, I had all the answers
to all the questions, I've ever been asked
and in my dream, I had all the answers
to all the questions, I've ever asked myself
man what a dream, it sure felt great
took to the streets, 'cause I couldn't wait
to freely give wisdom and share what I knew
I had a dream and that's all I had
a million here, lay down in pain every night
a million there, to stay alive must fight
I'm sure my numbers underestimate
a dollar and a dream, I swear it's not too late
I had a dollar, I wanted to save
keep in my pocket, I held fast
a dollar bill, that I would take to my grave
deep in my pocket like it was my last
look for the dollar, now it's not there
even the pants are a different pair
I earned the dollar, I had to share
I had a dollar and that's all I had
a million more, is just a star in the sky
tip of the iceberg, but we've all got to try
our works cut out, and there's work to be done
