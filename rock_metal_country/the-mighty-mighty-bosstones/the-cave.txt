In a place where comfort shouldn't be
I found comfort and tranquility
I found friends that mean so much to me,
in a place I never thought I'd be.
the cave's never
coming down on me.
the cave really
means so much to me
'cause the cave, it only gives
I'm glad the cave is where I live
O.K., so sometimes things get out of hand
and piece of mind is in great demand
I climb up to the top...
look around and it all seems to stop
the cave's never coming down on me
and the cave really means so much to me
'cause the cave, it only gives
I'm glad the cave is where I live
the cave's never coming down on me
the cave really means so much to me
'cause the cave, it only gives
