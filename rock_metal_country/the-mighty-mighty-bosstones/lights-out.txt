Original song by Angry Samoans 
Nothing more you can leave behind.
So forget about seeing, and get it into your mind.
Whole thing is better when the world gets black.
Grab a fork, you make your first attack.
Lights out! Poke, poke, poke your eyes out! Lights out!
Put a pen in your hand and poke your eyes out.
I can't see too well what's it all about?
I don't know man, did you poke your eyes out?
First thing, I did it today, time to get hip to the lights out way.
Lights out! Poke, poke, poke your eyes out Lights out!
Put yourself on the floor, that's what it's all about.
If you poke too far, you'll reach the front of your brain.
A fork in your mind could drive you insane.
Don't worry about it, just let it rip- donate your eyeballs to the lights out trip.
Light's Out! Put a pen in your hand, poke your eyes out. Lights out!
Poke, poke, poke your eyes out! Lights out!
Put an ax in your hand and poke your eyes out. Lights out!
