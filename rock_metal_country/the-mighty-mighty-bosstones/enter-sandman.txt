Original song by Metallica 
say your prayers little one don't forget my son,
to include everyone
tuck you in, warm within
keep you free from sin, til the sandman, he comes
sleep with one eye open, gripping your pillow tight
exit light, enter night
take my hand, we're off to never never land
something's wrong, cut the light heavy thoughts tonight
and they're not of Snow White
dreams of war, dreams of liars, dreams of dragon's fire,
and of things that will fight
sleep with one eye open, gripping your pillow tight
exit light, enter night
take my hand, we're off to never never land ha-ha
You know I can't smile without you
I can't smile witout you
I can't cry without you
I can't even cry without you
I can't laugh and I can't sing
Now that's the truth
I'm finding it hard to do anything
hush little baby, don't say a word
and never mind those things you heard
it's just the beasts under your bed,
in your closet in your head
exit light, enter night grain of sand
exit light, enter night
take my hand, we're off to never never land
