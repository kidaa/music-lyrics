WAAAhh What are these noises?
We're sending this one out to a beautiful, beautiful human being
Noise, noise, noise from down below
and It's coming from the basement
it's underneath the house now and
it's rockin' the foundation
it's a noise we love to make
and for years we have been making
while Doctor D, watches TV his house is fucking shaking
he lets us practice in his place IN HIS PLACE!
he's got a wife with a pretty face PRETTY FACE!
takes vacation, owns property DR.D! Dr. Dalsimer, DOCTOR D!
In the daytime what's he doin? upstairs in the attic
he's saving lives from ruin he's sorting through the static.
he puts back together brains? I guess they're broken
...and I'm not fucking joking
he lets us practice in his place IN HIS PLACE!
he's got a wife with a pretty face PRETTY FACE!
takes vacation, owns property DR.D! Dr. Dalsimer, DOCTOR D!
WAAAAhh What are these noises!? [2x]
nice. nice. nice, nice, nice, nice neighborhood
and nice place to raise the kids
they're tough things to obtain but Dr. D. He did
worked hard to take it easy worked hard and wasn't lazy
guitars drums, tones and saxophones he must be fucking crazy
he lets us practice in his place IN HIS PLACE!
he's got a wife with a pretty face PRETTY FACE!
takes vacation, owns property DR.D! Dr. Dalsimer, DOCTOR D!
WAAAAhh What are these noises!? Waaahh What are these noises!? 
* This song is about the band's former drummer, Josh Dalsimer's father. 
They used to practice at his house.
