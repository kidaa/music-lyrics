I couldn't be more confused
but more than that I'm upset
we once stood side by side
we were young when we met
we'd always stand together
that's how we had it planned
now where do we stand oh
I can't stand the pain
I guess I don't understand
I just don't understand this stand off
there's a lot I don't understand
we're apart and don't have to be
what went wrong? I don't know off hand
I only know this is killing me
so I called your bluff
said I'd see you around
you stood tough
you stood your ground
now I'm standing by
I'm trying to stand tall
I'm standing alone
don't understand this at all
I just don't understand this stand off
there's a lot I don't understand
we're apart, do we have to be?
what went wrong? I don't know off hand
I only know this is killing me
now I'm standing by - watching myself die
right beside myself - like it isn't me
it's some other guy
and time's standing still - and I'll stand here until
I understand - or you come back
I really hope you will
I don't understand where we went wrong
I don't understand how it fell apart
did I wait too long to write this song?
