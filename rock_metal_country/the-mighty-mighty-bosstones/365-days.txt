It's gripping, I'm ripping
I haven't just been sipping
stressing no messing
will I ever learn my lesson?
I'm always amazed, by what can take place
within the space of 300-365
sinning, I'm spinning
in the beginning I was winning
clinging, still swinging
if I could I would be singing
I'm always amazed by what can take place
within the space of 300-365
I'm empty of answers
don't nobody search me
the long neck's a twist off
you don't need a church key
I'm still full of questions
but can't quite see clear
twist off another 3x
and bring on next year 
drilled it killed my guts are being spilled
wailed, impaled
my last breath's been inhaled
that's still in me
I haven't failed
I'm always amazed, by what can take place
within the space of 300-365
I'm empty of answers
don't nobody search me
the long neck's a twist off
you don't need a church key
I'm still full of questions
but can't quite see clear
twist off another 3x
and bring on next year 
300-365 3x 365 DAY! 
Die Mighty Mighty Bosstones haetten an dieser
Stelle gerne ";eisgekuehlter Bommerlunder"; von den Toten Hosen gesampelt,
doch Rechtsanwlte und Plattenbosse haben dies mal wieder verhindert. 
* Translation of German: ";The MMB would have liked to sample 'eisgekuehlter Bommerlunder' by the Toten Hosen, but lawyers and record company bosses have prevented that again.";
