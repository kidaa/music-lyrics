Original song by Aerosmith 
talk about things nobody cares
wearing other things that nobody wears
callin' my name, but I gotta make it clear
can't say where I'm gonna be in a year 
some sweet talking mama with a face like a gent
said we'll get up and go musta got up and went
well I got good news she's a real good liar
cause backstage lover set your pants on fire
sweet emo-tion, sweet emo-tion
pulled into town in a police car
daddy said I took you just a little too far
well I got good news your girlfriend lied
but you can't catch me cause the rabbit done died yes he did
now you're standin' in front just shakin' your ass
take you back stage you can drink from my glass
let's talk about something you can sure understand
a month on the road and I'll be eatin' from your mother-lovin hand
sweet emo-tion, sweet emo-tion, sweet emo-tion
