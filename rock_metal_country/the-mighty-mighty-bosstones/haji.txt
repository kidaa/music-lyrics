well he was just about the baddest cat in Bagdad
I mean to tell you that this cat was so bad
he was as big as a tiger, mean as a snake
and when haji got angry, the walls would shake
Haji I'm the king of the Genies
Haji and shit Haji I'm the King of the Genies
moved to Florida, Jeanie's town
to start his own business and get down
his powers concealed nobody knew
he wheeled and dealed and did what Haji had to do
Haji I'm the king of the Genies
Haji and shit Haji I said I'm the King of the Genies
well lets go now he kicks full throttle from his bottle ladies wall to wall
The Bosstones partied with my man and man it was a ball
he kept things fired kept us wired betties, Bud and booze
bourbon in his turban and sheeba from his shoes
he busted out in a cloud of smoke he just left like he came
he's King of the Genies and all that shit
but what a stupid name my story is over Haji lives on
and he'll be around long after we're gone
because Genies don't die, and Haji wull rule
Haji is bad b-b-b-bad and cool
Haji I'm the king of the Genies
Haji and shit Haji I said I'm the King of the Genies
