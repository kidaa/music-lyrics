Dicky Barrett/Joe Gittleman 
you thought the idea was good, to hang around in my neighborhood
thought it was a good idea, you even thought it might advance your career
Thought that! you thought that time was on your side
And you! and you can go along for the ride
thought you wouldn't go too far, your thoughts have got you where you are
never had a crystal ball, never promised you at all
never promised you a thing, I never knew what things would bring
it can't hurt, It can't hurt, not gonna hurt you Doll!
it hasn't helped, it hasn't helped hasn't helped you At all!
you believe that being where you've been was a way that you could walk right in
and you were sure that going where you've gone was a way that you could get up on
Had to! you had to do what you had to do
And you! bit off more than you could chew
open you're eyes and look at where you're at,
shut your mouth and swallow that
never had a crystal ball, never promised you at all
I never promised you a thing, never knew what things would bring
it can't hurt, it can't hurt, not gonna hurt you Doll!!
it hasn't helped, it hasn't helped, has it helped you at all!
I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried, I can't seem to get through.
Yo Dennis man, see if she'll listen to you.
AAAhh it can't hurt, it can't hurt, not gonna hurt you Doll!!
it doesn't help, it doesn't help, has it helped you At all?
it can't hurt, no it can't hurt, no it can't hurt you Doll!
It doesn't help, it hasn't helped, It hasn't help you At all!
