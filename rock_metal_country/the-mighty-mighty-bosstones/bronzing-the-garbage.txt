You're off base
out of line and in my face
brace yourself - I'm coming through
and before you know what's hit you
you'll have heard my point of view
trash is trash
have I got your attention?
there's more that you should know
there's more I've got to mention
you've got to let it go
I was a child, another time another place
only a child would carry this so far
you're still in my face
I held it back, I was afraid
didn't want to blow your cover
but I was on to your charade
trash is trash
have I got your attention?
There's more that you should know
there's more I've got to mention
you've got to let it go
bronzing the garbage
there was a time I was impressed
through all the garbage
it's still not you that I detest
I hate the way
you can't forget, I hate it so
bronze what you want
but you've got to let it go 
have I got through?
have I got through to you?
gave it a shot - finally got to state my case
if you've heard nothing, please hear this
don't get in my face
trash is trash 
AHHHH....trash is trash
bronzing the garbage
there was a time I was impressed
through all the garbage
it's still not you that I detest
I hate the way
you can't forget, I hate it so
bronze what you want
but you've got to let it go
have I got your attention?
there's more that you should know
there's more I've got to mention
you've got to let it go
have I got your attention?
there's more that you should know
there's more I've got to mention
