Illegal left on Sunday morning
On the corner I was warning
Waving widly, wildy warning Don't take that turn on Sunday morning
A motorcycle cop was waiting, he had to fill his ticket booth
On his nerves now I was grating, 
Illegal left that no one took
Maybe I should mind my own
Maybe it's not my concern,
But somewhere someone is suffering
And this is an illegal turn 
Sunday morning not too far
Someone's taking someone's car,
Someone's taking someone out,
Someone needs you know, no doubt
He told me I should move along
I said, ";You've got the whole thing wrong";
I'll stay here I've got the time and you can deal with real crime
He didn't like what I was saying no not at all no not one bit
I didn't see the point in staying
It was fun though I admit
Maybe I should mind my own,
Maybe it's not my concern
But somewhere someone's suffering and this is an illegal turn
Sunday morning, not too far
Someone's taking someone's car, someone's taking someone out,
Someone needs you no doubt
