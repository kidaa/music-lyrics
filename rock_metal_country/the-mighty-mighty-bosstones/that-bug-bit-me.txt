That bug bit me,
I'll admit
Stunned - it took a while to hit
But when it hit me,
I was bit
Shit, I came clean with it
No match, who am I
No match, who am I, so why try to deny it
Just a regular guy, who won't even try it
The bug's been around
Since time began
It's bitten bigger
Badder bastards than the one I am
It can cripple
And it can paralyze
When I felt it's tooth 
 I told the truth to my surprise
I saw the bug and I gotta say
Ahh I tried to get away
I tried to run,
I tried to fight
But the bug was there to bite
No match, who am I?
Must respect the insect, it injects and infects
If i may interject, I love the effects
The bug's been around since time began
It's bitten bigger
Badder bastards than the one I am
It can cripple
And it can paralyze
When I felt its tooth
