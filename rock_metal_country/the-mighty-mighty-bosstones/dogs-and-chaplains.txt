Don't mind when it happens
no problem when I am saying it
but when I lose my mind, kick my behind
because I hate when my mind keeps replaying it
I'm not bragging and I'm not proud
I hang around with a drunken crowd
we are happy, that I can say
and until we're not I kid you not, we're gonna stay that way
my life would start to settle down... Johnny!
then you came along and you turned it upside down... Vegas!
drunks and children they always tell the truth... Johnny!
but I'm sober and older and could've held on to... My Youth!
drinkin' the other day
I said I loved you, you turned away
maybe the drinking, made me cry
but I'm a happy, very happy, very happy guy
drunks and children they tell the truth
and that's what I am a drunken youth
and when I'm drinking I don't know why
but I'm a happy, very happy, very happy guy
sometimes when I am playing
I never watch what I am saying
sometimes I lose my head
I lose my head and things get said I never should have said
sometimes I get housed
housed soused and shoot off my mouth
and sometimes I kick it out, and I don't know what I'm talkin' about
I don't know what I'm talking about
you know, I've made mistakes, I've had my ups and downs
my ins and outs, my share of bad breaks
but when it's all been said and done
I raise my beer and I swear God it's been fun... 
good God oh my God good God good God good God good God God its been fun!
