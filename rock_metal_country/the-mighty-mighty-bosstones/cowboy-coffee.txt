Dicky Barrett/Joe Gittleman 
to put up with the output I don't think about it,
hold on and hold out or I'd be left out without it
things better get better I gotta get
thing's should get good but they haven't yet
while these things keep bringing and bringing me grief
I've got that one something that still brings relief
all these things keep bringing and bringing me grief
I've got that one something that still brings relief
cowboy coffee and chemical cream ride on ride on my stallion of green
midnight shower sleep in the flowers and dream, hurricane, breakneck speed, rapid fire, dreams
it's not that it's boggin' or cloggin' my head
it's not that I'm swamped buried under near dead
it's just the daily grind to bring the daily bread
I wasn't born rich I'm good looking instead
while these dailys ";dille-dallie"; and I'm daily employed
I've got that daily something that's daily enjoyed
while these dailys ";dille-dallie"; and I'm daily employed
I've got that daily something that's daily enjoyed
cowboy coffee and chemical cream ride, ride, ride on my stallion of green
just a midnight flower, sleep in the flowers and dream, hurricane, breakneck speed, rapid fire, dreams
