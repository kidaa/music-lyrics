Do I really wanna step in here?
I feel like my father at the horse track
When he's down to his last sawbuck
Do I really wanna step in here,
I'm not as sure as I appear
Tell me should we make this move
And if it seems pathetic, pardon me
I'm not as sure as I appear
Thought it over
Thought I'd walk over
And over coffee we could chat
But then,
Then I thought again 'cause what was was over
And now I know that
Thought I'd call, we could talk it over
I knew that wouldn't work out somehow
What was was over and I should just get over
And that is where I'm at right now
I'm really glad that you are here
What could be could beat what was
We are is at any rate, 
 I'm really glad that you are here
Thought it over, thought I'd walk over
And over coffee we could chat
But then,
Then I though again
'cause what was was over now I know that 
Thought I'd call we could talk it over
I knew that wouldn't work somehow
What was was over and I should just get over
And that is where I'm at right now 
And we are is because
What was is now was
Pray for rain, it never does
And after all that we've done been through is is gonna have to do
And we are is because
What was is now was
Pray for rain, it never does
And after all we've been through is
Is gonna have to do
