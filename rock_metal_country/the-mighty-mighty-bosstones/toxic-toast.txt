Queensbury ah #8
hell hotel punk rock estate
way way back back in the day
100 years it seems that way
just across from Wayne's Junk Store
3 floors up then straight ahead
if someone thought to lock the door
use the fire escape instead
someone's always up to something
one thing's always understood
if nothing happened in a minute
wait another, something would
avoid the landlord spend the rent
raising hell with reckless style
and sure our time was poorly spent
but toxic toast still makes me smile
looking back now - not sure how
we made it through, not all of us but most
still haunts me - like it wants me
I remember I remember I remember - toxic toast
this stuff's 100-30 proof
Glue threw the TV off the roof
the whole damn place just wasn't stable
Andrew trashed the coffee table
Rico's here, the party's reeling
Colam's been spray painting the ceiling
can't make a call and man it's cold
alcohol and stranglehold
toxic toast Jake coined the phrase
haven't thought about it for a while
mindless endless nights and days
but toxic toast still makes me smile
looking back now - not sure how
we made it through, not all of us but most
still haunts me - like it wants me
I remember I remember I remember - toxic toast
Someone's always up to something
one thing's always understood
if nothing happened in a minute
wait another, something would
looking back now not sure how
we made it through, not all of us but most
still haunts me like it wants me
I remember I remember I remember - toxic toast
looking back now not sure how
we made it through, not all of us but most
still haunts me like it wants me
