Gonna dive into a dive
I've dove into before
Gonna haunt a haunt I've haunted
Like a million times or more
A familiar joint
Where getting drunk's the only point
To frequent this place
With any frequency at all
Countin' on a remedy
I've counted on before
Goin' with a cure that's never failed me
What you call the disease,
I call the remedy
What you're callin' the cause,
I call the cure
Gonna sing a song, a song to you
A song I've sung before
Belt out a ballad that I've belted out
A million times or more 
 The words I'm gonna scream
And getting drunk's the central theme
to the lyrics, if you can
make the lyrics out at all
Countin' on a remedy
I've counted on before
Goin' with a cure that's never failed me
What you call the disease,
I call the remedy
What you're callin' the cause,
I call the cure
Just a devotion to a potion
Please no applause
A dedication to a medication
A crutch a cure a cause
What I've counted on to pick me up
Has knocked me to my knees
Before I hit the floor once more
