It's so hard to face
That in this day and age
Somebody's race
Could trigger somebody's rage
And somebody's preference
Can drive some total stranger
to make somebody, somehow
feel the wrath of their anger
Why were we put here?
What for? we're unsure
We sure weren't put here to hate
Be racist, be sexist
Be bigots, be sure
We won't stand for your hate
Why so cut and dry
A simple concept missed
Give tolerance a try
This confusion still exists ignorant mongers
No area's gray 
 Couldn't be any wronger in this age and day
Why were we put here?
What for? we're unsure
We sure weren't put here to hate
Be racist, be sexist
Be bigots, be sure
We won't stand for your hate
Now how far have we come?
How come there still are come
Who won't let come
March to the beat of a different drum
To face it, it's so hard
you must be on your guard
It's not okay
And you're not free to be a different way
Let's try to erase it, it's time that we face it
If we don't, then who will? shame on us
Let's try to erase it, it's time that we face it
