Mighty Mighty Bosstones 
I like noise, that's why I'm livin' where I am.
I like the noise and confusion of a traffic jam.
I like the sound of a jet as it's shakin' my dwellin'
I like ragin', rampagin' and screamin' and yellin'
sound of a fire engine headed for a fire.
Emotions so high they can't get any higher
goin' out of control in an outta hand crowd
I like noise and it's gotta be loud.
Awfully quiet, Awfully quiet, Awfully quiet
It was awfully quiet on the streets yesterday
people on the streets had little to say
well I walked the streets and barely heard a sound
it was awfully quiet on the streets downtown.
Sometimes quiet's okay, sometimes quiet's alright.
Given the choice, I like noise, morning, noon, and night.
It was awfully quiet and on the trains last night.
People on the trains kept the conversation light.
I rode the trains and barely heard a word
quietest train I ever heard.
Sometimes quiet's okay, sometimes quiet's alright.
Given the choice, I like noise, morning, noon, and night.
Awfully quiet, Awfully quiet, Awfully quiet
It was awfully quiet and I needed some noise
I got on the blower called up the boys
I was doing so bad I could barely hack it
they came to my house and they kicked up a racket
ooh-ah [2x]
they turned my place on its ear ooh
the boy's began to riot ah
it felt so good to hear ooh
on a day that was so quiet ah
I screamed and cheered them on ooh
and I helped out where I could ah
and when they all were gone ooh
I was feeling good!
I like noise that's why I'm livin' where I am.
