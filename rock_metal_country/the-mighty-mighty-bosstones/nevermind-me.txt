He didn't hit me for a home
Or hit me up 'cause he was cold
He was addicted to drugs
And I could see that in his eyes
What about me?
Well I was only rolled
He didn't rob me for food
It wasn't hunger, but a jonze
He needed a fix,
Someone will fix my broken bones
And I'll feel better in the morning
The pain will fade as time goes by
What was taken,
I won't miss, or I'll replace
Nevermind me, well I'm all right 
 He seemed to hate what he was doing
He sure knew how to get it done
Possessed by an addiction
I don't have to comprehend
What about me?
Well he whipped me with a gun
He didn't rob me for food
It wasn't hunger, but a jonze
He needed a fix,
Someone will fix my broken bones
And I'll feel better in the morning
The pain will fade as time goes by
What was taken,
I won't miss, or I'll replace
