Dicky Barrett/Joe Gittleman 
standing stiff on a cliff and I'm not gonna leap,
checked out the water but it's much too deep
no going back there's no turning around,
so I'll stay here and wait God I hope that I'm found
my [7x] thoughts were in knots but I couldn't get to sleep,
went up to the attic to see what to keep
threw out the useless and now it's bone-dry,
but I still couldn't die and couldn't figure out why
no way, no how, no what? what now?
the place is packed I needed that
the bottles cracked I'm glad for that
a good nights rest? forget about that
I feel alive in this dive so I'll drink to that
the place is packed I needed that
the bottles cracked I'm glad for that
a good nights rest? forget about that
I feel alive in this dive so I'll drink to that
the attic was empty and my eyes were shut,
I had to do soemthing but I didn't know what
the darkness was nice but it wasn't enough,
the clock wasn't stopping so I had to get tough
get tough, get up, get out, get tough!
the place is packed I needed that
the bottles cracked I'm glad for that
a good nights rest? forget about that
I feel alive in this dive so I'll drink to that
the place is packed I needed that
the bottles cracked I'm glad for that
a good nights rest? forget about that
I feel alive in this dive so I'll drink to that
got up and out and found out it was raining,
the car lived then died but I wasn't complaining
hell bent for action and it had to be out there,
I walked then I ran hoping something was somewhere
before too long it didn't take long,
this place came along and I ended up here
the place is packed I needed that the bottles cracked
I'm glad for that a good nights rest? forget about that
I feel alive in this dive so I'll drink to that
the place is packed I needed that the bottles cracked
I'm glad for that a good nights rest? forget about that
I feel alive in this dive so I'll drink to that
