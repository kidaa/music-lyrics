Original song by Slapshot 
stick that needle right through your arm, do everything that does you harm
so you're lying there on the floor, see ya staggering out the door
try it and you like it and you know you can, take it on
take your real life till you soon discovered where you are,
you don't know, so you're at the bottom with a nose full of blow
don't know what you're doin to me, so you're lying there so helplessly
get yourself back up before its too late, or a life of pain will be your fate
you don't care about anyone, just as long as you have your fun
or as long as you get your fix, now you're taking a deep six
try it and you like it and you know you can take it on
take your real life till you soon discovered where you are,
you don't know so you're at the bottom with a nose full of blow
don't know what you're doin to me so you're lying there so helplessly
get yourself back up before its too late or a life of pain will be your fate
higher baby, get higher baby, get higher baby, don't ever come down Dont do it!
now you triy it and you like it and you know you can take it on
take your real life till you soon discovered where you are,
you don't know so you're at the bottom with a nose full of blow
don't know what you're doin to me so you're lying there so helplessly
get yourself back up before its too late or a life of pain will be your fate
what's at stake [4x]
