Don't touch that dial, don't click the clicker 
we love to watch, they love to bicker
don't turn the knob or change the channel
hey! where the hell did they get this panel?
where are they from? where have they been?
they air it out, we suck it in suck it in 
up on stage all in a row 
at each other's throats all through the show
the mood is tense, the tension's thicker
we watch, they fight, just who here's sicker?
we're not so bad, I guess after all
their problems make ours seem so small
we'd be much better off I bet
if we'd turn off the tv set turn it off now
she broke down and he came clean
we stay glued, glued to the screen
just how much more can we take?
thank God here comes a station break
we're not so bad, I guess after all
their problems make ours seem so small
we'd be much better off I bet
if we turned off the tv set turn it off now
don't think that we can take much more
we've lost it now man, that's for sure
lost another day, check out the clock
pull the plug, shut it down, turn it off, now,
