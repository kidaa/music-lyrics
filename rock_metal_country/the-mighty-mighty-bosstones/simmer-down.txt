Original song by Bob Marley 
Simmer down, my head is too hot so
Simmer down, he's gonna get dropped so
Simmer down, man, here's what I say
Simmer down, now I've got to got to simmer down.
A long time ago we used to be friends.
Picked my bones in my pockets that's where it ends so
Simmer down, control my temper
Simmer down, the battle will be hotter
Simmer down, ok here's what I say
Simmer down, oh, I'm leavin' in a day
Simmer down, here's what I say
Simmer down, oh, I'm leavin' in a day
Simmer down, okay here's what I'm sayin'
Simmer down, it's got to be this way
Where's the love? Where is the loyalty?
We did our part now where is the love?
Simmer down, control my temper
Simmer down, the battle will be hotter
Simmer down, it's hard 'cause it hurts so,
Simmer down, kick me off
Simmer down, but the pain still exists
Simmer down, and hey I'm sure he'll be missed
Simmer down, it'll make us stronger
Simmer down, and we'll live alot longer so
Simmer down, what goes around
Simmer down, will come around
Simmer down, I know I've got to simmer down
Simmer down, I'm tryin' to simmer down
Simmer down, I've got to got to Simmer Down ohh
Simmer Down, it's hard 'cause it hurts
Simmer Down
