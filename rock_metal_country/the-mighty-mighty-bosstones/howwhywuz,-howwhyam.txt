I used to talk to cab drivers
well now I just don't bother
I'd empty out my pockets
if someone asked me for a quarter.
there was a time that I'd give the time
to the old, the weak, and the weird.
I just don't know why this is so
but I've never been so scared
am I getting older?
are things getting harder?
I used to never cry
when I would think about my father.
the years went past so goddamn fast.
you know, I've left a lot behind
my devil could care attitute,
you know, I just can't seem to find.
and once upon a time
I never minded very much
I never let it knock me down
or grind me out of touch
am I getting older?
are things getting harder?
I used to never cry
when I would think about my father.
once I had an outlook
different than it is
full of dreams and schemes
it seems they just do not exist
and once I told myself
he will not be missed
now now now I never thought that I would see the day
I'd ever feel like this
am I getting older?
are things getting harder?
I used to never cry
when I would think about my father.
am I getting older?
are things getting harder?
I used to never cry
when I would think about my father.
I used to never cry
I used to never cry
I used to never cry
