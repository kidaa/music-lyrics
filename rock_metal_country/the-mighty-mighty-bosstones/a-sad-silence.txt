two years and extra days, a block away he'd head to hang
same corner, neighborhood, his friends, the gang
two years and extra days, a bigger kid would crack his eye
no real reason, explanation and everyday no one knew why
the bigger kid was crazy, that made the gang afraid
when he told the gang to shut their mouths, the gang obeyed
you've got to have a place to be, you need a place to hang around
no one spoke, no one moved, no one made a sound
both his eyes would twitch
the left one was always black
his lips they never moved
they stayed still with each attack
his ears were always ringing,
in his head he'd hear a hum
and all the kids on the corner
knew what it was from
well then one day it happened, he took his daily crack
his eyes rolled up, like yesterday, he started falling back
the kids that watch this everyday, now watched him hit the ground
no one spoke, no one moved, no one made a sound
and no one made a sound
both his eyes would twitch
the left one was always black
his lips they never moved
they stayed still with each
attack his ears were always ringing,
in his head he'd hear a hum
and all the kids on the corner
knew what it was from
no one spoke, no one moved, no one made a sound
a sad silent situation, now he's not around
no one spoke, no one moved, no one made a sound
a sad silent situation, now he's not around
well no one spoke and no one moved and no one made a sound
a sad silent situation he's not a-he's not around
noone spoke noone moved he's not around
a sad silent situation now he's not around
