Woke up early
On the tenth anniversary
GOOD MORNING
Fit in clips of it
Between food prep shorts
Weather reports
Check the day's commute
And a look at sports
I remember how the wind
Was knocked from me
Before it became footage
A footnote in history
Recently I think I heard it could have been avoided
It shouldn't have occurred
A fundamental obligation 
 To my parents and my kids LIFE
Gave me a glimpse of it Don't know who shot him
They never caught him
Let's get to the bottom
And blow off the lid
I'm trying to keep a balance
Like the plates on top of sticks
Chip away 'til it goes down
When it goes down apply the kicks
Recently I think I heard
It could have been avoided
It shouldn't have occurred
Sadly we're desensitized
To all the scandals and the cover ups
