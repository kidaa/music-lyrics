If it's a temporary lull
why'm I bored right outta my skull?
Man, I'm dressin' sharp an' feelin' dull

Lonely, I guess that's where I'm from
If I was from Canada            
then I'd best be called lonesome
[BTW, I read in an interview that Paul was struck with how some people in
Canada used the word ";lonesome"; instead of ";lonely,"; hence this lyric.]

And if it's just a game
Then I'll break down just in case
Hurry up, we're runnin' in our last race

Well, I laughed half the way to Tokyo
I dreamt I was Surfer Joe 
An' what that means, I don't know

A dream too tired to come true
Left a rebel without a clue
And I'm searching for somethin' to do

And if it's just a game    
Then we'll hold hands just the same
So what, we're bleeding but we ain't cut

And I could purge my soul perhaps    
For the imminent collapse
Oh yeah, I'll tell you what we could do         
You be me for a while
I'll be you

A dream too tired to come true
Left a rebel without a clue
Won't you tell me what I should do?

And if it's just a lull         
why'm I bored right outta my skull?
Oh yeah, keep me from feeling so dull

And if it's just a game              
Then we'll break down just in case
Then again, I'll tell you what we could do
You be me for a while
You be me for a while
and I'll be you
