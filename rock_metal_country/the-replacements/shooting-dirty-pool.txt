Rock 'n roll loudmouth, spew in my glass
Stroke another one down, right behind my back
Do us all a favor, get yourself a spine
Everybody's chokin' on the grapevine

chorus:

Shootin' dirty pool, spewin' dirty lies
Shootin' dirty pool, spewin' dirty lies

I heard it on the airwaves, I've seen it in my glass
Get your money on the table, get your head out of your ass
You're the coolest guy that I ever have smelt
I ain't a notch on nobody's belt

chorus

Why don't you get a haircut, sister?  {bottle breaking}  That's it!
