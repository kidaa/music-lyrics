Cruisin' in the sunshine, 80 up here today ain't yet been to bed?
I could hear the motor whistlin', something's off the wall again
Give my regards to Broadway, tell 'em I got change to spare  
One big buck, gonna have to suck up here

Anything you want, dear, is fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
Everything you say, dear, I'll buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, goodbye

Talkin' about some pictures, now wouldn't that be a scream 
Movies are for retards like me and Maybelline
Give my regards to Boston, ask 'em who'll buy the beer     
Don't wanna get pop, find yourself a rockin' chair

Anything you want, dear, is fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
Everything you say, dear, I'll buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy

Never get passed the dice dear, goddammit, I'm gonna roll
People that pick your nose clean, so what we owe, owe, owe
Give my regards to Broadway, tell 'em I don't really care
If you want a good joke, why split?  You'll go broke right here

Anything you want, dear, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine           
Everything you say, dear, I'll buy, buy, buy, buy, buy      
Anything you want, dear, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
Everything you say, dear, I'll buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, I'll buy
