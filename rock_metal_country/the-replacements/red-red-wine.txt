A bottle of Chablis, hey now, that ain't no stuff for me
Chateau Timberley, as long as I can't see
Gallo or Muscatel, either one would be just swell
I didn't come here to fight, hey just as long as that ain't white

Now I ain't no connoiseur cat - the conno-sewer/kinda sewer rat
Red red wine on Sunday
Always tastes so good
Red red wine
Red red wine
Red red wine if you would

Hey now as long as it is red, oh set 'em up until we're dead
A Saturday sippin' beer, let's get a jug without a year

Now I ain't no connoiseur cat, I think you guessed that
Red red wine on Sunday
Just like Martin said
Red red wine
Red red wine
Set us up 'till we're dead

I ain't no connoiseur cat, conno-sewer rat
... on Sunday
Just like Martin said
Red red wine
Red red wine
Set us up 'till we're dead
