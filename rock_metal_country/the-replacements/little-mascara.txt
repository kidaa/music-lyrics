You and I fall together           
You and I sleep alone
After all, things might be better            
after 1, and there's one that's long gone

For the moon you keep shootin'
Throw your rope up in the air  
For the kids you stay together
You nap 'em and you slap 'em in a highchair                 
All you ever wanted was someone to take care of ya
All you're ever losin' is a little mascara

Afternoon, things are quiet                 
Settle back now if you can
Stations clip by like a rocket
Don't you worry if you wonder why he ran

All you ever wanted was someone to take care of ya
All you're ever losin' is a little mascara       
that you cry  3x   
your eyes out

All you ever wanted was someone Ma'd be scared of
All your ever losin' is
A little mascara             
That you cry
