Yeah!

Yeah, kid, it's a-really hip
With plenty of flash and you know it
Yeah, dad, you're rocking real bad
Don't break your neck when you fall down laughing
Donna, wanna, Donna

Yeah, I know I look like hell
I smoke and I drink and I'm feeling swell
Yeah, I hear you think it's weird everything's clear?
But I don't give a single shit

Yeah, man, it's a-hip, you know what I'm saying
It's a-hip, you know what I'm saying
And I hear it
My heart aches, it's a-looking for a dolly
Looking for a dolly, can't you hear it
Wanna be someting, wanna be anythingYeah, I know I feel this way
But I ain't gonna never change
Yeah, I hear, I think, I know
Rock don't give a shit, you know

You're my favorite thing
You're my favorite thing
Bar nothing

I think, think, once in a while
