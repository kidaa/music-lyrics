Well when you open that bottle of wine
you open a can of worms every time
now you don't stop, that ain't true
never said a word, I never had to
it was my attitude
that you thought was rude
it was my attitude

Old habits are hard to break
and I don't know how much I can take
what I think is on the tip
of my tongue so I let it slip
it was my attitude
that you thought was rude
it was my attitude
that you thought was rudeRemember sitting back in school
I held my tongue
until it turned blue
they said I had an attitude

You just failed my test
cause I know you be the best
so wipe me off as you conclude
A POV is what I can't use
I got an attitude
I got an attitude
Said I had an attitude
said I had an attitude
said I had an attitude
an attitude
said I had an attitude
