Absolution is out of the question
It makes no sense to apologize
The words I thought I brought I left behind, 
So never mind
All over but the shouting, just a waste of time
Never mind
All over but the shouting, just a waste of time

I'm not ready as I'll ever be
I climb the walls, I fall into the sea
I'm not ready as I'll ever be
And I suppose your guess is more or less as bad as mine
All over but the shouting, just a waste of time
Never mind
All over but the shouting, just a waste of time
And I suppose your guess is more or less as bad as mineYou oughta tell me, you oughta say if you're not sure
You oughta tell me, you got to help me remember

Never mind
All over but the shouting, just a waste of time
Never mind
All over but the shouting, just a waste of time
Never mind
Never mind
Never mind
Never mind
The words I thought I brought I left behind
So never mind
