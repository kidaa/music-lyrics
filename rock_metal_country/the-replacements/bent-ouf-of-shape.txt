There's popcorn for dinner
last night it was cheesecake
a little sleepy-time tea
spiked with another heartache
I smell you hair
the clothes I wear
I miss your face
can't you see I'm bent all out of shape
you got me bent all out of shape

I couldn't lie if I tried
yeah you kept me staight
it don't feel so good
but it made me feel great
bent out of shape

You wanna be a dancer
and I'm on my last leg
call but you don't answer
I call again tomorrow
I call again today

I smell your hair
the clothes I wear
I miss you face
can't you see I'm bent all out of shape
you got me, got me bent all out of shape

I couldn't lie if I tried
oh you kept me straight
it don't feel good
but it's gonna feel great
bent out of shapeI don't need no lover
I don't need no more friends
they tell me to forget her
they tell me to forget her
but I never felt better

I smell your hair
the clothes I wear
I wear your face
can't you see I'm bent all out of shape
you got me bent all out of shape

Well my friends all say it shows, it shows
now I don't care who knows
and that feels good
it made me feel great
bent out of shape

Got me bent out of shape
Lock me up
Lock me up
