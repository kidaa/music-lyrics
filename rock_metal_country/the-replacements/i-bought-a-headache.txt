And all I needed was just a breath of fresh air
I want a, I want a folding chair

St. Paul Civic Center
Giving me a 8 dollar and 50 cent
I bought a headache
I bought a headache
Headache

Smoking marijuana and it's comin' out of my ears
A long haired girl shakin' way past her years
So come on, c'mon
So come on, c'mon

Allright, thank you, everybody feel alright? everybody happy?
