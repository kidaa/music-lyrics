Delivering noise
Real tough boys
What else have I got
Half-priced drugs
Stolen guitars
What else is new
It's somethin to du
Somethin to du
Well it ain't nothin new

Stand around and sweat
Girls you bet
Sure beats working too She'll be 22?
Half my stuff's
Broken guitars
Blah blah blah
Somethin to du
Somethin to du
It ain't nothin new
It's somethin to ... du

Somethin to du
Somethin to du
Nothin to
It's somethinDelivering noise
Real tough boys
And what else have I got
Half-priced drugs
Stolen guitars
When the weather's hot
It's somethin to du
It's somethin to du
Said somethin to du
Somethin to Husker

Break the mould
