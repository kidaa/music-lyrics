Kids won't listen
To what you're sayin
Kids ain't wondering
Kids ain't praying
Mo says he's worried
He says talk away
He says yeah I've been cured

I need some attention
No house of detention
I'd love some attention
Don't start again

Kids don't need that
Kids don't want that
Kids don't need nothing of the kind
Kids don't followWhat you're doin
In my face out my ear
Kids won't follow
What you're sayin
We can't hear

Can't stop looting
Can't stop smoking
Kids ain't wondering
Can't stop choking
Kids won't stand still
Kids won't shut up
Kids won't do it
You talk to 'em now

Kids don't follow
What you're doin
In my face and out my ear
Kids won't follow
What you're saying
We can't hear

Kids won't follow
What you're saying
In my face out my ear
Kids don't follow
What you're sayin
We can't hear
What you say
Not tomorrow
Not today
