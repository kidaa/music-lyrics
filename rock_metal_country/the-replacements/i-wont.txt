Do you want me to party?
You want me back at yakety-yak?
Do you drive around a lot?
Drive around since I care?
Do you want me to send a letter or a note?
I won't

Fallin' in love for the first time, my my my
Fallin' in love for the hundred millionth time
Do you want me to send a letter or a note?
I won'tKeep them cards and letters
I'm thinking and I'll think my fill
Do you want me to hide it?
Want me to come an' see?
Do you want me to drive it?
Wrap it up C.O.D.    
Do you want me to send a letter or a note?
I won't
Do you want me to send a letter or a note?
I won't       

Drive me crazy, drive me to look back
Get out of my bed, get outta my yakety-yak
Do you want me to send a letter or a note?
I won't
Well, I won't
No, I won't
