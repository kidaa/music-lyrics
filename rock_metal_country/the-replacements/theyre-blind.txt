The demands made upon you
Are hard to live up to           
It's futile to try and deny
And the things you hold dearly     
Are scoffed at and yearly
Judged once and then left aside

'Cause they're blind              
They hold you too close to the light
and I see what they only might if they'd learn
but they're letting you burn 'cause they're blind        

To the brown-eyed beholder
See the chip on your shoulder
That fools everyone to believe
that you're so hard to talk to
And so easy to [read] through
Yet nobody looks past your sleeve, yeah

'Cause they're blind
They hold you too close to the light
and I see what they only might if they learn
but they're letting you burn 'cause they're blind        

They only like what they can see
An' what they can't, they just can't agree
If you run to me, run, run
Only like the day with her
Only like a date with her           
then you'll run back         
Then you'll run back blind

'Cause they're blind
They hold you too close to the light
and I see what they only might if they'd learn
but they're letting you burn 'cause they're blind        

An old man said to me      
Go home and take it easy               
And run to me, run, run
Only like a date with her
Only one more day with her
Then I'll run back              
Then we'll run back blind                
They hold you too close to the light
And I see what they only might if they learn          
But they're letting us burn
'Cause they're blind
