I remember...ready?

Well it gets about three, everything is swell
C'mon down, c'mon what the hell
I know a better TV, there ain't a whole lot to see
When you're hangin' downtown

Wait, date, no I can't go
I gotta stick around, watch my show
I know it's better than the TV, and there's a whole lot to see
When you're hangin' downtown

Bus stop, pimps and whores
Liquor stores, Seventh Street, Sixth street
Bus stop, bus stop, bus stop, bus stop, bus stop
Anyway, I ain't got no place else to go

Bus stop, bus stop, bus stop, bus stop
It's about three, everything is swell
Downtown, c'mon what the hell
I know it's better than TV, ain't a whole lot to see
When you're hangin' downtown
Everybody hangin' downtown
Hangin' downtown
Downtown
