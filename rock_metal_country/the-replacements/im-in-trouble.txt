I gotta hide, I gotta run
Try suicide, well that ain't no fun
Oh you won't ever say that it's so
You're in love and I'm in trouble

Spend my cash, waste my time
Take out the trash, not this time
Well you won't never say that it's so
You're in love and I'm in trouble

I'm in
You're in
I'm in
You're in
TroubleI'm in
You're in
I'm in
You're in
Trouble
Trouble
Trouble
Trouble

I gotta hide, I better run
I'll try suicide, no no no that ain't no fun
You won't ever let me go
You're in love and I'm in trouble
Yeah
