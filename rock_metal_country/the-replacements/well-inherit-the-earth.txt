";Shocking how nothing shocks anymore,";
the message read as it washed ashore   
Skies turn black as my eyes look down
Written on the back are these words I've found:

";We'll inherit the earth but we don't want it
It's been ours since birth, what'cha doin' on it?
We'll inherit the earth but we don't want it
Layin' claim at birth, what'cha doin' on it?";

Waterfalls of grain flow through our hands
We're too weak to stand and too weak to stray
Big trees sway and the air is still
Lovers climb at the top of a hill and say

";We'll inherit the earth but we don't want it
It's been ours since birth, what'cha doin' on it?
We'll inherit the earth but we don't want it
Laid our claim at birth, what'cha doin' on it?";

We watch the world from the padded cell
And our eyes scream what our lips must quell
Oh, well...

{I've been told that the light shines darkness} 
{...it ain't quite the same}
{the dark gales} {if I was off the wall then it's you I bring}
{remains} {they're all frustration whales}
Last bundle of twigs grew strong and young  
We can't hold our tongues at the top of our lungs

We'll inherit the earth but don't tell anybody
It's been ours since birth, and it's ours already
We'll inherit the earth but don't tell anybody
It's been ours since birth, and it's ours already
We'll inherit the earth but don't tell anybody
Don't tell a soul

{mumble}
I got my hands in my pockets and I'm waiting for the day to come
Inherit the earth 
Inherit the earth...
