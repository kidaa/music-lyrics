Raised in the city
Ready to run
Cruise to the lake
Fun fun fun
Disinclined to groove around

Raised in the city
Raised on beers
She gets rubber
In all four gears
Disinclined to lay down

Get outa my way
I can't see it
Outa my way
Can't see no band

Raised in the city
Ready to drop
Cruise to the lake
Call my pop
Tell him that I'm doin' just fine

Raised in the city
Ready to listen
Keep tellin' me
What I been missin'
Why don't you just sit downGet outa my way
I can't see it
Outa my way
Can't see no band

Raised in the city
Ready to run
Cruise to the lake
Fun fun fun
Disinclined to groove around

Raised in the city
Till I'm old
Buy a car maybe
When I'm old
This my goddamn band/Fix my goddamn head 

Outa my way
I can't see it
Outa my way
Can't see no band
Outa my way
I can't see it
Outa my way
Can't see no band
