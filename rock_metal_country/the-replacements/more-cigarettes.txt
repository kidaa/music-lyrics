I don't watch the TV, I watch the clock
Party goin' up there on the block
The neighbors complain that they can hear
I smoke my cigarettes, drink my cola

I need more cigarettes
More cigarettes, I need

Everybody's waiting, sitting on a stool
Black leather jacket and she's oh so cool
Everybody's waiting, they better show
Chased out back all the way homeAt six o'clock batten the hatches
We got cigarettes but ain't got no matches

I put some holes in my filter, holes in my head
I better ??? , I'm reading in bed

I need more cigarettes
Give me more cigarettes, I need
Gotta get more cigarettes
