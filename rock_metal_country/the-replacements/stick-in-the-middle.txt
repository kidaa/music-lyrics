Out east they got heat
But we got mosquitoes
They got a west coast scene
Lemme tell ya where the grass grows
Down south they get so drunk
They think they're gonna piddle
Ah there ain't nowhere to go
When you're stuck right in the middle

Nothing on the left
Nothing on the right
Nothing on the left
Nothing on the right

Stuck in
Stuck in the middle
Stuck in
Stuck in the middleBurgers on the grill
Oh what a thrill
I got a head full of teeth
Got a pocket full of nothing

17, 18, 19, 21
Stuck in the middle
Lemme tell ya is some fun
