Hut..yeah..c'mon

C'mon little kiddie Gary?, get your head on right
C'mon little kiddie Gary?, get your head on straight
You're gonna get her down
You're gonna finger to her
You're gonna suck me down
You're gonna see her out...

Forget about the lights, girl, and the cars
You never heard somebody so far
Grab a hold, gonna hold
You're gonna stick it to her
You're gonna stick it to herGary got a boner
'Cause Gary's got a boner
Gary got a boner
Gary's got a boner now

You locked that door, rolled up that window
Tied your sister up by the fender
I don't know if I will
You're gonna stick it to her
Yes, you're gonna stick it to her

Gary got a boner
Gary's got a boner
Gary's got a soft-on
Enough for more, more, more, more
Let it go
