Do we give it up?           I don't know
Should we give it hell?     I don't know
Are you makin' a fortune?   I don't know
Or don't you wanna tell?    I don't know
Should we give it up?       I don't know
Or hang around some more?   I don't know
Should we buy some beer?    I don't know
Can I use your hairspray?

One foot in the door, the other foot in the gutter
The sweet smell that you adore, yeah I think I'd rather smother.

Should we top it off?       I don't know
It's startin' too slow.     I don't know
Who's behind the board?     I don't know
They tell me he's a dope.   I don't know
What the fuck you sayin'?   I don't know
Our lawyer's on the phone.  I don't know
How much are you in for?    I don't know
What did we do now?

One foot in the door, the other one in the gutter
The sweet smell that they adore, I think I'd rather smother

One foot in the door, the other one in the gutter
The sweet smell that they adore, well I think I'd rather smother

4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12

Are you guys still around?  I don't know
Whatcha gonna do with your lives?  Nothin'!

One foot in the *fuckup*, the other one in the gutter
The sweet smell that you adore, hey I think I'd rather smother

One foot in this door, the other one in the gutter
The sweet smell that they adore, oh I think I'd rather smother
