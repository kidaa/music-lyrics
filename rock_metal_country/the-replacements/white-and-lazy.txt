I can wake up in the morning
Gonna stay up afternoon
Don't lie in a stutter
Get myself in my mood, yeah

Gonna get the corner baker
And I'll attend to my maker
I don't take no cigarettes
They got a mood

Gonna spend my money on a sweet and sexy
Girl around, make me jealous
I can't a cannibal					Not sure about
too fuckin'weird up to her				this part

Lazy, I'm white, I am sick

Don't guess it's too bad what thermometer said
Gonna take myself medicine

I'll spend my money on a swingin chick
Return around and make sick
And I got some money
Till we flyI'm lazy, I'm white, and I'm sick

1,2,3,4
Lazy! I'm lazy
White! I'm white
Lazy! I'm lazy
Sick of nothing

Lazy! I'm lazy
White! White
Lazy! Lazy
Sick of nothing

Lazy! Lazy
White! White
Lazy! Lazy
Sick of white!
