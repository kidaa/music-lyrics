A million baby kisses
from a kissing booth on wheels
this sign is pretty poison
on the envelope she seals
and your love is by the way
who knows exactly how she feels
Whose torture
without you, it's torture
what new

You climb into your rocket ship
and count from ten to one
there's no television coverage
for that loser on the run
you hide yourself in darkness
but we're heading for the sun

Whose torture
torture ooh
without you, yeah torture
torture ooh
what to do, it's torture
torture ooh
without you, it's torture
torture ooh
Tighter and tighter and tighter soon
yeah tortureAn 809 is rockin
with a party full of lies
and on the tenth floor smokin
till the sun's about to rise
there's trouble in 302
can't you see it in my eyes

Whose torture
torture ooh
without you really torture
torture ooh
what to do, it's torture
torture ooh
without you it's torture
whose torture
