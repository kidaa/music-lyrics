Nightclub jitters, I take a drink before I hit the town
Night life critters scurry to that sultry, smoky sound
Hurry now the sun is goin' down
To the nightclub jitters, only thing that scares me is the dark
The night life critters: ";What's the cover?  Where should we park?";
Stay at home just once for a lark.
They say ";Now don't be a stranger.";
It really don't matter to me
I'd be willing to wager
That it don't matter much if we keep in touch

Nightclub jitters, I take a drink before I hit the town
Night life critters, they scurry to that sultry smoky sound
Oh hurry now the sun is goin' down
They say ";Now don't be a stranger.";
Hell, it really don't matter to me
I'd be willing to wager
That it don't matter much if we keep in touch
Don't matter much 'cause I got a touch
