Give me a little stinkin' fresh air
Ninety days/night and day in the electric chair
Step right up son
Gonna show you something ain't never been done
You're all fucked

Listen, it don't cost much
I lay down the line that you touch
Never do what you're told
There'll be time, believe me, when you're old
You're all wrong and I'm right

Please be on your honor
Please be on your side [...sucker?]back in here

Listen to the story all right
I'm losing all I own on that dotted line
Step right up son
Gonna show you something ain't never been done
You're all wrong and I'm right

You see I want it in writing, I owe you nothing
          want it in writing, I owe you nothing
          want it in writing
