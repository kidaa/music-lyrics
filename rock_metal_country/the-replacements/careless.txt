Yeah
Irresponsibility's my closest friend
Forget my duty I couldn't give a shit obliation   
Tell my about the city ordinance
Tell me that we're insubordinate
Plan tomorrow, money to borrow
I couldn't care less, care less
Couldn't care less, care less
I'm careless, careless
And that's the way I stayI never pay attention, watch my step
Never pay my bills, way in debt
Tell my about the fuckin' ordinance
Tell me that we're insubordinate
Plan tomorrow, money to borrow
I couldn't care less, care less
Couldn't care less, care less
So careless, careless
Yeah that's the way I stay
Stay
Careless, careless ....
Yeah careless is the way I'll stay
