Rip out the table
we need room to move
in a life unstable
you're so easily amused
anywhere you hang
yourself is home
throw in a tape, fix the tone

Someone take the wheel
and I don't know where we're going
anybody say what your feel
back home I guess it's still snowing

The windows are dirty let's hope it rains
add another newspaper
something to do with my change
I see we're fighting again
In some fucking land
throw in another tape man

Someone take the wheel
and I don't know where we're going
anybody say what you feel
everybody's sad, but nobody's showingShow me one night
kiss until a long time
show me one night
show

the music is pounding
out in that rain
and we're standing in the shadows
forever on the brink
turn it up so I don't have to think

Someone take the wheel
and I don't care where we're going
anybody say what you feel
everybody's sad, but nobody's showing

Someone take the wheel
someone take the wheel
