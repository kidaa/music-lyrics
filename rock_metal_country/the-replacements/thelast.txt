Does it hurt to fall in love so easy
does it hurt to fall in love so fast
does it hurt you to find out
thirty-second hand
is it such a big task
such a big task
are you too proud to ask
remember last one was your last

It's too early to run to mama
it's too late to run like hell
I guess I would tell ya
cause it don't work to ask
that this one be your last
and this one child is killing you
this one's your last chance
to make this last one really the last

Oh are you too proud to ask
is it such a big task
remember last one was your lastThe next one's always
gonna last for always
the next one's always on me

Would it help to fall in love a little slower
I know it hurts at any speed
so you have another drink
and get down on your knees
you been swearing to God
now maybe if you'd ask
that this one be your last
cause this one child is killing you
this one's your last chance
to make this last one really the last

gonna last for always
it's gotta last for always
