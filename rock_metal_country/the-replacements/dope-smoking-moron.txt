Saw your van on the sand and I don't understand
Tell me why you do it cause you understand
Look at where you're goin before you go insane
Your pills and your booze and you're not the same

Dope smokin moron don't make me yawn
Dope smokin moron don't make me yawn
Dope smokin moron don't make me
Don't make me
Don't make me yawn

I keep thinking wonderin why you do it to yourself
You parents say you do it your way      ???
You're cruisin, you're losin it on the side
Take this turn, keep doin it you're gonna die

Hey, Merle, I was wonderin'... if ya had any 'ludes on ya?
