Stay right there, go no further
Don't get a doctor, don't get my mother
It's too far to walk, gotta decide
Turn around, we're takin' a ride

So take another pill from your purse
Take a little ride in a hearse
We're takin a ride
We're takin a ride
We're takin a ride

Going real fast, hanging out the window
Drinking in the back seat, half the bottle/at full throttle
The light was green, so was I
The radio's blasting, turn that shit off

90 miles an hour, slidin' on grease
I got my doubts we'll make it in one piece
Just takin a ride
We're takin a ride
We're takin a ride

Stay right there, go no further
Don't get a doctor, don't get your mother
Out of the car, your hands on the hood
Takin a ride but it's doin' no good
