Oh, no...O.K..tape's rolling...so what

I hate music
Sometimes I don't
I hate music
It's got too many notes

I hate my high school
Sometimes I went
I hate music, man
Never heaven sent

Tommy says so
Tommy says so
Tommy says so
Tommy says so so so so whatI hate my father
One day I won't
I hate my father
Just get off my back

I hate music
It's got too many notes
Are you listening?
So
Tommy says so
Tommy says so
Tommy says so

I hate music
Sometimes I don't
I hate my father
One day I won't
I hate music
Turnin' me on
I hate music
