You're about to leave him now
Heard it all before
Suppose me to believe it now

Go while you can
Go while you can

Stay a while he's sleepin now
I thought you would
Don't seem to feel it now
You been doin okay If it ain't doin' no good?Go while you can
Go while you can

Stay and close your eyes
Stay with me
Stay and close your eyes

Go
Go
Go
Go Go while you can
Go while you can
