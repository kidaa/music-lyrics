Well you know
and you go
When I'm alone I have no cause
to think about the shit we used to know
Made of snow             

Well you came             
and you stayed   
No one here to raise a toast             
Be my guest and I will be a host
To a rock 'n' roll ghost                 

Well, you said,
";He's better off dead";
You think that I might have heard a word  
but I was much too young                 
and much too cool for words
Look at me nowNo one here to raise a toast
Take me by the hand, man, raise a toast
A rock 'n' roll ghost
To a rock 'n' roll ghost      

We don't know until we're gone
There's no one here to raise a toast
I look into the mirror and I see
A rock 'n' roll ghost
A rock 'n' roll ghost
