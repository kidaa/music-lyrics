Your radio is playing rather loud
It don't sound like me
Your attitude seems so proud
That don't bother me

I'm gonna keep on knocking
Gonna keep on pounding
I'm gonna knock I'm gonna pound
I'm gonna knock I'm gonna pound
I'm gonna kick your door down
Gonna kick your door down

I wonder what goes on
Behind closed doors
I'm waiting outside your door
Don't enter more
