The feeling you're getting
is downright depressing
do you foresee
a way out for me

Well it's not my problem
to help you solve them
do you wanna go through it
do you really wanna do it
Don't you wanna be my little problem
don't you wanna be my little problem

Probably tell your friends
you were on a bet
but I'm a man of pieces
that you're never gonna mend
Let's put it together
some way, somehow
something's wrong
but I can't stop now, no...

Don't you wanna be my little problem
slide up next to me any time
don't you wanna be my little problemI never had a problem
till I knew you'd try to solve it
well I never had a problem
don't you...
till I told you yeah

The feeling you're getting
is downright depressing
do you foresee
a way out for me

I never had a problem
till I met you try to solve 'em
oh I never had a problem
don't you wanna
don't you wanna be my little problem

shup up next to me any time
don't worry I can see my little problem
don't you wanna be my little problem
My little problem
my little problem
