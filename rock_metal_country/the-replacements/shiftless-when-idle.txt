Everybody that's on my block
They're tired of me that ain't no shock
And I ain't got no idols
I ain't got much taste
I'm shiftless when I'm idle
I got time to waste

They tried to tell me that I should learn
They told me it's best I wait my turn
I can't wait forever
I can't wait that long
I'm shiftless when I'm idle
I want to play this ...

I'm shiftless when I'm idle
I'm shiftless when I'm idle
I'm shiftless
I'm shiftless
