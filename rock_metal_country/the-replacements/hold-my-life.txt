Well, well, well I, found it's [my life]
Down on all fives
Let me crawl
If I want, I could dye...my hair

Time for decisions to be made                
Crack up in the sun, lose it in the shade

Razzle, dazzle, drazzle, drone, time for this one to come home
Razzle, dazzle, drazzle, die, time for this one to come alive
and hold my life until I'm ready to use it
Hold my life because I just might lose it
Because I just might lose it

Well, well, well, anyone could tell, pass it off, a lucky shot
Ooh, they do hate 'em, someday soon, face em
Time for decisions to be made
Crack up in the sun, lose it in the shade

Razzle, dazzle, drazzle, drone, time for this one to come home
Razzle, dazzle, drazzle, die, time for this one to come alive
and hold my life until I'm ready to use it
Hold my life because I just might lose it   
Because I just might lose it

Just might, just might, just might
We might crack up in the sun, or we'll lose it in the shade

Razzle, dazzle, drazzle, drone, time for this one to come home
Razzle, dazzle, drazzle, die, time for this one to come alive 
Hold my life until I'm ready to use it 
Hold my life because I just might lose it   
because I just might lose it

I want you to hold my life
Get ready to hold my life
Hold my, hold my, hold my, hold my...
