Sovereign fingers scrape our lives until we are bought
Screaming comatose with blackboard chalk
Siphoned minds suck a wallet full of love
Spitting out a language I don't wanna talk

Mother of the free she said that we'd breathe
Mother of the free but we just scream

To me the coronation's another auto-da-fe
Taught in schools to see her as a glorious being
I don't see happy homes but the Belfast wall
In Walkman sounds hear Sony control

Mother of the free she said that we'd breathe
Mother of the free but we just scream

Mother of the free she said that we'd breathe
Mother of the free but we just scream

Parliament mother of United Nations
Mother of history's dead sun, dead suns
DNA of restriction and law
Death, famine, spectacle and war

Mother of the free she said that we'd breathe
Mother of the free but we just scream

Mother of the free but we just scream
Mother of the free but we just scream
