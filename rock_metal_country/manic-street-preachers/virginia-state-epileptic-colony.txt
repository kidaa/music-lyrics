They sit around tables rendered dumb
Coloured sticks of chalk are passed around
Today the doctors allow the illusion of choice
Tomorrow the necks split, there is no voice

Draw a perfect circle, sleep foetus-like
Six chalk colours the very meaning of life
They wake to strobes and half circled light
confusion lifts with potassium percolate

V-S-E-C piggy
Piggy piggy
Piggy piggy

Clean - cooking - flower-arranging
Dissolves a kind of liberation
