Find your faith in your cocaine
The only god I need is a brain
Jam your brain with broken heroes
Love your masks and adore your chains

Babes on the run with poisoned lips
Strap your arms round this everlasting kiss
Drop your culture of consumption
This is a culture of destruction

Don't wanna see your face
Don't wanna hear your words
Why don't you just fuck off

Don't wanna see your face
Don't wanna hear your words
Why don't you just fuck off

We're a mess of eyeliner and spraypaint
D.I.Y. destruction on chanel chic
...
...

Your school your dole and your chequebook dreams
Your clothes your suits and your pension schemes
Now you say you know how we feel
But don't fall in love cos we hate you still

Don't wanna see your face
Don't wanna hear your words
Why don't you just fuck off

Don't wanna see your face
Don't wanna hear your words
Why don't you just fuck off

..., oh yeah
..., oh yeah
..., oh yeah
...
