I'm going down to suicide alley
'Cos the air that I breathe tastes better down there

I'm going down to suicide alley
'Cos it seems as if, as if it's the only place for me

And I'm going down to suicide alley
Where you can't get at me
And I'm going down to suicide alley
Where I can be what I want to be

I'm going down to suicide alley
'Cos the air that I breathe tastes better down there

I'm going down to suicide alley
'Cos it seems as if, as if it's the only place for me

And I'm going down to suicide alley
Where you can't get at me
And I'm going down to suicide alley
Where I can be what I want to be

You won't eat away at my mind with your ideas of decency
I'll be in suicide alley being who and what I want to be

You won't eat away at my mind with your ideas of decency
I'll be in suicide alley being who and what I want to be
