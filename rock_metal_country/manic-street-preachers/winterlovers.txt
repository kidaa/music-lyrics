Winter lovers, Winter trees
The beauty of, dead industry
The stuff we have saved, so fataly
Comes crashing down, around me

Winter longing, falling free
Shielding what we need to see
A deep true love of this country

Winter is as winter was
I look this way just because
Winter lovers, love like brothers
Gives us hope for..........

Winter longing, falling free
Shielding what we need to see
A deep true love of this country

Winter lovers, Winter trees
Winter longing, falling free
Shielding what we need to see
