Everyone is staring with the glaze of obsession
Interlocking cartels bypassing the bone
The empty statement of artschool dissension
Institutionalised expression of mass control

And if when America flings in whole
Your pile of misery where centuries be
And he does win a holiday after a poll
One per cent interest stand up with glee

Soul contamination spreads the germs of finance
Making weak minds think this is what they want
Power facts are brutally sold to worn darkened skin
Arise the new scum arise to the sound of a drum

With your desk degrees in civil engineering
They're drawing up plans for a future for themselves
And sweet daddy buys up a university
On a mission tied next to suits

Soul contamination - die because you crossed by fire
Soul contamination - poverty expressed in your heart
Soul contamination - arise, surrender, burn
Soul contamination - do you rise up
