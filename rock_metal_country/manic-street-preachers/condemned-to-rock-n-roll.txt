Always feeling torn and slow
Love song cull destroy poem
Misery and trauma making love
Best go shoot the fucking doves
The past is so beautiful
The future like a corpse in snow
I think it's all the fucking same
It's a life sentence babe

A line of vodka tears inside
A shot of boredom helps my mind
Staring through a thousand dead eyes
I guess my nerves are brutalised

Lips I kiss just another plague
Love can't fix the hole they made
Condemned to rock n'
Condemned to rock n' roll

No innocent exit when hope dies
And claustrophobia buys my mind
I ran to breathe contagious lies
No reasons for just living life
Ripcord opens but my soul is cold
With you I never felt more alone
Skin never sweating dignity
Kept my line beneath ecstasy

This fragile prison of sanity
An ocean wave to death babe
Masochistic love going nowhere
You're nothing, pestilience, a seed

Lips I kiss just another plague
Love can't fix the hole they made
Condemned to rock n'
Oblivions all we know

Lips I kiss just another plague
Lips I kiss just another plague
Love can't fix the hole they made

Sterile like a line of piss, motherfucker
Review with avant garde lips, you're just a motherfucker

There's nothing I wanna see
There's nowhere I wanna go
