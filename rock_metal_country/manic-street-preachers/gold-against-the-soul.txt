Somebody told me to vote conservative
Tragedy is not known under this dimmest of lights
Everybody feels sick by the courtesy of dismay
Was I schooled without direction

Gold against the soul
Rock n' roll has a conscience
It supplies convenience
Gold against
Against the soul
Against the soul

Close the pits sanctify Roy Lynk an O.B.E.
Shareholding a piece of this fucking country
Fossilize - make Yorkshire into a tourist resort
And dream of new ways to humble the poor

Gold against the soul
White liberal hates slavery
Needs Thai labour to clean his home
Gold erodes
Erodes the soul
Erodes the soul

A 1000 Marlboro death ignored everyday
And who gives a shit about sexuality

Gold against the soul
Working class cliches start here
Either cloth caps of smack victims
Gold destroyed
Destroyed the soul
Destroyed the soul
