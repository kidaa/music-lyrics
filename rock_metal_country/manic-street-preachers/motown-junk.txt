Never ever wanted to be with you 
All you ever gave me was the boredom I suffocate in 
Adrift in cheap dreams don't stop the rain 
Numbed out in piss towns just wanna dig their graves 

Motown, Motown Junk 
I laughed when Lennon got shot 
21 years of living and nothing means anything to me 

Motown Junk a lifetime of slavery 
Songs of love echo underclass betrayal 
Stops your heart beating for 168 seconds 
Stops your brain thinking for 168 seconds 
Motown junk, Motown junk, Motown junk, Motown junk 

I don't want cos I just get 
All your slut heroes offer is a fear of the future 
Past made useless cos I'm dying now 
Communal tyranny a jail that bleeds our wrists 

Motown, Motown Junk 
I laughed when Lennon got shot 
21 years of living and nothing means anything to me 

Motown Junk a lifetime of slavery 
Songs of love echo underclass betrayal 
Stops your heart beating for 168 seconds 
Stops your brain thinking for 168 seconds 
Motown junk, Motown junk, Motown junk, Motown junk 

Motown Junk a lifetime of slavery 
Songs of love echo underclass betrayal 
Stops your heart beating for 168 seconds 
Stops your brain thinking for 168 seconds 
Motown junk, Motown junk, Motown junk, Motown junk 

We live in urban hell, we destroy rock and roll
