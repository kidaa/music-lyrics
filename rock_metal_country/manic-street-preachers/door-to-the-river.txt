I'm losing all my innocence
Door to the river
I know I've stopped making much sense
Door to the river
I think I'll leave and I'll take some rest
Door to the river 

All my best wishes are just lies
Are just lies 

I'd love to see colours like you
Door to the river
Resurrected and feeling blue
Door to the river
I've seen the glory and yes it's true
Door to the river 

Fearful of the future now
The future is now
But it's true the things you feel don't go
The people that you love hold on 

Baby I lost my way
Following our star
But I guess that's just how you are
How you are 

The majesty, the majesty
Door to the river
Pre-eminent amongst the free
Door to the river
Happy and drifting endlessly
Door to the river 

All my best wishes are just lies
Are just lies
Sun breaks and cloudbursts
The hardest of all words
The conflict of sin all kept within 

Baby I lost my way
Following our star
But I guess that's just how you are
How you are
Just how you are
How you are
