This girl's got nothing and she wears her heart on her wrist
She swears by her attitude and the smile she never gives
But she's got me
Oh, she's got me

This girl's got nothing
This girl's got nothing
But she's got me
But she's got me

This girl's got nothing and she wears her heart on her wrist
She swears by her attitude and the smile she never gives

This girl's got nothing
This girl's got nothing
This girl's got nothing
This girl's got nothing
But she's got me

This girl's got nothing and she wears her heart on her wrist
She swears by her attitude and the smile she never gives

This girl's got nothing
This girl's got nothing

Let's get this straight girl, you love me
Let's get this straight girl, you love me
Let's get this straight girl, you love me
Let's get this straight girl, you love me
Let's get this straight girl, you love me
Let's get this straight girl, you love me
Let's get this straight girl, you love me
Let's get this straight girl, you love me
