Isn't it lovely, when the dawn brings the dew?
I'll be watching over you
Isn't it lovely, when the dawn brings the dew?
I'll be watching over you

Goodnight my sweetheart
Until we leave tonight
Hold me in your arms
Wish me some luck as you wave goodbye to me

You're the best friends I ever had
Goodnight, sleep tight
Goodnight, God bless
Goodnight, nos da
I'll try my best

Isn't it lovely, when the dawn brings the dew?
I'll be watching over you
Isn't it lovely, when the dawn brings the dew
I'll be watching over you

I will be waiting all my cares are for you
Dreams they leave and die
I'm just gonna close my eyes, think about my family
And shed a little tear

Goodnight, sleep tight
Goodnight, God bless
Goodnight, nos da,
I'll try my best

Isn't it lovely, when the dawn brings the dew?
I'll be watching over you
Isn't it lovely, when the dawn brings the dew?
I'll be watching over you

Leave me, go Jesus
I love you, yeah I love you
Just let me go
I even love the devil
For yes he did me harm
To keep me any longer
'Cos I'm really tired
I'd love to go to sleep and wake up happy
Yeah I'm really tired
I'd love to go to sleep and wake up happy,
Wake up happy.
