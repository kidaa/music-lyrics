I live to fall asleep
It's when I stop the hate
I never want to dream
It infiltrates beauty

I live to fall asleep
Regenerate and sin
Skin so tense gives in
I've lived enough to kill

When did you become another distant friend
Everyone who loved you stayed waited till the end
When did you become another distant friend
Everyone who loved you stayed waited till the end
Oh, when did you decide that sleep could save your life
How could you become another boy struck dumb
How could you become another boy struck dumb with love

I live to fall asleep
I live to fall asleep

I live to fall asleep
it helps me through the day
Drink has never dulled
a pain so deep does run

I live to fall asleep
serene alone happy
Holding on to screams
waiting for the time

When did you become another distant friend
Everyone who loved you stayed waited till the end
When did you become another distant friend
Everyone who loved you stayed waited till the end
Oh, when did you decide that sleep could save your life
How could you become another boy struck dumb
How could you become another boy struck dumb with love

I live to fall asleep
I live to fall asleep

So lazy, lazy, lazy
Chuck down all the pills
Needing to remember how and why to live
Oh, when did you decide that sleep could save your life
How could you become another boy struck dumb
How could you become another boy struck dumb with love

I live to fall asleep
I live to fall asleep
