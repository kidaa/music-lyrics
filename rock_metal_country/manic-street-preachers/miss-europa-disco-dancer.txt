Miss Europa disco dancer
I'm in heaven when I see ya

Favourite son and favourite daughter

Suck - suck - suck up all of your power

So serene, the world turns blue
Heads are spinning - it feels so good
It's poetry, sheer poetry
The way you destroy your beauty

Wake up drunk and then fall over

So messed up, the world turns grey
All washed up with debts to pay
It's agony, sheer agony
The way your life just fades away

So serene, the world turns blue
Heads are spinning - it feels so good
It's poetry, sheer poetry
The way you destroy your beauty

So messed up, the world turns grey
All washed up with debts to pay
It's agony, sheer agony
The way your life just fades away
