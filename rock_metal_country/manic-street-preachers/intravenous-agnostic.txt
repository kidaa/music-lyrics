Into a vein exhibit the derelict 
A secular mosaic distracted at birth
A Cubist abstraction let it live forever
Narcissim so lonely so live by the sea

What a mess

Cosmetic - polemic 
Distinguished by relics 
Destructive aesthetic 
Intravenous agnostic 
Intravenous agnostic 
Intravenous agnostic 
Intravenous agnostic 
Intravenous 

Brutality is needed in capitalist society 
Television abandoned my very entity 
Nature failed me 
But then it made me 
We all pray for pluralist babies 

Cosmetic - polemic 
Distinguished by relics 
Destructive aesthetic 
Intravenous agnostic 
Intravenous agnostic 
Intravenous agnostic 
Intravenous agnostic 
Intravenous 

Dismayed - dispossessed 
Life becomes Calvanist 
So sparkle and believe 
Linguistics die easily 

Intravenous agnostic

Intravenous agnostic
