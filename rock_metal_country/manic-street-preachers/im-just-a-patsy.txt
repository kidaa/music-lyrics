I am just a patsy
The Oswald in Lee Harvey
Made of my own misery
The footprints of history

I am just a patsy
I sell vague conspiracy
I'm slow and I'm easy
And I'm waiting for delivery

I'm just a patsy for your love
I need an angel from above
To a life depraved and lost
Inevitable like scars and dust
I'm just a patsy for your love

Even with the most control
Tied to fragments born and grown
All fucked up with nowhere to go
The best thing I ever saw

I am just a patsy
I sell vague conspiracy
I'm slow and I'm easy
And I'm waiting for delivery

I'm just a patsy for your love
I need an angel from above
To a life depraved and lost
Inevitable like scars and dust
I'm just a patsy for your love, love, love
A patsy for your love, love, love

I am just a patsy

I'm just a patsy for your love
I need an angel from above
To a life depraved and lost
Inevitable like scars and dust
I'm just a patsy for your love
