Pretend prayer
Pretend care
Makes everything seem so fair
These perfect abattoirs
These perfect actors
These perfect abattoirs

Only a god can bruise
Only a god can soothe
Only a god reserves the right
To forgive those that revile him
Only a god can bruise
Only a god can soothe
Only a god reserves the right
To forgive those that revile him

Oh, such love
Sweet stimulus
PG certificate and cuts unfocused
Stitches and wounds
Doctored divinity
So much love there's blind affinity

Only a god can bruise
Only a god can soothe
Only a god reserves the right
To forgive those that revile him
Only a god can bruise
Only a god can soothe
Only a god reserves the right
To forgive those that revile him
