The nothing in me 
The apostle in me 
No interpretation 
For the heart of me 

I can't see right from my wrong 
I've loved so much that I can't go on 

It's not my life anymore 
Don't speak the truth anymore 
All of the hope and the dreams 
Ripped right open at the seams 

I can't see right from my wrong 
I've loved so much that I can't go on 

Seems like I've lost myself 
To everybody and everything else 
I've lied again today 
People laugh at it all the time 

I can't see right from my wrong 
I've loved so much that I can't go on 

It's not my life anymore 
Don't speak the truth anymore 
All of the hope and the dreams 
Ripped right open at the seams 

I can't see right from my wrong 
I've loved so much that I can't go on 

The nothing in me 

The nothing in me 
The apostle in me 
No interpretation 
For the heart in me 

The nothing in me 
The apostle in me 
The nothing in me 
The apostle in me 

The nothing in me
