Oh well

American trilogy in Lancashire Pottery
American trilogy in Lancashire Pottery
Is so fucking funny, don't you know
Is so fucking funny, don't you know

All American trilogy in used up cars and bottled beer
All American trilogy the futures dead, fundamentally
It's so fucking funny, it's absurd
It's so fucking funny, it's absurd

20ft. high on Blackpool promenade.

I wish I was in Dixie
Hooray! Hooray!
In Dixie Land, I'll take my stand
To live and die in Dixie
