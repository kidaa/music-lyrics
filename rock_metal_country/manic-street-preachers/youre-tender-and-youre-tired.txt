You're so fragile tonight
Been up hurting all night
It's not trivial like they think
Yes you're desperate and you're hurt

Thought about it so many times
Too afraid to open your eyes
To see the sadness that's inside
Just sit back in and stop time

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

But it's too late to be real
No time to be strong enough
Just time to leave it all behind
Memory has become pain

Rebuild the void with flowers
Sad eyed destruction build around sand and sea
Yes you can build your yourself around
Build yourself around me, yourself around me

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life

You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life
Drift away and die
Never say goodbye
Drift away and die
Never say goodbye
Drift away and die
Never say goodbye
Drift away and die
