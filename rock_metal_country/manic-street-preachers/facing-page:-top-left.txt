Here I am, rise and shine
Way down of course I smile
Here is hospitality skin care tones
Clean flesh and lines tainted UV protection

This beauty here dipping neophobia

Here I am rise and shine
Way down of course I cry
Here is oblivion bathed acid red
Mutually discolour, skin cancer, calories

Private care, sugar pills, the flak of healing.
Fragrance my escort of no meaning
This beauty here dipping neophobia.
