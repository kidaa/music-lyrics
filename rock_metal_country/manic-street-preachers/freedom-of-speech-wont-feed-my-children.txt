Liberty, sweet liberty 
Charitable respectability 
Then pacifism killed us all 
For all the tourists on the Berlin wall 
So we protest about human rights 
Worship obesity as our birthright 
But freedom of speech won't feed my children 
Just brings heart disease and bootleg clothing 
Just brings heart disease and bootleg clothing 

We love to kiss the Dalai Lama's ass 
Because he is such a holy man 
Free to eat and buy anything 
Free to fuck from Paris to Beijing 

Little boys with dangerous toys 
All bow down to the Beastie Boys 
But freedom of speech won't feed my children 
Just brings heart disease and bootleg clothing 
Just brings heart disease and bootleg clothing 

Royalty - hereditery - unelected and becalmed 
Just like Stalin, just like Stalin 
Human and useless 

Bomb the Chinese Embassy 
The west is free, oh the west is free 
Laugh at the hammer and sickle 
It is antique, oh it is antique 

And see the love in Richard Gere's eyes 
JS Pemberton saved our lives 
But freedom of speech won't feed my children 
Just brings heart disease and bootleg clothing 
Just brings heart disease and bootleg clothing 
Just brings heart disease and bootleg clothing 
Just brings heart disease and bootleg clothing
