Behave yourself baby and I will be back
Behave yourself baby and I will be back
Behave yourself baby and I will be back now

Baby love, you're not the only thing I'm dreaming of
Baby love, you're not the only thing I'm dreaming of

Baby love, you're not the only thing I'm drinking for
Baby love, you're not the only thing I'm drinking for

All I want from you is the skin you live within
All I want from you is the skin you live within
All I want from you is the skin you live within
All I want from you is the skin you live within
