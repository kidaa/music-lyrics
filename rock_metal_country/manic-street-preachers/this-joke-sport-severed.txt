Loose and guilty and whipped
Sterility prosecutes and I have plenty
Bruised and nailed and quits
Merciful and mourned and meek

Jealousy sows rejection with a kiss
In silken palms that tear bone from skin

This joke sport severed
I endeavoured
To find a place where
I became untethered

This joke sport severs
I endeavoured
To find a place where
I became untethered

Jealousy soaks rejection with a kiss
In silken palms that tear bone from skin

This joke sport severed
I endeavoured
To find a place where
I became untethered
