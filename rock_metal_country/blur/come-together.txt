I don't understand
Walking all over me
All over me to you
You must be mad
And you know you are
You should have known that I'd do
Anything for you

So why, why
Don't we come together
Why?
Why, Why
Don't we come together
Why?

Inside my head
There's nothing left
It's all been taken out by you
And do I care?
Well you know I do
You should have known that I'd do
Anything for you

So why, why
Don't we come together
Why?
Why, Why
Don't we come together
Why?

Now it's all been said
And you know it all
Then you should have known that I'd do
Anything for you

For you
For you
For you
For you

So why, why
Don't we come together
Why?
Why, Why
Don't we come together
Why?
