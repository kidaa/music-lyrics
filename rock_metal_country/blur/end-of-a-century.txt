She said there's ants in the carpet 
Dirty like monsters 
Eating all the morsels 
Picking up the rubbish 
Give her effervescence 
She needs a little sparkle 
Good morning TV 
You're looking so healthy 

We all say 
Don't want to be alone 
We wear the same clothes 
'Cos we feel the same 
And kiss with dry lips 
When we say goodnight 
End of the century... oh, it's nothing special 

Sex on the TV
Everybody's at it 
And the mind gets dirty 
As you get closer to thirty 
Gives her a cuddle 
Glowing in a huddle 
Good night TV 
You're all made up 
And you know that 

We all say
Don't want to be alone 
We wear the same clothes 
'Cos we feel the same 
And kiss with dry lips 
When we say goodnight 
End of the century... oh, it's nothing special 

Can you eat her? Yes you can 

We all say
Don't want to be alone 
We wear the same clothes 
'Cos we feel the same 
And kiss with dry lips 
When we say goodnight 
End of the century... oh, it's nothing special
We all say
Don't want to be alone 
We wear the same clothes 
'Cos we feel the same 
And kiss with dry lips 
When we say goodnight 
End of the century... oh, it's nothing special
Oh, end of a century, oh
It's nothing special
