He makes an inner arm block
Then kicks him behind
The lights, they go off
But he can fight blind
Cos he got the touch
But he won't live long
He comes from Hong Kong
Where justice is done
Chinese bombs
Millions jump
Chairman's junk
USA
Won't somebody
Won't somebody
Sink this place
Got a cab to go to Soho
The dragon said go
Let everyone know
That you got the touch
You come from Hong Kong
Where justice is done
Where people are strong
But you won't live long
Chinese bombs
Millions jump
Chairman's junk
To Hong Kong
Bruce Lee come
Save the day
Bruce Lee come
It's the Chinese way
