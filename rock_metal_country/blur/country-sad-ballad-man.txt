Yeah, I found nowhere
It got to know me
Let me sleep all day
Spend the money
I haven't felt my legs
Since the summer
And I don't call my friends
Forgot their numbers
VIP 223
I've had my chances
Or did they have me
Now stay up nights
Watch TV
I'm country sad
I'm a ballad man
I'm on the comeback road
Yeah, I'm a blizzard
And in my motor home
Sweat on my pillow all night
VIP 223
I've had my chances
Or did they have me
Now stay up nights
Watch TV
I'm country sad
I'm a ballad man
I'm a ballad man...
