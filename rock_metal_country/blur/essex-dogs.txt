I remember thinking murder in the car
Watching dogs somersault through sprinklers on tiny lawns
I remember the graffiti
We're your children coming in with spray cans of paint
I remember the sunsets and the plains of cement
And the way the night just seemed to turn the colour of orangeade
In this town, cellular phones are hot with teens
In this town, we all go to terminal pubs
It helps us sweat out those angry bits of life
In this town, the English army grind their teeth into glass
You know you'll get a kicking tonight
The smell of puke and piss
The smell of puke and piss on your stilettos
Here comes that panic attack
My heart stops
And then it starts
Give me a drink
I'll drink your round
I take you round the pole
It's cold up here I see the universe waiting by a minibus
You'll catch the flu
Or you'll catch the city
Either way you'll catch the flu
Or you'll catch the city
