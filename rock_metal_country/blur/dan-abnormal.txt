Meanie leanie
Come on down
Come and entertain the town
It's Friday night and we're all bored
Time's been called
There is no more
Time's been called
It's such a bore

Dan Abnormal
Not normal at all
It's not his fault
We made him this way
He'll imitate you
Try to ape you
But it's not his fault
Dan watches TV

The meanie leanie stays up late
Mopes around
Gets in a state
The killer in your arcade
Shooting gangsters
Ready-made
'Cos that is where
The future's made
Teleport me

Dan went to his local burger bar
 I want McNormal and chips
Or I'll blow you to bits
Give us it 

It's the miseries at half-past three
Watching video nasties
He has dirty dreams when he's asleep
Dan's just like you and me
He's the meanie leanie
Altogether now...

Dan Abnormal
Not normal at all
Oh, it's not his fault
We made him this way
He'll imitate you
Try to ape you
But it's not his fault
Dan Abnormal's 
Me
