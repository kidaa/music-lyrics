Grandma's got new dentures 
To eat the crust on pizza 
Been taken out by her daughter 
Because she thought she ought'a 
The kids are eating snickers 
Because they're so delicious 
Then there's sticky fingers 
And mother loses her knickers 

Bank holiday comes six times a year 
Days of enjoyment to which everyone cheers 
Bank holiday comes with a six pack of beer 
....then its back to work A.G.A.I.N. 

Bar-b-que is cooking 
Sausages and chicken 
The patio is buzzing 
The neighbours they are looking 
John is down the fun pub 
Drinking lots of lager 
Girls and boys are on the game 
And all the high streets look the same 

Bank holiday comes six times a year 
Days of enjoyment to which everyone cheers 
Bank holiday comes with a six pack of beer 
....then its back to work A.G.A.I.N. 

Back to work A.G.A.I.N. 

Bank holiday comes six times a year 
Days of enjoyment to which everyone cheers 
Bank holiday comes with a six pack of beer 
....then its back to work A.G.A.I.N. 

Bank Holiday!
