Do you do anything you ever do?
No she said
Do you want anything you ever wanted?
No she said

She don't know how
How to feel
This is a bad day
This is a bad day
To know

Do you have anything you ever had?
No she said
Do you love anyone you ever loved?
Yes she said

She don't know how
How to feel
This is a bad day
This is a bad day
To know
She don't know how
How to feel
This is a bad day
This is a bad day
To know

Listen to the good, that's it for real

She don't know how
How to feel
This is a bad day
This is a bad day
To know
She don't know how
How to feel
This is a bad day

Sing 
Can't feel
'Cos I'm numb
Can't feel
'Cos I'm numb
So what's the worth
In all of this
This...
What's the worth
In all of this

Sing to me
Sing to me

So what's the worth
In all of this
This...
If the child in your head
If the child is dead

Sing to me
Sing to me

Sing to me
