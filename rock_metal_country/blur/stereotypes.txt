The suburbs they are dreaming
They're a twinkle in her eye
She's been feeling frisky since her husband said goodbye
She wears a low cut T-shirt
Runs a little B B
She's most accomodating when she's in her lingerie
Wife-swapping is your future
You know that it would suit ya 

Yes 
They're stereotypes
There must be more to life
All your life you're dreaming
And then you
Stop dreaming
From time to time you know you should be
Going on another bender

The suburbs they are sleeping
But he's dressing up tonight
She likes a man in uniform
He likes to wear it tight
They're on the lovers' sofa
They're on the patio
And when the fun is over
Watch themselves on video
The neighbours may be staring
But they are just past caring

Yes
There must be more to life
Than stereotypes
All your life you're dreaming
And then you
Stop dreaming
From time to time you know
You should go on another bender

Yes
The stereotypes
There must be more to life
All your life you're dreaming
And then you
Stop dreaming
Time to time you know
You should be going on another bender
Yes
There must be more to life
Than stereotypes
All your life you're dreaming
And then you
Stop dreaming
From time to time you know
You should go on another bender
Before you come to offend her
