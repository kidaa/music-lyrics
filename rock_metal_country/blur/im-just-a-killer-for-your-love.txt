I heard a man who had no lungs 
He took me in and made me lunch 
Told me how I'd lost a friend    
You smiled at me it was the end 
And I said,
I'm just a killer for your love
I'm just a killer for your love
I'm just a killer for your love
I'm just a killer for your love
Cut my hair off in the road    
I take my coat off, drop my load 
Wipe my hands on the grass    
Cos now I know nothing ever lasts 
I'm just a killer for your love
I'm just a killer for your love
I'm just a killer for your love
I'm just a killer for your love
