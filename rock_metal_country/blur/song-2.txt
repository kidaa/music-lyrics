I got my head checked
By a jumbo jet
It wasn't easy
But nothing is, no
Whoo hoo!
Well I feel heavy metal
Whoo hoo!
And I'm pins and I'm needles
Whoo hoo!
Well I lie and I'm easy
All of the time and I'm never sure why I need you
Pleased to meet ya 
I got my head done
When I was young
It's not my problem
It's not my problem
Whoo hoo!
Well I feel heavy metal
Whoo hoo!
And I'm pins and I'm needles
Whoo hoo!
Well I lie and I'm easy
All of the time and I'm never sure why I need you
Pleased to meet ya
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah
