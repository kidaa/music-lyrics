I am the message centre 
Local and direct 
Room to room an operator 
No calls today they'll just have to wait dear 
I call and I collect 
So just strike him softly away from the body 

You're made up too shiny today it's so much trouble 
Thoughts are just pissing away it's so much trouble 
So much trouble

I am the manager 
I am in control 
As the local delegator 
No calls today dear they'll just have to wait dear 
I offer no guarantee at all 
So don't take it lightly you're past your sell by date

You're made up too shiny today it's so much trouble 
Thoughts are just pissing away it's so much trouble 
A new type face and new day it's so much trouble 
You can't remember ten minutes ago it's so much trouble 
Too much trouble 

La la la la la 
La la la la x2

You're past your sell by date
You're made up too shiny today it's so much trouble 
Thoughts are just pissing away it's so much trouble 
A new type face and new day it's so much trouble 
You can't remember ten minutes ago it's so much trouble 
It's too much trouble 

La la la la la
