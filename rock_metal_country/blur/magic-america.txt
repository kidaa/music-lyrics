Bill Barret has a simple dream 
He calls it his plan B
Buildings in the sky and the air is sugar free 
And everyone is very friendly 
Plan B arrived on a holiday 
Took a cab to the shopping malls 
Bought and ate until he could do neither anymore 
Then found love on Channel 44 

La la la la la he wants to go to magic america 
La la la la la he'd like to live in magic america 
With all the magic people 

Bill Barrett sent his postcards home 
To everyone he'd ever known they read 
Fifty nine cents gets you a good square meal 
From the people who care how you feel 

La la la la la he wants to go to magic america 
La la la la la he'd like to live in magic america 
With all the magic people 
La la la la la he wants to go to magic america 
La la la la la he'd like to live in magic america 
With all the magic people 

With all the magic people
fade to end
