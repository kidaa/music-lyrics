Wash with new soap, Behind the collar
Keeps a clean mental state
Don't usually bother in cold weather
But still I'm getting into work late

And I don't need the practice

I've been making plans 
For the future
Become an unconscious man 
All for the good
I feel so unecessary 
We don't think so, you seem starshaped

Have a couple at the weekend, 
Keeps up camaraderie
And my mind boggles in the muddle, 
At the possibilities

And I don't need the practice

I've been making plans 
For the future
Become an unconscious man 
All for the good
I feel so unecessary 
We don't think so, you seem starshaped
And I've been making plans 
For the future
Become an unconscious man 
All for the good
I feel so unecessary 
We don't think so, you seem starshaped

I wash with new soap behind the collar
Helps keep down the laundry
And now I bother in cold weather
Because it cleans me mentally

And I really don't need the practice

I've been making plans 
For the future
Become an unconscious man 
All for the good
I feel so unecessary 
We don't think so, you seem starshaped
I've been making plans 
For the future
Become an unconscious man 
All for the good
I feel so unecessary 
We don't think so, you seem starshaped
