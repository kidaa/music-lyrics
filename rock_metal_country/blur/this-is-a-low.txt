And into the sea goes pretty England and me 
Around the Bay of Biscay and back for tea 
Hit traffic on the Dogger bank 
Up the Thames to find a taxi rank 
Sail on by with the tide and go asleep 
And the radio says 

This is a low 
But it won't hurt you 
When you're alone it will be there with you 
Finding ways to stay solo 

On the Tyne Forth and Cromarty
There's a low in the high forties 
Saturday's locked away on the pier
Not fast enough dear 
And on the Malin Head
Blackpool looks blue and red 
And the queen, she's gone round the bend 
Jumped off Land's End 
And the radio says

This is a low 
But it won't hurt you 
When you are alone it will be there with you 
Finding ways to stay solo 

This is a low 
But it won't hurt you 
When you are alone it will be there with you 
This is a low 
But it won't hurt you 
When you are alone it will be there with you 
Finding ways to stay solo
