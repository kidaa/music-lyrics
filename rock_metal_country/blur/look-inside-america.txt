Good morning, lethargy
Drink Pepsi, it's good for energy
The bath's on, smoke in the bedroom
Sore throat, and on my neck a nasty bruise
And where it came from well I don't know
But we played last night, it was a good show
Got to play a second rate chat show
A nationwide deal, so we gotta go
Chuck from the Company says it'll be alright
Got an ad on KROQ and there's an in-store tonight
Well I build things up, never let them go
Got to get time share on the radio
Look inside America
She's alright, she's alright
Sitting out in the distance
But I'm not trying to make her mine
Looking for America
With its kooky nights and its suicides
TV says its alright
Cos everybody's hung up on something or other
Stepping off in twenty so the driver says
I should sleep tonight but I think I'll watch videos instead
Annie Hall leaves New York in the end
Press rewind and Woody gets her back again
And the whole world could have passed through me
But I don't know that it means much to me
Look inside America
She's alright, she's alright
Sitting out in the distance
But I'm not trying to make her mine
Looking for America
With its kooky nights and its suicides
TV says its alright
Cos everybody's strung out on something or other
And the whole world could have passed through me
But I don't know that it means much to me
