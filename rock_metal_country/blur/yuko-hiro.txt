This is my work place
And these are the people
I work with
Yuko and Hiro
We work together
We work for the company
That looks to the future
We work hard to please them
They will protect us

I never see you
We're never together
I'll love you forever

I drink in the evenings
It helps with relaxing
I can't sleep without drinking
We drink together
From Monday to Saturday
I go to my workplace
But on Sunday
We're together
Yuko and Hiro

I never see you
We're never together
I'll love you forever
