It's up to you
You know it is
I can't convince you
All you have to do is slow down
I've always said it'll never change
All you have to do just to be you
Think that's all I want to say

And all the things
I've ever told you
I didn't mean them all
I didn't mean them all, I'd forget you
So if you come here
If you come here
All you have to do
Just to be you
Think that's all I want to say to you

And all those things
That I'd told you
I didn't them all
Didn't mean them all, I'd forget you
So if you come here
If you come here
All you have to do
Just to be you
Think that's all I need to say to you
