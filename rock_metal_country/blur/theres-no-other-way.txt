You've taken the fun
Out of everything
You're making me run
When I don't want to think
You've taken the fun
Out of everything
I don't want to think at all

There's no other way
There's no other way
All that you can do is watch them play

You've taken the fun
Out of everything
You're making it clear when I don't want to think
You're taking me up when I don't to go up anymore
I'm just watching it all

There's no other way
There's no other way
All that you can do is watch them play
There's no other way
There's no other way
All that you can do is watch them play

Ahh, ahhh, watch you play
Ahh, ahhh, watch you play..

There's no other way
There's no other way
All that you can do is watch them play
There's no other way
There's no other way
All that you can do is watch them play
There's no other way
There's no other way
All that you can do is watch them play
There's no other way
There's no other way
All that you can do is watch them play
