A malady has taken him over 
Coughing tar in his Japanese motor 
The lights are magic 
And he feels lucky 
And he's got money 
Shoots like an arrow - oh 

London loves 
The mystery of a speeding car 
London loves 
The misery of a speeding heart 

Its love u like, and everyone's at it 
And words are cheap when the mind is elastic 
He loves the violence 
Keeps ticking over 
So sleep together 
Before today is sold forever 

London loves 
The way people just fall apart 
London loves 
The way you just don't stand a chance 
London loves 
The mystery of a speeding car 

O-oh o-oh o-oh o-oh 

London loves 
The mystery of a speeding car 
London loves 
The misery of a speeding heart 

London loves 
The mystery 

London loves 
The way people just fall apart 
London loves 
The way we just don't stand a chance 
London loves 
A speeding heart
