Fear of being left behind
Can take you over
Suddenly you will choke
Maybe it's just a joke
I'm not sure of you

I can't hear you now
There's to much that's going around
You seem a worried fool
So I don't think I'm cool
Makes me me insure
Of you

Fear of being left alone
Can take you over
Slowly you will choke
And say it's just a joke
I'm not sure
Of you
