The death of the party
Came as no surprise
Why did we bother
Should've stayed away
Another night
And I thought  Well, well 
Go to another party
And plant myself gently on the shelf
The death of a teenager
Standing on his own
Why did he bother
Should've slept alone
Another night
And I thought  Well, well 
Go to another party
And hang myself gently on the shelf
