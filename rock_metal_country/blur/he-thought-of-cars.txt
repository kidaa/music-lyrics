Moscow's still red
The young man's dead
Gone to heaven instead
The evening news
Says he was confused
The motorways will all merge soon
Lottery winner buys the moon
They've come to save us
The space invaders 

...are here

He thought of cars
And where
Where to drive them
And who to drive them with
But there
There was no-one
No-one

There's panic at London Heathrow
Everybody wants to go
Up into the blue
But there's a ten year queue
Columbia is in top gear
It shouldn't snow this time of year
America's shot
She's gone and done the lot

He thought of planes
And where
Where to fly to
And who to fly there with
But there
There was no-one
No-one

He thought of cars
And where
Where to drive them
And who to drive them with
But there
There was no-one
No-one
