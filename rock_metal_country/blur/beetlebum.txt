Beetlebum, what you done?
She's a gun, now what you done? 
Beetlebum
Get nothing done, you beetlebum
Just get numb, now what you done 
Beetlebum
And when she lets me slip away
She turns me on and all my violence gone
Nothing is wrong, I just slip away
And I am gone
Nothing is wrong
She turns me on
I just slip away and I am gone
Beetlebum, because you're young
She's a gun, now what you done?
Beetlebum
She'll suck your thumb, she'll make you come
Cause she's your gun, now what you done?
Beetlebum
And when she lets me slip away
She turns me on and all my violence gone
Nothing is wrong, I just slip away
And I am gone
There's nothing wrong
She turns me on 
I just slip away and I am...
He's on, he's on, he's on it
He's on, he's on, he's on it
He's on, he's on, he's on it
He's on, he's on, he's on it...
