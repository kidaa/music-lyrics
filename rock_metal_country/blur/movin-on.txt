At the music heist
I met the gourmet man
With aluminium lungs
Sucks out all he can
He sees the whole world goes flip
In a stunt bug style
Cos he's a parasite
With a cellulite pile but he can smile
Cos this is the music
Movin' on, we're movin' on
Hey, this is the music
Movin' on, we're movin' on
Sticky eyes and sticky bones
You get no time on your own
You get a dose and a ghost
You get it coast to coast
Now you dye your hair black
Get Satan tattooed on your back
You pierce yourself with a coke can
And rub yourself with fake tan now you're in a band
Cos this is the music
Movin' on, we're movin' on
Hey, this is the music
Movin' on, we're movin' on
No matter how low
There's always further to go
When you're movin' on, you're movin' on
No matter how low
There's always somewhere to go
Movin on, we're movin' on, won't be long before we're gone
