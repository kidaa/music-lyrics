Lead in me and me in water, Dangling in my world
I swallowed too much oily water, it keeps slipping down my spine

In a sense of self in decline, growing fat on sound
It's only an early morning dream, and the whole world will be alright

CHORUS

My head is full of suspicion, I'm coming home sometime
I've swallowed too much oily water, it keeps slipping down my spine

In a sense of self in decline, lying on my back
It's only an early morning dream, and the whole world will be alright

CHORUS
