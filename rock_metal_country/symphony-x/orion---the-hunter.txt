6:56Music: Romeo, Miller/Lyrics: Miller, Allen
Child of the oceans I am, walking on the waves
Stirring the pools, I silence and calm the tides to a glaze
Touched by a vision of love, her beauty recognized
Elusive to me, progressions are now violence in disguise

On a quest for light, and braving the seas
Chasing the morning star, wait for me...
Now I'm blinded, this vision I cannot see
I cannot see my future destiny

Ohh...the hunter looks at you with eyes to kill
Praying for your life-the mighty rage against the still

For whom the God's destroy, they first make mad
Receiving the sun, and falling like hourglass sand
Child of the sea I am, in starlight I reside
Glow silver and white, eternal and bright in the sky

On a quest for light, and braving the seas
Chasing the morning star, wait for me...
Now I'm blinded, this vision I cannot see
I cannot see my future destiny

Ohh...the hunter looks at you with eyes to kill
Praying for your life-the mighty rage against the still

Ohh...the hunter looks at you with eyes to kill
Praying for your life-the mighty rage against the still

Ohh...the hunter
Ohh...the hunter
Ohh...the hunter
I'm the hunter
