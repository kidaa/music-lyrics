12:07Music: Romeo, Pinnela, Miller, Rullo and Tyler
A chill grows near you're faced with fear
a darkened day you'll see it clear

your shadows call while you stand tall
watch before me while you fall

Times are changing, rearranging
where's the answer we've all been looking for
transient dreaming do you believe in
I am the answer to it all

where are you heading to time will tell
to a destiny that fate knows well
so fly away

Victim of the silence - wipe the cob - webs from your eyes
beware the season - the lies, the treason, the pain

You're running in reverse now - while struggling to break
free
the path you strayed from can only lead to dismay

Living a timeless tale
Behold the truth unveiled
Passion and glory fill my heart
Knowing my fate

Nightmare of fantasy
Untrue reality
Learning the lesson
as we fight to stay alive

Awakened by the thunder - crashing conscience
through your mind
persistent voices - all evils call out your name

Tears can break the silence - let your doubts
and fears be heard
You're releasing inned peace from your soul

Marching on staff in hand
falling into darkness
carry on through the endless nights calling

Living a timeless tale
Behold the truth unveiled
Passion and glory fill my heart
Knowing my fate

Nightmare of fantasy
Untrue reality
Learning the lesson
as we fight to stay alive

Crying downs your doubts and fears
they say that time just might heal the wounds of love

it replaces shattered traces of dispair
looking out through all the years
they say that time just might heal the wounds of love
it replaces

Love will light the darkness there
bringing some hope into view
it replaces the nameless faces of loneliness that you once
knew

Instrumental

Marching on staff in hand
falling into darkness
carry on through the endless nights calling

Living a timeless tale
Behold the truth unveiled
Passion and glory fill my heart
Knowing my fate

Nightmare of fantasy
Untrue reality
Learning the lesson
as we fight to stay alive
