4:18Music: Romeo, Pinnela, Miller, Rullo and Allen
Dark desires of the cynic queen
laugher echoes her name
He feels his breath decay

Opens the past to an empty page
Watch his life drain away

Arrival - dressed to kill, scarlet memories
Watching and waiting for curtains to fall
Arrival - dressed to kill, it's a tragedy
Could you feel sympathy or pain?

In a desolate room, the canvas bleeds
He slides through his chair
rendered prince of foolsDire thoughts of her begotten son,
Watch his life drain away
Watch his life fade away

Arrival - dressed to kill, scarlet memories
Watching and waiting for curtains to fall
Arrival - dressed to kill, it's a tragedy
Could you feel sympathy or pain?

Solo

Arrival - dressed to kill, scarlet memories
Watching and waiting for curtains to fall
Arrival - dressed to kill, it's a tragedy
Could you feel sympathy or pain?
