Still in bed an hour past,
I'm drifting through the night.
As fallen star divides the sky of divinity.

Taken on a journey,
and enlightened to the past.
And if I wake, if I wake, will it embrace me?

Awoke at dawn to calm the stor inside of me.
Take my last breath as I fall into eternity...

Risen to an astral flight, I wander through
the serene with you.
Answers to the voices I hear,
In a Winter's Dream, a dream.

Empty minds still wait, I'm here.
Captured by light - my spirit rides through the
night.
And if I dream to wake - will it embrace me?

When the story fades and all is said done,
I can not wait - pray for daybreak -
Will it escape me?Awoke at dawn to calm the storm inside of me.
Take my last breath as I fall into eternity...

Risen to an astral flight, I wander through
the serene with you.
Answers to the voices I hear,
In a Winter's Dream, a dream.

In a Winter's Dream - I'll be there for you
In a Winter's Dream - I'll be there for you

Risen to an astral flight, I wander through
the serene with.
