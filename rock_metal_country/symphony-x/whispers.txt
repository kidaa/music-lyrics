4:48Music: Romeo, Pinnela, Miller, Rullo and Allen
When all the angels cry
sadness reigns upon us all
white doves fade to black

With the absence of the heart
we could never smile
we can feel the bitter tears

Whispers from you - calling out from above
visions I can't see, like the wind and your love
whispers to you - calling out through the night
words I can't hear, graceful figure in white

And when you watch over me
please guide me all the way
you're my judge and my juryAs I lay my head to rest
your absence will surround me
and I'll die another death

Whispers from you - calling out from above
visions I can't see, like the wind and your love
Whispers to you - calling out through the night
words I can't hear, graceful figure in white

Solo

Whispers from you - calling out from above
visions I can't see, like the wind and your love
Whispers to you - calling out through the night
words I can't hear, graceful figure in white
