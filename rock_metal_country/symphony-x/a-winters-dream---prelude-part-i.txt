Although your words are empty,
I can hear now, what you feel inside

The night is drawing closer,
you fell you have to hide.

Your fears are never wrong or right
Everything is either black or white.It's time to close your eyes now,
begin your fantasy - what does it mean?
Wake your dreams commence now...
into reality.

Your fears are never wrong or right
Everything is either black or white.

In a Winter's Dream - I'll be there for you
In a Winter's Dream - I'll be there for you
