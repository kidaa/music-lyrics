5:42Music: Romeo, Pinnela, Miller, Rullo and Allen
Deep within a tiny box, shadowed truth under the locks
Burns inside your heart - then it starts

Your soul stretched on the rack
the straw that breaks the back
Watch the make-up crack...

Got no peace of mind, now you're going blind
Secrets within, living in sin.
No one needs to know, watch the cancer grow
Feel it eating - Secrets within.

Secrets hurt if they are told, someone's trust you will
have sold - Don't tell a soul.
Hear the cry inside of you, live the lie or speak the
truth - when will it end?Your soul stretched on the rack
the straw that breaks the back
Watch the make - up crack...

Got no peace of mind, now you're going blind
Secrets within, living in sin.
No one better know, feel the cancer grow
Feel it eating - Secrets within your mind.

Solo

Got no peace of mind, now you're going blind
Secrets within, living in sin.
No one needs to know, watch the cancer grow
Feel it eating - Secrets within your mind.
