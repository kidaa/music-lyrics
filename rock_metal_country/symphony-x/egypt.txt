Endless sands of Alnantees - etched in gold, a city lost in time and from the Sea - A Child speaks of things unseen, before the King - a teller of the Rhyme

Five align - hidden in the word a message locked in time find the Key - it draws the final line between what is and what should never be

Gaze in these eyes my child and see - here by my side, you're destined to be Fears in the night flee with the Sun - if we are One Kingdom of Gold I lay at your feet - Ruler of Time and Space you will be Rivers of Truth forever will run - if we are One

From the ruins of Atlantis, the Lord of Night rises from the sands He seeks the one - his serpent's tail and twisted tongue - a bringer of War - Destroyer of the land

Five align - hidden in the word a message locked in time find the Key - it draws the final line between what is and what should never be

"Rise my minions - from within the deep abyss my disciples - thunder this necropolis"

Gaze in these eyes my child and see - here by my side, you're destined to be Fears in the night chasin the Sun - now we are One Kingdom of Gold now lay at my feet - Ruler of Time and Space I will be Rivers of Lies forever will run - now we are One
