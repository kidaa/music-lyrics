4:18Music: Romeo, Pinnella, Miller/Lyrics: Allen
Today I've seen the shallow face I wear
Inside this shell,
a living hell endures
I'm held captive by my fear,
decaying hope and wasted years
The knife of time carves another
line around these eyes

Good and evil - lust primeval
Dragging me into a sea of lies

Losing faith in who I am
Never changing just rearranging
my life again
Through into an eternal abyss I fall,
Silent screams through paper walls
I pray someday the sun will shine
on me again shine on me again

Good and evil - lust primeval
Dragging me into a sea of liesLies ... lies ...

Solo

Lies ... lies ...
