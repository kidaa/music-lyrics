4:58
Now at my feet, the dying voice of Balance - nevermore shall there be a way to fly, a way to fly on wings of Divinity, as words of wisdom fade away

The Law of One will fade and die The rising Moon will crush the Sky

So falls the Night - the darkest hour Seek and find all the secrets left for you Absence of Light - unbalanced power Only then will you know

The hidden words - a piece of the puzzle - Time will tell what will be Between the lines, the past and future you will find - the ones and zeros are the key to unlock what's sealed

The Law of One will fade and die The rising Moon will crush the Sky

So falls the Night - the darkest hour Justice lost - a travesty we must undo Absence of Light - unbalanced power Only then will you know

"Awaken all from Set - Amentet - Worship all that I represent"

So falls the Night - the darkest hour Destruction, death and war are in the air Absence of Light - unbalanced power ruling all that we know

So falls the Night - the darkest hour Unbound - what once was lost - now is found Absence of Light - unbalanced power Only then will we know
