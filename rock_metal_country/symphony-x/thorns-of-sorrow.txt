3:55Music: Romeo, Pinnela, Miller, Rullo and Tyler
Beckoning me through aeons of time - captured by you
in dismay
I try to elude these prisions of flesh - but return to
shattered domains

There's no image in the mirror
Shattered glass impales my soul

She's like thorns of sorrow - ripping through my head
She's like thorns of sorrow - visions turning red

Enchanting me - defying my love - I'm hindered with
penance and pain

False reflection of grandeur and light - leaves my heart
bleeding and stained

There's no image in the mirror
Shattered glass impales my soul

She's like thorns of sorrow - ripping through my head
She's like thorns of sorrow - visions turning red

Solo

She's like thorns of sorrow - ripping through my head
She's like thorns of sorrow - visions turning red

She's like thorns of sorrow - ripping through my head
She's like thorns of sorrow - visions turning red
