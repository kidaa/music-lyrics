All we know, now has come undone Balance lost between the Moon and Sun Hear out prayers - Keepers of the Skies Divine Upon us all - let your wisdom shine

Losing faith as the madness prevails in us all we are searching for a reason, a need to calm the storm In our sails - let your winds be strong

Breathe the air around you The oceans fill your veins and winds embrace your heart Feel the change within you The Sun and Moon align - The Grand Design awaits a new start

From the skies, looking down on you Through the clouds tainted crystal blue "Such advancement, yet lacking the control, so unaware of your earthly roles"

Praise this child and the words of her rhyme A sacred gift - Magic of the Five will bring you tranquillity A new order of equality

Five senses come alive - Five reasons thrive - Five nations unite - Unite as one Night and Day will find a way to keep the Balance true Let the Sky and Stars be your guide - the destination is up to you

Raise our heads up to the Skies Feel the essence of Time Changing ways like the shifting tides In the waves hear the Rhyme
