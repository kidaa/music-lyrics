5:28Music: Symphony X/Lyrics: Allen
Ancient lands, lost in time
Storms of sand, walls of lime
Surround this mask of death I wear

Awakened by intruder souls
The jackal screams as my stone gods behold
Desecraters of Ra

Chorus
Pharaoh's curse upon you
Who dares to invade his sacred ground
Gods of the Nile arise to strike you down

Forgotten days of my rule, cities
blazed with gold and jewel
Diamond symbol of riches
beyond compare

Now I lay cold in this chamber of
stone
Fools forsaken the wrath of my
throne
Desecraters of RaChorus

Mystic gods of the stars
- I summon thee from afar
Sun, moon and earth
- align for my rebirth

I feel the blood flow through my veins
The life force shines on me again
Let the ritual begin
- you will pay for your sins

I am god, I am king of the land
The hour of judgement is at hand
Winds of revenges sweep through the sand
The mighty pharaoh lives again

Solo
