7:17Music: Romeo, Pinnela, Miller, Rullo and Tyler
In your time of dying don't call my name
so you see me as evil it's just the same

Through the windows in my mind
now you're cast in flames

Absinthe and Rue
twisted wings of paranoia
twilight runs through eyes of ignorance

Afflicted, addicted, and wicked
you'll loom in fear
severed, endeavored in trial
time closes near

Obsessing, possessing, confessing consumed by sin
injected, infected by venom that's searing your skin

Through the windows in my mind
now you're cast in flamesAbsinthe and Rue
twisted wings of paranoia
twilight runs through eyes of ignorance

Absinthe and Rue
twisted wings of paranoia
twilight runs through eyes of ignorance

Solo

Absinthe and Rue
twisted wings of paranoia
twilight runs through eyes of ignorance

Absinthe and Rue
twisted wings of paranoia
twilight runs through eyes of ignorance
