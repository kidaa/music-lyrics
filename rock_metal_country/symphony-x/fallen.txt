Alone I walk, among the twisting shadows tempted by the ancient magic, the Power of Five My desire to mirror my own image - and I will offer you no soul - offer you no soul

Tonight Darkness will shadow the Light - Symmetry divine, there's no force greater Dividing the Fathers of Time

Feel my hate, I'm banished to this wasteland my Serpents plot the overthrow of your temples and shrines In the night, my army's rage and fury burning my shadow into the land - Vengeance by my hand

Tonight Darkness will shadow the Light - Symmetry divine, there's no force greater Dividing the Fathers of Time Tonight Darkness will shadow the Light - Paradise denied - the balance of ages forever lost in time

Was I sure of my fateful wish to evoke the night from the day? Thousands now join as one - be afraid What have I done? Clouds are dimming the Sun with his wrath of disease and decay This masque of vengeance leads my death parade What have I done? "My shadow burning - my shadow burns across the land...".

Tonight Darkness will shadow the Light - Symmetry divine, there's no force greater Dividing the Fathers of Time Tonight Darkness will shadow the Light - Paradise denied - the balance of ages forever lost in time
