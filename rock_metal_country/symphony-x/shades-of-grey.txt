5:41Music: Romeo, Pinnela, Miller, Rullo and Tyler
Seasons changing now - winter's come
Seasons changing now - summer's come
and I'll be on my own
just bear another day

I have wondered - if I can turn back hands of time
I have wondered - if I can turn back into time
I'll try, just try another way

I don't know why my heart keeps calling,
but I really don't want you to stay
I have my reasons to keep from falling
then cast me into shades of gray

Life's an endless stage - wisdom comes with age,
can't you see what mindless games we play

So the end
So the end is near - captured by the spirit in the wind
you keep calling out to me

I'll find my way
I'll wee it throughI don't know why my heart keeps calling,
but I really don't want you to stay
I have my reasons to keep from falling
then cast me into shades of gray

Solo

When the curtain falls - I'll hold my head up high
and curse you all
such vicious games we play

I don't know why my heart keeps calling,
but I really don't want you to stay
I have my reasons to keep from falling
then cast me into shades of gray

I don't know why my heart keeps calling,
but I really don't want you to stay
I have my reasons to keep from falling
then cast me into shades of gray
