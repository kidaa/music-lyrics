What's become of the world - the colors unfurl revealing a blackened haze Conditioned to fear the voice that we hear - calling an end of days Millions of souls under control like pawns to a king, led by a string, to the final hour

Oh - Empire of the Sea, Lords of technology that fell into the void Oh shall it be as it was before - a tragedy on every shore?

Is this the end of all we know - Innocence lost so long ago Woven in dreams - the darkest of schemes now takes hold of our destiny Decades of greed, plague, famine and war - we can't go on like this anymore living like fools - chaos will rule this eternal paradise

Death by design, altering birth - trends of the modern age the wisdom of life erased from the Earth - in a reckless rampage

Oh - Empire of the Sea, Lords of technology that fell into the void Oh shall it be as it was before - a tragedy on every shore?

Is this the end of all we know - Innocence lost so long ago Woven in dreams - the darkest of schemes now takes hold of our destiny Decades of greed, plague, famine and war - we can't go on like this anymore living like fools - chaos will rule this eternal paradise

Dies Irae, Dies Illa, Solvet Saeclum in favilla

Decades of greed, plague, famine and war - we can't go on like this anymore living like fools - chaos will rule this eternal paradise

Is this the end of all we know - Innocence lost so long ago Woven in dreams - the darkest of schemes now takes hold of our destiny Decades of greed, plague, famine and war - we can't go on like this anymore Lost in the Night - fading from sight - is this the final setting sun?
