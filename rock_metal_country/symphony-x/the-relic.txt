Silver cross in ancient halls, deep inside the castle walls
Bound to sleep, forever locked in chains
Evil carved into the stone, ancient words they've never known
A serpent's silent shroud still remains

Come with me and I'll make all your wishes come true
Lifting the chains of oppression from you 
Wiping away the lines carved in your face
Take the Relic from this place...

Carry on, into the horizon, wielding courage, staff in hand
Journey on, through shadows and dreams, and what lies beyond the guardian's keep

Prey and siege in voiceless woe, who's dust was scattered long ago
Awaken from this dark and endless sleep
Man's desires-now mortal wounds, believing tales and shallow truths
Hardened hearts now tremble in the keep

Trust in me and I'll lay all your nightmares to waste
Take the Relic from this place

Carry on, into the horizon, wielding courage, staff in hand
Journey on, through shadows and dreams, and what lies beyond the guardian's keep
