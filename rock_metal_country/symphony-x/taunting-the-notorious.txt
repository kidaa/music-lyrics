3:21Music: Romeo, Pinnela, Miller, Rullo and Tyler
Don't give me reasons
why you spread your disease like aplague

Caught up in treason
a faith that's misleading and vague

It's so sad our world is breaking down
feeling desires, desires are set in my mind

Your corrupted ways
my sarcastic daze
Parasites infecting us
savage and notorious

Lost in the kingdom
kingdom of pain and my spite
whirlwind of power
power controllng my mindIt's so sad our world is breaking down
feeling desires, desires are set in my mind

Your corrupted ways
my sarcastic daze
Parasites infecting us
savage and notorious

Solo

Your corrupted ways
my sarcastic daze
Parasites infecting us
savage and notorious

Your corrupted ways
my sarcastic daze
Parasites infecting us
savage and notorious
