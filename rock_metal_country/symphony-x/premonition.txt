5:38Music: Romeo, Pinnela, Miller, Rullo and Tyler
Unlock the doors of silence
scanning eyes turn into stone
pours the wine of hate and enmity

Helpless minds dance in circles
forever frozen within time
then stare into unlit serenity

Endless dreams are all encased in disarray

Through the eyes of time - I see
all the love and tragedy
the breath of fate surrounds me
and bring me to my kness

Through the eyes of time - I see
peace and false tranquility
although my scars - they do
run deep - right here I'll be

Blind visions summond me
return under blackened skies
scorned and scathed by the spirit's song

A shadow forbears warning
reveals a rhyme, then descends
and falls into the black endless sea

Endless dreams are all encased in disarrayThrough the eyes of time - I see
all the love and tragedy
the breath of fate surrounds me
and bring me to my kness

Through the eyes of time - I see
peace and false tranquility
although my scars - they do
run deep - right here I'll be

Our inner strenghts will fill our needs
and heal the hearts that still bleed

Solo

Through the eyes of time - I see
all the love and tragedy
the breath of fate surrounds me
and bring me to my kness

Through the eyes of time - I see
peace and false tranquility
although my scars - they do
run deep - right here I'll be

Our inner strenghts will fill our needs
and heal the hearts that still bleed
