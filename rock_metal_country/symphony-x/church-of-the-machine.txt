8:57Music and Lyrics: Symphony X
Bow down in the platinum maze
Twilight cathedrals spread the system plague
Forging sacred thrones in the void unseen
Merciless judgement in the church of the machine

I'm the master, looking down from the edge of space and time
Flesh and steel intertwined
I am the future, sacrifice your soul and succumb to me
Nailed to your faith, you'll believe

Scream-and no one hears my pleas
Faceless masses falling to their knees

Bow down in the platinum maze
Twilight cathedrals spread the system plague
Forging sacred thrones in the void unseen
Merciless judgement in the church of the machine

Pyramids in the sky, playing out their cosmic games
Rulers of us all, forever cursed we live in pain
Cursed-we live in pain...

The creator, 'Neath the darkened sun, my empires rise
Artificially devised
The destroyer, fierce intentions flow from a virtual rage
Forever lost and enslaved

Total mesh of soul and steel
Life-force force under my command
Twisted baptism of fire
Between machine and man 

Scream-and no one hears my pleas
Faceless masses falling to their knees

Bow down in the platinum maze
Twilight cathedrals spread the system plague
Forging sacred thrones in the void unseen
Merciless judgement in the church of the machine

Bow down in the platinum maze
Twilight cathedrals spread the system plague
Forging sacred thrones in the void unseen
Merciless judgement in the church of the machine
