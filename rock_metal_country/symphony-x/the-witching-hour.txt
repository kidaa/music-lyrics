4:15Music: Romeo, Pinnela/Lyrics: Allen, Romeo
T' was seven score and sixteen more
A dreadful scene to behold
Marble silhouettes, white
statuettes
Forever gaze into time
Caught in a web between life and
death

Chorus
Visions dance throughout the
night
In the pale moon light
In the witching hourHaunting minuet, immortal duet
Dance to the waltz of the souls
Stillness falls upon the aging hall
The fading chimes echo midnight
Caught ina web between life and
death, life and death

Chorus
