5:22Music: Romeo, Pinnela, Miller, Rullo and Allen
Lightning flashes across the sky
the hands of time keep falling like the pouring rain
Soft voice call my name; I've seen this place before
This whole thing is mad and still I can see
that he awaits for me

As the knife cuts to the vein
am I going insane? Have I lost my mind?
Ten years gone by, my friend, haunting me
scars will fade but never die

Prisioner waiting out my time
looking back through years gone by
My mind is always wondering what can I do
to seal a different fate,
can I undo the things I've done?
I lie on the ground without making a sound
and cry for my life
again

As the knife cuts to the vein
am I going insane? Have I lost my mind?
Ten years gone by, my friend, haunting me
scars will fade but never dieStaring down at me
through my eyes I can see
al the terror and pain still live on
I can't leave
silver strand is pulling me back to mortality

Solo

As the knife cuts to the vein
am I going insane? Have I lost my mind?
Ten years gone by, my friend, haunting me
scars will fade but never die
