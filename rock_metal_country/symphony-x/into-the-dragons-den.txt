4:00Music: Romeo, Miller, Pinnella/Lyrics: Symphony X
Placid skies, through crystal gazing eyes
Slaves to our desire, in a ring of smoke and fire
The dungeons call, two faces on the wall
Candles light the way, for a moonlight serenade

Through the nights and days, we will find a way
A way to carry on what we believe

An empty door, ashes on the floor 
Hypnotic array of lights, dragons calling throughout the night
Omen in black, chained down to the rack
The end never in sight, soaring through an endless plight

Through the nights and days, we will find a way

Silence fills the shrine, giving us the sign
Forever lost, forever in the dragon's den
Born with second sight, essence burning bright
Forever lost, forever in the dragon's den

Silence fills the shrine, giving us the sign
Forever lost, forever in the dragon's den
Born with second sight, essence burning bright
Forever lost, forever in the dragon's den
