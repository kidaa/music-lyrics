3:31Music: Romeo, Pinnela, Miller, Rullo and Allen
Besiege me not for what I am
a man with intent in the Devil's den
for I know not what to believe
yet mad I am not in trust I deceive
Radical alterations in my temper
grows worse day by day
I will offer you extreme opposition

Savage curtain closes in on you
but I do grieve the evident
behind this illusion

The fury of demons possessing me
my fiendish corruption will fill my need
every reason to fulfill my deed.
Have we not a perpetual inclination
to violate that witch is law merely
because we know it is to be?Savage curtain closes in on you
but I do grieve the evident
behind this illusion

Solo

Savage curtain closes in on you
but I do grieve the evident
behind this illusion
