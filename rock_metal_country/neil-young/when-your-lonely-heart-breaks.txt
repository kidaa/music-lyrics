When your lonely heart breaks
Don't sit counting your mistakes
Don't be waiting
for love to come back
Don't be wastin' time
Don't be lost in crime
When your lonely heart breaks
When your lonely heart breaks.

What's your problem, she's gone
You're still movin', movin' on
You got memories, she got strong
There's a lot of things
That aren't gone
When your lonely,
lonely heart breaks
When your lonely heart breaks.

When your lonely heart breaks
Don't be cryin'
for good times you had
When your lonely heart breaks.

When your lonely heart breaks
Don't sit counting your mistakes
Don't be waiting
for love to come back
Don't be wastin' time
Don't be lost in crime
When your lonely,
lonely heart breaks
When your lonely,
lonely heart breaks
When your lonely heart breaks.
