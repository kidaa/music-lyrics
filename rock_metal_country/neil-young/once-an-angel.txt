Once an angel
Always an angel
You're as close to heaven
As I'll ever be

It's been six years now
Since my ring
slipped on your finger
And those years have made
A better man out of me.

Once an angel
Always an angel
You're as close to heaven
As I'll ever be.

There've been times when
I've treated you so badly
I've done things I know
You'll never understand.

But you take me back
Turn your eyes
towards the window
Where you hide the tears
You don't want me to see.

Once an angel
Always an angel
You're as close to heaven
As I'll ever be.

Once an angel
Always an angel
You're as close to heaven
As I'll ever be.

You're as close to heaven
As I'll ever be.
