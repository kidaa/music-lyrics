Peace and love
Flying so high
Peace and love
Too young to die
Peace and love
Now you decide
Stay for the children
You don't really want to go
Can't feel it
pulling like you did
Peace and love

Peace and love
Only a ride
Strength is gone
Dying inside
Tell me now
What did you find
Found love in the people
Livin' in a sacred land
Found love in the people
Peace and love

Found love found hate
Saw my mistake
Broke walls of pain
to walk again
I saw the dream
I saw the wake
We shared it all
But not the take

Peace and love
Lennon's goodbye
Over Now
Living in time
A broken bell
A nursery rhyme
Deserted by heroes
Strangers in your own land
No way to deny you
No way to deny you
Peace and love

I took it all
I took the oath
I took it all
Til I had most
I took what's left
I gave it breath
I had it all once
I gave it back
