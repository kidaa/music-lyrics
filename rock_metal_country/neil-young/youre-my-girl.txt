Well I took you for a walk
up on the forest floor,
'Cause I wanted to share some things.
But it sure looked to me
like you've been there before,
It was such a natural thing. 

You're my girl,
My girl
And you're showing me now,
Just how grown up you are.
You're my girl,
My girl
And I'll be lettin' you go someday.

Please don't tell me that
you're leavin' me just yet,
Cause I know I gotta let you go.
Let you go
Please don't tell me that
you're sayin' goodbye.
Say good bye

Well I lit a candle
on the Fourth of July,
But it didn't bring you home to me.
You went headin' into summer
on a natural high,
With the world at your feet.

It's your time,
Your time
And you're showin' me now,
Just how grown up you are.
It's your time,
Your time
And I'll be lettin' you go someday.

Please don't tell me that
you're leavin' me just yet,
Cause I know I gotta let you go.
Let you go
Please don't tell me that
you're sayin' goodbye.
Say goodbye

We went lookin' for faith
on the forest floor,
And it showed up everywhere,
In the sun and the water
and the falling leaves,
The falling leaves of time.

You're my girl,
My girl
And you're showing me now,
Just how grown up you are.
You're my girl,
My girl
And I'll be lettin' you go someday.

Please don't tell me that
you're leavin' me quite yet,
Cause I know I gotta let you go.
Please don't tell me that
you're sayin' goodbye.
