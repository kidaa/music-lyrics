Come along and say you will,
Be the one to change the meaning
Of the writing on the wall
The lonely politician
is lying in the hall.

Come along and say you can,
Be the one to take this feeling,
I'll never understand,
Why walk around the center
With a nail through your hand

It's another way to run,
It's a lonely weekend
And what have you done
You know you got
a reason to run, babe
You know you got
a reason to hide, babe

Come along and say you will,
Be the one to change the meaning
Of the writing on the wall
The lonely politician
is lying in the hall.

It's another way to run,
It's a lonely weekend
And what have you done
You know you got
a reason to run, babe
You know you got
a reason to hide, babe.

Come along and say you can,
Be the one to take this feeling,
I'll never understand,
Why walk around the center
With a nail through your hand
