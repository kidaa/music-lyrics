Trying to remember what my daddy said
Before too much time took away his head
He said we're going back and I'll show you what I'm talking about
Going back to Cypress River, back to the old farmhouse

Prairie wind blowing through my head
Prairie wind blowing through my head
Trying to remember what Daddy said
Prairie wind blowing through my head

I tried to tell the people but they never heard a word I say
They say there's nothing out there but wheat fields anyway
Just a farmer's wife hanging laundry in her back yard
Out on the prairie where the winds blow long and hard

Prairie wind blowing through my head
Prairie wind blowing through my head
Trying to remember what Daddy said
Prairie wind blowing through my head

Late at night, lights dancing in the northern sky
Like the Indian spirits trying to show me how to fly
You can see into the future but it may be a mirage
Like a new car sitting there in your old garage

Prairie wind blowing through my head
Prairie wind blowing through my head
Prairie wind blowing through my head
Trying to remember what Daddy said

There's a place on the prairie where evil and goodness play
Daddy told me all about it but I don't remember what he said
It might be afternoon and it might be the dead of night
But you'll know when you see it 'cause it sure is a hell of a sight

Prairie wind blowing through my head
Prairie wind blowing through my head
Prairie wind blowing through my head
Prairie wind blowing through my head

Prairie wind blowing through my head
Prairie wind blowing through my head

Prairie wind blowing through my head
Prairie wind blowing through my head
Trying to remember what Daddy said
Prairie wind blowing through my head
Before too much time took away his head
Prairie wind blowing through my head
He said we're going back and I'll show you what I'm talking about
Prairie wind blowing through my head

Prairie wind blowing through my head
Going back to Cypress River, back to the old farmhouse
Prairie wind blowing through my head
Prairie wind blowing through my head
Prairie wind blowing through my head

Prairie wind blowing through my head
Trying to remember what Daddy said
Prairie wind blowing through my head...
