So your girlfriend
slammed the door shut
In your face tonight,
but that's all right
Then she took off
to the opera
With some highbrow
from the city lights
Well, you grew up on a corner
You never missed a moonlit night.

Some things never change,
they stay the way they are.
You were born to rock,
you'll never be an opera star
Some things never change,
they stay the way they are.

So you stay out all night
Gettin' fucked up
in that rock and roll bar
And you never get tired
'Cause your drugs
are in a little jar.

You were born to rock,
you'll never be an opera star.
Some things never change,
they stay the way they are.

I was born to rock!
