I see the light
of a thousand lamps
burning in your eyes
Still I have to turn away
for you to stay alive

'Cause I was born to run
I was born to run
I was born to run
I was born to run  run  run

Security had a hold on me
I had a thousand friends
But reality wasn't told to me
And I found out in the end

'Cause I was born to run
I was born to run
I was born to run
I was born to run  run  run
