Live to ride,
ride my dream machine
Good conditions
sometime are extreme
Running from the daily grind
He was, he was a friend of mine
Gonna take a long, long time
But the stain will fade away
Running from the daily grind
He was, he was a friend of mine.

Live to ride,
ride in the lonesome wind
Cross the line,
you can't come back again
Never let a dream machine
Gather dust in your garage
Gonna take a long, long time
But the stain will fade away
Running from the daily grind
He was, he was a friend of mine.

Gonna take a long, long time
But the stain will fade away
Running from the daily grind
He was, he was a friend of mine.

Live to ride,
ride my dream machine.
