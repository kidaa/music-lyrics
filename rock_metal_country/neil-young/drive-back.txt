Whatever gets you
through the night
That's all right with me
When it's time to say goodbye
I have to make you see

You won't know me
I won't call you
I won't be there
To remind you
What you told me
When I showed you
In the morning
Let me know you'll

Drive back to your old town
I wanna wake up
with no-one around
Drive back to your old town.

If somebody
Is haunting your mind
Look in my eyes
Let me hide you
From yourself and
All your old friends
Every good thing
Comes to an end.

Drive back,
drive back,
drive back.

Drive back to your old town
I wanna wake up with no-one around
Drive back to your old town.
