I won't apologize
The light shone from in your eyes
It isn't gone,
It will soon come back again.

Though we go our separate ways
Lookin' for better days
Sharin' our little boy,
Who grew from joy back then.

And it's all because
of that love we knew
That makes the world go round.
Separate ways, separate ways.
Separate ways, separate ways.

Me for me, you for you
Happiness is never through
It's only a change of plan
And that is nothing new.

As we go our separate ways.
Lookin' for better days
Sharin' our little boy,
Who grew from joy back then.

And it's all because
of that love we knew
That makes the world go round.
And it's all because
of the love we knew
It makes the world go round.
Separate ways, separate ways.
Separate ways, separate ways.
