My brother went to prison
He's in Kingston doin' time
He got seven years for sellin'
What I've been smokin' all my life
Time off for good behavior
But the boy don't feel too good
Locked behind those steel bars
I don't know if he should

Yeh a few years ago they called me
Back home to get a big award
They also called my brother
But they made him say "My Lord"
They locked me up in a Hall of Fame
And threw away the keys
But when they put my brother away
It really did somethin' to me

Now I'm guilty as hell for sayin'
"Boy you better go back home"
You know you'll
get a fair shake there
We're running all alone
When he called me up
from the border
With the Mounties on his tail
I said go back to Canada
We can raise the bail

Now I get these letters
From a cell with no TV
He says he's outside one hour
And inside twenty three
Time off for good behavior
But the boy don't feel too good
Locked behind those steel bars
I don't know if he should

Now I'm guilty as hell for sayin'
"Boy you better go back home"
You know you'll
get a fair shake there
We're running all alone
When he called me up
from the border
With the Mounties on his tail
I said go back to Canada
We can raise the bail

My brother went to prison
He's in Kingston doin' time
He got seven years for sellin'
What I've been smokin' all my life
