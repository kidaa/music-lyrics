The Statue of Liberty
is breathing in the air
Atlantis is waiting down below.
Late at night, flashing lights
are sighted in the air.
It's no secret,
what everybody knows.
It really don't matter much,
which way I go.
But remember
to pull over in the storm.

Have you seen the evening coconut
Bobbing on the bay
Standing on
the water's edge of stone
Someone there besides you
To hear the words you say
To show you things
your eyes have never known.

Evening coconut, evening coconut
Evening coconut, evening coconut
Evening coconut, evening coconut
Evening coconut, evening coconut
Evening coconut, evening coconut

The Statue of Liberty
is breathing in the air
While Atlantis
is waiting down below.
Late at night, flashing lights
are sighted in the air.
It's no secret,
what everybody knows.

Evening coconut, evening coconut
Evening coconut, evening coconut
Evening coconut, evening coconut
Evening coconut, evening coconut
