All her friends call her Little Wing
But she flies rings around them all
She comes to town when the children sing
And leaves them feather as if they fall
She leaves her feathers as if they fall

Little Wing, don't fly away
When the summer turns to fall
Don't you know some people say
The winter is the best time of them all
Winter is the best of all.
