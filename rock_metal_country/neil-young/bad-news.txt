Bad news is come to town
He's walking
three feet off the ground
He's ordering another round.
Bound by his own ideas,
Lost, doesn't know
where she is found.

Bad news is fighting mad
He went and lost
the biggest prize
he ever had
But a prizefighter
can't be sad
When he smiles under
golden lights and lamps
Taking daylight fights
again and again.
