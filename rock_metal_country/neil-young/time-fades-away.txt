Fourteen junkies
too weak to work
One sells diamonds
for what they're worth
Down on pain street,
disappointment lurks
Son, don't be home too late.
Try to get back by eight
Son, don't wait
till the break of day
'Cause you know
how time fades away.
Time fades away
You know how time fades away.

All day presidents
look out windows
All night sentries
watch the moonglow
All are waiting till
the time is right
Son, don't be home too late
Try to get back by eight
Son, don't wait
till the break of day
'Cause you know
how time fades away.
Time fades away
You know how time fades away.

Back in Canada I spent my days
Riding subways through a haze
I was handcuffed,
I was born & raised
Son, don't be home too late
Try to get back by eight
Son, don't wait
till the break of day
'Cause you know
how time fades away.
Time fades away
You know how time fades away.

Thirteen junkies
too weak to work
One sells diamonds
for what they're worth
Down on pain street
disappointment lurks.
Son, don't be home too late
Try to get back by eight, eight
Son, don't wait
till the break of day
'Cause you know
how time fades away.
Time fades away
You know how time fades away.

Time fades away
You know how time fades away
