Trippin' down that old Hippie Highway
Got to thinkin' 'bout you again
Wonderin' how it really was for you
And how it happened in the end
But I guess I'll never know the truth
If you were really all alone

We were just a couple of kids then
Livin' each and every day
When we both went down to register
We were laughin' all the way
That's when we named it Hippie Highway
I still call it that today

Roger and out good buddy
I still call it that today

Two camaros racin' down the road
Feels just like yesterday

Roger and out good buddy
I feel you in the air today

I know you gave for your country
I feel you in the air today

Roger and out good buddy
