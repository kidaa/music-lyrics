When you walk in a room
You hold your head up high
You talk to people eye to eye
There's nothing to hide
You're feeling
so complete inside
Your heart feels
so complete inside
'Cause you got love.

If you got love
You know you got it
If you got love
Can't live without it
If you got love
The world you're walking in
Is at your command

You're staring
in the face of scorn
You know your spirit
can't be torn
You're living like a satellite
Maintain your distance
through the night
You know that
something isn't right
Your heart tells you
it's just not right
'Cause you got love.

If you got love
You know you got it
If you got love
Can't live without it
If you got love
The world you're walking in
Is at your command.

If you got love
The world you're walking in
Is at your command
If you got love
To share
If you got love
To share.
