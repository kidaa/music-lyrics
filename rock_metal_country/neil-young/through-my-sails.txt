Still glaring
from the city lights
Into paradise I soared
Unable to come down
For reasons I'd ignored.

Total confusion,
Disillusion
New things I'm knowin'.

I'm standing on the shoreline
It's so fine out there
Leaving with the wind blowing
But love takes care.

Know me, know me
Show me, show me
New things I'm knowin'.

Wind blowing through my sails
It feels like I'm gone
Leaving with the wind blowing
Through my sails.
