People put me down,
say that I'm a fool
But I got news for them
I ain't never going back
to driving school.

And I ain't too good
with numbers
And I've just run out of fuel
Here comes
another corner baby
Let me demonstrate
my slide rule.

Drivin' thunder,
rollin' down the highway
Just one way to go,
just one way to go.
Just one way to go,
hey hey, and that's my way.

I stopped into the courthouse
I had to pay some bills
Got talking with the judge
About the finer points
of my driving skills.

He said Son,
you only drive that way
Tryin' to get your thrills
But bear in mind
your driver's license
Ain't never been no
license to kill.

Drivin' thunder,
rollin' down the highway
Just one way to go,
just one way to go.
Just one way to go,
hey hey, and that's my way.

Driving school,
Slide rule,
Driving skills,
License to kill.

Drivin' thunder,
rollin' down the highway
Just one way to go,
just one way to go.
Just one way to go,
hey hey, and that's my way.
