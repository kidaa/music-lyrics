It's rainin' in paradise
It's rainin' in paradise
It's rainin' in paradise
Here come the clouds
There's a big wind
blowin' through town
The rooster crows
But we're
sleepin' in past dawn
It's rainin' in paradise
It's rainin' in paradise
When you chase the sun
Chase it half way
around the world
The rainbow comes
When you least expect it to.
It's rainin' in paradise
It's rainin' in paradise
It's rainin' in paradise

Sun comes up
Sun comes up.

When you chase the sun
Chase it half way
around the world
The rainbow comes
When you least expect it to
When you least expect it to
When you least expect it to
It's rainin' in paradise
It's rainin' in paradise
It's rainin' in paradise
