Old ways,
it sure is hard
to change 'em
Come what may
It's hard to teach
a dinosaur a new trick
Lately I've been finding out
I'm set in my ways
Old ways,
can be your ball
and chain.

Oh, I'm gonna stop that grass
And give up all this drinking
Really gonna make my life last
Clean up my whole way of living
Up until the party last night
I was a different man
But old ways
got their way again.

The economy was getting so bad
I had to lay myself off
Well, working was a habit I had
So I kept showin' up anyway
Then one day
things turned around
I got my back pay
Old ways
comin' through again.

I got old ways.
