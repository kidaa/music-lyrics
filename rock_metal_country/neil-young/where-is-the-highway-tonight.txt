I would be feelin' so low
She'd have a new place to go
She'd take me in her arms
And show me all her charms
Until my troubles were gone.

Then when I left her behind
Never a tear could I find
Just a haunting melody
Comin' back to me
Where is the highway tonight

Where is the highway tonight
Where are those old days
and crazy nights

Now the house is
all quiet and still
Coyote howls on the hill
How far did I go
Before we said hello
Where is the highway tonight

Darlin', you'll always be mine
I'll never treat you unkind
But a haunting melody
Keeps comin' back to me
Where is the highway tonight

Where is the highway tonight
Where are those old days
and crazy nights

A haunting melody
Keeps comin' back to me
Where is the highway tonight
