On the roller coaster ride
That my emotions have to take me on
I heard a newborn baby cry
Through the night.

I heard a perfect echo die
Into an anonymous wall
of digital sound
Somewhere deep inside
Of my soul.

A natural beauty should be preserved
like a monument to nature
Don't judge yourself too harsh,
my love
Or someday you might find
your soul endangered
A natural beauty should be preserved
like a monument to nature.

Amazon
You had so much
and now so much is gone
What are you gonna do
With your life

What a lucky man.
To see the earth
before it touched his hand
What an angry fool
To condemn.

One more night to go
One more sleep
upon your burning banks
A greedy man never knows
What he's done.

A natural beauty should be preserved
like a monument to nature
Don't start yourself too short,
my love
Or someday you might find
your soul endangered
A natural beauty should be preserved
like a monument to nature.

Went to the rodeo today
I saw the cowgirls
lined up on the fence
A brand new Chevrolet
A brand new pair of seamless pants.

We watched the moment of defeat
Played back over on the video screen
Somewhere deep inside
Of my soul.

A natural beauty should be preserved
like a monument to nature.
