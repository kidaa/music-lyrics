Winding paths
through tables and glass
First fall was new
Now watch the summer pass
So close to you.

Too late to keep the change,
Too late to pay,
No time to stay the same
Too young to leave.

No pass out sign on the door
set me thinking
Are waitresses paying the price
of their winking
While stars sit in bars and decide
what their drinking,
They drop by to die 'cause it's
faster than sinking.

Too late to keep the change,
Too late to pay,
No time to stay the same
Too late to keep the change,
Too late to pay,
No time to stay the same
Too young to leave.

Find out that now was the answer
To answers that you gave later
She did the things
that we both did before, now,
But who forgave her.

If I could stand to see her crying
I would tell her not to care.
When she learns of all your lyin'
Will she join you there

Country girl I think you're pretty,
Got to make you understand,
Have no lovers in the city,
Let me be your country man.
Got to make you understand.
