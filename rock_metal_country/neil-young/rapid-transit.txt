Rapid transit.
Public service.
I'm standing in my line.

Melt down.
Containment.
I'm standing in my line

Hang ten pipeline,
let's go trippin'
Hang ten pipeline,
let's go trippin'
Hang ten pipeline,
let's go trippin'
Every wave is new
until it breaks.

Go!

Secret service
Public enemy
I'm standing in my line

Hang ten pipeline,
let's go trippin'
Hang ten pipeline,
let's go trippin'
Hang ten pipeline,
no way rockin'
Every wave is new
until it breaks.

Go!
