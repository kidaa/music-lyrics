Try to find
The perfect time
To say something to you
Filled with meaning
Filled with truth

If I could just live my life
as easy as a song
I'd wake up someday
and the pain will all be gone
Help me now I'm sinking fast,
I gotta get along 
To the Gateway of Love
Gateway Of Love

Background noise
On a changing sky
You'll be making love to me
I still feel you
In my heart's eye

But I'm just a dusty soul
with nothing much to say
Down here in the hay,
bound to stay that way
I've got almost everything
except that little key
To the Gateway of Love
Gateway of Love

Some will say
Theres a place on high
Where angels rip their wings
And babys learn to fly
Some will say
There's a place on high

But I'd like to stay down here,
try to love someone
Here in this life
where we watch the bouncing sun
I'd just like to hold her hair
and bring her back to me
At the Gateway of Love
Gateway of Love

If I could just live my life
as easy as a song
I'd make up some game
and the pain would all be gone
Help me now I'm sinking fast,
I gotta get along
To the gateway of love
Gateway of Love
