Saw your friend
working in this hotel
Says he used to know you when
And your dreams
Lucky as they seemed
They all
turned their back on him
Truth be known

Truth be known
Way I feel tonight
Living in
this back street town
'Bout my dreams
They all seem to fade
As soon as
I put my money down
Truth be known

When the fire
that once was your friend
Burns your fingers to the bone
And your song
meets a sudden end
Echoing
through right and wrong
Truth be known
Truth be known
