In the jungle land
With the sea and the sand
Can I meet you there

We'll be drinkin' bananas
From long tall glasses
In the open air.

Ocean girl
Come 'round the world
From forgotten shores.

There'll be music playin'
What no words could say
When you first get there.

We'll be lost in a corner
That we find in each other
There' so much to share.

Ocean girl
Come 'round the world
From forgotten shores.
