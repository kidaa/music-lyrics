I told you babe once before
Don't want you hangin'
around my door
You better find another shoulder
Find another shoulder
Find another shoulder
'Cause honey,
I don't love you anymore.

I told you babe, you're no good,
Don't want you
messin' up my neighborhood.
You better find another shoulder
Find another shoulder, babe
Find another shoulder
'Cause honey,
I don't love you anymore.

Ah, here's your
ticket for the coast,
start light,
Leave here baby,
stay out of sight.
You better find another shoulder
Find another shoulder
Find another shoulder
'Cause honey,
I don't love you anymore.

Find another shoulder
Find another shoulder
You better find another shoulder
'Cause honey,
I don't love you anymore.

I told you baby, once before
Don't want you messin'
outside my door
You better find another shoulder
Find another shoulder
Find another shoulder
'Cause honey,
I don't love you anymore.
