I'm not the same man
I was a while ago
I've learned some new things,
I hope that it shows.

I'm free to give my love,
But you're not the one
I'm thinking of,
So for me
the wheels are turning
Got to keep
the homefires burning.

I'll walk these borders
In search of a line,
Between young lovers
Who live separate lives.

How long can this go on
I can hear another song,
Late at night
when I've been drinking
Substitute comes at me winking.

How long can this go on
I can hear another song,
Late at night
when I've been drinking
Substitute comes at me winking.

I'm not the same man
I was a while ago
I've learned some new things,
I hope that it shows.

I'm free to give my love,
But you're not the one
I'm thinking of.
