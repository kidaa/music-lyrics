Maybe that's a good way to start.

The last time I saw Elvis 
He was shooting at a colour TV 
The phones were ringing in the pink motel 
And the rest is history 
He was the King 

The last time I saw Elvis 
He was singing a gospel song 
You could tell he had the feeling 
And the whole world sang along 
He was the King 

The last time I saw Elvis 
He was up on the silver screen 
Pushing a plough in a black and white movie 
And everybody started to scream 
Yes, he was the King 

The last time I saw Elvis 
It was some kind of Vegas dream 
Spotlights flashed on a silver cape 
And a blue-haired lady screamed 
He was the King 

The last time I saw Elvis 
He was fronting a three-piece band 
Rocking on the back of a flatbed truck 
With an old guitar in his hand 
He was the King 

The last time I saw Elvis 

The last time I saw Elvis 
He was riding in a pink Cadillac 
Wind was blowing through his hair 
And he never did look back 
He was the King 

Thank you very much 

The last time I saw Elvis 
He was singing that gospel song 
You could tell that he had the feeling 
And the whole world sang along 
He was the King 

He was the King 
He was the King 

- Elvis has left the arena 
- But he was rocking while he was getting out. 
- Oh, man, you blew me right outta my seat when you said, 
"Thank you very much." I almost stopped playing! 
- "Thank you very much." etc.
