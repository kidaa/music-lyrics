I feel like I just woke up
from a bad dream
And it's so good to have you
sleeping by my side
Although I'm not so sure
if I even know your name
Hold on, baby, hold on
We can go gliding through the air
Far from the jeers and lies

Yeah you are the one
I'm talkin' to this morning
With your mind so fine
and your friendly body lying
In my bungalow with stucco
With glory and sunset spa
Hold on, baby, hold on
It doesn't matter if you're the one
'Cause we'll know before we're done
