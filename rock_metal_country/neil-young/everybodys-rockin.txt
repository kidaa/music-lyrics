When grandma and grandpa
get out on the floor
They rock until they drop
and then they rock some more
Yeah, everybody's rockin',
well, everybody's rockin'
Everybody's rockin',
rockin' to the dancin' beat.

From the shakey city
down to New Orleans
The Golden Gate
to the Bronx and Queens
Everybody's rockin',
yeah, everybody's rockin',
Well, everybody's rockin',
rockin' to the dancin' beat.

When Ronnie and Nancy
do the bop on the lawn
They're rockin' in the White House
all night long.
Everybody's rockin',
everybody's rockin',
Everybody's rockin',
rockin' their blues away.

Everybody's rockin',
rockin' their blues away
Everybody's rockin',
rockin' all night and day.

Everybody's rockin',
everybody's rockin'
Yeah, everybody's rockin',
everybody's rockin'
Everybody's rockin',
rockin' to the dancin' beat.
Everybody's rockin',
dancin' to the rockin' beat.
