Open up your eyes
See how life time flies
Open up and let the light back in.

Open up your heart
Let the lovin' start
Open up and let the light back in.

I was thinking of you and me
Makin' love beneath the tree
And now I wonder could it be.

Thinkin' 'bout the times we had
Some were good and some were bad
Guitar fightin' the T.V.

I was thinkin' 'bout you and me
I was thinkin' 'bout you and me
I was thinkin' of you and me
I was thinkin' 'bout you and me.

Lookin' at you just the other night
Dancin' in the evening light
True love conquers all.

Old man sittin' there
Touch of grey, but he don't care
When he hears his children call.

I was thinkin' 'bout you and me
I was thinkin' 'bout you and me
I was thinkin' 'bout you and me
I was thinkin' 'bout you and me.

Open up your eyes
See how life time flies
Open up and let the light back in.
