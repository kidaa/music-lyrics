It's midnight on the bay
And lights are shinin'
And the sailboats sway
And that cool ocean breeze.
Blowin' down through the keys
I think I'll call it a day
Oh, midnight on the bay.
Sure feels good to me.

What's this I see
There's someone comin'
Walkin' right up to me
She tells me I know your name
And if it's all the same
I'd like to spend some time.
And midnight on the bay
Sure feels good to me.

And now it's midnight on the bay
Lights are shinin'
On the sailboats that sway
In the cool ocean breeze
Blowin' down through the keys
I think I'll call it a day
Oh, midnight on the bay.
Sure feels good to me.
