When we were living together
I thought that
I knew you would stay.
Still when you left me
I tried to pretend
we could make it some way.

I don't care
if all of the mountains
Turn to dust in the air.
What did you do to my life
It isn't fair that I should
Wake up at dawn
And not find you there
What did you do to my life

It's hard enough losing
Without the confusion
of knowing I tried.
But you've made your mind up
That I'll be alone
now there's nothing to hide.

I don't care
if all of the mountains
Turn to dust in the air.
What did you do to my life
It isn't fair that I should
Wake up at dawn
And not find you there
What did you do to my life
