My old car keeps breaking down
My new car ain't from Japan
There's already too many Datsuns
In this town.

Another thing that's bugging me
Is this commercial on TV
Says that Detroit
can't make good cars any more.
Motor City.

Who's driving my car
Who's driving my car now
Who

My army jeep is still alive
Got locking hubs and four wheel drive
Ain't got no radio,
ain't got no mag wheels
Ain't got no digital clock
Ain't got no clock.

The paint job is lookin' blue
The white walls are missing too
But I guess until I get my car back
This will do.

Who's driving my car now
Who's driving my car now
Who

Who's driving my car now
