Midnight, that old clock
keeps ticking,
The kids are all asleep
and I'm walking the floor.
Darlin' I can see
that you're dreaming,
And I don't wanna wake you up
When I close the door.

This old house of ours
is built on dreams
And a businessman don't know
what that means.
There's a garden outside
she works in every day
And tomorrow morning
a man from the bank's
Gonna come and take it all away.

Lately, I've been thinking
'bout daddy,
And how he always
made things work,
when the chips were down,
And I know
I've got something inside me
There's always a light
there to guide me
To what can't be found.

This old house of ours
is built on dreams
And a businessman don't know
what that means.
There's a swing outside
the kids play on every day
And tomorrow morning
a man from the bank's
Gonna come and take it all away.

Take it all away,
take it all away,
take it all away.
Take it all away,
take it all away,
take it all away.

Remember how we first came
here together
Standing on an empty lot,
holding hands.
Later, we came back
in the moonlight
And made love
right where the kitchen is,
Then we made our plans.

This old house of ours
is built on dreams
And a businessman don't know
what that means.
There's a garden outside
she works in every day
And tomorrow morning
a man from the bank's
Gonna come and take it all away.

Take it all away,
take it all away,
take it all away.
Take it all away,
take it all away,
take it all away.
