Wake up! It's a Monday morning
No time left to say goodbye
Can't breathe
and the lights are changing.
You can live your own life
Making it happen
Working on your own time
Laid back and laughin'
Oh no, oh no.

Headlights,
make it home by sundown
Feeling that the day is through
Return back
to where you come from
You can live your own life
Making it happen
Working on your own time
Laid back and laughin'
Oh no, oh no.

You wake up in the mornin'
And the sun's comin' up.
Its been up for hours
and hours and hours
And hours and hours and hours
It's been up for hours
and hours and hours
And you light up the stove
And the coffee cup, its hot.
And the orange juice
is cold, cold, cold
Monday morning,
Wake up, wake up,
wake up, wake up
Its time to go,
Time to go to work.

You can live your own life
Making it happen
Working on your own time
Laid back and laughin'
Oh no, oh no.
No, no, no.
