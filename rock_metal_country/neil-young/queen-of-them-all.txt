Who's the hand in your hand
Who's the one who knows
When you're on the ropes
She's the one you can lean on
And I really don't know
why I feel so good
But it's happening to me
so I knock on wood...

Who can call you darling
Who can make you stand
Who's got all the answers
When things get out of hand
Who's got all the moves
She's the queen of them all
When I really don't know
why I feel so good
But it's happening to me
so I knock on wood...

She's the queen of them all
She's the queen of them all
Walkin' proud with her colors showing
She's the queen of them all

When the sun is setting
Who will hold your hand
Who is always there for you
Who can understand
She's got all the moves
She's the queen of them all
Well I really don't know
why I feel so good
But it's happening to me
so I knock on wood...
