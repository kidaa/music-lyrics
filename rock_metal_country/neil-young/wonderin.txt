I've been walking all night long
My footsteps made me crazy
Baby, you've been gone so long
I'm wonderin' if you'll come home
I'm hopin' that you'll be my baby
I'm wonderin' if I'll be alone
Knowin' that I need you to save me.

I've been talking all day long
To keep my heart from sadness
Baby, you've been gone so long
I'm wonderin' if you'll come home
I'm hopin' that you'll be my baby
I'm wonderin' if I'll be alone
Knowin' that I need you to save me.

I'm wonderin', I'm wonderin',
I'm wonderin', I'm wonderin',
I'm wonderin', I'm wonderin',
I'm wonderin', I'm wonderin'.

Well, I'm knowin'
that I need you to save me
Knowin' that I need you to save me.
Knowin' that I need you to save me.
Knowin' that I need you to save me.
I'm wonderin', I'm wonderin'.
