I've been looking for a lover
But I haven't met her yet
She'll be nothing like
I pictured her to be
In her eyes I will discover
Another reason why
I want to live
and make the best
of what I see.

Where the sun hits the water
And the mountains meet the sand
There's a beach
that I walk along sometimes
And maybe there I'll meet her
And we'll start to say 'hello'
And never stop to think
of any other time.

Looking' for a love
that's right for me
I don't know how long
it's going to be
But I hope I treat her kind
And don't mess with her mind
When she starts to see
the darker side of me.
