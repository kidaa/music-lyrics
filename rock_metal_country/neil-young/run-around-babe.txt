Run around babe,
I'm only losing my mind
Run around babe,
Don't try to be
Something you weren't meant to be
If you are not loving me
I'll know it's because
You want to be free
Oh, oh, run around babe,
Oh, oh, run around babe.

When we were young
We left our worries behind
When we were young
Left not to be
The worry is back on me
And it's not hard to see
That that's the way it has to be
Oh, oh, run around babe,
Oh, oh, run around babe.

Run around babe,
I'm only losing my mind
Run around babe,
Don't try to be
Something you weren't meant to be
If you are not loving me
I'll know it's because
You want to be free
Oh, oh, run around babe,
Oh, oh, run around babe.
