I'm a little bit high
I'm a little bit low
Hear you name wherever I go
I'm a little bit wrong
I'm a little bit right
Hear your name
all day and night

When the music calls
I'll be there
No more sadness
No more cares
Let's think about living
Let's think about life
Like a comet
painted on the sky
Like an old soul
Over darkness you'll fly

I'm a little bit here
I'm a little bit there
I'm a little scattered
everywhere
I'm a little bit up
I'm a little bit down
I hear your name
all over this town

[chorus]
