Every morning got sun to shine
Every day got plenty of time
Every night
there's a moon so fine
There for you, my Amber Jean.

Still some lines
that should get crossed
Still some coins
that might be tossed
Still some love
that hasn't been lost
There for you, my Amber Jean.

Amber Jean, oh, Amber Jean,
Prettiest eyes I've ever seen.

Every morning got sun to shine
Every day got plenty of time
Every night
there's a moon so fine
There for you, my Amber Jean.
