Here comes the night
Here comes the anger
Hidden so deep inside
No one can see
Behind these eyes
There walks a stranger
Wandering through the dark
Following me.

Control the violent side
Control the violent side
Control the violent side
Control the violent side.

Electric light
Shining on your block
Sayin' to everyone
The power is on
While your alarm
Set up for safety
Keeps out invaders who come
But still can't control.

Control the violent side
Control the violent side
Control the violent side
Control the violent side.

Got to fight to control
the violent side
Every day and night
I've got to fight
to control it.
