People on the street
need a place to go
People on the street
need a place to go
Walkin' with the beat
if it's not too slow
Walkin' with the beat
if it's not too slow
When the night's
dark shadow falls
On the sidewalk scenes and
the concrete canyon walls.

People on the street
need a place to go
People on the street
need a place to go.

Walkin' through the night
up and down the avenue
Lookin' for a place,
A place to go,
A place to go.

There's a muffled scream
from the alley scene
From the alley scene
comes a muffled scream
And the siren wails
while the system fails
In the steaming heat
people walk in the street
People can't run and hide
If you want to feel good then
you gotta feel good inside.

People on the street
need a place to go
People on the street
need a place to go.

Rising through the grates
come the fumes of industry
Floating to the sky
Keep walkin' with the beat,
walkin' with the beat
Keep walkin' with the beat,
walkin' with the beat
Keep walkin' with the beat,
walkin' with the beat
When the night's
dark shadow falls
On the sidewalk scenes and
the concrete canyon walls.

People on the street
need a place to go
People on the street
need a place to go.
