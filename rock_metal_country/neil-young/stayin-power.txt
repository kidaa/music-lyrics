Our love, baby, feels so right
When you're smilin' in the morning light
I ain't leavin' no way

'Cause we got stayin' power
You and I
Stayin' power through thick and thin.

Stayin' power
You and I
Stayin' power through thick and thin.

Gold and diamonds say you're mine
But true love opens the gates of time
And as we go on our way

We got stayin' power
You and I
Stayin' power through thick and thin

Stayin' power
You and I
Stayin' power through thick and thin.
