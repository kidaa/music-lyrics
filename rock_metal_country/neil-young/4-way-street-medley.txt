He's a perfect stranger
Like a cross of himself and a fox
He's a feeling arranger
And a changer of the ways he talks

He's the unforseen danger
The keeper of the key to the locks
Know when you see him
Nothing can free him

Step aside, open wide
It's the loner

If you see him in the subway
He'll be down at the end of the car
Watching you move
Until he knows he knows who you are
When you get off at your station alone
He'll know that you are

Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside, open wide...

I wanna live with a cinnamon girl
I could be happy
the rest of my life
With a cinnamon girl

A dreamer of pictures
I run in the night
You see us together
chasing the moonlight
My cinnamon girl

Ten silver saxes,
a bass with a bow
The drummer relaxes
and waits between shows
For his cinnamon girl

A dreamer of pictures
I run in the night
You see us together
chasing the moonlight 
My cinnamon girl...

Be on my side,
I'll be on your side, baby
There is no reason for you to hide
It's so hard for me
staying here all alone
When you could be taking me
for a ride.

Yeah, she could drag me
over the rainbow, 
Send me away
Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river
Dead.

You take my hand,
I'll take your hand
Together we may get away
This much madness is
too much sorrow
It's impossible to make it today.

Yeah, she could drag me
over the rainbow, 
Send me away
Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river
Dead.

Be on my side,
I'll be on your side, baby
There is no reason for you to hide
It's so hard for me
staying here all alone
When you could be taking me
for a ride.
