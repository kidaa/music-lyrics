Won't you lay your big spike down
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay your big spike down
I always get in trouble
when you bring it round
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay it down.

I'm runnin',
I'm runnin', I'm runnin'
Down the proud highway
Yeah, I'm runnin',
I'm runnin', I'm runnin'
Down the proud highway
And as long as I keep movin'
I won't need a place to stay.

Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay your big spike down
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay your big spike down
I always get in trouble
when you bring that round
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay it down.

Well I'm here to deliver
I hope you can read my mail
I just escaped last night
From the memory county jail
I see your box is open
And you flag is up
My message is ready
If there's time enough.

Won't you lay your big spike down
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay your big spike down
I always get in trouble
when you bring it round
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay it down.
