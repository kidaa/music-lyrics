Just like a young boy
running down the road
I'm singing out
the same old song
Can't go back
the way I started from
The road goes on and on
Won't you help me, help me,
help me, help me,
Help me, help me,
help me, help me,
Take my way on home
Help me make my way on home
After Berlin.

Lights are shining
in the German sky
Cosmic walls
between the moon and I
Don't know where I started from
So won't you take me, take me,
take me, take me,
Take me, take me,
take me, take me,
Just the way I am
Ah, take me, just the way I am
After Berlin.

All day cruising
down the corridor
Seeing things
I never seen before
Tomorrow morning in old Berlin
Where they lock you out
or lock you in
Won't you save me, save me,
save me, save me,
Save me, save me,
save me, save me,
From the final day
Save me from the final day
After Berlin.

Just like a young boy
running down the road
I'm singing out
the same old song
I can't go back
the way I used to go
The road goes on and on
Won't you help me, help me,
help me, help me,
Help me, help me,
help me, help me,
Find my way back home
Won't you help me
make my way on home
After Berlin.

Help me, help me,
help me, help me.
Help me, help me,
help me, help me.
