The flash of a distant camera
reconnecting
thoughts and actions,
Fragments of our missing dreams,
Pieces from here and there
fall in place along the line,
Disappearing between you and me.

Life is changing everywhere I go,
New things and old both disappear.
If life is a photograph,
Fading in the mirror....

All I want is a song of love,
Song of love to sing for you.
All I need is this song of love,
To sing for you.

On the floor where daylight dances
With the ones
that missed their chances,
When they couldn't let it show,
Lies the land of sweet surrender,
Like a dream
it might have ended there,
but we didn't even know.

Now forever we will live as one,
Floating in love's atmosphere.
If love is a piece of dust,
Shining in the sun...

All I want is a song of love,
Song of love to sing for you.
All I need is this song of love,
To sing for you.

Song of love...
Song of love...
