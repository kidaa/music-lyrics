Sweet Joni from Saskatoon
There's a ring for your finger
It looks like the sun
But it feels like the moon

Sweet Joni from Saskatoon
Don't go, don't go too soon.

Who lives in an old hotel,
Near the ancient ruins.
Only time can tell,
Time can tell.

Go easy, the doorman said
The floor is slippery,
So watch your head.
This message read.

Sweet Joni from Saskatoon
There's a ring for your finger
It shines like the sun
But it feels like the moon.

Sweet Joni from Saskatoon
Don't go, don't go too soon.
