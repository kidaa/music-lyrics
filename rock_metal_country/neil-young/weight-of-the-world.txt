I used to carry
the weight of the world
On my back
I never trusted
my friends or my girl
Can you imagine that
I used to shuffle my feet
When I walked
I hung my head down low
Kept to myself
all my private thoughts
But when I met you girl.

I dropped the
weight of the world
Weight of the world
I dropped the
weight of the world
Weight of the world.

I knew some people
used to dance all night
But not me
I never knew
if it was wrong or right
To be so free
I used to close my eyes
And try to hide
from the light of love
Spent all my time
with the darkness inside
But when I met you girl.

I dropped
the weight of the world
Weight of the world
I dropped
the weight of the world
Weight of the world.

I was alone
for all of my life
I was alone
for all of my life
I was alone
for all of my life
I was alone
for all of my life
Until you came my way
I dropped
the weight of the world
Weight of the world
I dropped
the weight of the world
Weight of the world.
