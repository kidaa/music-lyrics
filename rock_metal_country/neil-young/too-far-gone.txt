When I woke up you were gone
And the sun was on the lawn
Empty pillow with perfume on
I smelled it.

Well, we met in my favorite bar
Took a ride in my old car
But I still don't know how
We made it home.

Was I too far gone
Too far gone
Too far gone
For you.

We had drugs and we had booze
But we still had something to lose
And by dawn I wanted
To marry you.

With our attitudes by day
And our secret dreams by night
Can we really live our lives
That way.

Am I too far gone
Too far gone
Too far gone
For you.

Was I too far gone
Too far gone
Too far gone
For you.
