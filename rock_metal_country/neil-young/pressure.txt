A funny thing
happened yesterday
I felt the pressure
in a brand new way
It kept hitting me
from all directions
I got this feeling
I was cracking up
My knees were shaking and
I couldn't close my eyes
I fought to gain control
and make corrections
A funny thing
happened yesterday
I felt the pressure
in a TV way.

Don't feel, don't feel
Feel pressure from me
Don't feel, don't feel
No pressure from me
Don't feel, don't feel
Feel pressure from me.

You watch the box
and the video jocks
If you could talk that
could even be you up there
That's why you need
max head room
Too much pressure
for peace on earth
Too much tryin'
to get your money's worth
Too much dying
The Eldorado,
the Mercedes Benz
The job security
that never ends.

Don't feel, don't feel
Feel pressure from me
Don't feel, don't feel
No pressure from me
Don't feel, don't feel
Feel pressure from me
Don't feel, don't feel
No pressure from me.

I feel the pressure
building every night
One of these days I'm gonna
go out like a light
Oh, baby
I feel the pressure
building every night
One of these days I'm gonna
go out like a light.
