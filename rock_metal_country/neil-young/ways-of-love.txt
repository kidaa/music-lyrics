You are my special one
Made my heart come all undone
We've been havin' too much fun
Now someone else
Will sleep with tears
When he hears
What we've done.

Oh, the ways of love
Oh, the ways of love.

Hear my song
and hear my heart
We'll be gone
when the music starts
Then we'll never be apart
Just you and I
Go flyin' by
No one to cry
That we're gone.

Oh, the ways of love
Oh, the ways of love.

You are my special one
Made my heart come all undone
We've been havin' too much fun
Now someone else
Will sleep with tears
When he hears
What we've done.

Oh, the ways of love
Oh, the ways of love.
