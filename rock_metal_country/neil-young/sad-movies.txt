Day and night we walk these aisles
In the same old movie show
And look for someone
to feel for a while.
There's matinees on Saturdays
When we sit in the velvet chairs
Popcorn boxes fly through the air.

Sad movies, they make you cry
Sad movies make you wonder why
You ever came.
Do something to me,
Don't make me wait
Stab something through me,
Don't cry out the good things
That I appreciate.

Day and night we walk these aisles
In the same old movie show
And look for someone
to feel for a while
The light's go on, the movie's gone
And the manager's up there
He says he doesn't care
And we take our money back.

Sad movies, they make you cry
Sad movies make you wonder why
You ever came.
