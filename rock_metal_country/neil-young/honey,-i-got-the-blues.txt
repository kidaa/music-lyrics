Now, New York City
on a Friday night
A lot of things happenin',
a lot of bright lights.
Saw a pretty woman
all dressed in red
She turned to me
and this is what she said
She said, Honey I got the blues
I got the blues
from ridin' all night
in these high heel shoes.

Well, she took me to the corner
that she called her home
Turned around
and we were all alone.
Come on in, she said with a smile
Come on in and we can rest a while.
Well, Honey I got the blues
I got the blues
from ridin' all night
in these high heel shoes.

I said, Listen here,
honey, I been around
You ain't foolin' me, 'cause
I know what you've found.
She bent kinda low and then
she tickled my lips.
She said, Listen here, son,
I'm gonna give you a tip
Honey I got the blues
I got the blues
from ridin' all night
in these high heel shoes.
