When I was a young boy,
it weren't too late
I had me a Buick, was a '48
Yeah, tons and tons
of rollin' steel
With a long black hoad
and four big wheels.

Well, I worked so hard
I flunked out of school
And everybody said
I was a teenage fool
Meanwhile I wrote me
a new set of rules
'Bout how to get gone
and how to be cool.

Well, we hit the road
like a ton o' bricks
With an old guitar
and a few hot licks
We were rockin' in the city
and rockin' in the sticks
Didn't make much money
but we had a lotta kicks.

Get gone, get gone
Get gone, oh yeah, get gone
Get gone, get gone
Get gone, oh yeah, get gone.

Well, then one day
a city slicker walked up
Said, son, I'm gonna make you
a million bucks
Gonna fly around the country
in a big ol' plane
Gonna get a lotta drugs,
gonna feel no pain.

Well, I knew we were breakin'
that highway rule
When we pulled outta town
a little low on fuel
That big ol' plane
fell from the sky
Me and the boys
kissed the world goodbye
Yeah, me and the boys
kissed the world goodbye.

Get gone, get gone
Get gone, oh yeah, get gone
Get gone, get gone
Get gone, oh yeah, get gone.
