Too lonely, too lonely
Too lonely to fall in love
Too lonely, too lonely
Too lonely to fall in love.

I got a key chain
Good luck charm
I drive a fast car
Got a strong arm.

Too lonely, too lonely
Too lonely to fall in love
Too lonely, too lonely
Too lonely to fall in love.

She's got the big lips
She's got the tight dress
Working for a big tip
She don't go for less.

She's too lonely, too lonely
Too lonely to fall in love
Too lonely, too lonely
Too lonely to fall in love.

She wears a fur coat
She's got a gold ring
Comes from a good home
Lookin' for a new thing.

She's too lonely, too lonely
Too lonely to fall in love
Too lonely, too lonely
Too lonely to fall in love.
