Don't cry no tears around me
Don't cry no tears around me
'Cause when all the water's gone
The feeling lingers on
Old true love
ain't too hard to see
Don't cry no tears around me.

Well I wonder
who's with her tonight
And I wonder
who's holding her tight
But there's nothing I can say
To make him go away
Old true love
ain't too hard to see
Don't cry no tears around me.

There's nothing I can say
To make him go away
Old true love
ain't too hard to see
Don't cry no tears around me
Don't cry no tears around me.
