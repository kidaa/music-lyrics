"when the red light shines
On the streets of hate
Where the devil dines
Who knows what he ate

It's a simple thing 
Trying to stay afloat,"
The captain said
Without his boat

"some things are getting better
Other things a little worse
It's a situation
Much like a curse

It's the devil's sidewalk greendale
It's the devil's door greendale
I try to avoid it," greendale
Said the captain of the shore greendale

"there's a garden growing greendale
And a million weeds greendale
With no way of knowing greendale
Who has done which deed" greendale

"that's an honest tale,"
Said the helmsman to the mate,
"about a woman delicious
And a matter of fate"

Big wheel's still rolling
Down on me
One thing i can tell you
Is you got to be free

John lennon said that
And i believe in love
I believe in action
When push comes to shove

"who cares what you believe,"
Said the captain amazed,
"if you stood in my shoes
Your eyes would be glazed"

So my fair damsel greendale
Won't you take your leave greendale
Are you headed for the country greendale
Where you wear the green sleeve greendale

And the children laugh greendale
And the old folks sing greendale
And the church bells toll greendale 
For a miraculous thing greendale

Where the big red furnace greendale
Just glows and glows greendale
Where the big heart beats greendale
Where the big wheel rolls greendale
