People sleepin' on the sidewalks
On a rainy day
Families livin' under freeways
It's the American way
Starvin' in the city
While the farm goes to seed
Murder in the home
And crime on the streets.

Don't that trouble you brother
Don't that trouble you pal
Don't that trouble you sister
Well, that's life in the city.

All our old hangouts
Are boarded up and closed
Or being sold to someone
Nobody knows
I got a woman that loves me
And I love her so
She's all dressed up now
With nowhere to go.

Don't that trouble you brother
Don't that trouble you pal
Don't that trouble you sister
Well, that's life in the city.

That's life in the city.

Listen to me people
Hear what I have to say
Ever since I was knee high
I rocked my blues away
But people
sleepin' on the sidewalks
And families in need
Murder in the home
And crime on the streets.

Don't that trouble you brother
Don't that trouble you pal
Don't that kill you sister
Well, that's life in the city.
