Out on the road
the traffic slowed
down to a crawl
Strobe lights flashin'
on the overpass
The tangled steel
could not reveal
what no one saw
Or how he walked away
without a scratch
He thought of her
and walked along
the exit ramp
He touched the night
between two
old street lamps.

And every one
will touch the night
And every one
will touch the night
And every one
will touch the night.

Imagine blue
dissolve into
the empty night
Slowly fadin'
no one answerin'
She walked away
and left him standing
all alone
Between the shadows
of his memory
And those who loved
and lost will know
the way it feels
To touch the night
without the one
you love.

And every one
will touch the night
And every one
will touch the night
And every one
will touch the night.
