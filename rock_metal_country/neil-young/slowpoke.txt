Something opened up
the gates again,
I can't control it,
so I rushed right in.
Here comes a mermaid
and a little girl,
Saw open drawers
from around the world.

I got some medals
hanging on my chest,
I've seen some good ones,
but I missed the rest.
Lady luck don't you turn on me,
I'm just a student of your history,
I'm just a student of your history.

Slowpoke I'm gonna run with you,
Wear all your clothes and
do what you do.
Slowpoke
we got some things to find,
When I was faster,
I was always behind,
When I was faster,
I was always behind.

Something pushed back
the curtain again,
The stage is empty
and the crowd is thin.
The song is gentle,
but the song is now.
Something's missing,
but something is found,
Something's missing,
but something is found,
Something's missing,
but something is found.

Slowpoke I'm gonna run with you,
Wear all your clothes and
do what you do.
Slowpoke
we got some things to find,
When I was faster,
I was always behind.
When I was faster,
When I was faster,
I was always behind,
When I was faster......
