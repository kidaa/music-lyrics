Don't need drugs,
don't want money
You come along
and shook me honey
All I want is
you right by my side

With our love taken care of
From now on I ain't scared of
Lonely nights, I can
kiss those days good-bye.

Although we walk in the rain
My heart feels sunny inside
With you babe.

Long blonde hair, blue blue eyes
Come on baby, please don't cry
Talk to me,
let me know it's alright.

Although we walk in the rain
My heart feels sunny inside
With you babe.

Feel sunny inside
Sunny inside.

All day long
I will sing my song to you
All day long
I can sing this song to you.
