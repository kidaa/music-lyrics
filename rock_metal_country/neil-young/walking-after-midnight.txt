There's a face in the window
Lookin' back at me
There's a face in the window
I just can't see.
That face in the window
Keeps haunting me.

I went walking after midnight
Up and down the street
I went walking after midnight
Up and down the street
When I stopped for a smoke
I heard shuffling feet.

Well, I stopped for a smoke
What did I see
A face in the filter
Lookin' back at me.

Ah, listen to me baby
Hear what I have to say.
Yeah, listen to me baby
Hear what I have to say.
These midnight blues
They won't go away
These midnight blues
Won't go away.

Yeah, I stopped for a smoke
What did I see
A face in the filter
Lookin' back at me.

I'm walking after midnight
Well, I'm walking after midnight.
