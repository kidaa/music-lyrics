A hip drag queen and
a side-walkin' street wheeler,
Comin' down the avenue.
They're all your friends,
you'll come to love 'em
There's a load of 'em
waitin' for you.

Lookout Joe, you're comin' home.
Old times were good times,
Old times were good times.

Remember Millie
from down in Philly
She took my brain
and forgot my name.
The woman you were with
was about the same
She took your money and left town.

Lookout Joe, you're comin' home.
Old times were good times,
Old times were good times.

Glory Hallelujah!
Will I lay my burden down
Singin' on the streets around:
Look at that crazy clown.

Remember Bill from up on the hill
A Cadillac put a hole in his arm.
But old Bill, he's up there still,
Havin' a ball
rollin' to the bottom.

Lookout Joe, you're comin' home.
Old times were good times,
Old times were good times.
