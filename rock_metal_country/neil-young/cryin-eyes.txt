Who's gonna dry your cryin' eyes
Who's gonna wake you up
to that big surprise
Who's gonna dry your cryin' eyes

You say that all your life
you've been a free bird
There's been nobody over you
And you always have to
have the last word
Because one feels better than two.

Who's gonna dry your cryin' eyes
Who's gonna wake you up
to that big surprise
Who's gonna dry your cryin' eyes

You say your life's
like riding on a fast train
It's easy to see far away
But right up close
it's just a blurry haze
Flyin' by from day to day.

Who's gonna dry your cryin' eyes
