If you see Liberty tell her I will
Buy her windows on the hill
Laud her flowers on the sill
Till they grow higher and higher.

If Liberty was a little girl
Watching all the flags unfurl
Standing at the big parade
How would she like us now

We balance the power
From hour to hour
Giant guns rage
It's such a long walk home
It's such a long walk home
It's such a long walk home.

From Vietnam to old Beirut
If we are searching for the truth
Why do we feel
that double-edged blade
Cutting through our hand.

America, America
Where have we gone
It's such a long walk home
It's such a long walk home
It's such a long walk home.

We balance the power
From hour to hour
Giant guns rage
It's such a long walk home
It's such a long walk home
It's such a long walk home.
