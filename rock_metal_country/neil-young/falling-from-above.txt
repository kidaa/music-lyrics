Grandpa said to cousin jed
Sittin' on the porch,
"i won't retire 
But i might retread

Seems like that guy singin' this song
Been doin' it for a long time
Is there anything he knows
That he ain't said?

Sing a song for freedom
Sing a song for love
Sing a song for depressed angels
Falling from above"

Grandpa held the paper
Pretendin' he could see
But he couldn't read without his glasses on

"how can all these people
Afford so many things?
When i was young
People wore what they had on...and mama said

'a little love and affection
In everything you do
Will make the world a better place
With or without you'"

A little love and affection
In everything you do  

Slammin' down a late night shot
The hero and the artist compared
Goals and visions and afterthoughts
For the 21st century

But mostly came up with nothin'
So the truth was never learned
And the human race just kept rollin' on

Rollin' through the fighting
Rollin' through the religious wars
Rollin' down the temple walls
And the church's exposed sores

Rollin' through the fighting
The religious wars
Mostly came up with nothin'

"grandpa here's your glasses
You'll see much better now,"
Said that young girl of edith and earl's
But grandpa just kept starin'
He was lost in some distant thought
Then he turned and said 
To that young girl

"a little love and affection
In everything you do
Will make the world a better place
With or without you"

With or without you
A better place
With or without you
With or without you

Hear that rooster crowin'
Down on the double e
It's a new morning
Dawning on the green

Bouncing off the towers
And the sun's heading down for the streets
The business meeting
Window shades are drawn

Another morning edition
Headed for the porch
Because grandma puts down the paper
Before grandpa raises his fork

A little love and affection
In everything you do
With or without you

Hear the rooster crowing 
Down on the double e
