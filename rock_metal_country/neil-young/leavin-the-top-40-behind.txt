Here comes another day
And another
I got so many ills and pills
I'm about to smother
Hit 39, leavin' the top 40 behind
Holdin' on to what I got

I tried to tell myself
It doesn't matter
It's just the time of life
Another rung in the ladder
Each morning I
Look in her sky-blue eyes
The downside of life looks better

That old man standin' on the corner
He should be proud
of those lines on his face
'cos either he's
been laughin' too much
Or feelin' too much pain

Here comes another day
And another
I sure am glad
I got you for a lover
Hit 39, leavin' the top 40 behind
Holdin' on to what I got

That old man standin' on the corner
He should be proud
of those lines on his face
'cos either he's
been smilin' too much
Or feelin' too much pain

Here comes another day
And another
I sure am glad
I got you for a lover
Hit 39, I'm leavin'
the top 40 behind
Holdin' on to what I got

Hit 39, leavin' the top 40 behind
Holdin' on to what I got
