Once I was in love
Now, it seems that time
Is better spent
Searching than in finding
But no one seems to know.

So don't say you lose,
Don't say you lose,
Don't say you win,
And no one else will know,
No one else will know.

When you're down
you gather strength
To leave the ground
And when you're high
It makes you weak
and you fall back down.

Once I was in love
Now, it seems that time
Is better spent
Searching than in finding
But no one seems to know.
