Lookin' for a Leader 
To bring our country home 
Re-unite the red white and blue 
Before it turns to stone 

Lookin' for somebody 
Young enough to take it on 
Clean up the corruption 
And make the country strong 

Walkin' among our people 
There's someone who's straight and strong 
To lead us from desolation 
And a broken world gone wrong 

Someone walks among us 
And I hope he hears the call 
And maybe it's a woman 
Or a black man after all 

Yeah maybe it's Obama 
But he thinks that he's too young 
Maybe it's Colin Powell 
To right what he's done wrong 

America has a leader 
But he's not in the house 
He's waling here among us 
And we've got to seek him out 

Yeah we've got our election 
But corruption has a chance 
We got to have a clean win 
To regain confidence 

America is beautiful 
But she has an ugly side 
We're lookin' for a leader 
In this country far and wide 

We're lookin' for a leader 
With the great spirit on his side 

Someone walks among us 
And I hope he hears the call 
And maybe it's a woman 
Or a black man after all
