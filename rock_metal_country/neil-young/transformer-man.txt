Transformer man, transformer man
You run the show
Remote control
Direct the action
with the push of a button
You're a transformer man
Power in your hand
Transformer man, transformer man.

Transformer man, transformer man
Sooner or later you'll have to see
The cause and effect
So many things still left to do
But we haven't made it yet
Every morning
when I look in your eyes
I feel electrified by you. Oh yes.

Transformer man, transformer man
Transformer man
Still in command
You're eyes are shining on a beam
Through the galaxy of love
Transformer man, transformer man
Unlock the secrets
Let us throw off the chains that
Hold you down.

Transformer man, transformer man
Sooner or later
you'll have to learn
The cause and effect
So many things still left to do
But we haven't made it yet
Every morning
when I look in your eyes
I feel electrified by you. Oh yes.

Transformer man, transformer man
Transformer man, transformer man
