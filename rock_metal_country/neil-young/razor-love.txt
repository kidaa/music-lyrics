I got to bet
that your old man
Became fascinated
with his own plan
Turned you loose,
your mama too
There wasn't a thing
that you could do.

But I got faith in you,
It's a razor love
that cuts clean through.
I got faith in you,
It's a razor love
that cuts clean through.

You really made my day
With the little things you say

Looking through
the window at a silhouette
Trying to find something
I can't find yet
Imagination is my best friend
Got to look out for
the greedy hand, greedy hand
Make a living like a rolling stone
On the road
there's no place like home
Silhouettes on the window.

Who was it made
your eyes flicker like that
Tell me baby,
how'd you get the knack
You came to me with open arms
And I really
took you down the track

Now all I've got for you,
Is the kind of love
that cuts clean through.
All I got for you is razor love
It cuts clean through.

You really made my day
With the little things you say

Now I'm looking through
the window at a silhouette
Trying to find something
I can't find yet
Imagination is my best friend
Got to watch out for
the greedy hand, greedy hand
Make a living like a rolling stone
On the road
there's no place like home
Silhouettes on the window.

You really make my day
With the little things you say.
