There's a world you're living in
No one else has your part
All God's children in the wind
Take it in and blow hard.

Look around it, have you found it
Walking down the avenue
See what it brings,
could be good things
In the air for you.

We are leaving. We are gone.
Come with us to all alone.
Never worry. Never moan.
We will leave you all alone.

In the mountains, in the cities,
You can see the dream.
Look around you. Has it found you
Is it what it seems

There's a world you're living in
No one else has your part
All God's children in the wind
Take it in and blow hard.
