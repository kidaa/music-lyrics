Don't say you love me
That's what she said
Don't say you love me
That's what she said

Hey baby
I'm your man
I know I treated you bad
But I'm doin' the best I can

Now is not the time
To cash it in
I'm with you babe
I've always been

And I got to tell you baby
That our love is strong
And I'm the one
The one that did you wrong

Don't say you love me
That's what she said
Don't say you love me
That's what she said

Hey baby
Don't count me out
I still got a lot to give
Stick around and find out

I might surprise you
With what our love still brings
I'm never quiting you
Even if you quit me

And I got to tell you baby
Our love is strong
And I'm the one
The one that did you wrong

Don't say you love me
That's what she said
Don't say you love me
That's what she said

Don't say you love me
Don't say you love me
Don't say you love me
Don't say you love me
