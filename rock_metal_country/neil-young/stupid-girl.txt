You're just a stupid girl
You really got a lot to learn
Start living again
Forget about remembering
You're such a stupid girl.

You're such a beautiful fish
Floppin' on the summer sand
Lookin' for the wave you missed
When another one is close at hand
You're such a stupid girl.

You're such a stupid girl.

I saw you in Mercedes Benz
Practicing self-defense
You got it pretty good I guess
I couldn't see your eyes
You're really stupid, girl.

You're such a stupid girl.
