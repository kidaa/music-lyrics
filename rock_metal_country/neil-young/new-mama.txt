New mama's got a sun in her eyes
No clouds are in my changing skies
Each morning when I wake up to rise
I'm livin' in a dreamland.

Changing times,
ancient reasons,
that turn to lies
Throw them all away
Head in hand,
gift of wonders to understand
And open all the way.

New mama's got a sun in her eyes
No clouds are in my changing skies
Each morning when I wake up to rise
I'm livin' in a dreamland.
