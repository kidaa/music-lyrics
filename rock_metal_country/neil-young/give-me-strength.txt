A lonely man I know myself to be
It's not as bad
as some things I have seen.
The picture painted here
is not a dream
The only reality
is the way it seems.

The happier you fly
The sadder you fall
The laughter in your eyes
Is never all.

Give me strength to move along.
Give me strength
to leave my sweetheart.

I'm riding down this wet road
in my old car
The moon is almost full
except for stars.
The party ended
long before the night
She made me feel alive
and that's all right.

The happier you fly
The sadder you fall
The laughter in your eyes
Is never all.

Give me strength to move along.
Give me strength
to leave while she's gone.

The happier you fly
The sadder you fall
The laughter in your eyes
Is never all.

Give me strength to move along.
Give me strength to move along.
Give me strength to move along.
