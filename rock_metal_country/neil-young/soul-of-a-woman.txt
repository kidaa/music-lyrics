You can't help nobody,
until you help yourself
You can't help nobody,
until you help yourself
Nobody's going to help you
better than somebody else.

You know a man needs a woman
right by his side.
A  man needs a woman
right by his side.
She keeps him warm at night,
he keeps her satisfied.

Soul of a woman, soul of a man
A perfect combination
ever since the world began.
Soul of a woman
Soul of a woman, soul of a man.

You can't help nobody,
until you help yourself
You can't help nobody,
until you help yourself
Nobody's going to help you
better than somebody else.

You know a man needs a woman
right by his side.
A  man needs a woman
right by his side.
She keeps him warm at night,

Soul of a woman, soul of a man
A perfect combination

Soul of a woman
Soul of a woman, soul of a man.
