The sun is setting
on the long road home
And I've been gone too long
My little girl's waitin'
by the front door
I count the minutes
till I hold you once more.

Making love to you
while time stands still
I may be dreamin',
but I always will
'Cause I'll be holding you
When the twilight falls.

Don't be lonely, don't be sad
'Cause you're the best thing
that I ever had
And true love is so hard to find
And we were lookin'
for such a long time.

Making love to you
while time stands still
I may be dreamin',
but I always will
'Cause I'll be holding you
When the twilight falls.

Don't be sad,
you're the best thing
that I ever had.

The sun is settin'
on the long road home.
