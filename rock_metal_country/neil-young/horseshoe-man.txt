In the land of the broken hearted
People looking
for the horseshoe man
They've been
picking up little pieces
They've been
putting them all in his hand

And the way the story started
Two lovers long ago
Took a vow to live with hearbreak
Took a chance,
but how could they know...

...love
How could they know love
Love,
How could they know love

Horseshoe man's
been working his magic
Fixing heartbreak everywhere
He's the one we all can count on
When we're lost
and don't know where love is

He takes the pieces in his hands
And shakes 'em up
like he doesn't care
He says that there
will always be heartbreak
Because love is everywhere

Love, I don't know about love
Love, I don't know...

Love don't care
if you're wrong or right
Love don't know if
you're black or white
Love ain't looking
for perfection
Love's the answer,
love's the question

Love, I don't know about love
Love, I don't know

Love, I don't know about love
Love, I don't know about love
