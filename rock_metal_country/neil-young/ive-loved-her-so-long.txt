She's a victim of her senses
Do you know her
Can you see her in the distance
As she tumbles by
Veteran of a race
that should be over
Can you hear her sigh
With wings to fly
She rolls along
Doing it wrong.

Oh, I've loved her so long
Oh, I've loved her so long
There's a place that I know
We could go
get away for a while
I can bring her the peace
That she needs
Give her reason to smile.

Oh, I've loved her so long
