Selling papers on the corner,
I saw a man yesterday.
I asked him if he'd wanna
Tell me what made him this way.
He said, when it's born, it's warm,
Then it gathers strength in lies,
When it falls, it falls all over you.

He used to pick his friends.
They left him in the end.
An easy thing to lose,
The right to pick and choose.
When it's born, it's warm,
Then it gathers strength in lies,
When it falls, it falls all over you.

He said he left his wife,
The back-bone of his life.
Another came along,
But now I guess she's gone.
When it's born, it's warm,
Then it gathers strength in lies,
When it falls, it falls all over you.

I think I used to see
That old man on TV,
Can you be the same
It seems like such a shame.
When it's born, it's warm,
Then it gathers strength in lies,
When it falls, it falls all over you.

The world he thought he knew,
Has better things to do.
As I went on my way
I thought I heard him say:
When it's born, it's warm,
Then it gathers strength in lies,
When it falls, it falls all over you.
