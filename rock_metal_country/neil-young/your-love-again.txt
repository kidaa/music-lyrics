I don't wanna bring you down
I don't wanna change you
All I want is
Your love again

You and I want different things
But we need each other
All I want is
Your love again

Love is always changin' faces
Who knows what it means
The whole World is tryin' to find
The answer to its' dreams

Why should we lose what we got
We could rearrange it
All I want is
Your love again

I don't wanna break your heart
I just wanna hold you
All I want is
Your love again

You and I knew from the start
Now we gotta make it happen
All I need is
Your love again

When you walked into my life
On the heels of a dream
I thought I saw in your eyes
A little bit of me

I don't wanna change your life
I just wanna share it
All I want is
Your love again

All I want is
Your love again
