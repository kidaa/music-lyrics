Someone wants to blow up the planet
Johnny wants to find out why
Johnny did a show in St. Louis
Love came through the sky.

Oh yeah, they were camped out,
Waiting for the sun to rise
Oh yeah, Johnny sang out
Love into the sky.

Johnny found a place out in Texas
Waiting for him to come
Made himself a reservation
And hope came, in the gun.

Oh yeah, he was flying,
Waiting for the sun to rise
Oh yeah, color by numbers
Waiting for the sun to rise.

Johnny did some time in the army
Johnny did a stint in Vietnam.
Now he can't forget it,
His mind is confused,
slipping from his twisted hand.

Oh yeah, he's still back there
With one hand on the gun
Oh yeah, he's still back there
Waiting for the rising sun.

Now Johnny
likes to go down the highway
The wind singing in his ears
Right up as
most things go whirring by
By day everything looks clear.

Oh yeah, Johnny ride on
Gonna find a special home
Oh yeah, down the highway
Looking for the rising sun.
