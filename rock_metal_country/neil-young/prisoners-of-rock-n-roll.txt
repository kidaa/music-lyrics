People tell us
that we play too loud
But they don't know
what our music's about
We never listen
to the record company man
They try to change us
and ruin our band.

That's why we don't wanna be good
That's why we don't wanna be good
We're prisoners of rock and roll.

When were jammin'
in our old garage
The girls come over
and it sure gets hot
We don't wanna be watered down
Takin' orders
from record company clowns.

That's why we don't wanna be good
That's why we don't wanna be good
We're prisoners of rock and roll.

We're prisoners of rock and roll.
