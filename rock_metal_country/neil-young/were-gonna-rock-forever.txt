Down the highway,
all across the nation
Trucks are moving rough,
we pass the break of day
Sure looks like
we're all gonna rock forever.
Rock, rock, rock.

After midnight you see
the big trucks rolling
Pushing metal on down the super slab
Sure hard to tell from here
where we are going
Rock, rock, rock.

Do it inside, do it outside, baby
Do it over again in the same old way
From now on
we're all gonna rock together.
Rock, rock, rock.

Sure looks like
we're all gonna rock forever.
The way we just keep rolling on and on
Yeah, sure looks like
we're all gonna rock forever.
Rock, rock, rock.
