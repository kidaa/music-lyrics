Said the condor
to the preying mantis
We're gonna lose this place
just like we lost Atlantis
Brother we got to go
sooner than you know
The Gypsy told my fortune,
she said that nothin' showed.

Who put the bomb
on the sacred altar
Why should we die
if it comes our way
Why should we care
about a little button
Being pushed by someone
we don't even know

Well. I wish I was an Aztec,
Or a runner in Peru
I would build such
beautiful buildings
To house the chosen few
Like an Inca from Peru.

If you want to get high,
build a strong foundation
Sink those pylons deep now
and reach for the sky
If you want to get lost
in the jungle rhythm
Get down on the ground
and pretend you're swimmin'.

If you want to put ice
in the lava river
First you must climb,
then you must stand and shiver
Brother we got to go
sooner than you know
The Gypsy told my fortune,
the Gypsy told my fortune,
The Gypsy told my fortune,
she said that nothing showed

Well I wish I was an Aztec,
Or a runner in Peru
I would build
such beautiful buildings
To house the chosen few
Like an Inca from Peru.

Said the condor
to the preying mantis
We're gonna lose this place
just like we lost Atlantis
Brother we got to go
sooner than you know
The Gypsy told my fortune,
the Gypsy told my fortune,
The Gypsy told my fortune,
she said that nothin' showed.

Who put the bomb

Why should we die

Why should we care

Being pushed by someone
we don't even know

Well. I wish I was an Aztec,
Or a runner in Peru
I would build
such beautiful buildings
To house the chosen few
Like an Inca from Peru.

I feel sad, but I feel happy
As I'm coming back to home
There's a bridge across the river
That I have to cross alone
Like a skipping rolling stone
Like an Inca.
