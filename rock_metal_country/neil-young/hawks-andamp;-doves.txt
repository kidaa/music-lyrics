Ain't getting old,
ain't getting younger though
Just getting used
to the lay of the land
I ain't tongue-tied,
just don't got nothin' to say
I'm proud to be livin' in the U.S.A.

Ready to go, willin' to stay and pay
U.S.A., U.S.A.
So my sweet love can dance
another free day
U.S.A., U.S.A.

In history we painted pictures grim
The devil knows
we might feel that way again
The big wind blows,
so the tall grass bends
But for you don't
push too hard my friend.

Ready to go, willin' to stay and pay
U.S.A., U.S.A.
So my sweet wife can dance
another free day
U.S.A., U.S.A.

Got people here
down on their knees and prayin'
Hawks and doves
are circlin' in the rain
Got rock and roll,
got country music playin'
If you hate us, you just
don't know what you're sayin'.

Ready to go, willin' to stay and pay
U.S.A., U.S.A.
So my sweet love can dance
another free day
U.S.A., U.S.A.
