You who rule
upon the land, 
You hold the future
in your hand, 
When you take your people
down the road, 
Before another bomb
explodes. 
Can you do it
in the name of love 
Can you do it
in the name of love 

And when you sail
upon the sea 
This one's for you,
this one's for me. 
Before another missile
flies 
You who soar into the sky 
Can you do it
in the name of love 
Can you do it
in the name of love 

And so I shout it
around the world 
To every boy and every girl, 
Yeah, I shout it
around the world 
To every boy and every girl, 
Can you do it
in the name of love 
Can you do it
in the name of love 

Can you do it
in the name of love
