Down in the valley
the sheperd sees
His flock is close at hand
And in the night sky
a star is falling down
From someone's hand

Somewhere, somehwere,
I gotta get somewhere
It's not too late,
it's not too late
I've got to get somewhere 

This time I will
take the lead somehow
This time you won't
have to show me how

When dreams come
crashing down like trees
I don't know what love can do
When life is
hanging in the breeze
I don't know what love can do

My heart, my heart
I've got to keep my heart
It's not too late,
it's not too late
I've got to keep my heart

My love, I will give
to you, it's true
Although I'm not sure
what love can do

Somehwere, somewhere
I've got to get somewhere
It's not too late,
it's not too late
I've got to get somewhere

Somewhere someone
has a dream come true
Somehow someone
has a dream come true
