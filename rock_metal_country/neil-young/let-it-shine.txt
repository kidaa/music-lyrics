There's a light on
over my head, my Lord
There's a light on
over my head, my Lord
Let it shine, let it shine
Although it may not be
the only one
Let it shine, shine, shine
Although it may not be
the only one.

There's a moon roof
over my head, my Lord
And my Lincoln is still
the best thing built by Ford
Let it roll, let it roll
Although it may not be
the only one
Let me ride, ride, ride, ride,
Although I may not be
the only one.

I got religion
in the airport, my Lord
They caught me waiting on
my baggage when I was bored
Let them chant, let them chant
Although they may not be
the only one
Let them dance, dance, dance
Although they may not be
the only one.

There's a light on
over my head, my Lord
There's a light on
over my head, let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine
Although it may not be
the only one
Let me shine, shine, shine, shine
Although I may not be
the only one.
