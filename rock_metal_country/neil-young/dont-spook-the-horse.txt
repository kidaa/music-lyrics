If you want to go riding
in the tall green grass,
Try to not spook the horse.

If you want to pet
that old hound dog,
Make sure he ain't
rolled in shit.

There's a pretty little girl,
and she's living down there,
Down on her daddy's farm.

If you're going to mess
around with that chick,
Be sure to close the barn door.

Try to not spook the horse.
Make sure she ain't
rolled in shit.

There's a field of green
and an old red barn
Deep in the valley of hearts.

If you want to go riding
in the tall green grass
Try to not spook the horse.

Try to not spook the horse.
