There ain't no way
I'm gonna let the good times go,
There ain't no way
I'm gonna let the good times go,
The touch of my woman
can soothe my soul,
When she makes me feel right
that's when the good times roll.

Oh she's a healer to me,
Oh yeah.

My blue-eyed woman is a mystery to me,
My blue-eyed woman is a mystery to me,
The touch of my woman
can soothe my soul,
When she makes me feel right
that's when the good times roll.

Oh she's a healer to me,
Oh yeah.

Way out on the prairie
where the wheat fields grow,
Way out on the prairie
back where the wheat fields grow,
I stop to slap plastic at an Esso station,
About a thousand miles from my destination.

Oh she's a healer to me,
Oh yeah, she's a healer to me.

All I got is a broken heart,
And I don't try to hide it
when I play my guitar.

My blue-eyed woman is a healer to me,
Without that woman I'm history,
My blue-eyed woman is a love ghost,
Without that woman I'm toast.

Oh she's a healer to me,
Oh yeah, she's a healer to me.

All I got is a broken heart,
And I don't try to hide it
when I play my guitar.
