We are men at work
We got a job to do
We gotta keep you rockin'
To keep your soul from the blue.
Well, we work all day
Then we work all night
We got to keep you dancin'
Gotta make you feel alright.

Ten men workin',
ten men workin' tonight.

We gotta dig the groove
We're gonna hammer the blues
You can't sit down
'Cause we got a job to do.
We gotta dig the groove
We're gonna hammer the blues
You can't sit down
'Cause we got a job to do.
