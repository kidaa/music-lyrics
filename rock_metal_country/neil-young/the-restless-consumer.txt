The people have heard the news 
The people have spoken 
You may not like what they said 
But they weren't jokin' 

Way out on the desert sands 
Lies a desperate lover 
They call her the "Queen of Oil" 
So much to discover 

Don't need no ad machine 
Telling me what I need 
Don't need no Madison Avenue War 
Don't need no more boxes I can see 

Covered in flags but I can't see them on TV 

Don't need no more lies 
Don't need no more lies 
Don't need no more lies 
Don't need no more lies 

The restless consumer flies 
Around the world each day 
With such an appetite for taste and grace 

People from around the world 
Need someone to listen 
We're starving and dying from our disease 
We need your medicine 
How do you pay for war 
And leave us dyin' ? 
When you could do so much more 
You're not even tryin' 

Don't need no TV ad 
Tellin' me how sick I am 
Don't want to know how many people are like me 
Don't need no dizziness 
Don't need no nausea 
Don't need no side effects like diarrhea or sexual death 

Don't need no more lies 
Don't need no more lies 
Don't need no more lies 
Don't need no more lies 

The restless consumer lies 
Asleep in her hotel 
With such an appetite 
For anything that sells 

A hundred voices from a hundred lands 
Need someone to listen 
People are dying here and there 
They don't see the world the way you do 
There's no mission accomplished here 
Just death to thousands 

A hundred voices from a hundred lands 
Cry out in unison 

Don't need no terror squad 
Don't want no damned Jihad 
Blowin' themselves away in my hood 
But we don't talk to them 
So we don't learn from them 
Hate don't negotiate with Good 

Don't need no more lies 
Don't need no more lies 
Don't need no more lies 
Don't need no more lies 

The restless comsumer flies 
Around the world each day 
With such an appetite for efficiency 
And pace...

Don't need no more lies.
