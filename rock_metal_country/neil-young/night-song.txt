Tell me where
Does it say
When you're lost
you stay that way
Why a forest of fools
getting in the way
Cannot hear, cannot
fade with the nightsong.

Nightsong, from my heart
Why can't we
Sing this nightsong.

All alone
I reflect on my demons
in the night
Some are wise,
Some are good
Some are not so bright
I can't hear
Sing along
with the nightsong.

Nightsong, from my heart
Why can't we
Sing this nightsong.

Why not
keep on singing anyway

Run away
I don't know what it was
Led you astray
Just because you're too much
like I am anyway
I will come
You can't hide
From the nightsong.

Nightsong, from my heart
Why can't we
Sing this nightsong.

Why not
keep on singing anyway
