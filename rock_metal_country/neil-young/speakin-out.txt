I went to the movie
the other night,
The plot was groovy,
it was out of sight.
I sat with my popcorn,
out lookin' for good times
Lost in the cartoon,
I grabbed the lifeline.

I've been a searcher,
I've been a fool,
But I've been a long time
comin' to you.
I'm hopin' for your love
to carry me through
You're holdin' my baby,
and I'm holdin' you,
And it's all right.

Oh, tell me where
the answer lies.
Is it in the notebook
behind your eyes
When your decision
comes to view,
I'll be watchin' my TV,
and it'll be watchin' you.

I've been a searcher,
I've been a fool,
But I've been a long time
comin' to you.
I'm hopin' for your love
to carry me through
You're holdin' my baby,
and I'm holdin' you,
Yes I am.

Speakin' out.
