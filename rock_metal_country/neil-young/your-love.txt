Your love is good to me
I should be standing tall
And walking proud
Your eyes keep looking out
And your heart keeps beatin' on
Oh yeah, without your love
I would surely die.

Some night when I'm alone
I get to wonder what's been shown
And your love is like a light
Showing me the way through the night
Oh yeah, without your love
I would surely die.

Your love is good to me
Good to you I try to be
Don't leave me, babe
Yeah, if I get the blues
My love you'll never loose
Don't ever take away your love.
Your love, your love.
Your love, your love.
