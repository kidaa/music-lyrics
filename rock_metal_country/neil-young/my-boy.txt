Oh, you'd better take your time.
Why are you growin' up so fast

My boy.
Oh, you'd better take your time.
Almost time to make some plans
My son.

Oh, you'd better take your time
My boy.

Why are you growin' up so fast
My son

Vacation gone, school is out,
Summer ends year in year out.

Why are you growin' up so fast
