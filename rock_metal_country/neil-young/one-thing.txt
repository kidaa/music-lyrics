When I try
to tell you one thing
You don't listen
When I try
to tell you one thing
You don't care.

I think we're
headed for a heartache
That's my suspicion
I think we're
headed for a heartache
That's how I feel.

And I don't want
The silent treatment
And I don't need
To feel the chill.

You know a body feels empty
With no love inside
Yeah, a body feels empty
With no love at all.

I think we're
headed for a heartache
That's my suspicion
I think we're
headed for a heartache
That's how I feel.

One of these days
You're gonna wake up
and I'll be gone
You'll open your eyes
And see the truth.

When I try
to tell you one thing
You don't listen
When I try
to tell you one thing baby
You don't care.
