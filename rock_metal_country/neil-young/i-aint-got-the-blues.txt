Well, I'm a little light-headed
But my body feels the same
And it feels like fallin' on down
And find another name
But the sand in my shoes
May trickle to my brain
Well, I ain't got the blues
But something more tame
Oh yeah, something more tame
Oh yeah, something more tame.

Well the sound of the drums
Is pounding in my head
Like ten thousand dancers
With bodies full of lead
And I feel like a bull
With an eye-full of red
Well, I ain't got the blues
But something better bred
Oh yeah, something better bred
Oh yeah, something better bred.

If tomorrow sees another
Kind of farm I know
Well, the people and the soldiers
And the gypsies groan
It would be like a wonder
And I cannot let it go
Well, I ain't got the blues
But something more slow
Oh yeah, something more slow
Oh yeah, something more slow.

But the people in the cities
And the other ones too
Ain't got too many wonders
That they're not tied to
And I can't help but feeling
As I'm wearing straight through
Well, I ain't got the blues
But something more true
Oh yeah, something more true
Oh yeah, something more true.
