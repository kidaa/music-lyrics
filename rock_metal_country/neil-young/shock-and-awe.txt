Back in the days of shock and awe 
We came to liberate them all 
History was the cruel judge of overconfidence 
Back in the days of shock and awe 

Back in the days of "mission accomplished" 
Our chief was landing on the deck 
The sun was setting on a golden photo op 
Back in the days of "mission accomplished" 

Thousands of bodies in the ground 
Brought home in boxes to a trumpet's sound 
No one sees them coming home that way 
Thousands buried in the ground 

Thousands of children scarred for life 
Millions of tears for a soldier's wife 
Both sides are losing now 
Heaven takes them in 
Thousands of children scarred for life 

We had a chance to change our mind 
But somehow wisdom was hard to find 
We went with what we knew and now we can't go back 
But we had a chance to change our mind.
