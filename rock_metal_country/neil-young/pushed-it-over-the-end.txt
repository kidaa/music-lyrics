Good lookin' Milly's got
a gun in her hand
But she don't know how to use it.
Sooner or later she'll
have to take a stand
And she ain't about to lose it.
All the towns people gather around
They've come to see
what's going down
Although no one hears a sound
There's another poor man
falling down.
Falling down, falling down.
Falling down, falling down.

On this noisy shore
Standing at the edge of you.
Could those dreams of yours be true
Or did you, did you, did you
Pushed it over the end
How much time did you spend
Pushed it over the end.

Good lookin' Milly's
into politics now
And things are looking much better
She keeps ten men in her garage
Knitting her fine sweaters.
At the end of a weary day
She feels hard and she looks hard.
Although no one hears a sound
There's another poor man
falling down.
Falling down, falling down.
Falling down, falling down.

I came back for more
And found you waiting at the door
And far inside your walls
I called
Did you, did you, did you
Pushed it over the end
How much time did you spend
Pushed it over the end.

How much love did you spend
Pushed it over the end.
