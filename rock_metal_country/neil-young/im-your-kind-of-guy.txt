Baby,
Why don't you be my girl
I'll give it a try,
Cause I'm your kind of guy.

I said, baby,
Why don't you be my girl
I'll give it a try,
Cause I'm your kind of guy.

I'll send you flowers
every day girl,
If you will promise to be mine,
forever more.
And if you say
the words I long to hear,
You know how happy I'll be.

So baby,
Why don't you be my girl
I'll give it a try,
Cause I'm your kind of guy.
