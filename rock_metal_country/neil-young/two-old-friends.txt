Preacher went up to the Golden Gate,
And met God there,
With the glow of love in his flowing hair.

I'm dreamin' of a time when love and music,
Is everywhere.
Can you see that time comin'

No my son that time has gone,
There's things to do.
The world has changed since I first met you.

Back when The Band played Rock of Ages,
In their prime,
And the old juke joint was rockin'...

Oh Lord there's so much hate,
In a world where we're from another place.
Show me how to be like you.
See no evil, hear no evil,
Feel no evil in my heart.

In my heart, in my aching heart.
In my heart, in my heart,
In my old black heart.
In my heart, in my heart,
In my beating heart.

Sky had turned a lotta shades of gray,
As they walked on,
And a gentle rain fell down on them.

They found faith in the way things are and,
The way things change,
And they said goodbye like two old friends.

Take me up to the mountains high,
Or a building top where the spirits fly.
Show me how to be like you.
See no evil, feel no evil,
Fear no evil in my heart.

In my heart, in my aching heart.
In my heart, in my heart,
In my old black heart.
In my heart, in my heart,
In my beating heart.

Oh Lord there's so much hate,
In a world where we're from another place.
Show me how to live like you.
See no evil, hear no evil,
Feel no evil in my heart.

In my heart, in my aching heart.
In my heart, in my heart,
In my old black heart.
In my heart, in my heart,
In my beating heart.
