There's plenty of food
on the table
Lots of love in the house
The children all do what
they're able to do
We got so much to be happy about.

I got a woman standing beside me
She really knows
how to stand by her man
She's strong and she's soft
and she's honest to me
She really helps me
to be a good man.

But nothing is perfect
in God's perfect plan
Look in the shadow to see
He only gave us the good things
so we'd understand
What life without them would be.

There's plenty of wheat
on the prairies
Lots of coal in the mines
We got soldiers so strong
they can bury their dead
And still not go back
shooting blind.

There's women and men
on the workforce
Doing forty hours
plus overtime
So the hostages
held at the airport
Can come home
to something worthwhile.

But nothing is perfect
in God's perfect plan
Look in the shadow to see
He only gave us the good things
so we'd understand
What life without them would be.

And there's plenty of food
on the table
Lots of love in the house
The children all do
what they're able to do
We got so much to be happy about.

I got a woman standing beside me
She really knows
how to stand by her man
She's strong and she's soft
and she's honest to me
It  really helps me
to be a good man.

But nothing is perfect
in God's perfect plan
He only gave us the good things
so we'd understand.
No, nothing is perfect
in God's perfect plan.
