I've got the love art blues
Don't know which one to choose
There's really something to lose,
With these love art blues.

I went and played too hard,
And I lost my mind.,
Oh, these love art blues
Leave me a heavy one.

My songs are all so long
And my words are all so sad
Why must I choose
Between the best things I ever had.

I spilled my promise cup
I really don't know why
Now the distance lies
Between you and I.

My songs are all so long
And my words are all so sad
Why must I choose
Between the best things I ever had.

I've got the love art blues
Don't know which one to choose
There's really something to lose,
With these love art blues.

I went and played too hard.
