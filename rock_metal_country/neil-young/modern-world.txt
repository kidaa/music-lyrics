We live in a modern world
With communication
between boy and girl
Oh Yeah
But under the stars above
We just don't recognise 
the power of love is free

We gotta change
We gotta change
We gotta change how we feel
We gotta change
We gotta change

When anger has closed the door
My eyes go blind
and I can see inside
I hurt you and you hurt me
With crimes of love
in the first degree
Oh yeah

We gotta change
We gotta change
We gotta change how we feel
We gotta change
We gotta change

We live in a modern world
With communication
between boy and girl
oh yeah
but when there are clouds above
We just don't recognise 
the power of love is free

We gotta change
We gotta change
We gotta change how we feel
We gotta change
We gotta change
