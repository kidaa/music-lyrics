Pretty Maui Mama
Lying over the water
With my sun in your eyes
When you hear the melody play
It changes every day
Oh, Hawaiian sunrise

Once when we were there
We had relaxing times,
Thought we might settle down.
But the music called me
And my friends have
much to spread around,
We moved from town to town.
Hawaiian sunrise.

And in the morning when you rise,
Will you look in my son's eyes
I know you do.

Pretty Maui Mama
Lying over the water
With my moon in your eyes
From my hotel window in the clouds
I love you right out loud.
Ohm Hawaiian sunrise.

And in the morning when you rise,
Will you look in my son's eyes
I know you do.
