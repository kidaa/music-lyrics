The evening fog was rolling in
It was getting hard to see
The old white car edged down the road
Headed for the double e

She was bringin' down dinner for grandpa
It was crawlin' with vitamins
And tender as a mother's love
When she saw the tv vans

The side door was open
There were three tvs
Grandpa's face was on every one
He was talkin' to a woman with a microphone
She was sexy and her hair was all done

Sun green came out and met grandma then
"my, you're such a beautiful girl
Mother earth needs more like you
You should go out now and see the world

What's grandpa doin' on tv?
I got his dinner in the car
All these vans have blocked our road
But we can carry it, it's not too far"
