Come on, baby, let's go downtown,
Let's go, let's go,
let's go downtown.
Come on, baby, let's go downtown,
Let's go, let's go,
let's go downtown.

Walk on, talk on,
baby tell no lies.
Don't you be caught
with a tear in your eye.

Sure enough,
they'll be sellin' stuff
When the moon begins to rise.
Pretty bad when
you're dealin' with the man,
And the light shines in your eyes.

Come on, baby, let's go downtown,
Let's go, let's go,
let's go downtown.
Come on, baby, let's go downtown,
Let's go, let's go,
let's go downtown.

Snake eyes, French fries
and I got lots of gas.
Full moon and a jumpin' tune,
now you don't have to ask.

Sure enough,
they'll be sellin' stuff
When the moon begins to rise.
Pretty bad when
you're dealin' with the man,
And the light shines in your eyes.

Come on, baby, let's go downtown,
Let's go, let's go,
let's go downtown.
Come on, baby, let's go downtown,
Let's go, let's go,
let's go downtown.

Walk on, talk on,
baby tell no lies.
Don't you be caught
with a tear in your eye.

Sure enough,
they'll be sellin' stuff
When the moon begins to rise.
Pretty bad when
you're dealin' with the man,
And the light shines in your eyes.

Pretty bad when
you're dealin' with the man,
And the light shines in your eyes.
