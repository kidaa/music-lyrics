Wake up all you sleeping beauties
More are being born while you rest
They're pipin' music in
We all have to sin
Someday
We all have to sin
Someday.

Rommel wore a ring on his finger
He only took it off
when he flew his plane
Once he told me why
He said we all have to fly
Someday
We all have to fly
Someday.

The T.V. preacher can't be bothered
With those petty things
He stays a step removed so they say
He's pipin' music in
We all have to sin
Someday
We all have to sin
Someday.

Workin' on that great Alaska pipeline
Many men were lost in the pipe
They went to fuelin' cars
How smog might turn to stars
Someday
Smog might turn to stars
Someday.

Hold me baby, put your arms around me
Give me all the love you have to give
Tomorrow won't be late
We won't have to wait
Someday
We won't have to wait
Someday.
