I just can't seem to get movin'
Love me enough to begin
And I'll never forget you
I hope that you care
More than a little for me
It's so hard to wait.

If I should stand and stare
Don't be alarmed at me
It's so hard to wait.

I just can't seem to get movin'
Love me enough to begin
And I'll never forget you.
