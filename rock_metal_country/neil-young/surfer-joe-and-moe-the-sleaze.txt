Here's a story about Surfer Joe
He caught the big one,
but he let it go
There's somebody satisfied
with winning.

Back on the boardwalk
there's Moe the Sleaze
Sells good things
and aims to please
He's almost even but
he doesn't mind a handout.

Come on down
for a pleasure cruise
We're all going
on a pleasure cruise
Come on down
for a pleasure cruise
Plenty of women,
plenty of booze.

Give your ticket
to Moe the Sleaze
He's the one that's
weak in the knees
His pants are baggy,
but you can see them shaking.

I'll introduce you to Surfer Joe
He may be there,
I really don't know
We can smoke garfong
and watch him ride
the big one.

Come on down
for a pleasure cruise
We're all going
on a pleasure cruise
Come on down
for a pleasure cruise
Plenty of women,
plenty of booze.

Come on down, come on down
Come on down, come on.

Here's a story about Surfer Joe
He caught the big one,
and he let it go
There's somebody satisfied

He's somebody.
