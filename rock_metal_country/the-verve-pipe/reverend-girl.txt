We are for today 
We are for the moment 

We are a crusade 
But we are invalid 

1 am rummaging 
Stained my hands on her antique 
2 am 

Reverend girl 

I am so indifferent 
I am whatever 

3 am cellophane 
Suffocates my favorite things 
4 am 

The reverend girl 
Seems that the more we're achieving, the less chance of leaving this world 
With a reverend girl 

Another lover wakes me 
Head upon a window pane 
Before the thunder shook us 
She could always smell the rain 

A year is dissipating 
Another hail cannot disdain 
Never mind the thunder 
Now my lover smells like 
Now my lover smells like 
Now my lover smells like rain
