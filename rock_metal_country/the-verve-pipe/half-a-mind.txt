Sometimes I wish we had a short term memory just enough to recognize each other's face 
It would be the same old stories but you're hanging onto every single word I have to say 
And to the world I'm not that clever but you would stay with me forever 
I'd keep your friends from reminding, reminding you to 

Save yourself, leave me behind you would if you had half a mind 
I'd tell you every day's your birthday and every gift I bring could be the same 
Or how I stood beside you at a shotgun wedding and the child we once would love but never came 
Hearing stories that were never you would stay with me forever 

But I'd forget to make money and you'd forget to 

Save yourself, leave me behind you would if you had half a mind how vulnerable you are 
Write a note to remind you you would if you had half a mind how effortless to stay together 

For these ties you may have severed now you'll stay with me forever 

And so you write on your forehead, or better yet you engrave 
So when you look in the mirror, well you won't forget to 

Save yourself, leave me behind you would if you had half a mind how vulnerable you are 
Write a note to remind you you would if you had half a mind how effortless to stay together 

If we had no memory whatsoever we would stay right here forever
