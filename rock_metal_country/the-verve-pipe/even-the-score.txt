I wish that I could give breath 
To the women I've created 
In paragraphs and paragraphs 
I've written to this date 
And set them all upon my desk, choose one to ignore 
Just to even the score 

All the biggest plays I missed 
'Cause I was sitting over on the sidelines 
All the precious faces that 
Refused to date someone outside the guidelines 

Well, high school begins with worship for the leisure class 
You swear you'll overcome it 
But your envy doesn't seem to pass 
How similar the shopping but at different stores 
We've got to even the score 

Repeat chorus twice
