I've got to get arrested to keep you interested 
I should have known that I can't change the world by staring at it 
My arms have little feeling from lifting to the ceiling 
A recipe for stealing hearts I have no power in healing 

And I suppose the Jesus pose is tired and superficial, lame 
I wrote a song, I'm moving on, I'm praying you can do the same 

I'm changing my direction making a correction 
Oh my god, I've dodged the unexpected bullets behind accolades and 
Shake your head of leisure get your head and body into seizure 
And battle with whoever hides assault disguised as dancing 

This rotting phase of hands that raise, bumping heads that pass each other 
It's a boring phase, so part the wave and drop the dead as driftwood surfer 

Another song, it all went wrong, the radio refused to play it 
I'm not afraid to serenade, the f word saved and sucked the life from me 

I've got to get arrested to keep you interested
