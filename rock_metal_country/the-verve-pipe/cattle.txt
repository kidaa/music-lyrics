Boy there was a day an assortment of rhymes 
And waving, we rode that parade for awhile 
And everybody knew everybody 

Boy there was a day being lonely was hard 
And then your attention was never enough 

I don't really know anybody in love 
I don't want to know anybody in love 

And when the mouth is open grows a cancer everybody wins 
Round and round and settle down, settle down 

Brand the herd of those who duplicate 
And crush the wind of those who deviate 
And ride the wave along the mitigated mile 
Ride the wave along the mitigated mile
