Blackmore/Glover/Turner
Take good care it's a tightrope ride
neon city is on the dreamers' side
prime time losers going underground
they take you up and they shake you down

can't see nowhere
don't know, and I don't care
'cos here comes another midtown tunnel vision

Sidewalk cruiser in stiletto heels
frozen heart, eyes of steel
wrap your body around my soul
electric love is gonna take its' tollcan't see nowhere
don't know and I just don't care
that girl is the mother of my midtown tunnel vision

Sunset skyline night turns to day
down on the street you could fade away
no second chances in this here wasted life
it'll cut you down like a switchblade knife

can't see nowhere
don't know and I just don't care
