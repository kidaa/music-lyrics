Smith/McCarty
Version 1 From Stranger in Us All

See the stars come fallin' down the sky 
Gently passing, they kiss your tear drops dry
See the wind come, softly blow
Your hair from your face
And the rain comes falling down
In its crazy way
Still I'm sad

For myself my tears just fall in the dust
As I search in the night and find they're lost
See the wind come gently blow
Time into my heart
And the rain comes falling down
While we're apart
Still I'm sad

Version 2 Yardbirds' version?See the stars come joining down from the skies
Gently passing they kiss your tears when you cry
See the wind of summer blow your hair upon your head
See the rain, the falling rain, it's rain 
Still I'm sad

Oh my flowers, my tears are falling two days
They are driving the night profound, they are lost
Flower, flower the wind is blowing
Time into my heart
When the wind blows hard, we are apart
Still I'm sad

Oh, oh, oh, oh, Still I'm sad
Oh, oh, oh, oh, How I'm sad
