Can't forget his face, what a lonely place
Has he really let us go

All the time that's lost
What's the final cost, will I really get away
All my life it seems just a crazy dream Refrain
Reaching for somebody's star
Can't believe it all, did he really fall

What to do now I don't know
Something is called me back
There's a light in the black
And I ready to go

I'm coming home breather the air before
Heard the thunder roar, never knew it was for me
Always looking down, lost and never found
Eyes that looked but not to see
All my life it seems just a crazy dream
Reaching for somebody's star
Like and open door, that you're passed before
But you've never had the key
Something's calling me back
Like a light in the black
Am I ready to go

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm going back to my home
I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm coming back
Won't forget his face, what a lonely place
Did he really let us goRefrain

What to do now, well, I know
Something's calling me back
Like a light in the black
Yes, I'm ready to go
I'm here to stay
Here i will stay, I'll stay, I'll stay
