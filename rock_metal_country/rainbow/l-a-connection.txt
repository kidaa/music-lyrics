Blackmore / Dio
Carry home my broken bones and lay me down to rest
Forty days of cries and moans I guess
I've failed to pass the test
I've been sent away not a thing to say
I'm banished from the fold
I'm a fallen angel who's lost his wings
And left out in the cold

Chorus:

Ooooh L. A. Connection
Oh L. A. Connection
L. A. Connection

Operator place a call keep a secret put it through
Investigator knows it all he's at the window I wonder who
I've got to cut the line and let me drift
Find a haven in the storm
I got no time I need a lift to where
It's sweet and close and warm

Chorus:


Carry home my broken bones and lay me down to rest
Forty days of cries and moans well
I've just failed test
Feel I'm balanced on the brim should I lean another way
Like a flame that's going on the dim
Needs blessing from the day

Chorus:

Ooooh L. A. Connection
Oh take me away I got nothing to say
It's got to be an L. A. Connection
L. A. Connection

Chorus:
