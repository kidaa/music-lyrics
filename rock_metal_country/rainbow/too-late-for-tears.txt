Blackmore/White/Regan
Well I'm moving faster close to the edge
As I smoka a pack of strong cigarettes
When my fears run dry, you won't see me cry
Coz I know I got it coming
We touched the sun and went on our way
And we asked the stars to come out to play
But you said good night when they lost their light
And my world stopped spinning `round
What are we fighting for
Dontcha know that no one wins
What are we fighting for
Just give up and I'll give in
It's too late for tears
When the things you need are things you don't want
And you take the needle right to the point
I'd be heaven bound, but you shoot me down
Leave me broke and bleeding on the killing floor
