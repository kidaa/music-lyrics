Everybody's sayin' that the times are gettin' rough
You gotta stay loose baby and you gotta be tough... oh
I get knocked down... get right back up again
Cause I never give up and I never give in...
Oh - so strong...
Got the power when I turn it on
Yeah - I'm gonna get my fill
Nothin's gonna stop me now and nothin' ever will
I got the... power
I got the power
I feel the power...
And don't forget it

More some, break some ain't no big surprise
They're gonna wheel ya, deal ya, tell ya all the lies... realize
But I'm a hot shot, shoot em down let em be that's me
Cause I got nothin' for nothin' and nothin's ever free... no
Oh - so strong
All I gotta do is turn it on
Yeah - I'm gonna get my fill
Nothin's gonna stop me now and nothin' ever will
I got the power
Oh, I got the power
I can feel the power
I got the power
Yeah yeah yeah... turn it on

I can take anything that gets in my way
I don't worry 'bout tomorrow I just live for today...
Oh - so strong
Got the feeling when I turn it on
Yeah - I'm gonna get my fill
Nothin's gonna stop me now and nothin' ever will
I got the power
I can feel the power power
I can feel the power...
Turn it on...
Power can you feel it
Power
You can turn it on, turn it on, switch it on behind
Super charged... I can feel the power
