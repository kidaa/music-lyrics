Blackmore/Turner
Rough and ready rider
In a super sonic sound machine
Rock and roll survivor
Chrome pipes between your knees
Running all the red lites
Riding the white lines
Your gonna make a dead stop
But you just can't see the signs
Oh - you'll never win the race
But you can't give up the chase.

Death alley driver
Livin' at high speed
Death alley driver... Yeah
Death alley driver... who knows what you need
Death Alley Driver...One hundred twenty five smokin on the turns
Always on the hit and run
But you never learn...
Running from the man... and you're running
From yourself
Another dirty angel heading straight to hell
Oh - you'll never win the race...
But you won't give up the chase...
Death Alley Driver...
Life in overdrive... Death Alley Driver.. yeah
Death Alley Driver... ride to stay alive
Death Alley Driver... let's go

Red lights in the mirror
Danger on the band...
Got to take a detour cause a road block's up ahead
He takes you on the corner with a wave of his hand
Death is in the back seat of a big old black sedan
Oh - you'll never win the race...
As you turn and see his face...
Death Alley Driver...
Movin' for the kill
Death Alley Driver... yeah
Death Alley Driver...
Time is standing still...
Death Alley Driver...
Always on the run cause you're a ...
Death Alley Driver
Love the way it feels...
Death Alley Driver... yeah
Death Alley Driver
Hell on wheels...
Death Alley Driver... ooh
