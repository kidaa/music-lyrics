If I'm high on a hill
She will still be booking down at me
What does she see
That brings her closer every day to my heart
If I'm away from home and think I'm all alone
She's there somewhere , I look around to see
And looking back at me, she's there beware
Creeping like a hungry cat

Seen it before Refrain 1
And I know it can wean that

The lady's starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck
The lady's starstruck running after me Refrain 2
The lady's starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck, yeah, yeah

I could fly to the moon
But she'd soon find a way to be there
I never knew for a while
That a smile made them really care

She wants a souvenir
To everyone it's clear
She's hooked one look
She wants a photograph Refrain 3
And everybody laughs
But not me 'cause I see

Refrain 2

Refrain 1

It used to be a game
Now I can;t repeat my name at all
She seems to believe that
I never can refuse her call

Refrain 3

Refrain 2

Refrain 1

And back of tree I'm looking back at me
Blind and, off my stare, I've just got to be ware
The lady's starstruck, yes, she'd bad luck, bad luck
