I ain't lyin' to you baby... I hope you don't refuse
But I'm red hot... Ready or not... to give my love to you
I don't have forever, but I got tonight
The look in your eye said you'll give it a try...
I know the moment's right
Ooh -- give it to me... you got everything I need
Ooh -- do it to me... Bring me to my knees...
When you gimme that Tite Squeeze...
Baby, baby please...
Gimme that Tite Squeeze...

When you start to touch me... I can't believe it's real
You make it hard for me to take, I love the way you feel
I'm hungry for you baby, I just can't get enough...
If it's alright I'll take bite, I'll taste your love
Ooh - give it to me... you got everything I need
Ooh - do it to me... bring me to my knees...
When you gimme that Tite Squeeze -
Gimme the tite squeeze - yeah
Rock me in your cradle, roll me like the dice
Do it to me and I'll do it to you, do it till we do it right
Don't tell me that you love me, when you walk out the door
Cause I'll hold you down, turn you around, I'll come back for more
Ooh - give it to me... you got everything I need
Ooh - do it to me... bring me to my knees...
When you gimme that Tite, Tite, Tite yeah...
Gimme that Tite Squeeze, ooh baby, gimme that Tite squeeze
Oh - bring me to my knees, gimme that Tite squeeze
