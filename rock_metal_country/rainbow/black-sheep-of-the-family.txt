Hammond
I got nothing in my head
Got a floor for a bed
The future's at the bottom of a tea cup
I got a half a pair of shoes
And no time to lose
I'm wondering when I'm going to wise up
So Fortune shine your light on me and my clothes
Cause we need some security
You get a little bad luck
And it grows and it grows

I'm the black sheep of the family
I've got half a pound of rice
A beard full of lice
A mission called retrogression
I got pocket full of dust
And eating is a must

You want to make a good impression
So Fortune shine your light on me and my dog
Cause we need some security
While all the folks are living high up the hillI'm the black sheep of the family
Don't talk to me about society
You got to play the rules
Or pay the penalty
Because a hand full of blues
Double indemnity
The hour was gone
And my shadow's getting long
My real life's a song on me
But I've got an ache in my head
I want to go to bed
Tomorrow I don't have to wake up

So Wisdom shine your light on me and my knees

Cause it's true what they say about familiarity 
There's nothing good this way |x2 times
And it's true what they say |
I'm the black sheep of the family /
