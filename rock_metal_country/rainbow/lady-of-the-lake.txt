Blackmore / Dio
There's a magical sound sliding over the ground
Making it shiver and shake Refrain 1
And a permanent cry falling out to the sky
Slippery and sly like a snake

With a delicate move kind of shifty and smooth
A shadow has covered light Refrain 2
Then e beam in the shade from a silvery blade
Has shattered the edge of the night

Chorus:

I know she waits below
Only to rise on command
When she comes for me
She's got my life in her hands

When a movement behind hit the side of my mind
I trembled and shook it away
Then another assault and I started to faulter
Fibres of steel turned to clay

With a bubbly turn now the water should churn
And push it way from the core
And a lady in white will bring sun the night
Brighter than ever before

Chorus:Lady of the lake

Refrain 1

Refrain 2

Chorus:

Straight down I'm swirling around
Blinded and bruised by the strain
There must be some way to see
Diamonds out of the rain

Chorus:

Lady of the lake
