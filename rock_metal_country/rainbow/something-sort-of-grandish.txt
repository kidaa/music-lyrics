Something sweet,
Something sort of grandish
Sweeps my soul
When thou art near.
My heart feels so sugar candish
My hand feels so ginger beer.
Something so dareish
So I don't careish,
Stirs me from limb to limb.
It's so terrifish, magnifish, delish.
To have such an amorish glamorish.
We could be oh, so bride and groomish
Skies could be so bluish blue.
Life could be so love in bloomish,
If my ishes could come true.

Thou art sweet, 
Thou art sort of grandish,
Thou outlandish cavalier.
Fromnow on, we're hand in handish
Romeo and Guinevere
Thou'rt so adorish
Toujours l'amourish.
I'm so cherchez la femme.
Why should I vanquish,
Relinquish, resish,
When I simply relish this swellish condish.
I might be manishish or mouseish
I might be a fowl or fish,
But with thee I'm Eisenhowzish.
Please accept my propasish
You're under my skinish,
So please be give-inish
Or it's the beginish of the finish of me.
