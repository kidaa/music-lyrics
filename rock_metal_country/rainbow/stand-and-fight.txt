Blackmore/White
Can't say something if the words ain't there
What you trying to do
Money can't buy me out of trouble I'm in
I've been messing with the likes of you
Been so long since I left my home
Looks like I lost my way
Tried so hard just to make it work
You just turn around and walk away
Something's got to give, I ain't gonna leave
Time to dig down deep
If you wanna get out of this town alive
You gotta stand and fight
So infuriating the way you twist my words
I know you got your problems, it seems every day
That they're getting much worse
I hear you screaming for attention
You say your life's a mess
Something else to cry about
Just get on with it
Something's got to give, I ain't gonna leave
Time to dig down deep
If you wanna get out of this town alive
