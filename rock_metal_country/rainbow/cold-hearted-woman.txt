Blackmore/White
She came from across the water
A devil's daughter was in disguise
I crid for mercy - she bound and chained me
and then she played me, I was mesmerized
When she gave me blood red roses
They were wrapped in razor thorns
She was sly in her temptation
Then she left me on my own
Sutch a cold hearted woman
She promised passion everlasting
And now I'm haunted by her name
I gave up all that I ever cared for
Oh if I only had my yesterdays again
I've been blinded, now I'm broken
Sometimes I can hear her song
No man's grass was ever greener
Now I find that I don't belong
With a cold hearted woman
She touched my world and I was shaken
But she was fakin,'I never knew
These days are colder and there's no shoulder
I'm just the shell fo the man I was before
If there's somewhere I can run to
Till I kill the pain inside
I've been walking now for hours
Can't forget her, the Lord knows I've tried
