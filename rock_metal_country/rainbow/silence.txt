Blackmore/White
You say you want your freedom
It all gets a bit out of hand
Caught in the ocean as I'm watching you breathe
We all believe what we wanted to belive
That's the silence of love
You say all you want is money
You scream for a little bit more
Caught in a landslide as we're stumbling on
Who'd say we're right but who would say we're wrong
Silence of love
You say you need someone to hold you
You say that you're feeling afraid
I know the worst part of being alone
Is a book full of nombers with no one to phone
That's the silence of love
