The Lord made Adam.
The Lord made Eve.
He made them both,
A little bit naf.

They lived as free
As the summer breeze,
Without pajamas and without chemise.

Until they stumbled
on the apple trees.

Then she looked at him,
hum, hum
And he looked at her,
hum, hum

What the world was for...

- He said give me my cane
- He sais give me my hat.
- The time has gone,
to begin the begat.
- The begat!
- The begat!
- That's it!

So they begat Caine.
And they begat Abel,
Who begat the rablle
At the Tow'r of Babel.

They begat the Cohens,
And they begat O'Rourkes.
And they begat the people
Who believed in stars.

- Holly Lordy, how they did begat!
-How they did begat!
- ??? morning that

When the begat got
to gettin' under par
They begat the daughters
of the big A. R.

They begat the babes
of the bourgeoisie,
Who begat the missbegat in G.O.P.

You was a pleased new Jezebel
a pleased new Ruth.
And pleased the League of Women Shoppers
in Deluth.

Thou the movie censors
tried the facts a hide
the movie goers open up multiplied.

- Holly Lordy, how they multiplied!
- How they multiplied!
- How they multiplied!

Soon it swept the world
Ev'ry land and lingo.
It becanme the rage.
It was bigger than bingo.

The white begat, the red begat,
The folks who should stood in bed begat.
The Greeks begat, the Sweeds begat
Why, even Britishers in tweeds, begat.

And Lord in love
What the seas begat.

The Lats and Lithuanians, begat.
The sweeten Pennsylvanians, begat .
Strictly vegetarians, begat.
And honorarium Aryans, begat.
Startin' the Genesis, may begat.
Heroes and nemesis, begat
Fat Phila-busterers, begat.
To vetuler unnatelor to begat.
And sometimes a bachelor, he begats!
And didn't matter in witch ways they begats,
Son of a beach ways, begat. 

Oh! Bless them Lord!
Who know do that,
And He the first
of no begat!

Alternative: last verse according to the movie

Oh! Bless Them all!
Who go to bed.
And its the cause
Of the begat!
