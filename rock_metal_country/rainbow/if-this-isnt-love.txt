If this isn't love
The whole world is crazy
If this isn't love
I'm daft as a daisy
With moons all around
And cows jumping over
There's something a-miss,
And I'll eat my hat if
If this isn't love!
I'm feeling like the apple
On the top of William Tell;
With this I cannot grapple because,
Because you're so adorabelle
If this isn't love
The winter is summer
If this isn't love
My heart needs a plumber
I'm swingin' on the stars
I'm ridin' on rainbows
I'm bustin' with bliss,
And I'll kiss your hand
If this isn't love!
