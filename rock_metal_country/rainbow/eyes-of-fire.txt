Blackmore/Turner/Rondinelli
Hungry and wild she was born to the night
A demon, a daughter or madness
One look from her eyes could burn you alive...
Drown you in oceans of sadness
Oh - even the deadly shades of night
Won't let me hide...from her eyes of fire

Face in the mirror we meet eye to eye
Passions of eternal fire
Desperately wanting and out of control
Dancing on winds of desire
Oh - even the deadly shades of night
Won't let me hide...from her eyes of fire

Curtain of darkness, screams of delight
Taunts me with her sirens calling...
I got to be strong but I can't hang on
Into the flames I am falling...
Oh - even the deadly shades of night
Won't let me hide no, no, no, no
from her eyes of fire...

She keeps burning...
She keeps burning me, burning me, burning me, burning me down
Eyes of fire
