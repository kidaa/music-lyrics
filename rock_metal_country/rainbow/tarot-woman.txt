I don't wanna go
Something tells me no, no, no, no
But traces in the sand
The lines inside my hand say go } 3 times

Beware of a place
A smile on a bright face Refrain
I'll never return, how do you know
Tarot woman, I don't know, I don't know

She can take you there
The entrance to the fair, my, my, my
Ride the carousel
Cast a music spell, you can fly, flyRefrain

Something in the air
Tells me to beware, no, no, no
Her love is like a knife
She'll carve away your life, so go, so go

Refrain
