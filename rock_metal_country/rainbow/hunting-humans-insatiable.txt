Blackmore/White
Justify, speak the lies, close your eyes
As we make love
Touch my skin, let the fun begin, once again
I hear your cries, rise oh rise
Feel the nails, tell tales trails across my spine
Beautiful
Silken kiss, on a night like this, who would miss
Our final hour
Closer still, close your eyes, see my world, it's animal
Insatiable
Velvet glove, unrequited love, find the words
And make them rhyme
One last dance, hypnotizing trance, a knowing glance
I love you
Closer still, lose your will, see my world, it's criminal
Insatiable
Things we hide, keep them out of signt, heard it said
It's unbearable
Feel my pain, taste my shame, who's to blame
Inexcusable
