Woody-
Sharon, where is Glocca Morra?
Sharon-
Well, it's not on the map, Woody. It's just a far off place, in father's heart.

So to ev'ry weepin' willow,
To each brook along the way,
To each lad that comes awistlin'
Tooralay.
Company-
Tooralay.

Ensemble-
May we meet
in Glocca Morra
one fine day.
