Sharon- 
When de idle poor
Become the idle rich
You'll never know
just who is who
or who is witch.
Won't it be rich
Whenever wants poor relatives,
becomes a "Rockefellative",
and pans no longer itch
What a switch!

Female Ensemble- 
When beyond my permine
And plastic team
How would we do determin
Who's who under me?

Male Ensemble- 
And when all your neighbours
are upper class
- You won't know your 'georges'
from your 'astors'.

Sharon- 
Let's toast a day
The day we drink that drinkin' up
But with a little pinkie up.
Company- The day on witch
The idle poor
Become the idle rich

Sharon-
When a rich man doesn't want to work
He's a bon vivant.
Company- 
Yes, he's a bom vivant.
Sharon-
But when a poor man doesn't want to work,
He's a laughter, he's a lounger
he's a lazier good for nothing
Company-
He's a jerk!

Sharon-
When a rich man looses on a horse
Oh, isn't it disport!
Company-
Oh, isn't it disport!

Sharon-
When a poor man looses on a horse
He's a gambler, he's a spender
He's a low life, he's a reason for divorce!

When a rich man chases after dames
He's a man about town,
A man about town.
But when a poor man chases after dames
He's a bounder, he's a rounder
He's a rotter, and a lot of dirty names!

Company-
You'll never know
just who is witch.
When de idle poor
Become the idle rich.

No one will see
The Irish or the Slavonian
'cause when you're on Park Avenue
Cornelius and Mike
Look alike
