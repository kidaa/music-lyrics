Blackmore / Dio
At the end of the dream
If you know where I mean
When the mist just starts to clear
In a similar way
At the end of today
I could feel the sound of writing on the wall

It cries for you
It's the least that you can do
Like a spiral on the wind
I can hear it screaming in my mind

Chorus:

Long live rock'n'roll } 3 times

In a different time
When the words didn't rhyme
You could never quite be sure
Then on with the change
It was simple but strange
And you knew the feeling seemed to say it all

It cries for you
It's the least that you can do
Like a spiral on the wind
I can hear it screaming in my mindChorus:

Long live rock'n'roll } 3 times

If you suddenly see
What was happened with me
You should spread the word around
And tell everyone here
That it's perfectly clear
They can sail above it all on what they've found

It cries for you
It's the least that you can do
Like a spiral on the wind
I can hear it screaming in my mind

Chorus:

Long live rock'n'roll } 3 times
