Og- Children, if you help me find the little gold crock you can have anything that's made in 
fairyland.

There'll be things plenty for allish
Wondrish toys and magic tricks
Electrish trains and basket ballish
Mintish drops and licorice stick.

Life will be keenish all halloweenish
And jelly beanish too,
With ice-cream, and cakish
And soda to sup.
And no bellyacheish
To wakeish you up.

There will be such delicious dishes
And will end to this daffyish plot.
We will go from wretch to riches.
When we'll find that goldish pot.

There will be chocolate castish
with hot-dogs, and mustish
but cheers! ev'rybodysh
must fastish come trough.
