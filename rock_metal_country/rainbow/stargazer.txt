High, noon, oh, I'd sell my soul for water
Nine years worth of breakin' my back
There's no sun in the shadow of the wizard
See how he glides, why he's lighter than air

Oh, I see his face
Where is your star, is it far, is it far, is it far?
When do you leave?
I believe, yes, I believe
In the heat and the rain with wisp and chains Refrain
Just to see him fly so many die
We built a tower of stone with your flesh and bone
Just to see him fly don't know why
Nowhere do we go

Hot mind moving fast across the desert
We feel that our time has arrived
The world spins while we put his wing together
A tower of stone to take him straight to the skyRefrain

All eyes see the figure of the wizard
As he climbs to the top of the world
No sound as he falls instead of rising
Time standing still then there's no blood on the sand

Oh, I see his face
Where was you star, was it far, was it far?
When did we leave?
We believed, we believed
In that heat and rain with wips and chains
To see him fly so many died
We built a tower of stone without flesh and bone
to see him fly but why
It doesn't rain with all your chains
Did so many die just to see him fly
Look at my flesh and bone, now look, look, look, look
Look at this tower of stone
I see a rainbow rising, look there on the horizon
And I'm coming home, coming home, coming home
Time is standing still
He gave me back, my will, oh, oh, oh, oh
Going home, I'm going home
My eyes are bleeding and my heart is weeping
We still hope, oh
Take my back, he gave me back my will, oh, oh, oh, oh
Going home, I'm going home
My eyes are bleeding and my heart is weeping
Back to my home, oh, oh...
