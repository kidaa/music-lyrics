SubtleBlackmore/Dio/Powell
I'm like a freight train
Feelin' no pain
I never turn back one track
Better step aside

Like a shot gun
I'm really someone
You'll feel my heat wave
Won't save anyone near to me

Chorus:
I'm steel
So come and try to bend me if you can
I don't feel
Before you know it it's over
Get out of my way
I'm street walking

No reputation
You better quick run
Cause I got no time I'll climb
All over you

You need a strong hand
To be a mean man
You've got to think fast
I'll last longer than you could I knowChorus:
I'm steel
So come and try to bend me if you can
I don't feel
Before you know it it's over
Out of my way
I'm street walking

I'm a wild cat
Don't need to prove that
I'm always howlin' prowlin'
Stalkin' my prey

It could be your night
To feel the dog bite
And hear the slashing, crashin'
Tearin' inside of you

Chorus:
I'm steel
So come and try to break me if you can
Like a wheel
About to roll you over
Get out my way
I'm street walkin'
