How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that little brook still leaping there?
Does it still run down to Donny cove?
Through Killybegs, Kilkerry and Kildare?
How are things in Glocca Morra? 
Is that willow tree still weeping there?
Does that laddie lassie with the twinklin' eye
Come whistlin' smilin' by
And does he she walk away,
Sad and dreamy there not to see me there?
So I ask each weepin' willow
And each brook along the way,
And each lad lass that comes a-whistlin' a-sighin'
Tooralay
How are things in Glocca Morra
This fine day?
