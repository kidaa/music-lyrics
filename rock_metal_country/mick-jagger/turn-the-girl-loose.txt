Turn the girl loose! I won't hurt nobody 
Turn the girl loose! Let her speak for herself 
The hounds are on the track, they won't catch nobody 
The hounds are on the track, I don't really care 
Turn the girl loose! I won't touch nobody 
Turn the girl loose! Let her out of your heart 
She's calling out across the lacquered ocean 
She's calling out - hear her cry for help? 

Turn the girl loose! She won't touch nobody 
She ain't your mama. She ain't your sister 
Let her out of your heart 
Turn the girl loose! I won't touch nobody 
She ain't your lover. She ain't your brother 
Let her out of jail 
Just turn that girl loose! I won't hurt nobody. I swear! 
Let her out, let her out 
Let her out, let her out of jail 

You're hanging out and you're sniffing the ground for some new blood 
Don't ever get careless and don't leave the keys in the door 
I found her crying and helpless, we made a quick getaway 
She's here to tell you she don't want to see you no more 

Turn that girl loose! I won't hurt nobody 
Turn the girl loose! Let her speak for herself 
Put her on the rack. Put her in seclusion 
When you turned your back, I got the keys to her heart 
She's calling out across the lacquered ocean 
She's crying, crying out for help 

Turn the girl loose! 
Turn the girl loose! 
Turn the girl loose! 
Let her speak for herself 
Let her speak for herself 
Let her out of your heart
