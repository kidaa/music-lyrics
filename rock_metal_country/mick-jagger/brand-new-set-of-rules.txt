I will be kind won't be so cruel 
I will be sweet I will be true 
The pains of love you'll quickly learn 
Are soon to heat and quick to burn 

I got a brand new set of rules 
Because I am your brand new fool 
I got a brand new set of rules 
I got to learn 

You'll be so proud so proud of me 
You'll see the change so plain to see 
Because of you a brand new start 
Because of you a change of heart 

I got a brand new set of rules 
It's just like I was back in school 
I got a brand new set of rules 
I got to learn 

I'm going to change just mark my words 
You can't believe all that you heard 
All of those lies all of those rumours 
That your friends told you 

And if I'm left upon the shelf 
Cause you belong to someone else 
I've got my brand new set of rules 
Because I am nobody's fool 

I've got a brand new set of rules 
I've got to learn 
I've got to learn 
I've got to learn
