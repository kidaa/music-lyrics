I was born in a war 
So they call me a war baby 
I was born in a war 
And it don't make me war crazy 
And the guns start to roar 
As the fire sweeps the street 
Crazy 

Why can't we walk the road together 
And keep our children safe and sure 

War - War Baby 

And the war made us poor 
Made our future unsure 
Hazy 

Why don't we run this race together 
And keep our children safe and sure 

But the arms race is on 
And the tanks all roll out 
All the guns are in place 
We just wait for the shout 
To arms, to arms 

And the guns start to roar From the ship to the shore 
And the bombs start to fall 
As we crouch in the hall 
as they bust through the breach 
Out on Omaha Beach 

Why don't we run this road together 
Why can't we hope to find a cure 

But the arms race is on 
And the tanks all roll out 
All the guns are in place 
As we wait for the shout 
And the army sweeps on and on 
And the navy sails out 
As we rush to the edge 
As we wait for the shout 
To arms, to arms 

War - War Baby
