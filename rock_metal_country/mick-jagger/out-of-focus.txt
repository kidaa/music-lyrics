I saw a glittering moon 
I saw a beautiful morning 
Shining on the hill 
And I grabbed the cat by the tail 
The future with my finger nails 
But now I live in fear 

It's all out of focus 
It's all, baby, so unclear 
It's all out of focus 
It's all, baby, so unreal 

I saw towering spires, I heard beautiful chimes, I heard them peal 
I saw visions of grace, I saw heavenly place, then it disappeared 

Maybe I lied a little bit too much 
Maybe I cried a little bit too much 
I saw the future just shatter in glass 

It's all out of focus 
It's all, baby, so unclear 
It's all out of focus 
And nothing is revealed 

I was walking on clouds, yeah and talking so proud, 
but I did not hear 
Voices singing so loud, said you're tumbling down, 
to the streets of tears 

It's all out of focus 
It's all, baby, so unclear 
It's all out of focus 
It's all, baby, so unreal 

Sometime I lied a little bit too hard 
Sometime I cried a little bit too hard 
I saw the future just vanish like glass 

It's all out of focus 
It's all, baby, so unclear 
It's all out of focus 
And nothing is revealed
