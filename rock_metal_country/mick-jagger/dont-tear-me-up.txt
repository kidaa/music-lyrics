Life is rich, but it's way too short 
You make a lot of money, but you just want more 
I don't need the pain right here in my heart 
But I hate every minute when we're so far apart 

It was love in a minute, it was love in a flash 
It brings me no pleasure, just a stab in the back 
It brings me no comfort, it brings me no peace 
A weight on my shoulder, it's a fatal disease 

So don't tear me up 
I don't ever wanna see your picture again 
And don't poison my blood 
I don't ever wanna see your face here no more 

Gonna finish it quick, gonna finish it clean 
Don't wanna be bitter. I don't wanna be mean 
I feel like we're driving down a dead-end street 
I've come so far I wanna crash the car 
I wanna land right on my feet 

I said don't tear me up 
I don't ever wanna see your picture again 
I said don't tear me up 
I don't ever wanna see your face here no more 

But I dream of you constantly, you'll be my angel of light 
And in the dark rooms of sleeplessness 
You'll be my lover each night 

Life is a bitch, it's way too short 
Unlike a politician it just can't be bought 
Think about the tenderness, and think about the craziness 
And if you ever wanna hate me come and 
Stick a knife right in my chest 

I said don't tear me up 
I don't ever wanna see your picture again 
I said don't tear me up 
I don't ever wanna see your face here no more 

I said don't tear me up 
I said don't tear me up 
I said don't poison my blood 
I don't ever wanna see your picture again
