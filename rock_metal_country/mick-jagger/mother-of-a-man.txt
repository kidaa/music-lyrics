See looka here, wanna see my gun 
It's an Uzi and it packs a lot of punch 
It sure is loud, I got it fixed 
You wanna feel, you wanna touch this little bitch 

I wanna testify, it's a crazy world out there 
I wanna tell ya now, it's a brutal world out there 

I'm just a mother of a man 
I've got the stopper in my hand 
Judge and jury help me please 
Ain't gonna get down on my knees 
Oh no, god help me now 

You know my wife, she don't feel safe 
Since we had a lot of trouble near our place 
These kids are poor, I know it's hard 
But why'd they have to do it in their own backyard 

I wanna testify, it's a crazy world out there 
I don't know what to tell you, it's a barbaric world out there 

I'm just a mother of a man 
I wanna take the witness stand 
Judge and jury help me please 
The sirens sound, the streets all bleed 
I'm just a mother of a man 
Just a mother of a man 
Oh yeah, God help me now 

I wanna testify, it's a crazy, crazy, crazy world out there 
I wanna tell ya now that it's a barbaric world out there 

I'm just a mother of a man 
I wanna take the witness stand 
Judge and jury help me please 
The sirens sigh, the streets all bleed 

I'm just a mother of a man 
Here I stand, here I stand 
I'm just a mother of a man 
Yeah, God help me now
