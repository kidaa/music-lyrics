And I just don't do things by halves 
So come now please don't make me laugh 
The wicked lay stones in my path 
And friends who are snakes in the grass 
I felt the warmth of you in summer days gone by 
The waves they rock the boat 
You smiled at me and closed your eyes 

I won't bow down, I won't kow tow 
Won't be seen to, won't be lied to 
I won't turn tail, won't be blackmailed by you 

And I can see through you like glass 
So come now please don't make me laugh 

I hear the country church bells ring for you 
I see the church choir rise and sing for you 
But I'll be leaving soon, I'm off at high noon 
I've got a heavy heart, we touch a long past 

I won't bow down, I won't kow tow 
Won't be seen to, won't be lied to 
I won't turn tail, won't be blackmailed 
But if you think of me 
Think something sweet of me 

I look around in rage 
There's nothing left 
There's nothing saved 
Some memories, a photograph 
The future looms, so damn the past 

I don't want you, I don't need you 
I won't bow down, I won't kow tow 
I won't turn tail, I won't be blackmailed 
Won't be seen to, won't be lied to 
Ohh, ooh, ooh
