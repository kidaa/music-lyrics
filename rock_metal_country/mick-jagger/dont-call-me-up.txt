I was trying to forget you
But you won't tell me how
Lately I'm finding it tricky
With your picture plastered all over town
Friends pick you up in conversation
Just to see how I'll react
I get this internal lacerations
That jack me up and lay me out flat

But I can't throw my life away
I can't give the game away
You just wandered off the stage
And left me dealing with the pain

So don't call me up
Oh when you wanna cry
Cos I might let you down
Don't call me up
On some rainy night
Cos I might let you down
Let you down

People ask have you seen her
I say not for a while
I'm gonna see my girlfriend
Way down in Argentina
We're gonna have a blast for a while
But I see you in my inner eye
Touch me with a gentle smile
Wonder if you catch my mood
Can you feel my solitude

So don't call me up
Oh when you wanna cry
Cos I might let you down
Don't call me up
When some other guy
Hangs your heartstrings out to dry

As the waves crash around
And the stars hit the ground
I'll be out of my mind once again
As the rain lashes down
And the stars can't be found
I will hold my head high
Don't call me up [cont]

And just gaze at the sky
I was under your spell
And you took me to hell

Don't call me up
If you wanna cry
I might let you down
Don't call me up
If you want some lie
I might let you down
Might let you down
Might let you down
Might let you down

I was trying to forget you
Yeah
But you won't tell me how
Now you're out all over town
You're plastered all over town
Plastered all over town
