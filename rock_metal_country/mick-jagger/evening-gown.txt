People say that I'm high class 
But I'm low down all the while 
People think That I'm crazy 
When I flash that California smile 

But I can still paint the town 
All the colour of your evening gown 
While I'm waiting for your blonde hair 
To turn grey 

People say I'm a drinker 
But I'm sober half the time 
People say I'm a loser 
But I get lucky on the side 

Yeah but I can still paint the town 
All the colour of your evening gown 
While I'm waiting for your blonde hair 
To turn grey 

All my life I waited for 
Someone who would show where the bliss is 
All my life I waited for 
Someone who would take me past the kissing 

People say I'm a loner 
I like to get lost in the crowds 
People call me a dresser 
I wear my sports clothes way too loud 

Yeah but I can still paint the town 
I can shake it and turn it upside down 
While I'm waiting for your blonde hair 
While I'm waiting for your blonde hair 
While I'm waiting for your blonde hair 
To turn grey
