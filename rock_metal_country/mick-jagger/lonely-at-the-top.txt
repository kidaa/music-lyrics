Lonely
God knows you're ambitious, see you push so hard 
You want to get to the top of the heap from Sunset Boulevard 
Oh, it leads small-town girls astray 
Oh, it leads small-town girls astray 
'Cause it's lonely, lonely at the top 
Baby, it's hot! 
It's lonely, lonely at the top 
Baby, it's hot! 
They're going to tear your soul away 

Theater is deserted and the boards are bare 
You're next up for the reading and you're feeling scared 
Oh, but you really want the part so bad 
Yeah, go on, show them how a star should act 

Yeah, it's lonely, lonely at the top 
Baby, it's hot 
Yeah, it's lonely, lonely at the top 
Baby, it's hot 
They're going to tear your soul away 

You could be a doctor, you could be a nurse 
There's no time to rehearse 
You work as a waitress, you clean up the bar 
But soon you'll be noticed, you'll be a star 

You get your nomination, your heart's beating fast 
Yes, and the winner is you! You won the prize at last 
Oh, it leads small-town girls astray 
Oh, it leads small-town girls astray 

'Cause it's lonely, lonely at the top 
Yeah, baby, it's hot! 
They're going to strip your soul away 
It's lonely, lonely 
It's lonely 
You get hungry, you get thirsty 
You know you get thirsty...
