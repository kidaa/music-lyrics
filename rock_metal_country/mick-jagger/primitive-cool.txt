A place far in the future 
And faces from the past 
And children reading history books 
Their faces light and laugh 
It all seems so primitive 
How did you survive? 
It all seemed so different then 
How did you stay alive? 
Did you walk cool in the fifties daddy? 
Was it black and white? 
Did you play jazz all night? 
Was it really so wonderful? 
Did you walk cool in the fifties daddy? 
Did you dress like James Dean? 
Did you wear dungarees? 
Did you dance to the Rumba? 

Was it all just crazy fashion? 
I said oh yeah 
Did you live life with a passion? 
I said oh yeah 

Does it all have some strange meaning? 
Can it change my life today? 
Or is it all so much flotsam and jetsam? 
Tell me right away 

Did you walk cool in the sixties daddy? 
Did you fight in the war? 
Or did you chase all the whores 
On the rock and roll rumble? 
Did you walk cool in the sixties daddy? 
Did you fight in the war? 
Did you break all the laws 
That were ready to crumble? 

Was it just a crazy fashion? 
I said oh yeah 
Did you live life with a passion? 
I said oh yeah 

Does it have some inner meaning? 
Can it change my life today? 
Or is it all so much flotsam and jetsam? 
Tell me right away 

Well I think you've got it figured 
Go check it out yourself 
Cause I've had it playing teacher for today 

Did you walk cool primitive cool? 
Did you know Dr. King? 
Was he ever so humble? 
Did you walk cool primitive cool? 
Did you break all the laws 
That were ready to crumble? 

A place far in the future 
And faces from the past 
And children reading history books 
Their faces light and laugh 
It all seems so primitive 
How did you survive? 
It all seemed so different then 
How did you stay alive?
