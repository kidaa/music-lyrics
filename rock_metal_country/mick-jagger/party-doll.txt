You used to be my party doll 
But now you say the party's over 
You used to love to honky tonk 
But now the honky tonking's over 
Now life is a bitter thing, my sweet 
Now life is a mystery to me 
Love's pain, I ain't buying 
Love's strange. I keep trying, trying, trying 

You used to be my party doll 
But now you want to live in clover 
You used to be my number one 
But now those salad days are over 

Times change but fascination stays 
Love wins but the passion just fades 
I'll drink to the dancing days 
I'll drink to your crazy ways 
Through the whiskey haze 

Face the music, face the truth 
Chase that fleet sweet bird of youth 
Grow up sweetly, grow up strong 
Hear the heartbeat, in my song 

Love's pain, I ain't buying 
Love's strange. I keep trying, trying, trying 

You used to be my party doll 
But now you say the party's over 
You used to love to honky tonk 
But now those dancing days are over 
You used to be my number one 
But now you vanished in the ozone
