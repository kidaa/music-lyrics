I wish I was in London 
Or some other seaport town 
I'll set myself on a steamship 
And I'll sail the ocean round 

While sailing around the ocean 
While sailing around the sea 
I dream of Handsome Molly 
Wherever she might be 

Her hair's as black as raven 
Her eyes as black as coal 
Her teeth are like lilies 
That in the morning glow 

Oh, don't you remember, Molly 
You gave me your right hand 
You said that if you married 
Well I would be your man 

And now you've gone and left me 
Go on with who you please 
My poor heart is aching here 
Lying at your ease 

And I go down to the river 
When everyone's asleep 
I dream of handsome Molly 
And sit right down and weep 

I wish I was in London 
Or some other seaport town 
I'll set myself on a steamship 
And I'll sail the ocean round 

While sailing around the ocean 
While sailing around the sea 
I'd dream of Handsome Molly 
Wherever she might be
