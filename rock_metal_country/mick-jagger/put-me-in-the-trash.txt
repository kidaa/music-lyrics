Yeah you put me in the trash 
yeah you gave me up for lost 
Now I see that you're doing alright 
Take a look at me and count the cost 
Baby can't you see I'm short on greens 
I am your long lost man, you don't recognize me 

I used to load you up with cash 
I used to dress you like a dream 
All the fancy food, you always wolfed it down 
Yeah but you never made a scene 
Baby can't you see, I'm no fantasy 
I am your long lost man, you don't recognize me 

Standing around in the rain, with my hands froze 
Looking around for small change in your window 
Out in the cold once again, write out a cheque for old flames 
Pity for old time sake, I'll make your heart glow 

Yeah, I'm your long lost man, don't you recognize me 
Gimme some money baby, I'm broke 
Why don't you, why don't you dig right down in your purse 
And gimme some dough 
Yeah don't you remember me baby 
Don't you remember all those Jean Paul Gaultier dresses 
I bought you and all those tickets to the opera 

What about that bright red Ferrari I bought you now 
And all those, and all those shoes 
Yeah I know it's the recession baby, but give me some money 
Yeah come on now be generous 
Oh yeah alright
