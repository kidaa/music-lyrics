Think about the sacrifices that I made for you 
Think about the hard times that you put me through 
Think about the good things that I done for you 
Think about the bad things that I tried not to do 

Come on baby 
Think about the good things 
Think about the bad things 
Think about the right things 
Think about the wrong things 
And baby before you leave me you'll realise 
That I'm the one who loves you 

How much of the happiness can you really claim 
How many tears have I shed, am I not to blame 
Though I can't remember what went wrong 
I tried so hard to please you, least that's what I thought 

Come on baby 
Think about the good things 
Think about the bad things 
Think about the right things 
Think about the wrong things 
And baby before you leave me you'll realise 
That I'm the one who loves you 

Come on baby 
Think about the good things 
Think about the bad things 
Think about the right things 
Think about the wrong things 
And baby before you leave me you'll realise 
That I'm the one who loves you 

Think about the sacrifices that I made for you 
Think about the hard times that you put me through 
Think about the good things that i done for you 
Think about the bad things that I tried not to do 

Come on baby 
Think about the good things 
Think about the bad things 
Think about the right things 
Think about the wrong things 
Come on baby 
Think about the good things 
And baby before you leave me you'll realise 
That I'm the one who loves you 
And baby before you leave me you'll realise 
That I'm the one who loves you 
And baby before you leave me you'll realise 
That I'm the one who loves you
