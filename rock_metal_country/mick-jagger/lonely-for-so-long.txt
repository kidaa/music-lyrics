I've been lonely for so long 
Don't seem like happiness will come along 
Well I've been lonely for so long 
Don't seem like happiness will come along 

These ain't rain clouds over my head 
Everybody's throwing rocks in my bed 
Just can't seem to get ahead in life 
Nothing I do seems to turn out right 
Somebody help me now 

I've been lonely for so long 
Don't seem like happiness will come along 
Well I've been lonely for so long 
Don't seem like happiness will come along 

I lay awake most every night 
Trying to figure out how to make things right 
There's got to be a better way I know 
To shake this monkey off cos it's making me so 
Won't somebody help me please 

I've been lonely for so long 
Don't seem like happiness will come along 
Well I've been lonely for so long 
Don't seem like happiness will come along 

I've been lonely for so long 
Don't seem like happiness will come along 
Well I've been lonely for so long 
Don't seem like happiness will come along
