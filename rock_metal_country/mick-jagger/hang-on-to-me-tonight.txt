Like a picture you came into my life 
Like a picture the colours fade away 
Love is fragile, you hide it from the light 
It lasts forever and always stays the same 

Like a movie, you swept into my life 
And like a movie, the stars just fade away 

Hang on to me tonight 
Stay close to me all day 
Hang on to me tonight 
Stay close to me all day 

Ah, honey, while there's youth upon your face 
Ah, honey, are you tiring of the race 
My cards are on the table 
You can get up and walk away 
Or stay 

Like a movie, you swept into my life 
And like a movie, the stars just fade away 
All the characters are mouthing out their lines 
And the love scenes are shot in shades of grey 

Hang on to me tonight 
Stay close to me all day 
Hang on to me tonight 
Stay close to me all day 

Ah, baby, while there's youth upon your face 
Ah, baby, don't you lose that natural grace 
My cards are on the table 
You can get up and walk away 
Or stay 

Hang on to me tonight 
Stay close to me all day 
Hang on to me tonight 
Stay close to me all day
