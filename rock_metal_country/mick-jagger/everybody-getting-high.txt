Everybody getting high
High high high high high high
Everybody getting high
High high high high high high

Here comes the writer
He's got the script right in his hand
Talkin to the actress
While she's checking out the band
Her name is pretty
But not the boils on her face
I feel like running
But there's no hiding place

Everybody getting high
High high high high high high
Everybody getting high
High high high high high high

My dress designers
They want to doll me up in blue
Pretty next fall's collection
They want to show it in the zoo

Everybody getting high
High high high high high high
Everybody getting
Fly fly fly fly fly fly fly

What are you doing here
To all these dogs you're just a bone
Before you throw up honey
Just grab your coat
And kiss your goodbyes
I'm gonna take you take you home

I'm checking out the kung fu actor
Boy is he way up his ass
He won't even talk to me
But he wants to show me
How to dance

Everybody getting high
High high high high high high
And I sit and wonder why
Why why why why why why
Cos everybody wants to 
Fly fly fly fly fly fly fly
