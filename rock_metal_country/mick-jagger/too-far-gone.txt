Let it down let it down
Let it down now
Let it down let it down
Let it down now
Let it down let it down
Let it down now

I always hate nostalgia
Living in the past
No use getting misty eyed
It all screamed by so fast

When life was so much calmer
Severely buttoned up
The future rich in promises
Milk flowing from the cup

I would spend those lazy days
Lying on a ridge
Watching girls in cotton dresses
Diving off the bridge

Is it too far gone
Is it too far gone
Is it too too far gone
Too far gone

This was once the country
Now it's all the town
What was once the tallest spire
Is just building crumbled down

And I'm lving in a factory
That's a million dollar flat
I'm not looking for arcadia
Cause it's never coming back

I would spend my childhood days
Lost in starry dreams
And now watch my children
Just downloading them to screens

Let it down let it down let it down
Let it down let it down let it down

Cause it's too far gone
Too far gone [cont]

Yeah it's too far gone
Yeah it's too too
Too far too far gone

Let it down let it down let it down

I'm lying in a garden
Carpets in the shade
Thinking of the future
And all the love we saved
The world outside is ugly
It's bitter and it's harsh
We each of us protect ourselves
We're hostage to the past

And it's too far gone
It's too far gone
I wonder where did we go wrong
And it's too too far
And it's too too far
Too far gone
