I know you're livin, in a fantasy
I know that love has got the best of me cash your chips
I know you're on the slide
Trust in me for I will be your guide

It's your lucky day baby
It's your lucky day now
It's the only way
To leave this town behind
It's the only way
To leave this town alive
It's your lucky day baby
It's your lucky day now

Careful now of the dogs that park
But watch out now the pool is filled with sparks
You're in the pit
The snakes begin to writhe
But help is here
I throw you down a line

It's your lucky day baby
It's your lucky day now
It's the chance
To leave this town behind
It's the only way
To leave this town alive

I know you're living in a fantasy
Yes I know that love has got the best of me

It's your lucky day baby
It's your lucky day now
It's the only way
To leave this town behind
It's up to you
You are the one to decide
It's the only way
To leave this town alive
