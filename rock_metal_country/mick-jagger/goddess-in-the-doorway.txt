Demons in the bedroom
Dogs are on the roof
I am in the basement
Looking for the truth

Tired of being patient
For the voice to come
If you want the answer
There is only one - only one

Her flesh is smooth and supple
And velvet as the night
Her eyes are shot with diamonds
A mouth full of delight

There's a goddess in the doorway
Asking how much can I take
And it looks like she's heading my way
There's a goddess in the doorway

Demons in the bedroom
Dogs are on the loose
Driving in the backstreets
Looking for the truth

I'm searching for your temple
Hunting for your shrine
I'm looking for a vision
By a neon sign

There's a goddess in the doorway
Asking how much can I take
And it looks like she's heading my way
There's a goddess in the doorway

And her tears flow like a fountain
Like a river from the mountain

How much
How much can I take
How much, how much can I take

Goodess in the doorway [cont]

There's a goddess in the doorway
Asking how much can I take
And it looks like she's heading my way
There's a goddess in the doorway
