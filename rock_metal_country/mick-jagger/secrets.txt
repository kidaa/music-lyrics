I heard a story, all about you 
I heard the secrets, maybe they're true 
I read the papers, I read the news 
I hear the gossip, all about you 
They say that you're really not so prim and prude 
Behind it all you're rather rude 
And really go for younger men 
Italian types and lots of them 
I can't believe it baby 
Maybe it's true 

Honey, honey, honey! 
Do it for the money 

I heard the stories 
On Saturday night, out in the back room 
After one or two lies 
Your name is mentioned 
It gives me a fright 
Dishonorable mention 
Puts you in a new light 

You've been going downtown slave romancing 
Nasty, mean and fancy dancin 
With your nose in plastic bags 
People talk and tongues all wag 
I can't believe it baby 

I've been a fool 
'Cause scales have just fell from my eyes 
You can't keep up your disguise 
Tell me about your adventures in living 
I won't write a word of libel 
Swear it on a thousand Bibles 
But, I admit, I have got my misgivings 
Maybe it's true 

Honey, honey, honey! 
Do it for the money 

I read the papers, I read the news 
I scan the columns for pictures of you 
You with the husband, you with the mayor, youu with the kids 
Now who are you kidding, who you kidding? 
How can you dare? 
While you are the mistress of a mafia man 
Who's working for the Vatican 
And all your money crisply ironed in off-shore banks 
Your friends are kind 
I can't believe it baby 
Maybe it's true 

Honey, honey, honey! 
Do it for the money 
Yeah, you've been a nasty girl 
Yeah, you've been bad 
You've been bad, you've been bad 
You better come over here 
And take your punishment 
Bad, bad, bad! Bad, bad, bad! 

Honey, honey, honey! 
Do it for the money
