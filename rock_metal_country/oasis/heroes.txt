I, I wish I could swim
just like a dolphin
like dolphins can swim
but nothing is gonna keep us together
and we can beat them
for ever and ever
cause we can be heroes
just for one day

I, I will be king
and you, you're gonna be my queen
well but nothing
is gonna drive us away
cause we can be heroes
just for one day
and we're gonna be ourselves
just for one day

I, I can remember
I remember
when I was standing
by the wall
by the wall
and then the guns
they shot over our heads
over our heads
and then we kissed
as though nothing could fall
nothing could fall
but when they're shooting
you know the seine was on their side
but we're gonna beat them
for ever and ever

cause we can be heroes
just for one day

we can be heroes
just for one day
we can be heroes
just for one day
we can be heroes
just for one day
yeah we can be heroes
just for one day
