hey hey my my 
rock and roll will never diet 
here's more to the picture than meets the eye 
hey hey my my 

you're out of the blue and into the black 
they give you this but you pay for for that 

and when you die, no you don't come back 
cos your out of the blue and into the black 

my my hey hey 
rock and roll is here to stay 

it's better to burn out than to fade away 
my my hey hey
