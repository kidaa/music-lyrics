what she said 
she said to me 
take me high on a mountain side 
she was dressed, on her leopardskin 
and her soul will never be denied 
i met her down a disco in a beat up car 
she was bombing down the road 
she looked just like a star in her jaguar 
she needs to lighten her load 

and when you might even think you're gonna call 
we'll be alright step out tonight 
you might even think you're gonna call 
we'll be alright step out tonight 

what i said 
i said to her 
i'm alive when you walk away 
when you hear what i can hear 
it's the sound of a brand new day 
she met me down a disco in a beat up car 
i was bombing down the road 
i can be a star in a jaguar 
i need to lighten my load 

cause you might even think you're gonna call 
we'll be alright step out tonight 
you might even think you're gonna call 
we'll be alright step out tonight 

my whole lifes been sinking in the water 
i need a ship to cross with it tonight 

you might even think you're gonna call 
we'll be alright step out tonight 
you might even think you're gonna call 
we'll be alright step out tonight 
you might even think you're gonna call 
we'll be alright step out tonight 
you might even think you're gonna call 
we'll be alright step out tonight 
step out tonight X10 
tonight X6
