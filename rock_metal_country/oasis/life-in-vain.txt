I used to live my life in vain
until today its been the same
I've gone away to disappear
my life with you was just too dear
a better life is all I need
to free me from this naughty league
I've been and gone I won't be back
I'll live my life without all that
with my own eyes I realised
it was time to say goodnight
I was never really sure but now I know I'm right
I used to live my life in vain
until today its been the same
I've gone away to reappear
my life with you was just too dear
a better life is all I need
to free me from this naughty league
I've been and gone and I won't be back
