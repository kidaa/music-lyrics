Cold and frosty morning there's not a lot to say
About the things caught in my mind
And as the day was dawning my plane flew away
With all the things caught in my mind 

I don't wanna be there when you're ...
Coming down
I don't wanna be there when you hit the ground 

So dont go away, say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and a day ... In the time of my life
Cos I need more time, yes I need more time just to make things right 

Damn my situation and the games I have to play
With all the things caught in my mind
Damn my education I can't find the words to say
With all the things caught in my mind 

Me and you whats going on
All we seem to know is how to show
The feelings that are wrong
