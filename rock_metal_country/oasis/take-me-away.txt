Just when it falls apart
and when it's time to stop
will you sit down here for another day
and when it's time to be
all the things that we
are wishing away for another day
cause me and my soul we know where we're going
we're going where the grass is free
and the air is clean
and the good times are growing
so take me away
just for today
cause I'm sat here on my own

I'd like to be under the sea
but I probably need a phone
just when it falls apart
just when it's time to stop
will you sit down here for another day
cause me and my soul we know where we're going
we're going where the grass is free
and the air is clean
and the good times are growing
so take me away
just for today
cause I'm sat here on my own
I'd like to be under the sea
but I probably need a phone
I could be you if I wanted to
but I've never got the time
you could be me and pretty soon you will be
but you're gonna need a line
need a line
need a line
need a line
