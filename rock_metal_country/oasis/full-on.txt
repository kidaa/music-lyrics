I hear my heart beatin faster
I feel it in my bones
I want it now 'cos I have ta
But why, no-one knows
I'm like the angel on the a train
I'm like the angel of the A train
My eyes are diamond white
From the cradle till your insane
For life you have to fight
But no-one knows why there's a spirit in the sky, there's escape for no-one
He will understand, while I take him by the hand, that life's time tunnel is long
Well it will be alright
If you stay tonight
It's where we both belong
It's gonna be full on
It's gonna be full on
It's gonna be full on
It's gonna be full on
It's gonna be full on 

I hear my heart beatin faster
I feel it in my bones
I want it now 'cos I have ta
But why, no-one knows
I'm like the angel on the a train
I'm like the angel of the A train
My eyes are diamond white
From the cradle till your insane
For life you have to fight
But no-one knows why there's a spirit in the sky, there's escape for no-one
He will understand, while I take him by the hand, that life's time tunnel is long
Well it will be alright
If you stay tonight
It's where we both belong
It's gonna be full on
It's gonna be full on
It's gonna be full on
It's gonna be full on
It's gonna be full on 

It's gonna be alright
You're gonna stay tonight
It's where we both belong
It's gonna be full on
It's gonna be full on
It's gonna be full on
It's gonna be full on
It's gonna be full on
It's gonna be full on
It's gonna be full on
It's gonna be full on
