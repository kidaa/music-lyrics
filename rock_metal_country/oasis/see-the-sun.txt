Trying to press, what you might be feeling
why suppress, what you might be needing
you missed the moon on Monday morning
you were lying in your sink
you missed the moon on Monday morning
cause you don't mean anything to anyone anymore

why confess, well you wouldn't need to
because on your desk, there's more to be seen to

by the time just keep on ticking
until I get my sweet release
by the time just keep on winding
until this cold-stop has ceased
and everyone can see the sun

I've send underwater, slept with your daughter
she told me what your rule book read
I've been to the slaughter, slept with your daughter
so won't you let me have my head
and then I can see the sun

you missed the moon on Monday morning
you were lying in your sink
you missed the moon on Monday morning
because you don't mean anything to anyone, anymore

by the time just keep on ticking
until I get my sweet release
and down this road I'll keep on winding
until this cold-stop has ceased
and everyone can see the sun

Everyone can see the sun
Everyone can see the sun
Everyone can see the sun

I've send underwater, slept with your daughter
she told me what your rule book read
I've been to the slaughter, slept with your daughter
so won't you let me have my head
and then I can see the sun
