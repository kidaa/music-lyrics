Wake up there's a new day dawning
I think I'll take a little walk for a while
I need shades cause the sun is blinding
and I can see for miles and miles
yeah I can feel the earth beneath me
i lie down we are as one
they look but they cannot find me
I'm off and heading for the sun
I'm getting colder
I feel a chill in the air
there's a change in the weather
we'll come to get
now I can feel the rain
the wind that brings on the change
is taking me over
the wind that brings on the rain
is making me older
downtown the moon is shining
I'm going to dress it up in style
my business everybodies minding
oh I pleed to get away for a while
I'm getting colder
I feel a chill in the air
there's a change in the weather
we'll come to get
now I can feel the rain
oh yeah
the wind that brings on the change
is taking me over
the wind that brings on the rain
is making me older
