They took my faith
they put it in a headlock and 
they sealed my fate
somewhere inside the world
in which they live
because I failed
they constantly ignore me and
they told me I lost my mind but
i believe that I rule the world

I'm singing out my revolution song
like nothing else matters
and you can pitch your gold against my soul
but I bet you get shattered
and there's a million houses in my heart
it won't be long
it won't be long
till I solve my mystery

it would for me
what do I believe in and
a masterkey
is somewhere inside of the world in which I live
and what for they
they will speak for no-one
and I may have lost my mind
but I believe that I rule my world

I'm singing out my revolution song
like nothing else matters
you can pitch your gold against my soul
but I bet you get shattered
and there's a million houses in my heart
it won't be long
it won't be long
till I solve my mystery

guitar solo

and I'm singing out my revolution song
like nothing else matters
and you can pitch your gold against my soul
but you gotta get shattered
and there's a million houses in my heart
and it won't be long
it won't be long
till I solve my mys
till I solve my mystery
