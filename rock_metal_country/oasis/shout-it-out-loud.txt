Hope we found our sweet release
I hope filled that hole within your soul
I hope at last we get some peace
I hope the light shines on we as one

there'll never be enough to love
the river's deep and the road is long
and every which way we turn
it seems insane
but it makes me feel alive

shout it out loud that I'm alive
shout it out loud when I'm alive
shout it out loud that I'm alive
shout it out loud

as we wish the world away
d'you think it's all a dream
cos that's what it seems
every night we hope and pray
that we can do enough to keep our love

there'll never be enough to love
the river's deep and the road is long
and every which way we turn
oh it seems insane but I makes me feel alive

shout it out loud that I'm alive
shout it out loud when I'm alive
shout it out loud that I'm alive
shout it out loud....
