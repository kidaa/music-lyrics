I'm tired of my life but my head's alright
I got the fever of a man that I know
I can feel it comin' in the air tonight
And I know I'm not alone

Sweatin' out my soul on the radio
My heart is laughing back at me
I can see it comin' but I just don't know
If it's gon', it's gon', it's gonna let me be

As I soar on the breeze
I can see the signs of those who came before me
And it's got me on my knees
What you say anyway
Will not last, it'll pass in a flash right there before me
And it's got me on my knees

Cos I got the fever
Yeah I got the fever
Cos I got the fever

I'm tired of my life but my head's alright
I got the fever of a man that I know
I can feel it comin' in the air tonight
And I know I'm not alone

Sweatin' out my soul on the radio
My heart is laughing back at me
I can see it comin' but I just don't know
If it's gon', it's gon', it's gonna let me be

As I soar on the breeze
I can see the signs of those who came before me
And it's got me on my knees
What you say anyway
Will not last, it'll pass in a flash right there before me
And it's got me on my knees
It's got me on my knees
It's got me on my knees
It's got me on my knees

As I soar on the breeze
I can see the signs of those who came before me
And it's got me on my knees
What you say anyway
Will not last, it'll pass in a flash right there before me
And it's got me on my knees
It's got me on my knees
It's got me on my knees
It's got me on my knees
It's got me on my knees

Jazz, nice spoken by Liam
