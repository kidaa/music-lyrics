Who will rise
it'll be so nice to hear you sing
thank you for the good times
before the good times fly away
your eyes are telling lies
so much storm is on the way
but it's so nice
but don't let the good times fly away

I drink to every circus standing here
among the few who've tried to cheat the years
there's always one of us who's blown away
I'll scratch a star for breath along the way

who will rise
it'll be so nice to hear you sing
thank you for the good times
before the good times fly away

I drink to every circus standing here
among the few who've tried to cheat the years
there's always one of us who's blown away
our stars are strapped for cash along the way

who will rise
it'll be so nice to hear you sing
thank you for the good times
before the good times fly away

thank you for the good times
before the good times fly away
thank you for the good times
before the good times fly away
t hank you for the good times
before the good times fly away
