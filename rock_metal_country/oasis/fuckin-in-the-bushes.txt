We put this festival on you bastards
With a lot of love
We worked for one year for you pigs
And you want to break our walls down
Or you want fuckin' to destroy us
Well you go to hell

Kids are running around naked fuckin' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked fuckin' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked fuckin' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked fuckin' in the bushes

I love it

Kids are running around naked fuckin' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked fuckin' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked fuckin' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked fuckin' in the bushes

I love it
Room for everybody here
Yes, all are welcome
Yes indeed, i love them
Fun, nice, life, youth, beautiful
I'm all for it 

I love it
Room for everybody here
Yes, all are welcome
Yes indeed, i love them
Fun, nice, life, youth, beautiful
I'm all for it
