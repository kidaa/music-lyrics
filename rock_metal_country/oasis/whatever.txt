I'm free to be whatever I
whatever I choose and I'll sing the blues if I want
I'm free to say whatever I
whatever I like if it's wrong or right it's alright
always seems to me
you only see what people want you to see
how long's it gonna be
before we get on the bus and cause no fuss
get a grip on yourself it don't cost much

free to be whatever you
whatever you say if it comes my way it's alright
you're free to be wherever you
wherever you please you can't shoot the breeze if you want
it always seems to me
you only see what people want you to see
how long's it gonna be
before we get on the bus and cause no fuss
get a grip on yourself it don't cost much
free to be whatever I
whatever I choose and I'll sing the blues if I want

here in my mind
you know you might find
something that you
you thought you once knew
but now it's all gone
and you know it's no fun
you know it's no fun
and you know it's no fun

I'm free to be whatever I
whatever I choose and I'll sing the blues if I want
I'm free to be whatever I
whatever I choose and I'll sing the blues if I want
whatever you do
whatever you say
I know it's alright
whatever you do
whatever you say
yeah I know it's alright
