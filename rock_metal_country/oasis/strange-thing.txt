Here is a pocket full of life with no solution
take it for what it is its only drunken lies
you should open up your mind look to the future
you could be waiting for the ship that sails you home
i'm going home

what would you give me
for the songs that i've been singing
help her to ever say that you've got more than me
mick says that he can never get no satisfaction
these days I think I know exactly what he means
what does he mean

you won't get
you don't get
what you need
life is a strange thing
you won't get
you don't get
what you need
life is a strange thing now

here is a pocket full of life with no solution
take it for what it is its only drunken lies
you should open up your mind look to the future
you could be waiting for the ship that sails you home
i'm going home

you won't get
you don't get
what you need
life is a strange thing
you won't get
you don't get
what you need
life is a strange thing now
