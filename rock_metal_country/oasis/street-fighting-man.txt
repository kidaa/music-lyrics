Fuckin' hell
fuckin' cunty fuckin' wires everywhere
ha ha, bastard spoken

everywhere I hear the sound of marching feet, boy
cause summer's here
and the time is right for fighting in the street, boy
but what can a poor boy do
'cept to sing for a rock 'n' roll band
cause in sleepy London town
there's just no place for a street fighting man
no

hey! think the time is right for a palace revolution
but where I live the game to play is compromise solution
well what can a poor boy do
'cept to sing for a rock 'n' roll band
cause in sleepy London town
there's just no place for a street fighting man
no, no, no
guitar

hey! said my name is called disturbance
I'll shout and scream
I'll kill the king
I'll rail at all his servants
well what can a poor boy do
'cept to sing in a rock 'n' roll band
cause in sleepy London town
there's no place for a street fighting man
no, no, no
