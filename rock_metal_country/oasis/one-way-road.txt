I wanna' get high
but I never could take the pain
cos' it'll blow away my soul like a hurricane

like a one-man band
clappin' in the pourin' rain
if I know where I'm going
I don't know from where I came

where we gonna be in summertime?
and are we gonna' see the heavens shine?
like diamonds in the sky

as soon as they come
the feelings they go
all alone
on a one way road

as soon as they come
the feelings they go
all alone
on a one way road

I wanna get high
but I really can't take the pain
cos' it'll blow away my soul like a hurricane

I'm like a one man
band clappin' in the pouring rain
if I know where I'm going
I don't know from where I came

where we gonna be in summertime?
and are we gonna see the heavens shine?
like diamonds in the sky

as soon as they come
the feelings they go
all alone
on a one way road

as soon as they come
the feelings they go
all alone
on a one way road
