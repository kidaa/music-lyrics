We the people fight for our existence 
We don't claim to be perfect but we're free 
We dream our dreams alone with no resistance 
Faded like the stars we wish to be 

Y'know I didn't mean... what I just said 
But my God woke up on the wrong side of His bed 
And it just don't matter now 

Little by little we gave you everything you ever dreamed of 
As little by little the wheels of your life have slowly fallen off 
Little by little you have to live it all in all your life 
And all the time I just ask myself why are you really here 

True perfection has to be imperfect 
I know that that sounds foolish but it's true 
The day has come and now you'll have to accept 
The life inside your head we gave to you
