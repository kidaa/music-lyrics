And how does it feel like
to wake up in the sun?
and how does it feel like
to shine on everyone?
how does it feel like
to let forever be?
how does it feel like
to spend a little lifetime
sitting in the gutter?
scream a symphony

how does it feel like
to sail in on the breeze?
and how does it feel like
to spend a little lifetime
sitting in the gutter?
scream a symphony

how does it feel like
to make it happen here?
how does it feel like
to breathe with everything?

and how does it feel like
to let forever be?
and how does it feel like
to spend a little lifetime
sitting in the gutter?
scream a symphony

and how does it feel like
to be a crystalline?
and how does it feel like
to spend a little lifetime
sitting in the gutter?
scream a symphony
