There's nothing you can say
I know exactly where I'm going
you said there was no way
but I could go without you knowing

just you wait and see
I will get what I have come for
don't try telling me
I could've given you a lot more
just you wait and see
I will get what I have come for
so don't try to tell me
cos I will show you all the way
