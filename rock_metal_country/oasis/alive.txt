The people will know it's not the time to change it
It's just for now but not for good
It's my feelings that I think you're draining
Take them now if you think you should
You want something for nothing
The higher that you climb the longer you fall
Maybe your time is coming
Will you have to climb when you find a wall?
Is it time to doubt?, is it time to wait?
Will you be left alone at the starting gate?
I'm not blind and I don't mind
Cause I got time now i'm alive

The people have known it's not the time to change it
But are they gonna do something now
I think I've seen you all hesitating
I think Ii'll go and do something now
You want something for nothing
The higher that you climb the longer you fall
Maybe your time is coming
Will you have to climb when you find a wall?
Is it time to doubt?, is it time to wait?
Will you be left alone at the starting gate?
I'm not blind and I don't mind
Cause I got time now I'm alive
Yeah I'm alive
And now I'm alive
Yeah I'm alive
