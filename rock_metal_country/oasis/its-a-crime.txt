Well you can say what you want
but you won't get a thing from me
and if you don't understand
that's it's not in your hands you need

let there be love
let there be love
let there be love
let there be love

but you can say what you feel
and it might never steal from me
and then you must understand
that it's all in your hands what you need

let there be love
let there be love
let there be love
let there be love

and I never knew
but all the thing's that you've done
are coming right back to you
but everybody knows that it's no crime

but does it make you feel ashamed
you never said what you done
and there's no need to blame
but everybody knows
yeah everybody knows
everybody knows that it's no crime
it's no crime

so you can say what you want
but you'll not get a thought from me
but if you say what you mean
then you might get a thing from me

let there be love
let there be love
let there be love
let there be love

if I ever knew
that all the thing's I've thought
are coming right back to you
but everybody thinks that it's a crime

it never makes you feel ashamed
you sit around and you sold
and you're passing the blame
but everybody knows
yeah everybody knows
everybody knows that it's a crime
it's a crime
it's a crime
it's a crime
