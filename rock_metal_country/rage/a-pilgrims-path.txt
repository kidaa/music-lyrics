Lyrics by: P. Wagner

This journey started long ago
When will it end?
I don't know

My ship's been stranded many times
I've missed some chances,
Yes, I know

My tale is not 'bout a hero
Anyway, but the stone and the flute are
With me

A pilgrim's path

I was a boy when Arnie died.
He put it all in my hands

This was the time I had to leave
On this path with no releaseThough I've been seeking for a lifetime
I don't know exactly what I'm searching for

A pilgrim's path

I have begun to settle down -
Still there's a hole in my life.

This cannot be the reason why I was born
Restless heart

Maybe that I'm not alone here,
What will I find if I leave to seek new shores?

A pilgrim's path

Give me one more chance
Please don't leave me here
Show me what I missed
