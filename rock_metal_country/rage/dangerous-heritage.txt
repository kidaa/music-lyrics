Efthimiadis, Lyrics by P. Wagner
This was the result of drink-and-play session
with Chris' brother Spiros.  It was funny listening
to the tape - you couldn't recognize the original
shit from the finished song.

A dangerous heritage they've left behind
for us, so we meet our death before time
for our children, they can take the rest
but there's not much
that we've saved in the past.
Take these conditions, the memories fade
choose a position between love and hate.
Alternate lifestyle - a wish to escape
travel this planet before it's too late.

Where do we go? Who want's to know?

Dangerous heritage - failures strike back
on your deathbed feel the grip 'round your neck
Dangerous heritage - you can't disclaim
curse it whenever it hammers your brain

A dangerous heritage they've left behind
for us so we'll find no peace for all time
talking and talking but then speaks the gun
until the most senseless battle is won.
When people' nation counts more
than their lives
then something's wrong
in their heads for all time
We transfer our views from father to son
ain't it our choice to wipe out what is wrong?

Where are we now? Who want's to know?

Dangerous heritage - failures strike back
on your deathbed feel the grip 'round your neck
Dangerous heritage - you can't disclaim
curse it whenever it hammers your brain
