Lyrics by P.Wagner

Once our eyes stare hollow in to nothing
our fingers clutching helpless in the void
Then our skulls won't tell about our past lifes
rich or poor, we're gonna be destroyed

Nothing gonna save us from death, leave it all behind
and our gathering, it was all invain

Over and over again
building up castles of sand
Over and over again
all for a kingdom of sand in your hands

Bankers, beggans, soldiers, priests and sinners
leadres, losers, all will be the same
if you keep your millions on accountings
nothinf you will take out from this game

And in your last hideway that's kept far underground
you'll share your remains gust with the worms

Over and over again
building up castles of sand
Over and over again
all for a kingdom of sand in your hands
