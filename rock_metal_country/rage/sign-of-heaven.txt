Music & Lyrics by P.Wagner

I've been waiting for an invitation
couldn't leave my selfmade reservation
I had locked the doors and threw the key away

There was nothing but my own reflection
and the phone was silent, no connection
I was turning just in circles with no end

All that I had, it was gone, it was dead
But now my night is surrounded by light
This nust be a sign of heaven, a sign of heaven
the nightmare's overAs the winter left the frozen places
and the mirror smiled at lonely face
The my leaves they started slowly reached out

Now your laughter echoes in the silence
and your waters wash the dirt from my hands
as we harvest all the fruits that come our way

All that I had, it was gone, it was dead
But now my night is surrounded by light
This nust be a sign of heaven, a sign of heaven
the nightmare's over

There was nothing but my own reflection
I was turning just in circles with no end...
