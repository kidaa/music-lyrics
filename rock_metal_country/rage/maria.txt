Tha sun ablaze as Marias foot 
Touches the surface of sand 
On Northern Land 
As human contraband 
Some Rico from Jalisco 
Passed her name to tha boss 
She stuffed ten to a truckbed 
She clutches her cross 
Here come tha exhaust 
And it rips through her lungs 
Shes off fast to tha pasture 
Like cattle shell cross 
Degree 106 
Sweat and vomit are thrown 
And she prays and suffocates 
Upon the memories of home 
Of Yanqui guns for blood debts on the loans 
Of smoldering fields, rape, rubble and bones 
Of graves hidden trapped up in visions of war 
Of nothing, no one, nobody, no more 

These are her mountains and skies and she radiates 
And through historys rivers of blood she regenerates 
And like tha sun disappears only to reappear 
Shes eternally here 
Her time is nearNever conquered but here 

To tear away at the mask 

And now she got a quota 
Tha needle and thread crucifixion 
Sold and shipped across tha new line 
of Mason Dixon 
Rippin through denim 
Tha point an inch from her vein 
Tha foreman approach 
His steps now pound in her brain 
His presence it terrifies 
And eclipses her days 
No minutes to rest 
No moments to pray 
And with a whisper 
He whips her 
Soul changed to his will 
My job is to kill if you forget to take your pill 
Her arm jerks 
Tha sisters gather round her and scream 
As If in a dream 
Eyes on the crimson stream 
Numb as her wrists spit shots of blood to tha floor 
I am nothing, no one, nobody, no more 

These are her mountains and skies and she radiatesAnd through historys rivers of blood she regenerates 
And like tha sun disappears only to reappear 
Maria 
Shes eternally here 
Her time is near 
Never conquered but here 

Uh 
To tear away at the mask 
Away at the mask 
To tear away at the mask 
Huh 

Maria whispered 

No minute to rest 
No moment to pray 
No minutes to rest 
No moments to pray 
No minutes to rest 
It eclipses her days 
Just a moment to pray 

To tear away at the mask, huh 
Away at the mask 
To tear away at the mask, huuh 
To tear away at the mask
