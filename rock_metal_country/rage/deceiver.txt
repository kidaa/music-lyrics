Music by Wagner/Gruning, lyrics by Wagner
No! You interfere with my free will
I won't give my mind for you to fill

All those words are lies, don't need no
Deceiver

Hate is what you sow between all men
Kill - you made them acquiesce to death

You earn well when other men die
DeceiverFool, stay blind, get in line
Count me out, I've no doubts
A man in herd, with a lack of conscience
This won't be my way, can't see where's the sense

Darkness spreading thicker day by day
They're afraid of having lost their way

This is nutritive power for a
Deceiver
