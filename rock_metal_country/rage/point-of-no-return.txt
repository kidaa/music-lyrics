So sad the story ends, my friend
This way it really wasn't meant
And there has been a choice
You kicked it all into the mud
Denied the years that we both had
Against the inner voice

I guess some people never learn
They drive the story to a point of no return
You wanted more than your concern
You drive the story to a point of no return
You drive the story to a point where there is no return

I've turned away, may life decide
How things are changing overnight
You can't come back... too late
And now may come whatever will
I know that I have paid my bill
And justice will be made

I guess some people never learn
They drive the story to a point of no return
You wanted more than your concern
You drive the story to a point of no return
You drive the story to a point where there is no return

Greedy constructions, misplaced interactions
Remember the words that were written
And the devil sends the beast with wrathThey will abuse the betrayer
Reduce him the same
He who gave a false witness
Will be given so ten times more

Cursed by his own curse
Perception will come far too late

And justice will be made

I guess some people never learn
They drive the story to a point of no return
You wanted more than your concern
You drive the story to a point of no return
You drive the story to a point where there is no return
