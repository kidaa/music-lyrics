The main attraction - distraction
got ya number than nnumber than numb 
Empty ya pockets son; they got you thinkin that
What ya need is what they sellin
Make you think that buyin is rebellin
 From the theaters to malls on every shore
Tha thin line between entertainment and war
The frontline is everywhere, there be no shelter here 
Speilberg the nightmare works so push it far
Amistad was a whip, the truth was feathered and tarred
Memory erased, burned and scarred
Trade in ya history for a VCR

Cinema, simulated life, ill drama
Fourth Reich culture - Americana 
Chained to the dream they got ya searchin for 
Tha thin line between entertainment and war

There be no shelter here 
Tha frontline is everywhere

Hospitals not profit full
Yet market bulls got pockets full
To advertise some hip disguise
View tha world from American eyes
Tha poor adore keep fiendin for more 
Tha thin line between entertainment and war
They fix the need, develop the taste
Buy their products or get laid to waste
Coca-Cola is back in the veins of Saigon 
And Rambo too, he got a dope pair of Nikes on
And Godzilla pure muthafuckin filler
To keep ya eyes off the real killer 

Cinema, simulated life, ill drama
Fourth Reich culture - Americana 
Chained to the dream they got ya searchin for 
Tha thin line between entertainment and war

American eyes, American eyes....
View the world from American eyes
Bury the past, rob us blind
And leave nothin behind 

Just stare
Relive the nightmare
