Oh, shit, I'm getting sick of this
I'm caught and I can't escape
It's gonna blow my head, you fucker get away
Me, madman in a rage
I hit the ceiling
outta my mind
Oh, when I get free
I'm gonna hand'em high
Hatred
Oh, baby, it's too unfair
The whole thing's such a mess
Would someone keep the door locked up
When the house is falling in?
The time is coming
I don't want no more
I should believe in
Oh, man, what a bore
Hatred
Maybe you think it's alright, well
But ain't it a pity to hang
around with nothing to do
but watching it? Maybe someone
needs a big kick in his map!
