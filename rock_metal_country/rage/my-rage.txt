2:42Music and Lyrics by P. Wagner
I've been sitting, wondering. Where am I to go?
I spend time on too many things, turn my tides too slow.

I never felt so sick, that's all I know.
but when I hit my strings too loud
Then I will let my demons out

My RAGE - there's danger in my smile.
My RAGE - no, this is not my stile.

In the suburbs of my mind lives a gang of four
joining me from time to time in my mental war.

I never felt so mean, that's all I know.
But when I hit my strings to loud
then I will let my demons out

My RAGE...

Now I will let my demons out...
In my hour of darkness they will come again;
Fear, hate, frustration, desperation.
They are all so negative, but now I'll get them down,
I'll answer with my RAGE...
