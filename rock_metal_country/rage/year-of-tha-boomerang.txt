Tha sistas are in so check tha front line 
It seems I spent the '80s in a Haiti state of 
Mind 
Cast me into classes for electro shock 
Straight incarcerated, the curriculum a cell 
Block 
I'm swimming in half thruts and it makes me 
Wanna spit 
Instructor come separate the healthy form tha 
Sick 
Ya weigh me on a scale I'm smellin' 
Burnt skin 
It's dark now in Dachau and I'm screamin' from 
Within 
'Cause I'm cell locked in tha doctrines of tha 
Right 
Enslaved by dogma, ya talk about my birthrights 
Yet at every turn I'm runnin' into 
Hells gates 
So I grip tha connan like fanon an pass tha 
Shells to my classmates 
'Cause tha bosses right ta live is mine ta die 
So I'm goin' out heavy sorta like mount tai 
Wit tha five centuries of penitentiary so let 
Tha guilty hang 
In tha year of tha boomerang 
I got no prosperity but yo I'm a piece of it 
So let tha guilty hang 
In tha year of tha boomerang 
And now it's upon you
