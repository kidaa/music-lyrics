What's this look inside my eyes,
This haunted creature, me.
What's this thing there in my back,
So strong but not to see.

Why is it that we're drowning in pain?

There's nothing evil here to stay
But fear in ourselves.
There's not a chance to find our way
With fear in ourselves.

We're possessed to take control,
To rule our world of sin.
Lower you to lift me up.
I cannot trust within.Why is it that we're drowning in hate?

There's nothing evil here to stay
But fear in ourselves.
There's not a chance to find our way
With fear in ourselves.
With fear in ourselves...

There's nothing evil in this world
But fear in ourselves.
