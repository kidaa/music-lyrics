Music by Wagner/Schroeder, lyrics by Wagner
Life means being perfect day by day
Restless
I need somebody's help to get away
Don't trust no one,
They don't want you, they want your pay
Win or loose

Machinery - destroying what I want to be
Machinery - there's nothing that you get for free

Reporters work for those who pay them well
Ruthless
The top priority is just to sell
Obey or die
If you don't play the game, you'll die
Win or loose

Machinery - doesn't care about you and me
Machinery - got no choice at allThe public wants to be fed with big lies
Illusions, images and big dreams
Turns fools into kings, let genies die meanwhile
The glory's half as bright as it seems to be

Why don't you really love the things you do?
Liar
No matter what it is, it won't be true
Bitch of success
You sold your honour for the gold
Win or loose

Machinery - destroying what I want to be
Machinery - got no choice at all
Machinery - there's nothing that you get for free
Machinery - hear the salesman's call
