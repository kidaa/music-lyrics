Help me, I must reach the border
I run from the keepers of order
They have locked me just for nothing
Help me, I'm down by law
Help me, I'm down by law
Watch out, they're at your door
Help me, I'm down by law
There's no chance to defend
When power is in wrong hand
Me, I come out for the dirt, I got nothing
No, the cops, they were looking for a fight
And I'm a victim of denunciation
Repeat 2nd verse
My fortune is a plight
Where's law there's no right
"Kill this bastard hunt him to death!"
"Oh, have mercy!" "No, you won't be free!"
Now I'm a criminal subject
Why? My life a mess, no turning back
Just because arbitrariness rules this land
