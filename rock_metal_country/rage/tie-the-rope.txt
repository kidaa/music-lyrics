Music by P. Wagner, S. EthimiadisLyrics by P. Wagner
Some kinds of today, live a boring life,
They say, playing deadly gamese,
Risk their life for just a thrill

Now one wants to see, how final is iternity
Show me, I'm alive, I'm waiting for a sign!

Frame their gallows, meet their death
They tie the rope, they hang at lastOpen up your eyes,
Life means more than beign alive
Check out what you've got,
The end will be free soon enought

Now one wants to see, how final is iternity
Show me, I'm alive, I'm waiting for a sign!

Frame their gallows, meet their death
They tie the rope, they hang at last
