Wagner, Schmidt/Wagner
I believe in the dark
I am afraid of the world
'Cause it scares me, I know

People don't like me, talk behind my back
Avoiding the look in my disfigured face

I'm just waiting for the moon to come and set me free
And I'm just waiting for moonlight and then my eyes you can see
I'm just waiting for the moon to come and set me free
Because the moonlight can release me from my misery

Hide my face in the day
Tonight I'll set myself free
I'm addicted too moonlight

Run with the wind, feel the wet in the air
A pleasure for me and my distorted soul

I'm just waiting for the moon to come and set me free
And I'm just waiting for moonlight and then my eyes you can see
I'm just waiting for the moon to come and set me free
Because the moonlight can release me from my misery

Hid my face in the day
Tonight I'll set myself free

Run with the wind, feel the wet in the air
Oh, how I'm longing for it
A pleasure for me and my distorted soul
I feel like the cat walkin' on a wall

I'm just waiting...
