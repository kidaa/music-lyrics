Music: P. Wagner, M. Schmidt/Lyrics: P. Wagner

Terror, confrontation
With the army, splittered nation
Smash the mirror, there's no way back
To the reign of egoism and brutality

Now it's time to decide on what side you are on
It's too late for a false compromise

Overnight they came in the same old way
The same old combination
To the power comes the greed
Power and greedPeople shook their fear off
Did not take this provocation
With their bodies against the tanks and
In the end the idea of democracy and freedom has won

Criticise what you think that is wrong
Now it's time to decide on what side you are on
It's too late for a false compromise
Overnight they came in the same old way
The same old combination,
To the power comes the greed
Power and greed

In these days when statues of old men
Crash down to the ground, the old order has gone
Nothing's like it was and chaos everywhere
From this ruins will grow a new chance for the world

Overnight they came...
