I have a strange dream
I cannot explain
And when I'll lay down
It will come back again

In a mysterious landscape
Far beyond my belief
In a shape that I can't face
I have found the real me

I have the one desire, it sets my soul afire
There's something waiting in the deep
Beyond the wall of sleepAnd this something had hurt me
It will pay for my pain
When my destiny's fulfilled
I won't come back again

I have done the one desire, it sets my soul afire
There's something waiting the deep
Give me just one more night and I can make it right
There's one appointment I must keep
Beyond the wall of sleep...
