Down on the street where the faces shine 
Floatin' around i'm a real low mind 
See a pretty thing in a wall 
See a pretty thing in a wall 

In a wall 
In a wall 
In a wall 

Yeah deep in the night I'm lost in love 
Yeah deep in the night I'm lost in love 
A thousand eyes they look at you 
A thousand eyes they, they look at you 

Oh Come On! x3 
Yeah Yeah Yeah 
repeat 

Oh Come On! x3 
Yeah Yeah Yeah 

Where faces shine 
A real low mind 
Faces Shine 
A real low 

Oh Come On! x3 
Yeah Yeah Yeah
