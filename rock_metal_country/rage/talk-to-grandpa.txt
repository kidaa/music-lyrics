Lyrics by: P. Wagner

I know Sally, let me tell ya, what 'bout her
she's a medium, she can catch the vibes in the air
she's so sensitive with supernatural powers
I have seen her talkin' to the Dead in trance
...Talk to Grandpa
...Talk to Grandpa
...Talk to Grandpa
...Talk to Grandpa

Since I know 'bout it there's one thing that I want
she should ask my grandpa, if he's there beyond
ask what happend with the money that he save
'cause noone found it in his house when he had died....Talk to Grandpa
...Talk to Grandpa
...Talk to Grandpa
...Talk to Grandpa

Ask my grandpa if he's got a dime for me!

...Talk to Grandpa
...Talk to Grandpa
...Talk to Grandpa
...Talk to Grandpa
