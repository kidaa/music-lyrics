Lyrics by : P. Wagner

You don't like what you see
you don't know what it means and what it's like.
You close your eyes, you're afraid that all you
have learned has changed

Time waits for noone
You can't fix it if you try
Time waits for noone
You can join it for a little while

Once put into your brain
all the things of life got a special frame
but you forget that this world's go a different
face each day

Time waits for noone
You can't fix it if you try
Time waits for noone

You can join it for a little while
You can join it till you die

"What's this jungle noise?
Long haired filthy boys?
Sex before marriage?
You don't believe in the pope?!

Time waits for noone
