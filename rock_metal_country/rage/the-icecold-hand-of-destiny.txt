4:05Music by P. Wagner, S. EfthimiadisLyrics by P. Wagner
Plans I have made to build it up from this state.
Always moving, never stop, though the answers are made
'bout the future, 'bout the past,
where I come from, what will last.

Try to delay things that lead you astray.
But society sucks you out, leads to early decay.

If I will, if I won't, a decision that I could not flee.
I prayed it leave me be - the icecold hand of destiny.

Everything's right, it seems the future looks bright.
But there's always factor X that leads the tumbling dice.

If I will...

Play for future, play for past,
where you come from, what will last.
