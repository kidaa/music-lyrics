Music by Wagner/Schroeder, lyrics by Wagner
Oh no! Somebody said they're marching out tonight
Fists high, their eyes straight on, the goal far out of sight

Screaming leaders, tell you what to say
They're all tools of the rulers behind 'em

They're scared to death!

They talk 'bout power and 'bout glory to gain
To be an hero 'n' get an order's the main thing

March into battle, you'll see what is real
Hell's coming nearer and death's on your heels

Chorus:
They're scared - scared to death
The agony is brutal - scared to death

Ha, ha, ha they stand face to face with a gun
What will be harder, the bullet - the man?

Satan's calling - you must pay the price
You had the choice you believed in their lies

Chorus

"Aaaaaah - where are those creeps who ordered
war?"
They sit at home and earn still more war is business,
so die?
"No..."

Oh no! Somebody said they're marching out
tonight
Fists high, their eyes straight on, the goal far out
of sight
March into battle, you'll see what is real
Hell's coming nearer and death's on your heels

Chorus
