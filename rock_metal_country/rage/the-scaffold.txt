Music by Wagner/Schroeder/Gruning, lyrics by Wagner
No one could have known that you would end in
this way
You gotta face it, it's the end
This world knows no right, they wouldn't see what
is truth
They won't believe you're not to blame
No one can say - what's coming your way
And there ain't no way out
They're all looking down
No one makes no sound
Why must it end all in this way, why, why, why?

The torture's been surmounted now
you told them all they wanted
The pain you've overcome somehow
but what'll come from now on?

Dyin' and rotting will be your destiny
Sooner than nature planned
Where are those who loved you they all turned away

And no one will shed a tear

Chorus:
Raise up your eyes
The scaffold awaits
Truth tells no lies
The scaffold awaits

You're left alone in agony
The death blow awaits you
The public is your enemy
For crime someone must payLying is right - it's an antinomy
But no one gives a shit
What is it, this mankind, a crowd of betrayers
Fearing for their own lives?

Chorus

Dyin' and rotting will be your destiny
sooner than nature planned
You thought that someone loved you, but they let an
innocent die

Chorus

Good or evil - it's in their minds
But they're so careless, though you've been kind
Take care of treason, kiss on your cheek
They got perception, but they're too weak

So many voices outside the room
They're waiting for you, await your doom
Lay down your head now - you're gonna die
The scaffold awaits for your parting cry
