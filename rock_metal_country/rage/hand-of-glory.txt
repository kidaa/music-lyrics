Music by Wagner/Schroeder, lyrics by Wagner
Disturbing the peace of the night for a raid
Stealing goods taken through greed
A playtoty transcendental powers had made
This is the thing that you need

Chorus:
Hand of glory
Stopping all the sleepers from awakening this night
Hand of glory
Witchcraft triumphs in joy while the fingers are
set alight

All who live in this house fell asleep
The hand was making them drowse
Now there's time to take all you need
Ho hindrance to plund'rin' this house

ChorusFirst you need a hanged man's corpse
Cut off the left hand and preserve it
But dress it not with tannin pure
Witches know the right mixture

The hand makes succesfull robbery - well
But just take care of the thumb
If it don't burn someone's not in the spell
And he'll discover your plan

Chorus

Hand of glory
