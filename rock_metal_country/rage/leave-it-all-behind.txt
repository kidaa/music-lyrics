I don't want to leave this world behind
Was the only thing I had in mind
Now you've sent the angels back
I need them here on earth
'Cause eternity can be a long, long time
Don't turn your back on me, don't take away my choice
'Cause reality is lying to my mind, so now

I want to leave it all behind
I've got to leave it all behind
I need a window out of time
Come let me leave it all behind

Tell me 'bout the secrets of my life
What is it that makes me feel this way
I can feel my energy, it's turned against myself
Like a downwards spiral heading straight to hell
Maybe I could let it be and leave it all undone
'Cause I'm stumbling and it's time to say goodbye... goodbye
I want to leave it all behind
I've got to leave it all behind
I need a window out of time
Come let me leave it all behind

I can feel my energy, it's turned against myself
Like a downwards spiral heading straight to hell
Don't turn your back on me, don't take away my choice
'Cause I'm stumbling and it's time to say goodbye... goodbye

I want to leave it all behind
I've got to leave it all behind
I need a window out of time
Come let me leave it all behind
