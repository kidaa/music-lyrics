Wagner/Wagner
My mother told me lies when she
said: "You must learn for life.
The world will have a window for
you when you do the right."
But every day life proves that it
depends on different things
If born not rich and mighty then you
cannot spread your wings

You can't be absolutely free
If you don't want to stay alone
We're bound to be society
Even if you change it there's still him
and you and me

That's human bondage
Chains of the world, noone's free...
That's human bondage
Chains of the world, noone's free,
none of us are free.

Money is a license to be better than the poor
It makes the people friendly and it opens every door
And everyone's a dealer but your luck is not for free
So, if you've got the cash then I will satisfy your needs

There's so much stuff to ease your pain
When you awake it was in vain
Dreams make it easy when you're down
But all that counts is that you take
your chance and run

That's human bondage
Chains of the world, noone's free...
That's human bondage
Chains of the world, noone's free,
none of us are free.

That's human bondage

You can't be...
