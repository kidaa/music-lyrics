Bangin' this bolo tight on this solo flight 
Can't fight alone 
Funk tha track my verbs fly like tha 
Family stone 
Tha pen devils set that stage for tha 
War at home 
Locked wit out a wage ya standin' in tha drop 
Zone 
The clockers born startin' at an empty plate 
Momma's torn hands cover her sunken face 
We hungry but them belly full 
The structure is set ya neva change it with a 
Ballot pull 
In tha ruins there's a network for tha toxic 
Rock 
Shool yard ta precinct, suburb ta 
Project block 
Bosses broke south for new flesh and 
A factory floor 
The remains left chained to the 
Powder war 
Can't waste a day when the night brings 
A hearse 
So make a move an plead the fifth 'cuse ya 
Can't plead the first 
Can't waste a day when the night brings 
A hearse 
So now I'm rollin' down rodeo wit a 
Shot gun these people ain't seen a 
Brown skin man since their grandparents bought 
One 
Bare witness to tha sickest shot while suckas 
Get romantic 
They gonna send us campin' like they did my man 
Fred Hampton 
Still we're lampin' still clockin' dirt for our 
Sweat 
A ballots dead so bullets what I get 
A thousand years you had the tools 
We should be taken 'em 
Fuck tha g ride I want the machines that are 
Makin' em 
Our target straight wit a room full of armed 
Pawn to 
Off tha kings out tha west side at dawn 
The rungs torn from the ladder can't reach the 
Tumor 
One God, one market, one truth, one consumer 
Just a quiet peaceful dance 
For things we will never have
