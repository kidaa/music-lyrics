I have seen reflections of my inner self tonight
It was like a mirror in a pair of distant eyes

A scary view promised everything I knew
It connects the last four centuries with my life

Paranoia... Sister Demon on my mind
Sister Demon on my mind
She's a vampire... Sister Demon on my mind
Sister Demon on my mind

She has paralysed me, immortality awaits
Now, how will it be when I will feel her shiny teethSurrounding time with her presence into mine
Now I think will it be wonderful to die

Paranoia... Sister Demon on my mind
Sister demon on my mind
She's a vampire... Sister Demon on my mind
Sister demon on my mind

Sister Demon on my mind
Sister demon on my mind

Paranoia... Sister Demon on my mind
Sister demon on my mind
She's a vampire... Sister Demon on my mind
Sister demon on my mind
