Lyrics by: P. Wagner

This is for you, you know who you are,
better believe what I tell you now.
For all the others, 'cause everybody's
got someone in his life that he hates, I know.

I'm used to be calm and not too beasty
but this is more than I can endure.
You dealt with me really mean and nasty
I don't wanna be patient with you no more

Make my day!
This is the sign of my deadly hammer
leaving its marks on your face right now.
You won't hear my warning, now you're bound to make my day
C'mon you sucker, make my day
Make my day!

I'd like to smash all your toys to pieces
tickle your feet until you drop dead
I'd tie you tight to a stake and stain you
with honey, then let the ants run free

Make my day!
This is the sign of my deadly hammer
leaving its marks on your face right now.
You won't hear my warning, now you're bound to make my day
C'mon you sucker, make my day
Make my day!

Don't open up what you call your head, now
I don't want no answer, I'm through with you.
Save your excuse, I don't want to hear it
it's just a lie, anyway, I know!

Make my day!
This is the sign of my deadly hammer
leaving its marks on your face right now.
You won't hear my warning, now you're bound to make my day
C'mon you sucker, make my day
C'mon you sucker, make my day
C'mon you sucker make my day
Make my day!
