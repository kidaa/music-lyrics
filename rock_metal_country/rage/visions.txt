4:17Music and Lyrics by P. Wagner
Headed away and took off in the sky,
the air was as bright as my mind.
And everything on the ground floated by,
a land of toys, undefined.

Glittering clouds that were puzzled in the air,
hiding a secret, not easy to share.

I've got visions and I can't
get then out of my mind,
it was a moment in time.
I've got visions and I can't
get them out of my mind,
what am I leaving behind?
I've got visions...I saw a face that I'll never forget,
staring at me through the mist.
Leaving a trace that lead into my head,
the other side I have missed.

There in the hemispheres I caught a view in life
where all is streaming and nothing will die.

I've got visions and I can't
get then out of my mind,
it was a moment in time.
I've got visions and I can't
get them out of my mind,
what am I leaving behind?
I've got visions...
