I've seen it coming, it's got to be.
No illusions at the turning of the century.
All our wishes - forever free -
all destroyed because somehow we lost the masterkey.

Leaving my dreams far behind,
got no ambitions in time if only I'm so

Black in mind, When there's no point in making it.
Black in mind. When there's no hope for love, I'm so
Black in mind. When these madmen are wasting it.
Black in mind. I don't want to be sacrificed for

a territorial war. Leave me alone, I'm so black in mind.

You made me want it, too blind to see
that all it gave me were illusions of reality.
My eyes got used to the things they've seen,
now where's the difference between my life and the TV screen.
