Wagner/Wagner
Now I know it's time again to change my life
Yes it's time for me to leave it all behind
Say goodbye to all I'd have if I'd stay here
No, I don't need it anymore

The wind is whispering in the trees, they call my name
The birds that leave me down here, they all do the same
Don't you think that I don't care
There'll be a time
When I am old enough to stay

There's this longing in my heart that must be fed
It gets its thrills outside the walls
There are still so many pictures in my head
I must follow to this call

As I leave it all behind - saddle the wind
Satisfy my longing mind - saddle the wind
As I leave it all behind - saddle the wind
Say goodbye from time to time - saddle the wind

As I see the naked earth, wide open fields
There's a vision to become a part of it
In its sparkling waves the river invites me
To join it on the journey to the seaAnd always when I feel I've got a home
Then I need to get away

As I leave it all behind - saddle the wind
Satisfy my longing mind - saddle the wind
As I leave it all behind - saddle the wind
Say goodbye from time to time - saddle the wind

There's this longing in my heart...

Saddle the wind
