Music & Lyrics: P. Wagner

When it is night and there is darkness in your room
You hear a sound with sharpened ears
Then it is me 'cause I return from time to time
And I have heard your silent tears

You lock your bedroom door and close the window
Indeed you know that there is no way to hide
I get in from the door on the backside

Baby, I'm your nightmare
But I know that you will like the creeps
'Cause nothing thrills like scary deeds
I know that you will like the creeps
You know you'll like the creeps

We learned to know each other many years ago
And in those days I was your man
We never could have been a couple, you and me
But still I do the best I can

To make your sheets alive and fill the space up
That all the others still were leaving behind
To make that sweat is running down your spineBaby, I'm your nightmare...

We make your sheets alive and fill the space up
That all the others still were leaving behind
To make that sweat is running down your spine

Baby, I'm your nightmare...

You know you can't get over me
'Cause I can set desire free
When moonlight's shining through the trees
I'm coming from your fantasies
You need that dirty mad dog, me
You cannot live without, you see
And when it's dreamtime I'll return
To feed the flame in you, it burns for me,
'Cause I'm your nightmare

Baby I'm your nightmare
