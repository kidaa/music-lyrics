The night is scary
It's telling me the things I should not do
You're near me
I think I better stop
Tonight I'm weary
I'm telling you I think it's nothing new
Oh,dear me
And maybe I should better get away

`Cause tonight the horror takes us all
If you paint the devil on the wall
It is here, it's waiting for your call
Don't you paint the devil on the wall

The mind has power
Don't focus it on that what causes fear
It's coming
what you think will appear
We're blind but knowing
It's sleeping in the back of our heads
Don't show it
'Cause maybe it will answer and we're deadThen tonight the horror takes us all
If you paint the devil on the wall
It is here, it's waiting for your call
Don't you paint the devil on the wall

In here, out there
This is our evil spirit
It lies, in wait
Don't bring this vision in our lifes

`Cause tonight the horror takes us all
If you paint the devil on the wall
It is here, it's waiting for your call
Don't you paint the devil on the wall
