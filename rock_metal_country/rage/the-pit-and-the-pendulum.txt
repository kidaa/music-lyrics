Music by: P. Wagner, C. Efthimiadis, Lyrics by: P. Wagner

In the darkness left alone
Walls surround that hellish hole
deadly deep and no way out
from above I hear a swinging
metal blade clinging

In the pit and the pendulum
the pit and the pendulum
comin' near and nearer

In the inquisition's claw
sentence of death is their law
though unholy and sadistic
it's a question of their honour,
of gods to die for

With the pit and the pendulum
the pit and the pendulum
swingin' above my throat

The pit and the pendulum
could it be the soldiers 're coming?
The pit and the pendulum
do they open up my prison?
