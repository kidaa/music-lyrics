I've never believed in miracles, I rarely even cried
But you never know the day when things will change
You came to me and gave me back what I have left unpaid
And to see myself, it felt so very strange

The mirror in your eyes the mirror in your eyes
Is telling me what I've become alive and that is why
The mirror never lies there's pain inside your eyes
The mirror in your eyes

I never thought of consequences bringing life to fall
Though I want to love instead I pull you down
How can I be this way when I don't feel like this at all
And you know how much I need to be around

The mirror in your eyes the mirror in your eyes
Is telling me what I've become alive and that is why
The mirror never lies there's pain inside your eyes
The mirror in your eyes

Painful... I'm learning
In hell I am churning
I see my reflection in you

A monster returning
A heart that's still burning
I see my reflection in you

Thankful I'm learning
The candles are burning
Don't know where I'm turning
The mirror is blurring
In hell I am burning

The mirror in your eyes the mirror in your eyes
Is telling me what I've become alive and that is why
There's pain inside your eyes the mirror never lies
The mirror in your eyes
