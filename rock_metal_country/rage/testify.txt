The movie ran through me 
The Glamour subdue me 
The tabloid untie me 
Im empty please fill me 
Mister anchor assure me 
That Baghdad is burning 
Your voice it is so soothing 
That cunning mantra of killing 
I need you my witness 
To dress this up so bloodless 
To numb me and purge me now 
Of thoughts of blaming you 
Yes the car is our wheelchair 
My witness your coughing 
Oily silence mocks the legless 
Boys who travel now in coffins 

On the corner corner 
The jurys sleepless sleepless 
We found your weakness weakness 
And its right outside your door 

Now testify 
Now testify 
Its right outside your door 
Now testify 
Yes testify 
Its right outside your door 

With precision you feed me 
My witness Im hungry 
Your temple it calms me 
So I can carry on 
My slaving, sweating, 
The skin right off my bones 
On a bed of fire Im choking 
On the smoke that fills my home 
The wrecking ball is rushing 
Witness your blushing 
The pipeline is gushing 
While here we lie in tombs 

While on the corner corner 
The jurys sleepless sleepless 
We found your weakness weakness 
And its right outside your door 

Now testify 
Yeah testify 
Its right outside your door 
Now Testify 
Now Testify 
And its right outside your door 

Mass graves for the pump and the price is set, and the price is set 
Mass graves for the pump and the price is set, and the price is set 
Mass graves for the pump and the price is set, and the price is set 
Mass graves for the pump and the price is set, and the price is set 

Who controls the past now controls the future 
Who controls the present now controls the past 
Who controls the past now controls the future 
Who controls the present now 

Now Testify 
Testify 
Its right outside your door 
Now Testify 
Testify 
Its right outside your door
