Music & Lyrics: P. Wagner

I feel sick, I'm so nervous I can't sleep,
Life is getting more busy each day
And my doctor is giving me more pills
Some get me up, some calm me down, yeah

Modern chemistry, big into business
Is the keeper of our neuroses
And we don't listen to our body
By the time it gets the overdose

Oh, there's such a simple healing
'Cause we've got a power inside that make us real tough
The right medicine for us is going back to our roots
We better look for sanity inside
The right medicine for you and me is really free
It's coming with the wind for those who ask for more

There's and Indian chief who discovered
What his ancestors already knew
And he's shown us the path of the power
In his vision there's a reborn truth

Oh, there's such a simple healing
'Cause we've got a power inside that can make us real tough

The right medicine for us is going back to our roots
We better look for sanity inside
The right medicine for you and me is really free
It's coming with the wind for those who ask for more

Don't wait for help, you won't get what you need
Wake up your spirits and let them run free
Courage to kick all your sorrows away
The universe in you, it's your energy

Oh, there's such a simple healing...
