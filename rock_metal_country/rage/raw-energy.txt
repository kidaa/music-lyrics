Music by Wagner/Gruning, lyrics by Wagner
Hellchild, you got
No fun, you're wild
That's you: dependent,
Obey, you do

No way to go

So come on
Oh yeah, you need a
Brainstorm today
Shout out your pain
be strong, be loud

No way to goChorus:
Bang - it's raw energy
Bang - it's raw energy

Don't fear your dreams
Work'em out, they'll come clear
Never surrender
Next time do better

Feel the comin' of the chord
Oh, it says a lot more than a thousand words

Chorus
