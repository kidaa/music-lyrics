Lyrics by: P. Wagner

Harold Walker was a banker
He drove a Mercerdes-Benz
He was a well respected, rich, young man
He'd got a house in the country
He was a member of the club and
His girlfriend Diana was so sweet

Larry Smith was Harry's schoolmate
He has always been a warrior
Never he had money or a job

Wednesday afternoon, 5 p.m.
It happened on the new built highway
Harry was a bit diverted and

So he lost the control of his car
And crashed into a truck
And he hadn't a chance, he had never a chance
Death in the afternoon,Larry was the first to come along
As he saw his old mate Harry
The chequecards covered with blood,
He knew, he was the richer one of both

Harry had a million dollars
But he'd lived to short

And he hadn't a chance, he had never a chance
Death in the afternoon

Death in the afternoon
It could come very soon
Death in the afternoon
Your coffin has no pockets...
