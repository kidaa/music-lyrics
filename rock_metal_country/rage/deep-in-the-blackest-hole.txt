4:23Music by P. Wagner, S. EfthimiadisLyrics by P. Wagner
Hey, what have they done to you?
Say, do you mean what you do?
Just like a spark that fell aside, or what -
you're telling me you're happy but I know you're not.

I look into your eyes and see your heart is black.
Are you afraid of me or why don't you look back?
You're telling me to follow, do it like you've said,
you'll get me never, never, never...

What has happened to you life?
Do you really want it so, 'cause

I don't want to be like you, the time will come,
when everything too late
Deep in the blackest hole.
I'll never be like you and you will end
frustrated, full on hate,
deep in the blackest hole!

You don't like to see the world
like it is, you try to change it all.
You're in defense, only appologize,
you're telling me you're lucky but I know your lies.I look into your eyes and see your heart turns red
like if you're wounded but no drop of blood is shed.
You don't look for a cure, instead you're hurting me,
You'll get me never, never, never...

What has happened to you life?
Everything you had is missing.

I don't want to be like you, the time will come,
when everything too late
Deep in the blackest hole.
I'll never be like you and you will end
frustrated, full on hate,
deep in the blackest hole!

What has happened to you life?
Do you really want it so, 'cause

I don't want to be like you, the time will come,
when everything too late
Deep in the blackest hole.
I'll never be like you and you will end
frustrated, full on hate,
deep in the blackest hole!
