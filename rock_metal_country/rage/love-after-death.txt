All I want is you but so far I never knew you,
Our limitless selves, all that can remain is there.

Now give us the time to share it
'Till the sleep comes again.

Love after death, the other half, in a unit we're best.
Love after death, this is forever, I have no regrets.

Lost, out of my sight,
Alone wandering through the night.
Time tore us apart,
So different to learn by heart.Now give us a chance to share it
As life comes again.

Love after death, the other half, in a unit we're best.
Love after death, this is forever, I have no regrets.
Love after love after love after death.

Love, all I want is you,
I am just like you, never we can die.
Love, circle in a whole,
The twin of my soul, 'till the end of time.

Love after death...
