I won't go where you've gone
'cause it showed that it does not work.
If you stay where you are then you will bite the dust.
And I know what I know
I believe what my eyes can tell -
you're no longer so sure
that you've done it right.

Why did you what you've done?
All that's left is you've lost our trust.
All the people believe not a word that you say.
And you think you're so clever
that it makes you a better man
but for real you just live on the cost of us all.

Bastard, you bastard, stay where you are!
I don't believe you a word.

Lies are a weapon that kills from inside.
If there's no change you'll bury all life.
You steal from us all what we need to survive
looks like soon you will bury all life.

Open your eyes and see there's no way you can turn it back
when you sell what's not yours when you rape mother earth.
Now start making an end
a beginning to stop that waste.
Do you really believe
you could own all this land?

Bastard, you bastard, get outta my way!
I don't believe you a word.

Lies are a weapon that kills from inside.
If there's no change you'll bury all life
You steal from the world what it needs to survive
Looks like soon you will bury all life.
Looks like soon you will bury all life.
Looks like we are not worried that soon you will bury all life!
