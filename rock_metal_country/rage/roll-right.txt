Lick off the shot my stories shock ya like 
Ellison 
Main line adrenaline Gaza to Tienanmen 
From the basement I'm dwellin' in 
I cook back the sling 
To stone a settler and breaks him off clean 
Call me the upsetter 
Here come the hands on the leashes 
The cross, the capital, tha pale families, the 
Fear and the mouthpieces 
The single sista lynch 
The cell dors crash 
And the master's drums echo 
Roll right 
Roll call 
Now we're alright 
We're all calm 
This hits like fists 
Bomb with the left and don't miss 
With the sickest stilo I spark fear in the pigs 
In the park 
Head crack, I hijack the papars and the vapors 
Caught fire up in you mind 
Come back, rewind one time 
Here come the hands on the leashes 
The cross, the capital, the pale families, the 
Fear and the mouthpieces 
The single sista lynch 
The cell doors crash 
And the master's drums echo 
Roll right 
Roll call 
Now we're alright 
We're all calm
