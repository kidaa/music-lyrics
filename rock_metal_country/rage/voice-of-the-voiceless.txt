Uh, Uh 
Cmon check it 

Through Steel walls 
Your voice blastin on 
True rebel, my brother Mumia 
I reflect upon 
You be tha spark 
That set the prairie fires on 
Make the masses a mastodon path 
To trample the fascists on 
At fifteen exposed Phillys finest killing machine 
Boots and mad guns 
They pacify ya young 
Cause and effect 
Smell tha smoke and tha breeze 
My panther, my brother 
We are at war until youre free 

Youll never silence the voice of the voiceless 
Youll never silence the voice of the voiceless 

Yet tha powerful got nervous 
Cause he refused to be their servant 
He spit truth 
That burned like black churches 
Prose and versesA million poor in hearses 
Watch the decision of Dred Scott 
As it reverses 
Long as the rope 
Is tied around Mumias neck 
Let there be no rich white life 
We bound to respect 
Cause and effect 
Cant ya smell tha smoke in tha breeze 
My panther, my brother 
We are at war until you're free 

Youll never silence the voice of the voiceless 
Youll never silence the voice of the voiceless 
Youll never silence the voice of the voiceless 
Youll never silence the voice of the voiceless 

And Orwells hell a terror era coming through 
But this little brothers watching you too 
And Orwells hell a terror era coming through 
But this little brothers watching you too 
Watching you too
