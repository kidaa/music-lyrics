Every official that come in 
Cripples us leaves us maimed 
Silent and tamed 
And with our flesh and bones 
He builds his homes 

Southern fist 
Rise through tha jungle mist 
Clenched to smash power so cancerous 
Black flag and a red star 
A rising sun loomin over Los Angeles 
Yes for Raza livin in La La 
Like Gaza on to tha dawn Intifada 
Reach for the lessons tha masked pass on 
Seize tha metropolis 
Its you its built on 

Everything can change on new years day 
Everything can change on a new years day 
Everything can change on a new years day 
Everything changed on a new years day 

Cmon 
War within a breath 
Its land or death 
War within a breath 
Its land or death 
War within a breath 
Its land or death 
War within a breath 
Its land 

Their existence is a crime 
Their seat, their robe, their tie 
Their land deeds 
Their hired guns 
Theyre tha crime 

Shots heard underground round the rapture 
Worlds eye captured 
At last is a Mexican pasture 
Tha masked screaming land or deathWithin a breath 
A war from the depth of time 
Shot four puppet governors in a line 
Shook all tha world bankers 
Who think they can rhyme 
Shot the landlords who knew it was mine 
Yes its a war from the depth of time 

And everything can change on a new years day 
Everything can change on a new years day 
Everything can change on a new years day 
Everything can change on a new years day 
Cmon 

Uh 
Wearin the masked scream 

War within a breath 
Its land or death 
War within a breath 
Its land or death 
War within a breath 
Its land or death 
War within a breath 
Its land or death 

Its land or death whispered 

Yeaaaaaah 
Uh 
Cmon, cmon, yes, yes, yes 

Its war within a breath 
Its land or death 
War within a breath 
Its land or death 
War within a breath 
Its land or death 
War within a breath 
Its land or death
