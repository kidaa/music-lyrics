P. Wagner/P. Wagner
This is a very new one, written in November '90 and
previously unreleased.

Woman, I know it's not easy to say
But I miss you the longer I'm so far away
You know me, it's not easy to find the words
Woman, I miss you each day in the desert

Woman, tomorrow I might bite the dust
Believe me, I don't want to stay but I must
God help me, I'm so afraid, don't let me down
Oh, woman, I love you, I love you, I love you,

How I long for you, woman
We belong to each other...

Woman, I'm so afraid, don't let me down
Oh, woman, I love you, I love you, I love you,

In the gunfire's roaring sound
When I'm falling to the ground
I can see your face so real
Oh, how I long for you, woman

We belong to each other...

I wish it would be like before
In the days of the cold war
We could play around in peace
Oh how I long for you woman

We belong to each other...
