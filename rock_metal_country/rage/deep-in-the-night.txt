Deep like blood
That's what she's all... she's got
Eyes like a knife
And she makes you want to fly
When she takes you through the night

One desire
Comes from the sleeping soul
Burns like fire
And it makes you want to cry
When it breaks into the mind

Deep in the night
In the absence of light, deep in the night
Deep in the night
Between passion and fright, deep in the night

Be my one
Be mine before it's gone
Time slips away
But your face won't see the day
Will you ever pass my way
When I'm begging you to stay tonightDeep in the night
In the absence of light, deep in the night
Deep in the night
Between passion and fright, deep in the night

Deep like blood
That's what she's all... she's got
Eyes like a knife
And she makes you want to fly
When she takes you through the night
And she makes you want to fly tonight

Deep in the night
In the absence of light, deep in the night
Deep in the night
Between passion and fright, deep in the night
