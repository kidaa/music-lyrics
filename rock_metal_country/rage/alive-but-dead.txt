4:56Music by P. Wagner, C. EfthimiadisLyrics by P. Wagner
As I walk the streets I feel no pain,
there is no love or hate, can't see no certain state I'm in.
And a fog has laid itself on my heart
like this misty morning as this cloudy day begins.

Still I wonder should I be afraid
about what's happening and how long has it been - don't know.
Why did come this shadow in my head
like I have lost my soul, like I'm alive but dead.

As I walk the streets I feel no fear,
although I notice that there is no feeling anymore.
And I try to send my mind back to the times
when I was able to live something to the core.

Dark, dark as the grave, my heart is dead,
I'm just a slave to what they've said. this decay
Still I'm alive but I feel dead.
Dark, dark as the grave, my heart is dead,
I'm just a slave to when you call, my disease
Still I'm alive but I must be dead.

Alive but dead
can't fill my head

Darkness, there's darkness everywhere.
You gotta help me out of here,
I don't want to stay alive without the capability to feel!
