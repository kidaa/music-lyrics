Leader of the state
Now, as there's the time for changes
The growing fear and hate,
It will cost you your head, dictator

Grown from the heart
Bursting out to break the silence
A will to be free
People have remembered the sun

Oh, you know it's up to you
So many years - it's much too long that you have fooled
A whole nation

Slink away and set us fee
We live our lives as it's meant to be
You know inside that it's true, so shame on youYou and your pack
You shouldn't have been so selfish
Lost from the start
Injustice your best companion

No, you cannot save your skin
'Cause every day a new life will begin
And you won't be in

Slink away and set us free
We live our lives as it's meant to be
You know we're right and it's true, so shame on you

Slink away...
