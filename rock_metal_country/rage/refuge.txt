Music/Lyrics by: P. Wagner

This is mine, here's where my home is
I don't want to let you break into my world
All my life I've been looking for something
that's my own, I'm so glad I found it now

Don't you step on this ground
I don't want to lose an inch of my freedom
I'll lose my soul if you steal my refugeLeave my cloud and stay away
this is my refuge
play your dirty tricks, my friend
but leave my refuge

I grow stronger and you feel smaller
guess that's your reason for taking up my time
with every secret that you make public
your influence on my life grows, ain't this true?

Don't step on this ground
I don't want to lose an inch of my freedom
I'll lose my soul if you steal my refuge
 Leave my cloud and stay away
this is my refuge
play your dirty tricks, my friend
but leave my refuge
Leave my refuge
