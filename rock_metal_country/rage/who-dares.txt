Music by: P. Wagner, C. Efthimiadis, Lyrics by: P. Wagner

Why do you look for answers in the extremes?  Forget the radical
'cause the truth is mostly somewhere in between
Nevermind the simple minded as long their heart beats in the right place,
but for heaven's sake if they forgot their aims and to tell their kids

Now they are trapped and they don't even care
still they don't understand what it means
dimborn they never have learned anything
they are trapped in a world reigned in fear

Who dares to stop these fools?

We need revolution - someone has to change the crusted rites
but we need heads that can think before they act
'cause it has to happen in a way that changes the conditions for the better
There's no time for old mistakes

Now they are trapped...

Who dares to stop these fools?

Brutality is trendy, discussing's for old farts
Today the cracked voice of youth screams out the fatal fascists call
All the mindless, unwanted, frustrated think that there's a way to bring sense in their life
They confuse the Free with lemmings...

Now they are trapped...

Who dares to stop these fools?
