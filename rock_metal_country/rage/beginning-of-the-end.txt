In the top of the trees all these eyes follow me.
All is black, like the crows, stiff my neck as it bows.
On my knees I will play among death and decay,
And it blackens the sun as the end has begun.

I never saw the mighty spirits
That gathered now to purity the world.
It is the time of the changing season,
The cleaning hands of water. Wind and fire - feel the fire.

Winter rides the wings of heaven
Sorrow marches through the land.
This is the beginning of the end.

And the flood rises higher, swallows cities alive.
Still the flames' hunger grows, taking over our homes.
In the eye of the storm, gods creation reborn.
666 in our hearts, it will tear us apart.

This is the age of the sunlight children
And from the ashes we'll build it up again.
The curtain of the night will fall down
And stronger, wiser than before we'll stand - take my hand.

Winter rides the wings of heaven
Sorrow marches through the land.
This is the beginning of the end.
Darkness covers lonely faces,
Mercyful death takes their hand.
This is the beginning of the end.
