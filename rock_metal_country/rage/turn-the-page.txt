Music & Lyrics by P.Wagner

Time will come when you fell down
Everything you had is gone
and whatever you had thought you'd really need
is meaningless, you turn around
caught by light a distant sound
like a creature that is drawn into the flame

Turn the page and face another day
on that stage that you're supposed to stay
Turn tha page and fill it up with life
I won't sigh when time will turn the page

You're alone during the stay
Company can share your way
but they'll never ever make it really close
to the core, to the beyond
What's in store on from this point
will surprisingly be scaring joyful painTurn the page and face another day
Take your time cause something's on the way
Turn the page and fill it up with life
And don't sigh when time will turn the page

On these tracks we walk, we've got a choice
Be aware. I'll be your voice...

Time will come you're down
everything you had is gone
And whatever you had thought you'd really need
is meaningless, you turn around
caught by light a distant sound
like a creature that is drawn into the flame

Turn the page and face another day
on that stage that you're supposed to stay
Turn tha page and fill it up with life
I won't sigh when time will turn the page
