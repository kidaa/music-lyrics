3:42Music and Lyrics by P. Wagner
And my brain feels like a rock.
In my veins the stream is locked.
There's no pulse and there's no beat.
I am dead but not complete.

I must be waiting for the day,
lying in this box.
When they found a way against decay,
till then I'm this block of

frozen fire, in this iceland sleeps desire,
frozen fire, a blue flame beneath the wire,
I'm frozen...

In this darkness I'm alone.
Will I stay or am I gone?
Where're the others by my side?
Help me in eternal night!Slowly I feel a growing fear,
could this be my hell?
If they can't find the way out if here
I'm forgotten, last farewell, I'm

frozen fire, in this iceland sleeps desire,
frozen fire, a blue flame beneath the wire,
I'm frozen...

And my brain feels like a rock.
