Let me take you far away, beginning of your days,
The agony is written in your eyes.
This is how you've always felt,
You see it through the haze.
Remember how you've locked it up in lies.

They're coming back from far away,
They're coming back, they cannot stay.
So I will pray to purify my mind.

Wash my sins away,
Take my sorrow and pain.
Wash my sins away,
Dry my rears with your rain.
Scars from yesterday,
Make my sins, oh, please wash them away.Live again through feelings
That have shattered all your trust,
The pain you've felt
Is burned into your heart.
Never understood,
You were rejected, on the run
And, till today it's tearing you apart.

They're coming back from far away...
