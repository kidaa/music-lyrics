Music and Lyrics by: P. Wagner

Will you wake me?
Wake me when I'm dead

I think it's time now, I gotta go
but don't you shed a tear when I'm gone.
Before it's over,
I hope that I don't suffer too much, when it's over

I don't want to miss this place
I hate to leave, I just can't face
realities of death, I will deny
realities of death, I will denyWill you wake me?
Wake me when I'm dead

And when I grow cold you cotta put a spell on me,
before I grow cold
Just one injection and maybe I can stay on your side
if the shot works

I don't want to miss your face
the warmth of summer
springtime's grace
realities of death, I will deny
realities of death, I will deny

Will you wake me?
Wake me when I'm dead
