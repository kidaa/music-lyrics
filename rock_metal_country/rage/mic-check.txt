To tha young r to tha e tha b to tha e tha l 
Never give up just live up 
Fed upon America 
I be spittin it up 
Rippin it up 
Even amount in each cup 
To my brothers burning bare feet on black top 
Whose curled neath tha shadows 
From the gaze of the cops 
Whose huntin for 9 to 5s through factory locks 
Is now hunted on this modern day auction block

Fast and in a fashion

Quicker than a fed cash tha company checks

With this mic device 
I spit nonfiction 
Who got tha power 
This be my question 
Tha mass of tha few 
In this torn nation 
Tha priest, tha book or tha congregation 
Politricks who rob and hold down your zone 
Or those who give tha thieves tha key to their homes 
Tha pig whos free to murder one Shucklak 
Or survivors who make a move and murder one back
