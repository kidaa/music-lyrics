Ughh! Hey you, it's just another bombtrack...ughh! 
Hey you, it's just another bombtrack...yeah! 
It goes a-one, two three and 
It's just another bombtrack 
And suckas be thinkin' that they can fake this 
But I'm gonna drop it at a higher level 
'Cause I'm inclined to stoop down 
Hand out some beat-downs 
Cold runna train on punk ho's that 
Think they run the game 
But I learned to burn that bridge and delete 
Those who compete at a level that's obsolete 
Instead I warm my hands upon the flames of the flag 
As I recall our downfall 
And the business that burned us all 
See through the news and the views that twist reality 
Enough 
I call the bluff 
Manifest destiny 

Landlords and power whores 
On my people they took turns 
Dispute the suits I ignite 
And then watch 'em burn 

With the thoughts from a militant mind 
Hardline, hardline after hardline 

Landlords and power whores 
On my people they took turns 
Dispute the suits I ignite 
And then watch 'em burn 

Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn 
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn 
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn 
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn 
Yes ya gonna burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn 
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn 
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn 
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn 

It goes a-one, two, three 
Another funky radical bombtrack 
Started as a sketch in my notebook 
And now dope hooks make punks take another look 
My thoughts ya hear and ya begin to fear 
That ya card will get pulled if ya interfere 

With the thoughts from a militant mind 
Hardline, hardline after hardline 

Landlords and power whores 
On my people they took turns 
Dispute the suits I ignite 
And then watch 'em burn 

Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn 
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn 
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn 
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn 
Yes ya gonna burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn 
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn 
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn 
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn 

Euurrrggghhhhh! 
Uggh! Hey you, it's just another bombtrack... 
Check it out... 

Modified chorus 
Burn!
