5:34Music and Lyrics by P. Wagner
Now, as I had a look at you
it took a heartbeat and I knew
that the candle of my life was burning shorter.
You turned me 'round to face myself,
to make me trust in what I am,
now, after all that I have done it makes me wonder I'm around.

Now the night has gone,  better days to come.
All this time I have been afraid, it is not too late...

All this time while we talked my thoughts collided.
All this time I could have seen but I was blind.
All this time...

I thought I'd never see the day
that in myself I'd feel this way.
We are the meaning and we know. Forever different - the same.

Now the night has gone, better days to come.
All this time I have strained my mind, waiting for a sign.

Time is like a river that is running out to sea.
We can't touch the ground, so grab a blade of straw.
If you swim on waves of trust you cannot even drown,
when you hit the shores of love you cannot die...
