Lyrics by P.Wagner

This is my life and I won't compromise or waste my time
All I have done I did on purpose 'cause I want it to do
if I was wrong I'm very sorry but this happens when you try
sometimes you cann't forsee how things are working out
and what it's about...

if it all was in vain I won't sigh for a single day
I'll do it again and again
If it was in vain I will wait for another time
I swear. I won't go down again

And if I doubt I might have failed even before the day is done
how can I know if I don't dare?
Am I allowed do it twice if I don't make it at first time?
Then I will learn from my mistakes and I'll do right
haven't I try...?

if it all was in vain I won't sigh for a single day
I'll do it again and again
If it was in vain I will wait for another time
I swear. I won't go down again

I know you know that we can
We hold the key in our hands
to make it better, then it wasn't all in vain.
