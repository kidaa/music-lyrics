3:37Music by P. Wagner, S. EfthimiadisLyrics by P. Wagner
You're such a liar, when I first saw you
I really thought you'd be our man.
You started sighin' and caged us all in,
seems that we've built our hopes on sand

I can see your real self in your eyes.
You don't want to be my friend.

You speak with a forked tongue,
say "hi", but it means "go to hell" -
over and over again.
The face behind the mask.
All that you've done was for taking
and not for giving.
I've recognized what's within,
saw the face behind the mask.

You're such a coward, we brought you forward,
we gave you chances on and on.
But you just wasted what we invested,
now there's no way to carry on.

I can see your real self in your eyes.
You don't want to be my friend.You speak with a forked tongue,
say "hi", but it means "go to hell" -
over and over again.
The face behind the mask.
All that you've done was for taking
and not for giving.
I've recognized what's within,
saw the face behind the mask.

Look in the mirror behind the mask.

You're such a loser, there's no excuses,
you'll never make it mark my words.
Forget your sighin, there is no way, man.
I'll never trust again in you, no!

I can see your real self in your eyes.
You don't want to be my friend.

You speak with a forked tongue,
say "hi", but it means "go to hell" -
over and over again.
The face behind the mask.
All that you've done was for taking
and not for giving.
I've recognized what's within,
saw the face behind the mask.
