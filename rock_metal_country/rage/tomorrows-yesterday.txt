Whatever you may say
How long you want to stay,
Tomorrow's yesterday
We're tomorrow's yesterday.

It seems we've tried too much
To keep the status, to longer the touch
Of what we are today. Afraid of change we see
And interprete eternity like it's a static way.

Whatever you may say
How long you want to stay,
Tomorrow's yesterday
We're tomorrow's yesterday.

And if we just accept the things,
It's hard to bring us down.
'Cause if we try to force the will
We break the rules and feed the firestorm.

Afraid of death we are
We close our eyes from where we are,
A point of no return. Misunderstanding that
The person we are is another step
For ourselves to learn.

Whatever you may say
How long you want to stay,
Tomorrow's yesterday
We're tomorrow's yesterday.If we will try to let it go we open ways to get.
We better do a step aside, give room to grow,
Not feed the firestorm.

Come with me, it's hard to make you see
Just what it means to be,
Why can't you see.

Rising high, I know we have to try. Don't give it up
For lies. Why can't you try.

Talk to me. I'll try to make you see just what it
Means to be, just let it be...

Time is so relative, in secrecy we're learning to live
And nothing was in vain.
We'll stand the rest of time,
Discovering the inner divine.
The rules made not the game.

Whatever you may say
How long you want to stay,
Tomorrow's yesterday
We're tomorrow's yesterday.
