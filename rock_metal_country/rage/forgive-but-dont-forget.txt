Music by P. Wagner, S. EthimiadisLyrics by P. Wagner
I was so disappointing,
That all my trust was built on send,
I was against all reason

Eye to eye the innocentce die

Forgive, but don't forget,
Never fall twice,
Forgive, but don't forget,
Straight through the lies

Your speech was full of treason
I had to pay for your sins
I healed my woundsHow I'm stronger than all

Head to toes, experience grows

Forgive, but don't forget,
Never fall twice,
Forgive, but don't forget,
Straight through the lies
