Music/Lyrics by: P. Wagner

Her mother told her everyday: "Never lose control
Whatever then may come your way, a good girl takes it all."
And all the years she held her peace and followed every rule
but then depression dried her heart
and now she's screaming out

Nevermore - never we'll forget
Nevermore - one day you'll regret

He used to be a follower
and did what he was told
whatever they squeezed out of him
a good man bears it all.
But one day he was in their way
did not fit in their plan
they tried to kick him from the boat
and now he's screaming out

Nevermore - never we'll forget
Nevermore - one day you'll regret
 Never we'll forget, no!

Nevermore - never evermore...
