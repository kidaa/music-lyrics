Lyrics by: P. Wagner

Sometimes when I'm by myself, before I fall asleep
the darkness becomes liquid and I'm drowning in the deep

Sinking like a stone, coming through different mental spheres
I see so many people reaching out when I get near.
I can see despair in their eyes and I hear them call,
they want me to rescue them, want me to free them all

Distant voices, I hear them calling me,
calling for me
Distant voices, I hear them calling me,
calling for me

They all lost their time
did not see their aim
died without a sense
they're still unredeemed

Distant voices, I hear them calling me,
calling for me
Distant voices, I hear them calling me,
calling for me

I've seen them everywhere in this world, legions of no hope.
They always close their eyes and they forget all what they know.
Perception comes to them when they are in the throes of death,
but it is too late to turn around...

If they'd seen it all before they wouldn't suffer this way now
'cause it's easy dying after one has lived a fulfilled life
but perception comes to them when they are in the throes of death
and then it's too late to change it all...

Distant voices, I hear them calling me,
calling for me
Distant voices, I hear them calling me,
calling for me
Distant voices...
