Lyrics by: P. Wagner

Autumn - the time of darkness and decay
Life's running shorter day by day

Winter -has gripped the land in cold caress
He's all alone and deeply depressed, she's dead

Don't you fear the winter, I will keep you safe
And warm
Don't you fear the winter, nothing's gonna
Do you harm

Midnight - and on the graveyard a storm is RAGEing
The clods of earth hide his whole life

Homeless - who's lonely now will be for long
The wind will drift him on and on, like the leavesDon't you fear the winter, I will keep you safe
And warm
Don't you fear the winter, come with me,
There'll be no harm

A silent might that has moved you
Hear your waters stand still
Striding down to the elder
Soon you'll meet her again

Autumn - who's got the time knows nothing yet
Who cares?  But watchful are the Dead

Midnight - It's hard to face and deeply sad
But you're asleep so don't look back, you're dead

Don't you fear the winter, I will keep you safe
And warm
Don't you fear the winter, nothing's gonna
Do you harm
Don't you fear the winter, I will keep you safe
And warm
Don't you fear the winter, come with me,
There'll be no harm
