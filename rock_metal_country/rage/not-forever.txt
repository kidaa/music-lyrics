Music & Lyrics: P. Wagner

He is alone though he's one of the crowd
Days made of dust and nights filled with doubts
Somewhere's a light he can't see and he knows

Not forever, no eternity
Not forever, one day he'll be free

He's got the time to think and he found
It's all the same with the people around
They need someone to bear all their sinsNot forever, no eternity
Not forever, and the world will see

Locked in a cell, that is his life
Only one thing in mind
Making a change
Not willing to wait 'til it's time to die
One thing before his eyes
Making a change

What will the world look like without him?
Who'll do the dirty jobs if not him?
What are the leaders without someone to lead?

Not forever, no eternity
Not forever, one day he'll be free
Not forever
