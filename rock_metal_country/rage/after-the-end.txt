We're moving on, to where we don't know
After the end of eternity
We'll be gone and nothing will show
Maybe a name that is carved in stone

God forgive me, for I know what I have done
It wasn't meant to be so real

Endless nights, so many have passed
You were the first but not the last
Still I'm here, condemned to survive
I can't be dead, can't be aliveAfter all is said and done
We have to carry on
After the end
And with all that we've been through
There's nothing left to do
After the end

After all is said and done
We have to carry on
After the end
And if all of this is true
There's so much more to do
After the end

God forgive me, for I know what I have done
It wasn't meant to be so real
