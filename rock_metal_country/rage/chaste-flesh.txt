Music by Wagner/Schroeder, lyrics by Wagner
Sweet childlike lady
You stir me up
The time is coming
To warm up your ass
I've got the number
And when it's night
I'll come to screw ya
I'll tear you right

Now we're together
Delightful feast
You are a virgin
I am a beast

Chorus:
Chaste flesh - I'm gonna change it
Chaste flesh - I can arrange it
Chaste flesh - lay down or die
Chaste flesh now obey

She's coming nearer
Oh, if she knew
She's so wanton
Genuine and new
My body's hungry
Sweating in heat
I'm gonna give her
My rod of meatChorus

Biting, scratching - baby you unchain my lust
Howling, growling - when will you unchain my lust

Chorus
