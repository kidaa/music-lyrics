4:30Music by P. Wagner, S. EfthimiadisLyrics by P. Wagner
Think back to when you were younger,
remember when life had no scars.
You were at home in your own mind,
responsive to your inner call.

I'm waiting you'll come back,
I'm waiting for your return.

Don't waste your time any longer.
Start a new story, start a new glory.
Don't waste your time any longer.

Start a new story, start a new glory in life!You're in a state of progression,
shapeless fears break free someway.
Your life became an obsession
when the machine stole your days.

Why do you lose your time in senseless rites
that dry your will away?

Don't waste your time any longer, just start!
