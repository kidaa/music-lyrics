He's got a pleasure in his
life that's a real chill
I think it's funny but the people say he's ill
He likes to keep what's transient,
save it from decay
That's what you've got to know
if you should pass his way
He's not a killer,but death is his dearest friend
It is for everyone beginning and the end
And on the graveyard,
where there's rich and poor the same
He's digging in the ground to set them free again
They've been part of the universe
And they are unique on this earth
And when you dies he's at your door
I tell you what he's waiting for
He's gonna get you when you are dead
He's gonna cut your skull free when you're dead
He's gonna get you when you are dead
You're gonna be the next one when you're dead
It's a passion with him
to free them from their flesh
All night he's in the cellar rigging up remains
And then he's got them all together one by one
A real collector of the dead, a lucky man
Just give a damn for reverence
He's nuts and doesn't need no sense
And when you die he's at your door
I tell you what he's waiting for
Repeat 2nd verse
DEAD! DEAD. "won't you give me your mother?
Gonna rip her with real care
This femoral's real fine
