P. Wagner, J. Schroeder/P. Wagner
This is a fun-version with new words of an very old song from
Avenger, the band that became Rage in late '85.  It was written
in the summer of '83 and appeared on the Avenger album
"Prayers Of Steel" no more available

We are going to attack
Another barrel's cracked tonight
On the banner beer and booze
We rape the bottles on the loose oh yeah

Bottlefield
Fun and coma side by side
Bottlefield
Could you say who's at your side?

All they filled up was in vain
Pools remember former times
Smoke and laughter all around
Drunken bodies on the ground

Bottlefield
Fun and coma side by side
Bottlefield
Could you say who's at your side?

There is still a rest of men
Only crap is on their minds
But if they try to get up
The alcohol will tear them down

Bottlefield
Fun and coma side by side
Bottlefield
Could you say who's at your side?
