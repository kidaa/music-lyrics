4:15Music by P. Wagner, S. EfthimiadisLyrics by P. Wagner
When the world's gone mad compassion dies.

Soldiers killing for their thrills,
making war just for the sake of war.
There's no future left than death.

Leave me be - misery!

Weep with the children and stave with the prisoners
before you scream for revenge.

Sorrowful women with tears in their hollow eyes -
this is no justice, this is the price of war.
The price of war

Some came running to the military,
misled by a false ideal,
believing guns could solve a problem, still
blind to see they only kill.

Ripped off from the middle,
ripped off from head to toes.
Ripped off - multikilling,
ripped off - guts and bones.

Weep with the children and starve with the prisoners
before you scream for revenge.
Sorrowful women with tears in their hollow eyes -
this is no justice, this is no justice.
You'd watch the dying, lay hands on their bleeding wounds
before you scream for war, don't you scream for.
This is no justice, this is the price of war.
