Lyrics by: P. Wagner

There are secret tests
Labs in east and west
Working for their states
On a second race

Changing human genes,
Building 'em new again
To a perfect kind -
Modern Frankensteins

It's a simple plan:
They try to build a man
That's more productive,
More intelligent

Pefect mind and body

But it is no use
Humanity will lose
'cause the greater mass
Becomes a second classNature's not to rule
Those who try to do
Could be the first to go
When the mutants come

Who would stop these slaves
When they leave their cage?
Then we'll meet our fate
'cause they're better, they've got

Perfect mind and body

Nature's not to rule
Those who try to do
Could be the first to go
When the mutants come

Who would stop these slaves
When they leave their cage?
Then we'll meet our fate
'cause they're better, they've got

Perfect mind and body
