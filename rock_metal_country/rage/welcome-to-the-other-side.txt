I've been searching everywhere
Looking for the final freedom
Where there are no boundaries
When you never need a reason
Well, it has been taking me some time
'Till I've got it what I've tried to find

Now I'm the shadow of the night
The keeper of the light
The guardian of the day
I'm anywhere, nowhere
Just call me, I'll be there

Welcome to the other side
No need for a place to hide
The other side, the other side

You might find it so unreal
Nothing makes a sense in your eyes
Relativity divides
There must be a life without lies
Well, it will be taking you some time
'Till you're gonna get it what you'll find

And now you're shadow of the night
A keeper of the light
A guardian of the day
You're anywhere, nowhere
You've made it, now you're thereWelcome to the other side
No need for a place to hide
Welcome to the other side

And now you're shadow of the night
A keeper of the light
A guardian of the day
You're anywhere, nowhere
You've made it, now you're there

Welcome to the other side
No need for a place to hide
Welcome to the other side
No need for a place to hide
The other side, the other side

Well, it will taking you some time
