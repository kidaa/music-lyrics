Music & Lyrics by P.Wagner

The clouds have prepared for rain and storm
The chill of the wind has frozen all the pain
I know in my room it's dry and warm
but i cann't stand to scan the walls in vain
White and Wonderful the show covers my hair
I reached out but you're not there

In the days of December
I'm lonly ever since you're gone
In the night I remember
Your frozen hands that kept me warm
In the days of DecemberI've never seen sense in future plans
I know that the time will make it up somehow
But god how i miss you, there's no words
to tell you how it looks inside myself now

Cold and Beautiful
your vision in the ice
I reache out but you're not there

In the days of December
I'm lonly ever since you're gone
In the night I remember
Your frozen hands that kept me warm
In the days of December
