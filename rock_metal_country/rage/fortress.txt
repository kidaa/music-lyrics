3:56Music and Lyrics by P. Wagner
The wall inside, he built to defend himself.
He needs to hide, to keep independency.

The race is on, it can't be won.

A fortress in you head
one step among the dead.
Security for fear,
a fortress, caging in
for what you're here.The pain inside, disappoinments everyday.
To keep his pride he can't find a better way than
to lock his mind, though he'll lose life.

A fortress in you head
one step among the dead.
Security for fear,
a fortress, caging in
for what you're here.

A fortress in you head
one step among the dead.
Security for fear,
a fortress in you head, oh.
A fortress caging in,
unreal behind your grin.
Security is lie,
a fortress caging in until you die.
