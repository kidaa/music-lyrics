Lyrics by: P. Wagner

How many men have been killed 'cause of religion?
For example Iran and Irak, this war is going on
For more than a decade.

It is more than ridiculous how these brothers
Kill themselves for the geed of might
That their leaders covered real clever
With the name of a god

Religious             This is sinister thinking
Fanatics              Ruled by sinister thinkingThey drill this evil spirit in their children's heads
So there's no ending in sight, no

Religious             This is sinister thinking
Fanatics              Ruled by sinister thinking

Madmen, madmen
Killing their lands

In east and west      There is sinister thinking
Religious             This is sinister thinking
Fanatics              Ruled by sinister thinking
