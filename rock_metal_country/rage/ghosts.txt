My friend, I'm with you.
I'm watching every step you do.
I try to guard your way.

They're all around me,
The ones you're missing in your life.
We're never gone, no way.

We're all around you, everywhere.
Just do believe and be aware.
It's all arranged for us this way.
This is a world, that's next to yours.
You can't see us, we can see you.
The soul lives on, we're ghosts

My friend, no fear now,
This is a part of the plan.
We have to let it go.It's temporarily,
The shape just shows the status quo,
The level of the soul.

We're all around you...

Hey, this is new, it is what I have to do.
Now give me strength to face it.
Time - let me learn, getting higher, get the turn.
I'm getting closer to you.

We're all around you
