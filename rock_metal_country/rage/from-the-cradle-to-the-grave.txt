Musci by P.Wagner, S. Efthimiadis
Lyrics by P.Wagner

There is a window out of pain
but the grief will come again
swallow all the light and steal the sleep
tonight
I'll never see the day to take it all away

There was a time to play my cards
drown my anchor in the hearts
find the tracks to love and get the tricks to shove
I never found a way to make it here to stayMy world is a dark and out of touch
I'm left alone a bit too much
What you see is what you get
but when you can't there's nothing left
I'll miss it from the cradle to the grave

My world is full of mortal scenes
that blind my eyes and steal my dreams
What you see is what you get
but when you can't there's nothing left
I'll miss it from the cradle to the grave

My world is a dark and out of touch
I'm left alone a bit too much
What You see is what you get
but when you can't there's nothing left
My world is full of mortal scenes
that blind my eyes and steal my dreams
I can't see or feel it yet
and as I can't there's nothing left
I'll miss it from the cradle to the grave
I'll miss it from the cradle to the grave
I'll miss you from the cradle to the grave....
