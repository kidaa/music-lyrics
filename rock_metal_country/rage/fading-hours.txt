6:28Music and Lyrics by P. Wagner
Who tells sader stories?
Tears in broken eyes
telling 'bout the worries,
search for cure from whys.

A something to believe in, not leaving, still living.
There must have been a reason for all, she said.

Fading hours of pleasure and pain,
trust me now, it wasn't in vain.
In this life some things will remain
from fading hours.

Why didn't you answer?
You looked through me, it seemed.
It all's changed but I can't swear,
the whole scene's so unreal.I'm still an unbeliever, won't leave you,
still live here.
There must have been a reason for all, she said.

Fading hours of plesure and pain,
trust me now, it wasn't in vain.
In this life some things will remain
from fading hours.

Fading hours, but my time stood still.
My missing shadow can't explain.
But the pictures on your table will,
they're showing me pale white,
the coffin's opened wide...
I've forgotten fading hours.
