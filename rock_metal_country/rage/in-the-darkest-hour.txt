Lyrics by: P. Wagner

In the darkest hour
It is time for the truth
When you're fast asleep
In the darkest hour

A modern man, a nice gentle guy
He cuts a real smart figure from his head
To his toes
But when the night falls and the mask
Comes off him then,
He changes to a raping, pervert monster man

Like Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde

"I'm gonna get you tonight!"In the darkest hour
It is time for the truth
When you're fast asleep
In the darkest hour
The upright housewife, busy with her meals -
Things like chatting with the milkman
Are her only thrills
But when the night falls and she puts
Her stocking on,
Yeah, then she gets in heavy
With the neighbour's so

Like she's a domina tonight

"I'm gonna shoot off your balls!"
Some people hide what they are

In the darkest hour
It is time for the truth
When you're fast asleep
In the darkest hour
