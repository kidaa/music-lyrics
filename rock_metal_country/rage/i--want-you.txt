I've seen you with your mummy yesterday
you waved for me but then you couldn't stay.
Since then I've got this picture in my mind
it shows you in panties from behind.

I want to your mummy from your side

I want you, you're just the kind for me
I want you,  you bring me up indeed

Don't leave me here alone, come over now.
I know you're kinda young but well grown out.
So what about a little here and now?
Yeah right, so what?  Not yet, you know!

If mummy could see you now at my side...

I want you, you're just the kind for me
I want you, you bring me up indeed
