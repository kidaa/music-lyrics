4:34Music and Lyrics by P. Wagner
I awoke, I could not stay for more,
I tried to tell the others what I'd seen before.
No one believed me, "it's a dream" they said.
But I have seen eternity when I was dead.

Who decided who's to go and who's to stay on this old world?
This time now my path lead me to life.

There was a vision that lightened up my life
and now I know it was death that I have tried.
Although I came back I've seen the other side,
so I will never forget until I die.

I remember seeing my body lying
after the accident, my soul was drifting away,
passing darkness to a golden light
into the arms of Jesus with my fathers eyes.

He decided I'd to go and stay for longer in this world
until I have walked my path of life.

There was a vision...

There's a legion of the long - gone there,
a bundled energy of all that once were here.

No one's lost, a comfort we can share,
like a kind of existence, timeless, everywhere.

Who decided...
