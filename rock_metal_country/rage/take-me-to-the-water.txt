Music & Lyrics: P. Wagner

My blinded eyes are staring at the burning sky
There's not a cloud to throw a shadow in my way
My dried out body's got no shelter from the sun
What's coming over me, to hell, what's coming over me?

I'm stumbling through these fields of naked stones and sand
Here's nothing growing, every life has found and end
And not a drop of water that could wet my lips
What's coming over me, to hell, what's coming over me?

I'm burning for liquid
More than words can say

I can't stay in this wasteland
I'm starving, I need your hand
Take me to the water, bring me to a shore
Take me to the water, I can't take much more

I can't explain it what has happened to my land
What once were meadows now is deadly desert sand
And all my people died, our fountains, they ran dry
What did come over us, to hell, what did come over us?

We were a race of billions, trying to rule the earth
But on this planet we have done our job the worst
It seems that our evolution made no sense
What did come over us, to hell, what did come over us?

Disasters, they warned us
We did not see the signs

I can't stay in this wasteland
I'm starving, I need your hand
Take me to the water, bring me to a shore
Take me to the water, I can't take much more

We were send to a holy land, were meant to understand
Pride got us completely wrong to believe we're endless strong
Take on life and I'll take two, sort 'em out and kill anew
Hell is here, it's sad but true
When one thinks he's more than you

The blinded eyes are staring at the burning sky
The last man on this planet, left alone to die
The only hope is left to find what he was told
To find the river where the water of mercy flows

Take me to the water...
