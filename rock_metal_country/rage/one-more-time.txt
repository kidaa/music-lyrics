Good or bad, which side are you on
Make your choice
I hope you sleep well
Why can't you see
It's only a few that make profit here
Lose your voice while they sell you fear

One day too late
You're racing with the devil
My choice, your choice
We stand... our backs against the wall

Rich or poor, will you sell your soul
Make this choice or nothing at all
No one will feed you
You or me, we go where the money goes
Friend or foe, no one's getting close

Money - godlike, religion and restrictions
Madness, no more
Remember right, create the worldOne more time again it's built on sand
And one more time again ignore it
One more time again it slips through our hands
One more time again the rim of hell, you see it well

Deaf, dumb and blind, you're not concerned

One day too late
We ride the wings of death
My choice, your choice
We stand... our backs against the wall

One more time again it's built on sand
And one more time again ignore it
One more time again it slips through our hands
One more time again the rim of hell, you see it well
