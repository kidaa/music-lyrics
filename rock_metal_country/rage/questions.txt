Music & Lyrics: P. Wagner

And did they teach you love?
Yes, they did but poor and hidden.
And did they teach you death?
Yes, they did but just a part of it.

What does that mean, a part of it?
It means that they taught us how to kill
They taught it and they practised it
They never told us how to die
Death's place in life and how to face it,
See how sad they end their lives...

And if I ask these questions
What would you say if the answer's given the same time?
And if you know these questions
Why can't you see that it's more than just a state of mind?

And did they teach to hate?
Yes, they taught it and they stirred it
On the so-called enemy
Not on the own misery.

What did they do with their own lives?
They only did what you'd expect
After the lessons they had had,
They've never seen the other way
The might freedom in their minds
They will never reach their size.

And if I ask these questions
What would you say if the answer's given the same time?
And if you know these questions
Why can't you see that it's more than just a state of mind?

In a way we're data banks
Informations collectors
And all worse that we contend
Is a false program inside
We just need to get it right
Check it out what you have learned.

And you will learn to love
You will even learn to die
And you will learn 'bout hate
In a way that is meant.

And you will ask these questions...
