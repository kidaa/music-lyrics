There in the subway station, they shot him dead
He had broken the secrecy - Omerta
That's what they all will get,
They've got a job to do
The business is too important
to take a risk and so
Please don't get me wrong,
if you'd ever say a word
You'll have missed my friend,
this is what you'll get
Execution guaranteed
We are an old family, controlling the trade
Gun running for the white house. The CIA works
hand in hand with us. We must feed the flame of
hate and war in the third world, cause if they
kill themselves We deliver all they need for the
fall it's big money The all order and this is
what they get
Execution guaranteed
We choose, you loose
You - jeah, I've got a mission for you
Look - here, a list of men to execute
Shoot - you must shoot them, no one will find out
Truth - truth is a daughter of time
Execution guaranteed
The smell of danger is in the air
A few make the race but we all must pay the fare
We're to sit on a powder barrel
Waiting for the deadly blow
No one asked the silent masses
And I bet they don't know
Don't tell me this stock of arms ain't
There to be used in the end
The time has come to harvest what they've sown
There's no way forward, progress cannot grow
And they will se that they have failed
The time has passed them by, we must all pay
Just one step back could save for us the day
Why can't they see that they have failed
