Music by Wagner/Schroeder, lyrics by Wagner
Shadows are creeping - the air's so still
While you're sleeping - they're on the loose
Eyes wide open - you lie awake
You wish it was morning - but you can't choose

Chorus:
The air is full of sound
Their time has come to move
Night scenes, they scream
Night scenes...

The walls are cracking - you cannot move
Something rotten - lies next to you
Will this nightmare never end?
This is torture - man can't prevent

You are exposed for hours
To supernatural powers
Your body won't be injured
But in your mind you'll get scared

ChorusHas our fate been written in our sleep
Can we see the way we got to keep

Shadows are creeping - the air's so still
While you're sleeping - they're on the loose

The night is full of wonders
If you just like it gruesome
You hear but you can't see
A thrilling scenery

Chorus
