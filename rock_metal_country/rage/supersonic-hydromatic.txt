Lyrics by: P. Wagner

He comes in the kitchen, a smile on his face
"My dear, this will free you from all of your straits!"
And he turns on the switch and it starts to move -
This TV commercial has caught us anew

Supersonic hydromatic, nothing works without it now
Be a real progress fanatic and you will believe somehow

"Oh yeah, this must be a real innovation!"
Away with the critical mind for a sense
And he opens the purse and he pays for thing
That you only need if you're spastic and dim

Supersonic hydromatic, superultrameganew
Household furniture, like magic,
The neighbour's wife has got one, tooNo! Noone needs your offal!
This isn't worth it at all

He comes in the kitchen, a smile on his face
And he turns on the switch and it blows up!
"Instead of having a help I'm a big fool," he says

Supersonic hydromatic, nothing works without it now
Be a real progress fanatic and you will believe somehow

No! Noone needs your offal!
This isn't worth it at all

Supersonic hydromatic, nothing works without it now
Be a real progress fanatic and you will believe somehow
Supersonic hydromatic, superultrameganew
Household furniture, like magic,
The neighbour's wife has got one, too
