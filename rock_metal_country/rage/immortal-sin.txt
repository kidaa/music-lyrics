Music & Lyrics by P.Wagner

So sweet and defenceless
offeres all to my dependence
Just relax your spirit
we're all alone

Tied up in the darkness
you've forgotten you existance
waiting for the fire
and what's to come

Lost imaginations
coming back to scare the body
GOing down in fever
drawn to the flame

A sweet pain to cut the indifference
a forbidden love to come

You're immortal, you're immortal sinComing from behind you
feel the fingers reaching higher
Crawling on the floor
you won't get away

So sweet and dependet
I will offer my demands
So just relax your spirit
we're all alone

And you know you shouldn't walk this way
but you never want to hear

You're immortal, you're immortal sin

Now you're gone too far...
