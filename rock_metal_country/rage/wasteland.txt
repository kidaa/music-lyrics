Lyrics by: P. Wagner

Though it's nothing new: we still rob our planet
It's the daily truth, we interfere with everything
Annihilation of our life's space - it is such a

Wasteland
Nothing can exist without being disturbed
Civilization kills!
Wasteland
Sooner or later we'll transform a system
That's already been perfectIt's always been the same, we take
Ourselves too serious
We're not the best of all, we are just a part of it
Is there any race as destructive as we are?

Wasteland
Children are dying for what they do not see
Ideology kills!
Wasteland
Knowledge is something for people with reason,
With responsibility

Wasteland          The more we even learn
Wasteland          The less we understand
