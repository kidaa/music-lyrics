Like a kiss of evil it took hold on me.
Creeping paranoia, it will get me day by day.
Like the deadly viper with his poisoned teeth
it is getting in my blood, a killing brain desease.

Oh, no, the thrill became a curse,
oh, the right has turned to wrong.
It's just me, myself to blame,
yes I could have seen it coming.

Now I'm a wasted man
this is 'cause I am under control.
Inside a self  built cage,
screaming out the rage, under control.
Enslave my soul, I'm under control.I can't live without it and I need it now,
what is I know about it will destroy me anyhow.
I have lost my free will, it's enslaving me.
Face inside me mirror let me out and set me free.

Oh, no, the thrill became a curse,
oh, the right has turned to wrong.
It's just me, myself to blame,
yes I could have seen it coming.

Now I'm a wasted man
this is 'cause I am under control.
Inside a self  built cage,
screaming out the rage, under control.
Enslave my soul, I'm under control.
Yes, I am.
