Lyrics by: P. Wagner

Shadows in my mind, it's dead, all I had inside
bunched is the old fear, just to let a new one appear
just be quiet, my heart, and keep the peace in the dark
blossom's better than decay, there must be more for me, I can't wait

Oh, when will you leave, eternal night, you lead to the nevermore
end up this chain existence, now, the best is yet to come for me

There's light into the darkness
so come and lay down by my side
there's light into the darkness
come on and rest your mind in my arms
let me enlight your darkness
there's nothing better than a friend
give light into my darkness...

I've heard a distant voice, it said aloud the word I'm waiting for
Just keep quiet in peace, beware your heart in the dark, the word is here

Can you see the colours in the new born leaves on every tree
rescue can be found in each thing, if one just gets into it

There's light into the darkness
so come and lay down by my side
there's light into the darkness
come on and rest your mind in my arms
let me enlight your darkness
there's nothing better than a friend
give light into my darkness...

free of pain, free from doubts, free of fear

Can you see the colours in the new born leaves on every tree
rescue can be found in each thing, if one just gets into it

There's light into the darkness
so come and lay down by my side
there's light into the darkness
so let me lay down by your side
there's light into the darkness...

if I just get into it
