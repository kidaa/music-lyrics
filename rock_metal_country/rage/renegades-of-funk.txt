No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now 
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now 

We're the renegades of this atomic age 
This atomic age of renegades 
Renegades of this atomic age 
This atomic age of renegades 

Since the Prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece 
Right down through the Middle Ages 
Planet earth kept going through changes 
And then no renaissance came, and times continued to change 
Nothing stayed the same, but there were always renegades 
Like Chief Sitting Bull, Tom Paine 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Malcom X 
They were renegades of their time and age 
So many renegades 

We're the renegades of funk 
We're the renegades of funk 
We're the renegades of funk 
We're the renegades of funk 

From a different solar system many many galaxies away 
We are the force of another creation 
A new musical revelation 
And we're on this musical mission to help the others listen 
And groove from land to land singin' electronic chants like 
Zulu nation 
Revelations 
Destroy our nations 
Destroy our nations 
Destroy our nations 
Destroy our nations 
Destroy our nations 
Destroy our nations 

Now renegades are the people with their own philosophies 
They change the course of history 
Everyday people like you and me 
We're the renegades we're the people 
With our own philosophies 
We change the course of history 
Everyday people like you and me 
C'mon 
We're the renegades of funk 
We're the renegades of funk 
We're the renegades of funk 
We're the renegades of funk 

Poppin', sockin', rockin' puttin' a side of hip-hop 
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin' 
Poppin', sockin', puttin' a side of hip-hop 
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin' 
Poppin', sockin', rockin' puttin' a side of hip-hop 
'Cause we're poppin', sockin', rockin' puttin' a side of hip-hop 
Poppin', sockin', rockin' puttin' a side of hip-hop 

We're the renegades of funk 
We're the renegades of funk 
We're the renegades of funk 
We're the renegades of funk 

We're teachers of the funk 
And not of empty popping 
We're blessed with the force and the sight of electronics 
With the bass, and the treble the horns and our vocals 
'Cause everytime I pop into the beat we get fresh 

There was a time when our music 
Was something called the Bay Street beat 
People would gather from all around 
To get down to the big sound 
You had to be a renegade in those days 
To take a man to the dance floor 

Say jam sucker 
Say jam sucker 
Say groove sucker 
Say groove sucker 
Say dance sucker 
Say dance sucker 
Now move sucker 
Now move sucker
