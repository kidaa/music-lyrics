Music/Lyrics by: P. Wagner

When I remember what happened that lead me right here
what made me lonely and forced me to disappear.
There were periods in my life that came from my darkest depths, beyond the edge
like a delirium I couldn't help, I drifted aside, it wasn't right

Time, time had slipped away
life was a distant haze
this was on certain days
I, I had lost my way
got lost without a trace
this was on certain days, I went mad...

I can recall the days when things were fine
Everyone was happy enjoying their time
but the first time it came over me I had lost my friends, I did harm to them
the judges told me I was insane, I tried to kill, I tried to kill!

Time, time had slipped away
life - a distant haze
this was on certain days
I, I had lost my way
got lost without a trace
this was on certain days, I went mad...
