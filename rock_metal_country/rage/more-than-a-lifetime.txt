I sat here thinking, let my mind drift away
And what I saw was a vision of you.
Just like a movie that I saw yesterday
And now I know what I'm going to do.

I watched the hourglass on my empty wall,
Like hypnotized of the circles I'd seen.
The timeless ticking of the fingers who called
Myself to be where I wanted to be.

More than a lifetime away
More than a lifetime away
One million hours to stay
More than a lifetime awayI fly by night, I'm passing point after point.
So many places to stay invite me.
But they won't heal me, they won't rest me, I know.
I'm moving on 'till I'm going to be

More than a lifetime away...
