The world is my expense 
The cost of my desire 
Jesus blessed me with its future 
And I protect it with fire 
So raise your fists 
And march around 
Just dont take what you need 
Ill jail and bury those committed 
And smother the rest in greed 
Crawl with me into tomorrow 
Or Ill drag you to your grave 
Im deep inside your children 
Theyll betray you in my name 

Hey, Hey 
Sleep now in the fire 
Hey, Hey 
Sleep now in the fire 

The lie is my expense 
The scope of my desire 
The party blessed me with its future 
And I protect it with fire 
I am the Nina The Pinta The Santa Maria 
The noose and the rapist 
The fields overseer 
The agents of orange 
The priests of Hiroshima 
The cost of my desire 
Sleep now in the fire 

Hey, Hey 
Sleep now in the fire 
Hey, Hey 
Sleep now in the fire 

For its the end of history 
Its caged and frozen still 
There is no other pill to take 
So swallow the one 
That made you ill 
The Nina The Pinta The Santa Maria 
The noose and the rapist 
The fields overseer 
The agents of orange 
The priests of Hiroshima 
The cost of my desire 
Sleep now in the fire 

Yeaaaaaah 

Sleep now in the fire 
Sleep now in the fire 
Sleep now in the fire 
Sleep now in the fire
