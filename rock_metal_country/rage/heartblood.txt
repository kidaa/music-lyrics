Musci & Lyrics by P.Wagner

On a dusty windinf roadm luck is not for free
If you did like you were told, you will never see

Just give me your heartblood...

Can it be a sin to speak in the tonque of freedom?
You will only win if you try the best to be you

Just give me your heartblood...

Warfare in a sick society
Out there dive it all or leave it be
No fear! What do you mean - security?
Who cares about you? You'll only hear

Give me your heartblood...
