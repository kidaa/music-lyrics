4:54Music and Lyrics by P. Wagner
Here we are, we talk about too many things.
But we can't
find the words when death is on it's way.

If we don't remember this
we won't be prepare for the final day.

A silent victory, it made me see
that all is meant to be,
my dearest friend, it's not the end.

Our time is short,
our castles built on sand of make believe.
At the gates of eternity the heart is free.

And I will remember this
something's there that's stronger than our pain.

A silent victory, it made me see
that all is meant to be,
my dearest friend, it's not the end.A silence victory, it made me free
to step outside on me
and in the end I'm born again.

I reach out my hands to reality of life
far beyond all images.

And I will remember this
something's there that's stronger than our pain.

A silent victory, it made me see
that all is meant to be,
my dearest friend, it's not the end.

A silence victory, it made me free
to step outside on me
and in the end I'm born again.
