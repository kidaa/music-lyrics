Music by Wagner/Schroeder, lyrics by Wagner
I've been stumblin' through my years
All I had was sweat and tears
When I thought I had it made
I was always much too late

And throughout my whole life I've done everything wrong

Chorus:
No way out - suicide
No way out - suicide

I am loosing all I get
For myself there's just regret
And my brain, it feels so ill
Am I waiting for the kill?

What the hell's there on earth that cold keep me alive?Chorus

There's a shadow on my back
I've been taking the wrong track
Now I've gone a bit too far
I've begun a private war

All I hate is myself but I've shot someone else

Chorus
