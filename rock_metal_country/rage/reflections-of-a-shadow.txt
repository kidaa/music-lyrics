Wagner, Schmidt/Wagner
In search for personality
We people always think the clothing makes a man
In fact there's such ha difference in all
What we think and how we understand

My left is your right
Your day is my night
Their darkness is our light

Reflections of a shadow
Reflections of my mind

We're looking for externals
And the eye gets blind in insincerity
But when I hear you talking
Then your soul lies free for everyone to seeAnd what I do
Becomes my proof
Our acts draw our portraits

And in the night
We make it right
In dreams we find our light

Reflections of a shadow
Reflections of my mind
Reflections of a shadow
Reflecting in the night
