4:00Music and Lyrics by P. Wagner
I listened inside myself,
the voice that I heard, it wasn't mine,
it came from time to time.
I listened real close and I found out
that someone was talking through my mind,
told me what to find.

With every sense on highest intense
I tried to understand and I
asked in the dark
and got an answer and since then I know
I'm talking to the dead
I'm talking to the dead
You gotta hear me
talking to the dead,
I'm talking to the dead
and I can hear them talk!There are so many voices,
they all belong to different heads
and they all are dead.
They have eternal knowldge
and they will help me anytime,
they are on my mind.

With every sense on highest intense
I tried to understand and I
asked in the dark
and got an answer and since then I know
I'm talking to the dead
I'm talking to the dead
You gotta hear me
talking to the dead,
I'm talking to the dead
and I can hear them talk!
