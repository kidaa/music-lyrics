3:53Music and Lyrics by P. Wagner
Sometimes when I get this feeling
for a very subtile thing,
then I need a break, a healing
from the daily bore I'm in.

If I didn't have these moments
I'd be going crazy soon,
so I'll pack my things tonight and go.

Let the night begin,
the fall of darkness washes my sins,
the rising moon will pick me up
to find an opened mind...Yes I simply love these moments
getting lost within the night.
And my friends, the dead, will teach me
what I need to know for life.

They all made their own mistakes
but have died in early death.
I don't want to end like everyone.

Let the night begin,
the fall of darkness washes my sins,
the rising moon will pick me up
to find an opened mind..
Let the night begin,
my sight's reduced to eyes within,
the light of moon will shelter me,
so let the night begin...
