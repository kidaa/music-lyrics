Thank you, mother. Thank you for my life.
Forgive me, father. For I was running blind.

Time to prove the evolution
First to feel it, last to get.
Spiritual Awakening
Rushing through these years of madness,
Next time leave no opinions out.
Spiritual Awakening

Tell me, answer, in synchronicity.
Intuition, open doors for me.Time to push the evolution
First to feel it, last to get.
Spiritual Awakening
Rushing through these years of madness,
Never leave no opinions out.
Spiritual Awakening

Spiritual... spiritual
I never felt this way, running blind my way
I never felt this way, spiritual awake

Thank you, brother, mirror of myself.
Join me, sister, energetic well.
