Lyrics by: P. Wagner

Oh, I give a fuck
To what you say 'bout what I'm doing -
Believe it or not

Oh, you can't comprehend
What I have made but try to find out
What I've meant

Tribunal, tribunal
Oh, not me
Mighty fools make the rules
Don't try to get rid of me
Robbery, robbery
Is mentality
Machinery, machinery
Building lies, but read the truthBetween the lines
Don't you let them fool ya, see the signs of time
Between the lines
Nothing' like it seems, so read between the lines

Now the time is right
You steal the authorities' might to rule our minds

Between the lines
Don't you let them fool ya, see the signs of time
Between the lines
Nothing' like it seems, so read between the lines

Between the lines...
