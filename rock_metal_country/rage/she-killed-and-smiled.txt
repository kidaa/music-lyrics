Music & Lyrics by P. Wagner
There was an "Avenger" song called "Stay wild"
in '85.  After a major rearrangement and with
different words it sounds like this.

All the years we joined our lives
we did never regret
our decisions and the way
that we kept our heads.

When I needed you the most,
in my hour of pain,
I awoke the rudest way
my belief was in vain.

In you, as I tell you weren't there
didn't catch my fall, oh no,
now you've killed all I had.

She killed and smiled
she killed and smiled
what a beautiful death you brought, my child.

Wrath is burning in my mind,
why can't you take it back.
No excuses, no regrets,
you just broke my back.

Oh, you turned your back, shut your mouth
didn't had a word of trust love
now you've killed all I had.

She killed and smiled
she killed and smiled
what a beautiful death you brought, my child!
