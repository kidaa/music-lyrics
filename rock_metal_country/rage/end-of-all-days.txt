4:45Music by P. Wagner, S. EfthimiadisLyrics by P. Wagner
Thinking on my yesterdays,
I have failed in many ways,
but I won't complain, 'cause I
had my share when luck passed by.
Then you came into my life
and became my biggest pride.
I thought the cards had turned for me,
oh, if I knew.

And then, when this fatal moment came to be
I couldn't turn the steering wheel around...

Once I feel in love with you,
now I can't stop feeling blue.
Will I ever be the same?
Free me from this crying shame,
Hey,  you won't find me.
I'll, I'll hide 'till the end of all days.I still don't know what happened there,
my mind is blocked, I was too scared.
But they told me you had died,
now the future's out of sight.
If I could have seen it coming
I'd had turned the other way,
but then we were smashed,
our lifes were torn apart.

They can tell me a hundred times I'm not to blame.
I didn't turn the steering wheel around...

Once I feel in love with you,
now I can't stop feeling blue.
Will I ever be the same?
Free me from this crying shame,
Hey,  you won't find me.
I'll, I'll hide 'till the end of all days.
