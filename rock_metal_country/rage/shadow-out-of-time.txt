Something's happened to myself, I could never give the answer
though I did my best to find it out.
If you'd ask me where I've been the last few years I could not
tell you. Pieces of dreams mix with memories about.

Something's slipped into my body while my mind has been absent
in a nameless time, somehow I know, I know, I know it well...

Like a shadow out of time it's injected in my mind,
like a shadow out of time.
Like a vision in disguise it took hold of all my ways,
like a shadow out of time.

They have told me I've reacted like I was not from this earth.
I guess this something inside me was not.
When I've go these visions that I look down at myself I get
scared. This is not my body, but it's... what?

I have slipped in someone's shape while his mind has been absent

in my nameless time, somehow he knows, he knows, I know it well...

Somehow I have lost my memories when I returned from this journey,
you would not believe me anyway. Shadow out of time
For the rest of my life I will look for a release from this pain
but I think I'll never see the day. Shadow out of time
