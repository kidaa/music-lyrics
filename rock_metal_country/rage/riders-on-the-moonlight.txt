Nothing higher than the stars
And nothing deeper than my scars
Can show the difference between me and you

Let me take you by the hand
I'll lead you ways that never end
Yeah, I could show you if you dare to do

Danger, danger, catch the fall
The devil's painted on the wall

We're riders, riders on the moonlight
We're riders, riders on the moonlight
Riders, riders on the moonlight

If you want to taste the night
Just wait until the time is right
Then let the waves of darkness fill your mindSheltered by the shady green
We're out to see the things unseen
There ain't no thrills of any other kind

Danger, danger, heads will roll
The devil's painted on the wall

We're riders, riders on the moonlight
We're riders, riders on the moonlight
Riders, riders on the moonlight

We're lunatics, ridin'on the moonlight
Maniacs ridin'on the moonlight

We're riders, riders on the moonlight
We're riders, riders on the moonlight
Riders, riders on the moonlight
