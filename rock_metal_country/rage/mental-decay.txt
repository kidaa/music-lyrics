Knight of virtue
Men of war
Ideals of your time
Sense of duty
You've done what they expect you to do
Missiles'll save us
In Video games they do
Mental decay
I will laugh when you must cry
Mental decay
Why should I know the reason why
Mental decay
To Hell with any intellect
Mental decay Mental decay
What to do with all this time?
There's a hole in my life
Go out hunting
The pleasure to kill
Don't like strangers
Without beer I've got no fun
Repeat 2nd verse
Apathy in friendship, stupidity at work
Keep faith in tradition, the orders from above
Your fancy dies on T.V.,
your conscience on the way
You'll be vegetating right up to your final day
Repeat 1st verse
Hunger for life,
Joy of risk
Future perspectives died
Take a look at those decrepit pensioners
They fuss around to make believe they're alive
They hate everyone just
because they're all so young
The lividness in their faces
