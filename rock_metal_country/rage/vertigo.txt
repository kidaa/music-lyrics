Music & Lyrics by P. Wagner
Look into my eyes and sink deeper
look into my eyes,
drown into my will like a sleeper,
drown into my eyes.
Now you feel as light as a feather,
leave it all behind.
Strip your mind of all that encaged you,
forget about the time.

And from the first sight to the last
the world is tumbling into vertigo.

I can lead you, ways to explore you,
ways you'd never find.
I can make you mine if I want to,
you'd make up my mind.
Feel these healing hands,
eyes of fire, magic pendulum
makes you dizzy at first sight,
now my time has come.And from the first sight to the last
the world is tumbling into vertigo.

Oh, something touched you deep inside
oh, take hold of a distant light
oh, hypnotised, feels like vertigo
