Lyrics by: P. Wagner

Flying high, setting signs
we got the future in our veins
but still a long way to go

All we know has lost its size
if you're looking down from space.
Your problems are unreal at one blow

Does it make a sense at last
to learn the mistakes of the past?
Infected with an old disease

And today tomorrow waits
in another galaxy.
Waiting to take us awayWe are the only truth?
How can we be so smug
like a child playing God...
I wish I knew
is it still far to go - -Invisible horizons
What is behind
the picture in my mind - Invisible horizons

It is many ages away
a life that's far beyond our rays
that we send out to get a sign

A million places there to be
it's only logical, you see
that we're not the centre of creation

We are the only truth?
How can we be so smug
like a child playing God...
I wish I knew
is it still far to go - -Invisible horizons
What is behind
the picture in my mind - Invisible horizons
