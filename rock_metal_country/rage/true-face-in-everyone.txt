Wagner, Schmidt/Wagner
Death in the night, murder,
robbery, the violence
Is our daily bread, there is a
common tense

Kids in the street feeling cool, they killed the neighbour's cat
They cannot feel respect for life.
Now what if they were dead?
Man in the dark killed the feelings of the girl next door
Raping her for a shot, now she can't trust a man no more

In every twisted mind
There's something still behind
Humanity lives on
Forever in the
True face in everyone, conscience can't lie
True face in everyone, facing the lies

Man at the front shooting brothers in the name of God
Preachers, generals lead their countries into death
Mindgames called religion, ideology
Set above life and the industry is feeding it for cash

Reason to survive
The spirit is alive
The meaning of the things
Perception is the
True face in everyone, time after time
True face in everyone, conscience can't lie
True face in everyone, time after time
True face in everyone, facing the lies
