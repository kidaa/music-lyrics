Music & Lyrics by P. Wagner
During the sessions for "Missing Link" we wrote
an instrumental song on this somber theme.
It's finished now.  The words were written at the
beginning of the Yugoslavian war.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
Oh Lord Jesus, come down from your cross
see what's going on, see what's going on.
And meanwhile your land is getting lost,
take your brother home, he is dead and gone.

The house is burning, man stopped turning
compromising, paralysing, what a drag

He had held his hand wide open
but his neighbor left it out
long forgotten wounds break open
I can't help you watching out
I have seen no sign of lifeHey, you soldier, spare your sister's life
don't turn out the light, don't you be afraid.
Don't leave this land mine here in our street
this is not a job, killing people's not a job.

Man is burning, world stopped turning
terrorizing, compromising not at all.

He had held his hand wide open
but his neighbour left it out
long forgotten wounds break open
I can't help you watching out
I have seen no sign of life
