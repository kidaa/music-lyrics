How can I trust you with your human nature
With all the dues that you don't want to pay
Between polarities of good and evil
You make decisions, trying to find your way

I'm coming back to you
Don't worry - I'll be coming over you

Don't you play this game of treason
It will all come back to you
So you better tell me no lies

You cannot fool me 'cause I know it better
I've seen it all, I've watched them come and go
I'm gonna be for you a painful lesson
I will fulfill for you the karmic lawI'm coming back to you
Don't worry - I'll be coming over you

Don't you play this game of treason
It will all come back to you
So you better tell me no lies
We will meet again next season
Then it will come back to you
So you better tell me no lies

I'm coming back to you
Don't worry - I'll be coming over you

Don't you play this game of treason
It will all come back to you
So you better tell me no lies
We will meet again next season
Then I'm coming over you
So you better tell me no lies
Don't you ever tell me no lies
