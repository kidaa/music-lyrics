Wagner, Schmidt/Wagner
Do you know, it scared me to death
When I first saw you right after this
Your face so pale on that sheet in that chest
Really, man, it scared me to death

They called in the morning
Told me you had died last night
I cried my eyes out
The sorrow blinded me for light

Like flowers that fade in my hands

Everywhere I feel your presence
I've grown since you left, you must be inside me
Sometimes I hear you talking
though my mouth
And sometimes I know you're seeing through my eyes

The father I once knew
Has become a close friend
The skill in my hand
It makes me understand that we're

Like flowers that fade in my handsMother said you would have liked
To stay a little longer
I don't want to think about
What could have been or not

Now I know you haven't gone
You're still here by my side
Into every straw of grass
Or in the fading light

I wouldn't mind to follow you
Any time or day
And inbetween, I've gotta go
A long and winding way

Now I know that death has no scares
Within the remains I've got my share
And I know my death has no scares
There is no mysterium for someone who dares to die

And when I'm with you
Next to the flowers on your grave
It's such a comfort
To feel the earth that leads to you

Like flowers that grow from you hands...
