No excuses, nothing can be done
This time it's coming to an end
And the truth is that I'm on the run
Loneliness is my only friend

Out there I see them staring at me, leaving me to die
Out there I feel they're scared about me, wanting me to die

Time is turning, it has passed me by
Unwanted, now the truth has died
The stake is burning, heaven is denied
The world prefers to blind their eyes

Out there I see them staring at me, leaving me to die
Out there I feel they're scared about me

I'm crucified, I'm crucified
And before the day is done, I'm crucified
Sacrificed to everyone, I'm crucified
I am every mother's son
I'm crucified, I'm crucified

Pointed fingers, gossip in the back
They shoot the bullet from behind
Cut the wings of those who try to fly
The devil's walking hand in hand

I'm crucified, I'm crucified
And before the day is done, I'm crucified
Sacrificed to everyone, I'm crucified
I am every mother's son
I'm crucified, I'm crucified
