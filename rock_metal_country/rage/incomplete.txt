Musci by P.Wagner, C. Wolff
Lyrics by P.Wagner

Here I am still I try to find out where I'm really now
What has been I have laid it down forgotten on a shelf
An old pair of shoes I've grown out

There's never enough to take when you're
running away from emptiness

My days seem like wasted. I'm incomplete
I'm grieving, believe in the change in me
I'm lost alone and incompleteNow You're gone, I send my spirit out to
wander all the time
And my flesh, it is waiting for a time to be realised
All in one's hand , a touch at least

Confusion, nothing real
I'm lost without, I feel I'm almost gone

My days seem like wasted. I'm incomplete
I'm grieving, believe in the change in me
I'm lost alone and incomplete
