Music/Lyrics by: P. Wagner

An antarctic land, deadly unknown
where we explored a mountain range
and on the highest ridge we found remains of buildings
like no man's eye had ever seen

A city forgotten on top of the world
and entry we found in a stonewall
and walked a stairway built aeons ago
to streets and houses covered under ice and snow

Walls that had mosaics with pictures and reliefs
faces that no eyes'd ever seen, l like half flesh and half of steel
they had headphones stuck to their skulls
no muscles, just wires, a technical pulse

The creatures look weird, scary and strange
the art on the walls, it told us their tale
They came from a planet lightyears away from here
to bring knowledge, truth and culture to this undeveloped place
the fathers out of space

Before life crept out of water mother earth was occupied
but the climate changed the borders, now they are lost in the ice
Now they are lost in the ice, lost in the ice

They build up life from desert and stones
Our planet grew up helped by elder ones
Then the ice came and they had to move away
to the middle earth and then the stories on the pictures ended
when they had left the land

Before life crept out of water mother earth was occupied
but the climate changed the borders, now they are lost in the ice
Now they are lost in the ice, lost in the ice

All their buildings, streets and stonewalls sleep in this forgotten place
but what happened to the creatures when they were lost in the ice
Now they are lost in the ice, lost in the ice

What a strange and awful vision for us all
it made us shiver to the bone
what if now some of these creatures still survived
in the caves under the Pole?

Before life crept out of water...

And then we walked beneath the city, hours and hours
when suddenly we heard a strange and distant sound
all I remember is my flight from this dark place
a flight from the alien creature's face, my ancestor from space

Lost in the ice

Whoever was these old remains, his blood is flowing in my veins
is flowing in my veins
