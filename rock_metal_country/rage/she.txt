Lyrics by: P. Wagner

Hey, I know someone who's got a real special love.
She is made of sheet metal, her name's Christine.

She takes sweet revenge
hunt them till the end

She's a lady in red varnish and shining chrome
She's alive and she's more jealous than girls in flesh and blood
All the other guys don't like him, so one night
they are smashing Christine, but she gets up again.

She takes sweet revenge
hunt them till the end

She's a lady in red varnish and shining chrome
She's alive and she's more jealous than girls
in flesh and blood

There she's waiting behind the corner,
fixing them with her blinding lights.
They won't escape out of this misty night alive
and she won't come to harm...

She is keeping him from all his friends away.
He is getting more paranoid each day.

She takes sweet revenge hunt them till the end

She's a lady in red varnish and shining chrome
He's a wreck and he's more jealous than boys in flesh and blood

He takes sweet revenge
hunt them till the end.
