Music & Lyrics: P. Wagner

Oh, never, you can't hear me
Once in a while surely will come a day
When tiny symptoms grow to might pain

I built you up, you bring me down
What can I do just to make you see
That an early warning's meant to avoid the worst?

I am your friend, you live through me
I am your body, you only go me
Why don't you treat me like it's meant to be?

Oh, never, you can't hear me
Oh, though all the time you're near me
Once in a while surely will come a day
When tiny symptoms will grow to mighty pain

Oh, never, you can't hear me
Oh, though all the time you're near me
Soon in a time, then you will not refuse
You got to listen when the body talks!
Do what you like, but what it is
Please do not use me like if I was machine, I am not

I need respect and I'm worth it
If you would care for me just in a way that you care for your car
Oh, never, you can't hear me...

Give me something to keep me strong,
I don't want poison or drugs
Keep me working, then give me rest or I'll die

Oh, never, you can't hear me...
