All is grey, grey today,
Today I don't want to stay.
What I say, what you say
Is not getting through to me.

It vanished in haze,
I'm falling from the grace,
This is another of those days.
All vanished in haze, vanished in haze.

Bitter face, empty eyes.
There has been so many smiles.
But my lips - paralysed,
Poisoned heart and poisoned mind.

It vanished in haze...Give me time, let me go,
There's so much I couldn't show.
Leave my will to the flow,
More to be as I will grow.

It vanished in haze...

It's allright, it is good,
There's a lot I've understood.
We will get what we need,
All is meant to be complete.
