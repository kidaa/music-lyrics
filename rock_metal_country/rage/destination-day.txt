Music & Lyrics by P. Wagner
There was a totally different version of this on
our first "Avenger" demo in '83, in fact only
the chorus remains...

Read in the bible what's written there'll one
day come true 'bout the end of the world an
all life and all things that we knew.
The reaper is sharpening his scythe,
this is the end of your body
and day will be night.

The sun will fade its light away
the good will go, the bad must stay.

On the destination day
when all life is blown away
on the destination day
there is no more use in praying.

Nuclear power will soon
bring all mankind to fall
they destroy all their land just for cash
and they don't care at all.
Ashes to ashes dust to dust
Your body is covered with lava,
torn up from earth's crust.

The sea will overflow the land
and you will die then hand in hand

On the destination day
when all life is blown away
on the destination day
when all life is blown away
on the destination day
there is no more use in praying.
