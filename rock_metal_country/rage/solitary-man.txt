Since a while I thought 'bout leaving here
I can see no way to get it clear
Under you I feel misunderstood
In this respectable neighbourhood

Hey, don't look for me no more
'Cause I won't be coming home

I'm just a solitary man
I'm gonna leave you now alone
Well, I'm a solitary man
I feel so strange here, do you know?

I have heard they're tellin' tales 'bout me
Find me weird and most unusually
Can't you see that I'm just doing my way?
Live it out what you all just pretendI don't need no company
If I did I'd look for better

I'm just a solitary man
I'm gonna leave you now alone
Well, I'm a solitary man
It may seem strange to you, I know

I don't need this bullshit anymore
I'm stepping out, I'm gonna close the door
Will I ever reach the point of it
When I wear a suit that does not fit?

I'm just a solitary man...
