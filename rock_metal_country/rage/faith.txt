Wagner, Schmidt/Wagner
Please stay here, don't run away and slam the door
I think we got to talk it over just once more
Are we ever right in the face of the big truth?
So why fighting for a lie?

Don't lose your faith
Whatever comes to you
Cause time works for those who believe
We'll get it right anew

Don't you lose your faith
Don't every turn away
I'm thinking about the truth there is
Forgotten in a lie

We are branches on the tree of life. We can
Only get together by touching with our leaves
But we got the same roots close in ourselves
So let's grow up to the skyDon't you lose your faith
Don't ever turn away
I'm thinking about the trust there is
Forgotten in lie

Don't you lose your faith
Whatever comes to you
Cause time works for those who believe
We'll get it right anew

Like a story or a song
Sleeping till it will be sung
Our future lies unfolded
Let's forget it when we've done us wrong

After all you've put me through
There is always something new
Got to face the tests of time
Guess there's nothing me that we can do
