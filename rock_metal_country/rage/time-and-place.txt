Lyrics by: P. Wagner

When my time to die has come,
Where will be the time and the place
To return from eternal space
Like a shadow out of time

Everything that lives on earth
Has got a mind to start once again
When a life has passed
Beginning and end, they go hand in hand

And when I'm gone, what will become of me,
an animal or a man?
Where'll be the time and the placeIn this endless cycle
Noone gets lost

Tiny like dusts we're whirled away
In oceans of the universe

Where'll be the time and the place,
Time and place

Caught in time and place
