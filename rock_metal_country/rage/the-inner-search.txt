Lyrics by: P. Wagner

You've got a right to take what life offers you
don't let others mark out your scope
You better break out from all what chained you up
there is more to be than they said

The inner search needs more than words
Just hear the call for the inner search
You can hear a lot, but to understand
let the confusing voices die first
blow the flickering light out that's in your head
see the one that's always been there

The inner search needs more than words
Just hear the call for the inner search

That you are is yours, belongs just to you
to noone else, to no man, to no god
Keep your own truth in yourself as the only light
and be your own hope and a fear cannot get ya, get ya...

No point in revealing your fate for what you hate
be true to yourself, it's your responsibility

No point in believing that gods can help you out
it's your inner voice leading you to the right choice

Get up for a sense, take your life in your own hands
hear your inner voice leading you to the right choice
That you are is yours, belongs just to you
to noone else, to no man, to no god
Keep your own truth in yourself as the only light
and be your own hope and a fear cannot get ya, get ya...

The inner search needs more than words
Just hear the call for the inner search
