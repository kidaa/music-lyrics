4:55Music and Lyrics by P. Wagner
Oh, can't you tell me what makes me fell this way?
It's overwhelming, obscuring all my days.

Give me a reason to carry on for more.
The change of season, it undermines my core.
A constant darkness coating me,
I cannot see you, no more...

Excuse me for the things I've said,
if I could change it I'd be glad,
it is just, it drives me to desperation,
to desperation.There's no solution, I'm heading for the end.
The consecution is lying in my hand.
A constant streaming, opening me.
I cannot feel you, no more...

Forgive me all the things I've made
for peace of mind, now it's too late,
it is just, it drives me to desperation.

Excuse me for the things I've said,
if I could change it I'll be glad,
it is just, it drives me to desperation,
to desperation.
