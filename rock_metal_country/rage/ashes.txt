P.  Wagner/P. Wagner
With every new record we've got some songs leftover.
"Ashes" is from October '88 and was written during the
sessions for "Secrets..."

Have you ever heard 'bout the people who burned
Somehow immediately down with no reason at all,
They didn't play with fire, they had no deathwish and it
happened in a few minutes, it destroyed them completely

Just like Dr. Bentley, when they found him there was no smoke
nor a spell but the ceiling was burned,
They found his right leg and the morning gown,
It was still intact but the doctor had gone

What's this fire that burns the wires?
Death by fire from the wires

There was nothing left.  They found only ashes on the ground
Noone could explain,
Noone would believe it.

It's a phenomenon that's not often been seen,
Like an inner heat burns the body complete.
This is still a riddle that cuts us down to size
We are still quite helpless in our modern days.

What's this fire that burns the wires?
Death by fire from the wires

There was nothing left.  They found only ashes on the ground
Noone could explain,
Noone would believe it.

There was nothing left.  They found only ashes on the ground
In this cdase it seems that our rules are not worth a dime.

No way to run and hide
the flames come from inside
