Music by Wagner/Schroeder, lyrics by Wagner
I tell you Jesus Christ was just an ordinary man
But he was wise, much wiser than the rest

The few to see wrote tales 'bout him but time perverted
it all
The banner's changed, the world ain't changed at all
Forced to fight for law and order
In the name of God to slaughter

Living in this world could be a life in hell
They're around everywhere, can't you tell?

Echoes of evil

You know, they don't know what it is when they talk
'bout the law
The rights are wrong when only riches rule
You hear them say we're civilized but still blacks are
slaves
When money talks they won't hear all the cries

Forced to fight with law and order
In the name of God to slaughter

Dying at the front is tradition, you know
Just like fathers and grandfathers didEchoes of evil

We're men - we're bound to fail but we can learn it
The ones who never face it will stay blind
We gained too much by science but we can't use it
Prepare your mind to stop before it's to late

The preacher's done the rites of Christ for a thousand
years or more
Believes in personified gods
Does he fear waking up to see it's not so easy
Opposing good 'n' bad as he did?

Forced to fight with law and order
In the name of God to slaughter

What is religion - shit in your brain
A blade of straw in oceans of life
Don't follow leaders, no matter what side
Though it's harder to live your ideals

There are echoes of evil
