Wagner/Wagner
What can I do when the sadness comes through?
I'd better stay asleep inside my bed
When every word could be causing a hurt
I'd better keep the silence than to speak
Won't someone help me cause I just can't make my mind up to escape

Morning, another day
Still I'm fighting for a wink of sleep
The clock rings and I must begin
But I feel so broken, I could weep
And I find it hard to stay awake
Just to make a step costs all my will
I get no power from a shower, I
wont' make it in an hour
And my body's aching, am I ill?

Oh, just let me out
I've tried so hard, I can't get out
I just can't get out, my state of
mind won't let me out

Daytime I'm coming round
And the first thing that I hear is bad
Then I start to worry everyone around me
And I'm angry and I'm feeling sad
I'm screaming I am fighting with
the people that get in my way
I'm running and I'm pushing and
I'm crying and I'm crushing
My depression made again my day

Oh, just let me out
I've tried so hard, I can't get out
I just can't get out, my state of
mind won't let me out

Can't get out

Awakening this morning
Trying to get the sleep outta my eyes
Here it is again... again...
