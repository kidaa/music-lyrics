4:44Music by P. Wagner, S. EfthimiadisLyrics by P. Wagner
From the beginning you learned that we all have to die.
You got so used to the fact that you don't wonder why.
you don't ask:
how does it feel to someone when the moment has come?
When all is taken away, an existence is gone, who'll be his guide?

Take his soul and take his mind
and his opened eyes stay blind.

Forever - you know there was someone inside,
the smile on these lips don't seem right.
Forever's a very long time.
Forever - these cheeks growing colder and grey,
a smile that is fading away.
Forever's a very long time.

You know it happens a thousand times every day.

You can't imagine you might be the next, you don't want to care.
But Lady luck is a bitch, won't stay at one place twice,
wipes a curl from your eye and kisses you goodbye, bye bye...

Leaves your soul and leaves your mind
and your broken eyes stay blind.

Forever....

So take good care of what you say.
It might be coming back one day.
So take good care of what you do.
This chance might be the last for you.

Forever - forever and ever, forever's a very long time.
