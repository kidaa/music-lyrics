Glomeration of the four's constructiviness
An intelligental substance permanent
I sensed the elemental tenderness
In the mind, in Nature's argument

To breed, to grow, to peak, to be reborn
Like a sine curve in an endless loop
The day's crescendo dusk adorn
A process ending in the crescent's droop

An example of what the substantial quartet can procreate
Synchronized they operate

Water feed earth's production
While fire is fed by air's viability
Which compose water's construction
The flux that strengthen earth's ability

Nature's own artful methodology
Where downfall becomes the interlude
Laws, which bases our current cosmology
Completing the constant vicissitude

From storm-beaten mountains to calm-running rivers
As old as the planets rotation
A work of an unknown intellact delivers
The symbiosis, the perfect combination

Water feed earth's production
While fire is fed by air's viability
Which compose water's construction
The flux that strengthen earth's ability

Still though. provoken by a fifth force
A dark companion, Vacuum, Devastation
But somehow the harmony stays on course
With the quartet's unity as profane creator

The result, arrangements filtered through our eyes
Several polarities evolveed into a symmetrical guise

To breed, to grow, to peak, to be reborn
Like a sine curve in an endless loop
The day's crescendo dusk adorn
A process ending in the crescent's droop
