The guest of omniscience
Forthright eloquence
To behold the end of horizon
Observation of foresights
Inhaling circulations of the soul

The aura of stars, the fusion of frequencies
Measure of all, the blur of the frame that ceases

The certitude of generations adherent
Porpotual folkways of the soul sphere
I grant my visions, the burden I bear

The aura of stars, the fusion of frequences
Measure of all, the blur of the frame that ceases

I am midst by the cause of reality
Entwined by the senses of fantasy

I have walked through fields of grievance
Eras of spiritual fragmentation
I have walked through the wood's of peasants
Dawn of the souls solar morning

The certitude of generations adherent
Porpotual folkways of the soul sphere
I grant my visions, the burden I bear

The guest of omniscience
Forthright eloquence
To spear the hallow star
Conservation of the solar fuse
Exhaling circulations of the soul

The aura of stars, the fusion of frequences
Measure of all, the blur of the frame that ceases

I have fallen through spheres of diversity
Eras of ending spiritual solemnity
Opened the gate of ion fire
The warming well of wisdom

Soul sphere - the fusion of senses 
Soul sphere - the pulse of energy
Reflection of a soul's tear
Soul sphere - the fusion of senses
Soul sphere - the pulse of energy

 I am the soul in the sphere. The sphere of the heir 

The certitude of generations adherent
Porpotual folkways of the soul sphere
I grant my visions, the burden I bear
