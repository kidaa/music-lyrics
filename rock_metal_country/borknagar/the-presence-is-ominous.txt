Prior to the forces of primacy
Concealed by the essence, the profane
Withdraws in manners of erosion
Spine of the universal conflicts 

Swept towards a new domain
Reversed in time, proceed in time
Swallowed by dimensions
Swallowed by the flames 

I see fear so clear in the eyes
The eyes that burn by sight
I see fear so clear when you die 

The cries that torches swept by
I am yet to see the good victorious
Thunder tamed by silence
I am yet to see the man victorious
Death tamed by life 

Swept towards a new domain
Reversed in time, proceed in time
Swallowing dimensions
Swallowing the flames 

I see fear so clear in the eyes
The eyes that burns by sight
I see fear so clear when you die 

Spine of the universal comfilcts
As the motion of winds and oceans
I am on the isle of existence,
the mountains at my trail
I am prepared to die,
when the faith comes around to fail 

Swept towards a new domain
Reversed in time, proceed in time
Swallowing dimensions
Swallowing the flames 

I see fear so clear in the eyes
The eyes that burns by sight
I see fear so clear when you die
