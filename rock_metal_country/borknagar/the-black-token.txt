Behold the furious river
The river that comes with the time
Like a burning flood
A flood in the shape of every kind

 From the mountains to the shores
Trembling aflame within the core

I have come as far as the end now
To an existence where my soul belong
My cells forever redeemed
Recalling, the thorn so long gone

I have got an eagles freedom
And stormy power
I have got godly wisdom
And the silence of a flower

I am passing the orifice beyond
To the material origin, the elementary black

Behold the stunning blackness
Where the raging chaos steam
Like a token of flood
The dream that faces everyone
From the mountain to the shores
Still, trembling aflame within the core
