I was born a fragment of future
Raised by the dawn of existnece
I grew as one with the elements
Shown the cause of extinction 

I have seen worlds bloom to explode
And horizons flush into voids of fire and ice 

I have seen worlds explode to bloom
The dawn, the existence and the fall
I was raised by the dawn of existence
Breathing the fire of every sun 

I was born a fragment of future
Raised by the dawn of existence
I turned grey in the storm shadows
Showing the cause of extinction 

The substance of invicible motion
is invincible as the substance in motion 

We rise again as you fall
I have seen life extinct to bloom
