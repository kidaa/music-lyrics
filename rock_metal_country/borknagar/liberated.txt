From every human complexity
And nature's twisted analogy
An urge to explain - to understand
Springs out with the nation to expand
The narrow view of what we are

Could a mathematical formula
Improve our existential stamina
Would explaining our kin universally
Keep up our vital vivacity
Or would it onshroud us in disillusion

The notion of our emancipation
Lies far from any genuine liberation
Seeking a detailed explanation
We think therefore we're cursed

As questions multiply with every solution
The  why  stands untouchable - no intrusion
A constant flow of total inconstancy
A natural starfelt divinity

Could a mathematical formula
Improve our existential stamina
Would explaining our kin universally
Keep up our vital vivacity
Or would it onshroud us in disillusion

The notion of our emancipation
Lies far from any genuine liberation
Seeking a detailed explanation
We think therefore we're blessed

A Machiavellian way of thought
In struggle with all that society sought
A full explanation's the king of our dreams
To know: what's our role in the scheme of schemes
Where is our place in this order of chaos

The notion of our emancipation
Lies far from any genuine liberation
Seeking a detailed explanation
We think therefore we are
