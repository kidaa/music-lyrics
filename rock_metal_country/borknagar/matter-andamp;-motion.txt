Forged by time on the last of eternity
Complex constructions - a stellar fraternity
Spread out on a canvas of deepest black
The white glowing softness a fierce attack

That odious draught: insufficiency
Touched man as he climbed himself mentally
Alone with his newborn dexterity
Came death to his fear - a corollary
Of the fact that the stars never sensed his presence

The very maxim of the universe
Portrayed by the greatness the stars rehearse

Even Narcissus would drown in the sky
If his eyes ever rose from the mirror ponds
This radiant image, a stellar high
Eternally feeding the gnostions:  why 
To which every nightsky's a vast response

A pursuance of that very first creation
Expansion and a constant alteration
The fringos of the canvas always stir
The boundary is bathing in a blur

Forged by time on the last of eternity
Complex constructions - a stellar fraternity
Spread out on a canvas of deepest black
The white glowing softness a fierce attack

Always moving
Searching for patters
Digging for angles
Clutching at straws, climbing in air
Opening doors, closing windows

Swirling
Expanding in our world
And outside
