Mountains higher than mind can fly
Oceans deeper than sorrow
A distance of furious dreams
Random fields of tension
Where the sun comes blinding
When the moon goes hiding

I have seen the chaos in every course
Followed the solar dimensions of time
I have seen all the rivers stream
Yes, back to the end of the circle

Rivers longer than blood can flow
Horizons wider than complete wisdom
A distance of furious dreams
Isolated fields in convulsive motion

A distance of furious dreams
Random fields of tension
Where the moon comes glaring
When the sun goes dying

I have seen the chaos in every course
Followed the solar dimensions of time
I have seen all the rivers stream
Yes, back to the end of the circle

I can smell the air
I can taste the soil
I can tame all fire
I can spill all the water
I am the spine of the reversal nature
The blinding forces of complete defeat

Trace the universal steps
The shores by the course
