I fed the fire with my flesh and desire
Spilt the blood upon existence
Tracing trails, a furious tail 

Barely touching the mirror of reality
The deformation of what depression denote
A spiritual fusion, drown in conclusions
Derail the path, the course that... 

The solar solace within the hideous
Here upon the heralds of dawn
The dawn of eternity
A northern notability 

Revoke the reviavl of revolt
Burn the treason, the trinity
Yearn the heat of the fire
Face yesterdays tomorrow
The heralds of the past
The winds of a history cast
The profound spiritual fusion
Glimpse inward to my world 

A fragment of fire, hordes of imagery
An illumination of all illustrations 

The solar solace within the hideous
Here upon the heralds of dawn
The dawn of eternity
A northern notability 

Barely touching the mirror of reality
The deformation of what depression denote
A spiritual fusion, drown in conclusions
Derail the path, the course that... 

I fed the fire with my flesh and desire
Spilt the blood upon existence
Tracing trails, a furious tail
To the centre of chaos 

Burn the treason, the trinity
Yearn the heat of the fire
Face yesterdays tomorrow
The heralds of the past
The winds of a history cast
The profound spiritual fusion
Glimpse inward to my world
