Temptation impales the vulnerable
Transforming the breed as it strains to erase
Cleansing the body and perfecting the bliss
Falling further into its hypnosis 

Absurd scenery of strenght and endurance
The mundane edeavours for the perfect resistance
Evolution axis bent. Manipulation results
Contrast condemns and the answer insults 

Genesis torn
Enigma solved
Utopia found
Euphoria born 

Expanding origin stagnates at last
Bows down in unity when paradise is lost
Dirt grows in catharsis - raise of the inbred
Totality rejects the efforts of the misled 

Genesis torn
Enigma solved
Utopia found
Euphoria born 

Extinction embraces the crippled presence
Altered away from the salvaging renaissance
