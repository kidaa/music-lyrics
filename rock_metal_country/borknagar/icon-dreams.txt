The energy of the wisdom haze
Rinses the tide as a blend of fire
Upon the shores, where fires blaze
The pulse of time, shades of light 

Plains stroked by the slumber sleep
Mountains embraced by rafting time
Swept into a new horizon
The source of life, the course at sight 

Rise into a liquid dream
Where horizons burn, burn till dawn
My domain 

Where horizons burn, burn till dawn
Rise into a liquid dream
Where the mountains groan, groans till dawn 

The energy of the wisdom haze
Rinses the tide as a blend of fire
Upon the shores, where fires blaze
The pulse of time shades of light
