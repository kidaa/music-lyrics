The very maxim of the universe
Portrayed by the greatness the stars rehearse
Premeditated by nature's sense
A modest exuberance so intense
That every mind has failed to grase it

Forged by time on the last of eternity
Complex constructions - a stellar fraternity
Spread out on a canvas of deepest black
The white glowing softness a fierce attack
On every space still to be filled by matter

A pursuance of that very first creation
Expansion and a constant alteration
The fringes of the canvas always stir
The boundary is bathing in a blur
