Well on a train, I met a dame
She rather handsome
We kinda look the same
She was pretty
From new york city
Im walkin down that old fair lane
Im in heat, Im in love
But I just couldnt tell her so

[Chorus:]
I said, train kept a rollin all night long
Train kept a rollin all night long
Train kept a rollin all night long
Train kept a rollin all night long
With a heave, and a ho
But I just couldnt tell her so, no, no, no

Well, get along
Sweet little woman get along
On your way
Well, get along
Sweet little woman get along
On your way
Im in heat, Im in love
But I just couldnt tell her so, no, no, no

Sweet little woman get along
On your way
Well, get along
Sweet little woman get along
On your way
Im in heat, Im in love
But I just couldnt tell her

Well, we made a stop in albequerque
She musta thought
I was a real cool jerk
Got off the train, and put her hands up
Lookin so good, I couldnt let her go
But I just couldnt tell her so

[Chorus:]
Im in heat, Im in love
But I just couldnt tell her
