Talk about things and nobody cares
Wearing other things that nobody wears
Ya callin' my name, but I gotta make it clear
Can't say where I'm gonna be in a year.

Some sweat hog mama with a face like a gent
Said my get up and go musta got up and went.
You got good news but you're a real good liar 
Cause backstage lover set your pants on fire. 

Sweet emotion [2x]

Pulled into town in a police car 
Your daddy said I took you just a little too far.
Tellin' other things, but your girlfriend lied 
Can't catch me cause the rabbit done died.

Standin' in front just shakin' your ass.
Take you back stage you can drink from my glass.
Talk about something you can sure understand 
Cause a month on the road and i'll be eatin' from your hand.
