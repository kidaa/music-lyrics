Write me a letter
Write me a letter
Write it today
I'm goin' away
Well I've been away forever
Suicide's crossin' my mind
But I'll never get so far behind
I said, the ways of the night are evil
Without that lord of day
But I'll never get so far away
I said write me
Write me
Write me
Well there's nothin' I can see that'd ever make me want to be
Without her
She good, she good to me
Said there's no way to explain the kind of feeling that you get out
In the
She good, she good to me
She good, she good to me
I love her
Well I've been so many places
Hidin' from the wind and the rain
But you could write me a letter
For to save me from a-goin' insane
