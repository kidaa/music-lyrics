Na na na na 

She gave you a flower 
The one that god gave her 

You all up in the kool aid 
But you do not know de flavor 

Get into the zone baby 
And do yourself a favor 

Head down spin around 
Get a little refried 

If that don't get it 
You can ketch it on the b side 

Just push play 
Fna fuckin' a 
Just push play 
They're gonna bleep it anyway 
Just push play 
Fna fuckin' a 
Just push play 
We're comin' at you anyway 

Sweet leaf dreamer 
You been smokin' up the ganja 

Damned if you do yeah 
But don't get any on ya 

Kickin' off the cashmere 
Puttin' on the kasbah 

It's a kiss a diss 
And trade it for a coo hah 

Just push play 
Fna fuckin' a 
Just push play 
They're gonna bleep it anyway 
Just push play 
Fna fuckin' a 
Just push play 
We're comin' atcha anyway 

Instead of growin' old all dapper and neat 
I'm gonna grow my hair right down to my feet 
It's you and me baby no pimp daddy jack 
It's cadillac wack no cadillac wack back 

Just push play 
Fna fuckin' a 
Just push play 
They're gonna bleep it anyway 
Just push play 
Fna fuckin' a 
Just push play 
We're comin' atcha anyway 
Na na na na na 

Fna fuckin' a 
They're gonna bleep it anyway 
Walk this way 
We're comin' atcha anyway 

Just push play 
Fuckin' a 
Just push play 
They're gonna bleep it anyway 
S'il vous plait 
Fuckin' a 
Just push play 
We're comin' atcha anyway 

Tell me what i say 

Walk this way 

Fuckin' a 
We're comin' atcha anyway
