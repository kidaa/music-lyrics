I got a wild thing for you 
We're talking hoops you got me jumping through
You got those lemon drop martini eyes
And if my karma suits you'd cross
The line into another place and time

Tell me how pretty she is when she turns the colors of the rainbow
One more day with you trip hoppin'
One more night with you no stoppin'
Ain't no smoking fantasy 'cause lovin' you is trippin' to me

You got me cycled in size 
You got my situation bonified
It took a sunset to get me to see
That all I really needed was your love to 
Yeah, forever shine on me

You promised promised you and me is like waiting for your ectasy 
That one more day with you trip hoppin', yeah
One more night with you no stoppin'
Get my way with you trip hoppin'

In my kaleidoscope I'm looking through 
My only color was a neon blue
I was hanging on to yesterday and now the only way I get through 

One more night with you 
One more day won't do 

I'll be on my rainbow is my laying down your end of pillow
One more day with you trip hoppin'
One more night with you no stoppin'
Ain't no smoking fantasy 'cause love you is trippin' to me

One more day with you trip hoppin'
trip hoppin', trip hoppin' trip hoppin' trip hoppin' hoppin'
One more night with you no stoppin'
trip hoppin', trip hoppin' trip hoppin' trip hoppin' hoppin'
Get my way with you trip hoppin'
trip hoppin', trip hoppin' trip hoppin' trip hoppin' hoppin'
One more day with you trip hoppin'
trip hoppin', trip hoppin' trip hoppin' trip hoppin' trip hoppin' trip hoppin' triiiiip 

One more night with you 
One more day won't do 
One more night with you 
One more day won't do 
One more night with you 
One more day won't do 
One more night with you 
One more daaaaaay
