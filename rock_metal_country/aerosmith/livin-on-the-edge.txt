There's something wrong with the world today
I don't know what it is
Something's wrong with our eyes

We're seeing things in a different way
And God knows it ain't His
It sure ain't no surprise
YA!

Chorus
We're livin' on the edge 
We're livin' on the edge
We're livin' on the edge
We're livin' on the edge

There's someting wrong with the world today
The lightbulb's gettin' dimmed
There's meltdown in the sky

If you can judge a wise man
By the color of his skin
Then mister, you're a better man than I

Chorus
Livin' on the edge
You can't help yourself from fallin'
Livin' on the edge
You can't help yourself from fallin'
Livin' on the edge
You can't help yourself from fallin'
Livin' on the edge
You can't help yourself from fallin'

Tell me what you think about our situation
Complication - aggravation
Is getting to you

If chicken little tells you that the sky is fallin'
Even if it wasn't would you still come crawling
Back again - I bet you would my friend
Again & Again & Again & Again & Again

Tell me what you think about our situation
Complication - aggravation
Is getting to you

If chicken little tells you that the sky is fallin'
Even if it wasn't would you still come crawling
Back again - I bet you would my friend
Again & Again & Again & Again

Something right with the world today
And everybody knows it's wrong
But we can tell 'em no
Or we could let it go
But I would rather be a hanging on

Chorus
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Repeat Chorus
