walkin' the dog 
I'm just a-walkin' your dog 
well if you don't know how to do it 
I'll show you how to walk the dog 
ask your mama for fifteen cents 
to see the elephant jump the fence 
it jumped so high, it touched the sky 
didn't come back till the fourth of July 
mary mary, quite contrary 
how does your garden grow 
well well, silver bells, and little bitty bitty white shells 
pretty maids all in a row
