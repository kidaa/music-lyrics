hey look on yonder, what's that I see 
well that old bogus honey coming after me 
I thought you told her I was out of town 
I wonder how she knowed I was hangin' around 
say, listen babe, don't go wastin' your time 
you keep on comin' round you'll hear the same old line 
you got a thousand boys, you say you need 'em 
you take what's good for you and I'll take my freedom 
'cause lately it's been so hard now to make ends meet 
and honey, your head's a one way street 
and I gotta go the other way 
I thought I knew her, my cagey lady 
how could my sunshine be so damn shady 
she'll say she love to talk a conversation 
but I'm the one that makes my situation 
this one way city, that I thought I knew 
it's such a pity honey, that's it for you 
there's nothin' over here I never showed ya 
I made it pretty clear I'm glad to know ya 
you know your brother Spike, he's on the level 
but you always lookin' like you're mad at the devil 
don't say I cop a 'tude, it's all forgotten 
it's just you're much too rude, your fruits are rotten * 
you know I work so hard to keep it alive 
now all I hear from you is nothin' but jive 
lately it's been so hard now to make ends meet 
and honey, your head's a one way street 
and I really been feelin' like I could be movin' on * 
your head's like a one way street 
when you're foolin' everybody you meet 
your head's like a one way street 
you got to get yourself back on your feet
