good evening people, welcome to the show 
got something here I want you all to know 
when laughin' people bring on primal screams * 
you got to think of what it's gonna take to make your dreams 
make it 
don't break it 
I said make it 
don't break it 
do then ya feel like the world's coming down on you 
you know that history repeats itself 
but you just learned so by somebody else * 
you know you do, you gotta think up fast * 
you gotta figure what it's gonna take to make it last 
make it 
don't fake it 
said make it 
don't fake it 
better weather, pull yourself together 
don't be catchin' the blues 
better weather, pull yourself together 
what have you got to lose 
you're only paying your dues 
if you're gone I'll get you anyway 
although you know what you've been going through
