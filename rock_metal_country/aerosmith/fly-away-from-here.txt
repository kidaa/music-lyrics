Gotta find a way
Yeah, I can't wait another day
Ain't nothin' gonna change
If we stay 'round here
Gotta do what it takes
Cause all in our hands
We all make mistakes, yeah
But it's never to late to start again
Take another breath
And say another prayer

And fly away from here
Anywhere 
Yeah I don't care
We'll just fly away from here
Our hopes and dreams are out there somewhere
Won't let time pass us by
We'll just fly

If this life
Gets any harder now
It ain't, no, nevermind
You got me by your side
And anytime you want
Yeah, we can catch a train and find a better place
Yeah, cause we won't let nothin' or no one keep gettin' us down
Maybe you and I
Can pack our bags and hit the sky

And fly away from here
Anywhere
Yeah I don't care
We'll just fly away from here
Our hopes and dreams are out there somewhere
Won't let time pass us by
We'll just fly

Do you see a bluer sky now
You can have a better life now
Open your eyes
Cause no one here can ever stop us
They can try but we won't let them
No way

Maybe you and I 
Could pack our bags and say goodbye

And fly away from here
Anywhere
Honey I don't care
We'll just fly away from here
Our hope and dreams are out there somewhere
Fly away from here
Yeah anywhere
Honey I don't, I don't, I don't care

Yeah
We'll just fly
