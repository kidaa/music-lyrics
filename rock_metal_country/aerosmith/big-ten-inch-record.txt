Got me the strangest woman
Believe it, this chick's no sinch
When I wanna get her goin'
Then I whip out my Big Ten Inch

Record of the band that plays the blues
Well the band that plays the blues
She just loved my Big Ten Inch
Record of her favorite blues

Last night I tried to tease her
I gave my love a little pinch
But she said now stop that jivin
and whip out your big ten-inch

Record of the band that plays the blues
Well the band that plays the blues
She just loved my Big Ten Inch
Record of her favorite blues

I'll cover her with kisses
and when we're in a lover's clinch
she gets all excited
when she puts on my big ten-inch

Record of the band that plays the blues
Well the band that plays the blues
She just loved my Big Ten Inch
Record of her favorite blues

My gal don't go smokin'
and liquor just makes her flinch
Seems she don't go for nothin'
'cept for my big ten-inch

Record of the band that plays the blues
Band that plays the blues
She just loved my Big Ten Inch
Record of her favorite blues
