Get a Grip
Got to get a grip
Skin and bones it ain't such a pity
If you think I'm vain better shut ya lip
I can't explain how to be a fat city
You gotta live large, gotta let it rip
Skin and bones, it ain't such a pity
Don't cha gimme no flack, honey shut ya lip
Ya gotta have stones if you're living in the city
If ya wanna hang loose gotta get a grip, rip
Once upon a crime I thought I was cool but I don't want to brag
Once I crossed the line I think I musta zigged when I shoulda zagged
Got to get a grip
Skin and bones it ain't such a pity
If you think I'm vain better shut ya lip
I can't explain how to be a fat city
You gotta live large, gotta let it rip
Same old same old every day if things don't change you're just gonna rot
'Cause if you do what you've always done you'll always get what you always got
Oh, could that be nothin'?
Got to get a grip
Skin and bones it ain't such a pity
If you think I'm vain better shut ya lip
I can't explain how to be a fat city
You gotta live large, gotta let it rip
Skin and bones it ain't such a pity
Don't cha gimme no flack, honey shut ya lip
Ya gotta have stones if you're living in the city
If ya wanna hang loose gotta get a grip
Who knows for sure yeah without a doubt
What goes on when the lights go out
Or who pulls in when I pull out
And what is a one-eyed trouser trout?
I was so shortsighted
Now the wrong been righted
I feel so delighted
I get so excited
Got to get a grip
Skin and bones it ain't such a pity
If you think I'm vain better shut ya lip
I can't explain how to be a fat city
You gotta live large, gotta let it rip
Skin and bones it ain't such a pity
Don't cha gimme no flack, honey shut ya lip
Ya gotta have stones if you're living in the city
If ya wanna hang loose gotta get a grip
You wanna get high in a new york minute
Choke that smoke, honey crack the whip
Your head gets dead
As long as you're in it
You wanna hang loose, gotta get a grip
Skin and bones it ain't such a pity
Don't cha gimme no flack, honey shut ya lip
Ya gotta have stones if you're living in the city
If ya wanna hang loose gotta get a grip
