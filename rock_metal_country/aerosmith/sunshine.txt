I sold my soul for a one night stand
I followed alice into wonderland
I ate the mushroom and I dance with the queen
Yeah we dance in between all the lines

I followed daylight right into the dark
Took to the hatter like a walk in the park
But then I met her yeah she felt so right
No shadow the night yeah it was she

They call her sunshine
The kind that everbody knows
Yeah yeah
Sunshine 
She finer than a painted rose
Yeah yeah
Sunshine 
Yeah

Her kind of love is what I adore
What kind of trouble am I in for
My kind of heaven lies in hell's back door
And I got more than I need

Cause I need sunshine
The kind that everbody knows
Yeah yeah
My sunshine
She finer than a painted rose
Yeah yeah
Sunshine yeah

I got the karma but it don't come free
I chased that rabbit up an old oak tree
The kind of pill is tryin' to cop a plea
But the smoke ain't got nothin' on me

I gotta have my sunshine
The kind that everybody knows
Yeah yeah
Sunshine
She Finer than a painted rose
Yeah yeah
Sunshine 
The kind that everybody knows
Yeah yeah
My sunshine
She finer than a painted rose
Yeah yeah
Sunshine
Sunshine yeah
