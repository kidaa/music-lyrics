I tell you what I'm talkin' about
Remember not too long ago 
I was down and out of luck
I was out to do the dirty deed and didnt give a f*** 
[cover with background vocal]

And then she caught my eye
The girl was lookin' fresh
And what was underneath it all
Was passion in the flesh

If you think you see the devil's horns
Baby you're so right
Cause I been lookin for an outside fix
To make my insides right

Your reputation tells it all 
I see the writing on the wall
O yea as far as I can see
There is a God 'cause he sent me
A legendary child

I think that what I'm tryin' to say is
Just one look knocked me out
She smiled at me and said
Aa what I needI think it's love--
Aa give it up is what she said
Aa give it up and gimme h***

I'm a legendary lover
And tonight you won't regret
I'll give you legendary lovin' that you never will forget
And if you want to play with fire, baby now's the time
Yea cause you never tasted honey that's as sweet as mine

We played the game of tongue 'n cheek
And loved until our knees got weak
Had so much class that queen of sleeze
And rumor has it that she's a
Legendary child
