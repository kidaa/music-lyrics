chorus:
Talk is cheap, shut up and dance
don't get deep, shut up and dance
Love has got me down
a tear just hit the ground
so i started writing you this song
but the words i wrote came out all wrong
yeah, but its all right
When you can't define the crime
then life ain't worth a dime
when they take away everything you got
and rub your nose in the spot
not without a fight
when you work you fingers to the bone
now what does that get you -NOTHING
in a crowd of people
you're still alone
you hope that tells you somthing
the road to heaven is paved in hell
and it makes you wonder
why we're here at all
check out the shape of your circumstance
he wears the dress, she wears the pants
here comes Jill she needs romsance
but you cant do jack, so shut up
and dance!
Sex is like a gun
you aim, you shoot you run
when your splitting hairs with Mr. Clean
its like getting head from a guillotine
and the night has just begun
CHORUS
