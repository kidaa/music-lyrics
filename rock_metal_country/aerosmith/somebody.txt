I need a lady, not somebody shady 
need someone to be close to 
somebody cozy, not somebody nosy 
help me see my whole day through 
someone to share the load 
somebody to walk the road I live on... live! 
good Lord send me, good Lord mend me 
send me down someone for me 
said I won't be choosy, you could send me a floozy 
send me anybody you please 
somebody say you will 
somebody further still 
somebody, some-somebody for me 
now won't you send me somebody 
yeah, somebody 
won't you send me somebody 
now won't you send me somebody 
well, call for somebody, scream loud and bloody 
call woman, woman, come on to me 
save for tomorrow, share all your sorrow 
misery enjoys company yes it does, yes it does
