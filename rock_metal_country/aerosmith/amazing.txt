I kept the right ones out 
And let the wrong ones in 
Had an angel of mercy 
To see me through all my sins 
There were times in my life 
When I was goin' insane 
Tryin' to walk through the pain 

When I lost my grip 
And I hit the floor 
Yeah I thought I could leave 
But couldn't get out the door... heh ha 
I was so sick n' tired 
Of livin' a lie 
I was wishing that I would die 

[Chorus:]
It's amazing 
With the blink of an eye 
You finally see the light'a 
Oh... It's amazing 
A when the moment arrives 
That you know you'll be alright 
Yeah... It's amazing 
And I'm saying a prayer 
For the desperate hearts tonight 

That one last shot's a Permanent Vacation 
And how high can you fly with broken wings 
Life's a journey not a destination 
And I just can't tell just what tomorrow bring... yeah

You have to learn to crawl 
Before you learn to walk 
But I just couldn't listen 
To all that righteous talk... oh yeah 
I was out on the street 
Just tryin' to survive 
Scratchin' to stay... alive 

[Chorus:]
It's amazing
A with a blink of an eye 
You finally see the light 
Oh... it's amazing
A when the moment arrives
That you know you'll be alright
Oh... it's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer
For the desperate hearts tonight
The desperate hearts
Desperate hearts
Really wanna see what I can give what I got
  Oh oh no 
Wha na naa na na naaaa..... ooohhhha yeah.....

So... from all of us in Aerosmith
To all of you out there wherever you are 
Remember... 
The light at the end of the tunnel 
May be you
Goodnight
