Come 'ere baby

You know you drive me up the wall
The way you make good for all the nasty tricks you pull
Seems like we're makin' up more than we're makin' love
And it always seems you've got something on your mind
Other than me
Girl, you gotta change your crazy ways - you hear me

Say you're leavin' on the seven thirty train
And that you're heading out to Hollywood
Girl, you've been givin' me that line so many times
It kinda gets that feelin' bad looks good

That kinda lovin' turns a man to a slave
That kinda lovin' sends a man right to his grave

Chorus
I go crazy, crazy, baby, I go crazy
You turn it on - then you're gone
Yeah you drive me crazy, crazy, crazy for you baby
What can I do, honey
I feel like the color blue

You're packin' up your stuff and tryin' to tell me
That it's time to go
But I know you ain't wearin' nothin' underneath that
overcoat and that it's all a show

That kinda lovin' makes me wanna pull down the shade, yeah
That kinda lovin' yeah, now I'm never gonna be the same

Chorus

I'm losing my mind
Girl, 'cause I'm goin' crazy

I need your love, honey, yeah
I need your love

Repeat Chorus
