Kindness in your eyes
I guess you heard me cry
You smiled at me
Like Jesus to a child
I'm blessed I know
Heaven sent and heaven stole
You smiled at me like
Jesus to a child
And what have I learned
From all this pain
I thought I'd never feel the same
About anyone or anything again
But now I know

chorus :
When you find a love
When you know that it exists
Then the lover that you miss
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights
When you've been loved
When you know it holds such bliss
Then the lover that you kissed
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight

Sadness in my eyes
No one guessed, well no one tried
You smiled at me
Like Jesus to a child
Loveless and cold
With your last breath you saved my soul
You smiled at me
Like Jesus to a child
And what have I learned
From all these tears
I've waited for you all those years
Then just when it began
He took your love away
But I still say

chorus

So the words you could not say
I'll sing them for you
And the love we would have made
I'll make it for two
For every single memory
Has become a part of me

You will always be... my love

Well I've been loved
So I know just what love is
And the lover that I kissed is always by my side
Oh the lover I still miss... was Jesus to a child.
