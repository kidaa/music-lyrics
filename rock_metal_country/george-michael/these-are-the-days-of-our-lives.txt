sometimes I get the feelin'
I was back in the old days-long ago
when we were kids, when we were young
things seemed so perfect-you know?
thedays were endless, we were crazy-we were young
the sun was always shinin'-we just lived for fun
sometimes ot seems like lately-I don't know
the rest of my life's been-just a show

those were the days of our lives
the bad things in life were so few
those days are all gone now but one thing is true-
when I look and find, I still love you

you can't turn back the clock,
you can't turn back the tide
ain't that a shame? ain't that a shame?
I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride
when life was just a game
no use sitting and thinkin' on what you did
when you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
sometimes it seems like lately I just don't know
better sit back and go-with the flow

'cause these are the days of our lives
they've flown in the swiftness of time
these days are all gone now but some things remain
when I look and I find-no change

those were the days of our lives
the bad things in life were so few
those days are all gone now but one thing is true-
when I look and find, I still love you

I still love you
I love you
I still love you
I still love you
I still love you
still love you

Queen
