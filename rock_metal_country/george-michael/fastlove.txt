looking for some education
made my way into the night
all that bullshit conversation
well baby can't you read the signs

I won't bore you with the details baby
I don't even want to waste your time
let's just say that maybe
you could help to ease my mind
baby, I ain't Mr. Right

chorus
but if you're looking for fastlove
if that's love in your eyes
it's more than enough
had some bad luck
so fastlove is all that I've got on my mind

what's there to think about baby?

looking for some affirmation
made my way into the night
my friends got their ladies
they're all having babies
but I just want to have some fun

I win't bore you with the details baby
gonna get there in your own sweet time
let's just say that maybe
you could help to ease my mind
baby, I ain't Mr. Right

chorus

what's there to think about baby?
get yourself some lessons in love

in the absence of security
I made my way into the night
stupid cupid keeps on calling me
but I see nothing in his eyes
I miss my baby
I miss my baby, tonight
so why don't we make a little room
in my BMW babe
searching for some peace of mind
I help you find it
I do believe that we are practicing 
the same religion
you really ought to get up now

looking for some affirmation?
