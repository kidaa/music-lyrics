spin the wheel

five o'clock in the morning
you ain't home
I can't help thinking that's strange
baby I just want you to know
I won't go through it again
yes, those clouds are closing in

chorus
and I will not accept this as a part of my life
I will not live in fear of what may be
and the lessons I have learned...
I would rather be alone then watch you 
spinning that wheel for me
+
you've got a thing about danger
ain't you getting what you want from me
you've got a thing about strangers
baby that's what we used to be
you've got a thing about danger baby
I guess the hungry just can't see
one of these days 
you're gonna bring some home to me

six o'clock in the morning you ain't phoned
I can't help thinking that's strange
it seems that everybody takes 
their chances 
these days
oh yeah, we're standing in the rain

chorus

how can you love me
when you are playing with my life
you say give me time and I'll do better I swear
give me time and I'll lead you back to despair

and I don't want to go back there
