well I'm still here
but I'm so scared
got myself in trouble, so much trouble
I know I've got to make it
but I just can't take New York

my middle name is fear
I have a vacant stare
and it's been so long since my body's been warm
I know I've got to make it
but I just can't take New York

I came here
all dreams and wide eyes in the big, big city
no family, no money
and I don't even know what's hit me

he hasn't seen a doctor
since he got here in the spring
went to the Medicentre
but they wouldn't let him
without a green card
life can be so hard
take pity on a man without a home of his own
how could he ever have known?

every street and every corner
watch them drowning
watch them do the Crazyman dance
man and women to the slaughter
we just stand and watch them
do the Crazyman dance

it's been one whole year
and it's just not fair
for all the pushing and shoving
I've still got nothing
I'm never gonna make it
and I'm stuck here in New York

so people don't come near
unless you've a dollar to spare
'cause you know what they say
about madmen on the subways of New York
believe it

yesterday's newspapers
I wrap them around my body
outside these skyscrapers
I wait for the night to hit me
and boy, does it hit me

every street and every corner
watch them drowning
watch them do the Crazyman dance
for a nickel or a quarter
for your pleasure
watch them do the Crazyman dance

I'm coming yo London
I'm coming to Paris
I'm coming yo make you good clean people embarressed
why don't you look at my face
why don't you look in my eyes
you'd rather look at your feet
you'd rather look at the skies

oh, you'd look anywhere
but a man whose pure existence 
says 'I ain't got time'
and I don't care
you just don't care
care

George Michael
