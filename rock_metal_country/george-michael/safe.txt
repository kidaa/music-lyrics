sweet thing
I know how strong that I appear
but you don't know the days
since someone loved me
I stopped bleading
you came
and led me through that door again
you say you wanna stay
but you don't know me no you don't know

you make me feel safe

someday
my darkest fears will find their way
after all
somebody loves me loves me, loves me
all day

my heart tells strangers how I feel
and it's hard not to feel this way
when you thought your future was on prescription
baby

you make me feel safe
you make me feel safe

George Michael
