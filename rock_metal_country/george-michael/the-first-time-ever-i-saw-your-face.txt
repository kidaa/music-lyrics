the first time ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
and the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave
to the dark and endless skies, my love
to the dark and empty skies

the first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move in my hands
like the trembling heart of a captive bird
that was there at my command, my love
that was there at my command

the first time I ever lay with you]
and felt you heart so close to mine
and I knew our joy would fill the world
and would last till the and of time, my love
it would last till the end of time
the first time ever I saw your face
your face, your face
