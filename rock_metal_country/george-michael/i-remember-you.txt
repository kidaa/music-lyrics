I remember you
you're the one who made my dreams come true
a few kisses ago

I remember you
you're the one who said I love you too
didn't you know

I remember too
a distant bell
and stars that fell
like rain out of the blue

when my life is through
and the angels ask me to recall
the thrill of them all
then I will tell them I remember you

I remember you
you're the one who made my dreams come true
a few kisses ago

I remember you
you're the one who said I love you too
didn't you know

I remember too
a distant bell
and stars that fell
like rain out of the blue
I miss you darling

when my life is through
and the angels ask me to recall
the thrill of them all
then I will tell them I remember you
