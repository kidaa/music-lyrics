Like a warrior that fights
And wins the battle
I know the taste of victory
Though I went through some nights
Consumed by the shadows
I was crippled emotionally
Somehow I made it through the heartache
Yes I did, I escaped
I found my way out of the darkness,
Kept my faith I know you did
Kept my faith

When the river was deep I didnt falter
When the mountain was high I still believed
When the valley was low iIt didnt stop me, no no
I knew you were waiting 
I knew you were waiting for me 

With and endless desire I kept on searching
Sure in time our eyes would meet
Like the bridge is on fire
The hurt is over, one touch and you set me free
No, I dont regret a single moment
No I don't looking back
When I think of all those disappointments
I just laugh I know you do, I just laugh

When the river was deep I didnt falter
When the mountain was high I still believed
When the valley was low iIt didnt stop me, no no
I knew you were waiting 
I knew you were waiting for me

So we were drawn together through destiny
I know this love we share was meant to be
I knew you were waiting, knew you were waiting
I knew you were waiting, knew you were waiting for me
