first you take of your hat
then you take of those brand new shoes
say 'Hey George, what've you got to lose?'
with my hand on yur thigh
I just look you in the eye and say
'Not a whole lot baby
but a whole lot more than you'

I can make you happy yeah, yeah
don't you know that?
she said
I can make you happy

boys and girls
the ones who kiss and tell
why should we have to believe them?
no, I don't understand
how any woman, how any man
can say 'Lay me down, lay me down'
for that big stash-cheap cash-think about the money

I can make you happy yeah, yeah
don't you know that?
she said
I can make you happy

I've seen you in the corner
with your rub-it-on tan
hitching a ride
could be a woman or a man
gonna get what you want before too long
gonna take your oppurtunities
right or wrong

some poor cow with a seven-year itch?
you don't dig men
but you'll fuch 'em if they're rich
you can't be--with me
you're a low life, daughterofasonofabitch
