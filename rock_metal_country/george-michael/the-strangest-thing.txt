take my life
time has been twisting the knife 
I don't recognise 
people I care for

take my dreams
childish and weak at the seams
please don't analyse
please just be there for me

the things that I know
nobody told me
the seeds that are sown
they still control me 

there's a liar in my head
there's a thief upon my bed
and the strangest thing 
is I cannot get my eyes open 

take my hand
lead me to some peaceful land 
that I cannot find
inside my head 

wake me with love 
it's all I need
but in all this time
still no one said... 

there's a liar in my head 
there's a thief upon my bed
and the strangest thing 
is I cannot get my eyes open 

give me something I can hold
give me something to believe in
I am frightened for my soul 
please, please
make love to me, send love through me
heal me with your crime
the only one who ever knew me
we've waisted so much time
so much time

George Michael
