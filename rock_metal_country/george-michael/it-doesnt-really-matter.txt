it doesn't really matter that I loved you
how many reasons call
it doesn't really matter at all

it doesn't matter that I failed to
break down your father's wall
it doesn't matter at all

why tell me you don't understand when you do
I thought I had something to say

but it really doesn't matter at all...

I changed my name
to be rid of the things that I want from you
it's strange
but a name is a name and the truth is the truth

oh, there is always
always someone to remind me

so I learn to live with shame
tell myself I feel no pain
but I do
and if I have to tell you

then it really doesn't matter at all...

and it's no good looking back
because time's a thief and I believe that
I'm too old for that
we're just saying the things that we've said
forever

it doesn't really matter that I loved you
how many seasons fall
it's too bad
it really doesn't matter at all

George Michael
