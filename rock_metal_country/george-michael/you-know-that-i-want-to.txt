lover don't love too much
it's a bad thing, a sad thing
it is heaven to the touch
hey everybody's got a moment in their lives 
they can't change
don't they baby

I know you don't care
what's right or wrong
all that I know
is that love don't belong heer
so it's better to turn the page
watch me walk away my dear
watch me walk away
you say

chorus
I can't stop but you know that I want to
I can't stop don't you know that I want you
I want you baby
more than ever
I can't stop but you know that I want to
I can't stop don't you know that I want you

but it's never gonna be that easy
I don't wanna waste your time

lover don't love too much
I'm a bad boy, a sad boy
and I'll never give you much
hey everybody's got some moment in their lives
they can't change

take you home
all that I know
is that something's so wrong with this heat
why do you touch the flame

in a place you will be all mine

chorus

but it's never gonna be that easy
