once I had a secret love
that lived within the heart of me
all too soon my secret love 
became impatient to be free

so I told a friendly star
the way that dreamers often do
just how wonderful you are
and why I'm so in love with you

now I shout it from the highest hill
I even told you the golden dafodill
at least my heart's an open door
and my secret love's no secret anymore

now I shout it from the highest hill
I even told you the golden dafodill
at least my heart's an open door
and my secret love's no secret 
my secret love's no secret
my secret love's no secret anymore
