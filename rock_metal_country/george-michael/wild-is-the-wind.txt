love me, love me, love me, love me
say you do
let me fly away with you
for my love is like the wind
and wild is the wind
wild is the wind

give me more than one caress
satisfy this hungriness
let the wind blow through your heart
oh wild is the wind
wild is the wind

you touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins
you kiss me
with your kiss my life begins
you're Spring to me
all things to me
don't you know
you're life itself!

like the leaf
clings to the tree
oh my darling cling to me
for we're like creatures of the wind
and wild is the wind
wild is the wind

you touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins
you kiss me
with your kiss my life begins
you're Spring to me
all things to me
don't you know
you're life itself!

like the leaf
clings to the tree
oh my darling cling to me
for we're like creatures of the wind
and wild is the wind
wild is the wind, wild is the wind
wild is the wind, wild is the wind
