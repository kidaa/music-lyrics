I'm here if you see me

she's got a song in her head and she'll sing to me
she's got a laugh that reminds me of why she's in love with me
she'd never let show she was lonely in case it had frightened me
she was carpet and stone, independent, alone
but this love always shone around me every time, oh

waltz away dreaming till your day begins again
free from the seasons and this state I'm in
and oh, I can't hold it all under one love
it was so long ago when we danced in the streets
now you fly like an eagle above while I waltz away anyway
and I'm waltzing my days away
searching for this woman I love

I'm here if you see me

she had a history, joy and pain, and she chose to leave
she had a thousand and one photographs that you would not believe
she'll come to you in disguise, she's there in you children's eyes
still our mother, she's still your wife
so let her

waltz away dreaming till your day begins again, oh yeah
free from the reasons and this state I'm in
and oh,trust me I can't hold it all 
she ain't going anywhere under one love
trust me, she told me, when you're ready she'll be there
it was so long ago no, don't let go of her
when we kissed in the streets
now you fly like an eagle above while I waltz away anyway
then I'm waltzing my days away
searching for this woman I love

and the moment you see me, I will live in your life
we will walk through my garden, I will see through you eyes
waltzing my days away and the moment
I was in despair you see me till she found me there I will live
every grown man cries in your life with his mother's eyes
we will walk when you're ready too through my garden
she'll come back to you I will see through your eyes
waltzing my days away and the moment she's waiting
you see me, I will live in your life
waltzing my days we will walk she's waiting
through my garden, I will father see through your eyes
she's waiting and the moment you see me
