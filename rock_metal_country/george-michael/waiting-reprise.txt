well there ain't no point in moving on
until you've got somewhere to go
and the road that I have walked upon
well it filled my pockets
and emptied out my soul

all those insecureties
that have held me down for so long
I can't say that I've found a cure for these
but at least I know them
so they're not so strong

you look for your dreams in heaven
but what the hell are you supposed to do
when they come true?

well there's one year of my life in these songs
and some of them are about you
now I know there's no way I can write those wrongs
believe me
I would not lie you've hurt my pride
and I guess there's a road without you

but you once said
there's a way back for every man
so here I am
don't people change
here I am
is it too late to try again
here I am

George Michael
