now every day I see you in some other face
they crack a smile, talk a while 
try to take your place
my memory serves me far too well 

I just sit here on this mountain 
thinking to myself
you're a fool boy 
why don't you go down
find somebody
find somebody else
my memory serves me far too well 

it's not as though we just broke up
it's not as though it was yesterday 
but something I just can't explain
something in me needs this pain
I know I'll never see your face again

c'mon now
I've got to be strong now 

now everybody's talking about this 
new decade 
like you say the magic numbers 
then just say goodbye to 
the stupid mistakes you made 
oh my memory serves me far too well 

don't you know that
the years will come and go 
some of us will change their lives
some of us still have nothing to show
nothing baby
but memories 

and if these wounds 
they are self inflicted 
I don't really know 
how my poor heart could have 
protected me
but if I have to carry this pain
if you will not share the blame
I deserve to see your face again

c'mon now
you don't have to be strong now 
come back

come back to me darling 
I will make it worth your while
come on back to your baby
I miss your kiss
I miss your smile
seems to me the peace I search to find
ain't gonna be mine 
until you say you will
don't you keep me waiting for that day 
I know
you hear these words that I say

you can't always get what you want 

George Michael/Mick Jagger/Keith Richards
