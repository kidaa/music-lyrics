it's late
time for bed
so I sit, and wait
for that gin and tonic
to go to your head

I know 
it's a devious plan
but it's the only way that I know
to get those big bad carkeys
out of your habd

you know
that I remain a gentle man
but even so
there's only so much
a gentleman can stand
sleep with me
oh sleep with me tonight

my cards are on your table
my dreams are in your bed 
if I was able
I'd be there instead

sleep with me tonight

George Michael
