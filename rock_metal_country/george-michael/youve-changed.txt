you've changed
that sparkle in your eyes has gone
your smile is just a careless yawn
you're breaking my heart, you've changed

you've changed
your kisses are now so blase
you're bored with me in every way
I can't understand you've changed

you've forgotten the word I love you
each memory that we've shared
you ignore every star above you
I can't realise you ever cared

you've changed
you're not the anges I once knew
no need to tell me that we're through
it's all over now, you've changed

you've forgotten the word I love you
each memory that we've shared
you ignore every star above you
I can't realise you ever cared

you've changed
you're not the anges I once knew
no need to tell me that we're through
it's all over now, you've changed
I miss you
