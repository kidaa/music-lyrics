when you're awake
the things you think
come from the dreams you dream
thought has wings,
and lots of things
are seldom what they see
sometimes you think you've lived before
all that you live today
things you do come back to you
as though they knew the way
oh, the tricks your mind can play

it seems we stood and talked like this before
we looked at each other in the same way then
but I can't remember where or when
the clothes you're wearing and the clothes you wore
the smile you are smiling you were smiling then
but I can't remember where or when
some things that happen for the first time
seem to be happening again
and so it seems that we have met before
and laughed before
and loved before
but who knows where or when

it seems we stood and talked like this before
we looked at each other in the same way then
but I can't remember where or when
the clothes you're wearing and the clothes you wore
the smile you are smiling you were smiling then
but I can't remember where or when
some things that happen for the first time
seem to be happening again
and so it seems that we have met before
and laughed before
and loved before
but who knows where or when
