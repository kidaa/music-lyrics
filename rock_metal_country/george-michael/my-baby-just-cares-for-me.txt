my baby don't care for shows
my baby don't care for clothes
my baby just cares for me

my baby don't care for cars and races
my baby don't care for high tone places

Elizabeth Taylor is not his style
and even Ricky Martin's smile 
is something he can't see
my baby don't care who knows it
my baby just cares for me

I wonder what's wrong with baby
my baby just cares for
he just says his prayers for
my baby just cares
for me

Walter Donaldson/Gus Kahn
