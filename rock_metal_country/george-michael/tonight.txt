tonight
do we have to fight again
tonight?
I just want to go to sleep
turn out the light
but you want to carry grudges
oh, nine times out of ten
oh, I see the storm approaching
long before the rain starts falling
tonight
does it have to be the old thing
tonight?
oh, it's late, too late
to chase the rainbow that you're after
I'd like to find a compromise
oh, and place it in your hands
my eyes are blind, my ears can't hear
oh, and I cannot find the time
tonight
just let the curtains close in silence
why not approach with less defiance
the man who'd love to see you smile
who'd love to see you smile
tonight

tonight
just let the curtains close in silence
tonight
why not approach with less defiance
the man who'd love to see your smile 
the man who'd love to see your smile 
the man who'd love to see your smile 
tonight
