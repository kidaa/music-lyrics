I. Lust

There's things that you guess and things that you know 
There's boys that you can trust and girls that you don't 
There's little things you hide and little things that you show 
Sometimes you think you're gonna get it 
But you don't and that's just the way it goes 

I swear I won't tease you, won't tell you no lies 
I don't need no bible, just look in my eyes 
I've waited so long baby, now that we're friends 
Every man's got his patience, and here's where my ends 

I want your sex 
I want you 
I want your.....sex 

It's playing on my mind, It's dancing on my soul 
It's taken so much time, so why don't you just let me go 
I'd really like to try oh, I'd really love to know 
When you tell me you're gonna regret it 
Then I tell you that I love you but you still say NO! 

I swear I won't tease you, won't tell you no lies 
I don't need no bible, just look in my eyes 
I've waited so long baby, out in the cold 
I can't take much more girl I'm losing control 

I want your sex 
I want your love 
I want your.....sex 

It's natural It's chemical let's do it 
It's logical Habitual can we do it 
It's sensual But most of all..... 
Sex is something that we should do 
Sex is something for me and you 

Sex is natural - sex is good 
Not everybody does it 
But everybody should 
Sex is natural - sex is fun 
Sex is best when it's....one on one 
one on one 

I'm not your father 
I'm not your brother 
Talk to your sister 
I am a lover 
C-c-c-c-come on 

What's your definition of dirty baby
What do you consider pornography 
Don't you know I love it till it hurts me baby 
Don't you think it's time you had sex with me 
What's your definition of dirty baby 
What do you call pornography 
Don't you know I love it till it hurts me baby 
Don't you think it's time you had sex with me 
Sex with me 
Sex with me 
Have sex with me 
C-c-c-c-come on

II. Brass in love

Oh so much love, that you've never seen 
Let's make love, put your trust in me hmm
Don't you listen to what they told you 
Because I love you, let me hold you 

Oh, I'm not your brother 
I'm not your father 
Oh will you ever change your mind 
I'm a gentle lover with a heart of gold 
But baby you've been so unkind...oh 

Come on 
I want your sex 
Come on, I want your sex 
That's right, all night 
Oh, I want your sex 
I want your...sex 

Sexy baby's Sexy baby's Sexy body Sexy body 
Keeps me guessing Keeps me guessing
With a promise Oh
I know we can come together 
But the question is Will we ever ever

Together - you and me
