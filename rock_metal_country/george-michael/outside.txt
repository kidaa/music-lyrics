I think I'm done with the sofa 
I think I'm done with the hall 
I think I'm done with the kitchen table, baby

let's go outside let's go outside
in the sunshine 
I know you want to, but you can't say yes
Let's go outside 
in the moonshine 
take me to the places that I love best

So my angel she says, don't you worry
'bout the things they're saying, yeah 
got no friends in high places 
and the game that you gave away 
wasn't worth playing

let's go outside 
in the sunshine 
I know you want to, but you can't say yes
let's go outside 
in the meantime 
take me to the places that I love best

and yes I've been bad 
doctor won't you do with me what you can 
you see I think about it all the time 
twenty four seven

you say you want it, you got it 
I never really said it before 
there s nothing here but flesh and bone 
there's nothing more nothing more 
there's nothing more

back to nature, just human nature 
getting on back to

I think I m done with the sofa 
I think I m done with the hall
I think I'm done with the kitchen table, baby

let's go outside
in the sunshine
I know you want to, but you can't say yes
let's go outside
in the moonshine
take me to the places that I love best

and yes I've been bad 
doctor won't you do with me what you can 
you see I think about it all the time 
I'd service the community 
but I already have you see!
I never really said it before

there's nothing here but flesh and bone 
there's nothing more, nothing more 
there's nothing more
let's go outside
dancing on the D-train baby

when the moon is high 
and the grass is jumpin' 
come on, just keep on funkin' 
keep on funkin', just keep on funkin'
