We're talkin' on the phone
A million miles away
You crawl inside the line
You snake into my mind
You always get to me
You're like a glass of sweet red wine
I spill on my white shirt
Color of pleasure and pain
Your picture's in the stain
You always get to me
You always get to me
I'm under your thumb
Girl you're under my skin
You always get to me
Right before the beginning of the end
When I'm hangin' by a thread Ahh ah
There's a circus in my head Ahh ah
I'm in a lonely state of mind
You always get to me
Your love rescues me
You always get to me
Just in time
Love ain't some masquerade
To wear a plastic face
You strip off my disguise
You see the good inside
You always get to me, yeah
You always get to me
I'm under your thumb
Girl you're under my skin
You always get to me
Right before the beginning of the end
When I'm hangin' by a thread Ahh ah
There's a circus in my head Ahh ah
I'm in a lonely state of mind
You always get to me
Your love rescues me
You always get to me
Just in time
You always get to me
I'm under your thumb
Girl you're under my skin
You always get to me
Right before the beginning of the end
When I'm hangin' by a thread Ahh ah
There's a circus in my head Ahh ah
I'm in a lonely state of mind
You always get to me
Your love rescues me
You always get to me
Just in time
Oh
You always get to me
You're my net when I'm fallin'
The answer when I'm callin'
You always get to me
You're the stars in my darkness
My faith when I'm heartless
You always get to me
You break down the walls and set me free
You always get to me
You always get to me
Girl, you always get to me
You always get to me
You always get to me
Yeah
You always get to me
Oh whoa whoa whoa
