Jeff Wood/Marc Beeson
Before you I was totally lost
And so hopelessly sure I'd end up by myself
I was so unaware there was someone out there
For me who'd love me like nobody else
Then you gave me something that I always wanted
Now I'm giving it all back to you
Darlin' completely
With all of my soul
I was so empty 'till you made me whole
Girl, you complete me
More every day
I promise forever to love you this way
Right from the start
Girl, I'll give you my heart
Darlin' completely
I did time as a single man year after year
And right when I almost gave up
Way up high on a ledge leaning over the edge
I was mercifully saved by your love
It might take a lifetime
But I know that I'll find the right words to tell you
I'm yours
Darlin' completely
With all of my soul
I was so empty 'till you made me whole
Girl, you complete me
More every day
I promise forever to love you this way
Right from the start
Girl, I'll give you my heart
Darlin' completely
Right from the start
Girl, I'll give you my heart
Darlin' completely
Oh girl, completely
