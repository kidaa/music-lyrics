Mark Collie/Bruce Burch
We had a storybook beginning getting better with each page
Somewhere in the middle I somehow lost my place
Then came the final chapter where you said we were through
And left me living sadly ever after loving you
Sadly ever after since you said goodbye
With just one little word you wrote me right out of your life
You found a new prince charming
Now I'm a royal shade of blue
Alone and living sadly ever after loving you
Now the story that I'm writing is a sad, sad tale to tell
'Bout a man that loved someone who loved somebody else
But I wish that it was fiction but heaven knows it's true
And the ending leaves me sadly ever after loving you
Chorus
Oh, you found a new prince charming
Now I'm a royal shade of blue
Alone and living sadly ever after loving you
