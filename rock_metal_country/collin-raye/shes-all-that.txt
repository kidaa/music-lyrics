She was singin' ";Love Me Tender"; at the local karaoke
I knew right then and there I had found my one and only
She takes my breath away everytime I see her
Just couldn't wait for all my boys to meet her
She's got season tickets and sweet pouty lips
She's all that, well equipped
She's all that, she loves to ride in my pickup truck
She's all that, Mom and Daddy can't believe my luck
She's all that, she looks so good we never wait in line
She's all that, she's all mine
She can throw a split finger and she's got her own glove
When she sinks a twenty footer, man I know I'm in love
Saturday night she's like a time bomb tickin'
She looks better on Sunday than Mama's fried chicken
She only gets mad when she missed SportsCenter
She's all that, even tempered
She's all that, she swings a nine handicap
She's all that, she looks sexy in a baseball cap
She's all that, she makes me want to lay it all on the line
She's all that, she's all mine
Whoa she's a perfect combination
Whoa got my defense off the field
Whoa every day's an education
Got my head a spinnin' like a spoke inside a wheel
She's all that, I'm in touch with her feminine side
She's all that, let me tell you man, it's one sweet ride
She's all that, a humdinger,boy, straight off the blocks
She's all that, no doubt about it, the girl rocks
The girl's all that
The girl's all that
The girl's all that
Going home to baby sure is fine
She's all that, she's all mine
She's all that, she's all mine
She's all that
