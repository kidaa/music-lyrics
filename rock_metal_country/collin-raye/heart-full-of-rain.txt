Hugh Prestwood
I believe I've attempted every move that I know
I was sure that by now you'd have let yourself go
I've been living my heart out, and without any shame
gotten down on my knees just to kindle this flam
But tonight I am down to the wire
I've been striking these matches in vain
Got a whole lt of smoke but no fire
'Cause you got a heart full of rain
Now somewhere in your history there's a reason or two
Why you won't let a body get close to you
Why the truth that I whisper always sounds like  a lie
Why you're drowning inside from the tears you don't cry
But your eyes have never been dryer
And you smile like you're felling no pain
Got a whole lot of smoke but no fire
'Cause you got a heart full of rain
I had hoped I could open the heart that you hide
'Cause it sure needs a little sunshine inside
But tonight I am down to the wire
I've been striking these matches in vain
Got a whole lot of smoke but no fire
'Cause you got a heart full of rain
