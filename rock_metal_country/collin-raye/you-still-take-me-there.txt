In case I haven't told ya lately
Just in case it doesn't show
I'm still enchanted by you baby
And I just wanted you to know
You were the first one
And you'll be the last one
You are the only one, I swear
You took me to heaven
Our first night together
And you still take me there
Whoa I
Just to have you in my arms tonight
Oh, how could I ask for more
You give me hope and strength
You give me life
Your love is all I'm living for
You were the first one
And you'll be the last one
You are the only one, I swear
You took me to heaven
Our first night together
And you still take me there
You take me higher
Than I ever dreamed I'd go
With you I leave the worries
Of this troubled world below
You took me to heaven
Our first night together
And you still take me there
Oh you took me to heaven
Our first night together
And you still take me
Darlin' you still take me
Baby you still take me
There
