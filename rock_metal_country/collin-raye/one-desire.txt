It wakes me up when I am sleeping
It's all I'm thinking, all I'm feeling
It happens every time you're near me
I'm consumed, wanting you
Your touch is all I need
I found the sweet surrender
That was missing in my life
The one love that could keep my
Passion burning in the night
Like a raging fire, you're my one desire,
One desire------
You're the summer wind that warms me
You're the only air I breathe
In the shelter of your love
The afterglow fills my soul
And forever's not enough no
I found the sweet surrender
That was missing in my life
The one love that could keep my
Passion burning in the night
Like a raging fire, you're my one desire,
One desire------
Hypnotize me, hold me, hide me
Never let me go  yeah
I found the sweet surrender
That was missing in my life
The one love that could keep my
Passion burning in the night
Like a raging fire, you're my one desire,
One desire------
One desire, one desire---- oh!
Like a raging fire, all I ever need, oh
