Chapin Hartford/Jim McBride
Heaven knows where I'd be now
If you had not found me
On that road that takes a man
To places he's not meant to be.
I wasn't ready for the touch
That turned my life around
Now I'm helpless in your hands
It's love that ties me down.
Angel of no mercy
Girl you take my breath away
And it feels so good it hurts me
To think that you might fly away
Can't you see that I've surrendered
You stole this old heart blind
You're an angel of no mercy
But I don't mind.
Ain't it strange how love can take
A heart that's hard as steel
Hold it tightly in the fire
And teach that cold heart how to feel.
Touch me now, I'm still not sure
You're truly flesh and bone
Heaven knows you can't be from
This world that I live on.
Angel of no mercy
Girl you take my breath away
And it feels so good it hurts me
To think that you might fly away
Can't you see that I've surrendered
You stole this old heart blind
You're an angel of no mercy
But I don't mind.
