Mamma's tears fell so easy 
Daddy's handshake was strong
Then I climbed aboard that Greyhound
Eighteen and glad to be gone
Took a rented room on broadway
As I unpacked everything I owed
I found a note my mamma left me 
With a Bible and a bus ticket home It said

One will get you where you're going
When you haven't got a prayer
And one will bring you back son
If you're dreams ain't waiting there
You're out on your own now
We won't be there to fall back on
But you know we're never farther 
Than a Bible and a bus ticket home.
The years have come and gone and taken
The only things in life I ever counted on
But I'm going back tomorrow
To lay flowers on their stone.
I can almost hear my mamma calling
Saying son come back where you belong
You've got all you need to get here
A Bible and a bus ticket home
One will get you where you're going
When you haven't got a prayer
And one will bring you back son
If you're dreams ain't waiting there
You're out on your own now
We won't be there to fall back on
But you know we're never farther 
Than a Bible and a bus ticket home.
