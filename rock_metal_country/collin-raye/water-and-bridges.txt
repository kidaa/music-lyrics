I was young and so was she
Love didn't stay a mystery for very long
We could do no wrong
Then she called to say
She was late
So we took a little drive upstate
And took care of that
Yeah, we just took care of that
Now I'm looking back on
Some of my decisions
Now that it's much too late to change
How a father could have held his son
If I could undo what's been done
But I guess everyone is living
With water and bridges
My old man
He had it rough
Cause like his daddy
When he drank too much
He'd get mean
And take it out on me
So with angry words
I was gone
And I never even tried to come back home
The night he died
Momma said he apologized
Now I'm looking back on
Some of my decisions
Now that it's much too late to change
How a father could have held his son
If I could undo what's been done
But I guess everyone is living
With water and bridges
We could all go crazy from
The things that only time can numb
I guess that's why everyone is given
Water and bridges
Water and bridges
