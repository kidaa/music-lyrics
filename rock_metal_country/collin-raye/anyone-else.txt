Baby, I bought wine and roses on my way home
Yeah, I know we can't afford it but life doesn't last too long
This world has gone half crazy
And knocked us both to our knees
I'm fumbling for the words to try and tell ya I love you for hangin' on to me
When anyone else would've been long gone
Packed it up and headed back home
And not a soul would blame you after what I put you through
Yeah, anyone else would've gone insane
Called the game on account of rain
Anyone else, anyone else, anyone else but you
Mayday baby, all the rivets popped loose, it's a total tailspin
Too much grindstone, too little time with you
Girl, you know it's wearing thin
Baby, let's trade in these teardrops for warm kisses on skin
You got a drawer full IOUs and it's high time you called those things in
When anyone else would've been long gone
Packed it up and headed back home
And not a soul would blame you after what I put you through
Yeah, anyone else would've gone insane
Called the game on account of rain
Anyone else, anyone else, anyone else but you
You've passed up so many chances to walk right out the door
Instead of dodging a champagne cork and watchin' the wet clothes fall to the floor
When anyone else would've been long gone
Packed it up and headed back home
And you can hide behind a Cheshire cat grin
But you know it's true, yeah anyone else would've gone insane
Called the game on account of rain
Anyone else, anyone else, anyone but you
Girl, anyone but you
