Too La Loo Ra Loo Ral
Too La Loo Ra Li
Too La Loo Ra Loo Ral
Hush now dont you cry
Too La Loo Ra Loo Ral
Too La Loo Ra Li
Too La Loo Ra Loo Ral
Thats an Irish lullaby
Over in Killarney
Many years ago
My mother sang a song to me
In tones soft and low
Just a simple, little ditty
In her old Irish way
And Id give the world if I could hear
That song of hers today
Too La Loo Ra Loo Ral
Too La Loo Ra Li
Too La Loo Ra Loo Ral
Hush now dont you cry
Too La Loo Ra Loo Ral
Too La Loo Ra Li
Too La Loo Ra Loo Ral
