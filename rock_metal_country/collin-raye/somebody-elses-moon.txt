I look out my window at the world I once owned
And I see it's still spinning round
But somewhere above me a light I once knew
No longer shines through the clouds
But that's somebody else's moon tonight
Those are somebody else's stars
They're are no longer mine
'Cause somewhere tonight
You're in somebody else's arms
Remember the wishes we made in the night
When dreams were supposed to come true
Well I do 'cause you put the stars in my eyes
As you softly promised the moon
That's somebody else's moon tonight
Those are somebody else's stars
They're are no longer mine
'Cause somewhere tonight
You're in somebody else's arms
They're no longer mine
'Cause somewhere tonight
You're in somebody else's arms
