Baby please don't get to close to me
'Cause that ring you're wearing says that you're not free
But if I said I didn't want ya
Well you know I'd be a lier
You better run while there's still time
'Cause I can't stop this fire
I want you bad I can't help myself
But you belong to someone else
I'd leave you alone
Darlin' if I could
But I want you bad and that ain't good
Baby please put away those ruby lips
And those big blue eyes are too hard to resist
I'm not that kind of man
Oh and usually I'm strong
But it's getting hard to tell between 
What's right and what is wrong
Chorus
I want you bad and girl that ain't good
I want you bad, bad, bad and that ain't good
