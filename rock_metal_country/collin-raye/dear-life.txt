G. Lesage/C. Dannemiller
I watched you begin, my child, See you fading in your father's face.
For the first time I'm in the mirror, looking both ways
At where I've been and where I'm headed
It makes me want to live each day like I may not get it.
Dear Life, from my very first breath,
You were one step ahead
Of where I thought I was going
Dear Life,when I loved and I lost
Somehow at all cost
You kept me holdin?on, for
Dear Life, through the healing and scars
Through all you've showed me so far
I see how precious you are, Dear Life.
I was bound to give away my heart and have it handed back to me
Until you led me to the one that was always meant to be
I'd've never known joy if I never knew sorrow
When I didn't know how to face tomorrow
Dear Life, from my very first breath,
You were one step ahead
Of where I thought I was going
Dear Life,when I loved and I lost
Somehow at all cost
You kept me holdin?on, for
Dear Life, through the healing and scars
Through all you've showed me so far
I see how precious you are, Dear Life.
For once I'm gonna rest in the arms of the unknown
And wait to watch you unfold
Dear Life, from my very first breath,
You were one step ahead
Of where I thought I was going
Dear Life,when I loved and I lost
Somehow at all cost
You kept me holdin?on, for
Dear Life, through the healing and scars
Through all you've showed me so far
I see how precious you are, Dear Life.
