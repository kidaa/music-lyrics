Billy Mann
I was lost
On the outside
I almost gave up
I almost put love aside
Then I saw you
A little spark, then a flame
I felt the blood rush a million miles an hour
Through my veins
I'm not ready for this
One last breath and a kiss
'Cause my heart knows you're the one
And baby living without you
Would mean living is done
I'd say
Turn off the sun
Take down the moon
Eliminate the words ";I love you";
There would be no point
No reason to live
Without you girl
Losing you would mean
The end of the world
So stop the war
Bring back the light
Life without you
Would be like autumn leaves
In black and white
Didn't we have it all
More depth than the sea
It's cruel to take a fragile heart
And promise love that life can't keep
I'm not ready to fall
Just let go of it all
'Cause I don't wanna love just to lose
I heard it's sad
But the life you live is the life that you choose
But without you
Turn off the sun
Take down the moon
Eliminate the words ";I love you";
There would be no point
No reason to live
Without you girl
Losing you would mean
The end of the world
Everywhere I see your face
I see your face
I see your grace
And then it's gone
I can't walk on
I can't walk on
Turn off the sun
Oh, there would be no point
No reason to live
'Cause without you girl
Losing you would mean
The end of the world
