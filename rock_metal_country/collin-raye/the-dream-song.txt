Jason Blume/Karen Taylor-Good
Lay your head on your pillow now
Close your eyes
Ill tuck you in and Ill kiss you goodnight
While you and your teddy bear are countin sheep
Next thing you know, youll be fast asleep
Sleep now my angle your long day is done
The very best part of the night has begun
Cause we get a present when we go to sleep
We get to dream
If you have a dream your dream can come true
A whole world of wonder is waiting for you
lifes an adventure theres so much to do
If you have a dream your dream can come true
You can go walkin on peppermint clouds
And see yourself being a real circus clown
Sail on a river of strawberry cream
Be a star or an astronaut, follow your dream
A whole world of wonder is waiting for you
lifes an adventure theres so much to do
If you have a dream your dream can come true
If you have a dream your dream can come true
A whole world of wonder is waiting for you
lifes an adventure theres so much to do
If you have a dream your dream can come true
Dream on...dream my love
A dream is a whisper from above
If you have a dream your dream can come true
A whole world of wonder is waiting for you
lifes an adventure theres so much to do
