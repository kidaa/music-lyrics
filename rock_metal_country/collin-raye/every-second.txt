Wayne Perry/Gerald Smith
Well listen dear I think it's clear
We need to sit and talk
Seems you've got this notion I've been having second thoughts
Well I must confess in a way I guess that silly notion's true
'Cause every second you're not here I think of you
Every second, every minute, every hour of every day
Every second there's a thought of you that comes my way
So if you ask that I've had second thoughts I'd have to say
Every second, every minute, every hour of every day.
Now I propose we drink a toast and turn the lights down low
Put our favoritie music on and hold each other close
Don't worry dear you'll always be here in my heart to stay
Every second, every minute, every hour of every day
Every second, every minute, love you more and more each day
