I know youre listening as I lay me down to sleep 
Its not for me I ask, but my childrens souls to keep
It seems the world is going crazy
And though I need to do my share
Could you please take them under wing
Watch over them especially
Keeping them safe from everything
This is a mothers prayer
I know youre listening in the silence of the night
The news is blistering but I hold on to your light
And though theres darkness all around us
By my faith I know youre there
Give me the strength to lead the way
Send me the words I need to say
Use me to guide them day to day
This is a mothers prayer
This is a fathers prayer
I know I cant do this by my self
I thank you for your help
I know youre listening so I know Im not alone
I  feel you here with me as we all face down the unknown
Could you return us to your garden
Where no ones hurt and no ones scared
Free us from pride and bitterness
Keep us so close we wont forget 
Teach us to love as you love
This is a mothers prayer
This is a fathers prayer
Teach us to love as you love
This is a mothers, a fathers prayer
