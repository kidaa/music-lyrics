Brent Maher/Thom Schuyler
Everybody's heart is torn and tattered
Mine was not designed for giving up
'Cause all I've ever done that really matters
Is what I did for love
So count me with the wounded and the shaken
Even when I'm barely standing up
I've tried to offer more than I have taken
That's what I did for love
What I did for love
I gave everything
And I hope that you can see
All that love has given me
When they sit and list the reasons I existed
I'm afraid it won't add up to very much
'Cause I gathered all I had and gladly risked it
That's what I did for love
Yeah
What I did for love
I gave everything
And I hope that you can see
All that love has given me
Someday I may silently surrender
When this old heart has finally had enough
But I hope that I will always be remembered
By what I did for love
See all I've ever done that really matters
Is what I did for love
