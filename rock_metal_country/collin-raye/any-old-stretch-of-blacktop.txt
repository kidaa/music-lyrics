Frank J. Meyers/Bernie Nelson
I got money in my pocket and a guitar in my hand
These lonely nights without you are more than I can stand
I work like a puppet
But it's time to cut the strings
Well I hit the ground running
And I won't be looking back
I'll be like a locomotive headed down a one way track
It won't take too long just you wait and see
As long as it will lead me back to you
Any old stretch of blacktop will do
North, south, east or west
Been everywhere it seems
Uptown rooms and honky tonks don't feel like home to me
I'll be stepping out the rhythm while I'm singing a new song
And it's knowing where I'm going that will keep me moving on
Turn my collar to the wind and put my thumb up in the air
Flag a diesal down or catch a bus from anywhere
Colorado, California, or even Kalamazoo
As long as it will lead me back to you
Any old stretch of blacktop will do
Well I hit the ground running
And I won't be looking back
I'll be like a locomotive headed down a one way track
It won't take too long just you wait and see
As long as it will lead me back to you
Any old stretch of blacktop will do
Alright
