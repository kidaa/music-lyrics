YOU WANNA KNOW WHERE WE GO FROM HERE
SO MANY ROADS, BUT NONE THAT SEEN CLEAR.
IS WHAT WE HAVE ENOUGH TO LAST A WHOLE LIFE THROUGH
WHO KNOWS? BABY WHO KNOWS?
SO YOU'RE ASKING ME WHAT DO WE DO
CUZ TIME MOVES SO FAST AND THE CHANCES SEEM SO FEW
IS IT TOO MUCH TO THINK THAT WE COULD HAVE IT ALL?
WHO KNOWS?  WE MAY NEVER KNOW.
CHORUS
BUT IF I WERE YOU, I'D PROMISE TO LIVE LIFE FOR ALL IT'S WORTH
TAKE ALL THAT YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN 
AND LEAVE YOUR MARK UPON THIS EARTH
TRUST YOUR HEART TO SHOW YOU EVERYTHING YOU'LL EVER NEED
AND IF I WERE YOU, I'D FALL IN LOVE WITH ME.
SO HOLD ME CLOSE, I'LL KISS AWAY YOUR FEARS.
I WON'T PROMISE THE MOON, BUT I PROMISE TO BE HERE.
AND WHAT IF TOGETHER IT GETS BETTER EVERY DAY
WHO KNOWS? BABY WHO KNOWS?
CHORUS
