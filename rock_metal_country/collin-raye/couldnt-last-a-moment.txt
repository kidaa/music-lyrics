I thought it was over
I thought I could move on
But I was wrong
I woke up last night
Calling your name
Feeling the blame baby
Thought I could quit you but
I still miss your love
What was I thinking
Thinking that I could still
Walk down the street
Without you by my side
Or make it through one night
Alone I lied
I said a lot of things
I didn't really mean
How can I make you see
What matters most to me
Girl I shoulda known it
I couldn't last a moment without you
You've got every right
To turn and walk away
I can't make you stay
I broke your heart
I wasted so much precious time baby
I see you with your friends
Wearing a smile again
What was I thinking
Thinking that I could still
Walk down the street
Without you by my side
Or make it through one night
Alone I lied
I said a lot of things
I didn't really mean
How can I make you see
What matters most to me
Girl I shoulda known it
I couldn't last a moment without you
Thought I could quit you
But I still miss your love
What was I thinking
Thinking that I could still
Walk down the street
Without you by my side
Or make it through one night
Alone I lied
I said a lot of things
I didn't really mean
How can I make you see
What matters most to me
Girl I shoulda known it
I couldn't last a moment without you
Oh girl I shoulda known it
I couldn't last a moment
Without you
