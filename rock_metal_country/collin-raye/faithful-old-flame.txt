Lonnie WIlson/Brent Mason
You come around most every night
Looking for my heart
Each time I turn out the light
I can count on you to start
Bringing back sweet memories
Of the love we made
You never change
YOu're a faithful old flame
I know you'll be here right on time
To ear me up again
You never stay away too long
And give me a chance to mend
Tears won't drown your fire in me
It's even worse when it rains
You never stray from a faithful old flame
Just when I think you're gone
You start the fire 
And I yearn for your touch
That i miss so much
Embers of love glow even brighter
Than they did
Yesterday, they won't go away
I've tried my best
To put you out
But the spark remains
It's still the same
You're a faithful old flame
You never stray 
You're a faithful old flame
