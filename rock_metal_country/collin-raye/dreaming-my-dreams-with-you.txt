Dreaming My Dreams With You
Allen Reynolds
I hope it won't be that wrong anymore
Maybe I've learned this time
I hope that I find what I'm reachin' for
The way it is in my mind
Someday I'll get over you
I'll live to see it all through
But I'll always miss dreaming my dreams with you.
But I won't let it change me, not if I can
I'd rather believe in love
And give it away as much as I can
To those that I'm fondest of.
Someday I'll get over you
I'll live to see it all through
But I'll always miss dreaming my dreams with you.
Someday I'll get over you
I'll live to see it all through
But I'll always miss dreaming my dreams with you
