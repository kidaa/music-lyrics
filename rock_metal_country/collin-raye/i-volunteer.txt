Looks like your feelin' like
The rain won't ever stop
Life's left you standing there
One against the odds
Fro now on you need to know
You don't have to stand alone
When the world turns you in circles
And the wind is at your face
When you need somewhere to run to
I know a place
If you want someone who's willing
To lay down their heart
Someone to dry your tears
I'm here
I volunteer
A shoulder, a caring voice
To tell you it's ok
Arms meant for holding you
Whenever your afraid
I've got that and more to spare
Just say the word and I'll be there
When the world turns you in circles
And the wind is at your face
When you need somewhere to run to
I know a place
If you want someone who's willing
To lay down their heart
Someone to dry your tears
I'm here
I volunteer
