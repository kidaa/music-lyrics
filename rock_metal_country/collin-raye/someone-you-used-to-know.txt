I ain't gonna lie to you
And say it didn't hurt
To see you with someone new
And you were wearing my old blue shirt
But it didn't kill me until we said hello
And I became someone you used to know
Like a friend, like a fool
Like some guy you knew in school
Didn't we love, didn't we share
Or don't you even care
I know we said we were through
But I never knew how quickly I would go
From someone you loved
To someone you used to know
Bet you didn't tell him
'Bout those weekends at the coast
Or how we used to argue
'Bout who loved who the most
Well I guess I won that one, 'cause I still need you so
But to you I'm just someone you used to know
Like a friend, like a fool
Like some guy you knew in school
Didn't we love, didn't we share
Or don't you even care
I know we said we were through
But I never knew how quickly I would go
From someone you loved
To someone you used to know
Didn't we love, didn't we share
Or don't you even care
I know we said that we were through
But I never knew how quickly I would go
From someone you loved
To someone you used to know
I'm not someone you love
I'm someone you used to know
