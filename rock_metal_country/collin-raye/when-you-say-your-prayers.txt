Jason Blume/Karen Taylor-Good
If youve ever wondered
When you pray at night
If it makes a difference
If it sets things right
Everytime we say our prayers
Whispered in the dark
Somewhere deep inside you
You know with all your heart
As sure as Gods in Heaven
Theres someone who cares
And somebodys listening
When you say your prayers
A prayer can be a thank-you
A prayer can be a wish
A prayer can say Im sorry
Like a hug or a kiss
It doesnt have to be just right
God hears you loud and clear
As long as it comes from your heart
It goes right to his ear
As sure as Gods in Heaven
Theres someone who cares
And somebodys listening
When you say your prayers
As sure as Gods in Heaven
Theres someone who cares
And somebodys listening
When you say your prayers
Just know somebodys listening
