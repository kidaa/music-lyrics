Allen Shamlin/Gary Burr
I'm a man of my word
I mean what I say
My pledge is my bond
Well
 that's just my way
When you've made a promise
To someone who's gone
Well
 that's when forever
Seems a little too long
I'm a man of my word
And
 I made you a vow
I swore that I'd love you
And I can't change that now
They tell me I'm free
To find someone new
I just don't have the heart
'Cause I gave mine to you
I said my love
Would last for all time
And
 no one
Would take your place
Well if that promise
Was the last sound you heard
Well you know I kept it
I'm a man of my word
I'm a
 man of my word
And it's cost me so dear
'Cause those words are a prison
Without
 you here
And I'll go to my grave
With this torch held high
Bust just
 once I wish
I had told you a lie.
Yes I'll always love you
I'm
 a man of my word
