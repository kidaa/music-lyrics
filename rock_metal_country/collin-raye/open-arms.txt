Jonathan Cain/Steve Perry
Lying beside you here in the dark
Feeling your heart beat with mine
Softly you whisper you're so sincere
How could our love be so blind
We sailed on together and drifted apart
And here you are by my side
So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am with open arms
Hoping you'll see what you're love means to me
Open arms
Living without you living alone
This empty house is so cold
Wanting to hold you wanting you near
How much I've wanted you home
But now that you've come back
Turned night into day
I need you to stay
So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am with open arms
Hoping you'll see what you're love means to me
Open arms
