The cool cat knows when its time to relax
And get some rest
And that cool cat likes to unwind inhis room
Cause its the best
All the bestest boys and groovy girls
Are sure of one thing they have found
That cool cat knows how to settle
Whoa, the cool cat knows how to run fast and play hard
With all his friends
And that cool cat combs every inch of his yard
Till its time to go in and take a bath
Put his jammies on
And brush those teeth just right
Cause a cool cat knows how to say goodnight
Aint nothin like a bedtime story
When Mom or even Dad will do 
And when you wake in the morning
You feel good...so good
Cause a good nights rest is what makes you
A cool cat
All the bestest boys and groovy girls
Are sure of one thing they have found
That cool cat knows how to settle
A cool cat knows where its at
