John Lennon/Paul McCartney
Blackbird singing in the dead of night,
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All you life,
You were only waiting for this moment to arise.
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All you life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise.
Blackbird, fly
Blackbird, fly
Into the light of a dark, black night
Blackbird, fly
Blackbird, fly
Into the light of a dark, black night.
Blackbird singing in the dead of night,
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All you life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise.
