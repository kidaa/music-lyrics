Today the air cleared up
The lights came on bright
Years of heavy weight
In a moment turned light
I'd thought love could only look
Dark as if through a glass
I just turned into an open book
Reading easy at last
Tonight my walls came down
Like a brick through a plate glass window
With a wrecking ball sound
Like old Jericho
Laid swift to the ground
I'm not sure when, but baby you're how
The walls came down
I've never trusted much
Got my reasons like most
Stayed well protected from
Every thorn on each rose
Taking those wayward trips
Only to turn back and run
Sailing all my relationships
Could not have dreamed up this one
Tonight my walls came down
Like a brick through a plate glass window
With a wrecking ball sound
Like old Jericho
Laid swift to the ground
I'm not sure when, but baby you're how
The walls came down
You make sense to me
In a world where just a few things do make sense to me
In your heart I'll put my trust
Through whatever is in front of us
Tonight my walls came down
Like a brick through a plate glass window
With a wrecking ball sound
Like old Jericho
Laid swift to the ground
I'm not sure when, but baby you're how
The walls came down
Ooh baby you're how the walls came down
Oh the walls came down
I'm not sure when but baby your how
The walls came down
Baby your how the walls came down
