Collin Raye
Well Duggan was a purebred hill country kicker
He loved to shoot his pistols
And he loved to drink his liquor
His daddy had long since given up on tryin'
To tame him
He knew he hated sweatin' in the fields
He couldn't blame him
But when his only son robbed the Chillicothe Flyer
He guessed the days were numbered
Till he'd have to face the fire
Well Duggan rode up to the house
His pa ran out to meet him
He said ";Son, why'd you do it?";
Duggan said ";I had my reasons";
His daddy told him, ";Boy, you've always been
So full of juice, but any day your neck
It will be hangin' in a noose.";
Duggan winked and mounted, stirred his
Horse into a lather
He never looked back... guess it really didn't matter
It wasn't too long till a team of Texas Rangers
Pounded on the door, man, faces
Filled with anger
Duggan's papa opened up, said ";No need to shout,
I don't know where he is
But I know what he's all about.";
He likes to dance out to the edge
He likes to cut to the chase
You see he's never been one for reinin' back
To a slow and steady pace
If you ask me where he's bound
Well, boys, I just can't respond
But from the look in his eyes
It's a safe bet he's headed
To the border and beyond.
Well the moral of this tale
Is you can't change a leopard's spots
Don't blame a man for failing to be
Something that he's not
So girl, with that in mind
Won't you step into the light
We'll move just left of center
Till we finally get it right
Remember I'm a push it to the limit
Kind of guy
You may ask me how we'll do it
But no need to ask me why
I like to dance out to the edge
I like to cut to the chase
You see, I've never been one for reinin' back
To a slow and steady pace
If you ask me where we're bound
Well, honey, I just can't respond
But from the look in your eyes
It's a safe bet we're headed
To the border and beyond.
