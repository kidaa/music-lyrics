There's a look on your face that says your leavin'
You've already got one foot out the door
If it's new love or not like that you're leavin'
I won't leave the light on anymore
I still believe we could hold it together
But there's something I want you to know
When I gave you my heart I gave it forever
But you can't take it with you when you go
While you're packing your suitcase pack my memories
'Cause I don't want them around here when you're gone
And if you let that door close behind you
Say goodbye to the love we have known
Chorus
When I gave you my heart I gave it forever
But you can't take it with you when you go
