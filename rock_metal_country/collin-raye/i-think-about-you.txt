Don Schlitz/Steve Seskin
Everytime I see a woman on a billboard sign
I think about you
Saying ";drink this beer and you'll be mine";
I think about you
When an actress on a movie screen
Plays Lolita in some old man's dreams
It doesn't matter who she is
I think about you
When I see a pretty woman walking down the street
I think about you
Men look her up and down like she's some kind of treat
I think about you
She wouldn't dare talk to a stranger
always has to be aware of the danger
it doesn't matter who she is
I think about
Chorus:
You eight years old
big blue eyes and a heart of gold
when I look at this world, I think about
You and I can't help but see
that every woman used to be
Somebody's little girl, I think about you
Everytime I hear people say it's never gonna change
I think about you
Like it's some kind fo joke, some kind of game
I think about you
When I see a woman on the news
who didn't ask to be abandoned or abused
it doesn't matter who she is
I think about
Chorus
When I look at this world I think about you
