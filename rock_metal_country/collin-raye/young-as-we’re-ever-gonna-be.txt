Everyone tells them that they're too young to know
'Bout the ways of the world and curves that fate can throw
They'd never ask for much with their backs against the wall
He turns to her, says, baby tonight let's take it all
'Cause tonight we are as young as we're ever gonna be
These may be the best days of our lives
Who knows as we grow older if we'll ever feel this free
Tonight we are as young as we're ever gonna be
A man and a woman who've been left behind
Knowing age is the enemy of hearts and minds
The freedom of faith has made them reckless and sincere
He says, darlin?we've got one last chance at some magic here
'Cause tonight we are as young as we're ever gonna be
These may be the best days of our lives
Who knows as we grow older if we'll ever feel this free
Tonight we are as young as we're ever gonna be
Everywhere you look there's caution outside lookin?in
Searchin?for that perfect circumstance
But time never has stood still and it ain't about to start
The sidelines are covered with wreckage of wasted hearts
'Cause tonight we are as young as we're ever gonna be
These may be the best days of our lives
Who knows as we grow older if we'll ever feel this free
Tonight we are as young as we're ever gonna be
Oh
'Cause tonight we are as young as we're ever gonna be
These may be the best days of our lives
Who knows as we grow older if we'll ever feel this free
Tonight we are as young as we're ever gonna be
Oh, tonight
