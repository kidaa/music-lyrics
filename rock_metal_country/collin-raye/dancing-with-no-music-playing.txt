Billy Montana/Don Ellis
Me in my rented tuxedo, you in your big sister's dress
I could hear my own heart beating, when you laid your head on my chest. 
No telling how long it was since the last song
With the band gone and the lights all faded.
All alone on that gym floor, dancing with no music playing.
Me in my rented tuxedo, you in your mama's white dress
Rice in your hair, your shoes in one hand, and one hand caressing my neck.
The light from the moon filled that old hotel room
As my hands closed around your waist.
And we were holding each other, dancing with no music playing
Ohhhh, there's nothing to say
Youuu take me away
Dancing with no music playing
Oh, dancing with no music playing
instrumental
Me in my old faded Levi's, you in your blue cotton dress
Time it don't have no effect on the way that you still steal my breath. 
As we spin once more across the cold kitchen floor,
Your warm cheek touches my face,
And I could die in your arms, dancing with no music playing
Oh, I could die in your arms, dancing with no music playing
Mmm
Dancing with no music playing
