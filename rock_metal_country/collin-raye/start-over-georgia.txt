I think I feel like an old beat up two lane
The one that the state's not about to repair
From where I'm falling I think I might meet you
Below where we were just above just don't care
The way the world's changing I just can't accept it
No right or wrong all in between
The faith we were raised on is weathered and shaken
But baby it don't have to be
'Cause I still believe in a prayer before supper
And passing the time round the old courthouse square
We've got nothing to keep us from start over Georgia
We'll leave all the baggage and start over there
Well I've never been to that part of the country
Save for some old movies and deep in my mind
Where it's accepted and even rewarded
To stand on your own right side of the line
Nobody wins here, we're all scare of losing
I feel scarred right down to the bone
Maybe we'll find ourselves close to the ocean
Where freedom first breathes on it's own
'Cause I still believe in a prayer before supper
And passing the time round the old courthouse square
We've got nothing to keep us from start over Georgia
We'll leave all the baggage and start over there
Oh we've got nothing to keep us from start over Georgia
We'll leave all the baggage and start over there
