Chuck Cannon/Chuck Jones
Can you feel that rush
Makes the whole world hush
Makes your flesh go flush
You break a sweat
Is your soul on fire
With your hearts desire
Out there on the wire
Without a net
Does it take your breath
Are you scared to death
With one kiss
We'll be risking it all
If we dance this dance
If we take this chance
We'll be landing in love
When we fall
It's an act of God
It's against all odds
And we hold lightening rods
Up in the sky
It's that leap of faith
We all have to take
But hearts don't have to break
When they can fly
Does it take your breath
Are you scared to death
With one kiss
We'll be risking it all
If we dance this dance
If we take this chance
We'll be landing in love
When we fall
If we dance this dance
If we take this chance
We'll be landing in love
One more kiss, one more touch
We'll be landing in love
When we fall
