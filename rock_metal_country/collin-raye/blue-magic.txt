I hear your favorite music on the jukebox
And right away I know that you are here
You always pick a time 
Just when I think my mind is clear you reappear
And once again you've got me in your power
This time I hope it's not a brief romance
'Cause it's too late to run
You've got me thinking one slow dance is worth a chance
Then that old blue magic still works like a charm
As if you never even left these aching arms
You put a spell on me I guess I'll always be hypnotized
By that blue magic in your eyes
Though I should run and hide from this illusion
Your smile is so much quicker than my pride
There's something up your sleeve
That makes my heart believe inside 
This carpet ride might lift us up and fly us to forever
But up 'til now its all been slight of hand
I've got to face the fact one look and 
I'm right back at your command
'Cause that old blue magic still works like a charm
As if you never even left these aching arms
You put a spell on me I guess I'll always be hypnotized
By that blue magic in your eyes
Yes, you put a spell on me I guess I'll always be hypnotized
By that blue magic.. that old blue magic... that blue magic in your eyes
