Richard Fagan/Gordon Kennedy
When you told me
That we were through
I thought it would be easy
Getting over you
Now I know that it's gonna take some time
'Cause when I come home now
What do I see
So many memories staring at me
I know you left
But you left so much behind
It's plain to see your hold on me
Just keeps on going strong
You've got a long way to go
Before you're gone
I can't take this anymore
I'm half of what I was before
Ever since I lost my better half
When I close my eyes
You're all I see
You're even walking in my sleep
I wanna cry but then I gotta laugh
It's plain to see your hold on me
Just keeps on going strong
You've got a long way to go
Before you're gone
It still ain't clear that you ain't here
To hear me babble on
'Cause you've got a long way to go
Before you're gone
If you come back we can start anew
'Cause I'm so miserable without you
It's kind of like you never left at all
It's plain to see your hold on me
Just keeps on going strong
You've got a long way to go
Before you're gone
