Jason Blume/Karen Taylor-Good
This is the woman
Who had all the answers
The one I would lean on
For comfort, for strength
She's never forgotten
One grandchild's birthday
Now she can't remember my name
And it makes me so angry
I shake my fist
And cry out to the heavenly one
Why would you play
Such a cold hearted trick
I thought your job was to love
And the answer came down from above
She's gonna fly
When her time here is through
First she'll have to let go
Of some things she can't use
'Cause people and places
Memories and faces
Are just way too heavy it seems
To carry on angel's wings
This is the woman
Who saw things so clearly
The one who could pick out
One crumb on the floor
She saw through a white lie
Saw me through love's eyes
She hardly can see anymore
And it makes me so sad
And it just isn't fair
Why should so much be taken away
But when I cry out
For all that she's lost
I silently hear someone say
She's gonna fly
When her time here is through
First she'll have to let go
Of some things she can't use
'Cause people and places
Memories and faces
Are just way too heavy it seems
To carry on angel's wings
And oh, the wonders she'll see
And I know she'll remember
To watch over me
She's gonna fly
When her time here is through
First she'll have to let go
Of some things she can't use
'Cause people and places
Memories and faces
Are just way too heavy it seems
To carry on angel's wings
To carry on angel's wings
