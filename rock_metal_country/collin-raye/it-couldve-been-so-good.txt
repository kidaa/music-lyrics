Chris Walters/Lonnie Wilson
When I think about you leaving and being here alone
It's not the love we knew that hurts me
But the love we could have known
I'm not sorry that I held you
I just wish that I still could
Oh it's not that it was so bad
It just could've been so good
I don't regret one moment that we had together
What's killing me is knowing we could have had forever
I just wish we loved each other the way I know we could
Oh it's not that it was so bad
It just could've been so good
I don't want to lose the memories of all the nights we shared
And I never found a new love that ever could compare
I just wish we hadn't left things standing where they stood
Girl it's not that it was so bad
It just could've been so good
Chorus
Oh it's not that it was so bad
It just could've been so good
