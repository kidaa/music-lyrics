I look down the road that winds in the distance
And wonder where it might lead
I only know it makes no difference
As long as you walk with me
Chorus
Many a mile we will travel
Many a dream we will share
Many a time we will gladly take the long way there
With every step we will draw closer
With every step our love will grow
Take my hand, we have many a mile to go
True love is not a destination
But one day we will arrive
This is the journey we will be taking
The rest of our lives
Repeat Chorus
There will be days we're missing
All the places our love has been
There will be joy in knowing the best
Is still around the bend
With every step we will draw closer
That every turn our love will grow
Take my hand, we have many a mile to go
Take my hand, we have many a mile to go
