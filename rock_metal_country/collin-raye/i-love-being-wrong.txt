Billy Kirsch/John Jarrard
I was absolutely certain
I'd made up my mind
I'd never fall for you
Not in this lifetime
You said I was mistaken
I'd be yours in the end
I never thought it could happen
But baby you win
And I love being wrong when it feels like it feels tonight
I'd a whole lot rather be here in your arms than be right
Now that we're together, wish I hadn't waited so long
I'm finding out how much I love being wrong
Under normal circumstances
I think I know my stuff
But the rules all change
When it comes to love
It's the last thing I expected
Now it's all that I want
Just in case you're feeling guilty
Baby don't
'Cause I love being wrong when it feels like it feels tonight
I'd a whole lot rather be herein your arms than be right
Now that we're together, wish I hadn't waited so long
I'm finding out how much I love being wrong
