Mark Alan Springer/Shaye Smith
He finally gave in to his friend's girlfriend
When she said, ";there's someone you should meet";
At a crowded restaurant way cross town
He waited impatiently
When she walked in their eyes met
and they both stared
And right there and then everyone else disappeared but
Chorus:
One boy, one girl, two hearts beating wildly
To put it mildly it was love at first sight
He smiled, she smiled, and they knew right away
This was the day they'd waited for all their lives
And for a moment the whole world revolved
Around one boy and one girl
In no time at all they were standing there
In the front of a little church
In front of their friends and family
Repeating those sacred words
Preacher said, ";son kiss your bride";
and he raised her veil
Like the night they met time just stood still
Repeat Chorus
He was holding her hand when the doctor looked up and grinned
";congratulations, twins";
Repeat Chorus
