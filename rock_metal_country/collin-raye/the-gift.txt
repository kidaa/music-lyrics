Jim Brickman
Winter snow is falling down
Children laughing all around
Lights are turning on like a fairy tale come true
Sittin' by the fire we made
You're the answer when I prayed
I would find someone and baby I found you
And all I want is to hold you forever
All I need is you more everyday
You saved my heart from being broken apart
You gave your love away
And I'm thankful everyday
For the gift
Watching as you softly sleep
What I'd give if I could keep
Just this moment if only time stood still
But the colors fade away
And the years will make us gray
But baby in my eyes you'll still be beautiful
And all I want is to hold you forever
All I need is you more everyday
You saved my heart from being broken apart
You gave your love away
And I'm thankful everyday
For the gift
All I want is to hold you forever
All I need is you more everyday
You saved my heart from being broken apart
You gave your love away
And I'm thankful everyday
Can't find the words to say
Thank you for the gift
