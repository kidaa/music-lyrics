I'm just a fool for April
There's nothing more to say
Long as I can remember
She's led my heart astray
When I was green as willow
She had me ditchin' school
And even then she tricked me
I'm just an April fool
She tangles dogwood blossoms
Into her yellow hair
She uses the same perfume
The smoky mountains wear
She keeps the flame of summer
'Round her neck like a jewel
She breezes in to see me
And I'm an April fool
She entrances me and she dances me
And she flies me like a kite
And I soon forget she's only come to play
Then there comes a day when she will not stay
And I lie awake all night
Hoping next time April may
When I walked out this morning
April had up and gone
And it clear as water
She'd only led me on
And it will be next winter
Before my heels will cool
And then I will forgive her
I'm just an April fool
She knows I will forgive her
I'm just an April fool
