Michael McDonald
It was so right
It was so wrong
Almost at the same time
The pain and ache
A heart can take 
No one really knows
When the memories cling
And keep you there
'Til you no longer care
And you can let go now
It's wrong for me
To cling to you
Somehow I just needed time
From what was to be
It's not like me
To hold somebody down
But I was tossed high by love
Almost never came down
Only to land here
But love's no longer found
Where I'm no longer bound
And I can let go now
I can let go now
