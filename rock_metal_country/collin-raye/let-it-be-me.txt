I bless the day I found you
I want to stay around you
And so I beg you
Let it be me
Don't take this heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever 
Let it be me
Each time we make love
I found complete love
Without your sweet love
What would life be
So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that you'll always
Let it be me
Each time we made love
I found complete love
Without your sweet love
What would life be
So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that you'll always
Let it be me
Promise you'll always
Let it be me
