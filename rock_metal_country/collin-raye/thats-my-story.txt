I came in as the sun came up
She glared at me over her coffee cup
She said where you been, so I thought real hard and said,
I fell asleep in that hammock in the yard
She said you don't know it boy but you just blew it
I said well that's my story and I'm stickin' to it
That's my story, that's my story
Well I ain't got a witness I can't prove it but
That's my story and I'm stickin' to it
Well I got that deer in the headlights look
She read my face like the cover of a book, and said
Don't expect me to believe all that static
'Cause just last week I through that hammock in the attic
My skin got so thin you could see right through it
And I started that's my story and I'm stickin' to it
That's my story, that's my story
That's my story, that's my story
Well I ain't got a witness I can't prove it but
That's my story and I'm stickin' to it
You know time comes when a wise man knows the best thing
That he can do is just look her up in the eye
And beg for mercy and face the bitter truth
Well honey me and the boys played cards all night
Wasn't no hanky panky not a woman in sight
And I know I shoulda called and baby I'm really sorry
Let's get a cellular phone then you won't have to worry
You know how much I love you and darling I'm ready to prove it
And that's my story and I'm stickin' to it
That's my story, that's my story
That's my story, that's my story
Well I ain't got a witness and you know I can't prove it but
That's my story and I'm stickin' to it
You know I ain't gonna do a thing
Unless you approve it and
That's my story and I'm stickin' to it
