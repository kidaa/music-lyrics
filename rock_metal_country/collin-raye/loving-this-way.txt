I'm tired of watching me hurt you
I'm tired of being the teardrops on your face
I'm tired of loving this way
I'm tired of loving this way
I know your every weakness
I can find one in everything you say
I'm tired of loving this way
I'm tired of loving this way
I'm not the one that you really need
I'm not the one in your dreams
I can see it in your eyes
This ain't the way it should feel
I don't know how we got here
Love's no longer blind
If that's just how it is
Can we go on like this
Oh, baby what do you say
I'm tired of loving this way
I'm tired of loving this way
I'll set your heart free
And if you're mine
You'll come flying back some day
But I'm tired of loving this way
I'm tired of loving this way
Well I'm taking you with me
Like a room in my heart
You will have your place
I'm tired of loving this way
I'm tired of loving this way
I'm not the one that you really need
I'm not the one in your dreams
I can see it in your eyes
This ain't the way it should feel
I don't know how we got here
Love's no longer blind
If that's just how it is
Can we go on like this
Oh, baby what do you say
I'm tired of loving this way
I'm tired of loving this way
