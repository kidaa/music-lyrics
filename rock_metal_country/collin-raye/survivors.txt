You've been my best friend all these years
You've kept holding on to me through all the trials and the tears
Only you and I could know all the sacrifices
That let this feeling grow
There were so many times we could have said goodbye
We could have called it quits but honey you and I
We're survivors we made through the storm
When I've needed shelter I've found it in your arms
Survivors in love enough to fight
Together in this thing for life
There were times I lost my mind
Took some wrong turns you got me back in line
There were times you lost control
But I stood by you I loved you heart and soul
When faith was tested and dreams were fading fast
We held each other close until the rain had passed
We're survivors we made through the storm
When I've needed shelter I've found it in your arms
Survivors in love enough to fight
Together in this thing for life
A little time and tenderness
Has seen us through the years
We'll still be side by side
When the final smoke has cleared
We're survivors we made through the storm
When I've needed shelter I've found it in your arms
Survivors in love enough to fight
Together in this thing for life
Together in this thing for life
