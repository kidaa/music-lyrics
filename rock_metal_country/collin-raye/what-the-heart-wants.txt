Michael Dulaney
She met him down at the laundrymat
3 a.m. on a washing machine they sat
And talked til dawn
He bought her breakfast at a small cafe
Morning turned to the rest of the day
When the day was gone
He thought that she'd surely runaway
No fairy tale ever started this way but
It ain't the mind that calls the shots round here
When stronger powers pull two bodies near
Nothing on earth can interfere
When love is
What the heart wants
They made a wish on the evening star
From a rooftop high above the boulevard
Up in the twilight sky
He held her hand she held her breathe
Two lonely hearts beating scared to death
Of the chance to fly
Giving in to the arms of fate
This isn't quite like the plans that they make but
It ain't the mind that calls the shots round here
When stronger powers pull two bodies near
Nothing on earth can interfere
When love is
What the heart wants
It ain't the mind that calls the shots round here
When stronger powers pull two bodies near
Nothing on earth can interfere
When love is
What the heart wants
