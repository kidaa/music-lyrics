Way down at the bottom
Both sides come together and form a V
And that's what mama calls
The corner of the heart
She says a lot of couples never turn that corner
They don't love that deep
They care a little while
Then they drift apart
Well now baby if you wonder why
I'm telling you all of this
It's because something is changing
I can feel it when we kiss
And if the moon keeps rising
You better hold on, I am
Turning the corner of of the heart
Back in Albuquerque
Near the river there was a cottonwood
One summer hooked up
With a climbing rose
And by the time it snowed
They were so tangled
Nothin' on earth could
Get that handsome couple to let go
Well now baby this world spins too quick
For the eye to see
The slow changing of a stranger into family
But if the moon keeps rising
You better hold on, I am
Turning the corner of the heart
Yes if the moon keeps rising
You better hold on, I am
Turning the corner of of the heart
Turning the corner of the heart
Turning the corner of the heart
Corner of the heart
