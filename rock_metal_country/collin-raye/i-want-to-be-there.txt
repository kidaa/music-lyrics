I love you and your tango dress
And going where the music says
I pray this love song never ends
'Cause when we spin like this
I know where heaven is
Right here in the moment that we're in
Love happens when we get this close
Whatever happens, don't let go
I want to be there
When you dance
When you laugh
When you cry
For the rest of our lives
I want to be there
In your arms
In your world
In your heart
Wherever you are
I want to be there
Every night's like a New Year's Eve
Every day that you're here with me
Every touch is a cause for celebration
I want to be your birthday kiss
I want to be your every wish
I want to be your strongest temptation
Through all the years that go by
You'll find me right here by your side
I want to be there
When you dance
When you laugh
When you cry
For the rest of our lives
I want to be there
In your arms
In your world
In your heart
Wherever you are
I want to be there
I want to be there
When you dance
When you laugh
When you cry
For the rest of our lives
I want to be there
In your arms
In your world
In your heart
Wherever you are
I want to be there
When you laugh and when you cry
For the rest of our lives
I want to be there
I want to be there
In the good times
And in the bad times too, baby
I want to be there
I want to be there
'Till the end of time with you now
When you laugh and when you cry baby
For the rest of our lives
