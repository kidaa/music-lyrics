Sweet miss behavin'
Honey now is it true
You got the whole town talkin'
About the things you do
They say you're trouble
But trouble never looked so good
Are you miss behavin'
Or a little miss understood
You like to dance
You like to flirt
Shake and shimmy
In your mini skirt
You're leading me on
To an early grave
Honey won't you please behave
Sweet miss behavin'
Honey now it ain't right
If you're miss behavin'
With anyone but me tonight
Well you caused the train
To jump the track
You just kept goin'
And you never looked back
You show no mercy
Got no shame
Honey won't you please behave
Sweet miss behavin'
Honey now it ain't right
If you're miss behavin'
With anyone but me tonight
Sweet miss behavin'
Honey let's do it right
We'll go miss behavin'
Together tonight
Let's go miss behavin' tonight
