Harlan Howard
All I can be is a sweet memory
That drifts through your mind time from time
I can never be more than a knock on your door
Just a shadow that's gone with the sunshine
For you know I'm not free
And I never can be
And your bound to get restless in time
All I can be is a sweet memory
That drifts through your mind
Tonight I'll share the silence
While lying here with you
Sands of time have trickled down
Just a precious few
You're young and so beautiful
And I'm glad that I'm here
But the ending is painfully clear
All I can be is a sweet memory
Of someone you had to leave behind
Who loves you and needs you
Never could give you
A ring for your finger so fine
So tonight we'll just borrow each other
Tomorrow we'll find we've run out of time
All I can be is a sweet memory
That drifts through your mind
For you know I'm not free
And I never can be
And your bound to get restless in time
All I can be is a sweet memory
That drifts through your mind
All I can be is a sweet memory
That drifts through your mind
