When I saw you buying Cosmo and a Hot Rod magazine
I said to myself now there's a girl for me
And when I asked you to go for a ride
You stole my heart when you said if I can drive
I said how 'bout some music, you said, you got any Merle?
That's when I knew you were my kind of girl
And when we started talking I could not believe my ears
You said you were a Braves fan even through the rotten years
You quoted William Faulkner and Martin Luther King
You said your favourite movie star would always be James Dean
And when we went to dinner you wore blue jeans with your pearls
That's when I knew you were my kind of girl
Yeah you march to the beat of a different drum
The funny thing is that I hear the same one
We both like to color outside of the lines
We're peas in a pod, girl we're two of a kind
Yeah you march to the beat of a different drum
The funny thing is that I hear the same one
We both like to color outside of the lines
We're two peas in a pod, girl we're two of a kind
I said I think I love you, you said what's not to love
I thought about a kiss but I wasn't quick enough
I guess while I was thinking you were reading my mind
'Cause you wrapped your arms around me and you pressed your lips to mine
You sent my head spinning like a Tilt-a-Wheel
That's when I knew you were my kind of girl
You sent my head spinning like a Tilt-a-Wheel
That's when I knew you were my kind of girl
My kind my kind of girl
My kind of girl
My kind my kind of girl
You're my kind of girl
My kind my kind of girl
My kind of girl
My kind my kind of girl
