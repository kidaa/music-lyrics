Gene LeSage/Tom Damphier
You were packed and ready to go
To your sister's
Back in Ohio
I knew you'd made up your mind
I couldn't stop you
And you didn't want me to try
The door was open
I watched you go
And I knew it was over
But I didn't know
It could be that easy
To walk away
It could be that easy
To make a change
If the heart is willin'
To start all over again
It was hard to believe
But you showed me
It could be that easy
Three weeks of bein' alone
Has left me seeing
What I should've seen all along
Your love means so much more
Than I ever told you
Than I ever showed you before
Now the car is running
And there's a sign out on the lawn
I'm packed and ready
To give up everything I own
It could be that easy
To walk away
It could be that easy
To make a change
If the heart is willing
To start all over again
It was hard to believe
But you showed me
It could be that easy
It could be that easy
To make a change
Build a new tomorrow
From yesterday
If the heart is willin'
To start all over again
Ohhh
Then so can we
Oh you gotta believe
It could be that easy
Baby, it could be that easy
