Three kids gathered in a huddle
Broomstick fishing pole hanging in a puddle
They think they can catch that big one anywhere
And I ain't gonna tell them 
Boys there ain't no fish in there
'Cause what they don't know
Just might be a blessing
Don't get 'em second guessing
Let 'em dream without a doubt
'Cause if they don't know 
It can't be done they just might do it
If no one can convince them
The odds are stacked against them
There's no telling how far they can go
On what they don't know
A child bride and a groom not much older
They've got a baby and the world on their shoulders
Six out of ten don't stand a chance to last a year
Oh but they're in love and they can't see that far from here
Chorus
Repeat Chorus
On what they don't know
