Tom Douglas
I know I've disappeared a time or two
Along the way I lost me and you
I needed a new town for my new start
I'm sellin' VCRs in Arkansas at a Walmart
I haven't had a drink in 19 days
My eyes are clear and bright with-out that haze
I like the preacher from the Church of Christ
I'm sorry that I cried when I talked to you last night
I think I'm on a roll
Here in Little Rock
I'm solid as a stone
Wait and see
I got just one small problem
Here in Little Rock
Without you
Baby I'm not me
Without you
Baby I'm not me
I don't know why I held it all inside
You must've thought I never even tried
You know your daddy told me when I left
Jesus would forgive, but a daddy don't forget
Lyin' here upon this motel bed
Thoughts of you explode within my head
Like a castle built upon the sand
I let love crumble in my hand
