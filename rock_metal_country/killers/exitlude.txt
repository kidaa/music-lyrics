Lure of a protean beast...
chattering teeth the poison of the instilled & insignificant murder - death as a show - dazed mob rushing at the clumsy executioner to free the torture victim ...
Broken bones, ripped limbs ...

On the cracked tongue & lust, expanded ...
Taken from a floor to another
Death as a transfiguration ...
The shaking eyes of the goddess with her string of skulls
