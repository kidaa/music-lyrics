I still recall 
The taste of your tears
Echoing your voice 
Just like the ringing in my ears
My favorite dreams of you 
Still wash ashore
Scraping through my head 
'Till I don't want to sleep anymore

Come on tell me
You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing
And I'm starting to scare myself
You make this all go away
You make it all go away

I just want something
I just want something 
I can never have
You always were the one 
To show me how
Back then 
I couldn't do the things 
That I can do now
This thing 
Is slowly taking me apart
Grey would be the color 
If I had a heart

I just want something 
I can never have
In this place 
It seems like such a shame
Though it all looks different now,
I know it's still the same
Everywhere I look 
You're all I see
Just a fading fucking reminder 
Of who I used to be

I just want something 
I just want something 
I can never have
I just want something 
I can never have
Think I know what you meant
That night on my bed
Still picking at this scab
