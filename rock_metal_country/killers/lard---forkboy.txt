A fork is a cold shiny tool
To pierce, tear and ingest
Whoever has the fork in hand
Controls the meal of its choice
We're told the first few punctures
They're for our own good
Better carved up in pieces
Than blown up in the oven

Forkboy
Flies by night on stolen fuel
To Santa Rosa, CA
Opens a fake employment office
 Want a job? Go get me drugs 
People desperate for work
Return to quite a surprise
Busted for intent to sell
Cops pay him a bounty
Forkboy skips town

We came
We peed 
We conquered
You bleed 
The choice: 
Fork Boy 
Or finger food
Ugly joy 
What does it replace? 
Why wait 
When you can eat 
Yourself alive today 
Junk bondage takeover glutton
Ready to bore in 
Unfold his rotary blades inside 
Pull the guts out and resell them 
Buys out his next target 
With the last one's pension funds
Thousands more thrown out of work 
So Leona won't have to settle for a mint 
Forkboy Picked by the FBI 
To be the black pied piper
After Dr. King died
Watches soap operas on TV
While 6 billion disappears from HUD
Who are you working for
What did you hope to gain
Why do you hate your past
So much you destroy 
The ones you love

Forkboy!
