I don't wanna be crippled and cracked
Shoulders wrists knees and back
Ground to dust and ash
Crawling on all fours

When you've got to feel that in your bones
When you've got to feel that in your bones

Now I can't climb the stairs
Pieces missing everywhere
Prozac painkillers

When you've got to feel that in your bones
When you've got to feel that in your bones
And I used to fly like Peter Pan
All the children flew when I touched their hands
They say you've got to feel that in your bones
They say you've got the feel that in your bones
