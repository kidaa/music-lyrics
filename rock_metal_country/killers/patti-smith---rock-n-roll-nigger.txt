Baby was a black sheep
Baby was a whore
Baby got big 
And baby get bigger
Baby get something 
Baby get more
Baby, baby, baby 
Was a rock-and-roll nigger
Oh, look around you, 
All around you,
Riding on a copper wave
Do you like 
The world around you?
Are you ready to behave?

Outside of society, 
they're waitin' for me
Outside of society, 
that's where I want to be

Baby was a black sheep
Baby was a whore
You know she got big
Well, she's gonna get bigger
Baby got a hand; 
Got a finger on the trigger
Baby, baby, baby 
Is a rock-and-roll nigger

Outside of society, 
That's where I want to be
Outside of society, 
They're waitin' for me

Those who have suffered,
Understand suffering,
And thereby extend their hand
The storm that brings harm
Also makes fertile
Blessed is the grass
And herb 
And the true thorn 
And light

I was lost 
In a valley of pleasure
I was lost 
In the infinite sea
I was lost, 
And measure for measure, 
Love spewed 
From the heart of me
I was lost, and the cost,
And the cost 
Didn't matter to me
I was lost, and the cost
Was to be outside society

Jimi Hendrix was a nigger
Jesus Christ and Grandma, too
Jackson Pollock was a nigger
Nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger,
Nigger, nigger, nigger

Outside of society, 
They're waitin' for me
Outside of society, 
If you're looking,
That's where you'll find me
Outside of society, 
They're waitin' for me
Outside of society 

Outside of society, 
They're waitin' for me
Outside of society, 
If you're looking,
That's where you'll find me
Outside of society, 
They're waitin' for me
Outside of society
