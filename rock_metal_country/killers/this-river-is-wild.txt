I went to the river, thinkin' 'bout jumpin' in
Thinkin' 'bout your ways baby
Trying to forget how to swim
As I stood there, watching the train go by
Oh what a message - that's when I realized
Oh baby, is it gonna last very long
Look at the river and how it keeps movin' on
Oh baby, what we have is almost gone
Look at the river and how it keeps movin' on
Movin' on
My emotions move with the current and the wind
No direction and no definite end
That's when I realized how the ripples
In the water seemed to shine
Reminds me of you and I baby, at one point in time
And just like a river - like a river flowin' - into a waterfall
After falling are we moving on - I can feel the flow
Under the train bridge - it keeps movin' on
Goes down to the whirlpool - it keeps movin' on
No still waters baby, gonna hold me down
All I wanna know is - are you comin' with me
