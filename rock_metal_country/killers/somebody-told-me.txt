Breaking my back just to know your name 
Seventeen tracks and I've had it with this game 
I'm breaking my back just to know your name 
But heaven ain't close in a place like this 
Anything goes but don't blink, you might miss 
'Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this 
I said heaven ain't close in a place like this 
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight 
Never thought I'd let a rumour ruin my moonlight 

Well, somebody told me you had a boyfriend 
Who looked like a girlfriend 
That I had in February of last year 
It's not confidential, I've got potential 

Ready lets roll onto something new 
Takin' it's toll and I'm leaving without you 
'Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this 
I said heaven ain't close in a place like this 
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight 
Never thought I'd let a rumour ruin my moonlight 

Well, somebody told me you had a boyfriend 
Who looked like a girlfriend 
That I had in February of last year 
It's not confidential, I've got potential a rushin' a rushin' around 

Pace yourself for me 
I said maybe, baby, please 
But I just don't know now 
When all I wanna do is try 

Well, somebody told me you had a boyfriend 
Who looked like a girlfriend 
That I had in February of last year 
It's not confidential, I've got potential a rushin' a rushin' around
