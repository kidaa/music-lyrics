I'm coming out of my cage
And Ive been doing just fine
Gotta gotta be down
Because I want it all

It started out with a kiss
How did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss
It was only a kiss

Now Im falling asleep
And shes calling a cab
While hes having a smoke
And shes taking a drag

Now theyre going to bed
And my stomach is sick
And its all in my head

But shes touching his chest now
He takes off her dress now
Let me go

And I just cant look its killing me
And taking control

Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibis

But its just the price I pay
Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes
Cause Im Mr Brightside

Im coming out of my cage
And Ive been doing just fine

It was only a kiss

And shes calling a cab
While hes having a smoke
And shes taking a drag

Now theyre going to bed
And my stomach is sick
And its all in my head

Cause I just cant look its killing me
And taking control

Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibis

But its just the price I pay
Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes
Cause Im Mr Brightside

I never
I never
I never
I never
