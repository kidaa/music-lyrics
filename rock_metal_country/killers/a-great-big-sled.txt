This snowman is shaping up to be an 8,
But not out of 10,
The robots awake to find that they've been taped down, 
Wondering when they'll break through these chains,
But little boys have action toys for brains,
I'm living proof it can last a long time,
Now the girls off the street are innocent and sweet, 
When they're all in bed,
They got their make-up and dreams of wonderland, 
Sprinkled inside their heads,
And soon they will change,
But tonight Hollywood has never seemed so strange, 
Now mother's pray it'll last a long time.

I want to roll around like a kid in the snow, 
I want to re-learn what I already know, 
Just let me take pride,
Just to rev through the night,
On a great big sled.

I want to wish you merry christmas,
Ho Ho Ho.

Now they boys are all grown up,
And their working their fingers to the bone, 
They go around chasing them girls on the weekend,
You know they still can't be alone,
I've been racking my brain, 
With thoughts of peace and love,
How on earth did we get so mixed up?
I pray to god it don't last a long time.

I want to roll around like a kid in the snow, 
I want to re-learn what I already know, 
Just let me take pride,
Just to rev through the night,
On a great big sled.

I hear the sound of bells,
There's something on the roof,
I wonder what this night will bring.

On a great big sled. 

I want to wish you merry christmas,
Can't do that
I want to wish you merry christmas,
Can't do that.
