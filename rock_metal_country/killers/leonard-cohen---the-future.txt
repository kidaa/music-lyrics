Give me back my broken night 
My mirrored room, 
My secret life 
Its lonely here, 
There's no one 
Left to torture 
Give me absolute control 
Over every living soul 
And lie beside me, baby, 
Thats an order! 

Give me crack and anal sex 
Take the only tree thats left 
And stuff it up the hole 
In your culture 
Give me back the Berlin wall 
Give me Stalin and St Paul 
Ive seen the future, brother: 
It is murder 

Things are going to slide, 
Slide in all directions 
Wont be nothing 
Nothing you can measure 
Anymore 
The blizzard, 
The blizzard of the world 
Has crossed the threshold 
And it has overturned 
The order of the soul 
When they said REPENT REPENT 
I wonder what they meant 
When they said REPENT REPENT 
I wonder what they meant 
When they said REPENT REPENT 
I wonder what they meant 

You dont know me from the wind 
You never will, you never did 
Im the little jew 
Who wrote the Bible 
Ive seen the nations 
Rise and fall 
Ive heard their stories, 
Heard them all
But loves the only engine 
Of survival 
Your servant here,
He has been told 
To say it clear, 
To say it cold: 
Its over, it aint going 
Any further 
And now the wheels 
Of heaven stop 
You feel the devils riding crop 
Get ready for the future: 
It is murder 

Things are going to slide ... 

There'll be the breaking 
Of the ancient 
Western code 
Your private life 
Will suddenly explode 
Therell be phantoms 
Therell be fires on the road 
And the white man dancing 
Youll see a woman 
Hanging upside down 
Her features 
Covered by her fallen gown 
And all the lousy little poets 
Coming round 
Tryin to sound like 
Charlie Manson
And the white man dancin 

Give me back the Berlin wall 
Give me Stalin and St Paul 
Give me Christ 
Or give me Hiroshima
Destroy another fetus now 
We dont like children anyhow 
Ive seen the future, baby: 
It is murder 

Things are going to slide ... 

When they said Repent Repent ...
