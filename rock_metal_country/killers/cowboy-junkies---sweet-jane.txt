Anyone who's ever had a heart
Wouldn't turn around and break it
And anyone who's ever played a part
Wouldn't turn around and hate it

Sweet Jane, sweet Jane
Sweet, sweet Jane
You're waiting 
For Jimmy down in the alley
Waiting there 
For him to come back home
Waiting down on the corner
And thinking of ways 
To get back home

Sweet Jane, sweet Jane
Sweet, sweet Jane
Anyone who's ever had a dream
Anyone who's ever played a part
Anyone who's ever been lonely
And anyone who's ever split apart

Sweet Jane, sweet Jane
Sweet, sweet Jane
Heavenly widened roses
Seem to whisper to me 
When you smile
Heavenly widened roses
Seem to whisper to me 
When you smile

La la la la, la la la, 

Sweet Jane
Sweet, sweet Jane
