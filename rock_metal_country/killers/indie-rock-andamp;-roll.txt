Glamorous
Indie rock'n'roll is what I want
It's in my soul, it's what I need
Indie rock'n'roll, it's time 
Two of us
Flipping through a thrift store magazine
She plays the drums, I'm on tambourine
Bet your, your bottom dollar on me 

It's Indie rock'n'roll for me
It's Indie rock'n'roll for me
It's all I need
It's Indie rock'n'roll for me 

In a clutch
I'm talking every word for all the boys
Electric girls with worn down toys
Make it up, break it up, what do you care
Oh what do you care? 

I take my twist with a shout
A coffee shop with a cause, then I'll freak you out
No sex, no drugs, no life, no love
When it comes to today 

Stay if you wanna love me, stay
Oh don't be shy, let's cause a scene
Like lovers do on silver screens
Let's make it yeah, we'll cause a scene 

It's Indie rock'n'roll for me
It's Indie rock'n'roll for me
It's all I need
It's Indie rock'n'roll for me 

In a clutch
I'm talking every word for all the boys
It's Indie rock'n'roll for me
It's all I need
Makin' up, breakin' up, what do you care
What do you care?
It's Indie rock'n'roll for me
