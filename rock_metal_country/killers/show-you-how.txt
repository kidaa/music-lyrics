Ha
I gotta tell ya
I'll make it better
But i know there's somethin' i needed to say
When i was out, though
Maybe you were better alone
I know i'll make it home

She told me sweet thang
Run a labour
In your shoes
Touch me til i follow in love
I wanna help her
Maybe we were better alone
I wanna show you how

And then we walked out
Make it ? now
I said i want it but i never alone
I wanna show you
Maybe we were somethin' uncool
I wanna make you sing

Uh uh oh
Uh uh oh
Uh uh oh
