This town is our town so mother fucking glam [echo out]

We all know the chosen toys of candy girls and pretty boys
Make up that face to win the race
Life's a pig in this town
Suck my dick in this town

This town is our town
It is so glamorous
I'll bet you'd live here if you could
And be one of us

This town is our town
So fucking glamorous
I'll bet you'd live here if you could
And be one of us

Change our mind like we said before
We are dreamers, we are whores
Discarded scars like worn out cars
Litter the streets of this town
Litter the streets in this town

This town is our town
So fucking glamorous
I'll bet you'd live here if you could
And be one of us

This town is our town
So motherfucking glamorous
I'll bet you'd live here if you could
And be one of us

Break it down boys

Human Waste in the house
Human Waste in the house
Human Waste in the house

Here we fucking go!

This town is our town
So fucking glamorous
I'll bet you'd live here if you could
And be one of us

This town is our town
So motherfucking glamorous
I'll bet you'd live here if you could
And be one of us

This town
This town
This town
This town!
