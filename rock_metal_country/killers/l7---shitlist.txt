When I get mad
And I get pissed
I grab my pen
And I write out a list
Of all the people
That won't be missed
You've made my shitlist 

For all the ones
Who bum me out
Shitlist
For all the ones
Who fill my head with doubt
Shitlist
For all the squares who get me pissed
Shitlist
You've made my shitlist 

Shitlist
Shitlist 

When I get mad
And I get pissed
Shitlist
I grab my pen
And write out a list
Shitlist
Of all you assholes
Who won't be missed
Shitlist
You've made my shitlist 

Shitlist
Shitlist

How I always saw 
that white light around us, 
around you, 
when we were together,
we were the only 
two people on earth, 
everyone else 
was just extras in our movie 
you get top billing baby...
