Now, I'm craving your body,
is this real
Temperatures rising, I don't want to feel
I'm in the wrong place to be real
Woahh and I'm; longing to love you
just for a night,
Kissing and hugging and holding you tight
Please let me love you
with all my might

Reasons, the reasons that we hear,
The reasons that we fear
our feelings a-won't disappear

Oooh! And- after the love game has been played
All our illusions were just a parade
And all the reasons start to fade

[Layering Chorus]
LA-LA-LA-ETC
After all our reasons why
All the reasons were a lie
After all the reasons lo-ove was ne'er decide

And, longing to love you for one night
Please let me love you with all of my might, baaaaby
OOOHHH, Baby!

Reasons, the reasons that we hear,
The reasons that we fear
our feelings a-won't disappear

Oooh! And after the love games have been played
All our illusions were just a parade
And all the reasons start to fade

And, in the morning when I rise,
no longer feeling hypnotized
For no reasons, our reasons, our reasons
have no pri-ii-de

[Layering Chorus]
LA-LA-LA-ETC
After all the reasons why
All of the reasons were a lie
After all the reasons lo-ove was ne'er decide

[Phillips last solo]
Heeehhhhh, Ooooh, yeaahhh, Oohhh Baby,
I can't find the reasons
That my love won't disappear
Can't find the reasons
Why I love you ,my baby, my dear
Can't find the reasons
Wanna love you all night
Can't find the reasons
Gotta squeeze ya, real tight
Can't find the reasons
Baby- yeah,
For my tears
Can't find the reasons
Why I love ya.... [fade to black]
