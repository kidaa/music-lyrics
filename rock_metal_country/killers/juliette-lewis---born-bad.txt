I'm a bad brother 

Juliette Lewis: 
born bad, [2x]
its such a sin, 
born bad, 
its such a sin, 
I guess I'm born naturally born bad. 

one way or the other, 
I'm a bad brother, 
word to the mother fucker 

don't wanna be born bad, 
most fun I've never had. 
You know its such a sin 
I'll never be the same again. 
I'm naturally born to be, 
bad as a girl can be. 
You know its such a sin 
I'll never be the same again. 

[Juliette Lewis:]
{born bad}
