Man, I got these broads icin' it up
While my little B.G.s on the bus puttin' out cigarette butts
But me, personally, playboy I done had bad luck
And I'mma always show love to my cut
Hit the club, light the lights up
The Cash Money motto is to drink till you throw up
Point the broad out, guaranteed I can pluck
'Cause woody, I'm tattooed and barred up
Medallion iced up, Rolex bezeled up
And my pinky ring is platinum plus
Earrings be trillion cut and my grill be slugged up
My heart filled with anger lost, stranded as a youngster
Stack my cheese up
'Cause one day I'mma give this street life up
Beef, I don't discuss
Woody outta line, woody gone get his head bust
Cash Money millionaires plus
Don't touch broad if you can't pluck the broad
20 inches with TVs is a must
By the year 2,000 Lil' Wayne gone tear this game up

Boss B, slow down in the Jag you lost me
You know how I flow the new Rose Royce B
The number one ripper, dippin' low-low
In a compressor sippin' Mo'-Mo'
Spend a lotta cheddar, look, my click couldn't be betta
I'm married to CMR, baby, love it or leave it
Drop drops when it's hot, stretch Hummers when it's not
Light up the whole block when you glance at my watch
It's Wayne baby, thugged out, won't change, baby
I do ya thang lady, in a blue Navigaty
That's game, baby, you can call me a game shotter
But since I drive a Bubble, people call me Lex Lurger
I pull up in a Expedition, they be like, "Ah, no-no-no, he didn't"
Tattoos and fast cars, do you know who we are
I'm Lil' Weezy puttin' down for CMR

Bling bling
Everytime I come around yo' city
Bling bling
Pinky ring worth about 50
Bling bling
Everytime I buy a new ride
Bling bling
Lorenzos on Yokahama tires
Bling bling

It's the player with the Lex Bubble
Candy coated helicopter with the leather cover
If ya slippin', not?? take off the rubber
Then toss that broad 'cause I don't love her
Balla, Manny bought a private plane
Then turned around and sold that thang to Juv' and Wayne
They put 30 inch Lorenzos on that thang, man
You little kids out there just don't understand

I'm a 1999 driver
I'm a uptown 3rd Ward magnolia TC rider
Ol' ignorant boy always stunnin'
Big ballin' Calhounie's, you can see him when he comin'
Booted up, diamond up
Golds be shinin' up, all them diamonds be blindin' up
People at the second line be sayin' I be damn
Up in they best fits sayin', "Juv' got me, damn"

Bling bling
Everytime I come around yo' city
Bling bling
Pinky ring worth about 50
Bling bling
Everytime I buy a new ride
Bling bling
Lorenzos on Yokahama tires

I be that player with the ice on me
If it cost less than 20 it don't look right on me
I stay flossed out all through the week
My money long if you don't know I'm the B.G.
I be dealin' with your girl all in your home
Haters be like, "Look at that Benz and all that chrome"
Diamonds worn by everybody, that's in my click
Man, I got the price of a mansion 'round my neck and wrist
My nigga baby gettin' a special built machine
A Mercedes Benz 700 B14
I know you haters can't believe that
I can't wait to see you busters face when you see that
Man, look at that
Girls wear shades just to stand on side of me
They say, "Take that chain off, boy, you blindin' me"
All day my phone ringin', bling bling bling
Can see my earring from a mile, bling bling

Bling bling
Everytime I come around yo' city
Bling bling
Pinky ring worth about 50
Bling bling
Everytime I buy a new ride
Bling bling
Lorenzos on Yokahama tires
