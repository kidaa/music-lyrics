Seven days underpaid
Gotta give it up
Got no time for this life that
I'm livin' up
Shackled down, kicked around, 
Now slave to the grind
Need some time for myself
I'll give you anything that you want me to
If you don't have the time so
I'll get up with you
If you don't understand man
You've got to believe
There is too much of you but
There is not enough of me
There is not enough of me
Same old song world moves
On while I'm still in bed
Meet tomorrow today just to
Get ahead
Jump the gun on the run,
I'm the only one
Who thinks that
I'm fallin' behind
I'll give you anything that
You want me to
But I don't have the time
So I'll get up with you
If you don't understand
Man you've got to believe
There is too much of you
But there is not enough of me
There is not enough of me
I'll give you anything that you want me to
But I don't have the time so I'll
Get up with you
If you don't understand man
You've got to believe
There is too much of you there
Is too much of me
I'll give you anything that you want me to
But I don't have the time so I'll
Get up with you
If you don't understand man
You've got to believe
There is too much of you but there
Is not enough of me
