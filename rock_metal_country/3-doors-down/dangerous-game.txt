You stand before me
Now we stare eye to eye
Before another second ticks away, one of us will die
You reach for your medal as I reach for mine
The sound of bullets flying through the air is followed by a cry

And the cry...

What will we do, what will we say when it's the end of this game that we play
When we crumble into the dust, my friend
Although we start this game over again
It's coming back to me

This young man lies alone dead fast into the ground
The sound of fleeing feet and the crying eye will be his last sound, yeah

But do we gain from all this
Now, was it worth a life no
We throw all of our hopes away
And set our dreams aside

Now we're crying

What will we do, what will we say when it's the end of this game that we play
When we crumble into the dust, my friend
Although we start this game over again
It's coming back to me [x 5]

What will we do, what will we say when it's the end of this game that we play
When we crumble into the dust, my friend
Although we start this game over again
