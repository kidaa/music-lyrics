Looking back of the beginning of this
And how life was
Just you and me loving all of our friends
Living life like an ocean
But now the current slowly pulling me down
Its getting harder too breath
It wont be to long and I will be going under
Can you save me from this?

Cause its not my time Im not going
Theres a fear in me its not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Oh but I wont go

I look ahead too all the plans that we made
And the dreams that we had
Im in a world that try to take them away
Oh but Im taking them back
Cause all of this time I we been just too blind to understand
What should matter to me
My friends is laughing and its not what we have
Its what we be live in

Cause its not my time Im not going
Theres a fear in me but its not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
But its not my time Im not going
Theres a will in me and now I know that
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Oh but I wont go
I wont go

There might be more than you believe
There might be more than you believe
There might be more than you can see

But its not my time Im not going
Theres a fear in me its not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
But its not my time Im not going
Theres a will in me and now its gonna show
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Oh

There might be more than you believe
There might be more than you believe
There might be more than you can see

But I wont go
No I wont go down
Yeah
