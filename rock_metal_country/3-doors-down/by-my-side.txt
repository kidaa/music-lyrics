They blazed a trail I dared to run
They built this world and I have come
I need another, like a brother
For a cryin' shoulder
This could be the last time, you will
Stand by my side
I can feel my soul it's bleeding, will you fly
With me this evening
Sober mind time now is gone, they carved my
Body not of stone
A pretty maze emptiness, I've said the hell
With all the rest
This could be the last time, you will
Stand by my side
I can feel my soul it's bleeding, will you fly
With me tonight
This could be the last time, you will
Stand by my side
I can feel my soul it's bleeding, will you fly
With me this evening.
