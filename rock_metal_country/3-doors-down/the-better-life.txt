I'm about to be on the floor again, 
Surely you're gonna find me here
I'm about to sleep until the end of time, 
Drug I take gonna wake
My fear right now
I'm passing away on to the
Better life
I'm passing away on
To the better
I'm about to see just how far I can fly, 
Surely your gonna break my fall
I'm about to run as fast as I can, 
Head long into that wall
This time I'm passing away on to the
Better life
I'm passing away on
To the better
On to the better life
On to the better
I'm about to be on the floor again, 
Surely you're gonna find me here
I'm about to sleep until the
End of time, drug I take
gonna wake my
fear right now
I'm passing away on to the
Better life
I'm passing away on
To the better
I'm passing away on to the
Better life
I'm passing away on
To the better
