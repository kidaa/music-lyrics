Rubber headed motor junky, 
Run me down and try to stomp me
Throw my life away, and I'll be worthless
Just like you
Somewhere now a baby's crying, 
Down the road his mother's dying
Shot a line and blew her mind 
And now she's turning blue
Don't you throw your life away, 
Just wait until another day
Don't you throw your life away, 
Cause baby I can feel it
Don't you ever compromise it, 
Don't you even realize it
Don't throw your life away, 
Cause baby I can feel it, now
Trip and fall,
I'm sure you all can tell me
What is on the wall behind the liquor store 
Where you get smacked up all the time
Perfect little life you wasted, 
Overdosed and that death you tasted
Scared you back into yourself, and now
You walk the line
Don't you throw your life away, 
Just wait until another day
Don't you throw your life away, 
Cause baby I can feel it
Don't you ever compromise it, 
Don't you even realize it
Don't throw your life away, 
Cause baby I can feel it, now
Life away
Life away
Life away
