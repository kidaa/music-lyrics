Put me on a train mama
This place just aint the same no more
Put me on a train mama
I'm leavin' today

I don't wanna watch the world spinnin'
I wanna be spinnin' with it
Put me on a train mama
I'm leavin today

Cause i got the fever that's for sure
And knowin' i can get it makes me want it more
Mama i just want you to know that i'm gonna be fine

Lord i know it's the chance that i take
But i know you've forgiven the mistakes that i've made
There's a life out there and it's gonna be mine

Put me on a train mama
Cause i can't take this pain no more
Put me on a train mama
I'm leavin today

And there's a world that's out there waiting
And i know that it's the chance i'm takin
Put me on a train mama
I'm leavin today

Cause i got the fever that's for sure
And knowin' i can get it makes me want it more
Mama i just want you to know that i'm gonna be fine

Lord i know it's the chance that i take
But i know you've forgiven the mistakes that i've made
There's a life out there and it's gonna be mine

God knows how long i'll be gone
But maybe one day a train will bring me home

Put me on a train mama
Put me on a train mama
Oh put me on a train mama
I'm leavin today

Cause i got the fever that's for sure
And knowin' i can get it makes me want it more
Mama i just want you to know that i'm gonna be fine

Lord i know it's the chance that i take
But i know you've forgiven the mistakes that i've made
There's a life out there and it's gonna be mine
