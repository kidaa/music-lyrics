A hundred days had made me older
since the last time that I saw your pretty face
A thousand lights had made me colder
and I don't think I can look at this the same

But all the miles had separate
They disappeared now when I'm dreaming of your face

I'm here without you baby
but your still on my lonely mind
I think about you baby
and I dream about you all the time

I'm here without you baby
but your still with me in my dreams
And tonight it's only you and me

The miles just keep rolling
as the people either way to say hello
I hear this life is overrated
but I hope it gets better as we go

I'm here without you baby
but your still on my lonely mind
I think about you baby
and I dream about you all the time

I'm here without you baby
but your still with me in my dreams
And tonight girl it's only you and me

Everything I know, and anywhere I go 
it gets hard but it won't take away my love
And when the last one falls, when it's all said and done
it get hard but it won't take away my love

I'm here without you baby
but your still on my lonely mind
I think about you baby
and I dream about you all the time

I'm here without you baby
but your still with me in my dreams
And tonight girl it's only you and me
