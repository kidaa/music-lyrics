I took a walk around the world 
To ease my troubled mind
I left my body laying somewhere
In the sands of time
I watched the world float 
To the dark side of the moon
I feel there is nothing I can do, yeah
I watched the world float 
To the dark side of the moon
After all I knew it had to be 
Something to do with you
I really don't mind what happens now and then
As long as you'll be my friend at the end
If I go crazy then will you still
Call me Superman
If I'm alive and well, will you be
There holding my hand
I'll keep you by my side 
With my superhuman might
Kryptonite
You called me strong, you called me weak,
But still your secrets I will keep
You took for granted all the times 
I never let you down
You stumbled in and bumped your head, 
If not for me then you would be dead
I picked you up and put you back
On solid ground
If I go crazy then will you still
Call me Superman
If I'm alive and well, 
Will you be there holding my hand
I'll keep you by my side 
With my superhuman might
Kryptonite
Yeah!!
If I go crazy then will you still
Call me Superman
If I'm alive and well, will you be there
Holding my hand
I'll keep you by my side 
With my superhuman might
Kryptonite
