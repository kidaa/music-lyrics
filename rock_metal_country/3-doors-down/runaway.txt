Do you ever think about running away
'cause i was thinkin' about leavin' today
We'll follow forever where our hearts wanna go
Maybe we'll live somewhere where nobody knows our names
Then things might change for the good

I wanna be somewhere so far away
To lie under the night at the end of another good day
I can't tell you how long we'll be gone
But as long as we're together then forever's never too long
Too long, oh no

Do you ever think about not comin' back
Hoppin' on a train and we'll burn up the tracks
We'll jump off somewhere that we don't know how to say
Maybe hitch a ride from someone who can tell us the way
To where these things might change for the good

I wanna be somewhere so far away
To lie under the night at the end of another good day
I can't tell you how long we'll be gone
But as long as we're together then forever's never too 
Where forever is never too long
Not with you right here by me
Maybe, maybe we'll just see
Where this road will lead for us

I wanna be somewhere so far away
To lie under the night at the end of another good day
I can't tell you how long we'll be gone
But as long as we're together then forever's never too 
I wanna be somewhere so far away
To lie under the night at the end of another good day
I can't tell you how long we'll be gone
But as long as we're together then forever's never too 
Forever is never too long
