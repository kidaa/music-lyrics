It feels like something got in the way
And maybe i had something to do with it
There's not much that i can say
But there sure is something i've got to prove to you
I told you, that i'd try
And you said that i lie
Like i have something to sell

Come on wait a minute
You think i've been in this
For a little while 
But now come on baby, please
I've been on my knees for a long time
So come on, give it to me
Just give it to me

There's always something i wanna say
But the words won't never come out
The way i want
Maybe i see another way
Or maybe i just see somethin you don't
These stories that you tell
Now i know them a little too well
You think i'll take what i want
Oh no

Come on wait a minute
You think i've been in this
For a little while 
But now come on baby, please
I've been on my knees for a long time
Come on, give it to me
One more wrong will make it right
I don't wanna fight no more
I'm tired of sayin' please
This is all i need
So give me just a little bit
A little bit more
Oh, give me just a little bit more

Come on wait a minute
You think i've been in this
For a little while
But now come on baby, please
I've been on my knees for a long time

Come on wait a minute
You think i've been in this
For a little while 
But now come on baby, please
I've been on my knees for a long time
Come on, give it to me
One more wrong will make it right
I don't wanna fight no more
I'm tired of sayin' please
This is all i need
So give me just a little bit
A little bit more
Oh, give me just a little bit more
Give me just a little bit more
Little bit more
