I'm not suposed to be scared of anything, but I don't know where I am 
I wish that I could move but I'm exhausted and nobody understands how I feel 
I'm trying hard to breathe now but there's no air in my lungs 
There's no one here to talk to and the pain inside is making me numb 

I try to hold this Under control 
They can't help me 'Cause no one knows 

Now I'm going through changes, changes 
God, I feel so feel so frustrated lately 
When I get suffacated, save me 
Now I'm going through changes, changes 

I'm feeling weak and weary walking through this world alone 
Everything you say, every word of it, cuts me to the bone 
I've got something to say, but now I've got no where to turn 
It feel like I've been buried underneath the weight of the world 

I try to hold this Under control 
They can't help me 'Cause no one knows 

Now I'm going through changes, changes 
God, I feel so feel so frustrated lately 
When I get suffacated, save me 
Now I'm going through changes, changes 

I'm running, shaking 
Bound and breaking 
I hope I make it through all these changes 

Now I'm going through changes, changes 
God, I feel so frustrated lately 
When I get suffacated, save me 
Now I'm falling apart, now I feel it 

Now I'm going through changes, chnages 
God, I feel so feel so frustrated lately 
When I get suffacated, I hate this 
But I'm going through changes, changes
