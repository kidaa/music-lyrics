I've dreamed about this,
Sixteen days away
Now you're here, 
And my head lays besides your body, 
Pillowed under mine
You were poison, 
Spinning round my mind
Welcome to my world 
She said, do you feel
Alive she said
It's all a bad dream, 
Spinning in your lonely head,
Welcome to my world, 
She said, separated world,
She said, separated,
Down poison,
Down poison,
Body withered, 
Body died, 
Time to take away this life
Bad enough to die from one, 
Not to mention
Four or five
Welcome to my world
She said, do you feel alive she said
It's all a bad dream,
Spinning in your lonely head
Welcome to my world she said,
Separated world, 
She stayed separated
Down poison, down poison
Down poison, down
You weren't there for me, I was there for you
You weren't there for me, I was there for you
You weren't there for me, I was there for you
You weren't there for me, I was there for you
You wouldn't die for me, I've died for you
You wouldn't die for me, I've died for you
You wouldn't die for me, I've already died for you
You wouldn't die, you wouldn't die, you wouldn't die!
Welcome to my world she said, do
you feel alive she said
It's all a bad dream,
Spinning in your lonely head
Welcome to my world she said,
Separated world, she stayed separated
Down poison, down poison
Down poison, down.
