I know that it was the night the war broke out
Because you and I were driving around
And you were doing a story
About if people understood what had happened to their world
Tonight in bed sleeping
The world tonight in bed asleep
You said that you were in touch with the draft resistors
In case the big boys called you up
You're gonna have to let 'em dick you around
But don't let 'em make you do what you can't live with
Tonight in bed with me sleeping
You looked like you were just a little kid
";Shane,"; I said, ";You've gotta watch your ass.";
You gotta have fear in your heart
You gotta have fear in your heart
You gotta have fear in your heart
You gotta have fear in your heart...
