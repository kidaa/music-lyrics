I'm sleeing in girls' room
I'm sleeping in the sky
I'm sleeping in the water
I'm sleeing in girls' room
I'm sleeing in girls' room
I'm sleeing in girls' room tonight
Here comes Tiffany
My best friend, Tiffany
Wearing a size too small of sweater
Me and Tiffany
Dressing up pretty
We love to ride
We love to canter
My best friend Tiffany
She is so popular
We're going from site to site and pool to pool tonight
And we hear Terry say that Tricia's ok
But she ought to learn to shave her bikini line better
And Tauren was born, like her mother, in a storm
And Tracey's been away forever
I'm sleeing in girls' room
I'm sleeing in girls' room
I'm sleeping in the sky
I'm sleeping in the water
I'm sleeing in girls' room
I'm sleeing in girls' room
I'm sleeing in girls' room tonight
