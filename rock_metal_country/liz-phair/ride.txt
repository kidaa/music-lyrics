As I stumble into bed, I curse the devil in my head
And if I die before I wake, I hope the lord won't hesitate
To pluck my coffin from the ground
He need not heed the neighbors now
And throw me up for all to see,
The flies of August swarming me
I get a ride
Right by your side
Under your skin
I'm digging in
Well I don't know, but I've been told
The road to heaven is paved with gold
And if I die before I wake
I need a ride
I need a ride
I need a ride from you
I need a ride
I need a ride
I need a ride from you
Well sticks and stones can break my bones
And boys can make me kick and moan
But when I want it autodrive
I get a ride
I get a ride
I get a ride from you
I get a ride
I get a ride
I get a ride from you
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep
And if I die before I wake
I hope the lord won't hesitate
To pluck my coffin from the ground
He need not heed the neighbors now
And throw me up for all to see
The flies of August swarming me
I get a ride
