He's a friend of mine
Kind of special guy
He's a run-around
Hey, you've got to hide your love away!
I hear people are talking about us
And I just have to say
I lie awake every night
Thinking about you, I fantasize
All around us people are changing
You've got to hide your love away
I hear people are talking about us
He's a special guy
Kind of sentimental inside
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
I hear people are talking about us
That's ok with me
Get it easily inside
