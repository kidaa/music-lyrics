I've got my own thing
Feel it, it is strong
The shortest people think
But really it is long

I don't have to wait for a miracle
They say I'm pretty as a song
I don't have to stay for a rainy day
I know that something comes along, it always comes along

Ooh boy, I'd love to help give enough rope to hang yourself
And watch the silly things you do
Ooh boy, I'd love to help give enough rope to hang yourself
And I hope you swing it this way too
Boy, I do

I've got my own thing
Feel it in a room
Everybody changed
When I do what I do, Cause I do what I do

I don't have to say what i'm thinking cause
Everyone's radio is on and they've heard my latest song
Don't have to stand there with a drink because
They say that we would get along, so let's get along

Ooh boy, I'd love to help give enough rope to hang yourself
And watch the silly things you do
Ooh boy, I'd love to help give enough rope to hang yourself
And I hope you swing it this way too
Boy, I do

I know you're not like other guys
I don't expect you to normalize
I won't get into what you do
Because I'm bettin, bettin, bettin, bettin, bettin all my money on you

I don't have to wait for a miracle
They say I'm pretty as a song, they've heard my latest song
You don't have to stand there with a drink because
I know that we would get along, so let's just get along

Ooh boy, I'd love to help give enough rope to hang yourself
And watch the silly things you do
Ooh boy, I'd love to help give enough rope to hang yourself
And I hope you swing it this way too
Ooh boy, I'd love to help give enough rope to hang yourself
And watch the silly things you do
Ooh boy, I'd love to help give enough rope to hang yourself
And I hope you swing it this way too
Boy, I do

Pretty girl, there she goes [x6]
