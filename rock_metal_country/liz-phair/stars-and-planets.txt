Oh my look at you
The wide-eyed ingenue
See me coming
Whisper something
Who are you
Looking through the glass at me
Like your gonna make it happen
Let me tell you something true
You know its just the same old story

Stars rise and
Stars fall
But the ones that shine the brighest aren't stars at all
There are the planets just like us
And from big to small
We all shine shine shine
We all shine

Raise the red flag
See your hot young available
Spend their money
Chase their honey
Who are you
boogaloo
We've seen ten of you
Just this morning
At least as pretty too
You know it just the same old story

Stars rise and
Stars fall
But the ones that shine the brighest aren't stars at all
There are the planets just like us
And from big to small
We all shine shine shine
We all shine shine shine
We all shine

Everybody wants to go far
Don't be such a hog in the spotlight
Try to see how precious you are
And if you catch that wave it can be death defying

...And if you catch that wave
It can be death defying
Blinded by the flash.

Well you better start running
The bulls are coming
You know its just the same old story

Stars rise and
Stars fall
But the ones that the shine the brighest aren't stars at all
There the planets just like us
And from big to small
We all shine shine shine

Stars rise and
