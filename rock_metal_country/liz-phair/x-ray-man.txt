What I sense...
As far as I know, baby, you can see
As far as I go, funky baby, digging deep inside of me
Uh uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh...
As far as I know, sister, I'm alright
As far as I know, funky lady, I'm coming home tonight
You can see through the smoke...
You're an x-ray man
You got x-ray eyes
This is no reflection on you, it's just what I see inside of me
Why don't you put on your two-way sombrero and leave?
Uh uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh...
You're an x-ray man
And you got white-wall tires
Iodine tan
Cheap, unpleasant desires
You're an x-ray man
You've got an X-rated mind
You're not satisfied looking at me
You're always checking out the girl behind
You're an x-ray man
You've got secret plans for me
