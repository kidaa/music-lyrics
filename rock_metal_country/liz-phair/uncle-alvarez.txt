There's a portrait of Uncle Alvarez
Hangin' in the hall
Nobody wants to look at it
But Uncle Alvarez sees us all
Oh, oh, oh imaginary accomplishments
Hey, hey, hey you visionary guy
You might even shake the hands of presidents
Better send a postcard and keep the family quiet
He's not really part-Cherokee indian
He didn't fight in the Civil War
He's just Eugene Isaac Alvarez
He feels sorry for the wall
Oh, oh, oh imaginary accomplishments
Hey, hey, hey you visionary guy
You might even shake the hands of presidents
You're gonna make 'em sorry when you die
And it's a long way down
You were hoping for a heart-attack
Running around, investing on this and that
Your beautiful wife keeps your life on a shelf for you
Safe in a better way
There's no dust or mildew and
It's hard to believe you were once a beautiful dancer
Better just to shake it off
As you write your resume
Don't think of Uncle Alvarez
And the price he had to pay
Oh, oh, oh imaginary accomplishments
Hey, hey, hey you visionary guy
You might even shake the hands of presidents
You're gonna make them sorry when you die
Oh, oh, oh imaginary accomplishments
Hey, hey, hey you visionary guy
You might even shake the hands of presidents
Better send some money to the Alma Mater.
