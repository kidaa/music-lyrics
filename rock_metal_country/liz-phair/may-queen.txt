Don't be fooled by him, he's fine
Rock-and-roll Ken doll, he's a national end-all
He's an off and on friend of mine
Where have I been?
Got any what?
Who have I seen?
I spy a May queen
You were miles above me
Girls in your arms
The changing of her majesty's guard is truly amazing
Got any what?
Disease, hashish, a mind?
Do I have any what?
Where have I been?
Got any what?
Who have I seen?
I spy a May queen
You were miles above me
Girls in your arms
You could've planted a farm
All of them hayseeds...
