Oh baby you're young but that's okay
What's give or take nine years anyway
I'll bet you that cigarette
You won't regret my time

I want to be with a guy like you
So uncomplicated, so in tune
Just take off my dress
Let's mess with everybody's mind

I gotta tell you

Baby, baby, baby, if it's all right
Want you to rock me all night
Baby, baby, if it's all right
Want you to rock me all night
All night
Yeah rock me all night

Hey yeah yeah
Hey yeah yeah

I want to play Xbox on your floor
Say hi to your roommate who's next door
You don't have a dime, but I don't mind
Who gives a damn

Your record collection don't exist
You don't even know who Liz Phair is
Your potential with no credentials
Your mother taught you how to be a sensitive man
I gotta tell you

Baby, baby, baby, if it's all right
Want you to rock me all night
Baby, baby, if it's all right
Want you to rock me all night
All night
Yeah rock me all night

Hey yeah yeah
I've been waitin'
All my life for
Hey yeah yeah
For this feelin'
Who'd 've guessed it could rock me all night
Rock me all night

You think I'm a genius
Think I'm cool
I'm starting to think that young guys rule
Oh God, let me save you
'll I might change you, and I might change my mind

Baby, baby, baby, if it's all right
Want you to rock me all night
Baby, baby, if it's all right
Want you to rock me all night
All night
Yeah rock me all night
