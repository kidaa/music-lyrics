If you ask me why I lie to you
I can tell you I don't know myself
Its amazingly dishonest
But I'd have to recognize it
As part of myself

Straighten up
Why can't you straighten up
I've heard you tell me this
So many times
It doesn't even stick

I get it all the time
I get it all the time
You know I love to make
A joke of it

And if you ask me why I hurt you
I don't understand it
I can't help myself
Its a special combination
Of preditory instinct
And simple ill will

I would give some thought to it
If I thought that it might do me
Some good
Some good

Straighten up
Why can't you straighten up
You always say I'll lose
Control of it
And thirty is not too old

Well momma I would give some thought to it
If I thought that it might do me
Some good
Some good
Some good
Some good
