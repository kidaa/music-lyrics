Down on the lower east side
In the dirtiest apartment you could find
You took me up to your place
But the elevator threw me into space

And I really didn't even ask
What time it was
I could tell 'er we'd draw the curtain back

It's sweet
How you believe
You're in love with me
You're in love with me

You come 'round, open the gate
To a million empty bottles on the sink
You can over think any thing you want
But it really doesn't matter

'Cause it's sweet
To believe
You're in love with me
You're in love with me

In the early night
I catch you starin'
And you make a joke about it

It's sweet
How you believe
You're in love with me
You're in love with me

It's sweet
How you believe
You're in love with me
You're in love with me
