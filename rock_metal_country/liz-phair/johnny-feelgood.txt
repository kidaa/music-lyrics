Johnny feel good, Johnny right on
Johnny miss you, Johnny light on
Johnny makes me feel strangely good about myself
Moderation is a memory
Dive right in and let him send me
I could take this in doses large enough to kill
And I never met a man who was so pretty inside
He's got diamonds on the bed of his thumbnails and I
Never realized I was so dirty and dry
Till he knocked me down, started dragging me around
In the back of his convertible car
And I liked it
I liked it more and more
Crimson and clover, soon he's taken over all my senses now
And I never met a man who was so pretty inside
He's got petals on the bed of his sweat sock drawer
And who the fuck am I to criticize him 'cause I really need him now
In fact I'm kinda freaking out
And I'm wondering where the hell you are
Johnny feel good, Johnny right on
Johnny miss you, Johnny light on
Johnny makes me feel strangely good about myself
And I've never met a man I was so crazy about
It kinda has become an obsession to me
I hate him all the time
But I still get up
When he knocks me down
And he orders me around
'Cause it loosens me up
And I can't get enough
And I'd pay to spend the night with him some more
And I liked it
Let me tell you I liked it more and more
I liked it
I liked it, yeah
I really liked it
I liked it
I really, really, really liked it
I really liked it
I can't believe it.
