I saw John, he looked so sad
I want you to know that I feel bad for not making our dreams come true.
We had so many dreams, me and you.
I want you to know I love you.
You're my favorite thing from the past,
And all of those nights we spent together,
I never had such a blast....

Anyone could tell you were my instrument, he said, I understand you.
You wanna play me.
Everything about us had an innocence, but everything around us was changing

It's hard to believe so much happened so fast
Remember the way we always left
While I'm thinking of the things you do
We were kings of the world, me and you
I wish it has stayed like that forever
But everyone was dropping off like flowers
I had so many friends in rehab,
A couple who practically died

Anyone could tell you were my instrument, you said, I understand you.
You wanna play me.
Everything about us had an innocence, but everything around us was changing

And my mistake was being already married.
I wanna make a leap of innocence to you.

I guess when you were living the high life
It's one of those things that just can't last
Kind of like love in California
But I never had such a blast

Anyone could tell you were my instrument, you said, I understand you.
You wanna play me.
Everything about us had an innocence, but everything around us was changing

My mistake is thinking I'd already made it.
I wanna make a leap of innocence
My mistake is thinking you and I can change it.
I wanna make a leap of innocence to you
