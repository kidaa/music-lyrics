I love my bionic eyes
I love my crystal vision
If there's anybody out there
Baby I'm not gonna miss 'em

I watch the years go by
These are the same old guys I never had any use for
Beyond the feeling of pleasure
Or the thrill of the fight

I scored again last night
I said thanks for the drinks, nice party
Then I turned out the light

I've got timing and attitude
That can get to the baddest dude
That's when I hypnotize them
With my bionic eyes

As I got older I had to step out of the lines
And make up my own mind
As I got light as a feather they got stiff as a board
I can't feel any more, but I can fake it forever

It's easy in the beginning
When I can dazzle them
All night
Make 'em do what you wan' 'em to
Get 'em running after you
It's just the same old guys
Wearing the same old ties

As I got older I had to step out of the lines
And make up my own mind
As I got light as a feather they got stiff as a board
I can't feel any more, but I can fake it forever

I love my bionic eyes
I love my bionic eyes
I love my bionic eyes

If there's a parallel nation
And I'm a secret weapon
Show me a man you cannot break
And I will show you heaven

As I got older I had to step out of the lines
And make up my own mind
As I got light as a feather they got stiff as a board
I can't feel any more, but I can fake it forever
