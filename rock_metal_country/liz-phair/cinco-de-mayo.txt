Cinco de mayo, blowout, denial
It wasn't fun this time, letting you go
What if I never, a bullet forever,
Held out my hand to you?
We wouldn't have known beautiful flow
Absolute measure, I ain't no pleasure hound
Bus out of control, ploughing the road
Out on a bender
Just Alice falling down a deepening hole
I'd never been to Rome until you smiled
You're about as old and piled
Used to pray for snow
Now I just wonder
What spell I was under
Thinking you thought of me as something to hold
I'd never been to Rome until you smiled
You're about as old and piled
Cinco de mayo, burn-out Ohio
It wasn't me this time letting you go
