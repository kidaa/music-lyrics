I have looked all over the place
But you have got my favorite face
Your eyelashes sparkle like gilded grass
And your lips are sweet and slippery like a cherub's bare wet ass
'Cause you're a human supernova
A solar superman
You're an angel with wings afire
A flying, giant friction blast
You walk in clouds of glitter and the sun reflects your eyes
And everytime the wind blows, I can smell you in the sky
Your kisses are as wicked as an F-16
And you fuck like a volcano, and you're everything to me
'Cause you're a human supernova
A solar superman
You're an angel with wings afire
A flying, giant friction blast
You're a giant, flying friction blast
'Cause you're a human supernova
A solar superman
You're an angel with wings afire
A flying, giant friction blast
