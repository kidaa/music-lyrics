You thought I was something from afar
You thought I'd totally excite you
I guess it's just another thing to stand up close and ignite you
Love is nothing, nothing, nothing like they say
You gotta pick up the little pieces everyday
You were telling me the friends we have in common
By the time I figured it out you were yawning
Love is nothing, nothing, nothing like they say
You gotta get up and work the people everyday
And I thought,
";Who am I?";
";Who's this guy?";
";Would I lie to make the day blur into the night?";
Love is nothing, nothing, nothing like they say
You gotta pick up the little pieces everyday
Love is nothing, nothing, nothing like they say
You gota get up and work the people everyday
