What a pretty life you have 
Oh boy, it's a pretty life you have 
And I would need a map 
Just so I could navigate the back yard 
Home is very ordinary 
I know I was born to lead a double life 
A murderous strife and misery 
And when I find it, I know I'll make sense of me 
I want to be cool, tall, vulnerable and luscious 
I would have it all if I'd only had this much 
No need for Lucifer to fall if he'd learn to keep his mouth shut 
I would be be involved 
Be involved 
Be involved 
Be involved 
I would be involved with you 
I know the girls 
That live inside your world 
Just sitting next to a mortal makes their skin crawl 
I want to be cool, tall, vulnerable and luscious 
I would have it all if I'd only had this much 
No need for Lucifer to fall if he'd learn to keep his mouth shut 
I would be involved with you 
I want to be cool, tall, vulnerable and luscious 
I would have it all if I'd only had this much 
No need for Lucifer to fall if he'd learn to keep his mouth shut 
Be involved 
Be involved 
Be involved 
Be involved 
I would be involved with you 
Oh, with you
