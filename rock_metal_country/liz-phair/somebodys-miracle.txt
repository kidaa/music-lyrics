I'm so far, so far away from it now
That it seems like I may never know how
People stay in love for half of their lives
It's a secret they keep between husbands and wives

Baby, There goes somebody's miracle
Walking down the street
There goes some other fairy tale
I wish it could happen to me
But I look at myself
Wonderin' if i'm just too weak
To have such faith in myself

Once upon a time I was so restless in love
When things we're fine, I changed my mind just because
Now I see how wrong and reckless i've been
Each frog has a prince just waiting inside of him

Baby, There goes somebody's miracle
Walking down the street
There goes some other fairy tale
I wish it could happen to me
But I look at myself, and I think what the hell
Maybe I'm just too naive
To have such faith in myself
You know I'm prayin' for it

But the queen, she likes to sit on her throne
Doesn't mean you two are never alone
It's just love has needs that love only knows
Watch a couple stay close, It's like the bloom of a rose

Baby, There goes somebody's miracle
Walking down the street
There goes some other fairy tale
I wish it could happen to me
There goes somebody's miracle
Walking down the street
There goes some other fairy tale...

I never cry out loud, I
I keep my tears to myself
But I woke up one day and I found my life had left me for someone else
I, I guess it must be unhappy with me

Baby, There goes somebody's miracle
Walking down the street
There goes some other fairy tale
I wish it could happen to me
But I look at myself
Wondering if i'm just too weak
To have such faith in myself
You know I'm prayin for it
You know I'm prayin for it
You know I'm prayin for it
