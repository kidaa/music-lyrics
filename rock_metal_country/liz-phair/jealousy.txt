He's got a million dollar car
He's got a thirty-seven year old guitar
He's got a family who deals heroin
You're on the edge of your chair
And you feel it
He's looking at you, he's laughing at you
It's happening
I can't, I can't believe it
But it's here on the pages I'm reading
It's all I can do to conceal my feelings of jealousy
Jealousy
I know it's just a drawer of photographs
They're ex-girlfriends, I try to remember that
I don't wanna look, but I'm already hooked on jealousy
Jealousy
I can't believe you had a life before me
I can't believe they let you run around free
Just putting your body wherever it seemed like a good idea
What a good idea
Standing on the corner watching the ladies pass by
Imagining me behind your eyes
And what did I see?
I saw hips, I saw thighs
I saw secret positions that we never try
I saw jealousy
I saw jealousy
I can't, I can't believe it
But it's here in this place and I see it
It's all I can do to conceal my feelings of jealousy
Jealousy
Standing on the mudflats watching the salmon fly
Wonder if I'll ever bury the hatchet inside
Imagining me behind your eyes
And what did I see?
I saw hips, I saw thighs
I saw secret positions that we never try
I saw jealousy
I saw jealousy
I can't believe you had a life before me
I can't believe they let you run around free
Just putting your body wherever it seemed like a good idea
What a good idea
