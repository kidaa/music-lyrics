You go on ahead, honey
You have a good time there
You make me feel funny
I'm no ordinary lover or friend
I believe we have things to do
I believe in myself and I believe in you
I believe when I sleep you are near to me
When you sleep I am near to you
You walk out of the room with your hands so deep in your pockets,
I don't recognize you
You say you're a ghost in our house and I realize
I do think I see through you
So, you go on ahead, honey
You have a good time there
You make me feel funny
I'm no ordinary lover or friend
It's death in our love that has brought us here
It's a birth that has changed our lives
It's a place that I hope we'll be leaving soon
And I fear for the year in his eyes
And it goes around in circles
One night is lovely, the next is brutal
And you and me are in way over our heads with this one
It's hard to admit it
But you hold me and I can't feel you
We hurt but we smile
I promise I'll make it back when the summer has warmed me awhile
You go on ahead, honey
You have a good time there
You make me feel funny
I'm no ordinary lover or friend
I believe we have things to do
I believe in myself and I believe in you
I believe when I sleep you are near to me
When you sleep I am near to you
