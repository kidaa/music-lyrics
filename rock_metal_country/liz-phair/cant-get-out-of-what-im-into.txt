The things they say are getting harder to take
But I can't get out of what I'm into
And the jokes they tell are meant to wish me well
But I can't get out of what I'm into

'Cause it's a steady job
And it's the only thing that makes me money
And it gives me something to laugh about
'Cause my real life ain't fucking funny

The looks they give are starting to make me sick
But I can't get out of what I'm into
And the lines they try might as well be from a guy
But I can't get out of what I'm into

'Cause it's a steady job
And it's the only thing that makes me money
And it gives me something to cry about
'Cause my real life ain't fucking funny
Yeah my real life ain't fucking funny

Ooooh Lord, why have you forsaken me?
Ooooh Lord, why have you forsaken me?

The things I have to do would make a slut blush blue
But I can't get out of what I'm into
I figure two more years, then I'll go back to queers
But I can't get out of what I'm into

'Cause it's a steady job
And it's the only thing that makes me money
And it gives me something to laugh about
'Cause my real life ain't fucking funny

Ooooh Lord, why have you forsaken me?
Ooooh Lord, why have you forsaken me?
Ooooh Lord, ooooh Lord
Ooooh Lord, why have you forsaken me?
