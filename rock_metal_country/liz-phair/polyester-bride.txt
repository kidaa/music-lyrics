I was talking, not two days ago
To a certain bartender I'm lucky to know
And I asked Henry, my bartending friend
If I should bother dating unfamous men
And Henry said,
";You're lucky to even know me,
You're lucky to be alive.
You're lucky to be drinking here for free,
'cause I'm a sucker for your lucky, pretty eyes.";
And then he said,
";Do you wanna be a polyester bride?
Or do you want to hang your head and die?
Do you want to find alligator cowboy boots they just put on sale?
Do you want to flap your wings and fly away from here?";
And I was sitting, not two days ago
Feeling lonely, 'cause I'm just feeling low
And I asked Henry, my bartending friend
Why it is that there are those kind of men
And Henry said,
";You're lucky to even know me,
You're lucky to be alive.
You're lucky to be drinking here for free,
'cause I'm a sucker for your lucky, pretty eyes.";
And then he said,
";Do you wanna be a polyester bride?
Or do you want to hang your head and die?
Do you want to find alligator cowboy boots they just put on sale?
Do you want to flap your wings and fly away from here?";
";Princess, do you really want to flap your wings and fly?
Because you've got time.";
He keeps telling me, ";You've got time.";
But I don't believe him
";You've got time.";
I keep on pushing harder
I keep on pushing farther away
But he keeps telling me, ";Baby";,
He says, ";Baby, yeah
Do you want to be a polyester bride?
Or do you want to hang your head and die?
Do you want to find alligator cowboy boots they just put on sale?
Do you want to flap your wings and fly away from here?";
";Do you want to be a polyester bride?";
Away from here
";Do you want to be a polyester bride?";
Away from here
";Do you want to be a polyester bride?";
";Princess, do you really want to flap your wings and fly away from here?";
