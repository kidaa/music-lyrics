I can see the Russian Army rolling through my head
On one side of me lies the enemy, the other half is dead
I've got diamonds and I've got pearls
And I said, ";Hey mister, won't you come for me?";
You can take me home, but I will never be your girl
I won't let your mystery unfurl
That's the whole thing about it
I'm so in love today
I've been waiting at the bus stop
Come my way?
";Hey mister, won't you come for me?";
I'm a psychosomatic sister
Running around without a leash
You can take me home, but I will never be your girl
I won't let your mystery unfurl
With the Russian army rolling in my head
Snow is falling, January's all across the land
I've got seven other men in the ditches behind me
And I think I'm the last survivor 
";Hey mister, won't you come for me?";
I'm a psychosomatic sister
Running around without a leash
You can take me home, but I will never be your girl
I won't let your mystery unfurl
