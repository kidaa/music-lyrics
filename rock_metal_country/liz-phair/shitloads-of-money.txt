Louis is probably thirty years old but he looks like a solid 45
Louis says he's got a headache
I look in his eyes, and I believe him
The big L.K.'s and the gangster disciples
Louis can't think of who else could take over
But he just can't get up in the morning
A genuine face, braced for survival
It's nice to be liked
But it's better by far to get paid
I know that most of the friends that I have
Don't really see it that way
But if you can give 'em each one wish
How much do you wanna bet?
They'd which success for themselves and their friends
And that would include lots of money
Don't know how many times you were stuck in the morning
You just couldn't move, though you mother was calling
You know what you need is a Lotto revival
A train flashes by and you're lost in a spiral
It's nice to be liked
But it's better by far to get paid
I know that most of the friends that I have
Don't really see it that way
But if you can give 'em each one wish
How much do you wanna bet?
They'd which success for themselves and their friends
And that would include lots of money
Take the train on up to the zoo
Don't look back on what you've been through
Cause everyone's got a Monday
It looks like shit and must be America
It burns so quick, and it must be America
It's nice to be liked
But it's better by far to get paid
I know that most of the friends that I have
Don't really see it that way
But if you can give 'em each one wish
How much do you wanna bet?
They'd which success for themselves and their friends
And that would include lots of money
I would surely include lots of money
You've got to have shitloads of M-O-N-E-Y, money
