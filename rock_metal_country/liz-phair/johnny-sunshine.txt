You took the car, it was my favorite one 
Little white Dart, and drove it to Idaho 
You took the rug, red-and-white checkerboard 
Rolled it right up and took it to Idaho 
You left me nothing 
You left me nothing 
Johnny Sunshine 
You took the horse, it was a thoroughbred 
Saddled it up out on the interstate 
You took my kid, it was my only one 
Smart little bitch, and drove her to Idaho 
You left me nothing 
You left me nothing 
Johnny Sunshine 
You left me nothing 
You left me nothing 
Johnny Sunshine 
You took the house, you went and changed the locks 
Now I am stuck living out of a box 
You took my car, it was my favorite one 
Little white Dart, and drove it to Idaho 
You left me nothing 
You left me nothing 
Johnny Sunshine
