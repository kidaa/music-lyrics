Did you hear mother --
saying I'm wrong but I know I'm right.
Did you hear father
Calling my name into the night.
Saying I'll never be what I am now.
Telling me I'll never find what I've already found.
It was they who were wrong,
and for them here's a song.

Did you hear baby --
come back and tell you the things he's seen.
Did it surprise you
to be picked up at eight in a limousine
Doing the things he's accustomed to do.
Which at one time it seemed like a dream
now it's true.
And unknowing
you made it all happen this way.

Did you hear mother --
saying I'm wrong but I know I'm right.
Did you hear father
Calling my name into the night.
Saying I'll never be what I am now.
Telling me I'll never find what I've already found.
It was they who were wrong
and for them here's a song.
