[Introduction:]
She's really turned on by the television, and vice versa.
Here's a song called, .  Yes, right.  Rearranged though,
nevertheless.  A new lease on life.  In other words, it's just a bit
louder.  ``Dharma For One''.

[Lyrics:]
Dharma, seek and you will find
truth within your mind, Dharma.

Dharma, each to his own we say,
together we'll end astray, Dharma.

Truth is like freedom, it doesn't fool me.
Be true to yourself, never think that you're free.
Dharma will come eventually.

[Outtroduction:]
Thank you!
