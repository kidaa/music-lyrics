In and out of shady places ---
walking on cold corners of the maze.
Following the trace you leave unwittingly.
I wanna be no Saboteur.
Oh, no, me no Saboteur.

Painted ducks across your landscape ---
happy in your domesticity it don't come free.
Misfortune, like a Sparrow Hawk, hangs over you.
Wanna be no Saboteur.
No, no, me no Saboteur.

Deepest regrets I humbly offer you
as I cut into your life.
With clean precision, all is simplified ---
pass the hat and pass the knife.

By now you must be worried, wondering
who is me and what lies behind my art.
I'm only removing broken sea-shells from the beach ---
oh, no, me no Saboteur.

There's at least one of me inside your ranks
in your factory or school.
I anticipate a cleansing opportunity
to take the horns by the bull.

History forever writing
pages to be cut or painted grey,
or celebrated like Jesus in his
temple rage
as he chased the money-men away.

I wanna be no Saboteur.
Be no, be no Saboteur.
