The money won't last forever ---
rent man called twice today.
I hope some day you'll find me
in the lap of luxury.

Searched for a new apartment
but they don't grow on trees.
Just want to lay my head
in the lap of luxury.

Stepped out on a new horizon ---
felt a new spring in my feet.
Found a job, it could set me up
dangling in the lap of luxury.

And the gaffer is a man of substance ---
drives a jag and takes high tea.
Lives beyond the industrial wasteland,
laughing in the lap of luxury.

I need money, now, to soothe my heart!

Buy me a Datsun or Toyota ---
get the tax man to agree
all expenses I can muster
from the lap of luxury.
