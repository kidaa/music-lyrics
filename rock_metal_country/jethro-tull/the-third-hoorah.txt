Hoorah!

WarChild, dance the days and nights away ---
sweet child, how do you do today
When your back's to the wall,
and your luck is your all,
then side with whoever you may.
Seek that which within lies waiting to begin
the fight of your life that is everyday.
Dance with the WarChild --- Hoorah.

WarChild, dance the days and nights away ---
sweet child, how do you do today
In the heart of your heart, there's the tiniest part
of an urge to live to the death ---
with a sword on your hip and a cry on your lips
to strike life in the inner child's breast.
Dance with the WarChild --- Hoorah.

WarChild, dance the days and nights away ---
sweet child, how do you do today
