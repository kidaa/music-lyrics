So many long days. In so many ways.
I try to get through to what lies deep inside of you.
Oh, baby.  I said, you're breaking me up, woman.
Yeah, you're breaking me down.
You're lying in little pieces --
scattered all around.

You're doing your worst to see me get hurt.
You're waiting to see the tears running out of me.
But, oh, baby, I said you're breaking me up, woman.
You're breaking me down.
You're lying in little pieces --
scattered all around.

My teares have run dry and you wonder why.
I've found a new woman who don't do the things you can.
Oh, baby, I said you're breaking me up, woman.
You're breaking me down.
You're lying in little pieces --
scattered all around.
