I feel so sad now that she's gone,
I've been loving that woman too long.
There is no place to go because my friends have all moved,
Got nothing but sit in the sun.
Got tired of crying, guess I'll move on alone.

My bed is so empty and my heart is grown cold,
guess I'll just die before I grow old.
The place is untidy, that's `cos I ain't done my dirt,
I just grown tired of thinking.
Got tired of crying, guess I'll move on alone.
