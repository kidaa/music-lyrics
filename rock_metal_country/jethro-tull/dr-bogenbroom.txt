I have one foot in the graveyard and the other on the bus,
and the passengers do trample each other in the rush.
And the chicken hearted lawman is throwing up his fill
to see the kindly doctor to pass the super pill.
Well, I'm going down, three cheers for Doctor Bogenbroom.
Well, I'm on my way, three cheers for Doctor Bogenbroom.

Well I've tried my best to love you all,
all you hypocrites and whores,
with your eyes on each other and the locks upon your doors.
Well you drowned me in the fountain of life and I hated you
for living while I was dying, we were all just passing through.
Well, I'm going down, three cheers for Doctor Bogenbroom.
Well, I'm on my way, three cheers for Doctor Bogenbroom.
