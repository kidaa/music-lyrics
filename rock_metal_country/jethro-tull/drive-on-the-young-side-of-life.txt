Your mother she protected you
And softened every blow
And brought you up to fear the worst
To be careful as you go

And the learned educators
With drip-feed thrifty facts to fill
You up to here with reason
Well-meaning overkill

If you find yourself a-growing
to be old before your time
Get off the endless corridor
Set your soul out on the line

Drive on the young side of life

When the pressure pains are building
And you're forced to join the crush
In the race to mediocrity
So respectable and plush

And while the child within is raging
And threatens to break out
Get off the endless corridor
Make a timely turnabout

Drive on the young side of life.
