In the hands of science ---
the complete appliance.
We're moved to motor.
Do you fly a Spitfire
Do you slide on a tea-tray
Or walk on a short trip Sundays.
Or drive come what may enjoy.

Automotive science and engineering.

When big was better ---
and fast was chic,
the oil was cheaper ---
now we're up the creek.
But the Japs are coming
and everyone's turbo'd
and carbon fibre
is the way to go, go.

Down at the robot factory
things are humming.
New radical suspension ---
no humans testing.
Wind it up, wind it up.
Take a trip
in your Freudian slip.
Doctor Ferdinand Ferdie
has you in his grip.
