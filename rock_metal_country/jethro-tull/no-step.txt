I looked out of my window, saw a stencil black,

NO STEP. NO STEP.

There were nervous mothers with children crying in the back.

NO STEP. NO STEP.

Someone bought me my ticket, now I'm on the wing.

Hope my angels are watching me, do I hear them sing

NO STEP. NO STEP.

Those afterburners cut in and kicked us high.

NO STEP. NO STEP.

The thin air shimmered, the sun cut through and burned my eye.

NO STEP. NO STEP.

Someone bought me my ticket, now I'm on the wing.

Hope my angels are watching me, do I hear them sing

NO STEP.
NO STEP NO STEP.
NO STEP NO STEP.
NO STEP NO STEP.

Give me a jet stream schooner or a crew-legged goose.

NO STEP. NO STEP.

I'm a clear-air jockey when they turn me loose

NO STEP. NO STEP.

Someone bought me my ticket to the captain's seat.

Will the shakes soon leave me, will I find my feet

NO STEP. NO STEP.
NO STEP. NO STEP.

NO STEP.
