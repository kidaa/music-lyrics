Tune into messages
from the Eastern avenue.
Lock on to the ether ---
squeeze the signal through and through.
War of the air-waves
making scare-waves.
I'm getting pictures
from my radio Free Moscow.
Moscow Radio.

Voice of America ---
symbol of the free.
Mine of disinformation
pleading sympathy.
Down in the cold-war games
forever naming names.
I'm getting pictures
from my radio Free Moscow.
Keep getting pictures
from my radio Free Moscow.

I put my headphones on ---
reach out on the beam.
Shutter up the windows ---
I'm getting up some steam.
Somebody's at the door
catching me in the act ---
they've been keeping the score.
I'm getting pictures
from my radio Free Moscow.
Yes, I'm getting pictures
from my radio Free Moscow.
