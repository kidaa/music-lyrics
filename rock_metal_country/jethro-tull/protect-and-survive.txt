They said protect and you'll survive ---
but our postman didn't call
8lbs. of over-pressure wave seemed to glue him to the wall
They said protect and you'll survive

E.M.P. took out the radio ---
and our milk-man didn't call
Flash blinded by the pretty lights,
didn't see his bottles fall
or feel the warm black rain arrive

Big friendly cloud builds in the West
and our dust-men haven't called
They left the dual carriageway at a hundred miles an hour ---
a tail wind chasing them away

And in deep shelters lurk below, sub-regional control
who sympathise but cannot help
to mend your body or your soul
Self-appointed guadians of the race with egg upon their face
When steady sirens sing all-clear they pop up,
find nobody here

And so I watch two new suns spin ---
our paper man doesn't call
Burnt shadow printed on the road --- now there's nothing there at all
They said protect and you'll survive
