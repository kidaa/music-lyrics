Took a sad song of one sweet evening
I smiled and quickly turned away.
It's not easy singing sad songs
but still the easiest way I have to say.
So when you look into the sun
and see the things we haven't done --
oh was it better then to run
than to spend the summer crying.
Now summer cannot come anyway.

I had waited for time to change her.
The only change that came was over me.
She pretended not to want love --
I hope she was only fooling me.
So when you look into the sun
look for the pleasures nearly won.
Or was it better then to run
than to spend the summer singing.
And summer could have come in a day.

So if you hear my sad song singing
remember who and what you nearly had.
It's not easy singing sad songs
when you can sing the song to make me glad.
So when you look into the sun
and see the words you could have sung:
It's not too late, only begun,
we can still make summer.
Yes, summer always comes anyway.

So when you look into the sun
and see the words you could have sung:
It's not too late, only begun.
Look into the sun.
