Come running.  Go for overkill.
If you don't come now, I'll be over the hill, all right
Tell me, ``All right.''
Got a sell-by date.  Soon be out of stock.
Pop me in your trolley you can start my clock.  Well, all right
Tell me, ``All right.''
I could be on your shelf, could be the risk you take.
I'm a cup of hot coffee, I'm a piece of cake.

I'm the hot chicken in your superstore.
You can take me home if you can take some more, Well, all right
Tell me, ``All right.''
I could be on your shelf, could be the bread you bake.
I can fill your larder, I'm a piece of cake.

Show me rosemary, I'll show her wild thyme.
See you at the checkout or on the credit line.  Well, all right
Tell me, ``All right.''
I'm your spicy filling, I'm your low-fat spread.
I'll be your smooth rubber, be your pencil lead, All right
Tell me, ``All right.''
If you set me to simmer, if you grill my steak--
you can bowl me over, I'm a piece of cake.
