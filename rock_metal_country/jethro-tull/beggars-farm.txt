You're taking chances.  And your reputation's going down.
Going out in the night-time.  You think you make no sound.
But you don't fool me.  `Cos I know what you feel.
If you ignore the things I say --
someday soon's gonna find you
`way down on Beggar's Farm.

I pay my money for no returns.
I think I need you.  Going to find someone.
Oh, you don't fool me.  `Cos I know what you feel.
When you go out I ask you why.
And I won't worry when I see you lying
down on Beggar's Farm.

When you run to me, going to turn away.
Won't even listen when you try to say
that you were only fooling around --
`Cos I know what you feel.
But if you ask me nicely, woman --
I'll wake up early one day soon and
I'll visit you down on Beggar's Farm.
