Good morning Weathercock: How did you fare last night
Did the cold wind bite you, did you face up to the fright
When the leaves spin from October
and whip around your tail
Did you shake from the blast, did you shiver through the gale

Give us direction; the best of goodwill ---
Put us in touch with fair winds.
Sing to us softly, hum evening's song ---
Tell us what the blacksmith has done for you.

Do you simply reflect changes in the patterns of the sky,
Or is it true to say the weather heeds the twinkle in your eye
Do you fight the rush of winter; do you hold snowflakes at bay
Do you lift the dawn sun from the fields and help him on his way

Good morning Weathercock: make this day bright.
Put us in touch with your fair winds.
Sing to us softly, hum evening's song.
Point the way to better days we can share with you.
