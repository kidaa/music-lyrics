Six o'clock in the morning
Wake up by the bed
There sits a Japanese toy
And I like it
See the name on the wrapping
Can't read yet but I know
it's made for me lucky boy
And I want it
Lights that flash, wheels that go round
Digital display
Fresh silicon chips to enjoy
And I need them
Where's the batteries
Sitting silent and empty
Wish I could breathe life
in my new friend who's terribly still
And I like him
Just like me. P'rhaps he's hungry.
Six volts make him smile
And twelve volts would probably kill
How I like him
Daddy, where's the batteries
I can't find my batteries
There's no batteries
Seven o'clock in the morning
They find me by the bed
with my friend the Japanese toy
I am with him
Mummy, Daddy --- can't see you,
hear you. Batteries not
included in this little boy
Where's my batteries
