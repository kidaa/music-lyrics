What did you think I'd be doing now 
While you left me 
I was thinking aloud 
Would there be no end to my sorrow 
Will I make it through tomorrow 
Fate Stay With Me 

Chorus:
Oh, Please 
Fate Stay with me, and guide me along my way 
There has been so many problems 
So please stay, please, stay 
Fate stay with me, will you help me on my way 

Will you end my troubles 
Will you please stay, please... 
I wanted money and hope and 
A dream to carry me forever 

This is all the hope I got left 
Help me to get it together, now 
I can sing or act or dance but I still won't get far 
Unless you help me please to be a big star 

Repeat chorus 

I don't want to be a queen, no, 
Or a princess with all my jewels, oh 
If you could guide me 
And you could help me 
but don't go too far, I just want to be a star 

Repeat chorus 

Yes guide me 
Forever guide me 
Will you stay with me and guide me along the way 
If I succeed because of you, fate my friend 
I'll be so happy 

Repeat chorus
