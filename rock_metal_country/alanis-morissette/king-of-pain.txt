There's a little black spot on the sun today  
That's my soul up there  
it's the same old thing as yesterday  
That's my soul up there  
There's a black hat Caught in a high tree top  
That's my soul up there  
There's a flag pole rag and the wind wont stop  
That's my soul up there  

I have stood here before in the pouring rain  
With the world turning Circles running round my brain  
I guess I'm always hoping that you'll end this reign  
But it's my destiny to be the king of pain  

There's a fossil that's trapped in a high Cliff wall  
There's a dead salmon frozen in a waterfall  
There's a blue whale beached by a springtides ebb  
There's a butterfly trapped in a spiders web  
There's a king on a throne with his eyes torn out  
There's a blind man looking for a shadow of doubt  
There's a rich man sleeping on a golden bed  
There's a skeleton Choking on a Crust of bread  
There's a red fox torn by a huntsman's pack  
There's a black winged gull with a broken back  
There's a little black spot on the sun today  
it's the same old thing as yesterday  

I have stood here before in the pouring rain  
With the world turning Circles running round my brain  
I guess I always thought you Could end this reign  
But it's my destiny to be the king of pain  

Ill always be king of pain
