And you're like a 90's Jesus 
And you revel in your psychosis 
How dare you? 

You sample concepts like hors d'oeurves 
And you eat their questions for dessert 
And is it just me or is it hot in here? 

And you're like a 90's Kennedy 
And you're only a million years old 
They can't fool you 

They'll throw opinions like rocks in riots 
And they'll stumble around like hypocrites 
And is it just me or is it dark in here? 

You may never be or have a husband 
You may never have or hold a child 
You will learn to loose everything 
We are temporary arrangements 

And you're like a 90's Noah 
And they laughed at you when you packed all of your things 

And they wonder why you're frustrated 
And they wonder why you're so angry 
Is it just me or are you fed up 

And god bless you in you're travels 
in your conquests and queries...
