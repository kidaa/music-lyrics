There are worse things I could do, than go with a boy or two 
Even though the neighborhood thinks I'm trashy and no good 
I suppose it could be true, but there are worse things I could do 
I could flirt with all the guys, smile at them and bat my eyes 
Press against them when we dance, make them think they stand a chance 

Then refuse to see it through, that's a thing I'd never do 

I could stay home every night, wait around for Mr. Right 
Take cold showers every day, and throw my life away 
On a dream that won't come true 
I could hurt someone like me, out of spite and jealously 
I don't steal and I don't lie, but I can feel and I can cry 
A fact I'll bet you never knew 
But to cry in front of you, that's the worst thing I could do
