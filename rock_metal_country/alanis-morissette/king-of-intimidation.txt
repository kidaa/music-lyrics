Spoken words taken from an old recording:  The women of the family seem to feel that  
they owe it to the men of the family to look relaxed, rested, and attractive at  
dinnertime. 

For you they live in a quiet monastery 
For you they wear whatever you want them to as long as it is short 
They count to ten when you tell them how to drive 
And when they're afraid they let you speak for them 

All hail the king of intimidation 
Obeyer of Christian behavior 

For you we'll wax; we skin, chicken our legs 
For you we chew our nails if we had any but fake ones to do it 
We contradict him temporarily 
And it was somethin' about how you talk down to me 

All hail the king of intimidation 
Obeyer of Christian behavior 

The role of compromises for the family you now want some 
There's only so much we can do to make you rest assured 

I am single 
I am weary 
You're just jealous 
You're just confused 
You're just hungry 
You're in sin now 
You're not happy 
You like kidding 

All hail the king of intimidation 
Obeyer of Christian behavior 

He knows not of what he has wrongly done 
So forgive his ignorant behavior 

You are tortured 
You are captured 
You are busted 
We were silent 
You were tested 
You did better 
You are lonely 
Was it worth it? 
La,la,la,la
