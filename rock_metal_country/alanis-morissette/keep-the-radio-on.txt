Can you relate to what it says 
The lyrics are straight from the heart 
The soul is expressed in the lyrics 
The virtues and vices are released 

Chorus: 
Keep The Radio On, 
This song means so much to me 
Keep the Radio On, 
The words live right through me 
The lyrics are comforting 
Like I expressed them my self 
Keep The Radio on, the song speaks for itself. 

Why Can't You Relate 
To my way of thinking 
Why don't you understand 
All the things I am feeling 
I am not a stranger to opinions 
In fact i have my own 
I am no stranger to delusions 
Although you live through mine 

Repeat Chorus 

Keep The Radio On 
Keep The Radio On 
The words have their meaning 
Keep The Radio On 
Can't you feel what they are saying 
Keep The Radio On 

Repeat Chorus
