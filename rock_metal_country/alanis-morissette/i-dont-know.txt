Monday morning is not Monday morning 'till Taylor has his coffee 
Friday night is not Friday night 'till Jessie leaves the room sweating 
Tuesday morning is not Tuesday morning 'till Nick has his talk with his son 
Thursday night is not Thursday night 'till Chris has sex with his bass 

CHORUS
Come on to the Weekend 
'cause the Weekend I'll get high 
Hold off 'till the Weekend 
'cause there's too much time to think 
and they're really nice guys 

Tuesday morning is Wednesday afternoon when you cry all night 
Wednesday early we fall into work all caught up in the day by day 
Thursday morning is not Thursday morning 'till someone says how's your life 
How's your life? 
Ye how's your life 
How's your life? 

CHORUS Come on to the weekend 
'cause the weekend I'll get by 
Hold off 'till the weekend 
'cause there's too much time to think and not much time to cry 
Hold off 'till the weekend 
'cause the weekend we'll be high 
Hold off 'till the weekend 
'cause there'll be no time but we'll get by 

What if there were no more mama's boys 
What if no one shares their humble appearance 
What there were no consequences 
What if there were no more arguments 
Well that'd be a shame 
Wouldn't that be impossible 
and you would be board 
'cause you wouldn't want it a little to late... 

CHORUS
Hold on 'till the weekend 
'cause the weekend I'll get by 
Hold off 'till the weekend 
'cause the man upstairs has the really nice guys 
Hold off 'till the weekend 
'cause the weekend I'll get high 
Hold off 'till the weekend 
'cause we may look strange but we surely will get by 

What if there were no more mama's boys 
What if we all had no thinking together 
Would that be a shame... 
Wouldn't that'd be impossible 
and you would be bored 
'cause you wouldn't want to lead it away
