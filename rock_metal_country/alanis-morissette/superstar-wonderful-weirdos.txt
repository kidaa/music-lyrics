Sarah's only 10 and she's attracted to older men 
And they seem to like her back 
'Cause she's intelligent 
Billy's a football star 
And he drives around in his muscle car 
But he really really wants to be a ballerina 
And he wonders who am I? 
Who am I? 
And he wants to be a man 
But he doesn't understand 
It's alright to be what he wants 

I'm calling all Superstar Wonderful Weirdos 
Can you hear me call tonight? 
I know you're alone in your world 
Full of fear though 
But the more you run the harder it is to hide 

Well, Jonny studies rockets 
With his plastic protected pockets so his pens don't leak out upon the floor 
Where Jenny's rolling 
And she's scared of growing 
'Cause she is 5 feet taller than the girl next door 
And she wonders who am I? 
What the hell am I? 
And she's got a lot to offer 
But she doesn't look like Cindy Crawford 
And it makes her cry 

I'm calling all Superstar Wonderful Weirdos 
Can you hear me call tonight? 
I know you're alone in your world 
Full of fear though 
But the more you run the harder it is to hide 

It's a total rejection of the system 
It's the honest opinion for the very first time 
It's a different position, of living 
And its time that you made up your minds 

I'm calling all Superstar Wonderful Weirdos 
You're not alone tonight 
I'm calling all Superstar Wonderful Weirdos 
Can you hear me call tonight? 
I know you're alone in your world 
Full of fear though 
But the more you run the harder it is to hide 

I'm calling all Superstar Wonderful Weirdos 
Can you hear me call 

Can you hear me call tonight? 
I'm calling all Superstar Wonderful Weirdos
