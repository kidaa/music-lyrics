Dear matthew I like you a lot I realize you're in a relationship with someone right now and 
I respect that I would like you to know that if you're ever single in the future 
And you want to come visit me in california I would be open to spending time with you 
And finding out how old you were when you wrote your first song 

Dear eric I liked you too much I used to be attracted to boys who would lie to me 
And think solely about themselves and you were plenty self-destructive for my taste at the time 
I used to say the more tragic the better the truth is whenever I think of the early 90's your face 
Comes up with a vengeance like it was yesterday 

Dear terry I love you muchly you've been nothing but open hearted and emotionally available 
And supportive and nurturing and consummately there for me I kept drawing you in 
And pushing you away I remember how beautiful it was to fall asleep on your couch 
And cry in front of you for the first time you were the best platform from which to jump 
Beyond myself what was wrong with me 

Dear marc you rocked my world you had a charismatic way about you with the women 
And you got me seriously thinking about spirituality and you wouldn't let me get away 
With kicking my own ass but I could never really feel relaxed and looked out for around 
You though and that stopped us from going any further than we did and it's kinda too bad 
Because we could've had much more fun 

Dear terrance you were an adventure besides being a few decades older than I was 
You used to write the most poetic loveletters and I still have them you were in 
And out of several marriages and you liked them young and naive so you could have 
The power and the dramas to feel fear I wonder what your wife thought of all of this 

Dear christian we learned so much I realize we won't be able to talk for some time 
And I understand that as I do you the long distance thing was the hardest and we did 
As well as we could we were together during a very tumultuous time in our lives I will always 
Have your back and be curious about you about your career about your whereabouts 

Dear taylor I missed you a lot there was a period of time when I was too mad to even bring up 
Your name and it killed me to hear you discount the time we spent together I knew all along 
That we had different tastes in moderations and we couldn't hang out forever and while it lasted 
It was hilarious
