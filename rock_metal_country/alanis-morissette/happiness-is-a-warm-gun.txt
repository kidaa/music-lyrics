She's not a girl who misses much 
She's well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand 
Like a lizard on a window pane 
The man in the crowd with the multicolored mirrors 
On his hobnailed boots 
Lying with his eyes while his hands 
Working over time 
A soap impression of his wife which he ate 
And donated to the Nation's Trust 
I need a fix cause I'm going down 
Down to the bitch that I left uptown 
I need a fix cause I'm going down 
Mother Superior jumped the gun 
Mother Superior jumped the gun 
Happiness is a warm gun 
Happiness is a warm gun 
When I hold you in my arms 
And I feel my finger on your trigger 
I know that nobody can do me no harm 
Happiness is a warm gun, mama 
Happiness is a warm gun
