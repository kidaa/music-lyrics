a green plastic watering can 
for a fake chinese rubber plant 
in fake plastic earth 
that she bought from a rubber man 
in a town full of rubber plants 
to get rid of itself 

it wears her out 
it wears her out 
it wears her out 
it wears her out 

she lives with a broken man 
a cracked polysterene man 
who just crumbles and burns 
he used to do surgery 
for girls in the eighties 
but gravity always wins 

and it wears him out 
it wears him out 
it wears him out 
it wears him out 
it wears...... 

she looks like the real thing 
she tastes like the real thing 
my fake plastic love 
and I can't help the feeling 
I could blow through the ceiling 
if I just turn and run.... 

and it wears me out 
it wears me out 
it wears me out 
it wears me out 

and if I could be who you wanted 
if I could be who you wanted 
all the time 
all the time 
all...
