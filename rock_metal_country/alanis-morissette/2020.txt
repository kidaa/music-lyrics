I would never have been in such a rush
I would never have tried to control
I would never have worn such 'fear lenses'
I would never have held on so tightly

I would have kept my boundaries set
My loving nos, my unwavering yess
Risked abandonment and stood by that
And thereby felt constant connect

This fountain of regret, this looking back with twenty-twenty
Torturous hindsight if i knew then what i know now
This mountain of remorse wont repeat with my understanding
This wouldnt have happened if i knew then what i know now

I wouldve gone slower
Pushed infrequent
Would not have rushed into such commitment
I wouldve shown restraint as my feet got wet
I wouldve baby-stepped into intimate

This fountain of regret, this looking back with twenty-twenty
This torturous hindsight if i knew then what i know now
This mountain of remorse wont repeat with my understanding
This wouldnt have happened if i knew then what i know now

I wouldve known much more
Known that time was all we had for future depth to unfold
I wouldve had more faith at every step
I wouldve kept intact through the whole process

Oh this fountain of regret is looking back with twenty-twenty
Torturous hindsight if i knew then what i know now
This mountain of remorse wont repeat with my understanding
This wouldnt have happened if i knew then what i know
