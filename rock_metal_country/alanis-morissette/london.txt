What it feels to fall in to the pool  
the hard shell bugs bite my forearm  
my right index fingernail chewed to the quick  
my cervix is a long ?  
my sprinklers go off at 6pm each day  
and sometimes they spray unsuspecting visitors  
my pimples are goosebumpshairs? all over my legs  
my brow is furrowed and my vision is blurred  
and how I do love London  
and how I do love London  

the birds make guttural sounds and protect me  
my friends come to visit and love me a lot  
I don't have the energy to fill this   
I am like flight attendants on a 12 hour flight  
and how I do love London  
and how I do love London  

I am intriguied by the boy with songs  
sometimes they write sometimes they write a lot  
the steam will smell of puke and left us in the shower  
the hug will feel forced upon you inconsolable thing  
and how I do love London  
and how I do love London  

deep breaths will not make my brain stand still  
to be loved and swallowed are single and depraved  
I love speaking French to the taxi drivers  
we slept and were cold on the train out of France 
and how I do love London  
and how I do love London
