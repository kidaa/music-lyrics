I pray for peace 
They require me to kick into high gear 
We may as well have our Phd's 
Might we compose was never taken into account 

I pray they let out or talk it out 
She would give me a wink across the room 
I would have made a really good lawyer 
I had a really good strategy for putting things back on the wall of the hoser 

Thank God it was the God dammed wall 
I would have to hide all my valuables 
Who would calm my mother down? 
Who would calm *me* down once I talked her through it? 

My mother and I were the official peace makers 
It was a full time job 
I would send my mother directly to bed do not collect 200 
We'd talk about it till 5am when I'd come visiting her 5 years later 

We would pray for peace 
It was most comfortable and familiar
