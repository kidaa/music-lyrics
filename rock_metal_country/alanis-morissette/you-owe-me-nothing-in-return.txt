I'll give you careless amounts of out right 
Acceptance if you want it. I'll give you 
Encouragement to choose the path you want if you need it.

You can speak of anger and doubts,
Your fears and freak-outs and I'll hold it.
You can share your so-called 
Shamefilled accounts of times in your life and I won't judge it.

And there are no strings attached,
You owe me nothing for giving the love that I give. 
You owe me nothing for caring the way that I have.
I give you thanks for receiving, it's my privilege,
And you owe me nothing in return. 

You can ask for space for yourself 
And only yourself and I'll grant it.
You can ask for freedom as was
Or time to revel and you'll have it.

You can ask to live by yourself
Or love someone else and I'll support it.
You can ask for anything you want 
Anything at all and I'll understand it.

I bet you're wondering when
The next payback you'll eventually drop.
I bet you're wondering when my conditions or policies will force you to cough up.
I bet you're wondering how far you now have danced moved back into dead.

This is the only kind of love 
As I understand it that there really is.
You can express your deepest of thruths
Even if it means I'll lose you and I'll hear it.

You can fall into the abyss
On the way to your bliss
And I'll empathize with.
You can't say that you'll have to skip town
To chase your passion and I'll hear it.
You can leave and hit rock bottom have a mid-life chrisis and I'll hold it.
