Alanis Morissette: 
I must be two lips 
I must be your sleep 
I must be blinded 
Keep it a question 
Keep it a question 
Keep it a question 

I must be spoiled 
I must be behind 
I must be asleep 
I must be fearful 
Keep it a question 
Love ain't a secret 
Keep it a question 
Keep it a question 

I must be two lips 
I must be your sleep 
I must plan to forget 
I must be suffering 
Keep it a question 
Letting nothing on 
Let's keep it a question 

Keep it a question 
Love ain't a secret 
Keep it a question 
Let it stop within 
Keep it a question
