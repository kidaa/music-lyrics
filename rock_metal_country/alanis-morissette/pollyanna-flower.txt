through you I see I 
Between a broken nose and a fake smile 
Between piety and gunpowder 
Between fighting and fleeing the scene 
Between murder and diplomacy 
Between aggression and ????? 
Between brutal and realistically well behaved 
Between screaming and pulling in the reins 
Between tiptoeing and ambleing 

What am I to do with all this fire 
I'd like to hit you but I'd never hit you 
Would you stay with me in this red space 
I'd like to slap you but I'd never slap you 

Chorus
Between violence and silently seething 
Between my fist and my pollyanna flower 
Between  fuck you  to your face and it's alright 
Between war and denial 

[chorus]

Between flying vases and secretly weeping 
Between loose cannons and ever downplaying 
Between bruises and rudely differing 
Between bursting and boiling 

What am I to do with all this burning 
I'd like to hurt you but I'd never hurt you 
Do I overwhelm you in this place 
I'd like to kill you but I'd never kill you 

[chorus]

What am I to do with all this fire 
Can you understand me in this place?
