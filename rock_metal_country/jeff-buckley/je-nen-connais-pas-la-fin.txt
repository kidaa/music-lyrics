I used to know a little square
So long ago, when I was small
All summer long it had a fair
Wonderful fair with swings and all
I used to love my little fair
And at the close of everyday

I could be found, dancing around
A merry-go-round that used to play...

"Ah, mon amour
A toi toujours
Dans tes grands yeux
Rien que nous deux"

All summer long my little fair
Made everyday like a holiday
Night after night it used to play
And people came there from so far away
And everyone sang that little tune
All around town you heard it played

Even Pepi from Napoli
He sang to Marie
This serenade...

"Ah, mon amour
A toi toujours
Dans tes grands yeux
Rien que nous deux"

All summer long my little fair
Made everyday like a holiday
Night after night it used to play
And people came there from so far away
And everyone sang that little tune
All around town you heard it played

Even Pepi from Napoli
He sang to Marie
This serenade...

"Ah, mon amour
A toi toujours
Dans tes grands yeux
Rien que nous deux"

I can't forget my little square
Even though I'm so far away
I can't forget my little fair
Maybe it's still there, still there today
I sometimes hear that little tune
playing in a dream of long ago

And in my brain runs the refrain
That old French refrain I used to know...

"Ah, mon amour
A toi toujours
Dans tes grands yeux
Rien que nous deux"
