Oooohhhhhhhhhh

Back when I was a baby, a baby saying his prayers, 
prayers soft and lonely, lonely all these days, 
days that meld into nothing, and nothing left for a boy 
but to hide his dreams away, hide all his dreams away

Daisies after daisies, a daisy for your floor
Ah days that melt into nothing
A promise piled to the door, 
door the door was open
There's nothing left for a boy but to hide these dreams away
...All those dreams decay

Laura...know this song for always
Laura...show this song to no one

I had to fight for these moments, sweet moments of mine
Each line must blossom and die but my song comes strong in time
Nothing left for a boy, nothing left for a boy
But to hide those dreams away, all those dreams decay

Laura...know this song for always
Laura...show this song to no one

Oh I had to fight for these moments, these sweet moments of mine
Each line must blossom , but my song comes strong in time
Although the door was open, there's nothing left for you now
But to hide your dreams away till they come into play

Laura...know this song for always
Laura...show this song to no one
Laura...know this song for always
Laura...Laura...show this song to no one
Show this song to no one
