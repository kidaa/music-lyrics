It's been such a long time 
And I was just a child then 
What will you say 
When you see my face? 
Time feels like it's flown away 
The days just pass and fade away 
What will you say 
When they take my place? 

It's funny now 
I just don't feel like a man 
What will you say 
When you see my face? 
My face... 

Mother dear, the world's gone cold 
No one cares about love anymore 
What will you say 
When you see my face? 

Father do you hear me?
Do you know me? 
Do you even care? 
What will you say 
When they take my place? 

My heart can't take this anymore 
What will you say 
When you see my face? 
When you see my, 
See my face... 

I can feel your time crawling 
To a slow end 
I can feel my time crawling 
To a slow end... 

Mother dear, the world's gone cold 
No one cares about love anymore 
What will you say 
When you see my face? 

Father do you hear me? 
Do you know me? 
Did you even care? 
What will you say 
When you take my place? 

Well it's so funny now 
I just don't feel like I'm a man 
What will you say?
