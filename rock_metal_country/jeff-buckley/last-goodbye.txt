J. Buckley
This is our last goodbye
I hate to feel the love between us die
But it's over
Just hear this and then I'll go :
 you gave me more to live for,
 more than you'll ever know.

This is our last embrace,
 must I dream and always see your face
Why can't we overcome this wall
Baby, maybe it is just because I didn't know you at all.

Kiss me, please,
Kiss me
But kiss me out of desire, babe, and not consolation
You know,
 it makes me so angry 'cause I know that in time
I'll only make you cry, this is our last goodbye.

Did you say ";no, this can't happen to me,";
and did you rush to the phone to call?
Was there a voice unkind in the back of your mind saying, 
";maybe... you didn't know him at all.";

Well, the bells out in the church tower chime
Burning clues into this heart of mine
Thinking so hard on her soft eyes and the memory 
Of her sighs that, ";it's over... it's over...";
