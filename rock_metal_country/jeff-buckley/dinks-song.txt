If i had wings like noah's dove
I'd fly up the river to the one i love
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well 

If i met your man, who was long and tall 
I'd hit his body like a cannon ball 
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well 

One of these days and it won't be long
Call my name and I'll be gone 
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well 

I remember one night, a drizzling rain
Round my heart i felt an achin' pain
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well 

When i wore my apron low 
Couldn't keep you from my do'
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well 

Now i wear my apron high
Scarcely ever see you passing by
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well 

Now my apron's up to my chin
You pass my door and you won't come in
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well 

If i had listened to what my mama said
I'd be at home in my mama's bed
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well
