J.Buckley
I know you are a woman by the way you burn below.
I'll tell you secrets so good, you'll never tell a soul.
Come closer, that bonfire holds his life like stones
My years, my life unknown.
Diamonds from he pavement
Where the broken glass had been.
Just like this troubles that I'm leaving to the wind.
Like sapphires in boxcars speeding towards the end.
Like thieves, my bad luck grows.
Jewel box of sadness, bring to catch your tear
Crystalize illusion shine, forgot I'm here
Jewel box of sadness, bring to catch your tear
Oh, you left some stars in my belly.
Star crossed child's love on the bands of wedding golds
Silver studs of promise hide in the red crushed velvet folds.
Inaction, intention, like emeralds I stole.
My speech of custom gold.
I think I ought to know.
Jewel box of sadness, bring to catch your tear
Crystalize illusion shine, forgot I'm here
Jewel box of sadness, bring to catch your tear
Oh, you left some stars in my belly.
You left some stars in my belly.
You left some stars in my belly.
