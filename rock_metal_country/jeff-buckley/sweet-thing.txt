And i will stroll the merry way 
And jump the hedges first 
And i will drink the clear 
Clean water for to quench my thirst
And i shall watch the ferry-boats 
And they'll get high 
On a bluer ocean 
Against tomorrow's sky 

And i will never NEVER grow so old again 
And WE will walk and talk 
In gardens wet with rain
OH OH SWEET THING SWEET THING
MY, MY, MY, MY, MY SWEET THING
AND I SHALL DRIVE MY CHARIOT DOWN YOUR STREETS AND CRY
Hey, it's me, i'm dynamite
And i don't know why
HEY YOU SO STRONG YOU HOLD ME IN YOUR ARMS AGAIN
AND I REMEMBER THAT I FELT SO OLD 
AND I WILL NEVER NEVER GROW SO OLD AGAIN

We shall walk and talk
In gardens all misty and wet with rain
My, my, my, my, my sweet thing 

And i will GO OUT TONITE
Into the MIDnight time sky 
And count the stars 
That's shining in your eye
And i'll be satisfied
NOT TO KNOW THE REASON WHY
In gardens all wet with rain 

And i will never, Never, Never, ever
Grow so old again.
Oh sweet thing, sweet thing
Sugar baby with your champagne eyes
And your saint-like smile...
