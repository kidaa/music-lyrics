                            I heard there was a secret chord
                            that David played and it pleased the Lord
                            But you don't really care for music, do you? 
                            Well it goes like this :
                            The fourth, the fifth, the minor fall and the major 
lift
                            The baffled king composing Hallelujah
                            Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah...
                            Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
                            You saw her bathing on the roof
                            Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
                            She tied you to her kitchen chair
                            She broke your throne and she cut your hair
                            And from your lips she drew an Hallelujah
                            Baby I've been here before
                            I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
                            I used to live alone before I knew ya
                            I've seen your flag on the marble arch
                            But love is not a victory march
                            It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
                            There was a time when you let me know
                            What's really going on below
                            But now you never show that to me do ya
                            But remember when I moved in you
                            And the holy dove was moving too
                            And every breath we drew was Hallelujah
                            Well, maybe there's a God above
                            But all I've ever learned from love
                            Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
                            It's not a cry that you hear at night
                            It's not somebody who's seen the light
                            It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
                            Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah...
