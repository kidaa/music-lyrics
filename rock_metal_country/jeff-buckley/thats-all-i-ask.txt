Don't try to blow out the sun for me baby
I'm not hoping for what I know can't be
All that I ask is for your smile each day
And I'll give you love, yes I will never go away
Yes I will, yes I will, yes I will
'Cause girl I wouldn't ask you to lift up this great big world little baby
I know that your not that kind of a girl, and

Nevermind now, with your heart, how much he's all

Nobody knows, how deep my love for you really goes
But girl, I want you to know
I wouldn't ask you to hold back the dawn by the dawn baby
That's just a little too much to ask of anyone

Nevermind now, with your heart, how much he's all

I want you to know
I wouldn't ask you to hold back the dawn by the dawn baby
That's just a little too much to ask of anyone
All that I ask, is for your loving ways
And I'll keep you happy for the rest of your natural born days

Nevermind now, with your heart, how much he's all
