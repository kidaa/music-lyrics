Ghost calls to visit 
With my keys in his pocket 
Kisses in my mouth with his 
Eyes hanging out of his sockets 
My memories crumble 
Under still resistance 
I was torn out like pages 
From the book of existence 

I woke up in a strange place 
My mind a blur and some blood on my chin 
I made a call for a blackened cab 
Some destination was moving on in 
I remember the words that you told me 
How they come down so hard, so plain 
Fate is going to find your love in a 
Glass of champagne 

I lied to my host i told him 
I knew how far i could go 
When i emptied my guts out 
On his brand new stereo 
Well he paid me to go upstairs 
And spend a night with his friend 
I never want to see my face 
In the mirror again 

I woke up in a strange place 
Music so loud that i spilled all my beer 
I met a ride in that blackened cab 
Some destination was all that he had 
Easy now, this car is speeding up 
For my last chance, crashing to freedom 
Fate is going to find your love in a 
Glass of champagne 

Sweat pours down 
You're in the back seat sleeping 
And she waits by the window 
On an empty bed, weeping 
The ghost guns the motor 
To the land that he promised me 
I guess this is the time when your 
Best intentions become facts again 

This is no song for the dislocated 
The one you loved but it turned to be hated 
Because the lies of the spirit possessed you 
Because the eyes of your lover resist you 
Listen now, you keep your aim steady 
As your temple turns to kiss the pistol 
Fate is going to find your love 
In a glass of champagne 

Fate is going to find your love 
In a glass of champagne
