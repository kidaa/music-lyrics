Alright alright alright alright...woah
Well...yeah
Well I'm your Harem man, I was paid two by two
Well I'm your Harem man, I will sing and dance for you
Oh baby say it
my love is great [inaudible]

Well well
Lay your nails down till they rake over me
Oh sweet pussy cat rake your nails all over me 
Oh you're so sweet, your pussy cat I'm gonna show you where it's at
Why don't you think I can [inaudible] free
I wanna be your fire when it's cold
It's raining outside mama...don't wait until you get too old
Take home a liter and push it in me
I wanna inject you in my blood
I wanna set you free

Well well

My world [Repeated], My Love

I wanna be your Harem man
Oh baby save you, do anything I can
I'll keep you waiting in a room of my own
A man can't be free until he's older
My, my my [repeated] woman, man

I wanna be your Harem man

I wish I was your $5 dollar bill
Spend all your money, pay all your thrills
I wish I could be your walking shoes, step all over me
and take away my blues

My world, my love

I wish I was you....
