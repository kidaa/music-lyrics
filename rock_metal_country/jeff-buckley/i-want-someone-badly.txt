Now I want someone badly
Got a girl here tonight
Want someone new
Someone new

But a little cry wants someone badly
Wanna know if this is a bad lease on me
I want know
I want know
Am I sure that I heard you right
I want to know
If you're leaving just do it tonight

Now I want someone badly
To burn in here with me
Better listen baby
'Cause I cry all over madly
Don't do anything to it with me
Ooh I wanna know
Am I sure that I have your love
I want know
If you're leaving just make sure it's right 

Now I want someone badly
To burn in here with me
Better listen baby
'Cause I cry all over madly
Don't do anything to it with me
Ooh I wanna know
Am I sure that I have your love
I want know
If you're leaving just make sure it's right 

Now I, I want someone badly
Could it be true
That someone is you ooooo
