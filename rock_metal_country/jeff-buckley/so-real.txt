J. Buckley/M. Tighe
Love, let me sleep tonight on you couch
And remember the smell of the fabric of your simple 
 city dress 
Oh... That was so real 
We walked around 'til the moon got full like a plate.
The wind blew an invocation 
And I fell asleep at the gate... And I never stepped
 - on - the - cracks - 'cause    
 - I - thought - I'd - hurt - my - mother 
... And I couldn't awake from the nightmare 
    That sucked me in and pulled me under
    Pulled me under

Oh... That was so real

I love you
But I'm afraid to love you
I love you
But I'm afraid to love you...
