Would you like to meet the villain somewhere
Underneath the skull of a moon.
Fire burned his eyes out
cause his chains are too long for you.
Someone has to pay for the damage done.
N-one's gonna love you now.
Your whole family's splintered,
You're a slave to it all,
now.
Oooooo Ahhhhh
You're a slave to it all now
You're a slve
Welcome down to paradise rock.
There is no single entrance,
With the stars to revolve around,
There is no real underground.
No stars to revolve around
Here, they're fashioning the noose.
Sickened by the knell of the graveyard bell
You know it's not long for you.
Sick of all the vomit childhood,
Not a trampoline for the freaks,
Not even a slave to your father.
Oh, you're a slave to it all, now,
Oh, you're a slave to it all, now.
Welcome down to paradise rock.
There is no single entrance
There's no stars to revolve around
There is no real underground.
You're a slave to it all, now.
Happy, happy, happy, happy,
