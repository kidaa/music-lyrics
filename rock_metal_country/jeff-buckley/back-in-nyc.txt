Originally contained in Genesis' The lamb lies down on Broadway
I see faces and traces of home
Back in New York City
So you think I'm a tough kid
Is that what you heard?
Well, I like to see some action,
And it gets into my blood.
Well, they let me out of Pontiac
When I was just seventeen
I had to get it out of me
If you know what I mean, what I mean.
They say I must be crazy
Cause I don't care who I hit, who I hit.
Cause I know it's me that's hitting out
And I know I'm not full of shit.
Down by my bottle, filled up high with gasoline
You can tell by the night fires
Where a rail has been, has been.
As I cuddled the porcupine
He said I had none to blame but me.
Gave my heart, deep in hell,
Time to shave, shave  it off, it off
No time for romantic escape and your
Fluffy heart is ready for rape
Off we go. Off we go. Off we go
You're sitting in your comfort
Who don't believe I'm real
You cannot buy protection
For the way that I feel.
Your progressive hypocrites
Handing out their trash
It was mine in the first place
So I'll burn to ash.
When I've taken all the strongest meats
And laid them down in colored sheets
Well, who needs illusions,
Of love and affection when you're out
Walking in the streets, your mainline connection.
Connection.
As I cuddled the porcupine
He said I had none to blame but me.
Held my heart, deep in hell,
Time to shave, shave  it off, it off
No. No time for romantic escape
And your fluffy heart is ready for rape
No. No time for romantic escape
And your fluffy heart is ready for rape
No time.
Back in New York City.
