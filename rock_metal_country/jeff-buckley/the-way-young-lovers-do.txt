Oh...

We strolled through fields all wet with rain
And back along the lane again
There in the sunshine
In the sweet summertime
Oh the way that young lovers do

I kissed you on the lips once more
We said goodbye at your front door
There in the nighttime
Love, that's the right time
Oh to feel the way that young lovers do

And we sat on our own star and dreamed of the way that we were and the
way that we wanted to be
And we sat on our own star and dreamed of the way that I was for you
and that you were for me
And then we long to dance the night away
Turned to each other, saying 'I love you, baby I love you'
Oh the way that young lovers do
Lovers do...
Do, do, do, do...

The way young lovers do
Do, do, do, do...

The way young lovers do...

And we sat on our own star and dreamed of the way that we were and the way
that we wanted to be
And we sat on our own star and dreamed of the way that I was for you
and you were for me
Oh baby, baby.
And then we long to dance the night away
And turned to each other, saying 'I love you, baby I love you'
Oh the way...

I held her with her looking down
And I kissed her, with the snow falling down
In the street light
It was a sweet light
And the way that young...
Oh, the way that young lovers...
Oh the way that young... that young lovers...
That young lovers do.

Good night
