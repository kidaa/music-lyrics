Oh Yeah

Born no longer just a baby
Always trying to keep in one place for long, oh long enough to sleep
Oh sleep and dreams are here the same
[Inaudible] got no rest they'll no longer speak to you

Moving on again
I'm moving...moving on again
Well I'm moving...moving on again
Baby...you're so cruel

You're cruel to yourself, so you never understand, 
Boy'l never do ya no harm,
For you to build the frame of the bed you sleep upon.
So spill your milk and honey, get your kicks off your next man. 
Bigger than you think and make him go, go on. 

Make him move on, moving on again
Oh he's moving...moving on again
Baby, you're so cruel

They thought about the dream is so real now
These are dreams of mine
You're so aimless, so aimless
You baby, you're so cruel
You're so cruel

Wonder what your gonna think of yourself when the phone calls fade away, 
As you hold his shoulders 
Did you think it would come to this day?
Ask yourself why he's off when others surround you
He was one of many on the day he found you

Uh-huh, you're moving, moving on again
Yeah, you're moving, moving on again
Yeah, you're moving, moving on again

Baby, you're so cruel
