THERE'S NOT A STAR LEFT IN THE SKY TONIGHT
THAT HASN'T BEEN WISHED ON
AND I'VE BEEN WISHIN I COULD FIND ME A WISHIN' WELL
I'D THROW IN EVERY PENNY I OWN
I'VE GOT MOONLIGHT AND A WARM JUNE NIGHT
ALL THAT' S MISSING HERE IS YOU
ME AND THE MOON HAVE NEVER BEEN SO BLUE
CHORUS:
IF I MAY I WISH I MIGHT FIND YOU LYING BESIDE ME
IN A WAY
I CAN SEE YOUR EYES IN THE STARS
BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME
I WANNA SEE THE STARS IN YOUR EYES TONIGHT
TO BE THE STARS IN YOUR EYES TONIGHT
JUST ME AND THE STARS IN YOUR EYES TONIGHT
BUT IT'S ME AND THE MOON
IT SEEMS IF YOU BELIEVE IN A DREAM ENOUGH
IT HAS TO COME TRUE
AND MINE WOULD TURN BACK TIME TILL THE WORLD UNWINDS
IF I COULD ONLY BE HOLDING YOU
SO IF A STAR FALLS FROM THE SKY TONIGHT
YOU'LL KNOW WHAT I TRIED TO DO
ME AND THE MOON HAVE NEVER BEEN SO BLUE
IF I MAY I WISH I MIGHT FIND YOU LYING BESIDE ME
IN A WAY
I CAN SEE YOUR EYES IN THE STARS
BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME
I WANNA SEE YOUR EYES IN THE STARS TONIGHT
TO BE THE STARS IN YOUR EYES TONIGHT
JUST ME AND THE STARS IN YOUR EYES TONIGHT
AND NOT ME AND THE MOON
CHORUS
AND ME AND THE MOON HAVE NEVER BEEN SO BLUE
