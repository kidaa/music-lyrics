OUT ON THE PORCH SWING
LIKE SOME OLD PAINTING
HE SEEMS LIKE HE DON'T MOVE AT ALL
AND SOMEWHERE A BELL RINGS
AND HE'S JUST REMEMBERING
THE LAST TIME THAT SHE EVER CALLED
HE PICKS UP THE PHONE AND HE SAYS TO THE DIAL TONE
CHORUS:
IT'S STILL LIFE WITHOUT YOU
AND I STILL HOLD ON
WHAT I FEELS LIKE
YOU CAN'T GO BY THAT
IT'S STILL LIFE....STILL LIFE WITHOUT YOU
THE CHANCES WERE GIVEN
TO GET ON WITH LIVIN
THE TRUTH IS THAT HE NEVER TRIED
AND NO ONE EVER SEES HIM
MOST FOLKS DON'T EVEN
REMEMBER WHICH ONE OF'EM DIED
BUT HE STILL DENIES IT.. HE CLOSES HIS EYES AND...
REPEAT CHORUS
OH STILL LIFE..STILL LIFE WITHOUT YOU
OUT ON THE PORCH SWING
LIKE SOME OLD PAINTING
HE SEEMS LIKE HE DON'T MOVE AT ALL
