I KNOW WHAT YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR
A LITTLE LOVE AND HAPPINESS
THE TRUTH IN FRONT OF YOU SO HARD
TO IGNORE
ALL YOU NEED IT TENDERNESS
SO DROP THE NORMA JEAN
I AIN'T NO JAMES DEAN
JUST LET IT FLOW
NO NEED TO FAKE IT BABE
WE CAN MAKE IT BABE, IF WE JUST LET IT GO
CHORUS: IT'S ONLY NATURAL BABY
YOU AND ME DANCING CLOSE
THIS COULD BE LOVE
YOU NEVER KNOW
JUST TAKE MY HAND NOW BABY
WE CAN MOVE IT OUT ON THE FLOOR
THIS COULD BE THE LOVE THAT YOU'VE WAITED FOR
DON'T SIT AROUND AND DREAM
LET'S DO, THE NATURAL THING
YOU'RE THINKING MAYBE I'M JUST BREAKING THE RULES
BY COMING ON A LITTLE STRONG
BUT I GOT INFORMATION YOU CAN USE
SO LIGHTEN UP AND PLAY ALONG
LET'S HAVE A WING DING
A LITTLE SPRING THING
DON'T TELL ME NO
I DON'T WANT NO WEDDING RING
AIN'T RUSHING ANYTHING
JUST LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL
REPEAT CHORUS
SO, DROP THE NORMA JEAN
I AIN'T NO JAMES DEAN
JUST LET IT FLOW
NO NEED TO FAKE IT BABE
NOW WE CAN MAKE IT BABE, IF YOU
JUST LET IT GO
 REPEAT CHORUS
