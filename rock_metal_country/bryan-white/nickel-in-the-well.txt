I'VE GOT A FOUR LEAF CLOVER
I HUNG A HORSESHOE ON THE WALL
I THREW SALT OVER MY LEFT SHOULDER
I'LL TRY ANYTHING AT ALL
TO GET LUCKY WITH YOU
I WANT YOU SO MUCH
UNTIL YOU WANT ME TOO
I AIN'T GONNA GIVE UP
CHORUS: I'LL THROW ANOTHER NICKEL IN THE WELL
TELL MYSELF THIS TIME MAYBE IT'LL HELP
TO MAKE MY DREAMS COME TRUE
I'LL MAKE ANOTHER WISH UPON A STAR
JUST IN CASE YOU'RE OUT IN YOUR BACKYARD
LOOKIN UP THERE TOO
WITH A LOT OF LOVE AND A LITTLE LUCK
YOU'LL FALL LIKE I FELL
I'LL JUST CROSS MY FINGERS
AND THROW ANOTHER NICKEL IN THE WELL
IF I COULD GET HOUDINI
TO TEACH ME A TRICK OR TWO
THEN MAYBE YOU WOULD SEE ME
IN THE WAY I WANT YOU TO
GONNA KNOCK ON WOOD
IT AIN'T BEEN EASY
I'VE DONE EVERYTHING I COULD
TO MAKE YOU NEED ME
REPEAT CHORUS
WITH A LOT OF LOVE AND A LITTLE LUCK
YOU'LL FALL LIKE I FELL
I'LL JUST CROSS MY FINGERS
AND THROW ANOTHER NICKEL IN THE WELL
