I MADE A PROMISE TO MYSELF
NEVER AGAIN
TO GET BURNED BY SOMEONE ELSE
UNTIL YOU WALKED IN
I FELT THE OLD MAGIC BEGIN
I FELT THE ROOM STARTIN TO SPIN
AS MY WILL CAME TUMBLING DOWN
CHORUS:
I CAN'T HELP IT IF I'M BLINDHEARTED
FALLIN AGAIN
I CAN'T HELP IT IF MY HEART HAS STARTED
SLOWLY CAVIN IN
AND I KEEP ON HOLDIN OUT FOR YOU
OH, I GUESS I'M JUST A BLINDHEARTED FOOL
I'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY TO LIVE
ON MY OWN
I NEED TO FIND SOMEONE WHO'LL GIVE
ME LOVE THAT'S STRONG
IT'S LIKE A RACE AGAINST TIME
UNTIL YOUR FACE ENTERS MY MIND 
AND YOU STILL
BURN ME TO THE GROUND
REPEAT CHORUS
TELL EVERYONE TO GATHER 'ROUND
THEY WON'T BELIEVE THE VIEW
THEY'RE LOOKING AT A BLINDHEARTED FOOL...
OVER YOU
