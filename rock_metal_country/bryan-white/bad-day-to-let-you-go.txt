GOT A HOLE IN MY SHOE
AND A BAD CASE OF THE BLUES
ON TOP OF THAT IT'S RAINING TOO
I PICKED A BAD DAY TO LET YOU GO
I GOT NOTHING BUT TIME
NOTHING BUT YOU HERE ON MY MIND
I GUESS THE STARS GOT OUT OF LINE
I PICKED A BAD DAY TO LET YOU GO
CHORUS:
WHY DID I WALK AWAY
I MUST HAVE BEEN CRAZY
IF I COULD RELIVE THAT DAY
I'D MAKE IT RIGHT BABY
IT WAS JUST THE WRONG FRAME OF MIND
WRONG PLACE WRONG TIME, BUT I KNOW
I PICKED A BAD DAY TO LET YOU GO
I'M STARING HOLES THROUGH THESE WALLS
WAITIN ON LADY LUCK TO CALL
GIRL, I'M ONLY HUMAN AFTER ALL
JUST PICKED A BAD DAY TO LET YOU GO
CHORUS:
WHY DID I WALK AWAY
I MUST HAVE BEEN CRAZY
I'M PAYING FOR IT EVERYDAY
THAT YOU'RE GONE BABY
IT WAS JUST A WRONG FRAME OF MIND
WRONG PLACE WRONG TIME, BUT I KNOW
I PICKED A BAD DAY TO LET YOU GO
REPEAT FIRST CHORUS
