She's got butterflies, you've got 'em too
You look into her eyes and it's quite a view
You see forever all mapped out
I hope you know what you're talking about
It ain't the falling in love that pulls you through
When the times get tough what you gonna do
To make it last day out and day in
It ain't the falling in love it's the stayin'
You call each others' faults endearing traits
Until the day they all start to irritate
When the new is getting gone
That's when you learn how to keep hangin on
Through the ins and outs
Through the waves of doubt
That's what love's about
