REBECCA LYNN GREW UP IN CAROLINA
HALF A MILE FROM TUCKER CHERRY'S FARM
A QUIET GIRL WITH GREEN EYES FULL OF FIRE
HER DADDY'S PRIDE AND ALL HER MAMA'S CHARM
REBECCA LYNN BECAME MY HEART'S DESIRE
LONG ABOUT THE START OF SECOND GRADE
MRS. ROSENBLOOM LET ME SIT BESIDE HER
WE PASSED NOTES THEN AFTER SCHOOL WE PLAYED SINGIN
RING AROUND THE ROSIE, POCKET FULL OF DREAMS AND POSIES
PATTY-CAKE, A BAKERS MAN, TAG YOU'RE IT, KICK THE CAN
I THINK I HEAR MY MAMA CALLING, GOTTA GO
MAN I LOVED HER SO
HIGH SCHOOL DAYS, ME AND BECKY LEARNIN'
WHAT IT REALLY MEANS TO BE IN LOVE
GIVE AND TAKE, HOLDIN BACK FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE
FIGHTIN' FOR A WEEK, THEN MAKIN' UP
I SAID ";PLEASE BECKY WON'T YOU MARRY ME?";
PROM NIGHT IN MY CAR OUT BY THE CURB
SHE WAS SO SURPRISED, FIRST SHE LAUGHED AND THEN SHE CRIED
AND SOMEWHERE IN MY HEART I'M SURE I HEARD
RING AROUND THE ROSIE, POCKET FULL OF DREAM AND POSIES
PATTY-CAKE, A BAKER'S MAN, TAG YOU'RE IT, KICK THE CAN
MAMA FLASHED THE PORCH LIGHT FOR ME, GOTTA GO
MAN I LOVE HER SO
WHEN LOVE IS WRONG, IT DIES, AND THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES
BUT WHEN IT'S RIGHT, YOU KNOW LOVE GROWS
LAURA JEAN WAS BORN IN TENNESSEE
THAT'S A COMMON LITTLE MIRACLE I KNOW
BUT FOR ME AND BECKY-LYNN SHE'S THE DREAM THAT STARTED WHEN WE
FELL IN LOVE SO MANY YEARS AGOSINGIN'
RING AROUND THE ROSIE, POCKET FULL OF DREAMS AND POSIES
PATTYCAKE, A BAKER'S MAN, TAG YOU'RE IT, KICK THE CAN
I THINK I HEAR YOUR MAMA CALLIN, GOTTA GO
OH MAN I LOVE HER SO
