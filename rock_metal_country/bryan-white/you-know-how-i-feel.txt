HAVE YOU EVER HAD ONE OF THOSE DAYS
WHEN YOU REALLY NEED A FRIEND
THE DAY DRAGS ON AND ON
AND YOU THINK THERE'S NO END
THEN YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL
HAVE YOU EVER HAD ONE OF THOSE NIGHTS
WHEN YOU JUST LIE AWAKE
STARIN AT THE CEILING
UNTIL THE DAWN BREAKS
THEN YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL
CHORUS:
IF YOU'VE HEARD GOODBYE
AND SOMETHING INSIDE JUST WON'T HEAL
IF A MEMORY WON'T SET YOU FREE
AND YOU KNOW THAT IT NEVER WILL
THEN YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL
CHORUS
THEN YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL
