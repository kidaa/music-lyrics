SHE CRIES JUST A LITTLE WHEN SHE SEES HIM WALK AWAY
AFTER ALL, SHE CAN'T SEE IT ANY OTHER WAY
AND IT'S HARD WHEN YOU'RE FEELIN' LIKE THERE'S NOTHIN LEFT TO LOSE
NO SHE CAN'T HELP IT, SHE SEES NO EXCUSE
CHORUS:
THERE'S NO GOOD IN HER GOODBYE
THERE'S NO TEARS SHE HASN'T CRIED
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH
SHE NEEDS NOTHIN' LESS THAN LOVE
DON'T SAY THE SACRIFICE IS SMALL
AND NO ONE EVER HAS IT ALL
WHEN ALL SHE WANTS
IS NOTHIN' LESS THAN LOVE
YOU CAN STAND IN THE MIDDLE AND SEE IT EITHER WAY
THAT'S JUST HOW IT IS, NO ONE EVER WANTS THE BLAME
SO SHE'LL PICK UP THE PIECES AND PRETEND SHE JUST CAN'T SEE
CAUSE ALL SHE'S LOOKING FOR IS SOME ROOM TO BREATHE
CHORUS
SHE KNOWS BETTER THAN TO WAIT
JUST KEEP WAITING UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE
CHORUS
THERE'S NO GOOD IN HER GOODBYE
WHEN ALL SHE WANTS
IS NOTHIN LESS THAN LOVE
DON'T SAY THE SACRIFICE IS SMALL
AND NO ONE EVER HAS IT ALL
WHEN ALL SHE WANTS
IS NOTHIN LESS THAN LOVE
