ALONE AGAIN TONIGHT
WITHOUT SOMEONE TO LOVE
THE STARS ARE SHINING BRIGHT
SO ONE MORE WISH GOES UP
OH I WISH I MAY
AND I WISH WITH ALL MY MIGHT
FOR THE LOVE I'M DREAMING OF
AND MISSING IN MY LIFE
YOU'D THINK THAT I COULD FIND
A TRUE LOVE OF MY OWN
IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME
TO PEOPLE THAT I KNOW
THEIR WISHES ALL COME TRUE
SO I'VE GOT TO BELIEVE
THERE'S STILL SOMEONE OUT THERE WHO
IT MEANT FOR ONLY ME
CHORUS:
I GUESS I MUST BE WISHIN 
ON SOMEONE ELSE'S STAR
IT SEEMS LIKE SOMEONE ELSE
KEEPS GETTIN' WHAT I'M WISHIN FOR
WHY CAN'T I BE AS LUCKY AS THOSE OTHER PEOPLE ARE
I GUESS I MUST BE WISHIN
ON SOMEONE ELSE'S STAR
I SIT HERE IN THE DARK
AND STARE UP AT THE SKY
BUT I CAN'T GIVE MY HEART
ONE GOOD REASON WHY
EVERYWHERE I LOOK
IT'S LOVERS THAT I SEE
SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE'S IN LOVE
WITH EVERYONE BUT ME
CHORUS
WHY CAN'T I BE AS LUCKY 
AS THOSE OTHER PEOPLE ARE
OH I GUESS I MUST BE WISHIN 
ON SOMEONE ELSE'S STAR
