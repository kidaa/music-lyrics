I'M SITTING HERE INSIDE THIS STRANGER'S PLACE
AND TIME IS RACING BY
I'VE BEEN WAY OUT HERE FOR A MONTH OR MORE
TONIGHT I'M WONDERIN' WHY
YOU TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE THINGS THAT I FEEL
MAYBE THIS TIME I'LL FIND AWAY TO EXPLAIN IT
CAUSE THERE IS A DREAM DEEP INSIDE MY HEAD
AND IT MAY SEEM LIKE IT'S BREAKING THE THREAD
THAT HOLDS ME TO YOU
STILL YOU HAVE NEVER WANTED TO CHANGE ME
BUT DARLING I KNOW THOUGH WE'RE FAR APART
THE SIGNAL IS STRONG
THIS HELPLESS HEART WILL ALWAYS BELONG TO YOU... TO YOU
THIS POWER TAKES ME FROM THE PLACE I BELONG
TO WHERE ONLY THE STRONG GET THROUGH
YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP ON BELIEVING OR YOU'LL LOSE YOUR WAY
CAUSE IT SLIPS RIGHT OUT OF VIEW
THOUGH THERE ARE DAYS THE LIGHT CAN FLICKER AND FADE
HERE IN THIS PLACE TONIGHT A FIRE IS BURNING
CAUSE THERE IS A DREAM DEEP INSIDE MY HEAD
AND IT MAY SEEM LIKE IT'S BREAKING THE THREAD
THAT HOLDS ME TO YOU
STILL YOU HAVE NEVER WANTED TO CHANGE ME
BUT BELIEVE ME I KNOW THOUGH WE'RE FAR APART
THE SIGNAL IS STRONG
THIS HELPLESS HEART WILL ALWAYS BELONG TO YOU
THIS HELPLESS HEART WILL ALWAYS BELONG TO YOU
WILL ALWAYS BELONG TO YOU
TO YOU
ONLY TO YOU
TO YOU
