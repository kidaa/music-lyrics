I USED TO SING TO HER
IT USED TO MAKE HER SMILE
SHE KNEW ALL THE WORDS
FOR A WHILE
I SANG LOVE ME TENDER
ALWAYS AND FOREVER
HOLD ME BABY ALL NIGHT LONG
I COULD GO ON AND ON
BUT THAT'S ANOTHER SONG
WE USED TO GO FOR WALKS
ON A COUNTRY ROAD LIKE THIS
IT'S FUNNY ALL THE SMALL
THINGS YOU MISS
LIKE PUTTIN' PENNIES ON A TRAIN TRACK
THE WAY YOU BRUSHED YOUR HAIR BACK
THE SUN ON YOUR FACE
I WISH I WERE THERE TODAY
BUT THAT'S ANOTHER PLACE
OH, THE WAY I USED TO HOLD HER
THE THINGS I SHOULD'VE TOLD HER
IF I COULD MAKE THE CLOCK UNWIND
BACK TO WHEN SHE WAS MINE
BUT THAT'S ANOTHER TIME
REPEAT CHORUS
I COULD GO ON AND ON AND ON
BUT THAT'S ANOTHER SONG
