STRAIGHT OUT OF SOME STORY
YOU WALKED IN, IN ALL YOUR GLORY
I THOUGHT YOU WERE PERFECT FOR ME
I WAS OUT OF MY MIND
LOOKED LIKE I WAS WINNING
IT WAS THE BEST LOVE I'D EVER BEEN IN
JUST WHEN WE WERE BEGINNING
THE END-YOU LEFT ME BEHIND
AND I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO A HAPPY ENDING
SO MUCH FOR PRETENDING
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER
THAN TO THINK OF HAPPY EVER
AFTER-YOU AND ME TOGETHER
I WAS OUT OF MY LEAGUE
I KEPT MY HEART HIDDEN
AND NOW I'M WISHING THAT I DIDN'T
OH WHO AM I KIDDING
YOU WEREN'T EVEN INTRIGUED
AND I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO A HAPPY ENDING
SO MUCH FOR PRETENDING
IT COULD HAVE BEEN BEAUTIFUL
IF I'D ONLY MET YOU
IF I'D ONLY LET YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU MEANT TO ME
AND IF I COULD I WOULD
GIVE YOU A DEMONSTRATION
OF HOW MY IMAGINATION
THOUGHT IT OUGHT TO BE
SO MUCH FOR PRETENDING
OOH YEAH, PRETENDING...PRETENDING
SO MUCH FOR PRETENDING
