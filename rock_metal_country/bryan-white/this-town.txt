THIS TOWN DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
TWO PEOPLE MAKIN' DREAMS AND PLANS
THEY SAY WE'RE MUCH TOO YOUNG
IN THIS TOWN
THIS TOWN'S FULL OF NARROW MINDS
CAN'T SEE BEYOND THE CITY LIMIT SIGNS
THEY CLOSE THE BEDROOM BLINDS
IN THIS TOWN
I'VE DONE SOME THINKIN'
AND I REALIZE
THERE'S MORE THAN DAIRY QUEEN AND FRIDAY NIGHTS
WHILE WE'RE STILL YOUNG, WE'VE GOTTA GET AWAY
TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE OUR BREAK
CHORUS:
FROM THIS TOWN
WORD'LL GET AROUND
TWO RENEGADES ESCAPED
NO THEY COULDN'T KEEP US DOWN
AND THIS TOWN
WILL BE A DIME STORE MEMORY
BABY I JUST KNOW IT
THERE'S A BETTER PLACE TO BE
THAN THIS TOWN
OH THIS TOWN
NOW THIS TOWN'S GOT A FACTORY
NOT MUCH FUTURE HERE FOR YOU AND ME
IT'S AS FAR AS THEY CAN SEE
IN THIS TOWN
I'VE HEARD THE WIND BLOWIN' AT MY DOOR
VOICES TELLIN ME THERE'S SO MUCH MORE
IT'S EASY TO GET BORED
IN THIS TOWN
I'VE JUST GOT TO SEE THOSE THOSE CITY LIGHTS
IT'S TIME WE SPREAD OUR WINGS AND LEARN TO FLY
THEY'LL NEVER CATCH US IF WE DISAPPEAR
OH THE INTERSTATE IS MUCH TO NEAR
CHORUS:
CAN'T YOU JUST HEAR THEM TALKIN'
THEIR RIGHTEOUS WORDS
BURNIN' DOWN THE WIRE
WHAT DO WE CARE WHAT THEY THINK NOW
THINKIN'S NOT ALLOWED... IN THIS TOWN
CHORUS
THIS TOWN
THIS TOWN
