LOVE BREATHES WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF BREATH
LOVE SITS BY THE BED SIDE
WHEN YOU'RE NEAR TO DEATH
AND LOVE STILL FEELS IT
WHEN THE FEELING IS GONE
LOVE LIVES, ON AND ON
CHORUS:
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY
LOVE IS THE RIGHT PLACE
TOOK ME A WHILE TOOK ME A WHILE
TO GET IT STRAIGHT
NOW I WANT TO STAY
EVERYDAY OF MY LIFE I REALIZE
THAT I'M IN THE RIGHT PLACE
LOVE IS THE RIGHT PLACE
LOVE IT MOVES IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS
LIKE A MIST ON THE RIVER
AT THE BREAK OF DAY
SO PULL OPEN THE SHUTTERS
SING A MORNING SONG
LOVE MOVES ON AND ON
REPEAT CHORUS
WHERE YOU ARE, NEAR OR FAR
SUN AND MOON, MOON AND STARS
I KNOW, I KNOW
REPEAT CHORUS
