UNBELIEVABLE
DESCRIBES YOUR SMILE SO SWEET
INCONCEIVABLE
THAT YOU'RE A PART OF ME
THE INNOCENT LOOK IN YOUR EYES
LOVE WITHOUT COMPROMISE FOR ME
IT'S A MYSTERY
CHORUS:
WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE YOU
ONLY GOD'S HAND COULD HAVE MADE YOU
AND BROUGHT THIS DREAM TO LIFE
ALWAYS SWORE THAT I WOULD NEVER FALL
I GUESS MIRACLES HAPPEN AFTER ALL
AND WHAT DID I EVER DO TO DESERVE YOU
UNCONVENTIONAL
IT DESCRIBES MY LOVE FOR YOU
UNCONDITIONAL
CAUSE THERE'S NOTHING I WON'T DO
I PRAY AS THIS FEELING GROWS
THAT YOU'LL ALWAYS TOUCH THE HEART AND 
SOUL OF ME
IT'S A MYSTERY
REPEAT CHORUS
BRIDGE:
I'VE WAITED ALL MY LIFE
TO HOLD SUCH A TREASURE
WHAT IS THIS FEELING WORTH
THERE'S NO MEASURE
WHAT DID I DO
YOU BROUGHT THIS DREAM
ALWAYS SWORE THAT I WOULD NEVER FALL
I GUESS MIRACLES HAPPEN AFTER ALL
AND WHAT DID I EVER DO TO DESERVE YOU
TO DESERVE YOU
TO DESERVE YOU
