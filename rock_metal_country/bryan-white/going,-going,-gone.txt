AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS THE MOONLIGHT SHINING THROUGH THE MIST
CAUSE AFTER ALL A KISS IS JUST A KISS OR SO I THOUGHT
BUT I MUST HAVE BEEN WRONG
IT COULD HAVE BEEN THE MUSIC CAUSE IT SOUNDED SO SWEET
SOMETHING SURE WAS SWEEPING ME OFF MY FEET
ALL NIGHT LONG, IT SURE WAS STRONG
BEFORE I KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON, I WAS GOING , GOING, GONE
I SUPPOSE IT COULD HAVE BEEN THE PERFUME FROM A HONEYSUCKLE VINE
SOMETHING SURE WAS DRIVING ME OUT OF MY MIND
BUT I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ALL ALONG
IT WAS YOUR LOVE AND IT WAS STRONG
AND NOW I'M GOING, GOING, GONE
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE MAGIC WRITTEN IN THE STARS
SOME GYPSY MIGHT HAVE READ IT SOMEWHERE IN THE CARDS
IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER CAUSE WHATEVER IT WAS
IT LED ME STRAIGHT TO YOUR ARMS
FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS THE MOONLIGHT SHINING THROUGH THE MIST
AFTER ALL A KISS IS JUST A KISS OR SO I THOUGHT SO I THOUGHT
BUT I MUST HAVE BEEN WRONG
BEFORE I KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON
I WAS GOING, GOING, GONE
GOING, GOING, GONE
GOING, GOING, GONE
