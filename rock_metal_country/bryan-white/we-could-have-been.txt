TODAY AT WORK
I OVERHEARD A NAME
I KNEW IT WASN'T YOURS
BUT IT TOUCHED ME JUST THE SAME
IT FELT SO GOOD TO HAVE YOU IN MY MIND
I GUESS I'M THE SENTIMENTAL KIND
CHORUS: OH, I WONDER WHO YOU BECAME
DID YOU CHANGE THE WORLD
OR PLAY THE GAME
WE CAME SO CLOSE TO LOVE BACK THEN
WE COULD HAVE BEEN
YOU WERE SO BRAVE
WHEN I WAS SKY
I MADE YOU LAUGH
WHEN SOMETHING MADE YOU CRY
AND I DON'T THINK WE EVER SAID GOOD-BYE
NOW I'LL ALWAYS WONDER WHY
REPEAT CHORUS
BRIDGE:
A TIME OR TWO
I THOUGHT ABOUT CALLING
BUT SOMETHING ALWAYS GETS IN THE WAY
MAYBE I'M AFRAID YOU'D REALLY ANSWER
WHAT WOULD I SAY TO YOU?
REPEAT CHORUS
WE COULD HAVE BEEN
