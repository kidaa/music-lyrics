I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT I'VE FOUND YOU
FATE DID A NUMBER ON ME
IF YOU END UP WITH MY ARMS AROUND YOU
IT'S MEANT TO BE
WELL, MAYBE MY CRAZY IS SHOWING
BUT MAYBE I'M HOOKED ON YOUR TOUCH
BUT WHEREVER MY LIFE IS GOING
THERE AIN'T NO RUSH'CAUSE
CHORUS:
WHEREVER YOU'RE GOING
I'D LIKE TO GO TOO
IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING 
BETTER TO DO
I'D LOVE TO SPEND 
SOME MORE TIME TOGETHER
SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING
BETWEEN NOW AND FOREVER
I'LL TAKE THE BLUE WITH THE GRAY DAYS
I JUST PRAY THE ROAD WILL BE LONG
'CAUSE IF I'M BESIDE YOU THERE'S NO WAY
I CAN GO WRONG
REPEAT CHORUS
I'D LOVE TO SPEND
SOME MORE TIME TOGETHER
SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING 
BETWEEN NOW AND FOREVER
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
BETWEEN NOW AND FOREVER
