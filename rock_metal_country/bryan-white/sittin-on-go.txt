I'M WAITING ON THE GREEN LIGHT TO MAKE YOU MINE
BUT YOUR HEART'S JUST TAKING ITS OWN SWEET TIME
YOU WANT TO BE SURE IF YOU'LL SINK OR SWIM
WELL, GRAB A HOLD OF ME AND JUST JUMP ON IN
YOU'RE PLAYIN IT SAFE
BUT BABY I'LL WAIT
CHORUS:
OOH, WHENEVER YOU'RE READY
I COULD BE YOURS IN A SECOND OR SO
OOH, BABY COME AND GET ME
MY HEART'S SITTIN' ON GO
OOH, ITS OFF TO THE RACES
ALL YOU'VE GOTTA DO IS LET ME KNOW
OOH, I'M READY AND WAITING
MY HEART'S SITTIN' ON GO
YOU OUGHTA GIVE IN INSTEAD OF RESISTING
CAUSE I'M NOT ABOVE A LITTLE ARM TWISTING
I'M BETTING IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE YOU AND ME ARE STANDING AT THE FINISH LINE
YOU'RE HAVING YOUR DOUBTS
BUT YOU'LL COME AROUND
REPEAT CHORUS
YOU'RE PLAYIN IT SAFE
BUT, BABY I'LL WAIT
REPEAT CHORUS
MY HEARTS SITTIN ON GO
MY HEARTS SITTIN ON GO
