I KNOW THE DAMAGE THAT HE'S DONE
I KNOW THE DAMAGE THAT HE'LL DO
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU KNOCK ON MY DOOR
I'LL ALWAYS OPEN IT TO YOU
THERE IS A TIME, THERE IS A PLACE
BUT IT'S NOT HERE AND NOW'S NOT SAFE
THIS IS A FIGHT THAT'S YOURS AND HIS
LEAVE MY HEART OUT OF THIS
CHORUS: LEAVE MY HEART OUT OF THIS
YOU'RE TOO MUCH TO RESIST
I DON' T HAVE THE STRENGTH TO PULL AWAY
NO IS GETTING HARD FOR ME TO SAY
I'D LOVE TO BE THE WAY YOUR HEARTACHE ENDS
BUT TILL IT DOES WE CAN'T BE MORE THAN FRIENDS
I'M ONLY TRYING TO DO WHAT'S BEST
IT'S GONNA HURT YOU MORE UNLESS
YOU LEAVE MY HEART OUT OF THIS
RIGHT NOW CONFUSED IS HOW YOU FEEL
AFRAID TO FACE THIS ON YOUR OWN
I KNOW THE WAY YOU HURT TO HEAL
AND I KNOW THE EMPTY OF ALONE
SO TAKE MY SHOULDER, TAKE MY HAND
TAKE WHAT YOU NEED, I'LL UNDERSTAND
JUST DON'T TAKE MORE THAN I CAN GIVE
LEAVE MY HEART OUT OF THIS
REPEAT CHORUS
