I'D BE FOOLIN MYSELF, THINKIN I'VE GOT IT MADE
I JUST CAN'T ASSUME TRUE LOVE WON'T FADE
I'LL KEEP ON LISTENIN' TO HER, SAY I'M
GLAD THAT I FOUND HER
KEEP ON SHOWIN' HER HOW MY WORLD
TURNS AROUND HER
'CAUSE
CHORUS:
ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT
SHE COULD WALK AWAY
SHE WON'T BE MINE FOR THE TAKIN
AND THAT'S THE PRICE THAT I'D PAY
'CAUSE LOVE'S EVER CHANGIN'
AND IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE
TEARDROPS COULD FALL
AND I COULD LOSE IT ALL
ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT
SHE'S THE SENSITIVE KIND, SHE NEEDS A CONNECTION
AND I CANNOT BE SO BLIND TO LOSE MY DIRECTION
I'LL KEEP ON WALKIN' THAT MILE, SHOW
HER HOW FAR I'LL GO
KEEP ON LETTING HER HEAR ALL SHE NEEDS TO KNOW
REPEAT CHORUS
TEARDROPS COULD FALL
AND I COULD LOSE IT ALL
ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT
