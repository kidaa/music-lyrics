HE'S STANDING AT THE FRONT DOOR
WITH HER SUITCASE IN HER HAND
I'M STARING DOWN THE HALLWAY
FROZEN WHERE I STAND
SHE SAYS SHE DOESN'T LOVE ME ANYMORE
OH LORD WHAT CAN I DO
IT'S GONNA TAKE A MIRACLE TO MAKE HER STAY
THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING YOU
CHORUS: SO, PLEASE DON'T YOU HAVE A MIRACLE JUST
LYING AROUND
ONE SMALL MIRACLE NOBODY NEEDS
SEND IT ON DOWN
I'LL NEVER MAKE IT THROUGH THIS NIGHT
THINKING SHE'S WITH SOMEONE
PLEASE DON'T YOU HAVE JUST ONE SMALL MIRACLE LEFT
I KNOW I HAVEN'T BEEN A SAINT
AND ASKING YOU FOR ANYTHING TAKES NERVE
CAUSE YOU'VE ALREADY BLESSED ME
WITH SO MUCH MORE IN LIFE THAN I DESERVE
BUT IF YOU CAN MAKE A BLIND MAN SEE
AND CHANGE WATER INTO WINE
SURELY YOU CAN KEEP HER FROM
TEARING OUT
THIS OLE HEART OF MINE
REPEAT CHORUS
PLEASE DON'T YOU HAVE JUST ONE SMALL MIRACLE LEFT
