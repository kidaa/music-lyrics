TOMMY STILL DRIVES THAT OL' PICKUP TRUCK
HE HAD BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL
HE SAYS HE WON'T TRADE IT IN
'CAUSE THEY DON'T MAKE 'EM LIKE THEY USED TO
HIS WIFE DONNA'S GOT A PICTURE OF ELVIS
BY THE CLOCK IN THE KITCHEN
HER HAIR AND CLOTHES COME BACK IN STYLE
EVERY NOW AND THEN
THEY MADE A PROMISE ON THEIR WEDDING DAY
NOTHIN'S GONNA TAKE THIS FEELING AWAY
CHORUS:
LET THE WORLD TURN
LET THE YEARS DRIFT BY
THE FIRE WILL BURN
IN THEIR HEARTS JUST AS BRIGHT
TIME MAY TAKE ITS TOLL
BUT THEIR LOVE WON'T GROW OLD
AND IF THEY LIVE TO BE A HUNDRED AND ONE
THEY'RE STILL GONNA DIE YOUNG
TOMMY SPENT YEARS FIXIN' WHEELS AND BRAKES
AT THE TEXACO ON THE HIGHWAY
DONNA KEPT THE KIDS AND DID PERMANENT WAVES
AT THE BEAUTY SHOP ON FRIDAYS
IT'S BEEN FORTY YEARS BUT WHO'D EVER KNOW
BY THE WAY THEY CARRY ON
JUST THE SAME TWO KIDS AS MUCH IN LOVE
AS THE DAY THEY MARRIED ON
THEY MADE A PROMISE ON THEIR WEDDING DAY
NOTHIN'S GONNA TAKE THIS FEELING AWAY
REPEAT CHORUS
GONNA DIE YOUNG
REPEATS 3 TIMES
THEY'RE STILL GONNA DIE YOUNG
