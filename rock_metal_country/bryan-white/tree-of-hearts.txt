ON A TREE INSIDE A HEART
A DULL BOY SCOUT KNIFE TOOK
HALF A DAY TO CARVE
MICHAEL LOVES CAROLINE
HE'D JUST TURNED TEN AND SHE WAS NINE
THE SUMMER SHE TURNED SWEET SIXTEEN
HE FINALLY FOUND HIS NERVE AND TOOK
HER OUT TO SEE
AND WHAT SHE SAW THROUGH HER TEARS
WAS SEVEN HEARTS FOR SEVEN YEARS
CHORUS: AND THEY STOOD BENEATH THE TREE OF HEARTS
AND THEY WATCHED THEIR FEELINGS GROW
AND THEY SWORE THEY'D NEVER BE APART
TRUE LOVE LEFT IT'S MARK
ON THE TREE OF HEARTS
THE TENTH TIME HE CARVED THEIR NAMES
CAROLINE'S DAD WAS GIVING HER AWAY
THERE BENEATH THE SHELTER OF
THE TREE OF HEARTS THEY PLEDGED
THEIR LOVE
AND THEN FOUR HEARTS DOWN THE ROAD
THEY BROUGHT THE FIRST OF TWO BORN HOME
CHORUS: AND THEY PLAYED BENEATH THE TREE OF HEARTS
AND THEY WATCHED THEIR CHILDREN GROW
AND THEY SWORE THEY'D NEVER BE APART
TRUE LOVE LEFT IT'S MARK
ON THE TREE OF HEARTS
BRIDGE: IN THE BLINKING OF AN EYE
SOMEHOW FIFTY-SEVEN HEARTS FLEW BY
FIFTY-EIGHT, FIFTY-NINE
SIXTY HE MISSED CAROLINE
AT SIXTY-ONE MICHAEL KNEW
THERE WOULDN'T BE A SIXTY-TWO
CHORUS: NOW THEY LAY BENEATH THE TREE OF HEARTS
AN YOU CAN WATCH THEIR LOVE STILL GROW
WHERE THEY SWORE THEY'D NEVER BE APART
TRUE LOVE LEFT ITS MARK
ON MY TREE OF HEARTS
