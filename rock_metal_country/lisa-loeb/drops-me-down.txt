I walked away to get wisdom 
But in the end I just walked home 
And it drops me, drops me down 
And I'm not feeling so good again 

It was the same song and it's making me sad 
Cause I think that it's happened 
And it hasn't been had 
And it drops me, drops me down 
And I'm not feeling so good again 

And I'm injured again 
Yeah it's sick and I'm sucked in 
Yeah I'm at it again 
It's sick and I'm sucked in 
It's sick and I'm sucked in 

Cause I had some things so dear 
Slip away and leave me here 
And it drops me, drops me down 
And I'm not feeling so good again 
Yeah, it drops me, drops me down 
And I'm not feeling so good again
