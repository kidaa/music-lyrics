They pull up their chairs to the table 
She stares at the food on her plate 
At the toast and the butter 
Her father, her mother, she pushes away 

And they rise in the morning 
And they sleep in the dark 
And even though nobody's looking 
She's falling apart 

She gets home from school too early 
And closes the door to her room 
There's nothing inside her 
She's weak and she's tired of feeling like this 

And they rise in the morning 
And they sleep in the dark 
And even though nobody's looking 
She's falling apart 

They call her for dinner, she makes up a reason 
She looks at her arms and she rolls down her sleeves 
And her mother is starting to see through her lies 
And last night her father had tears in his eyes 

And they rise in the morning 
And they sleep in the dark 
And even though nobody's looking 
She's falling apart 

And we rise in the morning 
And we sleep in the dark 
And even though nobody's looking 
She's falling apart
