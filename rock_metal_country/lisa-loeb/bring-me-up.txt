I was quiet, and I was tired. and I wanted you to bring me up.
I wanted you to make it stop, yeah I wanted you to bring me up.
You were wrong, and I was right. and I wanted you to bring me up.
Hmmm you know me well, this is something that I shouldn't have to tell you.
We've shared humility and orange roses.
And poking fun at all our friends
They had their barbecues, we have our arguments.
We never can agree. 
You said, "when you don't talk you take it out on me." 
I was quiet, I was tired. and I wanted you to bring me up.
I wanted you to make it stop, yeah I wanted you to bring me up.
And you were wrong and I was right. and I wanted you to bring me up.
Hmmm you know me well, this is something that I shouldn't have to tell you.
We took a ride, on a motorbike. I couldn't talk to you, but my arms
Were wrapped around you tight. we stopped at Smokey's,
We parked the bike outside. 
So scared to be sad, to keep the tears in 
And I looked up at the sky and took another ride.
I was quiet, and I was tired. and I wanted you to bring me up.
I wanted you to make it stop, yeah I wanted you to bring me up.
And you were wrong and I was right. and I wanted you to bring me up.
Hmmm you know me well.
We had us, is that enough and what is it worth to you
We had us, is that enough and what is it worth to you
You said "it's worth everything and baby take a look, 
It's worth all the pennies in my pocket."
But I was quiet, and I was tired. and I wanted you to bring me up.
I wanted you to make it stop, yeah I wanted you to bring me up.
I was quiet, and I was tired. and I wanted you to bring me up.
Hmmm you know me well, this is something that I shouldn't 
Have to tell you. 
I was quiet, and I was tired. and I wanted you to bring me up 
I wanted you to make it stop, yeah I wanted you to bring me up.
So I was wrong and you were right.
Bring me home..
