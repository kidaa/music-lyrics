I like you. but I am the underdog, I am the last in line. 
Don't be the enemy, don't stand in back of me.

I wouldn't know, 'cause I am the underdog.
I am the last in line. 
Don't be the enemy, don't stand in back of me.
Will you be my friend 
Now I understand, that I more than like you.
I am the underdog I am the last in line. 
Don't be the enemy, don't stand in back of me.
Lalala da-dah
I am the underdog. I am the last in line. 
Don't be the enemy, don't stand in back of me.
I am the underdog. I am the last in line. 
Don't be the enemy, don't be the enemy.

I like things that are so good, you are so so good.
