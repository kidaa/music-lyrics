She's got a boyfriend
All of a sudden
She's never had one before
She's looking for the thumbs-up
When they're walking through the door

She's showing him off
By making him talk
She's putting his hand in his pocket
It shows on her face
What she doesn't say
What she doesn't say

[Chorus]
You don't know me
You don't know me at all
You don't know me
You don't know me at all
You don't know me
You don't know me at all

She doesn't know that we know
That we've been here before
We always pay attention
When she walks through the door
It's the clothes that she chooses
It's the words that she uses

[Chorus]

She's trying hard to pretend
That it's not really happening
But we can see her smiling from afar 
We don't see her much anymore
But we can hear her whistling
As she walks to her car

[Chorus]
