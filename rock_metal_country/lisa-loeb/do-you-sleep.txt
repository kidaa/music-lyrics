do you eat, sleep, do you breathe me anymore
do you sleep, do you count sheep anymore
do you sleep anymore

do you take plight on my tongue like lead
do you fall gracefully into bed anymore

i saw you as you walked across my room.
you looked out the window, you looked at the moon.
and you sat on the corner of my bed, and
you smoked with the ghost in the back of my head.

i don't know, and i don't care
if i ever will see you again.
i don't know, and i don't care
if i ever will be there.

do you eat, sleep, do you breathe me anymore
do you sleep, do you keep me anymore

you kick my foot under the table,
i kick you back;
i can't say i'm able to
stand for you or
fall for you ever again.
wish for a perfect setting
wishing that i am letting you
take me where you want me
all over again
you can't give yourself absolutely to someone else.

i don't know, and i don't care
if i ever will see you again.
i don't know, and i don't care
if i ever will be there.

i saw you as you walked across my room.
you looked out the window, you looked at the moon.
and you sat on the corner of my bed, and
you smoked with the ghost in the back of my head.

do you eat, sleep, do you breathe me anymore
do you sleep, do you count sheep anymore
do you sleep anymore

i don't know, and i don't care if i ever will be there.
