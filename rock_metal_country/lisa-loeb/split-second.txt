i did not want to be stuck
one second longer than i had to be there,
stuck inside the door.

i'm always scared i'll slam my fingers in the door
because the last time that i left
i slammed my fingers in the door.

when you want to get out,
you get up, and walk straight to the door.
not stop and think about it,
thinking that one second longer
that a car could hit me in it
if i thought more than i did.
