waiting for wednesday, my stomach doesn't hurt enough,
pain always is the sign.
waiting for wednesday, no proof of mine exists,
so l don't have to take it back.

don't want to show you good-bye.
show you good-bye.
show you good-bye.
show you good-bye.

but you're waiting for wednesday.
waiting for wednesday.
waiting for wednesday, i pray you'll put me on the spot.
i do believe you, that you'll love me that you'll leave me.

what will i do when you come near to me
you'll put me on the spot.
you've been doing this a long, long time,
not that you're better than me,
but that you do it a lot.

Now i'm waiting for wednesday,
waiting for wednesday,
waiting for wednesday,
waiting for wednesday.

i'm gonna show you good-bye,
show you good-bye,
show you good-bye,
show you good-bye.

now I'm waiting for wednesday,
you're back from out of town,
the west is dry, your mind is clear,
and i don't want to be here,
i don't want to be here,
i don't want to be here,
to show you good-bye.

and i'm waiting for wednesday, to show you good-bye.
