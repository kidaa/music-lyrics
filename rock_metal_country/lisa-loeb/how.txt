i didn't come this far for you to make this hard for me.
and now you want to ask me "how"
it's like - how does your heart beat, and why do you breathe
how does your heart beat, and why do you breathe

why did you come here
you weren't invited.
and you're on the outside - stay on the outside.
and now you want to ask me "why"
it's like - why does your heart beat, and how do you cry
how does your heart beat

and there are some things that i'd like to figure out.
there are some things that i can do without -
like you and your letters that go on forever,
and you, and the people that were never friends.

with all the things that you could be,
you never could learn how to be me.
and now you want to ask me "how"
it's like - how does your heart beat, and why do you breathe
how does you heart beat, and why do you breathe
