i told you i was sorry, i told you i was wrong,
i said it was an accident and don't tell anyone.

but you love to circle round and round, you're so misunderstood.
yeah, you love to circle round and round & you know that we should
forget about it -

let's forget about it

you lied about how much you knew, i thought you were my friend.
you lied upon the mattress, c'mon tell me where you've been.
you lied about this night apart, you lied about the room.
if you're gonna have to lie to me then

let's forget about it
let's forget about it

i'll stop crying on the mountain that we made
from the molehill where we spilt the milk.

so you say this never happened, perhaps not the way i thought.
did i throw this out of focus - or was it just the way we fought
that it seemed to me you took this girl, but you swear to God it's not.

let's forget about it
let's forget about it

i'll stop crying, if you'll stop.
i'll stop crying, if you'll stop.
i'll stop crying, if you'll stop lying to me.
