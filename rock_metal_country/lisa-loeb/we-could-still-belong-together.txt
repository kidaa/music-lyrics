If I hold my breath
If I shut my eyes
If I disappear
Just for the afternoon

If I can't help shouting
If I lock you out
If it's not important
Completely unimportant
To anyone else but me

[Chorus]
We could still belong together
And together is much better
We're okay so hey don't worry now
Oh wow

If I interrupt and 
If I cut you off and
If I like attention
Other worse things I could mention

[Chorus x 2]

But if you make a mistake
We're through

[Chorus x 2]

Oh wow.

Yes I complicated I know
It's just my way but
If is a question
That I ask and nothing more.
