when all the stars were falling,
i reached up like you said.
all the stars were falling, one hit me in the head,
and i fell down, down, down.
i fell down, down.

when all the stars were falling,
they fell from above,
and i thought of hate, and i thought of hate,
and then i thought of love.
and i fell down, down, down,
i fell down, down.

and i've learned how to dance from a vincent van gogh,
and the nights were wrapped in a white sheet,
and now no one even says hello,
'cause i couldn't stand on my two feet.
i fell down,
i fell down.

now the peace you will find, in your own you have found,
the lights of the city are the stars on the ground.
"i may not be a quaalude living in a speed zone,"
but i could be restful, i could be someone's home,
if i fell down,
and i fell down, down.

now all the stars have fallen.
