i want to be by myself, sometimes i do.
i don't want to be left behind, but sometimes i'm left by you.

i press my tongue to the top of my mouth,
'cause my jaw, it was tired with the thinking.
i stretched my toes to the end of the couch,
'cause my back, it was aching from sleeping.

so what is this weather, and what is this darkness,
and why do i feel so alone
when will it snow, it's been raining for hours,
and why do i feel so alone

and when i'm left at home, when you're with someone else i'm all alone.

you do not cheat me of my childhood.
you bring me blankets for the walls of my forts.
there is no anger with the eyebrow raised.
when you do the fantastic i am amazed.

so what is this weather, and what is this darkness,
and why do i feel so alone
when will it snow, it's been raining for hours,
and why do i feel so alone

you were leaving some bar, and you're coming downtown,
you're not ripping out stitches, but you want me around.
just to call you my love, just to call you my love.

you are the treasure custodian cleaning the moon for me.
scouring the sky so the stars would shine bright.
you stand straight-faced, and tip-toed on top of a ladder,
and wait.

and when i'm left at home, i'm all alone.
but i'd rather be alone with you.

so what is this weather, and what is this darkness,
and why do i feel so alone
when will it snow, it's been raining for hours,
why do i feel so alone
