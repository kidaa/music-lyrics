Turn up the record barely 
I won't let you sit lonely 
Play the second note gently 
Before the first disappears 
Insomniac trends 
The night never ends 
Sweep the dimes off the bookshelves 
Draw the shades down dim 
Go out to the desert, abandon it all 
Insomniac trends 
The night never ends 
Turn the record barely 
I won't let you sit lonely 
Pull the shades down slowly 
Before the light reappears 
The night never ends
