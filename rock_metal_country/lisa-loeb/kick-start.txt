We need a kick start 
We need a quick solution 
We need a next step 
If we're really going 
If we're really going 

We sit on our couch 
While we watch our TV 
And the phone doesn't ring 
And it's perfect 

To be here playing house 
Is no comfort to me 
It's just more of the same 
Again and again and again 

We need a kick start 
We need a quick solution 
We need a next step 
If we're really going 
If we're really going 

Trying so hard 
To dig ourselves out 
Cause we're stuck and we're scared 
And we're thinking 
Things have to change 
It's the thoughts that don't count 
Can something be done? 
Don't let this decision drag on 

We need a kick start 
We need a quick solution 
We need a next step 
If we're really going 
If we're really going 

We need a big push 
To reach the right conclusion 
So we can get there 
If we're really going 
If we're really going 
Let's go. 

We need a quick solution 
We need a next step 
To reach the right conclusion 
We need a kick start 
We need a kick start
