Come back home where the three orange suns 
They set in the bottom of the globe yeah now. 
Come back home where the three purple moons 
They set in the bottom of the water yeah now. 
You know that I've been there, and 
I think you should beware; that 
You know they all had faces too, 
Like me. 
Now Hadrian's wall, will not return, 
It's crumbled to the land of nowhere; 
No one sees it, no one hears it anymore. 
And it scrapes my hands across the pavement, 
Just to think about it, 
Like the world around you does. 
And you put on your crown, and your emeralds, and your rubies, 
And you but on your crown. 
Yeah, you put on your crown, and your emeralds and your rubies 
But you can't run away like Dorothy and her dog. 
Put on your crown, and your emeralds, and your rubies, 
And you put on your crown. 
Yeah, you put on your crown, and your emeralds and your rubies 
But you can't run away just to come back. 
Come back. 
Come back home 
Where the blue lights glow, and 
The red ones glow 'til tomorrow yeah now. 
Come back home 
Where the three purple moons 
They set in the bottom of the water yeah now. 
You know that I've been there, and 
I think you should beware; that 
You know they all had faces too, 
Like me. 
When the wrinkles in your wrist are yelling, 
"It won't hurt a bit!" 
But you know it will, 
'Cause tears and excuses wipe you off your feet 
Yeah tears and excuses wipe you off your feet 
Like the world around you does. 
And it wipes you off your feet, like the world around you does. 
And it scrapes you hands across the pavement, 
Like the world around you does. 
And you wish the world would, 
Yeah you wish the world would change. 
And you wish the world would, 
Yeah you wish the world would change. 
Change.
Change.
Now Hadrian's wall, will not return, 
It's crumbled to the land of nowhere; 
No one sees it, no one hears it anymore. 
And it scrapes my hands across the pavement, 
Just to think about it, 
Like the world around you does. 
And you put on your crown, and your emeralds, and your rubies, 
And you but on your crown. 
Yeah, you put on your crown, and your emeralds and your rubies 
But you can't run away like Dorothy and her dog. 
Put on your crown, and your emeralds, and your rubies, 
Put on your crown. 
And you put on your crown, and your emeralds and your rubies 
But you can't run away just to come back. 
Come back. 
Come back.
