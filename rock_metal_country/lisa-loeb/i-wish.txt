I wish for a place where the earth doesn't shake 
If the earth won't be still, then I will 
And my friends can be my family 
And they can be my company 
And I'll take them to a party and we'll have fun 
Can you tell me if I'm near to anywhere but here 
I wish for a place where it's not such a waste 
I can tell the girls my name 
It's okay although it's plain 
Can you tell me if I'm near to anywhere but here 
If I could sleep, then I could dream of what you promised me 
And everything would seem better than it is 
I wish for a place that I could go 
Cause everything here moves so slow 
Can you tell me if I'm near to anywhere but here 
I wish for a place where the earth doesn't shake 
If the earth won't be still then you and I will 
Can you tell me if I'm near to anywhere but here
