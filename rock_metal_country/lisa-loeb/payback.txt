Is this how it ends, laying in bed
Talking to a cheap tape recorder instead of my friends
In bed with a low grade fever, they wanted to know how could I leave you. 
 I can't tell them that. it might sound like revenge.  
Some things don't need a payback. some things are sure, some things 
You can't feel safe about. where do I start?  
I was waiting for my head to clear up. I thought I was smart  
I'd find the answers in time.  
But the answers I find, aren't what you want to hear. they're not even close.  
Some things don't need a payback. some things are sure
Some things you can' t feel safe about. 
Some things don't need a clear up.  
You got that? 
 I remember good things like the van breaking down.  
I sat on your lap in the auto repair and you touched my hair.  
While the heavy drops rain on the pavement outside.  
Don't take revenge. just let it lie. 
The easiest thing, is if you just let it die.  
Don't give me a chance. You don't owe me that.  
Don't follow me out, I'll think your coming for some payback  
Some things don't need a payback. some things are sure
Some things you can't feel safe about. 
Some things don't need a clear up. You got that?  
Why did I leave? How long did it take? It could take forever  
Some things don't need a payback  
You got that, you got that?
