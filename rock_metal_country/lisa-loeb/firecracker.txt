you want to suffer and show me you're angry.
fight with your fists up or call for your mommy.
you want to suffer and show me you're angry.
spend time alone, find a stick in the basement.
drink water and gold dust and live on impatience.
slaughtered for weakness, electric like static.
slaughtered, you're weak - there's no need to speak.

you change your shoelaces.
i light firecrackers.
you step on the sparks.
you change your shoelaces.
i light firecrackers.

i shouldn't be any great inspiration,
i never got in your way.
i should never have to chase you.
you were the one who ran away.

if you could feel the pain your confusion has caused me
you would have stopped before you spoke.
listening to lies, the pain doesn't suit me.
the gift that you gave me, i put it away.
i couldn't look at it, it made me think of you.
you get in the way.

you change your shoelaces.
i light firecrackers.
you step on the sparks.
you change your shoelaces.
i light firecrackers.

spend time alone, find a stick in the basement.
drink water and gold dust and die of impatience.
electric like static, and no need to speak.
it's not right, but it's not wrong.
so I wrote this song.
i wrote this song - is that what you want
you got what you want - does it make you feel better
with a smirk on your face and a gun at my head,
you come to my place and ask to be fed.

you change your shoelaces.
i light firecrackers.
you get in the way.

you get in the way.

you want to suffer and show me you're angry.
fight with your fists up or call for your mommy.
you want to suffer and show me you're angry.
