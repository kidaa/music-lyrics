Who do you think you are
You're talking so loud
You bury the sound
Of your heart that's singing out

And where do you want to be
On top of the world
But you're just a girl
Who forgot what it's like to dream

Leave everything behind
But you're so tired 
One day you might open up your eyes and find

[Chorus]
What you've got isn't what you wanted
What you need just happens to be
What you've got isn't what you wanted
What you need just happens to be
Someone you should know

You try to hide between the lines
Of a story never told
But I've seen you run away
You're afraid of the fall
The weight of it all is too much

But you might change your mind
If you'd stand up one day
You might open up your eyes and find

[Chorus]

La da da da... [x5]

How do you keep it up
It's all just a front
A dangerous stunt
You're gonna come down soon enough

Open up your eyes
Don't be scared 
You might find you had it all the time

What you've got is what you wanted
What you need just happens to be
What you tried so hard to hide
It was there between the lines
Of the story never told
Of someone you should know

What you've got is what you wanted
What you need just happens to be
Someone you should know
What you've got is what you wanted
What you need just happens to be
Someone you should know
