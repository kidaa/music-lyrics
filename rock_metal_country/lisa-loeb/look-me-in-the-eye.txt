Have you ever looked me in the eye?  
Have you ever told the truth  
Come on don't lie  
Have you ever tried to know me better?  
Better than you do  

Bitch and moan  
Away from home  
I sit and stare stare  
At the phone  
Do you wait for it to ring?  
Do you wait for it to ring?  
Come on tell me the truth  
Is that your thing?  

Come on look me in the eye 
Tell the truth 
Come on don't lie 
Have you ever tried to know me better? 
Better than you do 

Do you demand a single thing?  
I feel so selfish even asking  
Do you know what I mean?  
Do you know what I'm asking?  
Oh won't you lavish me  
Be fancy  

Come on look me in the eye 
Tell the truth 
Come on don't lie 
Have you ever tried to treat me better? 
Better than you do 

Look me in the eye  
Look me in the eye  

I can't believe I am surprised  
After all this time  
I think you'd know my eyes  
Never thought of myself as a bleeder  
But I leech on to you  
What could be sweeter?  
Pie, of course  
But what could be worse?  

That you don't look me in the eye  
Look me in the eye  
Look me in the eye  
Look me in the eye
