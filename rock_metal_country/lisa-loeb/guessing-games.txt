I could be trembling when I talk to you. 
I could be making up all sorts of things that are not true. 
I could tell a half truth, but I cannot tell a lie. 
I could tell a story that is ten feet high. 
My stomach flutters, and I feel sometimes ashamed, 
I'm a castle with broken shutters, and this is not a guessing game. 
Oh, I could make a plea so that you and I could be we, 
I could say, "Oh, it's a must that you and I should be us," 
And all the answers I would guess and you would be so, so impressed, 
But I would never get a "yes," cause I have not the guts to guess. 
My stomach flutters, and I feel sometimes ashamed, 
I'm a castle with broken shutters, and this is not a guessing game. 
I could be listening, but this is not a guessing game. 
I'd guess all the answers, but this is not the same. 
I could be trembling, oh, I could be afraid, 
I could be wallowing, wallowing when y'all think I've got it made.
