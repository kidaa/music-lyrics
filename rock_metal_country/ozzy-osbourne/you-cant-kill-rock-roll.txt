How many times
Can they fill me with lies
And I listen again
Twisting the truth
And they're playin' around with my head, O.K.
The things they will do and the things they will say
But they don't really understand
Tears fill my eyes when I hear all the cries
For the reason today

And they don't really know even what they're talkin' about
And I can't image what empty heads can achieve
Leave me alone, don't want your promises no more
'Cos rock  amp; roll is my religion and my law
Won't ever change, may think it's strange
You can't kill rock  amp; roll, it's here to stay

Lookin' through eyes of time
Mirrors reflecting their stories untrue
Promises, promises
Telling me all of my glories overdue
How many times have I heard it before
And I'll probably hear it again
King of a thousand knights, pawn in a table light
Losing to you

And they don't really know even what they're talkin' about
And I can't image what empty heads can achieve
Leave me alone, don't want your promises no more
'Cos rock  amp; roll is my religion and my law
Won't ever change, may think it's strange
You can't kill rock  amp; roll, it's here to stay

Even the rhymes that they
Give me in times of confession ain't true
Outcome is obvious
All for them, none for us
Meaning you too
The things they will do and the things they will say
When they don't really understand
Fear of rejection, I need their protection
I'm making a stand

'Cos they don't really know even what they're talkin' about
And I can't image what empty heads can achieve
Leave me alone, don't want your promises no more
'Cos rock  amp; roll is my religion and my law
Won't ever change, may think it's strange
You can't kill rock  amp; roll, it's here to stay

Leave me alone, don't want your promises no more
'Cos rock  amp; roll is my religion and my law
Won't ever change, may think it's strange
I'm born to rock  amp; roll, I'm here to stay, yeah
