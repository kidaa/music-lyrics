[Kelly]
I feel unhappy, I am so sad, 
I lost the best friend that I ever had 

[Ozzy]
She is my baby, I loved her so, 
But it's too late now, I've let her go 

[Both]
We going through changes 
We going through changes 

[Kelly]
We shared the years, we shared each day 
I love you, dad, but I found my way

[Ozzy] 
You know the world is an evil place 
My baby is grow now, she'll find her way

[Both]
We going through changes 
We going through changes 

[Kelly]
It took so long to realize
And I can still hear his last goodbye 

[Ozzy]
Now all my days are filled with tears, 
Wish I could go back and change these years 

[Both]
We going through changes 
We going through changes 
We going through changes
Changes
Changes
Changes
