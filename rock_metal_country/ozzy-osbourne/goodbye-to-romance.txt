Yesterday has been and gone 
Tomorrow will I find the sun 
or will it rain 
Everybody's having fun 
Except me I'm the lonely one 
I live in shame 

chorus
I said goodbye to romance, yeah 
Goodbye to friends, I tell you 
Goodbye to all the past 
I guess that we'll meet, 
we'll meet in the end 
I've been the king, I've been the clown 
now broken wings can't hold me down 
I'm free again 
The jester with the broken crown 
It won't be me this time around 
to love in vain 

repeat chorus 

and I feel the time is right 
although I know that you just might say to me 
what you gonna do 
what you gonna do 
But I have to check this chance 
goodbye to friends and to romance 
And to all of you 
And to all of you 
Come'on now! 

repeat chorus 

and the winter is looking fine 
and I think the sun will shine again 
and I feel I've cleaned my mind 
all the past is left behind again 

repeat chorus
