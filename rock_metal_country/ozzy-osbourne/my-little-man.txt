Don't you know I love you more than life itself 
Don't you know that you're my pride 
And I would not have you walking through this world 
Without me by your side 

Go to sleep my little man 
Don't you weep my little man 

I'd like to keep you with me all your life 
But I know I can't do that 
So I must try teaching you the wrong from right 
To keep the vulture from your back 

And when you're dreaming 
You can talk to angels 
So wipe the tears from your eyes 
And if there's demons that try to steal your breath away 
You can't believe that know my spirit will be standing by your side 

You saved me 
You gave me 
The greatest gift of all 
Believe me 
Believe me 
There ain't no mountain that's too tall 

I will gladly carry your cross for you 
To take your pain away 
But what I can't carry is my love for you 
Beyond my dying day
