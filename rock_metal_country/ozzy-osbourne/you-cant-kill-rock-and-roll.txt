How many times can they fill me with lies and I listen, again 
Twisting the truth and they're playin' around with my head O.K. 
The things they will do and the things they will say 
When they don't really understand 
Tears fill my eyes when I hear all the cries 
For the reason today. 

And they don't really know even what they're talkin' about 
And I can't imagine what empty heads can achieve. 

Leave me alone don't want your promises no more 
'Cause rock'n'roll is my religion and my law 
Won't ever change, may think it's strange 
You can't kill rock'n'roll it's here to stay. 

Looking through eyes of time mirrors reflecting their stories untrue 
Promises promises, telling me all of my glories overdue. 
How many times have I heard it before 
And I'll probably hear it again 
King of a thousand knights, pawn in a table fight Losing to you. 

And they don't really know even what they're talkin' about 
And I can't imagine what empty heads can achieve. 
Leave me alone don't want your promises no more 
'Cause rock'n'roll is my religion and my law 
Won't ever change, may think it's strange 
You can't kill rock'n'roll it's here to stay. 

Even the rhymes that they give me in times of confession ain't true 
Outcome is obvious all for them none for us meaning you too. 
The things they will do and the things they will say 
When they don't really understand. 
Fear of rejection I need their protection 
I'm making a stand. 

And they don't really know even what they're talkin' about 
And I can't imagine what empty heads can achieve. 

Leave me alone don't want your promises no more 
'Cause rock'n'roll is my religion and my law 
Won't ever change, may think it's strange 
You can't kill rock'n'roll it's here to stay. 

Leave me alone don't want your promises no more 
'Cause rock'n'roll is my religion and my law 
Won't ever change, may think it's strange 
You can't kill rock'n'roll it's here to stay.
