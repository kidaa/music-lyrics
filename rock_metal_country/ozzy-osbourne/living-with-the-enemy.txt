I gave you all that you wanted 
and still you come back for more 
You say that you're brokenhearted 
but then you walk out the door 

Maybe it is time for us to say goodbye 
Where are the tears you never cried? 
Hey baby what you got on your mind 
are you looking for some sympathy? 

I can tell you if it's a truth or a lie 
'Cos it's just like living, 
living with the enemy 

You got me going in circles, 
I'm slowly loosing my head 
What did I do to deserve this, 
you make me wish I was dead 

Tell me I'm wrong and I'll be on my way 
See you around another day 
Hey baby what you doin' tonite? 
Are you giving me the perfect dream 

I'm so tired and I don't wanna fight 
'Cos it's just like living, 
living with the enemy, enemy 
Living with the enemy, living with the enemy, enemy 
Living with the enemy,enemy 
Living with the enemy, living with the enemy, enemy
