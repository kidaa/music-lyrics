Spiders in the night 
Creeping round the walls 
Now you'll feel him crawling over you 
Creepy crawly things 

Filling up your bed 
Soon you'll feel him crawling through your brain 

You think he's there 
Beware his bite 
But when you look 
The spiders not in sight 

Spiders reappear 
Taking people's names 
Everything is taken down in sane 

There's no way out 
And there's no key 
But here's a clue 
The spider's really me 

You're written in his book 
The spiders won't forget 
You won't forget the spiders in the night 

You think he's gone 
You think he's dead 
There's no escape 
The spiders in your head
