I'm looking for a miracle man 
That tells me no lies 
I'm looking for a miracle man 
Who's not in disguise 
I don't know where he'll come from 
And I don't know where he's been 
But it's not our Jimmy Sinner 
Because he's so obscene 
Miracle man 
Got busted 
Today I saw a miracle man 
On TV cryin' 
Such a hypocritical man 
Born again dying 
He don't know where he's going 
But we know where he's been 
It was our little Jimmy Sinner 
On the screen 
A devil with a crucifix 
Brimstone and fire 
He needs another carnal fix 
To take him higher and higher 
Now Jimmy he got busted 
With his pants down 
Repent ye wretched sinners 
Self righteous clown
