Wine is fine 
But whiskey's quicker 
suicide is slow with liquor 
Take a bottle drain your sorrows 
Then it floods away tomorrow 

Evil thoughts and evil doings 
Cold, alone you hang in ruins 
Thought you'd escape the reaper 
You can't escape the master keeper 

'Cause you feel life's unreal and you're living a lie 
Such a shame who's to blame and you're wondering why 
Then you ask from your cask is there life after birth 
What you saw can mean hell on this earth 
hell on this earth 

Now you live inside a bottle 
The reaper's travelling at full throttle 
It's catching you but you don't see 
The reaper is you and the reaper is me 

Breaking laws, knocking doors 
But there's no one at home 
Made your bed, rest your head 
But you lie there and moan 
Where to hide, suicide is the only way out 
Don't you know what it's really about 

Wine is fine 
But whiskey's quicker 
Suicide is slow with liquor 
Take a bottle drown your sorrows 
Then it floods away tomorrow
