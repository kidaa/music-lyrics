Well I know I could be just another stranger 
But to you I guess I'm just another fool 
And you swear You like to live your life in danger 
Then you hide behind a wall of silly lies 
Nobody thinks the way I do 
I guess that nobody dares 
Your head's so full of things 
So set your mind free of them 
I'm breaking the rules 
Did you know that in the truth 
There's nothing stranger 
I suppose you think I know it all 
Nobody hears the things I say 
I guess nobody cares 
My head's so full of things 
I set my mind free of them 
I'm breaking the rules 
Breaking all the rules 
Can't you see they're nothing without you 
Empty head full of fools 
Now you see I'm breakin' all the rules 
Breakin' all the rules 
Well I know 
That you would love to go to heaven 
But you know 
You're just too afraid to die 
And I know 
That you would love to know the answers 
But to you 
The truth is just another lie
