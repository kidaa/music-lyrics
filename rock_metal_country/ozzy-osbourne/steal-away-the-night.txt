Now I feel the time is right 
Love will flow like wine tonight 
Give your love and it will come to you 
If you feel that you and me 
Could escape and hold the key 
To a paradise that's true and free 

Steal away, steal away 
Steal away - the night 

Now I've met your honesty 
You are here and I am free 
Broken chains have fallen all around 

Point my finger at the fools 
Broken chains and broken rules 
Let it be rebellion rules tonight 

Steal away, steal away 
Steal away - the night 

Can it be a dream come true 
Now that I am here with you 
Tearful eyes of joy is something new 

Runaway with me tonight 
Dream the dream, light the light 
Happiness is what you give to me 

Steal away, steal away 
Steal away - the night
