Alright now!
Try it out!

When I first met you didn't realize
I can't forget you or your surprise
You introduced me to my mind
And left me wanting you and your kind

Oh yeah Babe!

Come on now - try it out

My life was empty forever on a down
Until you took me showed me around
My life is free now, my life is clear
I love you sweet leaf - though you can't hear

Oh yeah Babe!

Come on now - try it out

Straight people don't know what you're about
They put you down and shut you out
You gave to me a new belief
And soon the world will love you sweet leaf

Oh yeah Babe!

Try it out!
All right! Oh yeah!
I want to die with the sweet leaf
Oh yeah! All right now!
Try it out!
I love you sweet leaf
Oh yeah!
