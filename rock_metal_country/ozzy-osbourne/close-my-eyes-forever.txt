Baby, I get so scared inside, 
And I don't really understand, 
Is it love that's on my mind,or is it fantasy 
Heaven, 
Is in the palm of my hand, 
and it's waiting here for you, 
What am I supposed to do with a childhood tragedy 

Chorus
If I close my eyes forever 
Will it all remain unchanged 
If I close my eyes forever 
Will it all remain the same... 

Sometimes, it's hard to hold on 
So hard to hold on to my dreams 
It isn't always what is seems 
When you're face to face with me 
You're like a dagger 
And stick me in the heart 
And taste the blood from my blade 
And when we sleep, would you shelter me 
In your warm and darkened grave 

repeat chorus 

Will you ever take me 
No, I just can't take the pain 
But would you ever trust me 
No, I'll never feel the same... 
Ohh...
I know I've been so hard to you 
I know I've told you lies 
If I could have just one more wish 
I'd wipe the cobwebs from my eyes 

back to chorus 

Close your eyes 
Close your eyes 
You gotta close you eyes for me
