All these tears I cry 
Don't you wonder why 
Is it all a dream? 
Never what it seems 

Get under my skin 
Should I let you in? 
Don't you think it's bad 
To give me something that I've never had 

Every word I say 
Everytime I pray 
Look into my eyes 
Distant voices cry 
Is the light in me 
Tell me what you see 
You weren't what I had

Can't get something that I've never had 
Can't get something that I've never had 

Should I think tomorrow? 
Ohhhh
Should I live for just today? 
Take the light that burns inside you 
Let it burn away 
Let it burn away 
Let it burn away 

Will I see the day? 
Will I have to pay? 
What's inside of me? 
You will never see 

Won't you let me in? 
Don't you let me see? 
Do you think I'm mad? 
Cause I want something that I've never had 
Cause I want something that I've never had 

Give me something that I've never had 
Give me something that I've never had
