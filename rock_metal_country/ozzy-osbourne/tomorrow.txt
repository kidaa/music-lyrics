Have you read the message 
The writing on the wall 
Could it be the answer 
The answer to it all 
What's going Heaven 
I'm playing with your head 
Don't believe them when they tell you 
You'd be better off dead 

Living in the thunder 
Driving me insane 
Can I get a witness to take away the pain 
Walking on the water 
Going nowhere fast 
Feeling like I'm walking with no shoes on broken glass 

You know it 

You don't have to leave the lights on 
I'm so used to being blind 
No more goodbyes or yesterdays
So it's I'll see you tomorrow 
I'll see you tomorrow

Welcome to the sideshow 
I'll cut it to the chase 
Yeah I can hear you thinking 
It's going all to waste 
I don't mean to offend you 
When I look in the eyes 
What's all this commotion? 
It leaves me mystified 

Chasing all the rainbows 
Falling from the sky 
I know your intentions 
Are all a bunch of lies 
I'm running out of patience 
Falling off track 
You better start to worry 'cause I may not make it back 

All right now 

Living in the big house 
Dying by the rail 
If I wanted your opinion 
I'd call you up in Hell 
Could that be the mailman 
Knockin' on the door 
Or just another lightweight 
Finally evening the score?
