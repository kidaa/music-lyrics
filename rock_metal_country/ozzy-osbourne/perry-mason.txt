On his way to dinner when 
It took him by surprise 
And with one pull of the trigger 
He would vanish overnight 

Dancing by the roadside 
Holding on for dear life 
Then a gun from out of nowhere 
Made a widow of his wife 

I don't mind single file down 
The runway 
Feelin' fine and I'll see you 
My friend 
Over and Over again 

Who can we get on the case? 
We need Perry Mason 
Someone to put you in place 
Calling Perry Mason again 

Riding painted horses, oh the 
Kids they love it so 
You can see it on their faces 
How they love the wind to blow 

Minding my own business 
Like my mama always said 
But if I don't try to help'um 
They could wind up on the front page 

Wake me when it's over tell me 
It's all right 
Just keep on talking baby, I've 
Been doing this all night 
How much did you give me, tell 
Me it'll be all right
