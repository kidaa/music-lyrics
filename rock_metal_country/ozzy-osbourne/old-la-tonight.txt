Look into the future look into my eyes and tell me 
Everything's all right 
Tell me where we're going 
I'm so afraid 'cos I don't know what's going on 
With my life 

But it'll be alright tonight 
Will it be alright tonight? 
Are we doin' alright in old L.A. tonight? 

Sitting by the ocean 
Mapping out my plan of action 
Baby they include you 
I wish you'd send a message 
Maybe I'm just better off not knowing 
Who knew 

Those summer nights 
When I look in your eyes 
I'm falling to pieces pieces 
Out of my mind 
And I'll never know why 
I'm falling to pieces pieces 

Who could imagine such a thing could happen to you? 
It's gonna be alright in old L.A.
