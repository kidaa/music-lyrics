How many times can you put me down 
'Till in your heart you realize
If you chose to criticise you choose your enemies

Everything that I say and do
In your eyes is always wrong
Tell me where do I belong in a sick society

Your're no different to me, yeah
Your're no different, no different to me

Look at yourself instead o' looking at me
With accusation in your eyes
Do you want me crucified for my profanity

Concealing your crimes behind a grandeur of lies
Tell me where do I begin
If you think you're without sin be the first to cast the stone

Your're no different to me, yeah
Your're no different, no different to me
Your're no different to me, yeah
Your're no different, no different to me

Can't you see, can't you see
Your're no different to me
Won't you see, won't you see
You're no different to me

Living my life in a way that I choose
You say I should apologize
Is that envy in your eyes reflecting jealousy

Tell me the truth and I'll admit to my guilt
If you'll try and understand
Is that blood that's on your hand from your democrocy

Your're no different to me, yeah
Your're no different, no different to me
Your're no different to me, yeah
Your're no different, no different to me
