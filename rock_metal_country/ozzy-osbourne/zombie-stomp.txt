I don't need no doctor 
But I need something to kill the pain 
Don't know what I'm after 
But the pressure's driving me insane 

Searching for a different ride 
Had a funny feeling I can't hide 
Hey, hey do the zombie stomp 
Why can't they just let me be 
Alone without the misery 
Hey, hey do the zombie stomp 

Flirting with disaster 
Morning after killing me again 
Hiding from the laughter 
And the demons dancing round my brain 

Always dancing on thin ice 
I guess I'll have to pay the price 
Thinking how it could have been 
If I had never let them in 

Take me to the doctor 
'Cause I feel it coming on again 
Don't know where I'm going 
'Cause I guess I don't know where I've been
