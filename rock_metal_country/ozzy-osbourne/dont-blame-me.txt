Everybody knows all the highs and all the lows 
And in that nothing ever goes right 
It's not up to me if you look but you don't see 
What could obviously be alright 

Like goin' nowhere 
Like goin' nowhere baby 
Nowhere baby 
Like goin' nowhere, like goin' nowhere 

It's a vision, not religion 
And the truth is plain to see 
It's a feeling, it's revealing 
Nowhere you can hide 
So don't blame me 

There's no guarantee, what you get is what you see 
Don't try to find it, just don't try 
Don't try living in the past if you want your dreams to last 
Don't hide behind the mask of lies 

Like goin' nowhere 
Like goin' nowhere baby 
Nowhere baby 
Like goin' nowhere, like goin' nowhere 

It's a vision, not religion 
And the truth is plain to see 
It's a feeling, it's revealing 
So don't blame me 
Don't blame me 
Don't blame me 
Don't blame me 

Deep inside of me lives a hunger to be free 
I know I'll have to pay the price 
I may never know when it comes or when it goes 
I guess it's just a part of life
