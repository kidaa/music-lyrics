Crazy...babies...
Crazy babies never say die 
Born to live on a permanent high 
Flying high above the world below 
They'd better come down soon or everyone will know 
Nobody's gonna change them, change them 
They've gone over the top 
Nobody's gonna tame them, tame them 
They're never gonna stop 
Walk that walk 
Talk that talk 
Crazy...babies...
When they were born they were born to be wild 
Some say I'm another devil's child 
Crazy babies in a world of their own 
I am a crazy babe you better leave me alone tonight 
No use talking bout if they'll last 
Where they're going or about their past 
They're just the result of our society 
So frustrated just like you and me
