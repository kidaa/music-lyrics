I'm sick and tired of your excuses 
Can't deal with living anymore 
I'll give you reasons to continue while 
You lie writhing on the floor 
I'll wash away the lives 
And have you hypnotized
There'll be no compromise today 
I'll share your life of shame 
I think you know my name 
I'll introduce myself today 
I'm the demon alcohol 
The demon alcohol 
I'll get you 
If you could deal with your reflection 
I'm sure you'd see into my eyes 
There'll be no need for resurrection
Let's drink to people of the lies 
I'm sick and tired of resolutions 
You've quit me time and time again 
Don't speak of suicide solutions 
You took my hand I'm here to stay 
This time it's you or me 
I'll never set you free 
There'll be no compromise today
