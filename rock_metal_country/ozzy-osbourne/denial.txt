You are my only daughter 
I guess I made you twice 
You look inside my other 
He'll give you bad advice 

I will tell you I'm OK 
But deep inside I'm afraid 

I don't drink Holy water 
I'm not the son of Christ 
I ain't no black messiah 
And I don't load my dice 

You can tell me you're all right 
But why are you so afraid? 

You're in denial 
You never will believe it's you 
Denial, you always hide behind the truth 
You'll never believe it 
You never believe it's you 

I don't think I'm amazing 
In fact I'm quite insane 
To live inside my bucket 
With all my plastic chains 

People tell me every time 
I look at the wrong all right 

Secrets told to you, dreamland 
Holds you secrets told you 
You wouldn't believe it 
You couldn't conceive it 
Secrets told you....... 
You wanna receive it 
You gotta believe it's you 

You're on a trip already 
I'm tripping out alright 
I'll get there slow and steady 
Just sit and hold on tight
