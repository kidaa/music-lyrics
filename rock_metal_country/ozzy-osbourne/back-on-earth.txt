I have fallen from grace and my ashes are scattered 
No longer a passion and flesh 
My flame is alive though my wings have been shattered 
They lay my body to rest 

My spirit is breathing my senses are pure 
Like reincarnation my soul will endure 
Ohhhh

Back on earth 
Back on earth 
Back on earth 
The spirit - it never lets go 

Like fountains of sorrow the faces are crying 
I'm witnessing all of their pain 
Death is so final for only the living 
The spirit will always remain 

Bury me deep just to cover my sins 
My soul is redeemed as the journey begins 
Ohhh

Back on earth 
you feel me 
Back on earth 
reveal me 
Back on earth 
The spirit it never lets go 

Another dimension, a river of light 
I'm twisting,I'm turning, my soul is in flight 
Ohhhhh
Ohhhhh

Back on earth 
you feel me 
Back on earth 
reveal me 
Back on earth 
still breathing 
Back on earth 
re-living
