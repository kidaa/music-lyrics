Won't you listen 'cos I'm at it again 
Lightning striking and on that you can depend 
They say that lightning never strikers the same place twice 
Gods of thunder sit and watch the event 
You know I take no prisoners 
My back's to the wall 
You know I must be going 
When destiny calls 
Until I feel that thunder shattering my brain 
I won't stop 

Rockin' all night rockin' all night 
Until the lightning strikes again 
Rockin' all night rockin' all night 
Until the lightning strikes again 

Tell your mama that you're gonna be late 
But not to worry we'll just be rockin' all night 
The lightning strikes before 
You hear the thunder roar 
We're becoming the children of the night 

I'm not apologizing 
I am what I am 
There is no compromising 
I don't give a damn 
Until I feel the thunder boiling in my veins 
I won't stop 

Rockin' all night rockin' all night 
Until the lightning strikes again 
Rockin' all night rockin' all night 
Until the lightning strikes again 

Oh no I've lost control 
Here we got it's only rock 'n roll 

The silver light is flashing 
As all turns to gold 
In my head voices screaming 
And I'm being told 
If you will only listen you will hear them too 
I won't stop 

Rockin' all night rockin' all night 
Until the lightning strikes again 
Rockin' all night rockin' all night 
Until the lightning strikes again
