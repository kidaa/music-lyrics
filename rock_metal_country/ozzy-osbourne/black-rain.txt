The black rain is falling
Contaminating the ground
The human race is dying
The dead are scattered around
What is the price of a bullet?
Another hole in the head
A flag draped over a coffin
Another soldier is dead

How many victims have fallen
How many more have to die
People dying in masses
Angel of death standing by

We've got our marching orders
Defenders of our home and our pride
We've crossed too many borders
Military suicide

War killing sons and daughters
Another failed attack
There is no turning back
Blood running down like water
You'll think you got away
Until the judgment day comes

Politicians confuse me
I watch the body count rise
Why are the children all marching
Into the desert to die?
The human psyche is twisted
The madness rising again
Another empire falling
I watch them dying in vain

We've got our marching orders
Defenders of our home and our pride
We've crossed too many borders
Military suicide

War killing sons and daughters
Another failed attack
There is no turning back
Blood running down like water
You'll think you got away
Until the judgment day comes

Are you ready?

Black rain, black rain
Black rain, black rain

War killing sons and daughters
Another failed attack
There is no turning back
Blood running down like water
You'll think you got away
Until the judgment day
You'll think you got away
Until your judgment day comes
