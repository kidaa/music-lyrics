Well she's a mean hard woman 
and she knows what she wants 
She is my tatooed rock n roll dancer 
I'm under her thumb 
And when she tells me come 
Oh hi's the only way I can answer 
They're gonna put me away 
Put me away 
God damn them 
Well I can hear her moaning like a dog on heat 
She never takes no for an answer 
She's driving me mad 
She makes it good to be bad 
My little tattooed rock n roll dancer 
Tattooed dancer 
Dance for me bitch 
I think I'm in grave danger 
Goin' over the top 
There is no question 
Only an answer 
She can't give love 
I think I've fallen in lust 
With my tattooed rock n roll dancer
