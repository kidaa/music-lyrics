I don't know what they're talking about
I'll make up my own decisions
This thing that I found ain't gonna bring me down
I'm like a junkie without an addiction

Mama don't cry I just wanna stay high
I like playing with danger and fear
Everybody's walkin' but nobody's talkin'
It looks a lot better from here

All my life I've been over the top
I don't know what I'm doing all I know is I don't wanna stop
All fired up, I'm gonna go 'til I drop
You're either in or in the way, don't make me I don't wanna stop

Why don't they ever listen to me
It's just a one way conversation
Nothing they say is gonna set me free
Don't need no mental masturbation

Too many religions but only one god
I don't need another saviour
Don't try to change my mind
You know I'm one of a kind
Ain't gonna change my bad behaviour

All my life I've been over the top
I don't know what I'm doing all I know is I don't wanna stop
All fired up, I'm gonna go 'til I drop
You're either in or in the way, don't make me I don't wanna stop
All my life I've been over the top
I don't know what I'm doing all I know is I don't wanna stop
All fired up, I'm gonna go 'til I drop
You're either in or in the way, don't make me I don't wanna stop

I don't wanna stop
I don't wanna stop
I don't wanna stop
I don't wanna stop
I don't wanna stop
I don't wanna stop
I don't wanna stop

[SOLO]

All my life I've been over the top
I don't know what I'm doing all I know is I don't wanna stop
All fired up, I'm gonna go 'til I drop
You're either in or in the way, don't make me I don't wanna stop
All my life I've been over the top
I don't know what I'm doing all I know is I don't wanna stop
All fired up, I'm gonna go 'til I drop
You're either in or in the way, don't make me I don't wanna stop
