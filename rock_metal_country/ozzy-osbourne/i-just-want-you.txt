There are no unlockable doors 
There are no unwinnable wars 
There are no unrightable wrongs 
Or unsingable songs 
There are no unbeatable odds 
There are no believable Gods 
There are no unnameable names 
Shall I say it agin? Yeah 
There are no impossible dreams 
There are no invisible seams 
Each night when the day is through 
I don't ask much 

I just want you 
I just want you 

There are no uncriminal crimes 
There are no unrhymeable rhymes 
There are no identical twins or 
Forgiveable sins 
There are no incurable ills 
There are no unkillable thrills 
One thing and you know it's true 
I don't ask much 

I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired 
I used to go to bed so high and wired 
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah 
I think I'll buy myself some plastic water 
I guess I should have married Lennon's daughter 
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah 

There are no unachievable goals 
There are no unsavable souls 
No legitimate kings or queens 
Do you know what I mean? Yeah 
There are no indisputable truths 
And there ain't no fountain of youth 
Each night when the day is through 
I don't ask much
