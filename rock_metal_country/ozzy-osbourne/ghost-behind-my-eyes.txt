There is a person living in my head 
She comes to visit every night in bed 
I fight the demon but it just won't fall 
The voices in my dungeon starting to call 

The spiders dancing on the wall 
Suicide of love we could have had it all 

And it is you 
You are the ghost behind my eyes 
I can't see through you 
You are the ghost behind my eyes 
The ghost that tells me lies 

The princess of the dark has made my mind home 
My haunted head and her won't leave me alone 
She dances on my heart with fire in my soul 
I hate that feeling when I'm losing control 

I wish to God that I could sleep again 
Oh peace again 
And wake up from this nightmare 
Free again Free again 
Oh me again 

There is a woman liveing in my head 
She comes to visit every night in bed
