I met a magic man 
Who had a daughter 
She learned her lessons well 
But still I taught her 
She followed willingly 
As lambs to slaughter 
We shared forbidden fruit 
And things I brought her 

You may say I'm a miracle man again 
Here I come with my mystical plan again 
I know you think I can 
I'm just a man 

I don't walk on water 
Oh no 
I don't walk on water 
Oh no 

I followed willingly 
Her sweet temptation 
She had me hypnotized 
But still I'm waiting 
My drowned and buried dreams? My dromedary dreams? 
As wet as oceans 
We set the bearing seas? With sand dunes bearing seeds? 
She set emotion? She set in motion? 

You may say I'm a cynical charlatan 
There I go with my whimsical ways again 
Although you think I can 
I'm just a man 

That I don't walk on water 
Oh no 
I don't walk on water 
Oh no 
I don't walk on water 
Oh no 
I don't walk on water 
Oh no 

Here's two options for the bridge. 
 Not at all sure which one's right, his voice is all messed up I- 
The light is guiding eyes 
As I look in on you 
And the light is getting shorter 
I suppose I'm you 

II-
Kaleidoscopial eyes 
As you look in the mirror 
And the long is getting shorter 
As the far is now nearer 

Are you just a mirror 
Standing in front of me 
In my mind? Am I blind? 
Can my eyes really see
