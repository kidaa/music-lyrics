Watching time go and feeling belief grow 
Rise above the obstacles. 
People beseech me but they will never teach me 
Things that I already know. I know 

Dreams that I have shattered may not have mattered 
Take another point of view. 
Doubts will arise like though chasing a rainbow 
I can tell a thing or two. That's true 

You've got to believe in yourself or no one 
Will I believe in you 
Imagination like a bird on the wing 
Flying, free for you to useOK baby. 

I can't believe they stop and stare 
And point their fingers doubting me 
Their disbelief suppresses them 
But they're not blind it's just that they won't see. 

I'm a believer, I ain't no deceiver 
Mountains move before my eyes 
Destiny planned out I don't need no handout 
Speculation of the wise.
