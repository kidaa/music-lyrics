A psycho driver twisted in my head 
Silence broken but there's nothing said 
I gotta got a nightmare from a fantasy 
Will the voices ever set me free? 

I can hear'em 
I can hear'em 
Someone wake me when it's over 
I can see'em 
I can see'em 
I can see'em over and over again 

I saw it happening like dja-vu
They tried to tell me but they couldn't get through 
In my head I hear the voices scream 
I need someone to tell me what it means 

Whoa-Who turned off the lights? 
Whoa-A shadow in the night 
Whoa-It wasn't meant to be 
I can't take this alone 
Don't leave me on my own tonight 
Oh no, I can't take it alone 
Don't leave me on my own tonight 

Shattered dreams lay next to broken glass 
I wonder if tonight will be my last 
I need an angel who can rescue me 
To save me from my mental symphony
