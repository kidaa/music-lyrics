Your words, they go right through me
They circle round my head, yeah
I can't believe I'm still here
I know I should be dead, yeah
This desperation makes me feel so filthy
But I know if I don't stop  I won't feel guilty

Take me higher
Crank me faster
Help me get the thrill I'm after

One time to take away all pain
One more to turn myself insane
One shot to keep me high all day
Makes my reality fade away

There is no future waiting
There is no morning after
Can't stop obsessive craving
An itch I just can't scratch, yeah
This paranoia stops my mind from sleeping
I don't know if I'm awake or if I'm dreaming

Take me in
You won't deny me
Spit me out, all bright and shiny

One time to take away all pain
One more to turn myself insane
One shot to keep me high all day
Makes my reality fade away

[SOLO]

One time to take away all pain
One more to turn myself insane
One shot to keep me high all day
Makes my reality fade away
