Voices, A thousand thousand voices 
Whispering, the time has passed for choices 
Golden days are passing over, Yeah 

I can't seem to see you baby 
Although my eyes are open wide 
But I know I'll see you once more 
When I see you, I'll see you on the other side 
Yes I'll see you, I'll see you on the other side 

Leaving, I hate to see you cry 
Grieving, I hate to say goodbye 
Dust and ash forever 

Though I know we must be parted 
As sure as stars are in the sky 
I'm gonna see when it comes to glory 
And I'll see you, I'll see you on the other side 
Yes I'll see you, I'll see you on the other side 

Never thought I'd feel like this 
Strange to be alone Yeah 
But we'll be together 
Carved in stone, carved in stone, carved in stone 

Hold me, hold me tight I'm falling 
Far away, distant voices calling 
I'm so cold I need you darling Yeah 

I was down but now I'm flying 
Straight across the great divide 
I know you're crying 
But I'll stop you crying
