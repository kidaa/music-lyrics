Goin' home, late last night
Yeah Suddenly I got a fright
Yeah I looked through the window and surprised what I saw
Fairy boots were dancin' with a dwarf, all right now!

Yeah Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
Yeah I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies
Yeah Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes, all right now!

Yeah Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
Yeah I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies
Yeah Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes, all right now!

So I went to the doctor, see what he could give me
He said "Son, son, you've gone too far.
'Cause smokin' and trippin' is all that you do."
Yeah!
