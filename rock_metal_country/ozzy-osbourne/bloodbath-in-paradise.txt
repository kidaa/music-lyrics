You're comin' home 
There's blood on the walls 
And Charlie and the family made house calls 
If you're alone 
Then watch what you do 
Cause Charlie and the family might get you 
Can you hear them 
In the darkness 
Helter skelter 
Spiral madness 
Yeah
Bloodbath in paradise 
But there's nowhere you can run to baby 
Bloodbath in paradise 
Forever sleep in paradise 
California sun and you're still in bed 
And the California rain is turning red 
No sign of life 
Or the keeper's of doom 
In Charlie and the Keeper's scarlet room 
They'll summon you 
To wake from the dead 
As you lie bleeding 
Murdered in your bed 
The sweetest dreams 
Are all in your mind 
But no one wakes when Charlie creeps behind 
Yeah
Execution halts your breath 
Helter skelter 
Spiral death
