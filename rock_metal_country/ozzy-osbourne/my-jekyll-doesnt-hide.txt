Condemned to violence 
Arrested by pain 
Inside the soul lies a man insane 
Conceived in anger 
Addicted to hate 
The mutant child of a twisted state 

Beware the contradiction 
Beneath the crimson void 
'Cos in this world of fiction 
My Jekyll doesn't hide 

A killer's smile with a psycho star dream 
Behind the mask things aren't what they seem 
Unholy soldier 
Desciple of sin 
What kind of mind are you living in 

You're preaching revolution 
Don't you mean genocide? 
Behind this resolution 
My Jekyll doesn't hide 

Waiting to die for the very first time 
All right, That's right 
Waiting to die for the very first time 
I don't give a damn 'cos I think it's my time 
My time 

The symbiosis of murder and lies 
What do I see looking through your disguise? 
Fourth reich dementia 
Subversion ideals 
God only knows what your secret conceals 

Who'll be the first offender? 
Who will be victamized? 
In your perverse agenda 
My Jekyll doesn't hide
