She says, What do you call love
        well I call it Harry
        Oh, please I'm being serious
        what do you call love
        Well I don't call it family and I don't call it lust
        and as we all know marriage isn't a must
        And I suppose in the end, it's a matter of trust
        if I had to I'd call love time
        She says, What do you call love
        can't you be more specific
        What do you call love
        is it more than the heart's hieroglyphic
        Well for me time has no meaning, no future, no past
        and when you're in love, you don't have to ask
        There's never enough time to hold love in your grasp
        turning time around
        Turning time around
        that is what love is
        Turning time around
        yes, that is what love is
        My time is your time when you're in love
        and time is what you never have enough of
        You can't see or hold it, it's exactly like love
        Turning time around
        turning time around
        Turning time around
        turning time around
        Turning time around
        well I gotta have it
        I gotta-gotta-gotta have it
        Turning, turning time around
        gotta have it, turning time around
        Turning, turning time around
        turning time around
