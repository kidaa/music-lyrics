Smiles, I was taught never to smile
        I was told the stylish smiles of buffoonery
        chicanery and larceny abound
        My mom said unless someone sticks you right in front of a camera
        a smile is the last thing that you wanna do
        Those smiles, those mirthless toothy smiles
        Smiles, they all smile on TV
        The quizmaster with his withered crones
        the talkshow hosting movie stars, the politician licking feet
        The mugger, the rapist, the arsonic lover
        all smile out from the news, at one time or another
        Those smiles, those garish sickly smiles
        When I was young my mother said to me
        never, ever, let anyone see that you're happy
        Smiles, never, ever let them see you smile
        they'll always put you down
        With those smiles, never, ever let them see you smile
        they'll always put you down
        With your smiles, never, ever let them see you smile
        don't you know they'll make you go
        Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
        doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
        Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
        doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
        Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
        doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
        Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
        doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
