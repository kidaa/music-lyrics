They tied his arms behind his back
        to teach him how to swim
        They put blood in his coffee
        and milk in his gin
        They stood over the soldier
        in the midst of the squalor
        There was war in his body
        and it caused his brain to holler
        Make the sacrifice
        mutilate my face
        If you need someone to kill
        I'm a man without a will
        Wash the razor in the rain
        let me luxuriate in pain
        Please don't set me free
        death means a lot to me
        The pain was lean and it made him scream
        he knew he was alive
        He put a pin through the nipples on his chest
        he thought he was a saint
        I've made love to my mother, killed my father and brother
        what am I to do
        When a sin goes too far, it's like a runaway car
        it cannot be controlled
        Spit upon his face and scream
        there's no Oedipus today
        This is no play you're thinking you are in
        what will you say
        Take the blue mask down from my face
        and look me in the eye
        I get a thrill from punishment
        I've always been that way
        I loathe and despise repentance
        you are permanently stained
        Your weakness buys indifference
        and indiscretion in the streets
        Dirty's what you are and clean is what you're not
        you deserve to be soundly beat
        Make the sacrifice
        take it all the way
        There's no ";won't"; high enough
        to stop this desperate day
        Don't take death away
        cut the finger at the joint
        Cut the stallion at his mount
        and stuff it in his mouth
