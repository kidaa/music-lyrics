It must be nice to be steady, it must be nice to be firm
        it must be nice never to move off the mark
        It must be nice to be dependable and never let anyone down
        it must be great to be all the things you're not
        It must be great to be all the things that I'm not
        I see you in the hospital your humor is intact
        I'm embarrassed by the strength I seem to lack
        If I was in your shoes, so strange that I'm not
        I'd fold up in a minute and a half
        I'd fold up in a minute and a half
        And I didn't get a chance to say goodbye
        No -  I didn't get a chance to say goodbye
        It must be nice to be normal it must be nice to be cold
        it must be nice not to have to go oh up or down
        But me I'm all emotional no matter how I try
        you're gone and I'm still here alive
        You're gone and I'm still here alive
        And I didn't get a chance to say goodbye
        No - I didn't get a chance to say goodbye
        There are things we say we wish we knew and in fact we never do
        but I'd wish I'd known that you were going to die
        Then I wouldn't feel so stupid, such a fool that I didn't call
        and I didn't get a chance to say goodbye
        I didn't get a chance to say goodbye
        No there's no logic to this - who's picked to stay or go
        if you think too hard it only makes you mad
        But your optimism made me think you really had it beat
        so I didn't get a chance to say goodbye
        I didn't get a chance to say goodbye
        No - I didn't get a chance to say goodbye
        I didn't get a chance to say goodbye
