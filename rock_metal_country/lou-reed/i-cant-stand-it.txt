It's hard being a man
        living in a garbage pail
        My landlady called me up, ooohhh
        she tried to hit me with a mop
        I can't stand it anymore more
        I can't stand it anymore more, oh
        I can't stand it anymore more
        But if Candy would just come back
        it'd be all right
        Yeah, if Candy would just come back
        it would be all right, come on baby
        I live with thirteen dead cats
        a purple dog that wears spats
        They're all out livin' in the hall
        and I can't stand it anymore
        I can't stand it anymore more
        I can't stand it anymore more
        I can't stand it anymore more
        But if Candy would just come back
        it'd be all right
        Ooohhh, if Candy would just come back
        it would be all right, be all right now
        Ah, come on baby
        I'm tired of living all alone
        yeah, nobody ever calls me on the phone
        But when, ah, things start getting bad, ah
        I just play my music louder
        I can't stand it anymore more
        I can't stand it anymore more
        I can't stand it anymore more
        I can't stand it, I can't stand it, oh
        I can't stand it, I can't stand it
        I can't stand it, I can't stand it, no
        I can't stand it, I can't stand it, oh
        I can't stand it, I can't stand it
        I can't stand it, I can't stand it
        I can't stand it, I can't stand it
        I can't stand it, I can't stand it
        ...
