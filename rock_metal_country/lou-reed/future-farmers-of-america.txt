Born on a farm in a transatlantic moonlight
        split like a cord of wood my family broke up
        Sold like a piece of steer, a piece of meat, a cow
        a breathing piece of shit
        Picked for my age, for my strength and make up
        called for I was tall, I was big, I could hold up
        A tree or a piece of steel I could do
        what my fat owner can't
        Ah, future farmers of America
        future farmers of America
        Future farmers of America
        Ah
        I'm always watching the way his wife looks me over
        I have a sex twice as big as her husband's
        If I wasn't so large, so strong, so pale
        I'd disappear under a bush
        Colorless men and ladies of the world unite
        kill your master with one cut of your knife
        Kill them during sex, kill them during talk
        kill them whenever you can
        Future farmers of America
        future farmers of America
        Future farmers of America
        These -
        - stupid black owners are foreigners to affairs of the heart
        look at me, I'll never own land that I work on
        Every one of us here shares a surname
        this father must die
        I was born on the dark cusp of twilight
        my father was dark, my mother was light
        Look at me, I'm strong
        I could crush him in my fist
        Ah
        I could crush him in my
        I could crush him in my
        I could crush him in my fist
        I could crush him in my
        I could crush him in my
        I could crush him in my fist
        Future farmers of America
        I could crush him in my fist
        Future farmers of America
        I could crush him in my fist
        Future farmers of America
        I could crush him in my fist
