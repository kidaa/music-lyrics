Maybe I should go and live in Amsterdam
        in a side street near a big canal
        spend my evenings in the Van Gogh Museum
        what a dream, Van Gogh Museum
        Maybe its time to see Tangiers
        a different life-style, some different fears
        and maybe I should be in Edinburgh
        in a kilt in Edinburgh
        Doin' a modern dance
        doin' a modern dance
        Or maybe I should get a farm in southern France
        where the winds are wispy and the villagers dance
        and you and I we'd sleep beneath a moon
        moon in June and sleep till noon
        And maybe you and I could fall in love
        regain the spirit that we once had
        you'd let me hold you and touch the night
        that shines so bright, so bright with fright
        Doin' a modern dance
        doin' a modern dance
        Shit, maybe I could go to Yucatan
        where women are women, a man's a man
        ah, no one confused, ever loses place
        with their place in the human race
        Maybe I'm not cut out for city life
        the smell of exhaust, the smell of strife
        and maybe you don't wanna be a wife
        it's not a life being a wife
        Doin' a modern dance
        doin' a modern dance
        So maybe I should go to Tanganyika
        where the rivers run, down mountains tall and steep
        or go to India to study chants
        and lose romance to a mantra's dance
        I need a guru, I need some law
        explain to me the things we saw
        why it always comes to this
        it's all downhill after the first kiss
        Maybe I should move to Rotterdam
        maybe move to Amsterdam
        I should move to Ireland, Italy, Spain
        Afghanistan where there is no rain
        Or maybe I should just learn a modern dance
        where roles are shifting the modern dance
        you never touch you don't know who you're with
        this week, this month, this time of year
        this week, this month, this time of year
        Doin' a modern dance
        you don't know who you're with modern dance
        I should move to Pakistan, go to Afghanistan
        Dance, you don't know who you're with
        dance, you don't know who you're with
        modern dance
        And maybe you don't wanna be a wife
        it's not life being a wife
        doin' a modern dance
        you never touch you don't know who you're with
        Dance, modern dance
        the roles are shifting dance
        you never touch you don't know who you're with
        Dance, modern dance
        maybe you don't wanna be a wife
        it's not a life being a wife
