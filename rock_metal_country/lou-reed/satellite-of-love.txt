Satellite's gone
        up to the skies
        Thing like that drive me
        out of my mind
        I watched it for a little while
        I like to watch things on TV
        Satellite of love
        satellite of love
        Satellite of love
        satellite of
        Satellite's gone
        way up to Mars
        Soon it will be filled
        with parking cars
        I watch it for a little while
        I love to watch things on TV
        Satellite of love
        satellite of love
        Satellite of love

        with Harry, Mark and John
        Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday to Thursday
        with Harry, Mark and John
