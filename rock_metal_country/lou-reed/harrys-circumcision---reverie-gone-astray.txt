Looking in the mirror
        Harry didn't like what he saw
        The cheeks of his mother, the eyes of his father
        As each day crashed around him
        the future stood revealed
        He was turning into his parents
        The final disappointment
        Stepping out of the shower
        Harry stared at himself
        His hairline receding, the slight overbite
        He picked up the razor to begin his shaving and thought -
        - Oh, I wish I was different
        I wish I was stronger
        I wish I was thinner
        I wish I didn't have this nose
        These ears that stick out remind me of my father
        and I don't want to be reminded at all
        The final disappointment
        Harry looked in the mirror thinking of Vincent van Gogh
        and with a quick swipe lopped off his nose
        And happy with that he made a slice where his chin was
        He'd always wanted a dimple
        The end of all illusion
        Then peering down straight between his legs
        Harry thought of the range of possibilities
        A new face, a new life, no memories of the past
        and slit his throat from ear to ear
        Harry woke up with a cough
        the stitches made him wince
        A doctor smiled at him from
        somewhere across the room
        Son, we saved your life
        but you'll never look the same
        And when he heard that
        Harry had to laugh
        And when he heard that
        Harry had to laugh
        Although it hurt Harry had to laugh
        The final disappointment
