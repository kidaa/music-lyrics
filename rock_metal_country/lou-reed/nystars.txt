The stock is empty
        in our eyeball store
        All we got left
        a few cataracts and sores
        The faggot mimic machine
        never had ideas
        Mission impossible
        they self destruct on fear
        On a standard New York night
        ghouls go to see their so called stars
        A fairly stupid thing
        to pay 5 bucks for a 4th rate imitators
        They say, I'm so empty
        no surface, no depth
        Oh, please, can I be you
        your personality's so great
        Like new buildings
        square tall and the same
        Sorry, Miss Stupid
        didn't you know it was a game
        I'm just waiting
        for them to hurry up and die
        It's really getting to crowed here
        help me New York stars
        Contributions accepted all the same
        We need new people store
        remember, we're very good at games
