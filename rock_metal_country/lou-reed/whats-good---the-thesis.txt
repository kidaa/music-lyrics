Life's like a mayonnaise soda
        and life's like space without room
        And life's like bacon and ice cream
        that's what life's like without you
        Life's like forever becoming
        but life's forever dealing in hurt
        Now life's like death without living
        that's what life's like without you
        Life's like Sanskrit read to a pony
        I see you in my mind's eye strangling on your tongue
        What's good is knowing such devotion
        I've been around - I know what makes things run
        What good is seeing eye chocolate
        what good's a computerized nose
        And what good was cancer in April
        why no good - no good at all
        What good's a war without killing
        what good is rain that falls up
        What good's a disease that won't hurt you
        why no good, I guess, no good at all
        What good are these thoughts that I'm thinking
        It must be better not to be thinking at all
        A styrofoam lover with emotions of concrete
        no not much, not much at all
        What's good is life without living
        what good's this lion that barks
        You loved a life others throw away nightly
        it's not fair, not fair at all
        What's good?
        oh, baby, what's good?
        What's good?
        what's good? not much at all
        Hey, baby, what's good? what's good?
        What's good? what's good?
        what's good? what's good? not much at all
        What's good? what's good?
        what's good? life's good
        Life's good life's good
        what's good? life's good but not fair at all
