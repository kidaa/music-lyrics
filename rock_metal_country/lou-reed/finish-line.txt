Wind blows snow outside my windows
        crowd below runs wild in the streets
        Two rented brothers race down two separate alleys
        heading for the finish line
        Down in the train yard out by the stockyard
        butchers with aprons hack meat in the snow
        Blood has the brothers pulsing with envy
        heading for the finish line
        Two rented brothers. Their faces keep changing
        just like these feelings I have for you
        And nothing's forever not even five minutes
        when you're headed for the finish line
        Down in the depot out by the meat rack
        down by the tunnels surrounding the jail
        Prisoners are marching in squares and in circles
        they're heading for the finish line
        They're lining up for Noah's Ark
        they're stabbing each other in the dark
        Saluting a flag made of some rich guy's socks
        heading for the finish line
        Close to the line the ice is cracking
        two rented feelings sitting in the stands
        Two mothers, two fathers and both of them are paid for
        all of a sudden it comes back to me
        Just up ahead is the finish line
        two rented referees and two checkered rags
        Out of the corner of my eye comes a dark horse with black wings
        headed for the finish line
        I'm five years old the room is fuzzy
        I think there's also a very young girl
        It's hard to remember what happened exactly
        as I'm staring at the finish line
        First came fire then came light
        then came feeling then cane sight
