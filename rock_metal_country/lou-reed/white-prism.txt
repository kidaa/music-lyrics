There's a white prism with phony jism
        spread across its face
        and the soulful convicts forever interred
        lose the smile across their faces
        The smile that registered hopes or dreams
        has proven just a waste
        And I'm the indentured servant
        forever in his place
        I'm the indentured servant
        forever in his place
        I wish I built a cabinet
        of shiny bolts and wood
        secret draws and hiding places
        sculpted out of wood
        Secret places, secret lies
        in a desk lying alone
        A secret letter written to you
        to be read when you're alone
        A secret letter written to you
        to be read when you're alone
        It says, I'm your indentured servant
        I can no longer pretend
        that I'm a lover or an equal
        I'm not even a friend
        I'm not good enough to serve you
        I'm not good enough to stay
        So it is that I beseech you
        to please turn me away
        so it is that I beseech you
        to please turn me away
        Turn me away
        turn me away
        turn me away
        I'm asking you to let me go
        it hurts me when you're sad
        and I can not do better than this
        which must surely make you mad
        I'd be better off in your cabinet
        or in a prison made of cloth
        Crouched beneath your dress I come
        shooting little spurts
        crouched beneath your dress I come
        shooting little spurts
        I'm your indentured servant
        but even I have pride
        in what I make or say or do
        although I've lots to hide
        I hide from freedom and I hide from you
        'cause you've found me out
        I belong in prison beneath your legs
        in a cabinet that I've built
        beneath a candle in a secret drawer
        in a prison by a moat
        I'm your indentured servant
        and I'm asking you to leave
        me outside this prison cell
        where only you can breathe
        I-I-I, I'm your indentured servant
        but I'm asking you for this
        Please release me from this love
        and do it with a kiss
        I'm your indentured servant
        I'm the one you'll miss
        Do it with a kiss
        do it with a kiss
        do it with a kiss
        I'm the one you'll miss
