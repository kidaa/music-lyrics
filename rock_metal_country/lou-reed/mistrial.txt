When I was six, I had my first lady
        when I was eight, my first drink
        When I was fourteen, I was speeding in the street
        what could anybody say to me
        You can call me Mister, you can call me Sir
        but don't you point your finger at me
        I want a mistrial to clear my name
        I want a mistrial in front of the people
        I want a mistrial to clear my name
        I want to bring my case to the people of New York City
        When I was thirty, my attitude was bad
        if I said differently it'd be a lie
        But there's some smarts you learn down in the street
        that a college education can't buy
        You can call me Mister, or you can call me Sir
        but don't you point your finger at me, oh
        I want a mistrial to clear my name
        I want a mistrial in front of the people
        I want a mistrial to clear my name
        I want to bring my case to in front of the people at New York City
        You can call me Mister, or you can call me Sir
        but don't you point your finger at me, yeah
        I want a mistrial to clear my name
        I want a mistrial in front of the people, I, I
        I want a mistrial to clear my name
        I want to bring my case to the people at New York City
        And I said ";M-I-S-T-R-I-A-L";, mistrial
        in front of all the people
        I said ";M-I-S-T-R-I-A-L";, mistrial
        in front of the people of New York City
        Mistrial
        .... the people of New York City
        I said mistrial
        ";M-I-S-T-R-I-A-L"; ....
