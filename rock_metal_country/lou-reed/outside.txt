Outside the world's a mindless child
        outside
        Outside reflects the worst of styles
        outside
        Inside when you're in my arms
        a mindless child is still to be borne
        Inside, baby, when we come inside
        Outside the politics of greed
        outside
        Outside misbehavior seethes
        outside
        Mindless repression dominates the street
        while I kneel down and kiss your feet
        Inside, baby, when we come inside
        outside
        Outside they don't think they breed
        outside
        Outside emotion determines need
        outside
        Outside the world's a mindless child
        that we could bring to life in your arms
        Inside, baby, when we come inside
        Outside the politics of hate an greed
        outside
        Outside the world's a mindless child
        outside
        But when I hold you in my arms
        it's a mindless child that you want
        Inside, no matter 'bout the world Outside
        Inside, a baby's what you want inside
