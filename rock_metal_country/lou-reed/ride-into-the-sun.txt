Looking for another chance
        for someone else to be
        Looking for another place
        to ride into the sun
        Ride into the sun
        ride into the sun
        Ride into the sun
        ride into the sun
        Where -
        - everything seems so pretty
        but if you're tired and you're sick of the city
        Remember that it's just a flower
        made out of clay
        Oh-oh-oh, the city -
        - where everything seems so dirty
        but if you're tired and you're filled with self-pity
        Remember that you're just one more
        person who's there
        It's hard to live in the city
        It's hard to live in the city, oh, oh-oh
        It's hard to live in the city, oh, wow-wow
        It's hard to live in the city
