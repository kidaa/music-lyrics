Please
        Come over to 81st street I'm in the apartment
        above the bar
        You know you can't miss it, it's across from the subway
        and the tacky store with the mylar scarves
        My skin's as pale as outdoors moon
        my hair's silver like a Tiffany watch
        I like lots of people around me but don't kiss hello
        and please don't touch
        It's a Czechoslovakian custom my mother passed on to me
        the way to make friends Andy is invite them up for tea
        Open house

        I've got a lot of cats, here's my favorite
        she's lady called Sam
        I made a paper doll of her, you can have it
        that's what I did when I had St.Vitus dance
        It's a Czechoslovakian custom my mother passed on to me
        give people little presents so they remember me
        Open house
        open house
        Someone bring the vegetables
        someone please bring heat
        My mother showed up yesterday
        we need something to eat
        I think I got a job today they want me to draw shoes
        the ones I drew were old and used
        they told me to draw something new
        Open house
        open house
        Fly me to the moon
        fly me to a star
        But there are no stars in the New York sky
        they're all on the ground
        You scared yourself with music, I scared myself with paint
        I drew 550 different shoes today, it almost made me faint
        Open house
        open house
        Open house
        Open house
