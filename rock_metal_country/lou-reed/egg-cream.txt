When I was a young man, no bigger than this
        a chocolate egg cream was not to be missed
        Some U Bet's Chocolate Syrup, seltzer water mixed with milk
        you stir it up into a heady fro, tasted just like silk
        You scream, I steam, we all want egg cream
        You scream, I steam, we all want egg cream
        Now you can go to Junior's, Dave's on Canal Street
        and I think there's Ken's in Boston
        there must be something in L.A.
        But Becky's on Kings Highway, was the egg cream of choice
        and if you don't believe me, go ask any of the boys
        You scream, I steam, we all want egg cream
        You scream, I steam, we all want egg cream
        The only good thing I have to say about P.S. 92
        was the egg cream served at Becky's, it was a fearsome brew
        For 50 cents you got a shot, choco bubbles up your nose
        that made it easier to deal with knife fights
        and kids pissing in the street
        You scream, I steam, we all want egg cream
        You scream, I steam, we all want egg cream
        So the next time you're in Brooklyn, please say hello for me
        at Totonno's for Pizza and ice cream at Al and Shirley's
        But mostly you go to Becky's, sit in a booth and say hello
        and have two chocolate egg cream, one to stay and one to go
        You scream, I steam, we all want egg cream, ah
        You scream, I steam, we all want egg cream
        You scream, I steam, we all want egg cream
