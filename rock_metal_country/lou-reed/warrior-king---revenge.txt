I wish I was the warrior king
        in every language that I speak
        Lord over all that I survey
        and all that I see I keep
        Power omnipresent
        undiminished uncontrolled
        With a message violent fury
        at the center of my soul
        I wish I was a warrior king
        inscrutable benign
        With a faceless charging power
        always at my command
        Footsteps so heavy that the world shakes
        my rage instilling fear, ah, ha
        Yet cautious firm but fair and good
        the perfect Warrior King
        I wish I installed angles
        in every subject's house
        Agents of my goodness
        no one would be without
        A steak on every plate
        a car for every house
        And if you ever crossed me
        I'd have your eyes put out
        You don't exist without me
        without me you don't exist
        And if logic won't convinced you
        then there's always this
        I'm bigger, smarter, stronger, tough
        yet sensitive and kind
        And though I could crush you like a bug
        it will never cross my mind
        It wouldn't cross my mind to your neck
        or rip out your vicious tongue
        It wouldn't cross my mind to snap your leg like a twig
        or squash you like some slug
        You are a violent messenger
        and I'm not above your taunts
        And if you hit me you know I'll kill you
        because I'm the Warrior King
