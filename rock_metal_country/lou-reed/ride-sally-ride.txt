Sit yourself down
        bang out a tune on that grand piano
        Sit yourself down
        lay languidly down upon that sofa
        Ooohhh, isn't it nice
        when your heart is made out of ice
        Ride, Sally, ride
        it's not your time or way of confusion
        Ride, Sally, ride
        'cause if you don't, you'll get a contusion
        Ooohhh, isn't it nice
        when your heart is made out of ice
        Sit yourself down
        take of your pants, don't you know this is a party
        Sit yourself down
        why do you think we brought all these people, Miss Brandy
        Ooohhh, isn't it nice
        when you find your heart's made out of ice
        Ride, Sally, ride
        it's not your time, it's just your confusion
        Ride, Sally, ride
        it's not your time, you'll get a contusion
        Ooohhh, isn't it nice
        when you find your heart is made out of ice
        Ride, Sally ride
        Ride, ride, ride, ride, Sally ride Ride, Sally, ride
        Ride, ride, ride, ride, Sally ride Hey, ride, Sally, ride
        Ride, ride, ride, ride, Sally ride Ride, Sally, ride
        Ride, ride, ride, ride, Sally ride, oh-oh-oh, oh
        Ride, ride, ride, ride, Sally ride, hey-hey-hey, hey-hey
