Harry was a rich young man
        who would become a priest
        He dug up his dear father
        who was recently deceased
        He did it with tarot cards
        and a mystically attuned mind
        And shortly there
        and after he did find
        Jeanie was a spoiled young brat
        she thought she knew it all
        She smoked mentholated cigarettes
        and she had sex in the hall
        But she was not my kind
        or even of my sigh
        The kind of animal
        that I would be about
        Woh-woh-woh, you keep hangin' round me
        and I'm not so glad you found me
        You're still doing things that I gave up years ago
        Oh-woh-woh-woh, you keep hangin' round me
        and I'm not so glad you found me
        You're still doing things that I gave up years ago
        all right now
        ah-huh-huh
        Kathy was a bit surreal
        she painted all her toes
        And on her face she wore dentures
        clamped tightly to her nose
        And when she finally spoke
        her twang her glasses broke
        And no one else could smoke
        while she was in the room
        Hark the herald angels sang
        and reached out for a phone
        And plucking it with a knife in hand
        dialed long distance home
        But it was all too much
        sprinkling angel dust
        To AT and T
        who didn't wish you well
        Oh, but you keep hangin' round me
        and I'm not so glad you found me
        You're still doing things that I gave up years ago
        Ho-ho-ho-ho, you keep hangin' round me
        and I'm not so glad you found me
        You're still doing things that I gave up years ago
        Hangin' round
        hangin' round, that's all you're doing baby
        Hangin' round
        hangin' round, ooohhh
        Hangin' round
        hangin' round
        Hangin' round
        hangin' round
        ...
