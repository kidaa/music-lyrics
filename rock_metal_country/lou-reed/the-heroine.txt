The heroine stood up on the deck
        the ship was out of control
        the bow was being ripped to shreds
        men were fighting down below
        The sea had pummeled the boat for so long
        that they knew nothing but fear
        And the baby's in the box
        he thinks the door is locked
        the sea is in a state
        the baby learns to wait for the heroine
        Ohh, ohh, for the heroine
        locked in his defense, he waits for the heroine
        The mast is cracking as he waves are slapping
        sailors roll across the deck
        and when they thought none was looking
        they would cut a weaker man's neck
        While the heroine dressed in a virgin white dress
        tried to steer the mighty ship
        But the raging storm wouldn't hear of it
        they were in for a long trip
        Baby's in the box
        he thinks the door is locked
        he finds it hard to breathe
        drawing in the sea
        And where's the heroine to fire off the gun
        to calm the raging seas
        and let herself be seized, by the -
        - Baby in the box
        the thinks the door is locked
        the woman has the keys
        but there is no moment she can seize
        Here's to the heroine
        who transcends all the men
        Who are locked inside the box
        will the lady let them out
        Ohh, the heroine, ooohh, ooohhh, the heroine
        Strapped to the mast, the pale ascendant heroine
        strapped to the mast, the pale ascendant heroine
