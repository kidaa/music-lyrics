With you, life moves so fast
        with you, everything's a mess
        Slow down
        Don't you think you could be less capricious
        I'm not you, I don't have no death wish
        Slow down
        slow down
        With you, there is no denying
        it's you, not my lack of trying
        With you, everybody's lying
        it's you, it's not me who's crying
        Crying, crying
        crying, crying
        With you, stay and hold tightly from the streets
        with you, every friend's a possible beat
        Slow down
        slow down
        With you, it's a foregone conclusion
        with you, envy, it's all a delusion
        With you, I can have no illusions
        it's you, who has the contusions
        Crying, crying
        crying, crying
        With you, everyone's a sucker
        with you, it's fuckee or fucker
        Slow down
        slow down
        With you, life is just a scramble
        with you, every day is a gamble
        With you, I can't forget life barely
        with you, playing the Virgin Mary
        And your crying, crying
        crying, crying
        Crying, crying
