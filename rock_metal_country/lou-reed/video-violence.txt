The currents rage deep inside us
        this is the age of video violence
        The currents rage so deep inside us
        this is the age of video violence
        Up in the morning, drinking his coffee
        turns on the TV to some slasher movie
        Cartoon-like women, tied up and sweaty
        painting and screaming, thank you, have a nice day
        the currents rage, the dawn's upon us
        this is the age of video violence
        The currents rage so deep inside us
        this is the age of video violence
        Na-na-na, na-na-na
        na-na-na, na-na-na
        His heart is pounding he switches the channel
        looking for something other than rape or murder
        Or beatings or torture but except for Walt Disney
        it's a twisted alliance, this age of video violence
        The currents rage, the dawn's upon us
        this is the age of video violence
        The current rage so deep inside us
        this is the age of video violence
        Down at his job, his boss sits there screaming
        if he loses his job, then life loses its meaning
        His son is in high school, there's nothing he's learning
        he sits by the TV, watching Corvettes exploding, 'cause
        The currents rage, the dawn's upon us
        this is the age of video violence
        No age of reason landing upon us
        this is the age of video violence
        Na-na-na, na-na-na
        na-na-na, na-na-na
        Down at a bar some woman is topless
        she's acned and scarred, her hair is a mess
        While he shoves 5 dollars down her exotic panties
        the video jukebox is, ah, playing Madonna
        While just down the block at some local theater
        they're grabbing their crotches at the 13th beheading
        As the dead rise to live, the live sink to die
        the currents are deep and raging inside
        The currents rage so deep inside us
        this is the age of video violence
        No age of reason is landing upon us
        this is the age of video violence
        Na-na-na, na-na-na
        na-na-na, na-na-na
        Na-na-na, na-na-na
        na-na-na, na-na-na
        Our good working stiff looks a whore in the eye
        ties her to a bed
        while he beats her back bloody and then back -
        - At home, drinking more instant coffee
        calls some red-neck evangelist that he's seen on TV and says
        The currents rage, the dawn's upon us
        this is the age of video violence
        No age of reason is landing upon us
        this is the age of video violence
        The currents rage so deep upon us
        this is the age of video violence
        The currents rage so deep down inside us
        this is the age of video violence
