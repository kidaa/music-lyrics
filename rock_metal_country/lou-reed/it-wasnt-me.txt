It wasn't me who shamed you
        it's not fair to say that
        you wanted to work I gave you a chance at that
        It wasn't me who hurt you
        that's more credit that I'm worth
        don't threaten me with the things you'll do to you
        It wasn't me who shamed you
        it wasn't me who brought you down
        you did it to yourself without any help from me
        It wasn't me who hurt you
        I showed you possibilities
        the problems you had were there before you met me
        I didn't say this had to be
        you can't blame these things on me
        It wasn't me, it wasn't me, it wasn't me
        I know she's dead, it wasn't me
        It wasn't me who changed you
        you did it to yourself
        I'm not an excuse for the hole you dropped in
        I'm not simple minded
        but I'm not father to you at all
        death exists but you do things to yourself
        I never said give up control
        I never said stick a needle in your arm and die
        It wasn't me, it wasn't me, it wasn't me
        I know he's dead but it wasn't me
        It wasn't me who shamed you
        who covered you with mud
        you did it to yourself without any help from me
        You act as I could've told you
        or stopped you like some god
        but people never listen and you know that that's a fact
        I never said slit your wrists and die
        I never said throw your life away
        It wasn't me, it wasn't me, it wasn't me
        you're killing yourself, you can't blame me
