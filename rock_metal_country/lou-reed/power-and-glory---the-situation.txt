I was visited by the power and the glory
        I was visited by a majestic hymn
        Great bolts of lightning lighting up the sky
        electricity flowing through my veins
        I was captured by a larger moment
        I was seized by divinity's hot breath
        Gorged like a lion on experience
        powerful from life
        I wanted all of it, all of it, all of it
        All of it
        Not just some of it, all of it, all of it
        All of it
        I saw a man turn into a bird
        I saw a bird turn into a tiger
        I saw a man hang from a cliff by the tips of his toes
        in the jungles of the Amazon
        I saw a man put a redhot needle through his eye
        turn into a crow and fly through the trees
        Swallow hot coals and breathe out flames
        and I wanted this to happen to me
        I wanted all of it, all of it, all of it
        All of it
        All of it, all of it, all of it
        Not some of it
        We saw the moon vanish into his pocket
        we saw the stars disappear from sight
        We saw him walk across water into the sun
        while bathed in eternal light
        We spewed out questions waiting for answers
        creating legends, religions and myths
        Books, stories, movies and plays
        all trying to explain this
        I wanted all of it, oh, all of it
        All of it
        All of it, oh, all of it
        Not some of it
        I saw a great man turn into a little child
        the cancer reduce him to dust
        His voice growing weak as he fought for his life
        with a bravery few men know
        I saw isotopes introduced into his lungs
        trying to stop the cancerous spread
        And it made me think of ";Leda And The Swan";
        and gold being made from lead
        The same power that burned Hiroshima
        causing three legged babies and death
        Shrunk to the size of a nickel
        to help him regain his breath
        And I was struck by the power and the glory
        I was visited by a majestic Him
        Great bolts of lightning lighting up the sky
        as the radiation flowed through him
        I wanted all of it, not just some of it, all of it
        He wanted all of it
        All of it, all of it, all of it
        He wanted all of it, not some of it
