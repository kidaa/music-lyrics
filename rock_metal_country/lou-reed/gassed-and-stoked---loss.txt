Well you covered your tracks and now I can't see you
        you had your ashes scattered at sea
        There's no grave to visit, no tombstone to look at
        you were in the New York Times obituary
        There's no record, no tape, no book, no movie
        some photographs and memories
        Sometimes I dial your phone number by mistake
        and this is what I hear
        This is no longer a working number, baby
        please redial your call
        This is no longer a working number
        your party doesn't live here anymore
        This is no longer a working number
        if you still require help
        Stay on the line and an operator
        will try to bail you out
        I knew I should have seen you that Thursday
        I knew I shouldn't have left
        But you sounded so good, your spirits so up
        I thought I'd see you next week
        I say over and over if I had half a brain
        if I had half a brain in my head
        I wouldn't sit here dialing a wrong number
        and listening to what some recording said
        This is no longer a working number
        please redial your call
        This is no longer a working number
        your party doesn't live here anymore
        This is no longer a working number
        well, if you still require help
        Stay on the line and an operator
        will try to bail you out
        I knew I should have written, written things down
        I always say I'll never forget
        Who can forget a one-eyed pilot
        who's a concert pianist, ah
        A painter, a poet, songwriter supreme
        my friends are blending in my head
        They're melting into one great spirit
        and that spirit isn't dead
        Now I may not remember everything that you said
        but I remember all the sings you've done
        And not a day goes by not an hour
        when I don't try to be like you
        You were gassed, stoked and rarin' to go
        and you were that way all of the time
        So I guess you know why I'm laughing at myselves
        every time I dial the wrong line
        This is no longer a working number, baby
        This is no longer a working number
        Gassed, stoked and rarin' to go
        gassed, stoked and rarin' to go
        gassed, stoked and rarin' to go
        gassed, stoked and rarin' to go
        Gassed, stoked and rarin' to go
        gassed, stoked and rarin' to go
        gassed, stoked and rarin' to go
        gassed, stoked and rarin' to go
