Train entering the city
        I lost myself and never came back
        Took a trip around the world and never came back
        Black silhouettes, crisscrossed tracks, never came back
        Forever changed
        Forever changed
        You might think I'm frivolous, uncaring and cold
        You might think I'm empty, depends on your point of view
        Society Andy who paints and records them
        The high and the low, never turn back
        Forever changed
        Forever changed
        Forever changed
        Forever changed
        Got to get to the city, get a job
        Got to get some work to see me through
        My old life's behind, I see it receding
        My life's disappearing, disappearing from view
        Hong Kong and I was changed
        Burma, Thailand and I was changed
        A few good friends to see me through
        Henry and Brigid to see me through
        Only art to see me through
        Only heart to see me through
        My old life's disappearing, disappearing from view
        Forever changed
        Forever changed
        I was forever changed
