When you pass through the fire, you pass through humble
        you pass through a maze of self doubt
        When you pass through humble, the lights can blind you
        some people never figure that out
        You pass through arrogance, you pass through hurt
        you pass through an ever present past
        And it's best not to wait for luck to save you
        pass through the fire to the light
        Pass through the fire to the light
        pass through the fire to the light
        It's best not to wait for luck to save you
        pass through the fire to the light
        As you pass through the fire, your right hand waving
        there are things you have to throw out
        That caustic dread inside your head
        will never help you out
        You have to be very strong, 'cause you'll start from zero
        over and over again
        And as the smoke clears there's an all consuming fire
        lying straight ahead
        Lying straight ahead
        lying straight ahead
        As the smoke clears there's an all consuming fire
        lying straight ahead
        They say no one person can do it all
        but you want to in your head
        But you can't be Shakespeare and you can't be Joyce
        so what is left instead
        You're stuck with yourself and a rage that can hurt you
        you have to start at the beginning again
        And just this moment this wonderful fire
        started up again
        When you pass through humble, when you pass through sickly
        when you pass through I'm better than you all
        When you pass through anger and self deprecation
        and have the strength to acknowledge it all
        When the past makes you laugh and you can savor the magic
        that let you survive your own war
        You find that that fire is passion
        and there's a door up ahead not a wall
        As you pass through fire as you pass through fire
        trying to remember its name
        When you pass through fire licking at your lips
        you cannot remain the same
        And if the building's burning move towards that door
        but don't put the flames out
        There's a bit of magic in everything
        and then some loss to even things out
        Some loss to even things out
        some loss to even things out
        There's a bit of magic in everything
        and then some loss to even things out
