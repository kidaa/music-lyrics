Last shot sure killed me
        pour another drink
        Let's drink to the last shot
        and the blood on the dishes in the sink
        Blood inside the coffee cup
        blood on the table top
        But when you quit, you quit, but you always wish
        that you knew it was your last shot
        When you quit, you quit, but you always wish
        that you knew it was your last shot
        I shot blood at the fly on the wall
        my heart almost stopped hardly there at all
        I broke the mirror with my fall, with my -
        - Fall-fall-fall
        fall-fall-fall
        Gimme a double, give yourself one two
        gimme a short beer, one for you too
        And a toast to everything that doesn't move
        that doesn't move
        But when you quit, you quit, but you always wish
        that you knew it was your last shot
        When you quit, you quit, but you always wish
        that you knew it was your last shot
        Whiskey, bourbon, vodka and scotch
        I don't care what it is you've got
        I just want to know that it's my last shot
        My last shot
        I remember when I quit pretty good
        see this here, this is where I chipped my tooth
        Shot of vein in my neck and I coughed up a Quaalude
        On my last shot
        my last shot
        Here's a toast to all that's good
        and here's a toast to hate
        And here's a toast to toasting and I'm not boasting
        When I say I'm getting straight
        when I say I'm getting straight
        But when you quit, you quit, but you always wish
        that you knew it was your last shot
        When you quit, you quit, but you always wish
        that you knew it was your last shot
