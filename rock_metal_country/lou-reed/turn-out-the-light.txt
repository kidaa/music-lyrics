Lover, lover, why is there light
        in the itchy gitchy evening and it's dark outside
        And what's the difference between wrong and right
        wrong and right
        Isn't it funny how pain goes away
        and then comes back another day
        The air feels very good today
        good today
        Lover, lover, why is there light
        did you forget to turn off that light
        Well that's all right but it's way too bright
        way too bright
        See the eagle above the hill
        the lake reflects and is so still
        The tension has gone from my will
        from my will
        Moon on the mountain shining bright
        first there is dark and then there is light
        And sometimes the light is way too bright
        it's way to bright
        Why don't you turn out the light
        oh, turn out the light
        Why don't you turn out the light
        turn out the light
        Turn out the light
        Turn out the light
