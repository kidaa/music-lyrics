I'm waiting for my man
        Got 26 dollars in my hand
        Up to Lexington 125
        feelin' sick and dirty
        Huh, I'm waiting for my man
        Hey white boy, what you doin' uptown
        Hey white boy, you chasin' my women around
        Pardon me sir, it's furthest from my mind
        I'm just waitin' for a dear-dear friend of mine
        I'm waiting for my man, come on
        Here he comes, he's all dressed in black
        PR shoes and a big straw hat
        He's never early, he's always late
        first thing you learn is that you always gotta wait
        I'm waiting for my man
        Up to a brownstone, up three flights of stairs
        Everybody's pinned you and nobody cares
        He's got the works, gives you sweet taste
        then you gotta split because you got no time to waste
        I'm waiting for my man
        Hey baby, don't you holler, don't you ball and shout
        I'm feeling good, I'm gonna work it on out
        I'm feeling good, feeling so fine
        until tomorrow, but that's just some other time
        I'm waiting for my man
        I'm waiting for my man
        I'm waiting for my man
        man-man-man-man-man-man-man
