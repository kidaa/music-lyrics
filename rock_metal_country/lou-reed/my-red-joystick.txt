The first bite of the apple made Eve smart
        the second bite taught her how to break men's hearts
        The third bite taught her how to strut her stuff
        but she never got to the fourth bite
        that says ";Enough is enough";
        Enough is enough, baby, I've had enough of you
        you can keep your dresses, you can keep your jewels
        You can keep the color TV, those soaps just make me sick
        all I'm asking you leave me is my little red joystick
        My red joystick, my red joystick
        all I'm asking you leave me is my little red joystick
        My red joystick, my red joystick
        all I'm asking you leave me is my little red joystick
        Eve kissed Able, that's how he got murdered by Cain
        Abraham gave up his son, to keep his wife away
        And even the Lord Almighty
        speaking from the trenches to the pits
        spoke for all of mankind, when he said
        Take the Porsche, take the kids
        take the stocks, baby, take the rugs
        Take those roses from my poor heart wilting
        but, please, please, hey, please, leave me my red joystick
        Leave me my red joystick, leave me my red joystick
        Leave me my red joystick
        Eve drank apple cider, Eve brewed good apple wine
        Eve cooked up stewed apples, knew how to have a good time
        She came into the bedroom, raised her skirts up high
        she said, ";If a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, baby
        give me a piece before I die";
        Hey, Eve take a bite of my apple
        I know you think you're pretty slick
        the one thing I ask you to leave me is my red joystick
        My red joystick, ooohhh, my red joystick
        all I'm asking you leave me is my little red joystick
        My red joystick, baby, my red joystick
        all I'm asking you leave me is my little red joystick
        My red joystick
        hey ..., my red joystick
        Ooohhh, red joystick
        please, leave me my red joystick
        ... red joystick
        please, leave me my red joystick
        My red joystick
        ...
        My red joystick, my red joystick
