Well the coal-black sea waits for me-me-me
        the coal-black sea waits forever
        The waves hit the shore, crying more-more-more
        but the coal-black sea waits forever
        The tornados come up the coast they run
        hurricanes rip the sky forever
        Through the weathers change, the sea remains the same
        the coal-black sea waits forever
        There are ashes split through collective guilt
        people rest at sea forever
        Since they burnt you up, collect you in a cup
        for you the coal-black sea has no terror
        Will your ashes float like some foreign boat
        or will they sink absorbed forever
        Will the Atlantic Coast, have its final boast
        nothing else contained you ever
        Now the coal-black sea waits for me-me-me
        the coal-black sea waits forever
        When I leave this joint at some further point
        the same coal-black sea will it be waiting
