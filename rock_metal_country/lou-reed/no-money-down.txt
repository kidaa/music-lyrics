I know you're disappointed
        in the way I handled things
        You're thinking I misread the times
        and acted cowardly
        And since what I do affects us both
        and you feel that I let you down
        You're paying a price when there is no price to pay
        lovers trust, No Money Down
        You're paying a price when there is no price to pay
        lovers trust, No Money Down
        Hey! lover
        Hey! lover
        lover
        They say there's someone for everyone
        and for everyone a someone
        And some tattoo roses across their chests
        with a heart that says Rollo
        And some work without a Public Relations man
        and do their best work, baby, out of sight
        You're paying a price when there is no price to pay
        lovers trust, No Money Down
        You're paying a price when there is no price to pay
        lovers trust, No Money Down
        Hey! lover
        Hey! lover
        lover
        Now I have known a hero or two
        and they all learn to swim through mud
        And they all got boots caked with dirty soles
        that they get from Squashing bugs
        So when push comes to shove get the Harley revved up
        the moon can eclipse even the sun
        You're paying a price when there is no price to pay
        lovers trust, No Money Down
        You're paying a price when there is no price to pay
        lovers trust, No Money Down
        Lovers trust, No Money Down Hey! lover
        Yes, lovers trust, No Money Down Hey! lover
        Lovers trust, No Money Down Hey! hey! lover
        Lovers trust, No Money Down Hey! hey! lover
        Hey! hey! lover
        Hey! hey! lover
