All the sailors they're all home from leave
        And everybody's waiting for them to try to deceive
        The storekeepers have drawn their lace curtains bare
        And all the women and the wee young girls all waiting there
        Oh, but how the ladies pay
        Oh, if they only knew how the ladies pay
        Yeah now, how the ladies pay
        Oh, when the men they've gone away
        Nobody is standing on upon the door
        And nobody is feeding any of the poor
        The poor sick soldier lies in bed beside his girl
        Thinking of another place on the other side of the world
        ah
        How the ladies pay
        Oh-oh, oh, how the ladies pay
        When the men they've gone away
        Oh, I wish I knew how the ladies pay
        Day and night, night and day
        how the ladies pay
        Day and night, night and day
        how the ladies pay
        Day and night
        night and day
        Day and night
        day and night, night and day, ladies pay now
        Night and day, day and night
        how the ladies pay
        Day and night, night and day
        how the ladies pay
        Day and night now
        night and day and now
        How the pay now
        oh, how the pay now
        Ladies pay, ladies pay
        ah, ladies pay the way now
        Ladies pay, ah, ladies pay
        ah, ladies pay
        Night and day, night and day, night and day
        oh, how the ladies pay
        Oh, night and day, night and day, night and day
        oh, how the ladies pay
