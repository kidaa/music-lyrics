The other night we went to see Sam's play
        doin' the things that we want to
        It was very physical it held you to the stage
        doin' the things that he wants to
        Doin' the things that he wants to
        The guy's a cowboy from some rodeo
        doin' the things that he wants to
        The girl had once loved him, but now she want to go
        doin' the things that she wants to
        Doin' the things that she wants to
        The man was bullish, the woman was a tease
        doin' the things that they want to
        They fought with their words, their bodies and their deeds
        doin' the things that they want to
        When they finished fighting, they exited the stage
        doin' the things that they want to
        I was firmly struck by the way they had behaved
        doin' the things that they want to
        Doin' the things that they want to
        hey
        It reminds me of the movies Marty made about New York
        doin' the things that he wants to
        Those frank and brutal movies that are so brilliant
        doin' the things that he wants to
        ";True Love"; meet ";The Raging Bull";
        doin' the things that he wants to
        They're very inspirational, I love the things they do
        doin' the things that he wants to
        Doin' the things that I want to
        There's not much you hear on the radio today
        doin' the things that we want to
        But you could still see a movie or a play
        doin' the things that we want to
        Here's to ";Travis Bickle"; and here's ";Johnny Boy";
        doin' the things that we want to
        Growing up in the Mean Streets of New York
        doin' the things that we want to
        I wrote this song 'cause I'd like to shake your hand
        doin' the things that we want to
        In a way you guys are the best friends I ever had
        doin' the things that we want to
        Doin' the things that we want to
        That we want to
        A true love
