If you gave up major vices
        you're between a hard place and a wall
        And your car breaks down in traffic
        on the street
        Remember, I'm the one who loves you
        you can always give me a call
        Turn to me, turn to me
        baby, turn to me
        If your father is free basing
        and your mother turning tricks
        That's still no reason
        you should have a rip
        Remember, I'm the one who loves you
        you can always give me a call
        Turn to me, turn to me
        turn to me
        When your teeth are ground down to the bone
        and there's nothing between your legs
        And some friend died of something
        that you can't pronounce, ah
        Remember, I'm the one who loves you
        hey baby, you can always give me a call
        Turn to me, turn to me
        turn to me
        You can't pay your rent, your boss is an idiot
        and your apartment has no heat
        And your wife says, ";Maybe
        it's time to have a child";
        Remember, I'm the one who loves you
        and you can always give me a call
        Turn to me, turn to me
        turn to me
        When it's all too much you turn the TV set on
        and light a cigarette
        And then a public service announcement
        comes creeping on
        And you see a lung corroding
        or a fatal heart attack
        Turn to me, turn to me
        baby, turn to me, I'm just a phone call away
        Turn to me, turn to me
        hey, turn to me, one .... a dollar
        Turn to me, baby
        turn to me
        Turn to me, turn to me
        turn to me
        Turn to me, turn to me
        turn to me
