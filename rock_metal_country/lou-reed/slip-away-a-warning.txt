Friends have said to lock the door
        and have an open house no more
        the said the Factory must change
        And slowly slip away
        But if I have to live in fear
        where will I get my ideas
        with all those crazy people gone
        Will I slowly slip away
        Still there's no more Billy Name
        Ondine is not the same
        Wonton and the Turtle gone
        Slowly slip away
        slowly slip away
        If I close the Factory door
        and don't see those people anymore
        if I give in to infamy
        I'll slowly slip away
        I know it seems that friends are right
        hello daylight, goodbye night
        but starlight is so quiet here
        Think I'll slowly slip away
        What can I do by myself
        it's good to here from someone else
        it's good to hear a crazy voice
        Will not slip away
        will not slip away
        If I have to live in fear
        my ideas will slowly slip away
        If I have to live in fear
        I'm afraid my life will slip away
        If you can't see me past my door
        why your thoughts could slowly slip away
        If I have to lock the door
        another life exists no more slip away
        Friends have said to lock the door
        watch out for who comes through the door
        the said the Factory must change
        But I don't
