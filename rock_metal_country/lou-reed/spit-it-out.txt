If there's rage inside you so you cannot think
        spit it out
        If you get so angry that you cannot speak
        spit it out
        Talk to him or her or it
        and tell them where they can put it
        Spit it out, spit it out
        You got to talk to him or her or it
        and take aim with your mouth and spit
        Spit it out, spit it out
        If you get worked over at your job
        spit it out
        If a taxi almost runs you down
        spit it out
        You got to take aim with your mouth and speak
        and give it to them right between the teeth
        Spit it out, spit it out
        Talk to him or her or it
        and take aim with your mouth and spit
        Spit it out, spit it out
        Spit it out
        Hey, hey, hey
        If you're patient and you have the time
        spit it out
        Wait till they're on the decline
        spit it out
        The Chinese say you meet the hard with the soft
        the Yin with the Yang, the down with the up, oh
        Spit it out, spit it out
        You got to grab that dumb he, she or it
        and give it to them right between the teeth
        Spit it out, spit it out
        Spit it out, babe, spit it out
        Hey
