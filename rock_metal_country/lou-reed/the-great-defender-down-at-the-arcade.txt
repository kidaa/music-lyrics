Down at the arcade the defender is there
        down off of Broadway he's there playing his games
        It's very dangerous
        putting money down on Robotron
        Oh, I'm the Great Defender
        and I really know just how to get along
        Down at the arcade, down at the arcade
        down at the arcade, down at the arcade
        Down at the arcade
        down at the arcade
        Oh, I'm the Great Defender
        and I really think I've got it made
        A fistful of quarters, a fifty dollar stake
        life is a gamble on video tape
        I called a disc jockey
        to dedicate a song to Blair
        It's the Temps. singing ";I'll be there";
        Down at the arcade, down at the arcade
        down at the arcade, down at the arcade
        Down at the arcade
        down at the arcade
        Oh, I'm the Great Defender
        and I really think I've got it made
        The president called to give me the news
        I've been awarded the Nobel Price in rhythm and blues
        And Stevie Wonder
        wants to record one of my songs
        Oh, I'm the Great Defender
        and I really know just how to get along
        Oh, I'm the Great Defender, listen to my song
        I really hope you like it, it isn't very long
        It's rooted in the 50s
        but its heart's in 1984
        And if you really like it
        then I sing it for you once more
        Down at the arcade, down at the arcade
        down at the arcade, down at the arcade
        Down at the arcade
        down at the arcade
        Oh, I'm the Great Defender
        and I really think I've got it made
        Down at the arcade, down at the arcade
        down at the arcade, down at the arcade
        Down at the arcade
        down at the arcade
