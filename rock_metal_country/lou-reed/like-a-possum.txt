Good morning, it's possum day
        feel like a possum in every way
        like a possum
        Possum whiskers, possum face
        possum breath and a possum taste
        ooohhh, like a possum
        Possum tales, possum eyes
        possum bones, possum thighs
        oh, like a possum
        Possum shots, possum runs
        possum sleeps to possum drums
        calm as an angel
        Good morning, it's possum day
        I feel like a possum in every way
        like a possum
        Wake up with a possum smile
        look at me, look at this smile
        like a possum
        Things are all right, don't worry about this
        my mind's amiss, I've lost the kiss
        My smile is leaden, my gait is rubber
        and I say as one possum to another like a possum
        calm as an angel
        The only thing I hope to never see
        is another possum in this tree
        playing possum
        Just like a possum
        I got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
        it won't be filled by a one-night fuck
        Slurping and squeezing ain't it just my luck
        got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
        the size of a truck
        The devil tried to fill me up but my down was high
        as the sky is up, ah
        ain't that just my luck
        calm as an angel
        Smoking crack with a downtown flirt
        shooting and coming 'til it hurts
        calm, calm, ah, calm
        calm as an angel
        They're mating like apes in the zoo
        ah, one for me and one for you
        wouldn't it just be lovely
        Another useless night in bed, ah, ah
        by the Hudson River, the roller-bladers giving head
        used condoms float on the river edge's head
        Wouldn't it be lovely
        wouldn't it be lovely
        I got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
        it won't be filled by one-night fuck
        like a possum
        like a possum
        Ahhh
        calm as an angel
        You know me I like to dance a lot
        with different selves who cancel out
        one another
        I'm the only one left standing
        One likes muscles, oil and dirt
        and the other likes the women with the butt that hurts
        like a possum
        Devil tried to fill me up
        but my down was high as the sky is up
        calm as an angel
        I got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
        and it won't be filled by a one-night fuck
        like a possum
        You know me I like to drink a lot
        and carry on
        don't know which self will show up, ah
        over the 5 a.m. sun, -
        - The moon is shining
        over the docks shining
        ooohhh, calm as an angel
        Girls in the market know what I'm about
        they pinch their nipples and they lift their skirts, ah
        with a pierced tongue licking below a stained T-shirt
        Look at this smile
        My mind's amiss
        Smoking crack with a downtown flirt
        shooting and coming 'til it hurts
        calm, calm
        Sitting on a curb I throw a rock
        at the passing meat market trucks
        it's just my luck
        I'm the only one left standing
        Now you know me I like to drink a lot, ah
        only one left standing
        The girls in the market know what I'm about
        they pinch their nipples and they lift their skirts
        licking below a stained T-shirt
        calm as an angel
        Smoking crack with a downtown flirt
        shooting and coming baby 'til it hurts
        wouldn't it be, wouldn't it be
        Wouldn't it be love
        wouldn't it be lovely
        calm as an angel
        Got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
        it won't be filled by one-night fuck
        Ain't it just my luck
        I got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
        Another useless night in bed
        walk down the Hudson River getting head
        calm, calm, calm, calm, calm as an angel
        Don't know why baby, I'm still here strong
        and fearless in the outside air
        I'm the only one left standing
        I'm the only one
        the only one
        the only one left standing
        I'm the only one
        I'm the only one
        left standing
        calm as an angel
        I'm the only one
        I'm the only one, the only one
        left standing
        calm as an angel
        Shooting an coming 'til it hurts
        o'holy morning
        Calm as an angel
