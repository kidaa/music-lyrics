You keep your jealousy and your snide remarks to yourself
        you know that I'm not seeing anyone else
        You just keep your ear down to the ground
        yell your head off if you hear a sound
        Here's a whistle, a badge and a phone
        you can arrest me if I'm not at home
        And if I don't keep my word I swear
        I'll keep away
        Here's some books and a puzzle by Escher
        here's Shakespeare's Measure For Measure
        Here's a balloon, a rubber band and a bag
        why don't you blow them up if you think you've been had
        Here's a castle, a paper dragon and a moat
        an earring, a toothbrush and a cloak
        And if I don't keep my word I swear
        I'll keep away
        I swear I'll keep away, from all we've ever done
        I'll keep away the good times, I'll keep away the fun
        I swear I'll join the army, or maybe the marines
        I'll start to wear designer suits and put away my jeans
        I swear that I'll keep away, from all my old-time friends
        I'll throw away my records, I'll try to make amends
        I swear I'll give up gambling, and playing with the rent
        I'll give up food and drinking, I'll give up a life ill-spent
        Here's a yardstick you can measure me by
        here's a coupon, maybe there's something you want to buy
        Here's a bandied in case you cut your feet
        here's a rubber mallet you can use on your front teeth
        Here's a gun no one uses anymore
        and a bracelet made of some expensive ore
        And if I don't keep my word
        you won't see me anymore
        I swear I'll keep away, from dignity and pride
        I'll keep away from abstracts, I'll keep it all inside
        Well, I'll just wrap me up in butter, and melt me on a shelf
        I'll fry in my own juices, I'll become somebody else
        Well, I'll just swear to keep away, from everything that's good
        I'll lie down in the gutter, where I really should
        I swear I'll light a candle, to every modern foe
        I swear I'll close the book on this, and not see you anymore
        'cause I just got to get away
