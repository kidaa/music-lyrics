They call you ecstasy
        nothing ever sticks to you
        Not velcro, not scotch tape
        not my arms dipped in glue
        Not if I wrap myself in nylon
        a piece of duct tape down my back
        Love pierced the arrow with the twelve
        and I can't get you back
        Ah, ecstasy
        ecstasy
        Ah, ecstasy
        Across the streets an old Ford, they took off its wheels
        the engine is gone
        In its seat sits a box
        with a note that says, Goodbye Charlie, thanks a lot
        I see a child through a window with a bib
        and I think of us and what we almost did
        The Hudson rocketing with light
        the ships pass the Statue of Liberty at night
        They call it ecstasy, ah
        ecstasy
        Ecstasy, ah
        ecstasy
        Some men call me St. Ivory
        some call me St. Maurice
        I'm smooth as alabaster
        with white veins runnin' through my cheeks
        A big stud through my eyebrow
        a scar on my arm that says, Domain
        I put it over the tattoo
        that contained your name
        They called you ecstasy, ecstasy
        ecstasy
        They call you ecstasy, ecstasy
        ecstasy
        The moon passing through a cloud
        a body facing up is floating towards a crowd
        And I think of a time and what I couldn't do
        I couldn't hold you close, I couldn't, I couldn't become you
        They call you ecstasy, I can't hold you down
        I can't hold you up
        I feel like that car that I saw today, no radio
        no engine, no hood
        I'm going to the cafe, I hope they've got music
        and I hope that they can play
        But if we have to part
        I'll have a new scar right over my heart
        I'll call it ecstasy
        Oh, ecstasy, ecstasy
        ecstasy
        Ecstasy, ecstasy
        ecstasy
