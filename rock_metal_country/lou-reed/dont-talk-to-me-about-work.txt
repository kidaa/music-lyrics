A perfect day to get out of bed
        shower, dress, shave, kiss you on the head
        Then I hit the office and my head starts to swim
        A perfect day to just walk around
        see a violent movie, check the sounds
        But even on the street
        when I hear a phone ring my heart starts to beat
        when I get home I don't want you to speak
        Don't talk to me about work
        please don't talk to me about work
        I'm up to my eyeballs in dirt
        with work, with work
        How many dollars, how many sales
        how many liars, how many tales
        How many insults must you take in this one life
        I'm in prison most of the day
        so please excuse me, if I get this way
        But I have got obligations to keep
        so be very careful when you speak
        Don't talk to me about work
        please don't talk to me about work
        I'm up to my eyeballs in dirt
        with work, with work
        Please don't talk to me about work
        don't you talk to me about work
        I'm up to my eyeballs in dirt
        with work, with work
        Don't talk to me about work
        don't you talk to me about work
        Don't you talk to me about work
        please don't talk to me about work
        Don't you talk to me about work
        please don't talk to me about work
        Don't you talk to me about work
        please don't talk to me about work
        Don't you talk to me about work
        please don't talk to me about work
