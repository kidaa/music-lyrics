Yes I am mother nature's son
        and I'm the only one
        I do what I want and I want what I see
        huh, could only happen to me
        I'm so free
        I'm so free
        Oh, please, Saint Germaine
        I have come this way
        Do you remember the shape I was in
        I had horns that bent
        I'm so free
        I'm so free
        Do you remember the silver walks
        you used to shiver and I used to talk
        Then we went down to Times Square
        and ever since I've been hanging around there
        I'm so free
        I'm so free
        Yes I am mother nature's son
        and I'm the only one
        I do what I want and I want what I see
        could only happen to me
        I'm so free
        I'm so free
        Oh, oh, oh, I'm so free
        oh, oh, oh, I'm so free
        Oh, oh, oh, I'm so free
        early in the morning, I'm so free
        Late in the evening, I'm so free
        yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so free
        When I feel good, I'm so free
        when it's in the morning, I'm so free
        When it's in the evening, I'm so free
        I'm so free, I'm so free
        I'm so free, I'm so free
        feel so good, now, I'm so free
        Oh, oh, oh, I'm so free
        yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so free
        Oh, oh, oh, I'm so free
        feel so good, now, I'm so free
        Feel little nice, I'm so free
        feel little down, now, I'm so free
        You're so free, I'm so free
        I'm so free, I'm so free
        I'm so free, I'm so free
        I'm so free, I'm so free
