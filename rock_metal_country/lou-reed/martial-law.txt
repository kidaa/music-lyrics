I've declared a truce, so stop your fighting
        the marshall is in town
        I won't put up with no big mouth yapping
        at least not while I'm around
        This is my friend Ace, he's from the 8th precinct
        nothing goes on that he don't know
        And we've been send cause your arguments
        have been going on for too long
        And before one of you hurts the other one of you
        I'm declaring martial law
        I came, I saw, I declared martial law
        I'm the marshall in the city
        The jails are filled with people like you
        you oughta listen to your diddy-wah-diddy
        What's a girl like you doing with that lamp
        you better drop it down on the floor
        And son, that isn't very smart
        kicking a hole in that door
        Hey, Ace will you take a look at this place
        and get those neighbors out of the hall
        I'm declaring martial law
        I came, I saw, I declared martial law
        'cause I'm the marshall in the city
        And if you stand away, I've got something to say
        that I might even help you
        Keep your hands to yourself and keep your big mouth shut
        don't you touch nobody with hate-hate-hate-hate
        And if all you've got is poison in your mouth
        make sure that you don't speak
        It's 3:30 in the early morning
        don't punch, don't scratch, don't bite
        Try not to take the garbage of the day
        any place but outside
        Now me and Mr. Ace are gonna leave this place
        and this fighting's gonna end
        And if we're called back, I'm gonna knock you flat
        and stack you end to end
        Ah, I came, I saw, I declared martial law
        I'm the marshall in the city
        I came, I saw, I declared martial law
        I'm the marshall in the city, ooohhh
        I came, I saw, I declared martial law
        I'm the marshall in the city
        I came, I saw, I declared martial law
        'cause I'm the marshall in the city
