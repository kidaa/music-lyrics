I'm standing with you on your roof
        looking at the chemical sky
        All purple blue and oranges
        some pigeons flying by
        The traffic on Canal Street's so noisy
        it's a shock
        And someone's shooting fireworks or a gun
        on the next block
        An-an-and, I wanna HookyWooky with you
        I wanna HookyWooky with you
        The traffic's so noisy it's a shock
        sounds like fireworks or a gun on the next block
        Ah, HookyWooky with you
        Your ex-lover Satchel is here from France
        yet another ex
        They gather about you like a Mother Superior
        all of you still friends, but -
        None of my old flames ever talk to me when things
        end for me they end
        They take your pants, your money, your name
        but the song still remains
        An-an-and, I wanna HookyWooky with you
        Ah-ha-ha-ha, I wanna HookyWooky with you
        Then they take your pants, your money, your name
        but the song still remains, sayin' -
        I wanna HookyWooky with you
        You're so civilized it hurts
        I guess I could learn a lot, ha-ha...
        About people, plants and relationships
        how not to get hurt a lot
        And each lover I meet up your roof
        I wouldn't want to throw him off, mmmmm..
        Into the chemical sky, down into the streets to die
        under the wheels of a car on Canal Street
        And each lover I meet up on your roof
        I wouldn't want to throw him off, mmmmm..
        Into the chemical sky
        under the wheels of a car to die on Canal street
        Ah-ah-hi, I wanna, ah, HookyWooky with you
        ah-huh, huh-huh-huh-ah
        I wanna HookyWooky with you
        I wouldn't want to throw him off into the chemical sky
        down into the streets to die
        Under the wheels of a car on Canal street
        Under the wheels of a car on Canal Street
        Under the wheels of a car on Canal Street
        HookyWooky
        Under the wheels of a car on Canal Street
        HookyWooky
        Under the wheels of a car on Canal Street
        Under the wheels of a car on Canal Street
        Hooky-Hooky-Hooky-Wooky
        Under the wheels of a car on Canal Street
        Under the wheels of a car on Canal Street
        Under the wheels of a car on Canal Street
        Under the wheels of a car on Canal Street
