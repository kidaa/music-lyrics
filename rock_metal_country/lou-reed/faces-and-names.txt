Faces and names, I wish they were the same
        faces and names only cause trouble for me
        Faces and names
        If we all looked the same and we all had the same name
        I wouldn't be jealous of you or you jealous of me
        Faces and names
        I always fall in love with someone who looks
        the way I wish that I could be
        I'm always staring at someone who hurts
        and the one they hurt is me
        Faces and names, to me they're all the same
        if I looked like you and you looked like me
        There'd be less trouble you see
        Faces and names, I wish they'd go away
        I'd disappear into that wall and never talk
        Talk, not talk
        I wish I was a robot or a machine
        without a feeling or a thought
        People who want to meet the name I have
        are always disappointed when they meet me
        Faces and names, I wish they were the same
        faces and names only cause problems for me
        Faces and names
        I'd rather be a hole in the wall
        looking out on the other side
        I'd rather look and listen, listen and not talk
        To faces and names
        If I had a breakdown when I was a kid
        I lost my hair when I was young
        If you dress older when you're not
        as your really age you look the same
        If we all looked the same, we wouldn't play these games
        me dressing for you and you dressing for me
        Undressing for me
        Faces and names, if they all were the same
        you wouldn't be jealous of me or me jealous of you
        Me jealous of you, me jealous of you
        Your face and your name
        your face and your name
        Faces and names
        faces and names
