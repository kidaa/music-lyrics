You've got the money, I've got the time
        you want your freedom, make your freedom mine
        'Cause I've got the style it takes
        and money is all that it takes
        You've got connections, I've got the art
        you like attention and I like your looks
        And I have the style it takes
        and you know the people it takes
        Why don't you sit right over there
        we'll do a movie portrait
        I'll turn the camera on
        And I won't even be there
        a portrait that moves, you look great I think
        I'll put the Empire State Building on your wall
        for 24 hours glowing on your wall
        Watch the sun rise above it in your room
        wallpaper art, a great view
        I've got a Brillo box and I say it's art
        it's the same one you can buy at any supermarket
        'Cause I've got the style it takes
        and you've got the people it takes
        This is a rock group called The Velvet Underground
        I show movies on them, do you like their sound
        'Cause they have a style that grates
        and I have art to make
        Let's do a movie here next week
        We don't have sound but you're so great
        you don't have to speak
        You've got the style it takes, kiss
        you've got the style it takes, eat
        You've got the style it takes, couch
        you've got the style it takes, kiss
