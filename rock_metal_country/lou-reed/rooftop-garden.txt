Sitting in our rooftop garden
        looking down below
        Sitting in our rooftop garden
        waiting for the sun
        Isn't it lovely watching
        a plane go by
        What a lovely couple
        are you and I
        Sitting in our rooftop garden
        a few drops of rain
        The lights in the city blinking on
        just the same
        No sugar in my coffee
        how's your tea
        In our rooftop garden
        above the city
        Let's not see any letters
        let's not answer the phone
        Let's just pretend that
        there's no one at home
        In our rooftop garden
        in our rooftop garden
        In our rooftop garden
        up on the roof
