Stupid man, hitch-hiking out of a good life
        in Saskatchewan
        And he thinks he's got big-big planes
        gonna build a house upon some land
        Oh Casey, don't it make you crazy
        oh, when you're living all alone by that damp water
        Oh Casey, don't it make you crazy
        when you're living all alone by those still waters
        Please say hello, please say hello
        to my little baby daughter
        Oh Casey, tell her that her father's gonna be coming home
        so soon, so soon to see her
        Well I'm shooting down the turnpike
        with a driver doing ninety-five or maybe
        more don't you think he's loaded drunk
        or that he thinks that life's a bore
        Casey, oh Casey, don't you know how it makes me so damn crazy
        living all alone by those waters
        But please say hello, but please say hello
        to my little baby daughter
        Please, please, won't you just give her a great big kiss
        then tell her that her stupid daddy will be coming home soon
        Oh Casey, oh Casey, don't you know I make me so damn crazy
        when I was living there all alone by those still waters
        But please tell, please tell my baby-baby-baby daughter
        that I'm tied up now, but I'll be home soon
        and I'll be the daddy that I oughta
        Please say hello, oh Casey, please say hello
        from a stupid man
        Still my little baby daughter a big-big-big kiss
        and tell her that her daddy will be coming home soon
        But Casey, don't you know I make me so damn crazy
        when I was living there all alone
        But won't you please give my, give my baby daughter
        a great big stupid kiss
        and tell her that her stupid father will be coming home soon
        Stupid man
