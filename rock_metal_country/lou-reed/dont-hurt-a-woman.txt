I was angry, I said things I shouldn't say
        but please don't turn your back
        Sometimes I get so upset
        but I take it all back
        Please don't go, I know I was wrong
        Sometimes I don't know what comes over me
        But I try to remember
        don't hurt a Woman
        Don't hurt a Woman
        I was angry, I said things I shouldn't say
        I must have lost control
        Sometimes something clicks in my head
        and I'm not myself anymore
        That wasn't me, you can't believe everything you see
        let's make believe I never said a word
        And I'll try to remember
        don't hurt a Woman
        Try to remember
        don't hurt a Woman
        Try to remember
        don't hurt a Woman
        I'll try to remember
        don't hurt a Woman
        'Cause I lovin' you
        so long
