Betrayed by the one who says she loves you
        by the one who says she needs you
        above all other men
        Betrayed by her fragile, vicious beauty
        her father did his duty
        and I lie down betrayed
        Justice taught her confidence
        her mother was like steel
        her cousins, they're all convicts
        she alone rose above that wheel
        But a motorcyclist no matter how good
        is slave to the oncoming truck
        and the poison of her father was
        her most pitiless luck
        Betrayed by the one who says she loves you
        by the one who says she needs you
        above all other men
        Betrayed by her fragile, vicious beauty
        her father did his duty
        and I lie down betrayed
        Three of us lie in this bed
        night of infamy
        one of us lies on our back
        her father's in her head
        And quick she turns and slaps my face
        and with her eyes open wide she screams
        I hate you, I hate you, I hate you
        but she's looking right past me
        Betrayed by the one who says she loves you
        by the one who says that she needs you
        above all other men
        Betrayed by her fragile, vicious beauty
        her father did his duty
        and I lie down betrayed
        And I lie down betrayed
        I lie down betrayed
