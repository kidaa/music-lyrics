I can't seem to make up my mind
        I can't tell the colors
        That will fit this room
        I can't tell a thing about you make up my mind
        I can't seem to make up my mind
        are you laughing at me
        Or telling a joke, the cigarette on the sheet
        begins to smoke, make up your mind
        Right or left, up or down
        in or out, straight or round
        Love or lust, rain or shine
        I can't seem to make up my poor mind
        I can't seem to make up my mind
        I can't tell the difference between wrong and right
        are you laughing at me in your sleep tonight
        Leaving me behind
        leaving me behind
        Why don't you make up your mind
        I can't seem to make up my mind
        about leaving me, baby
        I can't seem to make up my mind
        I can't seem to make up my mind
        I can't seem to make up my mind
