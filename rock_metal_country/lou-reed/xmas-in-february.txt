Sam was lyin' in the jungle
        agent orange spread against the sky like marmalade
        Hendrix played on some foreign jukebox
        they were praying to be saved
        Those gooks were fierce and fearless
        that's the price you pay when you invade
        Xmas in February
        Sam lost his arm in some border town
        his fingers are mixed with someone's crop
        If he didn't have that opium to smoke
        the pain would never ever stop
        Half his friends are stuffed into black body bags
        with their names printed at the top
        Xmas in February
        Sammy was a short order cook
        in a short order black and blue collar town
        Everybody worked the steel mill
        but the steel mill got closed down
        He thought if he joined the Army
        he'd have a future that was sound
        Like no Xmas in February
        Sam's staring at the Vietnam Wall
        it's been a while now that he's home
        His wife and kid have left, he's unemployed
        he's a reminder of the war that wasn't won
        He's the guy on the street with the sign that reads
        ";Please help send this Vet home";
        But he is home
        and there's no Xmas in February
        no matter how much he saves
