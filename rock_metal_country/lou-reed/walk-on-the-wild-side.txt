Holly came from Miami F.L.A.
        hitch-hiked her way across the U.S.A.
        Plucked her eyebrows on the way
        shaved her leg and then he was a she
        She says, hey babe, take a walk on the wild side
        said, hey honey, take a walk on the wild side
        Candy came from out on the island
        in the backroom she was everybody's darling
        But she never lost her head
        even when she was given head
        She says, hey babe, take a walk on the wild side
        said, hey babe, take a walk on the wild side
        and the coloured girls go

        Little Joe never once gave it away
        everybody had to pay and pay
        A hustle here and a hustle there
        New York city is the place where they said
        Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side
        I Said hey Joe, take a walk on the wild side
        Sugar Plum Fairy came and hit the streets
        lookin' for soul food and a place to eat

        They said, hey Sugar, take a walk on the wild side
        I said, hey babe, take a walk on the wild side
        all right, huh
        Jackie is just speeding away
        thought she was James Dean for a day
