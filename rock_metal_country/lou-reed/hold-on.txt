There's blacks with knives and whites with clubs
        fighting in Howard Beach
        There's no such thing as human rights
        when you walk the N.Y.streets
        A cop was shot in the head by a 10 years old kid
        named Buddah in Central Park last week
        The fathers and daughters are lined up by the coffins
        by the Statue of Bigotry, hey
        You better hold on
        something's happening here
        You better hold on
        well I meet you in Tompkins Square
        The dopers sent a message to the cops last weekend
        they shot him in the car where he sat
        And Eleanor Bumpers and Michael Stewart
        must have appreciated that
        There's a rampaging rage rising up like a plague
        of bloody vials washing up on the beach
        It'll take more than the Angels or Iron Mike Tyson
        to heal this bloody breach, hey, hey
        You better hold on
        something's happening here
        You better hold on
        I'm gonna meet you in Tompkins Square
        A junkie ran down a lady a pregnant dancer
        she'll never dance but the baby was saved
        He shot up some China White and nodded out at the wheel
        and he doesn't remember a thing
        They shot that old lady 'cause they thought she was a witness to
        a crime she didn't even see
        Whose home is the home of the brave
        by the Statue of Bigotry, hey
        You better hold on
        something's happening here
        You better hold on
        meet you in Tompkins Square
        You got a black .38 and a gravity knife
        you still have to ride the train
        There's the smelly essence of N.Y. down there
        but you ain't no Bernard Goetz, ah
        There's no Mafia lawyer to fight in your corner
        for that 15 minutes of fame
        The have and the have nots are bleeding in the tub
        that's New York's future not mine, oh
        You better hold on
        something's happening here
        You better hold on
        you better, something's happening here
        Hold on, ooohhh, babe
