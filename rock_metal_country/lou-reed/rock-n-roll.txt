Jenny said, when she was just five years old
        you know there's nothin' happening at all
        Every time she put on the radio
        there was nothin' goin' down at all
        not at all
        One fine mornin', she puts on a New York station
        and she couldn't believe what she heard at all
        She started dancin' to that fine-fine-fine-fine music
        ooohhh, her life was saved by rock 'n' roll
        hey baby, rock 'n' roll
        Despite all the amputation
        you could dance to a rock 'n' roll station
        And it was all right
        it was all right
        hey babe

        not at all
        One fine morning, she heard on a New York station
        she couldn't believe what she heard at all
        not at all
        Despite the amputation
        you could dance to a rock 'n' roll station
        It was all right
