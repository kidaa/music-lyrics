All your two-bit psychiatrists
        are giving you electroshock
        They said, they'd let you live at home with mom and dad
        instead of mental hospitals
        But every time you tried to read a book
        you couldn't get to page 17
        'Cause you forgot where you were
        so you couldn't even read
        Don't you know they're gonna kill your sons
        don't you know gonna kill, kill your sons
        They're gonna kill, kill your sons
        until they run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run away
        Mom informed me on the phone
        she didn't know what to do about dad
        Took an axe and broke the table
        aren't you glad you're married
        And sister, she got married on the island
        and her husband takes the train
        He's big and he's fat
        and he doesn't even have a brain
        They're gonna kill your sons
        don't you know they're gonna kill, kill your sons
        Don't you know they're gonna kill, kill your sons
        until they run away
        Creedmore treated me very good
        but Paine Whitney was even better
        And when I flipped out on PHC
        I was so sad, I didn't even get a letter
        All of the drugs, that we took
        it really was lots of fun
        But when they shoot you up with thorizene on crystal smoke
        you choke like a son of a gun
        Don't you know they're gonna kill your sons
        don't you know they're gonna kill, kill your sons
        Don't you know they're gonna kill, kill your sons
        until they run, run, run, run, run, run, run away
