How come you say you will and then you won't
        you change your mind and then you say you don't
        The mystery is why I play the goat
        the mystery you call love
        Sometimes you're like an eagle strong like a rock
        other times it seems you get unlocked
        And all your worst fears come tumbling out
        into the street, into the snow
        I remember when you had a dream
        everything was what it seemed to be
        But now nightmares replace everything
        and everything you see is wrong
        You said we'd meet but you're two hours late
        you said you thought someone had picked your gate
        So you hid and were afraid to wait
        seeing shadows in the snow
        Seeing shadows in the snow
        Now your friend Godfrey is a perfect choice
        one minute down next time rejoice, he seems -
        - To have found the perfect voice
        paranoia key of E
        Let's say everything he says is true
        you love me but I cheat on you
        And in my bedroom is a female zoo
        worse then Clinton in prime time
        I swear to you I'm not with Jill or Joyce
        or Cyd or Sherry or Darlene or worse
        I'm not kissing you while inside I curse
        paranoia key of E
        Let's play a game the next time we meet, ah
        I'll be the hands and you be the feet
        And together we will keep the beat
        to paranoia key of E
        Now, you know mania's in the key of B
        psychosis in the key of C
        Let's hope that we're not meant to be
        in paranoia key of E
        Anorexia is in G flat
        and F is anything I've left out
        Dyslexia, kleptomania and vertigo
        patricide A, matricide D the same schizos
        Paranoia key of E
        Let's have a coda in the key of K
        something that only we can play
        Maybe we'll light up like a hundred K
        paranoia out of key
        Paranoia key of E
        paranoia key of E
        Anorexia, dyslexia
        kleptomania, patricide A, matricide D, vertigo, schizos
        Paranoia key of E, paranoia
        paranoia, paranoia, paranoia key of E
        Paranoia, paranoia, paranoia key of E
