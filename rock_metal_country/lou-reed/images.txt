I think images are worth repeating
        images repeated from a painting
        Images taken from a painting
        from a photo worth re-seeing
        I love images worth repeating
        project them upon the ceiling
        multiply them with silk screening
        see them with a different feeling
        Images, oh, images
        images, oh, images
        Some say images have no feeling
        I think there's a deeper meaning
        Mechanical precision or so it's seeming
        instigates a cooler feeling
        I love multiplicity of screenings
        things born anew display new meanings
        I think images are worth repeating
        and repeating and repeating
        Images, oh, images
        images, images
        I'm no urban idiot savant
        spewing paint without any order
        I'm no sphinx, no mystery enigma
        what I paint is very ordinary
        I don't think I'm old or modern
        I don't think I think I'm thinking
        it doesn't matter what I'm thinking
        it's the images that are worth repeating
        And repeating, oh, images
        images
        If you're looking for a deeper meaning
        I'm as deep as this high ceiling
        If you think technique is meaning
        you might find me very simple
        You might think that images boring
        cars and cans and chairs and flowers
        you might find me personally boring
        Hammer, sickle, Mao Tse Tong
        Mao Tse Tong
        ooohhh, images, images
        Images
        I think that it bears repeating
        the images upon the ceiling
        I love images worth repeating
        and repeating and repeating
        Images, images
        oh, images, oh, images
