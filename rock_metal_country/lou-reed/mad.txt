Mad, you just make me mad
        I hate your silent breathing in the night
        Sad, you make me sad
        when I juxtapose your features I get sad
        I know I shouldn't had someone else in our bed
        but I was so tired, I was so tired
        who would think you'd find a bobby pin
        it just makes me mad, makes me mad
        It just makes me, makes me -
        - Mad
        Glad, when I'm gone you're glad
        that overwhelming tension dissipates
        Oh, tad, you think I'm a baby
        nobody likes to here, Why don't you grow up at dawn
        I know I shouldn't had someone else in our bed
        but I was so tired, so tired
        who would think you'd find a bobby pin
        it makes me mad, makes me mad
        Don't you know it just makes me -
        - Mad
        it just makes me mad
        Dumb, you're dumb as my thumb
        in the wistful morning you throw a coffee cup at my head
        Scum, you said I'm scum
        what a very lovely and feminine thing to do
        Bark, why don't you just bark
        sit, come, stay are the perfect words meant for you
        Ah, ass, you says I'm an ass
        you better call 911 just I'm gonna hold you tight
        I know I shouldn't had someone else in our bed
        but I was so tired, so tired
        you said you're out of town for the night
        and I believed in you, I believed you
        And I was so tired, it makes me so mad
        it makes me so -
        - Mad
        it makes me so mad
        It just makes me mad
        it makes me mad
        It makes me mad
        it makes me mad
        It makes me mad
        It makes me mad, ah
        dumb
