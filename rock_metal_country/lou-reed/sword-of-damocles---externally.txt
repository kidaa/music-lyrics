I see The Sword of Damocles
        is right above your head
        They're trying a new treatment
        to get you out of bed
        But radiation kills both bad and good
        it can not differentiate
        So to cure you they must kill you
        the Sword of Damocles hangs above your head
        Now I have seen lots of peoples die
        from car crashes or drugs
        Last night on 33rd st.
        I saw a kid get hit by a bus
        Bus this drawn out torture over which part of you lives
        is very hard to take
        To cure you they must kill you
        the Sword of Damocles above your head
        That mix of morphine and dexedrine
        we use it on the street
        It kills the pain and keeps you up
        your very soul to keep
        But this guessing game has its own rules
        the good don't always win
        And might makes right
        the Sword of Damocles is hanging above your head
        It seems everything's done that must be done
        from over here though things don't seem fair
        But there are things that we can't know
        maybe there's something over there
        Some other world that we don't know about
        I know you hate that mystic shit
        It's just another way of seeing
        the Sword of Damocles above your head
