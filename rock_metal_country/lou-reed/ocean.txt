Here comes the ocean
        and the waves down by the sea
        Here comes the ocean
        and the waves where have they been
        Don't swim tonight my love, the sea is mad my love
        it's known to drive men crazy
        Malcolm has burned at sea, the castle it sits and reeks
        the madness can make you hazy
        But here come the waves
        down by the shore
        Washing the rocks that have been here
        centuries or more
        Down by the sea
        Here come the ocean
        and the waves down by the sea
        Here comes the ocean
        and the waves where have they been
        Castles glowing at night, towers above out fright
        warlocks decapitating
        Malcolm he lives on hate, serve your brain on a plate
        feasts on your mouth for dinner
        But here come the waves
        down by the sea
        Washing the eyes of the men
        who have died
        Down by the sea
        Here come the waves
        Here come the waves
        Here come the waves
        Here come the waves
