All your two-bit friends
        they're shootin' you up with pills
        They said that it was good for you
        that it would cure your ills
        I don't care just where it's at
        I'm just like an alley cat
        And when you're filled up to here with hate
        don't you know you gotta get it straight
        Filled up to here with hate
        beat her black and blue and get it straight
        Do, do, do, do, do, do
        when you're lookin' through the eyes of hate
        All your two-bit friends
        they asked you for your autograph
        They put you on the stage
        they thought it'd be good for a laugh
        But I don't care just where it's at
        'cause honey, I'm just like an alley cat
        And when you're filled up to here with hate
        don't you know you gotta get it straight
        Filled up to here with hate
        beat her black and blue and get it straight
        Uh-huh
        Oh, Jim
        how could you treat me this way
        Hey, hey, hey
        how could you treat me this way
        Oh, Jim
        how could you treat me this way
        Hey, hey
        how could you treat me this way
        You know you broke my heart
        ever since you went away
        Now you said that you love us
        but you only make love to one of us
        Oh, oh, oh, oh, Jim
        how could you treat me this way
        You know you broke my heart
        ever since you went away
        When you're looking through the eyes of hate
        oh, oh, oh, oh
        When you're looking through the eyes of hate
        oh, oh, oh, oh
        When you're looking through the eyes of hate
        oh, oh, oh, oh
        When you're looking through the eyes of hate
        oh, oh, oh, oh
        When you're looking through the eyes of hate
        oh, oh, oh, oh
        When you're looking through the eyes of hate
        oh, oh, oh, oh
