Billy was a good friend of mine
        We grew up together ever since we were nine
        We went to school, he was my best friend
        And I thought our friendship would never end
        In high school he played football
        And me, I didn't do anything at all
        He made touch-downs, while I played pool
        And no one could figure out which one of us was the fool
        Then we both went to collage
        He studied medicine while I studied foliage
        He got A's and I got D's
        He was going for his Ph.D.
        Then I decided to drop out
        Things were getting a little too hot
        Billy stayed there, became an intern and then a doctor
        Then war broke out and he had to go
        But not me, I was mentally unfit, or so they say, so, so
        When he came back, he wasn't quite the same
        His nerves were shot, but not me
        Last time I saw him, I couldn't take it anymore
        He wasn't the Billy I knew, it was like talking to a door
        Billy was a friend of mine
        I grew up with him ever since I was nine
        We went together through school
        And now I often wonder, which one of us was the fool
