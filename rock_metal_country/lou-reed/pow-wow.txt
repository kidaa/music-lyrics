Christopher Columbus discovered America
        found he had a cornucopia
        Gave love to the Indians, they gave it back
        a pow wow in the teepee is where it's at
        I want to dance with you
        I want to dance with you
        I want to dance with you
        I want to dance with you
        The Indian fought with his arrow and bow
        till General Custer lost to Sitting Bull
        Scalped all day and scalped all night
        give me fire water, gonna buy me a wife
        I want to dance with you
        I want to dance with you
        I want to dance with you
        I want to dance with you
        When your people first moved to our block
        our ancestors met with culture shock
        Two different monkeys from two different trees
        come on let's stop our fightin' and come dance with me
        Come on dance with me
        come on and dance with me
        'Cause I really wanna dance with you
        I want to dance with you
        come on and dance with me
