Magician, Magician
        take me upon your wings, and
        gently roll the clouds away
        I'm sorry, so sorry
        I have no incantations
        only words to help sweep me away
        I want some magic to sweep me away
        I want some magic to sweep me away
        I want to count to five
        turn around and find myself gone
        Fly through the storm
        and wake up in the calm
        Release me from this body
        from this bulk that moves beside me
        Let me leave this body far away
        I'm sick of looking at me
        I hate this painful body
        that disease has slowly worm away
        Magician take my spirit
        inside I'm young and vital
        Inside I'm alive, please take me away
        So many things to do, it's too early
        for my life to be ending
        For this body, to simply rot away
        I want some magic to keep me alive
        I want a miracle, I don't want to die
        I'm afraid that if I go to sleep I'll never wake
        I'll no longer exist
        I'll close my eyes and disappear
        and float into the mist
        Somebody, please hear me
        my hand can't hold a cup of coffee
        My fingers are weak, things just fall away
        Inside I'm young and pretty
        too many things unfinished
        My very breath taken away
        Doctor you're no magician
        and I am no believer
        I need more than faith can give me now
        I want to believe in miracles
        not just belief in numbers
        I need some magic to take me away
        I want some magic to sweep me away
        I want some magic to sweep me away
        Visit on this starlit night
        replace the stars the moon the light, the sun's gone
        Fly me through this storm
        and wake up in the calm
        I fly right through this storm
        and I wake, up, in, the, calm
