When you're in a dream
        and you think you got your problems all nailed down
        Pieces of the scheme
        seem to rattle up and then to rattle down
        And when you start to fall
        and those footsteps they start to fade
        Well then you know you're going down
        yeah, you're falling all around
        And you know you're going down
        for the last time
        When you're in the air
        and you're thinking you'll drift off into the west
        Your friends polite, advise
        hey look you're pushing too hard
        and perhaps you need a rest
        And when you start to fall
        and all those footsteps they start to fade
        Then you know you're going down
        yeah, you're crashing upside down
        And you know you're going down
        for the last -
        - Time's not what it seems
        it just seems longer, when you're lonely in this world
        Everything it seems
        would be brighter if your nights were spent with some girl
        Yeah, you're falling all around
        yeah, you're crashing upside down
        Oh, oh, and you know you're going down
        for the last time
