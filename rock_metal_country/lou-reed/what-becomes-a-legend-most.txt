What becomes a legend most
        when she's alone in a hotel lobby
        What becomes a legend most
        some bad champagne and some foreign bottled beer
        What becomes a legend most
        when the musicians have come and then leave her
        What becomes a legend most
        besides being a legendary star
        What becomes a legend most
        lying in bed cold and regal
        What becomes a legend most
        lying in bed watching a talk show on TV
        What becomes a legend most
        fifty days in fifty cities
        And everyone says she looks pretty
        at least as pretty as a legend should
        Fifty days can wear you down
        fifty cities flying by
        A different man in each different hotel
        and if you're not careful, word can get around
        What becomes a legend most
        not a bed, that is half empty
        Not a heart, that is left empty
        that's not pretty, not pretty at all
        What becomes a legend most
        when she's lying in her hotel room
        What becomes a legend most
        well baby, tonight it's you tonight it's you
        Baby, tonight it's you
        What becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la Baby, it's you
        what becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la maybe tomorrow
        What becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la Baby, it's you
        what becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la
        What becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la
        what becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la
        What becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la
        what becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la
