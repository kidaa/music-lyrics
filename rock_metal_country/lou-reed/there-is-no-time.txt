This is no time for Celebration
        this is no time for Shaking Heads
        This is no time for Backslapping
        this is no time for Marching Bands
        This is no time for Optimism
        this is no time for Endless Thought
        This is no time for my country Right or Wrong
        remember what that brought
        There is no time
        there is no time
        There is no time
        there is no time
        This is no time for Congratulations
        this is no time to Turn Your Back
        This is no time for Circumlocution
        this is no time for Learned Speech
        This is no time to Count Your Blessings
        this is no time for Private Gain
        This is no time to Put Up or Shut Up

        There is no time
        there is no time
        There is no time
        there is no time
        This is no time to Swallow Anger
        this is no time to Ignore Hate
        This is no time to be Acting Frivolous
        because the time is getting late
        This is no time for Private Vendettas
        this is no time to not know who you are
        Self knowledge is a dangerous thing
        the freedom of who you are
        This is no time to Ignore Warnings
        this is no time to Clear the Plate
        Let's not be sorry after the fact
        and let the past become out fate
        There is no time
        there is no time
        There is no time
        there is no time
        This is no time to turn away and drink
        or smoke some vials of crack
        This is a time to gather force
        and take dead aim and Attack
        This is no time for Celebration
        this is no time for Saluting Flags
        This is no time for Inner Searchings

        This is no time for Phony Rhetoric
        this is no time for Political Speech
        This is a time for Action
        because the future's Within Reach
        This is the time
        this is the time
        This is the time
        because there is no time
        There is no time
        there is no time
        There is no time
        there is no time
