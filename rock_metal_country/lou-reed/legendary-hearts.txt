Legendary hearts
        tearing up apart
        with stories of their love
        their great transcendent loves
        While we stand here and fight
        and lose another night
        of legendary love
        Legendary loves
        haunt me in my sleep
        promises to keep
        I never should have made
        I can't live up to this
        I'm good for just a kiss
        not legendary love
        Romeo, oh, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo
        he's in a car or at a bar
        or churning his blood with an impure drug
        He's in the past and seemingly lost forever
        He worked hard at being good
        but his basic soul was stained not pure
        and when he took his bow
        no audience was clapping
        Legendary hearts
        tear us all apart
        make our emotions bleed
        crying out in need
        No legendary love
        is coming from above
        it's in this room right now
        And you've got to fight
        to make what's right
        you've got to fight
        to make what's right
        You've got to fight
        to make what's right
        you've got to fight to keep your legendary love
