Andy was a Catholic
        the ethic ran through his bones
        He lived alone with his mother
        collecting gossip and toys
        Every Sunday when he went to Church
        he'd kneel in his pew and say
        It's work
        all that matters is work
        He was a lot of things
        what I remember most he'd say
        I've got to bring home the bacon
        someone's got to bring home the roast
        He'd get to the factory early
        if you'd ask him he'd tell you straight out
        It's work
        No matter what I did it never seemed enough
        he said I was lazy, I said I was young
        He said, How many songs did you write
        I'd written zero, I'd lied and said, Ten
        You won't be young forever
        you should have written fifteen
        It's work
        You ought to make things big
        people like it that way
        And the songs with the dirty words
        make sure your record them that way
        Andy liked to stir up trouble
        he was funny that way
        He said, It's just work
        Andy sat down to talk one day
        he said decide what you want
        Do you want to expand your parameters
        or play museums like some dilettante
        I fired him on the spot
        he got red and called me a rat
        It was the worst word that he could think of
        and I've never seen him like that
        It's work
        I thought he said it's just work
        Andy said a lot of things
        I stored them all away in my head
        Sometimes when I can't decide what I should do
        I think what would Andy have said
        He'd probably say you think too much
        that's 'cause there's work that you don't want to do
        It's work
        the most important thing is work
        It's work
        the most important thing is work
