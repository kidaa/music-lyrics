I got hearts, ah, in my looney tunes
        I got dreams and you do, too
        I got ten wheel drive
        to pick you up, up to your ears, oh
        I got refined carbon in my eyelids, dear
        I've got no one to love and no one to fear
        You better walk it
        and talk it less you lose that beat
        You better lose yourself mama
        and knock yourself right off of your feet
        If you're moving too fast
        don't you want it to last
        You better walk it, talk it
        you better walk it as you talk it less you lose that beat
        oh
        I've got dimes in my shoes real nice
        I've got bells that are laid on ice
        I got dreams
        let me mix it with a little gin
        I got cool when I'm cold and warm when I'm hot
        but me is the one thing baby, you ain't got
        You got to walk it
        and talk it less you lose that beat
        You better lose yourself mama
        and knock yourself right off of your feet
        Yeah, if you're moving too fast
        now don't you want it to last, ah
        You better walk it, talk it
        you better walk it as you talk it less you lose that beat
        You better walk it
        and talk it less you lose that beat
        You better lose yourself mama
        and knock yourself right off of your feet
        Yeah, if you're moving too fast
        now don't you want it to last
        You better walk it, talk it
        you better walk it as you talk it less you lose that beat
        Ah-ha-ha
        oh, all right, ooohhh
