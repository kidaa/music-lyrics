The snow is falling,it's Christmas Eve 
Presents are wrapped under the tree 
Is there one for me 

I only you want for Christmas baby 
I don't need nothing else 
I only you want for Christmas baby 
Tie a ribbon around yourself 
Oh, Tie a ribbon around yourself 

I ain't gonna write no letter 
To send north to the Pole 
'Cause what I'm wanting this year 
St.Nick don't need to know 

Chorus 

So put on your Christmas stockings 
I'll find that mistletoe 
Let's get into the holiday spirits 
Honey ho ho ho 
Ho ho ho 

Chorus
