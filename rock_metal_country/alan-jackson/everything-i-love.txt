Coffee keeps me up and I can't sleep 
And when I drink too much then I can't eat 
Losing you has led me to believe 
Everything I love is killing me 

Everything I love is killing me 
Cigarettes, Jack Daniels and caffeine 
And that's the way you're turning out to be 
Everything I love, gonna have to give up 
'Cause everything I love is killing me 

I guess I made a big mistake 
Thinkin' you're a habit I can break 
Well, I'm addicted to you now I see 
Everything I love is killing me 

Everything I love is killing me 
Cigarettes, Jack Daniels and caffeine 
And that's the way you're turning out to be 
Everything I love, gonna have to give up 
'Cause everything I love is killing me 
Everything I love, gonna have to give up 
'Cause everything I love is killing me
