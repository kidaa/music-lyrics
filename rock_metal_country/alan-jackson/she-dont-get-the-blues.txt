Well she puts her dancing shoes on every night 
And comes alive there in the smoke beneath the neon lights 
And she don't like those hurtin' songs 
Cause she's already lived 'em 
She checks her broken heart there at the door 
She ain't looking for romance, she danced that dance before 
Well I pity the next poor fool that get caught up in her rhythm
Cause she don't get the blues, she gives 'em 

She's been on the losing end of love too many times 
And she ain't gonna go for anything you've got in mind 
So before you start let me impart 
These few words of wisdom 
She don't get the blues, she gives 'em 

Chorus

She don't give the blues, she gives 'em
