I woke up the other night 
Lying on the floor 
Right beside someone 
I've never seen before 
She said my name's Juliet 
And Romeo you ain't 
That's another good reason not to drink 

That's another good reason not to drink 
When I'm sober I'm almost a saint 
If I keep going on like this 
I'll end up like ole Hank 
That's another good reason not to drink 

I cant go see my best friend 
He said stay away 
Just because of what I said 
On his wedding day 
He oughta call a sherman 
Cause she looks just like a tank 
That's another good reason not to drink 

That's another good reason not to drink 
When I'm sober I'm almost a saint 
If I keep going on like this 
I'll end up like ole Hank 
That's another good reason not to drink 

I'm gonna sue to city 
About that policeman 
Last night as I left the bar 
He stepped right on my hand 
He said 'Are you drunk or blind?' 
I said 'Let me think'. 
That's another good reason not to drink 

That's another good reason not to drink 
When I'm sober I'm almost a saint 
If I keep going on like this 
I'll end up like ole Hank 
That's another good reason not to drink 

That's another good reason not to drink 
When I'm sober I'm almost a saint 
If I keep going on like this 
I'll end up like ole Hank 
That's another good reason 
Baby let me in I'm freezing 
Another good reason not to drink
