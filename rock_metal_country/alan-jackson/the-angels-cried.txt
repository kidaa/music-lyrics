written by Harley Allen and Deborah Nims 

They came from near,they came from far 
Following a distance star to where He lay 
Not being sure of what it mean,but 
Knowing it was their way 

And the creatures gathered 'round 
And didn't make a sound 
And the angels cried 

The angels knew what was to come 
The reason God had sent His son 
From up above 
It filled their hearts with joy to see and 
Knowing of His destiny 
Came tears of love 

I've often thought about that night 
And wondered if they realized 
That star so bright 
Was sent to tell all the land 
The Son of God would soon become 
The Son of Man 

Chorus 

And the Angel Cried 
And the Angel Cried
