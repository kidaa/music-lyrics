Well I was rollin' wheels and shiftin' gears 
'Round that Jersey Turnpike 
When Barney stopped me with his gun 
Ten minutes after midnight 
Said sir you broke the limit in that rusty ol' truck 
I don't know about that accent son 
Just where do you come from 

I said where I come from 
It's cornbread and chicken 
Where I come from a lotta front porch sittin' 
Where I come from tryin' to make a livin' 
And workin' hard to get to heaven 
Where I come from 

Well I was south of Detroit City 
I pulled in this country kitchen 
To try their brand of barbecue 
The sign said finger-lickin' 
Well I paid the tab and the lady asked me 
How'd I like my biscuit 
I'll be honest with you ma'am 
It ain't like mama fixed it 

'Cause where I come from 
It's cornbread and chicken 
Where I come from a lotta front porch pickin' 
Where I come from tryin' to make a livin' 
Workin' hard to get to heaven 
Where I come from 

I was chasin' sun on 101 
Somewhere around Ventura 
I lost a universal joint and I had to use my finger 
This tall lady stopped and asked 
If I had plans for dinner 
Said no thanks ma'am, back home 
We like the girls that sing soprano 

'Cause where I come from 
It's cornbread and chicken 
Where I come from a lotta front porch sittin' 
Where I come from tryin' to make a livin' 
Workin' hard to get to heaven 
Where I come from 

Well I was headed home on 65 
Somewhere around Kentucky 
The CB rang for a bobtail rig 
That's rollin' on like thunder 
Well I answered him and he asked me 
Aren't you from out in Tulsa 
No, but you might have seen me there 
I just dropped a load of salsa 

Where I come from it's cornbread and chicken 
Where I come from a lotta back porch pickin' 
Where I come from tryin' to make a livin' 
Workin' hard to get to heaven 
Where I come from 
Where I come from 
Yeah where I come from 
A lotta front porch sitting 
Starin' up at heaven 
Where I come from 
Where I come from 
Tryin' to make a livin' 
Tryin' to make a livin' 
Oh, where I come from 
Where I come from 
Yeah, where I come from 
Get back down there sometime 
Where I come from
