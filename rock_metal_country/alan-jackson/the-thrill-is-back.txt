Well I'm ready to raise the blinds in this place 
Think I'll rejoin the human race 
You said yes, now you're wearing my ring 
Guess I can stop playin' ol' B.B. King 

'Cause the thrill is back, the heartache's gone 
Time stands still, baby love lives on 
The room spins around, when you're kissin' me 
The thrill is back like it used to be 

I sure could use a haircut and shave 
Now that I'm crawling outta my cave 
Since you said we were through 
I've been down with a case of the blues 

But the thrill is back, the heartache's gone 
Time stands still, baby love lives on 
The room spins around, when you're kissin' me 
The thrill is back like it used to be 

I think I'd better give my doctor a call 
And tell him I won't need that Prozac after all 

Yeah the thrill is back, the heartache's gone 
Time stands still, baby love lives on 
The room spins around, when you're kissin' me 
The thrill is back like it used to be 

The room spins around, when you're kissin' me 
The thrill is back like it used to be
