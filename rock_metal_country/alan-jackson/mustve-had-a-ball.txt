Well I must've had a ball last night 
I can't recall what even started out fight 
I must've drank away my blues 
'Cause I don't remember losing you 
Well I must've done the town up right 
'Cause this morning my hats just a little too tight 
There ain't no way of knowing 
But all the signs are showing 
I must've had a ball last night 

Well I woke up this morning underneath my bed 
And someone's in the kitchen sink 
With cowboy boots on and nothing else at all 
Except my hat turned backway on her head 

Well I must've had a ball last night 
I can't recall what even started out fight 
I must've drank away my blues 
'Cause I don't remember losing you 
Well I must've done the town up right 
'Cause this morning my hats just a little too tight 
There ain't no way of knowing 
But all the signs are showing 
I must've had a ball last night 

Well my picture's on the table, someone tore it right in two 
Well who'd do such a crazy thing 
Someone took your suitcase and your little car 
And I hate it 'cause the tires are new 

Well I must've had a ball last night 
I can't recall what even started out fight 
I must've drank away my blues 
'Cause I don't remember losing you 
Well I must've done the town up right 
'Cause this morning my hats just a little too tight 
There ain't no way of knowing 
But all the signs are showing 
I must've had a ball last night 
Well I must've done the town up right 
'Cause this morning my hats just a little too tight 
There ain't no way of knowing 
But all the signs are showing 
I must've had a ball last night 
Well, there ain't way knowing 
But all the signs are showing 
I must've had a ball last night
