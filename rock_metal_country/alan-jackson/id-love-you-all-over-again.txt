Has it been ten years 
Since we said "I do" 
I've always heard marriage made one seem like two 
But you're looking better than you did back then 
You still make this old heart give in 

Chorus
And if I had it to do all over 
I'd do it all over again 
If tomorrow I found one more chance to begin 
I'd love you all over again 

The preacher man said "Til death do us part" 
That seemed like forever to a young man's heart 
Now the days seem much shorter 
The longer we love 
And the memories just keep adding up 

repeat chorus 

If tomorrow I found one more chance to begin 
I'd love you all over again
