You say your heart's been broken 
And you just can't win 
You say that you'll never love again 
Let me tell you friend 

You can't give up on love 
That's the one thing we've got to keep going 
'Cause it don't come easy and it's so hard to hold 
But you can't give up on love 

Looked out my window and what did I see 
It's another broken family 
The kids are stayin' with mama at home 
Daddy's livin' in a house all alone 

You can't give up on love 
That's the one thing we've got to keep going 
'Cause it don't come easy and it's so hard to hold 
But you can't give up on love 

Troubled times make it hard to stay 
So many lovers take the easy way 
But don't go crazy and jump ship too soon 
'Cause every day can't be a honeymoon 

You can't give up on love 
That's the one thing we've got to keep going 
'Cause it don't come easy and it's so hard to hold 
But you can't give up on love 
No, you can't give up on love 
Oh, you can't give up on love
