Wish I were down, on some blue batou 
With a bamboo cane stuck in the sand 
But the road I'm on, don't seem to go there 
So I just dream, keep on being the way I am

Wish I enjoyed, what makes my living 
And what I do, with a willing hand 
Some would run, but that ain't like me 
So, I just dream, keep on being the way I am 

chorus
The way I am, don't fit my shackles 
The way I am, reality 
I can almost see, that bobber dancin' 
So,I just dream, keep on being the way I am 

chorus

Yeah, I just dream, and keep on being the way I am
