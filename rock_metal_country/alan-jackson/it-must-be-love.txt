First I get cold and hot 
Think I'm on fire, but I'm not. 
Oh, what a pain I've got, 
It must be love 

There's nothing I can do, 
All that I want is you. 
Look what I'm going through, 
It must be love 

It must be love, it must be love. 
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove. 
You must be the dream I been dreaming of, 
Oh what a feeling, it must be love 

Something is wrong or right, 
I think of you all night. 
Can't sleep 'til morning light, 
It must be love 

Seeing you in my dreams, 
Holding you close to me. 
Oh, what else can it be? 
It must be love 

It must be love, it must be love. 
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove. 
You must be the dream I been dreaming of 
Oh what a feeling, it must be love.
