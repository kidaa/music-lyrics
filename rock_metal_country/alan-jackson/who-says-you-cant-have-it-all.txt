A stark naked light bulb hangs over my head 
There's one lonely pillow on my double bed 
I've got a ceiling, a floor and four walls 
Who says you cant have it all 

My room's decorated with pictures of you 
Your letters wallpaper this shrine to the blues 
I've got precious memories at my beck and call 
Who says you cant have it all 

I've got everything a broken heart needs 
I'm doing fine don't you worry about me 
Cause I'm lord and master 
Of a fools Taj Mahal 
Who says you cant have it all 

Oh who says you cant have it all
