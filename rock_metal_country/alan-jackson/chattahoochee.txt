Way down yonder on the Chattahoochee 
It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie 
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt 
Got a little crazy but we never got caught 

Chorus

Down by the river on a Friday night 
Pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight 
Talking 'bout cars and dreamin' 'bout women 
Never had a plan, just a livin' for the minute 
Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee 
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me 
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was 
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love 

Well we fogged up the windows in my old Chevy 
I was willin' but she wasn't ready 
So I settled for a burger and a grape sno-cone 
I dropped her off early but I didn't go home 

Chorus
