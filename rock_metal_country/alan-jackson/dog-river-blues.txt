Well I first kissed you on a hollow log 
Down by the river they call the Dog 
We fell in love and we wowed that day 
Like the flow of the river our love won't change 
Well we married that spring and we built a house 
On the bank of the river where the rock juts out 
Now the river's still here but you're long gone 
You left me and the river here all alone 

Chorus
I got the Dog river blues 
I've walked holes in both my shoes 
Now I still got the river but I ain't got you 
I got the Dog river blues 

Well the rain came down and the river rose up 
Filled up the cab on my pickup truck 
It came in the house and down the hall 
And washed your picture right off the wall 

Chorus

Well my heart still yearns and the river still rolls 
And I pray someday it'll bring you home 
So if you change your mind honey I'll be here 
Waiting on the banks of that ol' Dog River 

Chorus
