Everywhere you look you can write a book 
On the trouble of a woman and a man 
But you can not impose you can't stick your nose 
Into something that you don't understand 

But still you wonder 
Who's cheatin' who, who's being true 
Who don't even care anymore 
It makes you wonder 
Who's doing right with someone tonight 
And who's car is parked next door 

I thought I knew her well I really couldn't tell 
That she had another lover on her mind 
You see it felt so right when she held me tight 
How could I be so blind 

But still you wonder 
Who's cheatin' who, who's being true 
Who don't even care anymore 
It makes you wonder 
Who's doing right with someone tonight 
And who's car is parked next door 

A heart is on the line each and every time 
Love is stolen in the shadows of the night 
Though it's wrong all along it keeps going on 
As long as you keep in outta sight 

But still you wonder 
Who's cheatin' who, who's being true 
Who don't even care anymore 
It makes you wonder 
Who's doing right with someone tonight 
And who's car is parked next door
