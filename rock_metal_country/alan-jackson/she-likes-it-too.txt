I got my first motorcycle when I turned sixteen 
I remember my mama raisin cane with me 
She said, "Son tell me why you want to ride that thing" 
She didn't know about the blonde at the Dairy Queen 

I got my own reasons why I do what I do 
I like to ride motorcycles 
She likes it too 
I like to ride motorcycles 
She likes it too 

I always wore my hair just a little too long 
Daddy didn't like it and he made no bones 
If I'd have gotten it cut like he wanted me to 
She wouldn't have had nothin left to run her fingers through 

I got my reasons why I do what I do 
I like to wear my hair long 
She likes it too 
I like to wear my hair long 
She likes it too 

I remember ridin around with my buddies back home 
Listenin to some country on the radio 
When they tried to change the startion to some rock n roll 
I'd turn the Opry up just as loud as it would go 

I got my reasons why I do what I do 
I like country music 
She likes it too 
I like country music 
She likes it too 

I got my own reasons 
Why I do what I do 
I know what I like 
She likes it too 
I know what I like 
She likes it too 

Yeah I know what I like 
And she likes it too
