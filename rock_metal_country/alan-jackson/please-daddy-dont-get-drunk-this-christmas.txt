"Please Daddy don't get drunk this Christmas 
I don't want to see my Momma cry 
Please Daddy don't get drunk this Christmas 
I don't want my Momma cry 

Just last year when I was only seven 
Now I'm almost eight, as you can see 
You came home a quarter past eleven 
And fell down underneath
our Christmas tree 

Chorus

"Please Daddy don't get drunk this Christmas 
I don't want to see my Momma cry 
Please Daddy don't get drunk this Christmas 

"Please Daddy don't get drunk this Christmas 
I don't want to see my Momma cry 
Please Daddy don't get drunk this Christmas 
I don't want my Momma cry 

"Please Daddy don't get drunk this Christmas 
I don't want to see my Momma cry 
Please Daddy don't get drunk this Christmas 
I don't want my Momma cry 

I don't want my Momma cry 

Mama smiled and looked 
Outside the window 
She told me son 
You better go upstairs Then you laughed and hollered 
"Merry Christmas" 
I turned around and saw 
My Momma's tears 
Chorus
No,I don't want to see my Momma cry
