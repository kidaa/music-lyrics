I like my steak well done, my taters fried 
Football games on Monday night 
It's just who I am 
A meat and potato man 

I like my coffee black 
Ol' TV shows 
My women hot and my beer ice cold 
It's just who I am 
A meat and potato man 

I like my fishin' holes, lightnin' bugs 
Flatt n' Scruggs, and my woman's love 
It's just who I am 
A meat and potato man 

I like my Wrangler jeans, cowboy boots 
Cornbread and beans and country roots 
It's just who I am 
A meat and potato man 

I don't like politics, hypocrites 
Folks with poodles dressed like kids 
I'm a hounddog fan 
A meat and potato man yeah, that's what I am 
A meat and potato man
