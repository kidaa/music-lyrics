Some people have it, some people don't
Some people never will
Sometimes it's hard to know when you've got it
Sometimes it's perfectly clear

Well I know it's out there I've seen it happen
I know the way it should feel
Cause there's no mistakin'
That good kind of achin'
Of a once in a lifetime love

Once in a lifetime love
A love like we've all dreamed of
It may go disguised or right before your eyes
A once in a lifetime love

So if you think you've got it
If you feel it inside you
Don't let it slip away
Cause you may not ever find what you never
Thought you'd have anyway
And if you've always had it and just realized
You know how lucky you are
To wake up beside what some never find
A once in a lifetime love

Once in a lifetime love
A love like we've all dreamed of
It may go disguised or right before your eyes
A once in a lifetime love

It may go disguised or right before you eyes
A once in a lifetime love
