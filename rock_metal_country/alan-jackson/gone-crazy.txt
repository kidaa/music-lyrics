Here I am all alone again tonight 
In this old empty house 
It's hard to learn what you don't think you need 
You can't live without 
Never leave the sound of the telephone 
But ever since you left 
I've been gone 

Chorus
Gone carzy, goin' out of my mind 
I've asked myself the reasons, 
at least least thousand times 
Goin' up and down this hallway 
Tryin' to leave the pain behind 
Ever since you left, I've been gone 

I never saw your face this many times 
When you were really here 
The things you said I never understood 
Are now crystal clear 
I never spent this much time at home 
But ever since you left, 
I've been gone 

Chorus
