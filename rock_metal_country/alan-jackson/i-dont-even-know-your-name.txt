Well I was sitting in a roadhouse down on highway 41 
You were wiping off some ketchup on a table that was done 
I know you didn't see me, I was in a corner booth 
Of course you weren't my waitress mine was missing her front tooth 
So I flagged you down for coffee 
But I couldn't say a thing 
But I'm in love with you baby and I don't even know your name 

I'm in love with you baby, I don't even know your name 
I've never been to good at all these sexual games 
So maybe it's just better if we leave it this way 
I'm in love with you baby and I don't even know your name 

So I ordered straight tequila, a little courage in a shot 
I asked you for a date and then I asked to tie the knot 
I got a little wasted, yeah I went a little far 
But I finally got to hug you when you helped me to my car 
The last thing I remember I heard myself say 
I'm in love with you baby, I don't even know your name 

I'm in love with you baby, I don't even know your name 
I've never been to good at all these sexual games 
So maybe it's just better if we leave it this way 
I'm in love with you baby and I don't even know your name 

The next thing I remember, I was hearing wedding bells 
Standing by a woman in a long white lacy veil 
I raised the veil, she smiled at me without her left front tooth 
And I said 'Where the heel am I and just who the hell are you?' 
She said 'I was your waitress and our last name's now the same' 
'Cause I;m married to you baby and I don't even know your name 

I'm married to a waitress, I don't even know her name 
I've never been to good at all these sexual games 
I never thought my love life would quite turn out this way 
Hey I'm married to a waitress and I don't even know her name
