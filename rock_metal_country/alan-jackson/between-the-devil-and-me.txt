This world can take you by the hand 
And tempt the soul of any man 
But you can choose your path 
There's two roads you can take 
One way is right and one is wrong 
The flesh is weak but love is strong 
And she's all I see 
Between the devil and me 

The gates of hell swing open 
Wide invitin' me to stop inside 
I'll be your friend he calls 
Again, I know it's him 
The flames are spreadin everywhere 
But through the smoke 
I see her there 
She's all I see 
Between the devil and me 

I hold her in my arms tonight 
So safe and warm I close my eyes 
And a cool breeze blows 
'Cross our bodies in the dark 
Outside her reach is my concern 
Somewhere I know a fire burns 
And she's all I see 
Between the devil and me 

The gates of hell swing open 
Wide invitin' me to stop inside 
I'll be your friend he calls 
Again, I know it's him 
The flames are spreadin everywhere 
But through the smoke 
I see her there 
She's all I see 
Between the devil and me 

The gates of hell swing open 
Wide invitin' me to step inside 
She's all I see 
Between the devil and me
