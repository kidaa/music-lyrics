Love for me hasn't been easy
I've let true love fall to the ground
Through the years and the tears
I've learned what love's about
And this time I'll be ready
When love comes around

When love comes around I'll be ready
Love will find me a brand new man
And I'll be standing here
With my heart in my hand
This time I'll be ready
When love comes around

Too many times I've lost a good love
And I can see now I let it down
But if love comes back to me
It won't see the same old me
This time I'll be ready
When love comes around

When love comes around I'll be ready
Love will find me a brand new man
And I'll be standing here
With my heart in my hand
This time I'll be ready
When love comes around

Yeah, I'll be standing here
With my heart in my hand
This time I'll be ready
When love comes around
