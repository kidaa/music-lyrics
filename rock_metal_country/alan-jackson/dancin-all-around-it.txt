1. She said I don't usually dance this close to stangers 
You know a girl can't be too careful with her heart 
But I saw you and thought that you looked harmless 
When you smile that way I'm not so sure you are 

2. I said I don't usually come here for the dancin', 
You can tell that by the way I move, When I saw you 
I thought that it was hopeless 
And I just had to ask you for a dance or two 

Chorus:
Somewhere in the stars it must be written, 
Girl we've got to take this chance that we've been given, 
If there's a heaven here on Earth 
I think we found it 
If this ain't love, we're dancin' all around it. 

Bridge:
Music stopped and we're still holdin' each other, 
This feels like the beginning of forever, 

Repeat Chorus 

Outro:
She said I don't usually dance this close to strangers
