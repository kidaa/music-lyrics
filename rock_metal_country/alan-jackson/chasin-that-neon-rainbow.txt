Daddy won a radio 
Tuned it to a country show 
I was rocking in the cradle to the crying of a steel guitar 
Mama used to sing to me 
She taught me that sweet harmony 
Now she worries 'cause she never thought 
I'd ever really take it this far 
Singing in the bars and 

Chasin' the neon rainbow 
Livin' that honky tonk dream 
'Cause all I've ever wanted 
Is too pick this guitar and sing 
Just trying to be somebody 
Just wanna be heard and seen 
Chasin' that neon rainbow 
Livin' that honky tonk dream 

An atlas and a coffe cup 
Five pickers in an old Dodge truck 
Heading down to Houston for a show on Saturday night 
This overhead is killing me 
Half the time I sing for free 
But when the crowd's into it 
Lord it makes this thing I doing seem right 
Standing in the spotlight 

Chasin' the neon rainbow 
Livin' that honky tonk dream 
'Cause all I've ever wanted 
Is too pick this guitar and sing 
Just trying to be somebody 
Just wanna be heard and seen 
Chasin' that neon rainbow 
Livin' that honky tonk dream 

Daddy's got a radio 
He won it thrity years ago 
He said 'Son I just now we're gonna hear you singing on it someday' I 
made it up to Music Row Lordy don't the wheels turn slow But I wouldn't 
trade a minute I wouldn't have it any other way Just show me to the 
stage

I'm chasin' the neon rainbow 
Livin' that honky tonk dream 
'Cause all I've ever wanted 
Is too pick this guitar and sing 
Just trying to be somebody 
Just wanna be heard and seen 
Chasin' that neon rainbow 
Livin' that honky tonk dream 
I'm chasin' the neon rainbow 
Livin' that honky tonk dream
