Love's a gamble every heart will take 
You roll the dice in hopes that it won't break 
One night I bet on your blue eyes and took a chance 
And won a whole lot more than one night of romance 

I won the ace of hearts,that night in the dark 
How lucky can one man be 
I hold the winning hand any way life deals the cards 
No way to lose, cause I've got you my ace of hearts 

Love's a numbered wheel you have to spin 
There's no need for me to spin again 
Cause loving you is paying off more than I knew 
I took a little risk and hit it big with you 

Chorus
