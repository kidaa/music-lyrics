Ba bom bom 
It's alright to be a redneck 
It's alright to drive around in a dirty ol' truck 
Catch a bunch of fish and shoot a bunch of duck 
It's alright to be a redneck 
Chase around the girls on Friday night 
You wanna make'em feel alright 

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright to be a redneck 
It's alright to be a redneck 
It's alright to work hard in the sun all day 
Drink a couple beers after balin' hay 
It's good to be a redneck 
Drive by Ernie's for some barbecue 
Showin' off your brand new boots 

It's alright, it's alright 
It's alright to be a redneck 

The kids are gonna cry 
And the chicken's gonna fry 
Oh, you know it 
Your car won't run 
So your cousin's comin' by to tow it 

Ba bom ba bom 
It's alright to be a redneck 
It's alright to have a girl 
Name'a Thelma Lou 
That don't mind a little kiss 
When you got a little chew 
Party on the road 
By the light of the moon 
Dancin' to a country tune 

It's alright, it's alright 
It's alright to be a redneck 
It's alright, it's alright 
It's alright to be a redneck 

Yeah, it's alright, it's just right, 
It's alright to be a redneck 
Ba bom bom
