Verse 1 : 
The time has come, you're really leavin' 
You always told me that you wanted to 
I guess I never thought it would happen 
I guess I never really wanted it to 
The world is callin' you and you must answer 
But you can take me with you in your dreams, and 

Refrain : 
If you ever get back to Amarillo 
In a shiny new car or worn out shoes 
If you ever get back to Amarillo 
I'll be waiting for you 

Your sister told me you were working 
At some office out in Tinseltown 
But don't forget about those who love you 
They'll be there for you if you get down 
I believe in you in all you after 
I hope you end up where you wanna be 

Refrain : 
If you ever get back to Amarillo 
In a shiny new car or worn out shoes 
If you ever get back to Amarillo 
I'll be waiting for you 

Thirty years now have gone by quickly 
I still think of you from time to time 
My wife died early, I've got children 
I'm happy and my health is fine 
I often wondered if you found your freedom 
I sometimes wonder if I should have gone 

Refrain  2 times  : 
If you ever get back to Amarillo 
In a shiny new car or worn out shoes 
If you ever get back to Amarillo 
I'll be waiting for you 

Outro : 
I'll be waiting for you 
I'll be waiting for you
