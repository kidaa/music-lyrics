I've spent a lifetime lookin' for love 
Just when I find it, it comes undone 
I've tried so hard to make love happen 
Like some never endin' pattern 
I end up on the sad side of the fun 

Chorus
Hurtin' Comes easy 
Hurtin' Comes easy 
Hurtin' Comes easy 
For me 

Well, I've seen people that got it made 
They've got someone and love looks great 
But me, I've been to every doctor 
I've tried it wild and I tried it proper 
And I always end up watchin' love walk away 
That's okay 

Chorus
Hurtin' Comes easy 
Hurtin' Comes easy 
Hurtin' Comes easy 
For me 

I've gotten used to getting over 
And hopefully as I grow older 
Love won't be so difficult to see 
But now for me 

Chorus
Hurtin' Comes easy 
Hurtin' Comes easy 
Hurtin' Comes easy 

For Me
