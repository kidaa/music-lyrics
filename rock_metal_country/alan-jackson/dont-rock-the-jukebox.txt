Don't rock the jukebox 
I wanna hear some Jones 
Cause my heart ain't ready 
For the Rolling Stones 
I don't feel like rocking 
Since my baby's gone 
So don't rock the jukebox 
Play me a country song 

Before you drop that quarter 
Keep one thing in mind 
You got a heartbroke hillbilly 
Standing here in line 
I've been down and lonely 
Ever since she left 
Before you punch that number 
May I make one request 

Don't rock the jukebox 
I wanna hear some Jones 
Cause my heart ain't ready 
For the Rolling Stones 
I don't feel like rocking 
Since my baby's gone 
So don't rock the jukebox 
Play me a country song 

I ain't got nothing 
Against rock and roll 
But when your heart's been broken 
You need a song that's slow 
There ain't nothing like a steel guitar 
To drown a memory 
Before you spend your money baby 
Play a song for me 

Don't rock the jukebox 
I wanna hear some Jones 
Cause my heart ain't ready 
For the Rolling Stones 
I don't feel like rocking 
Since my baby's gone 
So don't rock the jukebox 
Play me a country song 
Don't rock the jukebox 
Play me a country song
