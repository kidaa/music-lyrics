Whenever a chance to meet some old friends on the street 
They wonder how does a man get to be this way 
I always got a smiling face any time and any place 
And everytime they ask me why 
I just smile and say 

You've got to kiss angel good mornin' 
And let her know you think about her when your gone 
So kiss an angel good mornin' 
And love her like the devil when you get back home 

Now people may guess the secret of happiness 
Some of them never learn 
It's a simple thing 
The secret I'm speaking of 
Is a woman and a man in love 
And the answer is in this song that I always sing 

You got to kiss an angel good mornin' 
And let her know you think about her when your gone 
So kiss an angel good mornin' 
And love her like the devil when you get back home 

Kiss an angel good mornin' 
And let her know you think about her when your gone 
So kiss an angel good mornin' 
And love her like the devil when you get back home.
