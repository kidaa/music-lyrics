Excuse me, ma'am, can you help me 
I need to place an ad with you today 
No ma'am, tomorrow may be too late 
I'd like to have it started right away 

What's that, no this is personal 
I'm not buying or selling anything 
Yes ma'am, I know just what to say 
I wrote it down, this is how it should read 

Wanted one good hearted woman 
To forgive imperfection 
In the man that she loves 
Wanted just one chance to tell her 
How much he stills loves her 
He can't be sorry enough 

What's that, no that's all I wanna say 
I just hope these few lines will get to her 
Yes ma'am, she means everything 
I hope she comes back when she reads these words 

Wanted one good hearted woman 
To forgive imperfection 
In the man that she loves 
Wanted just one chance to tell her 
How much he stills loves her 
He can't be sorry enough
