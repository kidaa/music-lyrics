I could see it coming from a mile away 
A heartache lookin' for a place to stay 
But I couldn't resist her and I couldn't be cool 
Lord can't a woman make a man a fool 

Chorus
It's an age-old story but it still holds true 
There ain't no end to what a man won't do 
He'll love some woman 'til he go insane 
It's a short sweet ride om a runaway train 

I was drunk and crazy from her sweet perfume 
But I knew stone sober I was being used 
Now the heartache lingers like a cheap cologne 

Chorus

It was almost worth it for the time we spent 
But there ain't no future in a heart for rent 
Still she taught me something 'bout the facts of life 
Love cuts quicker than a switchblade knife 

Chorus

It's a short sweet ride on a runaway train
