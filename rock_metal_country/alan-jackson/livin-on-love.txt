Two young people without a thing 
Say some vows and spread their wings 
Settle down with just what they need 
Livin on love 

She don't care 'bout whats in style 
She just likes the wayhe smiles 
It takes more than marble and tile 
Livin on love 

Livin on love, buyin on time 
Without somebody nothing aint worth a dime 
Just like an old fashioned story book rhyme 
Livin on love 
It sounds simple thats what you're thinkin' 
But love can walk through fire without blinkin' 
It doesnt take much when you get enough 
Livin' on love 

Two old people without a thing 
Children gone but still they sing 
Side by side in that front porch swing 
Livin on love 
He cant see anymore 
And she can barely sweep the floor 
Hand in hand they'll walk through that door 
Livin on love 

Livin on love, buyin on time 
Without somebody nothing aint worth a dime 
Just like an old fashioned story book rhyme 
Livin on love 
It sounds simple thats what you're thinkin' 
But love can walk through fire without blinkin' 
It doesnt take much when you get enough 
Livin' on love 
No it doesnt take much when you get enough 
Livin' on love
