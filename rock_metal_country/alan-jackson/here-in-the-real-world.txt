Cowboys don't cry, and heroes don't die 
Good always wins, again and again 
Love is a sweet dream that always comes true 
Oh, if life were like the movies, I'd never be blue 

CHORUS 
But here in the real world 
It's not that easy at all 
'Cause when hearts get broken 
It's real tears that fall 
And darlin' it's sad but true 
But the one thing I've learned from you 
Is how the boy don't always get the girl 
Here in the real world 

I gave you my love, but that wasn't enough 
To hold your heart when times got rough 
And tonight on that silver screen 
It'll end like it should 
Two lovers will make it through 
Like I hoped we would 
repeat 

REPEAT CHORUS 

No, the boy don't always get the girl 
Here in the real world
