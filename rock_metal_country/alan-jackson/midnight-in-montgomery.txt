Midnight in Montgomery, silver eagle, lonely road 
I was on my way to Mobile for a big New Years Eve show 
I stopped for just a minute to see a friend outside of town 
Put my collar up, found his name, and felt the wind die down 

Then a drunken man in a cowboy suit took me by surprise 
Wearing shiny boots, a Nudi suit and haunting haunted eyes 
He said 'Friend it's good to see you, it's nice to know you care' 
Then the wind picked up and he was gone 
Was he ever really there 

'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery 
Just hear that whippoorwill 
See the stars light up the purple sky 
Feel that lonesome chill 
When the wind it's right, you'll hear his songs 
Smell whiskey in the air 
Midnight in Montgomery 
He's always singing there 

I climbed back on my eagle, took one last look around 
Through red tail lights a shadow moved slow across the ground 
Off somewhere a midnight train is slowly passing by 
I could hear that whistle moaning 
I'm so lonesome I could cry 

'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery 
Just hear that whippoorwill 
See the stars light up the purple sky 
Feel that lonesome chill 
When the wind it's right, you'll hear his songs 
Smell whiskey in the air 
Midnight in Montgomery 
He's always singing there 
He's always singing there 
Hank's always singing there
