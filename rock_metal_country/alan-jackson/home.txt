In a small town down in Georgia over forty years ago 
Her maiden name was Musik til she met that Jackson boy 
They married young like folks did then, not a penny to their name 
But they believe the one you vow to love 
Should always stay that same 

And on the land his daddy gave him, a foundation under way 
For a love to last forever or until their dying day 
They built a bond that's strong enough to stand the test of time 
And a place for us to turn to when our lives were in a bind 

And they made their house from a toolshed 
Grandaddy rolled down on two logs 
And they builts walls all around it 
And they made that house a home 
They taught us 'bout good living 
They taught is right and wrong 
Lord there'll never be another place 
In this world I'll call home 

My momma raised five children, four girls then there was me 
She found her strength with faith in Gof and love of family 
She never had a social life, home was all she knew 
Except the time she took a job, to play a bill or two 

My daddy skinned his knuckles on the cars that he repaired 
He never earned much money but he gane us all he had 
He never made the front page but he did the best he couold 
And folks drove their cars from miles around 
To let him look underneath the hood 

And they made their house from a toolshed 
Grandaddy rolled down on two logs 
And they builts walls all around it 
And they made that house a home 
They taught us 'bout good living 
They taught is right and wrong 
Lord there'll never be another place 
In this world I'll call home 
No there'll never be another place in this world 
That I'll call home
