I know you're leaving, I see the signs 
You're gonna walk out on this heart of mine 
You'll never call me, you'll never write 
You made your mind up, you're gone tonight 
If some rainy day you're all alone 
You feel like talkin' you can log me on 

At www.memory 
I'll be waitin' for you patiently 
If you feel the need, just click on me 
At www.memory 

You won't even have to hold me or 
Look into my eyes 
You can tell me you love me 
Through your keyboard and wires 
No, you won't have to touch me or 
Even take my hand 
Just slide your little mouse around 
Until you see it land 

At www.memory 
I'll be waitin' for you patiently 
If you feel the need, just click on me 
At www.memory 

If you feel like love, just click on me 
At www.memory
