Pop a top again 
I just got time for one more round 
Sit 'em up my friends 
Then I'll be gone 
Then you can let some other fool sit down 

I'd like for you'd to listen to a joke I heard today 
From a woman who said she was through and calmly walked away 
I'd tried to smile and did a while it felt so outta place 
Did you ever hear of a clown with tears drops streaming down his face. 

Pop a top again 
I think I'll have another round 
Sit 'em up my friend 
Then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down. 

Home for me is misery and here I am wasting time 
Cause a row of fools on a row of stools is not what's on my mind 
But then you see her leaving me it's not what I prefer 
So it's either here just drinking beer or at home remembering her. 

Pop a top again 
I think I'll have another round 
Sit 'em up my friend 
Then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down 
Pop a top again.
