If I could have you 
I know what I'd do 
This time I'd be true 
If I had you 

If you could be mine 
I'd walk that straight line 
There'd be no bad times 
If I had you 

I made the worst mistake 
One fool could ever make 
Tell me it's not too late 
What can I do 

If I could hold you tight 
I'd have the world tonight 
Everything would be alright 
If I had you 

I made the worst mistake 
One fool could ever make 
Tell me it's not too late 
What can I do 

If I could hold you tight 
I'd have the world tonight 
Everything would be alright 
If I had you 
Everything would be alright 
If I had you
