Where were you when the world stopped turning that September day 
Out in the yard with your wife and children 
Working on some stage in LA 
Did you stand there in shock at the site of 
That black smoke rising against that blue sky 
Did you shout out in anger 
In fear for your neighbor 
Or did you just sit down and cry 

Did you weep for the children 
Who lost their dear loved ones 
And pray for the ones who don't know 
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble 
And sob for the ones left below 

Did you burst out in pride 
For the red white and blue 
The heroes who died just doing what they do 
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer 
And look at yourself to what really matters 

I'm just a singer of simple songs 
I'm not a real political man 
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell you 
The difference in Iraq and Iran 
But I know Jesus and I talk to God 
And I remember this from when I was young 
Faith hope and love are some good things he gave us 
And the greatest is love 

Where were you when the world stopped turning that September day 
Teaching a class full of innocent children 
Driving down some cold interstate 
Did you feel guilty cause you're a survivor 
In a crowded room did you feel alone 
Did you call up your mother and tell her you love her 
Did you dust off that bible at home 
Did you open your eyes and hope it never happened 
Close your eyes and not go to sleep 
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages 
Speak with some stranger on the street 
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow 
Go out and buy you a gun 
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watching 
And turn on "I Love Lucy" reruns 
Did you go to a church and hold hands with some stranger 
Stand in line and give your own blood 
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family 
Thank God you had somebody to love 

I'm just a singer of simple songs 
I'm not a real political man 
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell you 
The difference in Iraq and Iran 
But I know Jesus and I talk to God 
And I remember this from when I was young 
Faith hope and love are some good things he gave us 
And the greatest is love 

I'm just a singer of simple songs 
I'm not a real political man 
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell you 
The difference in Iraq and Iran 
But I know Jesus and I talk to God 
And I remember this from when I was young 
Faith hope and love are some good things he gave us 
And the greatest is love 

The greatest is love 
The greatest is love
