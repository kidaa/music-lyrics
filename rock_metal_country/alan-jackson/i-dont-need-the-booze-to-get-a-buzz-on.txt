I've been known to tie one on and honky tonk til half past three 
But the party don't get started til my baby pours her love on me 
She's a hundred proof, Lord she's smooth 
She makes me moan all night long 
So I don't need the booze to get a buzz on 

I've tried It all from Tennessee Whiskey 
To Ozark Mountain Moonshine 
But it's her sweet love that packs the punch 
And keeps me higher than a Georgia pine 
Mr Southern Comfort don't come in a bottle 
I get a double shot of love home grown 
So I don't need booze to get a buzz on 

My little country girl makes my head whirl and my knees begin to shake 
No I can't walk no chalk line I ain't a talking or a thinking straight 
I'm hooked on my baby's love there ain't nothing in a jug this strong 
And I don't need the booze to get a buzz on 

I've tried It all from Tennessee Whiskey 
To Ozark Mountain Moonshine 
Bu it's her sweet love that packs the punch 
And keeps me higher than a Georgia pine 
Mr Southern Comfort don't come in a bottle 
I get a double shot of love home grown 
So I don't need booze to get a buzz on 

I wear a Blue Ribbon grin every now and then 
But I don't need that to get stoned 
I don't need the booze to get a buzz on 

No I don't need the booze to get a buzz on
