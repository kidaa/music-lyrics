I called my doctor on the telephone 
Help me Doc there's something wrong 
I can't shake it it's gone too far 
He said tell me what your symptoms are 

I said my hands are sweaty and my knees are weak 
I can't eat and I can't sleep 
It's turning me every way but loose 
He said it sounds like love's got a hold on you 
No doubt love's got a hold on you 

I told my buddies I was settlin' down 
No more of this running 'round 
They looked at me like I was a fool 
And said come on tell us what's wrong with you 

I said my hands are sweaty and my knees are weak 
I can't eat and I can't sleep 
It's turning me every way but loose 
He said it sounds like love's got a hold on you 
No doubt love's got a hold on you 

Well I tossed and turned til the morning light 
Holding my pillow hanging on for life 
There ain't nothing I can do 
They said it sounds like love's got a hold on you 
Sounds like love's got a hold on you 

My hands are sweaty and my knees are weak 
I can't eat and I can't sleep 
It's turning me every way but loose 
He said it sounds like love's got a hold on you 
Sounds like love's got a hold on you 
Sounds like love's got a hold on you 
No doubt love's got a hold on you
