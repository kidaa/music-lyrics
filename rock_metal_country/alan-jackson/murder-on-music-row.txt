Nobody saw them running 
From 16th Avenue 
They never found the fingerprints 
Or the weapon that was used 
But someone killed country music 
Cut out its heart and soul 
They got away with murder 
Down on music row 

The almight dollar 
And the lust for worldwide fame 
Slowly killed tradition 
And for that, someone shouldhang   "Ahh, you tell 'em Alan" 
They all say "Not Guilty!" 
But the evidence will show 
That murder was committed 
Down on music row 

For the steel guitars no longer cry 
And the fiddles barely play 
But drums and rock 'n' roll guitars 
Are mixed up in your face 
Ol'  Hank wouldn't have a chance 
On today's radio 
Since they committed murder 
Down on music row 

They thought no one would miss it 
Once it was dead and gone 
They said no one would buy them ol' 
Drinkin' and cheatin' songs   "Oh, but I still buy 'em" 
Well there ain't no justice in it 
And the hard facts are cold 
Murder's been committed 
Down on music row 

For the steel guitars no longer cry 
And you can't hear fiddles play 
With drums and rock 'n' roll guitars 
Mixed right up in your face 
Why the Hag wouldn't have a chance 
On today's radio 
Since they committed murder 
Down on music row 

Why they even tell the Possum 
To pack up and go back home 
There's been an awful murder 
Down on music row
