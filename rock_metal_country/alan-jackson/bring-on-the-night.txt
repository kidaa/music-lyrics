It's twilight and the streets Light are coming on 
I'm in a stream of cars 
On this Boulevard, headed home 
I can hardly wait 
You can make what went wrong today 
Seam right 
Bring on the night 
It's been a long hard day 
So bring on the night 

Bring on the night 
And pull down the shades 
Lock the world out side 
And throw the key away 
Turn on the feelings 
And turn out the lights 
Lets call it a day 
And bring on the night 

From 9 to 5 it's the same ole grind 
All weeklong 
And the only thing 
That keeps sane, is coming home 

When the sun goes down 
You know how to set things right 
Let's put the day behind us 
And bring on the night 

Bring on the night 
And pull down the shades 
Lock the world out side 
And throw the key away 
Turn on the feelings 
And turn out the lights 
Let's call it a day 
And bring on the night 

Let's call it a day 
And bring on the night
