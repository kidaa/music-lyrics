I can hear her heart beat 
It seams a little strong 
I can hear the things I did wrong 
I can hear her thoughts 
By looking in her eyes 
I can hear her all the times she cried 
I can hear the memories 
As they echo off the wall 
Falling from the pictures down the hall 

I can hear regret 
Building up in side of me 
And I can hear all the things 
I could not see 

Those are the sounds of a woman leaving 
Stronger then the wind in a willow tree 
Those are the sounds of a heart breaking 
You can't hear it 
But the noise is killing me 

I should of heard it coming 
But I chose to pretend 
I should of recognizes that sound 
Way back then 
But I just wouldn't listen didn't want to all those years 
Now the truth is ringing clear 
In my ears 

Those are the sounds of a woman leaving 
Stronger then the  wind in willow tree 
Those are the sounds of a heart breaking 
You can't hear it 
But the noise is killing me 

Those are the sounds of a heart breaking 
You can't hear it 
But the noise is killing me 
I can hear it 
And the silent is killing me
