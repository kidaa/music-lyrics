Collideascope
Careful, don't look down the wrong end
You will see ships that fall out of the sky
Who put that nail in your eye
You make me want to cry with your...

Everything looks smashed and broken
You will see fishes that drown in the sea
If you don't alter your mind
I'd hate you to go blind why don't you

Wakey Wakey Wakey
Little Sleeper
If you doze much longer
Then dreams turn to nightmares

Everything looks topsy turvy
You will see one young girl split into two
One half who's false one half true
You better get your glue ready

Wakey Wakey Wakey
Little Sleeper

Collideascope
Careful don't look down the wrong end
All the world's colours will crash into one
Monochrome living's no fun
You're staring down a gun with your
