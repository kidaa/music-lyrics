Rook, rook
Read from your book
Who murders who and where is the treasure hid
Crow, crow
Spill all you know
Is that my name on the bell
Rook, rook
Gaze in the brook
If there's a secret can I be part of it
Crow, crow
Before I'll let go, say is that my name on the bell
Soar up high, see the semaphore from the washing lines
Break the code of the whispering chimneys and traffic signs
Where's the message that's written under the base of clouds
Plans eternal, I know you know, so don't blurt out loud
Rook, rook
By hook or by crook
I'll make you tell me what this whole thing's about!
Crow, crow
Why can't you show
If that's my name on the bell
On the wings of night, I fly too, above field and stream
My head bursting with knowledge 'till I wake from the dream
If I die and I find that I had a soul inside
Promise me that you'll take it up on its final ride
Rook, rook
Gaze in the brook
If there's a secret can I be part of it
Crow, crow
Before I'll let go, say is that my name on the bell
Is that my name on the bell
