Hiding faces turning pages
Still they read and read
Double deckers full of smokers
Look who's gone to seed
Well the sun's getting higher
Think I'll take a flyer
The thought of it's causing me pain
Ooh!
Talk a walk under the subway
See an old school chum
Window shopping for a short while
Then we'll have some fun
Well the shops closing early
Everywhere's deserted
Hello and down comes the rain
Oooh!
We'll do the town tonight
I know some girls then stop off for a bite
No strings to tie my kite
Well living for the night
No way to spend a life Ooh!
