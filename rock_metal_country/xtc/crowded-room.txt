Across a crowded room
I first set eyes on you
My vision was impaired
Obstructed out of view

By those - faces in a crowded room
them - bodies in a crowded room
their - breathing in a crowded room
and their - pushing me out
down the fire escape

In the crowded room I won't touch too much
I felt the punch of a punch
The language was enough
To send me running [etc.]
