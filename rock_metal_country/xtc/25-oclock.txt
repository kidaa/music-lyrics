The urge to take you grows more strong
For time had made me wait too long
Each watch I smash apart
Just adding to my power
Each watch I smash apart
Just bringing near the hour
of 25 o'clock, that's when you're going to be mine
25 o'clock, we'll be together 'til the end of time
At 25 o'clock

The ticking seconds hear them call
My spell of hours will make you fall
Each timer that I break
Will halt the flowing sands
Each timer that I break
Will put you in my hands
At 25 o'clock, that's when you're going to be mine
25 o'clock, we'll be together 'til the end of time
At 25 o'clock

Each watch I smash apart
Just adding to my power
Each watch I smash apart
Just bringing near the hour
of 25 o'clock
