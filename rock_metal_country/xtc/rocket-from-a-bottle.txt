Birds beware, expect me up there
me and air are feeling light today
jets should hide, I'll fly alongisde
me and pride are bolted tight today

I've been set off by a pretty little girl

I'm like a rocket from a bottle shot free
I've been just explosive since you lit me
I've been up with the larks
I've been shooting off sparks

and I'm feeling in love

I'm a rocket from a bottle shot free
I've been just explosive since you kissed me
I've been up in the clouds
I've been shrugging off shrouds

and I'm feeling in love

Hate step back, my smile might just crack
can't stop grins from going wide today
hell look sharp, angels play your harp
I feel strong like the tide today
