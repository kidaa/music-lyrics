Paper, iron, won't buy Eden
working for paper and for iron
work for the right to keep my tie on
working for paper and for iron
work for the unicorn and lion

I pray the kids aren't starving
no chicken for the Sunday carving
I'll stay for one more farthing

I take home my notes and coins every week
I'm told I'm worth much more
but the Church says turn the other cheek
the other cheek
paper, iron, won't buy Eden.

I know the family needs me
can't moan, the factory feeds me
won't bite the hand that bleeds me

I take home my notes and coins every week
I'll inherit the earth I'm told
but the Church says to remain this meek
remain this meek
I'm still a proud man.
Won't show anybody else my wage
a blend in the crowd man
is this anybody's golden age
is this anybody's golden age
is this anybody's golden age
or am I dreaming of a golden cage

La la lo it's paper
la la lo it's iron
la la lo just paper
la la lo just iron
