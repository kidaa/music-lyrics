Have you seen Jackie
He's a strange strange strange little girl
Make up on his face and his hair in curls
Have you seen Jackie
She's a strange strange strange little boy
Her long black beard is her pride and joy

And all the children follow him around
And all the grownups try to drag her down
So we sing
Hey, leave Jackie alone
Hey, his pigeons have flown
Hey, she's never at home at all these days
Leave Jackie alone

Have you seen Jackie
He's an odd odd odd little fish
To fly around is his only wish
Have you seen Jackie
She's a queer queer queer little bird
Shy and quiet neither scene nor herd

And all the rats will follow him around
The dogs and cats will chase her from the town
And we sing
Hey, leave Jackie alone
Hey, his mind is all blown
Hey, she's not on the phone at all these days
Leave Jackie alone
Jackie couldn't decide if he was a girl
Or if she was a boy
Have you seen Jackie
