Can't you see
Love and affection
When it's put
In you direction
Wrapped in your mysterious wonderland
No fast car
Can make you grow up
Gentlemen
You think you've sewn up
Locked in your wonderful wonderland
No dark horse like me can cramp all of your style
Too plain and simple I am for your file

[Chorus:] One day you will break out of your spell
And some day you will want me for your own
And I'll say welcome to reality

All this talk
Of late-night parties
Flirting with the lower gentry
Lost in your magical wonderland
Out of depth
Out of class
Phase of your life
Will come to pass
Caught in this tragical wonderland
All of the riches that shine will turn sour
Each moment you slip you will bring near the hour

[Chorus]

Wrapped in your mysterious wonderland

Caught in your superficial
Nonexistant
Fairy-story
Wonderland
