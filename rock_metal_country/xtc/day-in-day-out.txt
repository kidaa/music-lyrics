Clock in my head
Clock on the wall
And the two of them
Don't agree at all
Friday is heaven, Friday is heaven

Day in day out
Day in day out
Wish you were here
On the shop floor
And together we could
Count the dots on the wall
Friday is heaven, Friday is heaven

Day in day out
Day in day out
Friday is heaven [x2]
Day in day out
Day in day out
