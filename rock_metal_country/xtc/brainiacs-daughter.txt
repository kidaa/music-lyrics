Brainiacs Daughter
Made me a suit of bricks and mortar
And a matching stove pipe hat, oh yes
Brainiacs Daughter
Took me on a sleigh ride underwater
And I'm crazy for girls like that
Oh yes Sir, yes Sir
Three bags full Sir

All across the land the bells ring out
It's night, sun shines bright
So I reach to hold her frozen hand in flight
As we alight in the bottle city of Kandor

Brainiacs Daughter
Talks like a Daily Planet Reporter
Sitting cross legged there on the mat, oh yes
Brainiacs Daughter
Swallowed the pocket watch I bought her
And I'm crazy for girls like that
Oh yes Sir, Yes Sir
All fall down Sir

And I love the lights that blink on and off
All around her head
And I love the clothes that she tries on and off
Landing on the bed
Yes Sir, Yes Sir
Three bags full Sir
