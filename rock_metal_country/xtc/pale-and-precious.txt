So pale and precious is the light that will shine
Out of the windows in her head
So pale and precious like the sun as it climbs
Up every morning on her bed

If all of her moments were put down in a book
Then I could read it 'til I went blind
If all of the tears she cried flowed into a brook
Well than I'm sure it would taste like wine
Don't care what the others might say
As far as I'm concerned they can all fall apart
Fade away

So pale and precious is the light that will shine
Out of her perfumed golden hair
So pale and precious are the steps that I climb
Up to her room so bright and bare

If all of the things she said were flowers and tress
Well then her garden would always be green
If all of our time together fell on one day
It would be like every Christmas there's been

Don't care what the others might say
As far as I'm concerned they can all fall apart
Fade Away

Up she rises each and every morning
She blows the stars out of the sky
And lights the sun with her bright eyes

The smell of the pinecones
And the sea in her hair
Silver Gentle
