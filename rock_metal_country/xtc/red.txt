You better watch your tape boys
It's the tint that angers the beast
Got their sails in the sunset
they've already got the east

Red red red
Don't you let them make you
Don't let them make you see ... red

You better watch your lead boys
it's already in your veins
Did you ever see the colour
iron turns when it rains

It's not a gross infatuation
It's not a fear, it's not a crush
It's not any special nation
But even now they make me blush
