Coverdale/Sykes
When I first saw you baby
You took my breath away
I knew your name was Trouble
But, my heart got in the way
I couldn't stop myself from reaching out
I could not turn away

I don't even know your name
An' I can't leave you alone
I'm running round in circles
Like a dog without a bone
I know the game you're playing
But baby I just can't let go

So give me all your love tonite
Give me all your love tonite
I'll do anything you want
Just give me all of your lovin' tonite

I'll work hard everyday
To love and treat you right
I'll rock you in the morning
And roll you in the nite
Any way you want
I'm gonna prove my love for you...So give me all your love tonite
Give me all your love tonite
I'll do anything you want
Just give me all your lovin' tonite

I am blinded by your smile
And I'm crazy 'bout your walk
I shiver and I shake
When I hear you baby talk...
I'm a fool for your lovin' babe
Give me all your lovin' tonite...

So give me all of your love tonite
Give me all of your love tonite
I'll do anything you want
Just give me all of your lovin' tonite
