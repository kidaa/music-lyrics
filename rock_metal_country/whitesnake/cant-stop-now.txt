Coverdale/Vandenberg
My mama always said
If you want you should get in fast
While the going's good
Lie like a rug if you fool around
Just don't get caught with your trousers down 

Somebody stop me,
Tie me down
I tell you, baby,
I can't, I can't stop now 

My daddy said son gotta understand,
Don't think twice get it while you can
You can't hang around, you can't stand still,
Cos' if you don't take it another man will 

Somebody stop me,
Tie me down
I tell you, baby,
I can't, I can't stop now
I got an eye for a pretty girl,
An' a sweet tooth for trouble I can't stop, can't stop, can't stop now
I can't stop cause it tastes so good,
I got a sweet tooth
For trouble 

No rest for the wicked, no peace of mind
When you got a jukebox heart
Working overtime
I maybe out of touch,
Maybe out of line
But, baby, you got your life
An' I got mine 

Somebody stop me,
Tie me down
I tell you, baby,
I can't, I can't stop now
I got an eye for a pretty girl,
An' a sweet tooth for trouble 

I can't stop, can't stop, can't stop now
I got an eye for a pretty girl,
An' a sweet tooth for trouble
