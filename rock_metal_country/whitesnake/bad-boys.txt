Coverdale/Sykes
I know you, you know me
I'm the black sheep of the family
I'm in an' out of trouble
I'm the talk of the town
I get wild in the street
When the sun goes down...

I steal around, like a thief in the night
Dancing 'til the break of day

Bad Boys
Running undercover of moonlight
Bad, bad Boys
Getting wild in the street,
wild in the city

I see you, you see me
Just a back street boy in society
With high-heeled women full of
champagne an' lies
Getting wild in the street
Til the hot sunrise
Stealing 'ound like a thief in the night
Dancing 'til the break of day

Bad Boys
Runnign undercover of moonlight
Bad, bad Boys
Getting wild in the street
Wild in the city
Wild in the city
Wild in the cityBad, bad Boys
Running undercover of moonlight
Bad, bad Boys
Getting wild in the street
Wild in the city

I know you, you know me
I'm the black sheep of the family
I'm in an' out of trouble
I'm the talk of the town
I get wild in the street
When the sun goes down...

I don't care what the people think
I can't hear what the people say
I steal around like a thief in the night
Dancing 'til the break of day

Bad, bad Boys
Running undercover of moonlight
Bad, bad Boys
Getting wild in the street

Wild in the city
