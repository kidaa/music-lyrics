I get so confused but my heart knows you're one of a kind
Leather and lace, an angel's face
Riding on a one track mind
You're fully loaded with cruise control
My four wheels rock with your backseat roll
chorus:
You're cheap an' nasty, all you wanna do is give it up, give it u
Cheap an' nasty, c'mon and do the dirty with me

I get so excited babe, when I'm invited to ride in your limousine
You drive it every day, burn it every night
I wonder how you keep it so clean
Smooth accelerator, you get me so loose
You keep your motor running til'I run out of juice
chorus

I never knew it could be this way, and I never thought I'd ever complain
But gimme just a second just to catch my breath, babe, before you do it again
All the boys call your name down the wishing well
'Cause baby, when you go you're like a cat out of hell
chorus
