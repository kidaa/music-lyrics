Do you remember standing on the shore, head in the clouds
Your pockets filled wtih dreams?
Bound for glory on the seven seas of life
But the ocean is deeper than it seems
The wind was with you when you left on the morning tide
You set your sail for an island in the sun
On the horizon, dark clouds up ahead, for the storm has just begun
Take me with you, take me far away, and lead me to the distant shore
Sail your ship across the water, spread your wings across the sky
Take the time to see you're the one who holds the key
Or sailing ships will pass you by
You cry for mercy when you think you've lost your way
You drift alone, if all your hope is gone
So find the strength and you will see you control your destiny
After all is said and done
So take me with you, take me far away, an' lead me to the distant shore
Sail your ship across the water, spread your wings across the sky
Take the time to see you're the one who holds the key
Or sailing ships will pass, sailing ships will pass you
Sailing ships will pass you by
So take me with you, take me far away, we'll ride the wind across the sky
Spread your wings and you will see you control your destiny
So sailing ships don't pass you by
So take me with you, take me far away, we'll ride the wind across the sky
Spread your wings and you will see you control your destiny
So sailing ships don't pass you by
You'll find that you're the only one can sail your ship across the sky
