The night is gone, the time has come to find a new day has begun
An' it promises to stay
To soothe the pain of wasted years and kiss away the bitter tears
A love to light the way
And from the darkness comes a smile that reaches out for many miles
Touching everyone
No more shadows of the past, your spirit free to fly at last
Shining in the sun
Like rolling thunder, I feel the power of love
IT's a gift from heaven and the Lord above
We walk toward desire, hand in hand through fields of fire
With only love to light the way on the road to judgment day
Take it easy, take it slow
I'll take you anywhere you wanna go, places never seen before
'Cause I love you, and I need you
I'll do my best to please you, my love can open any door
When you hear the thunder in your darkest night
I'll be there to hold you when the lightning strikes
So don't you worry, you can ease your mind
'Cause we'll still be dancing at the end of time
Who loves you?  Who needs you?  Who'll do his best to please you?
I love you.  I need you.  I'll get down on my knees
We walk toward desire, hand in hand, through fields of fire
With only love to light the way on the road to judgment day
