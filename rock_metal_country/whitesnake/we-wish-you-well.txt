I'm sad to say it's time to go
                             Until we meet again along the road
                             Remember this on your journey home,
                             When you hear the thunder roar you're not alone

                             We wish you well, we wish you well,
                             In times of trouble may your hearts be strong
                             We wish you well, we wish you well,
                             Until we meet again,
                             We wish you well...
