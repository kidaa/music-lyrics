Coverdale/Sykes
You say your dreams
Are burned to ashes
And your smiles
Have turned to tears
It seems to me
You welcome saness
As you surrender
To your fears

So what's a man like me
Supposed to do
When all I want is
Just to make love to you

Don't turn away
Before the night is voer
Don't turn away
Before the night is gone
Don't turn away
The night may hold the answer
So don't turn away
Before the night
Before the night is gone

You say your heart
Is lost forever
And you're always gonna give
Your love in vain
So you paint yourself
A lonely portrait
And hide your love away again

You turn away from what you 
feel inside
You can't forget all your foolish prideDon't turn away
Before the night is over
Don't turn away
Before the night is gone
Don't turn away
The night may hold the answer
So don't turn away
Before the night is gone

So now i'm asking
You this question
Am I gonna give you
All my love in vain
Do you wanna
Drown in your own sorrow
Or are you gonna
Try to love again

Don't turn away from what you
feel inside
You should try to forget about
All your foolish pride

Don't turn away
Before the night is over
Don't turn away
Before the night is gone
Don't turn away

The night may hold the answer
So don't turn away
Before the night
Before the night
Before the night is gone
