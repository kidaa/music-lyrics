Coverdale/Sykes
I'm getting ready
I'm in the mood to fool around
It's time for action
Now the boys are back intown

So turn up the music
Make it loud and proud
Let's see reaction
Let the spotlite hit the crowd

Don't hide what you feel inside
Don't let anybody stand in your way
Just let the music take you higher

Now are you ready to rock
Children of the Night
Are you ready to roll
Children of the Night

You got the power
I feel your fire in my soul
You got the fever
Cos you were born to rock an' roll
Don't run for cover
I'm gonna show you what I've learned
Just come a little closer
Come on an' get your fingers burned

Don't hide what you feel inside
Don't let anybody stand in your way
Just let the music take you higherNow are you ready to rock
Are you ready to roll

Are you ready to rock

Now are you ready to rock
Children of the Night
Are you ready to roll
Children of the Night

I'm getting ready
I'm in the mood to fool around
It's time for action
Cos' now the boys are back in town

Don't hide what you feel inside
Don't let anybody stand in your way
Just let the music take you higher

Now are you ready to rock
Children of the Night
Are you ready to roll
Children of the Night
