You build me up just to tear me down
You're slammin' my name all over this town
Girl I can't believe what you're puttin' me through
Breaking my heart with the things that you do
Every story has a lesson to learn it won't be long till you take your turn
Cause what goes up must come down
You're throwin' stones and they'll come back around for you

As you sow so you reap what you love is what you keep
You told me that your heart was mine
Yet behind my back you shared your time
Join the club you've paid your dues
It won't be long till you're singin' the blues
Cause what goes up must come down
You're throwin' stones and they'll come back around for you
For you for you for you

[harmonica]

Every dog must have its day we all know there's a price to pay
You gotta pay the piper if you wanna dance
Live with it baby when you take a chance
All good things gotta come to an end ask your Maker about your sins
Cause what goes up must come down
You're throwin' stones and they'll come back around for you

Cause what goes up must come down
You're throwin' stones and they'll come back around for you
For you for you for you
