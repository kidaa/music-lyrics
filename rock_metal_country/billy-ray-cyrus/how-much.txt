One candle burns brightly it flickers and it almost dies like me
Alone against the wind
But this moments has magic it's keepin' that flame alive
As we hold on to the night

There'll be another day we'll have another chance
But not like this no nothing can compare
To the way that I feel right now
Do you feel the same way I do tell me
How strong how strong do you want it to be
How do how do you want to hear it from me
How long how long and baby tell me how deep
How much love do you want from me

Somebody must have scared you left you wounded and afraid to love again
You are just like me
Cause nobody ever held me so close so desperately
And I I never held anybody like you

There'll be another day we'll have another chance...
How much love do you want from me

One tender moment is all I need
This world's gone crazy baby shelter me
You've gotta shelter me

[guitar]

There'll be another day we'll have another chance...

[guitar]

How much how much
How much love do you want from me
