Joe works at the steel mill 
Works damn near every day 
Leaves for work when the sun comes up 
Drops the kids at school along the way 
Kids at school along the way 

When the night is falling 
He gets home and hugs his wife 
He says how much he missed her 
And that he loves her more than life, yeah 

More than life 

Joe may never be a rich man 
No lawyer, or movie star 
He may not own the finest jewelry 
And he may not drive the nicest car 
Joe has everything he dreamed of 
All the treasures that he needs 
No wonder Joe's always smiling 
He only aims to please, yeah 

Let me be your Joe 
I just wanna love you 
And watch our babies grow 
I may not be no millionaire 
But I want you to know 
I wanna be your Joe 

You are just a woman and I am just a man 
Though I may not feel every need 
I hope you understand 

I wanna be your Joe 
I wanna be your Joe 
Let me be your Joe 
I just wanna love you 
And watch our babies grow 
I may not be no millionaire 
But I want you to know 
I wanna be your Joe 
Let me be your Joe 

I just wanna love you 
I just wanna be your man 
I just wanna hold you 
Love you with all that I am 
I wanna be your Joe 
Let me be your Joe 

I wanna be your Joe
