Back when I was young when I was just a kid
The foolish things we done the secrets that we hid
Out on our playground where I first touched your lips
Our first taste of love upon our fingertips

Now I go back in time to a place they call the past
Where dreams are make believe and love can really last
Sometimes it's all so real and it's always way too fast
It's crazy world we live in the past

[guitar]

Now I go back in time...
