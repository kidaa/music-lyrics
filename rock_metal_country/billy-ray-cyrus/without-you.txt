I hear your footsteps down the hall
I check my messages but I don't hear you call
I think of days gone by and now I wonder why you left me
But I can't go on without you without you

Sometimes I wander on my way
Sometimes I just break down and pray
Sometimes I think of you and I don't know what to do
And I wonder how I will go on without you
How I will go on without your love
Without you no I can't go on without you
Without you

I can't stop missin' you oh if I only knew do you miss me
Cause I can't go on without you I can't go on without you
I can't go on without your love
Without you no I can't go on without you
No I can't go on without you oh no no no

I hear your footsteps down the hall
I check my messages but I don't hear you call
And once again I'm all alone without you
No I can't go on without you no I can't go on without you
No I can't go on without you no I can't go on without you
