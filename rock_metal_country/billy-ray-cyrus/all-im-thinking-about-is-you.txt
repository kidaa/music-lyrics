Well it's a twenty mile drive from here to town
There's gray skies and there's no doubt
Rain's comin' down this mornin'
I get off the interstate fifteen minutes late
For an appointment that I really didn't need to make
God this routine bores me
Well it's gettin' on twelve and I ain't had a bite
I'm all ceffee'd up sleepy eyed wound up tight
And it's only Monday Monday
I've had the whole night and a half the day
To think about what you said and what I need to change
But it's all the same it's all the same

Cause all I'm thinkin' bout is you all I'm thinkin' bout is you
All I'm thinkin' bout is you

Well I skipped lunch with the boss at that sleazy little bar
Stopped to get gas a bag of chips
And got back in the car and started drivin'
I headed down the road where the air is clean
And the grass is green and the birds sing to clear this head
Full of things that I've been denyin but it's all in vain

Cause all I'm thinkin' bout is you...
Yeah all I'm thinkin' bout is you...

Well it's five o'clock sharp and it's gettin' dark now
It's bumper to bumper and it's rainin' buckets down
But I'm smilin' yeah I'm smilin'

All I'm thinkin' bout is you...
All I'm thinkin' bout is you...
All I'm thinkin' bout is you...
