I wake up in the morning in a lonely ice and bed
Thinkin' bout the nightmare that just played in my head
I think of all the things I miss
Like moments that we share a kiss so dear
I'm so miserable without you it's almost like you're here

I search your house for coffee but it's to no avail
The days not even started it seems it's shot to hell
The jeans I'm wearin' look like dirt
As I put on my old wrinkled shirt it smells like beer
I'm so miserable without you it's almost like you're here

But there was a time when you were mine and life was such a pretty dream
Then you fell in love with another man that changed everything
The world I knew changed everyday as I watched it all slip away so clear
I'm so miserable without you it's almost like you're here

I turn on my radio they play your favorite song
Did I not do something right was there something I done wrong
As you pulled away you shouldn't tried
Instead of feeling foolish pride and fear
I'm so miserable without you it's almost like you're here
I'm so miserable without you it's almost like you're here
