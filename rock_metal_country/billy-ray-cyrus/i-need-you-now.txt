I've never seen that little town where You were born
It was long before my time and far away
But as time goes on I think about You more and more
And wonder what it was like in those day's
I wish I could have walked with You 
You might have called me friend
But there's no way I could've known You then

But I know You now
I know Your name
A lot of awesome things You did and why You came
I didn't know You when
You helped that lame man rise up from his bed
I didn't know You when 
You stood there and called Lazarus from the dead
But I know You now

I didn't see You feed that tired hungry crowd
With five loaves and two fish one afternoon
And I didn't see You catch Peter's hand
So he wouldn't drown
When he tried the walk on water like You
I couldn't see Your face 
When You taught those little kids
There's just no way I could've seen You then

But I see You now
I see Your love
I see a tiny glimpse of You in every one of us
I didn't see You on the mount of olives
Crying as You prayed
I couldn't see You when You were kissed by Judus and betrayed
But I see You now

Oh, I didn't need You when that bitter angry mob
Shouted out crucify him
And I couldn't have needed You 
When they laughed and mocked You
But it could be I'm a little bit like them

'Cause I need You now
I need Your grace
And how I needed Your forgiveness to be saved
I didn't need You when Pilates soldiers beat You to the ground
I didn't need You when You hung there 
Bleeding from Your thorny crown
But I need You now
Oh, I need You now
