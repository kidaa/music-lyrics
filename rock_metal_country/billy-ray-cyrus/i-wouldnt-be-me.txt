If I never see your smile again, 
Or never woke to touch your skin.
The truth would be so plain to see,
If I couldn't love you, I wouldn't be me.

If the night couldn't kiss the morning sun,
Like a river that has no place to run.
God only knows where I might be,
If I couldn't love you I wouldn't be me.

If you hadn't of come into my life,
I'd be forever wondering why
I never found my destiny.
If I couldn't love you, I wouldn't be me.

And when the Master calls us home,
I hope and pray our hearts live on
And be as one eternity, Cause 
If I couldn't love you, I wouldn't be me.

God only knows where I might be,
If I couldn't love you, I wouldn't be me.

If you hadn't of come into my life,
I'd be forever wondering why
I never found my destiny.
If I couldn't love you, I wouldn't me
