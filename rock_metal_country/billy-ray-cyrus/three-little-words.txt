Do I love you yes a thousand times and lately I been going out of my mind
I get the feeling you're pulling away it's gonna hurt me if you won't stay
Can't stand the thought of being alone you need to be there when I get home
If you could tell me just one more time it would surely ease my mind
Three little words would be fine

I love you I love you
I need to know that you're still mine
Three little words would be fine

It's gotten crazy I don't understand how can love get so out of hand
I've never been so uncertain before is there someone behind another door
I've got to know if I'm right or wrong with mixed emotions I can't go on
I've got to know that I'm not blind just lay it on the line
Three little words would be fine

I love you I love you...

[guitar]

Can't stand the thought of being alone...
I love you I love you...
I love you I love you I love you
