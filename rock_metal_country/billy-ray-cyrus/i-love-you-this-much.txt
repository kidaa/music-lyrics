He didn't have the answers
To half the questions his son ask him
A child's mind is a curious thing
But when his son hugged him and said Dad
You know I love you 
How much do you love me
Daddy didn't have to think

With his arms open wide
Just as far as they could go
He said as far as I can reach
Is not enough to show
I would give my life for you
You are my flesh and blood
I love you this much

She stood there crying
Broken-hearted
Looking up at Him
And said why are You doing this
He looks down at her wanting to hold her
And wipe her tears away
He has to leave and that's the way it is
She gave her son one last kiss

With her arms open wide
Just as far as they could go
She said as far as I can reach
Is not enough to show
I would give my life for You
You are my flesh and blood
I love You this much

And they raised his broken body above the crowd
Drove in the nails as the rain came down

With His arms open wide
Just as far as they could go
He said as far as I can reach
Is not enough to show
I would give my life for you
You are my flesh and blood
I love you this much

I love you this much
