Once I had a heart cold as ice love to me was only for fun
I'd make a mark for each broken heart like notches on the butt of a gun

Once I had a trick up my sleeve and a reputation all over town
I was heartless and cold whatever I'd go I shot down every young girl I found

Yes I used to be a moonlight bandit I used to be a heartbreak kid
Then I met you and the next thing I knew there I was oh shot full of love

Who'd have thought that someone like you could take a desperado like me
But oh here I am I'm as meek as a lamb with my bleedin' heart there at your feet

Yes I used to be a moonlight bandit...
Shot full of love

Yes I used to be a moonlight bandit...
Shot full of love shot full of love
Shot full of love shot full of love
Shot full of love shot full of love
Shot full of love shot full of love
