Little boy running through the yard fell and skinned his heart
And later climbed up in a tree
As he looked into the sky he began to cry
And said daddy why'd you leave

Call me daddy I'm feeling blue
Call me daddy I need to talk to you
Call me daddy help me through
And then he bowed his head to pray call me dad

The little boy became a man found a bride and took her hand
And made a baby all their own
As he looked in that baby's eyes as the baby cried
He swore you'll never be alone

Call me daddy when you're feeling blue
Call me daddy and I'll talk to you
Call me daddy and I'll help you through
And then he bowed his head to pray call me dad

Another life has come and gone another baby's grown
And stands alone against the world
As he looks into the sky he begins to cry
And says daddy I miss you

Call me daddy I'm feeling blue...
