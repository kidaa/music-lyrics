When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, whoa, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me and soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer, or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there, yes, I'll be there
You've got a friend

If the sky above you should turn dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind should begin to blow
Keep your head together now or call my name out loud
And soon I'll be knocking upon your door

You just call out my name 
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Don't you know that 
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you got to do is call
And I'll be there, yes, I'll be there

Hey, ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
People can be so cold
They'll hurt you, yes, and desert you
Or they'll take your soul if you let them
Ah, but don't you let them

You just call out my name 
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Don't you know that
Winter spring summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there, yes, I'll be there
You've got a friend

You've got a friend
