We saw the moon in Colorado
Made music in Tennessee
We found the gold in El Dorado
It's so good makinG love you and me

These arms they will never hold another
These eyes they are blind to any other
These lips no other girl will ever kiss
This heart it will always feel like this

Only God could stop me loving you only God could tell me not to
He sent you from heaven just to make my dreams come true
When he opened the door that you came walking through
Only God could stop me loving you

Now we struck oil in Oklahoma
Yeah we won the Oscar in Hollywood
We climbed the canyons of Arizona
And baby making love never felt so good

These arms they will never hold another...

Well there ain't no girl in the whole wide world could take away my heart
And there ain't no man who could steal your hand and tear us apart
But there is one God in heaven above
Who gave me love strong enough to call my own

Only God could stop me loving you only God could tell me not to
Only God could stop me loving you only God could tell me not to
