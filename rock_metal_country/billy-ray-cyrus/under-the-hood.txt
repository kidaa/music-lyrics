Well my first love was a little Corvette all done up in lipstick red
I thought it'd last forever till the motor blew
Well I guess I didn't look close enough it's a little bit just like falling in love
Looks don't mean a thing if the heart ain't true

It might be a cool ride smooth lines
Something been custom made out in Hollywood
But when you get done gazing at the outside
You better start checking out the inside
If you want a love built to last you better look real good
And see what's under the hood

Sporty little model standin' by the door
So I took her for a spin on the old dance floor
Headlights shining bright but nobody home
Now I need somethin' that's more my speed
Got a whole lotta time to find what I need
So I put her in park and headed on off for home

It might be a cool ride smooth lines...

Well it might be a cool ride smooth lines...
You better look real good and see what's under the hood
