Well hold on baby something's happening here
I read your body language perfectly clear
But something's fishy baby it's like the cat got your tongue
Well you done proved you ain't shy honey look me in the eye talk some

I know you're there baby I hear you breathing
Let's use some caution lady before proceedin' talk some
Tell me what's your game talk some girl I don't even know your name
Honey I'm here to listen we got coffee in the kitchen talk some

You make me nervous baby don't keep me waiting
Is there some secret you ain't articulating
I've got to ask baby I've got to know
Is there something in your past or is there someone back home

You're into mystery baby but I can do without it
Tonight is history lady if we can't talk about it
You call the signals maybe it's time to pass kick or run
Well honey I ain't hard of hearing come and whisper in my ear talk some

[guitar]

You think it's strange baby I deem it necessary
I've got to have some of your vocabulary
I'm gettin' tired of this game of Tom and Jerry
Dictate your thoughts baby I'll be your secretary

Are you from Detroit are you from Tallahassee
I can't believe you ain't got something to tell or ask me
Don't think it's crazy baby it's just my rule of thumb
How will we know where we're goin' if we don't know where we've been talk some

Well honey I'm here to listen we got coffee in the kitchen talk some
Well you've done proved you ain't shy honey look me in the eye talk some
Talk some talk some talk some talk some talk some talk some talk some
Talk some talk some talk some talk some talk some talk some talk some
