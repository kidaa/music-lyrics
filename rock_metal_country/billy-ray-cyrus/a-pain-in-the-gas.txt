Left for work this mornin'
Without any warnin'
That little tiny gage said it's that time
So I started lookin'
But I just kept on lookin'
As I read the prices there upon those signs

Soon I knew my luck was out
My tank was dry and just about
Put me on my feet and send me cryin'
So I pulled up to a pump
Feeling as dumb as a stump
Grabbed that nozzle and bent over one more time

It's a pain in my gas
It's killin' me so fast
All my hard earned money just thrown away
Blame bin Ladin or Sudan
Irak or Iran
All I know is this a-hurtin' just won't pass
There seems to be a real pain in my gas

So if you see me thumbin'
A-beggin' or a-bummin'
Ponder these three questions that I ask
Who's to blame for all my sorrow
Does relief lie in tomorrow
In the meantime could I borrow
A little cash

'cause there's a pain in my gas
It's killin' me so fast 
All my hard earned money just thrown away 
Blame bin Ladin or Sudan
Irak or Iran
All I know is this a-hurtin' just won't pass
There seems to be a real pain in my gas
Help me doctor there's a deep pain in my gas
Mr president there's a real pain in my gas
