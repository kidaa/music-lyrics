I've been your hound but now I'm breaking this chain
Too late to throw me a bone
I'm sick of fetchin' and sleepin' in the rain
Ole Sparky's hittin' the road

I won't be howlin' round your house won't be scratchin' your door
Won't be howlin' round your house ain't your dog no more

I graduated your obedience school
I'd roll and sit when I was told
Woke up hungry went searchin' for some food
Some other Rover's at the dog food bowl

I won't be howlin' round your house...

[guitar]

The pack you found me with was bayin' at the moon
I begged to follow you home
Tonight I heard 'em they was playin' my tune
Don't bother callin' girl I'm doggone

I won't be howlin' round your house...
Won't be howlin' round your house ain't your dog no more
I ain't your dog no more I ain't your dog no more I ain't your dog no more
