Down in the hills of old Tenntucky
I remember the night that I got lucky
I saw you and you saw me
Where the Cumberland River meets the Tennessee
It's good to be good but I'd rather be lucky
Down in the hills of old Tenntucky

Heard the call of a whippoorwill I thought I smelled a moonshine still
Train whistle moan on down the track taknig me back
Down in the hills of old Tenntucky down in the hills of old Tenntucky

[harmonica]

Heard the call of a whippoorwill...
Down in the hills of old Tenntucky down in the hills of old Tenntucky
