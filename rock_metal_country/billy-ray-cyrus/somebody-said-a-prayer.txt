Just a single mom raising up the kids
Little Tommy's seven now and
Her daughter Justine just turned ten

Pinchin' every cent, laughin' and lovin' and content
You would never think a couple years ago
She almost let her job, her kids, her mind, her life go up in smoke
Right there on the edge right before the fall

Somebody said a prayer, somebody had some faith
Somebody finally hit their knees and asked for help for heaven's sake
Somebody finally found someone who really cares
Somebody said a prayer

He was seventeen and his heart was broke
The middle of the night, a bottle full of pills and a goodbye note
Sittin' on his bed but then he bowed his head
Now I see him every week and every now and then
He talks about that night and the peace that came over him

Talk about a sign, can I get an amen?
Well there were tears on his face
He said look what happened lord

Somebody said a prayer, somebody had some faith
Somebody finally hit their knees and asked for help for heaven's sake
Somebody finally found someone who really cares
Somebody said a prayer

Somebody said a prayer, somebody had some faith
Somebody finally hit their knees and asked for help for heaven's sake
Somebody finally found someone who really cares
Somebody said a prayer

Can I get an amen? Oh
Can I get an amen? Oh
Somebody, somebody said a prayer
Somebody said a prayer
Somebody, somebody said a prayer
