Old Mr. Johnson and his wife attend my church.
Fifty-two years and they still love like it's the first.
He holds the door, she holds his hand, they kiss a little.
He helps her in the truck, she slides right to the middle. 
And so one day I ask him how they keep the fire alive.
He said: "You see two old people, but somethin' down deep inside.

Love is always sixteen.
It's always the same, though people might change 
Its forever young:
Love don't have to turn cold, though lovers grow old.
Love don't have to grow weak, 
'Cause love is always sixteen."

Baby, don't you find it just a little bit peculiar, 
However close we get, we're never too familiar.
Everyday I wake up lovin' you so much it hurts,
And, baby, every kiss we kiss still feels like it's the first.
And it turns me on to know this feeling's never gonna fade.
I'm still gonna want you even when we're old and grey.

Love is always sixteen.
It's always the same, though people might change 
Its forever young:
Love don't have to turn cold, though lovers grow old.
Love don't have to grow weak, 
'Cause love is always sixteen.

Through all of its phases, it's timeless and ageless. 
You're like the sun in a clear morning sky.

Love is always sixteen.
It's always the same, though people might change 
Its forever young:
Love don't have to turn cold, though lovers grow old.
Love don't have to grow weak, 
'Cause love:
'Cause love is always sixteen.
Is always sixteen.
