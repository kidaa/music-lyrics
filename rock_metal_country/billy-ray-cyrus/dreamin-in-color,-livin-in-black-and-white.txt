There's a cruel sun beatin' where there once was a river
Crops are bendin' in the heat but still her dark skin shivers
When you move to the beat of hungry it's a slow achin' journey
She'd hide but there ain't no shelter she'd cry but there ain't no pity yet
The cool of the night reveals the spark of a sweeter life
So she's dreamin' in color and livin' in black and white

Dreamin' in color livin' in stone cold black and white
Sittin' in a grey day leanin' on a bright new tomorrow
Where some rainbow rules will make everything all right
She ain't about to let the blues overcome her
She'll contend with this day to day life
She's just dreamin' in color livin' in black and white

Well it's a gunshot dawn here in the heart of the city
He slides closer to his mama it's months since they've seen daddy
There's a pale light shinin' from a bare refrigerator
By the stained cracked plaster by the cold radiator
But he's sure out beyond these mean streets there lies paradise
So he's dreamin' in color and livin' in black and white

Dreamin' in color livin' in stone cold black and white
Sittin' in a grey day leanin' on a bright new tomorrow
Where some rainbow rules will make everything all right
He ain't about to let the blues overcome him
He'll contend with this day to day life
He's just dreamin' in color livin' in black and white

Dreamin' in color livin' in stone cold black and white
Sittin' in a grey day leanin' on a bright new tomorrow
Where some rainbow rules will make everything all right
They ain't about to let the blues overcome them
They'll contend with this day to day life
They're just dreamin' in color livin' in black and white
They're just dreamin' in color livin' in black and white
Dreamin' in color livin' in black and white
Dreamin' in color livin' in black and white
Dreamin' in color livin' in black and white
