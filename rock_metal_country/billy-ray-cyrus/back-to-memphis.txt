It ain't natural for a delta man
To be surrounded by all this sand
To fear the echoes of live rounds
And to never sleep when the sun goes down
So I'm writing you this letter
To say I miss you more than ever and to promise you this

When I make it back to memphis
I'm gonna take you in my arms
And never let you go
And girl I promise you a kiss
For every day we've missed
'til I make it back to memphis

I'll have to say I think we've done some good
If I had to do it all again I know I would
There's still a few shots every now and then
But they say this thing is finally coming to an end
So this might be my final letter
I say the sooner the better cause I'm ready to come home

When I make it back to memphis
I'm gonna take you in my arms
And never let you go
And girl I promise you a kiss
For every day we've missed
'til I make it back to memphis

She reads his letters everyday, then she puts them all away
Next to his medal and a flag, that she would gladly give back

If it would bring him back to memphis
So he could take her in his arms
And never let her go
Cause she's still waiting for a kiss
For every day they've missed
'til he made it back to memphis

Back to memphis
