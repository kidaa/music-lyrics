I've got a chair, you've got a bed,
We've got a dream or two running through our heads,
You can't cook, and I don't care,
What else is there?

I've got a car, you've got a room,
We can talk all night or make love by the moon,
Feel the love in the air,
What else is there?

[Chorus:]
People talk about troubles
Till there blue in the face,
Run around in circles
That's the whole human race,
I've got my own life figured out,
You're the sweetest thing I've ever found, 
God's smilin' down,
What else is there?

You've got this calm, I'm kinda crazy,
Might be a real cool combination in a baby,
Your eyes, my hair,
What else is there?

[Chorus:]
People talk about troubles
Till there blue in the face,
Run around in circles
That's the whole human race,
I've got my own life figured out,
You're the sweetest thing I've ever found, 
God's smilin' down,
What else is there?

Years from now, even then,
We'll get old and maybe go to bed by ten,
I'll hold your hand to climb the stairs,
What else is there?

Oh, What else is there?
What else is there?
What else is there?
What else is there?
What else is there?
You know what we're talkin' about...
What else is there?
What else is there?
What else is there?...
