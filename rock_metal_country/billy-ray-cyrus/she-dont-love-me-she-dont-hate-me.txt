If I'd a seen her comin'
I'd a prob'ly tried to hide
But I came around the corner
She caught me by suprise
There was no ice cold shoulder
There was no ugly scene
She smiled and didn't say the things
I thought she'd say to me.

Well, it was nothin' like that rainy night
She left and slamed he door
Not only she don't love me
She don't hate me anymore.

Well I felt like some old neighbor
Just some guy that she once knew
You'd never know she loved me
And I broke her heart in two
Was she hidin' her emotions
Did she really get that strong
Right then she turned and introduced me
To her new friend Garth.

And I could tell the way he shook my hand
He'd never heard of me before
Not only she don't love me 
She don't hate me anymore.

[Instrumental]

[Spoken]
No, there was no ice cold shoulder
And there was no ugly scene
She just smiled and didn't say the things
I just knew she'd say to me.

Yeah, she got so caught up in him
My memory's gone I know
Not only she don't love me
She don't hate me anymore.

And I know it might sound crazy
And I don't know what hurts me more
Is it the fact that she don't love me
She don't hate me anymore.

Not only she don't love me 
She don't hate me, anymore...
