I've been waiting for your cell to ring anytime now 
Could've gon' a lookin' but instead I'm sitting here 
Maybe I'm not to certain on what I need 
But a man like me gotta suceed 
And baby let me tell you something 

[CHORUS] 
I could be the one 
That'cha need in your life, even if you don't realise 
We need'a be 
I could be the shining sun 
that'ya need to set you free 
I could be the one 
Yeah baby I could be your number one 

You've been looking but never find whatcha' need 
And then one day it pops out suddenly 
Its me holdin' ya in ya arms all together 
And we look good, lets keep it this way 

[CHORUS] 
I could be the one 
That'cha need in your life, even if you don't realise 
We need'a be 
I could be the shining sun 
that'ya need to set you free 
I could be the one 
Yeah baby I could be your number one 

I know your probably thinkin 
"Watcha talkin bout?!" 
But baby if I aint got nothin 
Then whats it without you? 

[CHORUS] 
I could be the one 
That'cha need in your life, even if you don't realise 
We need'a be 
I could be the shining sun 
that'ya need to set you free 
I could be the one 
Yeah baby I could be your number one
