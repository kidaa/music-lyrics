Though I let you down you stayed by my side
Knowing the truth each time I lied
Though I nearly left you you stayed till the end
I am here now you were there then

You were there then I am here now
You believed in forever and were here somehow
You were my lover my loyal friend
I am here now you were there then

There was a time when you should have been gone
I was so weak and you were so strong
I saw the light through the long endless nights
Thank God I found my way home

You were there then I am here now...
I am here now you were there then
I am here now you were there then
I am here now
