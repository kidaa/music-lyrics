I knew a man called him Sam the Cane few folks even knew his name
But a hero yes was he
He left a boy came back a man still many just don't understand
About the reasons we are free
I can't forget the look in his eyes or the tears he cried
As he said these words to me

All gave some some gave all
Some stood through for the red white and blue
And some had to fall
And if you ever think of me think of all your liberties
And recall some gave all

Now Sandy Cane is no longer here but his words are oh so clear
As they echo throughout our land
For all his friends who gave us all who stood the ground and took the fall
To help their fellow man
Love your country live with pride and don't forget those who died
America can't you see

All gave some some gave all...
And if you ever think of me think of all your liberties
And recall yes recall some gave all some gave all
