Old man knocked on my front door 
With a teenage boy and a couple more from up the road 
He had him by the collar 
Said he caught him shootin'beer bottles 
Down in the holler and somkin' 
I said is that right 
He said, they won't speak when spoken to 
So which one here belongs to you 
And I know one does 
Cause they all started runnin' to your back forty 
When they saw me comin' on my gator 
I look in the eye 

And I said, He's mine that one 
Got a wild-hair side and them some 
There's no surprise what He's done 
He's ever last bit of my old man's son 
If you knew me then 
There 'd be no question in your mind 
You'd know he's mine- yeah he is 

Friday night the football games 
I was livin' for the speakers 
To call the name 
On the back of number thirty-seven 
Just one Forty-five 
And five foot eleven - maybe 

Limelight barely shined on hime 
But everyone still remember when 
He whooped up on that boy way bigger 
For thinkin' that cheap shot our little kicker 
And they threw him out 
Man, you should've, you should've hear me shot 

I yelled he's mine that one 
Got a wild-hair side and then some 
There's No surprise what he's done 
He's every last last bit of my old man's son 
And I'll take the blame 
And claim him every time 
Yeah man, he's mine and he'll always be 
The best thing that ever happened to me 
You can't turn it off like electricity 
I will love him unconditionally 
And I'll take the blame 
And claim him every time 
Yes, sir he's mine 
Thank god, he's mine
