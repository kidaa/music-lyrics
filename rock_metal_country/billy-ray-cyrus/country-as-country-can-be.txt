I grew up on Jones and Tammy Wynette 
Blue collar dollars and the sun on my neck 
Nascar and earnhart, still miss number three 
Hey, I'm just as country as country can be 
Wide open spaces fit me like a glove 
Still live for my truck to be covered in mud 
I got hard workin hands, I got boots on my feet 
And I'm just as country as country can be 

Hey I'm just as country as country can be 
Red, white and blue are the colors I bleed 
I thank the all mighty for the land of the free 
And I'm just as country as country can be 

I hear all this talk about time for a chance 
I can't help but wonder what's wrong with the same 
Who I am already is alright with me 
Though I'm just as country as country can be 

Hey I'm just as country as country can be 
Red, white and blue are the colors I bleed 
I thank the all mighty for the land of the free 
And I'm just as country as country can be 
Hey I'm just as country as country can be
