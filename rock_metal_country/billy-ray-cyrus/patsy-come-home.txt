Mile marker nenety two on forty goin' west
I'd been drivin' without rest the whole night through
I saw this little cardboard sign about to fade away
Made a tear roll down my face with just one line

Patsy come home it said Patsy come home
I bet a mother's watchin' out a window or a lover's waitin' by the phone
No matter who's wrong no matter what you're running from
Somebody's tryin' to tell you they love you Patsy come home

By Little Rock the rain was turning into snow
By now I'd prayed she'd gone back home again
I won't forget for some time the hopeful kind of love
Or the desperation of that cardboard sign

It said Patsy come home Patsy come home...
Somebody's tryin' to tell you they love you Patsy come home
