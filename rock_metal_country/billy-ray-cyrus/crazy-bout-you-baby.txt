Call me the biggest the fool the world's seen yet
I've been goo-goo ga-ga since the day we met
I admit that I've gone insane
I go all to pieces when I hear your name
Light in the head weak in the knees
Girl you got me beggin' baby please please please

Crazy bout you baby what can I do
Crazy bout you baby I'm in love with you
Everything about you makes my heart go boom
Crazy bout you baby

Girl I get the shivers everytime we touch
This ain't your ordinary schoolboy crush
Spend all day dreamin' how it's gonna be
When the sun goes down and you're next to me
Holdin' you close feels so right
Kissin' and a huggin' and a lovin' all night

Crazy bout you baby what can I do...

[guitar]

Crazy bout you baby crazy bout you baby

Crazy bout you baby what can I do...

Spend all day dreamin' how it's gonna be
When the sun goes down and you're next to me
Holdin' you close feels so right
Kissin' and a huggin' and a lovin' all night

Crazy bout you baby what can I do...
Crazy bout you baby crazy bout you baby
Crazy bout you baby crazy bout you baby
Crazy bout you baby crazy bout you baby
