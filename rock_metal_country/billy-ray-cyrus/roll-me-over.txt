Reckless and wild in the clutch
I didn't care if it was tackle or touch
I never ever asked you for much
Yet you're drivin' me crazy and things of such

Roll me over ooh roll me over ooh
You straighten me up just enough to roll me over

You don't ask I don't do
I can't believe what you put me through
Yet you say I've embarased you
But son you ain't walked a mile in my shoes

Roll me over...

[guitar]

Monkey see monkey do some day the tide will turn on you

Roll me over...

Roll me over roll me over roll me over roll me over
You straighten me up just enough to roll me over
