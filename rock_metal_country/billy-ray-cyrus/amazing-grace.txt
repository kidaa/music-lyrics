Amazing grace how sweet the sound 
That saved a wretch like me
Well I once was lost but now I'm found
I was blind
But now I see

Twas grace
That taught my heart to feel
And grace my fear relieved
Our precious debt
That grace of his
When I, I first believed

When we've been there
Ten thousand years
Bright shining is the sound
Well we know the last day
I'll sing Gods sweet praise
And when we first begun

Amazing grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
Well once was lost
Oh, but now I'm found
I was blind 
But now I see

I was blind
But now I see
