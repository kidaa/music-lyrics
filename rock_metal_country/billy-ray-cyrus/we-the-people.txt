The farmers rise up every morning at five
The truckers drive them eigteen wheelers all night
The factory workers they build it with pride
Twenty-four seven down the assembly line
In every city in every town
Somebody's got to make the world go round

We the people move it we the people know
We the people we run the country
We the people prove it we're the heart and soul
We the people we are the country

Here's to every salesman on the telephone line
And every waitress working hard for those dimes
The middle managers who punch overtime
And anyone fighting wars fires and crimes
Day after day year after year
The mint might print them but the buck stops here

We the people move it...

We pay the taxes we pay the bills
So they better pay attention up on Capitol Hill

We the people move it...

We the people choose it we the people vote
We the people we run the country
We the people rock it we the people roll
We the people we are the country

We the people move it...
