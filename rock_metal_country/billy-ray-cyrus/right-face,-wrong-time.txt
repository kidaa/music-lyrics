First time I held you I knew the feelings that we shared were true
Now the miles take me away they're gettin' longer every day
And I don't know what to do

Right face the wrong time for love you are all I can think of
Is this the way love has to be you there instead of here with me
Right face but the wrong time for love

When we're together it feels so right all the way you love me day and night
Then this world pulls us apart we suffer through another broken heart
Is it worth this damned abuse

Right face the wrong time for love...

[guitar]

Aren't you a dreamer just like me can't we make it what we want it to be
Or is there just no use

Right face but the wrong time for love...

Right face but the wrong time for love
Right face but the wrong time for love
Right face wrong time right face wrong time
