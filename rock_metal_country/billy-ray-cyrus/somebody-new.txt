I wish you all the best love love and happiness love
And everything you'd ever want to have see or do
And from the bottom of my heart I hope you never find somebody new

Anyone that tells you that broken hearts mend easy
Has never ever loved the way that I have loved you
As long as there's a chance for us I hope you never find somebody new

You have not convicted me yet you're gone
My heart still says there's something going on
And until I know we're finally through
I hope you never find somebody new

I'm acting like an actor dancing like a dancer
But when the curtain falls I always call out for you
As long as I still love you I hope you never find somebody new

You have not convicted me yet you're gone...
I hope you never find somebody new
