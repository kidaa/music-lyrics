This is just a business call it won't take no time at all
If she don't wanna talk that's fine tell her that I got those papers signed
I'm sure that she'll be glad to know this thing is finally coming to a close
That was really all I had to say but since we're talking hey by the way

How's my world treatin' you are you happy there in my shoes
While I've got you on my phone tell me does she make you feel at home
You've got everything I had to lose is she making all your dreams come true
Oh tell me how's my world treatin' you

She used to treat me like a king oh she was my everything
You took my castle and you stole my crown
When you walked in and turned my world around

How's my world treatin' you...

[guitar]

How's my world treatin' you...
How's my world treatin' you how's my world treatin' you
How's my world treatin' you how's my world treatin' you
How's my world how's my world
