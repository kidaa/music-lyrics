Well it seems you thought it over and you feel I'm not the one
And you think you might do better on your own
You say lover's vows only hold you down so I guess I'm moving on
But what'll you think about me when I'm gone

What'll you think about me when I'm gone said and done
When old mem'ries fall like footsteps will you think it's me coming home
Well I thought your eyes could see compromise
But that's one thing you've never done
What'll you think about me when I'm gone

Will some other's kiss taste sweeter or will my pictures haunt your room
Will it make your nights pass easier or will you think you were a fool
When my pillow's bare and you're lying there will a heartache linger on
What'll you think about me when I'm gone
What'll you think about me when I'm gone
