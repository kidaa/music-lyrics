Well the warden let the prisoner down the hallway to his doom
I stood up to say goodbye like all the rest
And I heard him tell the warden just before he reached my cell
Let my guitar friend playing my last request

So let's sing me back home the song I used to hear
Make my old mem'ries come alive
Take me away and turn back the years
Sing me back home fore I die

[fiddle - guitar]

I recall last Sunday morning a choir from off the street
Came in to sing a few old gospel songs
And I heard him tell the singers there's a song my mama sang
Could I hear it once before you move along

So let's sing me back home the song I used to hear...
Won't you sing me back home fore I die
