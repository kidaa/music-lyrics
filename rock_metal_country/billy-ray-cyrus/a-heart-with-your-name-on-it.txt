Girl I've got somethin' just a waitin' for you
That's gonna make you smile and never leave you blue
I've carried it around waitin' for the right time
To give it to you and make you mine
Just give it a chance and you're gonna want it
Cause I've got a heart with your name on it

It beats strong it beats true
And you'll love the love that it's gonna give you
You might as well take it you already own it
I've got a heart with your name on it
I've got a heart with your name on it

I could feel the heat when I look in your eyes
You were carvin' your name with a burnin' fire
Now I'm a brand new man branded with the thought of you
Holdin' me tight the whole night through
All you've gotta do is say that you want it
Cause I've got a heart with your name on it

It beats strong it beats true...

[guitar]

Well it beats strong it beats true...
I've got a heart with your name on it
