I've been walking up and down this road 
Missing something, searching high and low 
Grabbing anything I could hold 
Holding tight and never letting go 
Talking too much of everything I wanted 
Got me thinking about what I really need 
The only thing I'm taking when I'm leaving 
Is something to believe in 

What good is a heart not loving 
What good are those arms not hugging 
What good is that smile you're smiling 
Till you give it to somebody 
Take a look at that life you're living 
All you're got and all you've been given 
What good is all the good you're getting 
Till you give it to somebody 
Whoa whoa whoa 
You gotta give it to somebody 

You see the little moments everywhere 
When all somebody needed was somone who cared 
Someone to say, left me help you there 
Is there anything I can do 
I still remember the way it felt 
To feel a helping hand when I needed help 
And the words what good is what you've got give 
If you keep it all to yourself 

What good is a heart not loving 
What good are those arms not hugging 
What good is that smile you're smiling 
Till you give it to somebody 
Take a look at that life you're living 
All you're got and all you've been given 
What good is all the good you're getting 
Till you give it to somebody 
Whoa whoa whoa 
You gotta give it to somebody 

What good is a heart not loving 
What good are those arms not hugging 
What good is that smile you're smiling 
Till you give it to somebody yeah 
Take a look at that life you're living 
All you're got and all you've been given 
What good is all the good you're getting 
Till you give it to somebody 

What good is all the good you're getting 
Till you give it to somebody 
Whoa whoa whoa 
You gotta give it to somebody
