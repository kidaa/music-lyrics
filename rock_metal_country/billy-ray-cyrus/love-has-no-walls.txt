Yeah alright
There's a church on the corner in a harbor town
Where the stained glass lets the sunshine through
When Sunday morning rolls around
The people come to hear about the truth

The choir sings "Amazing Grace"
Then you could hear the Preacher say

Love has no walls
Love needs no space or time
Reach out your heart

One day a hurricane swept through that town
Worst storm you ever did see
Next Sunday morning when no church could be found
The people still gathered out in the street

The choir sang 'Amazing Grace'
Then, you could hear the Preacher sayin'

Love has no walls
Love needs no space or time
Reach out your heart
'Cause love has no walls, yeah
Alright, reach out your heart

There's a church on the corner in a harbor town
They're singing about amazing grace

Love has no walls, alright
Love needs no space or time
Reach out your heart
'Cause love has no walls, yeah, alright

Love needs no space or time
Reach out your heart
'cause love has no walls
Yeah, alright
Love needs no space or time
Reach out your heart
