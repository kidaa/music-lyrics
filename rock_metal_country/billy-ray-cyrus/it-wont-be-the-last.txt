First time I laid eyes on you I knew it must be love
From the moment you first spoke to me you're all I could think of
First time we were together oh the time just went so fast
I recall when you first kissed me and said it won't be the last

Now it's the first time that I call our home to find out it's not mine
It's the first time I reach out for you but you're not there to find
It's the first time that I call your name to realize it was the past
It's the first time that you broke my heart it won't be the last

I think back on yesterday being in your lovin' arms
Not like the dreams that we let slip away the memories live on
Cause I pray to God for answers to all the questions that I asked
Another night of missin' you it won't be the last

It's the first time that I call our home...
It's the first time that you broke my heart but it won't be the last
