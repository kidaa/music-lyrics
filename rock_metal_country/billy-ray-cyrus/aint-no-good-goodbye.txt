Look at me darling look in my eyes
Well as you know me you fill my mind
Words don't come easy from a man's broken heart
Think that I love you it's be enough to part

Lonely yes my world was so lonely till you walked into my life
And now there's a sigh and tears fill our eyes
Cause there ain't no good goodbye
Baby mhm my baby there ain't no good goodbye

Mhm mhm...
Lonely yes my world was so lonely...
