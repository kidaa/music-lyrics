It's 3 am and I can't sleep
I'm watching war on my TV without the sound
My family is tucked in tight
But somehow God I feel like I let You down

Did I forget to pray
Yeah, get down on my knees
Thank You for the things
Everything I need today
There's a cross around my neck
To remind me that You're never far away
Have I been missin' all the things 
That You really have to say
God, did I forget to pray

We're all blessed here on my block
Is that where I let my heart stop
There's a world out there
I see all that pain and sufferin'
I been so busy doin' nothing
I forgot to care

Did I forget to pray
Yeah, get down on my knees
Thank You for the things
Everything I need today
Here's a cross around my neck
To remind me that You're never far away
Have I been missin' all the things 
That You really have to say
God, did I forget to pray

There's a cross around my neck
To remind me that You're never far away
Did I forget to listen
Was I too wrapped up in doin' things my way
God, did I forget to pray

God, did I forget to pray
