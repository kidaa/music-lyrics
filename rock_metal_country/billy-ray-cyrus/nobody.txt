Nobody came one night in May
No one to love her on that day
Story goes the rest
Is just a shame

There was no mothers open arms
No daddy there to shield her from the harm
Just another face without a name

Nobody wins...nobody gains
Nobody there to keep the baby from the rain
It's so unfair.....we all lose
Nobody there to sing a lullaby a love song or the blues
Nobody wins

Years passed and young got old
Things happened, nobody knows
Father Time stole her life away
They found her in an alleyway
A cold night in the month of May
And nobody....shed a tear...

Nobody wins....nobody gains
Nobody there to keep the baby from the rain
It's so unfair...we all lose
Nobody there to sing a lullaby a love song or the blues
Nobody wins
