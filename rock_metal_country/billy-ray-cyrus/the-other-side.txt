Oh I've heard about the streets of gold
Since I was just a kid
Stories that my grandpa told
The truths that he unhid
Preacher man sang a song of love
Our Savior was his pride
And he told of the perfect place
Just beyond the other side

Well there won't be no more sickness
Sorrow, death or pain
The sun will shine forever
No more darkness, no more rain
Glory hallelujah
Will echo through the halls
The other side is waitin'
Should our maker come to call

The other side is perfect
It was made just for a king
At the right hand of Almighty God
The angels start to sing
And the light surrounds Your very soul
The truth You cannot hide
The pearly gates will open
If You reach the other side

The other side is perfect
It was made just for a king
At the right hand of Almighty God
The angels start to sing
And the light surrounds Your very soul
The truth You cannot hide
The pearly gates will open
If when You reach the other side

The wait'l sure be worth it
When You reach the other side
Oh, the other side
