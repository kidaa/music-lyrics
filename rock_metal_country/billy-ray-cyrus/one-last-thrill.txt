So I'll be leavin' this house without you
That's the last thing I thought I'd ever do
How could we come so far and be so close
And have such a distant point of view
I won't stand here and cry over differences
I won't say things I'll regret
I'll be on my way with this broken heart
But the mem'ries I'll caress
Darlin' would you honor this last request

Let's take one last drive just one last time
And go up on old lovers hill
Let's take one last look at those city lights
Like the first time we come up here and learned how to feel
Let's take one last look at those stars that shine
I remember how it was still
Then let me take one long lasting look at your face
Give me one last kiss one last thrill

Then I'd be happy and I'd take you home
You wouldn't even have to ask me in
By then I'll be like a stranger baby
But I'll walk you to the door like a gentleman
And I'll drive away and I won't be back
It doesn't matter which way I go
I'll always be on a one way street always down a dead end road
I will always love you and that's all I know

Let's take one last drive just one last time...

Then let me take one long lasting look at your face
Give me one last kiss one last thrill
