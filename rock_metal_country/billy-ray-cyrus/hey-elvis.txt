Hey Elvis won'tcha come back home
I left a message on your Code-A-Phone
I tried to reach you but I can't get through
Hey Elvis where the hell are you

Somebody saw you at the shopping mall
Somebody said they heard that southern drawl
Hey Elvis is it really true we're all waitin' for a sign from you

Everybody knows about your pink Cadillac
Everybody's wonderin' when you're comin' back
Everybody's waitin' just to hear you sing
Hey Elvis you're still the king

Hey Elvis won'tcha come back soon
Nobody's rockin' in the jungle room
Come December don't know what we'll do
Be a blue Christmas without you

Everybody knows about your pink Cadillac...

[guitar]

Love me tender don't be cruel return to sender stuck on you
It's now or never suspicious minds hey Elvis aren't you lonesome tonight

Hey Elvis can't you see they need you back in Memphis Tennessee
They're makin' records but there's nothin' new
Nobody ever done it quite like you

Everybody knows about your pink Cadillac...

Everybody knows about your Lisa Marie
Everybody knows about TCB
Everybody's waitin' just to hear you sing
Hey Elvis you're still the king

Come back to Memphis Elvis you're still the king
