I know you've seen all your dreams turn to dust
I know your heart's been left in the rain to rust
But you won't be lonely now

I see a long trail of tears in your eyes
Back to the day when the innocence died
But you won't be lonely now

I wanna give you everything you need I wanna show you
You won't be lonely you won't be lonely now

Holding you here like a rose in the dark
I make this promise to you from my heart
You won't be lonely now

I wanna give you everything you need...

I'll do anything to make you see how I'm gonna love you
You won't be lonely you won't be lonely now

Now that you're here in my arms I'm alive
For the first time in a long time
I look at my face in the mirror and see
The man that I've wanted to be

I wanna give you everything you need...
I'll do anything to make you see...
