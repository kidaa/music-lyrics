I hear you just got married took a month long honeymoon
A new love smiles at the weddin' you cried when you kissed the groom
I got no invitation I guess the mailman didn't bring it to me
But I see the whole thing in slow motion everynight as I try to sleep

My buddy John said you looked real pretty and you acted like you were in love
He said the preacher asked for objections and he thought about standing up
I told John he must been crazy cause you were just about to say I do
He just gave me a wink and said all he could think was it could've been me with you

It could've been me standing there with you
It could've been me and my dreams coming true
But those dreams move on if you wait too long
It took me till now to see it could've been me

I don't guess I ever told you that I went out and bought you a ring
I even carry it around in my pocket waitin' to say the right thing
I pulled it out the other day but the diamond had lost it's shine
Well I know how it feels cause my eyes grow dim
When I think you could have been mine

It could've been me standing there with you...

I know I called just in time a bit too late
You know dreams move on if you wait too long
It took me till now to see that it could've been me
Standin' there with you

It could've been me standing there with you...
