I like the me I see in your eyes
And knowing that I'm the one that makes you smile
You've given love a name and a face
Showed me that it can be a beautiful place

Everywhere I wanna be in this life is here by your side baby
All I ever wanna do is get lost in lovin' you
Long as you're with me I'm everywhere I wanna be

Your breath on my skin is a tropical breeze
Your kisses send an arctic chill over me
Why wander the planet what could I hope to see
The view when I hold you is amazing to me

Everywhere I wanna be...
