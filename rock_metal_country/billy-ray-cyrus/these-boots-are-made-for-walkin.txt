You keep a sayin' you got something for me
Something you call love but confess
You've been messin' where you shouldn't been a messin'
And now someone else is gettin' all your best

Well these boots are made for walkin' and that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

You keep lyin' when you oughta be truthin'
And you keep loosin' when you ought enough bad
You keep a samin' when you oughta be changin'
Now what's right is right and you ain't been right yet

Well these boots are made for walkin'...

[guitar]

You keep playin' where you shouldn't be playin'
And you keep thinkin' that you'll never get burned
Well I've just found me a brand new box of matches
And what she knows you ain't had time to learn

Well these boots are made for walkin'...
