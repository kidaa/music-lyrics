Too many broken promises too many trail of tears
Too many times you were left cold for oh so many years

Too many times you walked away and was made to feel ashamed
And though you only tried to give you were often blamed

[mandolin]

How can this world be so dark so unfair and so untrue
How did the cards of life fold right on top of you

[guitar]

God in heaven hear my prayer ff you are still above
Send the children hopes and dreams and lots and lots of love

For this I only ask of you to conquer all their fears
And let them soar like eagles across the trail of tears
