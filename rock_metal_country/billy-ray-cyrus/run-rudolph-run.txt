Run run Rudolph Santas gotta make it to town
Santa make em hurry tell him he can take a freeway down
Run run Rudolph we go like a merry go round

Said Santa to a boy child what have you been longing for
All I want for Christmas is a rockin roll electric guitar 
And away went Rudolph whizzing  like a shooting star

Run run Rudolph Santas gotta make it to town
Santa make em hurry tell him he can take a freeway down
Run run Rudolph we go like a merry go round

Said Santa to a girl child what would please you most to get
A little miley doll that can cry sleep drink and wet
Then away went Rudolph whizzing like a savor jet
