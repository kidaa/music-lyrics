My bags are packed this evening you know I'll soon be leaving
It's gonna be another long night hmm a long long night
I know that we just said hello now it's time for me to go
You wouldn't want me to miss my flight not out of mind but out of sight
I ain't even left and it already don't feel right

How in the hell can we let love grow when the only thing we ever know
Is I'll call you or you call me love is blind so I can't see
The only thing I know is baby
I ain't even left and it already don't feel right

I ain't even left and it already don't feel right
All I know is I can't control this missing you inside
Loneliness like I've neven known till you walked into my life
And I ain't even left and it already don't feel right
And I ain't even left and it already don't feel right

[guitar]

I ain't even left and it already don't feel right...
