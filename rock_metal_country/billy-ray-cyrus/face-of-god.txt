When my little girl gets that sleep in her eyes,
And she settles in with her head on my chest,
Why do I feel like my heart's gonna burst?
That I'm willing to die for this angel at rest?

And why am I filled with unshakeable faith,
When I look at that child so fragile and sweet?
There's something eternal I see in her face,
Something much more than her mother and me.

Maybe I'm looking at the face of God. 
Makes me think I may be looking at the face of God, 
And He's smiling back at me.

Why do I feel like the smallest of things,
When I try to count all the stars in the sky?
When I see the world that we're in at it's worst, 
Why do I feel like it'll all be all right?

I can't see the wind as it moves through the trees. 
So how do I know that I know that I know,
That somebody out there is speaking to me?
Saying: "I love you and you're not alone."

Maybe I'm looking at the face of God.
Makes me think I may be looking at the face of God, 
And He's smiling back at me.

Oh, I know that I know that I know that He's out there. 
Somebody's out there.
When I look at the beauty around me,
And the love that surrounds me. 

Maybe I'm looking at the face of God.
Makes me think I may be looking at the face of God, 
And He's smiling back at me.
Maybe I'm looking at the face of God.
And He's smiling back at me.
