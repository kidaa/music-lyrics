I've been on the road since I was a kid
I was born to lead this life I live
Fate placed me among the chosen few
I'm a man with a mission got a job to do

Rock this planet rock this planet rock this planet rock this planet
The world needs rockin' and I ain't stoppin' till it's done

Well I'd love to stay baby but I've got to run
People everywhere need to have some fun
I've got the message that'll set 'em free
The whole dang world is depending on me

To rock this planet rock this planet...

[guitar]

We did a show in Tokyo they ate it up
Paris and Rome couldn't get enough
When we were done in London we were Berlin bound
We cranked it up till the Wall came down

Rock this planet rock this planet...
Rock this planet rock this planet...
The world needs rockin' and I ain't stoppin' till it's done
