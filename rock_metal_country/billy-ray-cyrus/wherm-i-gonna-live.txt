Where'm I gonna live when I get home
My ole lady's throwed out everything I own
She meant what she said when she wished I was dead
So where'm I gonna live when I get home

I knew our road was gettin' kinda rocky
She said I was gettin' way too cocky
She waited till I was gone she packed from dusk till dawn
So where'm I gonna live when I get home

Where'm I gonna live when I get home...

[piano - guitar]

She decided she would keep my cat
My transportation I wouldn't be a needin' that
She kept my TV the bills she gave to me
So where'm I gonna live when I get home

Where'm I gonna live when I get home...

Where'm I gonna live when I get home
Where'm I gonna live where'm I gonna live
Where'm I gonna live when I get home
