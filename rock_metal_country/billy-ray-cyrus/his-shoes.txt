I remember the time before you were mine
And I was dying to be in his shoes
Now he's gone away and I'm in his place
But his mem'ry hasn't moved
The shadow he cast just grows larger than life
How can the past cut two hearts like a knife

I can't walk away but how can I stay
Any way I step I lose
My back's to the wall I stumble and fall
Trying to live my life in his shoes

He wasn't a saint so what are these chains
He holds on both of us
You give it your best but you can't forget
And my love's not strong enough
To put out a fire that someone else lit
Or walk in the footprints that never will fit

I can't walk away but how can I stay...
I can't walk away but how can I stay...

[guitar]

In his shoes in his shoes in his shoes
Trying to live my life in his shoes
