When I was just a little boy,
I wandered through the woods
Searchin' for my daddy through the pines.
I guess I took a wrong turn
Somewhere along the way 
But the Bible said
"Seek and ye shall find"
Daylight turned to darkness
Adventure turned to fear
And, when I found my way back home
His words I still can hear...

[Chorus:]
Stand Still!
When you're in the dark. 
Listen to your heart
And pray for Gods will
Stand Still
Adrift in the wind...
Your voice within
Will be your best friend
Stand Still... and pray 
Stand Still

Now that I'm a grown man
On my own and on my way
I've got my own decisions to be made
And when I'm at the crossroads
Unforsure and unforeseen,
I bow my head
And with these words I pray.

[Chorus]
