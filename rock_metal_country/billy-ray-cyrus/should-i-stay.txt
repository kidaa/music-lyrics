I can feel your teardrops on my shoulder
I don't know what to say or what to do
You're the one who told me it was over
You said this love affair was all but through

Well I know that there's two sides to every story
And that's what's going on inside my soul
Cause my heart is saying leave and you'll be sorry
But my mind is saying it's time for me to go

And my heart says I should stay but my mind says I should go
Should we end our love today or should we let it grow
And my heart says I should stay but my mind says I should go
Tell me if you love me let me know tell me should I stay or should I go

To think of me without you I'm so lonely
Cause you're the one who helped me for so long
All the nights we'd lay to love each other
With the radio playing our favorite song

And I remember when you told me you first loved me
With teardrops in my eyes I said I love you too
And my heart still feels the same and will forever
But my mind is telling me that we're all through

And my heart says I should stay...
Should I stay or should I go tell me please I need to know
