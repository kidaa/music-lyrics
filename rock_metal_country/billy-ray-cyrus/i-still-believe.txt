Pick up the phone
I know you're home
I see your silhouette
From this rainy pay phone booth
I didn't mean what I said
I'm sorry I snapped and lost my head
Those angry words were so far from the truth

[Chorus:]
Baby, I still believe in love
Baby, I still believe in both of us
I'd die before I'd ever let you go
Until you're in my arms again
I'll fight for you 'til the very end
I still believe

[Bridge:]
I was wrong and I admit it
Hey, I was out of line
Now I pray my heart
Somehow can change your mind

[Chorus:]
Baby, I still believe in love
Baby, I still believe in both of us
I'd die before I'd ever let you go
Until you're in my arms again
I'll fight for you 'til the very end
I still believe
