I looked for you in the morning with the sunrise
And I searched for you all day through
And at night as I lay my head down on my pillow
I closed my eyes and dreamed only of you

Someday somewhere somehow I know that I will be with you
Someday somewhere somehow my dreams of us together will come true
Someday somewhere somehow

[guitar]

Not a second ticks off the clock that you don't cross my mind
And with every beat of my heart I'm by your side
But the truth of the matter is it's make believe
And my love once again has been denied

Someday somewhere somehow...
Someday somewhere somehow
