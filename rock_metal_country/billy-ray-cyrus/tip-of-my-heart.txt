It's on the tip of my heart, the words to say
But I fall apart and then I walk away
There's an angry world pressed against my back
And down every turn I keep looking back

And I know You promise me
Love through eternity
So why can't I just hold on

I want to live, I want to love
But I'm afraid my simple faith will never be enough
I want to laugh, I want to be set free
And let You hold all that my soul has deep inside of me
But I don't know where to start
It's on the tip of my heart

So want You take my hand
Because I'm sinking in
To this life I've made, but don't understand
The clock moves so slowly
Time goes so fast
But in this world wind world that will never last

This love You're giving me
It's not just make believe
Help me to just hold on

I want to live, I want to love
But I'm afraid my simple faith will never be enough
I want to laugh, I want to be set free
And let You hold all that my soul has deep inside of me
But I don't know where to start
It's on the tip of my heart

Open the sky's 
Open my eyes
And all my fears scatter away
So I walk in grace, 'cause I've seen Your face
And You are all that matters to me

I'm gonna live, I'm gonna love
I'm not afraid because Your grace will always be enough
I want to laugh, I want to be set free
And let You hold all that my soul has deep inside of me
I want to live, I want to love
I'm not afraid because Your grace will always be enough
I want to laugh, I want to be set free
And let You hold all that my soul has deep inside of me

But I don't know where to start
It's on the tip of my heart
