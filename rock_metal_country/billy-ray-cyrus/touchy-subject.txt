I'll sit and talk baby all night long
We can discuss whatever you want
We'll share our secrets our little white lies
Before we're through we'll be bona fide worldly-wise
But thtere's one thing I wanna leave in the past
So don't bring it up don't even ask

Cause that's a touchy subject let's not talk about it
Right now I can't explain it I'm better off without it
Oh I'm begging you please
Don't even whisper one little word about love
Cause that's a touchy subject with me

Don't take the shine off our moment together
It's way too soon to talk about forever
Go ahead and get a little closer to me
But darlin' won't you do me one courtesy
Let's hold off on our wants and our needs
We both know right where that leads

And that's a touchy subject let's not talk about it...

[sax]

Touchy subject it hurts to talk about it
It starts rainin' mem'ries and I feel like I'm drownin'
Oh I'm beggin' you please
Don't even whisper one little word about love

Cause that's a touchy subject let's not talk about it
Right now I can't explain it I'm better off without it
It's a touchy subject let's not talk about it
Can't explain it it's a touchy subject
