I will crawl through your grief I will cry till I drown
Cut a path through your dark till I'm lost and you're found
Turn your black into gray I won't hurt when I bleed
I'll give up my desire till you get what you need

Ask me I'll be there whenever you fall
To do anything everything nothing at all
I'll move any mountain that keeps you from me
I'll change rearrange disappear in your dreams
Please don't ask me to let go or make me give up
Cause I love you that much and I will it'll kill me but I will

I'll never say that I know how you feel
But I know in your heart that those demons are real
So don't push me out and I won't pull you in
I won't let you lose if you'll let me win

Ask me I'll be there whenever you fall...

[guitar]

If you can just look past your fear
You'll see me standing right here

Ask me I'll be there whenever you fall...
