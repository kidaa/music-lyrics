She used to cry when I'd come home late she couldn't buy the lies I told
All she wanted was to be needed someone that could call her own
Her love I know I took for granted until she walked out of my door
Too little too late to say I'm sorry cause she's not cryin' anymore

She's not cryin' anymore and she ain't lonely any longer
There's a smile upon her face a new love takes my place
She's not cryin' anymore

[guitar]

I guess she's really doin' well now she's picked herself up off the ground
I wasn't there when I was needed but I was there to let her down
Sometimes you know I feel so foolish if I knew then what I know now
Another tear would never fall cause I'd give our love my all
If we could work things out somehow

She's not cryin' anymore...
She's not cryin' anymore...
