Saw you at the football games 
Everybody knew your name 
Once or twice I'd see you smile at me 
I was scared to ask you out 
I was sure that you would turn me down 
But I took that chance 
Cause how would that be 
Then what do you know 
you said you'd go and there we were 

Walking barefoot down by the water 
Sun was hot 
But you made it hotter 
Found that shade tree there by the riverbank 
Sitting there, our toes all muddy 
That first kiss 
was sweeter than honey 
And every time that I look back 
I say, man That was a good day 

We all have our memories 
The ones we lose 
The ones we keep 
The one we know we'll always hold on to 
I've had my days, good and bad 
But the best ones that I've has 
Always seem to start and end with you 

Yeah, those are the times 
I know that I won't forget 
Like that july 4th hugged up by the levy 
You squeezed me hard 
And told me you loved me 
Fireworks flying 
Talking our breath away 

Felt like we were melting together 
Thinking I could do this forever 
And every time that I look back 
I say, man that was a good day 
When we're finished with this ride 
And we on the other side 
Bet we'll look back on this life 

And say man that was a good day 
Man that was a good day 
Man that was a good day 
Man that was a good day 
Man that was a good day 
Man that was a good day 
Oh that, was a good day 
Man that was a good day 

I saw you at the football games 
Everybody knew your name 
Once or twice I'd seen you smile at me
