You heard the boss man call
I dread when that phone rings
Everytime... It's the same ole thing
I gotta job to do
But that's the easy part
What's really killin' me
Is this broken heart

[Chorus:]
You're hard to leave
Tough to go
A heartache's ahead
This I know
Missin' you
More than the air I breathe
Easy to love
But hard to leave

[Bridge:]
This heart of mine
Is cold and blind
It just wants to find
Your hand in mine

[Chorus]
