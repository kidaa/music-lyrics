Oh, how I love you
And I always will
Forever and ever
Till times standing still
Know that your with me
Like the air that I breathe
I'll be beside you
And fight for your dreams

Cause you are my everything
Everything I am because of you
You are my sunshine, my wind and my rain
You are my everything

All of my sorrow has been washed away
All my tomorrows are with you today
Someone would ask me
Son, what is your dream
I'd show them your picture
And smile at a dream

Cause you are my everything
Everything I am because of you
You are my sunshine, my wind and my rain
You are my everything
You are my everything
You are my everything
My everything
