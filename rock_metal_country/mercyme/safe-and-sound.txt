No more boarding up my windows
So that I can lay low
Nobody's home
No more trying to run away from
Tired of being afraid of
What I can't control
The hardest part I'm always told
Is letting go

Safe and sound knowing that You're big enough to
Wrap around my heart completely
Safe and sound just knowing that You know me

I can finally set my heart free
Lost within the mystery
Of this love I've found
The hardest part I'm always told
Is letting go

The greatest part now I know
Is letting go
