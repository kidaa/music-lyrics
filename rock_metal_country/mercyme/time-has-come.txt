There is a season for everything there is a reason for all things here on earth every second
of every moment seems to have its worth rest assured life's not in vain for all things work
here for His fame.

[chorus]
Time has come to raise our hearts as one and glorify the God of everything we live our lives
for the renown of Christ oh we are children of the sovereign King.

From the moment of our first breath to the second we bid this world goodbye and everything
that is in between was made to magnify The One who holds all things in place The Ruler over
time and space.
[back to chorus]
