I put my hope in You 
I lay my life in palm of your hand 
I'm constantly drawn to You Lord 
In ways I cannot comprehend 

It's the Creator calling the created 
The Maker beckoning the made 
The bride finding what she's always waited for 
When we find ourselves that day 

[CHORUS:]
In You where the hungry feast at the table 
The blind frozen by colors in view 
The lame will dance, They'll dance for they are able 
And the weary find rest 
Oh the weary find rest in You 

It's no secret that we don't belong here 
Those set apart by the grace of You 
And we look for the day when we go to a place 
Where the old becomes brand new
