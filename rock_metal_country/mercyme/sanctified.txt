Let there be no condemnation for all who are fully known in Christ unspeakable grace for all
the nations by way of holy sacrifice we worship with the sound of broken shackles falling to
the ground.

[chorus]
Sanctified i have been set free grace divine has swept me off my feet.

No greater love has ever been known than He who came to find the lost no greater sacrifice has
been shown than He who laid upon the cross let all creation sing for He has come and He's
changed everything. [back to chorus]

And i know that i will never be the same. [back to chorus]
