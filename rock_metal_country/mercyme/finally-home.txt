I'm gonna wrap my arms around my daddy's neck and tell him that I've missed him and tell him
all about the man that i became and hope that it pleased him there's so much i want to say
there's so much i want you to know.

[chorus]
When i finally make it home when i finally make it home.

Then I'll gaze upon the throne of the King frozen in my steps and all the questions that i
swore i would ask words just won't come yet so amazed at what I've seen so much more than this
old mind can hold. [back to chorus]

And the sweetest sound my ears have yet to hear voices on angels. [back to chorus]
