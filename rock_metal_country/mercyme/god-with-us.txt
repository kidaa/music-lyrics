Who are we that You would be mindful of us what do You see that's worth looking our way we are
free in ways that we never should be sweet release from the grip of these chains like hinges
straining from the weight my heart no longer can keep from singing.

[chorus]
all that is within me cries for You alone be glorified Emmanuel God with us my heart sings a
brand new song the debt is paid these chains are gone Emmanuel God with us.

Lord You know our hearts don't deserve Your glory still You show a love we cannot afford like
hinges straining from the weight my heart no longer can keep from singing. [back to chorus]

Such a tiny offering compared to Calvary nevertheless way law it at your feet. [back to chorus]
