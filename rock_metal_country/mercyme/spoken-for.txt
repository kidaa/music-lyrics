Take this world from me
I don't need it anymore
I am finally free
My heart is spoken for

Oh and I praise you
Oh and I worship you...

[CHORUS:]
Covered by your love divine
Child of the risen Lord
To hear you say "This one's mine"
My heart is spoken for

Now I have a peace
I've never known before
I find myself complete
My heart is spoken for

Oh and I praise you
Oh and I worship you...

[CHORUS:]
Covered by your love divine
Child of the risen Lord
To hear you say "This one's mine"
My heart is spoken for

By the power of the cross
You've taken what was lost
And made it fully yours
And I have been redeemed 
By you that spoke to me
Now I am spoken for

[CHORUS:]
Covered by your love divine
Child of the risen Lord
To hear you say "This one's mine"
My heart is spoken for
[2X]

Take this world from me
Don't need it anymore...
