Almost there, almost where I'm supposed to be 
It's not all clear, but you keep showing me 
With every step, the more my heart moves to your beat 
Just like where I'm headed, there's joy in the journey 

[CHORUS:]
Teach me to think like you think 
Show me the things, that are true 
Finish the work you have started in me 
As I'm on my way to you 
As I'm on my way to you 

Create in me a pure heart and make me new 
Less of me, Jesus more of You 
Here I stand, still I'm drawn down to my knees 
It's not my strength, but Your's that carries me 

[CHORUS 2x]

I'm on my way to you [5x]
