I've been walking with a big grin 
Singing with my eyes closed 
Lifting up my hands 
I've been lost in the moment 
Sending up praises 
Now I think I understand 
When I open up and let it flow 
I feel your touch and then I know 

[CHORUS:]
I can never live without it 
And I'm never going to doubt it 
Everyday it's new, yeah 
There's nothing any better 
I'll be singing it forever 
I worship you 

I'm standing on the edge now 
Looking to a new place 
Going deeper still 
The feeling is electric 
The power and the glory 
Just move me where you will 
Cause you take the song and make it fly 
Into my soul and that is why 

[CHORUS]

[BRIDGE:]
I just want to dive into your grace 
I want to feel your presence, seek your face 
I just want to be where you are 

I can never live without it 
And I'm never going to doubt it 
Everyday is new, yeah 
[REPEAT]

[CHORUS]
