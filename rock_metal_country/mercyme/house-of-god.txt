Welcome to the house of God my friend 
All are welcome, all may enter in 
Come experience the peace and hope within 

[CHORUS:]
We come here, for God and God alone 
The house of God 
All draw near, make Yourself at Home 
The house of God 

Come and celebrate His majesty 
Dance and shout like those who've been set free 
It's about you Jesus and all of your glory 

[CHORUS]
