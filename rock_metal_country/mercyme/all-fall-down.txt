Your Word Oh Lord is eternal 
It stands firm 
Your faithfulness continues through all the earth 
All creation hangs on Your every word 

[CHORUS:]
With the sound of Your voice 
Water still, You are Lord over all 
With the touch of Your robe, sick are healed 
For You Jesus we all fall down 

My soul finds rest and comfort 
From only You 
My fortress and my rock 
I won't be moved 
You are my cornerstrone, who's love endures 

[CHORUS]

[BRIDGE:]
And I praise You for I am fearfully and wonderfully made 
And I praise You for I am fearfully and wonderfully made 

[CHORUS 2x]

we fall down, we fall down
