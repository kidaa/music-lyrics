I will worship the one who threw the stars to the night 
I will worship the one who tells the sun to shine 
I will worship You 
I will worship You 

[Chorus:]
My hands I lift to You 
My voice I lift to You 
My heart I lift to You 
Hallelujah 

I will worship the one who calmed the raging sea 
I will worship the one who hushed the rage in me 
I will worship You 
I will worship You 

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Prince of Peace, almighty God 
Counselor, Holy One 
Lion of Judah, Son of Man 
Son of God, the great I Am 
Resurrection and the life 
King of kings, Jesus Christ 

[Chorus 2x]
