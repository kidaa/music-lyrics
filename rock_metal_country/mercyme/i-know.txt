Where do i begin with what to say I've played this conversation in my head so many times I'm
certainly not claiming to know everything but what i do will save your life.

[chorus]
i know, i know that God is able i know, i know that He still reigns i know, i know that love
has found a way.

No matter what it is you're going through even if you think you're far beyond where hope can
see i know there is a hand that's reaching out for you because He did the same for me [back to chorus]

it wasn't that long ago when my own world fell apart, it fell apart and everything here inside
of me said to let go, you must let go i found my self crying out to the One who knows my heart,
He knows your heart and holding tight to the few things that i know [back to chorus]
