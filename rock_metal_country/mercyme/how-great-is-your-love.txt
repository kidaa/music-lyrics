My heart is steadfast of God 
And I will sing 
With all my heart and soul 
Music for the King 
And I will awake the dawn 
With my praise to you O Lord 

[CHORUS:]
How great is Your love 
So much higher than the heavens 
With faithfulness that reaches the sky 
How great is Your love 
So much higher than the heavens 
With faithfulness that reaches the sky 
O how great is Your love 

Praise the Lord O my soul 
And glory to the King 
Forever You are robed with majesty 
We come to you O Lord 
And Lay our praise at your feet 

[CHORUS]

[BRIDGE:]
Be exalted O God and let Your glory reign 
Be exalted O God and let Your glory reign 
Let it reign 
Let it reign 
Let it reign 
Let it reign 
Let it reign 
Let it reign 

[CHORUS]
