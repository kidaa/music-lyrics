I wonder when we first bought into this so satisfied with status quo have we convinced
ourselves that this is all there is well all that is within me says we were meant to break
free. 

[chorus]
live like there's no tomorrow love extravagantly lead a life to be followed goodbye ordinary
goodbye ordinary

We were never meant to compromise settle for mediocrity this life was never made to b a waste
of time well all that is within me says no more just existing. [back to chorus]

No more complacency no more just settling this time goodbye to atrophy for we were meant to be
alive.
[back to chorus]
