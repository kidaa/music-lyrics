My Jesus, I need you now 
May your grace look my way 
To hear you sing over me 
Make your desires and mine the same 

[CHORUS:]
Bless me indeed 
Open wide my horizons to share your name 
Bless me indeed 
Let your hand keep me 
from harm and pain 
Bless me 
Bless me 

Lord I cling to your heart 
Your love is what I need 
All great things come from 
May your greatness fall on me 

[CHORUS]

[BRIDGE:]
The Lord bless and keep you 
May his face shine upon you 
And be gracious and 
give you peace 

[CHORUS]

Bless me
