If you had a dime for every time it rained on this parade you're marching in called life You'd
start to wonder if someone out there's got your number well, hold your head up, breath in deep,
remember.

ooh ooh you know it's gonna be alright ooh ooh you know it's gonna be alright.

We're gonna have those days when it all comes crashing in wondering if the sun will ever shine
before you go and convince yourself you cannot make it hold you head up, breath in deep,
remember.

[chorus]
ooh ooh you know it's gonna be alright ooh ooh you know it's gonna be alright there's a love
much stronger than everything that holds you down right now sayin' ooh ooh you know it's gonna
be alright.

So next time when you tell yourself this isn't worth it hold you head up breathe in deep
remember. [back to chorus]

Count it pure joy when the world come crashin' hold your head up and keep on dancin'
