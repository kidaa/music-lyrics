Well I know the words, but I can't really speak them 
To you 

And I hide all the pain that I've gained with my wisdom 
From you 

And I'm eaten alive by what I hold inside 
All the things that I live with I can't easily hide 
And I'm left here with nothing, nothing to live for 
But you 

It's not easy to hide 
All this damage inside 
I'll carry you with me 
Until I'm not alive 

When you look at my face, does it seem just as ugly 
To you 

I can't seem to erase all the scars I have lived with 
From you 

I'm so sick of this place 
This taste in my mouth 
Cause of you I can't figure what I'm all about 
And I'm left here with nothing, nothing to live for 
But you 

It's not easy to hide 
All this damage inside 
I'll carry you with me 
'Til I'm not alive
