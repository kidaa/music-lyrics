See Thru All  

"WHAT IS YOUR FUCKING PROBLEM!?"  
"...You wanna know what my problem is?  

Alone, I walk beside myself  
Alone, you put me on your shelf  
Alone, with my insanity  
Alone, no one to blame but me  
But if you had told me when I was much younger  
That life has a way of pulling you right under  
I wouldn't be standing here preaching my hate  
I stand at the edge staring into my fate  

CHORUS:  
I see thru you  
What makes you think that you're god  
Pick up the pieces as I fall apart  
Why must you fuck with me  

Betrayed, You left me here for dead  
Betrayed, By the voices in my head  
Betrayed, left my out in the rain  
Betrayed, nothing left but pain  
I'm sick of the answers  
Your cannibal instincts and false dedications  
You leave me here cold, nothing left but my shell  
To die while I'm living and burn in my hell  

CHORUS  

I pick you apart little by little  
Till nothing is left but the look on your face  
Once inside our I can get at what's inside  
Beneath your facade I can see your disgrace 
The walls that you build up will crumble around you  
The pain you will feel as you wither away  
The sun though it comes up will warm you...  
No longer
