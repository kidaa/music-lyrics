It sheltered me from nothing but the weather
I called it home for a moment of my life
This place I see just doesn't look familiar
I wonder if it looks the same inside

So there's the corner that I sat on
The road I walked home in the rain
And there's the star I used to wish on
It all just seems like yesterday

Days go by
Nothing's getting clearer
Can't change my mind
My troubles are the same
Faces change
The names they are familiar
And the streets I see
Will stand the test of time

So there's the corner that I sat on
The road I walked home in the rain
And there's the star I used to wish on
It all just seems like yesterday

And those stars
Stars still shine
Shine down through the rain

And there's the corner that I sat on
The road I walked home in the rain
And there's the star I used to wish on
It all just seems like yesterday

And I stare out this dirty window
As this world goes slowly by
And somewhere out there is the future
That I once thought had passed me by

Sheltered me from nothing but the weather
