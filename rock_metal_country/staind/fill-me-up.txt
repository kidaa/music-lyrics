i just had to let you know
cuz i don't always let it show
you give me needed room to grow
and i just had to tell you so

[chorus]

you fill me up,
you're in my veins
a look could take my breath away
and all these things, you give away
sometimes i take for granted
it's just like poetry inside to hear you breathing by my side
like i'm in heaven and i've died
so glad you're with me for this ride

[chorus]

i see your face to start my day
makes all my bad dreams go away
and all the stupid games we play
wouldn't have it any other way

[chorus x2]
