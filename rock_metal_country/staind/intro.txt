thank you to the people in my life 
for putting up with me
and thank you for the time you sacrificed
all on account of me

[chorus]

for all the times i didn't say
the times i didn't say
for all the times i didn't say
the times i didn't say

fuck you to the jaded and the fake
like to see what you would do
fuck you and the judgements you make
we're not all perfect just like you,
like you, like you

[chorus]

all the times i didn't say [x2]
thank you to the people in my life for putting up with me
