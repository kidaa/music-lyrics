Warm Safe Place 

Another day 
Inside my world 
I'm married to 
you and this road. 
A road that never lets 
me sleep . 
So there's no way to escape the 
demons I am forced to keep. 

And then I find you here 
Through your eyes 
Everything's clear 
And I'm home 
Inside your arms, 
But I'm alone for now. 

I mean the best 
with what I say. 
It doesn't always 
sound that way 
I never learned to 
Work things out cause 
In my family all we 
Ever seem to do is shout 

But then I find you here 
Through your eyes, 
everythings clear 
And I'm home 
inside your arms, 
but I'm alone for now. 

And when I try to sleep- 
the drugs I take 
are killing me - I think of you 
to ease my pain - 
but you're so far- 
Now it's time to say goodbye. 
I love you baby 
please don't cry - 
'cause then I'll find you here - 
Through your eyes everythings clear - 
and I'm home inside your arms - but I'm alone for now. 

But then I find you here 
Through your eyes, 
everythings clear 
And I'm home 
inside your arms, 
but I'm alone for now.
