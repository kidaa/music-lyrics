Misery 
The company it keeps 
Is for me 
All these things 
We keep repeating 

Like a wheel 
That keeps turning 
If I could break away 
From this moment 
Break away 
What is real 
Never showing 
Break away 
How I feel 
If I could break away 

Apathy 
The ignorance it brings 
The tragedy 
Of all these things 
We keep repeating 

Like a wheel 
That keeps turning 
If I could break away 
From this moment 
Break away 
What is real 
Never showing 
Break away 
How I feel 
If I could break away 

Break away 
If I could break away 
Just break away 
If I could break away 
From this moment 
Break away 
What is real 
Break away 
Never showing 
Break away 
How I feel 
If I could break away 
If I could break away 
If I could break away
