I just need this to be all right
I can't feel this another night

I can't take this I come unglued
I just need this to be alright
I can't feel this another night

I can't take this I come unglued
I might breakdown in front of you
necessary to medicate
I'm not sleeping, can't stay awake

Can't see through this
Too much pressure
Drowning in this
Too much pressure

If you need me I'll be here
Half unconscious to escape my fear

I can't take this I come unglued
I might breakdown in front of you
necessary to medicate
I'm not sleeping, can't stay awake

Can't see through this
Too much pressure
Drowning in this
Too much pressure

My head hurts this shit isn't getting me high
My chest is so tight  am I going to die
My stomach's in knots and the room starts to spin
As I wait for this valium to slowly kick in

Can't see through this
Too much pressure
Drowning in this
Too much pressure

TOO MUCH PRESSURE!
