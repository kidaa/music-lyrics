Four Walls 

The thoughts from my mind 
Command my lips say I hate you 
The thoughts from my mind 
Command my hands to cut your silken flesh 
The thoughts from my mind 
Command my feet to stomp your head 
The thoughts from my mind have one question... 
When will this ever end? 

CHORUS: 
Not much to the life I live 
Same 4 Walls 
I have nothing left to give 
Please take it all away.... 
Same 4 Walls 

The thoughts from my mind 
Feel the pain as rats claw at my flesh 

The thoughts from my mind 
Feels the joy as the needles hits my vein 
The thoughts from my mind 
Smells the stench as shit runs down my leg 
The thoughts from my mind ask for sanity 
Now for this I beg 

CHORUS 

The thoughts from my mind 
Command my lips say I hate you 
The thoughts from my mind 
Command my hands to cut your silken flesh 
The thoughts from my mind 
Command my feet to stomp your head 
The thoughts from my mind have one question... 
WHEN WILL I BE DEAD? 

CHORUS
