if someone else showed you the way 
would you take the wheel and steer?
it hurts me that you're not ashamed
of what you're doing here
if they jumped off a bridge
would you meet them on the ground?
or would you try and claim
that it never made a sound

[Chorus]
everyone plays the hand they're dealt
and learns to walk through life themselves
not everything in life is handed on a plate
when people think your words are true
it doesn't matter what you do
i sold my soul to get here
how 'bout you?

so you choose to force your hand
what a strange way to make friends
and you always change the rules
so the drama never ends
and you blindly go through life
judging only by its worth
just try not to forget
that the meek inherit earth

[Chorus]

so please don't take offense
this is just a point of view
cuz i'm the only one who
will say these things to you

[Chorus]
