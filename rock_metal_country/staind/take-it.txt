I feel like this won't go away
no matter how hard I try
to squeeze my eyes shut
so i can't see the pain
in you this pain in me - in me

But everything that I can say to you
Won't help you - everything you need is right in front of you
Just take it

I know that I am really not here
to represent what I am not clear
About in my head sometimes
I feel fucked up just like you do - like you do

But everything that I can say to you
Won't help you - everything you need is right in front of you
Just take it

Try to make it through the daily pain
That you feel - maybe tomorrow won't be so bad.
It know it
'cause I once felt that way
Nothing I could say
Made it go away
I lived through this
I still feel this
I just live for my tomorrow

Make it go away
Just make it go away
She'll make it go away
