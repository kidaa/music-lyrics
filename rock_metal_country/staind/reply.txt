I have seen to many sad eyes look at me,
Eyes that set me free,
All the places that I've been.

Thank you for the letters that you thought you wrote in vain
And for the times you chose to stand out in the rain and wait for me,
For me.

Your words,
Your words help me to see
A little honesty
In a world that doesn't share
And your eyes
Tell the story of your pain
Severity of your disdain
In a world that doesn't care.

So thank you for the letters that you thought you wrote in vain
And for the times you chose to stand out in the rain and wait

You, you understand my pain.
From this I gather strength,
In that we are the same.

So thank you for the letters that you thought you wrote in vain
And for the times you chose to stand out in the rain and wait

The life I live will never be the same without you here
