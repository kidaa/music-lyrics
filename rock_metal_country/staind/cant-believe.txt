Respect
Respect is what is found
Respect should be abound
Respect everything that you leave

I can't believe
Can't Believe

And I, I can't believe
I can't believe all the travesty
Surrounding me, I , I want to flee
I want to flee from everything
In front of me!

Can't Believe

Never again, trusted in you
Fuck everything you think I should be
I stand, never again, never again
