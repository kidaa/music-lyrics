You take this all for granted. All the things that used to be you. By keeping you distracted just long
enough to bleed you.

A reason for your anger, it's what I need, it's what I need. To recognize the truth it's what I need,
it's what I need. So burn your paper Jesus its what I need, it's what I need, and all the things you do,
its what I need, its what I need.

Don't believe what they tell you, all the lies that they are teaching, when the make the corporations all
the desperate people stealing. 

Somebody chose these words for you. Interpretations of the truth. Somewhere behind your fear they hide.
To fill the holes inside.
