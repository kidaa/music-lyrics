I can't believe how far I've come
Watch me stumble and come undone
If you take away, these memories
All that's left, is just me

[Chorus:]
'Cause I don't want this
And I don't take this anymore
And I don't feel this
It seems that even though she's with me I can't shake this
I can't fake this
And I won't take this anymore

So you choose to break my heart
I should have seen this from the start
I'm haunted by your apathy
All that's left is killing me

[Chorus]

Do you believe that the way you choose to be
I've always had to see
The brighter side of this so I don't lose my faith
Now the sun has gone away
It's getting colder everyday
So before I freeze to death there's something I should say

I don't want this
I don't take this anymore
And I don't feel this
It seems that even though she's with me I can't shake this
And I can't fake this
And I won't take this anymore

And though you say you understand you still won't face this
Can't erase this
I won't embrace this anymore
