I feel nothing 
Longing for something 
Lie in bed to take your clothes off 
Show me what you're made of 
Drugs to soothe me 

All alone 
Leave me here I'm dying 
All alone 
Just kicked me in my face 
All alone 
All alone and crying 
All alone 
I suffocate 

I'm not gifted 
Slightly twisted 
Try hard try hard 
To see if I can push you any further 
Drugs to soothe me 

All alone 
Leave me here I'm dying 
All alone 
Just kicked me in my face 
All alone 
All alone and crying 
All alone 
I suffocate 

Please believe you'll save me, rearrange me 
I can feel your feelings running through me 
Take away my sorrow my tomorrow 
Heal me 

All alone 
Leave me here I'm dying 
All alone 
Just kicked me in my face 
All alone 
All alone and crying 
All alone 
I suffocate 

I'm suffocating 
SUFFOCATE come suffocate
