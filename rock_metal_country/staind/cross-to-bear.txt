Twisting, turning, crashing, burning,
All this just to break me down.

You don't know me
You don't see me
You don't own me because I don't care.
But I'm still here,
Patiently waiting for you to disappear.
Is this my cross to bear?

Faceless, faking, pushing, taking,
All this just to bring me down.

[x1]
You don't know me
you don't see me
you don't own me because I don't care.
But I'm still here,
Patiently waiting for you to disappear.
Is this my cross to bear?

You don't know me,
You don't own me cause I'm aware.
And I'm still here,
Patiently waiting for you to disappear.
Is this my cross to bear?

I'm still here,
Reluctantly waiting for you to interfere.
This is my cross to bear
