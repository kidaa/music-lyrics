live in my head for just one day
i see myself andlook away
the road is showing now on my face
soon i'll disappear
I'll disappear without a fucking trace

[chorus]

faces that i've seen turn old and grey
i've lost too many freinds along the way
memories i never thought would fade
they fade and blow away

i wish that icould disappear 
unzip my skin and leave it here
so i could be no one again
and never let nobody,
i'd let nobody
i'd let nobody in

[chorus]

so now the walls are closing in 
because in life you sink or swim
sometimes these shoes don't feel right in my head
feel like a book that can't be read,
a book that can't be,
a book that can't be read

[chorus]
