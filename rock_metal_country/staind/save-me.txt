This dark road 
Another cigarette 
I'm getting sick of this 
The end is near 
I'm in the thick of it 
And i'll be there soon 
If you can handle it 

Just save me 
From all that I am 
You save me 
For the f**k of it 
Save me 
Just hold out your hand 
You save me 
From all of it 

I try to speak myself 
You can do it too 
I need no one's help 
I'm needing only you 
So just pray for me 
And deliver it 
You never take from me 
What i'm giving 

Just save me 
From all that I am 
You save me 
For the f**k of it 
Save me 
Just hold out your hand 
You save me 
From all of it 

And all that i've become 
Is you 
The only good in me 
Is you 
And after all of this 
The day will come to find out 
Will you take me 
Or forsake me 
So pray for me 
Am I forgiven 
For what you take from me 

Just save me 
From all that I am 
You save me 
For the f**k of it 
Save me 
Just hold out your hand 
You save me 
From all of it 
Come save me 

Pray for me 
Am I forgiven
