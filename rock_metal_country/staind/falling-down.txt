What's happened to you?
It's obvious you've changed
Something deep inside you is probably to blame
Must be lonely up there with your head up in the clouds
Even though you got there what does your conscience tell you now?

[Chorus:]
It's never the same on the way down
How does it feel when your feet finally hit the ground?
When all of your bridges aren't around
And the sandcastles you built are falling down

You had us all sitting right there in your hand
But you had to fall because that's how this life is
Got your fingers burned by burning candles at both ends
Now the table's turned and now your demons are your freinds

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

So now I question what you're gonna do
Now that everything's gone with you
You believe the shit you say is true
But everybody's on to you
Life remembers everything you do
Your karma has caught up with you

[Chorus]
