It's Been Awhile 

It's been awhile 
Since I could hold my head up high 
Since I first saw you 
Since I could stand on my own two feet again 
Since I could call you 
But everything I can't 
remember as fucked up as it 
all may seem the consequences 
that I've rendered I've stretched 
myself beyond my means 

It's been awhile 
Since I could say that I wasn't addicted 
Since I could say I love myself as well 
Since I've gone and fucked things 
up just like I always do 
But all that shit seems to 
disappear when I'm with you 
But everything I can't remember 
as fucked up as it may seem 
The consequences that I've rendered, 
I've gone and fucked things up again. 
Why must I feel this way 
Just make this go away, 
Just one more peaceful day 

It's been awhile 
Since I could look at myself straight 
Since I said I'm sorry 
Since I've seen the way 
the candle lights your face 
But I can still remember 
just the way you taste 
But everything I can't remember as 
fucked up as it all may seem to be 
I know it's me I cannot blame this on my 
father he did the best he could for me 

It's been awhile 
Since I could hold my head up high 
and it's been awhile since I said 
I'm sorry
