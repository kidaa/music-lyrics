I'm so lonely 
You're so beautiful 
Not the only 
One that's pitiful 

Scratched and torn I lay here in pieces 
Craving all of your deadly vices 
Like to think that I'm not addicted 
But I guess I wear it well 

And I crawl 
While you spit

Not a lot has changed 
Nothing' better 
Everything's the same 

Late at night I can hear your voices 
Talking shit about all my choices 
You would think you've known me forever 
Just because you know my name 

And I crawl 
While you spit 
And I crawl 
Through you 

Everything falls apart 
Everything... [3x]

Everything falls apart 
Everything [3x]

And I crawl 
While you spit 
And I crawl 
Through
