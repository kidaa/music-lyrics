I'm still scared. Afraid of failing 
Anticipating, the ride to end.
before the wheels begin to move.

Run away So I can hide. 
Run away I've mastered feeling nothing. 
Run away I'm dead inside. 
Run away Why don't I care? 

Waste my time, commiserating, 
Self medicating - it's my design 
Although I know you don't approve

Run away So I can hide. 
Run away I've mastered feeling nothing. 
Run away I'm dead inside. 
Run away Why don't I care? 

The truth is that I'm not so good
At showing how I feel.
Or keeping my mouth shut
When there's something to conceal.
Or knowing how to love,
Love's not in my memories
How can I rise above 
All my insecurities

Run away So I can hide. 
Run away I've mastered feeling nothing. 
Run away I'm dead inside. 
Run away Why don't I care? 

Run away I fight the tide
Run away The ebb and flow consuming
Run away Still by my side
Run away Why should you care?
