You, I trusted your intentions a trust you took advantage of now you are sitting in the hole that you
dug around yourself.

You've lied so much you think it's true
Do you know what the truth is?
How does someone get to be like you?
The king of all excuses?

Is she your partner in deception caught inside the web you've spun?
Did you forget that you were family, the damage you have done?

You've lied so much you think it's true
Do you know what the truth is?
How does someone get to be like you?
The king of all excuses?

I trusted you. I trusted in you.

This time you're gonna get it
All the things you've done coming back to you
This time you're gonna feel it
Your conscience slowly suffocating you
In time you will regret it
Say goodbye to all the things you've gotten used to
Life will find a way to bring this karma to you
Life will find a way to bring this karma to you

You've lied so much you think it's true
Do you know what the truth is?
How does someone get to be like you?
The king of all excuses?

Everything must come full circle
It kills me that I feel this hurtful
I wonder what your children think of you,
The king of all excuses.
