You the great pretenders, blood to paint your pictures
While youre stepping over fallen people lying in the streets
You the great offenders, only your views matter
While your heart grows colder, I wish that you could open up and feel

For a while see if you can take it
Feel, youre alive and this is all part of it
Feel, could it be that were all afraid
'Cause it feels like a rainy day parade

We the great believers, blood is legal tender
I will not surrender what it was our fathers died to bear
We the people stated, not negotiated
Just to be forgotten, I wish that you could open up and see

For a while see if you can take it
See, youre alive and this is all part of it
See, cant you see that were all afraid
Cause it seems like a rainy day parade

What I see is all too real
What I need is what you steal
And all I reap is what you take
Upon my back on which you break
I just wish that we could rise above and feel

For a while see if you can take it
Feel, youre alive and this is all part of it
Feel could it be that were all afraid
Cause it feels like a rainy day parade
