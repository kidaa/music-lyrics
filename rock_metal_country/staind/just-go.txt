I'm kinda numb 
It's so distorted 
You left me here with this damage that you've caused 
My tortured faces 
I've fucked up places 
In my memories none of them I've lost, but... 

I haven't been here long enough to know 
Everytime I feel this I just lose control 
Such a cancer on the face of everything that's beautiful 
I wish that this would just go, go. 

It's kinda sick 
I feel so dirty 
I'm kinda tragic kinda insecure 
But I know that I'm the only 
One that can fix whatever's wrong I'm sure, but... 

I haven't been here long enough to know 
Everytime I feel this I just lose control 
Such a cancer on the face of everything that's beautiful 
I wish that this would just go, go. 

I feel so alone 
From all I've become 
I'll take you down 
I'll feel so down 
I'm water while you drown 
You're lifted while I'm down 
I'm cancer in your womb 
I'm the needle in your spoon, but... 

I haven't been here long enough to know 
Everytime I feel this I just lose control 
Such a cancer on the face of everything that's beautiful 
I wish that this would just go, go. 

Just 
Just 
Just 
Just go 
Go 
Go 

All these fucking lies [3x]
All your fucking lies [3x]
