Break 

I walk alone 
I am alone 
I think alone 
I'll die alone 
Don't think I can make it on my own 
I think I need someone to SAVE ME! 

Such is life 
So sad but true 
Kill everything 
That's close to you 
Try to decide what not to do 
You know you cannot CONTROL ME! 

I don't see the point in 
Going any further 
Than we've gone already 
Can't keep my hands steady 

Sadness 
Everyday for me 
You can't 
Take that away from me 
All these fuckin thoughts inside my head 
Are almost more than I can take 
You push and pull on me 
Your gonna keep pushin 
Till I break 

You think you control me 
Have no chains to hold me 
Only thing that saves me 
Voices just might kill me 

Sadness 
Everyday for me 
You can't 
Take that away from me 
All these fuckin thoughts inside my head 
Are almost more than I can take 
You push and pull on me 
Your gonna keep pushin 
Till I break
