A piece of glass 
In the sand under your feet 
It cuts you deep 
And makes you hate the beauty 
That you see 
And you wonder where you are 
How you ever got so far 
Now you question what went wrong 
It's your heart 

It's raining again 
There's a dark cloud 
Over your head 
It follows you 'round 
It's bringing you down 
It's raining 
It's raining again 

A wilted rose 
Your decay is all you see 
You buy the flaws 
And miss the beauty 
That is yours for free 
Realize you are so far 
From the things that matter now 
And you only wonder how 
It's your heart 

It's raining again 
There's a dark cloud 
Over your head 
It follows you 'round 
It's bringing you down 
It's raining 
It's raining again 

Come on 
Come on get it right 
Come on 
Come on make it right 
Come on 
Come on it's alright 

It's raining again 
There's a dark cloud 
Over your head 
It follows you 'round 
It's bringing you down 
It's raining 
It's raining again 

It's raining 
Raining again 
There's a dark cloud 
Over your head
