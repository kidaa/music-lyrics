Self Destruct 

Watch me suffer 
You'll feel better 
Stick the needle in my vein 
Lost my feelings with my dealing 
Thoughts of only you remains 

FUCK 

Rip and tear 
In my despair 
agonizing over shit 
Feel the needle burn and tingle 
My bad habits deal with it 

CHORUS: 
FUCK 
I will self destruct 

My light has slowly faded 
Broken and depredated 
Suffocate in my sorrow 
Maybe I'll die tomorrow 
This riot that I've sited 
Can't to you uninvited 
Truth hurts when it's in your face 
Are you afraid of it?
