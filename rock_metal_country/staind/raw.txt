RAW 

The pictures left with me won't fade 
These images affect me every day 
Cause of you I feel I don't deserve 
The life I see in her 

Just don't leave me 
RAW 

Inside I'm so cold 
Inside I'm so cold 

RAW 

I've never been someone who knows 
My choices haunt me everywhere I go 
Finally did something right for myself 
My life to you no one else 

Just don't leave me 
RAW 

Inside I'm so cold 
Inside I'm so cold 

I'm so cold 
I feel so cold 

I CAN'T TAKE THIS 
RAW 
I feel so... 

Inside I'm so cold 
Inside I'm so cold 

RAW 

I feel so:
