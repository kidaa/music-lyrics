You push yourself on me 
Force yourself on me 
Free yourself through me 

You better save yourself from me 
Every time you want me to be 
Something I could never be 
Guess you'll have to wait and see 
Till the next time that you have to 

COME AGAIN! 

I hate myself for you 
I break myself for you 
I'd kill myself for you 
I'd better save myself from you 
Everytime you want me to be 
Something I could never be 
Guess you'll have to wait and see 
Till the next time that you have to 

COME AGAIN! 

If you have to walk my way 
Have somethingto say 
Get the fuck away 
Can't take one more day 
I cannot conform 

COME AGAIN!
