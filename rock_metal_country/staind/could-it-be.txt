well i don't know what to say
because there's truth to what you say
i know it kills you i'm this way
there's something different every day

[chorus]

could it be that i never had the chance to grow inside?
Could it be that my habit is to find a place to hide?
could it be that sometimes i say things just to disagree?
could it be that i'm only being me?

not easy living in my mind
a little peace is hard to find
my every thought is undermined 
by all the history inside

[chorus]

[bridge]

i know i hear the words you said
over and over again
i just can't get them through my head
there's just too many voices
must be like living with the dead
waiting for me to begin
to do the things i have said 
and for this i'm sorry
so there's some truth to what you say

[chorus]
