You in your shell are you waiting for someone to rescue you from yourself.
Don't be disappointed when no one comes.

Don't blame me you didn't get it [3x]

I already told you, that falling is easy it's getting back up that becomes the problem, becomes the problem
If you don't believe that you can find a way out you become the problem, become the problem.

Don't blame me you didn't get it [3x]

You, all alone, are you waiting for someone to make you whole?
Can't you see aren't you tired of this dysfunctional routine.

I already told you, that falling is easy it's getting back up that becomes the problem, becomes the problem
If don't you believe that you can find a way out you you solve the problem, solve the problem.

Falling is easy it's getting back up that becomes the problem, becomes the problem
And if you believe you can find a way out
Then you've solved the problem, you've solved your problem.
