You mother came up to me
She wanted answers only she should know
Only she should know

It wasn't easy to deal
With the tears that rolled down her face
I had no answers 'cause
I didn't even know you

But these words
They can't repace
The life you...
...the life you waste

How could you paint this picture
With life as bad as it should seem
That there were no more options for you
I can't explain how I feel
I've been there many times before
I've tasted the cold steel of my life crashing down before me

But these words
They can't repace
The life you...
...the life you waste

Did Daddy not love you
Or did he love you just too much
Did he control you
Did he live through you at your cost
Did he leave no questions for you to answer on your own

WELL FUCK THEM!
AND FUCK HER!
AND FUCK HIM!
AND FUCK YOU!
For not having
The strenght in your heart
To pull through!
I've had doubts!
I have failed!
I've fucked up!
I've had plans!
Doesn't mean
I should take
My Life
With my own hands

But these words
They can't repace
The life you...
...the life you waste

But these words
The don't replace
The life you...
THE LIFE YOU WASTE
