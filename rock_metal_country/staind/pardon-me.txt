I'm one stop 
From a breakdown 
Two steps from 
Being safe 
Just try to 
See this through 
I'm three steps 
From this nightmare 
And four steps 
From the door 
The rest is 
Up to you 

Pardon me while I 
Just turn my back 
And walk away 
Pardon me if I 
Can't listen 
To the things 
You say 
Pardon me if I 
Can't fake it 
While you still believe 
Pardon me 

I'm one step 
From forgiveness 
And two steps 
From my grave 
We're all just 
Passing through 
Three steps 
From redemption 
Four from the 
Devil's door 
On a path 
That leads to you 

Pardon me while I 
Just turn my back 
And walk away 
Pardon me if I 
Can't listen 
To the things 
You say 
Pardon me if I 
Can't fake this 
While you still believe 
Pardon me 

Pardon me while I 
Just turn my back 
And walk away 
Pardon me if I 
Can't listen 
To the things 
You say 
Pardon me if I 
Can't fake it 
While you still believe 
Pardon me 

I'm two steps 
From salvation 
But i'm only 
Taking one 
Pardon me
