If ever you had said to me before
That I would live this life that I am
Living now I guess it's all so strange
To feel the way I do inisde but
Have so much that I could feel some
pride for in my life so why is it that
I feel like this

How do I feel I've been here before.
I've felt this.
Retreat to a place, a place within.
I need this. Keep it all down, bottled inside
It breaks me to torment again and
torture me like it used to.

I try and try to break away from all the hate
I'm feeling for every one of you that's ever
done me wrong. I need to justify the reasons
for the way I'm living. I guess I can't 'cause
I don't feel like I deserve it

How do I feel I've been here before.
I've felt this.
Retreat to a place, a place within.
I need this. Keep it all down, bottled inside
It breaks me to torment again and
torture me like it used to.

So now the waves they have subsided
And my soul is bleeding I can't take away
the shame I feel. Forgive me.

How do I feel I've been here before.
I've felt this.
Retreat to a place, a place within me.
I need this. Keep it all down, bottled inside
It breaks me to torment again and
torture me like it used to.

AGAIN!
