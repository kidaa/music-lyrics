Talk to me
You never
Talk to me
Do we suffer
From
Social atrophy
And when the conversation's over
When the conversation's over

We've taken what's been given
And we throw it all away

Walk with me
Come on and
Walk with me
Take a look
Around you
Do you like
What you see

We've taken what's been given
And we throw it all away
It's hard to be forgiven
When there's nothing left to say

When the conversation's over
The silence just gets in the way
Conversation's over

Talk to me
Don't ever
Talk for me

We've taken what's been given
And you throw it all away
It's hard to be forgiven
When there's nothing left to say

There's nothing left to say
