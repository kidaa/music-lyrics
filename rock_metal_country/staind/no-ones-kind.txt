No One's Kind 

What the fuck's the purpose 
I didn't scratch the surface 
Immune to what your saying 
All along decaying 
Can't see thru the fire 
Darkness lone desire 
Quiet in my corner 
Building up the border 

Can't stand the way you make me feel today 
No One's kind is all you'll ever be 

Can't see thru the rain 
Too much time 
No sublime 
loss of energy 
No symmentry 
Fuck society 
Lost in nievate 

Can't stand they way you break me... 
Can't take the pain you break me.... 
Can't bite the hand that feeds me... 
Can't take away what's in me 

Addicted to the feelings 
Lose touch with all I've know 
The cobwebs on the ceiling 
Make me aware that I'm all alone 

The endless rain washes all away 
Makes clean the mess I have made
