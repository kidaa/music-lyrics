I light another cigarette 
Stop to think about it 
Come to no conclusions 
Take each step as it comes 
Hold no prisioners except myself 
Painful thoughts denied 

Try to explain 
My loss of words 
Fuck you I piss upon you all 

My head is a barricade 
Filled with peaceful thoughts 
With evil outcomes 
No one understands 
Try to break the barrier 
I see no outlet 
No ones there to catch me when I fall 

Try to explain 
My loss of words 
Fuck you I piss upon you all
