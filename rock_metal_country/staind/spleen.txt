Can't breathe! 
Shut up [2x]

I feel I give everything to you 

Can't breathe! 
Shut up [2x]

I think there's nothing left to do 

Can't breathe! 
Shut up [2x]

I don't like today, take it all away 
Just like what you say - I don't want you 

Kinda like the way, everything is gray 
Just like what you say - I don't need you 

I don't look like you, do the things you do 
But I'm fucked up too - I don't need you 

Can't breathe! 
Shut up [2x]

I feel you are what's changed my soul 

Can't breathe! 
Shut up [2x]

I think I'll never lose control 

Can't breathe! 
Shut up [2x]

I don't like today, take it all away 
Just like what you say - I don't want you 

Kinda like the way, everything is gray 
Just like what you say - I don't need you 

I don't look like you, do the things you do 
But I'm fucked up too - I don't need you 

I don't understand it 
You're killing this planet 
The scabs on your face 
It's a fucking disgrace 
I blame you [2x]

I blame you [5x]

Can't breathe! 
Shut up [2x]

I'm don't like today, take it all away shut up 
Just like what you say - I don't want you shut up 

Kinda like the way, everything is gray shut up 
Just like what you say - I don't need you shut up 

I don't look like you, do the things you do shut up 
But I'm fucked up too - I don't need you shut up
