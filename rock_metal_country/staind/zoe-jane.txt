Well I want you to notice
To notice when I'm not around
And I know that your eyes see straight through me
And speak to me without a sound

[Chorus:]
I want to hold you
Protect you from all of the things I've already endured
I want to show you
Show you all the things that this life has in store for you
I'll always love you
The way that a father should love his daughter

When I walked out this morning
I cried as I walked to the door
I cried about how long I'd be away for
I cried about leaving you all alone

[Chorus]

Sweet Zoe Jane [x2]

So I wanted to say this
Cuz I wouldn't know where to begin
To explain to you what I have been through
To explain where your daddy has been

[Chorus]

Sweet Zoe Jane [x2]
