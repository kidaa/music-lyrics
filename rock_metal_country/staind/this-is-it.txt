Here we are
Theres nowhere else to go
And thats so far
From where we all could be
But you can't feel my disappearing
And you should take this for what it's worth

This is it
And it fits
And it feels like this is good enough for me
Could it be
That the grass is always green?

There you are
You dream of something better
What's so wrong
With what you thought was true and
All the colors are disappearing
But you should take this for what it's worth

This is it
And it fits
And it feels like this is good enough for me
Could it be
That the grass is always green?

This is it this is it
This is it this is it

If you feel like disappearing
You should take this for what it's worth

This is it
And it fits
And it feels like this is good enough for me
Could it be
That the grass is always green?

This is it
This is it
