Are you afraid, afraid of the truth
In the mirror staring back at you.
The image is cracked but so is the view, here.
And the strength of a tree begins in the roots
That I tend bury into you
At least now the storm can't blow me away.

So crawl inside my head with me.
I'll show you how it feels to be,
To blame like me.

Should I be afraid of this face that I see
In the mirror staring back at me?
So cold were the days when I listened to you.
And you say that I'm weak so show me the proof
Because I still exist in spite of you
But I won't compete with you every day.

So crawl inside my head with me.
I'll show you how it feels to be,
To blame like me.

Schizophrenic conversations that
I'm always having with myself.
I hear these voices in my head competing.
Maybe I could use a little help
I still have schizophrenic conversations
Where there's no one else around to hear.
I long for solitude and peace within me
Void of all the anger and the fear.

So crawl inside my head with me.
I'll show you how it feels to be,
Fucked up like me.

I'll show you how it feels to be
To blame like me
Ashamed like me
