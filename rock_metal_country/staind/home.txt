I force myself through another day 
Can't explain the way today just fell apart like everything 
Right in my face 
And I try to be the one 
I can't accept this all because of you 
I've had to walk away 
From everything 

I'm afraid to be alone 
Afraid you'll leave me when I'm gone 
I'm afraid to come back home 

Another sleepless night again 
Hotel rooms my only friend 
And friends like that just don't add up 
To anything 
And I try so hard to be everything 
That I should never take away from you again 
'Cause I heard ya say 

I'm afraid to be alone 
Afraid you'll leave me when I'm gone 
I'm afraid to come back home 

I cannot forget 
I live with regret 
I cannot forget 
I live with... 

I'll live through this 
I can't see through this 
I can't do this anymore 

I'm afraid to be alone 
Afraid you'll leave me when I'm gone 
I'm afraid to come back home 

Afraid you'll leave me when I'm gone 
I just wish I was back home 
Home
