We change the rhyme 
Forget the reason 
Waiting for the 
Change of season 
Drawing near 
It's almost here 
So save tonight 
Forget tomorrow 
Say goodbye 
To time we borrowed 
It's always there 
It's in the air 

Like voices in the rain 
Like a song without a name 
Like angel's wings 
And whisperings 
Of love we lost 
And found along the way 

Do you take the time 
To really wollow 
In the footsteps 
That you follow 
Gets you where 
Gets you anywhere 
So here today 
And gone tomorrow 
With the time you 
Had to borrow 
It's always there 
It's in the air 

Like voices in the rain 
Like a song without a name 
Like angel's wings 
And whisperings 
Of love we lost 
And found along the way 

Like voices in the rain 
Like a song without a name 
Like angel's wings 
And whisperings 
Of time we lost 
And found out in the rain 
Like a song without a name 
Like angel's wings 
And whisperings 
Of love we lost 
Of love we lost 
And found along 
The way 

We found along the way
