Tolerate 

I Don't give a fuck 
About all of your problems 
I could give a rats ass 
how your feeling today 
take your wordly advice 
and shove it straight up your ass 
Thanks for coming around 
to fuck up my day 

I try 
TOLERATE 
Good-bye 
Take me... 4x 

Look at you I can't 
You don't see the whole picture 
take my bed of dirt 
cold and empty I'll stay 
what's the point of trying 
To stay above the surface 
Take my life from me 
Help me to ease my pain 

I try 
TOLERATE 
Good-bye 
Take me... 

Try to see the way around you 
I can't find it 
Try to take the path behind me 
Can't rewind it 
Stick your finger in my face and 
I will break it 
Leave me with an after taste 

I try 
TOLERATE 
Good-bye 
Take me... 4x
