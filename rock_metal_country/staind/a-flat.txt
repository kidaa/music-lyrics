Trust In me can't trust 
I know, I don't believe it 
All my life so scarred 
what for, you can't conceive it 
Everything you fear 
I'll be, you couldn't live it 
I whisper in your ear 
so loud, why can't you hear it 

I'm OK 

All my faith is gone 
you think I couldn't find it 
Pieces falling down 
shattered, nothing behind it 
In my mind alone, 
Lost here I'm separated 
Crawl deeper in my hole 
safe here from what I hated 

All the demons in my head won't leave me 
I know I can hear them 
All the sacrifices made for nothing 
Don't show can't believe it 
Want to show that I'm good for something 
I can't you won't let me 
All your artificial words won't heal me 
Because you can't accept me 

And I hate myself 
And I hate my face 
And I hate my world 
And I hate my ways 

And I 
And I 
And I 

I'M NOT OK! 

I'm OK 

Trust In me can't trust 
Iknow, I don't believe in 
All my life so scarred 
what for,you can't conceive it 
Everything you fear 
I'll be, you couldn't live it 
I whisper in your ear 
why can't you feel it 

All the demons in my head won't leave me 
I know I can hear them 
All the sacrifices made for nothing 
Don't show can't believe in 
Want to show that I'm good for something 
I can't you won't let me 
All your artificial words won't heal me 
Because you can't accept me 

I don't believe it [2x]
