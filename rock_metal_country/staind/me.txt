I hear you talk about your family life 
I wish I knew just what that means 
I guess my mother never loved my dad 
And now I wear it on my sleeve 

My sister called me just the other day 
It felt so good to hear her voice 
My problem is I don't have much to say 
I guess she doesn't have a choice, and I'm sorry 

Look at me I'm so pathetic 
I can't believe I'm just an addict 
I've never needed anyone to help me 
I'm begging you to please come save me from myself, save me from my... 

My mothers always tried to change herself 
She never learned to let things be 
She doesn't know how bad she messed me up 
'Cause now she seems so fake to me but I love her 

Look at me I'm so pathetic 
I can't believe I'm just an addict 
I've never needed anyone to help me 
I'm begging you to please come save me from myself, save me from myself 

If you push me then I won't fall 
I've been programmed to take it all 
And shove it way down inside 

Like my father [2x]

I'm so pathetic 
I can't believe I'm just an addict 
I've never needed anyone to help me I'm failing it 
I'm begging you to please come save me from myself 

I hear you talk about your family life 
I wish I knew just what that means
