Question 

Which way do I go? 

Pain I swallow I cannot keep it down 
Hate I swallow I cannot keep it down 

Down 

You I hate you I cannot keep you down 
You I'll rape you I cannot keep it down 

Down 

You before me 
I can't take any more 
Of what you have to offer 
My ears are sore 
Leave my feelings 
In a heap by the door 
Can't go up any further 
Come crashing back down
