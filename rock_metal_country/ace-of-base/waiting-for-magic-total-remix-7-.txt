Kiss me baby, I am snow white
Sleeping in a coffin, waiting for you
Waiting for magic baby, I am snow white
Sleeping in a coffin, waiting for you
Waiting for magic

A man of the world, but lost in a dream
You look at something from a different angle
But I exist waiting for you, in a coffin made of glass

Kiss me baby, I'm attractive baby
Get to know me, show who you are
Give me that magic baby
I'm eternal, lying in a coffin waiting for you
Waiting for magic

In your dream a girl is dancing close to you
That girl is me
Once a witch made her sleep and a prince will wake her up
It's you

Kiss me baby, I'm attractive baby
Get to know me, show who you are
Give me that magic baby
I'm eternal, lying in a coffin waiting for you
Waiting for magic
Waiting for magic
