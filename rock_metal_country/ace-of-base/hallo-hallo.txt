Hallo hallo...

Coming from my work
I'm tired
I see you get on my bus
Here I go again, a new attraction
And I think I know you
Something is familiar about your face
I move through the crowd
So I can get a better look

Hallo hallo
I've got what you're searching for
Hallo hallo
Can't you see me
Hallo hallo
Everybody's looking for a crazy heart
Can't you see me
I'm here beside you

Weren't you the one that spilled
my long drink over at a bar ?
Easy come, easy go
I said and laughed
Looking like a question mark you stood
There wondering what to do
Then I said to you
Don't you look too happy now

Hallo hallo
I've got what you're searching for
Hallo hallo
Can't you see me
Hallo hallo
Everybody's looking for a crazy heart
Can't you see me
I'm here ...

Hallo hallo
Here I'm standing next to you
Hallo hallo
I'm a objekt - nothing new
Hallo hallo
Talk to me you're looking strange
Let me know if my presence is bothering you

Hallo hallo
Everybody's looking -
Can't you see me ?

Hallo hallo
Everybody searching
Can't you see me ?
