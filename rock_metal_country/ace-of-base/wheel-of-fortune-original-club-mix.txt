We're gonna make you move
We're gonna make you move

My dad was the devil
I want to celebrate
I found a life from
Each citizen's city life

What you gonna tell your dad
It's like a wheel of fortune
What you gonna tell your dad
What you gonna tell your dad

Hey you, we're gonna make you move

My dad was the devil
I want to celebrate
I found a life from
Each citizen's city life

What you gonna tell your dad
It's like a wheel of fortune

What you gonna tell your dad
What you gonna tell your dad
Hey you, we're gonna make you move
Tastes like steel like a stab from a knife

What you gonna tell your dad
It's like a wheel of fortune
What you gonna tell your dad

Everybody let me seek the town

What you gonna tell your dad
Everybody let me seek the town
What you gonna tell your dad

You must understand
What you gonna tell your dad
