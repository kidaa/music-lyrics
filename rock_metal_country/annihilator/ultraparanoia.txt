I'm on the run and I'm moving fast
I got to get away, away from the past
it's getting closer, and I can feel a chill
there's no time to waste, there's no time to kill
gotta run
it's Ultraparanoia
darkness surrounds, I can feel the eyes
burning to chase their human prize
I got to cover the tracks, I gotta cover 'em well
cause if they catch me, I'm going straight to hell
