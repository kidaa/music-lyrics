I like to feast on thoughts of anger
I like to prey on evil minds
and I like to rip the very fabric
that keeps them all intertwined
I'm full of lies, just hold me as you die
I wrench this vice, my human sacrifice
you beg and I feed, your blood is all I need
rapture, ecstasy, it's time to bleed for me
I love the dark and screaming madness
no one can see through my disguise
the sewer rats are just a snack
but I'm here to crush your petty lives
I'm full of lies, just hold me as you die
I wrench this vice, my human sacrifice
you beg and I feed, your blood is all I need
rapture, ecstasy, it's time to bleed for me
I am a never-ending nightmare
and I dream of swallowing the sun
my eyes burn to embrace you
nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
I'm full of lies, just hold me as you die
I wrench this vice, my human sacrifice
you beg and I feed, your blood is all I need
