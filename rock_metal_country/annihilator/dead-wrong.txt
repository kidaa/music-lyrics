Wrongly or falsely condemned for something that one never did
Tar me, feather me and push me around, punish me and correct me,
Kick me when I'm down crucify me and stone me, hang me out to die
Well light the fire and burn me, all because of a lie
All these years you have taken away, you don't wanna listen,
Don't care what I say, you're making a mistake
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, I'm tired of doing the time
I shall return, then you will learn, vengeance will be mine
Try me, judge me and put me to your test, use me and abuse me,
Come on and do your best, gas me, shoot me, destroy me if you can
Slice me up and dice me, then bury me in the sand
All these years you have taken away, you don't wanna listen,
Don't care what I say, you're making a big mistake
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, I'm tired of doing the your time
I shall return, then you will learn, vengeance will be mine
Connect me, fry me, electricity, well off with the head
Then hold it up for all to see, boil me and screw me,
Stretch me open wide, injecting the poison, cook me from inside
All these years you have taken away, you don't wanna listen,
Don't care what I say, you're making a very big mistake
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, I'm tired of doing the your time
I shall return, then you will learn, Vengeance will be mine
