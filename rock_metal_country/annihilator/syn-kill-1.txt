I kill for god, and I kill for power
for propaganda, the news hour
you know my cause so don't turn your
back you see my anger, fear my attack
assassinate kidnap and murder, I will terrify
the death of an innocent, I will justify
target you are now in my sight
you'll never know what hit you, you're blown by dynamite
I'm gonna overthrow you, burn to the ground
hijack or with a bomb, I'm gonna shoot you down
arson, ransom, I got a gun to your head
you do what I want or bang bang you're dead
I kill for god and I kill for power
for propaganda, the news hour
you know my cause so don't turn your back
you see my anger, you better fear my attack
