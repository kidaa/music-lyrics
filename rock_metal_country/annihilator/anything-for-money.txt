I'd sell my mother and I'd steal from the blind
just to have every last nickel and dime
break-ins and muggings, I'll try to defraud
I'll run up the bill on your credit card
anything for money
I'll sell a secret and betray the land
robbing a friend, isn't larceny grand
buying and selling, the running of guns
I run from the law but embezzle their funds
anything for money
anything for money
hundreds of thousands without a concern
millions and billions there's money to burn and I want it all
I'll try to sue you and take you to court
and if I have to blackmail and extort
taking the money to fund my research
swindling millions by using the church
anything for money
anything for money
hundreds of thousands without a concern
millions and billions there's money to burn and I want it all
