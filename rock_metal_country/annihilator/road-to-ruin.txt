"I guess you could call this Annihilator's version of 'Detroit Rock City' meets 'Highway Star' meets drinking and driving!

No control tonight, the lights are going dim
The floor begins to tilt, it's blurring to a spin
Just let me find my keys, 'look down below'
Fresh air is all I need, then I'll go
Leading up the road to ruin
You're full of alcoholic speed

No last chance, don't bother to plead
High, over the limit, got to take it slow
Concentrate, kill the radio
It's not the first time, it'll be the last

Leading up the road to ruin
You're full of alcoholic speed
Leading up the road to ruin
No last chance, don't bother to plead

Just down the block, there's nothing left to fear
Carefree, on top of the world, feeling power
Impaired security at ninety miles an hour
Leading up the road to ruin
You're full of alcoholic speed
Leading up the road to ruin
No last chance, don't bother to plead
Out
