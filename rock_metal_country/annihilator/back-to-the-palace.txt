My brain's on fire, my brain's on drugs, call up the guard
And fill my cup, I feel so lost, I'm so alone, here in my room
Come fill me up, the door is locked, you can't get out
Said the voice of malice
Here I am, trapped inside, under glass, the fun palace
Creepy crawlers, sidewalk maulers, have you met our little alice
Cobweb corners, pre-paid mourners, won't you come back to the palace
When I look through the glass, I see them dancing in the dark
There's one now, oh can't you see the eyes of fire
Watch out for sparks
What in hell is it they want and can they get behind my wall
Can you hear, hear it creep, coming closer, hear it call
Creepy crawlers, sidewalk maulers, have you met our little alice
Cobweb corners, pre-paid mourners, welcome back to the palace
I'm out the door and I'm heading for the wall
Deep into the night, please god, don't let me fall
I hear the bark of the dogs, gotta make my choices
Search lights getting brighter
Please don't let them take my voices away
The pictures of, deep in my mind, the memories that can kill
I lick the wounds, they can't be cleansed because they
Won't, won't hold still and I scream in agony
I feel the flesh tearing off me, oh help me please
It's hide and seek, this secret's found in therapy
Creepy crawlers, sidewalk maulers, have you met our little alice
Cobweb corners, pre-paid mourners, you are now back in the palace
