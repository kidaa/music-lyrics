Hiding in the darkness, sheltered from the rain
My mom and dad are gone now, I'm alone again
Is anybody out there? does anybody care?
I don't wanna live here anymore
I don't wanna live
See the people suffering watch the children die
Doesn't it make you wonder why?
Money and power, the television's red
One by one, they collect the dead
Hell is a war - hell, what is it for?
They'll slay the innocent and every mother's son
To get the ethnic cleansing done
Hey Mr. Politician, what are you gonna do?
This nightmare is up to you
Hell is a war - hell, what is it for?
Hell is a war - hell, what is it for?
Stopping for nothing, I fire at will
In the name of my religion I shoot to kill, to kill Kill to kill
See the people suffering watch the children die
Doesn't it make you wonder why?
Money and power, the television's red
One by one, they collect the dead
Hiding in the darkness, sheltered from the rain
My mom and dad are gone now, I'm alone again
Is anybody out there? does anybody care?
But I don't wanna live here anymore
I don't wanna live
Hell is the war, what is it for?
