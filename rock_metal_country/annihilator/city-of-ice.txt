I'm getting sick of everything I see
and I hate what's happening to me
this place is cold, it's turning me to stone
these streets won't leave me be
garbage, murder, misery, so this is ecstasy
it's all a bunch of lies
you try to take me and rape me of my dreams
they're melting right before my eyes, city of ice
I'm feeling anger and I'm feeling rage
just like a puppet on a stage
I hear the shots can't you hear the screams
death is all around, this ain't no dream
garbage, murder, misery, so this is ecstasy
it's all a bunch of lies
you try to take me and rape me of my dreams
they're melting right before my eyes, city of ice
I'm freezing up inside, there's nothing left to heal
this can't be happening, this can't be real
a living nightmare, what is it for
cause I can't take it, I can't take it anymore, no
I'm getting tired of all this pain
I'm surprised I'm not insane
it's never over until the end
but I know I'll never be the same
garbage, murder, poverty / so this is ecstasy?
it's all a bunch of lies
you try to take me and rape me of my dreams
