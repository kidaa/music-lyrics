The edge, I'm walking a fine line
To young to be waiting at stop signs
I'm on fire and I can't cool down
And I'm ready to roll right out of this town
'Cause there's something in me you can't learn in school
They teach it on the street, it's the only rule
It's the edge
The edge, I'm dying in the classroom
Tell me why should I dance to your tune
Keep your plans for my security
Because there's only one thing taking care of me
And it's harder than steel, it cuts like a knife
It's the way I run, it's a way of life
The edge
You can't hold me down forever
What doesn't kill me makes me strong
If you can't take it, you can't make it
Out here on the edge for very long
And it's harder than steel, it cuts like a knife
It's the way I run, it's a way of life
The edge
