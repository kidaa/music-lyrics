You take time to cut me down
You're a fool, you're the talk of the town
So jealous, can't you see
It's your own insecurity
Your life is a mess
Slightly obsessed
Are you a paranoid schizo?
What a fiasco
Looking for scandal, you're under the gun
'Cause I'm havin' so much fun
They say you're missing a screw
This laugh is just for you, ha!
Your life is a mess
Slightly obsessed
Are you a paranoid schizo?
What a fiasco
Eat my dust boy, I said boy
I don't hold any drudges
I'm such a nice guy
Forgive and forget or better yet
Goodbye
