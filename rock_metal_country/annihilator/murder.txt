I am a disease or virus that has fatal consequences
Six feet under
No longer alive
This is your destiny
Cause I have arrived
I am not a nightmare
I am disease
And I'll bring society
To its' knees
Murder the world
I was born to murder the world
The fools and the innocent
They're all the same
To me, I thrive on
Pleasure and pain
It's not a war of attrition
I never lose the games
Feel the grand invasion
Feasting in the veins
I was born to murder the world
Your strength devoured
Just wither away
'til the final hour
The battle is won
March to the beat
I am the plague, invincible
That you can't defeat
