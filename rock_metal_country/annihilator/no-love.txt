No love anymore
You nail yourself like jesus,
Posing on a cross
You're waiting to get off
I seen you in the movies,
I've passed you on the street
I saw you walk on water
Or was that make-believe
There is no love anymore
I am hanging helpless here,
In front of you
A broken toy, a puppet
That no one wants to use
I try to wake you slowly,
You push me to the ground
I try to take you slowly,
Loathe the final round
There is no love anymore
I throw myself at the sky,
And fall back to the ground
I throw myself off the earth
And you don't hear a sound
Trapped in rage, but you won't listen
Bursting veins, but you won't listen
