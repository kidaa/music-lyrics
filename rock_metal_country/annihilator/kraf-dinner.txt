"A popular North American delicacy, this macaroni and cheese dinner is probable the heavy metal musician's best friend! By 'living' off this stuff, I saved enough money to pay the rent on a rehearsal space and buy cigarettes each day! Boy, what a happy teenager I was!! 'Kraf dinner is full of love and butter!!!'"
Cupboard's bare, I'm so hungry
Life ain't fair, give me some money
Macaroni maniac, a cheddar cheese heart attack
I love, I love, I love, I love
Kraf Dinner
Boiling water, I can't wait
It's getting hotter, it feels so great
Macaroni maniac, a cheddar cheese heart attack
I love, I love, I love, I love
Kraf Dinner
Well that was fun, but now that I'm all done
Now sedate, I think I'll buy a crate
Macaroni maniac, a cheddar cheese heart attack
I love, I love, I love, I love
Kraf dinner
Kraf dinner
Dinner
Kraf dinner
My dinner
I want it now
