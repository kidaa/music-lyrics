"Although a cliche subject in metal, fear of annihilation is something we've all experienced at one time or another. In this case, we try to decipher, lyrically and musically, a set of reoccurring nightmares I used to frequently have."
Centuries of war and waste
Have dealt a mortal blow
Mother earth begins to rot
Humanity on death row
Life does slowly cease to be
Death seems so surreal
As earth becomes a vacant lot
There's nothing left to heal
No colour in the skies
No one left to blame
And we thought we were wise
As I fade, I feel revived
Shocked back into life
Opening imperilled eyes
Imperilled eyes
Cessation of physical life
Blackness rains from above
What right did power have
To annihilate the earth I loved
Now a barren wasteland
The die is cast
A planet that once did teem with life
No evidence of a past
No colour in the skies
No one left to blame
And we thought we were wise
As I fade, I feel revived
Shocked back into life
Opening imperilled eyes
Imperilled eyes
Centuries of war and waste
Have dealt a mortal blow
Mother earth is now no more
There's nothing left to heal
No colour in the skies
No one left to blame
And we thought we were wise
As I fade, I feel revived
Shocked back into life
Opening imperilled eyes
Imperilled eyes
