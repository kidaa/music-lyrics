The storm is coming closer,
Spreading out,
Infecting like disease Like a disease
All life below,
Is crushed under the power of machine
Annihilator this machine annihilator
Annihilator this machine annihilator
Rumble
Lighting rips the sky at night,
His power paints the city blood red
Blood red
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide,
Don't look behind cause you're dead
Annihilator you're dead annihilator
Annihilator now you're dead annihilator
You're trapped alone
Filled with fear
There's no one to help you
The storm is coming closer,
Spreading out,
Infecting like disease Like a disease
All life below,
Is crushed under the power of machine
Annihilator this machine annihilator
Annihilator this machine annihilator
Rumble
