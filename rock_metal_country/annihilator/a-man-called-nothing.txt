I'm scratching a picture on the wall
of a man called nothing at all
why are they keeping me here
please just let me go
please let me go
I'm hearing voices deep inside my head
but I don't want to listen
why don't you leave me, just leave me alone
cause I'm in no condition
Join us - I won't follow you
Join us - there's nothing you can do
Join us - you're never going to win
Join us - cause I'll never let you in
what are these creatures crawling over me?
I'm in no condition
Join us - I won't follow you
Join us - there's nothing you can do
Join us - you're never going to win
Join us - cause I'll never let you in
I claw at the walls until my fingers bleed
is it really happening or is it just a dream
I look in the mirror
his eyes stare right back
he is always watching
this room turns to black
we are the voices deep inside you're head
