"The realisation of fantasy beyond what is pleasurable. Seizure of both mind and soul as lust and passion overcome their bodies in rhythmic waves of sexual delight. Gushing energies generate intense erotic sensations, fulfilling every imaginable yearning. The ultimate gratification of physical love."
Excess perversion, and we'll never let it end
You and I are making a private legend
We've got the hunger, got the thirst
You want it slow, our bodies glow, nails rake my back
Tongue licks sweet parade
Animal lust and it burns like a buzzsaw blade
Dripping wet, we laugh at this charade
Screams of love in the air tonight and it burns like a buzzsaw blade
Gratification, do you want some more
On the bed, entangled on the floor
Feel my eyes burn, we writhe until the dawn
Tease and please, humility is gone
Tongue licks sweet parade
Animal lust and it burns like a buzzsaw blade
Dripping wet, we laugh at this charade
Screams of love in the air tonight and it burns like a buzzsaw blade
Come on
What are you waiting for...
Excess perversion, and we'll never let it end
You and I are making a private legend
Feel my eyes burn, feel everything
On my knees, but I reign as your king
Tongue licks sweet parade
Animal lust and it burns like a buzzsaw blade
Dripping wet, we laugh at this charade
Screams of love in the air tonight and it burns like a buzzsaw blade
