I cannot lose control, they'll drag me down, down the hole
must win the battle, I must win the war,
just buy our product and you'll want more
we say refresh, refresh the demon
subliminal, yet direct, another billion, to collect
another flavor to satisfy, they forgot to tell you, it's all a lie
let's raise a glass to the young, models and athletes they'll become
so sip the poison, sip the wine, suck your life out, you're doing fine
we say refresh, refresh the demon
temptation, frustration, it ain't easy to beat
condition, addiction I shall defeat
back against the wall, I'm through
there is only one thing left to do
that is to fight the demon
I cannot lose control, they'll drag me down, down the hole
must win the battle, I must win the war,
"just buy our product and you'll want more"
we say refresh, refresh the demon
