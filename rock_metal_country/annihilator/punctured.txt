Forgive me nothing, I meant it all
And I was, laughing the closer you crawled
You're coming closer, the warmth of your skin
I'm taking my time, wanna watch it begin
To puncture the skin, to puncture your soul
To puncture the dream because reality's cold
I'll blacken the night and black out the sun
We'll blacken the world and then we'll see what's begun
Punctured
I told you that I was lying again and you believed it
You believed you could win
And you believed it you believed you could win
Well I punctured the skin, I punctured the soul
I punctured the dream because I'm in control
I'll blacken the night, I'll blacken the sun
We'll blacken the world
And then we'll see what's begun
I'll take my time and break your mind
Your forehead pressed into the ground
I'll watch you kneel, I'll hear you squeal
You're lost and never found
I punctured the skin, I punctured the soul
I punctured the dream because I'm out of control
I'll blacken the night and black out the sun
I'll blacken the world and then we'll see what's begun
