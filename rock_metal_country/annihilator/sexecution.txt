To risk your life for pleasure
I've heard a lot about you
And I've heard all about your disease
Well they asy you're an animal
With a rabid desire to please
I'm on the hunt, you're on the prowl
Do you wanna to do this time
Come on, we got nothing to lose
Let's commit the crime
I want your flesh
Sexecution
So the feeling is mutual
The hunger's gonna turn into a feast
Got to cool the fire, control desire
It's time to unleash the beast
I wanna sex you up, sex you down
I wanna do it all over and all around
Russian roulette at a hundred degrees
I don't wanna die
But you sure can please
I want your flesh
Sexecution
Now that it's over
The temperature falls
Reality begins to rise
What have I done, under the gun
Never should've rolled the dice
How do you feel, miss sex appeal
Have you played this game before
A nail in the coffin, a bullet to the head
Take the chance and wind up dead
I want your flesh
