so precious and new, I see the innocent little eyes
I'll always be there, I'll always be there to hear your cries
the way you've changed my life
from the very first day you were born
you give me the answer to what it's all for
I worry for you as I look into the future
all the things that you've shown me, it's almost as if you
were a messenger
the way you've changed my life
from the very first day you were born
you give me the answer to what it's all for
want to hold you, so come, in my arms
want to feel you and keep you from harm
I knew from the start that you could steal my heart
