Is this what you wanted, what you killed yourself to be
And this is where you are now, what you didn't want to see
Crawling from the rubble of the lives you pushed aside
You didn't take the trouble to have them crucified
It's wanting, it's needing
It's strength is fuckin breathing
Good god there's nothing I can do
It's time to start feeding, can even taste the bleeding
Good god there's nothing left to do
Never close my eyes except to fall asleep
Stumbling through lies piled six feet deep
Steal a ticket and get on the ride again
You never will give up and you will never give in
Never close my eyes except to fall asleep
Stumbling through lies piled six feet deep
Faster and faster, the carousel drives
Slicing to the bone, like razor sharp knives
