Across the room, see your eyes watching me, charming lies
Watch you squirm, see the need, it's time to go, time to leave
I dare you to come any closer, I dare you to cross this line
And I dare you to be different, and I dare you to try
I dare you to get any closer, I dare you to break this line
And I dare you to be different, I double dare you to try
In my room, all alone, far from help, close to home
Lying there, kill the light
In the dark, realize
I dare you to come any closer, I dare you to cross this line
And I dare you to be different, I double dare you to try
No one can see you, no one will know
I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna blow
Come join the madness, come join the fool
Enter my dungeon, slip in the pool
What is it like to be usual and how does it feel to be the only one
I try to pick the pieces up from my life
But no one will ever take them away
No one can take them away
No one will ever take them away, no one
Burning skin, flesh is hot
Slowly fades, who was caught
Double dare, will you come, will I stay, are you the one
I dare you to come closer, I dare you to cross this line
And I dare you to be different, I dare you to try
I dare you to get closer, I dare you to cross this line
And I dare you to be different, I double dare you to try
I dare you to get closer, I dare you to cross my line
I dare you to be different, come on and give it a try
I double dare you to try
