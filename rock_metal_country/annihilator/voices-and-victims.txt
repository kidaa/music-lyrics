my door's locked from the inside, I can't take anymore
I'm safe from the outside, the other side of the door
alone in the darkness, alone in my space
no one can reach me, no one to get on my case
cause I'm getting sick of the outside
trying to get deep into me
there's too many voices and victims around me
I've been sitting for hours, but they won't leave me alone
and everything that I see turns me to stone
I'm alone in the darkness, and I think I'll stay
cause this is the solitude I crave
cause I'm getting sick of the outside
trying to get deep into me
there's too many voices and victims around me
