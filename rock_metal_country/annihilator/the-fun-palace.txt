"Carrying on Annihilator's fine tradition of covering weird, psychological illnesses 'Palace' is narrated by the emotion of guilt. It details the psychic voyage taken by one who has committed a heinous crime and gotten away with it. Many years later the nightmares become so intense that the only way for the murderer to stop them is to confess"
Welcome, I invite you off to the other world
You'll have to face this house of no escape
Confront the past, in this psychic house of horrors
I lead you up the path you'll take
Panic, your conscience lied
Trapped inside
Panic, your ultimate nightmare
Welcome to the fun palace
Panic, just try to scream
It's only a dream
Panic, your ultimate nightmare
Welcome to the palace
Tonight you'll be tried, I invoke the memories
The guilt to be driven from this unconscious mind
Young lives that you've denied, behold their faces
Innocence cut to pieces, just look behind
Panic, your conscience lied
Trapped inside
Panic, your ultimate nightmare
Welcome to the fun palace
Panic, just try to scream
It's only a dream
Panic, your ultimate nightmare
Welcome to the palace
Look at the fun and the games that you've taken away
Confess!
Dreams of growing up have been destroyed
Because of you!
Farewell, I impel you back to your other world
You'll have to face your every sin
Take this a painful bounty, representing me
The keeper of the palace and the secrets held within
Panic, your conscience lied
Trapped inside
Panic, your ultimate nightmare
Welcome to the fun palace
Panic, just try to scream
It's only a dream
Panic, your ultimate nightmare
Welcome to the palace
Goodbye, from the fun palace
