My father tried to tell me 'Son, just get your feet on the ground
You're in deep way over your head just turn your life around'
Poor mother, all I gave to her was pain - I didn't realize
The last thing I remember was the tears running from her eyes
Somethin' happened along the way - I was a bad child
Somethin' happened they'd always say - I was a bad child
Four, three, two, one!
No! Yeah!
Playin' hockey, drinkin' octane, I didn't care anymore - no
Always runnin' against the grain, I was rotten to the core
I could live forever - until they threw me out the door
I was a sleeping on the floor. Oh!
Somethin' happened along the way - I was a bad child bad child
Somethin' happened they'd always say - I was a little wild
I was a bad child, yeah. Go!
My father tried to tell me 'Son, just get your feet on the ground
You're in deep way over your head', I've turned my life around
My mother was the best to me, I guess I never realized
One thing that I'll never forget was the tears running from her eyes
Somethin' happened along the way - I was a bad child bad child
Somethin' happened they'd always say - I was a little wild
Somethin' happened along the way now I'm livin' to a better day
Somethin' happened along the way - I was a bad child
