The high and mighty often get what they deserve
I'm on top of the world and I will never fall
I can and will deceive you and trick you all,
Manipulation, well I ruin just for fun
There's no time for hesitation, it's time, time to get the job done
Well I get just what I want, because I rule the land, I am invincible,
You better understand
Magic man, magic man, you can't stop the magic man
Magic man, magic man, you will never catch the magic man,
Magic man
I steal from innocent by throwing dust in their eyes
So many stupid people, eating up my lies
Well I get just what I want because I rule the land, I am invincible,
You better understand
Magic man, magic man, you can't stop the magic man
Magic man, magic man, you will never catch the magic man,
Magic man
The walls of the castle come a crumbling down,
Well I thought you were the king of the world
Just a selfish, sickening maniac, so ong, say good-bye to the world,
You're gonna get what you deserve
Well I get just what I want because I rule the land, I am invincible,
You better understand
Magic man, magic man, you can't stop the magic man
Magic man, magic man, you will never catch the magic man,
Magic man
