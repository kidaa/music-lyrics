Simply put, a good walk can relieve a lot of stress and help one to see things a little clearer
I'm walking  in the darkness, I'm trying to un-wind
Just the kind of peace, I need to soothe my mind
I'm tired of all the noise, tired of alll the pain
Escape in the night, just to face another day
I'm talking to the wind
I can feel the calm, the pressure start to go
And I can feel the life, it now begins to flow
There's something round the corner, there's something in the air
A cool, cool chill but I really don't care
I'm talking to the wind
Showers, under moonlight, try to rain on the parade
Don't fight the feelings, try to drain them out
Wash them away and they'll end without a doubt
I'm talking to the wind
Nothing's going to stop me cause I'm heading for the sky
Release the tension, it's good to be alive
Don't try to limit me, don't try to bring me down
Cause I've found a way to soar above the clouds
I'm talking to the wind
