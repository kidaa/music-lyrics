hey you, I hear you got nothing to lose
well I got a deal to soothe your soul, an offer you can't refuse
just step into my world, I guarantee you'll never be the same
let me introduce myself, I'm sure you've heard the name
they call me the pastor of disaster
sucker, I've got you now, it's time to make your descent
I've got one hell of a schedule, there will be no time to repent
what, you dare defy me, when I could slice you up with ease
I am temptation so get down on your knees
never cut a deal with the pastor
I am the 6-star general and these are my commands
bow to me and take my plague, spread it across the lands
never cut a deal with the pastor
can anybody help me, you sold your soul
can anybody help me, never cut a deal with disaster
never cut a deal with the pastor
can anybody help me, you sold your soul
can anybody help me, never cut a deal with the pastor
can anybody help me, you sold your soul
can anybody help me, never cut a deal with disaster
they call me the pastor of disaster
