Love, respect, learn from and admire the elderly
That old man's waiting in the snow again, he knows what he knows
But it isn't the same watching insults, launched over his head
He's out of the game but he isn't quite dead
The human remains
He fought fear with hope you'll eventually know, one day
You're the man un the snow, and it doesn't matter what
Fills you with dread
The game is a game and life is a thread
The human remains
