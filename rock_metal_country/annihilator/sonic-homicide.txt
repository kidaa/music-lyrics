Blasting and ripping it apart
Intense pain numbing to a pinch
Tearing the fabric of the soul
Killing is inch by inch
Listen to the words of the sick fuck
C'mon and drop to the knees
You want compliance, you want control
Devastation done with ease
Sonic homicide a torture
That's burning through the ears
Sonic homicide beware the killing is for real
Stone cold, a victim of the freeze
Ice pic stabbing through the heart
Airwaves, as deadly as can be
The damage has been done right from the start
Slipping into madness, can't deny the blame
Can't make out reality, can't deny the shame
Years and years of torment, life just hanging on
It's time to change the coarse, time to see the dawn
Call up the power, and bring on the faith
Bring on the demons, this match is made
I'll face the anger and I'll raise my head
To fight this beast and wake the dead
Stone cold, a victim of the freeze
Ice pic stabbing through the heart
Airwaves, as deadly as can be
