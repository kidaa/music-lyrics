"Edgar Allen Poe's strange tale of a gentleman whose true love succumbs to a fatal illness, is retold in the true fashion of the bizarre. A dreamy, drug induced state is no escape from the pain felt after losing his beautiful Ligeia. In time, he remarries. Soon after, however, wife number two falls ill and becomes comatosed. Life now drained from her body, an odd cry is heard from her death bed. The eyes stare back... Ligeia is reborn."
I do not remember, where we did meet
Lengthened years have built my mind, memories undeo
Yet with instability one thing stands too clear
Lady perfection, mystery, of whom I shed a tear
Airwoven divinity, mind, soul in victory
Cured of her malady, could this be my lost;
Ligeia
Airwoven divinity, mind, soul in victory
Cured of her malady, could this be my lost;
Ligeia
Sickness fell upon Ligeia, all knew she would die
Midnight came to lay her rest, farewell
Opium dreams, grief-stricken years, I took another bride
Replacing that which I did have, Ligeia why
Airwoven divinity, mind, soul in victory
Cured of her malady, could this be my lost;
Ligeia
Airwoven divinity, mind, soul in victory
Cured of her malady, could this be my lost;
Ligeia
Chronic disease, my luck cursed
My new wife has died
Coming from her bed of death, I thought I heard her cry
Could a corpse cold, stiff, sedate, sob in the bed it lie
Approaching her, I chilled to stone, for it did swiftly rise
I can never be mistaken, there were, they were Ligeia's eyes
Airwoven divinity, mind, soul in victory
Cured of her malady, could this be my lost;
Ligeia
Air woven divinity, tears shed, vitality
Cured of her malady, yet this is my lost;
