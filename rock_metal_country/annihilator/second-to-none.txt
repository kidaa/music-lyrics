Hello, are you looking for me? I'm the one to ease your pain
Just call me 'The Doctor' and I prescribe cocaine
I am your reason to live, I'm your church and I'm your pastor
C'mon, you've got nothin to lose, it's time to bring you up a little faster
It's time to kill let's have some fun
You'll fight but I'll win, 'cause I'm second to none
It's not the first time that you've taken the bait
You don't need anyone cause I will be your soul mate
C'mon and taste me, I'll take your where you want to go
Let's fly to the mountains, you can bury yourself in the snow
It's time to kill let's have some fun
You'll fight but I'll win, 'cause I'm second to none
You need me and I want you cause I'm the Devil's son
You'll fight but I'll win, 'cause I'm second to none
Welcome to my world, I hope you see there's no way out
Just look around you, I'll take you higher so just scream
Scream it out
I am your reason to live, I'm the power that runs in the veins
You can bet your ass, I'll take you down
But You've only yourself to blame
It's time to kill let's have some fun
You'll fight but I'll win, 'cause I'm second to none
You need me and I want you cause I'm the Devil's son
You'll fight but I'll win, 'cause I'm second to none
Second to none
