I am the box, I am a screen
I'm every nightmare, I'm every dream
I am the window over your land
So turn me on, come take my hand
Don't push me
I offer you scandal, I offer a wealth
Of grafuitous violence, hazerdous to your health
I give the vision, of how life should be
I choose your heroes, come follow me
Come follow me
Don't push me
It's just a box, It's just a screen
It's only a nightmare, It's only a dream
We give the vision, of how life should be
We choose our own heroes, come follow me
Don't push me
