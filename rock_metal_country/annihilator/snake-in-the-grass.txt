You were the world to me, I thought that I would always be there for you
I was too blind to see, I would have clibed the highest mountain for you
You gave me something to hope for, you made me feel like new
But tonight it's over and we're through, and we're through
I guess you've taken me for granted
You've filled my world full of lies
I want to know, give me some answers
But you can't even look me in the eye
Well I've taken all the shit I will take from you
And I've only just begun to see the light
You're just a big disgrace
Turn around, get out of my face
You've got no fuckin' class
Reptile, you're a snake in the grass
All the times we had together
Were they real or just a fantasy
So tell me why I wasn't good enough for you
Just maybe you're not good enough for me
Well I've taken all the shit I will take from you
And I've only just begun to see the light
You've been running around, having fun with anyone
I don't believe you have the right
Why, tell me why you're crying
You've brought this on yourelf
Lie, tell me why you're lying
It's time to put you on your shelf
Looks like I've taken you for granted
And I've seen right through your disguise
Tomorrow's going to be a better day for me
You can find someone else to victimise
Well I've taken all the shit I will take from you
And I've only just begun to see the light
You've been running around, having fun with anyone
I don't believe you have the right
Why, tell me why you're crying
You've brought this on yourelf
Lie, tell me why you're lying
It's time to put you on your shelf
Well I've taken all the shit I will take from you
And I've only just begun to see the light
You've been running around, having fun with anyone
I don't believe you have the right
