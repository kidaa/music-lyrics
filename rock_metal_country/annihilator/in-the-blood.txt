The lamb and the lion - I destroyed you
I tore your world apart
I left the pieces bleeding in the dark
The light and the darkness - come between us
I built the wall of tears
I built it straight through your heart
It's in the blood - running through my veins
The pain inside is driving me insane
I've done it all before and I'll do it again and again
Cause it's in the blood - it's in the blood
The dream and the nightmare
Lay on the pillow
Beside you every night
Cause what you see is what you get - from me
The light and the darkness - come between us
I built this wall of tears
I built it straight through your heart
It's in the blood - running through my veins
The pain inside is driving me insane
I've done it all before and I'll do it again and again
Cause it's in the blood - it's in the blood
Deep in my dreams
I'm all you want from me
I'm all of light, I'm electricity
Cause it's in the blood
It's in the blood - running through my veins
The pain inside is driving me insane
I've done it all before and I'll do it again and again
Cause it's in the blood
The light and the darkness - come between us
