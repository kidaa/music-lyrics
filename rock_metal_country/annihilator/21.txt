Welcome to the Hothouse, the game is called "21"
I was in debt right up to my neck, I wasn't having any fun
But then the dealer turned around, she looked me right in the eye
I got no time for a messing around but you know I had to give it a try
She's got me under the gun - she can't have 21
She asked me why I was takin' my time, sweat running down my neck
I had the 6, the lady got 9 from the bottom of the deck
A 4 for me, it was a good thing, but she was sitting on a face
I said hit me with your best shot and she gave me the ace
She's got me under the gun - she can't have 21
I've got to be the chosen one - she can't have 21
I've gotta win, I gotta win or I might as well be dead
God let me win, just let me win, or I might as well be dead
She's got me under the gun - she can't have 21
I've got to be the chosen one - she can't have 21
Deuce's up, dealer has 21. No-o-o-o-o!
