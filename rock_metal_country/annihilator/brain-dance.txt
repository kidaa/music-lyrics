I dropped out of the rat race
I just needed a break from it all
And now I live in the country
With the birds and the bees and these bright white walls
Let me introduce you to some friends of mine
They're so polite and they dress so fine
Sometimes they take me for a walk in the sun
I get to play in the grass 'till I'm done
Brain dance
Brain dance
This is brain dance
Watch my brain dance
I'd like to call myself an artist
My toe paintings are just the best
But when my feet get tired
I lose the crayon and get some rest
I've got a feeling there's a fish in the floor
I'd better squish it or he'll swim out the door
Sometimes they take me for a walk in the sun
I see my fish and I have to run
Brain dance
Brain dance
This is brain dance
Watch my brain dance
Rubber shoes, a dirty sock
Plastic toes and it's my pet rock
And this song is very silly and it makes no sense at all because it's weird
Out of the pan and into the fire and back in the pan again
He jumped out of the frying pan, into the fire and he's back again
He jumped, what?, yes he's jumped and he's flying through the air
He jumped out of the frying pan, into the fire and he's back again
Let me introduce you to a friend of mine
She's been here for quite some time
Sometimes we go out for a walk in the sun
To walk with ALICE is always fun
Brain dance
Brain dance
This is brain dance
Watch my brain dance
