"Death seen through the eyes of the dying and a summons from the great beyond to join the masses of lapsed lives. Mystery and, sometimes, fantasy. Theory and legend. The plight of dying or the fight to freedom? A supernatural transition to a world that is known only in dreams and in death. Welcome..."
Catch a shooting star, burn it to a crisp
Born into death, will you take the risk
See buckets and buckets, yeah buckets of sin
You'll never end and can never begin
Welcome to your death
Welcome to your death
Welcome to your death
No forest of pleasure or fields of pain
High-rise at night see the pavement of stain
A beckoning hand from those who were slain
Now you can sleep again
Welcome to your death
Welcome to your death
Welcome to your death
I take the night and I stretch it wide
And I see all, you hide, I died
So slip right in, sip the wine
The caution flashes but the water's fine
Welcome to your death
Welcome to your death
Welcome to your death
