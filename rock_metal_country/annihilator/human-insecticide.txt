"Incarcerated in an age old asylum , his cell runs rampant with menacing little creatures who flaunt their freedom by roaming so freely. Powerless to the cruelty and extreme disconcern of his human restraints, he finds timeless contentment by playing officer, judge and executioner over his 'cell mates'. The final sentence is always obliteration."
Psychotic tendencies have put me here for life
Dreams of smashing little things before they ruin my life
Find means capable of smothering a flea
Extermination is their end, escaping not from me
Retaliate
Decapitate - I love to see them bleed
Annihilate
I am human insecticide
Creepy black mass, I see one down below
Prepare to strike, act quickly now, strike the fatal blow
Extinguishing the menace, they will know my name
Destroying these, the lives of waste, delivered now to pain
Retaliate
Decapitate - I love to see them bleed
Annihilate
I am human insecticide
Asphyxiate the flame of life
From hatred they will die
Power kept in my control
Their souls are caged with mine
Expelled from life, they cannot hide, I will find them out
Their game's lost, I hunt them down, their end without a doubt
Psychotic tendencies, my dreams are coming true
My plans are set without repent, I'm tightening the screw
Retaliate
Decapitate - I love to see them bleed
Annihilate
I am human insecticide
