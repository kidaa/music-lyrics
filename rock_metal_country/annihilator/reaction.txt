Severe allergy reaction; personal experience here
Accidental intake, down the throat, the chance of survival can be
Remote, extreme reaction, I got to medicate, must inject the dose,
I hope that I'm not late
Push the plunger all the way, pray to live another day
Feel the rush through the veins, got to, got to un-invite the pain
Panic setting in, the waiting has begun, frustration,
The damage has been done, it's getting hard to breathe,
The swelling is intense, the last shot, it's the end of my defense
Push the plunger all the way, pray to live another day
Feel the rush through the veins, got to, got to un-invite the pain
