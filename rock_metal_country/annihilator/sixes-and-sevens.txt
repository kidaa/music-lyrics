"This title comes from the British phrase 'At sixes and sevens,' meaning 'at a point of disorder or confusion.' I think a lot of people will be able to relate to these lyrics, which describe a period in my life where everything was in confusion, without direction, and giving up was the easy way out. The moral of the story: 'Everything works out in the end if you really want it to!'"
Disillusioned, self-confusion
Trying to make it through another day
What's it all for, when does it end
There must be another way
Woven webs of intricacy
A life of nothing new
No one here to understand
Pressure's crushing you
Sixes and sevens
Disorder battles control
Sixes and sevens
Crises overflow
Aggravation deep frustration
I know what I want to do
Motivation is a problem
When it's driven out of you
Emotion, commotion's
Filling up the brain
Direction's null and void
Another drink dilutes the pain
Sixes and sevens
Disorder battles control
Sixes and sevens
Crises overflow
Sinking fast
Will it last
At sixes and sevens
Pulling through from yesterday
Another day is done
Determination
Self confidence has won
Woven webs of intricacy
Life is full of stress
That can only hinder
New desire to progress
Sixes and sevens
Disorder battles control
Sixes and sevens
Crises overflow
Sinking fast
Will it last
At sixes and sevens
