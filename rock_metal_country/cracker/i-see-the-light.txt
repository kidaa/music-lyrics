F#m I'd really like to see you now 
A In your father's combat boots 
F#m I'd really like to be with you 
A 'Cause we could be so dark 
F#m It was only for the grace of you 
E That I got this attitude 
D I'll show you my gratitude 
When I make it A though 
CHORUS: 
I see the G light at the end of the D tunnel now D7 I see the A light 
Someone please G tell me it's not a D train D7 train, I see the A light 
I see the G light at the end of the D tunnel now D7 I see the A light 
No time to G speak, no time to ex-D-plain 
Sometimes I imagine you 
Lying in your bed 
Sometimes do you imagine too? 
Do you sometimes lust 
For the grace that others have inside 
The simple peace they make with life 
They feel love like some summer's night 
CHORUS
