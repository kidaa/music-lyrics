INTRO & ENDING: 
Em-G-C 
Em-G-C 
Em-G-C 
Em-G-C 
Em Wind of G fate has pried us C loose Em Light of G mercy hurts my C eyes 
Em Is it G worth the things you C lose 
Em To board the train and watch the C sky 
BREAK: 
I D sing my-Em self to C sleep at night 
I D sing myself to D sleep 
CHORUS: 
Em G C Another song about the Em rain 
G C Coming down it burns through Em me 
G C Another song about the Em rain G C 
got a line straight from my heart 
was a time it ran to you. 
Another place where we were smart 
Before the flood and time was through 
REPEAT BRIDGE 
REPEAT CHORUS 
Sorry now I never made you see 
Sorry now sounds so far away 
Will our child cry for me 
When he hears the dragon's flame 
Highway flares make red the streets 
My fingers spin the dial again 
But every station on the news, yeah 
Another song about the rain Another song about the rain 
Another song about the rain Another song about the rain 
Another song about the rain Another song about the rain 
Another song about the rain Never rained so viciously
