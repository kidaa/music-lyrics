C-Em-Am-F
F-G-Am-G-F-Dm-G 
And here is Ivanovich 
in his rocket ship 
Spinning helplessly  
up above the earth 
While his heart is splintered 
All the girls of winter 
are buried in their coats anonymous 
While winter girls are waiting 
Ivanovich in high rotation 
He is just another star 
up in the sky 
While the world was waiting  
We're overwhelmed by some sensation 
of something long ago and far away 
Like general Jackson's arm  
it's buried on some farm 
While the fever  
pushes words from his lips 
And by the drunken river 
where the soldiers shiver 
We rest beneath the shade of the trees. 
While winter girls are saying 
each of us a tiny nation 
You're just another star 
but so am I. 
While the world was waiting  
We're overwhelmed by some sensation 
of something long ago and far away
