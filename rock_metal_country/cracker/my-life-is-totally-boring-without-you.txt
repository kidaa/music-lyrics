My life is totally boring without you around 
These days, they fade to another; I want you around 
So I'd like to say 
That I'm better off, 
I'm happier this way... 
But my life is totally empty without you around 
Well my life is totally boring without you 
Well I fell, but you fell much farther, I was envious 
Around here, everyone loves you, cuz you are insane 
So we started a band, 
owe it all to our fans, 
went somewhere near the top... 
My life is totally empty without you around 
Yeah my life is totally boring without you
