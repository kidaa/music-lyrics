A-E-F#m-slide down to E-Dsus4 
SECTION 2: 
D-E-F#m-C#m-D-Bm-E7 
D-E-F#m-C#m-D-Bm-E7 
A We went down to the E old part of town 
By the F#m stinking canal and the cotton slide down to E-Dsus4 mill 
Under a A ghetto palm with her E bicycle shorts on 
With a F#m gesture she slide down to E said to Dsus4 me 
D I E really must con-F#m-fess 
C#m I'd like to D get undressed Bm with E7 you 
D And though the E thought had never really F#m crossed my mind, 
C#m Oh, but D that was a lie Bm So we went a-E7-long 
We ran out under the turning leaves 
And the fetid earth, it was damp and cool 
Autumn's feeble light on her salty neck 
All innocence it was lost 
I really must confess 
I'm feeling quite distressed, my stars are always crossed 
But I have always taken more than I have given back 
And as a matter of fact, I've given nothing up
