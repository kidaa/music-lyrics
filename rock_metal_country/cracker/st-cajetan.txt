You know I don't feel well. 
I gotta thirst in my mouth. 
And all I want is a cool drink of water. 
You know I don't feel well. 
I got salt in my wounds. 
And all I want is a cool drink of water. 
Can you hear me, St. Cajetan? 
I once knew a well so sweet. 
I put my lips, my lips to the pail to drink. 
But I would give it all up for some water. 
You know I don't feel well. 
Got the salty taste of my tears. 
And all I want is some relief from this. 
You know I don't feel well 
Been tossed and turned on this ocean. 
And all I want is  this one wish. 
Can you hear me, St. Cajetan? 
All I want is a cool drink of water. 
Can you hear me, St. Cajetan? 
All I want is a cool drink of water. 
Can you hear me, St. Cajetan? 
All I want is a cool drink of water. 
Can you hear me? 
Can you hear me? 
Can you hear me, St. Cajetan?
