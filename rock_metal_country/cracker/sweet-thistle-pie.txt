It's been a long time since I had Sweet Thistle Pie 
It's been a long time since I had Sweet Thistle Pie 
She claps her hands and snaps her fingers 
Knows my name but calls me Ginger 
It's been a long time since I had Sweet Thistle Pie 
Hey Hey Hey Yeah 
Sweet Thistle Pie 
Sweet Thistle Pie 
Sweet Thistle Pie 
It's been a long time since I've been so very low 
It's been a long time since I've been so very low 
When I was young you were no stranger 
Around the world and slip through my fingers 
It's been a long time since I've been so very low 
Hey Hey Hey Yeah 
Sweet Thistle Pie 
Sweet Thistle Pie 
Sweet Thistle Pie
