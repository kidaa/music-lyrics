Hey hey it's okay to make  
a little mess out of your life. 
'Cause you don't need a diagram  
to show you how to have a good time. 
CHORUS: 
I said hey hey 
Don't mean to frighten you away. 
This is Cracker soul, it comes so easy. 
I said hey hey 
Don't get your head a mess. 
This is just the best, it comes so easy. 
It comes so easy. 
Hey hey it's okay to never know  
the answer but ask why. why oh why? 
'Cause you don't need another burden 
come and party with your spirit guide. 
I said hey hey 
Don't get your head a mess. 
This is Cracker Soul 
It comes so easy. 
I said hey hey 
Don't get yourself distressed. 
Love is just the best 
when comes easy. 
It comes so easy. 
CHORUS
