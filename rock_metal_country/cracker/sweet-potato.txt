G-D-G
D-G 
Be my sweet potato 
Be my honey lamb  
dance around the campfire  
hang around a while 
Well, I been caught stealin'  
someone else's vibe,  
everybody loves or hates us,  
but we're still alive 
CHORUS: 
Well wake up in the morning 
cup of coffee, grab your bags  
jump into the caddie  
'cause this tourin' ain't a drag.  
They say overrated, educated  
I suppose a little jaded.   
When I get off this  
I think I'm gonna have to be sedated.   
So be my sweet potato,  
I'll be your honey lamb,  
give me some black tupelo,  
I been caught again.  Shit! 
I went to New York City,  
but then I come right back,  
everyone was cool there, 
I couldn't get no slack   
You seen me in the papers,  
You seen me in the Voice,  
I think I'd stay in Dixie,  
if I had the choice. 
CHORUS
