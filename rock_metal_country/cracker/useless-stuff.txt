I'm so fucking sick 
I'm the king of the world 
I'm a genius of useless stuff 
Some people they gotta work 
well I just hang around 
dreaming up useless stuff 
So if I call you from time to time  
I said my life is such a drag 
I feel like a hag please shut me up 
Girl would you like to live my life 
And I'll be with you tonight 
I'll be your useless stuff 
Now everybody wants to be our friend 
so we act real Zen 
and hang around with movie stars 
So if I call you from time to time  
I said my life is such a drag 
I feel like a hag kick me in the ass 
Girl would you like to live my life 
And I'll be with you tonight 
I'll be your useless stuff 
I'll be your useless stuff 
Can I be your useless stuff?
