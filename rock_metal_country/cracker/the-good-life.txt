C-D-Em-G-C-D-Em
D-C-Em-D 
This holy circus camp 
Aladdin and his lamp 
A feverish daydreams and sway de loca 
My face in magazines 
The lesbian James Dean 
I got all I ever wanted 
So I don't mind saying 
This is how the good life's supposed to be 
The good life for you, for me 
Well I don't mind saying 
This is how the good life's supposed to be 
The good life for you, for me 
Down miles of empty road 
With acolytes in tow 
You could be Persephone 
A pigeon through the glass 
A drunken trapeze act 
Well you got all you ever wanted 
So I don't mind saying 
This is how the good life's supposed to be 
The good life for you, for me 
Well I don't mind saying 
This is how the good life's supposed to be 
The good life for you, for me
