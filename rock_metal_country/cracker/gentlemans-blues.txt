INTRO & BREAK: 
Bm-F#7bass C#-G-F#7-Bm-C#m-G-F#7-G-F#7-Bm-G-F#7-Bm-F#7 
Bm Where are my F#7bass C# God's green G grasses? F#7 
Bm Yellow blue C#m fishes of the G sea F#7 
G Where are F#7 you, my sweet Bm darling? G 
My sweet darling, I'll F#7 drown in miser-Bm-y F#7 
And on the golden days of summer 
Robbed from Pharoah's ancient tombs 
And the silver hours, they are mashed and sour 
My sweet darling, where have you gone? 
BREAK 
Past the dead and awkward factory 
Anthracite grey on cobblestone 
And the sooted flowers, on gentleman's towers 
My sweet darling, where have you gone?
