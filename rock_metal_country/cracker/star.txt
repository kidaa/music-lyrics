Gonna make you a star 
And show the world your green, green eyes 
See your smiling face 
Everywhere, everyplace 
We could turn it upside down 
We could turn it inside out 
We'll give you everything 
Things that you'd never need, 
Things that you'd never dream 
Things like eternity 
Gonna make you a star 
Make you a star 
Make you a star 
Gonna make you a star 
You stare down at the emptiness 
You shake us from our poisonous 
Slumbering and stuttering 
So start and stop the fall 
?Coarse masses? down the hall 
We'll blow you through the door 
Into a million bits 
We'll reassemble it 
That's how we'll make a hit 
Gonna make you a star 
Make you a star 
Make you a star
