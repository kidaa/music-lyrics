D 
Can I take my G gun up to C heaven? G C Cmaj7 D 
You know she's G always been by my C side G C Cmaj7 D 
Can I take my G gun up to C heaven? G C Cmaj7 D 
I'll check it with St. G Peter at the gate C Gsus4 
And if I had a D woman that was C faithful Am-G 
Or even D kind some of the time C-Am-G 
I'd drag her on D up to the gates of heaven C-Am-G 
Or follow her right D down to the gates of C hell Am D 
CHORUS 
G-D-C-Am 
G-D-C-Am 
G-D-C-Am G-D-C-Am 
C When I come home from a long day G a-working at the prison 
A I find my woman she's not a-D-round C 
She's down at Dahlie's corner G a-playing cards and drinking 
A Or sitting on the cars singing Dixie with the D boys C D 
CHORUS 
Can I take my gun up to heaven? 
Can I take my gun up to heaven? 
Can I take my gun up to heaven? 
Can I take my gun up to heaven? 
C Can I take my gun up to G heaven?
