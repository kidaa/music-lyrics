C Now here I am, the youngest old G man in the world 
Am And I have come to bring you my F burden 
C Of every sleepless night without G you in my arms 
Am Of being bored and calm and sometimes F sober 
D Don't mess me up by being F kind 
D Don't mess me up by being F wise 
Now here I am, I am the angel of Earth 
And I have come to bring you my burden 
Now here I am, I am the game warden of love 
'til someone took away my gin and tonic 
Don't mess me up I'm on a roll 
Keep being wise, I'll be inspired 
Don't C fuck me G up with C peace and G love when I Am haven't D got it Am in me D 
Don't C fuck me G up with C peace and G love when I Am haven't D got it Am in me D 
Am I haven't got it D in me 
Am I haven't got it D in me,

C Don't fuck me up with peace and G love 
Am Don't fuck me up with peace and F love 
C Don't fuck me up with peace and G love 
Am Don't fuck me up with peace and F love 
C Don't fuck me up with peace and G love no don't fuck me 
Am Don't fuck me up with peace and F love no don't fuck me 
C Don't fuck me up with peace and G love no don't fuck me 
Am Don't fuck me up with peace and F love no don't fuck me
