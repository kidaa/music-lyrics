C All these cats with holey jeans, Am dirty hair and titty rings, 
Say F what your scene man, we got these C questions. 
C Is it true that you have sold your soul? Am I say hey man, I don't know 
Lend me a F quarter won't you, I'll call my ac-C-countant. 
CHORUS: 
Let's get off C this, and get on Am with it, 
If you F wanna change the world shut your C mouth and start to spin it 
Get off this, get on Am with it 
If you F wanna change the world shut your C mouth and start this minute 
Petty little Ayatollah come around to judge and stone ya 
all we're trying to do is make a fortune 
Yeah we ain't got no government loans, and no one sends a check from home 
And get this: we're just doin' what we wanna 
CHORUS 
Well the guitar player stayin' out in Hollywood and sayin' 
He's just trying' to get some sleep, but everyone's complain' 
Are you truly deeply cynical 'cause boy you know I loved you so 
When no one knew your name and you were pompous. Still are 
CHORUS 
Let's get off this, and get on with it, 
If you wanna change the world shut yer mouth and start to spin it 
Get off this, get on with it 
If you wanna change the world shut your mouth, shut your mouth y'all 
ENDING REPEAT TO FADE: 
C N-na na na na, Am n-na na na na 
F N-na na na na na C naaa
