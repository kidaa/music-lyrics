You're a wild one 
Well I was once like you 
They couldn't tame you 
Kicked you out of the zoo 
Drank all of that soda pop 
Red candy on your chin 
I gave ya something to slow you down 
Just sped you up instead 
You're a wild one 
A wild one 
You're a wild one 
A wild one 
You're a wild one 
Were you raised by wolves? 
Learned their dark secrets 
Under the light of the moon? 
That's when the ??? comes 
To lock you in your chair 
So scream along at the top of your lungs 
Shout and shake your hair 
You're a wild one 
A wild one 
You're a wild one 
A wild one
