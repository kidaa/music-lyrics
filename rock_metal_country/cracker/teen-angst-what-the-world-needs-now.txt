D-G7-C-G-D 
I don't know what the world mayneed,  
but I'm sure as hell that is starts with me.   
And that's a wisdom, 
I've laughed at.  
I don't know what the world may want,  
but a good stiff drink it surely don't.  
So I think I'll go and fix myself a tall one. 
Cause, what the world needs now  
is a new kind of tension.  
Cause the old one just bores me to death.  
Cause, what the world needs now  
is another folk singer  
like I need a hole in my head. 
I don't know what the world may need,  
but a V8 engine is a good start for me.  
Think I'll drive to find a place,  
to be surly.  
I don't know what the world may want,  
but some words of wisdom could comfort us.  
Think I'll leave that up to someone wiser.  
Cause, what the world needs now  
are some true words of wisdom   
like La La La La La  
Cause, what the world needs now  
is another folk singer  
like I need a hole in my head.  
I don't know what the world may need,  
and I never grasped your complexities.   
I'd be happy just to get your attention.  
And, I don't know what the world may want,  
but your long, sweet body lying next  
to mine could certainly raise my spirits. 
Cause what the world needs now  
is a new Frank Sinatra   
so I can get you in bed.  
Cause what the world needs now  
is another folk singer   
like I need a hole in my head.
