F#m-E-D-A-F#m-D-A-E7 
F#mGold E summer D wheat 
A It sways in the F#m breeze 
D Till it fades in the A Autumn 
To E7 brown 
Cool summer grass 
It beckons and calls 
And I lie here with you 
In my heart 
CHORUS: 
Bm I can't C#m for-D-get you 
A I can't for-F#m-get you 
Bm I can't C#m for-D-get you 
At A all E7 
A-birds take to the sky 
They never alight 
They circle around 
Forever 
Now I tried but I failed 
To hide and disguise 
This one simple 
Sentiment 
CHORUS: 
I can't forget you 
I can't forget you 
I can't forget you 
No no 
CHORUS: I can't forget you 
I can't forget you 
I can't forget you 
At all, no no
