Well, lucky number seven passed me by 
Lucky number seven called my name and passed on by 
Well he came back don't you know 
with his brother six in tow 
And that is how number thirteen wound up by my side. 
And that is how I got these Lonesome Johnny Blues 
How I got these Lonesome Johnny Blues 
Got the Lonesome Johnny Blues 
and there's nothing I can do 
'Cept sing these sad old weary Lonesome Johnny Blues 
Here we go 
Grim Reaper he pulled up into my drive 
Grim Reaper pulled his little old Chevrolet right up onto the goddamn drive 
";Johnny, I haven't come for you 
but I want someone who's dear to you 
and the price you pay is to remain alive"; 
And I'll stay here with these Lonesome Johnny Blues 
Stay here with these Lonesome Johnny Blues 
With the Lonesome Johnny Blues  
and there's nothing I can do  
'Cept sing these sad old weary Lonesome Johnny Blues 
Woah, no more trouble send him down the road, won't you please. 
No more trouble won't you beat him up, won't you send him down the road 
Trouble dumped out the trash 
Ransacked the place for cash 
and he wound up taking much more than I own 
And he left me with these Lonesome Johnny Blues 
Left me with these Lonesome Johnny Blues 
With the Lonesome Johnny Blues 
and there's nothing I can do  
'Cept sing these sad old weary Lonesome Johnny Blues 
Johnny Blues 
the sad old weary Lonesome Johnny Blues 
Johnny Blues 
the sad old weary Lonesome Johnny Blues
