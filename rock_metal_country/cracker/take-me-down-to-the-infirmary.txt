Take me down 
to the infirmary 
lay me down 
on cotton sheets 
Put a damp cloth 
on my forehead 
lay me down 
and let me sleep 
I know the whiskey won't soothe my soul 
and the morphine won't heal my heart 
but if you take me down to the infirmary 
I won't have to sleep or drink alone. 
So, take me down 
to the infirmary 
walk a sound that is as blue as her eyes 
Oh, sister Magdelene won't you fetch the 
doctor's flask. 
He is going to need a steady  
a steady hand 
I know the whiskey it won't soothe my soul 
and the morphine won't heal my heart 
but if you take me down to the infirmary 
I won't have to sleep or drink alone. 
So, take me down 
to the infirmary 
lay me down on cotton sheets 
put a damp cloth on my forehead 
lay me down let me sleep 
lay me down let me sleep
