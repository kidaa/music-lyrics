Am Cigarette C and carrot juice F-Gsus4 
And get yourself a Am new tattoo C for those sleeveless F days of Gsus4 June 
I'm sitting on the Cafe Zinho's steps with a book I haven't started yet 
watching all the girls walk by 
Could I take you F out 
I'll be yours without a Dm doubt 
C on that big Gsus4 dipper 
And if the sound of this it frightens you 
we could play it real cool 
and act somewhat indifferent 
And hey June why did you have to come, why did you have to come around so soon 
I wasn't ready for all this nature 
The terrible green green grass, and violent blooms of flowered dresses 
and afternoons that make me sleepy 
But we could wait awhile 
before we push that dull turnstile 
into the passage 
The thousands they had tread 
and others sometimes fled 
before the turn came 
REPEAT SECTION 1 x2 
And we could wait our lives 
before a chance arrives 
before the passage 
From the top you can see Monterey 
or think about San Jose 
though I know it`s not that pleasant 
And hey Jim Kerouac brother of the famous Jack 
or so he likes to say ";lucky bastard"; 
He's sitting on the cafe Xeno's steps with a girl I'm not over yet 
watching all the world go by 
Boy you are looking bad 
Did I make you feel that sad 
I'm honestly flattered 
But if she asks me out 
I'll be hers without a doubt 
on that big dipper 
Cigarettes and carrot juice 
and get yourself a new tattoo for those sleeveless days of June 
I'm sitting on the cafe Xeno's steps 
I haven't got the courage yet, I haven't got the courage yet, 
I haven't got the ending Am courage yet
