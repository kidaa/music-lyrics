Dm Baby don't you drive around with A7 Dr. Bernice. 
She's not a lady doctor at Dm all. 
She's got hands like a man. 
With A7 hair on the back. 
She'll crush you with her em-Dm-brace. 
Though the F wind may C whisper and F moan some-A-times 
We Dm all need a Gm kind place A7 to Dm live. 
Though the F wind may C whisper and F howl at your A door 
We Dm all need the Gm comfort A7 of Dm friends. 
Baby don't you drive around with Dr. Bernice. 
That ain't a real cadillac. 
It's a delta 88 spray painted black 
with fake leather seats from Warren's 
Though the wind may whisper and moan sometimes 
On a hot desert night it is still. 
Though the world may whisper and howl at your door 
You're not obliged to let them all in. 
Okay Johnny.

Baby don't you drive ride in that faux cadillac 
If you must please ride in the back. 
If you sing while you ride you'll be a siren tonight. 
Spare this poor sailor's life from the rocks. 
Though the wind may whisper a melody now. 
We can't find a tune of our own. 
Though the world may whisper and blow in your face 
and tangle the hair on your head. 
On a hot desert night we can drive down the road 
And the stars will spell out your name. 
On a hot desert night with the windows down wide. 
The sirens will sing me their song. 
And the ghosts of the sailors who died on the rocks 
Feel not a twitch of regret. 
Though the wind may tangle the hair on your head. 
You sing like a siren to me. 
On a hot desert night, the caravan stops 
At the oasis next to your heart. 
The soundtrack is played by some aged British queen 
On BBC Radio One. 
Though the wind my whisper and epic sometime 
the cast must include Karen Black. 
Though the symphony strings shifts with the sand. 
You sing like a siren to me. 
You Gm sing like a A7 siren to Dm me 
You Gm sing like a A7 siren to Dm me Dm7-Dm6-Bbmaj7-A-A7-Dm
