INTRO & BREAK: 
Em-C-G-Dbass F# 
Em-C-G-Dbass F# 
Em-D-C-A-G-C 
Em How can I fly with these C old doggy wings 
While the G magpie sings some Dbass F# shiny song? 
Em Old corn face row of teeth, she says C sweetly to me 
In the G elevator Dbass F# 
CHORUS: 
Em Everything D seems like a C dream 
and A life's a scream. 
G-C 
Here come old Kerosene Hat 
With his ear flaps waxed, a courting' his girl 
Come clattering in here on your old cloven skates 
With that devilish spoon 
CHORUS: 
Everything seems like a dream 
And life's a scream 
When you're submarine 
BREAK 
So don't you bother me death with your leathery ways 
and your old chaise lounge old chaise lounge 
Wickerman's fence of leathery tyres 
And the cook's gone bad, started several fires 
CHORUS: 
Everything seems like a dream 
When your submarine 
Head like a stream she says softly to me 
from the rattling chair 
Bring me a steak and my old pair of crows, 
my medicine lamp 
CHORUS: 
Everything seems like a dream 
So life's a scream 
life's a scream 
Ring-around-rosie, pocket full of posies 
All fall down 
?, Don't suffer? 
? 
? 
? 
? 
Chaise lounge?
