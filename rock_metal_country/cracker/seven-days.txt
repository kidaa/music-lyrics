So we were standing, like the last rock band on the planet 
Of vapor trails and alpine skies 
It's all green fields, yellow flowers, and brown liquor 
Oh brown liquor 
Bug's got a job in the Catskills 
Met some fraulein along the way 
Took her home, but then she had an episode 
Though it did disturb him, he was strangely compelled 
Seven days will I've been waiting 
Seven days and seven nights 
Seven days will I've been dreaming 
Of the real thing 
Of the real thing 
So we were standing around, fading in and out of fashion 
While Amerikids dug Eurobeats 
Well we know all of the doormen and other bartendresses 
And there ain't nothing that you don't got that we don't need 
Did I say that right? 
Seven days will I've been waiting 
Seven days and seven nights 
Seven days will I've been dreaming 
Of the real thing 
Of the real thing
