MIDDLE SECTION: 
EmEm+6 and Em7 embellishments throughout 
This is a story about a dog, a dog 
When I ride my bike 
And my hair is blowing straight back 
I think of you wearing that brown mohair sweater 
Soft mounds of breasts underneath 
Or better yet one of those squigly aluminum lawn chairs 
I'm putting sun tan lotion on your long legs 
A-wearing a broad rim straw hat 
Pair of Mickey mouse sunglasses 
Looking just like lolita 
Looking just like lolita 
White sheets hanging on the line 
White sheets blowing in the wind 
A satellite dish pointed straight up at the heavens 
G-A-C 
Em A satellite dish pointing stright up at the G heavens, Isis!A Isis C Isis 
Em Isis! G Isis! A Isis C Isis 
Em Isis G Isis! A Isis! C Isis! 
Em Isis! G Isis! A Isis!C Isis! 
Em Oh yeah! Isis G arrrrrrrrrr
