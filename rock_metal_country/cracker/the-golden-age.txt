This is the Golden Age 
It's hard to imagine 
with the way I feel today    
that this is the Golden Age    
The Golden Age 
Somewhere I failed 
Somewhere I lost you 
in a black crowd of crows   
and shiny things 
I can't remember 

This is the Golden Age 
This is the Golden Age 
The Golden Age 

It seems like I'm high 
but baby I'm crawling 
in the unbearable days 
I threw away   
but I should have savored   
The flaxen light 
off of the dying wheat 
Your rye whiskey mouth 
and your dandelion teeth 

This is the Golden Age 
This is the Golden Age 
This is the Golden Age
