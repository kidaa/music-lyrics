Well we went to the station 
They were looking for Vegas 
But I was stuck in my beat phase 
Like it was 1959 
They say the girls wanna hip-shake 
They say the boys wanna ball-break 
But we couldn't be bothered 
Cuz we're hipper than y'all 
And everyday I resolve to say 
The world is mine 
So bring your ??? salvation 
Or a standing ovation 
Cuz I really deserve it 
And so much more 
The big kid in the magazines 
You and me, we went to make the scene 
?Better get your? name, man 
And tomorrow you'll be gone 
So everyday I resolve to say 
The world is mine
