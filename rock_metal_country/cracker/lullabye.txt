";Only when I laugh, does it hurt."; 
The doctor says, ";Please, son, remove your skirt."; 
";I'd be glad to comply, but I'm not wearing one."; 
The doctor says, ";That's strange, nor am I."; 
A Scotsman throws a pole into the air 
The alderman all vote in some affair 
The mayor, he abstained--and ain't that strange 
he's still a bachelor? Perhaps he's gay. 
A corpse is laid out neatly on a slab 
Professor's working madly in his lab 
The assistant files her nails and checks her hair 
There's just a hint of danger in the air 
There's just a hint of danger in the air 
No one is alarmed nor seems to care 
Everyone is happy, we're all fine 
We all fall in love all the time 
Yeah, we all fall in love from a plane 
With the stewardess, she serves us in our dreams 
When we wake, we find that it has rained 
When it rains, it lulls us back to sleep 
So rest your weary eyes and go to sleep 
Or rest your weary head and come to me 
Move your lips and sing this lullabye 
Move your lips and sing this lullabye
