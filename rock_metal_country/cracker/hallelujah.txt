D We sang Halle-G-lujah, has it stopped D raining? 
Though the D priest had stopped be-Em-lieving a long time a-A-go 
And his com-Bm-panion began to A laugh at the i-D-rony o' G that 
And we D walked along in Em an un-G-confortable D silence 
Yeah Bm ha- ha- ha- A hallelu-D-jah 
Bm ha- ha- ha- A hallelu-G-jah D 
St. Patrick led the sailor into the wasteland 
A herd of swine surrounded them one day 
It was the answer to their prayers, a sure sign that God, he cared 
But McCarthy disagreed: it's not that simple 
So hallelujah 
hallelujah 
The fisherman, he rode the city's river 
The dirty water rose through sorry planks 
And the vandal Moranjou? 'pon Gay St. heard the news 
They commissioned him to rise up from the cobbles 
Yeah Bm ha-A-llelu-D-jah 
Bm ha-A-llelu-D-jah 
Bm ha-A-llelu-G-jah D
