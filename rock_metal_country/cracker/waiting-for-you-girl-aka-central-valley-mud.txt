I'm living up near Fresno 
Just up Highway 99 
Won't you come and pay a visit 
I'm here all the time 
I'm still here waiting 
Waiting for you girl 
I'm still waiting 
Waiting for you girl 
I could wander up to Phoenix 
Get a good construction job 
If the sunstroke, it don't kill me 
the meth-amphetamine will 
But I'll still be waiting 
Waiting for you girl 
I'll still be waiting 
Waiting for you girl 
I'm still waiting 
I'm still waiting 
Waiting for you girl 
This once was an ocean 
Or should I say an ocean floor 
It should all be a desert 
And it shall be once more 
But I'll still be waiting 
Waiting for you girl 
Yeah, be here waiting 
Waiting for you girl 
I'm still waiting 
I'm still waiting 
Waiting for you girl
