If I had a gun for every ace I have drawn, 
I could arm a town the size of Abilene 
Don't you push me baby, 
Cause I'm all alone and you know I'm only in it for the gold 
All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars 
And I could pay you back with one good hand 
You can look around about the wide world over 
And you'll never find another honest man. 
Last fair deal in the country, 
Sweet Suzie, last fair deal in the town 
Put your gold money where your love is baby, 
Before I let my deal go down 
Don't you push me baby, cause I'm all alone 
Well I know a little something you might never know 
Don't you touch our liquor, just a cup of cold coffee 
I'm gonna wake up in the morning and go 
Everybody prayin' and drinkin' that wine 
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines 
Come to papa on the inside straight, 
Well I got no chance of losin' this time 
Last fair deal in the country, 
Last fair deal in the town 
Put your gold money where your love is baby, 
Before I let my deal go down
