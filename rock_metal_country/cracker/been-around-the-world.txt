INTRO: 
Am-F-C-G 
Am-F-C-G 
Am-D-F-G-Am 
Well is it Am such a sin to linger with the maga-F-zines C-G 
I want a Am chocolate bar made with something F sweet C-G 
I want a Am stranger with your face 
So I D followed her to this place 
It's F been so long - I've G been around the world Am 
I say hello to Howie, say hello to Spike 
'Cause the canals in Camden are filled with bottles tonight 
To watch the ripples fade away 
To feel the rain upon my head 
So I could say, I've been around the world 
And how I wish I was in your apartment tonight 
To hear the rain come down, down upon your roof 
To see your clothes beside, clothes beside your bed 
To lightly listen to your breath 
Instead, I've been, I've been around the world 
BREAK 
And how I wish I was in your bed tonight 
To taste the salt upon, salt upon your neck 
To feel your body press, pressing down on me 
Instead of being, I've been around the world 
Yeah I've F been around, 
I've G been around the world Am 
Yeah I've F been around, 
I've G been around the world Am
