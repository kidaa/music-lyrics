Now Bm I, I want F#7 out of the Bm circus 
Since the G girl in the blue sparkly D7 dress 
On one G knee, F# I con-Bm-fessed G 
Put an Bm end to that F#7 exchange of Bm glances G-F#7 
Now I, I want out of the circus 
That old gang of dwarves 
Sometimes, they're downright feral 
When they, they've been around that old beer barrel 
BREAK 
THIS VERSE IS ABSENT FROM THE GARAGE D'OR VERSION 
The old lion's teeth 
Seems like a smile to me 
With some sweet relief 
I just stick my head in 
Now my tale, it's too ordinary 
For anyone to care at all 
Not like the man repeatedly struck by lightning 
When he bears his scars, we all know 
When he Bm bears his F#7 scars, he's a Bm star G-F#7 
Bm GARAGE D'OR VERSION ONLY 
BREAK
