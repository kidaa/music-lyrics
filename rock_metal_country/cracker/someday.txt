CHORUS: 
Someday well I'll get it right. 
Yeah one day I'll get it right. 
Someday well I'll get it right. 
Yeah one day I'll get it right. 
And I had a dream last night 
that I was feeling barely human. 
So save me a place in your parking lot. 
And save me a place beside you  
when you lie down to sleep at night. 
Someday I'll get it right. 
CHORUS 
And if you see the dark clouds 
gathering out on the horizon. 
Don't be alarmed  
their just there for me. 
Just save me a place beside you 
when you lie down to sleep at night. 
Someday I'll get it right. 
CHORUS
