Am-G-F 
If I could just keep 
my stupid mind together. 
Then my thoughts across 
the land for you to see. 
The sun drags locomotives 
to the ocean. 
No one knows this like I do. 
Seconds clicking watch arm 
changes to dust. 
Whithered roots of hair 
and nights of rust. 
I'm waiting in the currents 
of the ocean. 
I'm so sick of goodbyes goodbyes 
CHORUS: 
I'm so sick of goodbyes goodbyes 
I'm so tired of goodbyes goodbyes 
Goodbyes 
Goodbyes 
When night comes crawling  
in on a horse. 
Soaking up my dreams 
through the pores. 
I'm so sick 
I'm so sick of goodbyes goodbyes 
Goodbyes 
Goodbyes 
CHORUS
