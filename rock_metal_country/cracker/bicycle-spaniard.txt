C-Bm-Am-G-F-C-G 
And it's a C long, long Bm way Am to the G top 
But when you come F down C it's one headlong G rush 
You've got an itch to scratch the shiny bits of light 
Hanging like stars, hanging like stars

And Mary says, you're such a restless soul 
My Bicycle Spaniard, my Magyar of cold 
You've got an itch to find what's best left lost and cold 
My Bicycle Spaniard, my poor restless soul 
My Bicycle Spaniard, my poor restless soul
