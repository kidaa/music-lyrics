Music: Steer
Lyrics: Walker
Lead: Administration of toxic compounds by M. Amott
Officinal - immiscible compounds are mixed,
A gagging expectorate, of lysergic acids,
Premensely emerced, consciousness slowly sips,
Peculated, in an ebriatng narcocis...
...Cataleptic,
Imbibe...neurotripsick...
Leads: Gross disorientation by W.G. Steer
Neurally numbed, a narcosis so trans-lucid,
So pernicious, halluciagenics,
Procreating, ocular contortion,
Your idiosyncrassy, is now expropriated...
...Extirpation,
Mind..termination...
