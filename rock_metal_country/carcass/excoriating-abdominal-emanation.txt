Vilely I defile, chastise, humiliate
Writhing, agonized as I violate to impregnate
With lathering soaps and suds I slowly enemize
Innards gurgulate as they're sickly baptised...
Your rectum I will flood
With bleach, detergents and suds...
Rupturing your gallbladder
Liver bleached and soaked
Lungs now flooded
With bicarbonates and boiling soap
Orifices pumped and plugged
Rectal membrane split
Evaporating your bowels
Anal muscle rips...
I grope in the grime, the evacuated motions slush
Pulverising your gut, in my rubber boots and gloves
Your nates purple and raw, brillo pads scour and cleanse
Sticking plasters on abrased organs, to try and make amends...
...Scour...abrase...scrub...erase...
Your innards I corrode
This process you will loathe
Your innards I evacuate
With my cruel methods of hate
Solo: Rectal incubation with intolerable hot enema
Anal track acidically removed
Along with rotten entrails and stools
Disemboweling in my rage
In your colostomy you suffocate
...Scour...abrase...scrub...erase...
Sadistically sodomizing with my instruments of grime
Forcefeeding it down your throat if I find the time
Vaseline and talc soothe the gored ano-obliteration
Sardonically I gloat on your rectal dislocation...
Seething with carnage lust
As the plastic tubing is enthrust...
Rupturing your gallbladder
Liver bleached and soaked
Lungs now flooded
With bicarbonates and boiling soap
Orifices pumped and plugged
Rectal membrane split
Evaporating your bowels
Anal muscle rips...
The anus sucked inside out, my victim now distraught
Rectal tissue I scald, as I boil the inner core
The orifice now clean - sanitised, red and raw
Brutally impaling your rectum, this process I adore...
...Scour...abrase...scrub...erase...
Your innards I corrode
This process you will loathe
Your innards I evacuate
With my cruel methods of hate
Anal track acidically removed
Along with rotten entrails and stools
Disemboweling in my rage
In your colostomy you suffocate
