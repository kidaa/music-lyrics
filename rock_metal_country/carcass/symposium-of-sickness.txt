Music: Owen
Lyrics: Walker
An encloaking, dark epoch
In which all life is now appraised
Another valueless commodity
On which the rapacious may feebly graze
Indebted homage to their mammon
Whilst the mort is the music of the meek
Transcendence from a beautifully brutal reality
Is what I seek...
Noxious, sully dolour
Is not the sentiment upon which we feed
But precocious consciousness
Draws out a morbid nous to bleed
Chiselling out seething words
Which cut deep down to the bone
Always legible
So be it on our own headstone...
Lead trem: Necrononism by M. Amott
Rising to our own nadir
Reality we try to extirpate
Trying to raise a twisted smile
Similar to that silver plate
On a coffin which is joined
Hammering in each final nail
Last kill and testament
Left now intestate...
Noxious, sully dolour
Is not the thesis which is bled
A precarious train of thought
In which mental cattle-trucks are led
Carving out skilful words
Which shear brittle bones
Always spelt out well
We just can't leave the dead alone...
Monographic text
A terminal doctrine of diseased minds perplexed
Enunciated epigrams
Eschatological, rotten requiems
Always our own worst cynics
Exorcisers of scorching scorn
Digging our own graves
But never stand over and mourn
The roulade now pandemonium
Displaced in the muggy sods
Espoused with the macabre
The dead we filch and rob...
...Munificant bale...
...From the deviants staid...
Execrations - taunting spiritual release
Exoneration - upon the perishable we feast
Excogitation - picking at the bones of convention
Exculpitation - foul verbal conflagration...
Epigraphic text, a literary vex
The macabre perplexed, with corporeality meshed
Lead: Eschatological excavation by W.G. Steer
Euthenic text
An unpleasant journey, to a world perplexed
Corporeal epigraphs
Eschatological unpleasantness
Always forever cryptic
Exercisers of twisted grief
Helping you to dig up the interred
Whilst fresh still are the wreaths
The harmony now pandemonium
Heard out in the muddy dirt
Espoused with the bizarre
We play on our own turf...
...Epithetic text...
...A macabre reality perplexed...
Execrations - literary tales of atrocities fairy
Exoneration - harsh, cold bloody marys
Excogitation - a narcissistic eutechnique
Exculpitation - perverse artworks, so unique...
Monographic text, a literary vex
The macabre perplexed, with reality meshed...
