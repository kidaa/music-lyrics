Lyrics: Walker
Excised and anatomised, deviscerated disarray
The torso diverged with pride
Deftly amputated, evulsed limbs now defunct
The trunk imbrued, tatty stumps used as lugs
For a chondrin puzzle so quaint
Head and body decollate
A heaving mass so quiescent...
Scattered and scrambled, your teasement grows
A bloody caricature to make whole
A squirming grisly jigsaw, detrital fragments fit so snug
- That missing piece will leave you stumped
Totally disassembled, nicely sliced and diced
- A cold mannequin once resembled
Real cranium teaser, carved from flesh and bone
- So mystifying...
Battered and diffused, with placating blows
- A human jigsaw to make whole
A sequacious pattern which once fitted so snug
- Joining together each dubious lump
Ravaged disassembly, neatly cubed and diced
- A cold mannequin reassembled
Astute brain teaser, incorporate flesh and bone
So mortifying...
An incessant game - methodically made
With each cumulative piecing - of commensated meat...
Bi-manual reconstruction, eldritch problem complete
A convened effigy
A pathological toy, each chunk rigorously
Inter mortis locking, as you pathogenically rot
Such a perplexing task
To fit the remains in a casket
Uliginous mess so quiescent...

An incessant game - methodically made
With each cumulative piece - of commensated meat...
