And on her doorstep 
I saw that I was blind 
I'd forsaken 
What was mine 

What had mattered 
Mattered little now 
We had shattered 
Apart somehow 

Ooh 
I can't help but stay the same 
I remain true to my name 

Time to get up 
And take the long walk home 
For the first time 
I go alone 

Do you remember 
when we first met 
Chasing down the alleyways 
behind my dad's 

Ooh 
I can't help but stay the same 
I remain true to the name 
Of lovers past 
Good enough to lose 
Good enough to choose you, too 

Ooh 
I can't help but stay the same 
Ooh 
I remain true to the name 
Of lovers past 
Good enough to lose 
Good enough to choose you, too
