innocence
innocence finds you there
innocence
innocence doesn't care
any way you choose
the sun and the son
are true
hold me now
I won't let go
innocence
innocence lets you go
innocence holds you down
any way
any way that you want
and you will be there
with the sun
and you say you don't care
oh, any way
any way that you want
in the love
in the love we're unsung
it's any way
any way that you want
hold it in
innocence in your arms
innocence
innocence holds you there
innocence
innocence doesn't care
innocence
innocence lets you dream
innocence
