Bleed in your own light
Dream of your own life
I hear you
I hear you return, come back again
Come on, come on 

And when your days return
You'll find yourself alone
With your hands above your heart
And we'll rise 

We'll rise again
I won't pretend, yeah yeah
We'll rise again
I won't pretend, yeah yeah, with you 

'Cause when you find yourself alone
With your hands above your heart
'Cause when you find yourself alone
With your hands above your heart 

You'll find yourself alone
To relax and fade away
You'll find yourself alone
To relax and fade away 

I shall be free
I shall be free
I shall be free, of me
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
I shall be free
Let go that rocket inside of me
