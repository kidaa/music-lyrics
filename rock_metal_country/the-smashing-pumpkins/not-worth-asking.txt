not worth asking who i'm supposed to be
not worth saying, seems i'm free
not worth reaching to anyone at all
not worth reaching out to stop this fall
i'm on my own
yeah, i'm on my own 

not worth being, i might already be
i just want someone to reach for me
not worth thinking*, it's not worth digging down           *or  quot;sinking quot;
i've been here before and hate what i've found 

it's too late, too late
i'm on my own, i'm on my own
i've gotta go so far away
it's too late, too late
i'm on my own, i'm on my own
i've gotta go so far away, so far away 

not worth asking who i'm supposed to be
not worth saying something, seems i'm free
not worth reaching to anyone at all
not worth reaching out, i'll stop this fall 

but i like you just the same
you've got to know somehow
that i'm the one to blame
we've come so far along
to end this destiny
you've got to know somehow 

that it's too late, too late
i'm on my own, i'm on my own
i've gotta go so far away
yeah, it's too late, too late
i'm on my own, i'm on my own
i've gotta go so far away, so far away
