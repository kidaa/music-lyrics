farewell goodnight last one out turn out the lights
and let me be, let me die inside
let me know the way from of this world of hate in you
cause the dye is cast, and the bitch is back
and we're all dead teah we're all dead
inside the future of a shattered past
i lie just to be real, and i'd die just to feel
why do the same old things keep on happening
because beyond my hopes there are no feelings
bless the martyrs and kiss the kids
for knowing better, for knowing this
cause you're all whores and i'm a fag
and i've got no mother and i've got no dad
to save me the wasted, save me from myself
i lie just to be real, and i'd die just to feel
why do the same old things keep on happening
because beyond my hopes there are no feelings
everybody's lost just waiting to be found
everyone's a thought just waiting to fade
so fuck it all cause i don't care
so what somehow somewhere we dared
to try to dare to dare for a little more
i lie just to be real, and i'd die just to feel
why do the same old things keep on happening
because beyond my hopes there are no reasons
