Got me a raygun
Got me an altitude
Can't help feelin' something's wrong
With everyone of you 

Inside your head
Trust me instead
Inside your head

Talk revolution
As if it matters now
I don't care anyway
Just give me what I want

Inside your head
Trust me instead
Inside your head

Ooh, honey
Fill me with your little whispers
Store your little nightmares
Of a generation set to burn

Come on honey
Let's go for a ride
Down where the crickets learn and sing and play, baby

Inside your head
Trust me instead
Inside your head
Trust me instead
Inside your head
Trust me instead
Inside your head

yeah, it's a motherfucker, oh
