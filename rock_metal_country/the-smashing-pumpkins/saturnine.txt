to the ages I have seen
creatures I have stopped
bloody simple features
everyone's choosing sides

we are inside
we are inside now
we are inside
we are inside
saturnine

how I'd love to waste your time
saturnine
saturnine

goodbye all you widows
tear-stained underneath
blessed onto the many
while seeking some relief

saturnine
how I'd love to waste your time
saturnine
saturnine
saturnine
you are waiting on the side

camera take this picture
wreckage is outside
we're hereby forgotten
we are losing our minds

we are inside
we are inside now
we are inside
we are inside
you've always cried
so that you'll never find
