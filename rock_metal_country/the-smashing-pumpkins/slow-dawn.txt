midnight people rushing for a downtown train
watching and wasting away
empty hearts beat free
cool frequency
and I don't know what it is
I'm gonna run
the slow dawn
seeking sigh
oh so faint
I'm gonna run
the slow dawn
away
it's best undone
[hard to hear this part]
and I'm not sure what it is
but I'm sure that I can give
away the slow dawn
slow dawn moves by your side
takes your silent sleep
slow dawn
midnight people washing down here, wasting away
they're gonna run
the slow dawn away
the slow dawn away
the slow dawn away
the slow dawn away
