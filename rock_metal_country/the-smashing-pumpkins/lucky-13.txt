this in blood
I suppose
breaking jaws
I'm no good 
as the prodigal son
and I know that you're mesmerized
had a vision, made these laws
and sanitized []
I miss him so
you are so fucked
it has begun
revolution crawls
all over you
[]
you light up the sky
and scrape out your skull
your lovely face
will never []
it was so unlikely doom
upon my wrists I bear the cross
my losses mounted as I climbed across the hole
of my own soul
I'll climb across
I don't exist
I am divine
a ghost with eyes
