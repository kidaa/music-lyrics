Unleash the armageddon 
So all the children go to heaven 
I sit by quiet still with their pictures on my eyes 
You'll draw the guns you're given 
Write down the words as written 
And never disturb the presence of resurrection crutch 
And it's about time 
It's about drawing near 
Blue skies bring tears 
Blue skies bring tears 
Descend the darkened stairways 
Make hate with plastic playmates 
And fire out remaining traces of your self esteem 
Mainline the deepest secrets 
Lick clean the dirty fingers 
I am a stranger to you as you are to yourself 
And it's about time 
It's about fear 
Blue skies bring tears 
Don't you want me 
As I awake the city sigh 
We'll watch the seasons die 
Blue skies bring tears 
Take me inside your body 
Cover me with your soul 
To the darkest recess 
Is where I wish to go 
You are the sweetest flower 
That I have ever devoured 
I ask for nothing given 
For nothing in return 
Blue skies bring tears
