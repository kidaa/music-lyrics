say hello before you say goodbye
i should go, before you make me cry
she wants to bleed every drop inside of me
but i aim to please the little girl inside of me, too

yeah, yeah
you know i hate to say
oh no, i always stay
i don't wanna be like the others please 

who is sorry now
who is sorry now
if i show you how
will you let me down 

slit my wrists and die a whore
love to love to love what you adore
i can give you anything, but please let me
be your everything... please 

yeah, yeah
you know i hate to say
oh no, i always stay
i don't wanna be like the others please 

who is sorry now
if i show you how,
will you let me down
will you let me down 

who is sorry now
who is sorry now! 

my love is weakness
my love is oh so wrong
my love is sadness
my love is oh so strong
my teeth are razor sharp
my love is f***ing strong
i'll be with you
but not for long 

oh, oh, oh 

yeah, yeah
you know i hate to say
oh no, i always stay
i don't wanna be like the others please 

who is sorry now
who is sorry now
who is sorry now 

if i show you how
will you let me down
will you let me down
please let me down
please let me down
