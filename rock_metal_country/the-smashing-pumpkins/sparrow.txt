narrow, marrow 
silent, sparrow 
secret, serpentine smile 
distant, crying child 

you're my lost little love 
you're my lost little one 

urgent, arrow 
arcane, echo 
my, my, my have we thrown 
together apart and together again 

we will scatter friends 
like the whistling wind 
you can see me wave 
same, i'm the same 

but if i did 
and i meet you there 
you'll hold my hand 
pretend you understand that 
i'm just one man 
still a boy perhaps 
simple silent humble human-being 

we will scatter friends 
like the whistling wind 
you can see me wave 
same, i'm the same 

and eiffel towers 
and distant isles 
and ocean miles 
and mountain wilds 
and film stars 
and restless charge 
moving roaring 
soaring gone, gone, gone 
and with built-in lion ears 
i can hear you now
