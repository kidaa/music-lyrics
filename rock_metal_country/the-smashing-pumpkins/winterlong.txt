and if I fall 
into you all 
will my rain 
cease and dissolve 
some come to harm 
others to grace 
so let my friends fly 
under these wings 

we're giving it up to the sun 
we're giving it up to the moon 
we're giving it up to the earth 
we're giving it up from our own 

knowin' there's nowhere to run 
knowin' there's not much to lose 
sometimes it seems so long 
since you had a chance to refuse 

we built a fire 
winterlong 
transformed new wire 
winterlong 
i was the first one 
i was the last one to be strong 

and if I fall 
into you all 
will the silence 
shatter and stall 
some feel movement 
others stand still 
so let the moment 
become my will 

we're giving it up to the sun 
we're giving it up to the moon 
we're giving it up to the earth 
we're giving it up from our owns 

knowin' there's nowhere to run 
knowin' there's not much to lose 
so why does it take so long 
to find out who is who 

we built a fire 
winterlong 
transformed new wire 
winterlong 
i was the first one 
i was the last one to be strong 

we're giving it up to the sun 
we're giving it up to the moon 
we're giving it up to the earth 
we're giving it up from your own 

we're giving it up to the sun 
we're giving it up to the moon
