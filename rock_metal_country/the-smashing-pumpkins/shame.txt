You're gonna walk on home 
You're gonna walk alone 
You're gonna see this through 
Don't let them get to you 

Shame 

Love is good and love is kind 
Love is drunk and love is blind 
Love is good and love is mine 
Love is drunk all the time 

Shame 

You're gonna walk on home 
You're gonna walk alone 
You're gonna walk so far 
You're gonna wonder who you are 

Shame 

Love is good and love is kind 
Love is good and love is blind 
Love is good and love is mine 
Love is good all the time 

Hello goodbye, you know you made us cry...
