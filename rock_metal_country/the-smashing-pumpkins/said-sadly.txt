You should know that i love you
we should love like lovers do
and i can't help but fall for you
ah honey, i'm just a fool
now you know 
darling, i'll never be true
you see, for so long i was blue
i'm not the lonely one
and if i hurt, then you will, too
ah honey, i always lose
now you know 

lover, when will you
i'm so afraid that no one cares
lover, can't find you
i swear to god, don't leave me here
now you know 

oh you know that it can't be
when no one else here really means
anything to me
if you hurt inside
if you confide in me again 

since you ran away
hold me now
tell me how
love is ours 

lover, when will you
i'm so afraid that no one cares
lover, can't find you
and no one knows what brings us here
lover
hold me now
tell me how
love is ours
