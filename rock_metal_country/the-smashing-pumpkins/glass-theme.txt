shattering fast
I'm glass
I'm glass
I'm shattering fast
I'm glass
I'm glass
I'm shattering, shattering
glass, glass, glass
I'm shattering fast
I'm glass, I'm glass
got a lot of tears
in a blood stained jar
it's been a real long time
since I walked the fine line
you put up the walls
you put up the walls
hold all my calls
cause I'll be by the pool
won't you please worship me
won't you love what I adore
I'm alone in my soul
I betrayed rock 'n' roll
rock'n'roll
rock'n'roll
rock'n'roll
rock'n'roll
everybody knows I'm last
I'm last
and everybody knows I'm fast
I'm fast
I'm shattering, shattering glass 
glass, glass, glass
I'm shattering fast
I'm glass
I'm glass
you put up the walls
hold all my calls
cause I'll be by the pool
playing with my guns
cause there's nowhere to run
cause I'm the one you love now
staying after school
breaking all your rules
shattering fast
shattering glass
shattering glass
I'm shattering glass
