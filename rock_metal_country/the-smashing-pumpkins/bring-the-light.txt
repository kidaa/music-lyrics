Shot down I stood
Withstood my neighborhood
I got it wrong
But I could
Follow love lest I learn

It's light
To bring the light
I fought with all my might
With light
Oh bring the light

Light
Bring the light
I never felt so good and right
But tonight
You'll never need another sound
Oh bring the light
Bring the light to me

Here and gone oh I trust
You'd spit upon my dust
And mix my ash with your blood
A son of God you know you must arrive
In the light
Bring the light
Let's bring the light
Light
Oh bring the light

Light
Bring the light
It's yours not mine
If you just want to survive
Go grab a glimpse of any star 
In heaven's high
I never felt so real and loved and alive
No shadows follow me unsung
In the light
Bring the light to me

A flower song, clear and bright
Is it wrong in neon white
To insist you are mine
Standing dumb in the light

Bring the light
Oh bring the light
Bring the light

Light
Bring the light
I never felt so real and right and alive
Don't let them steal you from what's yours by right
Light
Bring the light
You know there comes a place and time
You can't deny
With every movement shadows cast and align

Bring the light
Bring the light
Bring the light
Let's bring the light
Light
Bring the light
Bring the light
Let's bring the light
Light
Bring the light
Bring the light
Let's bring the light
Light
Bring the light
Bring the light
Let's bring the light
Light
