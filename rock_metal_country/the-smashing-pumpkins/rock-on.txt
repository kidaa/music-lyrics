hey kids rock and roll 
rock on 
cool my soul 
hey kids it's no use 
sleeping 
showtime summertime blues 
jump up and die in your blue suede shoes 
hey kids rock and roll 
we're gonna rock on 

where do we go from here 
which is the way that's clear 
still looking for that blue jean baby queen 
prettiest girl i've ever seen 
see her die on my movie screens 
every day 

rock on 
rock on 
rock on 
rock on 

hey kids rock and roll 
rock on 
cool my soul 
hey kids it's no use 
dreaming 
lost out, find out, shut out, cracked out 
hey kids rock and roll 
we're gonna rock on 

where do we go from here 
which is the way that's clear 
where do we go from here 
which is the way that's clear 

still looking for that blue jean baby queen 
prettiest girl i've never seen 
see her die on my movie screens 
every day 

rock on 
rock on 
rock on 
rock on 

and the cradle will rock 
yes the cradle 
the cradle will rock 
i said rock on 
rock on 
everyone wants some 
i want some too 
everyone wants some 
hey how about you 
i said rock on 
rock on 

rock on 
rock on 
rock on 
rock on 
hey kids rock and roll 
gonna rock on 
rock on 
cool my soul 
hey kids rock and roll 
gonna rock on 
rock on 
gonna rock on 
rock on 
rock on
