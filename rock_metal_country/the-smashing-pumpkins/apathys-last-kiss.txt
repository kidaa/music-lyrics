What's the matter
What's the difference
You'll feel better if you lie
With the stars in your eyes 

Honey, Honey
Where's my baby
She knows better than to cry
With the stars in her eyes 

There is no safe place to go
I should know
The lame and the droll have needs
To let their feelings show 

What's the matter
What's the difference
What's the question
You'll feel better if you lie
With the stars in your eyes 

There is no safe place to go
I should know
The lame and the droll have needs
To let their feelings show 

Bury your heart in a hole
Bury your heart in a
Bury your heart in a
Bury your heart in a hole
