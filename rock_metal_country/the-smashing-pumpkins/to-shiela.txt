Twilight fades
Through blistered Avalon
The sky's cruel torch
On aching autobahn
Into the uncertain divine
We scream into the last divine

You make me real
You make me real
Strong as I feel
You make me real

Sheila rides
On crashing nightengale
Intake eyes
Leave passing vapor trails
With blushing brilliance alive
Because it's time to arrive

You make me real
You make me real
Strong as I feel
You make me

Lately, I just can't seem to believe
Discard my friends to change the scenery
It meant the world to hold a bruising faith
But now it's just a matter of grace

A summer storm
Graces all of me
Highway warm
Sing silent poetry
And I could bring you the light
And take you home into the night

You make me real Lately, I just can't seem to believe
You make me real Discard my friends that change the scenery
Strong as I feel It meant the world to hold a bruising faith
You make me real But now it's just a matter of grace
