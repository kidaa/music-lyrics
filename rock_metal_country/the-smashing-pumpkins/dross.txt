you say I'm beautiful
well I can't help it
you say I'm empty
we all know I'm full of shit

get out, get out
you've lost control
get out, get out
you're growing cold
can anyone
anyone be true
does anyone
anyone want to be you

you say I'm tragic
I say it's magic kid
you say I'm lucky
we all know what's in your cards

get out, get out
get out, get out
you've lost control
can anyone
anyone be true
does anyone
anyone want to be you
do they want to be you
[bring it down]

floating
knocked out, sky high, floating
flat out, deadly truth
does anyone want to be you
can anyone
anyone be true
does anyone
anyone want to be you
do they want to be you

Arising! Alt. Lyrics

You say I'm beautiful
Well I can't help it
You say I'm empty
We all know I'm full of shit

You're out of good know
You're growing cold
You're out of control
You've lost control
Can anybody, anybody be true
Does anyone, anyone wanna be you

You say I'm tragic
I say it's magic kid
You say I'm lucky
You know who's in the cards

Get out of good know
You've lost your love
You're growing old
Can anybody, anybody be true
Does anyone, anyone wanna be you

Some will let you eat their razorblade
Let you wave a flag in their parade
Dress you up in their own charade
America the beautiful

Let me put you on the shelf
And I am damaged to someone else
Can anyone, anyone be true
Does anyone, anyone wanna be you

Love you
I just gotta love you
Cried out to be true
Does anyone wanna be you
