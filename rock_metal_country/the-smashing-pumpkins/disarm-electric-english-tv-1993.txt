disarm you with a smile
and cut you like you want me to
cut that little child
inside of me and such a part of you
ooh, the years burn 

i used to be a little boy
so old in my shoes
and what i choose is my choice
what's a boy supposed to do
the killer in me is the killer in you
my love
i send this smile over to you 

disarm you with a smile
and leave you like they left me here
to wither in denial
the bitterness of one who's left alone
ooh, the years burn
ooh, the years burn, burn, burn 

i used to be a little boy
so old in my shoes
and what i choose is my voice
what's a boy supposed to do
the killer in me is the killer in you
my love
i send this smile over to you 

the killer in me is the killer in you
send this smile over to you
the killer in me is the killer in you
send this smile over to you
the killer in me is the killer in you
send this smile over to you
