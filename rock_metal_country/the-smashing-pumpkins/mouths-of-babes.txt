so here we are true superstars we're so real from afar and now
now you're with us now 

and the mouths of babes sing revolution
and the mouths of babes scream disillusion
you can't break what's already broken
cause from the mouths of babes comes nothing 

the  quot;dream quot; was a sham for saving what you can't and now
they're me but i'm not them i am you and you are me
it's in the ways i walk thru fire
it's in the ways of my desire
and when i said that you're no good
what i meant was i wish i could
be there forever be young forever i wish you could be there
so now i bid farewell beyond the bounds of hell
and now you'll swear you knew us well
well you can never tell 

and the mouths of babes sing revolution
and the mouths of babes scream disillusion
you can't break what's already broken
cause from the mouths of babes comes nothing
