Give me tears 
Give me love 
Let me rest 
Lord above 
Send the bored 
Your restless 
The feedback scarred 
Devotionless 
You're all a part of me now 
And if I fall 
You're all a part of me now 
In the sun 
You're all a part of me now 
You're all a part of me now 
Will our love ever be enough 
Just in time to prove 
Will our words ever be enough 
Just in time to lose 
Give me sight 
And barren breast 
Pure snow and happiness 
Give me time 
Give me peace 
And I will prove 
My release 
You're all a part of me now 
And if I fall 
You're all a part of me now 
Trapped in the sun 
You're all a part of me now 
You're all a part of me now 
Will our love ever be enough 
Just in time to prove 
Will our time ever be enough 
Will out love ever be enough 
You're all a part of me now 
And if I fall 
You're all a part of me now 
In the sun 
You're all a part of me now 
You're all a part of me now 
You're all a part of me now 
And if I fall 
You're all a part of me now 
Trapped in the sun 
You're all a part of me now 
Will our love ever be enough 
Just in time to prove
