Mother I'm tired 
Come surrender my son 
Time has ravaged on my soul 
No plans to leave but still I go 

Fallin' with the leaves 
Fallin' out of sleep 
To the last goodbyes 
Who cares why 

Mother I've tried 
Wasting my life 
I haven't given up, I lie 
To make you so proud in my eyes 

Fallin' out of sleep 
Crawlin' over me 
To the last goodbyes 
Who cares why 

Tuesdays come and gone 
Restless i still drive 
Try to leave it all behind 

Fallin', fallin' out of sleep 
Fallin', fallin' with the leaves 
I go crawlin', crawlin' over me 

Once upon a time in my life... 
I went falling... 

Mother I hope you know 
That I miss you so 
Time has ravaged on my soul 
To wipe a mothers tears grown cold
