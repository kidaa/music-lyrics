i can't stop, i can't breathe, i can't think
i'm in love again
i don't need, i don't eat, i don't sleep
i'm in love again 

ooh, and every time i heard you breathe
i sighed
ooh, and every time i saw you bleed
i cried
love is like a song
and if you sing
if you ever need me
i'll be there, and i- 

i can't stop, can't breathe, can't think
i'm in love again
i don't need, i don't eat, i don't sleep
i'm in love again 

ooh, and every time that i'm with you
i'm alive
ooh, and every time i think of you
there's a light
and i felt it, too 

and my heart is a spring
is a well, if you need
if you drink it for you
then i'm leavin'
every little part of me is a part of you 

i can't stop, i can't breathe, i can't think
i'm in love again
i don't need, i don't eat, i don't sleep
i'm in love again
i can't stop, i can't breathe, i can't think
i'm in love again
i don't need, i don't eat, i don't sleep
i'm in love again
the boy, the boy's in love
the boy, the boy's in love
the boy, the boy's in love
the boy, the boy's in love
