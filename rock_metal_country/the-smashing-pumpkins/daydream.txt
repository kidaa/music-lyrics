My daydream seems as one inside of you
Though it seems hard to reach through this life
Your blue and hopeless life 

My daydream screams bitter 'til the end
The love i share -true- selfish to the heart
My heart, my sacred heart

My daydream dream
My daydream
My daydream dream
My daydream
. . .

I'm going crazy
I'm going crazy
I don't want fellngs
Your feelings

I have gone crazy
Motherfucking crazy
I have gone
