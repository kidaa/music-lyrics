today is the greatest
day i've ever known
can't live for tomorrow,
tomorrow's much too long
i'll burn my eyes out
before i get out 

i wanted more
than life could ever grant me
bored by the chore
of saving face 

today is the greatest
day i've ever known
can't wait for tomorrow
i might not have that long
i'll tear my heart out
before i get out 

pink ribbon scars
that never forget
i tried so hard
to cleanse these regrets
my angel wings
were bruised and restrained
my belly stings 

today is
today is
today is
the greatest day 

i want to turn you on
i want to turn you on
i want to turn you on
i want to turn you 

today is the greatest
today is the greatest day
today is the greatest day
that i have ever really known
