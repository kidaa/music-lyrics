Say, now listen here
I wanna be oh so clear
I lost my soul, lost I'll stay
Between your hands and my beliefs
And here I am, frail
Frail and bedazzled from all the glare 

Tug at my sleeve
My little girl, supermaid
She don't know that I have stole my smile from a cheshire cat
And all I wanted was to be a man
Since I gave up
I feel free
I feel free
I feel free
I feel free

The two of us, that's dangerous
It's all inside our heads
Givin' in for nothin' less
Leavin' me for him

Try to understand
The ones that love
And their demands
It's so unfair
When they can't see
That I'm the boy
Who really needs
Their love,
I suppose

Frail and bedazzled from all the
Frail and bedazzled from all the
Frail and bedazzled from all the glare
