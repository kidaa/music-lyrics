By starlight I'll kiss you
And promise to be your one and only
I'll make you feel happy
And leave you to be lost in mine
And where will we go, what will we do
Soon said I, will know
Dead eyes, are you just like me
Cause her eyes were as vacant as the seas
Dead eyes, are you just like me
And all along, we knew we'd carry on
Just to belong
By starlight I know you
As lovely as a wish granted true
My life has been empty, my life has been untrue
And does she really know, who I really am
Does she really know me at last
Dead eyes, are you just like me
