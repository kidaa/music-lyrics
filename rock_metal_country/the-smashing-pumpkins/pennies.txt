and i stumbled onto you as you stumbled over me
and you say the fates were cruel for throwing us together
i always loved you so especially when you'd go
all the world must know that i loved you so
it's a pity we're apart it's a shame you broke my heart
but i've got a new girlfriend she looks alot like you dear
no one could ever do dear all the world must know
that i loved you so especially when you'd go
especially when you'd go away and leave me here
go away and leave me alone all the world must know
