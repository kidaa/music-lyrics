the useless drag of another day
the endless drags of a death rock boy
mascara sure and lipstick lost
glitter burned by restless thoughts
of being forgotten
and in your sad machines
you'll forever stay
desperate and displeased-with whoever you are
and you're a star
somewhere-he pulls his hair down-over a frowning smile
a hidden diamond you cannot find
a secret star that cannot shine over to you
may the king of gloom, be forever doomed
and in your sad machines
you'll forever stay
burning up in speed
lost inside the dreams, of teen machines
the useless drags, the empty days
the lonely towers of long mistakes
to forgotten faces and faded loves
sitting still was never enough
and if you're giving in, then you're giving up
cause in your sad machines
you'll forever stay
burning up in speed
lost inside the dreams, of teen machines
