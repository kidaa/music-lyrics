listen-wanna just start it...ready, flood
yeah...1, 2, 3, 4 

stay with me, i'll set you free
'cause i can tell you once were pretty
rose so sad you've lost your petals
and lost the luster of your tattle tales 

i need a love to help me find my way
i need a strength that i cannot betray
i need a word to say what i can't say
i need a lover, lover
i need a lover, lover 

what are we waiting for
what are we waiting for
time has lost its hold on me 

hatred sleeps inside my bones
in the stillness of cool air
all the boys have been left for dead
'cause we know where they fear to tread
the beautiful ones, the ones we'll remember
the precious ones, our greatest pretenders 

i need a love to help me find my way
i need a strength that i cannot betray
i need a word to say what i can't say
i need a lover, lover
i need a lover, lover 

and if you lose yourself
could you take me, too
could you rest inside the sleep 

stay with me, i'll set you free from you
