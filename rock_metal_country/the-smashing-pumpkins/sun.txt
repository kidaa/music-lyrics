What it wants is four more years
Moving tears of pain 
Lost I go into your hiding room
You'll be lost to me 

Walking in the sun
I'll never feel the light
Walking in the sun
I'll never feel 

Why Confusion haunts me still
My will can't reign
Lost I go into your hiding room
You'll be lost to me 

Walking in the sun
I'll never feel the light
Walking in the sun
I'll know that I never feel
Walking in the sun
I never feel the light
Walking in my sun
I know that I never feel
