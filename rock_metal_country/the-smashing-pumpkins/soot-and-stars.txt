the words flow, decisions made 
idea's mine, but the inspiration not 
dreams of hangers on, dreams of getting well 
spells of ezmerelda, emeralds foretold 
splinters in the eye sentiments remain 
bones that never rest where we going to 
it was never up to me and yet i pushed until it broke 

i love the open road and all that it suggests 
wheel wagon dust weeds and infidelities and 
always for a love never question why 
in a wooden house immoveable and silent and 
drinking strawberry wine forever lost in town 
and thru the sleeping streets night bound and heavy 
wheels in the spoke still spoken for himself 

now my gates are high, my friends even higher 
forgotten in my mind, yet the sky still linger and 
cloud the blue skies, i'm jealous of you birds 
was the only truth in a world full of words 
hear the prairie sound in a friend called near 
the heart is pointed down but my spirit pointed up 
his voice for siren of greek mythology 

i pause with my pen i begin to defend 
every action taken, every moment sealed 
when i was quick it coursed through open veins 
the will to live the urgency to move 
behind a panel door sealing cherry stain 
i play my guitar and live those lonesome notes 

like a dog that's down 
in a corner just a sigh 
waiting to be called 
waiting to be yours 
ghosts of all my shame 
without purpose or will 

i often speak of you but the you is always me 
cause when i speak of me it's me i ask of you 
so let there be no truth just trickery in rhymes 
time the only thing waiting still as death 

i hope for resolution pray one defining moment 
pause without restrain barren without child 
a child is who i was a child is who i'll die 
soot in my hair 
and stars in my hands 
soot in my hair 
and stars in my hands 
soot in my hair 
and stars in my hands
