i hear your winter
i hear you rain
and i've failed your summer ways
and i feel no pain 

i hear what you want
and i feel that way
i hear what you want
and i feel that way 

i hear you fade away
and i hear you crawl
i gave my life away
and i feel no pain
and i feel no pain
and i feel no pain
and i feel your pain 

and she is my lover so sweet
and she is my angel
and what i've recovered of me
i put into a box underneath my bed 

when you lie in your bed
and you lie to yourself
when you lie in your bed
and you lie to yourself
when you lie
lie, lie, lie 

bang bang you're dead hole in your head
bang bang you're dead hole in your head
bang bang you're dead hole in your head
bang bang you're dead hole in your head
[long silent pause, some applause] 

i hear what you want
and i feel that way
i hear what you want
and i feel that way
