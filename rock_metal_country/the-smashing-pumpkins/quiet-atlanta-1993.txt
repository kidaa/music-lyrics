James: We just flew in from Chicago, and boy are our arms tired. 

quiet
i am sleeping
in here
we need a little hope 

for years
i've been sleeping
helpless
couldn't tell a soul 

be ashamed
of the mess you've made
my eyes never forget, you see
behind me 

silent
metal mercies
castrate
boys to the bone 

jesus
are you listening
up there
to anyone at all 

we are the fossils
the relics of our time
we mutilate the meanings
so they're easy to deny 

be ashamed
of the mess you've made
my eyes never forget, you see
behind me 

quiet
i am sleeping
quiet
i am sleeping
shut up
i don't trust you
i can't hear you 

be ashamed
of the mess you've made
my eyes never forget, you see
behind me 

behind me
the grace of falling snow
cover up everything you know
come save me from the awful sound
of nothing
