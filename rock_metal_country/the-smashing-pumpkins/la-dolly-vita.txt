i lay my head on her bosom
to cry myself to sleep
i see no greater wisdom
than she has given me 

la dolly vita
sweet as true love
la dolly vita
cool as ice cream
cool as ice cream 

you hear a lot of visions
you can't even stop
can't see what you're missing
spinning like a top 

fade away i want to see her
fade away i want to see her
i only want to meet her 

la dolly vita
true as blue sky
la dolly vita
cool as ice cream
cool as ice cream 

take it all the way down
forsake what you have now
take it all the way down
