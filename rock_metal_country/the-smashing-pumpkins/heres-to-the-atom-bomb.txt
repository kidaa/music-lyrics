away to the side you move your head
gravity fingers dig in your back
the strangest man won't let you breathe
rocking on you in a movie scene
his words fill your mouth
his guests bleed sick
devoid of touch
he lets out to the streets where you were raised
sittin' home waiting for the coming age
you had to wait your turn
you had to wait your turn
wake up early, wash up late
satellites connect you to your hate
your patience grows but your skin is thin
the pager signals they're coming in
through the hole in the wall
you left a hole in the wall
here's to the atom bomb
may everyone find a way to get on
[] seven is all you seek
in the same old re-run week after week
their faces make you want to kill
their little piece of heaven singing on the window sill
no lights can turn you on
pixelate the night
feed in the words
of your eyes on the streets where you were born
sittin' home waiting for the coming dawn
you're the hole in the wall
you left a hole in the wall

[Machina II version]

clung to the sweater from the day you were born
never knew better, that's what you swore
mother hugged you cause the walls were thin
in saturnine sweetness and ratio
no boy could spell you out
in the grass at night
beneath the stars
you grew right past the streets where you were raised
sneaking out early to a secret place
like a hole in the wall
like a hole in the wall
into the bed you hang your sleep
watch your man as he sinks beneath
you cut out his heart and watch him die
so we can know you and that you're alive
as the hole in the wall
you are the hole in the wall
noone can know your soul
kisses and noise
now you belong to them all
awake to the dawn and scratch your eyes
light the prayer candles that you remind to
send you a boy that you could waste
a little piece of heaven to set you straight
through the hole in the wall
you are the hole in the wall
noone could tell you why
the tape's full of hiss
and sons who cry
to the night of the dead and the wishing ghost
beating on you to drain morose
through the hole in the wall
we are the holes in the wall
we are the [cut off vocals]
