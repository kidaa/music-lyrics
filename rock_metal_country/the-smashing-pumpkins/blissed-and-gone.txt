the sun has blessed 
the rays are gone
and all the kids have left their tears and gone home

sweet 17, sour 29
and i can't explain myself 
what i'd hoped to find
you were all so kind
when i was near

and if you're still feeling down
then maybe i need me around
to love and hold you 
don't say i hadn't told you so
maybe i need me around

i had no luck
i had no shame
i had no cause just 17 days of rain
and you in my eyes

just one more song to slay this earth
and i can't explain myself
just what it's worth
it was all i had but not all i need
and i can't escape the fact that i still bleed

and if you're still feeling down
then maybe i need me around
to let them scold you
and don't say i hadn't told you so 
maybe i need me around

i had no voice
i had no drive
i had no choice
i've done my time
i had my self
i had my band
i had my love
and i had no hand
in watching it all fall apart

and if you're still feeling down
then maybe you need me around
to love and hold you
don't say i hadn't told you so
maybe i need me around
