We watch the children playing 
Beside the christmas tree 
The presents are wrapped up 
It's beautiful and secretly the gifts still hide 
The fun awaits for you inside

Christmastime has come 
There'll be toys for everyone 
Cause christmastime has come for you

I remember dreaming 
Wishing hoping praying for this day 
Now i sit and watch them 
The little ones i love so excited by the wait 

Christmastime has come 
There'll be toys for everyone 
Cause christmastime has come for you

And now the word is given 
It's time to peek inside 
It's time to let the toys out 
So anxious for your look of joy and delight 
Waiting for just your surprise

Christmastime has come 
There'll be toys for everyone 
Cause christmastime has come for you
