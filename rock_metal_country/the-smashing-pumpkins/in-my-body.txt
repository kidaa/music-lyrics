hold silent
you were my violent stow
in my life
just for the moment
and then the young die
so you can die
I was alive
I was alive
in my body
you'll never find me
you'll never pull me in
in my body
the lonely creatures
the lonely creatures scream
june's outcast
left hiding, their bone sleeps
burned alive
wasted sunsets
haunted my tunnel light
right through my clothes
in my body
you'll never find me
you'll never pull me in
I was alive
I was alive
in my body
you'll never find me
you'll never pull me in
in my body
the lonely creatures
the lonely creatures scream
in my body
in my body
in my body
in my body
in my body
in my body
in my body
in my body
in my body
