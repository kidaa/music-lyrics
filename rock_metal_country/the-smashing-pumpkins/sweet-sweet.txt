Sweet sweet sweet sweet little agony
I don't know just where you've been
But I'll take take take
All that you have for me
In sin
Where are we going 

And they all want you to change
And they all want you to change

And the sad sad sad
All the sad faces drown
In this town
Where are we going

And they all want you to change
Where are we going
And they all want you to change
Where are we going
