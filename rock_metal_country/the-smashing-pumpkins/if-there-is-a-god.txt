if there is a god
I know he likes to rock
he likes his loud guitars
and his spiders from mars
if there is a god
I know she's watching me
she said she likes what she sees
but there's trouble on the breeze
who are you
this time
are you one of us
flying blind
cause I'm down here throwing stones
while you're so far from home
and if there is a god
you know They're on tv
they're the spies with bedroom eyes
that cower in our skies
who are you
this time
are you one of us
flying blind
cause we're done here throwing stones
while you're so far from home
and if there is a god
if there is a god
