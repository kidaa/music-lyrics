Is everyone afraid?
Is everyone ashamed? 
They're running towards their holes to find out 
Apocalyptic means are lose among our dead 
A message to our friends to get out 
There's wages on this fear 
Oh so clear 
Depends on what you'll pay to hear 

They're bound to kill us all in whitewashed halls 
Their jackals lick their paws 

Please don't stop it's lonely at the top 
These lonely days when will they ever stop? 
This doomsday clock ticking in my heart 
Not broken 

I love life every day 
In each and every way 
Kafka would be proud, to find out 
I'm certain of the end 
It's the means that has me spooked 
It takes an unknown truth to get out 
I'm guessing I'm born free, silly me 
I was meant to beg from my knees 

Please don't stop it's lonely at the top
These lonely days when will they ever stop? 
This doomsday clock ticking in my heart 
These lonely days when will they ever stop? 

We gotta dig in
Gas masks on 
Wait in the sunshine, all bug-eyed 
If this is living? 
Sakes alive! 
Well then they can't win 
No one survives 

Is everyone afraid? 
You should be ashamed 
Apocalyptic screams mean nothing to the dead 
Kissing that 'ol sun to know all there is 
Come on, last call 
You should want it all 

Ah, it's lonely at the top 
These lonely days when will they ever stop 
This doomsday clock ticking in my heart 
These lonely days when will they ever stop 
This ticking in my heart 
Is everyone afraid?
