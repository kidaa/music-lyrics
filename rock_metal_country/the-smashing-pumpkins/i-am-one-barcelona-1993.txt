i am one as you are three
try to find a messiah in your trinity
your city to burn
your city to burn
try to look for something
in your city to burn, you'll burn
am i as i seem
i'm down
down, so down 

time is right for a guiding light
try to turn to reasons in your bitter life
your city will burn
your city will burn
try to look for something
in your city to burn, you'll burn

see you, don't you just want to
see you, i am one
see you, don't you just want to
see you, oh

see you, don't you just want to
see you, i am one
see you, don't you just want to
see you, i am one 

what you want is what you'll get
and that's nothin'
what you want is what you'll get
and that's nothin'
what you want is what you'll get
and what you see is what you want
and what you cannot have is what you desire 

and all i ever wanted was everything
and all i ever wanted was everything
all i ever wanted was everything and all i got was s*** 

nothing can be taken from me that has not already been taken
and there's no stories that can be written that have not already been written oh
and there's no amount of bulls*** [that] can't be stacked high
and there's no amount of daggers that are small enough to pierce your heart 

gimme nothin' 

straight thru the motherf***in' heart
what you want is what you'll get
and that's nothin'
what you want is what you'll get
and that's nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
nada 

gimme nothin' 

straight thru your f***in' heart, nothin'
straight thru your motherf***in' heart nothin'
[Billy spits] 

 kick it down
gimme some quiet
shhhhhhhh...
gimme nothin'
nothin' 

see you, don't you just want to
see you, i am one
see you, don't you just want to
oh
