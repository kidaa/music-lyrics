You know I'm not dead
You know I'm, you know I'm not dead
You know I'm not dead

Now you know where I've been
As you sleep, shine I am
Wear you down patiently
Born of love

You know I'm, you know I'm not dead
I'm just living in my head
Forever waiting on the ways of your desire
You always find your way
And through it all, into us all you move

Forgotten touch
Forbidden thought
We can never have enough

You know I'm not dead
You know I'm, you know I'm not dead
You know I'm not dead

Found below, the creatures scream
Stranglehold of god machines
Begin to tear us out
What is hell

You know I'm, you know I'm not dead
I'm just the tears inside your head
Forever waiting on the ways of your desire
You always find your way
And through it all, into us all you move

Forgotten touch
Forbidden thought
We can never have enough
You know I'm not dead

We all want to hold in the everlasting gaze
Enchanted in the rapture of his sentimental sway
But underneath the wheels lie the skulls of every cog
The fickle fascination of an everlasting god

You know I'm not dead
I'm just living in my head
Forever waiting
Forever waiting a cruel death
You know I'm not dead
I'm just living for myself
Forever waiting

You know I'm not dead
You know I'm not dead
You know I'm not dead
You know I'm not dead
