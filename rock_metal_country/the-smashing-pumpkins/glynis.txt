Here's a name you cannot forget
Her name is Glynis, yes
And with these tears of respect
Conforms a sadness
For anyone who's ever lost
One who's dearest, and the love of a friend 

On our worried knees
Given to all beliefs 
Scarecrows and disease haunt us all
Ooh, bury your heads in the sand
Ooh, bury your heads 

So have we stumbled from grace
Are we being punished for fate
My god is subtle and great
He can't be wounded
By the gossip and the hate of the frightened
Who took their paths on the sand, yeah 

Fear that grips us all
Gives us an awful sound
Can't help anything but ourselves
Ooh, bury your head in the sand
Ooh, bury your head, yeah
Ooh, bury your head 

Ooh, I believe in one love
Ooh, I believe in one love
Ooh, I believe in one love
Yeah, yeah
