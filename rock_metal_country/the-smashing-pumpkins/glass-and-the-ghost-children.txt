To the center of the earth 
Or anywhere god decides 
Full of fever pulling forth 
We hear our call as all 
To the center of the earth 
As if written in 
DNA is reaching out 
To your frequency 
I want to live 
Don't want to die 
I want to live 
I want to try 
All in prayer 
Prayer in all 
All are scared 
Scared of all 
Black rooms are calling 
To men in leather coats 
White labs are cooking up the silver ghost 
The glass migrates under her translucent skin 
And all the spiders wonder what we've got us in 
All is you 
You are all 
All with you 
You in all 
I want to live 
I don't want to die 
I want to live 
I want to try 

So beats the final coda 
Of a vintl storm 
One more cherry cola to lift up her dead arms 
A dream of sot focus sunsets filters thru the din 
We are losing contact as she dials it in 
She can hear glass calling 
Or is it someone that looks like him 
She eyes tv reflection and nods a knowing look 
She says it doesn't matter 
She never liked her looks 
I have seen a thousand fractures 
I have seen everything 
Cause knowing is it's own answer 
Love something in a book 
There's not much left to ponder 
Not much left to cook 
As she counted the spiders 
As they crawled up inside her 
As she counted the spiders 
As they crawled up inside her
