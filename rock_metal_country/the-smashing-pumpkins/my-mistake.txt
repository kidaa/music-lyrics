we're so young 
and we're so dumb 
we don't register calculations 
and if you dare 
and should i care 
i could destroy you 
and take you there 
as the spitfires begin their descent 
and tragic romantic ascent 
my love is one hundred percent 
come back to me, my mistake 
come back to me, my mistake 
come back to me, my mistake 
mistake, it was all my mistake 
so suck me through 
your saliva screws 
and i can't help myself if i don't know 
the flaws in you 
that were equal to 
the mysteries of almost knew 
and i've said this so many, many times 
can't help you out of your mind 
so please don't judge me a time 
come back to me, my mistake 
come back to me, my mistake 
come back to me, my mistake 

and if you pretend 
please try to offend everyone 

we share the same monkey disease 
so give me my grape of peace 
and do what you want as you please 

come back to me, my mistake 
come back to me, my mistake 
come back to me, my mistake
