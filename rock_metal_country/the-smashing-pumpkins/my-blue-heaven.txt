day is ending
words are wending
back to the show 
each little nestling love
night sheds falling
love words calling
what makes the world go 'round
nothing my love when whippoorwills call
the evening is nigh
i hum it to my blue heaven
i turn to the right
 the light
 to my blue heaven
you'll see a smiling face,
a fireplace,
a cozy room
a little nest
that's nestled where the roses bloom
just molly and me
and baby makes three
we're happy in my blue heaven
