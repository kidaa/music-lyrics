wander slow
and your kisses chase
what must I do
if only for your warm embrace
for all maintain
must you conquer pain
and every little spider that crawled up inside her
is waiting for my phone call
and now I remind her
of every single liar
living for the killing stone
white spider
will you crawl
white spider
the end has past
[]
I understand you
I am, I am
know I am
I'm sorry you had to
white spider
gotta get away
to try to stay away
you've gotta fix your gaze
so you're not afraid
you've gotta bide your time
before []
you gotta play the part
before you fall apart
you've gotta walk around
swing your arm around
you've gotta strip your skin
to let them jab it in
I'm gonna take my piece
for my own needs
I'm gonna []
fuck the enemy
I'm gonna sharpen my teeth
[cause there are no rules]
I'm going all around
without []
wander slow
white spider
how did you know this
if only which way to go
white spider
cause now I'm reminded of every single fighter
that's waiting for just what she brings
and every little spider
that crawled up inside her
who's waiting for the phone to ring
white spider
will drain you off
end it all
I may deserve to make the scene
beyond belief

I am the end
a shattering hand
for I am painting
the end is near
I cannot pretend

white spider
how will you crawl
white spider
let it out
white spider
