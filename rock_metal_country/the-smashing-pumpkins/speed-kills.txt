speed kills
but beauty lives forever
speed thrills
but beauty knows your name
I fell ill inside eternal winter, winter
and stood still beside eternal flame
and when I ride
with you tonight
we can move
at the speed of light
with all I'd asked, and all I'd prayed
the last rose of summer would stay
the first time that I ever saw you
crashing hard through days of pain
you were one of god's children
left to cry out in the rain
waiting to be saved again
cause when I ride
with you tonight
we can move
at the speed of light
and all I'd ask, and all I'd pray
the last rose of summer 
the last rose of summer
the last rose of summer is gone
long gone
gone
the last rose of summer is gone
when I ride
with you tonight
we can move at the speed of light
forever young
forever blind
into the stars
we rock tonight
the last rose of summer is gone
the last rose of summer is gone
the last rose of summer is gone
the last rose of summer is gone
the last rose of summer
the last rose of summer
the last rose of summer is gone
