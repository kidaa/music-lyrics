Dad
Dead
Was I ever alive
Fucking makes you alive in one minute
Solctice
I am solctice filled with mercury
Liquid fucked
See right through your heart
Fuck your heart
I am mercury liquid pure
Hot, alive, dead, mucked fish eyes, doe eys
I was born alive
I'll fucking kill you
I'll beat your soft baby head with my own hand
Careful with that baby...
Don't ever say the h word around him
Ashamed
I am ashamed of my name
Say it
I hate the sound of your shit because it means no good
It means cheap, liar, smartass piece of shit
Change it to raygun you fuck
Billy is the loon
I am the loon
I am mars
Billy addly addly addly...
Your name causes shit
While I may be no expert on this reality,
There is no god, but shame
god is hurt, god is cold
Try that once, god is dead
There is not another one
Battle
Cold heart radio
Feedback
The pain
Recurring messages of badness
Recurring living bad dreams at the vortex of lost souls
Wailing lost souls of shame
We are in one hole
Like a cup of mercury phosphate
Brrr
Shuddering around
Taste my shit you wench
Lifting, wailing lost souls who stand a chance
Hot, my eyes darkly gaze and wonder
Do not enter
Why
I was born whole
Fractured, divided, shattered into a billion fragments
A million piece puzzle
A million piece jigsaw puzzle with no this, and no that
