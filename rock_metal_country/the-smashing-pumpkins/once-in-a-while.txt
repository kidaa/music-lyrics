Horses run 
Once in a while for you 

The shades will draw 
Once in a while for you 

Destiny will hide the sense of your time 
Once in a while 
Once in a while for you 

The soldiers will fall 
Once in a while for you 

The shades will crawl 
Once in a while for you 

You'll take the walls 
I will take the new ring 

Once in a while 
Once in a while it's you 
Once in a while it's you 

Once in a while 
You'll make it on your own 
You'll make it so alone 
Feel so alone 

You'll try to care 
Once in a while for me 
And I will be there 
Once in a while 
Once in a while for you 
Once in a while for you 
Once in a while for you
