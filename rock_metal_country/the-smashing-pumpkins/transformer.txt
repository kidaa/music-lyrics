[hit it]
a livewire moves slow 
a transformer always knows
the score is four
leaves you hanging on the floor
for more and less and more of the blame
and she's tired
and she's sick of the same old s***
it's just more of the same old same
i know she wants more and more and more to witness
to lay down and bear true
a cherry onion firefly
tastes sweet and white
as you are blue
knows just what she wants to do
with you below the silver skies
don't hate her because she's undecided
and she's tired
and she's sick of the same old s***
it's just more of the same old same
i know she wants more and more and more to stomach
in honor of her youth
she's not sorry she's happy
sorry she's happy
she's not sorry she's happy
sorry she's happy as a turtle
she's a real live transformer
