Tired eyes
Closed for days
There's no regret
'Cause there's no place
I don't know
What I believe
But if I feel safe
What do I need

A home
A home
A home

Revolution
Revolution
Revolution blues
What will they do
Revolution
Revolution
Revolution blues
What will they do to me
What will they do to me
What will they do to me
What will they do to me

Dulcet tongues
Whisper fast
The future yearns
Right now's the past
Rouse me soon
The end draws nigh
Who's side are you on
Your blood you cannot buy

Revolution
Revolution
Revolution blues
What will they do
Revolution
Revolution
Revolution blues
What will they do to you

Well I
I feel alright
So tonight
I got to ask you why
Why deny it
It's no surprise
I've got to survive

Freedom shines the light ahead
I'll lead the last charge to bed 
I said my last rights
I don't have to run scared no more

Fight 
I wanna fight
I wanna fight a revolution
Tonight
I wanna fight 
I wanna fight a revolution
Tonight
At the light 
At the light
Do you wanna watch me die

Let me be something good
Let me prove something real like I should
Let me embrace every single living thing
Let me be every single moment I ever misunderstood
