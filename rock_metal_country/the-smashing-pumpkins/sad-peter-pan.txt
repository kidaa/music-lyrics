It's the plan of most 
To discover that magnificent ghost 
When did I get perverted 
And my innocent eyes diverted from the view so grand 
Imbued with distractions 
I'm greedy like Senior Babbitt 
I'm just chasing that electric rabbit 
I'm a reluctant rebel 
I just want to be Aaron Neville 
With a crown on my head 
And my denim shirt all dark with sweat 
I'm just pushing the paint around 
On advice from your lying mouth 
You touched me and then you ran 
And left a sad Peter Pan 
All alone and awkward 
But a transformation, I swear it will occur
