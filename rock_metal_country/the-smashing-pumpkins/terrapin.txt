i really love you, and i mean you, 

the star above you, crystal blue
well, oh baby, my hair's on end about you 

i wouldn't see you, and i love to, 
i fly above you, yes i do, 
well, oh baby my hair's on end about you 

floating, bumping, noses dodge a tooth
the fins a luminous
fangs all 'round the clown is dark
below the boulders hiding
all the sunlight's good for us 

cause we're the fishes, and all we do 
the move about is all we do 
well oh baby my hair's on end about you 

i really love you, and i mean you, 
the star above you, crystal blue
well, oh baby, my hair's on end about you
well, oh baby, my hair's on end about you
