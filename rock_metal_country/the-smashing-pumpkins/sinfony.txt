Billy's voice: We used to be a new wave band. But somehow along the way we turned into...a rock band. And I'm not quite sure how it happened except for the fact that maybe we were away from everything that was going on, and the world allowed us the time to find out what we really wanted to do.  
I always wanted to be in a rock band, but I guess maybe at the time that we started the band, I was kind of afraid to play rock music because it wasn't very much in vogue
