life is so strange
when you don't know
how can you tell
where you're going to
you can't be sure
of any situation
something could change
and then you won't know
you ask yourself
where do we go from here
it seems so all too near
just as far beyond as i can see
i still don't know what this all means to me
i have nowhere to go
i don't know what to do
and i don't even know the time of day
i guess it doesn't matter anyway
life is so strange
destination unknown
when you don't know your destination
something could change, it's unknown
and then you won't know
destination unknown
and then i ask myself
when will my time come
has it all been said and done
i know i'll leave when it's my time to go
 what i know
life is so strange
destination unknown
when you don't know your destination
something could change, it's unknown
and then you won't know
destination unknown
life is so strange, life is so strange
