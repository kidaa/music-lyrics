You're an empty promise 
You're an easy chair 
You're the gods forces 
Struck down somewhere 

You're a secret noticed 
You're a mystery sky 
You're a wish floating 
Up to the night 

Medellia of my eyes 
You're the emptiness of I 
You're the reason that I write 
And if you say you will 
I would love you still 

And if I could 
I'd throw away this world 
I'd dress you all in pearls 
I'd give you what you wanted 

You're all I notice 
In a crowded room 
Your vacant motives 
Unmoved, revealed 

Medellia of my eyes 
You're the emptiness of I 
You're the reason that I drive 
And if you say you will 
I would love you still 

And if I just could 
Be anything for you 
Just anyone at all 
Anything that mattered, washed out 

You're the silly reasons 
In a goldfish laugh 
You're the ageless seasons 
At rest, at last
