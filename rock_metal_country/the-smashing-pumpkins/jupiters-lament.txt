Gone, long gone
We can all be gone, gone, gone
Leave this world all wrong, wrong, wrong
Leave it far behind 

And although my secret's gone I'll try to carry on
If I must, I'll get along without you 

Gone, long gone
Leave this world all wrong, wrong, wrong
Beyond the pale beyond the dawn
Free these mortal bonds 
No one knows I can't be wrong
So I'll sing the same old songs
I try to be strong for you 

Why have you left me
Amongst the tall trees
I know I gave her all I have 

And I tied her heart in ribbons
Tied her heart in ribbons
Tied her heart in ribbons and bows 

And I'm gone
Oh yes, I'm gone
And I'm lost without you
I'm lost within you
And I'm gone, so gone, long gone
