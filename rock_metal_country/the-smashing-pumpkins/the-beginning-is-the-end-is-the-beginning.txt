Send a heartbeat to 
The void that cries through you 
Relive the pictures that have come to pass 
For now we stand alone 
The world is lost and blown 
And we are flesh and blood disintegrate 
With no more to hate

Is it bright where you are 
Have the people changed 
Does it make you happy you're so strange 
And in your darkest hour 
I hold secrets flame 
We can watch the world devoured in it's pain

Delivered from the blast 
The last of a line of lasts 
The pale princess of a palace cracked 
And now the kingdom comes 
Crashing down undone 
And I am a master of a nothing place 
Of recoil and grace

Is it bright where you are 
Have the people changed 
Does it make you happy you're so strange 
And in your darkest hour 
I hold secrets flame 
We can watch the world devoured in it's pain

Time has stopped before us 
The sky cannot ignore us 
No one can separate us 
For we are all that is left 
The echo bounces off me 
The shadow lost beside me 
There's no more need to pretend 
Cause now I can begin again

Is it bright where you are 
Have the people changed 
Does it make you happy you're so strange 
And in your darkest hour 
I hold secrets flame 
We can watch the world devoured in it's pain 
Strange 
Strange 
Strange
