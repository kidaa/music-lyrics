Born to please, every simple need
I stand alone in my thoughts indeed
Hate you
For ever making me
I'm in you, I'm your anything 

And I- want you
And I- need you
And all you are is brand new
And I- need you 

Come to me, let me hold you still
I'm so tired, just as tired as you
Take me for anyone but me
All that you feel is never true 

And I- want you
And I- need you
And all you are is brand new
And I- need you 

When you say that you are
Forever my star
I'll never let you go, no, no
I'll never let you know 

Let roar these fears
To the whore of my tears
Pure as a lie, I pour to your eyes
Suck you like the sap from a tree
Honey from the dew, from the bumblebees, yeah yeah 

And I- want you
And I- need you
And all you are is brand new
And I- need you 

When you say that you are
Forever my star
I'll never let you go, no, no
I'll never let you know 

And I- want you
And I- need you
And all you are is brand new
And I- need you
