Hungry, hungry again
Hungry, hungry again
When will it start to sway
When will it start to almost break you
Hungry, hungry again
Hungry, hungry again 

I'll miss you
And I wish you luck
Well, I forgive you
And I don't wish you away, away, away
It'll almost break you
Almost take you
Almost break you
Almost break you up
