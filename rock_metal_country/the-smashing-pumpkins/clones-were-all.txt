i'm a clone, i know i'm fine
i'm one and more are on the way
i'm two, doctor
three's on the line
he'll take incubation another day 

i'm all alone, so are we all
we're all clones
all are one and one are all 

we destroyed the government
we're destroying time
no more problems on the way 

i'm through doctor
we don't need your kind
the other ones
ugly ones
stupid boys
wrong ones 

i'm all alone, so are we all
we're all clones
all are one and one are all 

six is having problems
adjusting to his clone status
got to put him on a shelf
all day long we hear him crying so loud
i just wanna be myself, be myself 

i'm a clone, i know i'm fine
i'm one and more are on the way
i'm two, doctor
three's on the line
he'll take incubation another day 

i'm all alone, so are we all
we destroyed the government
we're destroyed time
no more problems on the way 

i'm through doctor
we don't need your kind
the other ones
ugly ones
stupid boys
wrong ones 

i'm all alone, so are we all
we're all clones
all are one and one are all
i'm all alone, so are we all
