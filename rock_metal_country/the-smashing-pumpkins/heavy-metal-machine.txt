If I were alive 
If I were real 
Would you survive 
What would you feel 
Heavy metal 
Heavy metal machine 
Heavy metal 
Heavy metal machine 
As sentimental 
As our broken dreams 
Let me die 
For rock n' roll 
Let me die 
To save my soul 
Let me die 
Let me die 
Rock n' roll 
Let the world forgive the past 
Let all the girls kiss the boys at last 
Let me go 
Let me go 
Rock n' roll 
Heavy metal 
Heavy metal machine 
Heavy metal 
A heavy metal machine 
We're the metal 
In their metal machines 
Heavy metal 
Heavy metal machine 
If I were dead 
Would my records sell 
Could you even tel 
Is it just as well 
Heavy metal 
Heavy metal machine 
It's elemental 
To all the rust it brings 
Heavy metal 
Heavy metal machine 
Let me die for rock n' roll 
Let me die and save my soul 
Let me go 
Let me go 
Rock n' roll 
Let the world forgive the past 
Let all the girls kiss the boys at last 
Let me go 
Let me go 
Rock n' roll 
Heavy metal 
Heavy metal machine 
Heavy metal 
A heavy metal machine 
We're the metal 
In their droning schemes 
Heavy metal 
Heavy metal machine 
Will I survive 
Is it up to me 
Could you understand 
That it's not yours to keep 
Heavy metal 
Heavy metal machine
