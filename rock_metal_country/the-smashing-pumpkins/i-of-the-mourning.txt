Play my favourite song 
Radio 
Radio 
Radio 
I'm alone 
Radio 
Radio 
Please don't go 
Radio 
I peer thru curtains on empty streets 
Behind a wall of caller i.d. 
No one's out there 
To hear if I care 
About the troubles in the air 
As I of the morning now come 
Pick up where my thoughts left off 
Cause I'm home to die on my own 
As my radio 
Plays my favourite song 
Radio 
Radio 
Radio 
Don't you know 
Radio 
Radio 
That radio 
I'm alone 
I blow the dust off my guitars 
In the attic with the stars 
I read your letters 
To feel better 
My tears upon the fading ink 
As I of the morning now gone 
Pick up where my thoughts left off 
Cause I'm home to die on my own 
As my radio 
Plays my favourite song 
Radio 
Radio 
Radio 
I'm alone 
Radio 
Radio 
Radio 
Please don't go 
I sit in the dark light 
To wait for ghost night 
To bring the past alive 
To make a toast to life 
Cause i have survived 
What is it you want 
What is it you want to change 
What is it you want 
What is it you want to change 
What is it you want to change
