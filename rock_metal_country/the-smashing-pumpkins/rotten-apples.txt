Dirty your face 
With longing and grace, God-given 
Suffer her heart 
And love her when your love goes unrequited 

Where the cool winds blow 
I must surely go 
For my love calls me below to drag her 
from the depths of my soul 

When will I see her again 
The other side of friends 
The darkened claws of death 
The empty breath desire 

Dirty your face 
With longing and grace, God-given 
Suffer her heart 
And love her when your love goes unrequited 

Restless in my speech 
And ruthless in my teach 
So vacant in my breach 
I drive the dirt up her garden 

Sorrow 
She'll never listen again 
No other lovers to bend 
Just rotten apples to eat 
Just letter yellowed distant scorn 

Dirty your face 
With longing and grace, God-given 
Suffer her heart 
And love her when your love goes unrequited 

Life just fades away 
Purity just begs 
Dust to dust, we're wired into sadness
