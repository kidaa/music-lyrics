close your eyes
until the sunlight dies
in your head a thousand stars
through the darkness you can see love light
and if they steal your light
your heart is still in mine 

i want to believe in you and i heard you
your song, you sing, a truth is no other
i want to believe in you, dear 

of someday... 

there's a life i hide
but i try to disguise
and i could take you a million miles away 

i want to believe in you and i heard you
your song, you sing, a truth is no other
i want to believe in you, dear 

on sunday i made amends
of all my mistakes
may godspeed be with you 

and i...
i want to believe in you and i heard you
your song, you sing, a truth is no other
i want to believe in you and i heard you
your song, you sing, a truth is no other
i want to believe in you and i heard you
your song, you sing, a truth, a lover
i want to believe in you and i heard you
your song, you sing, a truth, is no other
i want to believe in you, dear
of someday... 

on sunday i make amends
for all my mistakes
may godspeed be with you
