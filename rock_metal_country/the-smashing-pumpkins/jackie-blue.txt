Ooh-hoo, Jackie Blue
Lives a life from inside of her room
Hides a smile when she's wearing a frown
Ooh, Jackie, your not so down 

You like your life in a free form style
You'll take an inch but you'd love a mile
There never seems to be quite enough
Loving around us when your loving comes 

Ooh-hoo, Jackie Blue
What's a game, ooh, that you never lose
Ask a winner and you'll probably find
Ooh, Jackie they lost you some time 

Don't try tell me that you're not aware
Of what you're doing and that you don't care
You say that it's easy, just a natural thing
Like playing music that you've never seen 

Ooh-hoo, Jackie Blue
Making wishes that never come true
Going places where you've never been
Ooh, Jackie, you've blown it again 

Ooh-hoo, Jackie Blue
Lives a life from inside her room
Makes you think that life is a drag
Ooh, Jackie, what fun you have had
