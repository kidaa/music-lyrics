because you are 
because you are 
because you are 
because you are 
because you are 

i've got the trauma to stay 
because you are 
i scar the stranger betray 
all of my senses ashamed 
i will deny all that i'm afraid 
lies will disguise 
rules of time and endgames 

because you are 
because you are 
because you are 
because you are 
because you are 

i chew the rust off my face 
because you are 
i wipe the stain off my haze 
because you are 
i am released, born of age 
because you are 
i stare inside empty faith 

i will deny all that i'm afraid 
lies will disguise 
rules of time and endgames 
because you are 

because you are 
because you are 
because you are 
because you are 
rinse the scars off my skin 
because you are 
i touch the scars of your skin 
because you are 
i let the travel begin 
because you are 
i let the travel begin 
because you are 
i let the travel begin
