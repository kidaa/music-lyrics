They say that life ain't easy
They'll say your life's a crime
Destroy up all good reason
How I'm alive

They'll say that nothing matters
Not even your will to survive
Of course I love you baby
'Cause I'm alive
Yes, I'm alive

Whenever I call you out
Whenever I draw you round
Whenever is here and now

That's the way my love is
That's the way I care
You should call on me baby
I'm always there for you
Yeah, I'm always there for you

They'll say you'll lose your nerve soon
To claim identity
Disgrace our sacred promise
With no belief
Oh, how I believe in you

That's the way my love is for you
That's the way my love is for you

I feel a coming age now
I feel a dawn in me
A certain sun keeps rising
On my belief in you

That's the way my love is
That's the way I care
You should call on me baby
'Cause I'm always there for you
That's the way my love is
That's the way I care
You should call on me baby
'Cause I'm always there for you
Yeah, I'm always there for you
