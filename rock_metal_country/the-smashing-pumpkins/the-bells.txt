ooh the bells are ringing out
what a sound
ooh the bells are ringing out
what a sound
and i'm in love
the joy of love
the coming of
jesus
jesus
did you call my name
never ever felt afraid
did you hold onto
did you make it thru
you
there's so much doubt in every heart
for all our faults we carry on
jesus
jesus i ran away
i got so scared
i made mistakes
will i hold onto
will i make it thru
ooh the bells are ringing out
what a sound
