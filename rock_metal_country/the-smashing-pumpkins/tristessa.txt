Pledged your faith
My heart embraced
Struggle to renew 

Blurry mind
so hypnotized
Fast enough who

Wonder where you are
Tristessa

Soul takes soul
As I take eye
I will wait for you

Hang on to your life
Tristessa

I love you true
Surely I do
I love you true
Surely I do
Surely I do
Surely I do no

Do you ever wake up and find yourself alone
Do you ever wake far from home
What you believe
You'll wish to recieve
I won't believe in you
Tristessa
