To taste my fear
Summon up your demons, dear
I left you open, wondering
When you lie to break my heart
My dahlia
My dahlia dear
My dahlia
My dahlia dear 

I'll break into
Losing in my choices made
My words
My promise
Say I am
When you lie to break my heart
When you lie I'll break to break
My dahlia
My dahlia dear
My dahlia
My dahlia dear
Anyone can see
You're laughing down at me
It's easy for you now
Means are what we gathered here
I left you open, wondering
When you lie to break my heart
When you lie I'll break to break
My dahlia
My dahlia dear
My dahlia
My dahlia dear
Anyone can see
You're laughing down at me
It's easy for you now
