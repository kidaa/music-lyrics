and i'd love you to notice i'm devoted
to destroy for no one
now it's that time again to take revenge
on all the debutantes and their friends
the bitter charlemanges so self absorbed
the bodily remains such a bore
was i good enough to break you
and all i see is empty
cause now i'm one of them so adored
the slink of impotence that money can afford
we know who you are and where you live
is your innocence all that you can give
was i good enough to break you
in the back of the car the angel dust was given back to the stars
and in this fall from grace
we'll meet again another time another place i've been down deep in you and me
let's see where we can go
angels, barbed wire f*** you, desire
