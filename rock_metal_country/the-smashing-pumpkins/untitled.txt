should I know
what I'm missing
what's to stop
look and listen
feel love
to be in love
around

anyone can hold a promise
not everyone can feel honored
to be in love
to feel love around

suddenly I'm
giving speech
let me be
what I need
if you're enough
for me

many times
while you sleep
I'm dreaming of 
what to keep
you know your wish
hold it true
to slay the things
that trouble you

suddenly I'm
out of reach
listen here
feel me
just believe
just believe
you'll see

to feel love
to be in love
all around

hold the truth
if you want it
if you don't
I will flaunt it
to feel love
to be in love
all around

when you're young
you can promise
anything that you wanted
to be in love
to feel love
around

suddenly I'm
learn to speak
from my heart
I will see
bring happiness
just happiness
for you and me

to feel love
to be in love
around

to be in love
to feel love
around

to feel love
to be in love
around

to be in love
to feel love
around

I know your wish
I hold it true 
feel love all around
to hide the things
that trouble you
feel love all around

suddenly I'm
out of reach
feel love all around
let me speak
of my peace
feel love all around
[draw from me / dropping me]
what you need
feel love all around
you'll never hate
or hurry me
feel love all around

to feel love
to be in love
around
to be in love
to feel love
around
to feel love
to be in love
around
to be in love
to feel love
around
to feel love
to be in love
around
