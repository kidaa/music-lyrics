C'mon let's go
I'll find you waiting there
Beyond their violence dared
A light around your soul

You could be my friend
Lovely and different
Crushing up the stars above us
A guarantee to spoil our rot

Tears were once my only way back home
Someone speaks and instantly I'm cold

C'mon let's go
C'mon let's go
Beyond the great unknown
Beyond their punched-up skulls
To die upon this road

C'mon let's go
C'mon let's go

Anesthetized I'm hollow
Playing to the dark back row

C'mon let's go
Go
C'mon let's go

Assimilate, it's all been staged
I've made mistakes, they penetrate
They're gonna take, it's all the same
They cannot wait, their love spells hate

I wanna love
I wanna love
I'm pushing back
I'm serpentine
I'm pushing back

Lord save me
With need
Lord walk me home

C'mon let's go
C'mon, c'mon let's go

Tears were once my only way back home
Someone weeps and instantly I'm thrown

C'mon let's go
C'mon let's go
Go
C'mon let's go
