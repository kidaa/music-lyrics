pop tart
what's the matter
did you lose what you're after
for your tears I'm still singing
for your fears I am ringing
from Houston on a downer buzz
like you said it's
just because we'll detonate your long lost kisses
wished on the ear of forgotten blesses
start your way for some new impression
try to hold on
for this heart a little bit stronger
try to hold on
to this love alone
try to hold on
for this heart's never been broken
so try to hold on
try to hold on
pop tart
did you flatter
when they spoke
of my disasters
at thirteen I lost my compass
but I'm sure it's all accomplished
as desires burn my ghost trains
like you said
when it rains it pours down the back of a bitter sun
desperate for love and loves everyone
in my mother's arms no simple harm
conspires to hold on
for this heart
a little bit closer
try to hold on
to this love alone
try to hold on
and we know if we go under
we just can't let go
no no
pop tart
will it matter
if I lose and just shatter
will you cry and keep crying will I die and keep dying in Tokyo with sad tragic blues like you said it's how you use, cause someday we'll know if this even matters
our rings and maze and simplicity
when can we laugh and take all the credit
and know we'll go free
with our hearts a little bit stronger
try to hold on
to this love alone
try to hold on
for this heart's a little bit frightened
just try to hold on
just try to hold on
just try
