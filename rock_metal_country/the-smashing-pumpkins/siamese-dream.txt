Coming down
From my Siamese Dream
All we know
Is silent to the dream
Motherf***ers try to crack your crown
Break you up and suck you out
Scoop you up like a little fish
Make you wish for more than this 

Coming down
From my Siamese Dream
All we know
Well, it's silent to the dream
Motherf***ers try to crack your crown
Break you up and suck you out
Scoop you up like a little fish
And make you wish for more than this
And you come
And you come
And you come
