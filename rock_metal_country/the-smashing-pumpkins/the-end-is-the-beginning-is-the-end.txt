The sewer belched me up
The heavens spit me out
From ethers tragic I am born again
And now I'm with you now
Inside your world of woe
To move in 
Insides made
Of deadly
Pretence
Till the endtimes begin

Is it bright where you are
Have the people changed
Does it make you happy you're so sane
And in your darkest hour
My whole secret's fake
You can watch the world devoured in it's pain
Yeah 

Climb my ribcage to
The replays run for you
Unhook my lights to peek behind the flesh
For I am crystal chrome
And I am shattered, no
And I am practicing
Of angels of death
To destroy the end 

Is it bright where you are
Have the people changed
Does it make you happy you're so sane
And in your darkest hour
My whole secret's fake
You can watch the world devoured in it's pain

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 

The zeppelins rain upon us
The guns of love disastrous
A shadow lies amongst you
To defy the future hell

Is it bright where you are
Have the people changed
Does it make you happy you're so sane
And in your darkest hour
My whole secret's fake
You can watch the world devoured in it's pain
