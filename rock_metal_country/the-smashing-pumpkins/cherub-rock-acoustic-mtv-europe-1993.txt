freak out
give in
doesn't matter what you believe in
stay cool
and be somebody's fool this year
'cause they know
who is righteous, what is bold
so i'm told 

who wants honey
as long as there's some money
who wants that honey 

hipsters unite
come align for the big fight to rock for you
but beware
all those angels with there wings glued on
'cause deep down
we are frightened and we're scared
if you don't stare 

who wants honey
as long as there's some money
who wants that honey 

let me out
let me out
let me out
let me out
woo! uh-huh 

tell me all of your secrets
cannot help but believe this is true
tell me all of your secrets
i know, i know, i know,
should have listened when i was told 

who wants honey
as long as there is some money
who wants that honey 

let me out
let me out
let me out
let me out
