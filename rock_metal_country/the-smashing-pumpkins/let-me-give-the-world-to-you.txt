Last chance to make believe in always and all it seems 
Train wrecks hide underneath your umbrella 
Set the frame 
Destiny on this last name siloque 
Tired symphonies play down on 

Let me give the world to you my love 
Let me give the world to you my love
Let me show what I'm thinking of 
Let me give the world to you my love 

so far, so far, so far 

Lovers form dead excuse 
And Blur the lines with sold abuse 
While lonesome hearts just have no use around here 

New skin may hold you in
But the old skin turns us on 
Flicker-fades the nitrate down to [] 

Let me give the world to you my love 
Let me show you what I'm thinking of
Times are hard and we're the last in line 
Cause in my grief I've forgotten what was mine 

No, I wouldn't change a thing 
No, I, I
I wouldn't change a thing 
About the way you are 
The distance here, speak so far, so far, so far, so far 

Let me give the world to you my love 
Let me give the world to you my love 
Let me give the world to you
Let me give the world to you 
Let me give the world to you
Let me give the world to you
Let me give the world to you my love 
so far, so far, so far
