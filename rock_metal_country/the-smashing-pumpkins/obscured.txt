lost your head, now you sleep on the floor 
what you said, i don't want anymore 
through the haze, make your eyes up to ache 
out in space, days away 

through these eyes 
i rely on all i've seen 
obscured 
through these eyes 
it looks like i'm home tonight 

left for dead as you sweep out the cold 
things we said we don't need anymore 
tale inside her like a fallen kite 
hey, hey, yeah 

through these eyes 
i deny on all i see 
obscured 
through these eyes 
it looks like i'm home tonight 

what you said made a mess of me 
what you said, i don't want 
obscured
