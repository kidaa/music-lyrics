you can hear the baby bones
crack beneath her wheels
tears of avalon
streak silent down her shield
high crimes and misdemeanors
unfortunate attacks
will leave you standing nameless
while she's turning back
vanity stands naked at my door
vanity cries, why
Elenore you've lost me
in a haze of wine and cocaine
gone and cost me everything I blame
broadcast in tv detail
to call their own stories
as I try to recapture
our best in former glories
vanity stands naked at my door
vanity cries, why
vanity wants everything and more
vanity must die
she swears she'll turn around
turn around for good
she swears she'll turn around
turn around for sure
you'll know you'll run around
run around for her
you know you want it all so pure
he's on that dirt road
you've still got ways to go
soak in sights and city lights
while you still can borrow
curse fall will find you
and bring a memory
the ghost of her surrender
and a kiss of anarchy
she's naked at my door
vanity cries, why
vanity wants everything and more
vanity must die
die
die
