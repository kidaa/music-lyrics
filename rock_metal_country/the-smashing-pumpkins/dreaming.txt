when i met you in the restaurant you could tell i was no debutante
you asked me what's my pleasure, a movie or a measure
i'll have a cup of tea and tell you of my dreaming
dreaming is free
i don't want to live on charity
pleasure's real, or is it fantasy
reel to reel is living rarity
people stop and stare at me
we just walk on by
we just keep on dreaming
feet feet, walking a two mile
meet meet, meet me at the turnstile
i never met him, i'll never forget him
dream dream, even for a little while
dream dream, filling up an idle hour
fade away, radiate
i sit by and watch the river flow
i sit by and watch the traffic go
imagine something of your very own,
something you can have and hold
i'd build a road in gold just to have some dreaming
dreaming is free
