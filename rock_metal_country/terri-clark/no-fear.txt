I want a road stretching out before me
I want a radio in my ear
I want a full tank of absolution
No Fear.

I want a rainstorm to pull me over
Then a sky that begins to clear
Towards the truest of destinations
No Fear.

Chorus:
I used to hit every wall there was
I used to run away from love
All I ever wanted was right here
But I had to reach way down inside
I had to have faith I'd find
No Fear.

I want the world to just keep on turning
I want the dawn in my rear view mirror
I want to hear my own voice singing
No Fear.

And when I need two arms around me
And there's no one near
When I'm alone let the only sound be
No Fear.

Repeat chorus

I want peace, love and understanding
A stogie and an ice-cold beer
Don't want to live afraid of dying

I used to hit every wall there was
I used to run away from love
All I ever wanted was right here
But I had to reach way down inside

I used to stay up all night long
Wondering what I was doing wrong
All I ever needed was right here
But I had to reach way down inside
I had to have faith I'd find
No Fear.
