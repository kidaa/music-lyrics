Do you get the feeling 
Even when you're not alone 
There's a memory 
making itself at home 
And it don't let loose no matter what you do 
That's me not loving you 

Lately you are sleeping 
And you've got the window closed 
Yet there's a crack somewhere 
Cause you can feel the cold wind blow 
And it gets to you, no matter what you do 
That's me not loving you 

Didn't I tell you when you left 
You never would forget the love you could have kept 
Now every night in your empty room 
The only thing you're holding is the truth 
If you hear a heartbeat
Where there really should be two 
That's me not loving you When all you hear is silence 
Then you'll know the voice is mine 
If the phone don't ring 
And the bell don't chime 
And that someone new, you'll never get used to 
Well that's me not loving you 

Didn't I tell you when you left 
You never would forget the love you could have kept 
Now every night in your empty room 
The only thing you're holding is the truth 
If you hear a heartbeat
Where there really should be two 
That's me not loving you
