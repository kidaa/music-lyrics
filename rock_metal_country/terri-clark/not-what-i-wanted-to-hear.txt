For two weeks I ain't heard the phone ring
Just a warning bell
My friends tell me they know things
I should know as well
I can't deny it
I've been told
A voice inside
Says let you go

But that's not what I wanted to hear
Not what I wanted my heart to say to me
That you'd be long gone
Before too long
And that's not what I wanted to see
'Cause nobody wants to believe they could be so wrong
But one thing is clear
It's what I needed to know
But, oh-it's not what I wanted to hear

Sometimes my intuition
Can get carried away
But right now I'd better listen
To what it has to say
'Cause when I tried to
Believe you're mine
I just got silence
Every timeAnd that's not what I wanted to hear
Not what I wanted my heart to say to me
That you'd be long gone
Before too long
And that's not what I wanted to see
'Cause nobody wants to believe they could be so wrong
But one thing is clear
It's what I needed to know
But, oh-it's not what I wanted to hear

But that's not what I wanted to hear
Not what I wanted my heart to say to me
That you'd be long gone
Before too long
And that's not what I wanted to see
'Cause nobody wants to believe they could be so wrong
But one thing is clear
It's what I needed to know
But, oh-it's not what I wanted to hear

Oh-it's not what I wanted to hear
