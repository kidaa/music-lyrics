Mary Chapin Carpenter/Kim Richey
Last thing I wanted was
Someone who wants me so much
I don't like nobody leaning on me
Last thing I needed was
Somebody hanging around because
In their eyes I am something to see

Like a hole in my head, like a rock in my shoe
Like an ache in my heart when I think of you
Last thing I wanted
Last thing I wanted was you

Last thing I thought I'd do
Was open my heart to you
I got good reasons for keeping it closed
Last place I thought I'd be
Was here with you next to me
'Cause I'm used to sleeping aloneLike a hole in my head, like a rock in my shoe
Like an ache in my heart when I think of you
Last thing I wanted
Last thing I wanted was you

Sometimes what we want
Aint what we need, maybe
Baby I need you

Like a hole in my head, like a rock in my shoe
Like an ache in my heart when I think of you
Last thing I wanted
Last thing I wanted was you
