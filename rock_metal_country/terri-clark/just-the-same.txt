You could've walked along a back road
Or on a lonely stretch of beach
You could have sat there on a park bench
A Sunday paper at your feet
If you'd been waiting for a taxi
Or at a bus stop in the rain
I would've found you, I would've found you
Just the same

You know you could've been a gambler
Whose luck was running low
Or just another drifter
Without a single place to go
You could have been a broken dreamer
Without a penny to your name
I would've loved you, I would have loved you
Just the same

No it really didn't matter
Who you'd been or what you'd done
Where we met or when it happened
You'd still be the oneThere's no way to know the future
But one thing will never change
I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you
Just the same

I'd gonna love you, I'm gonna love you
Just the same
