After all was said and done
There was nothing left to do
The hardest mile I ever walked
Was the one I walked away form you
So maybe I'm a little ragged around the edges
And I've been keeping a little more to myself these days but

I'm alright
Shot down but I'm still standing
I'm alright
A little banged up from the fall
But I'm alright
Still shaky from the landing
I'm alright, after all

You know it's really not that bad
No matter how bad it might feel
Causse there ain't nothing time won't fix
This ain't nothing that some time won't heal
So maybe I've been walking a little wounded
I move a little bit slower not but that's okay 'cause...

I'm alright
Shot down but I'm still standing
I'm alright
A little banged up from the fall
But I'm alright
Still shaky from the landing
I'm alright, after all

And every now and then I think about you
Oh, every now and then I coss the line

I'm alright
Shot down but I'm still standing
I'm alright
A little banged up from the fall
But I'm alright
Still shaky from the landing
I'm alright, after all

I'm alright, after all
