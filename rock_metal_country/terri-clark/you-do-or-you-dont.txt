Come on darlin' get down off that fence
Don't even try and make it make sense
It's got nothin' to do with your mind
Take a leap of faith this time

Tell me what you're feelin' deep in your heart
Love ain't followed by a question mark
It should be simple, should be easy
We're not talkin' brain surgery
You do or you don't, you do or you don't
You do or you don't love me

You can make a list of pros and cons
Check 'em all off baby one by one
But all I really wanna know tonight
Is are you always gonna want me in your lifeTell me what you're feelin' deep in your heart
Love ain't followed by a question mark
It should be simple, should be easy
We're not talkin' brain surgery
You do or you don't, you do or you don't
You do or you don't love me

Tell me what you're feelin' deep in your heart
Love ain't followed by a question mark
It should be simple, should be easy
We're not talkin' brain surgery
You do or you don't, you do or you don't
You do or you don't love me
