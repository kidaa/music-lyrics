Every time you ask her out she turns you down
You've seen a tear roll down her cheek
When she thinks no one's around
You don't know what's going on
But you know there's something wrong
Well, it don't take much to figure this one out

Any woman who's been hurt by a man understands
It'll take some time for her to find a way to love again
She may be crying but she's trying to do the best she can
Just ask any woman who's been hurt by a man

She lies in bed with questions on her mind
Was she so wrong about him and is she gonna be all right
The night can be so cold
When a memory's all you hold
Yeah, I know what shes going through tonight, 'cause...

Any woman who's been hurt by a man understands
It'll take some time for her to find a way to love again
She may be crying but she's trying to do the best she can
Just ask any woman who's been hurt by a man

Her broken heart
Will come around
She just needs a chance to heal right now

Any woman who's been hurt by a man understands
It'll take some time for her to find a way to love again
She may be crying but she's trying to do the best she can
Just ask any woman who's been hurt by a man

Just ask any woman who's been hurt by a man
