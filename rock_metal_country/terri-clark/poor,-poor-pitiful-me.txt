Warren Zevon
Well, I lay my head on the railroad track
Waitin' on the ";double e";
But the train don't run through here no more
Poor, poor pitiful me!

Chorusbr>
Poor, poor pitiful me!
Poor, poor pitiful me!
Oh, these boys won't let me be
Lord have mercy on me!
Woe, woe is me!

Well, I met a man out in Hollywood
And I ain't namin' names
But he really worked me over good
Just like Jesse James

Yes, he really worked me over good
He was a credit to his gender
He put me through some changes
Lord, sorta like a waring blenderRepeat Chorus

Well, I met a boy in the Vieux-Carres
Down in Yokahoma
He picked me up and he threw me down
Sayin', ";please don't hurt me, mama";

Repeat Chorus

Poor, poor pitiful me!
Poor, poor pitiful me...
