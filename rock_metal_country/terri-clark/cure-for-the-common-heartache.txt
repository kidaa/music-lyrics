This morning I'm aching all over 
Can't eat, can't sleep, can't rest 
Oh I need to go see a doctor 
For this achin down deep in my chest 

Is there a cure 
For the common Heartache 
An unknown prescription 
Any loser can take 
I'd be the first to become addicted 
If there's a cure 
For the common heartache 

I know right where I got it 
This sickness that's got me laid up 
I don't have the strength now to fight it 
This old condition called love Is there a cure 
For the common Heartache 
An unknown prescription 
Any loser can take 
I'd be the first to become addicted 
If there's a cure 
For the common heartache 

Is there a cure 
For the Common Heartache
