Don't worry baby
About that man at the bar that I just talked to
It's been so long I can't recall his name
Well he's just somebody
Who could never make me feel the way that you do
He's just an old neon flame

Well he shines bright on a Friday night
But he burns out about daylight
And he's always hanging where the jukebox plays
He ain't nothing to me
Just a dance or two before you even knew me
He's just an old neon flame

Give me a quarter
And I'll pick out a number that's a slow one
And tonight we'll start a fire we can't contain
His heart's a cold one
And I think I've been around enough to know one
He's just an old neon flameWell he shines bright on a Friday night
But he burns out about daylight
And he's always hanging where the jukebox plays
He ain't nothing to me
Just a dance or two before you even knew me
He's just an old neon flame

Oh, honey, he's just an old neon flame
