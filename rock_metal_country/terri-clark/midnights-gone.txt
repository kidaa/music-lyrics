We got our first McDonald's
And it made the headline news
In a town where no one locks their doors at night
All the lights are flashing yellow
We just roll right through
And there is not a superstore in sight
But there's more to life
I told myself I'd say good-bye
By the time the clock struck twelve

But I can't pull the trigger on that changing world out there
With all these dreams I can't believe I'm still standing here
It's time to face the fact that I'm not the rebel that I thought
'Cause midnights gone but I'm not

Everyone I run into
Has known me all my life
There are no secrets you can call your own
Since the age of seventeen
I've faced the morning light
Saying this day is the day I'm gonna go
All I have to do is drive away
But the things that make me crazy
Always make me stay

But I can't pull the trigger on that changing world out there
With all these dreams I can't believe I'm still standing here
It's time to face the fact that I'm not the rebel that I thought
'Cause midnights gone but I'm not

It's time to face the fact I'm not the rebel that I thought
'Cause midnights gone, midnights gone
but I'm not
