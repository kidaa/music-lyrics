You sit in silence in the shadows
You don't complain or criticize
And while the world may see me as a fool
They're not looking through your eyes
No questions asked, you're there when I need you
With a love that inspires me to be everything you deserve

'Cause you're my unsung hero
And I know it's not easy to walk in your shoes
Day after day youcontinue to amaze me
Now I sing this song of love for you

While others long to steal the spotlight
You work your magic quietly
Cause you're not in it for the glory
The love you give comes naturally
I may not have much, but what I have I give to you
And this song that I sing is my gift
And I swear that I mean every word

'Cause you're my unsung hero
And I know it's not easy to walk in your shoes
Day after day youcontinue to amaze me
Now I sing this song of love for you

'Cause you're my unsung hero
And I know it's not easy to walk in your shoes
Day after day youcontinue to amaze me
Now I sing this song of love for you

Now I sing this song of love
For you
