I've got an ice-cold cup of coffee
And a paper I haven't read
A canyon in my heart
And a hammer in my head
And a waitress with an empty stare
That looks right through me.

I'm sitting at this table
And I'm balancing the salt
Weighing out my choices
Baby, it's nobody's fault
And I'm torn up by these voices
Talking to me.

You say there's no good reason
For me to walk away
You say there's so much good between us
Who wouldn't want to stay
But how can I be with you
If deep down I believe I'll lose a part of me.

Chorus:
Sometimes goodbye is the only open door
I can't turn back when I know there's something more
I gotta find what my heart beats for.

I've got a half a page of reasons
And a napkin full of tears
From trying to pull my spirit
Through the pocket of my fears
As the lunch crowd empties out
Into the city.

And there may not be a way for me
to make you understand
I'll write down the words I'm feeling
And I'll leave it in your hands
But the memories of our love
I'm taking with me.

You say there's no good reason
For me to walk away
You say we're meant to be together
And I'm making a mistake
But this emptiness inside me
Has brought me to this road and I have to let you go.

Repeat Chorus

For the passion everlasting
For the deepest dream
For a chance to love like that
There is no in between.

Repeat Chorus
