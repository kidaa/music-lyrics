If this ole heart 
Was built like a truck 
These Rocky ole roads wouldn't be so rough 
And if it ever broke down I'd patch it up 
If this ole heart was built like a truck 


If this ole heart was made like a train 
A lot of smoke and steel, wouldn't feel no pain 
And it wouldn't look back as it rolled away 
If this ole heart was made like a train 

But this ole heart is flesh and blood 
Gets in trouble when it cares too much 
Keeps hangin' on when it ought to give up 
On somethin that's passed 
I wish it had wheels and I wish it had wings 
Cause I could sure use just one of those things 
Then this danged ole fallin' out of love wouldn't hurt so bad
But this ole heart ain't made like that 

If this ole heart was like an ole tin roof 
Beatin' by the rain, wheathered and used 
A fresh coat of paint would make it good as new 
If this ole heart was like an ole tin roof 

But this ole heart is flesh and blood 
Gets in trouble when it cares too much 
Keeps hangin' on when it ought to give up 
On somethin that's passed 
I wish it had wheels and I wish it had wings 
Cause I could sure use just one of those things 
Then this danged ole fallin' out of love wouldn't hurt so bad
But this ole heart ain't made like that
