Everything's right until the chorus...

You're easy on the eyes 
Hard on the heart
You look so good but the way things look
Ain't the way they are 
Better say good-bye before this goes too far
Now I realize you're easy on the eyes 
Hard on the heart

Not ";we go"; but ";this goes"; and not ";cause";, not anything

Have a great day!
