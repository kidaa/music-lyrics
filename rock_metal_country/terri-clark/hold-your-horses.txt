Carl Jackson/Pam Gadd
Well you thundered into my life like a steed out of control
Tried to rope my heart and tie me down with a little band of gold
And I hate to break your spirit 'cause I know your mind is set
Well you may be but I ain't ready yet

Hold your horses, you're steppin' outta line
Like a team of untamed stallions tramplin' on 
This heart of mine
I'm no good beneath the reins, used to makin' my own choices
Hold your horses

I don't mean to act so skittish but when it comes to changin' names
There's a mighty sense of freedom still a rushin' through my veins
And your urgent need to settle down has got me runnin' scared
'Cause I ain't quite ready for the rocking chair

Hold your horses, you're steppin' outta line
Like a team of untamed stallions tramplin' on 
This heart of mine
I'm no good beneath the reins, used to makin' my own choices
Hold your horses

Hold your horses, you're steppin' outta line
Like a team of untamed stallions tramplin' on 
This heart of mine
I'm no good beneath the reins, used to makin' my own choices
Hold your horses
Hold your horses...
