Maybe it's been a little too long
Holding it in, trying to be strong
Funny the things we bottle up
Come streaming out when you feel enough
There is a trust the cautious will lack
Now that we've touched, there's no holding back

I want to call out for love 'til I can't breathe
I want to stare at the truth 'til I can' see
I want to pour out my soul 'til I'm Empty
Empty

When only flesh and bone remain
I'll hold you close, then start again
Feeling nothing but a sweet release
When the ghosts are gone from inside of me

I've tried to fight it but what can I do
There's something deeper that surrenders to youI want to call out for love 'til I can't breathe
I want to stare at the truth 'til I can't see
I want to pour out my soul' til I'm Empty
Empty

When I touch you, When I hear you
How can I doubt when everytime I'm near you

I want to call out for love 'til I can't breathe
I want to stare at the truth 'til I can't see
I want to pour out my soul 'til I'm Empty
Empty
Empty
