Terri Clark
I woke up at 3 am 
And stumbled in the dark 
I don't sleep much anyway 
Since we've been apart 
But that's just one of many things 
I've adjusted to so well 
Cause I surrendered long ago 
And now finally I can tell 

I'm getting used to 
Not getting over you 
Not wondering how to shake 
A hurt that won't go away 
Not knowing where to turn 
Is something I thought I'd never learn 
It's really nothing new 
I'm just getting used to not getting over you 

I head down highway 40 
Past the place we used to go 
I don't stop to cry anymore 
I just drive by real slow 
And I don't feel the dagger 
When somebody speaks your name 
I guess that I'm just growing more 
Accustomed to the pain I'm getting used to 
Not getting over you 
Not wondering how to shake 
A hurt that won't go away 
Not knowing where to turn 
Is something I thought I'd never learn 
It's really nothing new 
I'm just getting used to not getting over you 

Not knowing where to turn 
Is something I thought I'd never learn 
It's really nothing new 
I'm just getting used to not getting over you 
A feeling I can't lose 
I'm just getting used to not getting over you
