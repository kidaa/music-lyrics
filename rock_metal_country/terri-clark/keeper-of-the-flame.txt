Terri Clark
We pass in the hallway
I stop to kiss you on the cheek
But you're in a hurry
You've got a deadline you must meet
You're working so much these days
You don't have time to spend with me
But I keep hoping we might get back
To the way love used to be

I am the keeper of the flame
You only helped me build the fire
And it's getting harder every day
To make our love burn with desire
'Cause If I left it up to you
Only ashes would remain
When it needs shelter from the rain
I am the keeper of the flame

We live here together
But I feel we're worlds apart
When I tell you I love you
You never listen with your heart
I may look like I'm doing fine
But I'm dying deep inside
'Cause I've done all that I can do
To try and keep this love aliveI am the keeper of the flame
You only helped me build the fire
And it's getting harder every day
To make our love burn with desire
'Cause If I left it up to you
Only ashes would remain
When it needs shelter from the rain
I am the keeper of the flame

Oh, when it needs shelter from the rain
I am the keeper of the flame
