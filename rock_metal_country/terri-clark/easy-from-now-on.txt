There he goes, gone again
Same old story's gotta come to an end
Lovin' him was a one-way street
But I'm getting off where the crossroads meet

A quarter moon in a ten-cent town
Time for me to lay my heartaches down
Saturday night and I'm gonna make myself a name
Take a month of Sundays to try and explain

Chorus: It's gonna be easy to fill the heart of a thirsty woman
Harder to kill the ghost of a no-good man
And I'll be ridin' high in a fandangled sky
It's gonna be easy
It's gonna be Easy From Now On

Raw as the wind, but clean as bone
Soft to the touch when you take me home
When the morning comes and it's time for me to leave
Don't worry about me 'cause I got a wild card up my sleeve

Chorus: It's gonna be easy to fill the heart of a thirsty woman
Harder to kill the ghost of a no-good man
And I'll be ridin' high in a fandangled sky
It's gonna be easy
It's gonna be Easy From Now On
