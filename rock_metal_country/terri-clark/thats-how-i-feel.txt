What's going on in your head
You haven't heard a word I've said
I think we need to talk
Cause you turn your emotions off
And that's something I don't understand

'Cause that's how I feel
With my heart
Every beat, every part
Way down deep
In my soul
I live and breathe to let you know
That's how I feel

You think the silence buys you time
To make things clearer in your mind
But I can't live in the dark
Not knowing who you are
So tell me how you feel insideThat's how I feel
With my heart
Every beat, every part
Way down deep in my soul
I live and breathe to let you know
That's how I feel

That's how I get to know you
If you'll only let it go you'll
Find it's not as scary as it seems

That's how I feel
With my heart
Every beat, every part
Way down deep in my soul
I live and breathe to let you know
That's how I feel
