Tom Shapiro/Terri Clark/Chris Waters
Somebody's restless
She feels second best
And the girl across town
Is thinking about a permanent change
And the lady living next door
Won't take it anymore
There's a whole lot of love
Gone wrong going 'round these days

Must be something in the water
Something in the air
'Cause every girl I talk to
Is going through the same thing
I'm going through here
Must be something in the teardrops
They've been falling too long
Must be something in the water
Making me wanna move on

I understand the heartache
It leaves such a bitter taste
Makes you go crazy
Thirsty for something else
The way that it used to be
Now ain't enough for me
'Cause the love I ain't getting
Is like drinking from a dry wellMust be something in the water
Something in the air
'Cause every girl I talk to
Is going through the same thing
I'm going through here
Must be something in the teardrops
They've been falling too long
Must be something in the water
Making me wanna move on

Must be something in the water
Something in the air
'Cause every girl I talk to
Is going through the same thing
I'm going through here
Must be something in the teardrops
They've been falling too long
Must be something in the water
Making me wanna move on
