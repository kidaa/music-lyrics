There's a place I'm going to 
Where I'll be over you 
And I'm gonna go till I get there 
Long as the road don't run out 
Long as my heart don't let me down 
I'll keep the wheels turning 'round 
Till I get there 

I don't know when I don't know how 
But I'm finding my freedome 
And that's somewhere I've never gone 
Through these tears, I see now 
It's gonna take leavin' 
For me to know where I belong 

There's a place I'm going to 
Where I'll be over you 
And I'm gonna go till I get there 
Long as the road don't run out 
Long as my heart don't let me down 
I'll keep the wheels turning 'round 
Till I get there It's just beyond the edge of my sorrow 
I'll turn the key and I'll be on my way 
With the help of my old friend tomorrow 
I'm gonna put a million miles on yesterday 


There's a place I'm going to 
Where I'll be over you 
And I'm gonna go till I get there 
Long as the road don't run out 
Long as my heart don't let me down 
I'll keep the wheels turning 'round 
Till I get there
