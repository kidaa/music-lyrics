Well the sun sets in the west
But as fast as you go, how would you know
You're a busy boy, I guess
Who just wants the gold at the end of the road
Think of all you miss
Passing through like this

Chorus: You want an answer as soon as you say a prayer
You want to land the moment you're in the air
Baby the living is all in the Getting There

Don't be the first in every line
Now and then you can be at the end
'Cause there's only so much time
And you can't get back every minute you spend
You're not even sure
What you're running for

Chorus: You want an answer as soon as you say a prayer
You want to land the moment you're in the air
Baby the living is all in the Getting ThereThink of all you miss
Passing through like this

Chorus:  You want an answer as soon as you say a prayer
You want to land the moment you're in the air
Baby the living is all in the Getting There

The living is all in the Getting There
Getting There
