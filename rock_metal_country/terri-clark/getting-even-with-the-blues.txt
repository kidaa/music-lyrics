I think I'm gonna smile for a while 
Pull the curtain back and let some moonlight in 
Gossip on the phone with my old friends 
Like I used to do 

I'm gonna put your memory away 
Show this achin in my heart a thing or two 
Cause tonight I'm getting even with the blues 

That lonely feelings had it's way 
Ever since the day I heard you say goodbye 
The hurting thinks its found a home 
But I'm gonna let it know it ain't welcome here tonight 

Tomorrow that old cloud may come around 
And there won't be anything that I can do 
But tonight I'm getting even with the blues 

That lonely feelings had it's way 
Ever since the day I heard you say goodbye 
The hurting thinks its found a home 
But I'm gonna let it know it ain't welcome here tonight 

Tomorrow that old cloud may come around 
And there won't be anything that I can do 
But tonight I'm getting even with the blues 
Oh, tonight I'm getting even with the blues
