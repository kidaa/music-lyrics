Rick Bowles/Terri Clark/ Chris Waters
I've been looking at you looking me
Bet you're thinking that what you get
Is what you see
But underneath this cool exterior
A raging river flows
So before you get any nearer
I better let you know

Chorus:
I'm an emotional girl
I can't help myself
Sometimes I laugh
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I do both and I don't know why
I got a Passionate heart
And that's just the way things are
You and me could give it a whirl
But I'm warning you, boy
I'm an emotional girl

I like music that's loud and lights down low
I like driving my car too fast
And dancing slow
Some folks may say I'm too extreme
'Cause I can't stop once I start
But I never could do anything
With half my heart

Repeat ChorusInstrumental Break

Repeat Chorus

You and me could give it a whirl
But I'm warning you, boy
I'm an emotional girl
