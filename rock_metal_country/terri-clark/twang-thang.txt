Tom Shapiro/Terri Clark/Chris Waters
A beer stain on a jukebox
A tractor in a field
Fireflies on a screen door
A home cooked meal
Rolling down a dirt road
Listening to a George Strait song
If it ain't pure and simple
It ain't gonna turn me on

It's gotta have a twang thang
It's gotta bend a heart strang
Like a scuffed up boot
Or a boy with two first names
I gotta feel a deep pang
When I hear the songs they sang
If it don't kick up a little dust
It ain't got much of a twa-ang thang

If I tried to describe it
Well, I don't think I could
It's like swimming in a cold creek
'Cause it just feels good
No matter where you find it
There's a down home quality
It ain't sophisticated
And that's just fine with meIt's gotta have a twang thang
It's gotta bend a heart strang
Like a scuffed up boot
Or a boy with two first names
I gotta feel a deep pang
When I hear the songs they sang
If it don't kick up a little dust
It ain't got much of a twa-ang thang

It's gotta have a twang thang
It's gotta bend a heart strang
Like a scuffed up boot
Or a boy with two first names
I gotta feel a deep pang
When I hear the songs they sang
If it don't kick up a little dust
It ain't got much of a twa-ang thang

If it don't kick up a little dust
It ain't got much of a twa-ang thang
