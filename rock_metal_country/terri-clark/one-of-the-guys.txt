Hood up, bent over that carborator
I skinned my knuckle
Damn that hurt
Got a 6 pack chillin' on ice for later
And grease all over my white t-shirt

My brother taught me how
To throw a curve ball
The cheerleadin' thing never felt quite right
When it comes to high fashion
I hit a brick wall
This girl's just one of the guys

You can dress me up
But it won't change
The way i walk against the grain
I can rock your world
And if my mood is right
You can take me home
But i'm gonna drive
'cause this girls just one of the guys

I can throw darts
Talk about fishin'
Tell a dirty joke
And watch nascar
I can help you with your love life
And tell you 'bout women
Drink you under the table
At your favorite bar

You can dress me up
But it won't change
The way i walk against the grain
I can rock your world
And if my mood is right
You can take me home
But i'm gonna drive
'cause this girls just one of the guys

I'm still a lady
Lookin' for the right man
But he's gotta take me
Just the way i am

'cause you can dress me up
But it won't change
The way i walk against the grain
I can rock your world
And if my mood is right
After the game on monday night
'cause this girl's just one of the guys
Yeah this girl's just one of the guys

Hey... Woa!
