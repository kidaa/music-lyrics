Jann Arden Richards/Robert Foster
I've got money in my pocket
I like the color of my hair
I've got a friend who loves me
Got a house, I've got a car
I've got a good mother
And her voice is what keeps me here
Feet on ground
Heart in hand
Facing forward
Be yourself
I've never wanted anything
Oh I've never wanted anything
So bad...so bad
Cardboard masks of all the people
I've been thrown out with all the rusted, tangled dented worn-out miseries
You could say I'm hard to hold
But if you knew me you'd know
I've got a good father
And his strength is what makes me cry
Feet on ground
Heart in hand
Facing forward
Be yourself
I've never wanted anything
Oh I've never wanted anything so bad
I've got money in my pocket
I like the color of my hair
I've got a friend who loves me
Got a house, I've got a car
I've got a good mother
And her voice is what keeps me here
Feet on ground
Heart in hand
Facing forward
Be yourself
Heart in hand
Feet on ground
Facing forward
Be yourself
Just be yourself
Just be yourself
