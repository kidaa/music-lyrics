Oh-Oh
Ohhhh
Oh, Oh-Oh
Ohhhh
Oh-Oh
Ohhhh
Oh, Oh-Oh

Rhiad and the bedouins
Got a plan and walk right in
But I don't feel that ???? from them
That I-am-crazy

Oh, my salvation
Oh, my frustrations
Caught in the lies
No one I love is there
Somewhere in time
When will I, get there?
Ohhhh

Ohhhh
Oh-Oh
Ohhhh
Oh, Oh-Oh

Rhiad and the bedouins 
So that's the world ????
But anybody ????
Who can't blame me?
Half the time they're bedouins
Nomads and/or Aryans
You'll never take me

Oh, my salvation
Oh, my frustrations
Caught in the lies
No one I love is there
Somewhere in time
People will like me there

Oh, sweet salvation
Oh, my frustrations
Caught in the lies
If you ignore this world
Somewhere in time
When will I, get there?
Ohhhh

Ohhhh
Oh-Oh
Ohhhh
Oh, Oh-Oh
Ohhhh
Oh-Oh
Ohhhh
Oh, Oh-Oh

Oh, my salvation
Oh, my frustrations
Caught in the lies
If you ignore this world
Somewhere in time
People will like me there
Ohhhh

Oh-Oh, Oh
Oh-Oh, Oh
Oh-Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh-Oh, Oh-Oh, Oh-Oh, Oh-Oh, Oh
Oh-Oh, Oh-Oh, Oh-Oh, Oh-Oh, Oh
