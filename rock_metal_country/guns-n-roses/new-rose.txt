[spoken]
Is she really going out with him

Hey!

I got a feeling inside of me
It's kinda strange like a stormy sea
I don't know why, don't know why
These kind of things gotta be

[CHORUS:]

I got a new rose, I got it good
Yes, I knew that I always would
I can't stop to mess around
I got a brand new rose in town

See the sun, see the sunny skies
Don't get too close it'll burn your eyes
Don't you run away that way
Come back another day

[CHORUS]

I never thought this could happen to me
I'm a strange washing machine
I never served somebody this sane
I haven't met her, maybe too late

Hey!

I got a feeling inside of me
It's kinda strange like a stormy sea
I don't know why, I don't know why
I guess these things've gotta be

[CHORUS]
