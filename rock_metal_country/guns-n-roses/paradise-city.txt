Take me down to the paradise city 
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home

Take me down to the paradise city 
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home Oh, won't you please take me home

Just an urchin livin' under the street, hard case that's tough to beat
I'm your charity case, so buy me somethin' to eat, I'll pay you at another time
Take it to the end of the line

Ragz to richez or so they say, ya gotta-keep pushin' for the fortune and fame
It's all a gamble when it's just a game, ya treat it like a capital crime
Everybody's doing their time

Take me down to the paradise city 
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home

Take me down to the paradise city 
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty

Strapped in the chair of the city's gas chamber
Why I'm here I can't quite remember
The surgeon general says it's hazardous to breathe
I'd have another cigarette but I can't see
Tell me who you're gonna believe

Take me down to the paradise city 
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home, yeah

Take me down to the paradise city 
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home

So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away

Captain America's been torn apart
Now he's a court jester with a broken heart
He said- turn me around and take me back to the start
I must be losin' my mind-  quot;Are you blind quot;
I've seen it all a million times

Take me down to the paradise city 
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home

Take me down to the paradise city 
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home

Take me down to the paradise city 
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home

Take me down to the paradise city 
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home Oh, won't you please take me home

Oh I wanna go, I wanna go, oh won't you please take me home
Oh won't you please take me home

Take me down to the paradise city 
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home

Oh, won't you please take me home
