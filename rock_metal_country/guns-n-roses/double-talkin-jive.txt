Found a head and an arm in da garbage can, don't know why I'm here
Livin' on the run for oh so long, I gotta go collect
Double talkin' jive, get the money motherfucker 'cause I got no more patience
Double talkin', I got lies, no more patience man

Back in town an'a all new friends, they sayin' how ya been
Fucked up and outta place, that's how I felt back then
Double talkin' jive, get the money motherfucker 'cause I got no more patience
Double talkin', I got lies, no more patience man
You dig what I'm sayin'!
