Ready
It's A Whole Different Beast
1, 2, 3, 4
1, 2, 3, 4 kazoo madness
Oh yeeeahh
Oh yeeeeeeahh

Well if you don't like it
Go ahead find yourself a saint
Go ahead now try to find a boy
Who's gonna be what I ain't

What you need is a plastic doll
With a fresh coat of paint
Who's gonna sit through all the madness
And always act so quaint
I said - a, oh yeah, well - a

It's your new friend
You're really 
Making a scene, and I've seen you 
Bouncing around, from machine to machine
But you know that

They're never really
Never really what they seem
And you can count on
Generate some warmth, then you'll
See just what I mean
Oh baby, baby, baby yeah 

[CHORUS:]

And if I'm acting like a king
Don't ya know it's cos uh I'm a human being
And if I want too many things
Don't ya know it's cos I'm a human being
And if I've got to dream
Don't ya know it's cos I'm a human being
And when it gets a bit obscene
Don't ya know it's cos I'm a human being
I don't gotta walk around with my head on down
Just like a human... oh no a human being
I can hold my head so high
Just like a human
A real proud human being

Won't you give me a little sip
Why won't you give me a drag of that cigarette
Why don't you try to give me something 
That I'll never ever forget, but now 
Could you blow it all
On a million dollar bet
Because you're liable to lose it
On a best lovin' you've had yet
Oh baby baby, oh yeah

[CHORUS]

It's like I'm talkin' 'bout the human race
You're tryin' to cover up a big disgrace
Oh baby, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, come on, come on, come on

Well I may think that 
This whole scene is just a too appalling for me
Well, I may be the type who's just mad about
Funny little thing that I see, but I can
Colour that with history, and make it
Just what I want it to be, well I'm
Blowin' my change on the fan magazines
With all the Hollywood refugees
Oh baby baby oh yeah

[CHORUS]
