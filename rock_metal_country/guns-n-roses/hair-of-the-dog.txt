[spoken]
Give me a little bit of volume on this

You're a heart-breakin' soul shaker
I've been told about you
I've seen y'on the midnight show girl
A-what they been sayin' must be true

Red hot mama
There'll be trouble
I say time's gonna pay your dues

[CHORUS:]

Now you're messin' with a A SON OF A BITCH
Now you're messin' with a son of a bitch
Now you're messin' with a A SON OF A BITCH
Now you're messin' with a son of a bitch

Talkin' jive and poison ivy
You ain't gonna cling to me
Man take a bold thinker
I ain't so blind I can't see

Red hot mama
There'll be trouble
I say time's gonna pay your dues

[CHORUS]

[CHORUS x 5]
