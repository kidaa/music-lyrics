If we could see tomorrow what of your plans
No one can live in sorrow, ask all your friends
Times that you took in stride, they're back in demand
I was the one who's washing blood off your hands

Don't you cry tonight, I still love you baby, don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight, there's a heaven above you baby
And don't you cry tonight

I know the things you wanted, they're not what you have
With all the people talkin', it's drivin' you mad
If I was standin' by you, how would you feel
Knowing your love's decided and all love is real

And don't you cry tonight, don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight there's a heaven above you baby
And don't you cry tonight

I thought I could live in your world as years all went by
With all the voices I've heard something has died
And when you're in need of someone, my heart won't deny you
So many seem so lonely with no one left to cry to baby

And don't you cry tonight and don't you cry tonight
And don't you cry tonight, there's a heaven above you baby
And don't you cry, don't you ever cry, don't you cry tonight
Baby maybe someday, don't you cry, don't you ever cry
Don't you cry tonight
