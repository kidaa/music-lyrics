Told you once about your friends and neighbors
They were always seeking but they'll never find
That it's alright, yes it's alright

Where to go, Where to see
It's always been that way and it can never be
but it's alright, yes its alright

Give it all and ask for no return
And very soon you'll see and you'll begin to learn
that it's alright, yes it's alright
