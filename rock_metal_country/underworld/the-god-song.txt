Catch the beat out-o-on the street Oh no-no! 
Another visionary slick solution 
Strap on a gun, start a revolution 
Another brilliant master plan 

In from the street, mouth sat in a seat No-no! 
He point the finger at the whole world out there 
Beat the drum - for Mr Accusation 
The hypocritical superman 

Sing hallelujah o-e-o 
Sing hallelujah yea-yea-yea-yea 

The man got a plan, got a plan, got a plan yea 
He call love 
The man got a plan, got a plan, got a plan yea 
He call L-O-V-E 

Catch the beat out-o-on the street Oh no-no! 
I hear political resolutions 
Cast the vote - launch another scape goat 
Into the bosom of the promised land 
Stand and fight, kill for what is right Oh no-no! 
Justify another execution 
Try me on build another big one 
And we can celebrate the final plan 

Sing hallelujah o-e-o 
Sing hallelujah yea-yea-yea-yea 

The man got a plan, got a plan, got a plan yea 
He call love 
The man got a plan, got a plan, got a plan yea 
He call L-O-V-E 

Sing hallelujah o-e-o 
Sing hallelujah yea-yea-yea-yea 

The man got a plan, got a plan, got a plan yea 
He call love 
The man got a plan, got a plan yea 
He call L-O-V-E
