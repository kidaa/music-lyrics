everything...
i'm invisible...
an eraser of love...
why dont you call me i feel like flying in two...
i'm invisible...
an eraser of love...
why dont you call me i feel like flying in two...
an eraser of love...

i don't dream. ice cream. i scream so much.
you know what i mean. this electric stream.
and my tears in league with the wires and energy and my machine.
this is my beautiful dream.
i'm hurting no one. hurting no one...
i want to give you everything.
i want to give you energy. i want to give a good thing.
i want to give you everything. everything...
in one final scream of love who could climb this high she looks beautiful
like a child i feel tears. and i want to scream.
you know what i mean cause this is hurting no one. an erazor of love.

hurt. the necessary feeling.

why dont you call me i feel like flying in two...
an erazor of love.
