Come with me 
To the bright white flame 
That you knew by name 
And you will again 

Take my hand 
We're getting out of here 
No more time for tears 
For the wasted years 

No more crumble in the night 
No more tears on an empty pillow 
Voices out of sight cryin' hard - runnin' scared 
No more tears in the gloom 
No more gurus that I just can't follow 
Older than a heart beat 
Older than the sun 

If I die before I go this is the way 
Older than a heartbeat 
Older than the sun 

And hands 
How she loved those hands 
Now she could not stand 
To be near that man 

So she turned 
To the bright white flame 
That she knew by name 
Now there'd be no pain 

I am the river that goes on and one 
On into the sea 
It carries you away
