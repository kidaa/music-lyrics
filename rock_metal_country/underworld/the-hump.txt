to be rounded up for treason

are you ready to give up allright 
are you ready to keep hanging on 
are you ready for a puppet 
to deliver us some peaces 
are you ready for a carrot 
are you ready for a jesus 

are you ready for the acid 
are you ready for the alkaline 
are you ready for the ecstasy 
are you ready the bottom line 
are you ready for the way out 
are you looking for a way back in 
are you ready for the phone to ring 
are you ready to try anything
