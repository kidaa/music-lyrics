Rocket collecting dust
Hidden from all memory
Bathed in outrage and rust
Waiting for you and me
To own it
Watch you as you douse the ceiling
Light up all the evil dreams
Till they ignite screaming into the night
And we run away clean 

Chorus:
I wish i was half electronic
The last shreds of skin are in the sweet sunlight
And i've turned into this smiling, snarling monster
As i watch the walls descend
As i watch the walls descend like stars 

Half submersed
I reach your island at night
Washed up tangled on these stones
A gorgeous wreck crashing
To lay here for the next 600 years
The storm will play out there for miles on every side
So tell me who's got the dominoes
But you'll have to leave your lightning outside 

Chorus:

the weeds reach the top of the trees
