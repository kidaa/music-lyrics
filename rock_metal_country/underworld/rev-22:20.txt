Don't be aroused
By my confession
Unless you don't give a good goddamn about redemption
I know
Christ is coming
And so am I
You would too if the sexy devil caught your eye
She'll suck you dry
Soon you'll cry
To be back in her bosom
To do it again
She'll make you weep
And moan and cry
To be back in her bosom
To do it again
Pray  shall I go blind?
Pray  cos nobody ever survives
Praying to stay in your arms
Just until I can die a little longer
Saviors and saints
Devils and demons alike
She'll eat you alive
Jesus is risen
It's no surprise 
Even he would
Martyr his momma 
To ride to hell between those thighs 
The pressure is building
At the base of my spine 
If I gotta sin to see her again
Then I'm gonna lie and lie and lie
She'll make you cry 
I'll sell my soul
To be back in your bosom 
And gladly help
Please suck me dry 
And still you'll cry
To be back in her bosom 
Do it again
Pray  shall I go blind?
Pray  cos nobody ever survives
Praying to stay in your arms
Just until I can die a little longer
Saviors and saints
Devils and demons alike
She'll eat you alive
My pulse has been rising
My temples are burning
The pressure is so overwhelming and building 
So steady and heavy
I'm ready to blow 
She waits, what is she waiting for?
Pray  shall I go blind?
Pray  cos nobody ever survives
Praying to stay in your arms
Just until I can die a little longer
Saviors and saints
Devils and demons alike
She'll eat you alive
