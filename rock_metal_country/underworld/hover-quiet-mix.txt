To see you leave again, it's over
And it kills me to watch you descend, to the end
Shutting me out again
Are you trying?
Closing me out again
Are you hurting?
You take me down
Further inside of me
Now I'm fading out
I can barely see
To see you caving in, I'm undone
And to say it's the last time again, it's the end
Shutting me out again
Are you trying?
Closing me out again
Are you hurting?
You take me down
Further inside of me
Now I'm fading out
I can barely see
