her sky wings... 

I'm
havin a winj-  a winjer 

today

today

I could be a downer about anything 

I'm a winjer 

havin' a winj- 

everything

everything looks miserable 

when you're a winjer 

opinions enter the house of flame 

when you're a winjer 

I'm havin' a laugh 

I'm havinalaugh 

with the roof off 

and the sunlit 

take your top off 
take your 
take your top off 
			you look happy now 
			you look happy now 

good spikes 

havinalaugh

warm grass around you 
warm grass around you 

warm grass around you 

I'm a winjer 

today could be a downer 

I could be a downer 

about anything 

everything looks miserable 

when you're a winjer 

I'm
I'm I'm
I'm havin a laugh 

with the roof off 

and the sunlit 

take your top off 
take your top off 

			you look warm in the night 

follows the road 

warm grass around you 
warm grass around you
