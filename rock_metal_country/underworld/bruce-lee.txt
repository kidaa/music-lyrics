                                 from the box... 

skin taught as sails in a gale, hair always cut with a blunt tool, 
muscular but thin like springs for not steel...four thin old men, four 
thin old men lay silent in two vaporizing rooms, each way up in his 
own head...holed up in his flat, flaking boxers...little piggy, little 
eyes...folds the skin just enough to let in light...bullet got the wrong 
bloke, but they don't die anyway...it's nothing mortal if you don't 
move...still have slopped up the war in a proper blanket...and i have 
been this way for days

...wrong bloke... 
...force the gun... 
...old man, come up to the bed... 
...deliberate, and sturdy... 
...holds the pistol to the chest of the wrong bloke... 
...pulls the trigger... 
...a turning shot... 
...before your head... 
...slaps you in the side of the face like a circus clown... 
...wrong bloke... 
...it's out of his eyes now... 
...strains to get something in his head... 
...has to see what is in the air...
