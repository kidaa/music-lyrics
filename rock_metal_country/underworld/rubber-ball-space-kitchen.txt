I'm a rubber ball 
Victims of success 
We all are... 

Blackbird sittin' at the kitchen door 
Don't give him bread he'll come back for more 
Point to the bush where the berry grow 
Rub your belly and touch your toes 

We are strong 
We're invincible 
We are driven snow in the face of all 
We are strong 
We're invincible 
We're a rubber ball 

Blackbird shackled in a golden cage 
Mother nature she shake with rage 
Well he was born with his 
And I was born with mine 
And there is still a dividing line 
Says we are strong 
We're invincible 
And we are driven snow 
In the face of all 
We are strong 
We're invincible 
And we're a rubber ball 

Who says we are strong 
And we're invincible 
And we are driven snow...?
