[Worms of the earth]
[ Worms of the universe]

Gentlemen our faith is wounded
And yes, we are wounded too
They've come out from the swamp
But we, we stand on both legs
They will roll over and over and over again
Another lonely pacifist, lying in the sun
There is no ground control
[Mayday!?]

Breathe not a word of this
Quiet, quiet confidence
The time has to come to face this
We all must bear witness
The war will roll over and over and over again

Another lonely pacifist, dying in the sun
I will not watch this
I will not watch this all come down

Careful, boy.
Careful.

[I never thought that you could've been a monster]
