Dear God
Broken life
Come on
Laugh this time

She stares. Forever in death and ever again
Come on. Forward. Smile. Tricks and trade 
She stares. She'll cut her again, cut again

Dear God
Broken life
Come on
Laugh this...

Silence tells us what they are. Silence tells us what they are
She's up and gone and done it again. Jimmy's got a new gun in his hand
She's up and gone and done it again. Jimmy's got a new gun in his hand
You're being a liar. You're being a liar. 
You're being a liar. You're being a liar.
How could you doubt? He would never find out
You're being a liar. Let's start the show. 
You're being a liar. I'm ready to go.
You're being a liar. You're being a liar. 
You're being a liar. You're being a liar.
How could you doubt? He would never find out
You're being a liar. Let's start the show. 
You're being a liar. I'm ready to go.
The emperor is dead. The emperor is dead. 
Goodbye. Don't cry.
Die. So long. Revenge. Defend. 
You know we brought the crowd to us

Staking time into the gust of wind to the face. 
Never returning, favors take the prison to the man.
I could promise the world if we could travel through time.
Don't back out here. Now relax and remember the promise of the sign. 
I wish you could see yourself now...you look at me like a child...
The way you glide across the room, it's drama of seduction. 
Let go of it, Repunsel. Let it down. 
Aim for the signal then bring it down with a smile....now...
Become the conductor...
The way you slide across the room...how wonderful. 
A connection and the last cut still bleeds as good as the first one does.
It?s just the opening seed of a new flame.
I look at you like a child but not at all like you looked at me...

The price is already paid. Now is the time to go back. Face what you've done
You should never said 'Yes'.
The price is already paid. Now is the time to go back. Face what you've done
The price is already paid. 
The price is already paid. Now is the time to go back. Face the master.
You should never have said 'Yes' when you really mean 'No.?
