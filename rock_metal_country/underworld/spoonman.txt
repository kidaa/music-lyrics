watched you cry. watched you fly. watched you die...

i'm the spoonman.

don't put your hand where you wouldn't put your face 
she said a dollar rubber rat utah plates brilliant green substance 
unknown with a face like a peeled onion sheep in drag horseback automatic 
to make your home clean make it sani-flush 
she said now im a new skin-free crispy with this urge 
to phone into the nosmoking zone of stainless steel tokyo 
me and big white dog got to hijack pecan tarts for babylon bambi 
out of mercer street where the crackheads catwalk charity 
where teenage sex rides a stoned rhythm trading its chiliskins 
to the screamers come to hunt their meat to the gold diggers in kissboots 
and the recycled blondes in their stack heeled snatches the monster trucks 
the rolling rocks the poodle boys with their little bone diggers 
and dark stuff comes oozing out the apple core tonight like a beggars dog 
tasting the wind.
into the blood...
