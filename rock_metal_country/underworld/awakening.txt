Out of control of a history untold 
It begins with the father of sin 
I walk alone in the garden of stones 
I turn into the monster within 
Life is too long for me  
Life is too wrong for me  

Cause there's something that 
I realize 
That I miss being human 
I realize 
That I miss being human 
Nothing Times

I lose control as the story unfolds
I have been like a knife to bare skin
I walk alone like a king with no throne
I burn up from the monster within
Life is too long for me
Life is too wrong for me

Cause there's something that 
I realize 
That I miss being human
I realize
That I miss being human 
Nothing Times

I like hunting the pieces
I like hunting the pieces
I like hunting the pieces
Cause I have come to need this
I like hunting the pieces
I like hunting the pieces 
Cause I have come to need this
Shell

Cause there's something that
I realize
That I miss being human
Cause there's something that
I realize
That I miss being human
I teach lies
That I miss being human
I teach lies
That I miss being human
I teach lies
