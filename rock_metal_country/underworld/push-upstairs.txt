ah, Tina lives in Berlin her voice so seldom on my machine 
Is here tonight and I'm on the market and when I'm on the market words move faster 
Wire and clouds move thin between us 
Like a skin like a salty skin for a seed of fat circles 
Smiling smiling her voice so intentionally smiling 
In the clouds between us 

These are my intentions 

Pushin...

Push

Ah...

Through the club a blonde is carryin somethin is carryin me 
I'm someone I used to be a grey plastic someone blue plastic 
Girl your cream is pushin pushin and 

Pushin...
Pushed away 
Your body is-a pushin... 
Pushed away 
Come before the unbelieve 

Carryin some lipstick for the boyfriend blonde 
Between the rolls of sheets is professionally poised 
The faces are watching her 
She's watchin the faces watchin her 

Pushin...
Push
Pushin
Push

Love

Ah
