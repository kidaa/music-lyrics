And the Earth spins round
While the people fall down
And the world stands still
Not a sound, not a sound
There is love, there is love
To be found
In the worst way, in the worst way
In the worst way

It's the buzz, it's the buzz
It's the buzz
It's the buzz, it's the buzz
I wish I was
It's the buzz, it's the buzz
It's the most fuzz
From a little shell
At the bottom of the sea
Was the Earth and the Moon
And the Sun above me
But the world fell down
With some people still around
There is love, there is love
To be found
With the Gods all gone
And the souls making sounds
In the worst way, in the worst way
In the worst way
It's the buzz, it's the buzz
It's the buzz
It's the buzz, it's the buzz
I wish I was
It's the buzz, it's the buzz
It's the most fuzz
From a little shell
At the bottom of the sea
Was the Earth and the Moon
And the Sun around me
There is love, there is love
There is love
It's a buzz, it's a buzz
It's a buzz
It's the buzz, it's the buzz
I wish I was
It's a buzz, it's a buzz
It's a buzz
