wrapped up in moon river then beyond the blinds 
and the new white sliding into the city tunnel 
beneath the feet of the people in the city roamin'

crossway boy

downtown waterfront boy in the shadows 
of the she's on the phone

and the girls are up to something animal 
boything up on the roof again

and the nights with the boyfriend 
and the city loves you

everyone is smiling 
the smiling is pushing it around

like the shadows of evolution in the dark 
super boys where time is all 
and where time is everything 
where time is started 
time to earth 
earth wind and fire 
and the sun in your hair 
black metal walls are falling 
i'm the hunger 
i'm metal 
i'm stainless 
i'm milk in your plastic 
i'm left alone in a full moon with the only thing 
i can do is lie awake on the floor 
at night the doors are i can't awake 
i can't awake 
ah ah ah ah 
the water into you to me constantly 
constantly 
without 
without 
without 
without again 
without again 
your telephone number through a glass of water 
the door between is opened 
the silence is different 
love

walks with the boyfriend the city 
loves the boyfriend friends walking 
friends walking with the boyfriend the city loves 
the boyfriend everybody loves 
the boyfriend you left me alone

boys down on the waterfront.
