I used to love you 
I fought for your selection 
To be a target 
For your weapon of affection 
I was a dog for you 
You put your marker on me 
But my soul was not for sale 
And you tried to take it from me 

But - Hey now now 
Hey now now 
I know what you're doin' 
You pushed me too far 
And if you want me back! 
Want me back 
You better - 

Call me number one 
Head man here 
The original son 
Baby 
Hey, hey hey 
Call me number one 
Head man here 
The original son 
Baby 
Hey, hey, baby! 

You were the fire 
I was just the piston 
You were the planet 
At the centre of my system 
Your love is terminal 
And I let you give it to me 
Your love's a juggernaut 
And you tried to drive it through me 

Call me number one 
Head man here 
The original son 
Baby 
Hey, hey hey 
Call me number one 
Head man here 
The original son 
Baby 
Hey, hey, baby!
