your rails. you're thin. 
your thin paper wings. 
your thin paper wings. 
in the wind. dangling. 
your sun. fly high. 
your window shattering. 
your rails. you're thin. 
your thin paper wings. 

sugar box. sugar boy. 
riding in. riding in. 
sugar box. sugar boy. 
handheld candle. sugar boy. 
your rails. you're thin. 
your thin paper wings. 
your thin paper wings. 
in the wind. dangling. 
your sun. fly high. 
your window shattered in the wind. 
your coca cola sign rattling. 

resonator. 
homeless trees. gathering. 
outside your window bootleg babies call 
to you and lie among the mosquitoes. 
that summers fever coming. 
cats are gathering outside your window. 
homeless trees. bootleg babies calling 
to you. lie among. lie among the mosquitoes. 

your rails. you're thin. 
your thin paper wings. 
get up in your sun. fly high. 
dangling. dangling. 
your window shattered in the wind. 
the sun on your coca cola sign. 
your rails. your thin 
paper wings. paper wings. 

resonator ... 

there is a sound on the other side of this wall. 
a bird is singing on the other side of this glass. 
footsteps. concealed. 
silence is preserving a voice. 
walking in the wind at the waters edge 
comes close to covering my rubber feet. 
listening to the barbed wire hanging. 
there is a sound on the other side of this wall. 
a bird is singing on the other side of this glass. 
footsteps. concealed. 
silence is preserving a voice. 
silver chain. thrown away. broken wing.
