do you still feed the animal? 

yourmuffledvoice

and the wires come in 

open eyes   close us 
			slide beneath the city 
slide beneath the city 
and the feet in the streets above us 
			and your voice again 
and your voice again 
			and your voice again 
			and your voice again 

I don't want you to call again 

do you still feed the animal? 

muffled madness

I couldn't go through this again 

you say you love her 
		you know you love her 
			you never want to be without her 

you say you never want to hurt her 
		you know you hurt her 

how many lives you've lived 
how many hurts you've done 
how many times you've come to this place 
		how much you want it 

you say you love her 

do you-
