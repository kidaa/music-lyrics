It's been a long day at the bottom of the hill,
she died of a broken heart.
She told me I was living in the past,
drinking from a broken glass.

Chorus

I'm alone [I never wanna be alone],
now I [now I] try to face the cold.
I'm alone [I never wanna be alone],
now I [now I] try to travel home.

I walked down to the other end of the day,
just to catch those last few waves.
I held out my hand and slowly waved goodbye,
I turned now my eyes up to the sky.

Chorus

She'll come back to me. [She'll come back to me]
She'll come back to me. [She'll come back to me]
All alone in this mystery.
She'll come back to me.

I held out my hands into the light and I watched it die,
I know that I was part to play.
My god, my time to die.
Never want to spend my life alone.

Chorus
