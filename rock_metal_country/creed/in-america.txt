Only in America
We're slaves to be free
Only in America we kill the unborn
To make ends meet
Only in America
Sexuality is democracy
Only in America we stamp our god
"In God We Trust"

What is right or wrong
I don't know who to believe in
My soul sings a different song
In America
What is right or wrong
I don't know who to believe in
My soul sings a different song
In America, In America, In America

Church bell's ringing
Pass the plate around
The choir is singing
As their leader falls to the ground
Please mister prophet man
Tell me which way to go
I gave my last dollar
Can I still come to your show

What is right or wrong
I don't know who to believe in
My soul sings a different song
In America
What is right or wrong
I don't know who to believe in
My soul sings a different song
In America, In America, In America, In America

I am right and you are wrong
I am right and you are wrong
I am right and you are wrong
No one's right and no one's wrong
In America, In America, In America, In America 

What is right or wrong
I don't know who to believe in
My soul sings a different song
In America, In America 

What is right or wrong
I don't know who to believe in
My soul sings a different song
In America, In America, 
What is right for you and me
In America
