The dust has finally settled on the field of Human Clay 
Just enough light has shown through
To tell the night from the day 
We are incomplete and hollow 
For our maker has gone away 

Who is to blame 
We'll surely melt in the rain
Say I, Say I
Say I, Say I
Say I, Say I

The stillness is so lifeless with no spirit in your soul 
Like children with no vision do exactly what they're told 
Being led into the desert 
For your strength will surely fade 

Who is to blame 
We'll surely melt in the rain 
Say I, Say I
Say I, Say I
Say I, Say I

Say I, Say I
Say I, Say I
Say I, Say I

Frantic, faction, focus 
The world breathes 
And out forms this misconception we call man
But I don't know him 
No, I don't know him 
Because he lies..They lie 

Say I, yeah
Say I, yeah
Say I, yeah
Say I, Say I
Say I, Say I
