She came calling 
One early morning 
She showed her crown of thorns 
She whispered softly 
To tell a story 
About how she had been wronged 
As she lay lifeless 
He stole her innocence 
And this is how she carried on 
This is how she carried on

Well I guess she closed her eyes 
And just imagined everything's alright 
But she could not hide her tears 
'Cause they were sent to wash away those years 
They were sent to wash away those years 

My anger's violent 
But still I'm silent 
When tragedy strikes at home 
I know this decadence Is shared by millions 
Remember you're not alone 
Remember you're not alone 

Well if you just close your eyes 
And just imagine everything's alright 
But do not hide your tears 
'Cause they were sent to wash away those years 
Well if you just close your eyes 
And just imagine everything's alright 
But do not hide your tears 
'Cause they were sent to wash away those years 
They were sent to wash away those years 
Maybe we can wash away those years 

For we have crossed many oceans 
And we labor in between 
In life there are many quotients 
And I hope I find the mean
the mean, the mean

Well if you just close your eyes 
And just imagine everything's alright 
But do not hide your tears 
'Cause they were sent to wash away those years 
Well if you just close your eyes 
And just imagine everything's alright 
But do not hide your tears 
'Cause they were sent to wash away those years 
Maybe we can wash away those years 
I hope that you can wash away those years
