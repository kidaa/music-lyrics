Run...hide
All that was sacred to us
Sacred to us
See the signs
The covenant has been broken
By mankind
Leaving us with no shoulder...with no shoulder
To rest our head on
To rest our head on
To rest our head on

Who's got my back now
When all we have left is deceptive
So disconnected
So what is the truth now

There's still time
All that has been devastated
Can be recreated
Realize
We pick up the broken pieces
Of our lives
Giving ourselves to each other...ourselves to each other\
To rest our head on
To rest our head on
To rest our head on

Who's got my back now
When all we have left is deceptive
So disconnected
So what is the truth now

Tell me the truth now...Tell us the truth now

Who's got my back now
When all we have left is deceptive
So disconnected
So what is the truth now
