Caught up in the middle
Had no choice, had no choice
Birthright forgotten, so silent
No voice
I see you
You know who
Little girl, little girl
Now realize little girl
Overlooked little girl
Bottled up and empty holding back
At loss you're forgotten
Getting back, get back
Expectations of another
Love given to the younger
Broken father, broken brother
Emptiness feeds the hunger
I see you
You know who
Little sister, little sister
Now realize little sister
Overlooked little girl
Change, change, change
