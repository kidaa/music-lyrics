Walking around I hear the earth seekihng relief
I'm trying to find a reason to live
But the mindless clutter my path
Oh these thorns in my side
I know I have something free
I have something so alive
I think they shoot cause they want it

I feel forces all around me
Come on raise your head
Those who hide behind the shadows
Live with all that's dead

[Chorus]
Look at me... look at me
At least look at me when you shoot a bullet through my head
Through my head
Through my head
Through my head

Im my lifetime when I'm disgraced
By jealousy and lies
I laugh aloud 'cause my life
Has gotten inside someone else's mind

Look at me...look at me
At least look at me when you shoot a bullet through my head
Through my head
Through my head
Through my head

Hey all I want is what's real
Something I touch and can feel
I'll hold it close and never let it go
Said why...why do we live life
With all this hate inside
I'll give it away 'cause I don't want it no more
Please help me find a place 
Somewhere far away I'll go and you'll never see me again
