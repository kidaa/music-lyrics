Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll all night long. 

You've got to roll, roll, roll
You've got to thrill my soul, all right
Roll, roll, roll, roll
Thrill my soul, etc.

Ashen lady
Give up your vows
Give up your vows
Save our city
Save our city
Right now.

The future's uncertain and the end is always near. 

Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll all night long.
