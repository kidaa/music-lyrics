The sun rises to another day
My constitution keeps changing
'Til it slips away
So I lie awake and stare
My mind thinking, just wandering
Is anybody there
Should I stay or go

Should I sleep or stay awake
Am I really happy or is it all
Just an illusion

Sitting in my room now
Hiding thoughts
Just hoping one day I'll get out
I hear a voice call my name
Breaking trance, so silent
So I can stay the same

Should I stay or go
Should I sleep or stay awake
Am I really happy or is it all
Just an illusion

[Guitar Break]

Wait now, many things left unsaid
This life remains the same
But I change
I try to fool myself in believing
Things are going to get better
But life goes on

Should I stay or go
Should I sleep or stay awake
Am I really happy or is it all
Just an illusion 
Just an Illusion
Just an illusion 
Just an illusion 
Just an illusion 
Just an illusion 
Just an illusion
