I can't find the rhyme in all my reason I've lost sense of time and all seasons I feel I've been beaten down by the words of men who have no grounds. I can't sleep beneath the trees of wisdom when your ax has cut the roots that feed them forked tongues in bitter mouths can drive a man to bleed from inside out

What if you did? what if you lied? what if I avenge? what if eye for an eye?

I've seen the wicked fruit of your vine destroy the man who lacks a strong mind human pride sings a vengeful song inspired by the times you've been walked on. my stage is shared by many millions who lift their hands up high because they feel this we are one we are strong the more you hold us down the more we press on

What if you did? what if you lied? what if I avenge? what if eye for an eye?

I know I can't hold the hate inside my mind 'cause what consumes your thoughts controls your life so I'll just ask a question, an only a simple question, I'll just ask one question...

What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I? what if, what if, what if, what if, what if I? what if, what if, what if, what if, what if I? what if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?

What if you did? what if you lied? what if I avenge? what if eye for an eye? what if your words could be judged like a crime?

What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I? what if, what if, what if, what if, what if I? what if, what if, what if, what if, what if I? what if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?...
