This is not about age
Time served on the earth doesn't mean you grow in the mind
This is not about God
Spiritual insinuations seem to shock our nation

Come with me I'm fading underneath the lights
Come with me
Come with me
Come with me now

This is not about race
It's a decision to stop the division in your life
This is not about sex
We all know sex sells and the whole world is buying

Come with me I'm fading underneath the lights
Come with me 
Come with me
Come with me now

Can't you see the signs
See the signs now

Can't you see them
See the signs 
You see them
All the signs we see them
Can't you see them
