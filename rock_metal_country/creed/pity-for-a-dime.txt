An artificial season
Covered by summer rain
Losing all my reason
Cause there's nothing left to blame
Shadows paint the sidewalk
A living picture in a frame
See the sea of people
All their faces look the same

So I sat down for awhile
Forcing a smile
In a state of self-denial
Is it worthwhile
Sell my pity for a dime
Yeah, Just one dime
Sell my pity for a dime
Yeah, Just one dime

Plain talk can be the easy way
Signs of losing my faith
Losing my faith
Plain talk can be the easy way
Signs of losing my faith
Losing my faith

So I sat down for awhile
Yeah, Forcing a smile
In a state of self-denial
Yeah, Is it worthwhile
Sell my pity for a dime
Yeah, Just one dime
Sell my pity for a dime
Yeah, Just one dime
So I sat down for awhile
Yeah, Forcing a smile
In a state of self-denial
Yeah, Is it worthwhile
Sell my pity for a dime
Yeah, Just one dime
Sell my pity for a dime
Yeah, Just one dime
