The rage in my eyes 
Could have compared 
To the eye of the sun 
Then rain took its course 
Through the hands of the sun  
Repent? for all time 
The world is at war leaving all hope?fault? behind  

So, is this the end for us my friend? 
So, is this the end for us my friend? 
The saints? in the sky  
are there to remind us of man and his fight 

When two worlds collide 
One steals a life like a thief in the night 
So look to the sky 
He holds the keys for your life and mine 

So, is this the end for us my friend? 
So, is this the end for us my friend? 
So, is this the end for us my friend? 
So, is this the end for us my friend? 

Well, as the wind rides  
As the day breaks for dawn  
And as the moon hides the sun, oh the sun  
No more sorrow, oh those crying days are gone  
No more sorrow, now its gone, now it's gone 
Now it's gone 

So, is this the end for us my friend? 
So, is this the end for us my friend? 
So, is this the end for us my friend? 
So, is this the end for us my friend? 
So, is this the end for us my friend? 


IS THIS THE END 
Original Acoustic Version 

The rage in my eyes 
Could have compared to the eye of the sun 
Then rain took its course 
Through the hands of the sun 

Repent, for all time 
The world is at war leaving all hope?fault? behind 

And I ask so, is this the end for us my friend? 
So, is this the end for us my friend? 

The saints on his side 
Cover the sins of mankind and his pride 
That night he died 
But rose once again 
To sit down by his side 
He reigns for all time 
Taking the keys back for your life and mine 

And I ask so, is this the end for us my friend? 
So, is this the end for us my friend? 
So is this the end for us my friend? 
Aw, yeah 

Well as the wind rides 
As the day breaks for dawn 
And as the moon hides the sun 
Oh the sun 
No more sorrow 
Oh your crying days are gone 
No more sorrow, now its gone, now its gone 

They're gone 
They're gone 
They're gone 

And I ask so, is this the end for us my friend? 
And I ask so, is this the end for us my friend? 

So is this the end for us my friend 
So is this the end for us my friend
