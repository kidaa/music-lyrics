Hot sun, dancin' on a river
We sit on the bank, watch the world go by
Our feet in the water, she pressed her lips to mine
We were so long on love, so short on time
She could be a honeymoon sweet and little wild
She was mine, oh for a little while 

I laugh, everytime I start to think about us
We sent that summer out in style
She's gone, but she left me with a smile
'Cause she was mine for a little while 

We take a ride and head on down to airport road
Put the seats back and watch the planes leave town
Always said, nobody's strong enough to tie her down
Oh but I wasn't lookin' for that anyhow
I knew she would leave, but I didn't know when
It matters to me now, oh but it didn't back then and 

I keep seeing pictures now of me and her and those summer nights
My mind fills with her, oh but it's alright cause 

I laugh, everytime I start to think about us
We sent that summer out in style
She's gone, but she left me with a smile
'Cause she was mine for a little while
