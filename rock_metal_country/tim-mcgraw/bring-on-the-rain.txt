Another day has almost come and gone 
Can't imagine what else could go wrong 
Sometimes I'd like to hide away 
Somewhere and lock the door 
A single battle lost but the war 'cause 

Tomorrow's another day 
And I'm thirsty anyway 
So bring on the rain 

It's almost like the hard times circle 'round 
A couple trops and they all start coming down 
Yeah, I might feel defeated 
I might hang my head 
I might be barely breathing - but I'm not dead 

Repeat Chorus 

Solo 1/2 Verse 

I'm not gonna let it get me down 
I'm not gonna cry 
And I'm not gonna lose any sleep tonight.
