I wanna drink that shot of whiskey
I wanna smoke that cigarette
I wanna smell that sweet addiction on my breath
I wanna ride cross west Virginia on the backseat of a Cadillac
You know some cowboys like me go out like that so I need you

[Chorus]
Like a needle needs a vein
Like Uncle Joe in Oklahoma needs a rain
I need you like a lighthouse on the coast
Like the father and the son needs the holy ghost
I need you

I wanna get lost in some corner booth
A canteena in Mexico
I wanna dance to the static of an a.m. radio
I wanna wrap the moon around us and lay beside you skin on skin
Make love til' the sun comes up and the sun goes down again cause i need you

[Chorus]
Like a needle needs a vein
Like Uncle Joe in Oklahoma needs a rain
I need you
Like a lighthouse on the coast
Like the father and the son needs the holy ghost
I need you

I wanna drink that shot of whiskey
I wanna smoke that cigarette
You know some cowboys like me go like that I need you
