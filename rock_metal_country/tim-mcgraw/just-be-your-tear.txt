Don't know why he does what he does
Playing lost and found with your love
Trying to confuse you, use you
Girl. he's gonna lose you sure enough

Don't know why he says all those things
ALways shootin' all your dreams
He ought to know better than that
He ought to be watching his back
'cause you know you know

[Chorus]

Girl I'd love to shine in your eyes
If only for just a moment
You know I'd be satisfied
If I could only touch your cheek
Baby that's all I'd need
To make my life complete
Girl I know I can make you smile
If you knew that I was here
Wishing that I could be your tear

I dont know why he cant find the words
Saying all those things you deserve
Girl if it was me there I swear
You know you wouldn't have to feel so unsure
ABout what tomorrow would bring
Don't you know I'd give everything
If I could just hold you like him
If I could be more than just friends
'Cause you know you know

[Repeat Chorus Twice]

Wishing I could just be your tear
