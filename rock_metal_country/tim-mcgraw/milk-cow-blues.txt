Oh, milk cow blues, cow, Ahh, Larry 
Ahh, Tim come on tell it now 

I woke up this morning 
Looked out my door 
I could tell my old milk cow 
I could tell by the way she lowed 
If you see my milk cow, please drive her on home 
Put her in low and drive 
Cause I ain't had no milk and butter 
Since my milk cow been gone 
Oh, I know what you're talkin', let me tell you 

You gotta treat me right, woman 
Day by day 
Get out your little prayer book 
Get down on your knees and pray 
You're gonna need, you're gonna need my help one of these days 
Oh, tell it like it is, tell it like it is 
You're gonna be sorry, you treated me this way 

Oh Tommy Hawson, come on in Low down, get down on the bottom, Gotcha, ahh 

I said well good evenin' 
Don't that sun look good going down? 
I said well good evenin' 
Don't that sun look good going down? 
And don't my home look lonesome 
When my lover ain't around 
Oh, here we go, Tommy   Jason, sounds like me too 
Ahh, low, you know what low means, yeah 

Sail on, sail on, sail on 
Little gal, sail on 
Tell it, Tim, I'm gonna tell it too 
Sail on, sail on, sail on 
Little gal, sail on 
You're gonna keep right on sailing 
Til you lose your happy home 

All together now, Milk Cow, Ride on home 

I've tried everything baby 
To get along with you 
Now tell me brother Tim, What are you gonna to do? 
I'm gonna stop crying 
I'm gonna leave you alone 
If you don't think I'm leaving 
You can count the days I'm gone 
Oh, walk on, walk on 
You're gonna need me baby 
You're gonna need my love someday 
Have some Faith, Tim, have some Faith 
You're gonna be sorry 
You treated me this way 

Oh, milk cow blues 
Oh, milk cow 
Come on home darlin'
