Everywhere I go, they're staring at her 
Every man I know-he wants to have her 
I guess I ought to be a jealous man 
I look the other way-they're hittin' on her 
Every night and day, they telephone her 
They try to get to her, but I know they can't 
She never lets it go to her heart 
She never lets it go that far 
When they start talking, she starts walking 
Right back to my arms 
She can turn every head 
But she never lets it go to her heart 

She walks into the room and everybody 
Watches every move, hoping she don't love me 
I know it by the way they hang around 
But they don't realize there's more to her than 
What meets the eye, that's why I'm certain 
No matter what they do to reach her now 

'Cause she never lets it go to her heart 
She never lets it go that far 
When they start talking, she starts walking 
Right back to my arms 
She can turn every head 
But she never lets it go to her heart 

When they start talking, she starts walking 
Right back to my arms 
She can turn every head 
But she never lets it go to her heart
