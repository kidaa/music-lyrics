I need perspective, 'cos I'm facing the wall.
I need perspective, 'cos I'm not that tall.
I need perspective, heard the trumpet call.
Don't trust my eyes, want to know where things fall.

I need perspective, party time for the newly wed.
I need perspective, colors ran as the images bled.
I need perspective, like confetti on the flower bed.
Don't trust my eyes, priest crying he's got fire in his head.

[Chorus:]
Oh Gaia, if that's your name,
Treat you like dirt, but I don't want to blame.
Oh Gaia, the wind heals the fire and blows the ash away.

I need perspective, sitting in a long, long hall.
I need perspective, staring at the white, white wall.
I need perspective, waiting for the phone to call.
Don't trust my eyes, there's one thing I've got to tell you all.

I need perspective, to see through red, red skies.
I need perspective, to carry merchandise.
I need perspective, I don't trust my eyes.

[Chorus]

I used to be an industrial giant,
Sitting in a garden full of chemical plants.
Trying very hard to get you off my mind.
Acting like any man, taking you for all I can,
Just the same, the same as all my kind, so blind.

I need perspective.
