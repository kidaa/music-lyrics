saw a group of people forming 
round a figure lying down 
and someone runs to make a phone call 
and the man kneels on the ground 
the man kneels on the ground 
there's a tightening in my chest 
i know that I'm drawn in 
oh god let it not be - you 

don't leave us 
don't leave like this 
don't leave me here again 
i'm not quitting on you 
no one else 
you're not quitting on us 
no running out 

the colour in your shirt is darkening, 
against the paleness of your skin 
i remember how you held the goldfish 
swimming around in a plastic bag 
swimming around in a plastic bag 

you held it up so high 
in the bright lights of the fair 
it slipped and fell 
we looked everywhere 

don't leave us your eyes are bright, your blood is warm 
don't leave like this your heart is strong, you're holding on 
don't leave me here again i feel your pulse, i hold your hand 
i'm not quitting on you 
there's no one else 
you're not quitting on us 
there's no way out 
no way out 

don't leave us 
don't leave like this 
don't leave me here again i feel your pulse, i hold your hand 
i'm not quitting on you 
there's no one else 
you're not quitting on us 
no running away - no way out
