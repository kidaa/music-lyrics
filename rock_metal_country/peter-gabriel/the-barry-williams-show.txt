let's go 

one man at the window 
one girl at the bar 
saw that look of recognition 
when they know just who you are 
i seen you on the tv 
i seen you on that show 
you make the people crazy 
and then you let them go 

before the show we calm them 
we sympathise, we care 
and the hostile folk we keep apart 
'til the red light says 'on air' 
did you see our leather lovers 
all tied up to the chair 
did you catch those child molesters 
no one else goes there 

what a show, the barry williams show 
what a show, 
dysfunctional excess 
is all it took for my success 
the greater pain that they endure 
the more you know the show will scored 
it's showtime 

got the reputation of a surgeon 
'cos they cannot feel the cut 
it looks so very simple 
but it really is an art 
they call our studio 'the hospital' 
making money from the sick 
we let people be themselves 
there is no other trick 

'my lover stole my girlfriend' 
'i keep beating up my ex' 
'i want to kill my neighbour' 
'my daughter's selling sex' 
'my s/m lover hurt me' 
'my girl became a man' 
'i love my daughter's rapist 
'my life's gone down the pan' 

what a show, the barry williams show 
the barry williams show 
dysfunctional excess 
is all it took for my success 
and when the punches start to fly 
the ratings always read so high 
it's showtime 

'that girl has got no scruples' 
not a wrinkle on her face 
you would not believe the plot she conceived 
so they'd let her take my place 
well, no man is an island 
no man is a sea 
but this display of emotion 
is all but drowning me 

what a show, oh what a show 
on my show, the barry williams show 
it's my show 
what a show 
dysfunctional excess 
is all it took for my success 

the best tv you've ever seen 
where people say the things that they really mean 
i hear my name, i hear them roar 
for the one more time i take the floor 
just one more barry williams show 
we're gonna take you where you want to go 
it's showtime 

come on down 
come on down
