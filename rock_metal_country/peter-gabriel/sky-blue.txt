lost my time lost my place in 
sky blue 
those two blue eyes light your face in 
sky blue 
i know how to fly, i know how to drown in 
sky blue 

warm wind blowing over the earth 
sky blue 
i sing through the land, the land sings through me 
sky blue 
reaching into the deepest shade of 
sky blue 

sky blue 
so tired of all this travelling 
so many miles away from home 
i keep moving to be stable 
free to wander, free to roam 

train pulled out said my goodbyes 
sky blue 
back on the road alone with the sky 
sky blue 
there's a presence here no one denies 
sky blue 

sky blue 

sky blue 
so tired of all this travelling 
so many miles away from home 
i keep moving to be stable 
free to wander, free to roam 

i can hear the same voice calling 
crying out, from my heart 
and that cry, what a cry 
what a cry, it's going to be 
if i can stop to let it out, oh
