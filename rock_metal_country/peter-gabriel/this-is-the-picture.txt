excellent birds

flying birds
excellent birds
watch them fly, there they go
falling snow
excellent snow
here it comes. watch it fall

long words
excellent words
I can hear them now

this is the picture, this is the picture
this is the picture, this is the picture

I'm sitting by the window
watching the snow fall
I'm looking out
and I'm moving, turning in time
catching up. moving in
jump up! I can land on my feet. look out!

this is the picture, this is the picture
this is the picture, this is the picture

looking out. watching out
when I see the future I close my eyes
I can see it now

I see pictures of people, rising up
pictures of people, falling down
I see pictures of people
they're standing on their heads, they're ready
they're looking out, look out!
they're watching out, watch out!
they're looking out, look out!
they're watching out, watch out!

I see pictures of people
I see pictures of people
