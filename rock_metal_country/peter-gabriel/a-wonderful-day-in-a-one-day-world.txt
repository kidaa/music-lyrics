Saturday is shopping day and I drive my car but there's no place to park it,
No respect for supermen in the supermarket.
I guess there must be trouble but I've not been alerted;
Looking round the store, it was all deserted
And I'm stranded here with my empty basket,
So full of questions but nowhere to ask it.

[Chorus:]
By the one way out, strange voice shouts,
"Don't let that good man out!"
"Have a wonderful day in our one-way world,
One way, one day;
Have a wonderful day in our one-way world,
One way, one day;
One-way man, one-way mind, get along with mankind."

There's an old man on the floor so I summon my charm,
I say, "Hey scumbag, has there been an alarm"
He says "Yeah, I been selling off eternal youth,
They all got afraid, 'cos I'm the living proof.
My name is Einstein, do you know time is a curve"
I said, "Stop, old man! You've got a nerve,
'cos there's only one rule that I observe:
Time is money, and money I serve."

[Chorus]
