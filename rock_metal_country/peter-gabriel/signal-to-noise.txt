you know the way that things go 
when what you fight for starts to fall 
and in that fuzzy picture 
he writing stands out on the wall 
so clearly on the wall 

send out the signals deep and loud 

and in this place, can you reassure me 
with a touch, a smile - while the cradle's burning 
all the while the world is turning to noise 
oh the more that it's surrounding us 
the more that it destroys 
turn up the signal 
wipe out the noise 

send out the signals deep and loud 

man i'm losing sound and sight 
of all those who can tell me wrong from right 
when all things beautiful and bright 
sink in the night 
yet there's still something in my heart 
that can find a way 
to make a start 
to turn up the signal 
wipe out the noise 

wipe out the noise 
wipe out the noise 
you know that's it 
you know that's it 
receive and transmit 
receive and transmit 
receive and transmit 
you know that's it 
you know that's it 
receive and transmit 
you know that's it 
you know that's it 
receive and transmit
