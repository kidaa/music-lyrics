I want to be with you
I want to be clear
but each time I try
it's the voice I hear
I hear that voice again

I'm listening to the conversation
judge and jury in my head
it's colouring everything
all we did and said
and still I head that sharp tongue talking
talking tangled words
I can sense the danger
just listen to the wind

I want you close I want you near
I can't help but listen
but I don't want to hear
hear that voice again

I want to be with you
I want to be clear
but each time I try
it's the voice I hear
I hear that voice again

I'm hearing right and wrong so clearly
there must be more than this
it's only in uncertainty
that we're naked and alive
I hear it through the rattle of a streetcar
hear it through the things you said
I can get so scared
listen to the wind

I want you close I want you near
I can't help but listen
but I don't want to hear
hear that voice again

what I carry in my heart
brings us so close or so far apart
only love can make love

I want you close I want you near
I can't help but listen
but I don't want to hear
I hear that voice again

I want to be with you
I want to be clear
but each time I try
it's the voice I hear
I hear that voice again
