the metal jangles as the key turns 
unlock the door, wipe my feet clean 
oh my head sounds like that 

the oil is spitting in the saucepan 
i squeeze this sponge and let the cat out 
oh my head sounds like that 
oh my head 
oh oh oh 
oh oh oh 

the water's dripping in the hallway 
the guy next door, he knocks his wall down 
oh my head sounds like that 

the knife it scrapes across the burnt brown toast 
the freight train rumbles pass my window 
oh my head sounds like that 
oh my head 
oh oh oh 
oh oh oh 
oh oh oh 

around the axis we all spin 
to determine what's left out and what's left in 
what's left out and what's left in 
what's left out and what's left in 
who's left out and who's left in 
who's left in 

the moment's come and go like water 
i try to hold them but they're fading 
oh my head sounds like that 
oh my head 
oh oh oh
