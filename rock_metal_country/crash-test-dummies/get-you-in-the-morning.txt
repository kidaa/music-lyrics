I want it cheap, I want it now 
I want it fast, and I want it with feeling
I want it deep, I want a vow 
I want it to last, and I want it with meaning

I will come and get you in the morning 
We'll just go and not give any warning

I am the cheap, I'm right here now 
I'm moving fast, and I've got the feeling
I'm going deep, I've made my vow 
It is my last, and it's the one I'm keeping

I will come and get you in the morning 
We'll just go and not give any warning 
I will come and get you in the morning

I'm on my game, I walk the walk 
I smell the smell, and I feel the feeling
It's in my name, I talk the talk 
I ring the bell, and I do the dealing

I am the name, I am the walk 
I've got the smell, and I've got the feeling
I'm going deep, I'm going fast 
I'm going now, and I'm going with meaning

I will come and get you in the morning 
We'll just go and not give any warning 
I will come and get you in the morning 
We'll just go and not give any warning 
I will come and get you in the morning 
We'll just go and not give any warning 
I will come and get you in the morning
