Long ago, a woman prayed that her suitors be
Repelled so she might serve God, be His only
God heard her prayers floating up and his heart was cheered
He rewarded her amply with a full beard

But then she wondered if she should start to take it easy
"Overachiever" might be putting it mildly

A student of behaviour psychology
Conditioned himself to stick to his studies
He grew tired of these routines and tried to drop them
But he was caught in his own trap and couldn't stop them

And then he wondered if he should start to take it easy
"Overachiever" might be putting it mildly

Once a man was determined to get into
The program for astronauts and go to the moon
Finally he was in space, saw the planet
Fear struck and he threw up inside his helmet

Then he wondered if he should start to take it easy
"Overachiever" might be putting it mildly
