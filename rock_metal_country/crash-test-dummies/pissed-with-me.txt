You try to play it cool, but you're pissed with me
In the swimming pool where you kissed with me
You're a shiny jewel, two-fistin' drinks on me
You're a killing tool, you're getting pissed with me

Pissed with me, baby
All night long
Pissed with me, baby
All night long

Another drink and a little ice
Would be quite good, I think, baby, don't think twice
You say we're kissin' cousins, well that's very nice
Baby, I've kissed dozens, you've got that extra spice

Kissin' with me, baby
All night long
Kissin' with me, baby
All night long

I've been having some trouble, someone's dickin' with me
I think I must have a double who's been frickin' with me
Well, he seems like fun, he looks just like me
He's doing everyone, so you be stickin' with me

Stickin' with me, baby
All night long
Stickin' with me, baby
All night long
Pissed with me, baby
All night long
Kissin' with me, baby
All night long
