Well looky here now, my oh my 
I got a bug stuck in my eye 
I feel the chill right through my coat 
I got a pill stuck in my throat
I'm a man, walking with a stick 
I'm a man who likes to get in his kicks 
I'm the man, talking to his dick 
I'm the man getting all the chicks

You're gettin' flirty with me, 
You're talkin' dirty to me, 
You're sayin' "c'mon, baby!" 
YEAH!

I want to par-tay! P-par-tay! 
I want to par-tay! P-par-tay!

I should have checked before I chewed 
I got a worm stuck in my food 
I'm walking funny and it's not by chance 
I got some shit stuck in my pants
You know that I could have my pick 
You know that I got quirks and ticks 
I like the way you play your tricks 
I like the way you like to squirm and kick

You're gettin' flirty with me, 
You're talkin' dirty to me, 
You're sayin' "c'mon, baby!" 
YEAH!

I want to par-tay! P-par-tay! 
I want to par-tay! P-par-tay!

You know that it's not just a joke 
I like to suck back a lot of Coke 
I like the sugar it contains 
I like the syrup in my veins
I'm a man walking with his drink 
I'm a man talking to his drink 
I'm a man woofing in the sink 
And I'm the man, whatever you may think!

You're gettin' flirty with me, 
You're talkin' dirty to me, 
You're sayin' "c'mon, baby!" 
YEAH!

I want to par-tay! P-par-tay! 
I want to par-tay! P-par-tay!
I want to par-tay! P-par-tay! 
I want to par-tay! Par-tay! 
Par-tay! par-tay! 
I want to par-tay! Par-tay! 
I want to...
