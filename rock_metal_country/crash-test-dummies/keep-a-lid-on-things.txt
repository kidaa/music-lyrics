Who put the doggy in the doghouse
You did, baby - you did
Who put your granny in the grannyhouse
You did, baby - you did, baby
Who put the bad in the madhouse
You did, baby - you did
Who put that junk in the junkhouse
You did, baby - you did, baby

Keep your eye on things while I'm gone
Keep a lid on things
Don't you try everything while I'm gone
Keep a lid on things

Who put the fun in the funhouse
You did, baby - you did
Who put your dad in the halfhouse
You did, baby - you did, baby
Who put the boys in the clubhouse
You did, baby - you did
Who put the cat in the cathouse
You did, baby - you did, baby

Keep your eye on things while I'm gone
Keep a lid on things
Don't you try everything while I'm gone
Keep a lid on things
Keep your eye on things while I'm gone
Keep a lid on things

Who dug the hole in the outhouse
You did, baby - you did
Who put Whitey in the White House
You did, baby - you did, baby

Keep your eye on things while I'm gone
Keep a lid on things
Don't you try everything while I'm gone
Keep a lid on things
Keep your eye on things while I'm gone
Keep a lid on things
