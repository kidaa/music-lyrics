My doctor told me that it was time for me to have my X ray
Of course, I had many nightmares about that fatal day
The room was dark and my skeleton was floating on the wall
My voice trembles down inside me
I'm trapped way down in my body

[CHORUS]
I, I, I, oh here I stand before me
But something's out of place here
My mind's eye is missing from my body
Well I know it's there but I can't see where

Well take my fingers, what do fingers really mean to me
You can easily look them up in the dictionary:
They call them digits, or technically they're known as the "philanges"
My joints connected up inside me
Way down deep inside my body

My bones shine brightly, a map of my whole body
My vital organs just churn away inside me
Some day they're going to stop this motion
And I'll be left with...

My my, the future lay before me
Hey hey, deep inside my body
