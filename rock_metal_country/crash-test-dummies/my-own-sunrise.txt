When we met, it was in the hot green jungle
Your perfect flesh impervious to anything fungal
You would sweat coconut milk and
I'd lie awake, restless with the heat during the night

Dawn would come and I would start to feel my own sunrise
But you'd just lie, sleeping

And so we went away in search of gentler breezes
When we arrived, I longed to lie and rustle in your grasses
But you would not permit me to retire there
None but a fly might settle on the meadow of your leg

Dawn would come and I would start to feel my own sunrise
But you'd just lie, sleeping

Then we moved on until we reached the tundra in the winter
Of course I longed to kiss her frosty teeth in the cold air
But now I've grown bloated on seal fat
Not even flies will settle on the meadow of her leg

Dawn would come and I would start to feel my own sunrise
But you'd just lie, sleeping
