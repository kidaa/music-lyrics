Through my diseased eyes
I'm sinful, sly
I can't stop stealing
I will pay the price of being a thief
When I stop breathing 

If you could see what I can see
Feel what I feel
When my head is on fire
When I'm a burning wheel 

Through my bleeding eyes
I'm filthy, fly
I crawl with insects
I'm anaesthetized
I'm demonized
Caught in the vortex 

Repeat Chorus 

I see, I feel, I see, I feel
I see, I feel, I see, I feel 

Repeat chorus
