No way of knowing if she's ever coming back
No way of knowing if I care or not
No way of knowing if she's right or if she's wrong
No way of knowing if I'll carry on

And I'm alive
And I'm alone
And I've never wanted to be either of those X2

And she shines
And she shines for me
she shines for me....

No way of knowing if she's ever coming back
No way of knowing if I care or not
No way of knowing if she's right or if she's wrong
No way of knowing if I'll carry on

And she shines
And she shines for me
she shines for me....

And I'm alive
And I'm alone
And I've never wanted to be either of those X2

I'm alive
I'm alone
And I never wanted to be either of those X2

And she shines
And she shines for me
She shines for me.... X2
