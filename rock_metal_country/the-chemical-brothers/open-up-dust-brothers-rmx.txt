Be bigger than God
Be bigger than God
Be bigger than God

You lied. You faked. You cheated.
You changed the stakes.
Magnet toss that high in the sky.
Unrehearsed. Let the bubbles burst.

Now open up. Make room for me.
Now open up. Make room for me.

Be bigger than God
Be bigger than God
Be bigger than God
