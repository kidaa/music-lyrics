not another drugstore not another town
tired of the old skool i had to put it down
you know there was a man and he put the ground down
so we rollin' with the chemicals and we got the new sound
chemical reflections like koolaid with owlsley
wicked on the track you know me the drugstore cowboy
down boy
up and silly with the twin ring ring connect it then
proceed to rip it like scissors
comin' through your town like a fuckin' blizzard
cheech wizard
high hat
???? with the track
you know me rollin' with my click the one inch punch
and it's like a bag a bunch
come on and ????
chemicals....
