Your soul don't burn
You dark the sun you
Rain down fire on everyone
Scabs, police, government thieves
Venal psychic amputees
Parasitic your syphilitic
Parasitic your syphilitic 

Swastika eyes
You got
Swastika eyes
You got
Swastika eyes, swastika eyes, swastika eyes 

I'll vent my spleen I'll keep my dreams
My flesh my bones my soul I own
My mind's a weapon immune from infection
Blood in my eyes, my vision is clear
Parasitic your syphilitic
Parasitic your syphilitic 

Swastika eyes
You got
Swastika eyes
You got
Swastika eyes, swastika eyes, swastika eyes 

I see your autosuggestion psychology 
Elimination policy
A military industrial
Illusion of democracy 

Swastika eyes
You got
Swastika eyes
You got
Swastika eyes, swastika eyes, swastika eyes
