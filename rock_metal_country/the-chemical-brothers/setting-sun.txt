You're the devil in me I brought in from the cold  
You said your body was young but your mind was very old  
You're coming on strong and I like the way  
The visions we had have faded away  
You're part of a life I've never had  
I'll tell you that it's just too bad   
X5  
You're coming on strong  
You're showing your colour  
Like a setting sun

Sunday morning I'm waking up  
Can't even focus on a coffee cup  
Don't even know who's bed I'm in  
Where do I start  
Where do I begin

Sunday morning I'm waking up  
Can't even focus on a coffee cup  
Don't even know who's bed I'm in  
Where do I start  
Where do I begin  
Where do I start  
Where do I begin
