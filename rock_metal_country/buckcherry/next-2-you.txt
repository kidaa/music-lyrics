Come to you honey on the east side runnin' and I ain't got time to waste
Jump into the car in the back seat lovin' but your keeping me on the chase
I've been trying all nightlong I put up with your favorite songs all night
Tempted by your tainted love I surely like for you to come inside my crystal ball what can I do
Is it true what they say you won't give it away
And I don't what to do to next to you, next to you
Every night everyday you just push me away
Tell me what should I do to next to you, next to you
I've been trying all nightlong cause I want to get next to you
I wrote about you baby in this song and I want to get next to you
Next to you
Better than koolaid sweet my buttercup baby's got a pretty face
I got to have it, it's another bad habit I hope not here to late
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
Spent my money, teasing me honey, what should I do
When you gonna show me? I think you owe me, come on baby see it through
[Chorus]
