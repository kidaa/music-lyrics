I will sacrifice, I promise I'll behave
I'll keep my head high, I'll keep my foot out of the grave
I'm lucky I found you, you always speak the truth
Cause in my past life baby I got screwed
And I'm still out of line
When it comes to you
And I'm still out of line
I keep trying to break through
I'm not a bad man, I'm just a glutton for abuse
In my dirty hands, a diamond clean and shackles loose
Let's take some more time, I want to make it through
Was it the first time, or just another bad excuse
[Chorus x2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah a ah, yeah a ah aaa
I will sacrifice, I promise I'll behave
I'll keep my head high I'll deep my foot out of the grave
[Chorus x2]
