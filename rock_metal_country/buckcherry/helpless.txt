Sing me a song cause I don't want to hear my life go by
Sing me a song and let the melody dance through our hearts tonight
And if you face it find that the love we can make is so strong
Forget what their saying stay true to yourself and move on
I see the city at night I see the street life, the restaurants, the passerby's
Somebody's home to the shower they go clean the stress away
Is anyone out there to the heartbreak station I'm gone
Forget what there saying stay true to yourself and move on
I don't want to live my life today I'm all out of love and I'm tired of changing
I hope you can help pass the time away is anyone out there to the heartbreak station I'm gone
I fell out of love this time again can't stand one more fight I'm too tired and crazy I know someday I will be strong again forget what their saying to the heartbreak station I'm gone
