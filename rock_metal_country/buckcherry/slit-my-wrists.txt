What is wrong with you can't we both just get along I see the hesitation in your eyes
Take me back again maybe we can work it out you know I hate to see you when you cry
Slit my wrists and I'll just fade away
The Corolinas where I want to lay
And if I walk away from here I'll never be the same can't you see it's not about you
I'm so sick of it, one more fight and all these problems is they're anything you like
Have you had enough I'd give my life for one last touch open up cause I'm coming in
[Chorus]
Late night masquerades, a quiet sea and our devotion, we fall asleep I hold you closer
Teenage wasteland aren't we crazy now
I can't carry on don't you know that I still love you we can make it here tonight
Let's just run away back to everything we live for just let go and close your eyes
[Chorus]
