Alright!
Break me down, you got a lovely face, we're going to your place, now you got to freak me out
Scream so loud, getting fucking laid you want me to stay but I got to make my way
Hey! You're a crazy bitch but you fuck so good I'm on top of it
When I dream I'm doing you all night scratches all down my back to keep me right on
Take it off, the paper is your game jump in bed with fame another one night paid in full
You're so fine, It won't be a loss cashing in the rocks just to get you face to face

[Chorus:]
Get the video, fuck you so good

[Chorus]

Baby girl you want it hard to be a star you'll have to go down
Take it off no need to talk your crazy but I like the way you fuck me

[Chorus]
