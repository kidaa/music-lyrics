I was down on my luck just gonna leave my place
Saw you out my window thought this girl is hot
Oh baby I could tell that you're in tune with yourself on the boulevard
Oh yeah
Double up on my groomin' to give your what I got 
When we get our groove on the best on the spot
We could paint the town 
And feel the rhythm of love taping in the streets
CHORUS
Get back to what it is that drives you
You just can't fight off the men and now 
You wanna tell me there's so much left for you out there 
When I'm in love with you
Can we make it to the ocean and get wet with ourselves
Listen to the movement and dance on the dock
I'm crazy for you baby and that look on your face well it's killing me
Oh yeah
Get back to what it is that drives you
You just can't fight off the men and now 
You wanna tell me there's so much left for you out there
When I'm in love with you
Baby's got the movin, it's always hot
Sitting in the park and feeling it rock
Won't you stay with me 
Feel the love
Mama play with me 
Fella's on the move looking for bucks
Generate the groove making it work
C'mon sway with me 
Feel the love
Everytime you move 
I'm alive!
Get back to what it is that drives you
You just can't fight off the men and now 
You wanna tell me there's so much left for you out there
When I'm in love with you
Get back to what it is that drives you
You just can't fight off the men and now 
You wanna tell me there's so much left for you out there 
When I'm in love with you
