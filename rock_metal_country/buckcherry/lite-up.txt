Oh Yeah!
You wanna find it
Come on, yeah
I'm on a plane with cocaine 
And yes I'm all lit up again
Cough up love and touch up
Your mama says packin' lines is sin

CHORUS 
And yes I'm all litup again
On the couch, in my bed 
And yes I'm all lit up again,flyin'
I love the cocaine, I love the cocaine 
Mama can you wait,mama can you wait 
I love the cocaine, I love the cocaine
Mama can you wait 
Oh can you wait long?
I'm on a train and ride on 
You know the train is stayin' off the track 
I'm in touch love, from this crutch 
Well you're on ten but buddy I'm on eleven
And yes I'm all lit up again
On the couch, in my bed
And yes I'm all lit up again, flyin'
I love the cocaine, I love the cocaine 
Mama can you wait, mama can you wait 
Ilove the cocaine, I love the cocaine 
Mama can you wait 
Oh can you wait long?
SOLO BREAK
Crack the door for the curious girl 'cuz she's waitin' She's been waitin' 
Chop a line for the fiendin' man 'cuz he wants one 
You know, you know you got to 
Can you feel it, can you feel it tonight 
Are you high, lord, tell me are ya fuckin' high?
In the moment, you are just so right
You're right love, oh you're right love
And yes I'm all lit up again
On the couch, in my bed 
And yes I'm all lit up again, flyin'
I love the cocaine, I love the cocaine
Mama can you wait, mama can you wait
I love the cocaine, I love the cocaine
Mama can you wait
