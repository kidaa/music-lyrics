Talk to me tonight is everything alright help me understand you
You go out with your friends, talk to other men and our love life is a wasteland
And with the change a new test of faith to help us through tomorrow a condition of the love we made
Cause things won't change without you, forfeit the lies that maimed you I want to dance with the lions and change things but I can't do it without you
You told me I'm the one and now you're out of love in your eyes it's hard to find you
If we could take some time and cut out all the lies I'd find a heart more stable
[Pre-chorus]
So take it easy girl you're falling through the night, your Mona Lisa eyes will comfort me the rest of my life
[Chorus]
When love has hit your eyes I'll never say goodbye we stand alone tonight without you, without you::you
