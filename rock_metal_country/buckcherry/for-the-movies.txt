Do you remember all our love
Did you get back from what you gave 
I see some symptoms of a past that you forgave
You never were expendable
You always made me feel alive
And now we're in the middle of 
A transition in our lives
A change of pace could really do some good 
She's leavin' an empty case which you're bringing back the show 
I'm leaving now
CHORUS
Wake up and see the places 
All you got and all you take 
You don't have to fall to pieces 
You have to prove it 
Make up your pretty face 
It's a lovely trip, a lovely place 
You got one life here to make it for the movies
Do you feel singled out 
Do you feel less than all the rest
You know it's interchangable 
The spotlight and the pain
I wanna get on top of this 
I wanna build that trust again 
And if I give it all I've got 
I'm sure you'd do the same
A change of pace could really do some good 
She's leavin' an empty case which you're bringing back the show 
I'm leaving now 
Wake up and see the places 
All you got and all you take 
You don't have to fall to pieces 
You have to prove it 
Make up your pretty face 
It's a lovely trip, a lovely place 
You got one life here to make it for the movies
SOLO 
I cannot face the fear in this 
I see a place for you and I 
And we can make the most of it 
Cause our passion never dies 
And if you don't believe in me 
I'll choose the path and change your mind 
And you can take me to your room 
Or wherever you may hide
A change of pace could really do some good 
She's leavin' an empty case which you're bringing back the show 
I'm leaving now 
Wake up and see the places 
All you got and all you take
You don't have to fall to pieces 
You have to prove it 
Make up your pretty face 
It's a lovely trip, a lovely place 
You got one life here to make it for the movies
