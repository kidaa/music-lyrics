Moving out I found some pictures of places in past times
Remember how we got through those moments of being fools
To pass the days with the passion plays 
I loved to dance the stage
And through our fights we changed our lives 
We're still related in all the truth
CHORUS
And I'm, well I'm still related 
Yeah I'm still related 
And everybody has got the groove
The night crowd pays the rent 
Now that we're playing our instruments
And underneath the car little John got his hands on a harp
Now we're sleeping days 
And our past life plays and we face the stage 
And through our fights we changed our lives 
We're still related in all the truth
And I'm, well I'm still related 
Yeah I'm still related 
And everybody has got the groove
And I'm, well I'm still related 
Yeah I'm still related 
In the crowd all around you 
Hey
Why don't you come with me, get off your ass 
And leave your ego at the door
You can always stay out late 
It's a different place 
We're just finding our way to the show
To the show 
To the show 
Yeah
And I'm, well I'm still related 
Yeah I'm still related 
And everybody has got the groove
And I'm, well I'm still related 
Yeah I'm still related 
In the crowd I will find you 
Still related, yeah 
Still related, yeah 
Still related, yeah 
Still related
