There are days that take too long
It's those days I wish I had you right here in my arms

[Pre-Chorus:]
I'm gettin' lonely, I'm sick waiting here for you
I'm gettin' lonely, please come home cause I want to be with you, or maybe I'm a fool

Baby you still drive me crazy
Nothings gonna change me so you don't have to cry
Maybe I should take the blame
I guess a music man is no shelter from the rain

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus:]
Baby you still drive me crazy
Nothings gonna change me so you don't have to cry
Baby you know that you saved me
Your loves so amazing you're never off my mind

[Solo]

Nothings going on I've been gone for way to long
I'll be right back in your arms don't be afraid
I'm getting closer, I'm making my way back home to you
I'm getting closer, I can see your face and the light keeps shining through, and what am I supposed to do

[Chorus]

Nothings going on I've been gone for way to long
I'll be right back in your arms don't be afraid
