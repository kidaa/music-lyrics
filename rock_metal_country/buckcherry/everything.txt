Buried way beneath the sheets I think she's having a meltdown
Finding it hard to fall asleep she won't let anyone help her
The look on her face a waste of time she won't let go gonna roll the dice
Loosing her grace starts to cry I feel her pain when I look in her eyes
I want ta be I want everything, I want everything
Somewhere she is on the streets trying to make things better
Praying to God and breathing deep gotta break this long obsession
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
If I had everything would I still want to be alive or want to be high [2x]
Now and then she talks to me and sometimes writes me letters
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
Your eyes, never close your eyes open up your mind and you can have everything
