If I could control my fears
Where would you be in my life
I'll tell you now I'm dangerous 
Love bleeds there in your eyes
She flies like a butterfly 
Wind underneath her pretty wings
It's not about the money babe 
Your lessons learned while you sleep
Yeah
CHORUS
Everytime I look in your eyes
Well I see the love light up in you, baby
Just between the good advice
Well I've got the love so tight in you, baby..
Baby....
I got that love so tight in you, baby
I love it when you're physical
Underneath you're beautiful
Jam it on your pillow case
It's just enough for me baby
Alright
Yeah
Everytime I look in your eyes
I see the love light up in you, baby
Just between the good advice
Well I've got the love so tight in you, baby
Let me catch a ride on your lifeline
And create some lovely destruction
Let me catch a ride on your lifeline
And create some lovely destruction
Oh yeah...
Gotta get down, c'mon yeah
Everytime I look in your eyes
I see the love light up in you, baby
Just between the good advice
Well I've got the love so tight in you baby 
Baby, baby, baby 
Baby, baby, baby 
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby 
Yeah
