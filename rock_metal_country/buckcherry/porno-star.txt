I got this pleasant view late night working avenue, never had a chance to love you never want to see you cry
Thank God it's quitting time fuck me harder kill the lights, never had a chance to love you never want to see you cry, never had a chance to love you hard cock nasty mind
Take off your clothes and shut the door, pornographic monster on the floor, that's what you like I'll come some more, don't you know we fuck for money I'm a big dick motherfucking porno star
In my face on top again a dead lay lover never wins, never had a chance to love you never want to see you cry
The best fuck you'll ever have a good job from a working man, never had a chance to love you never want to see you cry, never had a chance to love you hard cock suicide
[Chorus]
