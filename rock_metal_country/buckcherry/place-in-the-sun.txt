The rain keeps falling down shelter me I'm wet, sacred heart is burning there's a princess in my arms
I don't want to waste away tonight a starlight face a party, like some time to figure out a link to your eyes and to your mind
I wanna be alone this evening too much to hide don't want the world to see me, wait till I'm whole and find a place in the sun, and never pick up the phone
My friend keeps stalling he is restless he is scared, lonely heart is turning smell the sweetness in the air
[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]
