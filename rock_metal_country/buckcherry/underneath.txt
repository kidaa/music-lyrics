Somebody save me from domestic suicide, don't try and sell me on the safer things in life
Feel me, hold me, hate me, scold me, never change your mind
Take me, know me, kiss me, stone me, open up my eyes cause I'm dying
I'll never leave you underneath always want your company I need your love
I am defective I'm a diehard and a fiend, not off the bullshit train the truth is what I need
[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]
Do you ever remember when we stayed up through the night, I will always remember how you made me feel I'll never leave you
[Chorus]
