The curse of deception it's urgent
You're self sufficient but blind
Time to create tormented butterfly
So instrumental it seems, oh
Deadlines commitments drink the caffeine
Don't mind me, I'm sick from drugs
Blew through your love just like a hurricane
Eight ball, insinuates love
CHORUS
We're coming round the bend again,
You know you wanna tell your friends
Yeah you you wanna know that 
Your mind, your love
The pictures and the colors are cooling
Your mind, your love
Now don't you feel the movement it's soothing
That girl behind you has got the cocaine
She hasn't felt good in years, Lord
I can't wait to find what I'm looking for
I know it's gotta be here
Dog-faced complexion in through the out door
Don't mind me I'm just undone 
Long lines expecting me to drink to standard
It's just enough to stop me from shaking
We're coming round the bend again
You know you wanna tell your friends
Yeah you you wanna know that 
Your mind, your love
The pictures and the colors are cooling
Your mind, your love 
Now don't you feel the movement it's soothing
Drink the water
Drink the water
Drink the water
Everybody, c'mon
We're coming round the bend again
You know you wanna tell your friends
Yeah you you wanna know that 
Your mind, your love
The pictures and the colors are cooling
Your mind, your love 
Now don't you feel the movement it's soothing
Your mind, your love
The pictures and the colors are cooling
Your mind, your love 
Now don't you feel the movement it's soothing
Your mind, your love
Your mind, your love
Your mind, your love
Your mind, your love
Your mind, love
Mind, love
Mind, love
Mind, love
