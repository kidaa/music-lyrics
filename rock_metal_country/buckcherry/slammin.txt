Your like a stone baby all alone baby come alive when you're high
I'm on the road steady hot as hell ready I'm the next one in line
Slamin, it's your back side baby off the hook and so out of line
Slamin, is your top side heavy damn you got to give me some time
We gotta sex lady stone cold crazy let me come from behind
I'm on the phone beggin give me a piece of heaven I'm only here for the night
[Chorus]
After the last song she comes around Saturdays, holidays, we're always making the rounds
I need some face woman please be my dirty lover just do wrong don't do right
I'm on the stage burnin keep the heads turnin give it all for the life
[Chorus x2]
