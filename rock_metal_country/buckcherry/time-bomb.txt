The minute I'm at the backdoor that's the minute there's complication
The second I'm in the action another bonafied bad creation
When it goes down they come around money, greed, the faces
When it falls down they won't be found the spotlight queen chasin
It's coming for you it's coming for me life ain't nothing but bitches and money
Nothing to loose nothing for free can't stop now I got bitches and money
It's a time bomb
The moment I hit the bedroom that's the moment I'm activated
The token I spend to floor ya the less I want to know ya
[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]
The longer I get before ya puts out a blast like a super nova
And if you want a roller coaster just take a slow ride on my shotgun
[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]
BITCHES AND MONEY!
