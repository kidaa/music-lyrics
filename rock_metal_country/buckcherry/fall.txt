Maybe I am lost and complicated, tell me are you sick of it at all, tied down, tore up, threw up, held up, sinking, you take me with you even though your done

[Chorus]
Loving you gave me a heart attack, now I'm this long lost soul left with these empty feelings

Now I'll all I want is just to get you back, cause it's a long life babe and I'll be standing here just to see you fall
Are you dealing with a bad connection, broken down from the love we lost, stand out, hold up, back off, roll up, drinking, you take me with you even though your done

[Chorus]
