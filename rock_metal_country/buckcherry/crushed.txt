Freak out!
Yeah! 
Can you feel it?
It's alive 
Got a phone message call from your sister love
And she likes to pretend that she's taken
Just some sex for the weekend
Take a drive
Down the long winding road passing everyone
And your outstanding friend's still drinking 
And he drinks with a passion
It's not enough for me 
It's all I think about
And now I've seen the light 
It's all in the faces 
Crushed
Come on, yeah! 
Do you mind? 
I'm embarking on plans for destruction
Hell I'm not entertained by the simple life 
And my mama's disgusted 
It's the show 
And the love on the faces of everyone
That makes all this connecting the right thing
And I'm lost in the faces 
It's not enough for me 
It's all I think about
And now I've seen the light 
It's all in the faces, all the faces 
Crushed 
Now the music fans are restless 
As they watch the stage show live
Oh the countdown brings you closer
Underneath the stars 
And when we come they want it loud, yeah 
I love my fucking job!
Oh yeah!
It's not enough for me 
It's all I think about
And now I've seen the light 
It's all in the faces 
It's not enough for me 
It's all I think about
And now I've seen the light 
It's all in the faces 
All the faces, all the faces 
Crushed
Yeah!
Come on you fuckers! 
Crushed
Everybody! 
Everybody! 
Can you feel it
