Wasted youth and mad as hell, my friends keep asking me are you ok man your eyes are blazing
I can't get over it, this shit is killing me my body's aching hands are shaking
I'm cutting down you heard the line, whiskey in the morning one more time, hit that cigarette colt 45, whiskey in the morning can't stop drinking gonna die
I can't stop thinking of where I was before the drugs, a young daydreamer fixed on screaming
Still really love the life, drinking, snorting, smoking eyes super jaded loaded hated
[Chorus]
I go out every night helpless secrets lifeless eyes, tore up faded no give taken
Still really love the life, drinking, snorting, smoking eyes, sweat leaf space case hands are shaking
[Chorus]
Can't stop drinking gonna die!
