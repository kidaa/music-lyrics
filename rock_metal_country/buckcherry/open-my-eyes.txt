Are you strong enough do you feel my touch you are the comfort in my eyes
Moving through the lust feeling dangerous I want to open the door to your life
The steps we take on the way to free our minds
And lives have changed by the way we free our minds
And being with you was the moment I opened my eyes
When you sleep at night are your dreams delight do all your fantasies fill your head
I want to dance with you with the midnight moon one in motion and do it again
[Chorus]
Breathin in breathin out your love
Breathe it in breathe it out my love
Breathin in breathin out your love
Coming closer now to this love we found are you able to take this flight
It's come down to this the first time we kissed like the ocean we sway you and I
[Chorus]
