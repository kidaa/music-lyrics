The counter culture left us with some redness in the eyes
Faded jeans and politics and shooters in the sky
Diagnosed a menus and I'm broken in the mind
The doctor said the Ritalin would surely work out fine
Your always there your always with me you always fill me up
It's scary out there
Your always fair you always miss me you always bring me love
Flower rich emotion and I can't control my mind
A drop of antimatter and I'll blow up all mankind
Maybe I am jaded, or I'm mean or I am blind
Live in fear or God is real there's nothing left to hide
Your always there your always with me you always fill me up
It's scary out there
Your always fair you always miss me you always bring me love
It's not the same living on the edge
I'm not the same so go ahead and ride
Ride, ride, ride
Your always there your always with me you always fill me up
It's scary out there
Your always fair you always miss me you always bring me love
Never be scared
