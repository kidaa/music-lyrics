Dance with me people 
Yeah
The canvas of an open mind 
Well it makes a good mold
I'm taking off on you this time 
Don't be late for the show
We're always laughing and singing and groovin and loving and reaching for more
I can't sleep on it tonight 
But tomorrow will bring more
You know what I'm talking about 
Now here we go
CHORUS
So come and ride 
On the borderline
The timing's right 
Are you satisfied
I thought about a time away 
And I'm taking it slow
It's hard to break away from loving when it feels so good
We're always laughing and singing and grooving and loving and reaching for more
I cannot sleep on it tonight 
But tomorrow will bring more
And he always loves you all, come on now
So come and ride 
On the borderline
The timing's right 
Are you satisfied
