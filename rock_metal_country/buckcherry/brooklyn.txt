Take a flight to London sing my song bring me back to New York that's where I get paid
Dance with the ladies all night long take train to Brooklyn tryin' to get laid
I see your walkin away
Don't be afraid I won't bite hard it's better than being alone
Black out in Brooklyn I'm so hard naked with lady crashed my car
Maxed out all of my credit cards black out in Brooklyn
Brooklyn!
Heading out to Detroit got the call the motor city's jumping maybe I should stay
Curtain calls coming we'll have to stall a red heads finding her way back stage
I see her coming this way
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
I get in I get out jump in a cab at a quarter to midnight
I show up we get down and the party gets started again
[Chorus]
Brooklyn!
