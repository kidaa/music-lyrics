Turning to the right, feel it getting tight
Demand of the heart, my hands rip apart
I'm so afraid, my welcome overstayed
Never find a way to make all this O.K.
Sleepless nights, I am forever awake
Just one taste--won't let it go to waste
The way I feel--Never to reveal
Just one taste-of my own space
Fucking sick of this, hope my tongue don't slip
Familiar trips, loosen up its grip
Instinct never worked anyway, what I've seen I just can't say
My sight's been taken, my eyes betray
Just one taste--won't let it go to waste
The way I feel--Never to reveal
Just one taste-of my own space
My hands at my back, pushing violent acts
The truth an artifact
The rabbit in the hat
Kicking out this make believe
Dedicate a new belief
The risk runs high, but I've gotta try
Hold it all inside, until the day I die
