If it were oh just gone
If it just wasn't there
Would I disappear
Would I even care
Avoid in the arrangement
A blindspot in my mind
A space in what's important
A black hole of some kind
It walks right beside me
Invisible to most
Not an apparition not the holy ghost
Sdumble two another day
Not knowing what is wrong
Not stolen not lost or broken
Been missing for so long
Can't quite find it in me
Fading pulse can I survive
My heart fails me again
Flatlined
But still alive
It walks right beside me
Invisible to most
Not an apparition not the holy ghost
Dragging it behind me,
Can't hold on any more
Slips through my fingers
And scatters on the floor
It hovers right above me
As I move from door to door
When I hang my head in shame
It lies then on the floor
Searching for what I may never know
It's missing I can feel it
Can't just let it go
When I reach out
I can feel it!
It walks right beside me
Invisible to most
Not an apparition not the holy ghost
It hovers right above me
As I move from door to door
When I hang my head in shame
It lies there on the floor
Talks from inside me, silent to most
Not the voice of god
Not the only ghost
Dragging it behind me,
Can't hold on any more
Slips through my fingers
And scatters on the floor
It lies there on the floor
Missing
