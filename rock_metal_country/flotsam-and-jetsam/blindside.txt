What's this, conscience with claws
The protest without the cause
Straight through drawing to the air
Run you over to get it here
Lost in my own insides
Any tool to fix it right
Never free from myself
Always running from myself
Can't see me in my blindside
Stopping tomorrow tonight
Forget about feelings use you like they use me
Can't  even see you in the daylight
Fanatic full of facts tonight
Nothing's free
Anything, corrosive magnet
Dissolving everything within
Can't see me in my blindside
Stopping tomorrow tonight
Blindside they see my blindside
Stopping tomorrow tonight
Got what I wanted to know displaced
Override guy reason to win
Winning's not for everyone
The darkest dirt again
If I turn on my lights out
I won't have to clean my house
I won't have to clean my house
Can't see me in my blindside
Stopping tomorrow tonight
Blindside they see my blindside
Stoppin tomorrow tonight
Can't see me in my blindside
Stopping tomorrow tonight
Blindside they see my blindside
Stoppin tomorrow tonight
