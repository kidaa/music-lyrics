Abused, confused
Fought the blues, no shoes
Still I walk
No place, no face
Broken grin, hollow within
Still I walk
Abandoned my friend
Lost hold pot of gold
Left out cold
Compromise to mend
My demise, my end
Despised again
Standing on the edge of time
Looking down I realize
I am here one final footstep forward
Again seemed right
Follow the light it dimmed
No surprise
Somehow tricked perfect fit
Alibi, two-faced lie
No surprise
By the heels
Suddenly I'm pinned
Forced to kneel choked to heal
Failure failed
This rhyme picked my mind
Out of time
Standing on the edge of time
Looking down I realize
I am here one final footstep forward
End of my speech now is clear
What it is I'm doing here
I am here one final footstep forward
Abused, confused
Fought the blues, no shoes
Still I walk
No place, no face
Broken grin, hollow within
Still I walk
Abandoned my friend
Lost hold pot of gold
Left out cold
Detached, fucking wacked
Needle in, story ends
All depends
Standing on the edge of time
Looking down I realize
I am here one final footstep forward
End of my speech now is clear
What it is I'm doing here
Now I'm here one final footstep forward
Standing on the edge of time
Looking down I realize
I am here one final footstep forward
Standing on the edge of time
Standing on the edge of time
Standing on the edge of time
