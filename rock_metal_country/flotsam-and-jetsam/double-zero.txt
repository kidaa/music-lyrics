Here comes the message from the antennae
Who knows how transmissions came
I've got the license a bag of passports
Even I don't know who I am
Howling bullets fly by so often
I can hear them buzz
I've lived in deserts, I've warred on cities
I don't even know where I was
Remember Israel and Korea
Kuwait's the best time I ever had
Had an accomplice who knew of nothing
I killed the best friend I had
Can't be too careful, can't use computers
They're gonna catch my disease
I work alone don't trust my own mother
Scratched out like ticks and fleas
Dial double zero
Call me whenever you have got a war
Home's where the guns are
My bed's the ammo and no one comes to my door
Dial double zero
Wherever you start a war
More of me going than I've got coming
They'll squeeze my blood through the skin
I shouldn't have wasted my education
The fucking trouble I'm in
I've got your had on, I've got your suitcase
I'm you when you're gone
Out here thinking like 
I'm never me too long
Dial double zero
Call me whenever you have got a war
Home's where the guns are
My bed's the ammo and no one comes to my door
Dial double zero
Wherever you start a war
