I know it seems
Like I like falling
Too glazed to try crawling
Very good at alcoholing
Very good at alcoholing
If I can't get high
Then I can't get by
So I won't be buying it
No, no, no
I guess I don't really care
As long as the juice shows up there
Take a peek in the mirror
To see who's there
I guess I don't really care
If I can't get high
Then I can't get by
So I won't be buying it
No I won't be buying it
If I can't get high
Then I can't get by
So I won't be buying it
No, no, no
They told me it'll thrill ya
Just like the bottle it'll spill ya
The fucking combination'll kill ya
They told me it'll thrill ya
If I can't get high
Then I can't get by
So I won't be buying it
No I won't be buying it
If I can't get high
Then I can't get by
So I won't be buying it
No I won't be buying it
If I can't get high
Then I can't get by
So I won't be buying it
No
