Toast I
Spit on lost reality
Canived underneath the sun
Had to go and drive the needle
Of my mind right through my heart
Absence of thought disturbs me
I've seen me in a dream!
I've lost me in a dream!
Burn II
Longing like a new widow
Wanting to rejoin
Force fed dosed on reality
Indian giver be true or trade away
I've liked me in a dream!
I've loved me in a dream!
Tangled web
Quit wasting my time
Why can't I get back
To where I've never been
Let the flesh
Instruct the mind
Destructive signs
Spaced III
Spend my time counting
The snowflakes in my mind
I never show, even though
You know I know the way
I know the way
I've seen me in a dream!
I've lost me in a dream!
Tangled web
Quit wasting my time
Why can't I get back
To where I've never been
Let the flesh
Instruct the mind
Destructive signs
Lost IV
Sitting here waiting
For myself
I'm late again
That's always certain
As long as I make it back
Make it back
I'm living me in a dream!
I'm lost me in a dream!
Tangled web
Quit wasting my time
Why can't I get back
To where I've never been
Let the flesh
Instruct the mind
Destructive signs
Tangled web
Quit wasting my time
Why can't I get back
To where I've never been
Let the flesh
Instruct the mind
Destructive signs
Let the flesh intruct the mind
