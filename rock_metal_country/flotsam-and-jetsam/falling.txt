I am falling feel the pain
Clear the sidewalk see the stain
I will suffer nevermore
I have found an open door
I will soon have everything I've ever wanted
Revenge on my enemies will they be haunted
No worries, no feelings, no stress or fear
A permanent part of this spot right here
The wind in my face
It screams in my ear
Falling faster no one here
I will soon have time to rest and time to die
A speeding slab of concrete hits me in the eye
Broken bones that I won't get the chance to feel
I'll never cry or bitch or hurt or heal
I'm falling sirens calling
Everyone is watching me
I'm crawling lonliness mauling
Watching over me
I'm falling sirens calling
Everybody's watching me
I'm crawling lonliness mauling
Watching over me
I will soon have everything I've ever wanted
Revenge on my enemies will they be haunted
No worries, no feelings, no stress or fear
A permanent part of this spot right here
I'm falling sirens calling
Everyone is watching me
I'm crawling lonliness mauling
Watching over me
I'm falling sirens calling
Everybody's watching me
I'm crawling lonliness mauling
Watching over me
