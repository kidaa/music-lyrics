Living in dreams, day dreaming
Not in good shape for a life
Can't remember, why I like this feeling
Falling, falling on knives
Words can boost, words can break
Smiling sins can do no wrong
Say something good, if you speak
Good news never last too long
Forget the time too often
And I don't care to get some sleep
It's the skull I aim to soften
From there inside of you I'll creep
What did I expect to find
Dreams are not the same as life
More than the world inside my mind
Dreams empty into my life
What did I expect to find
Dreams are not the same as life
More than the world inside my mind
Dreams empty into my life
Heavy lids closing my eyes
Dreaming of falling asleep again
Blacken my visions of my
Life coming to a bitter end
Now surrounded all by strangers
Strangers I call friends
Help the species help to endanger
Darkness falling to play pretend
Forget the time too often
Inside your skull I aim to creep
See the soft spot in the skull
What did I expect to find
Dreams are not the same as life
More than the world inside my mind
Dreams empty into my life
What did I expect to find
Dreams are not the same as life
More than the world inside my mind
Dreams empty into my life
Heavy lids closing my eyes
Dreaming of falling asleep again
Blacken my visions of my
Life coming to a bitter end
Heavy lids killing my eyes
Dreaming of death in my sleep again
Blacken my visions of my
Life coming to an end
