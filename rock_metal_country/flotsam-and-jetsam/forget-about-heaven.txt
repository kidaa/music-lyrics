When the sun's gone
Then they cry, laughing as they die
They can't look into your eyes
Moonlight makes it all so clear
Peirces the skin without tears
The writing on the wall's been smeared
Tragedy, comedy
Bite the hand that set 'em free
Same old song with a different beat
Comedy, tragedy
Forget about heaven
And the book of fear
Forget about heaven
We're staying here
Getting so high but staying so low
Stumbling, look out below
Halfway's too far to go
Forget about heaven
And the book of fear
Forget about heaven
We're staying here
Beliefs, disaster
Domination by persuasion
Nightmare is after
Your ruined faith beckons grace
Hold their heads down
When kneeling to pray
Heaven lies the other way
Cheated angels turned away
Forget about heaven
And the book of fear
Forget about heaven
We're staying here
Forget about heaven
Forget about heaven
Forget about heaven
