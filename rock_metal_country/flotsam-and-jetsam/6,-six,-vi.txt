Doing the descend, I've been waiting
To step into a dream
It is, it was, it seems
Satan in your stereo, crucifix receptacle
Menace in your muddy eyes, a candy coated fear
Do I remember me, transcending partisan
Hunter and hunted, now one in the same
Vast delirium, multitudes of attitude
T.V. is your brain
Vile, greasy vermin nicotine scars
Cheap, lethal bourbon, my refuge in the bar
Open mind defended, seen through a filtered lens
Gaze upon the symbolism, I wanna know what the message sends
Warfare concealed a symbolism, a martyr for your daughter
Stigmatised in my holy  water, 666
Is it threatening as it seems
Sometimes there's nothing left to tell
Sometimes I can't understand myself
No, no single key, to calculated spontaneity
Confusion, illusion
What use sanity
Battering down the walls built inside of me
Battering down...
Passing me through revolving doors
Your will whole of the law
Doors in your mind unwind, unwind
Symbol in your muddy eyes words are dismissable
Nothing is true, all is permissible
Open mind defended, seen through a filtered lens
Sometimes There's nothing  left to tell
Sometimes I can't understand myself
No, no single key, to calculated spontaneity
Confusion, illusion
What use sanity
Battering down the walls built inside of me
Battering down the walls built inside of me
Battering down...
