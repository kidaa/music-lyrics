If you had a cure for the epidemic of today
Would you hold it ransom or give it all away
Will you be willing to do what's right when proven wrong
Will you be swept away or will you come along
Are you willing
The trend is now searching for the mighty midas touch
Walking on a broken leg and you can't find a crutch
If you find the missing piece the answers of a lasting peace
You have found nothing's ever changed
Are you willing
Are you willing
Yell out to the world echo never comes
I look into myself to see how colour runs
If you knew what I know do you think we all should share
Everybody's got a cross to bear
Ask and ask the same old riddle
My finger's in my ears touch in the middle
The trick's been played, life's slight of hand
Answers come so slowly, no matter the demand
Are you willing - to let logic go
Are you willing - to forget what you don't know
Go ahead and fantasize a calm in your own mind
You've got to let go to get a piece that really binds
Scratch the itch scratching at the heart 
Use the soul's glue to keep from coming all apart
Out of your head when emotions start to think
Let feelings flow hard bring yourself to the brink
Filled your bags with what we don't talk about
The questions the answers drown yourself in doubt
Are you willing - to let logic go
Are you willing - to forget what you don't know
Are you willing - to let logic go
Are you willing to forget what you don't know
