Wake the master
Is all you survey
Pictures down the well of my thoughts
In settled dust they're hidden away
Forced down the yellow pills then I stepped into the screen
God were you sleeping so you couldn't hear their screams
God were you sleeping, something feels so strange
When I open my eyes wide you fade away, you fade away
Reflections on this wall consume the tides consuming me
Rejuvinated and cold reasons ripped apart, man bought an d sold
I open doors never chosen for me
Lost my sense of reality
Now I'm free like a rat in a cage
Sleeping God You're a stranger to me
Now I know my place in life as time devours me more each day
Sands will sift away, our time slips away
Can you feel it slipping away, you're growing older day by day
Now I know my place in life and it devours me more each day, no, no
