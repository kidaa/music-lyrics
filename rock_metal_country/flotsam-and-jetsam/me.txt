I feel guilty about being alive
I've been hiding in the basement of my mind
If I don't keep moving
My feet will fall asleep
It gets a little harder
When the snow's so deep
What I take I take on the chin
They keep asking hey what's wrong with him
I look alone
But there's a crowd I see
And I know you can't tell
Which one is me
If I don't keep moving
My feet will fall asleep
It gets a little harder
When the snow's so deep
Waiting for my help!
Hope you can hold your breath
Not doing anything that's what I do best
Which one is me
I look alone
But there's a crowd I see
And I know you can't tell
Which one is me
