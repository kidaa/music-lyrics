I skinned hope, then cut the rope
And watched you fall into my show
Thought I cared, feeling impaired
Cut yourself when no one cared
I'm calling out, attention mounts
This stowaway's ship is going down
Been running blind, running behind
Just very violently killing time
All I want from you is another round
Slamming faster just to hit the ground
Tip another glass just to get me loose
Tying on another big liquid noose
Served on ice, serving you sliced
Ground up men or were they mice
When it gets way down, to nothing or not
Way beneath less than what you've got
All I want from you is another round
Slamming faster just to hit the ground
Tip another glass just to get me loose
Tying on another big liquid noose
Round my neck, round my back
Swallow hard as the end's attached
Here's blood in your eye, the tension taken
Who are you to say that I'm forsaken
All I want from you is another round
Slamming faster just to hit the ground
Tip another glass just to get me loose
Tying on another big liquid noose
All I want from you is another round
Slamming faster just to hit the ground
Tip another glass just to get me loose
Tying on another big liquid noose
Liquid Noose
