Slip into the realms of the eight hour grip
She notioned to tangle she mentioned a trip
A place far, far away, like the sky on a cloudy day
Slipping through that secret maze
It creeps with time
She'll be mine
To fantasize
Through her eyes
LAUGH thru my tears, let go all the fears
That consume you in her universe
LAUGHTER splits my mind, nothing in the way
Run with your knotted situation
Through the door an endless playground
Intensity the hum in your head
LAUGH thru my tears, let go all the fears
That consume you in her universe
LAUGHTER splits my mind, nothing in the way
Go with your knotted situation
Through the door an endless playground
Intensity hums in your head
Sands go ticking by, It's almost over
Your sunken thought, time to dry the spill in your brain
Absorbed in conscience
Released thru sweat
As the last taste of her
As the last trace of her
Spins away
LAUGH thru my tears, let go all the fears
That consume you in her universe
LAUGHTER splits my mind, nothing in the way
Tense with your knotted situation
LAUGH thru my tears, let go all the fears
That consume you in her universe
LAUGHTER splits my mind, nothing in the way
Stress with your knotted situation
