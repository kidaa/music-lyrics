Wolves devour
The full moon heart
Screams bloodless howls
And starves for the dawn 
As teeth and Jaw 
Sink in like needles 
There's no love lost
For a helpless pawn
Taking care of business
Selling rock candy and suicide
The message
In the battle of the colors
Eyes for eyes, brothers for brothers
Taking care of business
Selling rock candy and suicide
Buying low and selling high
Business booms when cold lead flies
The message
Delivered every day 
The message 
Tribal, primal, criminal
Old men backing out of heart attacks
Send the young ones back to do a man's job
To the fire and water
The best man's daughter weds the wings of the dragonfly
Taking care of business
Selling rock candy and suicide
Buying low and selling high
Business booms when cold lead flies
The message
Delivered every day
The message
Tribal, primal, criminal
The message
Delivered every day
The message
Tribal, primal, criminal
