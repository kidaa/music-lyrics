Your life passes you by, I live, you die.
The arena is mine, I live, you die.
Entry of the gladiators, 264 B.C.
The emperors and nobles have made a pawn of me.
I battle slaves end free men and wild blood thirsty beasts.
The red sand surrounds me, so they can't see them bleed.
chorus: 
Your life passes you by I live you die.
The Reaper is near.
Again the arena is mine I live you die.
I live you die.
Sword drawn and battle ready, Trajan in command.
Fight 'till death 100 days, corpses of 2000 men.
The masses they decide the fate of a fallen men.
Thumbs down in drunken haste, life's taker and giver I am.
repeat chorus
Innocent children dressed like the sacred lamb,
Taken for Nero's-slaughter, as the people look away,
To the pit dogs they are prey, the people look away... they look away...
I live, you die!
Persecuted Christians in the blood soaked ring.
Many over many lose their lives, peace to their soul it brings.
The thrills from the kills, those that I have slain,
Are keeping my heart pounding, I live another day.
Your live passes you by I live you die.
The Reaper is near.
Again the arena is mine I live you die.
I live again.
Your live passes you by I live you die.
The Reaper is near.
Again the arena is mine I live you die.
I live you die.
Die! Die! Die!
