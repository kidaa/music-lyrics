Pusher, pushing a dream
Go ahead and pick a scarecrow clean
One long season mean
Or just letting off steam
Only scratched it twice
Made it bleed real nice
Bloody, body filled with bullet holes
Your eyes are black like coals
Wrapped around a pole
You have what I stole
Old fashioned cocaine
Standing on my brain
Gone tomorrow, here today
I never saw what hit me
It will all rumble away
I never heard a thing
Gone tomorrow, here today
Cutting into line again
Cutting it close in between
Laughing cause you're funny choking
Laughing cause you're turning blue
Laugh all the way to the bank
One less asshole acts like you
Gone tomorrow, here today
I never saw what hit me
It will all crumble away
I never heard a thing
Gone tomorrow, here today
One less asshole man, hahaha
