Everybody's watching, none of them I've ever met
Starring in the headlines no good news is death
Threats fly through the airmail, e-mail and express
Fax instructions for the bomb
A bone breaking game of chess
Starved and banged what a way to go
Slit wristed, run over and hanged
What a way to go
Pushed too far by numbers
Payments way past due
Additional tack on late charge
Who'll be screwing who
Screwed my head so tightly
Feels like it's gonna snap at the neck
If you're gonna cheat with your own cards
At least you could shuffle the deck
Starved and banged what a way to go
Slit wristed, run over and hanged
What a way to go
Starved and banged what a way to go
Slit wristed, run over and hanged
What a way to go
Sweat it out in walls that both my shoulders touch
If I hadn't lost everything else
My mind wouldn't matter so much
Backed up on a pay way, free way, blue lights closing fast
I was promised before my eyes
I'd see my life flashing past
Starved and banged what a way to go
Slit wristed, run over and hanged
What a way to go
Starved and banged what a way to go
Slit wristed, run over and hanged
What a way to go
