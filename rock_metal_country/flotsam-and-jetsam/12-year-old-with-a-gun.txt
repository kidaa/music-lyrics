Hey kids where you been
I hope not killing again
What's that I see in your coat
What's that scar from on your throat
Fill yourself ruin anybodies life
I smoke a lot, but never got that high
On life putting on a price
Not worth anything take what you like
I hope you like what you see
So you there's no reason to point that gun at me
I'll fix it all with a gun
Right or wrong can't be undone
A bullet changes everything
Hear the echo of the shots that ring
Should have only had to look
Through the playground bars
Never thought what you'd end up seein'
Would be so hard!
I'll fix it all with a gun
Right or wrong can't be undone
A bullet changes everything
Hear the echo of the shots that ring
I'll fix it all with a gun
Right or wrong can't be undone
A bullet changes everything
Hear the echo of the shots that ring
