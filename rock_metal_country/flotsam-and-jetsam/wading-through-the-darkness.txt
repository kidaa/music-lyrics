Put a gun to my head
The storm's too deep outlook dead
Handing down that anger
Nothing good ever lasts
Moody violence
Now a fool in my eyes
What's the answer, I'll search till I die
Try a little harder I hear myself say
Make it last before it's taken away
Wading through the darkness
 My head held in my hands
Wading through the darkness
Forced to forget this anguish
I'm half of what I used to be
Erase my memory
Now gone forever goodbye
But I know my memories won't die
Wading through the darkness
 My head held in my hands
Wading through the darkness
Dead inside with a heart that bleeds
Relax my tension needs
Tightness suffocates
Too dense to focus
I'll see it through the day
No longer churning inside
Rotted memories inhabit my mind
My rage destroys the calm
Destroys the calm
Wading through the darkness
 My head held in my hands
Wading through the darkness
