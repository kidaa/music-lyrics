Newspaper blanket covers my view
But I still get the story through
The more people that I meet
The less friends that I keep
Words roll off my tongue like spit
I reighin again get used to it
The dust you kicked about
Ended up in my mouth
I don't care what they say
As long as they remember me
What they all think of me now is
All that I'll ever be
I'm sinking taking everyone down
Remember what I spoke
I'm throwing in the towel now
To stuff it down your throat
I don't care what they say
As long as they remember me
What they all think of me now is
All that I'll ever be
I'm sinking taking everyone down
Remember what I spoke
I'm throwing in the towel now
To stuff it down your throat
I don't care what they say
As long as they remember me
What they all think of me now is
All that I'll ever be
I'm sinking taking everyone down
Remember what I spoke
I'm throwing in the towel now
To stuff it down your throat
