A young maiden with a demon in her soul,
A twisted mind with secrets to unfold.
An innocent face, a deceiving smile,
Under no suspicion, servant to Belial.
The axe came down...Blood all around...
She lurks possessed, without a sound,
Butchers her Dam when no one is around.
The next day her Sire feels her wrath,
She has no remorse in her merciless bloodbath.
CHORUS
She's Miss Lizzy, she feels no pain
The axe came down
She's Miss Lizzy, she strikes again,
The axe came down...Blood all around
REFRAIN
Lizzy Borden took an axe, gave her mother forty whacks,
When she saw what she had done, she gave her father forty-one.
REPEAT REFRAIN
REPEAT REFRAIN
Now before the jury with a solemn face,
These legendary murders...she left not a trace.
Lizzy found it so simple to take their lives,
Today she walks free...Axe by her side...
CHORUS
She took an axe.
