A shotgun up against my eye
They're kicking my door in
Why this time
I thought they had theirs and I had mine
Lights going on and off
Sirens blazing
I wonder who they're chasing
It's on me
I can't see
What you see
It's on me
All those shots died from a broken heart
Got to end before getting to start
Unknowing sleeping birds cats love to tear apart
Lights going on and off
Sirens blazing
They're driving me fucking crazy
A shotgun up against my eye
I think it's my turn now to die
Lights going on and off
Sirens blazing
I'm wondering who they're chasing
It's on me
I can't see
What you see
It's on me
It's on me
I can't see
What you see
It's on me
