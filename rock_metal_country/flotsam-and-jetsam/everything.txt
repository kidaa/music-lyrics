I felt the moon today
Everything is drawn away
Water splashes on my skin it makes me dry
It makes no sense at all
Why didn't I get a call
When the whole world knew but me
There was nothing left to see
Everything reminds me
Of something from my past
Everything I know is in the past
And everything I see is now
Friends are friends until the end
How soon will it end today
Friends are friends close by
How soon they're gone away
An old man tries to run me off
As he stops to wheeze and cough
I seize the fruit
And steal his day away
Everything reminds me
Of something from my past
Everything I know is in the past
And everything I see is now
Everything I know is in the past
And everything I see is now
Everything I know is in the past
And everything I see is now
Everything I know is in the past
And everything I see is now
I saw the moon today
Everything just melts away
The sun beats upon my skin it makes me sweat
It makes no sense at all
Why didn't I hear the call
When the whole world saw but me
There was no where left to be
Everything reminds me
Of something from my past
Everything I know is in the past
And everything I see is now
Everything I know is in the past
And everything I see is now
Everything I know is in the past
And everything I see is now
Everything I know is in the past
And everything I see is now
Everything I know is in the past
And everything I see is now
Everything I see is, everything I see is, everything I see is now
