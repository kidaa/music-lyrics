I've already been to heaven
So I might as well step down
Up seems like a real good offer
But I'm gonna have to turn it down
Losing heart
Wondering if it's worth saving
Well at least what remains
After it hits the pavement
I just had to make sure
You knew I was sincere
Trains change
They jump the tracks
They almost always 
Switch back
Once again it's just me
The smoking empty shotgun shell
So close to a dream you can't touch
My very own version of hell
Playing tables and gambling
Bad hands of cards
Running out of crosswalks
Betting on the oddest odds
I just had to make sure
You knew I was sincere
Trains change
They jump the tracks
They almost always 
Switch back
I've changed
I've jumped the tracks
I almost always switch back
I just had to make sure
You knew I was sincere
I've already been to heaven
So they asked me to step down
Up was a real good offer
But I screwed up big and turned it down
Lost heart
Knowing it's not worth saving
No usable remains
After it hits the pavement
I just had to make sure
You knew I was sincere
Trains change
They jump the tracks
They almost always 
Switch back
I've changed
I've jumped the tracks
I almost always switch back
Trains change
They jump the tracks
They almost always 
Switch back
You've changed
You've jumped the tracks
You've almost always switched back
And now I know for sure
You knew I was sincere 
I just had to make sure
You knew I was sincere
I just had to make sure
You knew I was sincere
