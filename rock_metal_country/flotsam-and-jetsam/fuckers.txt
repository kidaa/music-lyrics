Righteous fucks
You think you are on top of the world
The little people spit down on you
You'll feel trying to look yourself in the eyes
Bleed you fuckers bleed
Die you fuckers die
I'll cut all your fuckin throats
So brace your fuckin self
Go right ahead you worthless gem, enjoy the laugh 
I hope you choke on yourself in the end
You'll never get up on me
I won't subscribe 
And I'll recognize
How fucked up you really are
The way you love to be
Self-centered selfish piece of shit
Another morning shows and nothing changes
You're death in everyone's eyes,
You'd be lucky to die
You fucked up everyone's life,
That comes as no surprise
You have to be taken out,
Instead you stay alive
You thrive on breaking their lives
Your feel tries to poke me in the eyes
Entertaining yourself
Makes you closer to hell
You're death in everyone's eyes,
You'd be lucky to die
You fucked up everyone's life,
That comes as no surprise, no surprise
You're death in everyone's eyes
You fucked up everyone's life
You have to be taken out,
Instead you stay alive
Worthless, useless, no good gimp  
Another faceless, vileless pile
You're miserable, despicable, dismal, lovable, intolerable
And you don't give a shit
I despise, you despise, you recognize, gouge your eyes
Ah fuck you
Devil eyes, two lies in her eyes, visualize parasites,
A blacker demise 
You're still a righteous fuck
Now down at the bottom of the world
Looking at everyone spit down on you
And there's nothing you can fuckin do
You're death in everyone's eyes,
You'd be lucky to die
You fucked up everyone's lives,
That comes as no surprise, no surprise
You're death in everyone's eyes
You fucked up everyone's lives
Make no mistakes about it
This time you're dead
