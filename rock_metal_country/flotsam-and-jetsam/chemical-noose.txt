You think that everyone's against you
You think the world's a conspiracy
Life is a movie about you
We're all supporting your lead
You've been up for a week or two
You've done everything with nothing to do
Eyes so big how do you see
You've lost all your personality
Spun Vacation, Chemical Noose
Completely lost and right in front of me
Can't go to work, gotta stay clean
Spinning in circles take a soma
Now revive in a coma
Can't find any, can't find none
Oh my god the vacation's done
Wish you had a little bump to smoke
You smell the punchline and don't get the joke
Don't pick up the phone don't get the door
Gotta pick your face and do some more
Hallucination entertaining you
Wish you could eat, sleep, or find something to do
Fly, like a sigh
No way to save yourself inside
Sleep, like it's time
Try to remind yourself
One more time
Sleep, like it's time
No way to hold it down
It's time to die
Spun Vacation, Chemical Noose
Broken Headlight, Chemical Noose
