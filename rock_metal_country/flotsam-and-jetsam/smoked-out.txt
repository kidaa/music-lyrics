I come to you for guidance
I come to you for help
You just see a bright idea
To benefit yourself
You know that there's no risk
Nothing you should dread
On to your deception
This view of wool delights my head
Finally I realize what you're all about
Time to pull out all the stops
Don't make me spell it on
All I know is what I'd do
If I was in your shoes
Nothing close to what you've done
Nothing close to what you do
Tell me that I'm failing
Hold me under thumb
Pay off my emotions made
Blind deaf dumb
Another hole in the bucket
Where it's wet you're gonna slide
Can't walk down the middle without
Slipping off the side
Smoked out peeled back unearthed
The real you washes ashore
I come to your for guidance
I come to call a truce
You take the rope I climb and tie at in a noose
Ask my permission
To ask my permission
Don't even take a breath unless I know
Tell me that I'm failing
Hold me under thumb
Pay off my emotions made
Blind deaf dumb
Another hole in the bucket
Where it's wet you're gonna slide
Can't walk down the middle without
Slipping off the side
Smoked out peeled back unearthed
The real you washes ashore
I come to you for guidance
I come to call a truce
You take the rope I climb and tie at in a noose
Finally I realize what you're all about
Now pack your shit and get the fuck out
You will make it up to me
You will make amends
Will will not be family
And we can not be friends
I realize what you're all about
Now pack your shit and get the fuck out
Tell me that I'm failing
Hold me under thumb
Pay off my emotions made
Blind deaf dumb
Another hole in the bucket
Where it's wet you're gonna slide
Can't walk down the middle without
Slipping off the side
Smoked out peeled back unearthed
The real you washes ashore
