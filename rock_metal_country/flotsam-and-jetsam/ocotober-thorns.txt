What was it, something that I realized
A need inside me took me by surprise
I see two sides now, I just don't know
Subjected now an addict of control
Mirror yourself if you can even try
Gaze deep into God's sleepy eye
Arabesques in my cold burn freeze
Deliverance upon my dirty knees
Dominator life's blood, my need
The balance in my hands, the life blood seed
Underneath a hood of stars, I realized just who you are
Ooh, my October thorns in my side
It makes me wonder will the need subside
You miscalculated the algebra of need
I died for you, now why shouldn't you return the favor
You've come to learn junkie of control
The more you push the stuff, the more it flows
Twist the plot of demand supply
A grim reflection of both you and I
Now I know just who you really are
I realized just who I really am
Now I now just who I really am
