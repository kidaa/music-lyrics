Damned right out of paradise
It's all right between the eyes
We are all the same at birth
And at the end of a knife
To the grave had it made
Ignorant but mighty brave
No matter how tight the choke
They'll misbehave
Natural enemies
The trouble with you is the trouble with me
Natural enemies
You'll never hear heaven and nature sing
See no evil or the good
The whole world one neighborhood
A backwards in reverse
Modern day Robin hood
Everyday lived in suspense
Introductions so intense
Making deals without ever making sense
Natural enemies
The trouble with you is the trouble with me
Natural enemies
You'll never hear heaven and nature sing
For what you know you had to spy
Help to commit suicide
The prize head hanging on the wall
And glorified
The only way to win the game 
Is to leave it all the same
Your introduction into
History's hall of shame
Natural Enemies
The trouble with you is the trouble with me
Natural enemies
You'll never hear heaven and nature sing
