How much time will it take
Till I know how much longer
How many beatings do I have to take
Till I know I am stronger
How much space will it take
Till I know where I am
How many times do I have to do
Before I know I can
How much wasted energy is flowing through your head
How many cells must die before you're legally 
Brain dead
How much wasted energy is flowing through your mind
How many cells must die before you're legally 
Brain dead this time
How much farther do I have to go
Before I know I'm there
How many tears do I have to shed
Before I show I care
How much brightness can I stand
Before I see the light
How many wrongs must I have to do
Before I get it right
How much wasted energy is flowing through your head
How many cells must die before you're legally 
Brain dead
How much wasted energy is flowing through your mind
How many cells must die before you're legally 
Brain dead this time
How much space will I waste
Till I know where I am
How many times do I have to do 
Before I know I can
How much wasted energy is flowing through your head
How many cells must die before you're legally 
Brain dead
How much wasted energy is flowing through your mind
How many cells must die before you're finally dead, you're finally dead
How much wasted energy is flowing through your mind
How many cells must die before you're legally
Brain dead this time
Brain dead this time
Brain dead this time
