Fractured chess game knights move
Chaos no point to prove
I've been changing my open mind
Self defensive intentions you'll never find
Deviation detour your moral code
You Understand I refuse to play the role
Say have a seat, I think I'll stand
Stained glass here I come with brick in hand
No explanations, for my deviation
I'll give no explanation, for my deviation
See me, are you surprised
I symbolize all you despise
Never, never your faithful pawn
You run your rat race, it's that I spit upon
No explanations for my deviation
I'll give no explanations, for my deviation
No explanation for my deviation
