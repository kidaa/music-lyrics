Feeling shellshocked
Barbedwire, I'm torn apart
Warheads dead ends
Parties only we attend
The runaround, out of ground
Your god damned sympathy
Wears me down!
I've spent my life
Reaching out to empty air
Slipping faster all the time
But no one seems to care!
Concrete breaks my fall
Trouble ten stories tall
Sunshine, I can't sleep
Just like my life on TV
Church bells drowning me out
My ears ring, your favorite sound!
Clench my fists to strands
That really don't exist
I try not to fool myself
But still I cant resist!
I've spent my life
Reaching out to empty air
Slipping faster all the time
But no one seems to care!
Clench my fists to strands
That really don't exist
I try not to fool myself
But still I cant resist!
Blood born my loss
Nailed to more than
Just a cross
Driven hard, brick fence
My twenty first second chance
Shellshocked
Barbedwire
Warheads
Your god damned sympathy
Concrete ten stories tall
Feeling shellshocked
Empty air
Empty air
