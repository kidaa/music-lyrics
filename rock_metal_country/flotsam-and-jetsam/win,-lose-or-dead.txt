Pouring bones from a skull salt shaker
Squaring off all pro mistakers
High stakes diets that used to be a face
Now we've seen there's two dark sides to this race
Heaven's flippin for dinner
Dying to be thin
Make the weight to run and die again
Numbers on your back and numbers on your head
Numbers in your mind add up to 
Win, lose or dead
Numbers on your back and numbers on your head
Numbers in your mind add up to 
Win, lose or dead
Hard to give up
What took lifetimes to achieve
Watching horses die toasting in bubbly grieve
Every race a run right for their lives
Broken, dragged and bleeding
The winners cross the line
Why eat can't keep nothing down but spirits
Screaming at the top of lungs
Too soaked to hear it
Numbers on your back and numbers on your head
Numbers in your mind add up to 
Win, lose or dead
Numbers on your back and numbers on your head
Numbers in your mind add up to 
Win, lose or dead
Numbers on your back and numbers on your head
Numbers in your mind add up to 
Win, lose or dead
Numbers on your back and numbers on your head
Numbers in your mind add up to 
Win, lose or dead
What's making you run through a wet track
Running in circles you'll never make it back
All your fans won't love you if you don't win
You never think about after
Till after you begin
Pick a number, play it once again
Thank you very much, come back again
Numbers on your back and numbers on your head
Numbers in your mind add up to 
Win, lose or dead
Numbers on your back and numbers on your head
Numbers in your mind add up to 
Win, lose or dead
Win, lose or dead
Win, lose or dead
