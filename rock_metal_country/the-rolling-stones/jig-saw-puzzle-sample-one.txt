There's a tramp sittin' on my doorstep
Tryin to waste his time
with his mentholated sandwich
He's a walking clothes line
And here comes the bishops daughter
On the other side
She looks a triffle jeolous
She's been an outcast all her life 

Me, I'm waiting so patiently
Lying on the floor
I'm just trying to do my jig-saw puzzle
Before it rains anymore 

Oh the gangster looks so frightning
with his luger in his hand
when he gets home to his children
he's a family man
but when it comes to the nitty-gritty
he can shove in his knife
Yes he really looks quite religious
He's been an outlaw all his life 

Me, I'm waiting so patiently
Lying on the floor
I'm just trying to do this jig-saw puzzle
Before it rains anymore 

Me, I'm waiting so patiently
Lying on the floor
I'm just trying to do this jig-saw puzzle
Before it rains anymore 

Oh the singer, he looks angry
At being thrown to the lions
And the bass player, he looks nervous
About the girls outside
And the drummer, he was shattered
Trying to keep up time
And the guitar players look damaged
They've been outcasts all thier lives 

Me, I'm waiting so patiently
Lying on the floor
I'm just trying to do this jig-saw puzzle
Before it rains anymore 

And as twenty thousand grandma's
Waving thier hankies in the air
All burning up their pensions
And shouting,  It's not fair! 
There's a regiment of soldiers
Standing looking on
And the queen is bravely shouting,
 What the Hell is going on  

With a blood-curdling  tally-ho 
She charged into the ranks
And blessed all those grandma's who
With their dying breaths screamed,  Thanks!  

Me, I'm waiting so patiently
With my woman on the floor
We're just trying to do this jig-saw puzzle
Before it rains anymore
