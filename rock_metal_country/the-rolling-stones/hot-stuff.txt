'Cause music is what I want
To keep my body always movin' yeah
Shake it up
Hot stuff
Ev'ry day I need another dose
I can't stand it when the music stops
Hot stuff 

Everybody on the dance floor
You know what I'm talking about
Music make you forget all your troubles
Make you sing and make it tell the whole wide world
So what, hot stuff, shake it up 

I want to tell all my friends in London
There ain't nothing wrong with you
But you'd better shape up
Shake it up, you're hot stuff
All the people in New York City
I know you're going broke
But I know you're tough
Yeah, you're hot stuff, hot stuff 

To everybody in Jamaica that's working in the sun
You're hot, you're hot, you're hot stuff
Shake it up, shake it up
Hot stuff, hot stuff
