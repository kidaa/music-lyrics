Take me to the station and put me on a train
I've got no expectations to pass through here again
Once I was a rich man and now I am so poor
But never in my sweet, short life have I felt like this before 

Your heart is like a diamond, you throw your pearls at swine
And as I watch you leaving me, you pack my peace of mind 

Our love was like the water that splashes on a stone
Our love was like our music, it's here and then it's gone
So take me to the airport and put me on a plane
I've got no expectations to pass through here again
