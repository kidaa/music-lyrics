Parachute woman, land on me tonight
Parachute woman, land on me tonight
Well, I'll break big in New Orleans
and I'll overspill in Caroline 

Parachute woman, join me for a ride
Parachute woman, join me for a ride
I'll make my blow in Dallas 
and get hot again in half the time 

Parachute woman, will you blow me out
Parachute woman, will you blow me out
My heavy throbbers itchin'
just to lay a solo rhytm down
