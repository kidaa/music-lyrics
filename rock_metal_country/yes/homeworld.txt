Nothing can take us far enough
Emotion... far enough together
As the light shines so bright
Bright enough to let us in

Nothing can bridge our souls'
Devotion... fast enough together
As the power proves you right
Right enough to let you begin 

So many displaced among the future dreamers 
Realised their doubles
Took a new step
A question of origin

Only in the recent past
Seeking for to realise
Skyward shone 
Like beacons 
A question of origin

Ten thousand millions free
To the westward light
The dreamers represent
This arc of peace

As the poets entranced
The anchor redeemed
Secrets of science
The history of the future
Was surely made

Just what keeps us so alive
Just what makes us realise
Our home
Is our world, our life
Home is our world

Nothing can take us far enough
Emotion... far enough together
As the light shines so bright
Bright enough to let us in

Nothing can bridge our souls
Devotion... fast enough together
As the power proves you right
Right enough to let you begin 

Speak so fast to the prophets
Of the living
Looking for the signs
Spanning out the centuries
Search for truthAncient ones... they watch    
And listen
Carry our wishes
Took upon themselves to guide us
Through the endless skies

Just what keeps us so alive
Just what makes us realise
Our home
Is our world, our life
Our hope is our world, our life

I have seen the passion
That's in the hope that everyone
Will find their way into
The secret of
The home of your heart

Living within the vision
Within the power, beyond belief
We see that hate destroys the soul
Of anyone who tries to teach it

I have seen the dream
That's in your heart
That's in your eyes
To bring you closer to the one     

It's what keeps us so alive
It's what makes us realise
Our home is our world, our life
Just what keeps us so alive
Just what makes us realise
Our home
Is our world, our life
Home is our world, our life

Send, ascending to the secrets
All is pure and clear to resolve
Nothing can change us now
Send, ascending to the future
Nothing can ever change us now 
We follow the sun 
We follow the sun
We follow the sun

Truth is a simple place
Here for us all to see
Reach as it comes to you 
As it comes to me
As I will always need you inside my heart

Peace  is a word we teach
A place for us all to reach
Sing as it sings to you
As it sings to me
As I will always need you inside my heart
