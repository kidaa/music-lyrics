In the street where we live there's a place called desire.
There's a stone-cold intrusion of mad man's fire,
But he leaves when the lust and desire released,
And you're left with an empty room in peace.

Saving my heart for you - You do what you want to do
There's a place in my heart for you - This time I'm watching you
Till the blood in my veins run dry - I'll be there to testify
There's a place in my heart for you...

I've been lost in the maze of emotional confound.
I believe that you knew our faith was secure;
How you kept up your smile with a cool disposition,
Are you stocking the fire with a new sense of reason...

You tell me to take it easy, but it's not my style.
There's something around the corner; it'll pass you by.
I wanna hold you closer to connect my fortunes.
I wannt take you higher, taking off like we did before.
