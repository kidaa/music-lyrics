Julie's sick and tired of her job n'all the reasons lately
She took it out on God and laid her soul to hell and let the baby die
Julie's child was born without a need or a reason for being
She took it as a message from a real and a distant life

Shirley gets to help her with the child though
she's strung out on crack time
Shirley never knew what it was to be held in real love
Together getting high to get to mess up their night
Anything to get up so they're losing their mind
Just to get high, breking out from this life, gotta get them a drug to get
higher

Julie gets to walking out and drags the child, says ";come on";
How we'll walk in the dark of the morning
Cars screaming round the corner, drugged to heaven,
guns are loaded,
locked in vengeance

Who shoots the child?

Watching in the ghetto is the spine and the cruel of the gang life
Sign language of the get go you get in the gang life
Fear the only law, fear is all we hear about,
Feed us in the raw, fear is all we fear about
Listen, get up, quickly get up, get up
It's the answer to punishment given you

Don't give us reasons,
Caught in the crossfire dying
God give us reasons,
Don't give a reason, God give a reason
Why lay dead a child's life?
