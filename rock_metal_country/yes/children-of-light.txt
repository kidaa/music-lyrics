a  Children Of Light
Anderson/Vangelis/Squire

Distant as the distant thunder
Where equal rights for [will] rent assunder
Equal rights for equal people
[This]  Disregard for love's equality

Bringing back the signs to no-man's land
Where diamonds and gold in hand
Will barter as the homeless burn
Someday will it be our turn?

Why this consciousness this desire 
To expand the flame of revolution
With a [the]  gothic hand in [of]  fire persecution
Blood-letting and [in] spinning pain?

Why this hungry media delivering
Questions answers blessed forgivers [plus forgive us]
Millions of racial inequalities
We all are one 
All are sacred

Be the birth of a nation 
Stop this aggravation
So uninspired
And [to] question man's inhumanity
And lack of love for his cosmic god

Children of light  Don't be afraid
Children of light  Haven't you heard
Gone are the days  In black and white
Children of light  Don't be afraidDistant as the distant thunder
Where equal rights for [will] rent assunder
Equal rights for equal people
[This]  Disregard for love's equality

Bringing back the signs to no-man's land
Where diamonds and gold in hand
Will barter as the homeless burn
Someday will it be our turn?

Someday will it be our turn?
Someday will it be our turn?

Children of light  Don't be afraid
Children of light  Haven't you heard
Gone are the days  In black and white
Children of light  Don't be afraid
