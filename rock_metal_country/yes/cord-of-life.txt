Anderson/Bruford/Howe/Squire
A man conceived a moment's answers to the dream,
Staying the flowers daily, sensing all the themes.
As a foundation left to create the spiral aim,
A movement regained and regarded both the same,
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you.

Changed only for a sight of sound, the space agreed.
Between the picture of time behind the face of need,
Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid,
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid,
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you.
Oh.

Turn round tailor,                                
Assaulting all the mornings of the                
Interest shown,                                   
Presenting one another to the cord,               
All left dying, rediscovered                      
Of the door that turned round,                    
To close the cover,                               
All the interest shown,                           
To turn one another, to the sign                  
At the time                                       
To float your climb.                              

Coins and
Crosses
Never know
Their fruitless worth;
Cords are broken,
Locked inside
the mother earth.
They won't
Hide, hold, they won't
Tell you, watching the world,
Watching all of the world,
Watching us go by.                                                  

And you and I climb over the sea to the valley,
And you and I reached out for reasons to call.
