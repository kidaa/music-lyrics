SURITIS:  The Remembering.  All our thoughts, impressions, knowledge, fears,
have been developing for millions of years.  What we can relate to is our own
past, our own life, our own history.  Here, it is especially Rick's keyboards
which bring alive the ebb and flow and depth of our mind's eye; the
topographic ocean.  Hopefully we should appreciate that given points in time
are not so significant as the nature of what is impressed on the mind, and how
it is retained and used.


As the silence of the seasons on we relive abridge sails afloat
As to call light to the soul shall sing of the velvet sailors' course on
Of the velvet sailors' course on
Shine or moons send me memories trail over days of forgotten tales
Course the compass to offer into a time we've all seen on
Into a time we've all seen on

High the memory carry on
While the moments start to linger
Sail away among your dreams
The strength regains us in between our time
The strength regains us in between our time

As we shall speak to differ also the ends meet the river's on
So the ends meet the river's son

Ours the story shall we carry on
And search the forest of the sun
We dream as we dream! Dream as one
And I do think very well
That the song might take you silently
They move fast
They tell me
There's someone rainbow
Alternate tune

In the days of summers so long
We danced as evenings sang their song
We wander out the days so long
And I do feel very well
That the evenings take you
Silently, they move round
Sunlight, seeing ground
Whispers of clay
Alternate ways

Softer messages bringing light to a truth long forgotten on
As we shall speak todiffer also the ends meet the river's son
So the ends meet the river's son

I reach over and the fruit of life stands still
Stand awhile we search our past we start anew
The music sings of love you knew
We walk around the story

Out in the city running free
Sands of companions sides that be
The strength of the meeting lies with you
Wait all the more regard your past
School gates remind us of our class
Chase all confusion away with us

Stand on hills of long forgotten yesterdays
Pass amongst your memories told returning ways
As certain as we walk today
We walk around the story

Out in the city running free
Days pass as seconds turn the key
The strength of the moment lies with you

Don the cap and close your eyes imagine yourself that is the challenge
Iron metal caast to other
Distant drums

Force the bit between the mouth of freedom didn't learn to fly
Remember to sail the skies
Distant suns
Will we reach
Winds allow
Other skylines
Other skylines to hold you

Relayer
 All the dying cried before you
Relayer
 We've rejoiced in all their meaning
Relayer
 We advance we retrace our stories

Like a dreamer all our lives are only lost begotten changes
We relive in seagull's pages
Outwards ways

Things are all in colours and the size of other's shall send you forward
Arranged to sail you toward
A peace of mind
Will we reach
Winds allow
Other skylines
Other skylines to hold you

Relayer
 All the passion spent on one cross
Relayer
 Sail the futile wars they suffer
Relayer
 We advance we retrace our story, fail safe now

Stand on hills of long forgotten yesterdays
Pass amongst your memories told returning ways
As certain as we walk today
Press over moments leaving you

Out in the city running free
Days pass as seconds turn the key
The strength of the moment lies with you
Out tender outward lights of you
Shine over mountains make the view
The strength of you seeing lies with you

Ours entrace we surely carry on
And change the passing of the sun
We don't even need to try we are one

And I do think very well
As the truth unfolds you
Silently
They move time
Rainbows
Sunlight
Alternate tune
Alternate tune

Rainbows
Soft light
Alternate view
Sunlight
Tell Me
Someone
Alternate view
Alternate view, surely, surely
