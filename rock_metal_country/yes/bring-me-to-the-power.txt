Anderson/Howe
This day began the matrix of the real world thinking
This way is meant to surface through the net
This train is set to mystify

This day began the history of the future 
This train is set to justify

Whether you're ready or not
This day is of the meeting now

If they don't give us the keys
How are we supposed to get ready?

If they don't give us the keys
How are we to survive?

Cover me up and bring me to the power
Cover me up and bring me to the power
Cover me up and bring me to the power

All I know is all I want to give you
Cover me up me -?- to the fire 
Cover me up get closer to the power
Cover me up get closer to the power
Cover me up get closer now
Cover me up get closer to the power

Got talk Got talk
Got talk Got talk
RevelationGot talk Revelation
Got Got talk Got talk
Revelation

If they don't give them the keys

If we don't give them the keys
How are they supposed to be ready?
If we don't give them the keys
How are they to devine?

If we don't give them the keys
How are they supposed to be ready?
If we don't give them the keys
How are they to survive?

Cover me up and bring me to the power
		Cover me up get closer to the power
Cover me up and bring me revelation

If we don't give them the keys
How are they supposed to be ready?
If you don't give them the keys
How are they to survive?

The power of love can open
Every heart in everyone
Minute by minute
