Squire
Hold on to the miracle of life...

Sacred lives emotions been washed away like mud.
You don't want my devotion;
You'd rather be washed in blood.
Can we turn away from this open anger?
Can it all betray?  
Can't you feel the danger to the miracle of life.

Sing when open hearts are calling,
Shout with open eyes To the miracle of life
Far below the deepest treasure
To the miracle of lifeLiving in times of luster, waiting for the flood.
We don't agree with your concepts;
You'd rather be washed in blood.
Is it any wonder? In my lifetime
Cold depth of blue water...
Is it any wonder? In my lifetime
Rising tide to slaughter...

Sing when open hearts are calling,
Shout with open eyes To the miracle of life
Far below your deepest pleasure
To the miracle of life
