Holy lamb
See the world we stamped
Is it so low again
Like a light that's lost upon the stage
So the more it swings, it goes away

Surely then
See the curtain rising to show us once again
All the magic of the earth and the skies
See the more we find
The more we realize

That every time
See the laws of nature keep telling us like a friend
It's the spirit of emotion dancing to the wind
High above
High above
So sure inspired againI can tell a new story now
Can we see through this mask of uncertainty
Surely now
How can it be so hard when all there is to know
Don't be afraid of letting go
It takes a loving heart
To see and show
This love
For our own ecology

Hold the light
Hold the light
Out of love we'll come a long long glorious way
At the start of every day
A child begins to play
And all we need to know
Is that the future is a friend of yours and mine
