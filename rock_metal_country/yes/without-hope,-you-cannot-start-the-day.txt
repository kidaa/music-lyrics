Hold still now for the moving information close to you.
You could never force it in your life: this decision to break it.
Without hope, you cannot start the day.

It's coming clear I've noticed;
It's a different face you're showing.
It's another ";Welcome Back";.
I don't imagine it could be this way -- So jealous!
Only you can tell it; tell me why.
Only you call tell it.
Only you can say.
In between this moving out to save your soul it came away,
And took it out;
Oh why?

Fire burning wild, burning in the night, chasing in the wind;
Shadows always dance in the rain, ringing into the fire.
Doesn't matter who, who can see in the smile.
Hope in the rain, open the flame, coming back in the night.
I can see the rhythm of the rain; I can see it shout back under:

I can see what you're thinking of
I can see what you think you need
I can see what you're thinking of
I can see that it must be love

Shadows come alight from the vision that flowed;
Shake it off - Passion is the flame that fired.
Does it matter?  Can you give?  Can you hear it come?
Can you see you're like?  
What's the matter?  Don't you want to risk?  Don't you want to hold me?
Hold me, dance in the rain.
I can see the love in your eyes; I can see you coming.

I can see what you're thinking of
I can see what you think you want
I can see what you're thinking of
I can see that it must be love

Sweet suffering, love protection: Need it, You need; Come to me.
Believe it, better by far, your heart is there;
Most of all: Believe it.
