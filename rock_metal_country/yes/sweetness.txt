Anderson/Squire/Bailey		
She brings the sunshine to a rainy afternoon;
She puts the sweetness in, stirs it with a spoon.
She watches for my moods, never brings me down;
She puts the sweetness in, all around.
She knows just what to say to make me feel so good inside.
And when I'm all alone I feel I don't want to hide, hide, hide.

Today she brought me in, told me where she'd been;
She put my mind at rest, put the sweetness in.
I'll ask her for some time to go and look around;
She puts the sweetness in with a sound.
She knows just what to say to make a sunny day.
And when I'm all alone I really don't feel that way.
Tell me, how would you feel with no world of your own and nobody to
  hold?
I just can't see the way; I'm so glad it's today and you're here, you're here.

Oh how I need her so,
I know she'll never go. Doo doo doo doot n doo.
She'll never leave me, believe me, no. Doo doo doo doot n doo.
She'll never go, no no no no no no no no no no no no.
