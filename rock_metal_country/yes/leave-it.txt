I can feel no sense of measure 
No illusions as we take 
Refuge in young man's pleasure 
Breaking down the dreams we make 
Real 

One donw one to go 
Another town and one more show 
Downtown they're giving away 
But she never came back 

No phone can take your place 
You know what I mean 
We have the same intrigue 
As a court of kings 

Ah leave it 
Ah leave it 
Two down there you go 
McArthur Park in the driving snow 
Uptown they're digging it out 
Better lay your claim 

Get home you're not alone 
You just broke out of the danger zone 
Be there to show your face 
On another dreamy day 

Ah leave it 
Ah leave it 

Goodbye goodbye goodbye bad
Ah leave it 
Hello hello heaven Goodbye goodbye goodbye bad
Ah leave it 
Hello hello heaven 

I can feel no sense of measure 
No illusions as we take 
Refuge in young man's pleasure 
Breaking down the dreams we make 
Real 

Ah leave it 
Ah leave it 

Goodbye goodbye goodbye bad
Ah leave it 
Hello hello heaven 

Goodbye goodbye goodbye bad
Ah leave it 
Hello hello heaven 

One down one to go
Ah leave it 
Another town and one more show
Goodbye goodbye goodbye bad 
Hello hello heaven 

One down one to go
Goodbye goodbye goodbye bad 
Another town and one more show 

Leave it
