Come into the light, passing through wisdom.
Hoping for love, all of the moves
Don't come across; you get too much.
Everybody needs it; don't show your body.

So dangerous - This fear of love
So dangerous - Can you handle it?
So dangerous - To love
So dangerous - Everyone else can do it

Walking the street, you're breaking your love.
Lose your heart, all in a mess.
In the middle of the night, looking for a little
Hands to the sun; don't show your body.

Death defying - Hurt by love
Passing through shadows - Don't lose your body

So dangerous - This fear of love
So dangerous - Can you handle it?
So dangerous - To keep this fear of love
So dangerous - To let it go

I don't imagine, I don't imagine as it is;
Don't get confused.
In the light, through the night...
Look in the light, through the night
Look in the light of what you're searching for.

Hide from your heart here in the arms of wanting.
Hide from the dark here in the arms of love.
Run from the fear inside the darkest reaches.
Look to yourself; you'll see the path is clear

So dangerous - This fear of love
So dangerous - Can you handle it?
So dangerous - To love
So dangerous - Everyone else can do it
Take what you have into the arms of wanting to the arms of love....
