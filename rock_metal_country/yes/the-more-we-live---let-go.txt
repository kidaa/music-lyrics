You and I can change the world;
    The more we live, the more we learn, the more we know.
From this moment on we share the world;
    The more we give, the more we love, the more we grow.
The spirit of imagination can lead us through the dark;
    The more we see, the more we try, the more we show.
The evidence of our confusion, life has left its mark;
    The more we fear, the more we lie, the more we hide.

As we walk into tomorrow 
	Turning away from the path we know
Holding the future with our hands 
	We carry the weight of the world we go
It's up to you and I -- We hold the key; we hold the answers

All our thoughts of doubt and fear are leaving one by one
    The more we live, the more we learn, the more we know.
For each of us the road is clear and life has just begun;
    The more we give, the more we love, the more we grow.
It's time to reach the goals we've set for ourselves;
    The more we fear, the more we lie, the more we hide.
All we need is just to believe in ourselves;
    We face the truth, we see it clear, with no disguise.

Cast away our doubt and sorrow 
	Turning away from the past we know
The Universe at our command
	Conserving the fate of the world we grow
Together you and I, we hold the key to all the answers

Let go
