So we worked all around amidst the glory of life
Any fire of the flame would be made
Should the famine of change to diguise everyone
Who cannot see the soul of truth ready made

But all because we're changing now
As the prophets of doom speak their mind
It's a long, long way from where the system began
It's a long, long way humankind

So we dance down on nature as we try to repeat
All our efforts as one sent today
Taking aback instead of giving, taking aback more or less
Taking aback a sense of being afraid
So all this necessary changes now, as the will to help all man
And the children of the crucified will better off, better dead

But all this senseless killing, and all these chains and lies
I want to know right now, I want to know right now
I want to know where we come from
For it's a long, long way from where the system began
It's a long, long way humankind
it's a long, long way from where the system began
it's a long, long way humankind, yeah

Giving in, giving in to love
I can see and feel the truth every minute
Giving in, giving in to love
Be the one to rescue you, rescue you
giving in, giving in to the right love
There's no way that you can live without it
So we can become masters of our invention
