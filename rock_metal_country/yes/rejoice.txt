Jon Anderson
Rejoice forward out this feeling
Ten true summers long
We go round and round and round and round
Until we pick it up again

Time flies, on and on it goes
Thru the setting sun
Carry round and round and round and round
Until it comes to carry you home

Rejoice forward out this feeling
The white eagle soars
He goes round and round and round
Until the early winds of changeDawn's new light conquering timeless ease
Spread the harvest breeze
Let our hour of passion
Gently hold our heads on high with you

Gently hold our heads on high
