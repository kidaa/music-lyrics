Is gone overground
That sky is ecstasy dancin'

My child my woman
My daughter my son
Together planning to party

Just wait for me
Out in the street
Teakbois in everywhere

Dancing with you
We're coming thru
Somehow we'll all be there

This time is surely
Come once and for all
We've waited so now
We are ready

Be quick be ready
Be sure and be smart
No need the energy wasted
I've dreamed of music
That comes from the heart
As tho' the eagle has landed

Just wait for me
Out in the street
Teakbois is everywhere

Dancing with you
We're coming thru
Everyone will be there

She smiles my mind
Is just blown I can't stop
No time is better than now

I wake up everyday
Before the sun is coming up

Bobby Dread and the kool running

The fish to catch
The sea to swim
They say I gotta life
To live

Bobby Dread and the kool runningMy music is my only witness
To my very soul

Bobby Dread and the kool running

So when you need me
All you have to do is help me
Lose control

Bobby Dread and the kool running

They say the world's a stage
So let me play for you and you and you

Bobby Dread and the kool running

It's all I ever in my life
I really wanted
To sing and do

Bobby Dread and the kool running

We form a group a simple name
A secret harmony like

Bobby Dread and the kool running

We write our songs
We symphonise
Some people say they like us

Bobby Dread and the kool running

This summer you couldn't get it
