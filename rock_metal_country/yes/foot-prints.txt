My eyes see the coming revolution
My eyes see the glory of the world
My eyes see the coming revolution
My eyes see the glory of the world

My eyes see the coming revolution
My eyes see the glory of the world
My eyes see the coming revolution
My eyes see the glory of the world

	Only when you stop to listen
Looking for the mystery in the woman
	Only when you start to see     [stop to see]
Dancing with the teacher in the circle
	Only when you watching for them  [... you want direction]
Watching for the reasons we are going
	Only when you stop to listen
Getting ready for the big bang

Everybody looking for that great connection
Somebody help me find that universal dream
Everybody watching
Is something happ'ning?  [There's something happening]
See what I mean?

	Only when you stop to listen
Looking for the real man
	Only when you stop to breath
Looking for the teacher 
	Dancing with the majesty of knowing
Dancing with the circle
	Only when you start to see  [...you stop to see]
Looking for the real world

Everybody knows where we're going to
Don't forget to leave good footprints behind
Never let the grass grow over your soul
Only time will tell
Leave good footprints behind

I can see the way   [I have seen the way]
The way is clear
To save your love

High upon the sky
The forces come   [The force has come]
To break me free   [To break you free]

Forgiving is what you have
Forgiving is what you see
Forgiving is what you know
Forgiving is all you are

I have seen the way
The way is clear
Beyond your soul

I can see the way   [I have seen the way]
The way is clear
To save your love

High upon the sky
The forces come   [The Force has come]
To break me free   [To break you free]

Forgiving is what you have
Forgiving is what you see
They say the soul
Has so many lifetimes

My eyes see the coming revolution
My eyes see the glory of the world

Only when you stop to listen
Only when you start to see

Forgiving is what you have
Forgiving is what you see
Forgiving is what you know
Forgiving is all you are

I can see the way
The way is clear
To save your soul

I have seen the way
The way is clear
Beyond your soul

My eyes see the coming revolution
My eyes see the coming revolution

My eyes see the coming revolution
My eyes see the glory of the world
My eyes see the coming revolution
My eyes see the glory of the world
