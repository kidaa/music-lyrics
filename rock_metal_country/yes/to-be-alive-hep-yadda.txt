Not a lot is missing
Every ounce of treasure found 
And I believe that everyone should get what
They're allowed
Suspected of belief that comes suspended
In a sound 
And everybody wants some

It's the sound they make in heaven 
It's a sound for here on earth
I've heard it in the whispering
Of  the wonders that we search
We've waited far too long 
To hear the healing of the stars
'N' everybody wants some

Everybody wants some
Everybody wants some
Everybody wants some
Everybody wants some
To feel alive

Oh - does it get much better than this
Oh - does it get much better, much better
Oh - does it get much better than this, than this

There's the sound that keeps you trying
There's the sound that makes you smile
There's a sound in every corner 
Of the world that we surviveYour temple is the harmony
You feel the sacred ground 
Just wishing for the secret
To appear within the sound
Watching for the morning star 
The rhythm of the sun
I hear it in my waking dreams
The singing has begun

The passion that we walk upon
The passion that we bring
Is written for the mountains
They love to hear us sing

Everybody wants some
Everybody wants some 
Everybody wants some 
Everybody wants some 
To feel alive

Oh - doesn't get much better than this
Oh - doesn't get much better than this, than this

Who made me make believe
I'm alive I'm living
Never underestimate
The signals coming to you
Oh
The sounding of the earth 
It shakes you, yes it shakes you
Oh
The sounding of the earth
It shakes you, let it shake you

Hep yadda
