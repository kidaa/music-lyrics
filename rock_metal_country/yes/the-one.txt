Never underestimate the loving
How we intertwine our very soul
How we fill eachother's spaces
To lose control
When you're talking be the children
Who stand on solid ground
Never underestimate the giving
That will bring you round

I'll be there
To bring you this love in the morning
I'll be there
To bring you the stars at night
I'll be there just waiting to hear you singing

Never underestimate a giver
The gift of love will surely be
When you're asking for the secret
To set you free
When you're talking to the friendship
That love of higher self
This gift of love is
The answer to all your doubtsBe the one, giving in to love
Never let the good in life desert you
Be the one, giving in to love
Never let the fools destroy your dreams
Be the one, giving in to love
I can dream myself every minute
So how did we become
Masters of limitation?

I'll be there
I'll be there
I'll be there
To make it right for you

Giving in, giving in to love
It's the balance of this everyday feeling
Giving in, giving in to love
Without love our dreams become illusion
Giving in, giving in to love
I can hear you singing every minute
So you can sing the song, and see the truth
