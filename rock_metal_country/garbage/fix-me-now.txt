Things don't have to be this way 
Catch me on a better day 

Bury me above the clouds 
All the way from here 
Take away the things I need 
Take away my fear 

Hide me in a hollow sound 
Happy evermore 
Everything I had to give 
Gave out long before 

Fix me now I wish you would Fix me now 
Bring me back to life Fix me now 
Kiss me blind somebody should Fix me now 
From hollow into light 

Crashing silent broken down 
Falling into night 
Who gave up an who gave in 
I'll go without a fight 

Cut me down or cut me dead 
Cut me in or out 
Kiss me blind time after time 
Take away my doubt 

Fix me now I wish you would {Fix me now I wish you would} Fix me now 
Bring me back to life Fix me now 
Kiss me blind somebody should {Kiss me blind somebody should} Fix me now 
From hollow into light 

Things don't have to be this way 
Catch me on a better day 

Nowhere only down from here 
Pick me off the floor 
Take away the things I dream 
One time one place one more 

Fix me now I wish you would {Fix me now somebody should} Fix me now 
Bring me back to life Fix me now 
Kiss me blind somebody should {Fix me now somebody should} Fix me now 
From hollow into 

Fix me now I wish you would {Fix me now somebody should} Fix me now 
Bring me back to life Fix me now 
Kiss me blind somebody should {Fix me now somebody should} Fix me now 
From hollow into light 

Things don't have to be this way 
Catch me on a better day 
Things don't have to be this way 
Catch me on a better day.
