Won't you let me walk you home from school 
Won't you let me meet you at the pool 
Maybe Friday I can 
get tickets for the dance 
and I'll take you 

Won't you tell your Dad get off my back 
Tell him what we said 'bout Paint It Black 
Rock and roll is here to stay 
Come inside now, it's OK 
and I'll take you 

Won't you tell me what you're thinking of 
And would you be an outlaw for my rough 
If it's so then let me know 
If it's no, well I can go 
I won't make you
