I would die for you 
I would die for you 
I've been dying just to feel you by my side 
To know that you're mine 

I will cry for you 
I will cry for you 
I will wash away your pain with all my tears 
And drown your fear 

I will pray for you 
I will pray for you 
I will sell my soul for something pure and true 
Someone like you 

See your face every place that I walk in 
Hear your voice every time I am talking 
You will believe in me 
And I will never be ignored 

I will burn for you 
Feel pain for you 
I will twist the knife and bleed my aching heart 
I'll tear it apart 

I will lie for you 
I can steal for you 
I will crawl on hands and knees until you see 
You're just like me 

Violate all my love that I'm missing 
Throw away all the pain that I'm living 
You will believe in me 
And I can never be ignored 

I would die for you 
I would kill for you 
I will steal for you 
I'd do time for you 
I would wait for you 
I'd make room for you 
I'd sail ships for you 
To be close to you 
To be a part of you 
'Cause I believe in you 
I believe in you 
I would die for you.
