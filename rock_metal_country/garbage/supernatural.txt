Built a king on compliments 
Charisma and advertisements 
Still they see him shimmer ephemeral 
It ain't supernatural 
No, it ain't supernatural 
Supernatural maybe 

It was an out of body experience 
Yes I flew around the hospital walls 
Intravenous demerol 
And it weren't supernatural 
No, it weren't supernatural 
Supernatural maybe 

A sudden smell of hay 
A certain view 
Sparked off a case of the deja vu 
Is it inexplicable 
No, no, it ain't supernatural 
No, it ain't supernatural 
Supernatural maybe.
