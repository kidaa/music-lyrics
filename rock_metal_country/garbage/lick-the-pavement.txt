1 2 3 4 
You got my number you know what I need 
And I go crazy when ever I bleed 
Won't you come over I swear I'll be nice 
My girlfriend told me that you got a wife 

[Chorus:]
I learn to bribe I learn to say please 
Oh wont you lick the pavement for me 
I learn to bribe I learn to say please 
I like you best when your on your knees 

I know your lonely cause your just like me 
Why don't you call me you'll know where I'll be 

[Chorus]

Do do do do do do do do do do do [x2]

[Chorus]

Do do do do do do do when your on your knees do do do do [x6]
Oh won't you lick the pavement for me [till fade].
