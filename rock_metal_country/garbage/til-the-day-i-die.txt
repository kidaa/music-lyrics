You walked into the room
The sun hit my eyes
The force you struck me down caught me by surprise
You sprung the mojo and it worked like a charm
I felt invincible with you in my arms

I must confess it can feel good to feel pain
Like breaking waves or getting caught in the rain
Playing those games cause we had nothing to do
I was oblivious I was losing to you

Oh I will love you to the day that I die

Holy Jesus
Holy rock 'n roll
The more I gave to you the more you grew bored
And making love became the waging of war
No peace
No tenderness
No fun anymore

I dreamt that I called out your name
You turned your face to me and started to say
Something so beautiful it hurt deep inside
So I will love you till the day that I die
