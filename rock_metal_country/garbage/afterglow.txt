Centre on the wide horizon
Focus on the galaxy
Sweep away your expectations
and recognise your enemies

I hear you talking to yourself
You're stripping off for someone else
You've got to learn to love yourself
It's all that counts, there's little else

You're always looking for affections
and all its possibilities
Your senses searching for attention
in urgent need of gravity

I think you think you're someone else
You've got to learn to save yourself
Before you find there's nothing left
But bitterness
And hollowness
And afterglow
And afterglow.
