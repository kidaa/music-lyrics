Watching the days slip by so fast 
Knowing our fate has long been cast 
Working our fingers to be done 
Cause nobody loves you when you're gone 
Coughing up feeling just for you 
To find something real to hold on to 
But there's a hole inside my heart 
Where all of my love comes pouring out 
You know you'll always be my man 
But grab yourself sweetness where you can 
Cause sooner or later we're going to die 
Left to the dogs under the sky 
I cracked a piece of broken glass 
Coughing up feeling just for you 
To find something real to hold on to 
But there's a hole inside my heart 
Where all of my love comes pouring out 
You say that all the good is gone 
That I have forgotten who I am 
Free as a bird 
Wild as the wind 
But somehow I cannot let you in
