I just don't care anymore 
I've reached the end of the rope 
I just don't care anymore 
Won't cry these tears anymore 

Can't find it in the bible 
Can't find it on t.v. 
Can't find it in diamonds 
There's something inside me that just went around it 
Can't find it in music 
Can't find it in my soul 
Can't find it in chocolate 
Oh babe I can't hide it 
I can't even fight it 

I just don't care anymore 
I've reached the end of the rope 
I just don't care anymore 
Won't cry these tears anymore 

There's no way she can kiss you the way that I do 
I heard that you miss me 
Oh you should be careful of whom you've been talking to 
Ten long nights without you have taught me to be strong 
I've cut all my losses 
Think no more about it because I couldn't fight it 

I just don't care anymore 
I've reached the end of the rope 
I just don't care anymore 
Won't cry these tears anymore 

There was a time I thought I'd die 
If you should ever leave me high and dry 
And you don't want me anymore 
It's time to settle the score 

I just don't care anymore 
I've reached the end of my temper I'm tired of the letters 
I just don't care anymore 
Won't cry these tears anymore 
I just don't care anymore 
I've reached the end of my rope and it's time that I've taught you so 
I just don't care anymore 
Won't cry these tears anymore 

It's time to settle the score
