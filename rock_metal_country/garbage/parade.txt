Oh let's bomb the factory 
That makes all the wannabes 
Let's burst all the bubbles 
That brainwash the masses 

As far as I can tell 
It doesn't matter who you are 
If you can believe there's something worth fighting for 
The color of an eye 
The glory of a sudden view 
The baby in your arms 
The smile he always shoots at you 

Believing in nothing 
Makes life so boring 
So let's pray for something 
To feel good in the morning 

As far as I can tell 
It doesn't matter who you are 
If you can believe there's something worth fighting for 
The color of an eye 
The glory of a sudden view 
The baby in your arms 
The smile he always shoots at you 

KABOOM 
Get it right 
Get it right now 
Get it right 
Do it good 
Get it right now 
KABOOM 
Get it right 
Get it right now 
Get it right 
Do it good 
Get it right now 
KABOOM 
KABOOM 
KABOOM 
KABOOM 

Oh doctor 
We're dying 
There's no use in crying 
So live for tomorrow 
And do what you have to 

As far as I can tell 
It doesn't matter who you are 
If you can believe there's something worth fighting for 
The color of an eye 
The glory of a sudden view 
The baby in your arms 
The smile he always shoots at you 

Oh let's pray for something 
To feel good in the morning 
In the morning 
As far as I can tell Get it right now 
In the morning 
As far as I can tell Get it right now 
In the morning 
As far as I can tell Get it right now 
As far as I can tell Get it right now 
As far as I can tell Get it right now
