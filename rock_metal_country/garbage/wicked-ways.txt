I tried hard to mend my wicked ways 
Acted like a lunatic for years 
Lord knows I try to be good 
I'd keep my promises if only I could 
You count your blessings that I can't rely on you 

And I tried [4x]

Clutch your pictures of the Pope 
Pray to God for love and hope 
Bring the Virgin home for luck 
Bolt the door down, keep it shut 

I've done things I never thought I'd do 
Sure it helps to lose myself in you 
A little time and I'll be all right 
C'mon sugar let's go out tonight 
Forgive your trespasses 
And all that we've been through 

And I tried [8x]

Clutch your pictures of the Pope 
Pray to God for love and hope 
Bring the Virgin home for luck 
Bolt the door down, keep it shut 

That sinking feeling 
When you are leaving 
All I believed in 
Walks out my door 

I tried hard to mend my wicked ways 
The damage's done, there's nothing left to save 

And I tried [7x]

Clutch your pictures of the Pope 
just like I told you 
Pray to God for love and hope 
just like I warned you 
Bring the Virgin home for luck 
just like I told you 
Bolt the door down, keep it shut 
just like I warned you.
