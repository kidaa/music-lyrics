Girl don't come 
If it's all been said and done 
Don't hang around 
Let them kick back off the ground 
Let them kick back off the ground 

Girl don't come 
He's got nothing left to lose 
But that's all right 
That could well change overnight 
He'll want to take that pretty head 
Lay down in someone else's bed 

Girl don't come 
Girl don't come 
Girl don't come 
Girl don't come 

If you want my sympathy my dear 
You better not come near my dear 
I think it's fair to say my dear 
You better see my way 
You better see my way 

Girl don't come 
Girl don't come 
Girl don't come 
Girl don't come 
Girl don't come 
Girl don't come If you want my sympathy my dear 
Girl don't come You better not come near my dear 
Girl don't come I think it's fair to say my dear 
Girl don't come You better see my way my dear 
Girl don't come If you want my sympathy my dear 
Girl don't come You better not come near my dear 
Girl don't come I think it's fair to say my dear 
Girl don't come You better see my way my dear.
