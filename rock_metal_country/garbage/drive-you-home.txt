It's funny how 
Even now 
You still support me after all the things that I've done 
You're so good to me 
Wait impatiently 
And isn't it sad that you still have to ask if I care 

I never said I was perfect 
But I can take you away 
... 
Can't do wrong tonight 
And you can't say the word cause I need to know .... 
I never said I was perfect 
But I can drive you home 

I got down on myself 
Working too hard 
Driving myself to death 
Trying to beat up the faults in my head 
What a mess I've made 
Sure we all make mistakes 
But they see me so large 
That they think I'm immune to the pain 

.... 
Can't do wrong tonight 
And you can't say the word cause I need to know .... 
I'm praying for a miracle 
But I won't hold my breath 

I never said I was perfect 
But can you take me home
