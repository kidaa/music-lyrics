I got you crawling up a mountain 
Hanging round my neck 
I got you twisted round my finger 
Crawling round my legs 

The emptiness 
The craziness 
Satisfy this hungriness 

Darling 
How would it feel 

[Chorus:]
If we sleep together 
Will you like me better 
If we come together 
We'll go down forever 
If we sleep together 
Will I like you better 
If we come together 
Prove it now or never 

Make me a pretty person 
Make me feel like I belong 
Make me hard and make me happy 
Make me beautiful 

The emptiness 
The craziness 
Satisfy this hungriness 

Darling 
How would it feel 

[Chorus:]
If we sleep together 
Nothing satisfies me baby 
If we sleep together 
I'll wear something pretty baby 
If we sleep together 
Give me what I crave now baby 
If we sleep together 
Save the rest for later baby 
If we sleep together 
You will drive me crazy baby 
If we sleep together 
I save it all for you my baby 
If we sleep together 
If we sleep together.
