Car, car, car 
Car, car, car 

Let's get behind the wheel 
We'll go driving 
To the mountains 
To the rooftops 

We can take it nice and slow 
I'll be driving 
To the icebergs 
To the edges 

Car, get in the car 
Car, get in the car 

Heading to the clouds 
Past the buildings 
By the harbor 
Through the storm 

Tear across the page 
By the marker 
Leave the light on 
By the boy's side 

Car, get in the car 
Car, get in the car 

I can make an honest man of you 
I can make you clean if you want me to 
I can make you go very far 
Just take the car 

Get in the car 
Car, get in the car 

Take the car gotta feel to make it real.
