This is nothing new to me 
It takes more than what you've got 
To frighten me 
I'm not scared of you 
There's nothing you can do 
Or take from me 

Untouchable 
You think you're untouchable 
You know 
No one's untouchable 

You're bound to lose the game 
There's no one else to blame 
You play so safe 
And you're not risking enough 
You are doomed to be undone 
I swear I'll be the one 
To bring you down 

It's all your fault 
Cause you got caught 

Untouchable 
You think you're untouchable 
You know 
No one's untouchable 

It must be nice 
To be so sure 
And never feel insecure 
It must feel good to believe 
You're always right 
And you're never wrong 

You've got something to say 
You say it to my face 
And be a man about it 
You got a problem with me 
Don't go behind my back 
Just like a baby 

Untouchable pride comes before 
You think you're untouchable you take a fall 
You know you best beware 
No one's untouchable a woman scorned 
Untouchable pride comes before 
You think you're untouchable you take a fall 
You know you best beware 
No one's untouchable a woman scorned 
No one's untouchable 
You think you're untouchable 
You know, no one's untouchable 
No one's untouchable 
No one's untouchable 
No one's untouchable 
No one's untouchable
