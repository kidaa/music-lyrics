In a modern culture 
My friend you must be careful 
They've got million ways to kill you 

In this dangerous world 
There's an art to growing old 
Taking chances 
Magic happens 

One mistake's all it takes 
And your life has come undone 
Walk away cause you're breaking up the girl 
It's a drag 
I know it's hard 
But you're tearing her apart 
Walk away cause you're breaking up the girl 

I am afraid there's much to be afraid of 
Here today and gone tomorrow 
Don't end up in the gutter 
Just like the one before 
You're just the same 
You're such a loser 

One mistake's all it takes 
And your life has come undone 
Walk away cause you're breaking up the girl 
It's a drag 
I know it's hard 
But you're tearing her apart 
Walk away cause you're breaking up the girl 

You've got to let her go because you're breaking up the girl 
The girl 

One mistake's all it takes 
And your life has come undone 
Walk away cause you're breaking up the girl 
It's a drag 
I know it's hard 
But you're tearing her apart 
Walk away cause you're breaking up the girl 

You're breaking up the girl 
You're breaking up the girl 
The girl
