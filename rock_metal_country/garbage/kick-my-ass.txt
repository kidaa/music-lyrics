I'm so sorry you had to kick my ass 
You said I ruined your life 
I didn't mean to do that 

I had to untangle where we was entwined 
You were strangling me 
Were you breathing so fine 

The jam I was in when things weren't working out 
Led me to the brunt of your swinging bout 

I'm so sorry, I regret everything 
But what can I do 
To have you take back that swing 

I'm so sorry a scuffle ensued 
But things are much better now 
I guess thanks to you 

The jam I was in when things weren't working out 
Led me to the brunt of your swinging bout 

I'm so sorry you had to pull my hair 
I had to take care of business 
There was a lot of business giving there.
