I can't use what I can't abuse 
And I can't stop when it comes to you 

You burned me out but I'm back at your door 
Like Joan of Arc coming back for more 

I nearly died 
I nearly died 
I nearly died 

I came to cut you up 
I came to knock you down 
I came around to tear your little world apart 
I cam to shut you up 
I came to drag you down 
I came around to tear your little world apart 
And break your soul apart 

You burn and burn to get under my skin 
You've gone too far now I won't give in 
You crucified me but I'm back in your bed 
Like Jesus Christ coming from the dead 

I nearly died 
I nearly died 
I nearly died 

I came to knock you up 
I came to cut you down 
I came around to tear your little world apart 
I came to rip you up 
I came to shut you down 
I came around to tear your little world apart 
And break your soul apart 

I nearly died 
I nearly died 
I nearly died 

I came to cut you up 
I came to knock you down 
I came around to tear your little world apart 
I came to shut you up 
I came to suck you down 
I came around to tear your little world apart 
Tear your little world apart 
Tear your little world apart 
And break your soul apart 

I can't stop when it comes to you 
I can't stop when it comes to you 
When it comes to you 
When it comes to you.
