Well...I might just consider this
If you don't let me down
If you can keep me happy
Well you can sit around
Now I don't care for sycofants
They drive me round the bend
Then if you can't control yourself
Then let's just keep being friends

[Chorus:]
Let's make out in the back of your car
Let's going driving and toodlin' around
We can always get lost in a crowd
Are you ready to get deep down
Woohoo
Woohoo

Now there's something you should know about
I'm cronically depressed
Internalise my hatred
And sacrifice my self
Now I am busy Saturday
But I am free tonight
And I might have to sort you out
If you don't do it right 

[Chorus]

Get bizzy with the fizzy baby [4x]

[Chorus + Wohoo 2x]

Get bizzy with the fizzy baby Uhuhuh..uhh! [4x]
