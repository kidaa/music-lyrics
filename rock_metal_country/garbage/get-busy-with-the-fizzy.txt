Well I might just consider this 
If you don't let me down 
If you can keep me happy 
Well you can stick around 
Now I don't care for sycofants 
They drive me round the bend 
But if you can't control yourself 
Then let's just keep good friends 
Let's make out in the back of your car 
Let's go driving and toddling around 
We could always get lost in a crowd 
Are you ready to get deep down? 

Now there's something you should know about 
I'm chronically depressed 
I internalize my hatred 
And sacrifice myself 
Now I am busy Saturday 
But I am free tonight 
And I might have to sort you out 
If you don't do it right 

Let's make out in the back of your car 
Let's go driving and toddling around 
We could always get lost in a crowd 
Are you ready to get deep down? 


Get Bizzy with the fizzy baby 
Get Bizzy with the fizzy baby 
Get Bizzy with the fizzy baby 

Let's make out in the back of your car 
Let's go driving and toddling around 
We could always get lost in a crowd 
Are you ready to get deep down? 

Get Bizzy with the fizzy baby 
Get Bizzy with the fizzy baby 
Get Bizzy with the fizzy baby
