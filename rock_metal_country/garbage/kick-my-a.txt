I'm so sorry  
You had to Kick my A**  
You said I ruined your life  
I didn't mean to do that 

I had to untangle  
Where we was intwined  
Were you strangling me  
Or were you breathing so fine 

The jam I was in  
When things weren't working out  
Lead me to the brunt  
Of your swinging bout 

I'm so sorry  
I regreat everything  
But what can I do  
To have you take back that swing 

I'm so sorry  
A scuffle ensued  
But things are much better now  
I guess thanks to you 

The jam I was in  
When things weren't working out  
Lead me to the brunt  
Of your swinging bout 

I'm so sorry  
You had to pull my hair  
I was taking care of business  
A lot of business giving there
