In the middle of the night 
Head on my pillow 
Looking like a little ghost 

Seems like all of the things 
That you gave your mother 
Have all gone up in smoke 

In the middle of the night 
You don't know what I'm thinking 
But still the stars still sparkle and shine 

Seems like all of the time 
Our boat was slowly sinking 
You didn't even seem to mind 

Now all I want to do is sleep 
Now all I want to do is sleep 
Now all I want to do is sleep.
