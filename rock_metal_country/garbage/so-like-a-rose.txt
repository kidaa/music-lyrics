Baby thinks he's dying 
Lost inside his bedroom 
Mommy won't stop crying 
And daddy is always working 

There's no going back 
There's no going back 
There's no going back 
In this world 

Baby wakes up with the sun 
While everyone is sleeping 
He thinks he's going crazy 
But this could be the big one 

There's no going back 
There's no going back 
There's no going back 

Sleeping with ghosts 
It's such a warming experience 
The stars are out tonight 
Only they can hear you breathing 

You're so like a rose 
You're so like a rose 
You're so like a rose 
I wish you could stay here
