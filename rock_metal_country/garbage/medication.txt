I don't need an education 
I learnt all I need from you 
They've got me on some medication 
My point of balance was askew 
It keeps my temperature from rising 
My blood is pumping through my veins 

[Chorus:]
Somebody get me out of here 
I'm tearing at myself 
Nobody gives a damn about me or anybody else 

I wear myself out in the morning 
You're asleep when I get home 
Please don't call me self defending 
You know it cuts me to the bone 
And it's really not surprising 
I hold a force I can't contain 

[Chorus:]
And still you call me co-dependent 
Somehow you lay the blame on me 
And still you call me co-dependent 
Somehow you lay the blame on me 

Somebody get me out of here 
I'm tearing at myself 
I've got to make a point these days 
To extricate myself 

[Chorus:]
And still you call me co-dependent 
Somehow you lay the blame on me 
And still you call me co-dependent 

Somehow you lay the blame on me [3x]
