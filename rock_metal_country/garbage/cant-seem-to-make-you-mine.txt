Can't you see what you do to me
You fill my life with misery
With every breath every step I take
I'm more in love with you

I can't go on like this
A little bit of love, not a kiss
I gotta have your love everyday
One that'll never fade

Can't you see what you're doin' to me
You fill my heart with misery
With every breath, every step I take
I'm more in love with you

I can't seem to make you mine [x2]

Kissing all around all the time
I can't seem to make you mine
Flying around like a bee
Hurting everything you see

I can't seem to make you mine [4x]
