Thirteen times you fucked with my karma
And thirteen times I sucked on your dogma
You taught me to hate
You taught me to crawl

You raised your hand as you raised the bottle
You knock me down but it made me stronger
The harder you hit
The harder you fall

And this one's for my mother
What will I do without her
Don't look back
Don't even bother

And this one's for the father
Who loves his little daughter Well here I am
Don't even bother

You can freak out about me
But you'd lose your mind without me
You thought you could see right through me
But it made no difference to me
Anyway [x2]

A free reign gave you ammunition
To play the game and
Fuck other women
And something just snapped
And cracked in my brain

Thirteen times I sucked up inside me
The different ways that you tried to harm me
You did it once
You'll do it again

And this one's for my sister
You dare to denigrate her
Don't look back
Don't even bother

And this one's for my lover
The one who had to suffer
Here I am
Don't even bother

You can freak out about me
But you'd lose your mind without me
You thought you could see right through me
But it made no difference to me
Anyway [x4]

Thirteen times one
Thirteen times two
Thirteen times three
Thirteen times four
Thirteen times five
Thirteen times six
Thirteen times seven
Thirteen times eight
