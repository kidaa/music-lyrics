Be easy with me  
I'm fragile  
I'm easily broken 

Be careful with me  
I'm a fighter  
And you're a cheat and you're a liar 

I don't need this anymore  
This is not what I came for  
I won't stand for this at all  
I won't see you any more 

Be easy on me  
Don't trip my wire  
I'm a freak and I'm on fire  

Be easy on me  
Trip my wire  
I'm a freak and I'm on fire  

I don't need this anymore  
This is not what I came for  
I won't stand for this at all  
I won't see you any more 

Be careful with me  
I'm fragile  
I'm a bitch babe and I'm on fire 

Be careful with me  
I'm fragile  
I'm a bitch babe and I'm on fire 

Tri-tri-trip, trippin on my wire  
B-b-baby baby I'm on fire  
B-b-baby baby I'm on fire  
I'm a freak freak freak and baby I'm on fire  
I'm a freak freak freak and baby I'm a liar  
I'm a freak freak freak and baby I'm on fire 

Be careful with me  
Be careful with me  
I'm fragile 

Don't you trip,  
Stepping on my wire  
I'm a freak, freak, freak  
But baby I'm on fire 

I don't need this any more  
This is not what I came for
