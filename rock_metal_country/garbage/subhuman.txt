Burn down all your idols 
Destroy your idols 
Create a scene 
There goes all your reason 
It's helter skelter 
It's not a dream 

Come down from the altar 
Remove your blindfold 
What do you see 
Nothing left to do here 
There's nothing new here 
It's all the same 

You're going down, down, down 
How low can you go 
You're going down, down, down 
How low can you go 
You're going down, down, down 
How low can you go 

Hare Hare Krishna 
Was that your sister 
Or a cover girl 
A wasted prima donna 
She lost her way here 
She disappeared 

Come back to your altar 
And build a fire 
It's getting cold 
Nothing stops you in here 
There's not a stone here 
You're all alone 

You're going down, down, down 
How low can you go 
You're going down, down, down 
How low can you go 
You're going down, down, down 
How low can you go 

Kill the new religion 
No inhibition 
No alibi 
Televised confession 
A true obsession 
It's all new lies 

Miscommunication 
Misinformation 
A perfect waste 
Bite the sacred apple 
And suck the poison 
Enjoy the taste 

You're going down, down, down 
How low can you go 
You're going down, down, down 
How low can you go 
You're going down, down, down 
You're going down, down, down 
You're going down, down, down 
How low can you go 

How low can you go 
How low can you go 
How low can you go 
How low can you go 
How low can you go
