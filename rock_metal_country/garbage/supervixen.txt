Come down to my house
Stick a stone in your mouth
You can always pull out
If you like it too much 

Make a whole new religion
A falling star that you cannot live without
And I'll feed your obsession
There'll be nothing but this thing that you'll never doubt 

A hit is hard to resist
And I never miss
I can take you out
With just a flick of my wrist 

Make a whole new religion
A falling star that you cannot live without
And I'll feed your obsession
There is nothing but this thing that you'll never doubt
This thing you'll never doubt 

And I'll feed your obsession
The falling star that you cannot live without
I will be your religion
This thing you'll never doubt
You're not the only one
You're not the only one 

[Background:]
Now I want it too much
Now I want it to stop
Now I'm lucky like a falling star that fell over me 

Bow down to me, bow down to me
Bow down to me, bow down to me
Bow down to me, bow down to me
Bow down to me.
