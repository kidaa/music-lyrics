So you finally got what you wanted 
You've achieved your aim by making me walk in line 

When you just can't get any higher 
You've used your senses to suss out this week's climber 

And the small fame that you've acquired 
Has brought you into cult status but to me you're still a collector 

There's tarts and whores but you're much more 
You're a different kind 'cause you want their minds 
And you just don't care 'cause you've got no pride 
It's just a face on your pillowcase 
That thrills you 

And you started looking much older 
And your fashion sense is second rate like your perfume 

But to you in your little dream world 
You're still the queen of the butterfly collectors 

As you carry on 'cause it's all you know 
You can't light a fire, you can't cook or sew 
You go from day to day by filling your head 
But you surely must know the appeal between your legs 
Has worn off 

And I don't care about morals 
'Cause the word's insane and we're all to blame anyway 

And I don't feel any sorrow 
Towards the Queens and Kings of the butterfly collectors 

There's tarts and whores but you're much more 
You're a different kind 'cause you want their minds 
And you just don't care 'cause you've got no pride 
He's just a face on your pillowcase 
That thrills you 

You carry on 'cause it's all you know 
You can't light a fire, you can't cook or sew 
You go from day to day filling your head 
But you surely must know the appeal between your legs 
Has worn off 

And I don't feel any sorrow 
Towards the Kings and Queens of the butterfly collectors.
