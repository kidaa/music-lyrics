Her head is in a bitter way
Her brain's on fire
She's just looking for the perfect wave
It's her brain's desire
I'll think of her when I walk the strand
On this true hormos a night

Ed is dead  [4x]

She's just rotting in stupid bliss
With music on her bars uh
Her face burning in the L.A. sun
She got no got no fear of cars
I better kick my strand cruiser
To the friendlier oh oh oh oh oh oh

Ed is dead  [4x]

Ed is dead
Ed is, yeah Ed is
Ed is dead  [3x]
E.I.D.  [3x]

No, no, no, no, no
