I turned you on the roof
to shine your face at me.
Drink wine from your tears, rollin'.
Holly molly, 
Rock a my-
soul.

Hey, rock a my soul [4]
hard.

I'm waiting!
We're waiting!
for electric- 
in a manor.

I'm waiting.
We're waiting,
sister shaking.

Harder I try,
although, 
harder I feel,
like a 
Coletrain-
No brain.
Rock a my soul!

Hey, rock a my soul.
Hey, rock a my soul!
Oh, rock a my soul!
Hey, rock a my soul,
hard.

I'm waiting.
We're waiting,
for electric-
in a manor

I'm waiting. 
We're waiting!
