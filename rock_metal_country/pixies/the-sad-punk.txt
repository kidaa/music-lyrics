I smell smoke
taht comes from a gun
named extintion
it was a long time ago
could have happened to anyone
he was struck by a bullet
and he melted into fluid named extintion
one thousand miles an hour
i'm just like anyone
i want to feel
the road of tar beneath the wheel named extinction
and evolving from the sea
would no be too much time for me
to walk beside you in the sun
i read something
about a son of a gun
named extinction.
