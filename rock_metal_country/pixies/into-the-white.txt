And there ain't no night
And there ain't no night

Did you hear what I said
Come into the white 

Into the White [3X]

And there ain't no day
And there ain't no day

And there ain't no night 
And there ain't no night

Into the White [3X]

Did you hear what I said
Did you hear what I said

Deeper than your sleepy haed
Deeper than your sleepy head

Ain't nothin' to see
Ain't nothin' in sight

Into the white [3X]

Go, and you'll go real far
Go, and you'll go real far

Just past the big quasar
Just past the big quasar

Can't hitch a meteorite
Can't hitch a meteorite

Into the white [13X]
