Pioneer of aerodynamics
little eiffel, little eiffel
they thought he was real smart alec
little eiffel, little eiffel
he thought big they called it a phallic
little eiffel, little eiffel
they didn't know he was panoramic
little eiffel stands in the archway
little eiffel, little eiffel
keeping low doesn't make no sense
sometimes people can be oh so dense
they didn't want it but he built it anyway
little eiffel, little eiffel
little eiffel stands in the archway
little eiffel, little eiffel
keeping low don't make sense
keeping low doesn't make no-sense
little eiffel, little eiffel
little eiffel stands in the archway
oh alexander i see you beneath
the archway of aerodynamics.
