The day since i met her
i can't believe it's true
she came here from memphis
across the ocean sailing
and i saw her a i pleaded
why do you come so far and she said
trying to get to you
how i tried to get you
trying to get you
i'm sending a letter
i'll send it right to you
i'll send it to memphis
i know that someday
everything i needed and i wanted
used to be that my head was haunted
and all these sirens they make me mad
and all this violence it brings me down
i feel strong i feel lucky
trying to get to you
said i'm going to get to you
trying to get to you.
