My father lives in Arabia
And I live right here at my school

I took his plane to Columbia
So I could sail at my school 

It's weird at my school
Weird at my school [3X]

My mother's glad that I am here
So she can visit my school

I can't believe she's so pretty
I'm a son of a bitch at my school

Weird at my school [4X]

And my best friend, my cousin Eleanor
She lives far away from the doors of my school

And often times, you know I fantasize
That I have sex with the nuns at my school

It's weird at my school
Weird at my school [7X]
