Hermanita ven conmigo [x2],
Hay aviones cada hora,

Isla del encanto,
Me voy! [x3]

Donde no hay sufrimiento [x2],
Me vieron pasar por la calle,
Isla del encanto,
Me voy! [x3]

Nuestro propio animal canta a la gente pa'gratis ,
Hey babe what are we doing here.
Laaaaa,Loooh,Patria.
Isla del encanto,
Me voy! [x3]

[TRANSLATION]

Little sister come with me,
There are planes each hour,

Island of the enchantment,
I'm leaving!
Where there is no suffering,
They saw me pass by the street,
Island of the enchantment,
I'm leaving!

Our own animal sings for free for the people,
Hey babe what are we doing here
Laaa Loooh,Fatherland.

Island of the enchantment,
I'm leaving!
