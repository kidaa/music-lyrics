By the old seaside

Ain't no place far to go
I don't know

I don't know
Ain't no place far to go

It's a dollar, she say
Te amo le mas
Te amo le mas

Santo [4X]

Hey ya' boy
How ya' doin'
Come here boy 

Here she come a slitherin'
-duh, duh, grunt, duh-

Here she come a slitherin'
Che cha chu bah che cha 

Te amo le mas
Te amo le mas

Santo [4X]

Buzzard eels 
Buzzer bikinis 
Eat your rouge 
A chini weinies 
A warm gardeda 
Da' mamacita
-duh-
A poutin' grandma
In a corner
A passin' time

Hey, hey 
Praying to far to 

Santo [4X]
