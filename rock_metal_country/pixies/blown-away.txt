now the sun is burning 
in deepest space
that's the way things are
through a storm i called you
it fell each day
i didn't get so far
my words get blown away

my lips are moving 
if you touch my face
did you hear my scream
while we were sleeping
i tried to say
even in my dreams
my words get blown away

now the sun is burning 
in deepest space
i didn't get so far
