I know so many people who think they can do it alone
They isolate their heads and stay in their safety zone
What can you tell them
What can you say that will make them defensive
Hang on to your ego
Hang on but I know that you're gonna lose the fight
They come on like they're peaceful but inside they're so uptight
They trip through the day and waste all their thoughts at night
Now how can I say it
How can I come on when I know I'm guilty
Yeah, hang on to your ego
Hang on but I know you're gonna lose the fight
