there is this old woman
she lives down the road
you can often find her
kneeling inside of her hole
and i often ask her
"are you looking for the mother lode"
huh
no.
no my child, this is not my desire
and then she said

i'm digging for fire [4x]

there is this old man 
who spent so much of his life sleeping
that he is able to keep awake for the rest of his years
he resides
on a beach
in a town
where i am going to live
and i often ask him
"are you looking for the mother lode"
huh
no.
no my child, this is not my desire
and then he said

i'm digging for fire [4x]
