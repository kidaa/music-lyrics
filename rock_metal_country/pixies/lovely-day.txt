At the station, at the border an egression to the exterior law and order
upward plantation
i remember your red dress
like a field full o' poppy
you were making me dreamy
stunned by a love got to do what your head says
could not let it stop me
they got one leaving today
and it's going away
got my feet in the stirrup
it can be kind of banal
but i dream of your red dress
riding down these dry canals
oh baby it's not europe
but i'm sending you money
i'm sending you lots of money
so you can buy a ticket
you will be my martian honey all the day
they got one leaving today
and it's going away.
