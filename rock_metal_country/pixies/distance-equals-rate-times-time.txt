I had a vision
there wasn't any television
from looking into the sun
looking into the sun
we got to think quick
says blind st. nick hey
from looking into the sun
looking into the sun
we got to get some beer
we got no atmosphere
from looking into the sun
looking into the sun
i had a vision
there wasn't any television
from looking into the sun.
