All in a day
All for me
Trek across the space
It'll be just like they say

Oo, oo, 
Oo, oo
Yeah

Since I am told
Month number three
He has no memory
Of flyers in the night

Oo, oo
Oo, oo
Yeah

They went away [2X]
My manta ray is all right [4X]

Police they say
My mother too
A fish from Mon Shamoo 
Above my head tonight

Oo, oo
Oo, oo
Yeah

There is a way [2X]
My manta ray is all right [7X]
While Black Francis screams "All right!"
All right
