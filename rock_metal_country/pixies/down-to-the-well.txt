down to the well

betty always knows
betty always tells
she laughing desperately
she said it felt like a river inside her bones
when she went down to the well

gonna be with her
she is gonna take me there
lead me by my hand
her body a rocking chair for my soul

i can hardly wait, baby
i can hardly wait
'til we go down to the well
down to the well

been thinking to myself
and if a life's not long
what matter does it make
if there'll be favorite songs playing in my head
when we go down to the well

i can hardly wait, betty
i can hardly wait
'till we go down to the well
down to the well
