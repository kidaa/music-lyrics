Estaba pensando sobreviviendo con mi sister en New Jersey, *
Ella me dijo que es una vida buena alla,
Bien rica bien chevere, Y voy!  Puneta! 

[TRANSLATION]

I was thinking surviving with my sister in New Jersey, *
She told me it's a good life there,
Very good very nice, Here I Go!  Jerk off!

We'll keep well bred,
We'll stay well fed,
We'll have our sons,
They will be all well hung.

They'll come and play,
Their friends will say,
Your daddy's rich,
Your mamma's a pretty thing.

That maid Maria she's really O.K.

Vamos a jugar por la playa [x5]
[Let's go play by the beach]

I keep getting friends,
Looking like lesbians,
If we get bored,
We'll move to California.

They'll come and play,
Their friends will say,
Your daddy's rich,
Your mamma's a pretty thing.

That maid Maria she's really O.K.

Vamos a jugar por la playa [x5]
