- ...girls and fucked 'em at school
All I know is that 
There were rumours he was into field hockey players
There were rumours
- So he applied basically
- He was gone the next day
- And went off with the team
- It's like - he was got - they'd just like
It was like so hush hush
They were so... quiet about it
And then the next thing you know...

The day before that I was wed
She went upstairs and she cut her hair away

I'm amazed [3x]

And when I was a little boy
A ball of string my parents took from me

I'm amazed [3x]

Before I died, I took my Honda
And packed it up, up, up to Arizona honey

I'm amazed , I'm amazed, I'm amazed [4x]
