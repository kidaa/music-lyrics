Every little thing that I felt that day 
Never will forget, there was love in the air 
I wasn't looking for love to come my way 
Ooh baby baby but then I saw you there 

That Summer day that I recall 
You came into my life 
And you gave me hope and love 
I just want to be where you want me to 
That Summer day that changed it all 
You came into my life 
And you let me fall in love 
My baby I just want to be with you 

I just want to let it shine 
I just want to let it shine 
I just want to let it shine 

Did you ever think you knew everything? 
Did you ever think you had it all figured out? 
Ooh baby baby 
You know things can change 
But someone ? 

That Summer day that I recall 
You came into my life 
And you gave me hope and love 
I just want to be where you want me to 
That Summer day that changed it all 
You came into my life 
And you let me fall in love 
My baby I just want to be with you 

Can you hear me, baby? 
When I say I'm for you 
I knew we could make it 
The moment you came into my life 
Don't you know that you keep me ? 

That Summer day that I recall 
You came into my life 
And you gave me hope and love 
I just want to be where you want me to 
That Summer day that changed it all 
You came into my life 
And you let me fall in love 
My baby I just want to be with you 

And I'm gonna let it shine 
Yeah, I'm gonna let it shine 
Yes, I'm gonna let it shine 

I just want to let it shine 
I just want to let it shine
