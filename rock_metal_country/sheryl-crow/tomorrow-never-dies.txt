Darling I'm kill
I'm in puddle on the floor
Waiting for you to return
Oh what a trill
Vacillations good lord
How to tease
How you leave me to burn
It's so deadly my dear
The power of wanting you near

[CHORUS]
Until the day
Until the world falls away
Until you say there will no more good-byes
I see it in your eyes
Tomorrow never dies 

Darling you won
It's no fun
Martinis, girls, and guns
It's murder on our love affair
You bet your life 
Every night
While you chase every morning die
You're not the only spy out there
It's so deadly my dear
The power of wanting you near

[Chorus]

Until the day...
