There's something I need to show you
My head in my hands
'Cause I don't understand
When I don't even know you,
How you melted my heart in two

I wake up in the morning,
Follow you and then hide
Just to watch you walk by
Comes on me with no warning
I think about you and I get high

To assure you I even exist
Do I tell you it's you that I've missed?
Well if love is a cocktail of all that you do,
I get drunk with the thought of you
I get drunk with the thought of you

I can't stand all this freedom
I've been there before
And it's such a good bore
You're all I ever needed
If you'd only walk through my door

To assure you I even exist
Do I tell you it's you that I've missed?
Well if love is a cocktail of all that you do,
I get drunk with the thought of you
I get drunk with the thought of you

I could wait my whole life for this moment to come
With a long list of beautiful chances I've blown
Well if love is a cocktail of all that you do,
I get drunk with the thought of you
I get drunk with the thought of you
I get drunk with the thought of you
