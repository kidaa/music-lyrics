Find someone in love
Hold them so close
It's not close enough
Moment to moment time's slipping away
While you're looking for something you're hoping to find
Are the things that you wanted within all the time

You say stop
Stop the world spinning
Faster and faster
We're losing our way
You say stop
Stop all this running
Wanting to stay in one place

Oh I know I was wrong
Selfish am I to let you go on
Just couldn't see what your love meant to me
Till it was gone and all hope has faded away
I could beg I could pray
That you'd come back one day

But you say stop
Stop the world spinning
Faster and faster
We're losing our way
You say stop
Stop all the running
Wanting to stay in one place

Next time I know
There's no time to waste
If there is a next time
I will stand up and say

I say stop
Stop the world spinning
Faster and faster
We're losing our way
I said stop
I'm only beginning to understand half the way
Time slips away

You say stop
Time slips away
Away
