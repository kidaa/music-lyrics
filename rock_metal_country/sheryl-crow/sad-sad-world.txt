Sad Sad World 

      I know you hate me, 
      I see that now 
      If I was unhappy, 
      I'd be someone you could still care about 
      I think it's stupid and sad 
      That everything turned out so bad 
      And enemies make the most interesting friends 

      I'm gonna write you a long letter 
      I'm gonna get you on the telephone 
      Three little words to make it all better 
      Maybe I'll leave this whole thing alone 

      Oh, it's a sad, sad world 
      Without you in it 
      And I'm a bad, bad girl 
      For letting you down 
      And I remember every crazy minute 
      Oh, it's a sad, sad world 
      Without you around 

      We're too much alike 
      For our own good 
      We both hate fighting 
      No matter how misunderstood 

      Well, I want to tell you 
      That you're stubborn 
      And I want to tell you 
      I never lied 
      And I want to tell you 
      That your friends talk way too much 
      And I want to know 
      What happened to that friend of mine 

      Oh, it's a sad, sad world 
      Without you in it 
      And I was a bad, bad girl 
      For letting you down 
      And I remember every crazy minute 
      Oh, it's a sad, sad world 
      Without you around 

      Oh, it's a sad, sad world 
      Without you in it 
      And I'm a bad, bad girl 
      For letting you down 
      I remember every fucked up minute 
      Oh, it's a sad, sad world 
      Without you around
