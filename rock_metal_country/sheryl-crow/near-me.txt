Near Me 

      I've been watching you from the corner of my eye 
      I can't stand it, be too close, can't stand it 
      Be too far and I can't say why, yeah 
      And as the shadow fades 
      Where you walk away 
      My secret's written all across my face 

      I only want you near me 
      I only want you near me 
      Tonight, tonight 
      I only want you near me 
      I only want you near me 
      Tonight, ohh 

      Oh, I've been watching you from the corner of the sea 
      You are silent 
      Eyes of eyes 
      You are silent 
      Hands of hands 
      And I want them both on me 
      But in the quiet strain 
      The mention of your name 
      And I'm running from you 
      And running to you all the same 

      I only want you near me 
      I only want you near me 
      Tonight, tonight 
      I only want you near me 
      I only want you near me 
      Tonight, oh tonight 
      I only want you near me 
      I only want you near me 
      Tonight 
      Round and round we go 
      The shadows dance by so slow 
      But only for me to know 

      I only want you near me 
      I only want you near me 
      Tonight, oh tonight 
      I only want you near me 
      I only want you near me 
      Tonight, oh tonight 
      I only want you near me 
      I only want you near me 
      Tonight 
      Hey yeah 

      I only want you near me
