All Kinds Of People 

      There's a time for love, and a time for healing 
      You can't go back and undo what's been done 
      Word of mouth, time is revealing 
      Just how far we've let this kingdom come 

      Hand in hand, we're finding our way 
      And today is just tomorrow's yesterday 

      Some will die for you; some would lie to you 
      There's all kinds of people in this world 
      Turn the world around, tear the borders down 
      There's all kinds of people in this world 

      Yeahhhh 

      A kiss of life, and the hand of faith 
      A boy grows up into his father's son 
      And he learns to love, he's been taught to hate 
      To carry on the way it has been done 

      All our lives it's debts to repay 
      And then someday we can put the past away 

      Some will die for you, some would lie to you 
      There's all kinds of people in this world 
      Turn the world around, tear the borders down 
      There's all kinds of people in this world 
      Some will die for you; some would lie to you 
      There's all kinds of people in this world 
      Put your fear away, find a better way, 
      There's all kinds of people in this world 

      Yeahhhh 

      In a moment, things can change 
      One look behind and it's never the same 

      Some will die for you, some would lie to you 
      There's all kinds of people in this world 
      Turn the world around, tear the borders down 
      There's all kinds of people in this world 
      all kinds of people of people in this world 
      Some will die for you, some would lie to you 
      There's all kinds of people in this world 
      Put your fear away, find a better way, 
      There's all kinds of people in this world 
      Some will die for you; some would lie to you 
      There's all kinds of people in this world 
      Put your fear away, find a better way, 
      There's all kinds of people in this world
