I left a man
Asleep in the nude
My name is my pocket
With lipstick and rouge
Everything I ever wanted,
What a lovely pie you baked,
Is anybody listening/
Don't the painted birds ever fly away

It's just an ordinary morning
It's just an ordinary day
And I'm just an ordinary woman
Slipping away

The walls have been talking
About me again
I'm good for a joke, but when I awoke
The dream didn't end
Now everytime I turn around
I'm only sleeping, John, is anybody out there
Don't the wounded birds still sing

It's just an ordinary morning
It's just an ordinary day
And I'm just an ordinary woman
Slipping away
