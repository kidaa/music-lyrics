On The Outside 

      I stood close enough to hear you say 
      "Do as the beautiful once did" 
      Tore out my picture from its frame 
      Just wanted to be one of you 

      Standing on the outside 
      Lookin' 
      Lookin' 
      Funny how you see the truth 
      But the feeling does come back 
      To you 

      She's crazy as anyone can be 
      That's what they say 
      They say it me 
      Wanting love can make one do 
      Isn't my fault 
      Heredity 

      Standin' on the outside 
      Lookin' 
      Lookin' 
      State of grace 
      State of sin 
      Standin' on the outside 
      Lookin' 
      Lookin' 
      I cannot feel a single thing 
      But the feeling does come back 
      Again Just what it feels like yesterday 
      Yesterday follows me around 
      Where do you go when no one cares? 
      Six feet under 
      Underground 

      Standin' on the outside 
      Lookin' 
      Lookin' 
      State of grace 
      State of sin 
      Standin' on the outside 
      Lookin' 
      Lookin' 
      I cannot feel a single thing 
      But the feeling will come back 
      Again - again
