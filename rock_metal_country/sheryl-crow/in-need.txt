Every night I dream you're next to me
Tenderly
You say my name
You stay close enough to keep me here
Then disappear
When we're face to face

And if you carry me tonight
I would be strong enough to fight
And when you're weak and can't go on
I'd be the bed you lay upon
And blue is blue
And so am I
Cause I want to be with you tonight
You're not the only one in need

You know everybody's watching me
And what they see
Is me watching you
In the middle, time is creeping by
And I wonder why
You're so removed

And if you carry me tonight
I would be strong enough to fight
And when you're weak and can't go on
I'd be the bed you lay upon
And blue is blue
And so am I
Cause I want to be with you tonight
You're not the only one in need

Come on baby
Life is just a net into which you dive
And I'm getting
Closer to you now

If I love you
Will you run away
And if I stay
Will I disappear

And if you carry me tonight
I would be strong enough to fight
And when you're weak and can't go on
I'd be the bed you lay upon
And blue is blue
And so am I
Cause I want to be with you tonight

And blue is blue
And so are we
And you're not the only one in need
