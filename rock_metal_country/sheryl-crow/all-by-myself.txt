All By Myself 
      originally by Eric Carmen 

      When I was young 
      I never needed anyone 
      And making love was just for fun 
      Those days are gone 

      Living alone 
      I think to all the friends I've known 
      But when I dial the telephone 
      Nobody is home 

      All by myself 
      Don't wanna be 
      All by myself 
      I want to leave 
      All by myself I want to be sure 
      Sometimes I feel so insecure 
      Love so distant and obscure 
      Remains occured 

      All by myself 
      Don't wanna be 
      All by myself 
      I want to leave 
      All by myself
