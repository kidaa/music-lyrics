Oooh....

Doctor, my eyes have seen the years
And the slow parade of tears
Without crying
Now i want to understand...

I have done all that I could
To see the evil and the good
Without hiding
You must help me, if you can...

Doctor my eyes...
Tell me what is wrong
Was I unwise...
To leave them open for so long

Cause I have wondered through this world
And as each moment has infurred
I've been waiting
To awaken, from these dreams...

People go just where they will
I never noticed them until
I got the feeling-
That it's later, than it seems...

Doctor my eyes...
Tell me what they see
I hear their cries...
Just say if it's too late for me

[music break]

Doctor my eyes...
Tell me what you see
I hear their cries...
Just say if it's too late for me

Doctor my eyes...
Cannot see the sky
Is this the price...
For having learned how not to cry..y.

Oooh...
Won't you help me understand
Oooh...
I wanna understand
Oooh...
I wanna understand
Oooh...
Oh, doctor, doctor help me, oh
Oooh...
I can hear the people crying
Oooh...
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oooh...
Help me understand
Oooh...
Help me understand
Oooh...
