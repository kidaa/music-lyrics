I saw your rantin' on TV today
I heard you tell me to reload
You got a lot of nerve to talk that way
Someone unplug the microphone

I'm tired of all the fighting
Cynicism and back-biting
Can't even hear myself think
You pour the Kool-Aid and then we drink

So much noise, so much chatter
Does the truth even matter?

Say, say what you want to
Even though you never mean it
Say, say what you want to
Ain't got time to be wastin' time

Say, say what you want to
We had a chance and now we're gonna blow it
Say, say what you want to
If this is America, you'd never know it

Ignorance is patriotic
Reason is idiotic
Winds of change keep on blowin'
If this is America, you'd never know it

So much noise, so much chatter
Does the truth even matter?

Say, say what you want to
Even though you never mean it
Say, say what you want to
Ain't got time to be wastin' time

Say, say what you want to
We had a chance, now we're gonna blow it
Say, say what you want to
If this is America, you'd never know it

All you little ones with open hearts
Don't let hatred tear your world apart
And if you wonder who is wrong or who is right
Better go ask God to shine some light

Earthquakes and jihad Jane
Talkin' heads and hate campaigns
If aliens should land today
Who would be more afraid, us or them?

Say, say what you want to
Even though you never mean it
Say, say what you want to
Ain't got time to be wastin' time

Say, say what you want to
We had a chance, now we're gonna blow it
Say, say what you want to
If this is America, you'd never know it

Say, say what you want to
You gotta say it, say
Say, say what you want to
Whatever's on your mind

Say, say what you want to
Give me a microphone, baby
Say, say what you want to
All the things I want to say

Say, say what you want to
Say, say what you want to
Say, say what you want to
Say, say what you want to
Are you lovers, are you haters?

Say, say what you want to
Can someone say, yeah?
Say, say what you want to
Say, say what you want to
