I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree

Christmas eve will find me
Where the lovelight gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

I'll be home for Christmas
There'll be snow and mistletoe

Christmas eve will find me
Where the lovelight gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
If only in my dreams
