Everyone is talking about me
How my heart is broken
But they don't see

When you're lonely inside
The world looks so carefree
When you're lonely inside
You just can't see

Does anybody want you
Does anybody need you
The question is
Does anybody want you
Does anybody need you
The question is
All I really know for certain, babe
Is that Love Is All There Is

Every now and then
There comes a time
Someone comes along
To change your mind

You believe it's unwise
To give in to careless dreams
You believe it's a prize
You'll never win

Does anybody want you
Does anybody need you
The question is
Does anybody want you
Does anybody need you
The question is
All I really know for certain, babe
Is that Love Is All There Is

You believe it's unwise
To give in to careless dreams
If you don't see that is why
You will never know

Does anybody want you
Does anybody need you
The question is
Does anybody want you
Does anybody need you
The question is
All I really know for certain, babe
Is that Love Is All There Is
