Happy

      Never kept a dollar past sunset, it always burned a hole in my pants 
      Never made a school mama happy, never blew a second chance 

      I need a love to keep me happy, I need a love to keep happy 
      Baby baby keep me happy, baby baby keep me happy 

      Always took candy from strangers, didn't want to get me no trade 
      Never want to be like papa, working for the boss everynight and day 

      Never got a flash out of cocktails when I got some flesh off the bone 
      Never a lift out of lear jets when I can fly way back home
