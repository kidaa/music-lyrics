Love You Blind 

      Love and harmony, soul inspiration and prophecy 
      We make love and we make joy, one girl and one more boy 
      Say, we are, everybody's eyes, lay down your guns and recognize 
      There's only one way, if you leave me no choice, but to love you blind 

      Tell me people, who's leading who 
      And tell me people, who's following who 
      A world asleep, is a world in deep, oh yeah 
      We don't have to be this way 

      Everybody say, we are the world to come 
      A place of love and a world of one 
      One mind can generate, what we anticipate 
      Say, we make war when we couldn't make peace 
      Tell me who is the man in the driver seat 
      There's only one way, if you leave me no choice, but to love you blind 

      Tell me people, who's leading who 
      And tell me people, who's following who 
      A world asleep, is a world in deep, oh yeah, oh oh yeah 
      We don't have to be this way 

      ???????????? a common sky, everybody knows that we've got to try 
      Hold back the tears, and break that chain 
      Let love rule again 
      Signs will come of what we do now, you and me, and me and you
