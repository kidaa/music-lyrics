The world could fall apart
But you're my heart, my dear
I will sing this song
'Til we are gone, my dear

How do I keep you from losing your way
Hope you'll go out and you'll come back some day
But love is letting go
And this I'll know

Cause you were mine
For a time

I could shape your mind
But why waste time, my dear
There's so much more to know
And I can show you dear

How do I keep you from losing your way

Hope you'll go out and you'll come back some day
But love is letting go
And this I'll know

Cause you were mine
For a time

I have held you close
And breathed your name, my dear
I was with you then
And will remain, my dear

How do I keep you from losing your way
Hope you will find love like I did some day
But love is letting go
And this I'll know

Cause you were mine
For a time
