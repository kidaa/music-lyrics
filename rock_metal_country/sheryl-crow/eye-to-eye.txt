Na, na, na-na, na-na, na
Na, na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
Na, na, na-na, na-na, na
Na, na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na

Blood and wine may flow
Only love and war make history
We must share flesh and bone
But we don't share philosophy

Some people got a ways to go
Some lessons they don't ever learn
To keep your enemies close
The other cheek you soon will turn

If we don't see eye to eye
That doesn't mean that we can't try
To get along

If we don't see eye to eye
No matter what, you and I
We belong
Together, together

Na, na, na-na, na-na, na
Na, na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
Na, na, na-na, na-na, na
Na, na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na

Don't lay your worries on me
I got my own to keep me company
Talk is like a worn out suit
Comes unraveled when it turns cheap

You can have all that I own
But my soul you'll never keep
I'll dig a hole and I'll call it home
'Cause I have learned how to dig deep
How to dig deep

Na, na, na-na, na-na, na
Na, na, na-na, na-na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na-na, na-na, na
Na, na, na-na, na-na, na, na, na, na

If we don't see eye to eye
That doesn't mean that we can't try
To get along

If we don't see eye to eye
No matter what, you and I
We belong
We belong

If we don't see eye to eye
That doesn't mean that we can't try
To get along
Get along

If we don't see eye to eye
No matter what, you and I
We belong
Together, together

Na, na, na-na, na-na, na
Na, na, na-na, na-na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na-na, na-na, na
Na, na, na-na, na-na, na, na, na, na

Na, na, na-na, na-na, na
Na, na, na-na, na-na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na-na, na-na, na
Na, na, na-na, na-na, na, na, na, na

Na, na, na-na, na-na, na
Na, na, na-na, na-na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na-na, na-na, na
Na, na, na-na, na-na, na, na, na, na
