We made love all day
In our little hide away

But I blew up our love nest
By making one little request

Diamond ring
Diamond ring
Don't mean anything
Diamond ring
Diamond ring
Should not mean a thing

You could say I do
Hide your negative reviews
You love me you say
But you can't even face the day

Diamond ring
Diamond ring
Don't mean anything
Diamond ring
Diamond ring
Should not change

Some say love is blind
But I say love is only in the mind

Diamonds may be sweet
But to me they just bring on cold feet

Someday you'll be like me
With someone who just wants to be free

Diamond ring
Diamond ring
Don't mean anything
Diamond ring
Diamond ring
Should not mean a thing
