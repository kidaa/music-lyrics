Burn This Bed 
      originally by Farm Dogs 

      What's outside 
      We don't need in here 
      Trash the headlines, smash the TV
      Get rid of everything except you and me 
      I've had it up to here 
      Too many workin'hours 
      Haulin' crates, takin' shit 
      Being just a brick in an ivory tower 

      But they can't take this, babe 
      This time is ours 
      Let's make love rough 
      Let's fight back 
      Let's get naked
      Let's attack 
      Let's bite and scratch 
      Flesh on flesh 
      We can love each other both to death 
      Set each other both on fire 
      Let's burn this bed 
      Burn this bed Steel skies 
      Are crashing overhead 
      Leads up to temptation, arch your back 
      Strike a match along your beautiful leg 
      There are some things 
      They can't make me do 
      No man can, when I'm home 
      Stayin' up all night to work on you 

      But they can't take this babe 
      This time is ours 
      I'll rock an' roll ya 
      I'll kiss your eyes 
      Run my hands 
      Up and down your thighs
      Hour for hour 
      Let's sweat or sex 
      We can love each other both to death 
      Let's burn this bed 
      Yeah burn this bed
