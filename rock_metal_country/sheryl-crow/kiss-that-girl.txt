I woke up this mornin' with my makeup on   
      I've been fakin' it lately, but those days are gone   
      You look at me and wonder why   
      I got to cut these strings and learn to fly   

      But the girl is only in your mind   
      She's leavin' everything behind   
      She's not the girl that's gonna make it right   
      So you can kiss that girl goodbye    


      We're so glad you made it in this dead end town  
      Everybody's waiting for you to come down  
      You're gonna wake up from your dream  
      You're gonna find someone who looks like me  

      But the girl is only in your mind  
      She's leavin' everything behind  
      She's not the girl that's gonna make it right  
      So you can kiss that girl goodbye  

      You could look forever for someone like me  
      She's just a memory  

      So you can kiss the girl goodbye  
      Kiss that girl goodbye  
      So you can kiss the girl goodbye  
      So you can kiss that girl goodbye
