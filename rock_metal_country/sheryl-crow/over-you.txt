I feel like cherry wine
Like Valentines
Like a Spring is coming
And everything is all right
I've got a love that's new
I hear you're happy too
That's the way it should be
But lately I feel like crying o

[CHORUS:]
I wanna get over you
But you're everywhere
And I just can't get away
I gotta get over you
Cause it's just not fair
That I still see your face o

I heard your name today
I walked away
Cause everyone's still talking
I don't need that in my life
Got better things to do
Than worry about you
I'm gonna keep on walking
But sometimes I don't know why

[CHORUS]

Well we had a good time
But time goes on
You didn't really want me until I was gone
I wanna get over you
Before you get over me
Over me

[CHORUS]
