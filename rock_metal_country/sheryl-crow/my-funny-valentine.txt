My Funny Valentine 
      From the movie For Hope 

      My funny Valentine 
      Sweet comic Valentine 
      You make me smile with my heart 
      Your looks are laughable 
      Unphotographable 
      Yet you're my favourite work of art 

      Is your figure less then breath 
      Is your mouth full little weed 
      When you open it to speak 
      Are you smiling But don't change a hair for me 
      Not if you care for me 
      Stay little Valentine 
      Stay 
      Each day is Valentine's day
