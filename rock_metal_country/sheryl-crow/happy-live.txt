Happy Live 

      Never kept a dollar past sunset 
      Always got a hole in my pants 
      Never took candy from strangers 
      Always get a second chance 
      Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
      I need a love to make me happy 
      I need a love baby wont you make me happy 
      Baby wont you make me happy 

      Well I was never much of a school boy 
      Never wanna give me no chain 
      Never want to be like papa 
      Working for the boss every night and day 

      I need a love to make me happy 
      I need a love, baby to make me happy 
      Baby wont you make me happy 
      Baby wont you make me happy 

      I need a love to make me happy 
      I need a love. baby wont you make me happy 
      Baby wont you make me happy 

      I never seem to run out of cocktails 
      Always take the flesh off the bone 
      Never wanna be like papa 
      Now flying flying home! 

      I need a love to make me happy 
      I need a love baby wont you make me happy 
      I need a love to make me happy 
      i need a love baby wont you make me happy 
      yeah yeah yeah..baby wont you make me
