On Borrowed Time 

      Remember not to say a word 
      If they ask about me 
      Say you haven't heard 

      Sweet communion 
      Of the forbidden kind 
      I live to love you 
      Only on borrowed time 

      Are you waiting 
      Waiting in the dark 
      For a message, for a sign 
      Precious these days 
      Living our ways 
      On borrowed time 
      Yeah 

      Fallen angel 
      Where do you hide your heart 
      Under some angry ??? 
      Alone you fall apart 

      Oh, you're not forgotten 
      You're always on my mind 
      Whispering words I'm waiting, waiting 
      Only on borrowed time 

      Someone's praying 
      Praying for your life 
      For a miracle or sign 
      Precious these days 
      Living our ways 
      On borrowed time 

      I'll be waiting 
      Waiting in the night 
      For a message, for a sign 
      Precious there days 
      Living our ways 
      On borrowed time
