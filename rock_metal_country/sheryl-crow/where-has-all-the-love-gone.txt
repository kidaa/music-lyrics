Today I saw the strangest thing on the evening news
A man who wasn't sad at all about what's going on
And even though I'm trying to smile
With everything I see it could take a while

[Chorus:]
I've been looking everywhere I go
Where has all the love, where has all the love gone?
I've been looking all around to know
Where has all the love, where has all the love gone?

Yesterday I heard you say you never close your eyes
Sometimes the world's a scary ride, it's hard to hang on
Along the way we got off track
And if we turn around can we ever get back?

[Chorus]

You say it was there when we were young
Today I saw a flag roll by on a wooden box
And if it's true we lost our way
Then what have we got?

[Chorus 2x]

Today I saw the strangest thing
