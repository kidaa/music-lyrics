There is a rose
Grows in the moonlight
And just like desire
Creeps up in the night

You'll never know
How deep is the pain
Until I hear you say
That you feel the same

Only you and I
Know about the love we share
Only time and space
Could ever keep us, keep us apart

Where there is a will
Baby, there is a way
Pull your body into mine
Lose yourself in the sway

I'll feel what you feel
I wanna crave what you crave
Cause roses and moonlight
Never fade away

And deep in the night
You call my name
To want you so much
Is a mysterious game

Turn up the heat
Bodies on fire
Go on and teach me
The ways of desire

Only you and I
Know about the love we share
Only time and space
Could ever keep us, keep us apart

Where there is a will
Baby, there is a way
Pull your body into mine
Lose yourself in the sway

I'll feel what you feel
I wanna crave what you crave
Cause roses and moonlight
Never fade away

Where there is a will
Baby, there is a way
Pull your body into mine
Lose yourself in the sway

I'll feel what you feel
I wanna crave what you crave
Cause roses and moonlight
Never fade away

I don't creep baby, till late at night
I don't creep baby, till late at night
I don't creep baby, till late at night
Dance baby dance, pull your body into mine
I don't creep baby, till late at night
I don't creep baby, till late at night
I don't creep baby, till late at night
Dance baby dance, pull your body into mine

I don't creep baby, till late at night
I don't creep baby, till late at night
I don't creep baby, till late at night
Dance baby dance, pull your body into mine
