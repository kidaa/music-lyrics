My friend the communist 
Holds meetings in his RV 
I cant afford his gas
So Im stuck here watching TV
I dont have digital
I dont have diddly squat
Its not having what you want
Its wanting what youve got o 

CHORUS: 
Im gonna soak up the sun
Gonna tell everyone 
To lighten up Im gonna tell 'em that
Ive got no one to blame
For every time I feel lame
Im looking up o Im gonna soak up the sun
Im gonna soak up the sun
Ive got a crummy job
It dont pay near enough
To buy the things it takes
To win me some of your love
Every time I turn around
Im looking up, youre looking down
Maybe somethings wrong with you
That makes you act the way you do 

CHORUS 

Im gonna soak up the sun
While its still free
Im gonna soak up the sun
Before it goes out on me
Dont have no master suite
Im still the king of me
You have a fancy ride, but baby
Im the one who has the key
Every time I turn around
Im looking up, youre looking down
Maybe somethings wrong with you
That makes you act the way you do
Maybe I am crazy too 

CHORUS 

Im gonna soak up the sun
Got my 45 on
So I can rock on.
