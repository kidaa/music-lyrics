Fortunately you
Have someone who relies on you
We started out as friends
But the thought of you just caves me in

The symptoms are so deep
It's much too late to turn away
We started out as friends

Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby
Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby

Time, I'm sure, will bring
Disappointments in so many things
It seems to be the way
When your gambling cards on love you play

I'd rather be in Hell
With you, baby, than in cool Heaven
It seems to be the way

Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby
Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby

Birds never looked into the sun
Before the day is gone
Oh, the light shines bright
On a peaceful day

A stranger blue leaves us alone
We don't want to deal with you
We'll shed our stains showering
In the room that makes the rain

All alone with you
Makes the butterflies in me arise
Slowly we make love
And the Earth rotates in our dictates
Slowly we make love

Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby
Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby

Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby
Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby

Sign your name
Sign your name across my heart, baby
Sign your name across my heart, baby
