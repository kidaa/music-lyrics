Get Off My Cloud 
      originally by Rolling Stones 

      I live in an apartment on the ninety ninth foor of my block 
      And I sit at home lookin' out the window imaginin' the world has stopped 
      Then in flies a guy that's all dressed up like a Union Jack 
      He says I've won five pounds if I have this kind ogf detergent pack 

      I said, hey you get off my cloud, hey you get off my cloud 
      Hey you get off my cloud, don't hang around 
      'Cause two's a crowd on my cloud baby 

      The telephone is ringin', I say hi it's me, who's there on the line 
      A voice says hi hullo how are you, well I guess I'm doing fine 
      He says it's three a.m. and there's too much noise, don't you people ever want 
      To go bed, just 'cause you feel so good, so you have to drive me out of my head 

      I was sick and tired, fed up with this and decided to take a drive downtown 
      It was so very quiet and peaceful, there was nobody, not a soul around 
      I laid myself out, I was so tired and I started to dream 
      In the mornin' the parkin' tickets were just like flags stuck on my wind screen
