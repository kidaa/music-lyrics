White Room 

      Ah, in a white room with black curtains, near the stations 
      Blackroof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings 
      Silver horses, run down moonbeams in your dark eyes 
      Drawnlight smiles on your leaving, my contentment 

      I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines 
      Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves 

      You said no strings could secure you at the station 
      Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows 
      I walked into such a sad time at the station 
      When I walked out, felt my own need just beginning I'll sleep in this place where the sun never shines 
      Wait in the dark where the shadows run from themselves 

      At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd 
      Consolation from the old wound now frogotten 
      Yellow tiggers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes 
      She's just dressing goodbye windows, tired starlings 

      I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back 
      Wait here with you where the shadows run from themselves
