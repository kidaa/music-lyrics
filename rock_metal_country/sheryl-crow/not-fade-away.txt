Not Fade Away 
      originally by Rolling Stones 

      I wanna tell you how it's gonna be 
      You're gonna give your love to me 
      I wanna love you night and day 
      Well love is love and not fade away 
      Well love is love and not fade away 

      My love's bigger than a cadillac 
      I'll try to show it if you drive me back 
      Your love for me has got to be real 
      For you to know just how I feel 
      Lovin' real'll not fade away 

      I'm gonna tell you how it's gonna be 
      You're gonna give your love to me 
      Love to last more than one day
