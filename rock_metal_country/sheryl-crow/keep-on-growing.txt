Keep On Growing 
      originally by Eric Clapton 

      I was laughing 
      Playing in the streets, I was unknowing 
      I didn't know my fate 

      Playing 
      The game of love, but never really showing 
      I thought that love could wait 

      I was a young girl and sure to go astray 
      You walked right into my life and told me love would find a way 

      To keep on growing, keep on growing 
      Keep on growing 

      I was standing 
      Looking in the face of one who loved me 
      Feeling so ashamed 

      Hoping 
      And praying, Lord, that he could understand me 
      But I didn't know his name He took my hand in his and told me I was wrong 
      He said, you're gonna be all right girl, oh just as long 

      As you keep on growing, keep on growing 
      Keep on growing, yeah, yeah, yeah 

      Maybe 
      Someday baby, who knows where or when, Lord 
      Just you wait and see 

      We'll be walking 
      Together hand in hand, alone forever 
      Man just you and me 

      'Cause time is gonna change us, Lord, and I know it's true 
      Our love is gonna keep on glowing and growing and it's all we gotta do 

      Keep on growing, keep on growing 
      Keep on growing, yeah, yeah, yeah 
      Keep on growing, keep on growing 
      Keep on growing
