You Always Get Your Way 

      Well then 
      I guess that's it then 
      As you trip on my rug on your way out the door 
      To your new found freedom 
      You always get your way 

      Happy 
      We can't be happy 
      For I've learned 
      That reality is only opinion 
      We disagreed, dear 
      Some opinions can't persuade 

      Crazy 
      My thinkin' was hazy 
      Placin' you 
      In the kitchen with apron and skillet preparing me dinner 
      But to serve's not your fortay 

      Lonely 
      I bet I was only 
      Lookin' in your direction for some small affection 
      But you made me love you 
      Cuz you always get your way 

      Always always 
      Isn't it boring? 
      Day after day 
      After day 
      After day 
      After day 

      Your suspicion 
      And all my ambition 
      Creates nothing less than an incredible mess 
      So I guess good luck darlin' 
      Is all I have to say 

      Kill me 
      You said you'd kill me 
      Baby those are just words 
      That in anger 
      You say but I surely would hate it 
      If you ever got your way 
      And you always get your way 
      You always get your way
