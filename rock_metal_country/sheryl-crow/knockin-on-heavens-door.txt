Knockin' On Heaven's Door 
      originally by Bob Dylan 

      Mama, take this badge off of me, 
      I can't use it anymore. 
      It's gettin' dark, too dark to see, 
      I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door. 

      Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door, 
      Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door, 
      Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door, 
      Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door, 

      Mama, take these guns away from me, 
      I can't shoot them anymore. 
      That long black cloud is followin' me, 
      I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.
