Little Wing 
      originally by Jimi Hendrix 

      Well, she's walking through the clouds 
      With a circus mind that's running wild 
      Butterflies and zebras and fairy tales 
      That's all she ever thinks about 

      When I'm sad she comes to me 
      With a thousand smiles she gives to me free 
      She says, it's all right, take anything you want from me, anything 
      Fly on, little wing
