Money That's What I Want 

      The best things in life are free 
      You can give them to the birds and bees 
      I want money, that's what I want 

      Money don't buy everything, it's true 
      What it don't buy I can't use 
      I want money, that's what I want 

      Your love give such a thrill 
      But your love don't pay my bills 
      I want money, that's what I want
