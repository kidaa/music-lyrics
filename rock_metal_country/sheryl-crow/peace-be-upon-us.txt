Walking down the street of dreams, eating from the fruits of life
Tripping now on the smallest things
Trying to reach the light, trying to reach the light
Pick the key up off the floor, put the key into the lock
Turn the lock, open up the door
Look at all you've got, look at all you've got
All the sinners are saints, all you creatures of faith
Don't need to be afraid
If you know what I mean let me hear you say

Peace be upon us, peace be upon us
Be upon us all
Peace be upon us, peace be upon us
Be upon us all
Yeah

The world will turn even when we're gone
The earth will host many souls to come
Who will write the history?
Tales of wise men, villains, and innocent ones
All you shepherds and sheep, when you wake from your sleep
It will be a new day
If you know what I mean let me hear you say

Peace be upon us, peace be upon us
Be upon us all
Peace be upon us, peace be upon us
Be upon us all
Yeah

Peace be upon us, peace be upon us
Be upon us all
Peace be upon us, peace be upon us
Be upon us all
Yeah
