I Will Walk With You 

      Cover your heart 
      Put on mask 
      Dance with my slowly 
      Is all that i ask 
      What is the hardest? 
      Falling in love 
      Knowing just where to begin or start 

      I will walk 
      I will walk with you 
      I will walk with you 

      Lay down beside me 
      Tell me your dreams 
      The view from inside 
      Is not what it seems 
      But no one will hurt you 
      Not like before 
      Your last thread of forgiveness
      Won't reach the door no.. 

      I will walk 
      I will walk with you 
      I will walk with you 
      I will walk 
      I will walk with you...yeah.. 

      Pull up the curtains 
      Watch the night fall 
      Who has the answers 
      When no body calls? 
      Now the life fury 
      Blame the sunrise next 
      Becuase i was in love with you 
      But i can't change the past 

      I will walk 
      I will walk with you 
      I will walk with you..
