I Feel Happy 

      Mamma's got a feeling, she's up all night 
      Do we give in? 
      Do we let go of the fight? 
      Well I don't know 

      Don't wanna be down, dragged through, messed around 
      Everybody's got their little fights to fight 
      I say no 

      I Feel Happy 
      I Feel Happy 
      I Feel Happy 
      Nothing you can say or do 
      Is ever gonna make me feel blue 
      No, no 

      Monkey see and monkey do 
      Follow me, I'll follow you 
      Well not tonight 
      Not this time 

      So cool to be suicidal 
      Maybe I will get up and feel good today 
      Cause this is my life 

      I Feel Happy 
      I Feel Happy 
      I Feel Happy 
      Nothing you can say or do 
      Is ever gonna make me feel blue 
      No, no 

      Monkey see and monkey do 
      Follow me, I'll follow you 
      Well not tonight 
      Not this time 

      So cool to be suicidal 
      Maybe I will get up and feel good today 
      Cause this is my life 

      I Feel Happy 
      I Feel Happy 
      I Feel Happy 
      Nothing you can say or do 
      Is ever gonna make me feel blue 
      No, no
