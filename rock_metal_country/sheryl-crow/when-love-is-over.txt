When Love Is Over 

      I know I ask for nothing 
      And that's what I got from you tonight 
      I guess I thought you'd changed 
      Leaving becomes too easy 
      Easy by morning light 
      I still cannot explain 

      Is it enough to ask and not receive 
      Just one more kiss before you turn and leave 
      When love is over 
      Over it should be 
      But something still burns in me 

      A hundred solid reasons 
      The answers come in waves 
      But I'm all for calmer seas 
      You're only lost in the shuffle 
      But in your usual way 
      It's you who always comes to me 

      I've burned up pages 
      Hidden yesterdays 
      Here's one more glance before I turn away 
      When love is over 
      Over it should stay 
      But something won't go away 

      Hardly a moment passes 
      Hardly a single day goes by 
      I'm not remembering 
      Just to surrender slowly 
      Into a stranger's arms 
      But you stand watching in the wings 

      These must be days we've seen through tear-filled eyes 
      It all makes painful sense when I realize 
      When love is over 
      Something has to die 
      Cause you can say goodbye
