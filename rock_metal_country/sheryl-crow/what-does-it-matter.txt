What Does It Matter 

      Baby, why do they say the things they say 
      Would it be easier to live the way they say we should 
      Maybe, cannot but wonder back this way 
      Yours are the only arms that make me feel like something can be good 

      I believe it's just a fact of life 
      Unless they wear our shoes to them it's black and white 

      Ooohhhh 

      Just what does it matter anyway 
      What side of the road we're standing on 
      And just what does it matter anyway 
      If in the long run nothing changes after we are gone 
      If nothing changes after we are gone 

      Baby, don't let them rob you of your pride 
      There's not a thing I wouldn't do to make this easier for you 
      Maybe, every now and then I laugh and cry 
      It's getting harder now for me to separate the two 

      Where does innocence turn in to make believe 
      Cause make believe there's no one here but me and you 

      Ohhh 

      Just what does it matter anyway 
      What side of the road we're standing on 
      And just what does it matter anyway 
      If you throw my love away because the world don't think it's right 
      And they may never understand 
      And you can't change the minds of those who are blind 
      Unless you give them sight 
      And the world lies in your hand 

      Tell me, and just what does it matter anyway 
      If in the long run nothing changes after we are gone 
      If nothing changes after we are gone
