Daddy's in the hallway
Hanging pictures on the wall
Mama's in the kitchen
Making casseroles for all
My brother came home yesterday
From somewhere far away
He doesn't look like I remember
He just stares off into space
He must've seen some ugly things
He just can't seem to say

God bless this mess
God bless this mess

Got a job in town
Selling insurance on the phone
With Robert and Teresa
And two con men from back home
Everyone I call up doesn't have the time to chat
Everybody is so busy doing this and doing that
Something has gone missing 

And it makes me kinda sad, oh

God bless this mess 
God bless this mess
God bless this mess

Heard about the day 
that two skyscrapers came down
Firemen, policemen
And people came from all around
The smoke covered the city 
And the body count arise
The president spoke words of comfort
With tears in his eyes
Then he led us as a nation 
Into a war all based on lies, oh

God bless this mess
God bless this mess
God bless this mess
God bless this mess
