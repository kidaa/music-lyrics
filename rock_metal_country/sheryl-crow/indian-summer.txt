Indian Summer 

      The voices hanging in the air 
      The fingers running through my hair 
      You whisper in my ear, words I'm afraid to hear 

      You're sleeping on the wings of doves 
      Of melting in the heat of love 
      A voice that disappears, into the air 

      You said you found me, and never let me go, and until you do 
      No arms around me, to pull me away, away from you 

      Indian summer, I remember you 
      Indian summer, do you think of me too? 

      Like a moth to a flame, you're drawn to me with tender chains 
      You wrap me up so tight, and hold me all the night 

      Who's the stranger come and gone, statues crying in the lawn 
      The fountain's frozen tears, bring back those years 

      Did you think you loved me, and do you want me now like you did back then 
      No moon above me, could make me feel this way, feel this way again 

      Indian summer, I remember you 
      Indian summer, do you think of me too? 

      Where do the seasons go when you let them slip away 
      Now the winds have changed from hot to cold today 
      Indian summer, Indian summer, I remember you, where are you now 

      Ohhh, Indian summer, I remember you 
      Indian summer, do you think of me, do you think of me too 
      Cause I remember you, Indian summer
