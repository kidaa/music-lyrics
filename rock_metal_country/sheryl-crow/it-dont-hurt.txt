It don't hurt like it did
I can sing my song again
It don't hurt like it did
I can sing my song again.

I scraped the paper off the wall
I put down carpet in the hall
I left no trace of you at all
And I can sing my song again

I don't dream 'cuz I don't sleep
The moon is hanging like your hat
The sun comes up
Well I don't see
Curtains tied up like a bat

The electric man looks good today
Maybe not, well I'm trying hard
Trying hard to feel that way
The electric man's a good place to start

Took your paintings off the wall
That one of me that you called doll
I added on 'cuz the house was feeling small
Now I can sing my song again

I don't think of you no more
Except for everyday or two
I don't think of you no more
Except for in between the sun and moon

Packed up and moved out after all
Bulldozed the house and watched it fall
That blessed sight I still recall
I can sing my song again
I can sing my song again

It don't hurt like it did
It hurts worse
Who do I kid
