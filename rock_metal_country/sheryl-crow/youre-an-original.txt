Give us what you got
Girl you got a lot
Seems you got an itch that's scratching
Lay it like it plays
Play it like it lays
All your Easter eggs are hatching
In your Cadillac
Reaching for your jack
There's nothing we can tell you
Just a little queen
Dirty mouth and mean
There's nothing we can sell you o 

[CHORUS:]
You're an original, baby Like we've never seen before
You're an original, baby
Turn around and you're looking at a hundred more o Deadly in the sack
Grooving to The Clash
On some kind of wasted weekend
Pretty little girl
Expensive little world
Curiosity is peeking
Here today and gone by morning
Your ice cream cone is melting fast
Maybe Monday, maybe someday
Your lucky star won't fly on past 

[CHORUS]

Turn around and you're looking at a hundred more
Turn around and you're looking at a hundred more
Turn around and you're looking at a hundred more
Caught you in a pose
That everybody knows
We thought you had something special 

[CHORUS]
