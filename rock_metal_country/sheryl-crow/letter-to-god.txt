I woke up late
Put my sweater on
And I walked down to the shop
I stood in line
'Til the line was gone
And my turn to win was lost

What do you do
When you look to the left and to the right
And find no clue?

Well I'm sending a letter to God
How will it be when I'm gone?
And what if everyone is wrong?

I took you in
Made a bed for you
And in turn you gave me some
Words to go on
Told me I was saved
But you never said what from

What do you do
When you look to the left and to the right
And find no clues
To the questions you ask yourself at night?
Who will come through?

You'll be sending a letter to God
How will it be when you're gone?
And what if everyone is wrong?

A solid case
For the innocent
Could be made and laid to rest
They say, "it won't do
If you aren't like us
Then you've failed the final test"

What do you feel
When you look to the east and to the west
If this is real
Does it feel like some never ending test?
A finance deal
If this is my one last chance to invest
I've one request

I'll be sending a letter to God
To know where will I go when I'm gone
And what if everyone is wrong?
