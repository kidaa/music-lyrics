Hundreds Of Tears 

      I stood in the warmth of night 
      Chilled to the bone 
      Hundreds of faces in sight 
      Still I'm alone 
      Door after door 
      Room after empty room 
      I've stood here before 
      But under a different moon 

      In the longest days, in the darkest night 
      Down the longest road, there's a presence of light 
      But I hear a voice that calls me 
      It's love's name I'll call in the end 

      I've walk in and out of the fire 
      Between truth and lies 
      Now how many children watch 
      While one child cries 
      Tear down these walls 
      And watch while our souls are freed 
      I've thrown away pride 
      To drown in this endless sea 

      Hundreds of tears on the water 
      Mercy come rain down on me
