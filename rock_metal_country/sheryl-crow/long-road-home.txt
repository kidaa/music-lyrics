Teach me the golden rule
Make me a lovesick fool
In the light of day
Let sorrow drift away
Crown of thorns has many jewels

Songs of glory sung in hate
Only destroy what love has made
And if the Kingdom comes
Don't wanna be the one
That is standing in the way

Sure as the wind blows
Sure as the rivers flow
We will meet again
On the long road home

They say they've seen His face
They say He's called their name
I have heard their lies
Heard the peoples cries
Time has come, it's gettin' late

All the stories I have heard
Enlightened ones who walked the earth
They bring me sweet relief
Rid me of human grief
I am free from every hurt

Sure as the wind blows
Sure as the river flows
We will meet again
On the long road home

Doesn't matter if you're right or wrong
You hear Sylvester sing a simple song
What they've been sayin' for, oh, so long
'Cause love and happiness is what's goin' on

Wind blows
Rivers flow
We will meet again
On the long road home

Sure as the wind blows
Sure as the rivers flow
We will meet again
On the long road home

Sure as the wind blows
Sure as the river flows
We will meet again
On the long road home
