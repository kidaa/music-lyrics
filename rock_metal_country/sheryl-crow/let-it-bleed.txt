Let It Bleed 
      originally by Rolling Stones 

      Well we all need someone we can lean on 
      And if you want it, well you can lean on me 

      She said, my breasts they will always be open 
      Baby, you can rest your weary head on me 
      And there will always be a space in my parking lot 
      When you need a little coke and sympathy 

      Yeah we all need someone we can dream on 
      And if you want it, well you can dream on me 

      I was dreaming of a steel guitar engagement 
      When you drink my health in scented jasmin tea 
      You knifed me in my dirty filthy basement 
      With that jaded faded junky nurse, oh what pleasant company 
      We all need someone we can feed on 
      And if you want it, well you can feed on me 
      Take my arm, take my leg 
      Oh baby don't you take my head 

      We all need someone we can bleed on 
      And if you want it baby, well you can bleed on me 
      We all need someone we can bleed on 
      And if you want it, why don't you bleed on me 

      Get it on rider, get it on rider 
      Get it on rider, you can bleed all over me 
      Well lean on rider, dream on rider 
      Feed on rider, bleed on rider
