Baby Don't Go 
      originally by Bono/Cher 

      She never had a mother 
      She hardly knew her dad 
      She's been in town for 18 years 
      And I'm the only boy she's had 

      Baby, I can't stay 
      Maybe I'll be back someday 

      Oh baby don't go 
      Pretty baby please don't go 
      I love you so, pretty baby 
      Please don't go 

      I never had no money 
      I bought at the second hand store 
      The way this old town laughs at me 
      I just can't take it no more 

      Said she can't stay 
      She's gonna be a lady someday Oh baby don't go 
      Pretty baby please don't go 
      I love you so, pretty baby 
      Please don't go 

      When she gets to the city 
      Her tears will all be dry 
      My eyes will look so pretty 
      No one's gonna know I cried 

      She's goin' away 
      And maybe she'll back someday 

      Oh baby don't go 
      Pretty baby please don't go 
      I love you so, pretty baby 
      Please don't go
