Ode To Billie Joe 
      originally by Bobbie Gentrey 

      It was the third of June 
      Another sleepy, dusty 
      I was out chopping cotton 
      And my brother was bailing hay 
      And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat 
      And Mama hollered at the back door 
      "Y'all remember to wipe your feet" 
      Then she said 
      "I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge 
      Today Billy Joe McAllister 
      Jumped off the Talahachee Bridge"
