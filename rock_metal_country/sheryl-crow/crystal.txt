Crystal

      Do you always trust your first initial feeling 
      Special knowledge holds truth 
      Bears believing 
      I turned around 
      And the water was closing all around 
      Like a glove 
      Like the love that had finally, finally found me 
      And I knew 
      In the crystalline knowledge of you 
      Drove me through the mountains 
      Through the crystal like a clear water fountain 
      Drove me like a magnet 
      To the sea 
      To the sea 
      To the sea, yeah 

      How the faces of love have changed 
      Turning the pages 
      And I have changed oh, but you 
      You remain ageless 
      I turned around 
      And the water was closing all around 
      Like a glove 
      Like the love that had finally, finally found me 
      And I knew 
      In the crystalline knowledge of you 
      Drove me through the mountains 
      Through the crystal like a clear water fountain 
      Drove me like a magnet 
      To the sea 
      To the sea 
      To the sea, yeah 
      To the sea, yeah 

      I turned around and the water was closing around me 
      I turned around and the water was closing around me
