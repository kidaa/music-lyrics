Rodeo

      There comes a son, a son of angels 
      Carrying an empty glass 
      Trying to fill it to the surface 
      Well tell your thirst love has passed 

      You carry on, carry the world 
      You must get worn with all the weight 
      I take it in but you won't no where 
      And no where's where we're headed fast 

      Oh, oh, Rodeo 
      Slow turning to and fro 
      Oh, oh, Rodeo 
      Where we land no one knows no one knows.. 

      We're not blind to what it is 
      In other words, the ignorant kind 
      Well life is short, but oh it's wide 
      It's wide enough to blow my mind 

      Well I believe in ever-after 
      Just in case what's after that 
      Don't I love you like the angels 
      And could you ever love me back? 

      Chorus 

      Strangers now we are becoming 
      Stranger now we have become 
      If any fiction every returns 
      Returned by the coolest one 

      Chorus
