Reach Around Jerk 

      Wake me up when you are over 
      Cause I don't want to hear you say 
      That you've got worries on your shoulder 
      Well, I'd love to say they'd up and go away 

      I know that you ain't cryin' 
      But that don't mean that you don't feel 
      Deep inside you might be dying 
      That may be the only thing that's ever real 

      [Chorus] 
      It's a reach around jerk in a button-down shirt 
      Talking sweet to keep all the little people happy 
      When the talk is cheap, the shit gets deep 
      Better face reality that everybody's had a bad day or two 
      They don't treat you like the way you think they should 
      So you lick your bitter wounds, turn and blame the government 
      Establishment, hide your head so no one sees you when you're down 
      Wake me up when you are over 
      Let me know how long it took 
      If you ever need my sympathy 
      Honey, here's how deep you're gonna have to look 

      I know when you get older 
      You'll learn the art of how to please 
      But right now you're just getting colder 
      And my love is gonna bring you to your knees 

      [Chorus] 

      If you need me, I am able 
      And if you need me, I'll be here 
      But when you reach across the table 
      Honey, you won't find me shedding any tears
