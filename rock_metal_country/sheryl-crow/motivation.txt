Little white girl
In a shiny black car
Hanging out with her friends
And doing black tar
Daddy pays for the wedding
With a fist full of dollars
Cost as much
As the state of Guatemala

Oh why
Even try?

Well I got a big car
And a flat screen TV
All my loser friends
And my boyfriend's family
Bring bags of food
And watch reality freakshows
Everybody's faking it
But nobody thinks so

Oh why
Even try?

Got no grease on my hands
Got no serious plans
Whole world's waiting for me
'Cause all I gotta do is get it for free

Got no reason to bitch
Ain't no parties I've missed
Got to have it that way
'Cause baby I gotMOTIVATION

Skinny young dude
In a hundred dollar tee shirt
In King James kicks
And a brand new manicure
Hotties doing pilates
With the snotties and the pleasers
Sneaking in the back door
At Coconut Teasers

Why
Even try?

Well, I dropped out of school
When I was seventeen
'Cause I didn't have time
To study my magazines
'Cause there's a lot to learn
From the privileged few
Like how to build a brand
Wearing high heeled shoes

Oh why
Even try?

Got no grease on my hands
Got no serious plans
Whole world's waiting for me
'Cause all I gotta do is get it for free

Got no reason to bitch
Ain't no parties I've missed
Got to have it that way
'Cause baby I gotMOTIVATION

I'm gonna own this town
I'm gonna own this town
I'm gonna own this town
Yeah, it's all mine

Oh why
Even try?

Got no grease on my hands
Got no serious plans
Whole world's waiting for me
'Cause all I gotta do is get it for free

Got no reason to bitch
Ain't no parties I've missed
Got to have it that way
'Cause baby I gotMOTIVATION
Got no grease on my hands
Got no serious planswhole world's waiting for me
'Cause all I gotta do is get it for free
