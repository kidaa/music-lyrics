We lay around just like gurus
In borrowed robes
And talk about nothing
Well maybe that's something
Maybe that's something

You stretch out across a long long table
Without hesitation
You say, "I'm willing and able"

[Chorus]
Maybe that's something
Maybe that's one thing more than I've seen
Maybe that's something more than nothing

You say good, I say you should, will you be there
Making miracles is hard work
Most people give up before they happen

[Chorus]

More than nothing, more than nothing

[Chorus]

More than nothing, more than nothing, more than nothing
