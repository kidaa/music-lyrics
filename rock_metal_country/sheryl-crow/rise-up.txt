We take one step 
One tiny step and we're on our way 
To where we are from where we were 
Just yesterday 

Well the sun's gonna rise 
When it's everything or nothing 
And everything seems dark 
The sun's gonna rise up with you 

You'll be allright 
I'm on your side 
And we'll make it through 
When you can't go on 
I will be strong 
Enough to carry you 

Well the sun's gonna rise 
When it's everything or nothing 
And nothing seems allright 
The sun's gonna rise up with you 

Well the sun's gonna rise 
When it's everything or nothing 
And everything seems dark 
The sun's gonna rise up with you
