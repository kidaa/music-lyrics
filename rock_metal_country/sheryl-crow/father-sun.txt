Sheryl Crow   Jay Oliver---Father Sun 

      Strange imaginations, children hide your secrets well 
      Is it not temptation, makes you kiss and makes you tell? 
      There's a traveler on the airwaves, and he's pleading for my heart 
      Light up all the candles, I'm still in the dark 

      Hurry operator, get redemption on the line 
      Pull back the curtains, I think I recognize those eyes 
      If love is so criminal, then my penance due 
      'Cause I'm still holding onto letters written straight to you 

      [Chorus] 
      Oh, won't you save me, father sun, father sun 
      I need to tell you that my life is on the run 
      And now you know that you're the only one 
      Oh, please forgive me, father sun, father sun 

      I swore I needed you in the back of my mind 
      Laid the beads upon the table, right beside the wine 
      It seems that we say forever, but forever's just a word 
      "And I will be coming back for you" is all I heard [Chorus] 
      Please don't forget me, father sun, father sun 

      I think I hear him whispering 
      "Put your hand in my hand and you won't feel a thing" 

      [Chorus] 

      Oh won't you save me, father sun, father sun 
      I need to tell you that my life is on the run 
      And now you know that you're the only one 
      Oh won't you save me, father sun, father sun 
      Oh won't you save me, father sun, father sun 

      Oh won't you save me, save me, save me 
      save me, save me, father sun
