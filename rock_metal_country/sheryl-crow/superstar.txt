Let's all go downtown
I got friends doing nothing but hanging around...well
I feel like there's something I could be missing
You know you look alright
You got cheap shoes, a Malibu, and big public fights
Well, there's no one else I would rather be kissing

Baby when you start to bleed, you look so sweet
Everybody's watching you cause everybody wants to be
Little superstar, well baby that's what you are
Little superstar, oh honey that's what you are

I got a backstage line
I call you up, been watching you for quite some time
I beat around the streets like
Bandidi looking for Camilla
I'll be satin and speed
If you and I are still alive
We'll get off these streets
Well, there was a time I would have
Hung around just to be seen
Hey man, it's a shame when you start to fade
Diamond rings and sparkily things
Won't make your shine stay

My little superstar, oh baby that's what you are
My little superstar, oh honey you break my heart
My little superstar, oh honey you know you are
My little superstar, oh honey you break my heart
