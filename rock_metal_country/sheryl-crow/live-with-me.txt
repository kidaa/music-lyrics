Live With Me 
      originally by Rolling Stones 

      I've got nasty habits, I take tea at three 
      Yes and the meat I eat for dinner must be hung up for a week 
      My best friend he shoots water rats and feeds them to his geese 
      Dontcha think there's a place for you in between the sheets 
      Come on now honey, we can build a home for three 
      Come on now honey, don't you want to live with me 

      And there's a score of hare-brained children, they are a-locked in the nursery 
      They got earphone heads, they got dirty necks, they're so twentieth century 
      Well they queue up for the bathroom round about seven thirty-five 
      But dontcha think we need a woman's touch to make it come alive 
      You'd look good pram pushing down the High Street 
      Come on now honey, don't you want to live with me 

      Oh the servants they're so helpful dear, the cook she is a whore 
      Yes the butler has a place for her behind the pantry door 
      The maid she's French, she's got no sense, she's from the Crazy Horse 
      And when she strips, the chauffeur flips, the footman's eyes get crossed 
      Dontcha think there's a place for us right across the street 
      Dontcha think there's a place for you in between the sheets
