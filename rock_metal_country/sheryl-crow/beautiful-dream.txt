We could build a house 
We could build a wall 
We could move a mountain 
And we could watch it fall 

Wouldn't it be different 
If everyone could see 
That everything is sacred 
And everyone is free 

Oh, what a beautiful dream 
Oh, what a beautiful dream 

And everyone is happy 
Dancing in the streets 
Laughing with each other 
In total harmony 

And no one's going hungry 
When every cry is heard 
We will know the meaning 
Of heaven here on earth 

Oh, what a beautiful dream 
Oh, what a beautiful dream 

Everybody's got somebody they need 
As long as we're together 
Oh, what a beautiful dream 

Just a little love 
Just a little peace 
Every boy and girl 
And every family 

See the future coming 
Leave the past behind 
Cus' what you give away 
Comes back in its own sweet time

Oh, what a beautiful dream 
Oh, what a beautiful dream 
Everybody's got somebody they need 
As long as we're together 
Oh, what a beautiful dream
