Well I can see heaven
See it over the plain
If I start running now
I think I can make it
And never look back again

Your face is all around me
Your keys are in my hand
And everywhere I go
I'll try to remember
Exactly who I am

'Cause now that you're gone
I can breathe
Now that you're gone
I am free
Free to make a mess of everything
'Cause nothing belongs to me
'Cause now that you're gone
I can breathe

We made a bed of roses
But I got pricked by the thorns
And on a long cold night
I still think I'm bleeding
But I wake up untorn

Well I am a missing person
I've lost it all but my name
And, I'm afraid some long lonely road
Will lead me back to you again

Cause now that you're gone
I can breathe
Now that you're gone
I am free
Free to make a mess of everything
'Cause nothing belongs to me
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone

'Cause now that you're gone
I can breathe
Now that you're gone
I am free
Free to make a mess of everything
'Cause nobody's watching me
Now that you're gone
I am free
Now that you're gone
I can breathe
Now that you're gone
I am free
Now that you're gone
I can breathe
