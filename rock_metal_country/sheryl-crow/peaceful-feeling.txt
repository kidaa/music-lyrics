Makin' the best of a situation
Buildin' a house on a strong foundation
Everybody wants to feel alright

When you fly off in the wrong direction
Turn it around, see your own reflection
Everybody wants to feel alright

Let's dance to the music, baby
Let's dance 'til your troubles fade away
Let's dance in the summer breeze
I wanna dance 'til my spirit's free

Give me that
Free, peaceful feeling
Give me that
Free, peaceful feeling

Every day and every night
Lookin' around you miss your own damn life
Everybody wants to feel alright

Let's dance to the music, baby
Let's dance 'til your troubles fade away
Let's dance in the summer breeze
I wanna dance 'til my spirit's free

Free, peaceful feeling
Give me that
Free, peaceful feeling
Give me that
Free, peaceful feeling

I can see peace in the city
I can see peace in the nation
No matter who is leading
There will be peace and salvation

Makin' the best of a situation
Buildin' a house on a strong foundation
Everybody wants to feel alright
