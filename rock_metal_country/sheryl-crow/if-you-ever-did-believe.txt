If You Ever Did Believe 
      originally by Stevie Nicks 

      You've left me now 
      And it's seasoned my soul 
      And with every step you take 
      I watch another part of you go 

      I continue to build a wall 
      You were so strong 
      I fell to my knees 
      And I don't think I can handle this at all 

      Well one more night 
      I'd like to lie and hold you 
      Yes and feel 
      To make you smile 
      I'd like to be there for you 
      Have you forgotten me? 

      And the days go by 
      Doing nothing about them 
      How much time 
      Will I have to spend? 

      My mind won't rest 
      And I don't sleep 
      Not even in my dreams 

      If you ever did believe 
      For my sake 
      If you ever did believe And the days go by 
      Doing nothing about them 
      How much time 
      Will I have to spend? 

      And the days go by 
      Doing nothing about them 
      How much time 
      Will I have to spend? 

      Well one more night 
      I'd like to lie and hold you 
      Yes and feel 
      To make you smile 
      I'd like to be there for you 
      Have you forgotten me? 

      Ooo....Ooo.....Ooo... 
      Ooo baby don't leave me 
      Ooo..Ooo...Ooo...Ooo 
      I'm down on my knees... 
      Ooo..Ooo...Ooo...Ooo 
      Begging you please... 
      Ooo...Ooo...Ooo...Ooo 
      Baby don't leave me...Did you ever believe?
