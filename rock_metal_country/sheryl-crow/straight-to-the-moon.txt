Straight To The Moon 

      You got lucky 
      Walking cross a crowded room 
      The cameras went from wide to zoom 
      And caught you in the act 
      Well now, you've got something 
      Something we could really use 
      If we could get you on the evening news 
      And spruce up the facts 

      We'd go straight to the moon 
      Planting the seeds 
      And then watching them bloom 
      But isn't it strange 
      What gets thrown up 
      Comes right back down again 

      Snuck out the back 
      With Nancy and the philistines 
      Quotes from Rolling Stone magazine 
      Dribble from her mouth 
      Oh now, please don't tell me 
      Let me have this one surprise 
      If I come back a million years from now 
      Can I keep my scalp 

      I go straight to the moon 
      Planting the seeds 
      And then watching them bloom 
      But isn't it strange 
      Once it goes out 
      It comes right back again 
      Ooh, we go straight through the moon 
      Turn on the tv and you're in the cartoons 
      Ooh, but isn't it strange 
      Once it goes out 
      It comes right back again Your co-conspirators 
      Open up the secret door 
      And now the truth is out 
      What are we gonna do about it 

      I'm not much on second hand information 
      Sycophantic recreations 
      Have been down with the smile 
      Now I rolled up my sleeves 
      And took off my good shoes 
      You can't get in and get loose 
      Without getting dirt in your eyes 

      Ooh, you go straight to the moon 
      Planting the seeds 
      And then watching them bloom 
      Ooh, isn't it strange 
      Once it goes up 
      It comes back down again 
      Ooh, it's too much too soon 
      Turn on the tv and I'm in the cartoons 
      Ooh, isn't it strange 
      What gets thrown up 
      Comes right back down again 

      Ooh 
      Ooh, straight to the moon 
      Turn on the tv and there's a cartoon 
      If it makes you happy
