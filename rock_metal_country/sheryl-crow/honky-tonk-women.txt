Honky Tonk Women 
      originally by Rolling Stones 

      I met a ginsoaked barroom queen in Memphis 
      She tried to take me upstairs for a ride 
      She had to heave me right across her shoulder 
      'Cause I just can't seem to drink you off my mind 

      It's the honky tonk women 
      Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues 

      I laid a divorcee in New York City 
      I had to put up some kind off a flight 
      The lady then she covered me with roses 
      She blew my nose and then she blew my mind It's the honky tonk women 
      Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues 

      I strolled on the boulevard bars of Paris 
      As naked as the day that I will die 
      The sellers they're so charming there in Paris 
      But they just don't seem to sail you off my mind 

      It's the honky tonk women 
      Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues
