I know it ain't easy
But its not nice for you to leave me
There's no words to describe it
Friends are ...

Diamonds they fade
Flowers they bloom
I'm telling you...
These feelings wont go away
They've been knocking me sideways
They've been knocking me ...
Whenever you're around me

These feelings wont go away
They've been knocking me sideways
I keep thinking in a moment that
Time will take them away

These feelings wont go away

These feelings wont go away

You know it ain't easy
But its not nice for you to leave me
There's no words to describe it
Friends are against this

Diamonds they fade
Flowers they bloom
I'm telling you
These feelings wont go away
They've been knocking me sideways
They've been knocking me out there
Whenever you come around me

These feelings wont go away
They've been knocking me sideways
I keep thinking in a moment that
Time will take them away

These feelings wont go away

These feelings wont go away

But diamonds they fade
Flowers they bloom
I'm telling you
I'm telling you
Diamonds they fade
The flowers they bloom
I'm telling you
I'm telling you

These feelings wont go away
They've been knocking me sideways
They've been knocking me out there
Whenever you come around me

These feelings wont go away
They've been knocking me sideways
I keep thinking in a moment that
Time will take them away

These feelings wont go away
They've been knocking me sideways
I keep thinking in a moment that
Time will take them away

These feelings wont go away

These feelings wont go away

These feelings wont go away
