There is a star that shines tonight, for all the world to see 
So far away my lover is, please bring him home to me 
The world is weary and unrest, to settle on us all 
Tonight my Christmas wish will be, for all to heath the call 

Peace on earth and in our hearts 
That love ring out ring near and far 
And lift the weary and the weak 
Keep you near this Christmas Eve 
There is a star that shines tonight 

Once the angle did appear, to say be not afraid 
But the angles watching over you, is the prayer that I will pray 
And as we gather around the tree, and sing those Christmas songs 
Will hear your voice above the fray, until your safely home 

Peace on earth and in our hearts 
That love ring out ring near and far 
And lift the weary and the weak 
Keep you near this Christmas Eve 
There is a star that shines for you and me 

And while we wait for freedoms bells, to ring throughout the world 
The Christmas wish remains the same, of every boy and girl 
That when that glorious sun does rise, and melt away their fears 
That you'll be home this time to stay, and waiting by the tree 

Peace on earth and in our hearts 
That love ring out ring near and far 
Oh lift the weary and the weak 
Keep you near this Christmas Eve 
There is a star oh there is a star that shines for you and me
