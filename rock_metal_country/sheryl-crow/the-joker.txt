The Joker 
      originally by Steve Miller Band 

      Some people call me the space cowboy 
      Some call me the gangster of love 
      Some people call me Maurice 
      Cause I speak with the prophecies of love 

      People talk about me baby 
      Say I'm doing you wrong, doing you wrong 
      Don't you worry baby don't worry 
      Cause I'm right here, right here, right here, right here at home 

      Cos I'm a pitcher, I'm a grinner 
      I'm a lover and I'm a sinner 
      I play my music in the sun 
      I'm a joker, I'm a smoker 
      I'm a midnight talker 
      I get my loving on the run Your the cutest thing that I ever did see 
      Really like your peaches, wanna shake your tree 
      Lovy dovy, lovy dovy, lovy dovy all the time 
      O wee baby I wanna show you a good time 

      Cos I'm a pitcher, I'm a grinner 
      I'm a lover and I'm a sinner 
      I play my music in the sun 
      I'm a joker, I'm a smoker 
      I'm a midnight talker 
      I get my loving on the run
