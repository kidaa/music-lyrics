The Last Time 

      She walks the wire 
      Start to ending 
      But the wheeze is someone else inside her head 
      She swallowed fire 
      While pretending 
      That the flame has long been dead 
      And now love is just a stranger in her bed 

      She said this is the last time 
      I won't be back 
      I'll take a cab home 
      Before the second act 
      This is the last time 
      I'll turn that page 
      No more tomorrows 
      I'm full of empty yesterdays 

      Now cousin Sydney's such an outcast 
      Cause his parents ??????? 
      An angry young man is on the warpath 
      There's so many things he'd change 
      If only he'd been better bet-all tell-all Hank 

      He said this is the last time 
      I won't be back 
      I'll take a cab home early 
      Before the second act 
      This is the last time 
      I'll change my ways 
      No more tomorrows 
      And the things I'd wished I'd always changed 

      In a shiny perfect world 
      Dashing boy gets girl 
      Are you one of the lonely ones 
      Seems I can't remember when 
      Or just how long it's been 
      Since I've been waiting for that train that never comes 

      And we said this is the last time 
      I won't be back 
      I'll take a cab home early 
      Before the second act 
      This is the last time 
      I'll turn that page 
      I left the opening rather early 
      Before they left the stage 
      This is the last time 
      I change my ways 
      No more tomorrows 
      I'm full of empty yesterdays
