Is It Like Today 

      Many years ago he looked out through a glassless window 
      All that he could see was Babylon 
      Beautiful green fields and dreams and he learned to measure the stars 
      But there was a worry in his heart 

      He said "how could it come to this ?

      How could it come to this?

      I'm really worried about my creation 
      How could it come to this ? 
      You're really killing me you know" 

      Is it like today ? Oh, ooh 
      Is it like today? Oh, ooh 

      Many years ago man looked out through a glassless window 
      Didn't know much, not much, but he saw
