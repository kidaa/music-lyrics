Is this just a dream?
Don't wanna change a thing about you
And all my lonely days
Seem so far away without you

You say you're so happy now
And you say the love you've found is easy
But every now and then
Can't help but wonder when you're leaving

Don't you know that I need you?
I only want to please you
Don't know why you keep holding back
Baby, don't you know that

While you're hesitating
Baby, our love is fading
Still you keep me hanging on

While you wait for the right time
Every day turns to nighttime
Until one day love is gone

I called you on the phone
Seems like you're never home but I know
It's not that you don't care
I think it's that you're scared to let go

Don't have to tell me twice
I've made the sacrifice to hold on
I could be out instead
You're playing with my head and that's wrong

Don't you know that I love you?
And there ain't no one above you
Don't know why you keep holding back
Baby, don't you know that

While you're hesitating
Baby, our love is fading
But you keep me hanging on
You keep me hanging
You keep me hanging

While you wait for the right time
Every day turns to nighttime
Until one day love is gone
You keep me hanging
You keep me hanging

While you're hesitating
Baby, our love is fading
But you keep me hanging on
You keep me hanging
You keep me hanging

I can't tell you why
Something deep inside has died
I could try and try
But I can't bring it back to life

Someday when you're older
And you search the world over
You might wish you could hold someone
Baby, when you look for me
I'll be a memory

And while you're hesitating
Baby, our love is fading
But you keep me hanging on
You keep me hanging
You keep me hanging

Oh, while you wait for the right time
Everyday turns into nighttime
You just keep me hanging on
You keep me hanging
You keep me hanging

While you're hesitating
Baby, our love is fading
You just keep me
You just keep me hanging on
You keep me hanging
You keep me hanging

While you wait for the right time
Everyday turns to nighttime
Until one day love is gone
You keep me hanging
You keep me hanging

While you're hesitating
Baby, our love is fading
You keep me hanging on

You keep me hanging
You keep me hanging
Our love is gone

You keep me hanging
You keep me hanging
Our love is gone

You keep me hanging
You keep me hanging
Our love is gone

You keep me hanging
You keep me hanging
Our love is gone

You keep me hanging
You keep me hanging
