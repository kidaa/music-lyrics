I should be half a mile from here 

I will go anywhere she goes 
Shoulder the bags of a previous lover 
I will go anywhere she goes 
Sleep on the pillow that reeks of another 

A will of mine to be impressive 
I'm an amorous man 

I will go anywhere she goes 
Travel whenever, whatever the distance 

The court deemed me to be offensive 
I'm an ominous man 

Once love is unanimous 
No order demands 

I should be half a mile from here 

The court deemed me to be obsessive 
I'm the ominous man 
Jury reject the alibi's seemingly watertight 
For the ominous man 

I am the ominous man
