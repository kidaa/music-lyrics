If you want beautiful, pitiful, have me in a picture 
And if you want make me dance, throw me round spin upon your finger 

Blind labors the blind and I am unwilling to uncover my eyes 

And if you want take your time rifle through, find a very nice one 
If there's a crease in my face over time, there's plenty more where that came from 

Words, frozen, will thaw when I am wasted, I am better shut up 
And a frame is quite confining, hang me up...hang me up 

I'm in the photograph 

When I'm alone and the world is a fist, I am weightless 
A universe, gravitate, orchestrate, I am fearless 
And spin, the sky surrounding free from all the picture perfect 
And spin the sky surrounding, larger than life, meanwhile
