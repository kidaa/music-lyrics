She knew my feelings were jangled and frayed
She took me into a wind blown alley way
She showed me a world a boy should see
I'll thank her 'till the day that I die

So, here we go
No knock on my door
Believe it 'till you see
what living has done to me
And I'm sure that I need holding

I took her to a room and I showed her myself
She made me feel proud that I would stand for
There's nothing that this girl wouldn't do for me
For that I've got to thank her and I mean it

So, here we go
A face in the crowd,
Jump up and jump down
Baby, can you see through me

Sure, I've been here before
No knock on my door
No love in the
Baby, please be my

Sure, I've seen it before
No knock on my door
Love in the 
Can be painful, I know

Cry, I cry every night
I need to hold you tight
Oh, can you see me
knocking down your door

Sure, there's times I have hoped
There's times I have dreamed
Oh, but it seems that much to me to me, my love
I never seemed to it out, my love

I'm shakin'
Yeah, I'm shakin'

She knew my feelings were jangled and frayed
She took me into a wind blown alley way
She showed me what a boy should see
I'll thank her till the day I die
So, here we go
No knock on my door
Believe it till you see what livin' has done to me
And I'm sure I need some company
I took her to a room and I showed her myself
She made me feel proud and I was thankful
There's nothing that this girl wouldn't do for me
For that I've got to thank her I mean it

So, here we go
A face in the crowd
Jump up and jump down baby
You can see through me

No knock on my door
Love in the jar has been painful

Sure there's times that I've gone and times I have dreamed
Oh, but it seems that I pushed you in my life
Can't seem to get it out my life
