Thirteen miles on 31 are drying 
All along adopt-a-highway lay the empty cans of masquerade 

Thirteen miles on 31 are drying 
The sky is lavender with ivory clouds that threaten drops of finger-paints 
Puddle jumping children clad in yellow raincoats splash the deeper purple of veneer 

Rows and rows of animals, their shiver skin is painted different shades 
And from grazing painted grass their teeth are stained the incandescent green 
Indifferent they watch the rainfall steady blend their spots and run their stripes of veneer 

Lovely ladies strip themselves of furs the winds require 
Lovely ladies bathe themselves in technicolor mire 
Lovely gentlemen 

At 85 on 31 I'm flying 
Flying
