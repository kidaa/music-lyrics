She's signing autographs for hours the line is longer when you deal with amateurs 
I've got some autographs of others but a shirt that smells a little like her 

Once the bane of my perversion 
Now she's on the television 

Turn it up turn it down 
Tune me in tune me out 

Bite my lip around the family they know her holiday and summer weekend face 
She's got a lovely shitcom family adopted one of every single race 

Put yourself in my position 
My Ex  is on the television 

Turn it up... 

When you place your lips upon the screen spark of which you've never seen 
A volume knob controls the scream 

Turn it up...
