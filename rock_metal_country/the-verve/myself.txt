You never seen nobody as divine as 
She can see reflections in her own eyes 
An admission of desire, on a handsome afternoon 
Is an ovation to her ego 
In her everyone is everything and everything is mine 

Ms. Marceau 
You don't need another, you'll always be your own hero 
Myself Ms. Marceau 
You don't need another, you'll always be your own hero 

As if we're speaking in another language 
Every word means I, me, mine every hello every good 
No escape to the life of the average 
It's an ovation to my ego 
In her everyone is everything and everything is mine 

We're very fortunate to have her here 
Accounts are empty and my friends deserted long ago but 
She say that I'm okay, so I'm okay
