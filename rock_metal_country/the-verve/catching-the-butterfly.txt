I'm gonna keep catching that butterfly 
In that dream of mine 
I'm gonna keep catching that butterfly 
In that dream of mine 

In my lucid dreams
In my lucid dreams

Something now
Through life no fun
I want to feel
I want to run

I'm gonna keep catching that butterfly
In that dream of mine
I'm gonna keep catching that butterfly
In that dream of mine

In my lucid dreams
In my lucid dreams

I'm gonna keep catching that butterfly
In that dream of mine
Keep catching that butterfly
In that dream of mine
I'm gonna keep catching that butterfly
In that dream of mine
I'm gonna keep catching that butterfly

In my private dreams
In my private dreams
In my private dreams
My lucid dreams
My forgotten schemes
I see through you
You see through me
I see through you 
You see through me
Be with me
Be with me
I see through you
You see through me
I see through you 
You see through me

To be in your eyes
To be in your eyes
