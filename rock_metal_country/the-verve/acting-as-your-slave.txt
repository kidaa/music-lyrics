My hand asleep for hours 
Waiting for the needles to begin 
I have no control 
They proceed to penetrate my skin 

Acting as your slave I drink for amber waves 
I never have embraced 
Acting as your slave I drink an open grave 
An epitaph defaced 

Killing with compassion 
She hasn't heard a word that I have said 
Swallowing your passion 
I can see a thousand miles ahead 

Acting as your slave I drink for barricades 
That I have often raised 
Acting as your slave I numb my head and rave 
Of epitaphs defaced 

Acting as your slave I drink while she forgave 
With trials left unfaced 
Acting as your slave I stumble to her grave 
An epitaph defaced
