It's different now 
I feel that all those looks were just a game 
You smoked and choked on cigarettes 
And acted cute and lame-and lame 

Your parting lips that wrapped me up 
In promised company 
Now mumble that each breath I take 
Takes from the air you breathe-and breathe 

You were to share these dreams 
But from this bed it's different than it seems 
You'll have to drag me everywhere you go 
And you're not martyr material 

You fell in love, you fell so hard 
You said it must be days 
I said that I am not quite ready 
For your newest phase-your face 

Conceding, lying, cheating 
Deceiving relentlessly 
My voice got softer 
You could no longer hear me-hear me 

That ring you wear in fashion 
Has a chain that pierces through my nose 
You'll have to drag me everywhere you go 
And you're not martyr material 

My life is riding in this chair of wheels 
With arms that move too slow 
You'll have to drag me everywhere you go 
And you're not martyr material
