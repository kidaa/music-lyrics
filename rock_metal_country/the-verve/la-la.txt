With everyone around us singing la la we slid out of their view 
Then you thought you heard me singing la la but I don't have the strength to 

And from the moment that I give out we begin to live out 
Scenes from all romantic prose while tethered to the roles 
Or what was meant disguised as sentiment could hang 
Misunderstood and left unanswered 

Your eyes tell me I have what I wanted haunted as I hold you 
Nervous slacking with the lacking heartache no heartbreak when I told you 

And though I never did surrender could you please remember 
If and when we meet again we once were more than friends 
Embarrassed me but would you share a scene and kiss me 
One last time before I leave you 

And though I won't surrender I want you to remember 
If and when we meet again we'll still be more than friends 
Grant me this it could seem frivolous, but kiss me 
One last time before I leave you 

You've got all my loving in a tangle that I could never undo 
And you will never hear me singing la la 
I guess la la means I love you
