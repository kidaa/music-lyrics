You've been fighting for much to long
You saw the future and what to come
Restless spirits out on the run,
among the shadows of the sun
You are the rising resistance now
We've come to show you a way somehow
Beyond the past and in secrecy,
we found it all, but we want more
We come from the age of chivalry
Metal machines, unchained and free
We are hear for you to see
Flying on wings of steel, thundering, we are
breaking the seal
Fighting for the oath we sworn, to spread the
word of a Legend Reborn
Moving silent like a gentle breeze
We?re the troops of metal and we do as we
please
We are the restless, we are the wild,
burning hearts that never die
We are going against the tide
The hammer has fallen, a thorn in your side
Break the silence or take the fall
The mighty Templars will take it all
Welcome the age of chivalry,
were we all will be set free
It's the time for you and me
Flying on wings of steel, thundering, we are
breaking the seal
Fighting for the oath we sworn, to spread the
word of a Legend Reborn
Sons and brothers fight or fall
With our sisters and daughters
We're standing one for all
Flying on wings of steel, thundering, we are
breaking the seal
Fighting for the oath we sworn, to spread the
word of a Legend Reborn
Flying on wings of steel, thundering, we are
breaking the seal
Fighting for the oath we sworn, to spread the
word of a Legend Reborn
