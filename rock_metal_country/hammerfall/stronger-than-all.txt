Always standing proud, we know our time has come
marching off to war, the crusade has just begun
Fighting for the right to live under the sun
we won't stop 'til they've lost and we've won
Come and fly with us, together as one we belong
This magic of metal unites us, it's making us strong
Like an arrow we strike  STRONGER THAN ALL
heavy metal troops on the rise
Like an arrow of might  STRONGER THAN ALL
We'll walk through fire, we're true to ourselves and our lives
History commits the oath to deal in steel
Warriors of the Faith, to no living soul we kneel
Born into the fold, the Templars are for real
no one will ever bring us to heel
Come and fly with us, together as one we belong
this magic of metal unites us, it's making us strong
Like an arrow we strike - STRONGER THAN ALL
shooting through the air at full speed
Like an arrow of might - STRONGER THAN ALL
in the name of metal, defending our hopes and beliefs
The past and the present unites in us all,
we stand up for our beliefs
The way of the Templars is here once again,
forever they will be free
Like an arrow we strike - STRONGER THAN ALL
heavy metal troops on the rise
Like an arrow of might - STRONGER THAN ALL
We'll walk through fire, we're true to ourselves
Like an arrow we strike - STRONGER THAN ALL
shooting through the air at full speed
Like an arrow of might - STRONGER THAN ALL
in the name of metal, defending our hopes and beliefs
