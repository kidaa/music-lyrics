You made me see right past myself, well beyond
my fears, realized I'm synchronized, far beyond my years
I'm so geard unto them, I serve unto their souls
now that I'm addicted, my hunger only grows

I'm a child of the damned, I follow where I go
rigging to the cross, as holy as a whore
I'm just a child of the damned

Witches coven, the time has come for those sabbatical
years, revelation is the message, for all in all to hear
Prophets slayed, mankind arrayed into mass submission
evil's here, the lord of hell gives you the proposition

I'm a child of the damned, I follow where I go
rigging to the cross, as holy as a whore
I'm just a child of the damned

Give away your life goals, your meaning and ambition
it means nothing to you, after all it's superstition
Do not be afraid, the world is near the end
is it better to rule in hell, than it is to serve in heaven?

I'm a child of the damned, I follow where I go
rigging to the cross, as holy as a whore
I'm just a child of the damned
