Gaze upon the stake,
flames will soon start to embrace
Condemned, auto da f,
she?s about to fall from grace
In the land of the rising sun
shadows are falling again
The die is cast, the future and past
coming to her at last
Oh, oh, oh
All she needed was a Champion
Oh, oh, oh
Crying for a saviour to fight for her life
Behold, the freedom cries
by the dying of the light
Too late to justify
for vindication upon this night
In the land of the rising sun
shadows are falling again
From out of nowhere, a rider declared
to answer her final prayer
Oh, oh, oh
He stood up to be the Champion
Oh, oh, oh
He became the saviour that fought for her life
Face to face, eye to eye
The saviour fought to save her pride
Far beyond the starlit skies, the encounter went on
Gaze upon the stake,
as the flames start to embrace
A life, an act of faith,
long-lost gone without a trace
In the land of the rising sun
Shadows are falling again
The die is cast for the future and past
came for her at last
Oh, oh, oh
All she needed was a Champion
Oh, oh, oh
Crying for a saviour to fight for her
Oh, oh, oh
He stood up to be the Champion
Oh, oh, oh
He became the saviour that fought for her life
