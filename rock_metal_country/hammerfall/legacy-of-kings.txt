Out in the fields
the full moon is rising
Enlightens the name on our shields
blessed with pride
Steel on our side
we're horsemen of thunder
The ground starts to shake as we ride
side by side
Stormbringer led us into the unknown
On wings of glory we will carry on
Legacy Of Kings  LEGACY OF KINGS
forever to surrvive, we're
Riding on the winds  riding on the winds
unchained and free, alive forevermore
Deep in the night
we circle around them
The honor compels us to fight
all for one
All hewed with steel
in the toil of the battle
Our enemies fate will reveal
and be sealed
The chill of the wind keeps on calling our names
there's no turning back now, keep hold of the flame
Legacy Of Kings  LEGACY OF KINGS
forever to surrvive, we're
Riding on the winds  riding on the winds
unchained and free, alive forevermore
Now we are here
and there is nothing left to fear
The secrets of steel
the path of glory will reveal
Legacy Of Kings  LEGACY OF KINGS
forever to surrvive, we're
Riding on the winds  riding on the winds
unchained and free, alive forevermore
