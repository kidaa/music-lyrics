Undying nightfall, a king with no crown
dethroned, imprisoned in chains
Duel the black horse, the Swordsmen must kneel
condemned to serve within the shadows
Put'em next to their King
Out of the fire and into the night
a handful of brave men appeared
Crimson thunder running through their veins
a bond that will last forever
Nothing's stronger than ...
Brothers in arms are fighting tonight
the Forces of steel meet again
born in the fire, they look to the sky
power of metal unchained
Time has come, break out of these chains
FIGHT! proud for your kingdom
Behind the defenders the king marches on
by divine intervention
They are fighting with ...
Brothers in arms are fighting tonight
the Forces of Steel live again
born in the fire, they look to the sky
the power of metal unchained
Past many nights they fought on
and by the moonlight the battle was won
but still the black horse is running
knowing were the power will lead
Brothers in arms are fighting tonight
the Forces of Steel live again
born in the fire, they look to the sky
the power of metal unchained
