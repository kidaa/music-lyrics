Grey morning, dawn won the fight
Daylight drives away the night
Fog's rising out in the fields
The birth of winter is in sight
Dark shadows fall from the sky
They alight on gallows tree
black feathers, amber beaks
waiting for their deity
Leaves are spinning 'round
Lost and never found
When the king takes the crown
Can you feel
The autumn wind blowing
Ravenlord is coming to stay
Can you hear
The passing bell tolling
Ravenlord - takes you far away
Sharp talons, pinions of ice
The obscure the new-born day
Hot breathing freezes to snow
piercing caws lead you astray
Leaves are spinning 'round
Lost and never found
When the king takes the crown
Can you feel
The autumn wind blowing
Ravenlord is coming to stay
Can you hear
The passing bell tolling
Ravenlord - 
Takes you far away
