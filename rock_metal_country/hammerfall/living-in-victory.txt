Do you remember how we used to say
Everything around us are made of clay
We were the Kings and the others the fools,
playing by our rules
Adorned with golden shapes and silver dreams
You count the seconds, every moment seems
like your lost to the stars up above
Eventhou you're falling
Spoken words made of trust, burning bridges
between us,
turning diamonds into rust
You're running out of time, the higher that you climb
the deeper you will fall and lose sight of it all
Out of time, on the line
Living In Victory
You spread your words, I say devoid of truth
What's left is fantasy of endless youth
You made a promise, a little white lie
Now you're falling from the sky
Chasing dragons by the moon, burning bridges around you,
your deepest fears begin to loom
You're running out of time, the higher that you climb
the deeper you will fall and lose sight of it all
Out of time, on the line
Living In Victory
Is it someone that hears you, is it somebody there
All you know and all you will get, lie so deep
down inside
Dreams of fortune in the dust, when all your
bridges are burnt, turning being into lust
You're running out of time, the higher that you climb
the deeper you will fall and lose sight of it all
Out of time, on the line
Living in sin
Out of time, the higher that you climb
the deeper you will fall and lose sight of it all
Out of time, on the line
Living In Victory
Living In Victory
