We saw the writings on the wall
When heathens ruled above us all 
Tormented, we still heard the call

You come to bring us down
Wield the scepter, steal the crown 
Time on the throne is running out

'Cause seasons change but we are still the same 
Event though the cold winds blow we're burning like a
flame '

Hearts On Fire, Hearts On Fire 
Burning, burning with desire 
Hearts On Fire, Hearts On Fire 
Burning, burning with desire 
Hearts On Fire, Hearts On Fire 
Burning, burning with desire 
Burning for the steel 

Hearts On Fire 

For years shunned by society 
Outcasts, condemned for our beliefs 
Our legions grew in secrecy 

And now, the time is here 
I see the Templars everywhere 
The Freedom Call is drawing near 

We hold our rebel banners up with pride 
The colour's crimson and the Hammer is the sign 

Hearts On Fire, Hearts On Fire 
Burning, burning with desire 
Hearts On Fire, Hearts On Fire 
Burning, burning with desire 
Hearts On Fire, Hearts On Fire 
Burning, burning with desire 
Burning for the steel 

Hearts On Fire, Hearts On Fire... 

Hearts On Fire, Hearts On Fire 
Burning, burning with desire... 

Hearts On Fire
