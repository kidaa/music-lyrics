Standing at the
crossroads, were the future meets the past
Oh can?t you feel, there?s magic in the air
We?re noble knights and mighty men, with the
power to assay
Faithful and true, let our deeds show you the
way
Glorious, we live and we die
Our courage will unite
In our hands we hold the future, carry on
In our hearts, eternally, we Keep The Flame
Burning
Hear the sound of roaring thunder, and the
sound of raging steel
In the battle of thrust our sprits will reveal
Glorious, we?d rather die
with honour than to live with shame
In our hands we hold the future, carry on
In our hearts, eternally, we keep the flame...
burning deep inside forever, shining on
And in our hearts for all eternity we Keep The
Flame Burning
We stay as we are, now the first crusade is won
Let it be written, let it be done
In our hands we hold the future, carry on
In our hearts, eternally, we keep the flame...
burning deep inside forever, shining on
And in our hearts for all eternity we Keep The
Flame Burning
