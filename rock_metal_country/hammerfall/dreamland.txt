See the light of those who find
As time passes you by, you're still left behind
Time has come for you to see
That life is a game you'd rather play or flee
The ivory gates cast shadows, might betray
Surrender this night, or choose my way
Come with me, I'll take you there - to the land of make believe
Let us fly beyond our dreams, fall into reverie
On the wings of destiny, I will claim our liberty
With the power of the steel
With the power of the steel
With the power of the steel, Dreamland will reveal

All you see is black or white
You have to spell out, what is wrong or right
Spoken words may let you down, it's time to set up, rise with the sun
You enter the gates and there's nothing left to fear
but don't let it matters stand, you are near

Come with me, I'll take you there - to the land of make believe
Let us fly beyond our dreams, fall into reverie
On the wings of destiny, I will claim our liberty
With the power of the steel
With the power of the steel
With the power of the steel, Dreamland will reveal

Let me know, if wanna go, there is a place for you and me
Let me take you to the temple of the heart, let me know

Come with me, I'll take you there - to the land of make believe
Let us fly beyond our dreams, fall into reverie
On the wings of destiny, I will claim our liberty
With the power of the steel
With the power of the steel
With the power of the steel, Dreamland will reveal
