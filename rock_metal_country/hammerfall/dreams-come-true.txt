Never thought I'd feel again 
Feel the darkness 
Fade and see the morning sun arise 
Never thought I'd feel alive again 
Senses dull 
And blunt from all the lies 

Now, when I hold your face 
So close to mine 
I see a place where the sun will shine 
With you it is divine 

Looking down into those eyes 
I know, I'll be lost 
And never found again 
Kiss me once and I 
Will surely melt and die 
Kiss me twice and I 
Will never leave your side... 
If Dreams Come True 

Do I dare to trust this time? 
The Bells of Fortune 
Will I ever hear them chime? 
Only those who have been burned before 
Truly know the meaning 
Of Hell's flaming core 

I was the brooding night 
And you were dawn 
Saving me, for I was forlorn 
In your light I am reborn 

Then, when the walls 
Are breaking down on us 
When all we see is misery 
Will you still believe in me?
