Our time has come, get ready fight
Sisters and brothers in metal unite
The dreams that you had are about to come true
The voice of the warrior is calling for you
Turn your own deeds to his gracious glory,
and he will make you see
This is the way we want it to be
This is The Way Of The Warrior
This is the way we want it to be
Walking the way, the honest will see
Walking The Way Of The Warrior
Walking the way, The Way Of The Warrior
Blood-red the steel of our swords shall flow
and by the allegiance we?re ready to go
Stout are the foe, in warfare so bold
Nothing can stop us, the future we hold
Brace up, defend,
never ever be outdone in bravery
This is the way we want it to be
This is The Way Of The Warrior
This is the way we want it to be
Walking the way, the honest will see
Walking The Way Of The Warrior
Walking the way, The Way Of The Warrior
The saints and the sinners in battle so bright, as
the forces of steel will unite
The way of the warrior, the call of his life, shall
lead us all into the light
The metal crusade will conquer all
Our bonds will be stronger, see the infidels fall
Surrender your soul to the Gods of steel
In the blood of the fallen the enemies kneel
Turn your own deeds to his gracious glory,
and he will make you see
Brace up, defend,
never ever be outdone in bravery
This is the way we want it to be
This is The Way Of The Warrior
This is the way we want it to be
Walking the way, the honest will see
Walking The Way Of The Warrior
Walking the way, The Way Of The Warrior
This is the way we want it
This is the way we need it
This is The Way Of The Warrior
This is the way we want it
This is the way we need it
This is The Way Of The Warrior
This is the way
