It's getting closer now
the clock strikes midnight time
It is the tolling of the judgement bell
You fear the dead of night
there ain't no place to hide
This is your point of no return
Now we are ready to strike, again
It's getting far to late, my friend
Let The Hammer Fall
We are above the law
let our power show
That we're in full control of your destiny
Now we are ready to strike, again
It's getting far to late, my friend
Let The Hammer Fall
Oh, oh, oh
We're getting closer now
the chill of distant eyes
Your on a dead end street into the night
Now we are ready to strike, again
It's getting far to late, my friend
Let The Hammer Fall
Let the Hammer Fall
