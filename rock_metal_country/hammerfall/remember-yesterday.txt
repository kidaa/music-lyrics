Can you tell me why
it seems so hard to carry on
When you hear a voice
from long ago, so bittersweet
Even though I try, I can not
read between the lines
You know I tried,
Oh, yes, I tried, what's wrong
Too late to turn back time
To look over my shoulder
Maybe one day I'll return again
Remember Yesterday
and think about tomorrow
But you have to live today
Oh, lonely yesterday
don't leave me with the sorrow
Cause I have to live today
Every morning I awake
to see the newborn day
To carry on the flame
until the end of time
Too late to turn back time
To look over my shoulder
Maybe one day I'll return again
Remember Yesterday
and think about tomorrow
But you have to live today
Oh, lonely yesterday
don't leave me with the sorrow
Cause I have to live today
Oh, oh, oh, don't you step aside
and pretend about the future
Oh, oh, oh, never live a lie
don't you know tomorrow never comes
Remember Yesterday
and think about tomorrow
But you have to live today
Oh, lonely yesterday
don't leave me with the sorrow
Cause I have to live today
Oh, oh, oh, don't you step aside
and pretend about the future
Oh, oh, oh, never live a lie
don't you know tomorrow never comes
