Give it to me, please
I said to god.
It's only fair.
Instead, he sent three angels
To move the river,
So now it flows by my house,
So now it goes by my house.
Angel
Angel
I'd still rather have the man.
I've had bad dreams,
So bad I threw my pillow away.
Move the river,
So now it flows by my house,
So now it goes by my house.
Angel
Angel
I'd still rather have the man.
