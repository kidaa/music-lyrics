Stay oh oh oh oh stay.
Stay oh oh oh oh stay.
Soloman dives for that big dusky pearl.
Soloman sighs he knows he's older than me.
Sleeps with the fishes soon.
Stay stay oh oh oh oh stay.
Stay stay oh oh oh oh stay.
Soloman crawls on the belly of God.
Soloman falls on his face in love with me.
He grows as oldas the sea deep where the fishes are.
Stay oh oh oh oh stay.
Stay oh oh oh oh stay.
stay oh oh oh oh stay.
Stay oh oh oh oh stay.
He lives in the yard.
He keeps himself hard.
He keeps himself homeless and heartless and hard.
He sleeps under stairs
Along with the heirs of nothing,
And nothing means no one who cares.
But I love him dear,
And I love him dear,
And I've loved him hundreds of thousands of years.
Stay.
Stay oh oh oh oh stay.
Stay with me.
Stay oh oh oh oh stay.
Stay with me.
It's not time for me to go.
It's not time for me to go.
It's not time for me to go.
