Where I live,
There's a blanket of gauze,
And it covers the scars of the drunks
Who are hungry as ever.
Where I live,
There's a blanket of sighs,
And it covers the stars.
In my heart,
I'm as hungry as ever.
This is the room where we met.
Where I live,
There's a lady
Who walks everywhere on her hands.
Doesn't trust where her feet want to take her.
Where I live,
There's this lady
Who walks everywhere on her hands.
She don't trust where her feet want to take hernot in here.
This is the room where we metnot in here.
This is the dress I had on.
This is not the moment that you fear
When you wake up and no one is there.
Low hangs the moon, oh oh,
Inside this room.
Low hangs the moon, oh oh,
Inside this room.
So that I'm a witness when you
Judas my heart.
Judas my heart.
Where I live there's a blanket of sighs
And it covers the stars.
In my heart,
I'm as hungry as ever.
Where I live,
I'm afraid that I walk everywhere on my hands,
I don't trust where my feet want to take menot in here.
This is the room where we metnot in here.
This is the dress I had on.
This is not the moment I fear
I say, ";I"; 'stead of ";she.";
Now you're here.
Low hangs the moon, oh oh,
Inside this room.
Low hangs the moon, oh oh,
Inside this room.
So that I'm a witness when you
Judas my heart X4
Can I get a witness when you Judas my heart again?
Can I get a witness when you do this to my heart again?
Can I get a witness when you Judas my heart again?
Where I live,
There's a lady who walks everywhere on her hands.
Just like me doesn't trust
Where her feet want to take her again
And her feet want to take her again
And her feet want to take her again.
She loves me, yeah, yeah, yeah.
She loves me, yeah, yeah, yeah.
