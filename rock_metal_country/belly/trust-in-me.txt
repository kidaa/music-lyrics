Written by Sherman and Sherman.
Hold still please.
Trust in me,
Just in me.
Close your eyes,
And trust in me.
We can sleep safe and sound,
Knowing I am around.
Slip into silent slumber.
Sail on a silver mist.
Slowly but surely,
Your senses will cease to resist.
Slip into silent slumber.
Sail on a silver mist.
Slowly but surely,
Your senses will cease to resist.
Trust in me,
Just in me.
Shut your eyes,
And trust in me.
You can sleep safe and sound,
Knowing I am around.
