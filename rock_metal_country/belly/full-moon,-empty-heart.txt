Sleep in now, now.
Sleep in now, now, now.
It's still night out.
Sleep in.
Don't look at me
Looking back at you,
Out the window backwards,
Out the window backwards.
Sleep.
See this child twice stolen from me,
Out the window backwards,
Out the window backwards.
Sleep in now, now.
Sleep in now, now, now.
Sleep now.
Now fall to the bed,
Put your hand in your hair.
Now fall to the tile,
Stick your finger in your eye.
That's the only way you cry.
Hey now.
Hey now.
Full moon pass the window sideways.
Hey now.
Hey now.
Sleep in now, now.
Sleep in now, now.
Sleep in now, now.
