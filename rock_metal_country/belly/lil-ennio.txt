I wasn't there,
But I heard there were flowers in his hair.
Though not yet born to her,
I know there was something magic about
The way she held her own.
I know it's hard for the young ones.
I know it.
Accutely, I heard it.
Race me through this heart-broken town.
Bang yur boots and keep your head down.
Race me through the heart of this broken town.
I use the voices of sandmen
To bring you home.
I know it's wrong, you're a young one.
I know it.
Accutely, I hear it.
Race me through this heart-broken town.
Bang your boots and keep your head down.
Race me through the heart of this broken town.
So now I make you pray to god.
Now I make you pray to god.
Now I make you pray like there's a god.
I know it's hard for the young ones.
I know it.
So now I make you pray to god.
Now I make you pray to god.
Now I make you pray
Like there's a god to see it my way, yeah.
See it my way, yeah.
