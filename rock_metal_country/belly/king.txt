Little bird,
I won't prey on you.
I won't prey on you this time.
I'm your faith.
I'm your faithhealer.
I'm your faithless companion.
I'm the seed that made your perfect body.
When you sleep, I am awake.
There is a light under the ocean.
Under the ocean, there's things shining everywhere.
There is a lightkeeper under the blanket here.
Under the blanket, there's things shining down here.
Now I see you lay your perfect body down by me,
Now we're down.
Little bird,
I won't prey on you.
I won't prey on you this time.
I'm your faith.
I'm your faithhealer
I'm your faithless companion.
I'm the seed that made your body perfect.
When you sleep, I am awake.
There is a light under the ocean.
Under the ocean, there's things shining everywhere.
There is a lightkeeper under the blanket here.
Under the blanket, there's things shining everywhere.
You light the ocean from behind.
I'll show you mine.
I'll show you.
Baby, I can't fake it,
I'd like to see you naked.
I'd like to see you take it.
I'd like to see you naked.
