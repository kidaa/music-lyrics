Baby's playing dead in cellar.
Gave her water just got paler.
Grass stains, backburns, she's a screamer.
She's just dusted, leave her.
If you see her, don't upset her.
Never seems to get much better.
Grass stains, backburns, she's a screamer.
She's just dusted leave her.
Mmm mmm, goes to your heart.
Mmm mmm, sticks in your head.
Mmm mmm mmm mmm, yeah.
Baby's playing dead in cellar.
Gave her water, she got paler.
Grass stains, backburns, she's a screamer.
She's just dusted, leave her.
