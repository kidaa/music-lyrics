On your third broken window,
Your hair full of glass,
Throw your clothes in the hallway,
Just a sheet on your back.
So you're super-connected now?
All the freaks gather around,
And the crowd in your bedroom waits
For a piece of your personal space.
Are there heart strings connected
To the wings you've got slapped on your back?
Better climb in the window cause I'm closing the door.
On your third broken window,
With your hair full of glass,
Saw your clothes in the hallway,
Just a curtain on your back.
I laugh.
Are there heart strings connected
To the wings you've got slapped on your back?
Better climb in the window cause I'm closing the door.
Now I'm spinning on a dime.
Now I'm spinning on a dime.
Now I'm spinning on a dime.
Like you claim to do,
Like now, like now.
Are there heart strings connected
To the poison coming out of your mouth?
Are you super-connected?
Are you super-connected now?
I'm spinning on a dime.
Throw your clothes in the hallway,
