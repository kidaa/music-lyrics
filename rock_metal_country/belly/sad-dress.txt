I'm so tipsy I can't seem to walk,
And you take me firmly by the hand in the dark,
And those cheekbones of yours shine in the dark.
I swear they do.
Think about Dixie, she ducked when she ran,
Made up three bad reasons to stand by her man.
He goes. Miss the vein once.
Try, try again.
I swear I just went.
My, my your dress says so sad,
So sad.
You don't care you just stole it somewhere.
Feel it.
Fight it.
Sleep inside it.
Your dress says so sad,
So sad.
You don't care you just stole it somewhere.
I'd chew my foot off,
I'd chew my foot off
