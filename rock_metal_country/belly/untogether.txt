Sour Me. Ouch!
I was friendly with this girl,
Who insisted on touching my face.
She told outrageous stories.
I believed them 'til the endings
Were changing from endings before.
She's not touching me anymore.
Untogether, I couldn't help her I got hard.
You can try your life.
You can't save the unsavably untogether.
I was shipwrecked with this frog,
Who was endlessly on testing my faith.
He made outrageous demands.
I ignored him
'Til I strapped on my boat feet
And surfed into shore.
He's not touching me anymore.
Untogether, I couldn't help him I got hard.
You can try your life.
You can't change the unchangably untogether.
Now the bird nest on my back
Keeps me turning and straining to see.
We threw outrageous parites.
We were golden.
Now the bird keeps it's distance,
And I keep my speech.
Sometimes there's no poison like a dream.
Untogether, I couldn't help it it got hard.
You can dry your eyes.
