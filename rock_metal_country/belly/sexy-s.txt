This thing is so hard to load,
And I can't aim I can't aim.
I can't swim,
But I can turn this into gold
On the wings of the angel who left you here.
Sadie, Sadie, you got a bonfire in your hair,
Must be heaven in there.
Sadie,Sadie, you got beach bonfire hair,
And it truns crazy red,
When I touch you there,
When I touch you there.
Let the gods turn away.
Let the gods turn away.
This wave is so hard to hold,
And I can't swim I can't swim.
I can't swim,
But I can turn this into gold.
Hit the water in slow-mo like angels in air.
Sadie, Sadie, you got a bonfire in your hair,
Must be heaven in there.
Sadie,Sadie, you got beach bonfire hair,
And it truns crazy red,
When I touch you there,
When I touch you there.
Let the gods turn away.
