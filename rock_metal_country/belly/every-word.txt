So you go to leave
More room for me.
Oooo... you gave me too much room,
So I filled it up with chairs,
You can't sit on,
But if you want to stand there,
Stand there.
Oooo... you told me too much.
You thought I would leave you.
I heard every word X3
So you go, and it all grows darker
Like these chairs,
These eyes,
This room
Closes it's windows.
These chairs,
These eyes,
This room,
This heart.
