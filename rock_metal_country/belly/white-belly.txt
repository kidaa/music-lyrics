Put on your black dress.
Float on your back.
Too long, too lame,
Now I'm gone.
Somewhere to sleep,
Somewhere to sleep,
Somewhere to scrape your body off my feet.
Put on your black dress.

White belly up in the sun.
Still diving for the big one.
Put on your black dress.
Float on your back.
Put on your black dress.

Too long, too lame,
Now i'm gone
White belly up in the sun,
