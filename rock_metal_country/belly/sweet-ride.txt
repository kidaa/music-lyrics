Climbing out,
We stumble around,
All smoky and soaked to the bone.
I carry the crown of a girl underground.
I'm down for a sweet ride.
I'm down for a sweet ride.
I'm down for a sweet ride,
So follow me down.
Once was lost now am found.
This is my dream.
Coming down,
And smiling too loud.
Smoking and soaked to the bone,
We wear my mistake like a crown.
Once was lost now am found.
I'm down for a sweet ride.
I'm down for a sweet ride.
I'm down for a sweet ride.
I'm down.
I'm down for a sweet ride.
I lost him too.
I'm down for a sweet ride.
And my vow made it new.
I'm down for a sweet ride,
I lost it too.
So follow me down.
Once was lost now am found.
Once was lost now am found.
