Some niggas aint got nothing some niggas richyou heard?
Some niggas die frontin' and some livin' this shit4 real

Verse 1:
Ayo we play for keeps, start from day one
Hot we blaze the heat, 360 ways to eat, razorblades you need
I'm gettin something, if not then im hittin' something
Definately, especially if my rims is touchin'
Out for mine, for your shines I blow you out your mind
You can throw 1000 signs, im only concerned about the dollar signs
Stackin' my cheese, stashin my crack in back of my feet
State to state, nationally, actually, factually 
I fracture every member of your faculty, send your cavalry
I got And 1's that match with me
City capture me, I have them niggas scared to act with me
Throw your man off the Tapp-an-zee
Other members of your clan runnin' where the traffic be
Hollerin' and he bustin' big guns and coming after me

Wont stop till everyone laying, on the pavement
Every nigga you came with, is gettin painted
We specialize in wet-in guys, technical lies, Smith-n-Wessunalise

Especially Test and I, put the tek to ya eye
So you can see death, take a deep breath and say goodbye

Verse 2:
Streets is too real, thugs nowadays is too ill
Fuck a hundred thou i need a few mil
Even if it means you kill
You resting in peace i rest in blue steel
Im even wet-in police and navy-blue seals
How crazy you feel?
Militant Click, ten in the whip 
I know bohemians wit plenty of chips
Pull this off and we'll be rich
Filthy as top, bill the milkiest
In the hamptons, i know the mansions where they live
They on some rims shit, hindu niggas, reading sandscript
I wanna man by every exit so they can't split
Rush the crib, all we see is candles lit
Yo they got gold cows, gold owls on some chain shit
Tied them up, red dot 'em up, fuck the ransom shit
Hit the safe, brick city case, back to the whip
Then we lace, back to Bk, all beneath, relaxed in the pj's
Splittin' mathematics on the weekday
Sound of pee traces, dust the side of breifcases
Queit money, eat by my chef like Free Masons, Pay me

Chorus repeat til fade
