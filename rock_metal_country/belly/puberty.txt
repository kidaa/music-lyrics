Covered in honey,
Showered in beer,
Now when you spin on your head like a monkey
I won't see you.
Sing a bad love song loud in my ear,
So when you spin on your head like a monkey,
I won't hear you.
I tame a bird to light where you live,
Light on your arm and bring a wild gift.
I am my mother's child.
I let my fears run wild.
Showered in honey,
Showered in beer,
Now when you spin on your head like a monkey
I won't see you.
I tame a bird to light where you live,
Light on your arm and bring a wild gift.
I send a light to shine on you.
I send a light to shine around you.
I send a light to blind you.
I am the light that shines on your eyes.
I am the light that blinds.
I tame a bird to light where you live,
Light on your arm and bring a wild gift.
I tame a bird to light where you live,
