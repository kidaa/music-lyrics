Hey bitchery,
You stole enough from me.
I gotta go.
I gotta go home now
In this misery.
You've had enough of me.
I gotta go.
I gotta go home now
Where there's easy love,
And there's easy life.
Dream on me
When you sleep.
Keep your head
Where you said it would be.
Dream on me
When you sleep.
Keep your head like you said.

Keep your head like you said,
And you said, like you said, like you said.
