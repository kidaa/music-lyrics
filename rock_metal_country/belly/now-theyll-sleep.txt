Mm mm, Mm mm, Mm mm, Mm mm, Mm mm, Mm mm, Mm mm, Oh.
Now I've lost the plot.
I'm not the hero I could be,
But not the dog I was.
Kind of common cry,
Kind of common living lie.
Color my fast fading heart.
People laugh at anything,
And things just fall apart.
Kind of common cry,
Kind of common living lie.
You know the shape my breath will take before I let it out.
Stand like you did when I was beauty-marked in your eyes.
Now they'll sleep on lies.
Now eyes burn circles in the dark,
And when the mirror talks to me,
I listen with my heart.
Kind of common cry,
Kind of common living lie.
You know the shape my breath will take before I let it out.
Stand like you did when I was beauty-marked in your eyes.
Now they'll sleep all right.
You know the shape my breath will take before I let it out.
Stand like you did when I was beauty-marked in your eyes.
Stand like you did when I was beauty-marked in your eyes.
One common cry do do do do.
One common cry do do do do.
One common cry do do do do.
One common cry do do do do oh-ooo.
