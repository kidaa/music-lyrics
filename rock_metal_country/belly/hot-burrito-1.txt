Written by Gram Parsons and Chris Ethridge.
You may be sweet and nice,
But that won't keep you warm at night
'Cause I'm the one who showed you how
To do the things you're doing now.
He may feel all your charms.
He might hold you in his arms,
But I'm the one who let you in.
I was right beside you in the end.
Once upon a time,
You let me feel you deep inside,
But nobody knew, nobody saw.
Do you remember the way we cried?
I'm your toy.
I'm your old boy,
But I don't want no one
But you to love me.
No, I wouldn't lie.
You know I'm not that kind of guy.
