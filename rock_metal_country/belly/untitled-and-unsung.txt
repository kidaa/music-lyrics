I want you soft in the middle.
I see a strange and furious face.
I know your heart.
I want your pearly hand in my hair.
We make a strange and furious pair.
I want you locked in the middle.
I know your heart.
I know your heart.
It's just like mine was.
So you wanna know why I can't sleep.
You wanna know why I can't sleep.
You wanna know why I can't sleep.
Unless I've got a belly full of wine,
You show up in time for a bad time.
Mmm, 'less I've got a belly full of wine,
You show up and the world is wild.
I want your pearly little hand in my hair.
We make a strange and furious pair.
I want you pearly on the inside.
I know your heart.
I know your heart.
It's just like mine was.
So you wanna know why I can't sleep at night.
You wanna know why I can't sleep at night.
You wanna know why I can't sleep.
Unless I've got a belly full of wine,
You show up in time for a bad time.
Mmm, 'less I've got a belly full of wine,
You show up in tails for a bad time.
Mmm, 'less I've got my belly full of wine,
I'm drunk and the world is wild.
You got it.
Heaven in your hand,
You got it.
You got it,
