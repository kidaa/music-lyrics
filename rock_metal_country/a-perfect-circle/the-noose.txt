So glad to see you have overcome them.
Completely silent now
With heaven's help
You cast your demons out 
And not to pull your halo down 
Around your neck and tug you off your cloud 
But I'm more than just a little curious
How you're planning to go about 
Making your amends to the dead 
To the dead 

Recall the deeds as if 
They're all someone else's 
Atrocious stories 
Now you stand reborn before us all 
So glad to see you well 

And not to pull your halo down 
Around your neck and tug you to the ground 
But I'm more than just a little curious 
How you're planning to go about 
Making your amends to the dead 
To the dead 

With your halo slipping down 
Your halo slipping 
Your halo slipping down 
Your halo slipping down 
Your halo slipping down [repeated]

Your halo slipping down to choke you now
