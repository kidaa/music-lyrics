My reflection
Wraps and pulls me under
healing waters to be
Bathed in Brena
Guides me
Safely in
Worlds I've never been to
Heal me
Heal me
My dear Brena
So vulnerable
But it's alright
Heal me
Heal me
My dear Brena
Show me lonely and
Show me openings
To lead me closer to you
My dear Brena
Feeling so vulnerable
But it's alright
Opening to... heal...
Opening to... heal...
Heal.. Heal.. Heal...
Heal me
