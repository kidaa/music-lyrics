Mother, mother,
There's too many of you crying,
Brother, brother, brother,
There's far too many of you dying,
You know we've got to find a way,
To bring some loving here today

Father, father,
We don't need to escalate,
You see, war is not the answer,
For only love can conquer hate,
You know we've got to find a way,
To bring some loving here today

Picket lines and picket signs,
Don't punish me with brutality,
Talk to me, so you can see,
Oh, what's going on,
What's going on,
Yeah, what's going on,
Ah, what's going on,

Father, father, everybody thinks we're wrong,
But who are they to judge us?,
Simply because our hair is long,
You know we've got to find a way,
To bring some understanding here today, Oh

Picket lines and picket signs,
Don't punish me with brutality,
Talk to me,
So you can see,
What's going on,
What's going on,
What's going on,
What's going on,
