Lying all alone and restless
unable to lose this image
sleepless, unable to focus on
anything but your surrender
Tugging a rhythm to the vision that's in my head
Tugging a beat to the sight of you lying
So delighted with a new understanding
Something about a little evil that makes that
Unmistakable noise I was hearing
Unmistakable sound that I know so well
Spent and sighing with a look in your eye
Spent and sighing with a look on your face like
Sweet revelation sweet surrender
sweet, sweet surrender
Surrender...
Tugging a rhythm to the vision that's in my head
Tugging a beat to the sight of you lying
So delighted with a new understanding
Something about a little evil that makes that
Unmistakable noise I was hearing
Unmistakable sound that I know so well
Spent and sighing with a look in your eye
Spent and sighing with a look on your face like
Sweet revelation sweet surrendering
Sweet revelation sweet
Thinking of you, thinking
Thinking of you, Thinking of you, Thinking of you, thinking...
Sweet revelation sweet surrendering
Sweet revelation
