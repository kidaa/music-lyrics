When my heart starts to beat like a hammer and my eyes get full of tears 
Oh when my heart starts to beat like a hammer and my eyes get full of tears 
You know you've only been gone 24 hours baby and baby it seems like a million years 

Now if I ever mistreated you baby, you know I didn't mean no harm 
Oh if I ever mistreated you baby, God knows I didn't mean no harm 
You know I'm just a little country boy baby and I was raised right down on the cotton farm 

Oh you give me so much trouble baby, baby I don't know what to do 
Oh you give me so much trouble baby, baby I don't know I don't know what to do 
I ain't got nothing I ain't got nothing now baby 
Baby it's all over and it's all on account of you
