How can I explain
This feeling that's true
Honey, I can't hardly stand it,
I wanna make love to you.

I ain't gonna try to tell you
How it's made me so blue,
Sitting alone here and wondering.
I wanna make love to you.

When the stars fall from the heavens
And the rivers, they stop their flow,
If you just stop and talk to me,
Honey, that's when I'll know.

I wanna make love to you.
I wanna make love to you.
I wanna make love to you.
I wanna make love to you.

Please, stop and tell me,
Tell me you want me too.
Come on, baby,
I wanna make love to you.

Chorus

Oh, darling.
