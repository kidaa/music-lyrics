I would rather see you
Sleeping in the ground,
I would rather see you
Sleeping in the ground
Than to stay around here
If you're gonna put me down.

Well, I give you all my money,
Everything I own.
Well, I give you all my money,
Everything I own.
Well, some day I'm gonna get lucky,
And down the road you know I'm goin'.

Well, I would rather see you
Sleeping in the ground,
Well, I would rather see you
Sleeping in the ground
Than to stay around here
If you're gonna put me down.

You know I give you all my money,
Yeah little girl, everything I own.
Well, I give you all my money,
Everything I own.
Well, today I'm gonna get lucky,
And down the road you know I'm goin'.
