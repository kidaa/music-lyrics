You said you was hurting,
Almost lost your mind,
And the man you love,
He hurts you all the time.

When things go wrong,
Go wrong with you,
It hurts me, too.

You love him more
When you should love him less.
I pick up behind him
And take his mess.

Chorus

He love another woman
And I love you,
But you love him
And stick to him like glue.

Chorus

Now you better leave him;
He better put you down.
Oh, I won't stand
To see you pushed around.

Chorus
