Go down easy and let me take my time.
Go down easy and let me take my time.
Rock me slow till I lose my mind.

Roll it over, let's take it from behind.
Roll it over, let's take it from behind.
It's only love, God knows it ain't no crime.

You don't know how much it means to be here in your arms.
Roll it over.
Roll it over.
