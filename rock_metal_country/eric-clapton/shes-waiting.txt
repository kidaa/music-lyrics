She's waiting for another love.
She's waiting for another love.

She's been waiting for another love,
Someone that she can show into her heart.
And when she finally finds a stronger love,
Your whole world's gonna fall apart.

Chorus

You've been abusing her for far too long;
Think you're a king and she's your pawn.
Get ready now, 'cause pretty soon
She'll be gone and you'll be on your own.

Chorus

I see the hunger burning in her eye;
Any fool could see there's something wrong.
You keep pretending not to care,
But I will hear you sing a different song.

Chorus

Waiting for another lover,
Hoping for the time that she'll find another...
