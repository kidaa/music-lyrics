It's a long way from home,
Can't sleep at night.
Call on your telephone;
Something just ain't right.
That's evil, evil is going on wrong.
I want to warn you brother,
You better watch your happy home.

You make it to your house,
Knock on the front door,
Run 'round to the back;
You'll catch him just before he goes.
That's evil, evil is going on.
I have warned you brother,
You better watch your happy home.

If you call on the telephone
And she answers long and slow,
Grab the first thing smoking
And you have to haul her home. *
That's evil, evil is going on wrong.
I have warned you brother,
You better watch your happy home.

{* This is as close as I can come to something sensible; I'm pretty sure they
flubbed the line, especially since the only released version is an outtake. The
original Howlin' Wolf record has  Grab the first train smoking if you have to
hobo.  The Jeff Healey Band perform the song on their  Cover To Cover  album
with the line  Catch that last train out, even if you have to haul.   The Eric
Clapton Book - Easy Guitar  lists this line as  Grab the first thing smoking,
and you have ta holler go home. }
