Well now it's three o'clock in the morning and I can't even close my eyes 
Three o'clock in the morning baby and I can't even close my eyes 
Can't find my baby and I can't be satisfied 

I've looked around me and my baby she can't be found 
I've looked all around me, people and my baby she can't be found 
You know if I don't find my baby, I'm going down to the Golden Ground 
That's where the men hang out 

Goodbye, everybody, I believe this is the end 
Oh goodbye everybody, I believe this is the end 
I want you to tell my baby, tell her please please forgive me 
Forgive me for my sins
