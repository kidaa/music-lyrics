God's got a plan, he's making it clear
Sweet little song in your ear
Like hearts made of diamond, love will prevail
Put a little wind in your sail
I'd do anything, anything you can dream of
I'd do anything, anything for your love
For your love
For your love
Listen now baby, I'm gonna tell you true
Just how much that I love you
I got a sweet feelin' I know is real
This kind of love you can't conceal
I'd do anything, anything you can dream of
I'd do anything, anything for your love
For your love
For your love
I'd do anything, anything you can dream of
I'd do anything, anything for your love
For your love
For your love
