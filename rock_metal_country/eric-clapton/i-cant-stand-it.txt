by Eric Clapton
You've been told, so maybe it's time that you learned.
You've been sold, maybe it's time that you earned.
I can't stand it.
You're fooling around, I can't stand it.
You're running around, I can't stand it.
You're fooling around with my heart.
I'll explain; I feel like I'm being used.
Make it plain, so you don't get confused.
Chorus
Chorus
It's time, time for me to let you know.
Ain't no crime, no crime to let your feelings show.
Chorus
