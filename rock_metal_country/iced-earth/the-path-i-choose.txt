[Music: Schaffer, Shawver / Lyrics: Schaffer]

During the last rays of the sacred moon
I walk the desolate terrain cold and all alone
The rider came to me a black tornado, a violent mass
The cloud of evil rose, now I'm marked for all time

Temptation befell me
Darkness is calling for me
This is the path that I choose
This is the path that I choose

Forced power besieged in me
Showing visions of what will be
Now obsessed with my fate
I must go forth and conquer

The chosen one to lead the pack
This boiling hate has risen
From the depths of my blackened heart
This madness is my destiny

Temptation befell me
Darkness is calling for me
This is the path that I choose
This is the path that I choose
