[Schaffer]

Daylight breaks hard on sacred ground
For centuries we've questioned them of His birth
But in this hour, on this day, The Elder knew
Years of madness must now subdue
Order must be enforced to hide the truth
Cause on this day, in this hour it's coming true

Child of the wicked and ancient man
Baptized in black magic, their master plan
Born of the Watch, his prophecy, by their command

[Chorus]
So, behold the birth, the wicked child
Born of the Beast, in eastern sands
He will arise, He will divide
He has the power to bring the end

It's up to us now to seal his fate
Marked with the proper math the child's none to late
Blessed by the Beast, our Chosen One was born this day
He'll rise from the ashes of our dying race
Manipulate history, time and space
The Elder, Men of the Watch, professed this day

So, behold the birth, the wicked child
Born of the Beast, in eastern sands
He will arise, He will divide
He has the power to bring the end
Behold the birth, the wicked child
Born of the Beast, in eastern sands
He will arise, He will divide
He has the power to bring the end
