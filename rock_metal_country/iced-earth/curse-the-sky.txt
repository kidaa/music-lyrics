[Music: Schaffer, Shawver / Lyrics: Schaffer]

How much hate
Can one man feel
When his kingdom is crumbling
How much pain
Can one man take
When his future is melting
Eyes of fire blast his brain
Cursing heaven and hell
Nothing barred just asking why
No answers to be heard
Fire eyes, curse the skies
Thanks maker for questions unanswered
Falsify, disposition died
You detest the faker
Eyes, lies
I curse the skies
Tell me something
Tell me why
Terror reigns, I'm in pain
Why, why, I curse the sky
Tattered times and brainwashed minds
Cluttering up his thinking
Boiled hate just can't wait
There's no more self control
Eyes, lies
I curse the skies
Tell me something
Tell me why
Terror reigns, I'm in pain
Why, why, I curse the sky
