[Schaffer, Barlow, MacDonough]

There is a place far from her home
She strayed her path too long
In that wood, she found the stone
Lost souls should never look upon

At first glance, a lone monolith
Lifeless, cold and grey
She looked in deep, this timeless relic
The lost fall easy prey

Come into my world, my child
I will take you home
I'm your Reaping Stone

Come into my world, my child
I will take you home
I'm your Reaping Stone

Think not of ones you've lost
Nor of ones you leave
I shall give you strength to pass
I will set you free

Come into my world, my child
I will take you home
I'm your Reaping Stone

Come into my world, my child
I will take you home
I'm your Reaping Stone
