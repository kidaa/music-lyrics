[music - SchafferShawver]
[lyrics - Simmons]

Angels coming from above
Take the essence of his love
Challengers call him from all around
Demons coming from the ground

Battles won and nothing gained
Feel the pain
Feel the shock
From the depths of hell

Darkness dwelling in his soul
True damnation no control
Shattered pieces of his past
Broken dreams among the dead

When the smoke clears he will arise
Feel the pain
Feel the shock
From the depths of hell
