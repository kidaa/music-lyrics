[Music: Schaffer / Lyrics: Schaffer]

The feeling that you get when we creep inside
You won't see us there, you won't feel our stare
But when we're next to you we do all we can do
To get the cold sweat out, watch you squirm about
And as you try to move we grab and strangle you
With all of your deceit and our reality

Night
Nightmares
In the night

Hell is coming down, your fate has turned around
Too scared to make a sound
Now you're frozen there in your human shell
It's a nightmare I am the god of fear

Night
Nightmares
In the night
