[Music: Schaffer, Shawver / Lyrics: Schaffer]

I came into this world
A screaming infant
Forced entry into this life
As I grow the pain sustains
Deep inside my soul
Visions come and visions go
But hate will never leave me
As I grow the pain sustains
Deep inside my soul
Visions come and visions go
But hate will never leave me
Life and death never again
I shall not return
Soul sucking pious man
I shall not return
The reflection, an aging soul
My body's old and cracked
Death soon will be with me
Coldness, inactive pain
Soul sucked at the speed of light
Trapped in someone else
No please not again
Evil reincarnated
The cycle's spun once more
Soul sucked at the speed of light
