[Schaffer]

Pure ambition burns in me
It's a beast, never to be tamed
And the only peace I can find
Is when I'm here with you
You are the ones that keep me high
You are the ones for which I'll die
Forever we will be
Standing tall, side by side
We're the children of the night

[chorus]
Blessed are you
Blessed am I
Children of the night

So this song is for all of you
By my side, through and through
We'll roam that world true and free
Feeding you the inner beast
You are the ones that keep me high
You are the ones for which I'll die
Forever we will be
Standing tall, side by side
We're children of the night

Blessed are you
Blessed am I
Children of the night

The storm we ride
Side by side
You keep me high
For you I'll die
Through the storm we ride
