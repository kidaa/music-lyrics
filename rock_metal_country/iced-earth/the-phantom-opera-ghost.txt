[Music: Jon Schaffer / Lyrics: Jon Schaffer]

[Y:] I feel you, from beyond the walls you speak to me
[M:] Christine my love Paris now will worship you
You will star soon I'll kill to make it sure for you
[Y:] Oh my love, won't you please show yourself to me
[M:] Soon I'll take you in my kingdom you're the queen.
It's dark and peaceful but my face you'll never see, no

[M:] Oh Christine on this eve I will come for you
[Y:] Erik my love, I've waited all my life for you
Please just take me I need to be with you
[M:] Take my hand, through the catacombs my lair awaits
[Y:] Caverns, mazes, the underworld and the blackest lake.
Enticing danger, your passion feeds me I'm your slave

[Y:] Now I've bathed in fear. I will not leave here
[M:] Breathe deep the darkness. Breathe deep the madness
[Y:] I'm so cold inside. Mental suicide
[M:] Breathe deep the darkness. Breathe deep the sadness

[M:] Oh Christine don't you know it's all for you
Carlotta's head and the other death's I planned.
All for you, to have your night in the spotlight.
From now on forevermore you will only sing for me

[Y:] So you are, you are the legend. The Phantom Opera Ghost
[M:] I am what man has made me. With his hate and cruel ways
[Y:] Why are you
[M:] Why am I
[Y M:] The Phantom Opera Ghost
[Y:] I have to see
[M:] You'll never see
[Y M:] What's behind the mask

[Y:] I'm so torn between love, death, life, and hate
[M:] Don't you doubt me, what we have is just our fate.
I now own you from this day forth; you'll be my slave
[Y:] Oh Dear God for this life I've lost the will
[M:] No this can't be I'd rather you die than spoil my dream.
Myself I'll kill if I can't have you no one will
