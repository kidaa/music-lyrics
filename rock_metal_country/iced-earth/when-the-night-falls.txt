[Music: Schaffer / Lyrics: Schaffer]

Look, out in the distant sky
Open, up your weakened minds
Feel, what's in store for you
The jackals howling at the moon
See, the curtain of the night
Falling, down into your life
Doom, is headed straight for you
The night comes shining through
Join us in our never ending journey
Into the burning lake of fire
Let us fill your helpless soul
Fill it with sweet desire
When the night falls
When the moon's full
Recall, the look in their eyes
The sign of hat, it burns
They've come for us, but we'll fight
Till death
Hypnotizing, paralyzing
Brings me to my knees
Tantalizing suicide
Drives me to the edge
When the night falls, when death crawls
Frozen in my sleep
Rippers slashing, terror laughing
Numbers burning deep
Join us in our never ending journey
Into the burning lake of fire
Let us fill your helpless soul
Fill it with sweet desire
When the night falls
When the moon's full
