[Music: Schaffer, Shawver, Abell, Adam / Lyrics: Adam]

One the night the darkness fell
Across the naked land
A demon force was summoned up
From the bowels of hell
The stench of death grew thick that night
We knew it was the end
We run to find a place to hid
The land was raped and bare
The wind it blows a eerie cold
A fog that never lifts
Their tears will flood the land tonight
And the thunder's drowned by screams
As I lay here
Freezing veins of ice
What will be for me
What will be the price
Is it what they say
Is it written on the walls
Why can't we stop
This shattered worlds' fate
Why didn't we try at all
Armageddon town life is gone
We knew it was the way
Written down so long ago
Implanted in our minds
Our fathers told us of this hell
They read it on the walls
It's written on the walls
It's written on the walls
The frightened children know not why
And no one will explain
We've brought it all upon ourselves
An ending to this world
Forgiveness for your soul you pray
But it's written on the walls
