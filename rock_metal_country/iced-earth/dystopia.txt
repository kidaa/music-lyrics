Enter the nightmare 
This future does implode 
A techno city-state 
A prison, nothing more 
Rounded up like cattle 
You're forced into the trains 
Nothing that you've ever known 
Will bring you so much pain

Pre-chorus 
If you try to resist me 
You'll find me inhumane 
But if you just submit 
You'll live your life a slave 
You'll love your servitude 
We'll medicate your pain 
With our technology 
We'll always keep you safe

Micro-chipped like dogs 
Their thoughts are not their own 
All that's left of human kind 
Is now in their kind 
Planned out through centuries 
Patient and contrived 
Played on man's naivet 
Gullible and blind

Pre-chorus 
If you try to resist me 
You'll find me inhumane 
But if you just submit 
You'll live your life a slave 
You'll love your servitude 
We'll medicate your pain 
With our technology 
We'll always keep you safe

Chorus 
The nightmare unfolds before my eyes 
I will resist 'til end of time 
A spirit born free 
Has to break these chains 
We're lost, we must find our way 
We'll find our way!

They say that you're a danger 
To everything that's pure 
There are too many of you 
They're offering the cure 
Swift extermination 
If you refuse the game 
Arrested development 
Your vaccinated fate

Pre-chorus 
If you try to resist me 
You'll find me inhumane 
But if you just submit 
You'll live your life a slave 
You'll love your servitude 
We'll medicate your pain 
With our technology 
We'll always keep you safe

Chorus 
The nightmare unfolds before my eyes 
I will resist 'til end of time 
A spirit born free 
Has to break these chains 
We're lost, we must find our way 
We'll find our way!
