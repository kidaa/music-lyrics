[Schaffer]

I can see clearly now, a painful vision indeed
An attack on hallowed ground, from high above
Alien to us, the species known as man
A serious threat, in the eyes of the Elder

So heed my warning, before our own existence falls near extinct
Our culture is lost in ancient mystery, covered in the sands of time

A sacred few survive the massacre this night
In secret they will meet a new society

Ten thousand years from now, a child will be born
I've seen the vision, the writing on the wall
He'll walk the Earth, two thousand years or more
Paving the way, for mankind's fall

So there is hope you see, but we must act with great speed
Assemble the chosen, the ones to lead, and morph them in the likeness of man

Oppressed for centuries, await the prophecy
The child will set us free, reclaim it rightfully

We'll take their identity and live among them free
All the while, plotting events that mold their history
We'll build the perfect beast with the knowledge that they seek
If it takes ten thousand years, we never will retreat

Assassins we will be, through human history
Jesus Christ to Kennedy, the Domino Decree
Disciples of the Watch, prepare the coming curse
If it takes ten thousand years, we never will retreat

And so, our world is doomed, we'll lay claim again some day
There is hope, in the birth of one, so many centuries away
