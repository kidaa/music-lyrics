[Music: Jon Schaffer/ Lyrics: Matthew Barlow]

I...I am a bastard son
Conceived of a hundred men
Now I'm the Chosen One
Back, looking back
Father William called me Johnny
But my mother called me Jack

I...I scream out to you
As I see them take you
Hell, it put me through
You...you gave me life
Then ripped out my emotion
And replaced it with a knife

I cut you once, I cut you twice
You're my midnight sacrifice
You shamed me...you shame God
You scream my name, and now you're gone

I've seen the rain wash over you a thousand times
Your flesh summons me 
God knows why
Repent your sins to me

Now...you're no different now
Still the same, the Devil's whore
Lilith on the prowl
I...I've got something for you
I know what real pain is
And you will too

I cut you once, I cut you twice
You're my midnight sacrifice
You shamed me...you shame God
You scream my name, now you're gone
