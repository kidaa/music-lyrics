[Music: Jon Schaffer / Lyrics: Matthew Barlow]

What's the reason for me to be this way
I'm lying on the floor
I've broken through some door
I don't know how I came to this
There is blood lust in my eyes
And someone in my mind saying

I have forced you here
I'm hiding, right here inside you
Trapped in here so long
You'll find me growing in every man

Who is this that speaks to me
Tearing down my mind
My reality
This must certainly be the one
What will I pay for this
This evil synthesis!

I'm out of control
Evil takes my soul

I can feel you inside me
You're not stronger than me
I won't let you
No, you can't have me!

I won't let you destroy me
You took away my life
With your wicked seed
If you're able to take control
You'll bring damnation upon my soul
