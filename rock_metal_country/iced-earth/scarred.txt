[lyrics - Schaffer]

Darkness calls down to me
Sweat pours from my body like rain
Growing wiser with each touch
A pawn in lucifers game, am I

It attacks me in the black abyss
The entity formless yet full of rage
The mark of the beast my body
Scarring me for eternal life

[Chorus]
I brought this all upon myself
Sold my soul to change my life
It's up to me and no one else
The beast in me can't control my life

[Bridge]
And so it's begun, the end of me
The seed was sewn now it's growing inside
My fate in control, not mine
He lied

[Repeat Chorus]
