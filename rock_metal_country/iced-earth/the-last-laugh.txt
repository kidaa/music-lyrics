[music - SchafferShawver]
[lyrics - Barlow]

My personal quest is to make your life hell
Yes dear friend listen up well
The power I've given I can take as well

[Prechorus]
I am your father destroyer of the light
I've taken your soul and have given you life
You are the damned condemned by my hand
My son creature of the night

[Chorus]
Extending, now you rise
Tormented, soul of fire
Deception in my eyes
Your life, your life is mine

[Bridge]
My new born son burn now with anger
I command and you must follow
Fly now and do battle
The heavens fall, mankinds disaster

In your hour of darkness
You warm my soul
God won't save you
Your souls been sold

[Prechorus]

[Repeat chorus]
