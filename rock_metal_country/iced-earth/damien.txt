[Music: Jon Schaffer / Lyrics: Jon Schaffer]

So the beast resides in me
Deep down I always knew
I never really did fit in
So diverse from all of you
Let him who understands
Know the number of the beast
It's a number of a man
A number just for me

As the boy becomes a man
Father's minions pave the way
Set in motion now, Armageddon,
Final conflict, end of days

I embrace the hounds of hell
And the power they oblige
For the task that lies ahead
The Nazarene I'll crucify
They'll see the raptures of our kingdom
They'll see the truth to mankind
I'll show what hell truly is
The monotony of their lives

[Chorus]
When the Jews return to Zion
And a comet fills the sky
The Holy Roman Empire rises
And you and I must die
From the eternal sea he rises
Creating armies on either shore
Turning man against his brother
Till man exists no more

[Bridge]
Now Disciples of the Watch
See your Prince of Darkness rise
Through famine and destruction
The Four Horsemen at my side
I demand a victory, I demand a sacrifice
Or spend all eternity
In the flaccid gut of Christ!
