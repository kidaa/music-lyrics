[Music: Schaffer / Lyrics: Schaffer]

I feel, you'll see, the night cold and dead
But watch out, we walk proud
Together now until the end
In these times we walk that line
These frozen times
Winter nights

[Bridge]
Look up to the sky, see the moonlit night
The winter night sends shivers up your spine
But it's deep inside your mind that's where you may find
Inner demons and your desire
Don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up, don't you ever give up

If you find you've crossed that line
Then it's time, a state of mind
Believe in what you see
Our sacrifice, reality
In these times you walk that line
these frozen times
Winter nights
