[Music: Jon Schaffer, Larry Tarnowski / Lyrics: Matthew Barlow]

Time is the bond of mortal life
Isis with the scroll of life
Raised her love Osiris from the dead
Live can transcend the mortal coil
With this script, the high priest of
The Pharaoh commits his sacrilege
Death is but a threshold
To another life, you will arrive
With this power
You shall live again, there is no end
You'll live again...

Love was the curse upon my soul
For it I would risk salvation
And utilize the scroll to save this one
Time is the sentence for my sin
Three thousand years my angry soul's
Been trapped inside this tomb of my condemn.

Death is but a threshold
To another life, I will arrive
With this power
I shall live again, there is no end.
I'll live again

Dawn shines a light on pain untold
Scarred from the millennia
The heart that beats inside my chest is cold
Rise, I'm rising from these sands of time
By the scarab's power I am given strength
With hate in hand, this misery I drink

Death is but a threshold
To another life, I will arrive
And with this power
I shall live again, there is no end
This pain won't end
