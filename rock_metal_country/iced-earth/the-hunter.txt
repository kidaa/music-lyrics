[musiclyrics - Schaffer]

A force of light an angel
Sent through time to destroy
Avenging the dark ones
Descending angelic force

Heaven sent the hunter
Her mission to crucify
Slay the hellborn
His offspring demonic force

[Chorus]
Descending from heaven
The angel sworn to bring him down
The hunter the thunder
The wrath of heavens comin' down

She swore an oath, an allegiance
Armageddon is in sight
To be the thorn in the devils back
To make him weak, the final fight

[Repeat Chorus]
