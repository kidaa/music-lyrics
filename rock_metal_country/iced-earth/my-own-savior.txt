[Schaffer, Barlow, Morris]

My only comfort is in death
My only solace, my dying breath
For release, I have prayed
Thrown past life, not afraid

Life's a bitch, life's a whore
Nothing less, nothing more
There is nothing she would do for me
I will end this suffering

[chorus]
Existence of one man
Hatred with no end
My madness, my sadness
I am my own savior

The voices are calling
Out of this life, I'm falling
There is one choice, that I see
In raging flames, The Dark One awaits

Existence of one man
Hatred with no end
My madness, my sadness
I am my own savior
