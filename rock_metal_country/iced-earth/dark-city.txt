This place is dark and grey 
Uneasy, I feel torn apart 
My mind is clouded and blurred 
This cry is interchanging

Sacrifice memories past 
Unaware of what Ive become

Constant changes are imploring me 
Search my mind, look for the answers 
Finding nothing but this fear in me 
Immersing myself in his feeling 
Realizing I am not alone 
They are watching people changing 
Unconsciously twisting memory 
Gathering our human feeling

Chorus 
Experimenting, to understand the human soul 
Endangered theyll fade away 
The wont deceive me 
Theyll never take my soul away 
Their life from fades

Fill our heads with false identity 
Synchronizing our confusion 
Using the dead for their own need 
Parasitic infestation 
Imprisonment in celestial space 
Unlocking the human life force 
Escaping their grasp now we are free 
Their objective failed unknowing

Chorus 
Experimenting, to understand the human soul 
Endangered theyll fade away 
The wont deceive me 
Theyll never take my soul away 
Their life from fades
