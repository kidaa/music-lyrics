[Music: Jon Schaffer / Lyrics: Matthew Barlow]

Since the dawn of time, he's been here
Forgotten son, testing all our fears
Nature's mistake, he sees no end
The dragon's child, walks among man

For centuries past, many tribes know the tales
Of men not returning, when they've gone there
And those who've returned, can't describe what they've seen
Their hair has turned white, and they've gone insane

Oh, beware the blackend water
The creature has come to take you away
Oh, beware unholy water
On this dying day
