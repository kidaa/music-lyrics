[musiclyrics - Schaffer]

A twisted state of mind, torn between two worlds
One of which the new me hates and the one that's coming true
The power is unleashed, they perish at my gaze
But am I really in control or am I just a slave

I called upon this god to deliver unto me
To grant what I desire he brought me to my knees
He turned his back on me and filled me with his lies
Ask and I received damnation was the price

I signed my name in blood, didn't read the fine print
Now I'm just a puppet god for the devils own descent
Bound and shackled here forever damned a slave
Fallen bloody tears can't wash the pain away

[Chorus]
All at once it's clear to me
Damnation and destiny
A slave to darkness shall I be
Damnation and destiny

And so I must repent or will I be destroyed
Will the one that lives in me release me from this lie
And will the wrath of god have mercy on my soul
Or humilate me, desecrate me, like his only son

[Repeat Chorus]
