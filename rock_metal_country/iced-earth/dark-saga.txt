[musiclyrics - Schaffer]

The deal was rigged
There's darkness in my soul
I want to die again

An empty soul shrouded in darkness
Alone and confused what am I
Images flash memories jaded
He took my life God damn his lies

Fight son of the damned, bring down the heavens
Smash in the gates, burn 'em down
You must accept the fate that you've chosen
You will obey your destiny

[Chorus]
I cheated myself for love
Love unconditional
Now just to see her face
I've lost it all

[Bridge]
I know there's goodness in me
Though I'm not the same
I will defy the master
I will refuse to be his slave

No, I was betrayed I can't accept this
My future's unclear, it's a lie
I'll follow my heart stand and be counted
The curse will lift I will survive

[Repeat Chorus]
