Music:Tolkki/Lyrics:Tolkki-Kotipelto
Hear my call,
Don't waste your time,
Remember what we're fighting for.

Hear my voice,
take my hand,
we got to win this war.

We were ment to be free
Not to live in slavery

To the other Galaxies we go,
Gather all our strength before they know.
Soon the time will come for all of us.
To unite our souls and hearts

Save the universe.
