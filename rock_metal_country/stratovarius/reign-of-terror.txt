Music:Tolkki/Lyrics:Tolkki
What the hell is going on, skijumpers making music that sells gold.
There's no talent in this game, hunting for the fame.
Publicity is all you need, that's why it feels to me like

Reign of Terror
Reign of Terror

Everything costs so much nowadays and individuals vanish in the haze.
Entertainment for the masses saving, saving your own asses.
Rats are leaving sinking ship, still it feels to me like

Reign of Terror
Reign of Terror

What the hell is going on, everything is upside down.
Hunting hunting for the fame, terror terror everywhere.
