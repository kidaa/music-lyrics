Music:Tolkki/Words:Tolkki-Lassila
The time is running,
It's running so fast
that you don't notice
Years are passing by.

And you're growing older,
What happened to all your dreams?
Did they become true at all.

We cannot undo the deeds of the years.
They leave you on your own with all your deepest fears.

Don't look for the future,
Don't live in the past
just take it day by day
'case life goes fast.The minutes the hours the days and the years
will fly so live still when you have the time.
We cannot undo...

Wheel of the time,
Turns again tonight,
Eternally decides our destiny.

Wheel of the time,
Turns again tonight,
Without reason or rhyme the hands of time
