It's 4 in the morning I'm gazing the sky with Millions of stars.
A moment before the dawn the endless universe fills me all.
Where are you now? Alone just like me and Venus in the Morning?

I touch your face that's filled with pain,
I kiss away the tears fromyour eyes.
I've waited YOU for 8000 days.
Now I've come here to set you free.
But where are you now...

Forget the future don't live the past.
Live for today because life goes too fast.
Go find the key to you divine mind,
open the door so many answers you'll find,
Like Venus in the Morning.
