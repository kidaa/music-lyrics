Music:Tolkki/Lyrics:Tolkki
Here in the Universe
I find some things that are so hard to understand
The vastness of space just takes my breath away
I see through history
The years they come and go
The seconds that will shape my destiny
The time that we spend here
Is precious, that I see so clearWhat is our place in here?
What is the meaning of the pain we feel?
Where did all this come from?
The galaxies, the moon the stars, oh 
I don't know
I really want to know what is the meaning of evolution
They say that we are the crown of all creation

So let's break free from these chains
Of fear, hate and greed
And join together singing 
our Celestial Dream
Freedom is awaiting
For those who take the path 
less traveled
And in the end we'll all sing our Celestial Dream
