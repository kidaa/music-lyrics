The witch is worried Which is bitch?
Take both of them in and do a spin experimenting
with fingers spreading lips concealing the secrets of the joy

The witch-hunt is coming to town you better look around
The witch-hunt is coming to town they'll see that you will get found
The witch is clever

Forgets never She take her revenge All in the end
Two at the time Bell tolls inside Casting joy all over you
Oh boy

The witch-hunt...

The whip is ready Standing steady
In between the hands By your command
Do what you have to do And she's glad to
Take your little life And ride away
