Music:Tolkki/Lyrics:Tolkki
I wake up in the morning so far away from home,
trying to make it through the day.
Many miles are between us, I'm sending my love from this payphone.
Through the storms we've wandered,
many mountains we have climbed but all the bad times are behind.

The road is free - I'm coming Home.

Without you I am like a ship without it's sails,
calling the wind to save me.
I'd climb the highest mountain,
I'd cross the seven seas just to see your smile again.

All the trust that was built along the years is coming back to stay I know.
Just look ahead the road is free - I'm coming Home.
With every step I'm closer to home, when I'm back you won't be alone.
Soon I'll see the familiar door before my eyes and you.
