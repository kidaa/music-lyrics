Scream at nights But you won't be heard
It's deep inside The pain within your head
You cry for help The torture won't let you go
Your mind is aching And you can't go on

Reaching for window
Your execution
The only solution
Night Screamer

Afraid at nights There's nothing to be afraid of
Your nightmares Won't leave you alone
Try and think hard What's wrong in your life
Try and stay cool You'll find peace of mind

Reaching for...
