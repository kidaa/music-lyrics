Music:Tolkki/Lyrics:Kotipelto
Throwing my dreams out of my mind casting them into the sky,
canceling tasks I've delayed for so long now it's do or die.

I can't be seen I can't be heard
but I am here and I am wondering.

Will the sun rise tomorrow will it light up my sky
Can I wake up with no sorrow awaiting.
Will the sun Rise tomorrow, will I still see the dawn
and not worry 'bout the future at all.

At the end of each day I promise myself, I'd better start to live.
Coz sooner or later I'll find out there's so much I can give.

I can't be seen I can't be heard
but I am here and I am wondering.

Will the sun rise tomorrow will it light up my sky
Can I wake up with no sorrow awaiting. 
Will the sun Rise tomorrow, will I still see the dawn
and not worry 'bout the future at all.
