I have seen the future of mankind, the wisdom of my prophecies you'll find.
Follow the truth and be careful are we the last?
Hundred years has passed what have we done, inconceivable damage under the sun.
I think it's too late to change the man - we are the last.

The world keeps turning while people yearn for more,
Mother nature is crying for change,
the time will come when we all must pay for what we have done,
are you prepared for that?

As we are reaching the end of the century there's message we can send,
be strong and bold and never lose your mind cause we are the last.

Signs of the end I see,
let them hear my voice in every corner of the world,
take heed of the warnings that I give,
I have seen the Southern Cross forming in the sky.

"There shall be heard in the air the noise of weapons
and in the same year the divines shall be enemies.
They shall unjustly put down the holy laws and by thunder and war,
true believers shall die"
-Nostradamus: Century I V:43-
