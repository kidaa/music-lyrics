I'm entering into the woods.
I left everything behind.
I have to follow my heart.

Don't know what I'm looking for.
Starlight's guiding my way
to old black oak where we meet.
Now it's full moon.

Other side is calling me
Singing dancing this is no dream
Twilight Symphony
The feast is going on.Rapture never seen before.
The fury is taking us to a new level soon.
Hearing voices everywhere telling me what to do.
Giving me answers.

Other side is calling me,
Singing dancing this is no dream
Twilight Symphony
The spirits are calling me

I only wish to die, there is no question why... anymore
