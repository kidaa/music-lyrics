Music:Tolkki/Lyrics:Tolkki
I'm your God, computer's my name.
Give the password or you will fail.

I will lock you into my mind,
your number is all you will find.

Don't try to run
I'll take your life and the will of your power.
Under the sun,
there is no place where you can hide.

If you are a virus instead,
Go away there's nothing for you here.
Log you out of my system,
no use commands are always the same.

Don't try...
