Music:Tolkki/Lyrics:Tolkki
Looking back through time through my childhood days.
I used to have a place where I could escape reality.
But lately things have been so difficult for me.
Trying to reach for the light, in the fall of darkness.

Waiting watching my life,
I'm wasting my time,
I'm losing grip from life.

Going back to my dreamspace leavin it all behind.
Soon the things will be allright, when I get there.
Am I safe in here, nothing left to fear.

I will close my eyes and float away with stream.
Wandering here in this eternal darkness.
No signs of light anywhere. I am going insane.
Now I am leaving this life, no hope left I want to die.
