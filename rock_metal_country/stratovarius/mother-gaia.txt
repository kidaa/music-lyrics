Music:Tolkki/Lyrics:Tolkki
Time waits for no one
So they say
It goes on forever

The tears of pain
I see in your eyes
How can we change for the better?

Hate and greed`s getting stronger day by day
Injustice rules the world
Killing the lungs of the Earth
How far are we prepared to go?

I have seen the Light
It came into my life
There's no second chance
We should have learned by now
But it's not too late to change the course
There's so much more than this, oh Mother Gaia

Can you see, can you feel all the beauty that we have in this world?
There's so much to see, forever
Ignorance, arrogance
Keep us from being ourselves so we just follow our leaders - Why
