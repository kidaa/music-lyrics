Went into the plane was scared like hell. Tried to relax for awhile.
But when we took off, I feared we would fall, waving goodbye to this life.

I'm flying through winds tonight.
No sign of the dawn or light.

Silhouettes in the sky,
Wings are carrying me through the night.
Silhouettes in the sky,
Destination unknown
Distant Skies

After a while,
I tried to sleep,
but watched two movies instead,
The fear struck again,
How I hate this plane,
I hope this would come to an end.

I'm flying...

Silhouettes...
