Music:Tolkki/Lyrics:Kotipelto
When clouds are covering the sky I can't help thinking what's behind.
In a fading evening I can feel strange thoughts in my mind.

What if we aren't alone here, there's a clone of everyone somewhere
that duplicates all that we do. Not like me not like you but our other ego.

There ain't no wars or crises only joy and compromises time has stood still.

Why don't you take me there, wanna feel some infinity.
Why don't we just dare coz after all remains...

Eternity.

A landscape with no trees and a mist arising from the distance.
An illusion just for me or a proper reward and a chance.

There ain't no wars or crises only joy and compromises time has stood still.

Why don't you take me there, wanna feel some infinity.
Why don't we just dare coz after all remains...

Eternity.
