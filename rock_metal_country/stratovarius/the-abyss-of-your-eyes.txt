Music by Tolkki, words by Kotipelto

I feel like I'm drowning
Trying to catch my breath
Don't know what is happening
There's no sense of time

Deep underneath my skin
Feeling the pain within hear my cry
I feel drawn towards you can't resist
I don't know why

My life is changing I cannot recall

Where I've been before - the abyss of your eyes
Meaning so much more, am I losing my mind

The sun doesn't shine
But your eyes light my way
I've found what I've been searching for
My love won't go astray

Deep underneath my skin
Feeling the pain within hear my cry
I feel drawn towards you can't resist
I don't know whyMy life is changing I cannot recall

Where I've been before - the abyss of your eyes
Meaning so much more, am I losing my mind

So many years my drifting heart has wandered around

Don't turn on me please won't you stay by my side

My life is changing I cannot recall

Where I've been before - the abyss of your eyes
Meaning so much more, am I losing my mind
