Music:Tolkki/Lyrics:Lassila
I worked so hard to get my aim,
pulled out wrong card, is this my last game.
Too fast too soon, you know it takes time,
hasty deeds spoilet the chances of mine.

I'm burning inside outside seems allright,
try not to think about it much,
It's hard to say, when I will play again.

Shattered
My hands are shattered
Shattered
My life is shatteredI'm dressed to kill and ready to score.
3rd pain pill and there's pain no more.
I can't break out. Out of these walls,
walls that sometimes the skull is called.

I'm burning...

Shattered...
