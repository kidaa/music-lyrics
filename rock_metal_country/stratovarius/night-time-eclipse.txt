If I could stay awake for awhile I would see another morning.
Don't wanna fall asleep now when everything seems so far and beyond.
Walking down a familiar road but the darkness is misleading me.
I know I should feel fear inside but still the shadows is where I wanna be.

Just an ordinary day stealing all the hope away.
Wanting me to be the one who has dreams mad of clay.

My fading confused mind creating phrases unknown.
I know I shouldn't stay awake
if I fall asleep they just might find me.
Now all is so clear I can finally proceed.

My fading...

Waiting for the dawn soon to arrive.
So few options that I have and I can use.
Life's circumstances can be so cruel.
If I take a chance I just might make the wrong move.
