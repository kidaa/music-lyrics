Music:Tolkki/Lyrics:Tolkki-Lassila
Shades of night, I'm walking through sleeping village.
That is having a dream of thousand dreams.
Moon is guiding my way through the land,
the snow is silently falling from the sky
that is lit by millions stars

Nightfall-I feel the breeze
Nightfall-On my face
Nightfall-And the trees are
Nightfall-Covered with white lace
