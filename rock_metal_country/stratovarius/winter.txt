Music:Tolkki/Lyrics:Tolkki
Silence is all I hear, blackness fills my world.
Midwinter days and lonely nights,
Depression takes over my frozen mind.
Morning starts a new day,
Dawning nowhere to be seen,
Oh won't you break,
My chains and let me go free as a bird in the sky.

Winter blows colder,
I'm growing older.
Visions of darkness,
Breaking the silence.Winter blows colder,
I'm feeling older.
Light fades away,
I'm here to stay.

I'm telling you, no one could ever take your place.
Open your eyes and you will see.

Winter blows...
