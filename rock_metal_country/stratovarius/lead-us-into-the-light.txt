Hey you, take a look around,
Can you feel the change begin?
Soon it will be too late,
if you don't wake up.

Outside the winds are blowing
and the people are staring so cold.
The look that's in their eyes,
Tells me somethings wrong.

Lead us into the lightIt's so strange,
We have come so far,
Still knowing what will happen,
when we close our eyes.

Is this the hell on earth?
And the heaven is out of our sight,
open your eyes realize,
It's not too late.

Lead us into the light
