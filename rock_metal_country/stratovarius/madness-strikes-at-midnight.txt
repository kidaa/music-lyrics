He's crawling out from the asylum,
Under cover of the night.
Insanity of his crazy mind,
It's useless for you now to hide.
Walking the streets someone's in sight.
He's waiting for you in the night.

Hiding the shadows,
Hiding the alleys
He's ready to kill tonight.

So lock your doors and hide
And prey your God 'cause you're not alone.

Years he spent in the cage, They did not help him at all.
Now today with the power of his rage, He's slaughtering people tonight.
Walking the streets someone's in sight, He's waiting for you in the night.

Hiding the shadows,
Hiding the alleys
He's ready to kill tonight.

So lock your...

Madness strikes at midnight
