Sign of the times and writings on the wall.
They show me, it's time has come.
Order of a new kind, we will all find stronger than never before.
Things are pretty much the same like in year '38.

Oh won't we ever learn.
This time it's gonna be different,
so let's all join our hands
and let the children sing, for the last time

4th Reich is rising,
Can't you see the signs?
4th Reich is rising,
For the last time.

Let's just press more money, don't worry about inflation,
We got to have more weapons to carry on.
Unemployement and sorrow, cannot be avoided at this point,
but things will be so different, when they are ruling the world

4th Reich is rising...

What will be left to our children?
Is this our final destiny?
