Music:Tolkki/Lyrics:Tolkki
I stand alone in the darkness. The winter of my life came so fast.
Memories go back to my childhood to days I still recall.

Oh how happy I was then, there was no sorrow there was no pain.
Walking through the green fields sunshine in my eyes.

I'm still there everywhere, I'm the dust in the wind.

I'm the star in the northern sky. I never stayed anywhere
I'm the wind in the trees, would you wait for me forever?
