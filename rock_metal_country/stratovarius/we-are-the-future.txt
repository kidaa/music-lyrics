Music:Tolkki/Lyrics:Tolkki
What is wrong with a man destroying the land, our planet is full of waste.
Sheltering ozone layer is no more a shield, the temperature is rising up.

Now it's time to stop this madness, preventing increasing sadness,
let's put end to all this while we can.

Man against man, how somebody can, judge by colour of the skin.
See the signs make up your mind, now it's time for the change,
it is not too late.

Now it's time...

Save us, we are the future.
Lead us into the better world,
show us the way to reality.
No more injustice or cruelty.
Save us, we are the future.
Lead us into the better world,
show us the way to reality injustice is all gone.

Fast, fast stop this course now last,
last or we won't last,
past stop living in the past or you will die.
End, end, end of our time,
time our precious time,
Crime, crime against mankind we have to pay.

In the course of mad destruction,
there'll be no coming back,
the nuclear end is in sight.
Soon there will be no one to fight with.
Take a look into the sky,
it may be your last time.
The complete end is in sight,
soon there will be no one to fight, with me.

Save us...
