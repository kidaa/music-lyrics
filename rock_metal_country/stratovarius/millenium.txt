Music:Tolkki/Lyrics:Tolkki
More that I live
More clear it's each day
We got to change our ways
There is no way to go back anymore
Eons rumble through space

We must find new ways to live
I know there's so much more to give
Millennium - Where do we go?
Millennium - Time will show
Forevermore - The light will be guiding our journey
Millennium - Show us the way
Millennium - To the new day
Forevermore - Give us a chance to changePeople may come and people may go
But dance of time is eternal
What is the meaning of this cosmic play?
Will we see another day?

We must find new ways...
