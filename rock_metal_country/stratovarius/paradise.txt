Music by Tolkki & words by Kotipelto

Late at night I find myself again
Wondering and watching TV
I can't believe what's on the screen
Something that I wouldn't like to see

Many rare species will perish soon
And we'll be short on food
Why do we have to be so selfish
We've got to change our attitudeI know that I am not
The only one that's worried
Why don't we all
Wake up, and realize

Like the birds in the sky
We're flying so high
Without making anykind of sacrifice
We've got so little time
To undo this crime
Or we'll lose our paradise

It seems to me that there's no sense at all
Nobody cares it's always the same
Mother nature's crying out in pain
I know we're the one's to blame
