Music:Tolkki/Lyrics:Kotipelto-Johnson
Walking down the path that lead me to my memories.
Facing all the way without a care in my stride.
Where are the friends of my yesterday, havge they moved on with their lives.
Can we still laugh and joke about things like before.

There's no need to hide the past that I have left behind,
It's a good resource somewhere to reach out.
It shouldn't be all up to them,
keeping in touch ain't that easy but I'll have to try.

Where have all the years gone that's what I am asking now.
What have I learned so far tell me Father Time - tell me now.

Now I understand I'll take from time what I need
And I store it inside it's there for me to find
I can't deny that the years will pass by but it won't bother me.
Coz now I will set out to realize my dream.

Where have all the years gone that's what I am asking now,
What have I learned so far tell me Father Time - tell me now.
