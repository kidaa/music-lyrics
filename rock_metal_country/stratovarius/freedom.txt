Music:Tolkki/Lyrics:Tolkki
Higher I set my goals everyday
I make my own rules that I will obey each moment
As long as I live
This is the life I was born to lead
Unique chance for me to express myself
And fullfill my dreams

I'm in control of this ship of mine
And everything will be just fine

Like the wind I'm free to go anywhere
I got my song, it dances in the air
Now I know what I'll do with my life
Now you will hear my freedom callAll those bad times I've had in my life
Change into blessings if I change the point of view
I needed them to grow
I've changed so much, I'm finally free
To do what I want without any fear and quilt
It's so amazing

I'm in control...

Like the wind...
