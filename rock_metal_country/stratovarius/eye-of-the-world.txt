Everywhere I go, I see people staring at me.
It makes me feel so strange,
why won't they leave me be.
So take a look in the mirror and maybe you'll see,
all the things that happened.
While you were looking at me,
Am I really so different?

In the eyes of the world,
you are no different to me.
In the eyes of the world,
is it so hard to see now?Everything we do is running into the sand,
and who is to take the food
away from the childrens hand.
We all could be friends now.
And it's not a crime but we have to be quick now.
Because we don't have much time,
Are we really so different?

In the eyes...
