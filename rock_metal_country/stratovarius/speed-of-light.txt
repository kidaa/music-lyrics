Music:Tolkki/Lyrics:Kotipelto
Today is just another day
of my life too short to live.
I should have somekind of meaning
a destiny to believe in
before I go to sleep.

I find some pictures of a time
when everything was still so fine.
Although the years have passed by.
I will give it all I have inside... everything.

I'm away lost in my thoughts,
everyday my life goes by at the speed of Light.
