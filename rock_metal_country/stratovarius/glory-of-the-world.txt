Music:Johansson/Lyrics:Johansson
The sun is setting on the pain
the people freezing in the rain
the Earth is rolling in her grave

I beg the light up in the sky
to make me whole, to tell me why
I can't be bothered to be brave

and I've been waiting, and hesitating,
and then I see the curtain fall:
the wonder of it allmy heart was blind, but now I see
I know the power and the glory of the world
I took a breath and now I'm free
I feel the glory of the world

the demons sometimes find a way
there's nothing keeping them at bay
but for the power of my mind

the road to paradise is long
and halfway there, I'm heading wrong
I'm leaving all the pain behind

the wonder of it all
my heart was blind, but now I see
I know the power and the glory of the world
I took a breath and now I'm free
I feel the glory of the world
