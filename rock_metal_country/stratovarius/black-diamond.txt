Music:Tolkki/Lyrics:Kotipelto
Again I see you standing there watching me.
Your gaze, those eyes are tantalizing openly,
inviting meto get close to you, can't help myself.
There's fascination in the air.

I try to fight this strong sensation but
there's no chance to escape from this temptation.
Feels like I've known you before, repeating phrases,
but I yearn for something more.

I know I can't stay by your side forever,
but I know I won't forget your beauty,
my Black Diamond.
