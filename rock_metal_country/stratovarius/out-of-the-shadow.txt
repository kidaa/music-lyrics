Music:Tolkki/Lyrics:Tolkki-Lassila
Out to the light from the mist from the shadows I go.
Facing the new world the odd things the places unknown.
Far away, I sail away today.

Seeing the new face impression the moment the thought.
Unarmed and naked defendless my mind is caught.
Far away, I sail away to stay.

Out of the Shadows we go,
There's no reason to hide anymore.
Out of the Shadows we go,
Into the new horizon Towards the new shore we go.
