Music:Tolkki/Lyrics:Tolkki
You found the truth again, I showed the way.
The Path of Wisdom is the only way to reality.
You learned to live your life, the hard way.
Your tears put out the fire from your soul.

Lost behind the lies, I can hear your cries,
now is the time to rise again so strong.

Learn from your past, but better make it fast.
The time is running out for you to change your life.
You must leart to live, there's so much to give.

Set fire to your soul again and be... The Rebel.
Hold your head up proud.
