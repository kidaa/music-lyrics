Music:Tolkki/Lyrics:Tolkki-Kotipelto
Once again I tried to make things work, facing all the power of society.
Searching all the answers of the life I'll never make it on my own.

Was I meant to fail every time?
Seems to me that's my destiny.
Is it all that's left for me,
confusion and bad memories.

But now my time has come, no more running in the dark.
I want much more than this, I really want it all.

Against the wind we run to every place under the sun.
We got so much power inside we will never give up.
Against the wind we go, towards the new shore.
Together we forget the sorrow it's forever gone.
