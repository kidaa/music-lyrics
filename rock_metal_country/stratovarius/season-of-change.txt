Season of Change
life feels so strange.
Look into my eyes
do you see the truth.

I'm lost and alone feelings unknown. 
They come to me stronger than before.

On winds of time my soul will fly.
The angels are knocking at my door.
Oh now I need to be free from all
this hatred I feel inside.

Let it be my dreams, let it be my thoughts.
All those thing in my heart.
One too many days, one too many years
I wasted for nothing.
I never realized the truth is inside
of every man for all to see.
Listen to me now I'm so close to you,
never felt like this before.

The carousel is spinning fast,
better enjoy while it lasts.
Every moment is like gold,
You'll remember when you're old.
And the meaning of this life
is to live and is to die.

Make the best out of your dreams,
they are the world where you are free.
All the sorrow and the pain will be washed away
by rain an eternal joy will come
I can be found by everyone.

Though the end is drawing near I'm not feeling any fear.
I have found the truth inside after all the tears I cry.

Season of Change...
