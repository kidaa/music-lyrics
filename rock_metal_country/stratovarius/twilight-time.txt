Music:Tolkki/Words:Tolkki-Lassila
Danger zone, I look into the mirror
see my face again I hear myself preaching,
You are getting bold, Growing old Skin turns cold.

You're to blame but I will fing the way to be myself again.
I break the mirror with the noise.

Stop preaching me,
Teaching me,
Leave me be.

There's no way to stuop me now, My end is in sight.
I reach for the light, Tonight.

Twilight Time,
It's twilight time,
Reaching for the morning light
Twilight Time
