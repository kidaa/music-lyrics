Music:Tolkki/Lyrics:Tolkki
I have been sailing across the oceans.
Flying across the blue sky.
Without never finding the answer,
the answer to question why.

Just when you think you reach it, It's gone.

Chasing Shadows
Chasing Shadows
Chasing Shadows - all your life

Harder you try to fix things in your life.
Faster you know it's in vain.

Searching for loving from strangest places, nothing is left but the pain.
Just when you think you reach it, It's gone.

Chasing Shadows...
