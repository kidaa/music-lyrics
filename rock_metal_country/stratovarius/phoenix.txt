Music:Tolkki/Lyrics:Tolkki
I am facing the truth
I got to change the way I live
Can't go on this way
The price is too high to pay

After the rain I feel the sun
See how I run to my destiny
Life is a game
I got to learn how to play
I make my own rules
'cause now I am free to choose
Courage and faith will show me the way
Se how I run to my destiny

Like the Phoenix I rise
From the ashes of life
I don't need fortune or fame
Just some peace of mindLike the Phoenix I fly
leaving the lies behind
Future's golden for me 
There is no one who can stop me now

I'm noble and strong
I'm walking down the road that I choose
Each day is a gift
And I know that I can't lose

Glorious future is waiting for me
See how I run to my destiny

Like the Phoenix...
