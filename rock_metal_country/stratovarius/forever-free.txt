Music by Tolkki, Words by Kotipelto

They try to give me answers
To questions I've never asked
I'll have no part in their conspiracy
I guess I am the kind of
Guy that will never stray
The thing I need is privacy

Some guiding, depriving
Misleading and combining
They're watching our every moveThey can try to bind our arms
But they can't chain our minds or hearts
We will keep our faith inside our souls
And never let it go - we are Forever free

You see them making headlines
New pictures tell old stories
Explaining what they have said and done
Media's new illusion
Creating more confusion
But I know that they'll soon be gone
