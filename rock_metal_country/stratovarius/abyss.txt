Music:Tolkki/Lyrics:Lassila
I'm out on the open sea, the wind is embracing me.
I'm watching the setting sun, far far away from you.
There's not much that I could do.
Do you know what's the only way for me.

Into the depths I fall, into the unknown darkness I go
Down down down
Falling into the Abyss

A morning of no recall, no memory nothing at all.
The sun is blinding my eyes.
The pain I feel in my head,
I think I'll go back to bed or should I have just one more.

Into the depths I fall, into the unknown darkness I go
Down down down
Falling into the Abyss.
