Music:Tolkki/Lyrics:Kotipelto
I feel like I'm drowning, trying to catch my breath.
Don't know what is happening, there's no sense of time.

Deep underneath my skin, feeling the pain within hear my cry.
I feel drown towards you can't resist,I don't know why.
My life is changing I cannot recall, where I've been before

The abyss of your eyes,
meaning so much more,
am I losing my mind

The sun doesn't shine,
but your eyes light my way,
I've found what I've been searching for,
my love won't go astray.

Deep underneath...

The abyss of your eyes...

So many years my drifting heart has wandered around,
don't turn on me please, won't you stay by my side.

My life is changing I cannot recall, where I've been before.
The abyss of your eyes, meaning so much more, am I losing my mind.
