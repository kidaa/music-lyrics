Music:Tolkki/Lyrics:Kotipelto
I hear footsteps dosing in recognizing them from my early days.
The times are different the image remains the same,
repeating back flashes remembering the name,
approaching  visions of things.

I can't recall, a familiar smile awakes the pain.
Unkept promises, the night awaits, the act of confidence,
the kiss of Judas  haunts me once again.
In your private chamber, you're all done.
The well earned silver pieces falling  to the floor.

The flame of the candle costing movements to the wall,
your eyes filled with guilt keep staring  at the door.
