Music:Tolkki/Lyrics:Tolkki
Tears of Ice, falling down.
My cheeks forming a lake, in it's surface,
I see your face and I watch it 'til it's gone.
There were times, all I did was cry out your name.
Only thing I feel now is pain...

Tears of Ice, frozen heart, icy drops fall to the ground.
Forming stream, golden dream that will lead me to your door.
There were times all I did was cry out your name.
Only thing I feel now is pain...

Baby you should see,
what you did to me,
Now I am crying
Tears of Ice
Baby you should feel,
like I felt those days,
Now I am crying

Tears of Ice
