I'm going back through time, before the war this crime.
Who would have believed that they would do it.

One April morning, without warning.
The sirens woke us up to minutes to live we got.I'm dying,
I'm crying still
I'm the lord
I'm fighting,
Denying still
I'm the Lord of the Wasteland.

Now I'm alone in here,
Last man on Earth I'll be,
Walking through chaos land,
there's just black mist and sand.

I'm dying...
