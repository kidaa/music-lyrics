We're Piling It Too High
Talk Not Saying Anything
What We Leave Behind
What We Can't Afford To Keep
There's No Sympathetic Posturing
There's No More True Humanity
The Old Ways Aren't Working Anymore
Let's Separate The Users
From The Whores
Creepy Crawl
Twist The 4-5 Cap
To Get Wrapped
Tight Slap The Wax
On The Wheels To Feel Alright
Find The Flow Freak
The Funk Like Your In Heat
Wrap The Leaf
Strike The Blunt
now Your In Deep
We've Got To Get Together
Got To Get With The Game plan
To Defeat The Dealer
That Dealt This Hand
I Don't Understand
Why The Kids Are Killing Kids
When The Only One's That Benefit
Are The Big Whigs
Mankind Unkind
Always A Fine Line
We've All Got To Die
And This Time It's My Time
Hindsight Blind fight
I Hate It When I'm Right
He Destroys The World
While We Sleep At Night
Twist The 4-5 Cap
And Understand That
If It Was Up To Me
I'd Free Charles Manson
Throw It All Away
Let's Separate The Users,
From The Whores
What Do We Have To Hope For
Why Do We Event Try
Laughed At Religion Long Ago
I Doubt I'll Be An Angel When Die
