well sweet little sista's high in hell cheat'n on a halo - 
grind in a odyssey holocaust heart kick on tomorrow - 
breakdown - agony said "ectasy" in overdrive she come a 
riding on the world - thunder kiss'n 1965 - yeah - wow! 
five - yeah - wow!! demon-warp is coming alive in 1965 - 
five - five - yeah - livin' fast and dying young like a 
endless poetry - my motor-psycho nightmare freak out 
inside of me - my soul salvation liberation on the drive - 
the power of the blaster move me faster - 1965 - yeah - 
wow! - five - yeah - wow! - demon-warp is coming alive in 
1965 - five - five - yeah - gimme that gimme that now - now
- now - yeah - roll'n like a supersonic another fool that 
gets down on it - pig sweat a million miles - i got a heart 
atomic style - i make it look easy - that's what i said - 
blast of silence explodes in my head - yeah - yeah - yeah - 
gimme that gimme that now - step 
to the moonshine frenzy hail: the 
ressurection - what's new pussycat? 
can you dig the satisfaction? well, 
you can't take it with you but you 
can in overdrive - yeah! some like it 
hot and twist'n, 1965 - yeah - wow! - 
five - yeah - wow! demon-warp is 
coming alive in 1965 - five - five
