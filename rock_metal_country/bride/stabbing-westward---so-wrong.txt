Thanks to Julia James for submitting       
the lyrics

wasted thoughts of you 
desperate prayers to you 
give me back my mind 
I'm empty inside 

what have I become? 
everything's undone 
a candle burns here in your honor 
my soul, a shrine i've built for you 
there's nothing left inside me 
nothing left inside but you 

can't seem to pretend 
this night needs to end 
I can't fill this hole 
you are all i know 

it's so wrong that I need you 
it's so wrong that I need abuse 
it's so wrong that I need you 
so wrong that I'm scared I'll die alone
