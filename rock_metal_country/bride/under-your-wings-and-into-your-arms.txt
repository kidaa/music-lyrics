I need to see a sign
Will you take me away
They come. They go. Will you stay here
I need to see a sign
You need me
Who wants more
I need him
Find my way
Be there now
Feel them
Be my call
I will be the one
I will lose the fight
You sing the songs
Of one hundred nights
Bring them to me
Because I know I'm right and I will
Take them all away
Never to be seen again
I'll take them to the sea
Leave it all to me because I'm
Feverish, develish and irrelevant
You need me
I want you
I need, I need, I need
Are you there with me
Be there now
Feel me now
All my world
