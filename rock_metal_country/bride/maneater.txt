Lyrics: Hall/Oates/S. Allen 

She'll only come out at night 
The lean and hungry type 
Nothing is new, I've seen her here before 
Watching and waiting 
She's sitting with you but her eyes are on the door 
So many have paid to see  
What you think you're getting for free 
The woman is wild, a she-cat tamed by the purr of a Jaguar 
Money's the matter 
If you're in it for love you ain't gonna get too far 

Oh here she comes 
Watch out boy she'll chew you up 
Oh here she comes 
She's a maneater 
Oh here she comes 
Watch out boy she'll chew you up 
Oh here she comes 
She's a maneater 

I wouldn't if I were you 
I know what she can do 
She's deadly man, and she could really rip your world apart 
Mind over matter 
The beauty is there but a beast is in the heart 

Oh here she comes 
Watch out boy she'll chew you up 
Oh here she comes 
She's a maneater
