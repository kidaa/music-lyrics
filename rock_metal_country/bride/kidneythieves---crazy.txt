the lyrics

crazy, I'm crazy for feeling so lonely
I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so blue
I knew, you'd love me as long as you wanted
and someday, you'd leave me for somebody new

worry, why do I let myself worry
wondering, what in the world should I do
crazy for thinking that my love could hold you

I'm crazy for trying, crazy for trying, and I'm crazy for loving you.
