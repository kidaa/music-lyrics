the lyrics

Obsessive acts of hate, abductions and massacre.
Breeding emotion subvergance, when the living become the dead
Home invasion, private party of thieves
Blood spilled, material thrill
a sign of the times 

Self-destruction, a terminal mind 

Sadomasochist a high profile, trained in apathy
Intellect repulsed, your torn, and death will have a face 

Ravage passion, a theme for the 90's
Tormented devients, when fucking becomes psychotic
Domesticated rage, actions of desperation
a struggle of inner-killing, a sign of the times 

Self-destruction, a terminal mind 

Stranggled to death, little miss beauty queen
With a fractured head, so it seems
America's little royal miss, raped of innocence
Daddy's little girl to the end 

Seduction and torture, sex of the 90's
Mass murders and random violence, when the living become the dead
Father killing mother, daughter,son suicide pact
Butchers black 24/7, a sign of the times 

Self-destruction, self destruction
a Human Disease 

Jealosy killed the queen
Sliced her neck from ear to ear
Money and power set the king free
a jury of his peers let him be 

Jealosy killed the queen
Sliced her neck from ear to ear
Money and power set the king free 

Shatter will in retribution
Life, watch it die, life ripped in half
Drastic pain a symphony, sceams
No escape your time to die
Hardened steel against your head, it weights
Self-destruct remain insane 

repeat second verse 

Death will have your face
