Oh beautiful earth  
For too long you have been silent  
Touch me once again  
The dark ground lies cold 

Et gelidus hoc voluntas firmamentum

Hark

Yes it is I 
The fever of mankind 
Urges whorish as ever 
I am the new Christ 
Silence yourself 
Nunquam 

You are powerless here  
Pityful one 

Pity me not

Give back the sun  
Souls will mourn  
In this unending season of darkness  
Beware, ravaged one  
Mine is the might 

If you're feeble, turn away 
No dagger glints in my hand 
Technique is secret 
Liar 
She have herself to me 

Please leave  
I think I'll close my eyes now  
The first sunshine was mine  
Look for me among the flowers  
Sleeping with the earth  
My Dying Bride  
The pity I fashion  
Through a rain of tears  


A tragic opus  
Immeasurable loss  
Tearful I rest  
Bask in my growing sorrow 

The females is such exquisite hell 
Lay my obscure hands upon you 
Macabre, erotica, passion 
Even in death, beauty is with you 

I extol you with loud praise 
You will grace my procession 
Why shouldn't I indulge 
In my own desires 

Bare your breasts to slow kisses 

Away bastard dog 
Nunquam 
Down from your throne 
Nunquam 
A dagger glints in my hand 
Am I afraid 
You'll perish alone 
Ha 

Pray to me 
Blasphemy 
Cry on me 
Die on me 
Let me out 
Let me out! 
Let me out!!! 

Suffer in your nakedness  
Before your dark art  
The filth and the stench of you 
I cry for you 
Is hell in itself 

Your reign is over now  
The sunlight will return  
To this once petrified earth  
Ego deicere tu pereant  


Make me faint with unending kisses  
My passions have all returned  
Warm my trembling hands  
We're scope for the tragedians  


I can see from your smile  
You're not here for the sunset
