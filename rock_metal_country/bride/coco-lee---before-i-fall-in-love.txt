My heart says we've got something real 
Can I trust the way I feel 
'Cause my heart's been fooled before 
Am I just seeing what I want to see 
Or, is it true, could you really be 

CHORUS:
Someone to have and hold 
With all my heart and soul 
I need to know, before I fall in love 
Someone who'll stay around 
Through all my ups and downs 
Please tell me now, 
before I fall in love 

I'm at the point of no return 
So afraid of getting burned 
But I want to take a chance 
Please, give me a reason to believe 
Say, that you're the one, 
that you'll always be 

REPEAT CHORUS 

It's been so hard for me to give my heart away. 
But I would give my everything, 
Just to have you say 

REPEAT CHORUS
