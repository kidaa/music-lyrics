It seems so hard to stay so positive
I know how it feels
It just takes time something's gotta give
Don't let the negative
Steal the blue out of the sky
Don't leave it all behind

This is life this is it
It's not everything you want
It's everything you get believe it
It's not worth leaving
Yea this is life once again
It's been knocking at your door
You ought to let it in
Don't waste it it's time you faced it

It seems like years
Since you've known happiness
So down so long
So calm your fears
And you'll get out of it
Just hang on

So this is life this is it
It's not everything you want
It's everything you get believe it
It's not worth leaving
Yea this is life once again
It's been knocking at your door
You ought to let it in
Don't waste it it's time you faced it

Why do you cry?
Why do you cry?
Steal the blue out of the sky
Don't leave it all behind

This is life once again
It's been knockin at you door
Don't waste it it's time you faced it
This is life this is it
It's not everything you want
It's everything you get believing
It's not worth leaving
Yea this is life once again
It's been knocking at your door
You ought to let it in don't waste it
It's time you faced it
This is life
This is life
Don't let it pass you by, pass you by
It's time you faced it
It's time you turned around and faced it
