Thanks to Julia James for submitting       
the lyrics

sitting with your eye shut tightly,
waiting for the time you must leave
surrounded by people that you'll never know
still you must go and transmit the sound
of what you have found and
leave everything that you knew behind

let's go, i know the son of X-51
and so, you'll know your time has only begun

can it be what you want it to be, can it be everything
can it be what you need it to be, begging you to believe

let's go, i know the son of X-51
and so, you'll know your time has only begun

watching with your arms wide open, thinking everyone should just stop
surrounded by people that you'll never need, a plan to deceive
is what we all need, and keep everything that you knew inside
