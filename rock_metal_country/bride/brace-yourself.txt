You want love
You fake love
You take it for granted
It slips through your fingers

You're frightened and scared of
Commitment resentment
Be honest it's alright
It's right here for your eyes
It goes fast shoots right past
The years fly pass you by
So grab it and shake it
Don't be scared to break it

Breathe don't hold your breath
You might be next so brace yourself
Live for today it's on its way
So brace yourself

Now reach down inside you
Be quiet with your truth
Have you lived through
Your demons inside you
Remember how you feel
It's fragile it's so real
You feel high you feel low
You don't know when you'll go

Breathe don't hold your breath
You might be next so brace yourself
Live for today it's on it's way
So brace yourself
So brace yourself
There's no one else
So brace yourself
There's no one else
Breathe don't hold your breath you might be next
So brace yourself
Live for today it's on it's way
So brace yourself
Live for today it's on it's way
So brace yourself

So brace yourself
So brace yourself
There's no one else
Live for today it's on it's way
So brace yourself
