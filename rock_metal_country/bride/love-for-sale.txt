the lyrics

Looking good, stepping out, looking for romance
Crazy arms, crazy legs, save me the last dance
Hold me tight, make me warm, give me shelter
Treat me right, in from the storm, helter skelter
You know the way, the game is tough
Need some motivation, to help you get it up

Cause it's only, love for sale, 
Heart of gold and hard as nails
I can't believe it's legal,
To send it through the mail
Only love for sale

Call me up, call me back, call me what you want to
Shoot your shot, shoot the moon, nothing that you can't do
All for me, one for all, shoulder to shoulder
Here and gone, sure like to ball, rock n' roller
You know the way, stuff goes around,
You need a half nelson, to help you get it down

Cause it's only, love for sale, 
Heart of gold and hard as nails
I can't believe it's legal,
To send it through the mail
Only love for sale

Rip it up, rip it out, Shake your money maker
Feels so good, in and out, real earth shaker
Get up close, stroke your bones, get a grip babe
Take a trip, take me home, feel the earth shift babe
You know the way, so get it right
You don't need an airplane, to get you through the night

Cause it's only, love for sale, 
Heart of gold and hard as nails
I can't believe it's legal,
To send it through the mail
Only love for sale
