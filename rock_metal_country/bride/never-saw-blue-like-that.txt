Today I took a walk up the street  
And picked a flower and climbed the hill  
Above the lake  

And secret thoughts were said aloud  
We watched the faces in the clouds  
Until the clouds had blown away  

And were we ever somewhere else  
You know, it's hard to say  

And I never saw blue like that before  
Across the sky  
Around the world  
You've given me all you have and more  
And no one else has ever shown me how  
To see the world the way I see it now  
Oh, I, I never saw blue like that  

I can't believe a month ago  
I was alone, I didn't know you  
I hadn't seen or heard you're name  
And even now, I'm so amazed  
It's like a dream, It's like a rainbow, it's like the rain  

And something's are the way they are  
And words just can't explain  

Cause I never saw blue like that before  
Across the sky  
Around the world  
You've given me all you have and more  
And no one else has ever shown me how  
To see the world the way I see it now  
Oh, I, I never saw blue like that before  

And it feels like now,  
And it feels always,  
And it feels like coming home  

I never saw blue like that before  
Across the sky  
Around the world  
You've given me all you have and more  
And no one else has ever shown me how  
To see the world the way I see it now  
Oh, I, I never saw blue like that before  

Oh, I, I never saw blue like that
