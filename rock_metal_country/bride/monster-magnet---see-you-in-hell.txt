A little room on 7th street is getting cold 
And secrets sing like mescaline 
They don't get old 
I saw a pattern on a blanket just the other day 
It looked just like the pillow you threw away 

You were like a zombie 
When you told me what you did that day 
And I drove out to the meadowlands 
To throw our baby away 
What time and snow couldn't bury 
Years of forgotten guilt 
That little body's calling, rising up 
From under a Jersey landfill 

I just woke up the other night 
And now I know what to do 
I just woke up the other night girl 
And now I know what to do 

I guess I'll see you in hell 

A creature's waitin' for a battle in the ancient swamp 
Your pissing on the pyramids 
Ain't gonna move things along 
So pack your scars and your makeup 
And give your money to the poor 
Cos you've been riding a twenty gauged ticket 
Into reality's door 

The TV's gone and you've been half an hour paid 
And your punkrock band still sucks anyway 
I was talking to Jesus through a hole in the floor 
He said our time is up, we can't stay anymore 
No more 

A little room on 7th street is getting cold 
And secrets sing like mescaline 
They don't get old 
I saw a pattern on a blanket just the other day 
It looked just like the pillow you threw away 


I just woke up the other night 
And now I know what to do 
I just woke up the other night girl 
And now I know what to do 

I guess I'll see you in hell
