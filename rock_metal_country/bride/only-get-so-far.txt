I remember our first goodbye
And the kiss in the doorway as you cried
To let you go it breaks my heart
You walked away

Cause you'll only get so far
You'll only get so far
Cause you'll only get so far without love
If you're lonely today
Well you're not far away
Cause you'll only get so far

I remember out next goodbye
And you cried and promised me your life
Loss of faith in those starry eyes
You walked away

Cause you'll only get so far
You'll only get so far
Cause you'll only get so far without love
If you're lonely today
Well you're not far away
Cause you'll only get so far

I'm tryin' to remember
Why I ever left at all
Need you to remind me
Cause you know where I belong

When these miles are too long
I can't wait to come home
I need you in my arms
Cause you'll only get so far

When these miles are too long
I can't wait to come home
I need you in my arms
Cause you'll only get so far
Cause you'll only get so far

Cause you'll only get so far without love
If you're lonely today
Well you're not far away
Cause you'll only get so far
Cause you'll only get so far
You'll only get so far

Cause you'll only get so far without love
If you're lonely today
Well you're not far away
Cause you'll only get so far
Without love
