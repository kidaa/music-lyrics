Yeah ummm... yeay. I've gotten close so many times 
Tryin to fit in I don't know why 
I had to leave behind a dream that could be mine 
I thought that I would never find 
Someone who's heart could read my mine 
Now I don't have to hide cuz you are in my life 

Chorus:
I promise you that love won't be easy 
I promise you there'll be times apart apart 
But I swear that it comes from my heart 
When I promise you're the only one for me 
for me.. yeah 

Sometimes I know it hard for you 
Wondering if we'll make it through 
But if you give me time 
I'll show you that you're mine, I promise you 

Repeat Chorus 

You showed me who I am, I know you understand 
You taught me how to just not be afraid of love 
I'm not afraid to look in your eyes 
I surrender to love I open to nothing you anything inside 

Repeat chorus x2
