I'm alive and I'm bleeding for everyone
pull me from this mire
hold me till I'm home
I believe in all of me
so I'll always live on
I have seen them
I have watched them all fall
I have been them
I have watched myself crawl
but I'm alive
and I'll be singing for everyone
did you see them
did you watch us all fall
did you save them
no you watched as we died
will you believe in me
because sometimes we never die
