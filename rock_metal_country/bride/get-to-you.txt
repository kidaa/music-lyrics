I've got a new dress
with large breasts
and I look funny
My beautiful boy
Who has brown eye
we both smell immensely
We live in our dreams
He lives with self
will open up
And now he bashes his head
Again and again
Oh my bed
Oh my knees
He's an odd boy
lucky boy
makes big noise
with big bottle
Lovely ugly cruel world repeat
I wear a nice blue hat
Just to keep in with awing of things
ugly, and it head to.......
