I thought that you would be loving me. 
I thought that you were the one who'd stay 
forever.
But now, forever's come and gone 
And I'm still here alone. 

You were only plying. 
You were only playing with my heart. 
I was never waiting. 
I was never waiting for the tears to start. 

{chorus}
It was you who put the clouds around me. 
It was you who made the tears fall down. 
It was you who broke my heart in pieces. 
It was you who made my blue eyes blue. 
Who Oh - Never should have trusted you. 

I thought that I'd be all you need. 
In your eyes, I thought I saw my heaven. 
And now my heaven's gone away 
And I'm out in the cold. 

You had me believing. 
You had me believing in a lie. 
Guess I couldn't see it. 
Guess I couldn't see it 'till I saw goodbye. 

{chorus}
