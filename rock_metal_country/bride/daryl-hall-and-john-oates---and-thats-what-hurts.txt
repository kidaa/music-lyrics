Never let nobody know me  
Never let nobody dare  
Never let somebody hold me  
Long enough for me to care...  
Till I found you  
Till I found you.  

Never let my guard down easy  
Never let myself let go  
I never knew the reason why  
I never let my feelings show  
Till I felt the pain  
Of loving you  

And that's what hurts  
When we say goodbye  
And that's what hurts  
On those sleepless nights  
There's nothing I can do  
Cos I'm lost inside of you  
And that's what hurts.  

I never let nobody touch me  
Never let nobody try  
I never let somebody move me  
Deep enough to make me cry  
Till I found you  
Till I found you  

I was strong and independent  
I Never needed anyone  
I thought I had it all together  
Until you came and proved me wrong  
Now I'm stronger with you  
In my life  

And that's what hurts  
When we say goodbye  
And that's what hurts  
On those sleepless nights  
There's nothing I can do  
Cos I'm lost inside of you  
And that's what hurts  
Yeah and that's the catch  
But the hearts not good at holding back  
It's a blessing and a curse  
And I don't know what's worse  
And that's what hurts.  

Sometimes I wanna run  
Sometimes I feel just like a fool  
Sometimes I'm even sorry baby  
That I felt in love with you.  
Oooh that's when it hurts  
It hurts so bad  
Ooh can't sleep at night  
Nothing I can do  
Cause I'm lost inside of you  
Oohhh 
It hurts oh it hurts  
Cause I'm lost inside of you  
I can't help myself  
I can't help myself  
Hurts without you baby  
You're not here, you're not here
