Every day see you walking by and I know you see me to
What's the deal are you really shy or do you think you really cool
Can't you see what I'm about do I have to spell it out?

You got me going crazy oh my
You got me going crazy day and night
You got me going crazy you just got to be mine
You got me so I'm ?bout to lose mind

All my friends say you really smart so how can I get throe to you
Get a clue come on have a heart and that will get you my heart to oh
Can't you see what I'm 'bout do I have to spell it out

You got me going...

Can't you see what I'm 'bout
All I know is you got to be mine
Do I have to spell it out?
I wanna be with you all the time

You got me going crazy...
You got me going crazy...
