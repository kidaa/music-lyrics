Where were you on our wedding day  
I got bad news that you went away  
Where were you on our wedding day  
You did me wrong now you must pay  
Whoa oh, give me back my ring, whoa oh  
Whoa oh, I ain't gonna let you keep a thing, whoa oh  
Where were you when I said "I do"  
Everybody laughed and my inlaws too  
Where were you when I turned around  
Some place you knew you never could be found  
Whoa oh, give me back my ring, whoa oh  
Whoa oh, I ain't gonna let you keep a thing, whoa oh  
Where were you when I searched the town  
And turned the whole neighborhood upside down  
Where were you, little girl I say  
Where were you on our wedding day  
Whoa oh, give me back a my ring, whoa oh  
Whoa oh, I ain't gonna let you keep a thing, whoa oh
