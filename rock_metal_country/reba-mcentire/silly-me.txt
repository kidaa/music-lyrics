Ben Weisman, Robert Etol
Funny how love comes and goes.
With the tears that fill my life does it show.
So listen to my heart beat once again.
Because of you I hope this feeling never ends.

Silly Me.
I fell in love again.
We started out as friends.
You'd think I would have learned from the hurt before.
Foolish me.
Should I have closed the door.
Promised, even swore
to never love this way.
Oh foolish me

They say that love's a chance you take.
You know I've had my share.
But when the nights get oh so cold,
I need you there. 
They say that love's a chance you take.
You know I've had my share. 
But when the nights get oh so cold I need you there.Repeat Chorus
