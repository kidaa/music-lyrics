Dave Loggins
He said please come to Boston
For the springtime
I'm stayin' here with some friends
And they've got lots of room
You can sell your paintings on the sidewalk
By a cafe where I hope to be workin' soon
Please come to Boston
I said no, boy would you come home to me

Chorus:
And I said, ramblin' boy
Why don't you settle down
Boston, Denver, L.A. ain't your kind of town
There ain't no gold
And there ain't nobody like me
I'm the number one fan 
Of the man from Tennessee

He said, please come to Denver
With the snowfall
We'll move up into the mountains
So far we can't be found
And throw I love you echos
Down the canyons
And then lie awake at night
Until they come back around
Please come to Denver
I just said no boy won't you come home to me

Repeat Chorus:Now that drifter's word
Goes round and round
And I doubt if it's ever gonna stop
But of all the dreams
He's lost or found
And all that I ain't got
He's still needs to lean to
Somebody he can sing to

He said please come to L.A.
To live forever
A California life alone
Is just too hard to build
I live in a house that
Looks out over the ocean
And there's some stars
That fell from the sky
Livin' up on the hill
Please come to L.A.
I just said no
Boy, won't you come home to me

Repeat Chorus

I'm the number one fan 
of the man from Tennessee
Tennessee
