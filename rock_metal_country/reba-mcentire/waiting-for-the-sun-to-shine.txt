Oh I've been standing underneath a dark cool cloud now
Waiting for the sun to shine
Waiting for the sun to shine on my heart again

Oh I've been standing underneath a dark cool cloud now
Waiting for the sun to shine
Waiting for the sun to shine on my heart again

Oh I've been throwing a lot of good love away now
Waiting for the sun to shine
Waiting for the sun to shine on my heart again

Oh I've been throwing a lot of good love away now
Waiting for the sun to shine
Waiting for the sun to shine on my heart againWaiting for the sun to shine
Waiting for the sun to shine on my heart again

Waiting for the sun to shine
Waiting for the sun to shine on my heart again

Oh I've been standing underneath a dark cool cloud now
Waiting for the sun to shine
Waiting for the sun to shine on my heart again

Oh I've been standing underneath a dark cool cloud now
Waiting for the sun to shine
Waiting for the sun to shine on my heart again
