Liz Heingber, Tommy Lee James
Thousands of people live in this town
And I had to run into him
When I saw him there on that busy street
Those feelings came back again
There was nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
He walked up to me, looked in my eyes

Chorus:
And still
The world stood still
I couldn't move
And all I could feel
Was this aching in my heart
Saying I loved him stillHe said how've you been
It's great to see you again
You're really a sight for sore eyes
I said, I can't complain
I'm doing fine
We talked as the people rushed by
We laughed about old times and all we went through
That's when he hugged me and said I've missed you

That's when she walked up to him
He said, this is my wife
I gave my best smile
But I was dying inside
He said we gotta go now
It's getting late
It was so good to see you
Then they walked away
