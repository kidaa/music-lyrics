Harlan Howard, Chick Rains
It sure gets quiet
When the kids go to bed
We sit here in the silence
Putting off what must be said
I read a book you watch TV
As our love dies quietly
I'm so sad I don't know what I just read

Chorus:
Somebody should leave
But which one should it be
You need the kids and they need me
Somebody should leave
But we hate to give in
We keep hoping somehow we might need each other again

You say goodnight and turn and face the wall
We lie here in the darkness and the tears start to fall
If it was only you and me goodbye might come more easily
But what about those babies down the hall

Repeat Chorus x2
