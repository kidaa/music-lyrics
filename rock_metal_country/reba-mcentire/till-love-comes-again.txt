Bog Regan,Ed Hill
White light shadows gather around my door
They find me dreaming all alone once more
Memories come around to haunt my sleepless sounds
Now's the time I must be strong
I believe it won't be long

Chorus:
Till love comes again
To end these lonely nights
Till love comes again
To drive these tears I cry
It's darkest just before the dawn
And I'll just keep holding on
Till then
Till love comes again

Somewhere someone feels the way I do
And like me they dream of the love that's true
One day I'll look into his eyes I know the moment's right
Until then I'll just wait
No matter how long it might take

Repeat Chorus

Oh until then
Till love comes again
