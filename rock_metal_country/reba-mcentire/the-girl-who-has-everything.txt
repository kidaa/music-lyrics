Dewayne Blackwell, Larry Bastian
I just got the wedding invitation.  
There's gonna be a celebration like you've never seen. 
Just fit for a queen.  
She's got her mom and daddy's blessing.  
She's got a long white wedding dress and his wedding ring. 

Oh  what can I bring.  
What do you give the girl who has everything.  
She's got the man who used to hold me.  
She's got the man who told me I was his everything.  
She's got the man who used to love me, 
who placed no one above me.  
How he made my heart sing.  
Oh what can I bring.  
What do you give
the  girl who has everything.  

She'll hear his promise of forever.  
She'll hear him say what I could never get him to say.  
Oh he'll say it today. 
She'll hold his hand and throw the flowers.  
Drink champagne till the morning hours.  
The queen has her king, and the world on a string.  

Repeat Chorus
