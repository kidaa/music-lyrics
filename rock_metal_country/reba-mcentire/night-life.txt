When the evenin' 
Sun goes down 
You can find me 
Hangin' around
Oh the night life 
Ain't no good life
But it's my life

Many people 
Just like me
Dreaming of 
Old used to be's 
Oh the night life
It ain't no good life
But it's my life

Oh listen to the blues they're playin'
Oh listen to what the blues are sayin'

Mine is just 
Another scheme
In a world
Of broken dreams
Oh the night life
It ain't no good life
But it's my life

Play me some blues boys

Oh listen to the blues they're playin' 
Oh listen to what the blues are sayin' 

When the evenin' 
Sun goes down 
You can find me
Hangin' around
Oh the night life 
It ain't no good life
But it's my life

The night life
Ain't no good life
But it's my life

Oh I love that song. You know I told you about the men 
who have influenced me in my music. 
Well now I want to tell you about the women. 
And there's lots of them. 
But this first one I wanna tell you about, 
I admired her for a long time .
First of all, it was because of her songwriting.
I liked the way she always told a story in her songs. 
And then in her singing. 
I always loved to listen to her sing.
She had a different style, a different quality about it. 
She's so  witty, so personable and you know 
no matter whether it's her singing,
her songwriting, or her acting,
I'll always be a big fan of Dolly Parton!
