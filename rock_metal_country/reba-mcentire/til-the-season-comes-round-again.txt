John barlow Jarvis, Randy Goodrum
Come and gather 'round at the table
In the spirit of family and friends
And we'll all join hands and remember this moment
'Til the season comes 'round again

So let us smile for the picture
And we'll hold it as long as we can
May it carry us through should we ever get lonely
'Til the season comes 'round again

Bridge:
One night, holy and bright
Shining with love from our hearts
By a warm fire let's life our hands high
And be thankful were here 'til this time next yearMay the new year be blessed with good tidings
'Til the next time I see you again
If we must say goodbye let the spirit go with you
'Til the season comes 'round again

Repeat Bridge

May this new year be blessed with good tidings
'Til the next time I see you again
We'll all join hands and remember this moment
And we'll love and we'll laugh in the time that we have
'Til the season comes 'round again
