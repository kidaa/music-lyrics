Robert Ellis Orrall, Cathy Majeski
I've got something to tell you that I just can't say
So I'm writing it down in case maybe someday
Our lives take a turn down a road
We can't see right now
I know you're happy and I'm happy for you
But since you found each other
I've been so confused 
Cause I believe there's one soul on this earth
That was meant for mine
I was sent here to find

Chorus:
What if it's you
What if our hearts were meant to be one
What'll I do
Knowing that I'll never love anyone
As much as I do love you
What if it's true
What if it's youIf destiny called and I missed my cue 
Do I get one more chance
Oh how I wish I knew
I'll never again put my heart in the hands of fate
If it's too late
If I ever hold you I'll never let go
But if I never do how will I know
