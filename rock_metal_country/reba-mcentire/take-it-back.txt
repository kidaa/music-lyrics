Kristy Jackson
You talked me into moving in and giving you my key
You said you'd be a mess now if it hadn't been for me
You said I stole your heart away by looking in your eyes
I wonder now how many times you sold that pack of lies

Chorus:
If this is how you act when you give your heart away
Well, take it back
Take it back

You told me I was everything you wanted and more
Then tell me what you're doing now sneaking out the back door
You're bringing home flowers and a bottle of Chablis
You forgot I don't drink wine I know that bottle's not for me

Repeat Chorus:

Oh, you must think I'm blind
And I don't smell your new cologne
You don't think I notice
All the nights I spend alone

Well, I'm not one for sitting 'round in some ole pity pool
You think you got a ticket and I must be some kind of fool
I hate to steal your thunder but your playing days are through
At least they are with me cause babe, I got no use for you

Tonight laying on the street
Babe, your bag is packed
So, take it back
