Arranged by Reba McEntireWhat's written in sentences and not verse at the beginning is what
Reba 
explains at the beginning, the rest is the song

On Christmas Eve in 1818
A blizzard stranded the tiny village of Ogledorf
Nestled in the Austrian mountains
That same day the people of St. Nicholas' church found their organ
broken
So the priest and organist began composing a song that could be sung
without 
an organ yet beautiful enough to express their Christmas joy
All day and all night long they worked
And at midnight the gentle carol Silent Night was born
The pure clear tones echoed through the hills
And the world has been captured by the beauty of that simple song ever
since.

Silent Night
Holy Night
All is calm
All is bright
Round yon virgin
Mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent Night
Holy Night
Shepeards pray at the sight
Glory streams from heaven afar
Heavenly ? sing hallelujah
Christ the Savior is born
Christ the Savior is born

Silent Night
Holy Night
All is calm
And all is bright
Round yon virgin 
Mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent Night
Holy Night
Sleep in heavenly peace
