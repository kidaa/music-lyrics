Sylvester Bradford, Al Lewis
You don't remember me
Oh but I remember you
Was not so long ago
You broke my heart in two

Chorus:
Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
Caused by you

If we could start anew
I wouldn't hesitate
I'd gladly take you back
And tempt the hand of fate

Repeat ChorusLove is not a gadget
Love is not a toy
When you find the one you love
You fill your heart with joy

Repeat Verse #2

Repeat Chorus x2

You, you, you...
