My world revolved around you
Every word was a promise I was hangin' on
Swept up inside a whirlwind
I just couldn't see the end till you were gone
I thought I would fall apart
With shattered dreams and a broken heart
Scramblin' in the dark

Chorus:
How was I to know
That I'd be OK
Thought I'd lose it all when you walked away
How was I to knowWhat I was so afraid of
Turned out to be my freedom in disguise
Now I know what I'm made of
Guess it just took some time to realize
I was blind I couldn't tell
Put too much faith in someone else
I gave up on myself
