Peter McCann
Sun goes down on a silky day
Quarter moon walking though the Milky Way
Oh you and me baby 
We could think of something to do

Chorus:
It's the right time of the night
The stars are waking above
It's the right time of the night for making love

No use talking when the shadows fall
Night bird's calling and he says it all
Oh you and me baby
We could think of something to do

Repeat Chorus

I got you and you got me 
Tell you that's the way my mama always said it should be
Oh I'll be good and you be kind
We'll be bad if you don't mind

Repeat Chorus 3 Times
