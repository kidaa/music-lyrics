What Do You Say

Michael Dulaney, Neil Thrasher

Stuck at a red light outside an adult bookstore
His son said, ";Daddy, what are all those X's for";
As the light turned green he changed the subject fast
He started talkin' 'bout football as they drove right past

CHORUS:
What do you say in a moment like this
When you can't find the words oh to tell it like it is
Just bite your tongue and let your heart lead the way
Let's get out of here oh what do you say

Seventeen years old she was out with her friends
They started drinken' at some party 'til she was three sheets to the
wind
Her momma always told her she can call no matter what
She was cryin' on the front steps when her mom showed up

Repeat Chorus

Sometimes you got to listen to the silence
And give yourself a little time to think

Her every breath is weaker than the last
And lately when she sleeps she talks about the past
Her husband knows she's tired of holding on
She looks at him and says I want to go home

What do you say in a moment like this
When you can't find the words to tell it like it is
Just close your eyes and let your heart lead the way
Oh what do you say
