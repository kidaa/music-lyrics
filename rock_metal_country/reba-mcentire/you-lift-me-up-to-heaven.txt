Been to Colorado where the mountains touch the sky
And I've done other things in life to lift my spirits high
But nothing that I've ever tried to do
Has taken me as high as loving you

Chorus:
Cause you lift me up, up, up, up to heaven
When you gently lay me down
You lift me up, up, up, up to heaven
Yes you make my world go round

I never try to get away on daydreams anymore
Love's taken me to places that I've never been before
But if it's not heaven when you're holding me
It's the way that heaven oughta be

Repeat Chorus

And we never leave the ground
Up, up, up, up to heaven
Yes you make my world go round
