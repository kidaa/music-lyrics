The kid down the street mowes the grass every week
The neighbor next door fixed the roof where it leaked
Job's going fine and the bills are all paid
And everyone thinks that I'm doing OK

There's a guy down at work
He's asked me out once or twice
I haven't said yes
But I'm thinking I might
And on my way home I thought I saw you walk by
If only I could get you out of my mind

Chorus:
What in the world am I gonna do about you
Oh your memory keeps coming back
From out of the blue
Oh well I try 
And I try
But I still can't believe that we're through
So tell me what in the world am I gonna do about you
What am I gonna do about youI went to the store
But it wasn't much fun
It doesn't take long when you're shopping for one
Standing in line I thought I saw you walk in
And that's when it started all over again

Repeat Chorus Darling what am I gonna do about you
