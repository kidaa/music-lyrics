Randy Sharp, Jeff Silbar
You don't have a clue
You're so far gone
He's got you dancin' to
A siren's song
I wouldn't wanna be you right now
I wouldn't wanna be
I wouldn't wanna be you right now
I wouldn't wanna be, I wouldn't wanna be

You're not the first he's drawn 
To his flame
He means to do you wrong
He has no shame
I wouldn't wanna be you right now
I wouldn't wanna be
I wouldn't wanna be you right now
I wouldn't wanna be, I wouldn't wanna be youIt's easy to understand
How you could fall so hard
You're not the only one
He's taken in and torn apart

Won't say I told you so
But I'm afraid it's true
You're about to go
What I went through
I wouldn't wanna be you right now
I wouldn't wanna be
I wouldn't wanna be you right now
I wouldn't wanna be, I wouldn't wanna be you
