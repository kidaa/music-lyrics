Set me free why don't you baby
Get out of my life why don't you baby
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
You don't really need me
But you keep me hangin' on

Why do you keep a comin' around
Playin' with my heart
Why don't you get out of my life
And let me make a new start
Let me get over you
The way you've gotten over me

Repeat Chorus

You say although we broke up
You still wanna be just friends
But how can we be friends
When seeing you only breaks my heart againYou claim you still care for me
But your heart and soul need to be free
Now that you got your freedom baby
You wanna still hold on to me
You don't want me for yourself
So let me find somebody else

Why don't you be a man about it
And set me free
You don't care a thing about me
You're just using me
So get out get out get out of my life
And let me sleep at night
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on

Keep me hangin' on

Keep me hangin' on
