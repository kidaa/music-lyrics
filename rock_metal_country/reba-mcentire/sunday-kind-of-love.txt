I want a Sunday Kind of Love. 
A love to last, past Saturday night.
I'd like to know it's more than love at first sight.
I want a Sunday Kind of Love. 

And I want a, a love that's on the square.
Can't seem to find somebody, someone to care.
And I'm on a lonely road that leads to nowhere.
I need a Sunday kind of love.

I do all my Sunday dreaming, and all my scheming. 
Every minute, every hour, every day 
And I'm hoping to discover a certain kind of 
lover Who will show me the way.And my arms need someone to enfold
To keep me warm when Monday's and Tuesday's grow
cold. And I need a love for all my life to have
and to hold.

I want a Sunday kind of love.
