Marc Beeson, Robert Byrne, Mike McGuire
Everyone I see these days still asks me about you. 
I guess they got so used to us together
they assume that everything's ok and then I have to say...

CHORUS
I wouldn't know. I haven't seen him. 
I couldn't say it's been awhile.
I haven't thought about him lately. 
So I wouldn't know.
I'm getting tired of people askin'. 
Why can't they just leave me alone. 
I couldn't care, I couldn't say, I wouldn't know.

I don't get out anymore to our old stompin' grounds. 
'Cause some old friend is bound to ask me
Why you're not around.
Well I just stay away so I don't have to say...

Repeat Chorus
