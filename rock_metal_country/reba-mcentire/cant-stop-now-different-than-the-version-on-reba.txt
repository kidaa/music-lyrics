Can't Stop Now different than the version on Reba Live

I can't say I didn't know what I was doing
I can't pretend things just got out of hand
I should of kept my distance
While I was still strong
But I got caught up in the feeling
Carrying along
But it's too late baby
I can't stop now

Well I walked right in with my eyes wide open
But I was blind when you told me you'd be mine
Just as soon as you were free
I should have slowed down
Before push came to shove
But I was already falling
Now too deep in love
And it's too late baby
I can't stop now

Chorus:
Can't stop now
Crazy heart running out of control
Can't stop now
I'll be falling apart somewhere down the road
I might be heading for a breakdown
But I can't stop now

Well I'm sitting here wondering
How I ever let myself fall
I keep hearing promises
But nothing seems to change it all
The love we made
Has got a life of it's own
It'll keep on going long after you're gone
Now it's too late baby
Can't stop now

Repeat Chorus

I might be heading for a breakdown 
But I can't stop now
I might be heading for a breakdown 
But I can't stop now
