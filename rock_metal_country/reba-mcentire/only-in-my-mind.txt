Reba McEntire
Oh on a park bench in the middle of July
We sat and watched the children play
If it was the heat or the noise
He didn't have too much to say

Then with a move of his eyes
A move that could have made the wind stand still
He took my hand in his and said the words
That I never will forgetChorus:
He said have you ever cheated on me
Has there been someone else
Is there someone you love more than me
Someone you can't forget
If his memory is opened again
Let it be chased away by time
He said have you ever cheated on me
I said only in my mind

How can I tell him
The time we spent together 
Was time between friends
There's just somethings I can talk about with you
That I can't just talk with him
How can I tell you
That somewhere in the cards it was meant for us to be
Why am I blushing in front of you now
Is it you or the heat
Repeat Chorus
