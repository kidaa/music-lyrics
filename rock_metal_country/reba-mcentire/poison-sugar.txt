Dennis Knutson, A.L. Doodle Owens
He's tall dark and dangerous
He's a love thief on the run
He's a moonlight bandit
Brother to the devil's son
He'll cover you with sweet talk
Tell you what you want to hear
Then he'll take your smiling face
And he'll cover it with tears

Oh they call him poison sugar
Cause there's poison in his kiss
Oh you ladies warn your daughters
About the stranger with the poison lips

His hands warm your body like the morning Georgia sun
You'll think you found forever in his arms before he's done
With honey dripping off his words
Your passion takes him home
His lying lips won't tell you
You'll be waking up alone

Repeat Chorus

You could find him on a dark street
You could meet him at the store
He could even wake you up
Knocking on your door
Well, I'm talking from experience
I'm a victim of his kiss
I'm just one of the many
He's loved and left like this

Repeat Chorus x3
