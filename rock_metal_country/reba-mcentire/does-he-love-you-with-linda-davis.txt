Sandy Knox, Billy Stritch
Reba:
I've known about you
For a while now
When he leaves me
He wears a smile now
As soon as he's away from me
In your arms is where he wants to be

Linda:
But you're the one he rushes home to
You're the one he gave his name to
I never see his face
In the early morning light
You have his mornings, his daytime, and sometimes I have his nights

Reba: 
But does he love you

Linda: 
Does he love you

Reba: 
Like he loves me

Linda: 
Like he loves me

Reba: 
Does he think of you

Linda: 
Does he think of you

Reba & Linda: 
When he's holding me

Reba: 
And does he whisper

Linda: 
Does he whisper

Reba & Linda: 
All his fantasies

Reba: 
Does he love you

Linda: 
Does he love you

Reba & Linda: 
Like he's been loving me

Linda:
But when he's with me
He says he needs me
And that he wants me
That he believes in me

Reba:
And when I'm in his arms
Oh he swears there's no one else
Is he deceiving me 
Or am I deceiving myself

Linda:
Am I deceiving myself

Repeat Chorus

Reba:
I should not lose my temper

Linda:
I should not be ashamed

Reba:
Cause I have eveything to lose

Linda:
And I, I have nothing to gain

Repeat Chorus

Reba:
Oh, does he love you
