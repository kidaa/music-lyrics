Reba McEntire, David Anthony, Leigh Reynolds
Chorus:
She's got what I don't
You there to lean on
I wish  I could get that off of my mind
But I don't know how
Cause she don't love you
Anything like I do
But that don't mean anything
She's the one loving you now

Well you're only bad crime
Was you used all the right lines
To make a girl like me
Feel like I was one of a kind

You had me believing
What I had you were needing
But I guess there was something missing
That you needed to find

Repeat ChorusWho says you need a reason
For getting up and leaving
Frustration sets in
Cause I know she holds you tight
I guess it's human nature
To want to find a reason
Cause one good reason would make me
Sleep a little better tonight

Repeat Chorus

Yeah that don't mean anything
Cause she's the one loving you now
