2,000 years ago, three wise men left their home
When an angel of the Lord
Said, ";Seek the Savior born";
Logic told them they were crazy
They shouldn't even try
The followed their hearts, they followed that star
This Christmas, let me be that wise

2,000 years ago, Mary left her home
An angel said, ";Have faith";
The Lord will light your way
The road was long and winding
But a promise had been made
From heaven above, that was enough
This Christmas, let me keep that faithThis Christmas, let this be the season
Of peace and love, joy and true believing
2,000 years ago, as everybody knows
A perfect baby lay
Asleep there in the hay
The world would not believe Him
But he loved them all so much
On that first night, He was the light
This Christmas, let me feel that love

Keep that faith, be that wise, feel that love
This Christmas
