Chuck Jones, Templeton ThompsonI guess I'm just one of those
Who believes there has to be a reason
For living and breathing
Every time you pull me close
Something tells me there'll be no more reaching
You're everything I'm needing
Oh, I don't know how it happened, I never thought I would
Find someone to complete me
Oh, I just can't explain it, this feeling that I get
Oh, ain't no way to name it, but I'm thinking baby

CHORUS:
Maybe it's the way you look at me
Like there'll never be another
I get swept away, baby when
We get so caught up in each other
I don't know where you end and I begin
Where you end and I begin

All it takes is just one kiss
I just wanna get lost in this emotion
Like the river and the ocean
Oh, when you wrap your arms around me, it happens every time
Time don't seem to matter
We'll always be together, I don't know what it is
That tells me it's forever
but I'm thinking baby

Repeat Chorus
