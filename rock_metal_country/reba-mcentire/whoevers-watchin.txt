I'm not wasting my time on earthly longing
Let that glory leave me be
I'm just tasting my life story
Just a page in history

Chorus:
Whoever's watching
Must be watching over me
Whoever's watching
Must be watching over me

Well I'm not hurting like I used to
I got lucky can't you see
Love came searching 
It could choose you
Love's the greatest victory

Repeat Chorus

I always look to the sky
And held my head high
Had to be what I had to be
Till the day that I die
Yes I wonder why
Somebody's watching
Watching over meRepeat Chorus First two lines

Well if you know me 
You know I've squandered
Everything that's dear to me
Still I stand here in total wonder
How it's all come back to me

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Chorus First two lines
