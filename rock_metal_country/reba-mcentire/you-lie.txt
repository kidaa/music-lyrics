Bobby Fischer/Charlie Black/Austin Roberts
We lie in the dark I know you're awake
The only sounds are the sounds this old house makes
But, Oh, how I long, I long to hear your voice]
Desperate to talk, yearning to touch
Burning inside 'cause I want you so much
So I say I need you and leave you no choice

Chorus:
You lie you don't want to hurt me
So you lie, buy a little time, and I go along
What else can I do, maybe it's wrong
But you know how much I love you
So you lie 'til you can find a way to say goodbye
You lieHow long until you just can't go on
And the urge to break loose is just too strong
You should let go that's what you want to do
Oh but you don't know, you don't know
If it's the right thing to do

Repeat Chorus & tag
