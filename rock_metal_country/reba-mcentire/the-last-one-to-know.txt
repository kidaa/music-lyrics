Matraca Berg, Jane Mariash
I didn't see the fire burn to ashes.  
I couldn't feel the winds of change.  
I was lost inside the passion, 
blinded by the memory of a flame. 
I guess I should've felt it when you touched me.  
I should've seen it in your eyes.  
But I believed you really loved me . 
Why can't I believe you've said  goodbye. 

Oh why is the last one to know 
the first one to cry and the
last to let go.  
Why is the one left behind 
the one left alone with no one to hold.  It would be easier to face the morning, 
if you were holding me tonight.
But you left me without a warning. 
Holding onto a heartache while she's
holding  you tight. 

Repeat Chorus
