Michael P. Heeney, Jackson Leap
Well I could swear
This king size bed
Keeps getting wider
And I could swear
A stranger's laying by my side
And I can swear a long dark valley lies between us
And there ain't no way to cross the great divide

Chorus:
The great divide
Ain't in Colorado
It's the distance that we've somehow grown apart
The great divide
Oh that river's sorrow
We can't rebuild 
The bridge we burned
Between our hearts

And Lord knows we both tried hard
At crossing rivers
But pride runs as deep
As it is wide
And the love that once could conquer any mountain
Has reached the edge of the great divideRepeat Chorus

The great divide
Ain't in Colorado
