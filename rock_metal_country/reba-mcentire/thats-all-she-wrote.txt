Joe Schemay, John Hobbs
Well it looks like you're alone again
I heard about your misery
She took you around the bend
And now you're coming back to me

Chorus:
That's all she wrote
Forget about her let her go
That's all she wrote
And I love to say I told you so

Think I know what happened late last night
I can tell by looking in your eyes
She spelled it out in black and white
And she left no room for compromise

Repeat ChorusI could see it from a mile away
But I don't wanna rub it in
All I want is just to hear you say
That you're ready, are you ready
To love me again

Repeat Chorus

We can put all behind us now
Let's pretend it never happened
We'll forget about the pain somehow
If you're ready, are you ready
To love me again

Repeat Chorus
