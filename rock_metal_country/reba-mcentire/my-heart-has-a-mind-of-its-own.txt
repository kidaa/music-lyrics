Howard Greenfield, Jack Keller
I told this heart of mine
Our love would never be
But then I hear a voice
And something stirs inside of me
Somehow I can't resist
The memory of your kiss
I guess my heart has a mind of its own

No matter what I do
No matter what I say
No matter how I try 
I just can't turn the other way
When I'm with someone new
I always think of you
I guess my heart has a mind of its ownYou're not in love with me
So why can't I forget
I'm just your used to be
It's wrong and yet
I know forgetting you
Would be a hopeless thing
For I'm a puppet
And I just can't seem to break the strings
I say I'll let you go
But then my heart says no
I guess my heart has a mind of its own

I guess my heart has a mind of its own
