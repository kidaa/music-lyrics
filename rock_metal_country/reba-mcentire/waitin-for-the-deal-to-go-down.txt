Bobby Fischer, Austin Roberts, Charlie Black
Oh, you've sold me you hold me
You've told me I'll be getting all your love
You can go wrong
If you hold on for so long
Just because you hate to give up
Do I love you ooh ooh I'm afraid I do
Do you love me, once upon a time
I was sure I knew

Chorus:
I don't like what I been thinkin'
If it's true, Oh you know I'm a fool
Face to face you promise me forever
But the ring's still sittin' in a store downtown
And I'm still sittin' here
Waitin' for the deal to go down

I get lonely and lonely is only
The hardest way to spend the night
Then you call me
You call me and stall me
And swear you're gonna make it right
So I hang on
Oh that's just the way things are
But the pay off I been waitin' for
Just might break my heartRepeat Chorus

Bridge:
Is there someone out there I don't know about
Convince me babe beyond the shadow of a doubt

I don't like what I been thinkin'
If it's true, Oh you know I'm a fool
Face to face you promise me forever
But the ring's still sittin' in a store downtown
And I'm still sittin' here
Waitin' for the deal to go down
Waitin' for the deal to go down
