Dolly Parton
Chorus:
Jolene, Jolene
Jolene, Jolene 
I'm beggin' of you
Please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene
Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him
Even though you can

Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin
And eyes of emerald green
He talks about you in his sleep 
There's nothing I can do to keep from cryin' 
When he calls your name Jolene

Repeat Chorus

Well you can have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me Jolene
I had to have this talk with you 
My happiness depends on you 
And whatever you decide to do Jolene

Repeat Chorus

Jolene 
Jolene
Jolene

Ya know I've met Dolly Parton,
 and I'm glad to say that we're pretty good friends. 
I've met Loretta Lynn and Tammy Wynette, Brenda Lee. 
A lot of people who have influenced me. 
Other folks like Merle Haggard George Jones and
Ray Price. It really upsets me cause I didn't get to meet a lot of the
people who did influence me, like I never got to meet Bob Wills 
and I never got to meet this next lady I'm gonna tell you about.
The only way I can tell you about her now,
is the way I learned about her the best is through her songs.
