Donny Kees/Shawna Harrington
What a surprise
Never thought I'd hear from you
Whatever made you call
From out of the blue
What did you say
I must be hearing things
Things that I never thought would come from you

Chorus:
Now you tell me
That you love me desperately
Why did you wait so long to say those words to me
Oh you made me crazy
I don't know what to do
Now you tell me
Not that's there's somebody newI think you should know
There's someone here with me
O bet he can tell you must be someone dear to me
So I better go
'Cause you still get to me
Just when I thought I was over you
This is all I need
