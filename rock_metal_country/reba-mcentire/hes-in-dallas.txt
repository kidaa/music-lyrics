Donny Kees, Richard Ross, Johnny MacRae
He said I'll make your dreams come true in Texas
And he captured my Appalachian heart
I was so naive that I believed him
When he promised we'd never be apart

So we packed and pulled a U-Haul down to Dallas
A year went by and the baby came along
Then his old friends and the night life came between us
Dreams turned into sleepless nights waiting all alone

Chorus:
I'm staring out the window through these teardrops
Holding on to the only dream that turned out right
We're on a Greyhound bus bound for West Virginia
He's in Dallas without us tonightOh, Lord I hate to break the news to mama
She's gettin on in years and worries so
Maybe I should have stayed in Dallas
And gave him another chance right now I just don't know

Repeat Chorus

He said I'll make your dreams come true in Texas
He's in Dallas without us tonight
