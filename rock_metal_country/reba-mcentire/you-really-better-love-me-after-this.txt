Bill Rice, Mary S. Rice
Your letter found me here in Denver
I've changed though since I've been here
I've learned there's more to life 
Than your promises

There's someone here
In Colorado
Who won't forget tomorrow
So you really better love me after this

On a bus somewhere in Kansas
Heading home to take my chances
Lord I hope this time you mean
The things you say

I won't say this is the last time
And let you play with my mind
But you really better love me after thisChorus:
Cause after all the pain we've been through
After all the chances we blew
Doesn't really mean that much to you
But you really better love me

As the bus pulls in the station
I can see you waiting
And I believe we both forget
What we can't forgive

Now we're holding to each other
I can feel my heart recover
And I know you'll gonna love me after this

Cause after all the pain we've been through
After all the chances we blew
I guess we really mean that much to you
Oh you're really gonna love you
Oh you're really gonna love me
Oh you're really gonna love me
