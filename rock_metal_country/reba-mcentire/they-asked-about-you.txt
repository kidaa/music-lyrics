Freddy Weller, Kim Nash, Bill Nash
Saturday night 
Out on the town
Feeling so sure of myself
Meeting some friends
Sharing some laughs
Not thinking of anything else
Then one of them leaned over my shoulder
And all at once the party was over

Chorus:
They asked about you
And suddenly it all came back to me
Then all the walls around my heart
Came crashing at my feet
When they asked about you
Oh They asked about you
I was doing OK
Until they asked about youHow could they know
What it would do
All they did was mention your name
And just like that
The hurting was back
That's when I knew nothing had changed
What a time for old memories to find me
Just when I thought I'd put 'em behind me

Repeat Chorus
