Wayland Holyfield, Dickey Lee
Chorus:
Well the blues don't care who's got 'em
Tears don't care where they fall
And you don't care my heart is breaking in two
No you and the blues don't care at all

Outside my window
It's raining
Somehow the rain seems right
Inside my lonely heart is aching
Oh how I miss you tonight

Repeat ChorusThe wind don't care where it's blowing
Rivers don't care where they flow
I don't know where I'm going
Cause you don't care anymore

Repeat Chorus

Oh darling you and the blues don't care at all
