Josh Leo, Rick Bowles
I set my mind to it. 
Said I wasn't gonna do it. 
No how. No sir. No way.
I wouldn't give my heart up. 
Gonna keep my guard up. 
And save it for another day.
Then you walked in with that crazy grin. 
And everything I swore before got lost in your eyes.
And flew right out the door.

CHORUS
Suddenly I heard love songs. 
Playing real soft on the jukebox. 
Somebody ordered up moonlight.
And painted stars all across the sky. 
Is it gravity or destiny. 
Either way there's nothing I can do. 
Looks like I picked the wrong night. 
Not to fall in love with you. 

I briefly resisted but my heart insisted. 
It was gonna be giving in. 
Hard as I was trying there was no denying.
Which one of us would win.  
You came up beside me and asked if I'd be wantin' to have dance. 
And right then I knew.This
thing was out of my hands.

Repeat CHORUS twice
