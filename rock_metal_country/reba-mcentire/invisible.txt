Lisa Drew, Christi Dannemiller
They met at a party. 
He was laughing with his friends. 
She captured all of his attention. 
Just by walkin' in. 
Confident and self-assured he liked her attitude. 
And the moment their eyes met. 
Every girl in the room became...

CHORUS
Invisible just out of view. 
Invisible. 
Like a pane of glass he could see right through. 
Invisible.

They married in October. 
She made a beautiful bride. 
His world revolved around her. 
They had a picture perfect life.
But when the baby came in August. 
Time started spinning like a wheel. 
She expected to feel tired. 
But she never thought she'd feel...

CHORUS'Cause lately he's been overlooking quite a lot. 
So tonight in lace and candlelight. 
She'll prove to him she's not...

CHORUS

A love deep inside. 
Invisible. 
So much more to her than meets the eye. 
Invisible.
