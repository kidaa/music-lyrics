S. Alan Taylor, Lisa Palas
  Yeah, yeah, yeah Hmmm hmm 
You know it seems like I've loved you forever. 
Who  could be closer than you and I. 
People even say we're so much alike,
But they don't know why I've been loving
you so  long that I know every move you make
,Every breath you take.
Lord I feel it so strong.
Sometimes I don't know where I end, 
and where you begin.
Oh you make me so happy,
feeling like this There's so much ahead 
that I don't want to miss Oh I want 
to keep it so good 
So, So, So Long So fine, So
real, So right, Oh I want to keep it so good 
So, So, So, Long Eh, yeah.

yeah Mmmm mmm Oh darling don't think for a minute
Time could ever steal the thrill away.
You've still got the power to be
my man And you know you can I've been loving you so
long. Repeat Chorus
