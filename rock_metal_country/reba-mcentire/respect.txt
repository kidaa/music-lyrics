What you want. 
Baby I got it.
What you need do you know.

All I'm asking is 

for a little respect when you come home
 Just a little bit Hey baby Just a little bit
When you get home.
Hey Mister I ain't gonna do you wrong while you're gone.
Ain't gonna do ya wrong cause I don't wanna.
All I'm asking is for a little respect when you get home

and all I'm asking in return honey 
is to give me my propers when you get home.
