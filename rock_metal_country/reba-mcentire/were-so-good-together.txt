How do two people like
To meet
I think about that
Was the timing just right
Was it that the night was so sweet
I think about that
Was it physical, chemical, what was the deal
Or did some kind of magic turn out to be real

CHORUS:
Might be how you kiss and hold me tight
When we're walkin', honey, underneath the moonlight
Might be how it keeps on getting better
We haven't even talked about forever
I just know that we're so good together
When did we cross that line
And just happen to find we're in love
I think about that
Was it you, was it me
Who could see we'd turn out to be us
I think about that
We could spend all our time trying to figure it out
And not be any closer than we are right nowRepeat Chorus x2
