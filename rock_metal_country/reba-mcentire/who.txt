Who
Oh who's gonna love you like I do
Who
And who you gonna find to do the things that I do
Before you say goodbye
Better think about it one more time

Tell me who
Who ever held you tighter
Who
Who you gonna find that can take you any higher
Before you put me down
Better stop and look around

And tell me who
Who who who who
You just might just find a match
That can kindle your desires
But what could is just one candle
When what you need is fireSo tell me who
Who who who who

Before I let you go
One thing I've got to know
Tell me who
Who gonna love you like I do
Who who who
Who you're gonna find that can do the things that I do
Who who who ..
