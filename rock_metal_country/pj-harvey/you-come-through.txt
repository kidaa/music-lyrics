We are waiting
For the summer
The sun will bring back
Treasures for us

Come on my friend
Drink to good times
Golden wishes
To your health and mine

You come through for me
You come true for me
You be well for me
You come through for me

I'll be lifted
On this our holiday
I'll take you my friend
I'll take you with me

Uou come through for me
You come true for me
You be well for me
You come through for me
