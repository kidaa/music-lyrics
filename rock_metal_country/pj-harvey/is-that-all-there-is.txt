Remember when i was a girl
Our house caught on fire
And i'll never forget the look on my father's face
As he gathered me in his arms
And raced to the burning building out on the pavement
And I stood there shivering
And watched the whole world go up in flames
And when it was all over
I said to myself
" Is that all there is to a fire ? "
Is that all there is?

Is that all there is?
If that's all there is, my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is

And when I was twelve years old
My daddy took me to the circus
The greatest show on earth
And there were clowns
And elephants
Dancing bears,
And a beautiful lady in pink tights flew high above our heads

And as I sat there watching
I had the feeling that something was missing
I don't know what
But when it was all over
I said to myself
" Is that all there is to the circus ? "

Is that all there is?
If that's all there is, my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is

And then I fell in love
With the most wonderful boy in the world
We'd take long walks down by the river
Or just sit for hours gazing into each other's eyes
We were so very much in love

And then one day
He went away
And i thought i'd die
But I didn't
And when I didn't 
I said to myself
" Is that all there is to love ? "

Is that all there is?
If that's all there is, my friends, then let's keep

I know what you must be saying to yourselves
If that's the way she feels about it
Then why doesn't she just end it all
Oh no. not me. i'm not ready for the final disappointment
'Cause I know just as well as i'm standing here talking to you
That when that final moment comes
And i'm breathing my last breath
I know what I'll be saying to myself
" Is that all there is ? "

Is that all there is?
If that's all there is, my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is
