Catherine De Barra, you've murdered my thinking
I gave you my heart, you left the thing stinking
I'd break from your spell if it weren't for my drinking
And the wind bites more bitter with each light of morning

I envy the road, the ground you tread under,
I envy the wind, your hair riding over,
I envy the pillow your head rests and slumbers,
I envy to murderous envy your lover

'Til the light shines on me
I damn to hell every second you breath

I envy the road, the ground you tread under,
I envy the wind, your hair riding over,
I envy the pillow your head rests and slumbers,
I envy to murderous envy your lover

'Til the light shines on me
I damn to hell every second you breath

Oh my
Catherine
For your eyes smiling
And your mouth singing
With time I'd have won you
With wile I'd have won you
For your mouth singing
