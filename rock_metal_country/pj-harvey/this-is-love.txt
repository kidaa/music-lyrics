I can't believe that life's so complex 
When I just want to sit here and watch you undress 
I can't believe that life's so complex 
When I just want to sit here and watch you undress 

This is love, this is love 
That I'm feeling 
This is love, this is love 
That I'm feeling 
This is love 
That I'm feeling 

Does it have to be a life full of dread 
I wanna chase you round the table, I wanna touch your head 
Does it have to be a life full of dread 
I wanna chase you round the table, I wanna touch your head 

This is love, this is love 
That I'm feeling 
This is love, this is love 
That I'm feeling 
This is love 
That I'm feeling 

I can't believe that the axis turns on suffering 
When you taste so good 
I can't believe that the axis turns on suffering 
When my head burns 

Love, love, love 
That I'm feeling 
This is love, this is love 
That I'm feeling 
This is love, love, love 
That I'm feeling 

Even in the summer 
Even in the spring 
You can never get too much of 
A wonderful thing 

You're the only story that I never told 
You're my dirty little secret, wanna keep you so 
You're the only story that  never been told 
You're my dirty little secret, wanna keep you so 

Come on out, come on over, help me forget 
Keep the walls from falling as they're tumbling in 
Come on out, come on over, help me forget 
Keep the walls from falling on me, tumbling in 
Keep the walls from falling as they're tumbling in 

This is love, this is love 
That I'm feeling 
This is love, this is love 
That I'm feeling 
This is love, this is love 
That I'm feeling 
This is love, love, love 
That I'm feeling
