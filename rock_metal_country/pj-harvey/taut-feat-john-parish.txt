Jesus save me
Jesus save me

Can I tell you something
Can I tell you a story
It's about me and Billy
Because I remember
I remember it all started when he bought that car
It was the first thing he ever owned, apart from me
And the colour was red
And the colour was red and he drove me
He drove me out of my mind
I am over it now
It was spring or summer 65, I don't remember
Steaming and sweating and sticking against the wheel
And I could see the tendons stand out in the back of his neck
And he used to make me pray, wearing a mask like a death's head
When he put me there in the back seat, and he said

Jesus save me
Jesus save me

Inherited his father's hate, that's what he'd say
And he's cussed enough to strip the pain off heaven's gate
But somehow
He could make joy come loose inside
I would feel really, I would feel really and truly alive
And I would do anything for him
He just wasn't enough
He was never enough 
He'd turn to me and say
He'd, he'd say "Even the son of god had to die, my darling"
And he'd wanted everything
He wanted everything
He wanted the honey from the king
He used to make me
He used to make me pay
Hidden in the backseat, such a, Jesus
He'd make me pray
He wanted everything
He wanted all that means from the king
Say it!
"Even the son of god had to die my darling"
"C'mon say it!"

Jesus save me
Jesus save me
