Can you hear them?
The helicopters?
I'm in New York
No need for words now
We sit in silence
You look me in the eye directly
You met me
I think it's Wednesday
The evening, the mess we're in

The city sun sets over me
The city sun sets over me

Night and day
I dream of
Making love to you now baby
Love making on screen
Impossible dream
And I have seen
The sunrise over the river
The freeway, reminding of
This mess we're in

The city sun sets over me
The city sun sets over me

What were you wanting?
I just want to say
Don't ever change
And thank you
I don't think we will meet again
I really must leave now
Before the sunrise
Above skyscrapers
The sin and
This mess we're in

The city sun sets over me
The city sun sets over me
