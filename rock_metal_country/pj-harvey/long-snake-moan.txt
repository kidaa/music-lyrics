Dunk you
Under
Deep salt
Water
Bring me
Lover
All your
Power

I'll be
No hell
Out of
Your spell
Over
Under

Drowning
Hell's no
God above
All drunk
On my love

You oughta hear my long snake moan!
You oughta see me from my moan!

Dunk you
Under
Deep salt
Water
In my
Dreaming
You'll be
Drowning
Raise me
Up lord
Call me
Lazarus
Hey lord
Hear me
Make me
My fill

You oughta hear my long snake moan!
You oughta see me from my moan!
