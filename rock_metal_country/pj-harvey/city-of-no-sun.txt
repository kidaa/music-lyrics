Love me tenderly my darling
In the city of light and truth
For this moment forever sing
For my darling that I love you

The City
 the city 
Of no sun
 of no sun 
No peace
 and no peace 
In my heart
 no joy in my heart 
You left me
 it's 
Nothing
 make me nothing 
You left me
 broken 
Broken
You love sell
 It's funny 
You love scream
 you said you loved me 
You love seal
 you love me 
You love me
 you love me 
You love me

Outside the fields
In sunlight
The singing breeze
And the silence

Lover
 lover 
 release me 
Release me
 I can't move 
I can't move
 I can't breathe 
I can't breathe
I can't grieve
 I can't hear nothing 
And no heart
 no heart 
No peace
 no peace 
No more nothing
 nothing 
A long day
 a long day 
A long night
 too long 
Until the
Love lies
Love lies
