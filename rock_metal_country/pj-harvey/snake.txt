You snake
You crawled between my legs
Said want it all
It's yours you bet
I'll make you 
Queen of everything
No need for god 
No need for him
Just take my hand 
You'll be my bride
Just take that fruit 
Put it inside
You snake 
You dog 
You fake 
You liar
I've burned my hands 
I'm in the fire
Oh

You salty dog 
You filthy liar
My heart it aches 
I'm in the fire
You snake 
I ain't untrue, believe
Put rotten fruit inside of me
Oh Adam please you must believe
That snake put it in front of me
That snake put it in front of me
In front of me
