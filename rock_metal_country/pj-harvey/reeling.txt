I wanna bathe in milk
Eat grapes
Robert DeNiro sit on my face
I can't sleep for thinking
Send my head a reeling

I wanna go to spain
Spend nights
Just sipping on nectar and ice
I can't sleep for thinking
Send my head a reeling

You bet that I'm Wayne 
Eliminate a whole race
Wanna make the shit hit the fan
I can't sleep for thinking
Send my head a reeling

Even Aphrodites
She's got nothing on me

Take me to the moon
Take me to the moon

Dye my hair on stage
Call on my man Romeo
Come and climb my braids
Reeling
Reeling

Even Aphrodites
She'll have nothing on me

Reeling
Reeling

Take me to the moon
Take me to the moon
Fly me to the moon
Take me to the moon

Reeling
Reeling
Reeling
Reeling
