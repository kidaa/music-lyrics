Take me over 
Pale blue water 
Take me under 
Take me home 

Darling be there 
Bring me laughter 
I'll be happy 
Ever more 

Bring me sunshine 
Bring me love 
No tomorrow 
He'll fall upon 

Darling be there 
Bring me laughter 
I'll be happy 
Ever more 

Darling be there 
Bring me laughter 
I'll be happy 
Ever more
