She lay 
Breathing 
Sunshine 
Between 
Time here 
Lingers 
Trace with 
My finger 
A circle 
A circle 
Round the sun 
The sun 
The sun 
The sun 

No more 
Laughter 
Since the 
Black come 
But head down 
Get high 
Up there's 
Blue sky 
And a circle 
A circle 
Around the sun 
The sun 
The sun 
The sun 

Time here 
Lingers 
Can trace with 
My fingers 
A circle 
A circle 
Around the sun 
The sun 
The sun 
The sun
