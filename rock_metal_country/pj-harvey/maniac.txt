I need a man 
To bring me love 
To make me sing 
I said I need a man 
To make me feel 
Like I'm a queen 
I said to take me to the god heights 
And kiss the devil on the mouth 

I need a man 
To make me moan 
To make me bad 
I need a man 
To drive me slow 
To drive me mad 
I said to take me to the god heights 
And kiss the devil on the mouth 
To leave me, oh no no no no 

I need a man 
His heart is stone 
His mother's bad 
I need a man 
His heart is stone 
The deepest black 
His heart is stone 
His mother's bad 
His heart is sick 
The deepest black
