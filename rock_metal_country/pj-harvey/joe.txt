Joe in you, my buddy be
Stay with me when I fall and die
Always thought you'd come rushing in
Clear the shit out of my eye

Joe in you, my buddy be
Lay my enemies out in lines
Come in close now I'll wash your feet
With my hair I'll mop them dry

With my hair I'll mop them dry
Something over there I do not like
There's no use in wondering

Joe you be my buddy please
In this hell and dead-locked time
When I'm trusting that head-ache tree
Cut me down with your silver knife

Cut me down with your silver knife
Something over there I do not like
There's no use in wondering
