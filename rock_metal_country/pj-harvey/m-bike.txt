His m-bike's clean
He polish that thing
He looks her over
More than me
But I won't let it
Get to me
Yeah he can play with
His machine

Night or day
Wind or shine
Looks at her shape
Not at mine
But I'm not complaining
No I think it's neat
Yeah he can play with
His machine

But all he's speaking
And all he sees
Is just his motor
Bike not me
I won't let it
Get to me
Can't stop thinking
His god damn machine

Motor
Motor
Motor
Motor

Take that lady
Coast to west
Ride his motor
Over the edge
Yeah I could break her
Break her, break me
But get rid of that
God damn machine

Yeah I could break her motor
Break her break me motor
But get rid of that motor
God damn machine motor
Yes I'm gonna break her motor
Think what you like motor
I fucking hate motor
His motorbike motor
