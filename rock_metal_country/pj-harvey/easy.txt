Oyster pearl 
You easy girls 
You're flapping in 
You're shouting 
You're dead good 
All the men say 
Legs wide, hips swinging like a doorway 

Easy 
Easy 
Easy 

I'm ranting 
I'm raving 
I'm taking in just everything 
You're giving me no leeway 
I opened once and you called me devil's gateway 

Easy 
Easy 
Easy 
Easy 

And I deserve it 
I asked for it 
Have to admit it 
We dress like targets 
Yeah I deserve it 
Give me no leeway 
I'll give you fine times 
You can call me devil's gateway 

Easy 
Easy 
Easy and I deserve it 
Easy and I deserve it
