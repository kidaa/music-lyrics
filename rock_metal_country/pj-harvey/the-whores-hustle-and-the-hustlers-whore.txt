Speak to me of
Universal laws
The whores hustle and the hustlers whore
All around me
People bleed
Speak to me
Your song of greed

Speak to me
Of you inner charm
Of how you'll keep me 
Safe from harm
I don't think so
I don't see 
Speak to me
Of your inner peace

Little people
At the amusement park
City people
In the dark
Speak to us
Send us a sign
Just give us something
To keep us trying

The whores hustle and the hustlers whore
Too many people out of love
The whores hustle and the hustlers whore
The city's ripped right to the core

Speak to me
Of heroin and speed
Genocide and suicide
Of syphilis and greed
Speak to me
The language of love
The language of violence
The language of the heart

This isn't the first time
I've asked for money or love
Heaven and earth 
Don't ever mean enough
Speak to me 
Of heroin and speed
Just give me something
I can believe

The whores hustle and the hustlers whore
Too many people out of love
The whores hustle and the hustlers whore
The city's ripped right to the core
