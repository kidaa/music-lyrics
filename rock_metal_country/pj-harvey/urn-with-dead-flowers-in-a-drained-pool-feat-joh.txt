I need your light
Darling love lies
And if you gave it to me
I'd hold it in the palm of my hand
Like a good luck charm or a vice
And I'll reach up like a child to receive it

There is no more sad
There is no more leave
I've got sun on my back
I'm in love again

Take me inside 
Your war love light
And if he took me
I'd hold him up to the light
Like a god, or a good luck charm, or a vice
And I'd open up like a child to believe it

There is no more sad
There is no more leave
I've got sun on my back
I'm in love again

But still you can't give your peace to me
