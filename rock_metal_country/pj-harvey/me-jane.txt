Damn your chest-beating just you stop your screaming
Splitting through my head and swinging from the ceiling
Move it over Tarzan can't you see I'm bleeding
I've called you by your first name good lord it's me-Jane

I'm running
It's me here
I'm leaving
Me-Jane
Me-Jane

Damn your chest-beating just you stop your screaming
All the time you're hunting swimming fishing breathing
Don't you ever stop and give me time to breathe in
I've called you by your first name good lord it's me-Jane

I'm running
It's me here
And I'm leaving
Me-Jane
And I'm trying
To make sense
You're screaming

Don't put it on me
Don't put it on me
Don't put it over me

Tarzan I'm pleading stop your fucking screaming
You've got me nailing walls and hanging from the ceiling
Oh move it over Tarzan can't you see I'm bleeding
Good lord you never stop

Don't put it on me
Don't put it on me
Don't put it on me
Don't put it on me
Jane
