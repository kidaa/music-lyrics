Losing ground 
Under my feet 
There's a low rumbling 
There's a crack in the street 
It's just no good 
It's just no good anymore 
Everything I do 
Has been done before 

Yeah I found my voice 
Yeah I got nothing to say 
The whole thing started 
Cause my mind has gone away 
I used to get high 
Now I just get lost 
I used to bark at the moon 
The first one I came across 

Almost here 
Almost gone 

Almost here 
Almost gone 
Almost where 
We belong 

Better watch where you step 
Better watch what you say 
Speak the truth, baby 
Believe in what you say 
Believe in what you say 
It's just no good anymore 
It's just no good anymore 

You bet I got trouble baby 
You bet I got trouble baby 
You bet I got trouble baby 
You bet I got trouble baby
