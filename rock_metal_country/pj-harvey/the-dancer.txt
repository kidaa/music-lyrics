He came riding fast like a phoenix out of fire flames
He came dressed in black with a cross bearing my name
He came bathed in light and the splendour and glory
I can't believe what the lord has finally sent me

He said dance for me, fanciulla gentil
He said laugh a while, I can make your heart feel
He said fly with me, touch the face of the true god
And then cry with joy at the depth of my love

Cause I've prayed days, I've prayed nights
For the lord just to send me home some sign
I've looked long, I've looked far
To bring peace to my black and empty heart

My love will stay till the riverbed run dry
And my love lasts long as the sunshine blue sky
I love him longer as each damn day goes
The man is gone and heaven only knows

Cause I've cried days, I've cried nights
For the lord just to send me up some sign
Is he near? Is he far?
Bring peace to my black and empty heart

So long day, so long night
Good lord, be near me tonight
Is he near? Is he far?
Bring peace to my black and empty heart
