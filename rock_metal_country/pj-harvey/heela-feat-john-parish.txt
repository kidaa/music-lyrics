I was lost in love
I was lost inside
Till he said to me
You've gotta lovely smile

Now I'm saved
Saved
Now I'm saved
Now I'm saved

Heal me with his hands
Heal with his heart
When he said to me
No no, we'd never part

Heal me with his hands
Heal with his heart
When he said to me
No no, we'd never part

Oh she feel as though she hit upon paradise
She was a hoola girl, she got her hair done nice
She said "I've given all I got to my healer man
He put his hands on me, showed me what I am"

And I'm saved

When I got my healer by my side
And I'm pushing daylight, pushing night
When I got the healer by my side
And I'm pushing daylight, pushing night
