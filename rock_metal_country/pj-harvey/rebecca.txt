I'm walking slowly, about the sea 
Lover by lover, I pass them on the beach 
The sun is shining, so bright today 
Your voice is singing to me, across the waves 

Ah 

There's a young boy, makes eyes at me 
Does he mouth my name, or is this just a dream? 
I know inside that I can really love 
The waves are glistening, like heaven from above 

And here we'll stay 
And sing forever of peace 
I know we found love here by the sea 

Could this be heaven, could this be peace 
No more than sunshine and sand and waters deep 
I'd always dreamed that life could be like this 
Forever high and sigh from kiss to kiss 

I know I've found love here by the sea
