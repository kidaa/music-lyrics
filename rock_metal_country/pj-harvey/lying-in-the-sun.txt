I'm lying in the sun 
I'm lying with my love 
Into his blackened hair 
I swear I saw dove 

He is the one like god 
Comes clear before my eyes 
I'm kneeling on the ground 
My love it tastes like wine 

Come on and step inside 
Come on and step inside 

I'm lying in the sun 
I'm lying with my love 
Into his blackened hair 
I swear I saw a dove
