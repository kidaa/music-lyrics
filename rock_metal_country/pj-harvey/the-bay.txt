The dead man came calling 
My name and in need 
Said "Betty, you're my girl 
The strongest I've seen" 

But oh my heart 
Is heading to break 
They say God forgives 
But I can't learn the same 

Said Betty she's fine 
And Betty she's torn 
And Betty makes love 
Like woman at all 

But oh my heart 
Is heading to break 
They say God forgives 
But I can't learn the same 

So I gave him my time 
And I gave him my peace 
And I gave him my heart 
Gave it to keep 

But oh my eyes 
Making fools out of me 
They say love is blindness They say God forgives 
I could no longer see But I can't learn the same 

Now I've no more to give 
And I've no more to say 
And the stars shine less bright now 
Over this dead man's bay 

But oh my heart 
Is heading to break 
They say God forgives 
Is this love in the grave? 
They say God forgives 
Is this love in the grave?
