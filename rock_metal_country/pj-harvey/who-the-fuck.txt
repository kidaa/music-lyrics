Who the fuck do you think you are
Get out of my hair
who the fuck do you think you are
Comin' round here
who the fuck who the fuck
who the fuck do you think you are

Get your comb out of there
Coming out my hair

I'm not like other girls
You can't straighten my curls
I'm not like other girls
You can't straighten my curls
No!

Who the fuck you tryin' to be
Get your dog away from me!
What the fuck you doing in there
Get your dirty fingers out of my hair

Who who who who
Fuck fuck fuck you

I'm free, you'll see
I'm me, you'll see

Who who who who
