Daddy
Hold me 
It seems so very dark tonight 
And day 

Daddy 
I can't sleep 
Need you to come and sing to me 

That the stars 
Up in the sky 
Will shine down gently on the two of us tonight 
And soon enough Daddy 
It will be light Baby 
We'll hold on tightly to each other, you and I 
And I won't cry 

Oh Daddy 
Your baby 
Is weak and calling out your name 

My Daddy 
Oh don't leave me 
I beg you sing your song again 

That the stars 
Up in the sky 
Will shine down gently on the two of us tonight 
And soon enough Daddy 
It will be light Baby 
We'll hold on tightly to each other, you and I 
And I won't cry Baby 
Or call your name 
And I won't 
And I won't 
And I won't 
And I won't
