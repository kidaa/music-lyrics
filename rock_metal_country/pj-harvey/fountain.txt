Stand under 
Fountain
Cool skin, 
Washed clean
Wash him from me

Along comes the wind
A big bone shaker
Blows off my clothes
Completely naked
What to do
When everything's
Left you

Out of the blue
It is he
Vision to me
Bearing leaves
Petals green
Covers me
In all my shame

Hand in hand
He's my big man
Stays with me
Some forty days
No words
Then goes away
I cry again

On my hill I wait for wind
And on my hill I wait for wind
