Hey I'm one big queen 
No one can stop me
Red light red green
Sat back, I'm watching
I'm number one 
Second to no one
No sweat I'm clean 
Nothing can touch me

I'll tell you my name 
F U C K
50ft queenie
Force ten hurricane
Biggest woman 
I could have ten sons
Ten gods 
Ten queens
Ten foot and rising

Hey I'm the king of the world
You ought to hear my song
You come on measure me
I'm twenty inches long

Glory glory 
Lay it all on me
50ft queenie 
50 and rising
You bend over 
Cassanova
No sweat I'm clean
Nothing can touch me

Hey I'm the king of the world
You ought to hear my song
You come on measure me
I'm twenty inches long

Hey I'm king of the world
You ought to hear my song
You come on measure me
I'm thirty inches long

Hey I'm king of the world
You ought to hear my song
You come on measure me
I'm forty inches long

Hey I'm king of the world
You ought to hear my song
You come on measure me
I'm fifty inches long

50ft queenie
