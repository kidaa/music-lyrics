Oh you're divine
Oh you're divine
Oh did I tell you you're divine
Oh did I ever when you were alive
Did it hurt when you bled
Oh lover boy, oh fever head
I'll bet you never thought I'd try
Your mouth, my love, was open wide
Singing oh you were going to be my life
Damn it
Oh you were going to be my life

Did you sing 'happy day'
Sing it
Sing it that time I went away
Got to ease my aching head
D'you know
No other way cut off your legs oh
Hey oh

Did you ever wish me dead
Oh lover boy, oh fever head
No you must no you must not go away
How will you ever walk again
And I, I might as well be dead
But I could kill you instead
