You think you'll come over
I gave you my number
You lover, supporter
Then give me a mother
You come take me home and
Take me to your doctor
You think you'll come over?

I think I'm a mother

Roll over, roll over
And roll me a man-a
You lover, my lover
You just roll me over
You give me a mother
A man if I love her
I love her, I'll keep her
I'll let her just keep her

Come on and support her
I said to the mother
She said you come over
She said she's a boulder
I love her, I kept her
And then she just left and
Alone, I implore ya

I think I'm a mother
Mother
More than ever
Need you mother
