In the forest, is a monster 
It has done terrible things 
So in the wood, it's hiding 
And this is the song it sings 

Who will love me now? 
Who will ever love me? 
Who will say to me 
"You are my desire, I set you free?" 

Who will love me now? 

Who will forgive and make me live again? 
Who will bring me back to the world again? 

In the forest, is a monster 
And it looks so very much like me 
Will someone hear me singing? 
Please save me, please rescue me 

Who will love me now? 
Who will ever love me? 
Who will say to me 
"You are my desire, I set you free?" 

Who will love me now? 
Who will ever love me? 
Who will say to me 
"You are my desire, I set you free?" 

Who will love me now? 
Who will ever love me? 

Who will love me now? 
Who will ever love me? 
Who will love me now? 
Who will ever love me? 
Who will love me now? 
Who will ever love me?
