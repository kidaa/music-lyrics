In the night I look for love 
Get my strength from the man above 
God of piston, god of steel 
God is here behind the wheel 

I'm just working 
For the man 

Pretty things get in my car 
Take them flying, it's not far 
Take in handsome, take in me 
Look good in my steel machine 

I'm just working 
For the man 

Don't you know yet who I am? 
Working harder for the man 
Go around I'm doing good 
Get my strength from the man above 

I'm just working 
For the man 

I'm just doing 
What I can 

Go around I'm doing good 
Go around I'm doing good
