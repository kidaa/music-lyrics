And I remember everything
Sunrise on a blue horizon
You, your hand in mine
I remember the things you said

Said, "i'll be a lady, wait through it all,
Be there to catch you, after the fall
Run through the red light, out of my hair
Run from the darkness into the dare

And i dream of running
And in the dream I, myself could run
And i feel the ground beneath my feet
And i move like music, 
You move me, like music

Head out of my way
Head out to red light
"Hold on" the dream says
Head out of my life
You said "I'd be there"

Now i'm treading very carefully
And I hope that I don't scream
And I hope that I don't fall
Off your bridge, crossing over
Sunny mountain, swollen riverfall

You said "I'd be there"
You said "I'd be there"
Through it all

Head out of my way
Head of to red light
"Hold on" the dream says
Head out of my life

All over my way
Head out to red light
"Hold on" the dream says
Head out of my life
You said "I'd be there"
