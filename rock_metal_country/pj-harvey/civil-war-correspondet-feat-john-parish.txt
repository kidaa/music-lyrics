Words leave my heart dry
Words can't save life
Love has no place here
No joy, no tears

Darling, time's changed
Time leaves, time fades
Please see through my eyes
Save your tears for the next who dies

I shout but he don't hear
I put down on a page
Darling spare me your tears
Just send me the light of day

I shout but he don't hear
Just put down on the page
Darling spare me your tears
Dear God, please send me the light of day

I can feel his heart wired
Heart like gunfire
Gunfire
Gunfire
Gunfire
