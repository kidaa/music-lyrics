Love me tenderly my darling
In the city of light and truth
For this moment forever sing
For my darling that I love you

The city of no sun city of no sun
No peace no peace
In my heart no joy in my heart
You left me nothing with nothing
You left me broken broken
Once sad sad
Once greed greed
Once said he loved me
He loved me he loved me
He loved me

Outside the fields
In sunlight
The singing breeze
And the silence

Lover release me lover release me
I can't move I can't breathe I can't move I can't breathe
No heart, no peace no heart, no peace
No more nothing nothing, peace, love me
Long day, long night long day, long night
Too long, love lies too long, love lies
Love lies
