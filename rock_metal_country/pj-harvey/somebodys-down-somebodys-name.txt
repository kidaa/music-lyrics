Somebody's down, somebody's name 
Saw it all happen, take place 
At my window, I was looking down 
I had no time, just time to say 
Hold on, I'm coming 
And he was lying there, it's all just too late 

Somebody's down, somebody's name 
Saw a fall and it all take place 
At my window, I was looking down 
See people, you can't be safe 
Hold on, I'm coming 
It's moved on now, and it all passed, and it's all too late 

Somebody's down, somebody's name 
Saw it all with my own eyes 
Saw it all as clear as day 
Clear as blue, blue fucking daylight 
I say 

Hold on 
I'm coming 
Somebody's down, somebody's name 
Somebody's down, somebody's name 
Hold 
On 
No 
More 
Hold on 
No more 
Hold on, I'm coming 
Don't you tell me it's too late 

Somebody's down, somebody's name 
Pushing up daisies out of the ground 
Thought I heard him call her name 
By the time he hit the ground 
Another day, another town 
Another body on the ground 
By the time the sky was grey 
Nobody down, nobody came 
I said 
Oh lord 
No more 
Oh lord 
No more 
Oh lord 
I'm coming 
Don't you tell me it's too late
