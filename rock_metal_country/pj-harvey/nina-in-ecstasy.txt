I'm Nina 
I feel love 
I'll be safe 
I'll be yours 
Ever more 
I'll be safe 

Mama 

Once Nina 
Was a young girl 
Now she's dead 
Grew older 
Grew colder and 
Lost her way 

Mama 

Where's your mama gone? 
Where's your mama gone? 
Where's your mama gone? 
Where's Your mama gone? 
Far, far away 
Far, far away
