And they came to the river
And they came from the road
And he wanted the sun
Just to call his own
And they walked on the dirt
And they walked from the road
Till they came up close

Throw your pain in the river
To be washed away slow

And we walked without words
And we walked with our lives
Two silent birds
Circled by

Like our pain in the river

And we followed the river
And we followed the road
And we walked through this land
And we called it a home
But he wanted the sun
And I wanted the whole
And the white light scatters
And the sun sets low

Like the pain in the river
