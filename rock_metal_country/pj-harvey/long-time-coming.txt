In my coat of many colours 
I'm waiting for my child 
I'm waiting for my journey 
I'm waiting for my prize 

My lord 
My lord 

Jesus coming running 
Ah sweet Jesus run and hide 
Yeah I'm on my way to heaven 
Ah sweet Jesus come inside 

My lord 
Long time coming 

If I could call my mother 
Say mother dry my eyes 
If he'd left me in these colours 
Then he ain't no god of mine 

My lord 
Long time coming
