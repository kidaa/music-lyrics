Put the pen
To the paper
Press the envelope
With my scent
Can't you see
In my handwriting
The curve of my g?
The longing
Oh

Who is left
That writes these days?
But you and me
We'll be different
Take the cap
Off your pen
Wet the envelope
Lick and lick it
Oh

I need you
The time is running out
Oh baby
Can't you hear me call?

It turns me on
To imagine
Your blue eyes
On my words
Your beautiful pen
Take the cap off
Give me a sign
I'd come running

Oh
It's you
I want you
