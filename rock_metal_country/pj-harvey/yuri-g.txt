Hey there Luna I'd like to tell you 
How sad am I so love sick I could die 
Needing water my neck's stiff my head hurts 
Been looking up all night been looking up the Moon she's so bright 
She's so white she's so clean 
I'm telling you she's everything 
I'd give it all my sorry eyes 
Give just everything she's got me so mesmerized 

Yeah I wish I was Yuri-G 
It's just the things that she does to me 
Yeah I wish I was Yuri-G 
Bring back my memory 

Told by the doctor to make a figure 
Needles stick in her, she'll be your luna 
I stuck them in real clean 
I stuck them in a mile 
I drew her down on me 
I drew her with a smile 
I'd give it all you see 
I'd give my sorry eyes 
I'd give just everything she's got me so mesmerized 

Yeah I wish I was Yuri-G 
It's just the things that she does to me 
Yeah I thought I was Yuri-G 
Bring back my memory 

I stuck them in real clean 
I stuck them in a mile 
I drew her down on me 
I drew her with a smile 
I'd give it all you see 
I'd give my sorry eyes 
I'd give just everything she's got me so mesmerized 

Yeah I wish I was Yuri-G 
It's just the things that she does to me 
Yeah I thought I was Yuri-G 
Bring back my memory 

Yeah I wish I was Yuri-G 
I'd let her walk all over me 
Yeah I thought I was Yuri-G 
Bring back my memory
