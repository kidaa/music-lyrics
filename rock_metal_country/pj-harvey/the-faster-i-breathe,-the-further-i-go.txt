I'm walking outside and 
The headlights are blinding 
I'm walking on Bleaker 
The street of no cheer 
The yellow cabs driving 
I'm taking a ride and 
The panic, the laughter, the stink of disaster 

Disaster 
Disaster 
Disaster 
The faster 
The faster 
I'm breathing 
The further 
I'm sinking 
My head aches 
My mouth dry 
It feels like 
It's war time 
The heat and 
The traffic 
There's hell on 
This planet 
It's spinning 
Much faster 
Disaster 
Disaster 

Disaster 
Disaster 
I'm breathing 
I'm breathing 
I'm breathing 
I'm breathing 

Let's walk now 
On side roads 
Let's walk in 
The shadows 
There's lovers 
They're kissing 
I see something missing 
He's ready 
To take her 
I don't even 
Rate her 
Loving and loving 
I hear 
The flies buzzing 

Faster 
Faster 
Faster 
Faster 
I'm breathing 
I'm breathing 
I'm breathing 
I'm breathing 

Keep walking 
Keep walking
