Here I am
Prairieland
Got it all, got
Gun in hand
Here I sleep
Dungarees
They're on my husband
Put 'em on me

We have the stars
We have the trees
We'll have everything
We need to feed

I'll make babes
He'll make chairs
We'll sell them at
The county fair
We'll walk on
We'll walk tall
We'll dance once a week
The union hall

We'll have the stars
We'll have the trees
We'll have everything
We need to feed

Here I am
Prairieland
I got it all, got
Gun in hand
I'll sweep the porch
I dust his room
We'll sleep together
On our chair at noon

We have the stars
We have the trees
We have everything
We need to feed

We have the stars
We have the trees
We have everything
We need to feed
