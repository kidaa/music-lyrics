In photographs 
I've seen him laugh 
Man overboard 
Sun on his back 

Summer was here 
I remember it well 
How he stood in the shade 
How we both kissed and fell 

How can this be? 
There's nothing left here 
How can this be? 
There's nothing left here 

So sad our 
So sad our 
So sad our 
So sad our 
Our memory 

Now he talks in his sleep 
Says I've never known peace 
And I don't know him now 
He's a stranger to me 

How can this be? 
There's nothing left here 
How can this be? 
There's nothing left here 

We were 
Never more than a dream 
Brief as 
Summer or spring 
Sweeter than anything
