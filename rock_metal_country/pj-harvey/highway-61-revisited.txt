Well, God said to Abraham "Kill me a son" 
Abe said "Man, you must be putting me on" 
God said "No" 
Abe said "What?" 
God said "You do what you wanna, but 
Next time you see me coming you better run" 
Abe said "Where do you want this killing done" 
God said "Out on that Highway 61" 

Well, Georgia Sam he had bloody nose 
Welfare department would give him no clothes 
He asked poor Howard "Where can I go" 
Howard said "There's only one place I know" 
Sam said "Quick man, tell me, I got to run" 
Howard just pointed with his gun 
And said "That way down on 61" 

"Well, Mack the finger" said Louie the king 
"I got 40 red white and blue shoestrings 
And a thousand telephones that won't ring 
You know I can't get rid of these things" 
And he said "Now let me think a minute son" 
Said "Yes that can be easily done 
Just take them down on that 61" 

That highway 
Highway 
Highway 
Highway 
Highway 

Now the fifth daughter on the twelve night 
Told first father that things weren't right 
"My complexion" she said "is much to white" 
He said "Come here and stare up into the light" 
And said "Mmmm you're right, let me tell the second mother it's been done" 
But the second mother with the seventh son 
They were out on that highway 61 

Now, the roving gambler was very bored 
Trying to create the next world war 
And he found a promoter, fell off the floor 
And said "I've never engaged in this kind of thing before 
But yep I think it can be easily done" 
Highway 
They just put some bleachers there out in the sun 
And have it out on that 61
