I was blind I was lame
I was nothing till you came
You said babe make you sing
Make you feel like some queen
Said I'll take you Kathleen
To your home and mine
Lord he hooked me
Fish hook and line

And rolled in, barking mad
With a halo of deep black
Til my love made me gag
Called him Daddy take my hand
Said I'll take you Kathleen
To your home and mine
Good lord he hooked me
Fish hook and line

I'm lying and I'm lame
Left with nothing, but distain
Daddy, your maid, she can't sing
She can't feel, she's no queen
Said I'll take you Kathleen
To your home and mine
Lord he hooked me
Fish hook and line
Said I'll take you Kathleen
To your home and mine
Good lord he hooked me
Clean out of time
