I was born in the desert 
I been down for years 
Jesus, come closer 
I think my time is near 
And I've travelled over 
Dry earth and floods 
Hell and high water 
To bring you my love 

Climbed over mountains 
Travelled the sea 
Cast down off heaven 
Cast down on my knees 
I've lain with the devil 
Cursed god above 
Forsaken heaven 

To bring you my love 
To bring you my love 
To bring you my love 
To bring you my love 

I know he's gonna be here 
You know he's gonna be here 
Yeah alright 

Forsaking heaven 
Curse god above 
Lay with the devil 
Bring you my love 

To bring you my love 
To bring you my love 
To bring you my love
