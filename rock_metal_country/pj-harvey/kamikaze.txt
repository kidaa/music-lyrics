How could that happen?
How could that happen again?
Where the fuck was I looking
When all his horses came in?
And he built an army
Of kamikaze

Ten thousand willing
Pilots flying
Interfacing
Space and beyond
Built an army
To come and find me

Beyond all reason
Beyond all my hopes
The call of duty
Another war zone
Makes me moan

Kamikaze
Kamikaze
You can't touch me
Kamikaze

Eight miles high
He walks his path
And I follow mine
One truth for one eye 
He's come to find me

Ten thousand willing
Pilots flying
Interfacing
Space and beyond
Here is his army
Space and here we come

Kamikaze
Kamikaze
You don't touch me
Kamikaze

Kamikaze
You don't touch me
Kamikaze
You don't touch me

Space here we come
