All the white kids shuffle to the heavy metal stutter
And go shaking on the scene like killing machines
And they know that when she's stacked up top
She'll be a sucker for the shotgun show
Shaking obscene like the killing machines here we go

It's the same old show, He's a killer of a flash boy oh
He's a killer he's a killer he's a flashboy oh

Oh if you shake your fake tan thru aerosol land you'll know
That you'll suffer for your sex by the caravanettes oh no
And that sh*tter with the pout won't be putting it about no more
oh shaking obscene like a killing machine he we go

It's the same old show, he's a killer he's a flash boy oh
He's a killer he's a flash boy oh...oh and Athena loves your body

So think of the sea my darling
Think of the sea as you murder me

It's the same old show, he's a killer, he's a flash boy oh
This is the killing of a flash boy oh...
