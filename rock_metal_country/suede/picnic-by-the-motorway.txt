I'm so sorry to hear about the news,
Don't you worry,
I'll buy us a bottle and we'll drink in the petrol fumes,
I'm so sorry to hear about your world,
Don't you worry,
There's a gap in the fence down by the nature reserve,

Hey, such a lovely day, such a lovely day,
Such fun, looking at the lovers in a lay-by with my little one.

I'm so sorry to hear the news today,
Don't you worry,
There's been a speeding disaster so we'll go to the motorway,
I'm so sorry to hear about the scene,
Don't you worry,
Just put on your trainers and get out of it with me,

Hey, such a lovely day, such a lovely day,
Such fun, looking at the lovers in a lay-by with my little one.
Hey, such a lovely day, such a lovely day,
Such fun, looking at the lorries in the litter with my lovely one,

We could go dancing, we could go walking,
we could go shopping, we could keep talking,
we could go drinking, we could sit thinking,
we could go speeding, or we could go dreaming, see oh hey...
