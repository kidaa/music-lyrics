I see you're moving, see you're moving, moving in with her
You'll pierce your right ear, pierce your heart there
This skinny boy is one of the girls
cos around my neck and around her neck hangs everything you are
I know you've been inside but what were you in for

Animal lover, animal lover, animal lover

I see you're moving, see you're moving like wildlife from the waist
But when your name's scratched in on a shiny ring your waist is my resting place
And around my neck and around her neck hangs everything you are
I know you've been inside but what were you in for

Animal lover, animal lover, animal lover
