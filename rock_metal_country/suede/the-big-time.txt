I watch the slow hand
Kill the day,I see my starring mode
take away,
I watch the skyline,for him to come
And when he comes alone,we'll be gone.
And we'll go into the city,into the light
We'll be there in the headlines,
in care of the night
Cause this is the big time
this is the way
Now he's in the big time
he'll show you the way
This is the big time
This is the way
Now he's in the big time
And your in the way...
