Back where the dogs bark
where still life bleeds the concrete white
try not to go too far inside your mind
back where the cars decide
where the lame star limps an endless mile
have I gone too far inside my mind

oh if you were the one would I even notice now my mind has gone
oh if you were the one, would I even notice

Back where the car was parked
Where the canine in the A-line stole your time
you can only go so far for womankind

oh if you were the one, would I even notice now that he has come
oh, if you were the one, would I even notice

Does your love only come, does your love only come, does he only come in a Volvo
