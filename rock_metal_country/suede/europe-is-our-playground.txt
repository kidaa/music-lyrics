Run with me baby, let your hair down
through every station, through every town
run with me baby, let's take a chance
from Heathrow to Hounslow, from the Eastern Block to France

Europe is our playground, London is our town
so run with me baby now

Run with me baby, let your hair down
through every station, through every town
run with me baby, let's make a stand
from peepshow to disco, from Spain to Camber Sands

Europe is our playground, London is our town
so run with me baby now...
