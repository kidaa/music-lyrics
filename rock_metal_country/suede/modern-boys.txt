come unto me my winter son
we could lie on the rails
and when the morning comes
we'll be miles away, miles away
slipping away while the city sleeps
running away from this cruel disease
miles away, miles away

modern boys, modern boys
hand in hand
sick of the fear
chasing away all the hungry years
we're the modern boys 

come unto me my sickly thing
we could lie on the rails
but to really win
we'll just drive away, drive away 
yes the world calls my international
so let the decades die
let the parties fall
and we'll be miles away, miles away 

'cos we'll be living like
modern boys, modern boys
hand in hand
sick of the fear
chasing away all the hungry years
we're the modern boys, modern boys
into the night, under the stars
jumping the lights in the silent cars
he's on your left
i'm on your right
it's so easy in the concrete night
