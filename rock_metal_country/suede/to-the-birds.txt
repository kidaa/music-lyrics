Don't take your life cos your bicycle won't fly
You may be going to heaven tonight
Don't spoil the show for the love of some albino
You won't be going to heaven alone
I see her by the window waiting every night
So I wouldn't give a shit if your bicycle's in bits
I think I'm going to heaven on it
I see her by the window pour the poison from you
I'll go there through the window in my sixteen hole boots

And I'll sing to the birds here at my side
And I'll sing to the birds that will save my life...

Don't take your life cos your bicycle won't fly
You may be going to heaven tonight
I wouldn't give a shit if your bicycle's in bits
I think I'm going to heaven on it

I see her by the window and I see there's a day
We'll walk out through the traiffic and pour the poison away

So I'll sing to the birds there at my side
And I'll sing to the birds who will save my life

na na na na na na na

...I will lie down for her
