There was a girl who flew the world from a lonely shore
Through southern snow to Heathrow to understand the law
There was a boy who loved the noise of the underground
He left the coast and overdosed on that London sound

He said,
 I don't care if you're black or blue,
me and the stars stay up for you
I don't care who's wrong or right
and I don't care for the U.K. tonight so stay, stay 

And then one day she moved away from those garden walls
She left some flowers, he smoked for hours
She understood the law

I don't care if you're black or blue
Me and the stars stay up for you
I don't care who's wrong or right
And I don't care for the U.K. tonight
So stay, stay, stay, stay.........
