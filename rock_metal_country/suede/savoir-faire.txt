She lives in a house she's stupid as a mouse
And she going where the lights are on
She shaking obscene like a fucking machine
And she gone gone gone
She cooking crack giving us heart attack
And she living in a kooky show

She got pretty pretty feet
And she got flowers in her hair yeah yeah
She got savoir faire yeah yeah
