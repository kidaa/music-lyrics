Dressed as a cowboy on top of a hill it's sadder than it probably sounds 
He gets lovely the more he's ill don't o.d. on him now 
Dressed as a woman with horrible hair and singing to the birds in town 
Who goes walking through traffic out there don't o.d. on her now 

Oh is it true what they say about you? 
Oh is it true what they say about you two? 

Married to me is a hungry son who wants to push me from the 2nd floor 
We're so disco we can't get on in this world anymore 

Oh, is it true what they say about you? 
Oh, is it true what they say about you two? 

Dressed as a cowboy in a permanent gag it's sadder than it probably sounds 
So fucking what if he's licking the bag, don't o.d. on him now 

Oh, is it true what they say about you? 
Oh, is it true what they say about you two?
