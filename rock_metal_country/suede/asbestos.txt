Watching all the women shaking slimming
Walking down the road again
Looking at the lovers under covers come in and let's be friends
Watching all the schoolgirls shaking the rules
Coming on and having sex
Watching all the women shaking slimming
Come in an cash the cheques
The suburban girls and they're making noise
And they're making eyes at suburban boys
Watching all the lovers under cover
Watching all the roads that bend
Listening to lulu, amazula
Come in and let's pretend
Watching all the women shaking slimming
Walking down the road again
Scheming like a schoolboy watching you boy
Come in and let's pretend
The suburban girls and they're making noise
And they're making eyes at suburban boys
Suburban girls and they're making noise
And they're making eyes at suburban boys
At suburban boys
At suburban boys
At suburban boys
The suburban girls and they're making noise
And they're making eyes at suburban boys
Suburban girls and they're making noise
And they're making eyes at suburban boys
At suburban boys
At suburban boys
At suburban boys
