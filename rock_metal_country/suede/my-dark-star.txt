In a hired car she will come to England from the sea 
And as the tide flows the London snows will come. 
And from the skyline shines the lies of the government's singular history 
So in a hired world she will buy a gun 

And she will come from India with a love in her eyes 
That say oh how my dark star will rise 

In rented gear 2000 years we waited for a man 
But with a tattoed tit she'd die for us all tonight. 

And she will come from India with a gun at her side, 
Or she will come from Argentina 
With her cemetery eyes that say 
Oh, how my dark star will rise, 

...and she will rise.
