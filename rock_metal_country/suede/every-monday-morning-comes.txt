Oh when you and I
Watch the planes go by, silver in the sky,
Do whatever we like,
Oh you and me
See the birds in the sea
People on the streets, do whatever we please

But every Monday morning comes,
Every Monday morning, yeah
Oh every Monday morning comes
Every Monday morning, yeah
Oh, when you and I

Watch the London sky, Traffic rolling by
Do whatever we like,
So we chase the day away
Feel the morning rain
Piss our money down the drain
And do whatever they say
