she'll come to her end locked in a car somewhere with exhaust in her hair
What's she called I dunno, she's fucking with a slip of a man while the engine ran

And he said "She's not dead, she's gone away, gone away" he said
He said "She's not dead, just go away go away" he said

In the car he couldn't afford they found his made up name on her ankle chain
so don't call, don't call her at home
she's fucking with a slip of a man while the engine ran

and he said "she's not dead, she's gone away gone away" he said
he said "she's not dead, she's gone away gone away" 
he said "just gone away, gone away" he said
she's gone away to someone else's bed
