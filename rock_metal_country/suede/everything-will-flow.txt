[VERSE1:]
Watch the early morning sun
Drip like blood from the day
See the crazy people run
So many games to play
See the blue suburban dream
Under the jet plane sky
Sleep away and dream a dream
Life is just a lullaby

[CHORUS:]
Ah Ah Ah
And everything will flow

[VERSE2:]
Watch the day begin again
Whispering into the night
See the crazy people play
Hurrying under the light
A million cars, a million trains
Under the jet plane sky
Nothing lost and nothing gained
Life is just a lullaby

[CHORUS]

[VERSE CHORDS]

[CHORUS]

[ENDING: same chords as a chorus]
The neon lights in the night tonight will say
Everything will flow
The stars that shine in the open sky will say
Everything will flow
The lovers kissed with an openness will say
Everything will flow
The cars parked in the hypermarket know
Everything will flow
