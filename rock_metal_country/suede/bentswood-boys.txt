When you're high on diesel nightly
And the traffic starts to roll
You smoke a cigarette and watch the black girls
In a white boys world
Anything is possible for the Bentswood boys
Where the karma comes with the kids and the cat food
You see Tina push the pram
'Cos she was on her back in his estate car
And in the back of his van
Anything is possible for the Bentswood boys
For the Bentswood boys things are happening
For the Bentswood boys mmm... tell it like it is!
Don't take me down
Don't take me down
Don't take me down south
