shame on me well I had the beast you see
and if he can take it I can take him home with me
shame on her she's a lovely little number
and when we go lassoing you get lassoed, all of you
If you can take it, I can take it

And we're moving, so moving, so we are a boy, we are a girl
so moving, so moving...

shame on the girl, she's got a big black dog in her
and while tough kids sing about tough kids she just skins the world
we'll never never play the harp, and we'll stick like sick on the stars
and if you can take it I can take these stones from my heart
if you can take it, I can take it

and we're moving, so moving, so we are a boy we are a girl
so moving, so moving....

If you can take it, I can take it, all of me
If you can take it, I can take it all
If you can take it, I can take it, all of me
If you can take it, I can take it all!
