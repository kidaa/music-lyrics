Whiplash caught the silver son
Took the film to No. I
Crashed the car and left us here
Broken glass for teenage boys trapped in steel and celluloid
Crashed the car and left us here.

And daddy burned a million eyes
Dared the dogs to criticise
He crashed the car and I was born

And daddy turned a million heads
Took the teenage dream to bed
He crashed the car and left us here

With dreams of gasoline drying our eyes
Green fields of destiny high in the sky
But oh can you see him
Oh Daddy's speeding

Whiplash caught the silver son
Killed the sad American
Crashed the car and left us here

And sorrow turns his eyes to mine
Come with me now it's your time
Let's crash the car and I'll be born

And sorrow breaks the silent day
Takes the teenage boys away
They crash the cars and leave us here

With dreams of gasoline drying our eyes
Green fields and death machines high in the sky

But oh can you see him
Oh, when Daddy's speeding
