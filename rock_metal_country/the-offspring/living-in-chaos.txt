Somewhere the time was right, could have been gone in ten
This world is hard to fight, hitting you once, hit it again
To know the way it feels, everyone gets knocked down
When you get up its real, by taking it back, turn it around 

Get on it, up on it
Get on it  wouldn't wanna be you
Get on it, out on it
Get on it  no ones gonna free you
You know, when youre keeping it slow
No matter where you wanna go  wouldnt wanna be you
Get on it, up on it
It's on  we're living in chaos 

Somewhere along the line, things get chipped away
This place keeps going down, gets a little worse every day
I see hate and greed, this worlds a messed up town
Embrace the pain and see, by taking it back, you turn it around
