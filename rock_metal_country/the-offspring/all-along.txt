Deep inside secrets burning
I Should have known all the while whats true
I went along, to fool myself
Cant go on, I cant escape it 

All along
I think I really knew
It was there in the words unspoken
All along
Still believed in you
Now I stand here betrayed and broken 

Close my eyes from the burning
All along all the while its true
Take it on, or turn your back
Either way, you cant escape it
