The rocking horse came
From an old oak tree
Just missed the house
When it was hit by lightning
My daddy painted that horse
A midnight blue
Shooting stars and silver horseshoes
And it was something magic out of something frightening

[Chorus]
That's how I live my life
I take it as it comes
And I find the hidden love
When it's pouring down on me
In my mind I see
The rocking horse inside the tree
A broken heart
Means deeper feelings
A thorn in the flesh
Means room for healing
Oh salt in your tears
Can open your eyes
Wounded years
Make you realize
It's just something magic out of something frightening

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge]
Things aren't always as they seem
Take the nightmare from my dreams

[Repeat Chorus]
