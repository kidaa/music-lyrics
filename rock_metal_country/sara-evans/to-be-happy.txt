If I had one wish, I would wish for two
For me and you to be happy
With the way things are, sometimes gets hard
But, we've come so far to be happy

[Chorus]
Yeah, don't think that I'm complaining
Sometimes it keeps on raining
Oh but don't be frightened by thunder and lightning
The sun comes out and the flowers grow
And you find you're already on the road to be happy
If I had one prayer to pull out of thin air
Everyone, everywhere would be happy
We'd hand out Valentines, I'd be yours, you'd be mine
There's a place, there's a time to be happy

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge]

Well we fuss and we fight
We can't see the light
We wake up and decide
We don't need to be right to be happy

[Repeat Chorus]
