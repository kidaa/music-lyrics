These days seem like years 
When the nights are spent in tears 
Tomorrow seems a lifetime away 
These days, these days 

Ever since you said good-bye 
The hands on the clock just take their time 
I wonder if they always will 
Cause the minute that you left me 
Time stood still 

These days seem like years 
When the nights are spent in tears 
Tomorrow seems a lifetime away 
These days, these days 

The pillow where you used to dream 
Is right where you left it 
When you loved me 
Will I touch your face again 
I'll keep hoping but until then 

These days seem like years 
When the nights are spent in tears 
Tomorrow seems a lifetime away 
These days, these days 

Oh tomorrow seems a lifetime away 
These days, these days
