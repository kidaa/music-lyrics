He was just a boy of seventeen
And I was older by a year
And we spent everything we ever made
To get away from here

We got married in the winter time
At the Open Doors Cafe
No matter how he tried, he couldn't fine the peace of mind to stay

[Chorus]
All the glitter out in Hollywood
All the stars that never shine
They can't hold a candle to your wind
Could you roll me, roll me back in time

Got a job and worked the early shift
I spent hours by the phone
Promises are easy to forget
When there's too much time alone

You've got something they can't argue with
That's what all the people say
He's just wating for the obvious
His star is on his way, any day

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge]
Just this side of sunrise,
you can feel it in the air
That something's bound to happen
It's just right there
Everyboyd loves you, it's so easy to see
But it's only, yeah, it's only in your dreams

[Repeat Chorus]

I woke up to find him standing there with his suitcase in his hand
