Been running from these feelings for so long
Telling my heart I didn't need you
Pretending I was better off alone
But I know that it's just a lie
So afraid to take a chance again
So afraid of what I feel inside

[Chorus]
But I need to be next to you
Oh I, oh I
I need to share every breath with you
Oh I, oh I
I need to know I can see your smile each morning
Look into your eyes each night
For the rest of my life
Here with you near with you
Oh I, I need to be next to you
Right here with you is where I belong
I'll lose my mind if I can't see you
Without you there is nothing in this life
That would make life worth living for
I can't bear the thought of you not there
I can't fight what I feel anymore

[Repeat Chorus]

Oh I, I need to be next to you
I need to have your heart next to mine
For all time
Love you for all of my life

[Repeat Chorus]
