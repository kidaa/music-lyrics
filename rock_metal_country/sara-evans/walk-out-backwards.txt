I'd rather live a life of lies and fantasy 
Than to face the truth and realize you're leaving me 
You built me up so high my heart can't stand to fall 
And life without your love just isn't life at all 

So walk out backwards if you must go 
But please don't wave goodbye 
Just wave one last hello 
The truth won't hurt so much 
If I can just pretend 
So walk out backwards 
And I'll think you're walking in 

Well, you walked into my heart in search of sympathy 
And from that day down to this 
You've walked all over me 
And now you're walking out to love somebody new 
But you're not by yourself 
'Cause my heart's leaving too 

So walk out backwards if you must go 
But please don't wave goodbye 
Just wave one last hello 
The truth won't hurt so much 
If I can just pretend 
So walk out backwards 
And I'll think you're walking in
