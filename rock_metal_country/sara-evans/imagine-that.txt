Imagine me, still loving you
After all you've put me through
Well, I can't help it, I just do
Imagine that and that's not the half

Imagine this if you can
I've stood more, more than I should stand
But I'd still take you back again
Imagine that, ain't that a laugh

Can you believe I'd swallow my pride
Well yes, yes, I guess you can
'Cause you know you've always had my foolish heart
Right in the palm of your hand
So, for what it's worth to you
It just don't matter what you might do
'Cause I'll still be waiting and loving you
Imagine that, ain't that a laugh

So, for what it's worth to you
It just don't matter what you might do
'Cause I'll still be waiting and loving you
Imagine that, ain't that a laugh
