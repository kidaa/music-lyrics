I'm a bee charmer for you baby
I get you honey if you've got the taste
A little sting now and then, well it does not bother me, no
I don'e mind no king bee buzzin' around my face

[Chorus]
Go with you anyway the wind blows
Straight through the fire into the unknown
Follow the feelin'
'Cause I know it's supernatural...
Yeah, supernatural

I'm a snake handler from the mountains
I sing them rattlers off to sleep, yeah
And if my baby says he needs healin'
There's no fever too hot, no cut too deep

[Repeat Chorus]

I'm a rainmaker in the desert
I dance and coax the clouds to cry
To put the bloom back in baby's meadow
I'll flood the faith back into your eyes

[Chorus]
Go with you anyway the wind blows
Straight through the fire into the unknown
Follow the feelin'
'Cause I know it's supernatural...
Supernatural, baby
Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on, go with it baby
Supernatural, yeah
Ooo, come on, come on, come on, come on, go with it baby
Supernatural
