[Chorus]
Give me a sad song that I can hold on to
Anything to set me free
Just one big cry, big tears in my eyes
To wash you away from me
I need a night all by myself
Got some things I need to work out
I got this fever that just won't break
I got some troubles I got to shake
Give me, give me

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge]

I know, I know I'm gonna have to cleanse my soul
If I'm ever gonna get back on my way
One night, one night, one dark and lonely night
And then will come a brighter day
Just give me one night, one night, one dark and lonely night
And then will come a brighter day

[Repeat Chorus]
