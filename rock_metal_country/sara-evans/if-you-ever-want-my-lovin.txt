If you ever want my lovin' 
There's a few things you should do 
Bring me coffee in the early morning 
And roses in the afternoon 
If you ever want my lovin' 
You gotta show me every day 
But if you're thinkin' that you won't 
And even if you don't 
You're gonna get it anyway 

Well you're kickin' up your heels on the dance floor 
With every pretty girl but me 
You've been ignorin' me all night 
And I'm likin' your strategy 
Well I know you're tryin' to make me jealous 
But I ain't gonna fuss or fret 
'Cause baby I've got your number 
You're justa playin' hard to get 

If you ever want my lovin' 
There's a few things you should do 
Bring me coffee in the early morning 
And roses in the afternoon 
If you ever want my lovin' 
You gotta show me every day 
But if you're thinkin' that you won't 
And even if you don't 
You're gonna get it anyway 

You won't admit to your buddies that you like me 
It's cute the way you're actin' tough 
But this little game you're playin' 
Has gone about far enough 

If you ever want my lovin' 
There's a few things you should do 
Bring me coffee in the early morning 
And roses in the afternoon 
If you ever want my lovin' 
You gotta show me every day 
But if you're thinkin' that you won't 
And even if you don't 
You're gonna get it anyway 

Yes, if you're thinkin' that you won't 
And even if you don't 
You're gonna get it anyway
