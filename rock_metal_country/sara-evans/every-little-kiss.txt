Way out here working on the docks 
Everyone sees the long day through 
Oh, what would I do 
Without the nights and the phone 
And the chance just to talk to you 
Oh, what would I do now 
Just to talk to you 
A thousand miles away 
What I wouldn't give for only one night 
A little relief in sight 
Or someday when times weren't so tight 

When the day goes down on the water town 
When the sun sinks low all around 
That's when I know I need you now 
Yeah, you're what I miss 
Every little kiss 
Every little one, every little one 

Everybody here's a number, not a name 
But I guess that's alright with me 
As I sit alone after a long day 
In the absence of company 
Oh, I let my mind wander 
A thousand miles away 
What I wouldn't give for only one night 
A little relief in sight 
Or someday when times weren't so tight 

When the day goes down on the water town 
When the sun sinks low all around 
That's when I know I need you now 
Yeah, you're what I miss 
Every little kiss 
Every little one, every little one
