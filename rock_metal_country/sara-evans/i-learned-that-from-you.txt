I remember the windows rolled down and the wind in my hair 
Driving 'round in your Daddy's old Chevy 
Like we were going somewhere 

We thought that summer would last us forever 
Going steady was just something you do 
I didn't know much about love 
I learned that from you 

Now those were some good times 
Lately they don't seem to last 
I guess I'm not nearly as strong as a drink in your glass 
And the nights just get later 
I can stay up and wait or just go on to bed like I do 
I never knew nothing about lonely 
I learned from that you 

And I learned how to kiss on a ferris wheel 
And I made wishes at wishing wells 
And I fell into that fairytale too 
And I know that love ain't so easy 
But we tried, didn't we baby 
It's alright 
Some dreams weren't meant to come true 
I learned that from you 

One night while the whole world was turning 
I left you a note 
And I told you that I'd always miss you 
Then I let you go 
I'm living outside of some town I ain't heard of 
And I think about the boy I knew 
I didn' t know you could fall out of love 
I learned that from you 

And I learned how to kiss on a ferris wheel 
And I made wishes at wishing wells 
And I fell into that fairytale too 
And I know that love ain't so easy 
But we tried, didn't we baby 
It's alright 
Some dreams weren't meant to come true 
I learned that from you 

I remember the windows rolled down 
And the wind..
