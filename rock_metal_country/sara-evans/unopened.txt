There's a key in a letter unopened
Buried back in an old dresser drawer
There's a name stained with tears on that letter
One that I'm sure I've never seen before

There's no date on that letter unopened
My guess is it's faded with years
And I can't sleep at night now for wonderin'
How long has that secret been hiding here

Did you love someone, lose someone
Leave someone waiting
Is there somebody's heart out there
You could have taken
The letter says it all
Though the words go unspoken
You loved me enough to leave it unopened

There's a love that is trust without reason
There's a faith that leaves questions unasked
And though my heart has searched for the answer
I love you too much for these lips to ask

Did you love someone, lose someone
Leave someone waiting
Is there somebody's heart out there
You could have taken
The letter says it all
Though the words go unspoken
You loved me enough to leave it unopened

Oh, the letter says it all
Though the words go unspoken
And, I love you enough to leave it unopened
