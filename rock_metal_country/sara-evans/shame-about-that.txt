I heard the word goin' round 
Somebody said she's leavin' town 
Packed up her bags and left you flat 
Shame about that 

Somebody said they saw her cryin' 
Said she was through with all your lyin' 
Said wild horses couldn't drag her back 
Shame about that 

Well excuse me for my lack of sympathy 
I don't mean to be cruel 
But it sounds like the same kind of thing you did to me 
Back when I played the fool 
So, don't bother knockin' on my door 
'Cause I wouldn't touch you with a ten foot pole 
You dug your grave now lay on back 
Shame about that
