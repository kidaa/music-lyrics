Back when I was young 
Couldn't wait to grow up 
Get away and get out on my own 
And looking back now 
Ain't it funny how 
I've been trying to get back home, yeah 

When my low self esteem 
Needs a man loving me 
And I find me a perfect catch 
Then I see my friends 
Having wild weekends 
Then I don't wanna get quite so attached 
Just as soon as I get what I want 
I get unsatisfied 
Good is good but could be better 

I keep looking, I keep looking for 
I keep looking for something more 
I always wonder what's on the other side 
Of the number two door 
I keep looking 
Looking for something more 

Well, the straight haired girls 
They all want curls 
And the brunettes wanna be blonde 
It's your typical thing 
You got ying you want yang 
It just goes on and on 
They say, hey, it's only human 
To never be satisfied 
Well I guess that I'm as human as the next one 

Oh, I keep looking 
I keep looking for 
I keep looking for something more 
I always wonder what's on the other side 
Of the number two door 
Yeah, I keep looking 
Looking for something more 

Just as soon as I get what I want 
I get unsatisfied 
Hey, good is good but could be better 

I keep looking 
I keep looking for 
I keep looking for something more 
I always wonder what's on the other side 
Of the number two door 
I keep looking 
Looking for something more 
Oh, looking for something more
