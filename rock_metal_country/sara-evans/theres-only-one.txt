Ain't got no money 
No place to sleep 
No one has ever been down as me 
I'm just a stranger trouble at my feet 
But through all my trials 
It occurs to me 

There's only one 
There's only one 
There's only one thing that matters 
Its God's love 

Now I could worry 
About what's ahead 
But I keep thinking 
What Jesus said 
There is a place 
That I can go 
And there'll be a face 
I'll surely know 

Cause there's only one 
There's only one 
There's only one thing that matters 
It's God's love 

There's only one 
There's only one 
There's only one thing that matters 
It's God's love 

There's only one 
There's only one 
There's only one thing that matters 
It's God's love 
Yeah there's only one thing matters 
It's God's love
