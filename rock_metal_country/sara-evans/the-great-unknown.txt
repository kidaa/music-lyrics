Fire up the motor baby, I'm already packed 
I'll ride shotgun, navigate, throw the cooler in the back 
Let's try and get us lost 
Anywhere you want to go 
Come on show me the other side of the great unknown 

Well I've never rocked the Rockies 
Never sinned in Santa Fe 
I want to stand on a corner in Winslow, Arizona someday 
And just take it easy 
Drive me down a desert road 

Come on show me the other side of the great unknown 

Cause I'm tired of being careful 
I'm sick of staying home 
I just want to see a little of the great unknown 
Take a right, take a left, I don't really care 

It doesn't matter where we end up 
Baby I can love you anywhere 
I will be a waitress, you could work on cars 
Find ourselves a koa and sleep underneath the stars 
Just living and a loving 

Cause I'm tired of being careful 
I'm sick of staying home 
I just want to see a little of the great unknown 
Take a right, take a left, I don't really care 

Baby don't say no 
Come on and show me the other side of the great unknown 
Show me the other side of the great unknown
