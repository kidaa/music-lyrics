I never wanted to, but I said goodbye to you 
It happens, people change 
Sometimes their dreams go separate ways 
They say all good things must end 
Still someday I thought I'd see your face again 

I understand, I realize 
It was the end of all those nights 
With you here in my arms, just the pounding of two hearts 
Now that's all gone with the wind 
Still someday I thought I'd see your face again 

Oh I've gotta phone, but no way to get a hold of you 
I've got a letter, no address that I can send it to 

Tonight I'll look out to the stars 
Can't help but wonder where you are 
So much space and time between all those used to be's 
I know life goes on, but then 
Still someday I thought I'd see your face again 
I know life goes on, but then 
Still someday I thought I'd see your face again
