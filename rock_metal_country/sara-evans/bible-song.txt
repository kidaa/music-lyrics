No stranger in this town
Nobody moves without making a sound
You live and die within the borders and lines
No one dies without paying their fines

No lovers in this town
The moon's full but it sure ain't round
And just because you lie in his bed
Don't mean he meant the things he said

[1st Chorus]
They marry young in these parts
They work the factories
So I ran as fast as I could
Through the tall grass and the midnight woods
So no one would sing some bible song over me

My cousin died in his sleep
Forty pilss, two kids to keep
And how will she explain to those kids
About the sorry thing daddy did

They marry young in these parts
They raise their kids and set them free
So I ran as fast as I could
Through the tall grass and the midnight woods
So no one would sing some bible song over me

They buried him out in the cold
He was only twenty-four years old
How his mother came undone
When the choir sang hallelujah

[Chorus]
I ran as fast as I could 
Through the tall grass and the midnight woods
I ran as fast as I could
Through the tall grass and the midnight woods
Hallelujah Hallelujah - ahh
Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
Hallelujah hallelujah 
Hallelujah
