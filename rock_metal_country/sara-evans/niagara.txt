Standing at the edge of this cliff
Gravity being what it is
I'm afraid that I might stumble
'Cause I've never been this high
I'm so carried away by this place
And the simple beauty of your face
When the walls start to crumble
And I'm helpless to fight

[Chorus]
'Cause you can't ask the sun not to shine
And no one's ever found a way to stop time
Oh baby it's unstoppable
I can't resist at all
I would never try to slow down the wind
Baby it just has to be what it is
And asking me not to love you
Is like asking Niagara not to fall
I can't worry my heart with what if
Maybe I should just give in
And wrap myself around you
And let you take me down
Take me down

[Repeat Chorus]
