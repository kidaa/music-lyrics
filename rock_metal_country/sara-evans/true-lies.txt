I look into those blue eyes 
Something happens to me 
Although I know again tonight 
I'll hear nothing but true lies 

That string of broken hearts all over town 
Should be enough to tell me 
I should be turning you down, then 

I look into those blue eyes 
Something happens to me 
Although I know again tonight 
I'll hear nothing but true lies 

True lies will hurt me less than losing you 
So darling lie to me 
When I get lost in those blue eyes 

I should know better than to let you in 
We're just beginning 
And I can already see the end, when 

I look into those blue eyes 
Something happens to me 
Although I know again tonight 
I'll hear nothing but true lies
