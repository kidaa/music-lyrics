Tell Cupid not to point that thing at me 
One more hole in my poor heart is just what I don't need 
I've been teased by a fake 
Burned by love 
And left by destiny 
So for my hearts sake tell Cupid wait 
Don't point that thing at me 

A boy and girl 
That's where it starts 
And then oh cupid, well he goes right for the heart 
Yeah I've been hit a time or two 
But what got me turned out to be just passing through 

So tell Cupid not to point that thing 
One more hole in my poor heart is just what I don't need 
Well teased by a fake 
Burned by a love 
And left by destiny 
So for my hearts sake tell Cupid wait 
Don't point that thing at me 

True love I saw and finally found 
That I'm better off just doing without 
Oh its a real cold shot, yeah its a deadly curse 
That goes from a good love to bad love 
And heartache at its worse 

So tell Cupid not to point that thing 
One more hole in my poor heart is just what I don't need 
Well teased by a fake 
Burned by a love 
And left by destiny 
So for my hearts sake tell Cupid wait 
Don't point that thing at me
