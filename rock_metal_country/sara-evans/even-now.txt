You said when I broke your heart that I'd regret it
No one else would love me half as much as you
Well I wish I'd listened closer when you said that I'd be blue
'Cause missin' you is all I ever do

Even now I catch myself daydreaming
'Bout the nights when it was candlelight and wine
Even now I get that empty feelin'
And that's all that it takes, I feel my heart start to break
So darlin', guess that makes us even now

Well I laid awake in bed last night rehearsin'
What I'd say if we should meet by chance
I'd tell you now that I'm the one who's hurtin' over you
And I'd give anything to have you back

Even now I catch myself daydreaming
'Bout the nights when it was candlelight and wine
Even now I get that empty feelin'
And that's all that it takes, I feel my heart start to break
So darlin', guess that makes us even now

Oh, if I could turn back time, you would still be mine
So darlin', guess that makes us even now
