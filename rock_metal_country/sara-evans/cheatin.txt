You say your every day
Is a bad dream that keeps repeatin'
Maybe you should've thought about that
When you were cheatin'

How do you like that furnished room, the bed, the chair, the table
The TV pictures goes in and out, too bad you don't have cable
How do you like that paper plate, and those pork-n-beans you're eatin'
Maybe you should've thought about that
When you were cheatin'

How do you like that beat up car, I think it's fair we traded
You pick up truck is running fine, it's a cozy ride for datin'
Yes, I've been out a time or two, and found the comfort I've been needin
Maybe you should've thought about that
When you were cheatin'

You made your bed and your out of mine
You lie awake and I sleep just fine
You've done your sowing, now you can do your reaping
Maybe you should've thought about that
When you were cheatin'

What became of what's her name, after she spent all your money
Did she leave you like you left me, sometimes life is funny
But I'll be glad to take you back, just as soon as I stop breathin
Maybe you should've thought about that
Maybe you should've thought about that
When you were cheatin'
When you were cheatin'
