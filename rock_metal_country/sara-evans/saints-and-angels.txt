We're only human, baby 
We walk on broken ground 
We lose our way 
We come unwound 
We'll turn in circles, baby 
We're never satisfied 
We'll fall from grace 
Forget we can fly 
But through all the tears that we cried 
We'll survive 

Cause when we're torn apart 
Shattered and scarred 
Love has the grace to save us 
We're just two tarnished hearts 
When in each other's arms 
We become saints and angels. 

I love your imperfections 
I love your everything 
Your broken heart, your broken wings 
I love you when you hold me 
And when you turn away 
I love you still and I'm not afraid 
Cause I know you feel the same way 
And you'll stay 

Cause when we're torn apart 
Shattered and scarred 
Love has the grace to save us 
We're just two tarnished hearts 
When in each other's arms 
We become saints and angels. 

These feet of clay these feet of clay 
They will not stray 

Cause when we're torn apart 
Shattered and scarred 
Love has the grace to save us 
We're just two tarnished hearts 
When in each other's arms 
We become saints and angels. 
Saints and angels
