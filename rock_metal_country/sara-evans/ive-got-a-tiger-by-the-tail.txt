I've got a tiger by the tail
It's plain to see
I won't be much when you get through with me
Well, I'm a losing weight and a turnin' mighty pale
Looks like I've got a tiger by the tail

Well, I thought the day I met you
You were meek as a lamb
Just the kind to make my dreams and plans
But now the pace we're livin'
Takes the wind from my sail
Looks like I've got a tiger by the tail

I've got a tiger by the tail
It's plain to see
I won't be much when you get through with me
Well, I'm a losing weight and a turnin' mighty pale
Looks like I've got a tiger by the tail

Every night you drag me where
The bright lights are found
There ain't no way to slow you down
I'm about as helpless as a leaf in a gale
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail

I've got a tiger by the tail
It's plain to see
I won't be much when you get through with me
Well, I'm a losing weight and a turnin' mighty pale
Looks like I've got a tiger by the tail
