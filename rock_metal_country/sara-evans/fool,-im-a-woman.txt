If you ever walked away. 
Use to think I needed you so bad. 
Did I say that I'd never leave you behind? 
Well, just keep treating me unkind 'cause fool I'm a woman and I'm bound to change my mind. 

With a woman it's imperative you show her that you love her. 
If you don't it's her prerogative to change like the weather. 
I'm seeing the signs. 
You know I use to think love was blind. 
Well, fool I'm a woman and I'm bound to change my mind. 

You use to tell me so many nights.

Well, maybe you were right. 

Yesterday you offered me the world. 
Did you think I'd take it? 
Now you treat me like some silly girl. 
Yeah, and that's where I'm drawing the line. 
You know I use to think you were so fine. 
Well, fool I'm a woman and bound to change my... 
Well, fool I'm a woman and I'm about to change my... 
Well, fool I'm a woman and I just changed my mind. 
And I'm about to change my mind.
