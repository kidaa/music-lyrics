There's a cold wind howlin' at the trailer door 
And the wolf that's been scratchin' 
Is coming back for more 
This quilt that Mama gave us 
Is the only thing between us 
And the sunrise 
And I don't want to see the light 
No, I don't want to see the light 

I don't want to see the light of day 
Just this once 
Will you make it go away 
Take this burden from me 
Oh, tomorrow will keep 
I don't want to see the light of day 

'Cause there are bills on the table and they're overdue 
And these dreams we've been chasing 
Well, they're far from coming true 
Oh, I'm not scared of tomorrow 
I just need a little more of tonight 
And I don't want to see the light 
No, I don't want to see the light 

I don't want to see the light of day 
Just this once 
Will you make it go away 
Take this burden from me 
Oh, tomorrow will keep 
I don't want to see the light of day 

Oh, take this burden from me 
Oh, tomorrow will keep 
I don't want to see the light of day 
I don't want to see the light of day
