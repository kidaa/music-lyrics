Baby, hold my hand 
Show me you're my man 
Take me to that land 
Where we can get crazy 
Cause this old world gets tough 
When I've had enough 
I need to know your love 
Will be here to save me, save me 

Let's dance while the lights are shining bright 
Let's dance while the music's feeling right 
Romance till the night is through 
You'll be holding me 
Yeah, and I'll be holding you 
Let's dance 

Wanna feel your touch 
You know I love you so much 
Maybe with a little love 
Our world will turn slower 
Cause we've been moving so fast 
Seems life is flying past 
Can we make this moment 
I wanna remember, remember 

Let's dance while the lights are shining bright 
Let's dance while the music's feeling right 
Romance till the night is through 
You'll be holding me 
Yeah, and I'll be holding you 
Let's dance 
Oh, let's dance 

Oh, baby just say yes 
I've got this brand new dress 
This night could change our lives forever 
Yeah, let's dance 
Oh, romance till the night is through 
You'll be holding me now 
Yeah, and I'll be holding you 
Let's dance 
Yeah, let's dance 
Baby, baby, baby let's dance 
Oh, hold me, love me, show me baby 
Baby, let's dance
