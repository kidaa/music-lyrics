You don't know what you do 
When you look at me that way 
You don't how my heart breaks 
Everytime you say my name 
You don't see all the tears 
That I cry in the dark 
You don't hear how I pray 
That you're safe when we're apart 
Everytime we kiss you don't know 
How you steal a piece of my soul 

You don't know how it feels 
To be the one who loves the most 
How hard it is not to beg you to stay 
Then watch you go 
Oh, you say it's all in my head 
But to me it seems so real 
No, you don't know how it feels 
You might think you do 
But you don't 
Hey! 

And everytime we kiss you don't know 
How you steal a piece of my soul 

You don't know how it feels 
To be the one who loves the most 
How hard it is not to beg you to stay 
Then watch you go 
Oh, you say it's all in my head 
But to me it seems so real 
No, you don't know it feels 
You might think you do 
But you don't 
No, you don't know how it feels 
You might think you do 
But you don't
