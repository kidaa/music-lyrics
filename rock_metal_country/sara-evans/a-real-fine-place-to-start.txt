I'm gonna do it darlin'...
I could waste time tryin' the figure it out,
But I'm jumpin' in anyhow.
I've never been this far;
Didn't know love could run so deep...
Didn't know I'd lose this much sleep.

Holdin' you close, chasin' that moon.
Spendin' all night,
Lovin' just who you are...
Sparks flyin' in the dark.
Shootin' out lights, huntin' down dreams,
Figurin' out what love really means...
Baby, givin' you my heart,
Is a real fine place to start.

Somethin' is goin' on,
I can't explain but sure can touch...
It's callin' both of us.
Stronger than any fear or doubt,
It's changin' everything I see...
It's changin' you, it's changin' me.

Holdin' you close, chasin' that moon.
Spendin' all night,
Lovin' just who you are...
Sparks flyin' in the dark.
Shootin' down lights, runnin' down dreams,
Figurin' out what love really means...
Baby, givin' you my heart,
Is a real fine place to start.

Right here, right now's the perfect spot, the perfect time.
The perfect moment when your skin is next to mine.

[Instrumental break]

Yeah, yeah...
Holdin' you close, Holdin' you close.
Chasin' that moon. Chasin' that moon.
Spendin' all night,
Lovin' just who you are...
Sparks flyin' in the dark.
Shootin' out lights, Shootin' down lights.
Runnin' down dreams, Runnin' down dreams.
Figurin' out just what love really means...
Baby, givin' you my heart's a real fine place,
Real fine place to start.
Oh yeah.
Oh, oh, oh.
