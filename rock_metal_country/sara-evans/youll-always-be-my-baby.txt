There I was ten years old
Waiting in my room for him to come home
I just knew he'd be so mad
Though I begged my mother not to, she told my dad.
There was no denying I let him down
But instead of being angry
He put his arms around me and said

In the sunlight or the rain brightest nights or darkest days
I'll always feel the same way
Whatever road you may be on
No your never too far gone my love is there wherever you may be
Just remember that you will always be my baby.

There I was twenty one
Oh I was so ashamed of what I'd done
On a country road
Parked one night
It started out so innocent
Then crossed the line
There was no denying
I let God down
But instead of being angry
He wrapped his arms around me and I heard

In the sunlight or the rain brightest nights or darkest rains
I'll always feel the same way
Whatever road you may be on
No your never too far gone
My love is there wherever you may be
Just remember that you will always be my baby yeah yeah.

There he is my little man
I'm sure he'll get in trouble every now and then
And I pray to god that when he does
I'll be just as understanding
And my father was oh the last thing that I want to do is let him down
So instead of being angry
I'm gonna throw my arms around him and I'll say

In the sunlight or the rain brightest nights or darkest rains
I'll always feel the same way whatever road you may be on
Noo your never too far gone
My love is there wherever you may be
Just remember that you will always be my baby be my baby
