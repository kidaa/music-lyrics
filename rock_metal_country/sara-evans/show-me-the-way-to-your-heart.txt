I've been trying to break down your walls 
But I don't know how to get through 
You say that you want me 
You say that you need me 
But baby, I need more from you 

You've gotta take my hand 
And lead me to where you are 
You know I'll follow 
To show me the way to your heart 

I know it's hard for you to trust again 
But you've just got to believe 
I will never lie to you 
And I will never hurt you 
Baby, I'm asking please 

You've gotta take my hand 
And lead me to where you are 
You know I'll follow 
To show me the way to your heart 

Think you've locked your heart away 
Baby, I hold the key 
Believe me when I say 
My love can set you free 

Take my hand 
And lead me to where you are 
You know I'll follow 
To show me the way to your heart 
Take my hand 
And lead me to where you are 
Baby, you know I'll follow 
To show me the way to your heart
