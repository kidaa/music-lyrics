On a highway bound for nowhere 
I ran my fingers through my tangled hair 
As I pulled in for another tank of freedom 
With a hundred miles behind me 
And a million more to go 
I was tryin' to put some distance between us 

I turned on the radio 
And a voice came over sweet and low 
And I didn't know the tears were gonna start 
But what amazed me even more 
Is I'd never heard that song before 
But somehow I knew each word by heart 

And I don't know why, I don't know how 
But with his song he turned my life and 
This old car around 
Just when I thought I was over you 
He changed my life with three chords and the truth 

Found a pay phone at a truck stop 
Said a prayer as the quarter dropped 
Oh, please be home, I know that I was wrong 
Honey, don't talk, just listen 
I think I found what I was missin' 
In a song I heard tonight on a radio 

And I don't know why, I don't know how 
But with his song he turned my life and 
This old car around 
Just when I thought I was over you 
He changed my life with three chords and the truth 

Just when I thought I was over you 
He changed my mind with three chords and the truth
