I'm a leaf on the river
Fallen from the tall oak tree
Drifting down this moving stream
Wherever this life carries me
I'm a tumbleweed
In the desert wind
Just tumblin' while
The sun's shinin'
I have no boundaries
Call me a gypsy

[Chorus]
I'm restless
Just ramblin'
What do you do, where do you go
When nowhere feels like home
I'm restless
Am I an angel fallen from heaven's grace
Oh, it feels like that some days and I can't find my place
I guess God just made some of us
To live and die by highway dust
Guess I just have to trust
On the days I'm crawlin'
This is my callin'

[Repeat Chorus]

Oh, to hold somebody close that cares
Oh, to finally find some roots somewhere
I know someday I'll find that it's out there
But until then I'll just keep movin'
What do you do, where do you go
When nowhere feels like home
I'm restless
