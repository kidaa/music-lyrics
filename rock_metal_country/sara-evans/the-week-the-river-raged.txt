The river ran through Howard County 
It was the life blood of the land 
It make fields of green tobacco 
Aching backs and callused hands 
Mama talked of a coming battle 
That the women folk had to fight 
'Cause the good lord owned the daytime 
But the devil seemed to own the night 

Well, it came up out of nowhere 
From a dark and bitter seed 
It was the roughest kind of roadhouse 
And a most unwanted weed 
It drew the men folk like a magnet 
The women knew what they had to do 
So they put it in the hands of Jesus 
'Cause they knew that he'd come through 

And the rains came and the river swelled 
And the more they prayed the more it fell 
When the levies broke everybody saw 
The awesome power of God 
Then the clouds rolled back and the rainbow came 
To bring a brighter day 
'Cause when the flood hit Howard County 
All the sins were washed away 

Now the mothers tell the story 
Of the week that the river raged 
It's the passing of the wisdom 
To the ears of tender age 
Better walk the straight and narrow 
Better keep a watchful eye 
'Cause there's a symbol of the wrath of Heaven 
In every dark cloud in the sky 

And the rains came and the river swelled 
And the more they prayed the more it fell 
When the levies broke everybody saw 
The awesome power of God 
Then the clouds rolled back and the rainbow came 
To bring a brighter day 
'Cause when the flood hit Howard County 
All the sins were washed away
