Ooh 
Why should I care if you found somebody new 
And you look like you're in love 
And why should I care if she looks a lot like me 
And she's all you've ever dreamed of 
I didn't care enough to keep you around 
So tell me why should I care now 

I was the one who let you go 
I never told you that I love you 
I couldn't promise anything 
The way you needed me to 
Oh, my heart was never really there 
So why should I care 
Why should I care? 
I just do 

So why should I care if 
I ain't nothing in your eyes 
What you felt for me is gone 
Oh, and why would I feel that way 
Now that it's too late 
To change what I did wrong 
Oh, I didn't care enough to keep you around 
So baby, tell me, why should I care now 

I was the one who let you go 
I never told you that I love you 
I couldn't promise anything 
The way you needed me to 
Oh, my heart was never really there 
So why should I care 
Why should I care? 
Well, I just do 

Oh, my heart was never really there 
So why should I care 
Why should I care 
I just do 
Yeah, I just do 
Baby, I just do
