Love I haven't seen you in a long time 
Since then I ain't been worth a dime 
Hasn't been that long 
But it feels like years 
Last time it could have worked out better 
But you know we belong together 
Love don't be a stranger round here 

You know your way around my heart 
But I know you don't see well in the dark 
So I leave a light on and you won't get scared 
In the morning or even at midnight 
You can come on in its all right 
Love don't be a stranger 
Don't worry bout the danger 
Love don't be a stranger round here 

Last time you went away 
You made me cry, cry, cry 
Said I didn't need you anyway 
But I lied, lied, lied 
Love don't be a stranger 
Don't worry bout the danger 
Love don't be a stranger round here 

Love I'm a little bit smarter 
And I'll try a little bit 
This time I won't wind up in tears 
Love now that we're talking 
Maybe you'll come around more often 
Love don't be a stranger 
Don't worry about the danger 
Don't be a stranger round 

Last time you went away 
You made me cry, cry, cry 
Said I didn't need you anyway 
But I lied, lied, lied 
Love don't be a stranger 
Don't worry bout the danger 
Love don't be a stranger round here
