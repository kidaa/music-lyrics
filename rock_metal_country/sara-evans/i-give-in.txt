When I look at you
I see the souls of our unborn children
If I reach for you
Will you take my hand
Are you willing
You turn more than the music on
But will you be there by my side at the dawn
Then I'll say

[Chorus]
All right, I give in
I will dance with you just this one time
And all night
We will turn and spin
Then stand eye to eye at the sunrise
And you offer love
And it all begins when I say
All right, I give in
If I sing for you
Would it be the sweetest sound you've ever heard
And if I pray for you
Will you know that I believe in every word
You build me a house on stone
Will you promise me I'm never gonna be alone
Then I'll say...

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge]

You turn more than the music on
But will you be there by my side at the dawn
Then I say...

[Repeat Chorus]
