She's a got a Rand McAlly map 
And a tank full of gasoline 
Yeah love's been headin south 
And now she's heading out of New Orleans 
She throws her last picture out the window near the Louisiana line 
She's somewhere between dreaming and leaving old feelings behind 
As the knot comes untied 

Her heart is running scared 
She's says a silent prayer 
Lord I'm counting on you to help me get through this night 
There's memories like mountains and each one gets hard to climb 
As the knot comes untied 

On one hand she wonders if what she is doing is wrong 
Cause it sure is a long stretch of highway between goin and gone 
She's been down this road a thousand times in her mind 
But what's done is done 
She won't turn around this time 
As the knot comes untied 

Her heart is running scared 
She's says a silent prayer 
Lord I'm counting on you to help me get through this night 
There's memories like mountains and each one gets hard to climb 
As the knot comes untied 

She's got Rand McAlly map 
And a tank full of gasoline
