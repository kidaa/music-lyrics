I can't imagine, any greater fear 
Then waking up, without you here, 
And though the sun, will still shine on, 
My whole world, would all be gone, 
But not for long, 

If I had to run, if I had to crawl 
If I had to swim a hundred rivers, just to climb a thousand walls, 
Always know that I will find a way, to get to where you are, 
There's no place that far 

It wouldn't matter why we're apart, 
Lonely minds or two stubborn hearts 
Nothing short of God above 
Could turn me away from your love 
I need you that much 

If I had to run, if I had to crawl 
If I had to swim a hundred rivers, just to climb a thousand walls, 
Always know that I will find a way, to get to where you are, 
There's no place that far 

If I had to run, if I had to crawl 
If I had to swim a hundred rivers, just to climb a thousand walls, 
Always know that I will find a way, to get to where you are, 
There's no place that far 

Baby there's no place that far
