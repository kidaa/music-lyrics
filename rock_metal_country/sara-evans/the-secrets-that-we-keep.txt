Across a crowded room
I can't keep my eyes off you
You take my breath away
Looking at me now
I know what you are thinking about
You are thinking about the way
You woke me up this morning and made sweet love to me

Oh baby
I love the way you touch me
You know my body so well
You do much more to love me

Wrapped up inside of you is where I want to be
Because no body knows
No body knows
No body knows the secrets that we keep

Once we get inside these four walls
All the hesitation falls
We can't wait no more
As you help me get undressed you don't have to guess
Baby you know what I want
I want to love you til the sun comes up
Til I am sure you are satisfied

Oh baby
I love the way you touch me
You know my body so well
You do much more to love me

Wrapped up inside of you is where I want to be
Because no body knows
The secrets that we keep, yeah.

Ohh, Wrapped up inside of you
Is where I want to be
'Cause no body knows
No body knows
No body knows
No body knows
The secrets that we keep.
