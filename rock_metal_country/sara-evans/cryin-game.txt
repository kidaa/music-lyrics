Do me right don't do me wrong 
Treat me nice or I'll be gone 
I know where to find the door 
Ain't gonna play the crying game no more 
Ain't gonna play the crying game no more 

Tell me truth don't tell me lies 
Don't wanna hear no alibis 
I've been down that road before 
Ain't gonna play the crying game no more 
Ain't gonna play the crying game no more 

Give me love I can believe in 
Give me love I'm able to trust in 
Show me you are ready and willing 
To stand by me like I stand by you 

Bring me joy don't bring me pain 
I've seen enough of the pooring rain 
Show me love's what your living for 
Ain't gonna play the crying game no more 
Ain't gonna play the crying game no more 

Give me love I can believe in 
Give me love I'm able to trust in 
Show me you are ready and willing 
To stand by me like I stand by you 

Do me right don't do me wrong 
Treat me nice or I'll be gone 
I know where to find that door 
Ain't gonna play the crying game no more 
Ain't gonna play the crying game no more 
Ain't gonna play the crying game no more 
Ain't gonna play the crying game no more
