It's been so long 
I should be used to this by now 
Loneliness that keeps coming back around 
The moon on my window casts a different light 
On all these memories that keep me up tonight 

Hey, I know just what I need 
That's you and in a hurry 
If I got on the road right now 
I'd see you at four thirty 

Hey, I think I have about 
Sixty miles of gasoline left in my car 
There's an all night truck stop 
Yeah, I bet I could get that far 
I can close my eyes and smell coffee in the air 
I'll fill my cup, if you'll wait up 
I'll soon be there 

Hey, I'm letting go 
So baby don't you worry 
Wheels on ground 
I won't slow down 
I'll see you at four thirty 
Hey, I..yeah 

Hey, I won't allow my mind 
To talk me out of this 
Past every exit sign 
Cause that's the way it is 

Hey, I'm letting go 
So baby don't you worry 
Wheels on ground 
I won't slow down 
I'll see you, yeah 
Hey, I know just what I need 
That's you and in a hurry 
Oh, wheels on ground, I won't slow down 
I'll see you at four thirty
