my love 
lives out at the end of the road 
takes what you give her and goes 
says things that everyone knows
shes only willing 
to kiss me again 
lights me on fire 
sprays me with water 
and she lights me up again 
said my love 
burried my head in the sand 
screams just as loud as she can 
sings me to sleep when I cant 
shes always willing 
to kiss me again 
she wakes up the neighbors 
Goes down for water 
and then she comes up again 
I said good love 
lives on the radio dial 
never goes out of style 
makes all the children run wild 
we keep on thinking 
Strait to the end 
now its completly 
we just just shout for the moment and then we vanish again
my love 
waits at the end of the road 
takes what you give her and goes 
says things that everyone knows 
ya shes my love 
talking about my love 
ya shes my love my love my love 
shes my love
