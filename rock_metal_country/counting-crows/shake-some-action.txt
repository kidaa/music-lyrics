Shake Some Action
I will find a way 
to get to you some day.
Oh, but I, babe, 
I'm so afraid I'll fall,
yeah. Now can't you hear me call?
Shake some action's what I need 
To let me bust out at full speed.
I'm sure that's all you need 
to make it all right.
It's taken me so long
to get where I belong 
Oh, but, oh, please don't send me back that way, yeah.
For I will make you pay. refrain
if you don't dig what I say
Then I will go away. 
and I won't come back this again.
No. 'Cause I don't need a friend.
refrain
guitar solo again
