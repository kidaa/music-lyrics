Fading everything to black & blue 
You look a lot like you'd shatter 
In the blink of an eye 
But you keep sailing right on through 
Every time you say you're learning 
You just look a lot like me 
Pale under the blistering sky 
White & red black & blue 
You've been waiting a long time 
To fall down on your knees 
Cut your hands 
Cut yourself until you bleed 
But fall asleep next to me 
Wait for everyone to go away 
And in a dimly lit room
Where you got nothing to hide 
Say your goodbyes 
Tell yourself we'll read a note that says,
"I'm sorry everyone. 
I'm tired of feeling nothing. Goodbye."
Wash your face dry your eyes 
Cause you've been waiting a long time 
To fall down on your knees 
Cut your hands 
Cut yourself until you bleed 
But fall asleep next to me 
And have a dream
I'm falling down on my face 
I scrape my knees 
I scrape my hands until they bleed 
Cause you're fast asleep next to me
