Inside your plastic head you make decisions
Upon her lemon world they fall forever
break the chains that tie you to the ground and bring you too knees
shake the chains that tie you to the earth shake the chains shake the chains 
upon her willow hair the sun relaxes
she's watched all tidal waves away from your disaster
break the chains that tie you to the ground
and bind you to your mother she will bind up your hands
bind up your legs
Bind up your heart and hold you down till
you say your sorry she's been waiting for you forever now and now
Someone else's chapstick on your lips
To hide your cheery lies you make excuses 
in between each lemon breath she smiles and swallows your abuses
Shake the chains that tie you to the ground
and bind you to your mother 
she will bind up your hands
bind up your legs
Bind up your heart and hold you down till
you say your sorry she's been waiting for you forever now and now
Someone else's chapstick on your lips
Say your hungry she's lying for you forever now and now

Someone put sorry in her hand
nonononon
Say your sorry she's been waiting waiting..
Inside your plastic head
in between your laughter
you drowned in memory storms
that fall forever after
she's someone else's lipstick now
she's someone else's matchstick now
she's someone else's witchcraft now...
she's someone else's chapstick now now now.
