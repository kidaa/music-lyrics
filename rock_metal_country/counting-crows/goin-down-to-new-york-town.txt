Well I feel just like a freight train baby,
running out of steam.
I wanna go on down to New York town,
but I'm stuck in between.
And I could stay on here at home alone
and have myself to thank,
But I just made a billion dollars
and I wanna put it in the bank,
So if you call...
we could go to town.
Well dear mom, 
if you could see me now here underneath the lights
I gotta keep 'em on from dusk to dawn
and everything's alright.
I met a girl with autumn in her eyes
and summer in the way 
She makes me feel
like I was only born today or yesterday,
And if she calls...
we could go to town.
But everybody here
hates everything I say,
and girl I just don't know
if I can last another day.
So I guess I'm going back,
back where I belong,
I hope you come along
before I get back on that train that takes me...
home from New York City 
to the things I left behind
And 'though I ain't got no money girl
, I'll always have the time.
But I wish that you would hurry,
I hope you get here soon
'cause I just sold the sky to the sun
so I could buy for you the moon.
And if you call...
we could go to town. So if you call...
yeah, if you call...
girl, if you call...
we could go to town.
