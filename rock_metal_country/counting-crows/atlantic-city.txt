Well they blew up the chicken man in Philly 
last night now they blew up his house too 
Down on the boardwalk 
they're gettin' ready for a fight 
gonna see what them racket boys can do 
Now there's trouble busin' 
in from outta state and the D.A. 
can't get no relief 
Gonna be a rumble out on the promenade 
and the gamblin' commission's hangin' on by 
the skin of its teeth 
Chorus 
Well now everything dies baby that's a fact 
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back 
Put your makeup on fix your hair up pretty 
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City 
Well I got a job and tried to put my money away 
But I got debts that no honest man can pay 
So I drew what I had from the Central Trust 
And I bought us two tickets on that Coast City bus 
Chorus 
Now our luck may have died 
and our love may be cold 
but with you forever I'll stay 
We're goin' out 
where the sand's turnin' to gold 
so put on your stockin's baby `cause 
the night's getting cold 
And everything dies baby that's a fact 
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back 
Now I been lookin' for a job 
but it's hard to find 
Down here it's just winners and losers 
and don't get caught on the wrong side of that 
line 
Well I'm tired of comin' out on the losin' end
So honey last night I met this guy and 
I'm gonna do a little favor for him 
Well I guess everything dies baby that's a fact 
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back 
Put your hair up nice and set up pretty
and meet me tonight in Atlantic City 
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City 
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City
