people dying from lonely days
were walking and trying to take our souls away
Were just spending out our time angels in America slapping on a dime
Slide here for me 
get these chains away and I'm never quite free
she walks like she is on a line
angels in America trying to get things done
All on a bad day
all on a run way..
She says IM OK.
Bright lights shine in midnight
he's dying for his children looking for his life
she wonders why she's got to die
angels in America trying to hard to fly
this time well make it on or own
The forces are teeming and the guns are coming low
all on a bad day all on a bad day.
