Woke up to this morning 
staring at the ceiling
hoping for deliverance 
from the distances in you. 
this room feels like an oven 
somewhere south of no where 
north of nothing 
barely out of Tuesday 
seen seven hours of Wednesday 
And I guess got regrets 
maybe you could leave a light on 
leave a light on for me 
can you see her waiting 
there down by the sea 
with a hat on, 
with her eyes in there looking for me.
if you see me coming home turn me away 
everybody tries to go back somewhere someday
Wont you give me the distance 
52 weeks later, your still the same 
I'm standing im my basement 
making my arrangements 
waiting for the telephone 
to ring 
to ring 
to ring 
So I left for Minnesota 
where the weather is getting colder 
people are changing 
maybe you could leave a light on 
leave a light on for me 
can you see her 
waiting there down by the sea 
& how arrangements made there for welcoming me 
if you see me coming home turn me away 
everybody tries to go back somewhere someday 
And for all this distance aint going to bring you to me 
what's the point of all this patience 
its not your nature 
you just keep what you need 
and you got some pictures of me 
woke up Wendsday morning 
sometime Wednesday evening 
hoping for a piece of 
something easy to believe 
we live out on the border 
of everything and nothing 
theres nothing but waking and dreaming 
barely out of tuesday 
theres no one to receive me 
nothing is changing 
maybe you could leave a light on 
leave a light on for me 
can you see her 
waiting there down by the sea 
there's a light on but there's no body waiting for me. 
if you see me coming home turn me away 
everybody tries to go back somewhere someday 
everybody tries to go back somewhere someday 
everybody tries to go back somewhere someday 
everybody tries to go back somewhere.........
