come a little closer if you can
just forget your fears 
come to me 
cause where I want to be 
is closer to you 
put your little hand into my hand 
throw off this disquise 
come to me 
cause I just want to be 
closer to you 
I'm oh so tired of this awefull fight 
cant get by without you 
I dont know how I'm gonna be alright 
But Im all messed up 
ya im all messed up 
ya I am 
dont you wish we were younger 
these things go to fast 
come to me 
because I used to be 
closer to you 
Oo come to me cause 
I *need* to be 
closer to you
