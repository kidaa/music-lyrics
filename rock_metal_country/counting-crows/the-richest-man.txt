If I had a dollar
For every time
you broke my heart
messed up my mind
I'd be the richest man
I'd be the richest man
in the world
If bad times paid interest
I'd have you to thank
I'd be driving a new car
Have money in the bank
I'd be the richest man
I'd be the richest man
in the world
baby baby
Money cant buy love
the kind I dream of 
that's so hard to find
A good woman's touch
in the morning when I rise
baby I'd give up every single dime
Money cant buy love the kind I dream of
that's so hard to find
For a good woman's touch in the morning when I rise
baby I'd give up every single dime
If teardrops were diamonds
from the African mines
if heartaches were silver
my whole life would shine
I'd be the richest man
I'd be the richest man
in the world
baby baby... ooOOOOoooo
