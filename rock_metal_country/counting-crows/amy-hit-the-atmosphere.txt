If I could make it rain today
and wash away this sunny day down to the gutter
I would
just to get a change of pace
Things are getting worse, but I feel a lot better
and that's all that really matters to me
Well, Amy hit the atmosphere
Caught herself a rocket ride out of this gutter
and she's never coming back I fear
Anytime it rains she just feels a lot better
and that's all that really matters to me
We've waited so long
for someone to take us back home
it just takes so long
Meanwhile all the days go drifting away
and some of us sink like a stone
waiting for mothers to come
There has to be a change I'm sure
Today was just a day fading into another
and that can't be what a life is for
And anything she said well she feels a lot better
and that's all that really matters to me
We've waited so long
for someone to take us back home
It just takes so long
Meanwhile the days go drifting away
and some of us sink like a stone
waiting for mothers to come
I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know
I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know
All I really know is I wanna know
And all I really know is I don't wanna know
