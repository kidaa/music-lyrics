Get away from me
this isn't gonna be easy
but I don't need you
believe me
you got a piece of me
but it's just a little piece of me
and I don't need anyone
and these days
I feel like I'm fading away
like sometimes
when I hear myself on the radio
Have you seen me lately?
I was out on the radio 
starting to change
somewhere out in America
it's starting to rain
could you tell me
the things you remember about me
and have you seen me lately?
I remember me
and all the little things
that make up a memory
like she said 
she loved to watch me sleep
like she said,
"it's the breathing
it's the breathing in
and out and in and..." 
Have you seen me lately?
