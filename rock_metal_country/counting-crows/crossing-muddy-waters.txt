My baby's gone and I don't know why
She let out this morning 
like a rusty shot in a hollow sky 
Left me without warning 
sooner than the dogs could bark 
and faster than the sun rose 
Down to the banks in an old mule car 
she took a flatboat across the shallow 
CHORUS: 
Left me in my tears to drown 
she left a baby daughter 
Now the water's wide and deep and brown 
She's crossing muddy waters
Tobacco standing in the fields 
be rotten come November 
And a bitter heart will not reveal 
a spring that love remembers 
When that sweet brown girl of mine her black eyes are ravens 
We broke the bread and drank the wine 
from a jug that she'd been saving 
REPEAT CHORUS 
Baby's crying and the daylight's gone
That big oak tree is groaning 
In rush of wind and river of song 
I can hear my sweetheart moaning 
Crying for her baby child 
or crying for her husband 
Crying for that river's wild 
to take her from her loved ones 
REPEAT CHORUS TWICE
