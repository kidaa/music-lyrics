She can't keep away from them
Waits here and disappears
From the wrong things she intends 
Pretty soon they've got you hanging on a line
Pretty soon they string you one by one, same old rope
She says, 'I'm alright, just take me home tonight
She don't want nobody home
cause its a little too crowded there
She don't want to be alone
So they just keep pouring in
Pretty soon they've got her heading for the door
She comes home to find they cannot hang around no more
She says, 'I'm alright, just take me home tonight'
Pain won't rationalize all those alibis
and reasons that keep creeping in tonight
You're half a world away
But I just can't wash away the stain of
every single thing that you could not believe
oh well
She don't want no one around
she don't want anybody to see
what she looks like when she's down
cause the truth's a sad place to be
Pretty soon she gets them crawling up the walls
Every sunday morning the bed bleeds and you never saw 
She says, 'I'm ok, its alright, hey look what do
we want to do tonight'
She says, 'I'm alright, I just can't get home
tonight.'
