After you're gone, babies
ride the soft machine
threading the warm children
down the space between
into a slow heaven
hanging by a thread
leaving the still living
for the walking dead
It took so long
to find my way out of here
out of the warm night, to the hard light
shivering with fear
After you're gone, babies
crawling on the world
touching the souls of all the lonely
carefree boys and girls
daddy needs you
mamma feeds you
and they come until they go
but if I'm lonely, I'm the only one who knows
It took so long
to find my way out of here
out of the warm night, to the hard light
shivering with fear
after the slow lonely waiting
I'm all alone, alone and free
If you see me, please believe me
I wannna be
After you're gone, babies
screaming at the rain
hanging a slow heaven
in the wind again
She's been waiting
270 days
sick of waiting
when you see me
please believe me
I'm the only one who cares at all
[chorus] 
After the slow lonely heaven
I'm all alone, alone and free
if you see me
please believe me
I wanna be
After you're gone...
