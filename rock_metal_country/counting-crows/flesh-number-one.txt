Original by Robyn Hitchcock   The Egyptians

There's a house burning down on the radio, but
We're in luck, we don't mind, we're as far as I can tell
Everyone worries so much about themselves
There's nothing happening to you that means anything at all
There's a plane crashing down on the studio, but 
We're in luck, we're not there, so we're somewhere else instead
Everyone wishes so much upon themselves
There's not a thing that you can do that'll make me come again
There's a house burning down on the radio, but
We're in love, we don't mind, we're as far as I can tell 
Everyone worries so much about themselves
There's nothing happening to you that means anything at all
There's not a thing that you can do that'll make you live again
