It's 1:30 in the morning but that's alright by me
Weren't you just waiting by the phone?
I should give a little warning
But I need the things I need
I'm not proud to need a hand, but I just don't
understand...
So why should you come when I call?
I never say nothing at all
Why do I go when I go?
It's leaving me here all alone
You ought to get out on your own
Ain't necessarily a bad thing to believe the
things I say
Cause you can make yourself feel good
You know it's really not a good thing to give
everything to me
I'm just waiting for the show cause I got
nowhere to go
So why should you come when I call?
I never say nothing at all
Why do I go when I go?
It's leaving me here all alone
You ought to get out on your own
Cause nothing makes me feel so good
Or gets me high so I sleep at night
And let's me know that everything's alright
I feel nice
I'm so sorry in the morning
You can believe what you believe
I'm used to waking up alone
And if you think about it
Anyone you think about is better love than me
But if you're not fallen quite asleep
I might call tonight
If that's alright...
Why should you come when I call?
I never say nothing at all
Why do I go when I go?
It's leaving me here all alone
You ought to get out on your own
