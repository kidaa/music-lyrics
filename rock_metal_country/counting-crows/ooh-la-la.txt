Poor old granddad I laughed at all his words
I thought he was a bitter man
He spoke of women's ways
They'll trap you then they use you   before you even know
For love is blind and you're far too kind
Don't ever let it show
I wish that I knew what I know now
when I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
when I was stronger
The can-can such a pretty show
will steal your heart away
But backstage back on earth again
The dressing rooms are grey
They come on strong and it ain't too long
For they make you feel a man
But love is blind and you soon will find
you're just a boy again
When you want her lips, you get her cheek
Makes you wonder where you are
if you want some more then she's fast asleep
Leaves you twinkling with the stars
Poor young grandson there's nothing I can say
You'll have to learn, just like me
And that's the hardest way, ooh la la
I wish that I knew what I know now
when I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
when I was stronger
