I'm an outcast that no one can save anymore 
and the days of my youth, have all long gone by now 
I was the kind of boy the devil would offer a smoke or a drink to 
or a ride downtown to some God forsaken land 

One Sunday morning at dawn you know they baptized my soul 
but they held me down so long Christ I almost drowned 
Yeah I was the kind of boy who never learned to smile 
so I kicked and I screamed 
'till I tore myself lose from all these great big hands Oh Yeah 

Chorus: 
Wiseblood knows how to walk the way the wind blows 
Wiseblood hears grace whisper right behind 

My mommma, she turned around and said 
 Little boy you better wake up....cause your a walking dead  
Oh she was the kind a girl who never touched a smoke or a drink 
she just smoldered like an empty church left to burn in the wind
