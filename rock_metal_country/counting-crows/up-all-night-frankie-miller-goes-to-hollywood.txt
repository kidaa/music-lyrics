Is everybody happy now
Is everybody clear
We could drive out to the dunes tonight,
'cause summer's almost here.
And I've been up all night,
I might sleep all day.
Get your dreams just right
Let them slip away,
I might sleep all day.
When the roads are clear,
We'll head on out of here,
If you're coming back, 
I'll see you in the morning
I'm just staring at
the ceiling staring back at me,
Just waiting for the daylight to come crawling in on me...
And I've been up all night,
I might sleep all day.
Get your dreams just right
And let them slip away,
I might sleep all day.
Ohhh...It's too late to get high now.

fix your hair just right
Put your jeans on tight,
Wear a dress, so I can get it off real easy.
'Cause I've been thinking I'd
like to see your eyes
open up real wide the minute that you see me.
If you don't come through,
I wouldn't wait for you.
I understand that everyone goes disappearing,
into the greatest grey
that covers over everyday,
and hovers in the distance and the distance and the distance...
I've been up all night,
I might sleep all day.
Get your dreams just right
let them slip away,
I might sleep all day.
Ohh...It's too late to get high now.
[2X]
Baby I'm not alone
only wanna get high
