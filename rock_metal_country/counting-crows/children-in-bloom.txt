Children in bloom cooking in the sun
waiting for a room of our own
leave my sister alone 
she don't deserve this 
she is a flower and I am a flower and 
we are all alone
I gotta get out on my own 
I gotta get up from this waiting at home 
I gotta get out of this sunlight
It's melting my bones
I gotta get up from this slumber
and get myself home All these wasted dreams
waiting for the sun 
to open up my heart to anyone
bring me some rain 
because i'm dying 
and i can't get this damn thing closed again 
I gotta get out on my own
I gotta get up from this waiting at home
I gotta get out of this sunlight
It's melting my bones
I gotta get up from this slumber
and get myself home
Where's the funhouse this year?
the fairground's deserted
and the skies don't seem as near
Nicole's my oldest friend
but the altar is empty
and she'll never be a little girl again 
I gotta get out on my own
I gotta get up from this waiting at home
I gotta get out of this sunlight
It's melting my bones
I gotta get up from this slumber
and get myself home
I can't find my way home
