If anything 
it should have been 
a better thing 
From underneath you 
staring at the ceiling 
There's another world 
of chocolate bars and baseball cards 
That hides inside of all 
this tension that I'm feeling 
But It's all inside of you 
Yeah, it's all inside of you 
Surprise surprise 
I miss your hair, you miss my eyes 
And all this solitude 
is my confidence eroding 
So we slide inside of 
someone's mouth and someone's eyes 
Until there's a sound 
of something intimate exploding 
But it's all inside of you 
Yeah, it's all inside of you [3X] I wish that I was anesthetized 
and sterilized and then 
we wouldn't have this evidence congealing 
Surprise surprise, 
another pair of lips and eyes 
And that is the consequence 
of actually feeling 
It was all inside of you [4X]
