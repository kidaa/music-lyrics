Miracle people with marvelous hair
And a knack to do anything better than anyone
I got a home with electrical air
And I live in a world smaller than anyone's
But I got a line on the new frontier
I got a line on the new America
All of the people are vanishing here
I could be huge if I could just get
From the outside of everything
To the inside of you
Purest Aluminum people are walking
The streets of London
So hysterical
Nobody here gets a word that I say
And the problems, I'm told, are more
than medical But I got a friend from the new frontier
And Galen, she says,
"This is not America
You need a girl with electrical hair.
And the word that you wanted was
aluminium."
From the outside of everything
To the inside of you
I was in bed with the girl at the end of the world
She said "I'm going home.
You should come home too."
But I'm at the end of the new frontier
Here at the edge of the flat earth ending
I'm getting off to get lost in the air
At the end of the world
Where the light is bending
From the outside of everything
To the inside of you
