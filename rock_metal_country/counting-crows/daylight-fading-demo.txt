Sunday morning paper dated 1992
There are cowboys in my kitchen
empty bottles on the roof
I've been trying to quit these cigarettes
I've been trying to think its true
Maybe she's gone to California
maybe Ill go out there too
Daylight fading come and waste another year
all the anger and the elegance are bleeding into fear
moonlight creeping round the corners of our lawn
when she sees the early signs of daylight fading
she leaves just before its gone
Daddy's on the rooftop with his fingers in
the gun and I am waiting at the window I am 
waiting for the one
Shying in that paper when she walked into my room I said I want to 
say good-bye to you good-bye to all my friends good-bye to everyone I know
Daylight fading come and waste another year
all the anger and the elegance are bleeding into fear
moonlight creeping round the corners of our lawn
when she sees the early signs of daylight fading
she leaves just before its gone
Daylight fading come and waste another year
all the anger and the elegance are bleeding into fear
moonlight creeping round the corners of our lawn
when she sees the early signs of daylight fading
she leaves just before its gone
