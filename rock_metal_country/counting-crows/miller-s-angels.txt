Miller's angels in black and white
Welcome everyone in
Children dreaming of wrong and right
Wrapped in grace and in sin

 They come out of the blue sky
They come out of the blue
They come out of the blue sky 
But you never know where they're gonna go
Hey romeo

 Miller's fingers are traveling down the length of her thigh
But Miller's mind is still wandering
Staring up at the sky

 They come out of the blue sky
They come out of the blue
They come out of the blue sky
But you never know where they're gonna go
Hey romeo

 Don't come around here

 Miller's angels are hovering in between the earth and the sun
In the shadow of god's unwavering love 
I am a fortunate son

 They come out of the blue sky
They come out of the blue
They come out of the blue sky
But you never know where they're gon na go
Hey romeo

 for Sean & me
