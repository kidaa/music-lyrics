She had four white stallions coming around the bend
Four strong angels at her command descend
four more seasons for all that's broken to mend
I got four more reasons why I
can't go back there again
She had skin like a statue
milky white and pure
carved by an artist
who's hand is demure
Got a mind I like a saber
razor sharp and sure
God how I hate myself
for still wanting her...
Damn these nights are dreaming..
Visions soft and sure
Cause I wake to find there's
nothing left of me in her..
Nothing more than a heart still at war..
She had four white stallions coming around the bend..
Four strong angels already sinned
I got four good reasons for all that's broken to mend..
I got four more seasons for all that's broken to mend..
I got four more reasons why I cant go back there again..
I got four good reasons why I cant go back there again.
