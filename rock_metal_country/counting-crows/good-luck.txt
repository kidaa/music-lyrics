Larry's in vegas..with some chick from La
the best things are sevens and sex is just ok so please stay 
she said just stay
cause there's a show at 11 and the drinks are all free you can do 
better for yourself but not me ....
...so please stay and keep me company.
All the while thinking this is the good luck, stays with her most of the time
takes time to make these machines work, people are so unkind
Gets kinda nervous
used to be hard.
She takes the edges off evenings in bedrooms and back seats in big cars.
All the while thinking this is the good luck stays with her most of the time
it takes time to make these machines work people are so unkind.
People are so unkind
She looks in the mirror
to make she's here
she keeps disappearing and dreaming of movie stars- weddings and nothing is happening
He tries not to notice
She thinks he doesn't care.
Capture yourself in a jar and you stay there, 
until you vanish
thin air
all the while thinking this is the good luck stays with her most of the time
it takes time to make these machines work but he aint got time while 
she's riding in black cars and pokes at the sky to see if he can make stars and 
people are so unkind
people are so unkind..
People are so unkind..
People are so unkind...
people are so unkind
People are so..
UN
KIND..
