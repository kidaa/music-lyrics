A man in my shoes runs a light
All the papers lie tonight
But falling over you
is the news of the day
Angels fall like rain
and love , is all of heaven way
inside you the time moves and she don't fade
the ghost in you she don't fade away
The race is on, I'm on your side
but hearing you my engines died
I'm in the mood for you
or for running away
All the stars come down in you
but love, love, love you cant give it away
Inside you the time moves and she don't fade
the ghost in you she don't fade
Inside you the time moves and she don't fade away
don't you know she don't fade
don't you go it makes no sense
And all these talking superman
just take away the time just to get it away
aint it just like the rain
cause love,love,love,love is only heaven away
Inside you the time moves and she don't fade
the ghost in you she don't fade away
Inside you the time moves and she don't fade away
the ghost in you she don't fade
A man in my shoes runs a light
but all the papers lie tonight 
falling over you is the news of the day
and love will not fade away
and love love love will not fade away
