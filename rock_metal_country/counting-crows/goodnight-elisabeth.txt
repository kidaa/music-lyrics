I was wasted in the afternoon
waiting on a train
I woke up in pieces and elisabeth 
had disappeared again
I wish you were inside of me
I hope that you're ok
I hope you're resting quietly
I just wanted to say
goodnight elisabeth
we couldn't all be cowboys
so some of us are clowns
and some of us are dancers on the midway
we roam from town to town
I hope that everybody 
can find a little flame me, I say my prayers,
then I just light myself on fire
and I walk out on the wire once again 
and I say
goodnight elisabeth
I will wait for you in Baton Rouge
I'll miss you down in New Orleans 
I'll wait for you 
while she slips in something comfortable
and I'll miss you
when I'm slipping in between
if you wrap yourself in daffodils
I will wrap myself in pain
and if you're the queen of california
baby I am the king of the rain
and I say
goodnight elisabeth
