She comes out on Fridays every time 
Stands out in a line 
I could've been anyone she'd seen 
She waits another week to fall apart 
She couldn't make another day 
I wish it was anyone but me 
It could've been anyone you see 
She had something breakable just under her skin 
American girls, all weather & noise 
Playing the changes for all of the boys 
Holding a candle up to my hand 
Making me feel so incredible 
She comes out of closets every night 
But then she locks herself away 
Where she could keep everything from me
I could have been anyone you see
She's nothing but porcelain underneath her skin 
American girls, all weather & noise 
Playing the changes for all of the boys 
Holding a candle up to my hand 
Making me feel so incredible 
Little shivers shaking me every day
But I could get the same thing anywhere
So if she goes away
Well it's alright and I'm okay
"Hey", she said, "Come back again tonight"
I said, "I might I might I might"
She said, "Well that's alright
If it's alright with you, then it's alright with me"
I waited for an hour last Friday night 
She never came around 
She took almost everything from me 
I'm going through my closets 
Trying on her clothes almost everyday 
I could've been anyone you see 
I wish it was anyone but me 
Theres nothing but pills and ashes under my skin 
American girls, all weather & noise 
Playing the changes for all of the boys
Holding a candle right up to my hand 
Making me feel so incredible 
If I made you cry, please tell me why 
Cause I'll try again if you let me try 
American girls all feathers & cream 
Come into bed so edible
