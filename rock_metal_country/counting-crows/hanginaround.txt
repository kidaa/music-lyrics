She sat right down on the sofa I said,"Where have you been? I've been waiting for
you. Cause last night I had something so good These days get so long and I got
nothing to do" I been hanginaround this town on the corner I been bummin' around
this old town so long I been hanginaround this town on the corner I been bummin'
around this old town for way too long We spend all day getting sober Just hiding
from daylight Watching TV We just look a lot better in the blue light Well, you know
I gotta get out But I'm stuck so tight Weighed by the chains that keep me...
hanginaround this town on the corner I been bummin' around this old town too long I
been hanginaround this town on the corner I been bummin' around this old town for
way too long And this girl listens to the band play She says "where have you been?
I've been lyin right here on the floor" Well, I got all this time To be waiting for
what is mine To be hating what I am After the light has faded hanginaround this town
on the corner I been bummin' around this old town so long I been hanginaround this
town on the corner I been bummin' around this old town for way, way, way, way, way
too long
