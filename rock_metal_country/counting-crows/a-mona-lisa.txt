I Heard my Lisa say
"I can't believe you could leave me looking this way."
When ever music plays... I smile and I can't feel anything
all I want to say..All I want to say
is everything's all right and I'm OK
Heard my Lisa today
"say he wants to paint the same me every single day"
"what's wrong with him anyway"
cuz sometimes I can't feel anything
all I want to say..All I want to say
is everything's all right and I'm ok.. I'm OK
My body's mapped before me.. 
On a flying carpet through the sky
The same things that destroy me...
we'll hang there waiting for me upon a wall outside of me yeah. 
Heard my Lisa say
"god blesses the same things every single day."
How'd he miss me anyway 7 days and I can't feel anything.
My paint is smeared upon his wall..
Its a portrait we are 4 feet tall.. Just Leanardo passing days 
with a Mona Lisa cant feel anything. All I want to say..All I want to say
is everything's all right and I'm OK all I want to say....all I want to say
is everything's all right and I'm OK [7X]
