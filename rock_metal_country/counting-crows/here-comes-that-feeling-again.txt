here comes that feeling again 
you're always around me 
this island life never ends 
it just circles inside me 
and when we're older 
we'll go back to being friends 
but oh, 
here comes that feeling again 
i better get away from all these 
oh-so-familar places that i see 
i gotta find a place without so many 
familar faces in front of me 
when i wake up in the morning 
and there's no one there but me 
i'll remember 
i'll remember 
here comes that feeling again 
you're always around me 
this island life never ends 
it just circles inside me 
and when we're older 
we'll go back to being friends 
but oh, 
here comes that feeling again 
gotta keep on moving through these 
distances between yesterday and now 
as if all this riding on these white lines 
will make them fade away somehow 
do you try not to remember 
the things you cannot forget 
and are you sorry for what hasn't happened yet 
i stare at everyone 
it makes me wonder why 
i can't see anyone but you 
maybe change 
and all these faces 
reappear in different places 
and i can't see a thing but you 
here comes that feeling again 
you're always around me 
this island life never ends 
it just circles inside me 
and when we're older 
we'll go back to being friends 
but oh, 
here comes that feeling again
