I hear mariachi static on my radio 
And the tubes, they glow in the dark 
And I'm there with you in Ensenada 
And I'm here in Echo Park 
Carmelita, hold me tighter. 
I think I'm sinkin' down. 
And I'm all strung out on heroin 
on the outskirts of town. 
Well, I pawned my Smith and Wesson, 
and I went to meet my man. 
He hangs out down on Alvarado Street, 
at the Pioneer Chicken stand 
back to chorus 
Well, I'm sittin' here playin' solitaire 
with my pearl handled deck. 
The county won't give me no more methadone 
and they cut off your welfare check 
back to chorus
