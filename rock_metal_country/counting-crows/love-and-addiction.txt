Put on your bad self 
get out your party dress and fix up your makeup try 
to make a good impression this is a new world - 
were all the same here, well maybe not the same you know what I mean. 
I've got everything that you want I've got everything and someday Ill be president. 
I've for everything that you want.. 
I've got everything except the single thing you really need. 
Separate, love from addiction its not the same I know 
I see desperation pulling my strings. Hey eliza now what do you want 
I play piano and I sing like a humming bird and oh I forgot 
that humming birds don't sing, it doesn't matter really you know what I mean. 
I've got everything that you want I've got everything 
and its a brand new world eliza. I've got everything that you want.. 
I've got everything except the single thing you really need. 
Sail away blood and rejection ..they isolate. 
I know I see, a generation staring back at me.. 
Wasted away.... 
wasted my time this picture you see is nothing like the one 
I wanted painted of me. 
"Eliza says it's all right with me, if your sure ... 
it wouldn't be the first time, you know it's happened a couple of times before 
and.. I don't even expect much anymore and anyway... 
it's not as if I was waiting for you to come and make it all okay". 
Shut away to to wing blood and rejection they isolate 
I know I see visions of people grabbing hold of me. 
Wasted away... wasted my time... 
this picture you see is nothing like the one I wanted painted of me. 
Put on your bad self, get out your party dress and fix up your makeup try 
and make a good impression..
