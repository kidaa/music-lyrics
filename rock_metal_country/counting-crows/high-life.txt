Such a life
Such a life
Such a life
"such a life, such a life,such a life,
I'm a comet common, uncommon.. honestly 
I don't know why" 
All my friends got flowers in their eyes
But I got none this season
All of last year's blooms have gone and died
Time doesn't give a reason
well hey maybe you ask yourself
Sometimes what you need to be forgiven
Everything that you ever done wrong
Is the reason that I'm driven
Straight to tears
Waiting here for you
Wanting to tell you
How I get me ends and my beginnings mixed up, too
Just the way you do
I thought if I told you
You might want to stay for just another day or two
It's just like answers that come in small packages that go in the mail
Waiting for the trains that just never come
Beginning to believe in 
The disappearing nature of the people we have been
We have begun to change
Into the worst kind of people
So unkind Oh apologies
No apologies
This apology doesn't describe
The way it feels to feel for you
Waiting here for you
Wanting to tell you
How I find myself slowly disappearing, too
Just the way you do
I thought if I told you
You might want to help me to remain with you
I just wanna stay for a little while
I wanna stay a little while
Oh, come on [4 times]
Cause there's a night life just falling down on me
I just feel like a change
Beneath the sun in the summer a sea of flowers
Won't bloom without the rain
But oh this desert life
This high life
Here at the dying end of the day
I wasn't made for the scene, baby
But I was made in this scene, baby
It's just my way
I don't wanna go home alone
I wanna come on home to you
Waiting here for you
Wanting to tell you
How I line my sky with all the silver I can use
Just the way you do
I thought if I told you
You might want to stay for just another day or two
[whispering-like]
Isn't that just like disappearing into the sum of yourself
and the person you are disappearing into
it's like one plus one equals nothing at all
one plus two equals nothing at all
one plus me equals nothing at all
one plus you equals one plus you equals you equals
you and you and you and
nothing at all [repeated 10 times]
