Maybe I didn't treat you 
quite as good as I should have 
Maybe I didn't love you 
quite as often as I could have 
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind 
You were always on my mind 
Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died 
Give me, give me one more chance
to keep you satisfied, satisfied 
Maybe I didn't hold you 
all those lonely, lonely times 
And I guess I never told you 
I'm so happy that you're mine 
If I make you feel second best 
girl, I'm sorry I was blind 
You were always on my mind 
You were always on my mind 
Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died 
Give me, give me one more chance 
to keep you satisfied, satisfied 
Little things I should have said and done 
I just never took the time 
You were always on my mind 
You are always on my mind 
You are always on my mind
