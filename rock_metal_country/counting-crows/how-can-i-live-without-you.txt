You can still come and make me coffee in the morning
You can still come and cook me chicken fried steak
You can live your life with whomever you please to, 
As long as someone takes good care of me 
you know I don't mind. 
How can I live without you 
if it means I gotta get a job? 
You could still come, bring me those fancy pastries. 
You can still come round, crawl into my bed. 
You can live your life with whomever you please to, 
as long as someone takes good care of me 
you know I don't mind. 
How can I live without you 
if it means I gotta get a job?
