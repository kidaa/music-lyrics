Is everybody happy now
Is everybody clear
We could drive out to the dunes tonight
Because summer's almost here
I've been up all night
I might sleep all day
Get your dreams just right
Then let 'em slip away
I might sleep all day...
And when the roads are clear
You head on out of here
And if you're coming back 
I'll see you in the morning
I'm just staring at
The ceiling staring back at me
Just waiting for daylight
To come crawling in on me
I've been up all night
I might sleep all day
Get your dreams just right
Then let 'em slip away
I might sleep all day...
It's too late to get high now
Fix your hair just right
Put your jeans on tight
Or wear a dress so I can get it off real easy
I been thinking I'd like to see 
Your eyes open up real wide 
The minute that you see me
But if you don't come through
I wouldn't wait for you
I understand that everyone goes disappearing
Into the greater grey that covers over everyday
And hovers in the distance...
I've been up all night
I might sleep all day
Get your dreams just right
Then let 'em slip away
I might sleep all day...
It's too late to get high now
