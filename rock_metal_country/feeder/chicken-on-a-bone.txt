Follow the river
Wallow in silver
Voices draw nearer
I'm counting out the day's wage

Let it be known, lettin' it out
Let it be known, lettin' it out

See it so near, it seems so far
It's when you're here, It's where you are
See it so clear

Making my head spin
Watching the world sing
Holding me under
Try and get a hold son

Let it be known, lettin' it out
Let it be known, lettin' it out

See it so near, it seems so far
It's when you're here, it's where you are
See it so clear

Pale and wanton
Dreams forgotten
No use crying
I feel like chicken on a bone, chicken on a bone

See it so near, it seems so far
It's when you're here, it's where you are
See it so clear

Lettin' it out
Oh, let it be known, let it be known
Lettin' it out, Lettin' it out, Lettin' it out
Let it be known, let it be known
Lettin' it out, Lettin' it out, Lettin' it out
Hello, hello, hello..

Let it be known, let it be known
Lettin' it out, Lettin' it out, Lettin' it out
Let it be known, let it be known
Lettin' it out, Lettin' it out, Lettin' it out
