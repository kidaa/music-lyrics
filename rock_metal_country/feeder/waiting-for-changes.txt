Office blocks, corner shops, traffic jams on every street, The same old rush around 
Obsolete, I'm a freak, In a show on Brighton beach, As the snow comes down
Reality's kicking me, Knocking me right off my feet, As the sky spins round
We're waiting for changes
Rejected and dented
We're waiting for changes
The lights green but today's red
Laundry stops, by the lock, On a Sunday afternoon, With all that fuss
Cantelowes skateboard shows, tennants Extra by a row of recycle bins
We're waiting for changes
Rejected and dented
We're waiting for changes
The lights green but today's red
We're waiting for changes
Different perspectives
We're waiting for changes
The lights green but today's red
Take a ride to Charing Cross, Join the masses as they shop, Their lives away
29's the northern line, Heading back to lose our minds, To break the chain
We're waiting for changes
Rejected and dented
We're waiting for changes
The lights green but today's red
We're waiting for changes
Different perspectives
We're waiting for changes
The lights green but today's dead
I'm waiting for changes
I'm waiting for changes
I'm waiting for changes
I'm waiting for changes.
