Reading the words she sent today
Feeling my capsize
Gazing at photographs of you
Hearing the baby cry
Then watching his mother try to soothe
Living the terminal lies
Hoping my dreams come true tonight

Getting to know you well Getting to know you well
Just wish I could break your shell
I'm getting to know you well Getting to know you well
I think we might be okay

Chewing on ice cream cones
Seeing the sun shine down to you
Out in a rowing boat
Seeing the seagull spy for food
Pulling the daisy chains
Losing myself again with you
Wish it could stay like this
Cause yesterday went away too soon

Getting to know you well Getting to know you well
Just wish I could break your shell
I'm getting to know you well Getting to know you well
I think we might be okay
Getting to know you well Getting to know you well
Just wish I could break that shell
I'm getting to know you well Getting to know you well
I think we might be okay

Trying hard to find a reason
With every step I take I'm sinking
I wish that I could say I'm coming
With every breath I'm choking

Waking up late today
Sleeping in clothes that stick to you
Hearing the plane fly by
Staring at paper clouds and hills

Getting to know you well Getting to know you well
Just wish I could break your shell
I'm getting to know you well Getting to know you well
I think we might be okay
Getting to know you well Getting to know you well
Just wish I could break that shell
I'm getting to know you well Getting to know you well
I think we might be okay
