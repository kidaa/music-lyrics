Would it always be the same 
Give it all to reason 
Let me down 
You watch me drown 
Hold me down I can't explain 
Though I never could - that's the problem 
Fight about the plate again, 
Climbing up to free myself. 
I don't need this 
Innovation comes 
Do you really know 
I'm falling 
I just fall into shade 
All I wanna do is pray 
Give me back the freedom 
If it comes the only way 
Clearance sets me free 
... twist and turn 
Looking at the same thing 
Flicking back the pages 
Just enough for me to see myself 
I don't need this 
Innovation comes 
Do you really know 
I'm trying to believe 
As life turns on 
Do you see it 
Do you really know 
I'm falling 
I will fall into space 
As funny though it seems 
That I can dream a little 
It's pulling me inside 
The wheels still turn 
...as the sun 
Touch my face 
...back home 
I don't need this 
Innovation comes, 
I'm trying to believe 
As life drags on 
Do you see it 
Do you really know 
I'm falling
