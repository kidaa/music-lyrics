Get away from me and so she said 
You're like a social disease 
I'm so tired of being afraid of you 
...... she sees
Save yourself look and see 
Think about it, sweet sixteen 
You could be anywhere 
See yourself standing there 
She's my death She's my death 
He can't stop imposing himself on her 
He likes the way that she is 
His heart beats, fingers all over her 
His dirty breath smells of beer 
Save yourself look and see 
Think about it, sweet sixteen 
You could be anywhere 
See yourself standing there 
She's my death She's my death 
Come a little closer to me 
Come a little nearer come on 
She works late so she can keep away 
Too scared to go to the police 
So young he's working her like a dog 
One day while she was searching there 
She came across a new toy 
Her eyes filled as she loaded the weapon 
Her mind racing she cries 
Save yourself look and see 
Think about it, sweet sixteen 
You could be anywhere 
See yourself standing there 
Save yourself look and see 
Think about it, sweet sixteen 
She's my death 
She's my death 
Death 
She's my death 
Death
