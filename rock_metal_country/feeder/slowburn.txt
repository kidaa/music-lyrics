Biting down, feeling the pressure again 
It's no more than we deserve, eyes closed to collect sun 
Tearing it down, burning bridges away 
There's no return now, leaving home today 

We turn to face the storm 
Just a sign of life to bring us home 

Turning around, trying to face the strange 
It's no more than we deserve, no more words to say 
Coming around, there's no distance to go 
Lying face down on the floor, reaching out for something new 

We turn to face the storm 
Just a sign of life to bring us home 
We burn to face the storm 
We lose everything and everyone 

Farther... Slower... 

We burn to face the storm 
We lose everything and everyone 
We turn to face the storm 
Just a sign of life to bring us home 
We burn to face the storm 
We lose everything and everyone
