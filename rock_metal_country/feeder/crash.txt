I put my best foot first & it got burned, 
Communication always hurts, 
I got myself so deep inside a hole,
I taste the air so thin as i get old.
I don't think so

[CHORUS]
She's my hands, She's my hands.
Picks me up when i crash down, 
Build me wings so i can glide,
She's my novacaine ride.
NOVACAINE!

Pick up the pieces of my world, 
Glue them together, i wish i could, 
I can't believe it as the picture fades, 
Just like a TV but the sound remains
I don't think so no i don't think so

[CHORUS]

Feel it as i shake, 
Shatter illusions fade, 
Taste my bitter tears, 
Cut my heart with shears.

I don't think so, i don't think so.

[CHORUS]

She's my hands, she's my hands, 
Picks me up when i crash down.

NOVACAINE.
