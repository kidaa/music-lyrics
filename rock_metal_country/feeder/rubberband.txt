Jumping into streams of nectar
Falling through these clouds of silver
Reaching for these angel's faces
Waking up in fields of feathers
It's tied me up inside, it's tied me up inside
Got to pull myself together
It's tied me up inside, it's tied me up inside

You spin me around, you lift me right off the ground
You twist me around, I feel like a rubberband
You spin me around, then you wind me back up
Cause I'm your rubberband

Crashing onto cotton waterfalls
Breaking my fall if I latch on
Wrapped up in these arms of velvet
Drifting in a sea of regret
It's tied me up inside, it's tied me up inside
Got to pull myself together
It's tied me up inside, it's tied me up inside

You spin me around, you lift me right off the ground
You twist me around, I feel like a rubberband
You spin me around, then you wind me back up
Cause I'm your rubberband

I wish I knew what to stay
The words escaped me today
I wish I knew what to say
Just take away the pain

Jumping into streams of nectar
Got to pull it back together
It's tied me up inside, it's tied me up inside
It's tied me up inside, it's tied me up inside
You spin me around, you lift me right off the ground
You twist me around, I feel like a rubberband
You spin me around, then you wind me back up
Cause I'm your rubberband

You spin me around, you lift me right off the ground
You twist me around, I feel like a rubberband
You spin me around, then you wind me back up
Cause I'm your rubberband

You spin me around, you lift me right off the ground
You twist me around, I feel like a rubberband
You spin me around...
