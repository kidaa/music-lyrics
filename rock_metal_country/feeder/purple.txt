I think I'm coming round
Coming round to a way of thinking now
Trying to find the ground
Somewhere new to stop us slipping
Always, always straight back down

Kicking out the fool
There's no sense in us going under now
Holding on to you
Trying to swim but we're treading water
Always, always straight back down

I think that you're the one
The color never runs
A hand that heals me over, over today
You take away the grey
Bring the color as it fades
A hand that heals me over, over

Comfort in the sound
Lift the world from off your shoulders now
Lying on the ground
Staring up at a face that haunts you
Always, always straight back down

Reaching out a hand
Course there's no life without the purple
Always, always straight back down

I think that you're the one
The color never runs
A hand that heals me over, over today
You take away the grey
Bring the color as it fades
A hand that heals me over, over

Always, always straight back down
I think I'm coming rround
Coming round to a way of thinking
Always, always straight back down

I think that you're the one
The color never runs
A hand that heals me over, over today
You take away the grey
Bring the color as it fades
A hand that heals me over, over again

I think that you're the one
The color never runs
A hand that heals me over, over today
You take away the grey
Bring the color as it fades
A hand that heals me over, over
