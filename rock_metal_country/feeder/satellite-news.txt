Sending it all right back
Waiting for heart attacks
Watching the days collide
Changing with the weather
Trying to keep it clear
Slither on broken tears
Searching for ways to cure
Who will make it better

Cause you will never keep me down
You can never keep me down

I wanna lift myself up to the sky
Serenade the stars as I pass by
Wanna leave it all just for a while
I'll be satellite news
I wanna lift myself above the clouds
Cut the ropes around me, you'll see me shine
Shine like the sun

Conditioned compatible youth
TV and comfort foods
Sending back down the news
They're hoping that it's better

Cause you will never keep me down
You can never keep me down

I wanna lift myself up to the sky
Serenade the stars as I pass by
Wanna leave it all just for a while
I'll be satellite news
I wanna lift myself above the clouds
Cut the ropes around me, you'll see me shine, shine
Shine like the sun

I'll shine like the sun
Yeah, I'll shine like the sun
I'll shine like the sun, shine like the sun

I wanna lift myself up to the sky
Serenade the stars as I pass by
Wanna leave it all just for a while

Cause you will never keep me down
You can never keep me down

I wanna lift myself up to the sky
Serenade the stars as I pass by
Wanna leave it all just for a while
I'll be satellite news
I wanna lift myself above the clouds
Cut the ropes around me, you'll see me shine
You'll see me shine
Shine like the sun

I wanna lift myself up to the sky
Serenade the stars as I pass by
Wanna leave it all just for a while
I'll be satellite news
I wanna lift myself above the clouds
Cut the ropes around me, you'll see me shine, shine
Shine like the sun
