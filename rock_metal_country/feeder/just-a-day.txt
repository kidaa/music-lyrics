Waking up at twelve in my clothes again 
Feel my head explode from a night of gin 
Another night out late 
I don't want to drink don't want to be a clown 
I got to get my feet back on the ground 
Before it pulls me in 

How come it ended up like this 
And who's gonna catch me when I'm coming down to hit the ground again 

All by myself waking up at 12 in my clothes again 
Cause I don't want to drag you down hold you down 
Cause you're a friend, I blame myself feel my head explode from a night of gin 
I guess you think it's funny now, funny now 

On the underground with the freaks and frowns 
Looking at the world through silver clouds 
But then it all came down 
I've got to rise above the emotional flood 
I've got to cut these ropes around my hands 
Pull myself around 

How come it ended up like this 
And who's gonna be there when I've lost control I'm heading to crashland 

All by myself waking up at 12 in my clothes again 
Cause I don't want to drag you down, hold you down 
Cause you're a friend I blame myself feel my head explode from a night of gin 
I guess you think it's funny now, funny now 

All by myself, cause I don't want to drag you down, 
Hold you down cause you're a friend. I blame myself 
I guess you think it's funny now, funny now, it's such a shame 

All by myself waking up at 12 in my clothes again 
Cause I don't want to drag you down, hold you down, 
Cause you're a friend. I blame myself feel my head explode from a night of gin 
I guess you think it's funny now, funny now, it's such a sin 

All by myself waking up at 12 in my clothes again 
Cause I don't want to drag you down, hold you down 
Cause you're a friend I blame myself feel my head explode from a night of gin 
I guess you think it's funny now, funny now.
