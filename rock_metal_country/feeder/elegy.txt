Summer breeze, kisses me
Autumn leaves retire
Apathy, breaking free
Still waiting for the sun

See me as I wait
See me wait
I can't see another
See me wait
Forever

Reach a plea, honey feed
Open, feel like fire
Turning red, above my head
Reaching to recover

See me as I wait
See me wait
I can't see another
See me wait
I can't end another

Open your arms See me wait
Just see how it is Another
Open your arms See me wait
Just see how it is, see how it is Another
Open your arms
Just see how it is Another
Reaching again See me wait
Just see how it is Another
