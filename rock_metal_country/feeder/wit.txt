She's looking good in a new towel,
Looking clear in the new crowd,
She's so funny to be with,
So easy to forgive

See you, you see me,
We could be free,
I'll let you know

"Women in towels"
Take a look at the old suits,
Hanging around in the old school,
She's looking good with her hair down,
Feeling high in the fairground
See you, you see me
We could be free,
You've gotta live
So you could breathe
I wish you could just see yourself,
No shame, in pain again

"Women in towels"
"Life is work"
"It's not what you are, it's what you do"

See you, you see me
We could be free,
You've gotta live
So you could breathe
I wish you could just see yourself,
No shame, in pain again
"Women in towels"
