Searching through broken pieces
Same old news, the more I bleed
Crucified again, the more we choose
Sacrificed again, the more we lose

But he said
I will be there if you will come
To give myself, to save my soul
I will be there if you believe
The more I wait, the more I bleed
The more I bleed

Twisted hands, worn and broken
See the man, across the heat
Holding back the blade, he can believe
Reaching out again for somethign real

He said
I will be there if you will come
To give myself, to save my soul
I will be there if you believe
The more I wait, the more I bleed

Cause I am alive Alive, alive...
Can't open my eyes and see
Look up to they sky and breathe again,
Back's to me
Fill the spaces
Still I hope to be
Undivided

You don't see it
I can't see it

I will be there if you will come
To give myself, to save my soul
I will be there if you believe
The more I wait, the more I bleed
I will be there if you will come Look up to they sky
To give myself, to save my soul You're so far high, again
I will be there if you believe Look up to the sky and see
The more I wait, the more I bleed Alive, alive...
I will be there if you will come
To give myself, to save my soul
I will be there if you believe
The more I wait, the more I bleed
