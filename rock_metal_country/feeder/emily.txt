Gotta learn how to think
Cause I'm drowning in sin
Just wanna taste that cinnamon skin
I've gotta learn how to cry
Taste the tear roll by
Cause there's no sense in self destruction

Emily loved him
Emily loved him

You cut away the disease
You pure the air that I breathe
You came and healed my disease again
Now the light comes shining in

I've gotta learn how to drink
Without the alcohol swings
I'm sure that things will feel better
Gotta learn how to grow
Lift the world off your toes
Feel yourself drift off to somewhere

Emily loved him
Emily loved him

You cut away the disease
You pure the air that I need
You came and healed my disease

What's gonna happen if it all falls in
And the highs get low and the pain sits inside me

Emily loved him
Cause Emily loved him

You cut away the disease
You pure the air that I breathe
You came and healed my disease again
Now the lights come shining in

You cut away the disease
You pure the air that I need
You came and healed my disease again
Now the lights come shining in
