Feeling so alone
Complexion white as stone
Looking for a getaway

Broken by the strain
And constant rearrangement
Anything is possible

Yeah
Anything is possible
Yeah

Loosing control of my soul but you don't know
Help me breathe
Set me free
Loosing control of my soul but you don't know
Help me breathe
Set me free

Loosing all effect
Cause feelings in descent
Conscious of deception

A bruise you keep inside
A smile that tries to hide
Anything is possible
Yeah

Loosing control of my soul but you don't know
Help me breathe
Set me free
Loosing control of my soul but you don't know
Help me breathe
Set me free

Yeah

Silence
Silence
Silence
Silence
