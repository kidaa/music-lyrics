Staring at Paper faces, Expressions like empty pages, Day after day
Waiting for the lights to change now,, Reaching for a cloud to come down,
And cover me
Can't shut you out
Can't get you out
Can't take you down
Can't watch you drown
Waiting for the world to change now, Dissolution takes a bite out, And swallows me
Looking for a way to get out, Wishing that the rush would come down
And smother me
Can't shut you out
Can't get you out
Can't take you down
Can't watch you drown
If you can learn to be yourself, Then that's okay
If you can find a reason now, Don't drift away
Walking down streets to nowhere, Stepping on feet with no cares,
Losing my self
Can't shut you out
Can't get you out
Can't take you down
Can't watch you drown
Can't shut you out
Can't get you out
Can't take you down
Can't watch you drown
Slide away, slide away
