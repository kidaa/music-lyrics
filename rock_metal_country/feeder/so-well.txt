20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 still alive
It's dragging me under, Don't think I'll recover
A stone in the water, A nail in my shoulder
Just put it together, You think you're so clever
Can we make it better, Climb the mountain together
It's gonna break, gonna crack
Gonna fall down and smash
Paralyse, oxidise, feel us drifting apart
It's gonna break, gonna crack
Gonna fall down and smash
Paralyse, oxidise, feel us drifting apart
don't take me down and watch me fall
Twenty years older, The city gets colder
Still reaching for cover, We live and we suffer
Just put it together, If you think you're so clever
Can you make it better, Pull the pieces together
It's gonna break, gonna crack
Gonna fall down and smash
Paralyse, oxidise, feel us drifting apart
It's gonna break, gonna crack
Gonna fall down and smash
Paralyse, oxidise, feel us drifting apart
40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, still alive
It's dragging me under, Don't think I'll recover
But we'll make it better, Climb the mountain together
It's gonna break, gonna crack
Gonna fall down and smash
Paralyse, oxidise, feel us drifting apart
It's gonna break, gonna crack
Gonna fall down and smash
Paralyse, oxidise, feel us drifting apart
It's gonna break, gonna crack
Gonna fall down and smash
Paralyse, oxidise, feel us drifting apart
It's gonna break, gonna crack
Gonna fall down and smash
Paralyse, oxidise, feel us drifting apart
don't take me down and watch me fall, don't break my bones and watch me crawl
Paralyse, oxidise, feel us drifting apart
Paralyse, oxidise, feel us drifting apart
