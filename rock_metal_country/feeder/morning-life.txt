A new day has begun
And taken us now
Morning life is here
Turn outside and sound

But you feel
Nothing is real
You're flesh and bone
But nothing is real

Today
This could be the only day
Can't let this moment get away
Cause this could be the only way
So call on me
Call on me

Tempers of the world
Dragging you down
The chemistry of life
The touch of a hand

But you feel
Nothing is real
You're flesh and bone
But nothing is real

Today
This could be the only day
Can't let this moment get away
Cause this could be the only day
So call on me
Call on me

You're fading out don't fade
You're coming back
You're fading out don't fade
You're coming back
You're fading out don't fade
You're coming back

Today
This could be the only way
So call on me
Call on me

Today
This could be the only day
Can't let this moment get away
