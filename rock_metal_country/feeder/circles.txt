Yeah, we're gonna make mistakes
Politicians shake and fakes
Backs against the wall
Feel the world about to blow

Yeah, I wanna stay in

Were gonna turn it all around
Find new trees on better ground
Taste the easy life
Can't you feel it's gonna blow?

Yeah, I wanna stay in

Growin' old with you
What a thing to do
Growin' old with you
Just what I'm gonna do?

Thinking back to '86
Summer days out in the sticks
Black Sabbath everyday
Small town life has had its way

Yeah, I wanna be free

Took the open road in haste
Time to jump out of the cage
Experience the world
Drawing circles round the sun

Yeah, I wanna be free

Growin' old with you
What a thing to do
Growin' old with you
Just what I'm gonna do?

Growin' old with you
Just what I'm gonna do?
