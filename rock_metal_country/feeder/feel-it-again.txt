December, why does it always rain
Why does it never snow

Tempers, pulling you round again

It only takes one word to bring you round
But nothing can last forever
It's getting better all the time now
I can feel it again

Falling, dropping like a stone
You wish you could fund your friends

Talking, hearing the same old news

It only takes one word to bring you round
Coz nothing can last forever
It's getting better all the time now
I can breath in again
Getting better everyday now
I can feel it again

Lift yourself into a better place

Time to heal a broken heart

It only takes one word to bring you round
But nothing can last forever
It's getting better all the time now
I can feel it again
Getting better everyday now
I can breath in again
I can breath in again
