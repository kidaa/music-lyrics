You and I used to meet the same
Wrapped together in cellophane
We can try to get away
Drift forever, lost in

Space... We're getting better all the time
Space... We're getting better all the time
Space... We're getting better all the time
Safe... We're getting better all the time

You can try to change my day
Lock me up and you watch me fade
You and I can emulate
Drift together, lost in

Space... We're getting better all the time
Space... We're getting better all the time
Safe... We're getting better all the time
Safe... We're getting better all the time

Decompress again Pressure, pressure, pressure...
Take control again
Connected once again
We're starting to descend

Space... We're getting better all the time
Space... We're getting better all the time
Safe... We're getting better all the time
Safe... We're getting better all the time
Space... We're getting better all the time
Space... We're getting better all the time
Safe... We're getting better all the time
Safe... We're getting better all the time
