The words we say, Old flowers fade away
Remember yesterday, Wish it would bloom again
Apathy and pain, Here comes the Autumn rain
Old apologies scattered in the wings of fate
Cause today it all looks black and white, Wish it would change
We can't keep painting colours when its
Don't hesitate, cause you will bleed
A thousand tears won't wash it clean
Don't hesitate cause you can free yourself
Evergreen, Evergreen
Down on my knees, Crawling though the streets again
Surrendered to my needs, So I can breathe the air
You're my evergreen, Regents Park in spring
It takes me to a place, Where I can dream again
Cause today it all looks black and white, Wish it would change
We can't keep painting colours when it rains
I just want some place where I can breathe without this bitter taste
Cause today it all looks black and white, Wish it would change
We can't keep painting colours when it's grey
It all looks black and white today
You're my evergreen, Regents Park in spring
It takes me to a place, Where I can dream again
Cause today it all looks black and white, Wish it would change
We can't keep painting colours when it rains
Evergreen, Evergreen, Evergreen
