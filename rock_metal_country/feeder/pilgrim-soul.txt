You said you could
You would
You should
And nothing could be this good again
Nothing could beat this

Nothing [x2]

Fracture and break
Falling from grace
Finding someone
You trust
Beleive for laid safe

Crawling
I'm Crawling
Hanging on
There's only one way out
Pushing up
There's only one way now

Cause yeah
Life's for livin'
So don't you give in
Don't you tear it apart

All that you face
You lose
Abuse
Carry the cross
The faith
The loss
The weight
The bruise

Falling
I'm falling
Moving around a town
a space
Climbing the wall
A tow
A train
A higher place

Calling
I'm calling
Hanging on
There's only one way out
Pushing up
There's only one way now

Cause hey
Life's for livin'
So don't you give in
Don't you tear it apart yeah

Hey
life's forgivin'
Don't you give in
Don't you tear it apart yeah

You said you could you should
And nothing could be this good again
Nothing could beat this

Nothing [x2]

Finding the strength
The sense
immense
Reverse
A sub
A moon
A light
A love
A friend

Something [x2]

Hanging on
There's only one way out
Pushing up
There's only one way now

Cause hey
Life's for for livin'
So don't you give in
Don't you tear it apart yeah

Hey
life's forgivin'
Do don't you give in
Don't you tear it apart yeah
