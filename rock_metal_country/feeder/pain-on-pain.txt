Stay for life
For life
All you discover
Stay for life
For life
This moment together
To heal yourself
Love can heal
Can't watch you fall

Pain on pain
Don't come back here again
Shame on pain
Took the last breath away

Save yourself
Yourself
lost for a second
Save yourself
Yourself
bury the concious
And heal yourself
You can heal
Can't watch you fall

Pain on pain
Don't come back here again
Shame on pain
Took the last breath away
Pain on pain

Pain [x4]
Yeah

Wait for love
For love
You know it can happen
Wait for love
For love
The touch of a hand
To heal yourself
You can heal
Can't watch you fall

Pain on pain
Don't come back here again
Shame on pain
Took the last breath away
Pain on pain
