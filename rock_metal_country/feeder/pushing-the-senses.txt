Feelings you never knew
Pulling you under now
Your fighting the undertow
Before it sucks you down

Pushing the senses
It's pushing the senses now

Come on come on
What are you going to do
You can't find another day
Come on come on
You're pushing the senses
You're pushing the senses through

Always, I can depend on you
But sometimes
It's burning a hole right through
Let's talk about it

Staring at photographs
Posted on the wall
Images smiling down
The face of a lonely soul

Come on come on
What are you going to do
You can't find another day
Come on come on
You're pushing the senses
You're pushing the senses through

Always
'cause I can depend on you
But sometimes
I'm finding it hard to choose
Let's talk about it

Always
I can depend on you
But sometimes
It's burning a hole right through
Let's talk about it
Let's talk about it

Always
I can depend on you
But sometimes
Sometimes

Always
I can depend on you
But sometimes
It's burning a hole right through
Let's talk about it

Always
I can depend on you
But sometimes
It's burning a hole right through
Keep pushing the senses through
Let's talk about us
