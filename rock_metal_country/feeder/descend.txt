Sittin back i only wish, 
Today will turn out fine, 
And wash away the stain, 
The poison in my eyes, 
What do you recommend, 
I feel my life descending, 
I'm fallin outta reach, 
Catch me as i bleed again

Im not insane, 
Can't reach the pain.

[CHORUS]
If i could be all by myself, 
i could be me, 
I you could see, live with my pain, 
The thoughts that i keep.

I hate the way they are, 
Thier patronising thoughts, 
Tried to get inside my head, 
Ask the questions i have read, 
But one thing makes it hard, 
Feel so fragile as i cry, 
So confused yet so alive, 
So abused the system lied, 
You lied to me.

Im not insane, 
Can't reach the pain.

[CHORUS]

Alone, 
Alone.

Hands appeared around my neck, 
Felt so hard to breath i stared, 
As my focus turned to haze, 
I could see them.

Im not insane, 
Can't reach the pain.

[CHORUS]
If i could be all by myself, 
I could be free, 
If you could see, live with my pain, 
The thoughts that i keep, 
Alone, Alone, Alone.

Descend, 
Descend.
