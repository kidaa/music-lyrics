Looking through the windowshade, 
Stare at streets that bare no name, 
Now it all looks strange to me, 
Yesterday seems like a dream,
But i often try too hard, 
To break the routine of my day, 
Turn around see what i see, 
Can't help wishing it could.

[CHORUS]
Change, Change, again, 
Unchain myself, i will.

See the faces in the crowd, 
Busy streets they move around, 
Underground seems such a drag, 
Waiting still and then we change, 

[CHORUS X2]

[Ad-Lib:]
The more i see, the more it hurts, 
The more we change it all seems worse.

[M8:]
Tomorrow till tomorrow comes.

As it drags me there i feel, 
A sence of urgency unviel, 
Whats in store for us today, 
Read the papers drift away.

[CHORUS]
Change, we change again, 
We change, again, 
Unchain myself,
I will.

[Ad-libs:]
Oh how i hate to feel this way, 
The more i wait to see it change, 
The more i see the more it hurts, 
The more we change it all seems worse.

CHANGE
