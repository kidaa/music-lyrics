We're laughing in the face of fear again 
We close our eyes and watch it disappear 
Stepping on the stones as we sink in 
We jump into the fires of hopelessness, forever 

Cause it's falling again, catch me 
We've swallowed the pills and the pain 
It's falling again, but no one sees 
It's a 21st century meltdown 

Submitted to the fears of loneliness 
Degenerate and jumping off the edge 
We build our homes, but live inside our heads 
Hoping that the dreams will keep us sane, forever 

Cause it's falling again, catch me 
We've swallowed the pills and the pain 
It's falling again, but no one sees 
It's a 21st century meltdown 
It's a 21st century meltdown
