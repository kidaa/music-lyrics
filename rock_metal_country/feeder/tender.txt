Ache
Can't watch you break
And shatter
Saved
New lives to make
Us better

I'm letting you know
Cleansing my soul
Been letting you know
For days

Turn over everything
Time can heal us again
I'm tender in your arms
Reaching inside of me
Bringing the love I need
The loneliness has gone

Faith
New roads to take
Together
Days
Lying awake
Remember

I'm letting you know
Cleansing my soul
Been letting you know
For days

Turn over everything
Time can heal us again
I'm tender in your arms
Reaching inside of me
Bringing the love I need
The loneliness has gone

I'm letting you know
Cleansing my soul
Been letting you know
For days

Turn over everything
Time can heal us again
I'm tender in your arms
Reaching inside of me
Bringing the love I need
The loneliness has gone
The loneliness has gone
