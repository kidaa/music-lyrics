Kill, kill or be killed for 
Expected life to be so safe 
Caught, caught in a mantrap 
Another part of me has changed 
Maybe I could swim 
Can't help myself 
It's funny but it seems 
I lose myself 
I'm lost inside a dream 
I hate myself 
The more that I believe 
Can't find my way 
Fill, filled with emotion 
Sailing off the edge again 
Drown, drown all devotion 
Riding on a drift to hell 
Maybe I could swim 
Can't help myself 
It's funny but it seems 
I lose myself 
I'm lost inside a dream 
I hate myself 
The more that I believe 
Can't find my way 
Can't find my way.
