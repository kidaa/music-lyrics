We can't keep pissing in the wind
Bleaching holes in perfect skin to make us new
Hold a match until it burns
Got ourselves against the wall, nowhere to go

Tried to be my best to you
As I recall I never lied to you it's true
Wrapped around you like an eel
You reel me in don't throw me back into the pool

Cause we're floating by
While the old world slides
You just make it shine
Leave it all behind

Lifiting off just for a while
Driving off the edge, sailing to the moon
Leave behind your self denial
Taste a piece of life and suck it in for good

Cause we're floating by
While the old world slides
You just make it shine
Leave it all behind
See tomorrow shine

Take a walk into a sea
Diving under waves of green
Climbing back into a dream
Cause we can fly there

Cause we're floating by
While the old world slides
You just make it shine
Leave it all behind
Cause we're floating by
While the old world slides
You just make it shine
Leave it all behind
