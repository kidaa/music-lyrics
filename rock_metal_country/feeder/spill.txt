Push holes in the plastic
Immaculate dolls in the hands of a child with a ratchet
Two fingers too out of control
The confusion shall leave us to vultures and preachers

I hate it...
Can't take it...

I can't believe it
Why can't you see it?
I can't believe it
Chew me up when needed

Turn over another day older
Another day nearer to jumping on over
Bloodsuckers and lovers that leave you
And tease you and cheat you, deceive you I see through

I hate it...
Don't want it...

I can't believe it
Why don't you see it?
I can't believe it
Chew me up when needed
I can't believe it
Why don't you see it?
I can't believe it
Chew me up when needed

I'll say what I wanna say
I'll say what I wanna say

I can't believe it
Why don't you see it?
I can't believe it
Chew me up when needed
I can't believe it
Why don't you see it?
I can't believe it
Chew me up when needed
I can't believe it
Why don't you see it?
I can't believe it
Chew me up when needed
I can't believe it
Why don't you see it?
I can't believe it
Chew me up when needed...
