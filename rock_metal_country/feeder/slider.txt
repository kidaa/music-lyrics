Show me how to get home
Throw me like a stone
Show me how to get home
You love to watch me crawl

Home, just get me home, home, home
Stoned, cause I feel so stoned, oh no

Went to church one day
Repent my evil ways
I heard a voice call down
His words of wisdom sang

Home, just get me home, home, home
Stoned, cause I feel so stoned, oh no

Got this feeling inside my head
I'm spinning out of my ferris wheel red

Feels like home, it feels like home...

Standing by a sea
Staring at my feet
Twenty miles high
Tangerine filled sky

Home, just get me home, home, home
Stoned, cause I feel so stoned, oh no
Home, just get me home, home, home
Stoned, cause I feel so stoned, oh no

Feels like home, it feels like home
