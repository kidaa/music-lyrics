All this for nothing, yeah yeah yeah
Praying and hoping, fooling yourself
You know that you can give love a reason
Give love a chance

We tumble and fall, together we crawl
Forever we'll be, tumble and fall

Heaven's above us, yeah yeah yeah
Living in solace, I give you it all
Just for a day, just for a second,
Just for the way

We tumble and fall, together we crawl
Forever we'll be, tumble and fall

Life's not the same, since that day you went away
I recall like the drops of summer rain that fell on me
Come back to me, come back to me, yeah yeah yeah [x3]

We tumble and fall, together we crawl
Forever we'll be, tumble and fall
Together we crawl, forever we'll be, tumble and fall

Yeah yeah yeah [x6]
