Feel like me
Cut away my skin
The blood on the tap washes clean
The mirror I cracked curses me

If you're a little late
It's time to leave
Live another day now
I hear you scream

See, see what I can see I will believe in you, you and me
Cover me with angel's wings I will believe in you, you'll see
Breathe the air I breathe I will believe in you, you and me
Suffocate the world asleep I will believe in you, you and me

Pain, in me
Watch as it feeds
Another day melts, I feel the heat
The honey I drink nurses me

If you're a little late
It's time to leave
Live another day now
I hear you scream

See, see what I can see I will believe in you, you and me
Cover me with angel's wings I will believe in you, you'll see
Breathe the air I breathe I will believe in you, you and me
Suffocate the world asleep I will believe in you, you and me

Too late, drifting away
Too late

See, see what I can see I will believe in you, you and me
Cover me with angel's wings I will believe in you, you'll see
Breathe the air I breathe I will believe in you, you and me
Suffocate the world asleep I will believe in you, you and me

Just see, see what I can see I will believe in you, you and me
Cover me with angel's wings I will believe in you, you and me
Breathe the air I breathe I will believe in you, you and me
Suffocate the world asleep I will believe in you, you and me

I will, I, I, I
I will, I, I, I
