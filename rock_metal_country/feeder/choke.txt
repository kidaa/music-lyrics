She likes big boats, big yachts, designer throws
She likes big blokes, body oil, sex that chokes
Her mother left her when she was fifteen
Out of the nest into the vacuum flow
She got a job working shifts at Sainsbury's
Packed her bags and left for Monaco

Choke, choke, choke, choke

You're the only pill I take
Lift me up to where the clouds are snow
Cause you're the only thrill I feed
Ease the pressure let the whole thing flow

She likes Belgo, fashion heads, Saville Row
She likes the cheap sex, private jets, the Paris glow
Her mother left her when she was fifteen
Out of the nest into the vacuum flow

Choke, choke, choke, choke

You're the only pill I take
Lift me up to where the clouds are snow
Cause you're the only thrill I feed
Ease the pressure let the waters flow

You're the only pill I take
Lift me up to where the clouds are snow

Snow, snow, snow
Choke, choke, choke, choke

You're the only pill I take
Lift me up to where the clouds are snow
You're the only thrill I feed
Ease the pressure let the whole thing flow

Cause you're the only pill I take
Lift me up to where the clouds are snow
You're the only thrill I feed
Ease the pressure let the whole thing flow
