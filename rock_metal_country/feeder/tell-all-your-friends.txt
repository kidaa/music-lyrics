Staring out to reach a star
Contemplating life on mars
Life's a cover magazine
I'm an eggshell under feet

Till I see this house under pale blue skies
With golden fields that will burn your eyes
So let's take a drive underneath the sun

New intentions all around
Put the brakes on, slow it down
Trying to find a new release
Find a space that you can breath

But I've seen a house under pale blue skies
With golden fields that will burn your eyes
So let's take a drive underneath the sun

But don't come around, pulling me down
Telling the world how I let you down
Just tell all your friends
I wanna dream with you

So tell all your friends and neighbors too
CNN BBC world news
Tell all your friends I wanna dream with you

Tell all your friends
Tell all your friends
Tell all your friends

I don't wanna sit here catching flies
Cause I have seen this house under pale blue skies
With golden fields that will burn your eyes
So let's take a drive underneath the sun

But don't come around, pulling me down
Telling the world how I let you down
Just tell all your friends
I wanna dream with you
So tell all your friends and neighbors too
CNN BBC world news
Tell all your friends
I wanna dream with you

Tell all your friends
