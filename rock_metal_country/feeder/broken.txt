Fading out
Holding out
The innocent way
Loves run out
Left this world inside of me

Crying out
Screaming out
As the echoes within
The cat is out
No more secrets left within

The feelings gone
You swallowed the sun
One by one
The bolder has come
The feelings gone
You swallowed the sun
And wave goodbye to love again

Staring down
Tears roll down
And now that you feed
A Broken cloud
A covers torn for all to see

The feelings gone
You swallowed the sun
One by one
The bolder has come
The feelings gone
You swallowed the sun
And wave goodbye to love again

Fading out
Burning out
