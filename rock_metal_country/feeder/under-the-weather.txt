I've got a pain in my sick brain
Two red eyes and broken veins
I've got a hand inside my head
A chainsaw cutting through my bed
I wish that I was still fifteen
Debbie Harry and Steve McQueen
I found the angel in my dream
Sucked her dry and I cut her wing
L.A. food store cabinet

Get up, shut up
Give me neurofen plus
Shut up, it hurts
Feel I've been hit by a bus
Get up, shut up
You know you don't understand
I'm feeling under the weather

>From the womb into school
Changing faces, breaking rules
Circumstances make you bleed
Sew the wound so you will heal
Cause there's no substitute for pain
Histrionics, broken frames
Build a fire to thaw my brain
L.A. food store cabinet

Get up, shut up
Give me neurofen plus
Shut up, it hurts
Feel I've been hit by a bus
Get up, shut up
You know you don't understand
I'm feeling under the weather

I don't know why I do this time and time again
Cause all my drowning sorrows became my friends

Get out, just shut up, get out, yeah, shut up

I've got a pain in my sick brain
Two red eyes and broken veins
I've got a hand inside my head
A chainsaw cutting through my bed

I've got a pain in my sick brain
Two red eyes and broken veins
I've got a hand inside my head
L.A. food store cabinet

Get up, shut up
Give me neurofen plus
Shut up, it hurts
Feel I've been hit by a bus
Get up, shut up
You know you don't understand
I'm feeling under the weather

I've got a pain in my sick brain
Two red eyes and broken veins
I've got a hand inside my head
A chainsaw cutting through my bed

I've got a pain in my sick brain
Two red eyes and broken veins
I've got a hand inside my head
A chainsaw cutting through my bed
