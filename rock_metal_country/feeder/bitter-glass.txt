The thought of never knowing
Would kill me just the same
The solitary blossom
Reminders of a friend

Gone somewhere
You've got nothing to live for
You're travelling broken
You just can't free yourself

An' all the words we've spoken
Are buried in the sand
The ruptured and the broken
The taste of bitter glass

Gone somewhere
You've got nothing to live for
You're travelling broken
You just can't free yourself

What are you saying
It's just the thought of rejection
It's pulling you deep in
You just can't free yourself

Your voluntary loving
Apologies have passed
I'm coming 'round again
The fragments of a reason
The taste of bitter glass

So what are you saying
You've got nothing to live for
You're travelling broken
You just can't free yourself

What are you saying
It's just the thought of rejection
It's pulling you deeper
You just can't be yourself
