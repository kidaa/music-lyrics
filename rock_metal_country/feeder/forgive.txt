Shoot holes in me, 
Then you watch as i bleed, 
Sticks, Sticks and stones, 
Break my bones as i speak, 
Leave me to burn, 
As i melt in my pain, 
Watch as i drown in my tears, 
We have made.

[CHORUS]
Cause we've got to forgive, 
Things are changing at last, 
I hope for the best, 
But i don't understand i'm just a man, 
I'm still trying to see.

Love, Love is hate, 
Can't seperate, 
how it is, 
Deep in grave, 
Can't pretend, 
'When it's real.'

[CHORUS]

See a way, 
Move away, 
See a way, 
Will i ever be saved for this, 
Will i ever be clean.

[Repeat Verse 1]

[CHORUS X2]

I wish for the best, 
I wish for the best, 
Cause we've got to forgive, 
we've got to forget.
