Seein' life begin
Hear the oceans sing
It takes you back
Pulls you back
Brings you home

See your face in stone
A hollow moon above an aching sky
Silent night
Brings you home

Left without a place
Lonely inner space
That you can breathe
It's the essence of a love
My love

Lead by devotion
Celebrate [x2]
Celebration
Dove grey sands

Lead by devotion
Celebrate [x2]
Celebrate now
Dove grey sands

Narrow days alone
Pushing for the sun
Don't hide away
Burn to grey
One soul

Facing life alone
Numbers on a phone
To help you back
Send it back
Bring you home

Left without a place
Lonely inner space
That you can breathe
It's the essence of a love
My love

Lead by devotion
Celebrate [x2]
Celebration
Dove grey sands

Lead by devotion
Celebrate [x2]
Celebrate now
Dove grey sands

Feelin' like it's over
It's just the start
I can't hear you again
Dreaming of the ocean
As waves come in
I can't hear it again

Dove grey sands [x3]
