Got this Dagger in my back, The balde inside me burning, Change these colours in my head, Turn
to face the real thing.

So what about me, What i wanna be, What about me, hear me when i speak.
I can't take it, I won't make it [x2]

[CHORUS]
But sometimes i feel it,
Do you know how it is, 
You ake up in the mornin & everything fits, 
Im still hoping tomorrow feels like this, 
My Perfect Day

Twist inside me feel it break, The rubber band keeps turning, See the tracks worn in my face,
Hallucinate i'm burning.

So what about me, what i wanna be, what about me, hear me when i speak.
I can't take it, i wont make it [x2]

[CHORUS]
My Perfect Day, My Perfect Day, My Perfect Day.

I can't believe this anymore, I just dont see this anymore, Im stepping out into the rain again.
See my satellite in space, Sending back the weather,
Try to find myself some space, Move on up the ladder.

I can't take it, I wont make it [x2]
So what about me, what i wanna be, what about me, hear me when i speak.

[CHORUS]
My Perfect Day
[CHORUS]
My Perfect Day, My Perfect Day, My Perfect Day.

How Come, How Come
