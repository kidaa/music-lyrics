Staring at the ideal world, 
The bubble begins to break, 
Gazing at the ceiling cracks, 
The more the picture fades, 
It's just that i can't see, 
When im down like this, 
I just feel the wieght, 
As i try to resist.

[CHORUS]
It doesn't matter when i dream away, 
Life in a Stereo World, 
Something happens, i Drift away away

Floating out of sync again, 
Reaching for a cloud, 
Levitating high, i'm free, 
Turning myself around, 
Just as i feel fine, 
It begins to break, 
Now the pain is here, 
What a big mistake.

[CHORUS]

It just explodes as i drift in, 
A thousand hands caress my skin, 
I feel so free as it begins.

[CHORUS X2]
