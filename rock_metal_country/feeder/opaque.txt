It makes no difference when it's fun
Senses shot away who gives a damn
Who I am
I'm opaque
Left to stand out in the crowd
Insecurities come flooding in, the hooks are in
But I'm OK

Don't you see we're in skin deep
Cut me free again and watch me bleed

Turning frequencies inside
Find the perfect place to be alive, finalize
I'm opaque
Substitute the way you feel
Open up your mind run different modes
Break colour codes
On my way

[Chorus]
Don't you see we're in skin deep
Cut me free again and watch me bleed
Don't you see we're in skin deep
Cut me free again and watch me bleed

Drawing circles on a twisted mouth that frowns again today...
We're finding pleasure in a life so short, but that's OK

Lift the world right out from me
Break the cable find the everglow
You never know
I'm opaque

[repeat chorus X3]

Don't you see we're in skin deep
Cut me free again and watch me bleed
Don't you see we're in skin deep
Cut me free again and watch me bleed
Don't you see we're in skin deep
Cut me free again and watch me bleed
