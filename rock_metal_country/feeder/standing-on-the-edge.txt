There's a message on my bed
A new engraving in my overloading head
Feel the walls are caving in
As the wire cuts into my butter skin

Yeah.....Overload

Love's the antidote we need
Love's the antidote we really need

When you're all by yourself
Standing on the edge of the world
Take a look at yourself
Don't fall back in

I thought I shot my conscience dead
But he's come back again to break my china head
Blown a hole right through my dream
Brought me back to earth in a rocket made for one

Yeah.....Overload

Love's the antidote we need
It's the antidote we really need

When you're all by yourself
Standing on the edge of the world
Take a look at yourself
Don't fall back in
Cause when you're all by yourself
Standing on the edge of the world
Take a look at yourself
Don't fall back in
Don't fall back in
