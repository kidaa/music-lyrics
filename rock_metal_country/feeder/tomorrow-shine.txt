Wishing for a summer without rain
Seeing is believing for ourselves
Breathing as we're sinking to the sand

But I will wait for her arms
Then I can reach for the stars
I will wait for her love
Tomorrow shine

Wishing for a lover, not just a friend
Reaching for a hand to pull me in

But I will wait for her arms
Then I can reach for the stars
I will wait for her love
Tomorrow shine
Shine on, shine on

Waiting for a summer without rain
Reaching for the starlet in the sky, again

But I will wait for her arms
Then I can reach for the stars
I will wait for her love
Tomorrow shine

But I will wait for her arms
Then I can reach for the stars
I will wait for her love
Tomorrow shine, tomorrow shine
Tomorrow shine, tomorrow shine
Tomorrow shine, tomorrow shine
