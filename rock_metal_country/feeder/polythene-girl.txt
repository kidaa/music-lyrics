I wish that i could touch the sky
Elevate Me
I hope that i dont burn my eyes
As i Drift free
Don't think that i can help myself
Guess it's true

[CHORUS]
Polythene, Polythene Girl
Wrap me up in a cellophane world
Polythene, Polythene Girl, #I'm breaking the seal, never thought i would

I wish that i could heal myself
Addicted to you
Wrap me up in cotton wool
Just to feel new
Don't think that i can help myself
But it's true

[CHORUS]
Polythene Polythene Girl

Suffocate, elevate
Suffocate, elevate
But it's true

[CHORUS]
Polythene Girl, 
Cellophane World
Polythene Girl,
Polythene
