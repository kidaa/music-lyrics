Evaporate, exasperate
Watch the world with swivel hand
We're hanging on a wire
Cigaretes, nicorettes
Life's addications father stress
But who can make it better

Oh-ho-ho!
Watch me rise
Oh-ho-ho!
Synchronized
Take me high
Space age hero

Pain
Take the strain
Go insane
Like a monkey in a cage
Melting in a fire

Dislocate, make the break
Wash the stain right off your feet
We're hanging on a wier, oh

Oh-ho-ho!
Watch me rise
Oh-ho-ho!
Synchronized
Take me high
Space age hero

Dissident
Take the stand
Live the system, walk the plank
We're hanging on a wire

Oh-ho-ho!
Watch me rise
Oh-ho-ho!
Synchronized
Take me high
Space age hero

Oh-ho-ho!
Watch me rise
Oh-ho-ho!
Synchronized
Take me high
Space age hero
