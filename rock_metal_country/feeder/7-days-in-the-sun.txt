I've got a friend, her name is Laura
We took a holiday, seven sweet days in Majorca
We took a plane, through to southern Spain
To see the ocean wave's blue
We sat and watched the moon
As crickets sung back cover tunes
Way back in May

Seven days in the sun...yeah
She's my heaven
She's a spark
Feels like heaven
So light me up

She's got this friend, his name is Paula
He likes to cross dress every friday night in clothes from Prada
We took a train, left behind the rain
To see the summer sunset glow
But now she's not around
I'm hanging on with broken hands
Way for the clouds

Seven days in the sun
Seven days in the sun...sun
She's my heaven
She's a spark
Feels like heaven
So light me up

You really light me up
You really light me up
You really light me up
You really light me up
You really

Staring through the crowd
It's pulling me underground
And who's gonna dig me out

We used to take a walk on velvet sands across the beach
We used to build a fire, and stare into the rising heat
You used to set me free, lift me from the concrete sea
Seven days in the sun

She's my heaven
She's a spark
Feels like heaven
So light me up

You really light me up
You really light me up
You really light me up
You really light me up
You really light me up
You really light me up
You really light me up
You really light me up
You blow my mind
