They cover me in the clothes you see
And I'm suffocating I try to breathe
Only here to let them know
Fading out as the hours go
Cover me if I walk away
Tripping out, I'm in hyper space
Till the will it begins to break
Feel the wall as it starts to shake

Too late, I know
I'm getting deeper, oh yeah
Falling away

Goodbye all, I'm in heaven
Hear me now, desperation
Reaching out, arms wide open
Hear me now I say

Move away if you still don't see
Hanging on, it could never be
Give it up when you start to bleed
Take it down, it feels good to me
You gotta be what you try to be
Only see what you wanna see
Just to see what you've done to me
Had a lover, I think I'm free

Too late, I know
I'm getting deeper, oh yeah
Falling away
Goodbye all, I'm in heaven
Hear me now, desperation
Reaching out, arms wide open
Hear me now I say

Gone, gone, gone

Too late, I know
Too late, I know

Goodbye all, I feel free
Hear me now, don't cover me
Reaching out, as I leave
Tripping out, TV Me TV Me

Goodbye all, I feel free I'm in heaven, TV Me
Hear me now, don't cover me Desperation, TV Me
Reaching out, as I leave Arms wide open, TV Me
Tripping out, TV Me I swear, TV Me
Goodbye all, I'm in heaven I'm so free, TV Me
Hear me now, desperation I'm so free, TV Me
Reaching out, arms wide open I'm so free, TV Me
Hear me now I say
