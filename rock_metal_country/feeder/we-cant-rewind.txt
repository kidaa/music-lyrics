You're just a face in the crowd
A tiny hole in the cloud
You're trying to find your way in
To let your soul shine back out
We're just a twist in a seam
A splash of paint on a screen
We're making all kinds of shapes
Somehow we can straighten out the bends

This is our time, we can't rewind
Our place to shine out, we can live it anyway
This is our time, to feel sublime
Our place to shine now, and we can do it anyway
We can't rewind

Do you think we can change
A different color and shade
I guess a new kind of thing
Somehow we can straighten out the bends

This is our time, we can't rewind
Our place to shine out, and we can live it anyway
This is our time, to feel sublime
A place to shine now, we can do it anyway
Oh yes, we can do it our way then

Stop taking me for a fool now
Yeah, I've got this feeling inside me
But I guess you knew
We can work it out
We can find some place new
We can't rewind
We can't rewind

You're just a face in the crowd
A tiny hole in a cloud

This is our time, we can't rewind
Our place to shine out, and we can live it anyway
This is our time, to feel sublime
A place to shine now, and we can do it anyway

This is our time, we can't rewind
Our place to shine out, we can do it anyway
This is our time, to feel sublime
A place to shine now, and we can do it anyway
