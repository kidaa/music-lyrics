Waking each day, No money no pay
Living in a box alone with his pain, Kissing the rain that's pouring again,
Blaming the system from where we came, Trapped inside a fish eye lens,
Trying to get out cause it won't change, Money doesn't mean that much to him.
But maybe another bottle of gin:
Here comes that radio man,
He smiles but no one sees him yeah, yeah
Here comes that Radioman
Tune in you might hear him,
Radioman
Living in the same old shoes, With every step the world comes through,
Like a river that flows on down, Dragging him under to the sand
He rises up to another day, The people laugh, but they don't stay
They try to hide their guilt away, With a smile that says that its okay. 
Here comes the radio man,
He smiles but no one sees him yeah, yeah
Here comes the Radioman
Tune in you might hear him,
Radioman, the radioman
Somebody, somebody hear me
Lift off and take me away
Here comes the radioman he smiles but no one sees him,
Here comes that radioman
Tune in you might hear him,
Radioman, the radioman, radioman
The radioman, radioman
