Keep my feet on the sand 
Gotta take the hand that guides me there 
As I reach, do they stare? 
Do they feel the same way? 

I wanna be here! 
I wanna be here, I see the face 
Look back and then it calls to me 
Wanna stay here, here 
Just wanna be free 
Wanna be free 

Could it be in my head? 
As I kneel, as I turn to face, cover me 
If it falls high above 
It takes us all away someday 

I wanna be here! 
I wanna be here, I see the face 
Look back and then it calls to me 
Just Wanna stay here, here 
Just wanna be free 

Will I fell it anymore? 
As a child, as I grow old 
It's the only way I see 
Open up, let it be 

I wanna be here! 
You don't know, cause you don't see it 
I wanna be here, I see the face 
Look back and then it calls to me 
I feel it, so let it go 

Let it go 
Wanna be here 
I wanna be here
