Calling out again,
Sweat upon my head aches
Making me feel bad
Ill again
And as we're dreaming
Maybe im high 

High, takes me in, 
High and i hear you say
Forgiven, i wish i was forgiven
From all this pain
Reaching out to say... 

Thinking of the days
Walking by the trees swaying
Staring at the sun
The little child is me
The pain has taken over
Smiles have turned to stone

High, takes me in,
High i hear you say
Forgiven, i wish i was forgiven
From all this pain
Reaching out to say...

You heal the scars i hide
You drank the tears i cried
Im reaching out to touch 
The angel of my life

Forgiven
Forgiven
Forgiven

I wish i was
I show you the reason 
That we are still alive
Maybe its inside my head
The dreams when you arrive

Forgiven
Forgiven
I wish i was 
I wish i was
Forgiven
Forgiven
I wish i was 
I wish i was
Forgiven
