Breathing in, spitting out
The bittersweet sugar of life
It used to taste better
Sucking in, pulling in
Emotions I just can't hide
Cheap smiles and promises

Cause we're polaroid
We're living in polaroid
Polaroid, it's making me paranoid

Hanging on, holding on
To cables inside my mind
Cut loose and crashing in
Serenade, the volume raise
Breaking glass heads and hands
I can't go on living

Cause we're polaroid
We're living in polaroid
Polaroid, it's making me paranoid
Polaroid, she's living in polaroid
Polaroid, it's making me paranoid, paranoid

You gotta set me free
You gotta set me free...
You gotta set me free

Polaroid, we're living in polaroid
Polaroid, it's making me paranoid
She's polaroid, we're living in polaroid
Polaroid, it's making me paranoid
Polaroid Polaroid, polaroid, polaroid...
She's my polaroid
Polaroid, it's missing in polaroid
Polaroid
