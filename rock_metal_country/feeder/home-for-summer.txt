It's hard for me to comprehend 
Holding on with broken hands 
But who will understand 
Wallow in the acid rain 
What's in store for us today 
It's never gonna feel the same 
I'm waiting for an angel now 
To carry me above the clouds 

Cause it's a long way home for the summer 
And it's a long way up without a ladder 
It's a long way home 
And it's a long way down 

Swallowing the bitter taste 
Trying to find a remedy 
Before the crystal breaks 
Looking at a picture show 
Frame by frame you see us grow 
To something you don't know 
You're trying to find a reason now 
Behind a face, you see a child 

It's a long way home for the summer 
And it's a long way up without a ladder 
And it's a long way home 
And it's a long way down 

Life's a picture show 
Frame by frame we grow
