Guess im stuck in a dream
Surrounded by coloured leaves on the ground, 
As i stare at the trees, 
I see one fall down on my hand.
As i start to explore, 
I can't ignore a man, 
He turn his head around, 
His face was all worn by the sun.

[CHORUS]
Im going out for a while, 
So i can get high with my friends, 
I will, 
I'm going out for a while, 
Don't wait up cause i won't be home, 
Today.

Drifting down the road, 
Losing myself in a dream, 
Feel my hands getting cold, 
Sat in a  boat on a lake, 

[CHORUS]

Climbing up, trying my best, as i sink. Climbing up trying my best as i sink again.

Lying back on the floor,
reaching up high into space, 
see myself in a  glass, 
I'm counting the lines on my face, 
Again, 
Counting the lines on my face,
Again.

[CHORUS X2]

Today, 
Today, 
Today, 
Today.
