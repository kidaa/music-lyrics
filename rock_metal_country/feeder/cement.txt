It's funny how i watch the day go by, I'm sittin watching tv, Talk Shows High, Theres banging on
the walls, My head aches, I'm drinking out the world that i hate.

I had a big car, new clothes, Everything, I had a watch engraved in Switzerland, Today i saw her
buying a magazine, It's time to get myself some Therapy.

How can i stop this, How can i stop this, How can i stop this disease?!?

[CHORUS]
She's got a new dress on
Im in Cement
Sits by her radio
Im in Cement
She's got those x-ray eyes
Im in cement
Don't know which way to go.

It's funny but i dream for yesterday, I'm blistered by the burns that life has made, I'm staring
out behind the windowshade, I see her face accross the street again.

Im in quick sand sinkin in again, I've got concrete shoes and i can't swim.

How can i stop this, How can i stop this, How can i stop this disease?!?

[CHORUS]
She's got a new dress on, 
She's got a new dress on.

I don't know what to do, but i know that i must pull through, i can't keep watching you.

How can i stop this, How can i stop this, How can i stop this disease?!?

[CHORUS]
She's got a new dress on
She's got a new dress on.
