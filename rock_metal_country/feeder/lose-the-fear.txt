Bu bu bu bu, bu bu bu bu
Come back in,
As love get's thin and leaves you dry.
Found that space,
Only to owe you back inside.

You're fading like someone,
Who's given up on life.
And all you've ever left behind,
The scars that burn inside.
You're wishing for someone,
A taste of something better.
Lose the fear.

Bu bu bu bu, Lose the fear.
Bu bu bu bu, Lose the fear.
Bu bu bu bu,

Till it came,
Born to break in someway soon.
Lose the fear.
'Cause nothings easy in this world.

Bu bu bu bu, Lose the fear.
Bu bu bu bu, Lose the fear.
Bu bu bu bu, Lose the fear.
Bu bu bu bu, Lose the fear.
Bu bu bu bu, Lose the fear.
Bu bu bu bu
