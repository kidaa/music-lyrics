Feeling the moment the slip away
Losing direction you're losing faith
You're wishing for someone
Feeling it all begin to slide
Am I just like you
All the things you do - can't help myself

How do you feel when there's no sun
How do you feel when rain drops come pouring down again
How do you feel when there's no one
Am I just like you

Turning to face what you've become
Bury the ashes of someone
Broken by the strain
Trying to fill that space inside
Am I just like you
All the things you do - can't help myself

How do you feel when there's no sun
How do you feel when rain drops come pouring down again
How do you feel when there's no one
Am I just like you
All the things you do

Don't ever feel
that you're alone
I'll never let you down
I'll never leave you dry
Don't fall apart
Don't let it go
Carry the motion
Carry the motion back to me

Feeling the moment the slip away
Feeling the moment the slip away

Am I just like you

How do you feel when there's no sun
How do you feel when rain drops come pouring down again
How do you feel when there's no one
Am I just like you
