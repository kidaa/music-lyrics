Don't you think it's sad?
Happiness is dead, our rain has gone
Building up the walls
Just to see them fall away

Which way should I go?
Further up as I float
Trying to understand
Keep my feet on the ground
And live again
I'm coming down, I see myself
On the sand, I walk again
Through this land of rain

I think we know
My conscience grows
Within myself two different roads
So far from home, again

Which way should I go?
Further up as I float
Trying to understand
Keep my feet on the ground
And live again
I'm coming down, I see myself
On the sand, I walk again
Through this land of rain

Somewhere there's a place that I can be
Somewhere there is air that I can breathe in
Someday pretty soon they're gonna believe
Believe in me, believe in me

Here comes the ground, I see it now
I'm coming down, all by myself
On the sand, I walk again
Through this land of rain

Of rain, of rain, of rain
