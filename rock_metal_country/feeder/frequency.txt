Come on in
I hear your voice
Change the frequency
And make that choice

Constitution
Find new ground
You don't know
I think about you every day

You're lying awake on top of silver clouds
Sending Love back down

It's real love [x3]
Can't you feel it
Can't you breathe it in

Come on in
I hear you sing
All together
Different skin

Superstition
Prophecy
You don't know
I think about you every day

You're lying awake on top of silver clouds
You're sending love back down

It's real love [x3]
Can't you feel it
Can't you breathe it in

Real love [x6]
