Left out in the sun to dry again, Washed up on a shore line south of Spain
Gazing up with telescopic eyes, Planetary life above the skies
Oh my God, she's my obsession, my obsession my obsession
Here she comes, she's a picture of perfect youth
Here she comes, lifting me up to the moon
Drifting on a boat in emerald seas, Pulling on the strings inside of me
Tasting salt as waves dive over me, Twisting on a rope of memories
Oh my God, she's my obsession, my obsession
Here she comes, she's a picture of perfect youth
Here she comes, lifting me up to the moon
Here she comes, she's a picture of perfect youth
Here she comes
If you could only see, That I'm sinking like a stone
The sea is getting colder, Every second as I go
It's like breathing underwater, But I just can't let you go
My obsession, she's my obsession, my obsession
Oh my God, she's my obsession, my obsession my obsession
Here she comes, she's a picture of perfect youth
Here she comes, lifting me up to the moonOh my God, she's my obsession, my obsession my obsession
Here she comes, she's a picture of perfect youth
Here she comes, lifting me up to the moon
Here she comes
