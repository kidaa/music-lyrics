I'm burning out the TV tubes, 
It's three o'clock & I'm confused
Cause commitment is so complete, 
It's burning little holes in me
I know that I might look a mess, 
And she's so perfect in that Oxfam dress
She looks just like a beauty queen, 
Shining out in velveteen
I'm delirious
You make it better
You make the weather seem OK
You're my anaesthetic
You just take the pain away
I love it when she comes around, 
She's a firework that never ends
A micro chip inside my brain,
I'm crawling on my knees again
It scares me the way I am, 
I'm buried in a sea of sand
Lying on a hand grenade, 
Waiting for the world to shake
I'm delirious
You make it better
You make the weather seem OK
You're my anaesthetic
You just take the pain away
You make it better
You just take the pain away
Delirious, I'm so delirious, delirious,
I'm so delirious, Delirious
You make it better
You make the weather seem OK
You're my anaesthetic
You just take the pain awayYou make it better
You make the weather seem OK
You're my anaesthetic
You just take the pain away
Anaesthetic, 
She's my anaesthetic
Anaesthetic, 
She's my anaesthetic
