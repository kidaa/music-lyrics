Falling down, reaching out, For someone to come down
Oblivious to all of us, The child that grows inside
Seventeen without a care, She's taking another ride
A sense of peace she's waving back, To faces carved in stone
Tinsel town, here in tinsel town, It's pulled you down
Life in tinsel town, Overthrown, Relinquished all
Life breeds all around, A fun fair trip a carousel
She's trying to hang on, Here in Tinsel town
Life in tinsel town, It's pulled you down
Stuck in tinsel town, I think she might make it
She has the will to go on, She's turning back pages as the world steps on
Here in tinsel town, Life in tinsel town
Its pulled you down, Stuck in tinsel town
Alone, Alone, Alone, So Alone, Here in Tinsel town
Life in tinsel town.
