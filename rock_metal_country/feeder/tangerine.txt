Tangerine,
Turning Green, 
Cellophane, 
Window pane, 
Socialised, 
Paralysed, 
Plastic Faces suck me dry, 

Tangerine [X4], 

[CHORUS X2]
I know it's sad, 
Lifes just a piece of fruit, 
Touch Down, new ground, 
Stop Living on the Moon.

Twenty eight, 
suffocate, 
Take a ride, 
see me fly, 
Detonate, 
feel it break, 
See myself disintegrate.

Tangerine [X4], 

[CHORUS X2]

See it as i climb, 
The rain burns in my eyes, 
So catch me as i fall away.

Tangerine [X4]

[CHORUS X2],

I know it's sad.
