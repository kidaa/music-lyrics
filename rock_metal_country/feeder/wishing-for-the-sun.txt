Lying on a bed
Flying in my head
Wishing for the sun
Don't let the rain man come
Open up the sky
Stop living in denial
Cut the ropes on me
Feel myself float free

Say hello to the sun when the morning comes
Wave goodbye to the rain, it only brings you pain
Say hello to the sun when the morning comes

We're climbing up the walls
Clutching at your straw
Waving to be seen
Holding on to dreams
Stop living in disguise
Can't cover up my eyes
A new solution's here
Don't watch it disappear

Say hello to the sun when the morning comes
Wave goodbye to the rain, it only brings you pain
Say hello to the sun when the morning comes...

We could always fly into a coloured sky
I think that I've arrived in techni-coloured style
I'm turning upside down, float into the ground
It's alright

Say hello to the sun when the morning comes
Wave goodbye to the rain, it only brings you pain
Say hello to the sun when the morning comes...
