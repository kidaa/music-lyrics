Pull back my skin, 
Look Deep within, 
Transparent grins, 
The more you Kill Me.

Just see how it is, 
Just see how it really is.

[CHORUS]
Theres radiation in my hands, 
Can't you see im going mad, 
See the colourof my skin, 
Turning blue as i breathe in, 
Theres radiation in my head.

Suffer for life, 
My soul divides, 
I'm reaching High, 
But no-one see's me.

Just see how it is, 
Just see how it really is.

[CHORUS]

Get it out, Get it out, Get it out.

Trapped in my shell, 
My fingers melt, 
All by myself, 
I'm all by myself.

Just seehow it is, 
Just see how it really is.

[CHORUS X2]

Radiation....Radiation.

[Chorus Ad Lib:]
You hear me breath a little more, 
And see me walk into a storm, 
The more you give yourself away, 
The more it burns, & breaks away.
