Fill the sky with love 
Fill the sky with love 

I wouldn't mind but she just turned up on the doorstep 
Wistful and ashen slightly bedraggled 
Last time I saw her she was howling at the moon 
Roaming the forest, lupine and rabid

Oh is she wild? 
Does she see my inner child? 

But then she knows it's like a curse 
To find the chosen roles reversed 
To unify my universe 
To call me mellow 

If only I was half my age and she was older 
We'd live on ice-cream on Coney Island 
I know it's gravity that drags down my balloon 
She stays in orbit way after midnight 

Oh slip and slide 
Does she go all dewy-eyed? 

But then she knows it's like a curse 
To find the chosen roles reversed 
To unify my universe 
To call me mellow 

She'll dress down for us 
She'll break new grounds for us 
Watching me cracking up 

She'll hang around fellows 
With all the groundswellers 
Driving me like a truck 

But then she knows it's like a curse 
To find the chosen roles reversed 
To unify my universe 
To call me mellow
