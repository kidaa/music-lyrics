Bathe in another man's grave 
In time we'll follow 
Save all your thoughts for these days 
Don't steal just borrow 

Well a high wire 
Is a dangerous game 
But a hard act to follow 
If I fly high like a moth to a flame 
Would you eyes be the size of sorrow? 

Pain, I can understand pain 
Sometimes you just swallow 
Say we can make it OK 
Don't steal just borrow 

With the high wire 
Is a dangerous game 
But a hard act to follow 
If I fly high like a moth to a flame 
Would your eyes be the size of sorrow?
