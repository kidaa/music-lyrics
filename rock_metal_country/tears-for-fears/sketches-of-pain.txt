Daylight Saved
Daylight Saved
To spite the dark
In spite of the darkness
There I'll crave
There I'll crave
To get to the heart
In spite of the darkness

Great wide stretches of canvas
Signed by a godless name
Strange bright colours of madness
Only a fool would frame
Sketches of Pain
Sketches of Pain
Sketches of Pain

Some cry shame
Some cry shame
We tore them apart
We failed to imagine
God might claim
God might claim
The works of art
We failed to imagine

Great wide stretches of canvas
Signed by a godless name
Strange bright colours of madness
Only a fool would frame
Sketches of Pain
Sketches of Pain
Sketches of Pain

Sketches of Pain
