Toe the line 
Toe the line 

Wake up your time is nearly over 
No more the supernova 
And no action guaranteed 

Wake up you've had an operation 
Ideals above your station 
Too much reality 

Think about the waste of time spending 
Watching Mother Nature's knees bending 
Everybody loves a happy ending 

Wake up you're on your own agenda 
Give up the great pretender 
With baby eyes of green 

Wake up you're holding on to nothing 
You know you're only bluffing 
As dead as autumn leaves 

Think about the waste of time spending 
Watching Mother Nature's knees bending 
Everybody loves a happy ending 

Don't you just love a happy ending? 
Oh yeah well so do I 
And all your love will shine on everyone 

The darkness of the day 
A curse in every way 
You try to see the light 
But you don't know why 
Don't know why 

They tell you on the phone 
To give your God a bone 
And grow a set of wings like a butterfly 

The guarding at the gate 
Reminds you that you're late 
You try to take your time 
But you toe the line 
Toe the line 

The children of the world 
And daddy's little girl 
The grass is always green on the other side 
So stay and breathe new lies 

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up 

Wake up, wake up 
Everything is moving faster than you think 
Wake up, wake up 
Your pen is running out of ink 
Wake up, wake up 
Fill up your bath and kitchen sink 
Wake up, wake up 
They're really kicking up the stink 
Wake up, wake up 
You've never found the missing link 
Wake up, wake up 
You should be happy and to think 
Wake up, wake up 
You're rending members out of sync 
Wake up, wake up 
And God is whiskered as a wink 
Wake up, wake up 
Once more are different to the brink
