This is a garden, this is a steeple 
I hear the crowd before I ever see the people 
Yours for the making, and for the taking 
There is a power in the vacuum we are making 

You and I have a secret world 
And we can keep it unfurled 
And pay no attention to the cradle or the grave 

And when we're crossed, 
We can say that we're lost 
In the middle of nowhere think you'll like it a lot 
And if we're wrong and we end up alone 
We'll light a candle for their innocent bones 

You and I have a secret world 
And we can keep it unfurled 
And pay no attention to the cradle or the grave 

You and I have a secret world 
And we can keep it unfurled 
And pay no attention to the cradle or the grave 

And when we're crossed, 
We can say that we're lost 
In the middle of nowhere think you'll like it a lot 
And if we're wrong and we end up alone 
We'll light a candle for their innocent bones 

You and I have a secret world 
And we can keep it unfurled 
And pay no attention to the cradle or the grave 

And when we're crossed, 
We can say that we're lost 
In the middle of nowhere think you'll like it a lot 
And if we're wrong and we end up alone 
We'll light a candle for their innocent bones
