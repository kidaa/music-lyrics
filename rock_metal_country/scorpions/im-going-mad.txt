Lyrics:Klaus Meine, Wolfgang Dziony, Lothar Heimberg

Walking through the desert
Hearing Nazi bells ringing from the church to farm
That was never there
Imagine I'm in heaven, but it is a hell
Sun is drying out my brain
The smile and installations are my pain
I'm going mad
I'm going mad
I'm going mad 
Aaaayowwww!!!

Walking through the desert
Hearing Nazi bells ringing from the church to farm
That was never there
That was never there
Sun is drying out my brain
The smile and installations are my pain
I'm goin' mad!
I'm goin' mad!
I'm goin' mad!
mad!
