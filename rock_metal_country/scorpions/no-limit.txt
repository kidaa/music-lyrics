What's the noise who's to blame 
The Maserati comes unchained 
Smell the power and energy 
Come away, come away, come away 

You're the rider of the wildest storm 
Live your dreams before they're gone 
Feel the spirit that sets you free 
Come away, come away, come away 

You gotta live it up there's no limit 
We gotta make it there's no limit 
You give it all you've got there's no limit 
Reach for the sky 

We gonna leave for tomorrowland 
We've got the future on our hands 
A piece of heaven for you and me 
Come away, come away, come away 

You gotta live it up there's no limit 
We gotta make it there's no limit 
You give it all you've got there's no limit 
Reach for the sky 

You gotta let it go there's no limit 
We gotta take it there's no limit 
You leave me hot and cold there's no limit 
Reach for the sky 

Higher higher 
Take me higher always higher 
Reach for the sky
