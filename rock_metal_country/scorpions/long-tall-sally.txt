Lyrics:Penniman

Gonna tell Aunt Mary 'bout Uncle John,
he says he has the blues but he has a lotta fun.
Oh baby,
ye-e-e-eh baby,
woo-o-o-oh baby,
havin' me some fun tonight.

Well, long tall Sally has a lot on the ball
and nobody cares if she's long and tall.
Oh baby,
ye-e-e-eh baby,
woo-o-o-oh baby,
havin' me some fun tonight.

Well, I saw Uncle John with long tall Sally.
He saw Aunt mary cummin' and he ducked back in the alley.
Oh baby,
ye-e-e-eh baby,
woo-o-o-oh baby,
havin' me some fun tonight.

We're gonna have some fun tonight,
gonna have some fun tonight.
We're gonna have some fun tonight,
everything will be alright.
We're gonna have some fun,
gonna have some fun tonight.

We're gonna have some fun tonight,
gonna have some fun tonight.
We're gonna have some fun tonight,
everything will be alright.
We're gonna have some fun,
gonna have some fun tonight.
