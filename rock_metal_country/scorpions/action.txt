Lyrics:Klaus Meine, Wolfgang Dziony, Lothar Heimberg

Yeah, count to five
And I will start my car for a ride
Yeah, a hundred miles
And there will be a speed satisfies

Yeah, this's my life
Behind my driving wheel world seems fine
Yeah, action time
One only cannot change with the style

Yeah, this's my life
Behind my driving wheel world seems fine
Yeah, action time
One only cannot change with the style

Yeah, it's a good time
So alone, really mine, yeah
Yeah, but I don't mind
God, that's me and my life

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
...

Go ...
