We don't own the world

My world is your world
The air we breath and the starts we see
Our journey called discovery
My time is your time
Your silent scream
Remains unheard
Humility is not just a word

We don't own the world we don't
We don't own the world oh no
We don't own the world we don't own the world

Your light is my light
The tears we cry, the joy we share
To love just means we really care
My dream is your dream
We could save the world
We could share so much
If we don't live like this no more

We don't own the world we don't
We don't own the world we don't
We don't own the world oh no
We don't own the world we don't own the world
We don't own the world we don't own the world
We don't own the world oh no

We don't...
