Lyrics:Klaus Meine

You're a rock-n-roll star
You're out of the charts
Your glory's cold you're getting old
But your life is rock-n-roll

Your crazy rock-n-roll band
Is spinning in your head in your head
Each generation makes us stars
As the first five on the charts

Ohhh...and they are top of the bill

You're a rock-n-roll star
You've been the first one on the chart
You've had glory and fame
Rock-n-roll was your game

Ohhh...and you were top of the bill
