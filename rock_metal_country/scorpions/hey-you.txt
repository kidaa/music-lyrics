Lyrics:Klaus Meine, Herman Rarebell

Hey you, I'm in love with your eyes
And the sound of your name
Hey you, I'm in love with your smile
And the way you're dressed today

Hey you, well I like the way you walk
Just like a star moves on stage
Hey you, well I like the way you talk
You're really calm for your age

I really die
You're driving me wild
I really die
I'm in love 100 times

I really die
You're driving me wild
I really die
I'm in love 100 times
To be your lover

Hey you, I said you know what's going on
Do you know what I mean
Hey you, daddy wants you back home
this school is up to me

I really die
You're driving me wild
I really die
I'm in love 100 times

I really die
You're driving me wild
I really die
I'm in love 100 times
To be your lover
