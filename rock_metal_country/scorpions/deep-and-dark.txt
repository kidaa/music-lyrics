Down, I am down
On the ground, sad and tired
I'm down, it's over now
Yes I'm down, should I like it

It's deep and dark
Deep down in my heart
It's deep and dark
Since we've been apart

Is this love that comes around
That takes me up light years higher
'cause I wanna feel love once again

It's deep and dark
Deep down in my heart
It's deep and dark
Since we've been apart

It's deep and dark
Deep down in my heart
It's deep and dark
Without someone's love
