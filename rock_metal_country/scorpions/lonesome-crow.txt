Lyrics:Klaus Meine, Wolfgang Dziony, Lothar Heimberg

The sun is gone
Voices gone
As I learn they're there
Lonesome crow
Where are they from
Where are their souls

Now I've had enough
Oh, leave control
We follow them
We surely will descend
Ooooow!

Aaaah Ahahahah Ahahahah Ahahahah Ahahahah Haaaah

Now I've had enough
Oh, leave control
We follow them
We surely will descend
