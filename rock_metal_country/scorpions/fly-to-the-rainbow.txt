Lyrics:Ulrich Roth

Life is empty, can't remember anytime before,
On a plain lit cold December, see it evermore,
Gliding through this life, and another as a child,
Ever doing games, and losing things, always playing gigs.
Somewhere in the sky, where the moon the stars shine bright,
Where the sun is shining, in the night.
I am in disgrace, yet i see your smiling face,
and i hope you let me, share your place.
I don't live today.

Rain in the sky made the world fly into time
Back beyond time
Sun in the sky made the world fly into time
Back beyond time

Rain in the sky made the world fly into time
Back beyond time
Sun in the sky made the world fly into time
Back beyond time

Rain in the sky made the world fly into time
Back beyond time
Sun in the sky made the world fly into time
Back beyond time

Well, I lived in magic solitude,
Of cloudy looking mountains,
And a lake made out of crystal raindrops.
Roaming through space, ten thousand years ago,
I've seen the giant city of Atlantis,
Sinking into eternal wave of darkness.
Shhh.

Somewhere in the blue distance
Are those long forgotten trees of yore
A broken violin floating alone in December
Darkness everywhere, and nothing more
Symbol, strange symbol, melancholy
Painting torrid colors on a sky of green
Candle breathing one night only
Far away, in chillness, bleak, unseen
Drifting galley, ghostlike shadow
Sails rigged to catch and kill the time
Echoes wandering down an endless meadow
I feel ... sublime
