Jealous hearts are wild, oh so wild
Like a raging storm
Jealous hearts are blue, oh so blue
When all the dreams are gone
Maybe we were born to lick honey from a thorn
But I don't think it's true at all

Jealous hearts are high, oh so high
On emotions oh yeah
Jealous hearts are deep, oh so deep
Deep like an ocean oh yeah
May be we were lost without feelings in a dust
But I'll be there the day I'll fall

Wherever I go wherever I go
Wherever I go wherever I go
Wherever I go wherever I go
The road takes me home to you

Jealous hearts are wild, oh so wild
Just all darken blue
Jealous hearts are red, so dark red
Just like roses oh yeah
Maybe we were born to lick honey from a thorn
But I don't think it's true at all

Wherever I go wherever I go
Wherever I go wherever I go
Wherever I go wherever I go
The road takes me home to you back to you

Yeah, yeah
There's a lonely guy
Who's sitting on a cloud
Who only wants to be with you

Maybe we were born to lick honey from a thorn
But I don't think it's true at all

Wherever I go wherever I go
Wherever I go wherever I go
Wherever I go wherever I go
The road takes me home to you back to you
Wherever I go wherever I go
Wherever I go wherever I go
Wherever I go wherever I go
The road takes me home to you
Back to you

Back to you
