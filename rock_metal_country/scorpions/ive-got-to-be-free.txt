Lyrics:Ulrich Roth

You're burnin' my heart
You're burnin' my mind
You're spoilin' my art
You're wasting my time
No taste in your actions
No taste in your line
No tears now...
Just don't do you ever mind

You say you wanna be a superstar
You're givin' up half to get that far
You say you wanna ride a diamond car
But I don't like your fancy car

Hey hey hey, don't you wanna see
I'm not your steppin' stone
Hey hey hey, I've gotta be free
So leave my life alone
So leave my life alone
So leave my life alone

You're in love with success
You're spilling my wine
No part of my address, babe
Your ways aren't mine
You may got the money
But your wastin' my life
I'm not your Bugs Bunny
And you're not my wife

You say you only do it for affect
But you don't wanna see what I detest
I think you're depraved
I'm gonna leave you so
But you can't see what I see so let me go

Hey hey hey, don't you wanna see
I'm not your steppin' stone
Hey hey hey, I've gotta be free
So leave my life alone
So leave my life alone
So leave my life alone

Hey hey hey, don't you wanna see
I'm not your steppin' stone
Hey hey hey, I've gotta be free
So leave my life alone
So leave my life alone
So leave my life alone

Hey hey hey, don't you wanna see
I'm not your steppin' stone
Hey hey hey, I've gotta be free
So leave my life alone
So leave my life alone
So leave my life alone
