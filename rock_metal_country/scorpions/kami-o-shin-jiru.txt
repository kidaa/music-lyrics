Lyrics:Klaus Meine

Do you say a prayer when your feeling down
Do you believe that love can turn your faith around
You're feeling high and low, but you don't know what to think
The world is full of saints who live their lives in sin

Don't ask the mirror ball you better ask yourself
I think you know the answers but maybe you can't tell
You'll see it all so clear just take a look inside
The judge you build inside your heart will always be your guide

Kami o shin jiru
Kami o shin jiru

Another day goes by and so does your life
You try to make some sense before your time to die
If you feel humility for something that is true
You'll find the secrets of this life deep inside of you

Kami o shin jiru
Kami o shin jiru
Kami o shin jiru
The innocent won't feel the judgement day

Kami o shin jiru
Kami o shin jiru
Kami o shin jiru
The innocent won't feel the judgement day

Kami o shin jiru
Kami o shin jiru
Kami o shin jiru
The innocent won't feel the judgement day
