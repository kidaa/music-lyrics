Lyrics:Klaus Meine, Wolfgang Dziony, Lothar Heimberg

I'm lost

Woman leave my life
Woman be so kind
Woman well you know
Well you know
Yeah, well you know

Sarah will return
Sarah, she's my girl
Woman well you know
Well you know
Yeah, well you know

Sarah will return
Sarah, she's my girl
Woman well you know
Well you know
Yeah, well you know
