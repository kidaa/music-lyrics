Lyrics:Klaus Meine

I take your hand and you take my hand
Let's try to learn to fly
Here what I say, here what I say
Dream and close your eyes
Too much hate, too much hate
So many things are wrong
So many ways, so many ways
Flying through the sky forever into another time

Yesterday, so far away
Many miles together were looking for the way
And day by day, so far away
All the world should do the same

So we go together
Will you show me the way
Time is gone, it is gone
Far away, far away

And today, I see a way
Follow me we love you
Just listen, what I say
Forget your name and yesterday
Hold out your hand, I'll do the same

Now we're going to another land
Will you show me the way
Time is gone, it is gone
Far away, far away
