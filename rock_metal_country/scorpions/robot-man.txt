Lyrics:Klaus Meine

Crave communication
See me this is my life in the crazy robot man reservation
Do you feel him, the cold vibration
'Cause a man everywhere, produce a crazy science fiction creation

And I say oooh, oooh
I'm a robot man
And I say oooh, oooh
I'm a loser
I say oooh, oooh
I'm a robot man
I lost my mind
I lost my life
I lost my soul

Babe, it's a magic station
Where we live what we do with our magic from my generation
I say babe, it's not a vision
It's reality, this is a robot scene what we live in.

And I say oooh, oooh
I'm a robot man
And I say oooh, oooh
I'm a loser
I say oooh, oooh
I'm a robot man
I lost my mind
I lost my life
I lost my soul

And I say oooh, oooh
I'm a robot man
And I say oooh, oooh
I'm a loser

I say oooh, oooh
I'm a robot man
And I say oooh, oooh
I'm a loser
