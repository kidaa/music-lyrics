Lyrics: Klaus Meine

A moment of glory called evolution
Could I see the world with the eyes of a child
A new beginning, a moment of freedom
Like angels are singing a song full of joy

This side of heaven
Belongs to the children
I will be there, when the future arrives

A moment of glory called evolution
Could I fly away like a bird in the sky
No limitation, a new inspiration
A world that is free just as free as my mind

Communication
A new destination
The planet of visions is calling tonight

Another thousand years seems so long
I'm just a passenger
And the ride has just begun

Moment of glory

A moment of glory called evolution
Could I see the world with the eyes of a child
A new beginning, a moment of freedom
Like angels are singing a song full of joy

This side of heaven
Belongs to the children
I will be there, when the future arrives

Moment of glory
Moment of glory
Moment of glory
Moment of glory
