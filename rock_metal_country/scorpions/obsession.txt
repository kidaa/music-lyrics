Lyrics: Klaus Meine

Girl I don't think of you
At least that's what I try to do
And I just miss those days
Our secret little place, Oh well
But I'll be there
Anytime your heart is desperate just to love someone
I want you to call my now
Cause it feels so good to be your lover
When my lips are kissing you all over
And no matter what I do I can't get you off my mind
I just want this night to last forever
It can not get any better
In my life
Now I don't feel the pain
My world went upside down insane
And I don't miss those nights
Now maybe that's a lie as well
Still I'll be there
Anytime your heart is desperate just to love someone
I want you to call my now
Cause it feels so good to be your lover
When my lips are kissing you all over
And no matter what I do I can't get you off my mind
I just want this night to last forever
It can not get any better
In my life
And I'll be there
Anytime your heart is desperate just to love someone
I want you to call my now
Cause it feels so good to be your lover
When my lips are kissing you all over
And no matter what I do I can't get you off my mind
I just want this night to last forever
It can not get any better
In my life
There's nothing left to do
But to say those words to you
Oh yes I do
