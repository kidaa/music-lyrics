I wanna know what you've got to say
Don't wanna wait any longer
I feel a shook up since you walked my way
You make me feel so much stronger

Hey little baby
I wanna go your way

This time
I want to disregard this feeling of tainted love
This time
Don't wanna be a part of playing the game of higher love
When you're mine

Now you see what you've done to me
Don't wanna wait so much longer
I feel sideways up since you walked my way
My feel for you keeps getting stronger

Hey little baby
I wanna go your way

This time
I want to disregard this feeling of tainted love
This time
Don't wanna be a part of playing the game of higher love
Just make you mine
