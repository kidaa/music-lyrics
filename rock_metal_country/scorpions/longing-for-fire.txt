Lyrics:Ulrich Roth

Flying with dark eyes
Ever longing for fire
Crying, black as night
The night wind brings me higher

In search of light
Escape the night one day
She's lost in time
To space so high
Time's passing by and I
I'm on my way

In search of light
Escape the night one day
She's lost in time
To space so high
Time's passing by and I
I'm on my way
