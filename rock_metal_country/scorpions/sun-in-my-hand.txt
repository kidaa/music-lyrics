Lyrics:Ulrich Roth

Yeah, well I'd like to tell you something now
Before madness shows her lucid feathers in the sky

How can you lose your mind
How can you waste your time
Only like that
Look at the sun inside
Of my hand so bright
I call it music

And if you touch you'll see
It comes from infinity
It's made forever
You will not touch in vain
Music will make you sane
Burn like you say 'em

How can you lose your mind
How can you waste your time
Only like that
Look at the sun inside
Of my hand so bright
I call it music
