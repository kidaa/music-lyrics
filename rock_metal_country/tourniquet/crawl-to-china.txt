Is God asking you to crawl to China - or just to cross the street?
To trudge through the desert through Arabian heat
Or to accomplish the impossible - an Herculean feat
Or maybe just trade in bad thoughts obsolete
Is it the concentration camps at Dackow?
Is it Joan of Arc revisited?
Niagara Falls in a barrel?
Or to mend a broken relationship instead?
Crawl to China
He is faithful - it remains in His hands
From the cold barren Arctic to the war stricken lands
From the place in your heart where despair takes its hold
To the lairs of the demons where deceptions are told
Is God asking you to crawl to China or just to cross the street?
Crawl to China
With emotional rigormortis freezing your step
You won't be going far at all
It feels pretty safe but the danger is real
You won't grow until you face the fear that you feel
Crawl to China
