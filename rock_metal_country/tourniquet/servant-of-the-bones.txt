Collect the skeletal remains
Of long dead memories
To line this rotting hole I've made inside me
A scarred and twisted soul is all I've got to show
For this life alone
Among the dead, among the bones
Burn me once
Shame on you
Burn me twice
Shame on me
You'll never get that close
Now while I serve the bones
Upon this anger upon this hatred I feed
These things that somehow nourish will slowly kill me
These talismans remind of pain felt over time
Before this life I chose
Among the dead, among the bones
