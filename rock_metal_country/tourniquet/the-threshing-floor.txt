You see life as a game
That you don't want to play in
Born in a world
That you don't wanna stay in
There's only two roads
And none in between them
If you don't choose the Son
The choice you've made is against Him
Watch out!
You're gonna lose
If you mess with your maker
Look out!
You're gonna lose
If you mess with the snake
Beware
You're gonna lose
If you think you can tip-toe in between
Your life is in danger!
You have made up your mind
That you don't need religion
You're such a good person
And you live better than some Christians
Well, I got some really bad news
You can read it for yourself
Jesus came once to save you
Turn away and He's gonna slay you
Your life is in danger
To confessing Christians
That live in sin
To the religious
Living by the law
Those who heard the Gospel
And turned away
Lazy people who wouldn't make up their minds
Your life is in danger - Holy Danger!
