If a stone holds you down
Keep your head above ground
Though the foothold can be merciless
In a world not your own
Its the wieght of the stone
Holding me, holding you
Very fast, quite fast
Its not the wieght of the stone that's holding you down
Its the way it fascinates your mind
And just because it causes you to fall
Don't mean it tempts me very much at all
I can see that it feels like a millstone is tied around your neck
But if you come clean and say,I don't have it together
You can still keep your faith in check
3, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14 feet
No spineless fellow here
Down below 100 more and not a sign of fear
X marks the spot at 145 a stone dislodged held him fast
How could he know while now alive
13th day would be his last
They tried and tried to bring him to the surface in vain
If a stone holds you down
Keep your head above ground
Though the foothold can be merciless
For 12 more days the foothold was merciless
With no possible means of ingress or egress
In the end a paradox was found
The beast that held him was a 10 pound stone
Are you afraid - are you afraid?
That where he takes you is a cold, dark lonely place
Where its hard to find his face - hard to find his face
In a world that is not your own
In a world not your own - it's not the wieght of the stone [Repeat Line]
