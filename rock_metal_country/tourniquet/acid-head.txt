Johnny is a chemist's son
But Johnny is no more
What Johnny thought was H2O
Was H2SO4
Water cleans the system
Acid eats the flesh
Squirm yourself much deeper
Into the pit of selfishness
The burn of death is what you crave
I'll gladly bow and be your slave
To serve you all the days I live
My chemical god to you I give
Acid head - walk like the dead
Acid head - life in the red
Pacify your emptiness
It becomes more, you become less
All the platitudes you need
Planted by the demon seed
Hurting only me not you
To those around, it isn't true
The life you wreck is not your own
He grieves upon His holy throne
Acid head - walk like the dead
Acid head - life in the red
Acid head
Acid head - walk like the dead
Walk like the dead
Life in the red
Walk like the dead
Close the book, it's time to die
Don't get up, don't even try
Think about your soul instead
Where will you be when you're dead
Johnny is a chemist's son
But Johnny is no more
What Johnny thought was H2O
Was H2SO4
Acid head - walk like the dead
Acid head - life in the red
Acid head - walk like the dead
Acid head - life in the red
