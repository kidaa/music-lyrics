Distance makes my heart to fester
In self inflicted pain
If I can't face the consequences of my actions
I'll find someone else to blame
I greet you with a brothers kiss
And crank the knife another...twist
Twisting fates to fit the fabrications of my mind
I find I've crossed the line
No matter what the cost I must be right
I greet you with a brothers kiss
And crank the knife another twist
Pointing to things that don't exist
I crank the knife with another...
[Solo: Aaron]
Alone among the ashes of the things
Which once defined my lifeI hold that match which lit the fire
But you'll never see me take the blame...
