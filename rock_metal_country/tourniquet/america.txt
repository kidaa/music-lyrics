Between the years of 1861-1865,
over 620,000 Americans died from gunshot,
disease or sickness
in the bloodiest battles of our nations history -
the Civil War.
Through the instrument of prejudice,
fear and hate,
a different battle rages on to this day.
But in Christ, we are all one people -
united in our commitment to God and each other -
because it is He who First loved us...
