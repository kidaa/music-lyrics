The iguanidae sees East and West simultaneously
The praying mantis sees three hundred flies from three
Orbit of man, divergent strabismus and
Compound eyes alien by design
Pathogenic Ocular Dissonance
Unravel the surcingle, clotted and much
Excoriated eons of life unsound
Avert your gaze, the horrific pestilence
You are spared and standing on Holy ground
Searching nystagmus, it's no wonder
Spiritual migraines still persist
The scales fall, the cataracts desist
The life you once led is not even missed
Pathogenic Ocular Dissonance
When red is green and green is grey
Tou've failed the test in column A
You see at twenty what we do at fifty
The wisdom of sight comes from the father of lights
The treasure you see, the treasure you know
There will your heart be found also
