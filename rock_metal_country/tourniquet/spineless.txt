Gimme the track get back and let me rip this up no jive no shuck
as I truck loads of funk for your rump so pump your fist and
come and get a bump of this
Witness a kid don't even own his own soul playin' the other role
just to be down with the foe I can't understand a coward giving
up his power when you're livin' in the last hour twelve o'clock
Jesus is comin' back schedule is tight I gotta keep my stuff intact
slack is wack it's time out for the hack strngthen up your back
Take a look at your friends is that what you want
They're as empty air, just out for a jaunt
3,7,9,10,12,14 times harpin' at you with those stale old rhymes
Tellin' you that livin' yout life for Him
Is a waste of time you're out on a limb
Remember the times I pulled you through
Or maybe you don't, you never knew
What a tragedy it is to see you become less that you ought to be
Lose that grade-school mentality the key to see the Trinity
Lies open in the Book of Life to put an end to human strife
Speaking out against idolatry He came to set the captives free
You think you got rights, well I had 'em too
But I gave 'em all up when I died for you
You can't come to me cause you're good enough
Since the fall of man I'll call your bluff
I don't want to see you suffer anymore
So go ahead friend, open up the door
That leads to freedom from guilt and pain
Got nothin' to lose everything to gain
Give it up
To the one
Who gave you
His own Son
