The path to healing forks too many times
The road to contentment is hard to align
Out of the anguish - the quiet voice is mesmerizing
Great God Jehovah sympathizing
Manifold is misery - symbiotic history of trials
Soon a yard turns into miles - a day becomes a year
No path set before me presents itself as clear - confusion without peer
The cudgel of forlorn dreams - hits me square and final
Restoring the locust years
What you cannot do for yourself
There is One who is able
To restore the years the locust ate
When sorrow has it's grip on you
Giving you no reason to submit to any other
Manifold is misery - symbiotic history of trials
Soon a yard turns into miles - a day becomes a year
No path set before me presents itself as clear - confusion without peer
The cudgel of forlorn dreams - hits me square and final
Restoring the locust years
