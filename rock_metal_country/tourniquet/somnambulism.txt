In a permanent dream state
Stumbling in the dark
You walk thru life asleep
Confusion overwhelms you
Lifes only what you see
Your eyes look glassy
Wandering aimlessly
You've fallen down the stairs
Is there anyone to help you
Find your sanity
Blessed is the man
Who dwells in the unapproachable light
It will open a window
That empties the darkness of your soul
There was a rich ruler
Who mourned his daughter death
In faith came to the Lord
He said if you will only touch her
I know that she will live
But when the master saw her
He said that she's asleep
The crowd just laughed at Him
He said ARISE!
She heard and she obeyed
If we walk in the light
As He is in the light
He will purify us
Somnambulism
Get away from me!
