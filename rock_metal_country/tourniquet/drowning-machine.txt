The water is fast, but it ain't deep
I waded out before
I could do it in my sleep
Another line, another fix
Another I don't care
The place you thought you'd never be
Guess what, you're there
Drowning machine
Drowning machine
Sow a thought, reap an action
Sow an action, reap an habit
Sow an habit, reap a destiny
Do anything, be anyone
But you're not free
Drowning machine
Drowning machine
A three foot river drop
A circular hell
Drowning machine is
Ringing the death bell
Your lifeless soul floats to the shore
You couldn't stop
Had to have more, more, more
Drowning machine
Drowning machine
Drowning machine
Tragic death scene
