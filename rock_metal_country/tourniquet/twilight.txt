When Father Time begins to run out on you
There's a place we take you to
Just a burden now, I heard them say
I know I'm just in the way
You watch the car as they drive slowly away
Their guilt will hang on them for just today
All alone you sit, the phone never rings
Each day new sorrow brings
And the holidays, they come and they go
But there's one thing that I know
Even though my family counts me for dead
I never see them anyway
My life to God is not a worthless mistake
He's right there with me in my endless heartache
Can you look away from all this pain
Or do you think it isn't there
Can you look away from all this pain
Say you just don't really care
As we lock our priceless heritage away
Our kin the elderly
Do you know someone who stares at the walls
I think you know what to do
