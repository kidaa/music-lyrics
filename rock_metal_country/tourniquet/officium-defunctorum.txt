Nigh does the tempest
Draw to devour him
Through sullen seas of throes
The end of life begins
His fame will fade in time
His name is you and I
We died the day that Adam died
Outside the garden we're denied
Nigh does the Master
Draw to receive us
To give unto our souls
Harvested deeds we've sown
His fame remains throughout eternity
His name the Prince Of Peace
He died the day our sin connived
Outside the gates was crucified
His blood was shed for all mankind
Outside atonement we're denied
