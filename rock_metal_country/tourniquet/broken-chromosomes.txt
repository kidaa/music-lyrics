I want to take my life today
I don't belong here anyway
My God if you can hear me now
See if Your hand can reach this far
You stopped playing father
As soon as mom conceived
The only time we touched
Was just before I screamed
The gift that keeps on giving
Your father gives to me
History repeats itself
Now history meets me
So what if I'm retarded
Mentally delayed
I'm sorry for annoying you
But I was born this way
You speak so much better
Got an aerodynamic face
Mega-babes and tons of friends
So why show so much hate
Vultures are circling again
My open wounds are food for them
Oh God if you will reach your hand
You can deliver me from man
But I'll get up
I'll get up
Watch me get up
Men fail me...
But the Son of God saves
When I'm face down
And I'm scared and lonely
You are by my side
I'm talkin' face on the ground
My back is painted with footprints
You're the only one
That hears me cry
I seek I find just one name
By which a man can be saved
And He comes before
My tears can dry
Now I'm not alone
No I'm not alone
And I'm free now cause
I've got no pain to pass on
