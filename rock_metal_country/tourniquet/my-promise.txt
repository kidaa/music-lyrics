Just a boy, you will not remember half
The things you're going through right now
How can I explain to you things don't
Always go the way you want them to
I know you feel confused
Your mother never wanted this for you
She did her best but that he wouldn't do
You and I are brought together now by
Wedding vows, vows that I have also made to you
Flesh and blood though we are not
I will love you as my own
Now God's love is all we've got
Together we can build a home
All I want for you is to remember this
Never will I turn my back on you
This world will lie to you and take you for a ride
How can I protect you from this path
Only God can show you that the lights in life burn fast
Never forsake you precious days of youth
I promise I will do my best for you
Listen to me and I will listen too
