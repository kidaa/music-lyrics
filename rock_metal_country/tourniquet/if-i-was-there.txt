I close my eyes and think about Calvary
I see it happening right in front of me
the back that bore the whip, the head that held the crown of thorns
what if I was there
would I even care, would I even care
or would I only stare
What if I was there just a face in the crowd
would I hide in shame or would I laugh out loud
would I pity Him or think that He is just a fool
another criminal
or just the truth, or just the truth
He is heaven's jewel
As He marched up that hill
I can picture Him still in my mind
all the blood and the sweat on His brow
as He passed me on by, I could see in His eyes
that His pain was a gift of His love
He was the sacrifice-the Lamb
and He is the great I AM
and He paid the price for me
the price for you and me-you and me
He made the deaf to hear again
He called the sinful man a friend
He walked that hill for me
so my blind soul could see-could see
As He marched up that hill
I can picture Him still in my mind
all the blood and the sweat on His brow
as He passed me on by, I could see in His eyes
that His pain was a gift of His love
I close my eyes and think about Calvary
I see it happening right in front of me
two criminals were there-with one on either side of Him
one hurled insults and one believed-and one believed
which one am I?
