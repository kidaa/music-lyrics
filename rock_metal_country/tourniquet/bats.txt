You think they'll hit you but they won't
You think they nest in your hair but they don't
You think that feathers is what they got
You think they are a bird, but they are not
The old adage Blind as a bat
The truth is they can see, but not as good as you and me
I used to think that God was always serious
And I could walk the fence, I must have been delirious
I wonder if he laughs
I guess that I'm just curious
The God Jehovah us not feathers, wood, or stone
The Word became flesh and ascended to the throne
He walked the Earth like you and me
And dwelling in our hearts is where we wants to be
