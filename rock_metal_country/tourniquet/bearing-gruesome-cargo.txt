This is why I am the way that I am
This is why I am the way that I am
This is why I am the way that I am
This is why I am the way that I am
You know I'm carrying with me
Over twenty years of pity
My whole personality
Was formed by others, not me
When I look back on my life
One that's always filled with strife
I rode down a bad course
Nobody's fault but yours
My step always threw me right down the stairs
So forgive me when I do the same thing to you
I know it must seem like you're daddy never cares
But if you knew what I've been through
You'd do the same thing too
Well I can't make a move
Without draggin' all my baggage
My father always cursed
So firgive me for my language
Please excuse me for yelling
Pardon me for telling you to stop
Selling to me your God in Heaven
This is why I am the way that I am
This is why I am the way that I am
If I can keep this up for the rest of my days
I may never have to take responsability
For my ways
