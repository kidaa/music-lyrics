Not inclined to come to Him
Inability within
Inward call achieves His end
Sovereignly commenced
Sola Gratia
Covenant to covenant
Salvation never changed
Sola Gratia
Quickened of the third person
Regenerate competence
Not my own, this faith a gift
Boasting set adrift
Sola Fide
Credited as righteousness
Looking far ahead
Sola Fide
Pardoned of iniquity
Forgotten, cast into the sea
Righteousness ascribed to me
Christ alone completed He
Sola Christus
Christ alone completed me
Sola Christus
Fulfilled the Father's Holy law
Unblemished lamb redemption brought
Sinless One received the wrath
Justifying filthy men
