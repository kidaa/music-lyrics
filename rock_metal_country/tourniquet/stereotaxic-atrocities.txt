Brilliant scientific enterprise
The altruistic benefit of humanity justifies
A white lab coat represents the icon
Eradicate disease, the pedestal it stood on
Lies shattered on the floor
Just another day, the dead half a million lay
Your taxes will foot the bill, supply animals to kill
Stinging infusion of chemical
The moribund patient clings to the wall
Another scapegoat to suffer for our sickening vices
You cut their neck, they cut your check
Endless barrage of repitition, satisfies your need
Of colleague competition
Pseudo scientist watches in fascination
As electrode-ridden monkey #32
Has his dignity completly destroyed
We need another $200,000 to find a scientific reason
Why cats land on their feet
Feline fuel for the incinerator
Even though this test will not help the human mess
Continue it anyway, the car payment's due today
