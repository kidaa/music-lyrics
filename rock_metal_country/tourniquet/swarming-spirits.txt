Two spirits call my name
One from glory one from shame
Burning different flames
I must believe I am receiving
True words of light of the Christ
Swarms of Legions
Swarms of demons
Swarms at war today
Swarms to kill men
Swarms to bless them
Swarms that some obey
The Bible speaks of prayer
For those who have faith to dare
Jesus Christ is there
Swarms of Angels
Swarms of Devils
Swarms surrounding me
Swarms to kill men
Swarms to bless them
Swarms that we can't see
