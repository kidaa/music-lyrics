Cranial vault the mind's map paved by heart and soul's aim
Transfer of DNA forms the cerebral mainframe
Just like a computer garbage in - garbage out
Subdural detour shuns the embrace of logic and reason
Shrouded in doubt
Divine mental biopsy reveals you need psycho surgery
The renewing of your mind by cosmic mirror
Spiritual angiography illustrates the mind's sorry state
Barnacle ridden psyche man's own demise to demonstrate
Burrowing mole exposes the dry rot within
Abundance of wormwood, euphorism for sin
Divine mental biopsy reveals you need psycho surgery
By His Spirit the symptoms are starting to clear
Blind cavefish, inbred victim of ocular atrophy
Inky blackness everywhere, there's no reason to see
Wait is someone there? I can feel the heat
Limbs wax useless, help me, can't rise to my feet
Divine mental biopsy reveals you need psycho surgery
A shred of truth is illuminated by miner's light
Divine mental biopsy reveals you need psycho surgery
From the first touch a faint pulse begins to appear
