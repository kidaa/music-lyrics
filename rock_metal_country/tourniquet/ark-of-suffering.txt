You think it's alright to destroy God's creation
They don't have a voice so who cares how we're treating them here
If you read His word you should know that he blessed them
I know your defense is to say God said dominate them
Do you think dominate means to kill just for sport
Wear the fur from their backs
Train them for circus acts
Take our pets to be gassed once their cute age is passed
Don't you see in their eyes how they trust us
But man in his sin turns that trust into horrible pain
When God says to man give account of your life's work
We must be prepared to reply Your creation I loved
Locked behind steel cage
Forced to take drugs we've made
Cut them up just to show
What we already know
Before they die...
Who will hear them cry
