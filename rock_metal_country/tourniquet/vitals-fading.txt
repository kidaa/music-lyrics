Young child drowning in a sea of pain
Body infested with debilitating proteus strain
Distant footsteps approach, but they're not for him
The anticipation of visitors wanes, spirit dim
Through the drone of a hemodialysis machine
God says oh dying frame, there's only one place to lean
Antes de que la muerte venga a llevarte as?br> Quiero que aceptes a mi Hijo, muri?por ti
Before death arrives to take you away like that
I want you to accept my Son, who died for you
Wrinkled hands reach out for cold metal rails
Whom the human bond of callous family ignores
Body starts to shake in violent burning rigors
This decrepit life is so very frail
Though the mountains crumble deep into the sea
God is ever present
He sees everything
