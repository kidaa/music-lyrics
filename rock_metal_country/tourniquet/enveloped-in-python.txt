My pet, my pet-how fun you are
I trust you so much I even leave the cage door ajar
You'd never harm me, but just to be safe-I admire you from afar
The coiling is fast
This time it's your last
Your soul asphyxiated
Final chance for escape terminated
Enveloped in python
Constriction complete
So harmless-me the master-you the slave
I reach out to touch you-I'm getting so brave
You affect me but little-I still haven't changed
And to those who find me abrasive-it's you that's deranged
The coiling is fast
This time it's your last
Your soul asphyxiated
Final chance for escape terminated
Enveloped in python
Constriction complete
Where dreams become nightmares
Of total defeat
Not just a white line or addiction of some kind
But entanglement with anger or to bitterness bind
