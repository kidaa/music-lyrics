The world is quick to tell us
The media compels us
For me to have and you to not
Is the difference in our lot
If you must compound your joy
Then you must acquire this toy
Just remember this - a kiss is just a kiss
A smile is just a smile
The things you own will not atone
Or spare you from the life you've sown
Where moth and rust destroy
A land of tears and sadness
When those who put their faith in things
Find out it's only madness
Enjoy all that He gives you
But make sure you can see through
The haze that blocks the clarity
Of seeing the eternity
Of things that last and things that don't
Of choices we should make, but won't
If you will just incline your ear
There is something you must hear
Heed his words and you'll be free
From loving more than Me
Where moth and rust destroy
A land of tears and sadness
When those who put their faith in things
Find out it's only madness
Choose - you must choose
You must choose
Who you serve
Just waiting in the darkened wings
The voice that says to trust in things
Aspire to acquire - aspire to acquire
Light the sacrificial fire
Death to things
