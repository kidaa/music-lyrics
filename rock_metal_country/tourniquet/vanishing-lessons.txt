Silently vanishing, then reappearing
Slipping away for a while
Start dematerializing before your eyes
Always a step from our grasp
At the turn of the century
Lived a Mr. Houdini
Shrouded in a mystery
He fooled all humanity
Why is it a mystery
The very thing that seems to me
Explains itself so easily
The love of wealth brings misery
Things we acquire means fuel for the fire
The feeling is gone, then our soul we will pawn
Things we acquire means fuel for the fire
The feeling is gone, then our soul we will pawn
Chinese water torture cell
And metamorphosis
Jail escapes, buried alive
Walking through a solid wall
Suicide among the rich
Defies the laws of reason which
Tells us those who have it all
Must often answer to death's call
Things we acquire means fuel for the fire
The feeling is gone, then our soul we will pawn
Dollars for happiness, that's what the world tells us
Pour all yourself in the pursuit of wealth
Things we acquire means fuel for the fire
The feeling is gone, then our soul we will pawn
Dollars for happiness, that's what the world tells us
Pour all yourself in the pursuit of wealth
There are chords in the hearts of the most reckless
which cannot be touched without emotion. Even
with the utterly lost to whom life and death are
equally jests, there are matters of which no jest can
be made
Ever since I was a boy
I have always kept your laws
Now I want to follow you
Join you in your noble cause
Jesus turned to him and said
Sell all you have, give to the poor
The rich your ruler hung his head
Not to follow, walked instead
