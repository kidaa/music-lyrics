A humble man
Moses of Goshen
Behold the plan
You shall deliver them
Out from a land
Escape Egyptians sands
Released from Pharoah's satanic hand
A shameful man
>From the highest clan
Korah could not see Divine Authority
He said: You know that we can be Holy Priests
By fire they tried
By fire they died
Tears of Korah fall from their eyes
Today the same
They rail His Name
Deny the facts of the Savior's act
They say: You know that we can be the Holy Priests
By words you'll try
By words you'll die
Tears of Korah fall from their eyes
