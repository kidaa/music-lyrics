It's not me, it's not mine
Without this shadow my life would shine
Get this monkey off my back
Then I'll choose a better tack
Parameters set far too narrow
Pavement turns to broken gavel
Ten commandments become suggestions
My ordered life starts to unravel
The square is always equal to the sum of the hypotenuse
When you don't believe that what you reap is what you sow - you lose
Indulgence by proxy a rope wound seven times, climb the stairs
Drop the platform, brings an end to my crimes
The gavel fell with such a force
I found my soul in much remorse
The monkey died a bitter death
The shadow faded then engressed
Peeling back the ludicrous thought patterns of my past
Trying to find some meaning try to make it really last
Cerebellum traps a thought and holds it for eternity
Pays me back in broken dreams till I let go that part of me
He heals the broken hearted and binds up their wounds
An alibi is what I need
I hope and pray I find one
The Holy Grail of bitterness
The goblet of grace undone
The shadow returned but this time white
No more my skin dows crawl
Into my world the shadow invite
Sadness left earth's ancient fall
Cerebellum traps a thought and holds it for eternity
Pays me back in broken dreams till I let go that part of me
Indulgence by proxy a broken rope of seven
White shadows glowing hand reaches down from heaven
