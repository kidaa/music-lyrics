A step in the wrong direction
Is one more step closer to hell
Avoiding the vital confession
You're under the enemies spell
Just as a dog will return to his vomit
Some have returned to their wicked old ways
Not even knowing that God becomes jealous
Hearts will stop beating
When people hear Him say...
Ready or not - Here I come!
For heaven sake what are we doing?
Most of us don't eben know
'He's coming back' isn't forever
So, get ready if you wanna go
A.S.A.P.! Say goodbye to the devil
Selfishness, ego, and greed
Soon you will see this is no laughing matter
Freedom will end
When the great I Am says...
Ready or not - Here I come!
What on earth could you possibly be thinking?
No one has the guts to let you know
It's about time you put away your finger
Cuz the church is not our model of perfection
Just as a dog will return to his vomit
Some have returned to their wicked old ways
Not even knowing your heart has been hardened
Your tears will be bleeding
You wake up and your friend are gone
Ready or not - Here I come!
