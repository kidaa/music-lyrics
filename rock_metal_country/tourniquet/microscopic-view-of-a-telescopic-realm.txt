Darwinistic Dante's Inferno partially obstructed preconceptions steering the
helm
Microscopic View of a Telescopic Realm
As the fire's embers faded and wrought their broken, dying ghosts black upon
the ground
And the sunlight sets the clouds aflame
Do you not gaze in wonder of how they became?
What good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his
soul?
And the grandest of valleys and canyons that are cut with the passing of
eons of time
>From a wave of the mightiest hand from the giver of life and beauty sublime
When the tufted footfalls of a jungle beast silently slip past your
panicking feet
And the soul within you marvels and your praise to Him is cast
Do you really think Mr. Darwin's words and thoughts truly are the last?
Chaos, order
As scaled wings erupt in brilliant colors spectrum's view
When a seed becomes a plant and then a tree then starts anew
Of skeletal frame of fins and flight by chance they do appear by might?
Of atoms protoplasmic start will soon contain a beating heart
Chaos, order
As the sunlight sets the clouds aflame, do you not wonder of how they
became?
If the monster lives in the depths of Loch Ness
And the Yeti prowls the nights in the Northwest
He is their Maker - both the Giver of Life, the quencher of strife
From the world's first dividing cell to the loneliest quarters of hell
