See the harlot riding sinner scarlet
She's a city made of souls
To the Devil she will hold... to the end
Madness
Drunken blindness...fallen! is her kingdom
Future people living out an ancient sin
Before they can win the wedding begins
Queen of ultra darkness harlot of hate
Because of your lust you'll never escape
The pride on your lips is sealing your fate... You just wait!
You've boasted glory as your own
You kept the children from their home
No more
Blind eyes
Say goodbye to all your lies
The chosen live again
Free from sin
New life within
Broken humans consecrated by the One they once degraded
Hateful whores transformed to virgins
Delivered from a way that scourged Him
They scourged Him
Virgin bride the Holy blood justified
Your spiritual birth from out of His side
Now the marriage never dies... open your eyes
