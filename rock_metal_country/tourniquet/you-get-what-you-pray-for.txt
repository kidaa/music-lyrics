All of a sudden
This big world will end
Bollions of people
Will wish it never began
Let us pray
No amount of wisdom
Stature or wealth
Will impress the ever-loving God
Or that is Christ Himself
Let us pray
You get what you pray for
Forgiveness and grace Lord
Ohh - That's what I need
You get what you pray for
Salvation is there for you
Get on your knees
Do you really think
That God grades on a curve
When all of the answers
Are found in the Word
Let us pray
Who shall you blame
When you're standing in flames
Ya can't pray to Jesus
He won't know your name
Let us pray
You get what you pray for
And that's what it's there for
Ohh - That's what I need
You get what you pray for
And God knows what's best for you
Oh - Get on your knees
You say there's so many things that you need
You never get them cause they would decieve you
A man can't stumble
When he's on his knees
So let us pray!
All of sudden
God's grace will be torn
Billion's of hell bound
Will wish they never were born
Let us pray
None of your excuses
Or shattering yells
Will turn the head of God
Who once called for your help
Lets us pray
You get what you pray for
And that's what it's there for
Oh - that's what I need
You get what you pray for
What more could you ask for
Oh - but ya gotta believe!
You say there's so many things that you need
You never listen so you won't receive
Seek first the kingdom He knows what you need before you pray
You get what you pray for
