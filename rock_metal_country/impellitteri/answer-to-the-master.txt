you keep on running, been lonely for too long
out on the boulevard, the hammer's coming down
you feel the pressure, the fire in the storm
you need another way, a shelter from the war
let me take you past the fears inside your mind
let me take you to the mansion in the sky
answer to the master, gonna' bring you to your knees
breakaway the chains, he will give you rest
answer to the master, when we reach our destiny
every knee shall bow, every toungue confess
do you remember the power of the flame
your mama told you that love will never end
you used to tell me there's freedom in the sky
you're staying down too long, it's time for you to fly
let me take you past the limits of your mind
let me take you to the mansion in the sky
answer to the master, gonna bring you to your knees
breakaway the chains, he will give you rest
answer to the master, when we reach our destiny
every knee shall bow, every tongue confess
solo
answer to the master, gonna' bring you to your knees
breakaway the chains, he will give you rest
answer to the master, when we reach our destiny
every knee shall bow, every tongue confess
answer to the master, gonn' bring you to your knees
breakaway the chains, he will give you rest
answer to the master, when we reach our destiny
every knee shall bow, every tongue confess
answer to the master, gonna' bring you to your knees
breakaway the chains, he will set you free
