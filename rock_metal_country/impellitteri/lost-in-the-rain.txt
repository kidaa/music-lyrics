They bring on the night
the sun slowly fading away
nothing will tame
the nightmare that runs through your day
Still you remain, Lost in the rain
with nothing to gain, Lost in the rain.
You never come down
you never stop running away
fall to your knees
they control you whatever you say
Still you remain, Lost in the rain
You're Lost in the rain
with nothing to gain, you're Lost in the rain
When will you learn
your life's quickly slipping away
Break from your chains
free yourself before it's too late
Still you remain, Lost in the rain, with nothing gain
Lost in the rain
You're Lost in the rain, with nothing to gain
You're Lost in the rain!
