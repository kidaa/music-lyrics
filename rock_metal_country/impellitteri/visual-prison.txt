I'm watching you at home from my prison cell alone
Trapped here inside my visual prison
Deadly stare into the monitor screen
Mesmerized by the latest scenes
Switching channels from the ends of the earth
Comatose by the thoughts received
Visual Prison
I'm trapped inside my visual prison
The whole world's alive from my field of vision
Main attraction from across the sea
To the wars in the holy land
Chain reaction from a satellite
My remote controller's in my hand
Visual Prison
I'm trapped inside my visual prison
The whole world's alive from my field of vision
I've got you in my sight
You're on my screen tonight
You're in my field of vision
solo
See life passing on the monitoring screen
The world so small pictured here at my feet
Visual decline etched upon my mind
Trapped here inside my prison
I'm trapped inside my visual prison
The whole world's alive from my field of vision
Visual, visual prison
I'm trapped inside my field of vision
Visual prison, yea, visual prison
I've got you in my sight
Visual prison
