Wake up Sally have you heard the news,
I've got a brand new band,
I'm gonna kick the blues, now baby,
just hold on to my hand
Get up now, I've got some work to do,
I see my guiding light,
It's gonna see me through, now baby,
I'm sticking to my guns
Now don't you tell me what to say,
don't you tell me what to do,
'Till you're looking through my eyes
and you walk inside my shoes
What it is, what it ain't, tell me who are you to say,
I just look beyond your world
and I see a brighter day
You say I'm living inside a dream
I'm just a stranger to the scene
You think I'm just a punk on the streets
But I'm the future's way
Now I've been up and baby I've been down,
I've been looking all around,
But momma, I ain't now painted clown
I've got my way, and I know you've got yours,
don't try to keep pushing me
Through your doors, 'cause momma,
I've got a mind of my own
pre-chorus
solo
Now I'm living this life, changing the world
and making it mine
This rebellious child is walking the edge
'cause life ain't no crime
chorus
