Walking the streets for a saviour
Hunting you down soon or later
You've opened your mind at a critical time
And it cuts through your heart like a razor
Letting you bleed on the sidewalk
Washing you down with their kind talk
Selling their pride and temptation to hide
From the wisdom that comes from the pure rock
What I plainly see before my eyes
Makes me finally realize
When the heart is blind
You bleed in silence
Let the words of truth begin to shine
They will stand the test of time
When the heart is blind
You bleed in silence
Twisted by tales of a demon
Changing leaves with the season
Tossed by the waves in a delicate phase
And it leaves you alone with no reason
What I plainly see before my eyes
Makes me finally realize
When the heart is blind
You bleed in silence
Let the words of truth begin to shine
They will stand the test of time
When the heart is blind
You bleed in silence
What I plainly see before my eyes
Makes me finally realize
When the heart is blind
You bleed in silence
Let the words of truth begin to shine
They will stand the test of time
When the heart is blind
Walking the streets for a savior
Hunting you down soon or later
You've opened your mind at a critical time
And it cuts your heart like a razor
When the heart is blind
You bleed in silence
