I could see the city lights
then they turned to black
then I heard a sirens crying sounding out ATTACK!
I could see the rockets glare
shooting in the night
everyone was praying for their lives
am I dreaming
I don't believe it
am I wrong or right
then I heard a voice say in the night
I'm a warrior, take my hand!
let me lead you to the promised land
I'm a warrior, take my hand!
I'm a soldier under his command
then I saw this blinding light
I heard a sonic boom
I could feel the earth shake in the doom
I couldn't see him
but I could feel him
lift me to the sky
I could hear the voice that saved my life
I'm a warrior, take my hand!
let me lead you to the promised land
I'm a warrior, take my hand!
I'm a soldier under his command
solo
am I dreaming
I don't believe it
am I wrong or right
then I heard a voice say in the night
I'm a warrior, take my hand!
let me lead you to the promised land
I'm a warrior, take my hand!
I'm a soldier under his command
I'm a warrior
take my hand!
