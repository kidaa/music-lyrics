Deep in the heart of a stranger
Under the haze of the city lights
Wasting away and he's starting to fade into winter
The music is calling his name
Never will life be the same again
I share it with you and together the vision will lead us
Stand or fall
Together we can have it all
Whenever I look in your eyes, I know you believe
Stand or fall
Together we'll get through it all
Tell everyone out there you know you've got to be free
Take me away from the madness
Hide me away in your secret place
A traveler in time with the words and rhyme and the reason
Hearing your voice in the night
Leading me into the light of love
Together we'll share in the harmony there without treason
Stand or fall
Together we can have it all
Whenever I look in your eyes, I know you believe
Stand or fall
Together we'll get through it all
Tell everyone out there you know you've got to be free
Stand or fall
Together we can have it all
Whenever I look in your eyes, I know you believe
Stand or fall
Together we'll get through it all
Tell everyone out there you know you've got to be free
