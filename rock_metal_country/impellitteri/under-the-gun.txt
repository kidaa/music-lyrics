Every night I have the same ol' dream,
An angel standing in the sun over me
I see you walking on a sea of glass,
Holding up your love at last
In falling rain, you're so far away
In the silent night
you can hear me screaming out your name
When you're under the gun, it's a cold sensation
When you're under the gun, it's a blue damnation
Everyday I feel the same way,
Save your pictures then throw 'em away
Just a taste of your bittersweet,
Keeps me full of your love for weeks
In the falling rain, you're so far away
In the silent night
you can hear me screaming out your name
When you're under the gun, it's a cold sensation
When you're under the gun, it's a blue damnation
