She worked so hard for Hollywood
Papers signed at immigration
Left her country and home for good
Last destination
*Tonight I will fly
This night I will fly
On a house at Beachwood two four twenty eight
The LA moon shone down like fire
Inside the outsider burning up,
Dance ballerina
Repeat *
Into the air to fly gracefully
Bird of perfection
Repeat *
