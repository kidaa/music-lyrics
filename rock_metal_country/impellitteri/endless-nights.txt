I've got the fever, just a crazy child,
I've got my cashbox baby,
Gonna meet my friends down at the strip,
gonna get me some lip
Jump in my limo, gonna make the scene,
gonna cruise the boulevard
With the latest beauty queen, one lean machine
We're up all night to cruise the streets
For every mile there's a party to see
This crazy life never sleeps
And the wheels go round and round
It's an endless night in this tinsel town
All the streets alive with the party sound
See the pretty girls all cruisin' around
Under the neon lights
We've got the action, no standing still,
let's take this madness
To the mansion on the hill, can't get my fill
One hot Jacuzzi, big swimming pool,
under the moonlight
No way to keep the rules, it's just to cool
pre-chorus
solo
chorus out
