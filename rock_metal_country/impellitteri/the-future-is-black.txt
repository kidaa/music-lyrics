in the streets of San Francisco up in Washington, D.C.
there's a movement that's crossing all the lines
while we speed into the future,
the deceiver plants the seeds
and he hides from you the truth behind the lies
the blind will lead the blind
into the valley of sorrow
into the night they will ride
if you look behind the secrets,
in between the lust and greed
you will see the motives coming from the heart
in the shadows of division,
in the cracks of human pride
we only fight for what we cannot hide
the blind will lead the blind
into the valley of sorrow
into the night they will ride
can't you see there's a levy of tears in my eyes
and I don't know if I can hold back
take the trouble and pain that my two eyes have seen
and I know that the future is black
look at you now
look at you now, baby
the future is black
there's no turning back
the future is black
solo
see the world spinning out of control
one look in the past the future won't last
can't you see there's a levy of tears in my eyes
and I don't know if I can hold back
take the trouble and pain that my two eyes have seen
and I know that the future is black
look at you now
look at you now, baby
the future is black
there's no turning back
the future is black
