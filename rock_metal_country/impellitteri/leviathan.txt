Hebridian winds blow
Across the water of your homeland
Are you just a shadow
As the mist upon the Highlands
Run deep, silently
Lost forever
*Somewhere in the dark water
Somewhere in the dark water
Manitu, your brother
Share the water of your ocean
Legends are reality
Misunderstanding what our eyes have seen
Run deep, silently
Lost forever
Repeat *
Run deep silently
Lost forever
