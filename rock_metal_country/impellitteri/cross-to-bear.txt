Everybody's got their cross to bear
The cards were dealt, life ain't fair
It's what you do with what you got
You can cry a little you can give a lot
There's always something to share
The miracle of love is all you need
To break the chains, to set you free
And lately, I see, the loneliness will fade
Falling, like a river from your eyes
See the tears roll down, another victim of the night
How far will people go?
How long until it shows
That we've been hiding from the light?
I want to know what love always meant to be
Cuz I've been blinded by the lie
I've come this far to find I don't know what I need
Everyone's got their cross to bear
Calling, in the middle of the night
When you need a friend, cuz something ain't right
Your heart is bought and sold
And now it leaves you cold
I want to know what love always meant to be
Cuz I've been blinded by the lie
I've come this far to find I don't know what I need
Everyone's got their cross to bear
solo
The cards were dealt, and life's unfair
Everybody's got their cross to bear
Cross to bear
Cross to bear
Everybody's got their cross to bear
