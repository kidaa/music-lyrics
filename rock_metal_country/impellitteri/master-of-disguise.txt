There I was in the Garden of Eden, the serpent, more crafty
than any of the wild animals that the Lord God had made.
There she was Eve, in paradise, and willing to give me a 
listen. So I said, "Did God really say you must not eat from 
any tree in the garden?" And she responded, "We may eat fruit 
from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. You must
not touch it or you will die!"..."Ha! I say!"
Master! Master of disguise! Master! Master of disguise!
I am the prince of earth, the ruler of the air
I'm on the prowl like a lion
Searching for someone to devour and destroy
And in return I give you nothing.
Master! Master of disguise!
Twist eternal truth into white lies.
Master! Master of disguise!
Turning into gray, the black and white.
I send delusion as I lead the world astray
You know my heart's filled with fury!
All sorts of evil I provide temptation for
I am the test of human freedom.
Master! Master of disguise!
Twist eternal truth into white lies.
Master! Master of disguise!
Turning into gray, the black and white.
You can't get away from me,
'cause I know what you really want
I am the great deceiver, 
The father of all lies! And I've got your number!
Master! Master of disguise!
Twist eternal truth into white lies.
Master! Master of disguise!
Turning into gray, the black and white.
Master! Master of disguise!
I can hear you whispering your lies
. Master! Master of disguise!
Don't you know you're running out of time?
Liar!
