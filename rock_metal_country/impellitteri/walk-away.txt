Look at the violence that rages in your heart
Screaming in silence, it's tearing you apart
Burning with vengeance, need an answer for your soul
Consider the damage, got nothing you can show
And as you travel on the road of desperation
You always wonder what your life could be
And as you're going though the trials and tribulation
I hope someday you see what I see
The final solution is knocking at your door
It's not an illusion, you're a casualty of war
The need of the Savior is calling on the wind
Breaking the darkness, the new day will begin
And as you travel on the road of revelation
You always wonder what your life could be
And as you're going though the trials and tribulation
I hope someday you see what I see
walk away!
Walk away, you're a prisoner of lies
It's got a hold on you that makes you compromise
walk away!
Walk away, you're a prisoner of lies
It's only fear itself that keeps you chained alive
walk away!
Walk away, you're a prisoner of lies
It's got a hold on you that makes you compromise
walk away!
Walk away, you're a prisoner of lies
It's only fear itself that keeps you chained alive
Walk away
