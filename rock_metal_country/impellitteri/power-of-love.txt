Well I believe in the power of love,
It give me strength to carry on
It's the only hope that keeps me alive,
When I feel I can't go on
Out in the streets I've seen a thousand empty eyes
Never surrender, no, take the power of love
When you're down so low, the only way is up,
Just try reaching for the sky
When you've got nothing else, nothing left to lose,
That's when you open your eyes
Out in the streets I've seen a thousand broken dreams,
Nothing is ever like it seems
Never surrender, never give up on your love
Never surrender, 'cause the only way is up
Never surrender, take the power of love
and never surrender
