It goes on and on all through the day
On and on, my love will remain
Don't you know it's never too late
To turn the hand of fate
There you were, burned by love
Left a bitter taste, a heart of stone
Now you're strong and you start walking
Leaving me all alone
I don't care what the neighbor's thinking
I don't care, what do they know
All I need is to feel your lovin'
A memory that's never been sold
When are you coming back for me
I know it's soon
I know the sun will shine again
I'll wait for you
It goes on and on into the day
On and on, my love will remain
Don't you know it's never too late
To turn the hand of fate
On and on into the night
Can't you see, our love is so right
Holding on, I'll never let go
My love will never fade
Here I stand, my heart's wide open
Take my hand, we'll start again
Trust in me, tomorrow is coming
I don't need to understand
When are you coming back for me
I know it's soon
I know the sun will shine again
I'll wait for you
It goes on an don into the day
On and on, my love will remain
Don't you know it's never too late
To turn the hand of fate
On and on into the night
Can't you see, our love is so right
Holding on, I'll never let go
My love will never fade
On and on into the day
On and on, my love will remain
Don't you know it's never too late
To turn the hand of fate
On and on into the night
Can't you see, our love is so right
Holding on, I'll never let go
My love will never fade
On and on all through the day
On and on, my love will remain
On and on, it's never too late
On and on, to change your fate
On and on...
