Searching for someone so long
To fill this hole in my heart
I've tried everything I could find
Nothing could set me apart
I've been searching for all my life
I know there is no one like you
Looking back over the years
Wasting so much precious time
All of the heartbreak and tears I've cried
Lead me to this place in time
I've been searching for all my life
I know there is no one like you
I'm walking in paradise
My heart is in heaven as long I'm with you in paradise
I'm walking in heaven with you
Forever my heart will be true
Surrendering all that I am
I know that you're faithful and true
Taking me so far beyond my dreams
Anything I ever know
I've been searching for all my life
I know there is no one like you
I'm walking in paradise
My heart is in heaven as long as I'm near you in paradise
You're all I believe in forever we'll stay here in paradise
I'm walking in heaven as long as I'm with you, paradise,
Forever in heaven with you
Always my heart will be true
Paradise
I'm walking in heaven as long as I'm with you, paradise,
I'm walking in heaven with you
Forever my heart will be true
Forever I'll share life with you
Always devoted to you
