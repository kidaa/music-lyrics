Deep in the night
I see you stand there
Shadows in my mind
Closing my eyes
The dreams come rushing back
And they've got control of me
You've taken me by surprise, oh
You've got me hypnotized
Burning, Burning in my mind
Burning, I'm burning for your love
.
Remember the days
Finding the rainbow's end
Wish upon a falling star
When will it end
Your memory's haunting me
And you're forever out of reach
You've taken me by surprise, oh
You've got me mesmerized
Burning, Burning in my mind
Burning, I'm burning for your love
I feel your fire
Lifting me higher
And I lose control
Burning, Burning in my mind
Burning, Burning for your love
Burning, Burning in my mind
Burning, Burning for your love
Burning in my mind!
