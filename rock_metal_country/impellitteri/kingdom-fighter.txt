Out in the heavenly realms is where it all begins
Unseen and out of sight, the spirit world within
The battle rages on, the war behind the scenes
It's not your flesh and blood, but the powers in between
In the shadows of the night
You're caught between darkness and light
In the shadows of your mind
You choose between wrong and the right
