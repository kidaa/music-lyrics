She's a lonely girl, holding secrets deep inside
It's a crazy world, when your heart 
and mind collide
A prisoners' action, she's trying to run away
Doesn't know what she'll find,
but she's got to get away
I hear you cry out in the heat of the night
I didn't know I was your ball and chain
Cry out just see the light
I didn't know I was the one to blame
There was a time we shared,
we had all the words to say
But somewhere along this road,
we went our separate ways
I hear you cry out in the heat of the night
I didn't know I was your ball and chain
Cry out just to see the light
I didn't know I was the one to blame
Cry out in the heat of the night
I didn't know I was your ball and chain
You turn and you walk away
Leaving me standing here
With nothing, no words to say
Your silence is clear
solo
chorus out
