I'm not looking for an answer
Because I'll always know the truth
When I'm walking through the fire
I know I will never lose
I hear the sweet voice of the love I can't deny
I will surrender to the love I know is mine
I will remember your promises
When I'm cold, your arm's around me
When I'm high, you let me fly
When I fear, you are my refuge
You wipe the teardrop from my eye
I hear the sweet voice of the love I can't deny
I will surrender to the love I know is mine
I will remember what you always say
I'll be with you, all the way
I'll never leave you, I will not turn away
I'll be with you, all the way
I'll never leave you, you know my love will remain
My love will remain
