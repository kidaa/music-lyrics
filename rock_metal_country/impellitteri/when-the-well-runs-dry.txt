Time's tickin' money's slippin' away
Can't keep a hold of it any way
Sick and tired of being pushed around
You don't know me, like you think you do
No you can't show me
Goin' down to the river, when the well runs dry
Drownin' in my sorrows, 'cause I'm living a lie
Searchin' for a savior before I die
See the dirty water as it turns to wine
Love's quicker throw the liquor away
No rhyme and reason so get out of my way
Lost and found don't be messin' around
Can't hear the river run without a sound
You don't know me, like I think you do
Honey, you can't show me
Down to the river, when the well runs dry
Drownin' in my sorrows, 'cause I'm living a lie
Searchin' for a savior before I die
See the dirty water as it turns to wine
I used to think that I could jump and touch the sky,
But now I know my time has come, it's do or die.
