I see you standing in your garden full of stone
wrapped around your heart so you will never be alone
can't you see I want to give you all you need
don't you know by now
there's no future in the past when life goes by so fast-
just hold the line hold the line
life's a journey til the end of time hold the line
and soon the sun will rise
your sanctuary is hanging from a chain
wrapped around your neck
, but it won't take away the pain
seems to me you don't know what to believe
you should know by now
when the sands of wasted time leave you high and dry-
just hold the line hold the line
life's a journey til the end of time hold the line
and soon the sun will rise
the end of time hold the line
soon the sun will shine just hold the line hold the line
life's a journey til
the end of time hold the line
soon the sun will shine just hold the line hold the line
you've got to hold on
hold on, hold the line
