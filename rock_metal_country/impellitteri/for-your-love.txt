I was crossing the line one too many times
I was living on the run
Turning my face from the scene of the crime
When I saw the smoking gun
Day after day I tried to find a new way
Tried to fill this emptiness
Nothing but tears, another wasted year
I was covered with loneliness
I'm not asking for your sympathy
I know I'm the one to blame
Life was taking it's toll, I was losing control
It was driving me insane
One look at you I finally knew
I had to change my evil ways
Let your mercy shine it's light on me
Let my heartache feel your touch
In my time of trial and agony
I never know I was so lost
Lost in a world without your love, it's the price I had to pay
You know I've been lonely for so long, for your love
Now that I finally found my way, back to your heart
I'm here to stay
You know I've been lonely for so long for your love
In my time of trial and agony
I never before knew I was so lost
Lost in a world without your love, it's the price I had to pay
You know I've been lonely for so long, for your love
Now that I finally found my way, back to your heart
I'm here to stay
You know I've been lonely for so long for your love
You know I've been lonely for your love
