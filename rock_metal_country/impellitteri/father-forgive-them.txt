Father forgive them, they know not what they do
Dancing with the devil, gonna walk all over you
Turn your back to reason, sanding on your pride
For everything's a season and there's no where you can hide
I don't know, I don't know where you're going 
But time is so tight
Mother teach your children, your innocence won't last
Face the grand illusion, you hide behind the mask
Looking out for number one, you're running with the pack
You're living for the moment, the day is coming fast
Father forgive them, they know not what they do
They're taking their chances and playing with you
Over and over they don't count the cost
Sin after sin, nailed to the cross
Father forgive them, they know not what they do
They're taking their chances and playing with you
Over and over they don't count the cost
Sin after sin, nailed to the cross
