...your castles are burning...
So you're the king of the action
You want to have it all
But I say your headed for a fall
You're like a man on a mission
You wanna wear the crown down
You're fuel for the fire
You're castles burning, there's fire in the sky
The wheels always turning, it's your turn to do or die
You hear the call of the prophet
But you ain't got the time
You let the smoke get in your eyes
Now you refuse to listen
The word you can't deny
Your destiny is on the line
You're fuel for the fire
You're castles burning, there's fire in the sky
The wheels always turning, you're living a lie
Your castles are falling, the flames burning high
Your demons are calling, it's your turn to do or die
So you're the king of the action
You want to have it all
But I say your headed for a fall
I see the rod of lightening
It's gonna strike you down
I see the ashes all around
You're fuel for the fire
You're castles are burning there's fire in the sky
The wheels always turning, you're living a lie
Your castles are falling, the flames burning high
Your demons are calling, it's your turn to do or die
