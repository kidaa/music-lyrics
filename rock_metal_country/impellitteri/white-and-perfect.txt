Here comes the Englishman
Perfect in his perfection
Steals like a thief and runs
Turns you round to his religion
We will take Africa, rule Britannia
We shall have India, rule Britannia
*To save the world
We take our world
White and perfect
Shine brightly, while you can
White and mighty and all knowing
Now that your time is done,
Over-rated and outdated
Give me my Africa, rule Britannia,
I shall have India, rule Britannia
Repeat *
Save the world
Save the world
