they say in time that all my wounds will heal
but they don't know all the pain I feel
so I ask you now, won't you be my guide
and maybe hold me to the end of time
and if I look into your eyes
what will I see
will it be the answer the the mystery
I'll wait for you tonight
I'll wait with open arms
and if it takes forever
to make it right
I'll wait to 'til the end of time
I'll wait for you
a painted picture says a thousand words
I see the colors, but I never learn
I ask you this, have I gone too far
or am I reaching for a shooting star
and if I look into your eyes
what will I see
will it be the answer to the mystery
I'll wait for you tonight
I'll wait with open arms
and if it takes forever
to make it right
I'll wait to 'til the end of time 
I'll wait for you
solo
I'll wait for you tonight
I'll wait with open arms
and if it takes forever
to make it right
I'll wait to 'til the end of time 
I'll wait for you tonight
I'll wait with open arms
and if it takes forever
to make it right
I'll wait to 'til the end of time 
I'll wait for you
