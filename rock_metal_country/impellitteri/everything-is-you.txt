Feel the power rushing through my veins
Since you came into my life
Feel your love electrify
You steal away the night
Down so low and maybe more
My back's against the wall
Turned and saw the face of love
The price you paid it all
Everything I do and everything I say
Everything I need is you
Every little word and every little thought
Every single thing is you
I'm all fired up and ready to go
My body, mind and soul
Passion like adrenaline
I'm ready to explode
Feed me with your tenderness
The driver of my heart
Lead me to your holiness
A real fine place to start
Everything I do and everything I say
Everything I need is you
Every little word and every little thought
Every single thing is you
Everything I do and everything I say
Everything I need is you
Ever little word and every little thought
Every single thing is you 
Take me to the sea of love, where everything's OK
Wash me in the stars above where children like play
I can rest my weary soul and I can walk the streets of gold
The shadow of your loving wings forever I will stay
Everything I do and everything I say
Everything I need is you
Every little word and every little thought
Every single thing is you
Everything I do and everything I say
Everything I need is you
Ever little word and every little thought
Every single thing is you
Feel the power rushing through my veins
Since you came into my life
Feel your love electrify
You steal away the night
All fired up and ready to go
My body, mind and soul
Passion like adrenaline
And I'm ready to explode
Everything I do and everything I say
Every little word, every single thing is you
Everything is you! Everything is you!
