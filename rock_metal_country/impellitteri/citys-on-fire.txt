Long John Silver's got his head in the clouds
Sleeping on the concrete and he's thinking out loud
When's the man gonna bring the candy cane
Selling dreams in the city lights
A stranger's kiss is the dead man's bite
It's a shame when their falling threw the cracks
When the sun goes down,
that's when the night rages on
When the thrill is gone,
that's when you've got to hang on
The city's on fire,
Taking life upon demand,
passing through the dirty hands
The city's on fire,
And it's time to take it back from the man 
across the tracks
A street smart talker with a gun in his hand,
A big John Wayne out to fight for the land
Life's a dare when you're running with the pack
Another day and another crime,
One more deal and now you're doing time,
Never learn when you fight the American way
When the sun goes down,
that's when the night rages on
When the thrill is gone,
that's when you've got to hang on
The city's on fire,
Taking life upon demand,
passing through the dirty hands
The city's on fire,
And it's time to take it back from the man 
across the tracks
The city's on fire,
You know you've lost control
when you're selling off your soul
The city's on fire,
Stepping closer to the grave,
you can't afford to look away
