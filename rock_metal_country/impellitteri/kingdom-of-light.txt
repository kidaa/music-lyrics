No more tears, no more pain, no more crying in the rain
No more sorrow, no more blame, in the kingdom of light
No more fear, no more lies, no temptation, open eyes
Finally found my piece of mind on the road to paradise
The revelation of the word is rocking the ages
Bringing solution to the world, the fire is raging on
Another time, another place, and we'll be standing face to face
Life will be an open page, in the kingdom of the light
No more night, no more day, everything has passed away
Got to find the narrow way that leads to paradise
The revelation of the word is rocking the ages
Bringing solution to the world, the fire is raging 
Woe to the nations and kings of the earth
When heaven comes down for the final re-birth
Taking our place with the Ancient of Days
Ruling the kingdom of light
The kingdom of light!
Woe to the nations and kings of the earth
When heaven comes down for the final re-birth
Taking our place with the Ancient of Days
Ruling the kingdom of light
Woe to the nations and kings of the earth
When heaven comes down for the final re-birth
Taking our place with the Ancient of Days
Ruling the kingdom of light
The kingdom of light!
