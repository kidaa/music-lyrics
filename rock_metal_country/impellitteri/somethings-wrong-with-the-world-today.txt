the beggar on the street, it's enough to make you weep
he wants something he can shoot through his veins
tearing up the place when the heart begins to race
and the needle fills the great escape
selling neverland, build your house upon the sand
with your feet planted deep in the grave
wasting precious time, trying to kill his empty mind
and his spirit's dying on the way
your life is just a mist before the late autumn breeze
there's got to be a reason for the air we breathe
where's the wrong with the share
where's the hope, we need to care
where's the faith in our society
something's wrong with the world today
something's wrong with the world today
shooting in the park, raping in the dark
child abuse going on and on
stealing everywhere and no one seems to care
fornication running all around
trying to find a reason for the things that we do
no one's got a minute when there's nothing to prove
trying to find a reason for the things that we do
no one's got a minute when there's nothing to prove
where's the love we need to share
where's the hope, we need to care
where's the faith in our society
find the justice and the law
where's the peace, where has it gone
who's the jury of our sanity
something's wrong with the world today
something's wrong with the world today
solo
something's wrong with the world today
something's wrong with the world today
