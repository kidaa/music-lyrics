In the silence of the night, can you hear the cries?
Can you feel suffering?
In the eyes of young America, the tears begin to fall
The streets are filled with predators and broken hearts
Shot down and left for dead, so victimless crime
Those satellites are watching everything decline
Words have been spoken, promises broken
Tears in the eyes of the world
Anger, frustration, mind manipulation
Tears in the eyes of the world
Can you feel the suffering?
IF you have ears, let them hear; if you have eyes, let them see
Can you feel?
In your face another tragedy, another waste of life
Your sanity will push the image from your mind
Cut down in agony, this culture of death
A trail of pain that takes away your very breath
Dying traditions, selfish ambitions
Tears in the eyes of the world
Anger, frustration, sheer desperation
Tears in the eyes of the world
There's no vision, there's no life
Is there time to get it right?
Tears in the eyes of the world
Will the sun refuse to shine?
Will the stars fall from the sky?
Tears in the eyes of the world
In the silence of the night, can you hear the cries?
Tears in the eyes of the world
Can you feel the suffering, can you pay the price?
Tears in the eyes of the world
