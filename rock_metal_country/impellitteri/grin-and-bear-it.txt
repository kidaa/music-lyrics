Forty days and forty nights
In the hot desert sand
I've paid my dues all my life
And now it's out of my hands
Take a look inside, nothing ever comes easy
When it's cold outside, keep your passion alive
You've got to grin and bear it
Don't let it get you down
You've got to grin and bear it
You know you've got to stand you're ground
In the storms of fire and ice
Keep your eye on the prize
You've got to fight the good fight
And it always takes time
Take a look inside, nothing ever comes easy
Keep the dream alive,
you don't know what you'll find
You've got to grin and bear it
Let nothing move your soul
You've got to grin and bear it
Don't wanna lose control
GGGG-Grin!
Don't let it get you down
You've got to grin and bear it
You know you've got to stand your ground
You've got to believe in what you do
and who you are,
Nothing comes easy
when you're chasing down the star
solo
you've got to fight for who you are,
Grin and bear it
