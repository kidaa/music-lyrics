when you shed your blood for me
when you shed your blood for me
You shed your blood for me, I finally realize
I never want to be so far from your light
You got a hold on me, I know it can't be wrong
And I know our love is strong
Well, I was on the road, that never satisfied
I've finally found my home with you by my side
All I really need, I find inside of you
And I know that it's right
I know you shed your blood for me
Now I realize, can't live without you
Shed your blood for me
Need your sacrifice, I'm burning without you
You defy the fire, take up your cross
Lifting me higher, saving the lost
Shed your blood for me
Now I realize, can't live without you
Shed your blood for me
Need your sacrifice, I'm burning without you
You defy the fire, take up your cross
Lifting me higher, saving the lost
You defy the fire, take up your cross
Lifting me higher, saving the lost
