You can see it in your life
You can feel it hold you tight
And I know just where you go
'cause you're hiding from the light
You can't deny the fear in your mind
Walk before you run 'cause you're
Under the gun
Feeling it burn inside,
Knowing what's on the line
There's still time to turn away
You've only just begun
To play with Fire
Play with Fire
You keep spinning like a wheel
You're still looking for a deal
Take your dreams and tie you down
Steal your time you're losing ground
You can't believe what you never see
Open up your eyes
Escape to the light
Hearing the words they lie
Promising paradise
There's still time to turn away
You've only just begun 
To Play with Fire, Play with Fire
Play with Fire, you Play with Fire
No don't listen to liars
They'll never take you higher
Now turn away 
You're Playing with Fire!
You can see it in your life
You can feel it hold you tight
Take you're dreams and tie you down
Steal your time, you're losing ground
You can't deny the fear in your mind
Open up your eyes, escape to the light
Feeling it burn inside
Knowing what's on the line
There's still time to turn away
You've only just begun
to Play with Fire
Play with Fire
You Play with Fire
