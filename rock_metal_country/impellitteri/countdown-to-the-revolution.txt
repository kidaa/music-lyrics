I've got a reason for living, I've got my eye on the sky
I know my sins are forgiven, and now I'm ready to die
When I survey all the madness, on the face of the earth
There's got to be retribution, to put an end to the curse
Countdown to the revolution
Don't you know judgment day is at hand?
Countdown to the revolution
Can't you see it's a part of the plan?
Take the law from the mountain, run to the book of life
With an army of angels, He will spare your life
Countdown to the revolution
Don't you know judgment day is at hand?
Countdown to the revolution
Can't you see it's a part of the plan?
Countdown to the revolution
It's your life in the palm of your hand
Countdown to the revolution
In the light, are you ready to stand?
Countdown to the revolution
Don't you know judgment day is at hand?
Countdown to the revolution
Can't you see it's a part of the plan?
Countdown to the revolution
It's your life in the palm of your hand
Countdown to the revolution
In the light, are you ready to stand?
