I get the same old dreams
Same time every night
Fall to the ground then I wake up
So I get out of bed
Put on my shoes and in my head
Thoughts slide back to the break up
These four walls are closing in
Look at the fix you put me in
*Since you've been gone
Since you've been gone
I'm out of my head
Can't take it
Do not be wrong
But since you've been gone
You cast a spell so break it
Since you've been gone
So in the night I stay
Beneath the back street lights
I read the words that you sent to me
I can take the afternoon
But night comes around too soon
You don't know what you mean to me
Your poison letters
Your telegram
Just goes to show you don't give a damn
Repeat *
Since you've been gone
If you ever come back
Baby you know, you'll never do wrong
Repeat *
Ever since you've been gone
**Since you've been gone
Since you've been gone
I'm out of my head
I can't take it
Repeat ** to fade
