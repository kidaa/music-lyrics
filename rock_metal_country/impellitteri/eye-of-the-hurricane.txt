Into the eye, eye of the hurricane
Black clouds are rushing in
The storm is ready to strike
The lightening flashes through the wasteland
Caught between the earth and sky
Hear the thunder roar
Got to find the key to the open door.
Runaway, hideaway,
Into the eye of the hurricane
Find your way, to saving grace,
Inside the eye of the hurricane.
Nations are rising up
There's war and rumors of war
Still there is famine, floods, and earthquakes
Persecution and distress
See the love grow cold
Just another sign as the day unfolds
Runaway, hideaway,
Into the eye of the hurricane
Find your way, to saving grace,
Inside the eye
Runaway, hideaway,
Into the eye of the hurricane
Find your way, to saving grace,
Inside the eye of the hurricane.
Hurricane!!
