I Can Tell There's Something You Don't Wanna Tell Me
It's Killing You 'Cause The Words Are Hard To Find
I Know You Want To Break It To Me Gently
Well Sweet Baby Say What's On Your Mind

[Chorus:]
Let 'Er Rip, Let It Fly
Come On Baby, Say It, Do You Think I'm Gonna Cry
I Ain't About To Bawl, And I Ain't Gonna Die
So If You're Gonna Say Goodbye, Don't Take All Day And Night
Let 'Er Rip, Let It Fly

Why The Drama, We Don't Have To Drag Out This Situation
It Wasn't You, It Wasn't Me, Sometimes The Chemistry Don't Ignite
There Ain't No Rings, No Mortgage, There Ain't Any Complications
It's Just A Hyphenated Word, Get It Out, I'm Sure I'll Be Alright

[Repeat Chorus]

It Ain't No Big Deal, It Ain't No Great Loss
You And I Are On The Same Train Of Thought
So You Don't Have To Tell Me Where To Get Off
Maybe I Misunderstood You, If You're Leaving, Baby Would You

[Repeat Chorus]

So If You're Gonna Say Goodbye, Don't Take All Day And Night
Let 'Er Rip, Let It Fly
