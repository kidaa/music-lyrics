Walk softly on this heart of mine, love
Don't treat it mean and so unkind
Let it rest in peace and quiet, love
Walk softly on this heart of mine

You say you're sorry once again, dear
You want me to take you back once more
You say you need a helping hand, dear
That's what you told me once before

Walk softly on this heart of mine, love
Don't treat it mean and so unkind
Let it rest in peace and quiet, love
Walk softly on this heart of mine

I know you soon will find a new love
I feel your heart is turned to stone
Please let me down real easy
Loneliness moves in as you move on

Walk softly on this heart of mine, love
Don't treat it mean and so unkind
Let it rest in peace and quiet, love
Walk softly on this heart of mine

Walk softly on this heart of mine
