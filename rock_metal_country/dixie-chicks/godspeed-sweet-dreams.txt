Dragon tales and the "water is wide" 
Pirate's sail and lost boys fly 
Fish bite moonbeams every night
And I love you

Godspeed, little man 
Sweet dreams, little man 
Oh my love will fly to you each night on angels wings 
Godspeed
Sweet dreams

The rocket racer's all tuckered out
Superman's in pajamas on the couch
Goodnight moon, we'll find the mouse 
And I love you

Godspeed, little man
Sweet dreams, little man
Oh my love will fly to you each night on angels wings
Godspeed
Sweet dreams

God bless mommy and match box cars
God bless dad and thanks for the stars
God heard "Amen," wherever you are
And I love you

Godspeed, little man 
Sweet dreams, little man 
Oh my love will fly to you each night on angels wings
Godspeed
Godspeed
Godspeed
Sweet dreams
