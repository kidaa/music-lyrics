Some people think I'm crazy
But try to understand
I get satisfaction
Out of everything I can
The losers and the winners
The laughter and the tears
The noises of the day to day
Is music to my ears
And I like it
Yeah I like it, whooa

Gonna live it up this time
And dance like the song is never ending
Gonna get so high tonight
You won't be able to bring me down
Cause I like it
Yeah, I like it

Driving down the highway
The wind is in my hair
And if I hit a traffic jam
I swear that I won't care
Living the lows
Makes the highs that much higher
And the sun will shine through
The smoke and fire of love
Whooa, love
Whooa

Gonna ride this merry-go-round
And dance like the night is never ending
Gonna get so high on life
You won't be able to bring me down
Cause I like it
Yeah, I like it
Oh, baby, I like it
Whooa, I like it

A sea couldn't wash away
The happiness I've come to find since love
Has taught me how to break
Break these chains that hold me back

Noisy streets and the sleepy bars
And the neon signs and the rusty cars
How many nights have I wondered how
One goes through life without seeing the beauty of love
Whooa, the beauty of love
Whooa

Gonna live it up in this town
And dance like the song is never ending
Gonna get so high tonight
You won't be able to bring me down

And I like it
Yeah, I like it
Whooa, baby, I like it
Oh, yeah, I like it

That's the beauty of life
