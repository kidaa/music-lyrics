[CHORUS:]
Hey Dixie
I can hear you calling
Hey Dixie
I can hear you calling me
Hey Dixie 
I can hear you 
I can hear you calling
Hey Dixie 
I can hear you calling me

L.A. New York bound
Sure does bring me down
Seems like something's talking to me
Saying you've been here too long
Singing that same ol song 
Got to get it on
Down in Dixie

[CHORUS]

Music in the streets 
Flowers smelling sweet
Something I can get so close to
Yeah, the sunshine is shining bright
Something something in the night
Singing songs
Down in Dixie

[CHORUS]

[INSTRUMENTAL]

Good times waiting there
Honeysuckles in the air
Love is free down by the river
That Texas moon filled sky
Ya know it's gonna make me high
Got to get it on 
Down in Dixie

[CHORUS]
