Well I Told You Pretty Baby
Such A Long Time Ago
If I Found You With Another
Well, I'd Walk Right Out Your Door
Woh, You Might Call Me Crazy
There's One Thing You Should Know
Well, If You Want Me To Love You, Got To
Give It Up Or Let Me Go

I Know It's Useless To Be Jealous
I Wouldn't Tie You If I Tried
When I Think You're Messin' Around My Back
It Sure Brings A Pain I Just Can't Hide
Oh Baby, I've Been True To You
And If I Can Make That Sacrifice
Honey You Can Do It Too

Well, You Come Home Drunk And Nasty
You Won't Tell Me Where You've Been
Just When Things Are Nice And Sweet
You're Going Back Out Again
Why Do You Want To Mess Up A Good Thing
I'm Gonna Find Me Another Man
One Who Wants To Give Me Everything

Well I Told You Pretty Baby
Such A Long Time Ago
If I Found You With Another
Well, I'd Walk Right Out The Door
Woh, You Might Call Me Crazy
There's One Thing You Should Know
Well, If You Want Me To Love You, Got To
Give It Up Or Let Me Go

Give It Up Or Let Me Go
