I Should Go Out Tonight
Get On With My Life
Break These Chains Of Solitude
With A Little Luck And A Little Help
I Might Even Find Myself
In The Arms Of Someone New

[Chorus:]
Once You've Loved Somebody
It Ain't That Easy To Do
Once You've Loved Somebody
Like I Loved You

Look What You've Gone And Done
You've Ruined Everything For Everyone
Who Tries To Steal This Heart Away
I Can't Get You Off Of My Mind
I've Tried To Tell Myself A Million Times
A Little Time Is All It Takes

[Repeat Chorus]

I Gave You Everything That I Had To Give
I Don't Know If I Can Go That Far Again

[Repeat Chorus]
