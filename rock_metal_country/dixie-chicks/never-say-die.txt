Lyin' Next To You In The Dark
I Can Feel Your Beating Heart
You've Been Here Beside Me Through The Test Of Time
We've Both Had Our Share Of Doubts
Waited Out Those Ole Storm Clouds
Boy It's Nights Like This That I Know Why
Lovers Like You And Me Will Never Say Die

[Chorus:]
'Cause There's A Long Line Of Folks Giving Up On Love
So Many Hearts Get Broken In The Push And Shove
I'll Believe In You For The Rest Of My Life
Baby Lovers Like You And Me Will Never Say Die

Tears Of Joy And Tears Of Pain
Tears Say More Than Words Explain
There's No Need For Words Here Tonight
We've Both Felt Each Others' Power
A Tender Touch In The Wee Small Hours
Is Strong Enough To Hold Us For A Lifetime
Lovers Like You And Me Will Never Say Die

[Repeat Chorus]
Oh Lovers Like You And Me Will Never Say Die
