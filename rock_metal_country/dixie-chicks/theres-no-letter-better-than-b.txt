chickens clucking Dixie Chicks

B, B, B -  B, B, B

We love to babble about a letter called B
B's the first letter we've been with
And Big Bird, Bert and Baby Bear are here with me
Cause B is what our names begin with

We love the buh sound that is made by B
And babe you better listen cause hearing is believing

There's no letter better than B
And B is the first letter in better
All we're saying is to give B's a chance
Cause baby there's no better, baby there's no better letter

B, B, B, B, B, B - B, B, B, B, B, B, B

B's for my bottle caps - and B's for my beak!
And there's a B on my sweater!
I hear that buh sound and my kness grow weak
B is such a beautiful letter
We're simply bats about the letter B
And that's another word that you can find B in

There's no letter better than B
And B is the first letter in better
All we're saying is to give B's a chance
Cause baby there's no better, baby there's no better

There's no letter better than B
And B is the first letter in better
All we are saying is to give B's a chance
Cause baby there's no better, baby there's no better letter
