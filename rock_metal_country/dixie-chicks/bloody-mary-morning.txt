from Willie   Friends album

CHICKS
Well, it's a bloody Mary morning
Baby left me without warning
Sometime in the night
So I'm flying down to Houston
Forgetting her the nature of my flight

As we taxi toward the runway
With the smog and haze reminding me
Of how I feel

WILLIE
Just a country boy who's learning
That the pitfalls of the city are extremely real

CHICKS
All the nightlife and the parties
Temptation and a seat
The order of the day

WILLIE
We'll it's a bloody Mary morning
And I'm leaving baby
Somewhere in L.A.

TOGETHER
It's a bloody Mary morning
Baby left me without warning
Sometime in the night
So I'm flying down to Houston
Forgetting her the nature of my flight

::Instrumental::

WILLIE
Now our golden jet is airborne
And flight #50 cuts a path across the morning sky

CHICKS
And a voice comes through the speaker
Reassuring us flight #50 is the way to fly

WILLIE
And a hostess takes our order
Coffee, tea, or something stronger to start off the day

TOGETHER
It's a bloody Mary morning
And I'm leaving baby somewhere in L.A.

TOGETHER
It's a bloody Mary morning
Baby left me without warning
Sometime in the night
So I'm flying down to Houston
Forgetting her the nature of my flight

So I'm flying down to Houston
Forgetting her the nature of my flight
