She's got you wrapped up in her satin and lace. 
Tied around her little finger. 
She's got you thinkin' you can never escape. 
Don't you know your heart's in danger. 
There's a devil in that angel face. 
If you could only see the love that you're wastin' 

I can love you better that that. 
I know how to make you forget her. 
All I'm askin' is for one little chance. 
Cause baby I can love you, baby I can love you better 

I'm gonna break this spell she's got on you. 
You're gonna wake up to find. 
You're my desire my intentions are true 
Hey babe I know it's time. 
You're gonna see what you mean to me. 
So open up your eyes cause seein' is believin'. 

[Chorus:]
I can love you better than that. 
I can love you better. 
All I'm askin' is for one little chance. 
Cause baby I can love you, baby I can love you.
