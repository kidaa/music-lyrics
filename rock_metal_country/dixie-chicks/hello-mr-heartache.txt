Hello Mr. Heartache, I've been expecting you
Come in and wear your welcome out
The way you always do
You never say if you're here to stay
Or only passin' through
So hello Mr. Heartache,
I've been expecting you

When I don't feel like company
You make yourself at home
Even though you know
I'd rather be alone
Love walked out on me
And didn't even close the door
Next thing I know I'm starin'
At your shadow on the floor

So, hello Mr. Heartache,
I've been expecting you
Come in and
wear your welcome out
The way you always do
You never say if you're here to stay
Or only passin' through
So hello Mr. Heartache,
I've been expecting you

I wish I could say it's nice
To see you back again
We're not exactly strangers
But we're not exactly friends
You know you're not invited but
You keep on comin' round
The last thing that I need is you
To kick me when I'm down

So, hello Mr. Heartache,
I've been expecting you
Come in and
wear your welcome out
The way you always do
You never say if you're here to stay
Or only passin' through
So hello Mr. Heartache,
I've been expecting you

I've been expecting you
I've been expecting you
I've been expecting you
