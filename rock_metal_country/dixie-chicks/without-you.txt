I've sure enjoyed the rain
but I'm looking forward to the sun
You have to feel the pain
when you lose the love you gave someone
I thought by now the time
would take away these lonely tears
I hope you're doing fine all alone,
but where do I go from here 'cause

Without you I'm not okay
And without you
I've lost my way
My heart's stuck
in second place ooh
Without you

Well I never thought I'd be
lying here without you by my side
It seems unreal to me that
the life you promised was a lie
You made it look so easy
making love into memories
I guess you got what you wanted
but what about me 'cause

Without you I'm not okay
And without you
I've lost my way
My heart's stuck
in second place ooh
Without you

Somebody tell my head to try to tell my heart
That I'm better off without you
'Cause baby I can't live

Without you I'm not okay
And without you
I've lost my way
My heart's stuck
in second place ooh
Without you...Without you
