I need love, love to ease my mind
I need to find, find someone to call mine

But mama said you can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
I can't hurry love, no, you'll just have to wait
Just trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes

How many heartaches must I stand
Before I find the love to let me live again
Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on
When I feel my strength, yeah it's almost gone

I remember mama said
You can't hurry love
No you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
How long must I wait, how much more must I take
Before lonliness, will cause my heart, heart to break

No, I cant bear to lve my life alone
I grow impatient for a love to call my own
But when I feel that I, I can't go on
These precious words keep me hangin' on

I remember mama sayin' you can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
I can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes, gotta wait!

No love, love don't come easy
But I keep on waiting
Anticipating for that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms to hold me tight
I keep waiting, I keep on waiting
But it ain't easy it ain't easy
No, you know it ain't easy

When mama said
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said, trust give it time, no matter how long it takes
She said love don't come easy it's a game of give and take
