I wished I was smarter
I wished I was stronger 
I wished I loved Jesus 
The way my wife does 
I wish it had been easier 
Instead of any longer 
I wished I could have stood where you would have been proud 
But that won't happen now 
That won't happen now

There's a whole lot of singing that's never gonna be heard 
Disappearing everyday without so much as a word somehow 
Think I broke the wings off that little song bird 
She's never gonna fly to the top of the world right now 
Top of the world

I don't have to answer any of these questions 
Don't have no God to teach me no lessons 
I come home in the eveing 
Sit in my chair 
One night they called me for supper 
But I never got up 
I stayed right there in my chair

There's a whole lot of singing that's never gonna be heard 
Disappearing everyday without so much as a word somehow 
Think I broke the wings off that little song bird 
She's never gonna fly to the top of the world right now 
Top of the world

I wished I'd a known you 
Wished I'd a shown you 
All of the things I was on the inside 
I'd pretend to be sleeping 
When you come in in the morning 
To whisper good-bye 
Go to work in the rain 
I don't know why 
Don't know why

'Cause everone's singing 
We just wanna be heard 
Disappearing everyday without so much as a word somehow 
Wanna grab a hold of that little song bird 
Take her for a ride to the top of the world right now

To the top of the world 
To the top of the world 
To the top of the world 
To the top of the world 
To the top of the world 
To the top of the world 
To the top of the world 
To the top of the world
