I saw my children from up in the sky
Bleeding and sentenced to die
Devastation and Termination
I've been your angel of death
Watching unmoved
I've been awaiting your final breath
Children forgive me
For I've been so wrong
Fate took revenge
On all I have done
I've been to Hell
I've seen the fires burning
Oh, I saw Hell
Demons I heard you calling
So many years I've been out there alone
Broken and scared to the bone
Out in the dark
Sorrow and grief possessed my heart
Out of control
In this deadly machine
Innocent victims
Are haunting my dreams
I've been to Hell...
Rage
Agony
Endless pain
I'll never be the same
Solo: Piet
Castaway
Today
Light years away from home
Blood on my hands
I must redeem
I will repent
No more repoungance between the machine
And my tortured mind
Together we're strong - now we are one
One of a kind
I've been to Hell...
To Hell I have been to pay for my sin
But no more I'll burn - I shall return
Demons of darkness
You've been calling me
But I'm clear in my mind now
And I'm on my way and I am free
