Another vision of Earth's futury. The battle against the machinehas been lost. In the orbit thrones the Iron Savior, unreachable for the survivers of mankind who barly exist in the afterworld of an atomic war
The war is over our life is not the same
Atomic fallout and clouds of acid rains
Above the world in a fortress made of splendid steel
you are the artificial knight ypu don't care
about what we think or feel
Be the guardian to guide us
Be the savior to save...
We're the
Children of the Wasteland
Sadness in our eyes
Children of the Wasteland
Frustrated hearts cold as ice
We cannot life we cannot die
in the land of the damned
holy keeper of law and order
let us life or let us end
Be the leader to lead us
Be the savior to save...
We're the
Children of the Wasteland
Sadness in our eyes
Children of the Wasteland
Frustrated hearts cold as ice
Solo Piet
Splo Kai
Be the leader to lead us
Be the savior to save...
We're the
Children of the Wasteland
Sadness in our eyes
Children of the Wasteland
Frustrated hearts cold as ice
