Music and Lyrics by P. Sielck
The sleeper is trying to get in contact with the bio-unit of the savior. They are the last ancient Atlantian beings which makes them brothers of the past.
Devastotion - radiation - paralyzing fear
Terrorizing demons rising - termination's here
Stratospheric - energetic - drifting on the stream
Agonizing isolation inside the machine
Reborn in chaos and war
What has it all been good for
Reach out and take my hand
The children must life, the killing must end
Brother - you must awake
Brother - before it's too late
Here we stand
Like shadows of great things in the past
Hear my call, oh brother
Let's right the wrongs at last
Lifeless bloodhound - executor of our fatal law
Blinded by your wrong conclusion truch you see no more
Now the defender attacks
The land he was supposed to protect
This is our legacy
Together we're facing our destiny
Brother - you must awake
Brother - before it's too late
Here we stand
Like shadows of great things in the past
Hear my call, oh brother
Let's right the wrongs at last
Solo: Piet/Kai/Piet/Kai/both
Reach out and take my hand
The children must life, the killing must end
This is our legacy
Together we're facing our destiny
Brother - you must awake
Brother - before it's too late
Here we stand
Like shadows of great things in the past
Hear my call, oh brother
Let's right the wrongs at last
We are brothers of the past
Uhh, let's right the wrongs as last
