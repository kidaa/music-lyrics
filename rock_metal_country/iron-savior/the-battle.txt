Music and Lyrics by P. Sielck
The Calederans have made contact with man. Together there c'are facing the moment of truth as the final battle against the machine from the past is about to begin...
Reflections of light paint the horizon
Silver and weak he is glowing
Beauty arises in front of my eyes
Were are we going
My heart wants to weep
The word is goodbye
Will I return
Oh, will I see it again
Will I live - will I die
The land has been bleeding in war
Nothing will be like it has been before
A moment in silence in the dawn
Facing the upcoming storm
So let the battle - let the battle begin
Armies are marching against us tonight
In unit we stand to fight
A shiver is send down my spine
As we await the finalattack
Wings launch, weapons load
Cold sweat runs down the back of my neck
We'll break through the gate
The sky we'll invade
The tyrant will burn and the world it will turn
Tonight is the night
Darkness or light
Freedom will be our guide
So let the battle - let the battle begin
The blade of reprisal is ready to strike
In unit we stand to fight - to fight
Solo 1+2: Piet/solo 3: Kai
So let the battle - let the battle begin
Armies are marching against us tonight
In unit we stand to fight
So let the battle - let the battle begin
The blade of reprisal is ready to strike
In unit we stand to fight
Solo 4: Uwe Lulis
