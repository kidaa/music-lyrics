Words & Music by Sielck
Out in the void of the vast
Throughout the torrents of time
Millenniums I had to outlast
Alone in this heart of mine
Built and designed to obey
To keep man alive
Oh, I have failed
Now they struggle to survive
Forever free
Free from the split in my mind
Now I can see
My eyes have been blind
The way of the ways - the line of the lines
My destiny once and for all
Oh Atlantis, I hear your call
I am the one - you are the ones
I will protect you - my brothers and sons
I have returned - to fight this battle
I am the savior - my heart is made
Made of metal
A shadow from somewhere beyond
Is reaching out its claw
Twisting the rays of the sun
My children you ain't gonna fall
I'll raise my blade
The time for reprisal is here
It's not too late
The savior is here
The ancient machine - a million lifes' dream
Protect and serve you all
Oh Atlantis, I hear your call
I am the one - you are the ones...
Solo: Piet
Forever free...
I am the one - you are the ones...
