Music and Lyrics by P. Sielck
It is the year 2110
The world is threatened by war once again.
The unknown vessel sent out armed
forces appearing to be
machines to invabe earth
The air and almost the entire surface is
now ander their control.
Research on the origin of the ship indicates
that is might be related to the lost
continent of Atlantis.
So the answers are given in the past,
somewhere in the infinity of space and time.
