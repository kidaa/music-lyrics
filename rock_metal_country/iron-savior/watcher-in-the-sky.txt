Music and Lyrics by Sielck/Hansen
The bio-unit is drifting on the edge of madness unable
to take action nor to get in control of the Savior-device
Kai
I'm watching the mountains
I'm watching the sea
observing the creatures
I am lost - set me free!
Across the heavens I made my way
I've seen empires rise and blown away
I have arrived my destiny
but after all there's just emptiness in me
Our in the darkness - I am going mad
Where are the others - there's silence in my head
Cause I'm watcher in the sky
I've seen universes die
Out in the cold my systems overload
I'm here and lost in time
Watcher in the sky - sky
I am trapped in this nightmare
endless tortures and pain
milliniums have gone by
Uhhh, it drives me insane!
Who am I now?
I'm not a man - I'm not machine
I gave my life for it for the Iron Savior dream
Cause I'm watcher in the sky
I've seen universes die
Out in the cold my systems overload
I'm here and lost in time
Watcher in the sky - sky
Solo Kai
Piet
Hooked - hooked to the circuits
of a lifeless, cold machine
Lost in a world of artificial means
Ripped - ripped out of my body
I'll stand the test of time
Am I perpetual - Am I divine?
Solo Piet/Solo Kai
I'm the watcher in the sky
My soul has drowned
in the tears I cannot cry
I'm the watcher the choosen one
bit I am lost in time
I'm the watcher in the sky
I've seen the years gone by
I am the choosen one
out in the cold my systems overload
I am here and lost in time
Watcher in the sky - sky
watching the mountains
watching the sea
watching the creatures
You never be free
Watcher in the sky - sky
