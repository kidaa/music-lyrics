Infuriated - electrified
Grim and relentless they ride
Fighters are launching
Onto the stars versing the shadows
Armed and ready to strike
Starwings engaging
The battle is raging
Fires in the sky
Prepared to die - no time to sigh
Thunder roars
Ready to course with no remorse
Firing the guns - explode and reload
Firing the guns - relentless and cold
Time to strike back
Under attack
They're thrusting their way
Throughout the rows
Again man's in the throws
The throws of war
We've seen it before
The world's under fire
The flames burning higher
The Dark must not come to the throne
Man will fight
With all its might
Dragons of light
Infernal ride - defeat the night
Starwings engage
Ready to course with no remorse
Firing the guns...
Fighting in this dreadful war? what is it all good for
In the battle against the Black - there ain't no turning back
I am a warrior, still I'm strong
I'll raise my blade to carry on - carry on
Solo: Kai
Fires in the sky...
Firing the guns...
