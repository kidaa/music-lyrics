Music and Lyrics by Sielck
The forces of resistance hide in the underground and attempt to awake the bio-unit. It is their desperate hope, that it will stop the Iron Savior and give mankind peace and freedom again
Hansi
We're the defenders, we are the ones
Bleeding
For all the creatures, the land and the seas
give us peace
And with the courage born in despair
Hopeless
we will resist your banners of pain
break the chain
Piet
Holy machine - creator of sorrows
Awake - wake from your dream and redem
Rise from the ocean of darkness
where you've been so long
Cosmic insanity
regain your clarity
For the freedom
and for the world
Hope is our guiding light
it will shine
united we stand to fight
for the freedom
and for the world
For all - and for the world
Hansi
Sacred messiah, prophet in arms
Liar
blasphemious saint lost in the dark
Brave at heart
Piet
We will oppose, stand up against you
Return - and let your soul take control
Come back to life
drive the demons of madness away
Cosmic insanity
regain your clarity
For the freedom
and for the world
Hope is our guiding light
it will shine
united we stand to fight
for the freedom
and for the world
For all - and for the world
Solo Kai/Piet/Kai/Piet
We will oppose, stand up against you
Return - and let your soul take control
Come back to life
drive the demons of madness away
Cosmic insanity
regain your clarity
For the freedom
and for the world
Hope is our guiding light
it will shine
united we stand to fight
for the freedom
and for the world
For all - and for the world
Forever we'll be
United and free
For the freedom
and for the world...
