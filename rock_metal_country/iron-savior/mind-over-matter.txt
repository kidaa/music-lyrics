Music and Lyrics by P. Sielck
During the millenniums in deep space the computer unit developed a consciousness. It actually became "alive". Since this unique from of existance is unknown to the computer the unit suffers major disorientation.
Am I alive, do I exist
Am I the goddess of justice
A body of metal, a mind made of circuits
Although I think and I'm conscious
What is my species, where is my soul
or am I dead as a rock
Is this my spirit or just a program
written on memory blocks
What is my aim
I am what can't be
A mind in a digital brain
It is the mind - mind over matter
The power has brought me to live
In lakes of doubts and oceans of my questions
I had to dive
Give me guidance - in torrents of time
Give me answers - creators of mind from the past
Mind over matter at last
So much to learn, so much to see
So many things to explore
Too little I know, am I a being or just a failure at all
Please heal my pain
The silence of ungiven answers will drive me insane
It is the mind - mind over matter
The power has brought me to live
In lakes of doubts and oceans of my questions
I had to dive
Give me guidance - in torrents of time
Give me answers - creators of mind from the past
Mind over matter at last
Conscious or dead - beginning or end
Mind of circuits - heal the pain
Going insane - lakes of doubts
Torrents of time - oceans questions
Creators of mind
Answers I need guidance I want
Conscious or dead - beginning or end
Solo: Piet
It is the mind - mind over matter
The power has brought me to live
In lakes of doubts and oceans of my questions
I had to dive
Give me guidance - in torrents of time
Give me answers - creators of mind from the past
Mind over matter at last
