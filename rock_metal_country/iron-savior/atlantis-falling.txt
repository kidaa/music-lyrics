Music and Lyrics by Sielck
Empires and entire civilizations may die, but life itself cannot be eliminated. It will find a way to rise again and again
A flash of destruction
like a blaze cut through the night
The heavens on fire
they were glowing in unholy light
Your sudden assult
broke all the dreams of unification
The hunger for power 
it's the lash of civilization 
dispaired and in pain - all seems so in vain
Firest in the sky
defenceless we stand tonight we will die
Shaddows of the end 
the Kingdom will fall life it will finally decent
percieve what you've done and repent
Careless we thought 
all you do is to back at the moon 
But in the grip of fury
you have conjured
the dawning of doom
is this our fate - wiped out by your hate
Firest in the sky
defenceless we stand tonight we will die
Shaddows of the end 
the Empire will fall life it will finally decent
Guddess of the seas let us rest in peace 
In her cold embrace we will find our graves
Solo Piet - Solo Kai
Silence will set in - will existance begin - again
Firest in the sky
helpless we stand defenceless we will die
Shaddows of the end 
the Kingdom will fall life will decent
Firest in the sky
helpless we stand defenceless we will die
Shaddows of the end 
Atlantic will fall life it will finally decent
decent... for evermore
