6:18
Music by Eckert/Sielck; Words by Eckert/Sielck
Jan:
I saw the shadow decline
In another world, another time
Reflecting battles full of fear
So far away from home
Death has been near
Piet:
I fought for liberty and faith
For survival of our race
The toll of blood it has been high
The dead will never see again
The sun up in the sky
Both:
I will return
Return to where I belong
Where I belong
I will be
Be with you after this war
After this war
Jan:
What I saw beyond the gate
Eternal darkness - our fate
In everlasting night
Deserted and destroyed
An empire without light
Piet:
The flame of hope kept me alive
The iron will survive
I did the things I had to do
And in my very soul
I've always been with you
Both:
I will return...
I had to leave it all behind
On my way to the other side
What to find?
I had to go
Into the unknown
Through all my fear
You have been here
Here in my heart
Solo: Piet
I will return...
Ohh, after the war
