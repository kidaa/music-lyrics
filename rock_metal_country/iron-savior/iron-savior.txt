Music and Lyrics by Sielck
The ancient machine runs an analysis and draws a fatal conclusion
Out of the cold you've been given birth
made out of steel to protect and serve
build for eternity you've indestructurable
free of emotions a robot miracle
Now you're up there above the clouds 
reading your sensores trace 
programmed to correct the errors
of the human race 
Iron Iron Savior - Godness in the sky
we can't hide from your cold, staring eye
Iron Iron Savior - Godness in the sky
deadly and dangerous you'll never die
You gave us hope the Savior machine
you were supposed to be a millions dream 
Circuits, chips and bits and bytes
detecting the failure 
result of analyses 
the human behavior
I must get control
Iron Iron Savior - Godness in the sky
we can't hide from your cold, staring eye
Iron Iron Savior - Godness in the sky
deadly and dangerous you'll never die
You gave us hope the Savior machine
you were supposed to be a millions dream 
Solo Kai
The Savior knows what's wrong or right
he made up his artificial mind 
Now mankind's fate is in his hand 
will he ever understand
Iron Iron Savior - Godness in the sky...

Iron Iron Savior - look what you have done 
cant you see your assessment might be wrong 
Iron Iron Savior - robot or the law 
and this illfated devastating
