Music and lyrics by K. Hansen
Unification all man...
Hello, is anybody out there
People can't you hear
Can't you hear my cry
Listen it's time to leave the nightmare
I'm calling out for all of you
From beyond our space and time
Rise and be free
From the darkest of dreams
And let us be forever
An eternal flame
And forevermore our union will remain
Now I see the rising evening star
Shining down on earth
Like always been before
Take my hand
This is our Promised Land
And let us be forever
An eternal flame
And forevermore our union will remain
Solo: Kai
I have no fear
And now for all of us
The and is drawing near
The power of destiny we hold in hand
The spirit of freedom that will never end
Far all eternity we hold the flame
And forevermore our union will remain
And forevermore I wish it will remain
Forevermore - Forever
