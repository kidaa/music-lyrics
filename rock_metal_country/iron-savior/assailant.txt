Music and Lyrics by Sielck
Spirit over matter. Oppression will not outlife resistance
Right out of nowhere you came
ghostlike appeared in the sky
But all our welcomes were shot down in flames
Superior power - invincible arms
a faulty assessment, a fatal misjudgement
but why you won't perceive
you won't perceive
Obeydience you claim devotion you ask
oppression is all that you give
preserving the law the law of the lost
defining the way that we life
Assailant - lash of the world
ruling a throne - of ashes and dirt
We will arise like a Phoenix
again and again - forever we'll be
Enslave us and chain us
but then you will see
in the and the spirit is free
We never did you no harm
in peace we have lived united and free
you have turned our world into debries
a heep of debries
In seems we're defenceless in anguish we suffer
the raider that came from the stars
But we won't surrender with fury we'll strike
cause this is the war of the wars
Solo Piet
Assailant - lash of the world
ruling a throne - of ashes and dirt
We will arise like a Phoenix
again and again - forever we'll be
Enslave us and chain us
but then you will see
in the and the spirit is free
