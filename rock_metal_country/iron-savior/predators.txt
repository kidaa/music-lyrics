They came to take our land and lifes
To terminate our race
All across the galaxy
They leave a deadly trace
Emerged from Hell - an evil spell
The universe is cursed
They came to please and satisfy
Their everlasting thirst
We will stand
Together til the end
Into the fire we will ride
Predators - on the hunt for prey
Predators - come to make our day
You gonna pay
We warn you now
You things up there
It's time to understand
We'll blow you into nothingness
Whatever you may send
We will stand...
Predators - on the hunt for prey...
Solo: Piesel
Onto the battlefield
Onto the firing line
We gonna blow your asses
Out of space and time
Yeah!
Predators - on the hunt for prey...
You gonna pay - some day
