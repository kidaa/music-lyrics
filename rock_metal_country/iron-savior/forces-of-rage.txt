Music and Lyrics by P. Sielck
A small cell of resistance hides from the Iron Savior under the everlasting ice of Greenland. Their ultimate goal is to free the world from the roboter's threat. The battle might be lost, but the war is not over yet...
Under the ice we hide from your stare
buried in grief and despair
We're the derbies, the scattered remains,
leaves in the storm who is lashing the world
Destiny calls, extinction of man
will it all happen again
But yet we're alive, unbroken we stand
to banish the conqueror who's taken the land
We'll be a thorn in your unhuman flesh
There'll be a time for retortion
We'll break the fetters, we'll never give in
although it seems our end will begin
Forces united - forces arise
Legions of Iron descent from the skies
Dark knight - you'll never defeat
The immortal spirit of freedom
Savior - watch out beware
We will engage
The forces of rage
Starbirds are gilding on winds of decay
merciless hunting the pray
Infernal machine, the hatchet of war
sharp as a razor will cut back the claw
We'll be the virus - deadly disease
the fever is burning inside you
To bring you to fall is the ultimate aira +
We'll rise from the ashes again and again
Forces united - forces arise
Legions of Iron descent from the skies
Free - at least for a moment in time
Years - how many years have gone by
In fury and wrath we're looking above
Forging the sword, the blade of repnsal +
Leaders of man let's ride out again
From fire and ice a blazing star will arise
Solo Piet
We'll be a thorn in your unhuman flesh
Forces united - forces arise
