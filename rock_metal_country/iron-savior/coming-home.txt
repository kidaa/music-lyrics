Music and Lyrics by P. Sielck
The Caldarins - heirs of Atlantis - sent out a huge fleet to investigate on the Iron Savior's transmission. Finally they are entering the Solar system. But will they understand the fatal error of the ancient machine...
Lost in the dark millenniums ago
Where is the place,
Where's the place called home
On fire they rode to flee from all
Their future was doomed
They've foreseen it all
Mythical world of the ancient empire
Secret and hidden but someday we shall return
Ancient calls from somewhere in time,
We have to follow the sign.
Distant voices, sources unknown
Where to they'll lead us
Where will we go?
On the scent for the lost
Coming home
Riff Solo Piet
Chasing a shadow in stardustand haze
Where will we find traces of out race
The engines are roaring, we're leaving
ground once more
Is it for real, will we fall
like so often before
Ancient calls from somewhere in time,
Main Solo: Piet/Kai/Piet/Kai/both
Mythical world of the ancient empire
Is it for real, will we fall
like so often before
Ancient calls from somewhere in time,
Star of the old
Guide us, give us hope
