Music and Lyrics by K. Hansen
The sleeper outlasted 300.000 years in stasis sleep. Now, when the savior has returned, he must awake fulfill his destiny
Kai
Welcome back home,
it's been so lomg, we've missed you,
been searching for honor and glory
out in the dark I have fought for survival
as thunder and gunfire were roaring
Back home, the time and the place of my own
my future is calling I know
I do believe there is on other place I can go
I must return from my deadly sleep
the only chance I've been given - my destiny
take me home, take me home
Back as a hole is the soil I was walking
as black as the troops were before me
relentless attack as my eyes started bleeding,
get razed to the ground by the soaring
It's time, you better be leading me home
out future is calling I know
I am the answer to all the remaining unknown
I must return from my deadly sleep
the only chance I've been given - my destiny
take me home
Solo Kai
Piet
Roaring, embracing the thunder
Twisting and turning around
Locked in I will not go under
Save me before I will drown
Solo 2: Kai
I must return
Take me home - take me home
Take me home - take me home
Take me home - take me home
Let me go - let me go
Back to my home, back to the people I know
Out in the cold but where can I go I don't know
Where can I go I don't know
Come and and take me home
