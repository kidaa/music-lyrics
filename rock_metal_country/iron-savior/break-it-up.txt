Music and Lyrics by Sielck
For a friend
Kie
Out of money and out on the streets
this wasn't yout dream
thought you'd make it high to the top 
but stumbled inbetween
wanted to catch a piece of the action 
you couldn't resist
bought a ticket to another dimension 
where troubles don't exist
Unleashing the creature that rules your mind
it this you like thunder draging you ander 
can't you see you're losing controll
Piet
Dangerous joys - shot right through the brain 
gonna crack you up drive you insane
Dangerous joys - running through your veins
gonna wrack you up please break in up
Break in up 
Kai
Flying high on borrowid illusions
you're plaing with fire 
Being dominated
by obsessing desire 
Piet
The fever is rising it's like a disease 
can't you see you're down on your knees
Kai + Piet
Dangerous joys - shot right through the brain 
gonna crack you up drive you insane
Dangerous joys - running through your veins
gonna wrack you up please break in up
Break in up 

Solo Piet
Dangerous joys - shot right through the brain 
gonna crack you up drive you insane
Dangerous joys - running through your veins
gonna wrack you up please break in up
Break in up
