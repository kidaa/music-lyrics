When I look at tomorrow
Who will I be
What will I find
Seems I'm drowning in sorrow
Everything changes
My life's redefined
When I look at tomorrow
Where will I go
What will I see
Seems I'm stuck in this hollow
Stuck in this heep, this heep of debries
Ohh, there's a pain
Deep down inside of me
Ohh, I don't know
What is my destiny
I've been the Dragon and once I've been strong
Look at me what I've become
Now I see
A Dragon again I must be
I must regain what I've lost long ago
The fires inside me still glow
To the skies
The Dragon again will arise
When I look at tomorrow
I will find
My own peace of mind
I shall leave all my sorrow
The road to myself I will follow
I'm on my way
To meet my destiny
I shall overcome
The pain deep inside of me
I've been the Dragon...
Solo: Piet
I killed the demons
They haunt me no more
I'm loaded and charged to the core
Unholy poison was
Depraiving my soul
Now I am back in control
Dragon arise!
Solo: Piet
I'm on my way...
I've been the Dragon...
