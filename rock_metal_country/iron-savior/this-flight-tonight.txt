Nazareth
Music and Lyrics by Mitchel
Look out the left, the captain said
The lights down there
that's where you'll land
Saw a falling star burnin
high above the Las Vegas sand
It wasn't the one that you gave to me
That night down south between the trailer
Not the early one
that you wish upon
Not the northern one
that guides in the sailors
You've got that touch so gentle and sweet
but you've got that look so critical
Can't talk to you babe
you know I get so weak
Sometimes I think that
love is just mythical
Up there's a heaven - down there's a town
Blackness everywhere and little lights shine
Blackness - blackness dragging me down
come on light a candle in this heart of mine
Starbright, starbright
You've got the loving that I like
Turn this crazy bird around
should not have got on
this fight tonight
Solo Piet
I'm drinking sweet champagne
got the headphones up high
can't numb you - can't drum you
out of my mind
They're singing
"Goodbye baby, baby bye bye
Uhh, love is blind!"
Up go the flaps - down go the wheels
hope you got your heat turned on baby
hope they finaly fixed your atomobile
hope it's batter
when we meet again baby
Starbright, starbright
You've got the loving that I like
Turn this crazy bird around
should not have got on
this fight tonight
