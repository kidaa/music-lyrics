Words & Music by Sielck
Thrown into a world
Where night is ruling day
Where nothing will remain
Existence will decay
The hope of despair
Deep inside our heart
Brought us to the lair
The center of the Dark
Strange and unknown hemisphere
A mission to fulfill
Evil will await us there
We're prepared to kill
Deep inside the emptiness
What to come, to find
Right into the black abyss
Leaving all behind
The stars are black beyond the gate
A wasteland
We must destroy it
For man's sake
Once in a while
I fade into a dream
Skies of blue
And meadows of green
Lost in the void
Vanished from our entity
Lost in the void
Cursed to remain in infinity
Out into unknown
A road of no return
To find the Shadow's throne
The Dark ones have to burn
Bold and brave we made our way
In eternal night
We won't let us led astray
We shall return to the light
The stars are black beyond the gate...
Once in a while...
Lost in the void...
Solo: Kai - Piet
Strange and unknown hemisphere
Our mission is fulfilled
Evil has been waiting there
Ohh, and we have killed
Deep inside the emptiness
The gate we had to find
Out of the black abyss
Leaving all behind
Back from the void
Back into our entity
Back from the void
Shadow remain in infinity
Leaving all behind
Back into the light
