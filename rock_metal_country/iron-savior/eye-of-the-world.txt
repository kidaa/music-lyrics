Words & Music by Sielck
Travelling the stars out in the cold
Out on the quest for the old
You had to leave
So don't come to grief
You couldn't see what is right or wrong
Atlantis seemed to be gone
So you attacked
The ones to protect
Out of control
You've been pounding the world
Seems now the tables have turned
Eye of the world - of the world
Back to defend
Your ancient land
Eye of the world
Back from the past
Back to save us at last
Guarding or star, giving us hope
For man you will cope
Now you can see
Who is the enemy
From the abyss
It's the savior's return
Seems now the tables will turn
Eye of the world...
Solo: Piet - Kai - Piet - Kai
Mighty machine
Set us free from the night
Be our guiding light
There is a star
Rising up in the sky
We hold your banner high
From the abyss...
Eye of the world...
Eye of the world
Save us
The tables will turn
Eye of the world
Save us
The shadow will burn
Eye of the world
