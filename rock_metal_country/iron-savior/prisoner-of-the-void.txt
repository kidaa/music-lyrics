Music and Lyrics by P. Sielck
The bio-unit is about to return to the reality of life.For far too long it has been wandering through a world of dream, illusions and madness. It wants to return from his prison in the void...
Have I returned from the dead
a lightning was striking my head
Clarity's filling my mind
I am refined
Unlock the gate to reality
Leaving the maze to be free
Tangled in a realm of fantasy and dreams
Blinded by delusion and pain
I must escape - break the chain
Countless years of existence in the cold
Now I'm at the mercy of the one I've once controlled
From far beyond the ending of all time
I saw the light saving me from the night
Eternal slave your master has returned
Obey and release me
The prisoner of the viod
Uhh, I've been traveling the darkest dimension
A disembodied soul
In damnation
But then I found sanctuary
Peaceful rest in my own entity
Now I realize
We have reached the final shore
Oh, I can't allow him
To destroy it anymore
From far beyond
Demons of time I have felt your embrace
Out in the vastness now I know your face
Oh I gave into the power of thought
Now I must use it to leave my
Sepulchral vault
Solo: Piet/both/Kai
From far beyond the ending of all time
I saw the light saving me from the night
Eternal slave
Your master has returned
Obey and release me
Hear my command
From far beyond the ending of all time
I have been seeing the light
Eternal gods
Hear my entreaty and free me
Release me from the viod
