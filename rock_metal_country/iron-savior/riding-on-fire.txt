Music and Lyrics by Sielck
Before Atlantis died a small group of fugitives escaped the upcoming catastrophy in the hope to find a better life out in space
Dream the dream of a distant place 
sheltered and hidden from the human race
Long ago leaving everything behind 
out in the coldness to find peace of mind
Leaving ground destination is unknown 
into the darkness and far away from home 
Will you dream come true and what will you find
when fate is you guide 
Riding on fire - touching the sky 
Riding on fire - take you up so hind 
Riding on fire - with tears in your eyes 
Riding on fire - and your heart it dies 
Holy wars and tyrannies
Death and destruction but no one can see
Sanctuary in a ship made out of steel
This deadly wounded world will not heal
Up to the stars to escape this living hell
Pain and oppression you're wishing all farewell
Will the tyrant survive 'til the day that you'll return
Let him burn
Riding on fire - touching the sky 
Riding on fire - take you up so hind 
Riding on fire - with tears in your eyes 
Riding on fire - and your heart it dies 
Solo 1 Piet
Dreams where did they go
reflections of thousand lightyears ago
Sadness and fear
seems the end is near
Up to the stars to escape this living hell
Pain and oppression you're wishing all farewell
The tyrant will die on the day that you'll return
he will burn
Riding on fire - touching the sky 
Riding on fire - take you up so hind 
Riding on fire - with tears in your eyes 
Riding on fire - and your heart it dies 
Solo 2 Piet
Riding on fire - touching the sky 
Riding on fire - take you up so hind 
Riding on fire - with tears in your eyes 
Riding on fire - and your heart it dies
