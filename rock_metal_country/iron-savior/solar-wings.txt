Do you believe in the god with a twisted eye
Do you believe in hell and what's below
Facing the man with the blade and an evil smile
The innocence of madness seems to grow
And now you stand and stare and wonder
Can you believe in what you see
Is there a place beyond the suffering
If not for you, there's one for me
I'm high, I ride on Solar Wings
I'm riding, ohoo
I'm free, I ride on Solar Wings
'cause I'm riding... on... Solar Wings
A hundred years I'm riding on
I've seen the madness down below
A million miles I'm riding strong
My destination is unknown
I'm leaving from insanity
I don't believe in destiny
I'm waiting for my sanctuary
If not for you, there?s one for me
I'm high, I ride on Solar Wings
I'm riding, ohoo
I'm free, I ride on Solar Wings
'cause I'm riding... on... Solar Wings
Solo
This is the afterlife, it fills me with desire
I'm riding high, I ride into the fire
I'm high, I ride on Solar Wings
I'm riding, ohoo
I'm free, I ride on Solar Wings
'cause I'm riding... on... Solar Wings
