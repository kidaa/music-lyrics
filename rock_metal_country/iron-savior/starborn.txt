Music and Lyrics by P. Sielck
The fugitives of Atlantis are searching the vastness of space to find a new home.For several generations this trek of the last survivers has been on the quest. They are the starborn children of Atlantis
Bound to the stars, bound to a land
Unspoiled and virgin
This journey has to end
Out in the cold, lonely we feel
Outcast and homeless
In coffins made and steel
For beyond - so far beyond a strange horizon
History - the past is lost but we will live on
Still on the quest
Forever we're riding
No place to rest
In deep space we're gliding
Starborn children - their destiny
Starborn out in the cold - their sanctuary
Faster than light we cruise the unknown
Into the dark we've been thrown
Starborn and lost in the cold
Where can wego, where will we find
Shelter and silence
From all we've left behind
So many times we thought we had it all
But we had to follow
The stars and their call
Memories - of all we've left will fabe away
Atlantis will - be lost in war and will decay
Goddess of fate
Forever we're riding
Light up the shade
In deep space we're gilding
Starborn children - their destiny
Solo Piet
Goddess of fate
Forever we're riding
Light up the shade
In deep space we're gilding
Starborn children - their destiny
