Music and Lyrics by P. Sielck
The battle has been won and earth is free again. The Iron Savior was forced to leave the solar system, but it couldn't be destroyed. For now earth seems to be relieved from the tyrant in the sky.
Jan: A new day born
In peace and in silence
Rays of the sun
Rip through the clouds
Piet: A new age is to come
Jan: The darkness decays
The heavens are shining golden and blue enlightening the dawn
Piet: A New World will move on
So many lives
Out in the fields oh so many have died
Now we will rise
The chains that have held us are broken
and now we are
Free - from the tyrant
The conqueror's been banished
Free - and united
The throne in the sky now is
Free - free from the tyrant
Relentless we fought to be
Free - free and united
We have outlasted the war
The shadows of war
Jan: They came from the stars to search a forgotten land
Rescue they brought
With thunder they fought
Piet: The tide has turned as the appeared
So many tears
Ohh, we will always remember the years
Earth has been burned but then they returned to save us and now we are
Free - from the tyrant
The conqueror's been banished
Free - and united
The throne in the sky now is
Free - free from the tyrant
Relentless we fought to be
Free - free and united
We have outlasted the war
The shadows of war
Solo 1: Piet
Jan: No more we'll fight
Piet: Return to the light
Jan: The conqueror's been banished
Piet: The savior has vanished
Jan: The mighty machine
Piet: a million life's dream
Both: outlasted the past
Both: out in the vast
Solo 2: Piet/Solo 3: Kai
Free - from the tyrant
The conqueror's been banished
Free - and united
The throne in the sky now is
Free - free from the tyrant
Relentless we fought to be
Free - free and united
We have outlasted the war
The shadows of war
After the war
The world is unchained
Freedom we've gained
The Savior's been banished
The fortress has vanished
In peace and in silence
The world will move on
Darkness and war
No more we'll fight
We have returned - returned to the light
