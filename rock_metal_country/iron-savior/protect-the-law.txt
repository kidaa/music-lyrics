Music and Lyrics by Sielck
To uphold the law and without merce prosecute any violation in another directive of the Iron Savior
From an ancient past I will bring you the law
To protectand to serve I was made for
My creators have vanished lost in space and in time
I'm the savior device now their battle is mine
When I'm looking down on you I see
a wasted land
and the reason is humanity
I must gain control
I protect the law - now and evermore
justice I'll defend - Guardian of the land
Crime has the end
My directives are simple peace and justice for all
your resistance is futile if you fight me you'll fall
My systems are in focus, locked on you
you cannot hide, I trace everything you do
surrender and repent
I protect the law - now and evermore
justice I'll defend - Guardian of the land
Crime has the end
Solo kai
When I'm looking down on you I see...
I protect the law - now and evermore
justice I'll defend - Guardian of the land
Crime has the end
