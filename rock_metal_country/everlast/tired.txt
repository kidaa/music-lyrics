Make you go 
Soul for soul 
Over mic control 
Kid you can't touch me with a ten foot pole 
And I even made the devil sell me his jewels 
He was out to cold mock me 
And play you for fools 
Kid, you know the rules 
Must be smokin' super cools 
Try to diss me on the low 
Got to be a psycho 
That's aight though 
You know you won't see me shakin' 
I'm out to blow the spot 
On who's real and who's fakin' 
Who's givin' 
Who's takin' 
Who's livin' 
Who's starvin' 
Diss me on the mic 
It's time for headstone carvin' 
And every tap writin'll strike ya like lightin' 
Dissolve ya like powder 
So turn it up louder 
Go on pump the wattage 
Get the cheese by cottage 
I like mean streaks 
I like Spanish freaks 
I like Korean barbecue 
I'm like old school beats 
'Cause... 

CHORUS 
I'm sick of all the shit that's droppin' 
And I'm tired of all the lip that's poppin' 
And all the wack attitudes people coppin' 
I'm only tryin' to get a few heads boppin' X2 

It go bang bang boogie 
I'm sick like a loogie 
I'm wiser than bud 
I'm thicker than blood 
I'm older than time 
Molded from divine 
How can you be so bold to think that you'll take mine 
I'm cash like Johnny 
It's the highway man 
And I'm walkin' this line the best way I can 
With my farmer's tan 
And my bloodshot eyes 
I ain't bodied no one 
I ain't chopped no pies 
With the butters from the gutters 
I'm about to explode 
And blow the spot for folk nave 
Up the Gun Hill Road 
Like artillery shells 
Been from heaven to hell 
And I'm a say a little prayer for every rapper that fell 
'Cause... 

CHORUS 
I'm sick of all the shit that's droppin' 
And I'm tired of all the lip that's poppin' 
And all the wack attitudes people coppin' 
I'm only tryin' to get a few heads boppin' X2
