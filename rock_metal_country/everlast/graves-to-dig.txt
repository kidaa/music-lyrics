It goes one for the prophet 
Two for Islam, three for the hood ??? ??? 
Four for the Mother that birthed my frame 
Five for the Father 'cause it's heart began 
Been 'round the world suns all the same 
Sometime's when I'm asleep I still call your name 
Back when I was young I used to dream of fame 
Now they all point their fingers sayin' "who's to blame" 
Mother's put their girls in some pig tail curls 
Father's teach their sons how to shoot their guns 
They say, boy, don't ever ???, control your emotions 
Take it like a man and make your stand 
They say sex and violence go hand in hand 
Every man blessed they gotta be tempted 
Span through the depths of space and time 
Stand, three eyes blind on the firin' line 
Word to my man Divine, come too far 
Singin' la allaha a lala 
??? 
I was hopin' that the Lord got some mercy to spare 
It goes one for the rumor, two for the deed 
Three for the Angels, four for the Alamin 
Somewhere in between, totally obscene 
Perfectly clean, I've got a Babylon Feeling 
Wombs need healin', truth need revealin' 
Hands need washin' from all the dirty dealin' 
Floor to the ceilin', from the stage to the door 
Kings and the Queens and the slaves and their whores 
For every lost cause where the martyr's are found 
That funky little sound that make you wanna get down 
Somebody told me once that love makes the world go 'round 
And kids they carry pistols out on the playground 
That profound, gone too far, prayin' on my life to the burnt out star 
Put your lights on, put down your crosses 
It's time to tally up your wins and your losses 
It goes one for Scott LaRock and two for Pac and B.I.G 
Three for all the mothers who got graves to dig X3
