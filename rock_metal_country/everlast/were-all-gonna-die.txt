feat. Cee Lo

We all gonna die, we all gonna die
When I was a very young boy, Momma told me we're all gonna die
Momma said son love can't be trusted
It's just another weakness, we're all gonna die

[CHORUS]
Baby don't cry, praise the most high
I tell you no lie, we're all gonna die
Baby don't cry, praise the most high
I tell you no lie, we're all gonna die

Now I'm alone, seen the night livin'
Made a new friend, gonna get high
Don't take more than I'm givin'
Judgment day comin', we're all gonna die
If my wings should fail me Lord
Meet me with another pair

[CHORUS]
Baby don't cry, praise the most high
I tell you no lie, we're all gonna die
Baby don't cry, praise the most high
I tell you no lie, we're all gonna die

Baby gettin' born, old man dyin'
Young lady laughin', old women cryin'
Leavin' like a lamb comin' back like a lion
Babylon to Zion, we're all gonna die
Praise the most high, we're all gonna die

When I was a very young boy Momma told me we all gonna die
Momma said son love can't be trusted it's just another weakness
We're all gonna die, praise the most high, we're all gonna die
If my wings should fail me Lord
Meet me with another pair

[CHORUS]
Baby, don't cry, praise the most high
I tell you no lie, we're all gonna die
Baby, don't cry, praise the most high
We all gonna die, we all gonna die
Baby, don't cry, praise the most high
I tell you know lie, we're all gonna die
Baby, don't cry, praise the most high
We all gonna die, we all gonna die
