EVERLAST 
Yeah, yeah, two-thousand, zero, zero 
The party just started, ha-ha, ha-ha 
Everlast, Kurupt, goes somethin' like this 

CHORUS 
I say one, two, one-two-one-two 
The good Lord knows just what you've been through 
I say one, two, one-two-one-two 
Sometime's you're just doing what you've got to do 
I say one, two, one-two-one-two 
The good Lord knows just what you've been through 
I say one, two, one-two-one-two 
Sometime's you're just doing what you've got to do 

EVERLAST 
Sticker man tryin' to feed his baby 
Drug dealer tryin' to raise his son 
Every pimp gotta dress his lady 
Come on now you ain't the only one 

CHORUS 
I say one, two, one-two-one-two 
The good Lord knows just what you've been through 
I say one, two, one-two-one-two 
Sometime's you're just doing what you've got to do 
I say one, two, one-two-one-two 
The good Lord knows just what you've been through 
I say one, two, one-two-one-two 
Sometime's you're just doing what you've got to do 

KURUPT 
Now this is the combination of intervention 
That just might open up a new dimension 
I can tell, the well, just might run dry 
Loss some tension of thoughts, modify and simplify 

CHORUS 
I say one, two, one-two-one-two 
The good Lord knows just what you've been through 
I say one, two, one-two-one-two 
Sometime's you're just doing what you've got to do 
I say one, two, one-two-one-two 
The good Lord knows just what you've been through 
I say one, two, one-two-one-two 
Sometime's you're just doing what you've got to do 

KURUPT 
I said life, blast, present to the past 
Hard rapper the war path 
War path Kurupt young Goddie 
Incredibly clever, mack auther with Everlast it's true 
Do what you wanna do, one, two 

EVERLAST 
Mary Jane wanna run smoke reefer 
Little Ricky's out sniffin' rock 
Cynthia, she's at the disco coked out 
Doesn't matter what drugs you on 

CHORUS 
I say one, two, one-two-one-two 
The good Lord knows just what you've been through 
I say one, two, one-two-one-two 
Sometime's you're just doing what you've got to do 
I say one, two, one-two-one-two 
The good Lord knows just what you've been through 
I say one, two, one-two-one-two 
Sometime's you're just doing what you've got to do 

KURUPT 
Game, growth, life by oath 
The gifted, different with toast 
Talent, the mellowdramatic 
??? life in silence but this here's mine 
Crystal clear ??? 

CHORUS 
I say one, two, one-two-one-two 
The good Lord knows just what you've been through 
I say one, two, one-two-one-two

I say one, two, one-two-one-two 
The good Lord knows just what you've been through 
I say one, two, one-two-one-two 
Sometime's you're just doing what you've got to do
