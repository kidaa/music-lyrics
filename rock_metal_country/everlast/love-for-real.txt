feat. N'dea Davenport

Her skin was soft and sweet, she wore sandals on her feet
Side by side 'till we fell asleep in her mothers bed
She stepped inside of me, said don't ever lie to me
This heart of mine can be yours, yeah, that's what she said
But I just played the role, broke the heart I stold
Because I was young, and dumb and fucked up in the head

[CHORUS]
Do you wanna be loved for real, do you wanna be loved for real
Do you wanna be do you wanna be loved for real loved yes, I wanna be loved for real
For real do you wanna be loved for real, yes, I wanna be loved for real

Now, down by the river, takin' off my shoes jumpin' in the water
Wash away these blues, now into the ocean, the current takes over
Words already been spokin', tales already been told
Hearts already been broken, wounds already been healed
Do you wanna be loved, do you wanna be loved for real

[CHORUS X2]
Do you wanna be loved for real, do you wanna be loved for real
Do you wanna be do you wanna be loved for real loved yes I wanna be loved for real
For real do you wanna be loved for real, yes I wanna be loved for real

Her eyes were hazel brown, she laughed the sweetest sound
And I just loved the way she lit up when she spoke
She helped me ease my pain, she stayed in the pouring rain
And I gave her all that she could take 'till she broke
She fit me like a glove, she taught me how to love
And for some ass I watched it all go up in smoke

[CHORUS]
Do you wanna be loved for real, do you wanna be loved for real
Do you wanna be do you wanna be loved for real loved yes I wanna be loved for real
For real do you wanna be loved for real, yes, I wanna be loved for real
Do you wanna be loved do you wanna be loved for real, yes, I wanna be loved for real
For real do you wanna be loved for real, yes, I wanna be loved for real
Do you wanna be loved do you wanna be, do you wanna be, loved for real for real
Do you wanna be loved yes I wanna be loved for real, do you wanna be loved for real
Yes, I wanna be loved for real real, real, real...
