A trust betrayed, a rusty blade
Standin' on the air, I walked the line
Paid my fine, hope I know the land
The actual facts, unatural acts
Sins that take their toll
The Angel and the ginn and the beast within
They fight to take control

[CHORUS]
Lord, have mercy on my soul
On my soul, on my soul, on my soul

Lord needs you like a junkie needs his drug
He needs you like a baby boy needs his hug
Needs you like the power, Lord, needs the sun
I need you like DMC needs Run
Lord, have mercy on my soul, Lord, have mercy on my soul
Lord loves you like the Eskimo loves the cold
I love you like the miner man loves his gold
Love you like the fishermen loves the sea
I love you like the flowers love the work of bees

[CHORUS]
Lord, have mercy on my soul
On my soul, on my soul, on my soul

Lord, have mercy on my soul
Standin' up tall, on top of the wall
Hopin' that I can fly, Angel and the jinn and the beast within
Say I'm gonna die

[CHORUS]
Lord, have mercy on my soul
On my soul, on my soul, on my soul
