Watchin' the sunshine, peekin' over the skyline
Thinkin' I gotta get mine, gotta try at least one time
Wanna get near it, close enough to fear it
Close enough to hear it, close enough to say
That I looked it in the eye and then I turned away

[CHORUS]
And I'm not scared, but I can't move
I'm not scared, but I can't move

Hangin' out on the weeknight, lookin' off the street light
Gettin' into some fist fight, tryin' to cling to my birth right
I wanna get near her, close enough to smell her
Close enough to tell her all the things that I wanna say
That I looked her in the eye and made her run away

[CHORUS]
And I don't care don't care, but I can't move
I don't care don't care, but I can't move

Layin' up in the sofa, lookin' out of my window
Pullin' back on some endo, watchin' breeze as the wind blow
Wanna get near it, close enough to hear it
Close enough to fear it, close enough to say
That I looked it in the eye and then it turned away

[CHORUS]
And I'm not scared not scared, but I can't move
I'm not scared not scared, but I can't move
