Yeah that's her 
Sometimes you win 
Sometimes you lose 
All the broken hearts 
And the unpaid dues 
What you did to me 
What I did to you 
I ain't mad at you, boo 
So what we gonna do? 
I just seen you out with your new man 
It's lookin' kind of happy 
I'm feelin' like somebody just slapped me 
My gut's in a knot 
My temp's gettin' hot 
I wanna make that man bleed 
And wear this speed knot 
'Cause he ain't got what we had 
And it makes me kind of mad 
I hurt my one true love 
Just like my dad 
And it's kinda sad 
'Cause now my shit's together 
No need for umbrellas 
I can see the stormy weather 
I'm goin' outside into the rain 
Like Keith Sweat 
'Cause I can't house this pain 
We was workin' for years 
Now I'm jerkin' these tears 
From my lips to God's ears, girl 
I did you wrong 
So I'm makin' this song 
To let you know how I feel 
Before I'm keepin' it real 
Man, keepin my heart concealed 
And now I'm on the side 
Just patiently waitin' 
Watchin' on you and the time for updatin' 
I can't hide from the truth 
I know the puddin's in the proof 
So I stand convicted like all your friends predicted 
But I'd think you'd be surprised 
On how this ends brothers 
We went from lovers to friends 
We'll go from friends to lovers 
So if that man make you smile 
I guess that I'll 
Just accept it 
And respect it 
I'll hit you with this song 
And let you think about it 
Then I'll just leave you alone 
And be a man about it
