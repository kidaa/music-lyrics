feat. B-Real

[EVERLAST]
What, you think it can't happen
Soul Assassins, two-thousand, word
It goes somethin' like this
Ah-ha, I'm Vision-Quest, Fresh Fest era terror
Krush Groovin like a low budget movie
I'm Wild Style like Lee Quinones, stop ridin' on my cajones
I talk with a speak that's much unique
While you desperately seek for that Susie freak
Yo, word to Rob One he used to like the big ladies
My name's Everlast I started back in the 80's like
All up in your nostril, actin' hostile, 13th appostile
Going postal, holy ghost mode
While you walkin' on the host strow actin' bicoastal 
Bitch, try to play the middle, snitch, wind up in the hospital
Cat on a hot tin roof with no fiddle
Put your money in the middle get broke like coal

[CHORUS]
Two deadly assassins makin' the 
I'm Real, I'm Everlast and I'm takin' 'em all
Just when you thought it was safe to make a tape
Two deadly assassins seelin' your fate

[B-REAL]
I spit out the fire you won't know what hit
Watch me lace you up quicker than the joint gets lit
I got tears in this shit what do you got a couple
If you gotta hustle, what do you want, trouble
Jokin'  at the two who go way back like chucks  way back
With a hand on the pump by the big black trucks fools
You can't trust a soul in the City of Angels
The strange hoes want a piece look at these lame hoes 
I stained those with hot blood and changed clothes 
And main fools who wanna rock the same clothes 
And use the same flows, these son originals 
Niggas, all of a sudden if anyone wants to run up 
You get chastised and baptised and blood 
When the gat lies it don't matter, you scatter 
You run, you ungrateful most hateful leech niggas 
Swollow in your misery I'm out of reach niggas 

[CHORUS]
Two deadly assassins makin' the 
I'm Real, I'm Everlast and I'm ready to brawl
Just when you thought it was safe to make a tape
Two deadly assassins seelin' your fate

Two deadly assassins makin' the 
I'm Real, I'm Everlast and I'm takin' 'em all
Just when you thought it was safe to make a tape
Two deadly assassins seelin' your fate
