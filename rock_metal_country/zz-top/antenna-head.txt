Old 61's my number on the highway 
I'm turning up the V's on the airways 
I'm tuned into some bad-ass transactions 
It's the only way to get my satisfaction 
Yeah antenna head, yeah antenna head 
Antenna waves be burnin' up my radio 
Mister Deejay say it's the only way to go 
Cranked up all the way my tube is turning read 
Got a pocked full off cornbread just call it 
Antenna head 
Yeah antenna head 
Yeah antenna head 
Yeah yeah yeah antenna head 
Yeah antenna head
