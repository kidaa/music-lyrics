A hundred thousand dollars 
wouldn't touch the price I paid 
of the hundred thousand moments 
of the times I wish I'd stayed. 
But even if I had all the time and money, 
it's still the same old news. 
Nothin' does you any good 
when you got 2000 blues. 

Ten thousand clouds 
on a rainy rainy day 
couldn't wash away 
all the dust and the haze. 
But I tried and I tried 
to search for all the clues, 
why I can't wash away 
these 2000 blues. 

If I had an airplane 
with a co-pilot too, 
I'd fly to a planet 
that was closest to you. 
I'd set the tracking system 
with your safety fuse, 
and set the countdown 
for 2000 blues.
