When I woke up this mornin' 
had a smile run across my face. 
My baby from town just had to get down, 
come and drag me all over the place. 

Gonta drive on a flatbed trailer truck 
down on highway fifty-nine. 
I had the blues and my baby, she knew 
she's holdin' little piece of mind. 

Down brownie, 
my brownie downtown, 
down brownie. 

Got my share and I'm a black hand cottonfield 
just to try and keep myself alive. 
Eatin' red beans and rice with the rat's hole, it's nice 
or anything you wanna try. 

Now I'm hitchin' a ride back from Brownie's, 
I'm kind of sad but I feel alright. 
The cold night it stings but I got me some wings, 
I'll be flyin' into Houston tonight.
