When I woke up this morning 
I was feeling mighty good. 
My baby understood had to do what she should 
lying near a pile of wood. 
Laying it on some, 
playing with it some 
when I, I woke up with wood. 

I was lying there thinking 'bout basketball 
trying not to lose my mind 
my baby came to help and I let out a yell, 
she grabbed me from behind. 
Laying on it some, 
playing with it some 
when I, I woke up with wood. 

Beauty queens fall in trances, 
debutantes lose their furs. 
But it felt so good from where they stood, 
they were working on a pile of wood. 
Laying on it some, 
playing with it some 
when I, I woke up with wood.
