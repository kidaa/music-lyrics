Spoken: Douse that light.... 

Now I just got back from baby's, 
we been rollin' al night long. 
I saidI just got back from baby's, 
we been rollin' al night long. 
She comeon likes and loves me, 
but I feel like somethin' wrong. 

Now, sometimes I go se baby, 
and sometimes she come see me. 
I said, sometimes I go se baby, 
and sometimes baby come see me. 
I got a funny, funny feelin' 
I'm not the only man she sees. 

Now, I just got back from baby's, 
big white house on the hill. 
I said, I just got back from baby's, 
big white house on the hill. 
If her lovin' don't get me, 
I know her husband will.
