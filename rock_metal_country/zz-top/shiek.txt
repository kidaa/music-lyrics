I met a shiek from Mozambique 
who led me to the Congo. 
He dreamed to go to Mexico 
and sample a burrito. 

My tempature had risen again, 
it must have been a hundred and ten. 

Under the oaks I was telling some jokes 
and thinkin' I had it made- 
Gettin' on with the folks, havin' some Coke 
and coolin' off in the shade. 

My tempature had risen again, 
and it must have been a hundred and ten. 

I took a boat that couldn't float 
to Rio de Janeiro. 
So with my scuba I swam to Cuba 
bur I'll be gone tomorrow. 

My tempature had risen again, 
it must have been a hundred and ten.
