She used to drive a beat up pickup 
Down around San Antone 
Stealin' the heart of every guy in town 
Includin' the one I own 
But this sweet young thing of seventeen 
Would sting you with the lovesick blues 
Just a blonde haired blue eyed picture of sin 
Lookin' for someone to use 

She's a lover 'n fighter, she's a wild bull rider 
And I'm wonderin' why she left me such a long time ago 
She's a heartbreaker, she's a love taker 
She can break a heart and take all the love she needs 

Well I heard she got down in Beaumont 
And she wound up in El Paso 
She was tuff as a boot and thin as a rail 
And she could step to the cotton eyed Joe 
If you run across this flagrant fuzzy 
Slip in and get her while you can 
Cause before too long she'll be good as gone 
And runnin' with another man 

She's a lover 'n fighter, she's a wild bull rider 
And I'm wonderin' why she left me such a long time ago 
She's a heartbreaker, she's a love taker 
She can break a heart and take all the love she needs
