If you been out messin' and actin' a fool 
You best be confessin' hey, don't be cruel 
Just callin' attention you probably know 
Don't hold on to nothin', it's time to let go 
Say baby I want ya, I'm hurtin' so big 
Take out some insurance, and cover your rig 
We talkin' resurrection to shred your head 
That certain possession you keep in yo' shed 
Don't wanna confuse you, muddy up your mind 
Let nothing abouse you or come from behind 
Say baby I want ya, I'm hurtin' so big 
Take out some insurance, and cover your rig 
If there's ever a question, take care of yourself 
Use your protection, be respecting yourself 
Make no obligations, you can throw 'em to the wind 
Blind infatuations, the means to an end 
Say baby I want ya, I'm hurtin' so big 
Take out some insurance, and cover your rig
