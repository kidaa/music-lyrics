Deep in the South of Texas 
not so long ago, 
there on a crowded island 
in the Gulf of Mexico 

it didn't take too much money, 
man, but it sure was nice. 
You could dance all night if you felt all right, 
drinking whiskey and throwing dice. 

And everybody knows 
it was hard to leave. 
And everybody knows 
it was down at the Balinese. 

Yeah, I remember Ruby, 
she always dressed in red 
wearing skintight pants, Lord, and how she could dance 
with a rag wrapped around her head. 

And everybody knows 
it was hard to leave. 
And everybody knows 
it was down at the Balinese. 

And everybody knows 
it was hard to leave. 
And everybody knows 
it was down at the Balinese, 
it was down at the Balinese, 
it was down at the Balinese.
