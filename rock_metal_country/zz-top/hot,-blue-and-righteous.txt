Hot, blue and righteous, 
an angel called me aside. 
Hot, blue and righteous, 
said, 'Stick by me and I'll be your guide.' 

I heard the words as I closed my eyes 
down on my, down on my bended knees. 
It fit like a glove and I realized 
somethin' good's happenin' to me. 

Hot, blue and righteous 
angel called me aside. 
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
