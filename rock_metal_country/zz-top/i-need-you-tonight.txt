It's three o'clock in the morning 
and the rain begin to fall 
but I know what I'm needin 
but I don't have it all. 
I'm needin someone like you 
that I just wanna do love to. 
Baby, baby, I need you tonight. 

Outside my window 
it's lonely and cold. 
Inside my heart there's a fire 
burning out of control. 
Burning for someone like you 
I just wanna do love to. 
Baby, baby, I need you tonight. 

Your love's coming to me 
like a wolf howling at the moon 
but that just doesn't do me 
if I can't get you soon. 
I'm calling for someone like you 
that I just wanna do love to. 
Baby, baby, I need you tonight.
