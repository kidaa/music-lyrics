I was on my way down to Mexico, 
there was trouble on the rise. 
It was nothing more than I'd left behind, 
which was much to my surprise. 
I turned around and lit a cigarette 
wiped the dust off of my boots. 
When up ahead I saw the crowd, 
I knew it was no use. 

I'ts been the same way for Oh so long, 
it looks like I'm singing the same old song. 

A fine and fancy man was he, 
doing good things for the poor. 
Givin' rides in his rockin' Eighty-eight for free. 
They could not hope for more. 
When it came my turn he said to me, 
'Have I seen your face before' 
I said, 'Oh no, you must be wrong, 
I'm from a distant shore. 

So if you don't mind, I'll just move along 
but it looks like I'm singin' the same old song.' 

A Nineteen Forty movie star 
with a long forgotten name. 
She was a sexy mess in her pleated dress, 
still hangin' on to fame. 
With forgotten lines she missed her cue 
and left a glass of wine at home. 
She was singin' the same song that I was. 
Could we both be wrong 

So hand in hand we walked along, 
each of us singin' the same old song.
