See that girl with the red dress on, 
she can do it all night long, 
she's a bad girl, she's a bad girl. 
I know a girl that likes to flirt, 
she can do it in a mini skirt. 
She's a bad girl, she's a bad girl. 
Ain't it a shame when a girl goes bad, 
it's enough to drive you mad. 

Yesterday I was playin' it cool 
but she played me for a first class fool, 
she's a bad girl, she's a bad girl. 
I'm gonna tell you like I told some friends 
I'm goin' back to dig her again. 
She's a bad girl, she's a bad girl. 
Ain't it a shame when a girl goes bad, 
it's enough to drive you mad. 

I know a girl with a GTO, 
she's the one that go cat go, 
she's a bad girl, she's a bad girl. 
See the girl dressed in green, 
she's the one that's a mean machine, 
she's a bad girl, she's a bad girl. 
Ain't it a shame when a girl goes bad, 
it's enough to drive you mad.
