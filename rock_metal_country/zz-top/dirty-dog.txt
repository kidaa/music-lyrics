Hey baby, watcha gonna do 
now that I've left you and I said we're through. 
All along you been runnin' round 
but you ain't the only game in town. 

I dug your brush and your ass is fine, 
I dug your jelly and your mighty mind. 
But you rubbed it on another guy, 
you're history and this is why 
you're just a dog, a scurvy dog. 

Hey baby, when we got it on 
you made me feel like there ain't nothin' wrong. 
Just don't bug melike you're so naive. 
I'm crackin' up, I'm gonna take my leave. 

I dug your brush and your ass was fine, 
I dug your jelly and your mighty mind. 
But you rubbed it on another guy, 
you're history and this is why 
you're just a dog. 

Hey baby, well, it's over now, 
I'll make my exit and I take a bow. 
Your problems cured with a dollar bill 
and if it don't I know a flea collar will. 

I dug your brush and your ass was fine, 
I dug your jelly and your mighty mind. 
But you rubbed it on another guy. 
You're history and this is why 
you're just a dog, a scurvy dog. 

Hey! Get that dog out of my yard!
