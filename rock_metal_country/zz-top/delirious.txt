I went down to dock number ten 
to see what just came in. 
They seemed a little bit mysterious, 
I think I'm gonna get delirious. 
DELIRIOUS DELIRIOUS 

I got nailed in a raid last night, 
they tried to haul me off to jail. 
Things were looking kind of serious 
till everybody got delirious. 
DELIRIOUS DELIRIOUS 

I fell into a hand of cards 
and almost blew the night away. 
Things were looking kind of furious 
till everybody got delirious. 
DELIRIOUS DELIRIOUS 

I overloaded and I saw the light, 
decadence was on my mind. 
Everything was getting ridiculous 
till everybody get delirious. 
DELIRIOUS DELIRIOUS
