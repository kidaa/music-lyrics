I know you wanna be my bedroom thang, 
but you're much too young. 
You're the finest thing I've ever seen. 
You just wanna have fun. 

I need someone who can scratch my back. 
I need someone who can carry my pack. 
I need someone to be with me at night. 
You're gonna make me feel alright. 

Don't you bother me with petty lines, 
I know you ran away from home. 
This might come to you as some surprise, 
I wish you'd leave me alone. 

I need someone to scratch my back. 
I need someone to carry my pack. 
I need someone to be with me at night. 
You're gonna make me feel alright.
