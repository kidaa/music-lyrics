Ridin' top the floodway on a Friday night, 
the landscape's a fine and nat'ral sight. 
Just cruisin' slow through the dark of night. 
With Precious and Grace ev'rything's all right. 

Good God Almighty, we was goin' down slow, 
yeah, if we knew just where we had to go. 
Cryin', just a flyin' down a put out road 
with Precious and Grace in my flathead Ford. 

So if you're out rollin' late some night, 
yeah, and you need that supernatural delight, I'm talkin' to you, brother, 
I know somebody's, they's just out of sight. 
Get with Precious and Grace, they gonna treat you right.
