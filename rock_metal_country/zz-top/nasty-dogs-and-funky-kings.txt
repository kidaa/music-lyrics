Well, I knocked down on your door, baby, 
to see if you were at home. 
Your shade was down, there wasn't even a sound 
but something told me you weren't alone. 
What in the world can a nasty dog do 
but try to get next to you 

Don't laugh 'cause it ain't funny. 
Look how it happened to me. 
It could happen to you, you could be a fool too 
and it'd leave you in misery. 
I guess there's nothin' more funky king can do 
but to try to get next to you. 

Mm, well.
