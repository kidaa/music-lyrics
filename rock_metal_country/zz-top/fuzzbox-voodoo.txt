I went down with the fuzzbox 
Grinding a pound or two 
Say I'm down, with a fuzzbox 
Pounding and a workin' it through 
And because you've got fuzz 
Go on and do what you wanna do 
I down down with a fuzzbox 
Checking out what it could do 
It was step-2, blue voodoo 
Fuzzed another hour or two 
Just do it man

Now lay down on your hot spot 
Listen what I'm tellin' you 
Said leand down witchu hot spot 
Hit chu with the blue voodoo 
Just do it dude 
Everybody do 
Once it's understood
