I don't need her money, I don't need a ride. 
I got enough connections, I don't need a piece of her hide. 

I just wanna please her, 
I just wanna squeeze her. 
I just wanna crash her, 
I just wanna trash her. 
If I could only flag ner down, 
if I could only flag her down. 

Well, it's not because of her beauty and her brand new low cut blouse. 
It's not because she's so snooty or a fine famed millionaire. 

It's not 'cause she's in motion in a brand new Cadillac car, 
it's not because of her lotion, she's a real sweet candy bar. 

I just want to meet her, 
I just want to squeeze her. 
I just want to crash her, 
I just want to trash her. 
If I could only flag her down, 
if I could only flag her down.
