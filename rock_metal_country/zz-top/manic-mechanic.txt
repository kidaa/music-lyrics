You want to race 
If you insist. 
At that price, I can't resist. 
That's right, that's right, that's right. 

Tonight it ain't right, 
I got to have me a week. 
But I'll be back for you, Jack, 
and I'll let the machine speak. 
That's right, that's right, that's right. 

Showdown You bet. 
And I haven't saddled my pony yet. 
Have mercy, Miss Percy. 
I done put the coon tune on this bet. 
That's right, that's right, that's right.
