Mr. ten dollar man with that gold in your hand 
Comin' round here after sunlight 
With your peaches and your pream 
And your rollin magazine 
Tellin' me you'll make me feel alright 
You gonna make me feel alright 

Mr. ten dollar man with a girl by the hand 
Will this ten spot take her away 
With his slaver's finance he winked, 
Said take a chance 
Don't you know it happens every day 
I said it happens every day 

Mr. ten dollar man with that gun in your hand 
Could I get a case of those tonight 
And now you've got the order, it's time 
To slip the border 
Don't you know it happens every day 
I said it happens every day
