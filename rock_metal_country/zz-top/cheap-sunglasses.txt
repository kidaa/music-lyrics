When you get up in the morning and the light is hurt your head 
The first thing you do when you get up out of bed 
Is hit that street a-runnin' and try to meet the masses 
And go get yourself some cheap sunglasses 
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah 

I spot a little thing and I followed her all night 
In a funky pair of levis and her sweater's kind of tight 
She had a west coast strut that was as sweet as molases 
But what really knocked me out was her cheap sunglasses 
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah 

solo 

Now go out and get yourself some thick black frames 
With the glass so dark thay won't even know your name 
And the choice is up to you cause they come in two classes 
Rhinestone shades and cheap sunglasses 
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
