Old man sleepin' the hot day away, 
while he dreams a thousand yesterdays. 
'Cause he's had so many come his way. 
All he cares about is somewhere to lay his head tomorrow. 

Old man sits and thinks about his home. 
Doesn't matter 'cause he's all alone. 
What he'd give to get back on his own. 
Curses his body 'cause it's old and it gives no transportation. 
He sits in his one room shack alone but it provides no consolation. 

What a shame, 
his time is nearin'. 
His eyes won't let him see 
the skies are clearin'. 
Someone tells him 
without his hearin'. 
It's no news to those who've been around 
while things are changin'.
