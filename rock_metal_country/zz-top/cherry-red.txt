Strange things going through my head 
Crazy things that I think she said 
Slides so slinky that it's gotta be real 
she just wanna know how to feel 
Cherry red, cherry red 
She just wanna feel cherry red 
Cherry red, cherry red 
She just wanna feel cherry red 
This town of killer bits is doing me in 
Tried to leave once, wanna do it again 
But this one little thing's such a thoroughbred 
I'm addicted to the feel of her cherry red 
Cherry red, cherry red 
She just wanna feel cherry red 
Cherry red, cherry red 
She just wanna feel cherry red 
Whip out a bottle of your favorite rave 
I think you better tend to your cherry grave 
Ain't nothing stupid what we're talking about 
Take a little twist and then you pour it on out 
Cherry red, cherry red 
She just wanna feel cherry red 
Cherry red, cherry red 
She just wanna feel cherry red
