Books on emerson books on thoreau
But all I read was maps of the road
And I was three thousand miles away from you
All the while I was twenty-two
What do you do to know who you are
The best way for me to drop out on tour
You went to Upstate NxY New York to go to school
To secure the roll with your parents
I got a new perspective on you
All the good and bad that we went through
I know you better than you know you
'Cause I got a new perspective on you
I never needed much, I never liked to loom
But a gesture can get me from across the room
The first night we talked until while the sun caught up
Transparent people melting all around us
You left in a plane, I left in a van
Played nightclub house-parties and auditoriums
Saw Germany England Italy with my band
I know you better than your new friends
I got a new perspective on you
All the good and bad that we went through
I know you better than you know you
'Cause I got a new perspective on you
Ford Econdlane September '93
Driving 10 hours until my eyes are blurry
3 packs of Winstons and a bag of seeds
Tapes of "x" and a thermos of coffee
6 weeks on and 10 days off
Then I go back on the road for another show
This is all that I've ever done
Girl I got nothing to fall back on
"But I got a new perspective on you All the good and bad that we went through 
I know you better than you know you 'Cause I got a new perspective on you"
