Come on baby won't you show me what you got
I want your salvation 

there's a neighborhood called blackhawk
where all the rich people hide
I was down on my luck working for the salvation army
The shelter is where i reside
Everyday we drive into blackhawk 
and we pick up the offerings
Microwave, refrigerator for the suffering

Come on baby won't you show me what you got
I want your salvation

I can't believe these people live like kings
Hidden estates and diamond rings
I'm a rat out on a mission
I'm in your front yard under suspicion 

Come on baby won't you show me what you got
I want your salvation
