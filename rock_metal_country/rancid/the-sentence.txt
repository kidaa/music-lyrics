My life the blessing
Understand my aggression
I don't regret nothing
It's all been a lesson
Me and my friend got the music
Like a loaded gun we're gonna use it
Tell us we ain't shit I won't listen
Try to hit us but you keep on missing
I KNEW THE SENTENCE THEN
I KNEW IT WAS GONNA BLOW
DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU
APOCALYPSE RADIO
Sometimes I'm a total wreck
I want to break someone's neck
I get a subwoofer going
Four twelves get my blood stream going
Never saw it coming paid my price in time
It's been ten years or more with all the
battle scars in my mind
I KNEW THE SENTENCE THEN
I KNEW IT WAS GONNA BLOW
DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU
APOCALYPSE RADIO
