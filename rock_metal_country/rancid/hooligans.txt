Rancid... Jah love... 

Yeah!
Here's the new face of rock-n'-roll!
It's about fightin' toe to toe... 
Hard times come, 
Yeah the hard times go.
When I say, come one, come all. 

Well all the hooligans and bootboys know one thing for sure,
Scars been stricken on their face
Well all the hooligans and bootboys know one thing for sure,
Scars been stricken on their face

One man's decision brings another's opposition completely unbound.
Down on the flats where the seaside meets my lonely youngtown 
Well all the rudies and skins well they're out on the streets making the way on the dole,
between the bottles and sex they smash and they wreck for something to live 

Well all the hooligans and bootboys know one thing for sure,
scars been stricken on their face. 
Sometimes you know there's no place to go,
But to a long life of crime. 

Yeah but it's so wrong to steal, 
Someone's very last meal to profit up a dime.
Your poe poes and greys well they end up in jail gonna swing the cowboys
Well you took a bite outta the apple of decision that got ya there boy. 

Well all the hooligans and bootboys know one thing for sure,
Scars been stricken on their face
Well all the hooligans and bootboys know one thing for sure,
Scars been stricken on their face

Hooligans and bootboys, I don't want no racial hatred

"Black and white, who are portrayed without bias
These are the people whose voice I want to be..." 

I said the hooligans!
Rancid
Bootboys!
Rancid
Hooligans!
Rancid
Bootboys!
Rancid

Well all the hooligans and bootboys know one thing for sure,
Scars been stricken on their face
Well all the hooligans and bootboys know one thing for sure,
Ahhh ahhhh ahhhhhh...
