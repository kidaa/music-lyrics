break down the fear
i got my animosity
i'm gonna breake it down 

armageddon is coming so you better start running
cause the big wave is coming to the shore
no suprise that you see throu the lies
of the system that's rotten to the core 

high tech survailance
paranoia and violence
keeping the city at a calm
break it down
tear it apart
the city's going off
like a bomb 

break down the fear
i got my animosity
i'm gonna breake it down 

helicopters coming down on me tonight
my brother selling cocaine he knows how to fight
hounded and arrassed in a power elite bought
sun ain't arise so i abite by my route
i remember a cold december when i heard the revolution rock
didnt hear what they were saying i ran thru the mayhem 
of a police state on my block
high tech survailance
paranoia and violence
keeping the city at a calm 

break it down
tear it apart
the city's going off
like a bomb
