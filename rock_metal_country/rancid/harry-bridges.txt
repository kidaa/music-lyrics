Bloody thursday was july 6th
the pigs killed 3 workers harry bridges grabbed the mic
The city shut down july 6th the workers outrage it was a general strike
The media clamed that the commies were taking over 
and some believed it was true
3 uncompremising strikes was paved the way
Minn Sf and Toledo 

Over and over again the doors are locked
and the windows are broken 

Eddie worked for general motors and he swore
that he'd never lose his job again
A union man who owned his own home
in beautiful flint michigan 

Eddie lost his job and eddie lost his wife
So eddie lost his self esteme
The last time i saw eddie
he was living in the trailer park again 

Over and over again the doors are locked
and the windows are broken

I believe eddie for gave too much too soon
I got a letter from eddie and it was bad news

Over and over again the doors are locked
and the windows are broken
