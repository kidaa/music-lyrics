There's a place where i like to go
When i got no food or i got no shelter
It's a house where i can get away
For maybe 3 days
To get off the drink and stay off the haze 

Who's the opposition i'm 7 years down
The human spirit prevails
Yeah I'm down down down 

Woke up in the bushes 6:30 tuesday morning
With a unopenned heineken a head that was burning
For 7 years i walked the same path
Dreams of being loved was all i ever had 

Who's the opposition i'm 7 years down
The human spirit prevails
Yeah I'm down down down
