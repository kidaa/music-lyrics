Rwanda yeah your moon shines bright
Rwanda over planned genocide
Rwanda, won't you be strong like a lion
Tune in the transistor
And listen to the news
Cause once a week it hits ya
Heart broken and blue
It's the voice over Africa
so stop peregrination 
So listen very closely to half a million dead souls
Rwanda yeah your moon shines bright
Rwanda over planned genocide
Rwanda, won't you be strong like a lion
It's complicated when facts come slow 
Mass destruction mass confusion
Whats the difference to the orphan
Orphans of the dead
When no more machine guns strike and there's silence instead
Rwanda yeah your moon shines bright
Rwanda over planned genocide
Rwanda, won't you be strong like a lion
