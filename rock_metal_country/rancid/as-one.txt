War between races
War between lies
War between something that was deep inside
You was wrong all along
I was right you lied
U to the n to the ity
Straight down too late can it kick the feeling
Looking from the bottom i can't see the ceiling
Shots rang out in the oakland winter
Can't stand alone you cant stand together 

as one, as one, as one 

No matter what they do they'll try to divide you
fear you up what's inside you way down down down
The scale hook the anchor to the gates of hell
Once you realize that it was so simple
What you given you can't take with you
I asked somebody if if they had the same vision
He said yeah i had the same vision
