Yeaaaaaaaah !!! 

There's something in the street tonight
Don't know what it is, but it won't keep quiet
Breaking through your masses on your radio brodcaster 

There's something in the air tonight
And it's turning in to a full fledge riot
Seen a boy's last dance, someone tried to buy him the truth 

Yeah!!! 

Oh oh oh oh oh nine lives
I'm gonna come right back for you
Oh oh oh oh oh nine lives
I'm gonna come right back for you 

There's something in the world today
Don't know what it is but it sure smells rotten
Babylon's burning and the fire seems waterproof 

There's someone in your home tonight
You think you know who they are
But something just ain't so right
I look at them a way but they don't feel the same about me 

Oh oh oh oh oh nine lives
I'm gonna come right back for you
Oh oh oh oh oh nine lives
I'm gonna come right back for you

And I run and run
And I hide and I hide
And I knew that I knew that I tried and tried
And I know it was all for you and me [x4]
