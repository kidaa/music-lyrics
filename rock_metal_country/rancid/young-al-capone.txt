In the army of Babylon I'm a young Al Capone
My self an outlaw in the eyes of the lord
Good man lose and the bad men win
The blind and the sick i attenuate them
Barrels of concrete and melted steel
Black smoke rises like a ghost in the field
Hardened lungs deep breathing the air
That stings the life from within me
Succobus catches on and it won't let me go
The leprosy sets in and you got no glue
The 3rd world working on the factory floor
It's so dark in there you can't see the sun no more
Cold and burnt, are frostbitten hands
Leave you like a flower that's been pulled from the sands
Rabbid dogs chewing at my feet
Trying to protect their side of the street
Army of Babylon, Young Al Capone yeah
Army of Babylon, Young Al Capone yeah
Young Al Capone yeah Young Al Capone yeah
Young Al Capone yeah Young Al Capone yeah
In the darkness among lonely sprites
Hopeless atmosphere, steel gates spear it
So simplistic, so realistic, so sadistic
Yea you lose it all:
Army of Babylon, Young Al Capone yeah
Army of Babylon, Young Al Capone yeah
Young Al Capone yeah Young Al Capone yeah
Young Al Capone yeah Young Al Capone yeah
Ok Tim take this one home...
