so i packed everything i owned
midnight christmas eve
a kid could feel alone
i drink my scotch
my mind goes astray
midnight christmas eve
starts out in a way
i cried when i had no shoes
'til i met the man with no feet 

it's just a
holiday sunrise
i suddenly realized
i got no alibis
holiday sunrise 

relatives of mine said
they were born again
fucked up world has made me born against
i'm a sinner and my soul should be cleansed
i'll take my chances when i'm dead
