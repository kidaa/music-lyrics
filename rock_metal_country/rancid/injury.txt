excuse me while i put i knife out of my back
how could i ever trust a person like that
along side the slow is someone moving faster
behind the warm image is a cold cold bastard 

corporate liberal bullshit ruling fucking class
take your fucking money and shove it up your ass
take your lies i've had enough of you
and all the shit that you put me through
i'm injured 

injury 

i look for the truth its getting hard to find
money grabbing dragon and the tie you hide behind
im so fucking stupid with you i was a buyer
i believed in you you deceiving liar
set me fucking free
