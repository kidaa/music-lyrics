Ok check this out
It aint impossible, it aint easy
Opportunity shifting here
So far the strategy aint working the facts are in it's so very clear
I do what I want I can't predict the future
And those who can I know that they are lying
I know the truth can be hard to swallow
A soap opera world leaders are crying
Correction I need no direction
Oh let me go just one last time
I spend my whole life searching for direction
Oh let me go just one last time
You can burn a book if you don't like the answers
Or join forces with an AXL grind
USA protecting your cancers
A list if hatred is easy to find
Well there's a growing sentiment in America
If you listen closely you can hear them all
Right is right wrong is wrong and evil
Consider it bad behavior
Correction I need no direction
Oh let me go just one last time
I spend my whole life searching for direction
Oh let me go just one last time
Bad generation polarize view
No one leaves home to go and help you
Watch CNN and then you know
US bombs come down, what you gonna do
Boom boom boom look around
There's no more roof no more house, no street, no town, shot down
Burnt black and brown
electrical meltdown
You'll hear the sound of the U.S. bomb all around
Ah it's a shake down
It's a break down
Atomic shutdown
And then you know!!!!!!
Correction I need no direction
Oh let me go just one last time
I spend my whole life searching for direction
Oh let me go just one last time
Correction I need no direction
Oh let me go just one last time
I spend my whole life searching for direction
Oh let me go just one last time
One last time....
