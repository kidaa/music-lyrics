i could not fit in
i was the one who got caught
i was the one who got realized
i was the one who got dropped
shut out banished and locked away
the knife that did me in i was carry to this day 

rejected
crossing the bridges in the land of the forgotten
rejected 

distrust existed that i never saw
deep seated trust i was a victim of 

rejected... 

unspoken among the more priveliged or the so called
i was not good enough not good enough at all
at first out of lonliness i tried to conform
but all that bullshit just left me alone
