If you wanna make the move
then you better come in
it's just the ability to reason
that wears so thin
living and dying and the stories that are true 
secrets to a good life is knowing when you're through

black coat, white shoes, blackhat, cadillac
the boy's a time bomb

he's back in the hole where they got him living
like a rat but he's smarter than that nine lives
like a cat take him to the youth authority home
first thing you learn is that you got to make it
in this world alone 

now he's gotten out he's gotten free he's gotta go
gotta car 21 years old he's runnin' from the
bar his pager's beepin' he's got in deep in
whatever he can move on in you know that kid's a creepin' 

in tears come from the razor that's been tattooed below
his eye his mother cries she knows that he is strong enough
to die he's rollin' in the cadillac it's midnight sunroof is down
three shots rung out the herd's deal
the new king is crowned.
