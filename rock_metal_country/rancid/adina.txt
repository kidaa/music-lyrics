i want to go where the action is
i want to fly through the urban blight
i want to live like a shadow in the dark
and only move at night

a story bought a one story house that
let's the winter bleed
21 years old and no money

how did she know the roof would cave in
over and over again
beat up bruised a record that's broken
adina's crying again

beat up chevy with a trailer in town
is what they call home now
one more hill or river to cross on
on the way to another town
crying in her beer and always running away
may be not so much running but hopin'
for better days

how did she know the roof would cave in
over and over again
beat up bruised a record that's broken
adina's crying again

[repeat 4x]
Hey Hey

she's crying again
