Are you gonna be ready to use it
If you hesitate they'll pursue it
Put the gun to the dome no question
Now the holy ghost in queston

what about the banks
When they say go
Standing at the top and can't let go
Standin' can't take can't take that time
When i try sometime i can't stay high 

Are you gonna be ready to use it
If you hesitate they'll pursue it
Good and evil erme from above
Death peace eternal love 

Bleeding at the gates and i can't come in
Courage that abates a life of sin
Sure that it holds and it holds no others
With the lies of the brave and the kid don't matter
