She's got her life going she is still breathing
It's not a proven fact it's just a feeling
Her old man doesn't own her like he did before
He once was so clear but now he's a blur
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO'S NOT AFRAID OF YOU
The homeless child is no roll she played
It is real as anything the system has made
She's a monument forever standing
Inner city exposure can be extremely demanding
The pattern is circular as we pass the wine
She could no longer live with the lying
Her family tried to control her feelings
It just gave her new life a deeper meaning
Either you shut up or you shut down
I'm not the only one
you motherfucker
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO'S NOT AFRAID OF YOU
