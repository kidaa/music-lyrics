Hey Ho, Hey Ho, Hey Ho, Hey Ho, Hey Ho 

Well I'm a crazy upsetter Driving me insane
Yea I'm a street wise professor Who am I to blame
Now if you listen to the record Do you feel the same 
Well it don't get any better Going backwards again 

Whoa swing your fists, whack stitches in the face
Fuck ups on me I feel sorry I work here 
Never been like them with this society 
Life protects me feeling the finality 

Now my guns are blazin'
Bloodclot I can see 360 
Now my guns are blazin'
Pick it back up and start it all over again

Hey Ho, Hey Ho

Well I'm a bad motherfucker Driving me insane
So don't you even bother Who am I to blame 
Cause when I listen to the record Do you feel the same
And it don't get any better Going backwards again 

I read your words, I read your banner of hope
Well I kick my way in it seems to piss you all off
Well I try to shut the gates the walls are fading 
I climb from the depths of hell I'm escaping/unscathed 

Now my guns are blazin'
Bloodclot I can see 360 
Now my guns are blazin'
Pick it back up and start it all over again 

Hey Ho, Hey Go 

Now my guns are blazin'
Bloodclot I can see 360 
Now my guns are blazing 
Pick it back up and start it all over again 

Bloodclot
Oh yeah
Well I can see 360
I can see all around me
Ah yeah
Nah na na nah nah
Hey Ho, Hey Ho, Hey Ho
Nah na na nah nah
Well I can see 360 
Hey Ho, Hey Ho!
