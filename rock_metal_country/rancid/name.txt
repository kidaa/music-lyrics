[repeat 3x]
You don't know my name
man you don't know my name 

Paint a number on my head
work me 'til i'm dead
I can't believe i've wasted
all these years i've tasted

A million days and nights all this pain and struggle
All for what i ask all the hate and trouble

You don't know my name
man you don't know my name 

Punch drunk from the punch clock
opportunity never gonna knock
No more blue collar
all the unions gettin' smaller 

A million nights and all the pain and struggle
All for what i ask all the hate and trouble 

You don't know my name
man you don't know my name
