Yeah!!! 

He's gonna go go get it
Gonna run run set it 

Hidden realm
Ahh! everybody knows, it's fucking wild and there's no fronting about it
It's not the style, nor a trial
It's the best of love and hate
Come on everybody, lets get together
I appall the backdrop of hate 

Well there's no more food on the table
What was strong, no longer able
And an open mind, no longer stable
And it spin like a DJ's turntable 

A million eyeballs and a blink and a smile
With no dimensions in sight
Well given an inch, a billion colors
The entire world's contrast light 

Oh it ain't right, another fight
Well all of it's so very clear
With my passion on a stud, I walked through 
I walked through the vicious ones
I really don't care 

Well there's no more food on the table
What was strong, no longer able
And an open mind, no longer stable
And it spin like a DJ's turntable 

My western mind has a hard time hard time
Getting across this trust
Passive resistance, Your assistance You're the one smoking dust

It ain't a style, nor a trial, it's the best of love and hate love and hate
Come on everybody lets get together, I appall the backdrop of hate 

Well there's no more food on the table
I once/What was strong, no longer able
And an open mind, no longer stable
And it spin like a DJ's turntable 

Well ya spin like a DJ's turntable
Well ya spin like a DJ's turntable
Well ya spin like a DJ's turntable
