Ah no!
No no! 
Go!!! 

With a gleaming success
With a different try
Religious indifference
Mixed between the lies/lines

Territorial company they legitimize
Persecution to form enterprise
The UN is called
To buffer it all

The problem is spreading international
Like Ireland's Belfast it's coming to be
A brand new key

Working class girl puts her money to the test... Yeah
She's got a new dress
She's gonna look her best
Yugoslavia's been blown to bits... Yeah
She's got a new dress
She's lookin' to the west

Well entertain the idea of a peaceful end
 takes all   some things slow down to the used-to-been 
Of a world which is seen the citizens die
While the innocent children play near fire now

When I'm not getting through, and see evidence
Another truth, we're bombing us
The time for civil war is the sooner I live
The chivalrous ones are never represented 

Working class girl puts her money to the test... Yeah
She's got a new dress
She's gonna look her best
Yugoslavia's been blown to bits... Yeah
She's got a new dress
She's lookin' to the west

Allocating people for 
The methods of the summons are dastardly
Try to cleanse the hands of the murdering
But the advantage of guilt is lingering 

Shadows of soldier lay nearby
The dead ones finally reach a compromise
Destruction of war lies in Bosnia
The destruction of war lies in Bosnia
