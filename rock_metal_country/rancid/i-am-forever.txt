I am forever is what he said
Lost in a dream he never had
Doors bust open doors slam shut
The key to change is time
He said, my dear mother I let you down
No-one want to be a burden on a loved one
Doors bust open doors slam shut
The key to change is time
Riding the freight train all the while
Your building the fucking tracks
Doors bust open doors slam shut
The key to change is time
Doors bust open doors slam shut
The key to change is time
