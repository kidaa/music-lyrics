I got some hard times
Two punks up on the subway
It's a long way to go
To get to Leicester Square

A hard line
It's the one you gotta cross
The one you gotta cross
To get you anywhere 

Michael's on his way to pay back syndication
A fist  and his backstreet education
The 8-ball stops him low
Demonstrations show
It's crystal clear it ain't so great for those who become broken in here yeah 

I got none
I got no mind for... nothing
I got no insight, I got no feelings
I got nothing that you want, so stay away from here 

The clockers  that could swamp us now, the prime objective: Fear
To rob us for some different  places no one near
The tension begins to grow
 so
He  yeah 

I got none
I got no mind for... nothing
I got no insight, I got no feelings
I got nothing that you want, so stay away from here 

Yeah!!! 

Ah no no!!!
ah no!!!
Ah no no no no!!!

I got some hard times
Two punks up on the subway
It's a long way to go
To get to Leicester Square

A hard line
It's the one you gotta cross
The one you gotta cross
To get you anywhere 

Mike gets whipped, his boy-face slapped around a cheap cigar
His gang could sing cause they're always seeing the trouble from afar
He act so apropos  stall
He makes his point then jumps in
joint to the backseat with a bottle of beer mulatto girl 

I got none
I got no mind for... nothing
I got no insight, I got no feelings
I got nothing that you want, so stay away from here 

Yeah!!! 

Ah no no!!!
Ah no!!!
Ah no no no no 

I got some hard times
Two punks up on the subway
It's a long way to go
To get to Leicester Square 

A hard line
It's the one you gotta cross
The one you gotta cross
To get you anywhere 

Yeah!!! 

You see I got none
I got no mind for... nothing
I got no insight, I got no feelings
I got nothing that you want, so stay away from here
