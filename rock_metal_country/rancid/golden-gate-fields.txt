This is not Churchhill downs this is not Hollywood Park
When the field is wide open
I'll pick the horse that's got the biggest heart
Let em run let em ride let em roll down the track
Let em win place and show
Let em one dollar exact
Six furlongs four phillys
Three mares three years and up
Who measures up
Well I wish you luck
Who measures up
Well I wish you luck
This is not Churchhill downs this is not Hollywood Park
When the field is wide open
I'll pick the horse that's got the biggest heart
Well they rush the windows and play odds on fave
But theMy starter in 2nd deuces down a bit of give and take
Race is a puzzler when they open from the outside 
It's a hit and run and they look back
You can't count on that
That's a fact
The old men from El Cerrito
Who talk about their picks
And they talk about all the wins of the great jock leftgit Pincay
This is not Churchhill downs this is not Hollywood Park
When the field is wide open
I'll pick the horse that's got the biggest heart
Every time i come back to the east bay i run into "big L"
My old friend Big L he's not doing so well
Me and Big L grew up across the freeway from the track
WE spent may days at the track
I see Big L come rollin up the street
On his little sister's pink ten speed
He said "Tim, Tim don't you remember me" 
"way back from 1973"
Every time i se him he has to remind me
Like i would ever forget Big L
Then he's gone
Like a flash
Then he's gone
Like a flash
yeah like a flash
Ok this is rancid signing off for now 
until next time we'll see you guys later...
