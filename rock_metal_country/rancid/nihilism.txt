come into the union district
drive down on sharmon palms
white ghettos paint a picture
broken homes and broken bones
i was so full of scotch i could not stand up
i was hittin the shots and i moved to a cup
release me from moral assumption 
total rejection total destruction
nihilistic feelings are moving if i try real hard
i'll see right through them

nihilism! 

walkin a path of self destruction 
not affected by the repercussions
lady on the billboard offer me a drink
said not right now i need time to think
nihilistic feelins are movin
if you try real hard
you'll see right through them 

i was so full of scotch i could not stand up
i was hittin the shots and i moved to a cup
white ghettos paint a picture
broken homes and broken bones
