Who would've thought that the dreams come true
And who would've thought I ended up with you
And who would've thought what they said was true
But it was and you are, lighted darkness come through 

Silhouetted palm trees backing it up against the sky
Echo Park sunset, an ambulance drives by
But someone went down
And I wonder who
Faces flash forward, it could be anybody I knew 

So I drank like a fish and I crawled like a rat 
Through the city of shit I ended up on my back
But I can't believe you're with me after dark
So let it come together in Echo Park 

And I say
Who would've thought that the dreams come true
And who would've thought I ended up with you
And who would've thought what they said was true
But it was and you are, lighted darkness come through 

A red flag and your body wins 
Or a snake bite, gotta start again 
So I'm fucked up and watching TV all day 
I don't wanna see what Ricki Lake gotta say 

And it hits me when I'm alone, I'm an angry man
I start singing to myself I got dealt a shitty hand
With all these feelings my heart could explode 
So is it not fear, knowing it all 

And I say
Who would've thought that the dreams come true
And who would've thought I ended up with you
And who would've thought what they said was true
It was and you are, lighted darkness come through 

Nah nah nah nah nah 

Who would've thought that the dreams come true
And who would've thought I ended up with you
And who would've thought what they said was true
But it was and you are, lighted darkness come through
