That is the vision of the anarchist... it is also a boy's dream

True to Warsaw, glad we did it
Beat him down with a baseball bat
Police retreated the riot scenes in fear of a baseball bat
Working class intellectuals, disillusion you for sure
Broken dreams in warsaw, where all the dreams fall down 

American baseball bat!
Demolish the discotheque!
And how many blows to his forearm and neck
'Til he lay in the schoolyard, bludgeoned to death!

December 13, '81, who remembers a loaded gun
Who remembers the first morning of martial law
Hey, you should bring that Louisville
Yeah man, I'll know where
Yeah man economic  army, hardship in Warsaw

American baseball bat!
Demolish the discotheque!
And how many blows to his forearm and neck
'Til he lay in the schoolyard, bludgeoned to death!

Hey! All alone, bludgeoned to death!
