[repeat 2x]
Back down no back down comin' up
Rise up no rise up showin up
Lock down no lock down comin' up
International cover-up

What about the state of the union
What about the guns they're using
What about the kids that don't matter
What about a genaral strike

You don't know what it's like
Whats it's like what it's like...

[repeat 2x]
Back down no back down comin' up
Rise up no rise up showin up
Lock down no lock down comin' up
International cover-up

What about the cage getting rattled
What about the international battle
What about the kids who are dreaming
What about the kid who got stopped

You don't know what it's like
Whats it's like what it's like...
