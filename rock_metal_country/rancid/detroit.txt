i didn't know what time it was until the sun went down
Detroit mild on the bus downtown
last night i was fighting on the street
but tonight i have a girl next to me in this cold world
she brings me heat

i got a good feeling in a bad city tonight
i gotta good feeling everything's gonna be alright
some run some fight
i got a good feeling in a bad city tonight

detained in illegal custody spent the night in jail
with a drunken priest and a hooker $500 bail
nobody knew who was who standing in the street like that
i hit the ground to make a sound 

i got a good feeling in a bad city tonight
i gotta good feeling everything's gonna be alright
some run some fight
i got a good feeling in a bad city tonight

bus droped me off and i had to cough i couldn't breath
'cuz i got ripped off i couldn't realize by being satisfied 'cause it runs so thin
and thats why im pissed off we had no money we had time
she had the champagne i had the cisco wine
she said do you want to come you better hurry because
we'll have hell to pay
