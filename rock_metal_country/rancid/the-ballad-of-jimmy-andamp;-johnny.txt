Jimmy and johnny two friends of mine
skinheads what they clamed
Outside simalarities but they don't feel the same
Johnny thinks jimmy is a mod
and jimmy thinks johnny's a punk
Jimmy listens to ska
and johnny likes last resort
Jimmy and johnny in the trenches
We down tonight
Drinking guiness smoking 555's
Once you're in the middle you feel alright
Skinheads tats and a fred perry
There's a was in the cemetary
Start to fight stop drinking
What the fuck were they thinking 

Jimmy and johnny tell me what you're seeing
Yeah yeah yeah yeah 

Jimmy had his two tone girl on the back of his scooter that night
Johnny had a jackes up chevy that could blow you right off the line
Skinheads tats and a fred perry
There's a was in the cemetary
Start to fight stop drinking
What the fuck were they thinking

Jimmy and johnny tell me what you're seeing
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
