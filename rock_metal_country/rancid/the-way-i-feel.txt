Pick me back up just to throw me back down
apoogies too like when you're up against the wall
compassion heals while duplicity kills
you say I'm different the only thing different is 

the way I feel about you
Na na na na na na na na na na 

You moved up the ladder at a very rapid speed
we moved methodically
and calmly when you got to the top you see enemies 

if I knew back then what I know that
it would all turn out like this
I'd sit back and I'd watch you squirm
cause you say I'm different

the only thing different is
the way i feel about you.....
