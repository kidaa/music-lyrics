I didn't trust him, 'cause he smiled at me first
Just like the wolf before he bites me
And I didn't go there I swear that it was cursed
Just as if it was to despite me 

I saw some better days, from  to hunter place
A portrait of a sum of the last couple years
See I lost an image, an image of chaos
Yeah all I'd rather notice, isolation in place 

Of all the kids been losing everything, every single day
And all this deadly drama you know I see myself fall
 A lost canyon
Consuming all 

It's just you
It's just you
Consuming all 

I didn't trust him, cause he smiled at me first
Just like the wolf before he bites me
And I didn't go there I swear that it was cursed
Just as if it was to despite me 

So on the antisocial side
You know I find myself a job

 incredible artist 

 a delicate balance
I never really thought I could make it all happen
The anarchist kid gives a fuck about you
I stood up every single time I fell 

It's just you
It's just you
Consuming her 

I didn't trust him, cause he smiled at me first
Just like the wolf before he bites me
And I didn't go there I swear that it was cursed
Just as if it was to despite them 

I didn't trust him, cause he smiled at me first
Just like the wolf before he bites me
And I didn't go there I swear that it was cursed
Just as if it was to despite me 

Yeah!!!
