Yeah we're on/rhymmes  imagine that
All punk rock must move inside, all  must move inside.
Come out to Brooklyn Town and Coyote Studios 

[repeat 2x]
London you're gonna find them
New York, L.A., back to Kingston
All I see is youth fighting
All I see is youth fighting

Well, in sympathy, there's some
Integrity, but in
Humility I've come to find a whole lot more 

I'm not one to judge, nor I
Carry a grudge, but I
Refuse to budge my determinating vow 

London you're gonna find them London town
New York, L.A., back to Kingston waterhouse
All I see is youth fighting youth them all they fight
All I see is youth fighting youth them all they fight 

London you're gonna find them Brixton
New York, L.A., back to Kingston Kingston, JA
All I see is youth fighting youth them all they fight
All I see is youth fighting youth them all they fight 

Come I said put down your ratchet now
Rudeboy set down your gun
L.A., Kingston, New York and London
Move, nobody fight, form together as one
This gun pressure soon be over and done 

 the road controlled by Satan
Fight back from that with love vibration
Pull out, division, racism, and schism
We gonna make 'em flee, run 

Easy, you know it ain't easy
Got to make a decision
Got to learn to say no, no, no... 

I burn from inside all the walls
A dead man can't hear all the calls
Who lives like a sheep in the city concrete
Never runs deep and dies from the heat 

Coppers and hoods, dead man's stood
It ain't no good when you're misunderstood
When you're rotting in jail, wish you would be
Out on the street like Robin Hood 

All those who fall, those who try
Let them go, oh victimize
You see you ain't gonna take their power, demise
Not in your lifetime see more hypnotized, come again 

London you're gonna find them London town
New York, L.A., back to Kingston waterhouse
All I see is youth fighting youth them all they fight
All I see is youth fighting youth them all they fight

London you're gonna find them Brixton
New York, L.A., back to Kingston Kingston, JA
All I see is youth fighting youth them all they fight
All I see is youth fighting youth them all they fight 

Come I said put down your ratchet now
Rudeboy set down your gun
L.A., Kingston, New York and London
Move, nobody fight, form together as one
This gun pressure soon be over and done 

 the road controlled by Satan
Fight back from that with love vibration
Pull out, division, racism, and schism
We gonna make 'em flee, run 

Easy, you know it ain't easy
Got to make a decision
Got to learn to say no, no, no 

I burn from inside all the walls
A dead man can't hear all the calls
Who lives like a sheep in the city concrete
Never runs deep and dies from the heat 

Heat... heat... heat...heat... 

[repeat 4x.]
London you're gonna find them London Town
New York, L.A., back to Kingston Kingston, JA
All I see is youth fighting youth them all they fight
All I see is youth fighting youth them all they fight

All I see is you/youth fighting
All I see is you/youth fighting
All I see is you/youth fighting...
