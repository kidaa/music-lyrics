disfigured and oblique
From the appetite that i seek
I'm a hungry cannibal
I'm a rabid animal
My remains are begin scattered
I've been bludgeoned I'm in pain
Stomach pains are coming and they strike with demon speed
Dead bodies everywhere
Piles of blood and entrails and hair
I'm bleeding from the inside from the Armageddon outside
Recurring rotting dreams
>From this place the demons speak
My skin exfoliates
My patience terminates
unfold to unholy urges unearthed with urgency
The holocaust was nothing compared to my lividly
Dead bodies everywhere
Piles of blood and entrails and hair
I'm bleeding from the inside from the Armageddon outside
In this oblong box
That's eating you
There's nothing you can do!!!
Dead bodies everywhere
Piles of blood and entrails and hair
I'm bleeding from the inside from the Armageddon outside
Dead bodies!
Dead bodies!
Dead bodies!
