Never fell in love
until i fell in love with you
Never know what a good time was until i had a good time with you
If you wanna get the feeling and you wanna get it right
Then the music gotta be loud
for when the music hit i feel no pain at all

Warm summer night i was drinking with my dad
He tried to give me the love that i never had
But he gave more love to his bottle of wine
So i had to go out and find love of another kind 

Here it is
Here i am
Turn it up
fuckin' loud

Radio, Radio, Radio... 

When i got the music
i got a place to go

Radio clash
magnificent 7
I was a choir boy
you showed me no heaven
Two tools surley lost
no remorse ignoring the cost

Here it is
Here i am
Turn it up
fuckin' loud

Radio, Radio, Radio... 

When i got the music
i got a place to go
