I saw an old man on the street
he was in a dumpster lookin' for somethin' to eat
he moved so slow like a dyin' dream
like a machinist who got caught in the machine 

I saw this lady and she was cryin'
she said it's hard when someone you love is dyin'
I saw this kid who was about 5 years old
he was in the park all alone he was cold 

there's something coming around
as wicked as it may seem
as wicked as anything could be 

I know this girl she's barely alive
she's all haggard she's only twenty-five
she said she never had a friend before
I said "hey girl I'll be your friend but who's keepin' score"
I sawthis other little girl on the phone
her mother comforts her from far from home
the little girl was very hesitant
her best friend lie dead on the pavement

I always end up back on the hill
lookin' down at the landfill
I always go there when I can
my friend Marty said Tim you're a lucky man
