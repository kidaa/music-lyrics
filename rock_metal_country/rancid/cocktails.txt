Broke, dough, dope, the line is choked 
Smoked the last dollar to a name 
Are you buying
Are you selling girl 

Talking square never change 
And if I really wanna know 
What it means for her to be free 
Oh she's mixing cocktails 
In a squat down Avenue C
Yeah running through the street 

The parasitic 
Ah, don't give her a fight
He gets shallow so I know 
There won't be no fucking rainbow in sight 
And then deny allegations so strenuously
Oh man, don't get outta control
She was left wrestling in a silent anger
So hell I can't be there for her 

I ain't looking for answers
I don't want nothing is for free
I sure don't want your respect
I just wanna know who's talking to me
I just wanna know who's talkin' to me 

I know she's jackin, homegirl's mackin'
Tried to make sure am I in love
 you and me
She won't relinquish herself to you, and I sense an emergency 

She can cry, she can hide 
In the lower east side
Been so low in the fast lane curse
Above all the infamous, with its circus of the fools 

And if I really want to know how the pernicious stay on top
Oh they don't break, no break they don't fake
They think they'll wake
They don't stop 

I ain't looking for answers
I don't want nothing is for free
I sure don't want your respect
I just wanna know who's talking to me
I just wanna know who's talkin' to me 

Yeah 

I just wanna know who's talkin' to me
I just wanna know
I just wanna know who's talkin' to me
