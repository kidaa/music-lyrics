Look up you're in Cleveland again
a solid line that never ends
i've got stories you'll never realize
and i know it i wear it on my sleeve 

there must be somethin' about you that I liked but
right here in the rain you know it just don't seem right
I always go out I never hide but in Cleveland
I should have stayed inside 

good morning heartache
your like an old friend 

come and see me again testify my love
for you I know it runs deep through your body too
from the cold blacktop to the hot concrete
the old tan van it ain't so sweet 

somewhere in America in the city at night
we were far from home but you know it was gonna be alright 

the unfortunate get prayed on by vultures eyes
86 cents in these pockets of mine
