A cat lies awake when it sleeps
was she conscious of her own miseries
will the amount of her pain
win her to enlightenment and set conscience free 

do you really wanna know what's happenin'
do you really wanna know what's goin' on
hey girl you better please take a look around
you better explore your heart and find out for yourself 

Jenny Demilo you don't care nothin' about me

I never realy had a reason
never had a use for one before
but now I know that there's now a prize
but for the wise and the unwise 

do you really wanna know what's happenin'
do you really wanna know what's goin' on
hey girl you better please take a look around you explore your heart
and find out for yourself

Jenny Demilo you don't care nothin' about me
