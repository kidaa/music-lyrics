Realize you're dehumanized
You critisize your existance
It's your demise when no sun arise
When you're paralized by your lack of resistance 

She know she is
She knows she's going
Down below where the fire's glowing
Tenderloin 

The tricks she gets them she's not a victim
She makes a list of them and reads them all alone
For money she's walking down on larkin'
In T.I. they're rocking all night long
