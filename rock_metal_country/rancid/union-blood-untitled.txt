Bloody thursday was july 6th
the pigs killed 3 workers
harry bridges grabbed the mic
The city shut down july 6th
the workers outrage it was a general strike
The media clamed that the commies were taking over and some believed it was true
3 uncompremising strikes was paved the way Minn Sf and Toledo 

But on the situation
But on the street sometimes
You're gonna hit the cold concrete
