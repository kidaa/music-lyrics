kick the kick drum increase the weight of the sound
the dialog of maximum decibles is enough to move the fucking ground
i'm gonna amplify the rage of a class
that's thought inferior the message in the volume
this song a carrier 

unwritten rules
rules understood
unwritten rules 

boomin' out the speakers and amps in the hood
i like to drink beer play music and go to shows
it's not about paying your dues if you do it out of love
i'm not a jaded junkie running dry
i don't know anything else
i'll be playing till i die
