in the dark with the okland skyline
as i cross the city i avoid the landlines
all i wanna do is make it through without dying
all i wanna do is keep on trying 

another night
in the streets for me
another night
no sanctuary
another night
come and watch me bleed
another night
in the streets for me 

she wouldn't move until the coast was clear
she always knew the final battle was near
if you have a bag of dope she give it up for free
if you got a song of hope it will help her see 

another night
in the streets for me
another night
no sanctuary
another night
come and watch me bleed
another night
in the streets for me
