Creeps burn and run their life too calm too windy
To form a wasteland
Atomic blow
A total nothing
Totaled completely
You filth's are discovered but you eyes are boiling 
It's a Sick Sick World so what do you do kid
Come on down, it's your turn, yeah it's your turn! 
A night at the goat is the name of the band
A total giant glass ought to make the plan
This song's about when you go back-to-back
when you let out the dogs and your 
mind is a stag 
It's a Sick Sick World so what do you do kid
Come on down, it's your turn, yeah it's your turn! 
It's a Sick Sick World so what do you do kid
Come on down, it's your turn, yeah it's your turn!
