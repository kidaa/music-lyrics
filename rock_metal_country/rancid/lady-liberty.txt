Lady Liberty, come down and bleed to me
I want nothing to do with your crazy world
Broken promises, those poor noises
Are bringin' it by the time for all the famine and the law
From the contras to the upstarts to shouted Sandanistas 

Lady Liberty, come down and bleed to me
You had me to believe that the streets are paved in gold
Storming  west, then the cold hits
Then I come to find that the streets aren't paved at all
From the contras to the upstarts to shouted Sandanistas
From the contras to the upstarts to shouted Sandanistas 

From the Kremlin to Afeghanistan to the forgotten ones
She offers it confusion to distraught refugees
In the fields of poison ivy, through the famine and disease
You bled my loyalty 

Lady Liberty, come down and bleed to me
You had me to believe that the streets are paved in gold
All you tell me not to worry
About the short comings of lives and the high cost of living
From the contras to the upstarts to shouted Sandanistas
From the contras to the upstarts to shouted Sandanistas 

Shouted Sandinista!!!
