Another show with a fucked up promoter
Kids sent in by the media controller
They arrived in a '87 Ford with a gun rack
case of Bud and stiletto blade
It's the kind of show you end up at
when you get stabbed by the blade
big business made
I WANNA GO BOOT I WANNA GO BLADE
The main controller tried to buy me out but I didn't buy it
Some people did and there is nothing I could do about it
They arrived in a '87 Ford with a gun rack
case of Bud and a stiletto blade
It's the kind of show you end up at
when you get stabed by the blade
big business made
I WANNA GO BOOT I WANNA GO BLADE
The kids unloads his glock into the urban blight
Bullets sprayed the car as we drove into the night
We lived to tell the story and I'm goona tell you
The State of the Union of the State of California
I WANNA GO BOOT I WANNA GO BLADE
