He was an artist and a writer
and a poet and a friend
in a man's life he will take a fall
but how low he goes it just depends 

he's shooting dope in the men's room
at the station daly city train
have you ever seen an angel well I know I have
they'll stay here for a while and then they'll fly away 

Jackyl had a beer in his hand last time I seen him
when he rolled the dice he never thought twice
never thought twice about being 

some grown up and some grow old
but what about the kid who never learned the rules
spent all these years on this earth
when you look back it's just a flicker of time 

Jackyl was one of the one's that he was one
of the one's that was already saved
through all the evil and wreckage
he maintained a sense of himself 

some men are in prison even though they walk the streets at night
other men who got the lockdown are free as a bird in flight
