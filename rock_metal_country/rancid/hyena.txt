concrete class stone and gravel

[repeat 2x]
i'm a hyena fighting for lion share
sometimes the lions share ain't there

every time i turn around it's the same sad story
getting ganked i wish it could end in lifes comisary
i'm a bad missionary with a wicked message i sent
who can i trust in a world of greed
when i'm taught to take and not to give

who can i trust when i'm taught to take and not to give

I'm money broke and it's no joke can't core use the rope this time Hey !!
nuckel up buckel up the ride's getting rough but i will not loose my mind Hey !!
permit me to do what i want and i will i'm a nomad to travel Hey !!
concrete class stone and gravel

i'm a hyena fighting for lion share
sometimes the lions share ain't there
sometimes the lions share ain't there.....shit
