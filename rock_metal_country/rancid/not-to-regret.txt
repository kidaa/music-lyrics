Some people say I'm fuckin crazy
But it don't phase me
It's just amazing
Someone shout out Hallelujah

She was a minuscule miniskirt hiked up
And if you like that you walk a tight rope
Blood of Jesus gonna cleans ya
So lets begin to put down a wage
Everybody tells me to look within but I'll look within the city of sin
I'm gonna tell you one thing, It's not to regret
I the city of sin, in the city of sin
It's a modern day Sodom and Gomorra
Bus station, no hesitation
For some poor bastard it's a ruin
It's like a coffin, a desert Kremlin
If your lucky then you'll fuckin hit it
You take an avoid with the money then you split it
It don't matter if you win there, just to be there rather than elsewhere
Everybody tells me to look within but I'll look within the city of sin
I'm gonna tell you one thing, It's not to regret
In the city of sin, in the city of sin
Some people say I'm fuckin crazy
But it don't phase me
It's just amazing
Someone shout out Hallelujah

Everybody tells me to look within but I'll look within the city of sin
I'm gonna tell you one thing, It's not to regret
In the city of sin, in the city of sin
