Some people are rotten deep down to the core
Some people got the kick of a bull
and the lies of a chronic thief in store
Some people try to take you out if they can
But I'll go right through them I'm a battering ram
Been running my whole life and I'm still running
Integrity is something you never had
Reverence to your lies as a person you're bad
Falsified living on the truth you're gonna choke
I'll just sit back and watch you cut your own troat
Back biting hypocrite you're a liar
Telling lies is what fuels your fire
Once you get discovered the bullshit ends
I ain't stopping
BATTERING RAM
RIGHT ON RIGHT ON
RIGHT ON RIGHT ON
THRU TO YOU
Some people got no reliance some people are shit
Some people got no validity not a bit
Some people want to break down what's inside if they can
But I go right thru them I'm a Battering Ram
Been running my whole life and I'm still running
The man who talked shit I shut him down he's through
Beat down the lies till they're black and blue
He talked so much shit but not today
I'm a siege engine get outta my way
I disregard the attempt to take me out
I curse the thought of another bout
but it's my method I ain't stopping
BATTERING RAM
RIGHT ON RIGHT ON
RIGHT ON RIGHT ON
THRU TO YOU
To fucking you
Some people are rotten deep down to the core
Some people got the kick of a bull
and the lies of a chronic thief in store
Some people try to take you out if they can
But I go right thru them I'm a Battering Ram
BATTERING RAM
RIGHT ON RIGHT ON
RIGHT ON RIGHT ON
THRU TO YOU
