Hangin' out with Lars down on 6th street
he knew I was in trouble
I was feeling much like the devil
there was something burnin' deep inside of me

ran into three Puerto Ricans
these girls took us to the funhouse
where we played a lonely pinball machine 

hangin' on the corner of 52nd. and Broadway
cars passin' by but none of them seem to be goin' my way 

New York City well I wish I was on a highway
back to Olympia...

I'm having a hard time understanding
it gets all too demanding
she's all gone and I'm stranded
something burning deep inside of me 

all I know it's 4'o'clock and
she ain't never showed up
and I watched a thousand people go home from work 

how many times will it take me
before I go crazy
before I lose everything
something burning deep inside of
me ran into three Puerto Ricans
those girls took us to the funhouse
I don't wanna be alone again.
