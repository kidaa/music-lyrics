Like sand, just take your dreams away
Running on the ground
At the end of the day it's your life, your loss
If you can't get the clock around 

I said what I got you can have 
You better not miss a shot
You're letting yourself get into all kinds of danger
Soon enough you're gonna get caught

They had a feeling
Was like you had to prove you're one in a million
And I'm talking bout junkies been dealing
This time the drugs are you
And they'll come through
It ain't gonna stop 'til they get what they want

And I say
Nobody knows me, I'm all alone
Ah yayayayay I gotta go
It's a Hollywood bus stop and the party's over
Ah yayayayay I gotta go 

John  his homeboy down so he waited for a ride
Then waited to come by at the Hollywood's concert backslide
With affordable odds and a sunroof, nestled among the filth
Frequencies and bad intentions, gotta take it for what it's worth 

Have you ever been hunted
By your past
And it will never let you go
Well never never let you go
No! I said
Well never never let you go 

And I say
Nobody knows me, I'm all alone
Ah yayayayay I gotta go
It's a Hollywood bus stop and the party's over
Ah yayayayay I gotta go
