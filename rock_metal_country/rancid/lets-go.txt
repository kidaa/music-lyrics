Jimmy said he could handle this
Ohhhh, he's from Los Angeles ohh!

Jimmy said he could handle this
Born and raised in West Los Angeles
Dad's a lawyer, Mummy's sleep,
runs down the family can't ya see,
One thing seems very clear
Daddy's got no connection here,
Everything's reject and demanded,
Lived your life and thought handled it
Let the dying shorten this Rythmmmm!!! 

Let's Go! Where the shores are green
Let's Go! Where the music's loud
Let's Go! Where there ain't no problems, fuck this, fucking transit 

I ain't forty, I like your stories
Keep them coming cause It's kind a boring
It ain't coming you have to find it
'Cause all of a sudden you got grounded
You didn't care, you just did
At the sign that said: "all beware",
In and Out and said: 'Oi, Tik, Tok',
I'm glad you got away of me
Let the dying shorten this Rythmmmm!!! 

Let's Go! Where the shores are green
Let's Go! Where the Music's loud
Let's Go! Where there ain't no problems, fuck this, fucking transit 

Yeah, yeah, yeah!!!
Yeah, yeah,yeah, yeah!! yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!
