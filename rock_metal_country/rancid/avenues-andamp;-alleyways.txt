I figured out the problem yea the problem is you
you didn't see us comin' now there's nothin' you can do
times are gonna change, change or step aside
it's my point of view that took you by surprise 

the sun's comin up yea the new dawn arrives
new generation standing stand with anger in their eyes
no love in the city 'cause there's no connection
been stricken with disease a racial infection

I'm a rattering ram comin' through to you
in every alleyway on every avenue

actions could erase all the fear that we suffer
people segregated no one understands each other
he's a different color but we're the same kid
I will treat him like my brother he will treat me like his 

well an eye for an eye yea a tooth for a tooth
brother against brother should be singin' with the group
the inner cities burnin' yea it's screamin' black and blue
the power and the passion of a million youth 

I figured out the problem yea the problem is you
you din't see us comin' now there's nothin' you can do
he's a different color but we're the same kid
I will treat him like my brother he will treat me like his
all the blood that spills of all the guts that fly
the media paints a picture that stands
pits dogs against cats now who is responsible
the power in the issue
the force is unstoppable
