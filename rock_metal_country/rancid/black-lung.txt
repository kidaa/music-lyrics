Sign a petition under working condition
Union is in bed with the coal operators call of berettas
Carry are freedom looking for something
To get you family better life for every single day 

Some things keep me going
Well I got no one to blame
Five o'clock is comin'
Do you feel the same
When a lonely whistle
Calls out your name

What a man likes to see
When they come after mine
No prettiness for the mighty black lung
Rank and file workers, rank and file minds
Take off the gloves and sock it to 'em

Some things keep me going
Well I got no one to blame
Five o'clock is comin'
Do you feel the same
When a lonely whistle
Calls out your name

Hey young believer/unbeliever Hey
Black lung fever Hey
Transmit receiver Hey
Backed up deceiver Hey
Well I don't like it either Hey
We're all presidents for the Hey
Black lung fever Hey

Some things keep me going
Well I got no one to blame
Five o'clock is comin'
Do you feel the same
When a lonely whistle
Calls out your name
