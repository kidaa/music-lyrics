Business man come shake my hand
Show me numbers that i understand
Your my candle i'm burning your wick
Two sides comin' in quick 

Say goodbye when you see the sign
Now I'm crucified!
Crucifiy me

the ground is fertile and the grass is green
so many things to be seen
so many bands to be heard
just for once can i be ignored
