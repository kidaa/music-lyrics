H2O, The Slackers, Stubborn All Stars
Must respect
Hey Tim take it away my man. 

Well I heard they fly a confederate flag
Down at the state house
Got a gun to my head from the hand of a man
Down at the state house 
Well I reach for a dollar in the hole in my pocket
Down at the state house 
They said I got some rights and I really shouldn't knock it
Down at the state house 

What can we do [x7]

Broken bones, broken rules 
They can all be fixed oh yeah 
So let those who battle with the pen 
And the others with the fist its the gospel now 
The strong ones will be defiant with words that can convince
You can take this as rules but I'll take it as a dis 

Yeah!!! 

Well they wanna hold me with wrongful suspicion 
Down at the state house 
And I'm all bundled up in an awkward position
Down at the state house 
And they say its all part of a hundred year tradition
Down at the state house 
And I do feel they got a mental condition 
Down at the state house 

What can we do [x7]

Hey gettin' crazy watch me 
Was it you all along working for the CIA
Iran contra Panama
American casket parlet work it now, work it
Visions of light yes, visions of death no, visions gone astray oh yeah
Jump on that DC-10 my man oh and you fly away 

Ignore the weak ignore the poor 
Down at the state house 
They got a real good position for me on the floor... hell no 
Down at the state house 
They said your gonna make a real real nice world 
Down at the state house 
But they do not know the law not no at all
Down at the state house 

What can we do [x7]
