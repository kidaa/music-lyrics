Within the same school. The idea was that we'd later combine both styles,
unify the techniques.
But still, we were too young.
Too full of ignorant pride in our own succulent sorrow.

Oh no!!!
Some people live illegal
What you got you can't keep here
Oh no!!!
Some people live illegal
All their lives are led in evil  Oh, they rise a lot of evil 

Open the jails and set the men free
Well the devils and witches are looming on me
And the fighting and the robbing induce slavery
A decision of descention into insanity

Oh no!!!
Some people live illegal
What you got you can't keep here
Oh no!!!
Some people live illegal
All their lives are led in evil  Oh, they rise a lot of evil 

Humility will hold you and never let you go
To all my friends well, much gratitude
And to all the wicked, I've got my eyes on you
And everyone stands in confusion

Oh no!!!
Some people live illegal
What you got you can't keep here
Oh no!!!
Some people live illegal
All their lives are led in evil  Oh, they rise a lot of evil 

To do the job, you've got to prepare yourself to die.. die... die...

Put 'em up, put 'em in, run 'em out, run quicker

Quicker than any motherfucker that I know
Rack 'em up and stomp 'em wherever he'll go
Rancid pack, I'm a blast it
Blasted lyrics of elastic
With a 12 gauge double barrel lyric gun

Go... go ... go

Proclamation to the nihilist
Down to the propagandist
Take me off of that fucking list

Open the jails and set the men free
Well the devils and witches are looming on me
And the fighting and the robbing induce slavery
A decision of dissension into insanity

Oh no!!!
Some people live illegal
What you got you can't keep here
Oh no!!!
Some people live illegal
All their lives are led in evil  Oh, they rise a lot of evil 

Go... go... go...

Oh no!!!
Some people live illegal
What you got you can't keep here
Oh no!!!
Some people live illegal
All their lives are led in evil  Oh, they rise a lot of evil
