Set out to mislead
Sets out to murder
False appearance is everything to him
Is he good today, or is he evil
In a violent crazy spewing words of madness
It can go either way you never know
Conditioned to deceived and that's how he likes it
With all the guns going off who can say no to the guy
Who watch out, who's fucking nuts
'Cause Loki's playing tricks again
Loki's playing tricks again
Loki's playing tricks again
Loki's playing tricks again
