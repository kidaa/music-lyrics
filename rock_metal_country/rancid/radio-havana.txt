El Diablo is like a soundtrack
All concurrent playback
'57 chevy with the radio on
It's a sad song
That goes on and on
It's a fugitive of time Radio Havana
It's a fugitive of time Radio Havana
A friend that said you gotta make a choice
He's got the leather skin and the velvet voice
The New York Times read that it aint over yet
you can't forget, cause you'll never forget
It's a fugitive of time Radio Havana
It's a fugitive of time Radio Havana
Yeah i got it right...yeah i got it right  
Going down tongiht..going down tonight
Oh where'd you go..oh where'd you go
Going down below...going down below
El Diablo is like a soundtrack
All concurrent playback
'57 chevy with the radio on
It's a sad song
That goes on and on
