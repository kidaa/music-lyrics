Little Sammy was a punk rocker
you know his mother never understand him
went to his room and smashed his Billy Bragg record
didn't want him to hear that communist lecture

Little Sammy was a punk rocker
you know his mother tried to take him to war
Sammy now the war is over now we're at the wars end 

Little Sammy was a punk rocker
now it's time for you to leave home
