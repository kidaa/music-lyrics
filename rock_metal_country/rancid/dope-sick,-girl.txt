This song is about a girl
who has been off
she was dope sick

Dope sick girl hit and run
she took my money
87 dollars gone
now she's running 

How was i i to know
That girl could take my heart
everywhere she go
Dope sick girl a rig and a rid she got no freedom
Little deamon gonna hide inside she's gotta feed them 

How was i i to know
That girl could take my heart everywhere she go
Everywhere, everywhere she go 

Dope sick girl there she was at the methadone clinic
She drank a coup called it a base coat
She swore not to get back in it 

How was i i to know
That girl could take my heart everywhere she go 

Dope sick girl gotta rig and a ride to new york city
Gonna run away gonna watch it burn in the heart of new york city 

How was i i to know
That girl could take my heart everywhere she go
