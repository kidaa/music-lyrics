every city got an artery where the blood breaks down
an avenue or a boulevard and a boy who wears a crown
indigant live styles mplies simply lack of means
dogmatical authoritarians dictate the cities remains 

a promise
to go to heaven wont put salvation in sight 

Whirlwind is coming down on me 

when the factory shut down so did the place he lived
blood money for junk bonds by a white collar fugitive
all the tax free insentives ain't going to help him now
generations of job security gone out like the horse and plow 

a promise
to go to heaven won't put salvation in sight 

Whirlwind is coming down on me 

my old man worked his troubled life in a nowhere dead end
he drank the pain away i'll be damned if that's me having my dreams robbed
the working class carries a country that has been rotting inside for years
the rigs cuffed my old man in the front yard i saw through my eyes of tears
a promise to go to heaven wont put salvation in sight 

Whirlwind is coming down on me
