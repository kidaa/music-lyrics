On the cusp of an explosion
I answer with evil that's the way that I play it
Street Turks multiple contusions
I gnash spit
I grind my teeth
Got a gun and a knife
Staring back at you
No security force or vigilante's
overweight ego can dethrone me
Ostracized if not otherwise
Left to my own device you'll surly see
Got a gun and a knife
Staring back at you
Got a gun and a knife
Staring back at you
