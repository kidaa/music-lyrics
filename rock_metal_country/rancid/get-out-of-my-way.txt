Go ahead start causing trouble
Get outta my way get outta my way...
Don't want your lies and I don't want your  
I don't see any fun
In getting fucked up around this place
I played as much as you 

Get outta my way get outta my way 

Rich kid rich kid get outta my hair 

Get outta my way get outta my way 

I'll sing what I'll sing
I'll wear what I'll wear 

Get outta my way get outta my way 

I try to love mankind and I try to do what's right
But I can't do anything...

Get outta my way get outta my way

Go ahead start causing trouble
Get outta my way get outta my way...
Who do you think you are
Do you think you're some kinda cop
Why did you come along you're a fuckin' cop!

Kid get outta my way kid get outta my way
Kid get outta my way kid get outta my way [repeat]
Get out... of my way!
