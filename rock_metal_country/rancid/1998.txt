White Stones, Queens 1974 
Fathers talking shit
motherfucker slam the door
Hittin' the streets runnin' can I take this any more
In the reins of the trains I cuddle on the floor 

Well the park bench, door and
Sleeping in the rain 
Little kids sitting in the shooting gallery 
Set yourself up 
rom innocence to misery 
Oh if this is what you want not
the way of what they fucking say 

Hangin out with Sid yet again in the USA
Sidney Sidney in the USA 

Lower east side 1976
Who's got the dope and
who's turning tricks
Should I call a user all for a fix
Rippen off some lady just to avoid from gettin' sick 

But a life runs low when you got no where to go
What the fuck happens to your soul when your low 
Is he comin' over is he comin' home 
Oh momma's disappointed waiting by the phone 

Yeah!!! 

Hangin out with Sid yet again in the USA
Sidney Sidney in the USA 

Same fuckin' shit 1998 
Lifting bait, and by the motherfuckers that he hates
Hit some fucking people by the Kennedy strait
Who's got the bag gonna seal his fate 

Well the park bench, door and
Sleeping here for free
Little kids sitting in the shooting gallery
Set yourself up for manifested misery
Well this is what you want
not the way they fucking say 

Hangin out with Sid yet again in the USA
Sidney Sidney in the USA
