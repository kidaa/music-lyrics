Solidarity love and unity
Set me free with a bullet and a gun

You said it was nothing
I knew it was something
It was no surprisin' i saw you cryin 

About you
Said what went wrong
About you
Said you can't go on
About you
Said it's a long time gone
About you
Said your life's too long 

Solidarity love and unity
Set me free with a bullet and a gun

Didn't see it coming
Your fears went hunting
9 millimeter
stops you running

About you
Now you're long time gone
About you
So what went wrong 

Solidarity love and unity
Set me free with a bullet and a gun
