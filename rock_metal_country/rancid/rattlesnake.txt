For weeks your falling, that's my darling
Hear them calling drawing you back
Sawing you in two, using me, using you
What can you do
Watch out Mack, here's a rat
Falling off the track, fade out black
Black in feedback, hit the flashback
Don't you know we hate that
Your a rattlesnake
And your full of shit
Your a rattlesnake
Your a rattlesnake
Fuck that shit, I don't wanna hear it
You can't bare it when we blare it
I hate your band, you understand
You got no passion, it's all fashion
Well you come you can, come come true
Calm down, flames red or blue
You don't know, you got no clue
I see through
Your a rattlesnake
And your full of shit
I fuckin hate you
Your a rattlesnake
You talk that shit about our crew, we hate you
You said you know us, we don't know you
You Jump on the next bandwagon
What's the next fan in, I heard you braggin
But you ain't shit, you get frustrated
We never hesitated to call you a Charlatan
Cause we hate you
Your a rattlesnake
And your full of shit
I fuckin hate you
Your a rattlesnake
Your a rattlesnake
And your full of shit
and I hate you
Your a rattlesnake
