Midnight
I know where i am
That's right
I know where i'm going
Shut down
Vacant city ghost town
Tensions rising
Kick kick kick the door in
Lock lock lock around
And affairs affairs of the nation 

When the presure came down
Sustain autority

Midnight
I know i can
That's right
I ain't broken
Shut down
Vacant city ghost town
Tensions rising
Kick kick kick the door in
Lock lock lock around
And affairs of the nation

When the presure came down
Sustain autority
