Listen to 
The magic man 
An abracaca 
Dabra your life's 
In cinerama 

Listen to 
The magic man 
A bing bang 
A ding dang 
And oops 

Roll on 
Round   round 
On   on 
Up   down 
You are in wonderland 
Listen to the magic man 

Listen to 
The magic man 
Got a trick 
That's so slick 
Disappears just quick as a lick 

Listen to 
The magic man 
A bing bong 
A ping pong 
And you are off to Hong Kong 

Roll on 
Round   round 
On   on 
Up   down 
You are in Wonderland 
Listen to the magic man 

The wonders 
The colours 
The others 
You're leaving them behind 
Bye bye 
Oh my, my magic man 
Flish, flash fly 
You are making me 

Roll on
