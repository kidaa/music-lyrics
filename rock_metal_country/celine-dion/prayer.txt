Can we touch the soul of heaven
Can we unite a sacred lesson
Every child creates a skylight of beauty 
Can you hear cathedrals falling
All the universe is calling
Cry a single cello from your heart 
Since the world has lost her way
Loneliness journey endlessly
Yet the promised chance remains
Gifts of what could be
So let the children remember the sun
Let them dance let them soar
For their lives have begun 
Let the children engender the rain
As the river runs through fields 
Forever subsiding their pain
Prayer 
Every voice along the shoreline
Standing still within time
Spinning unresolved the walking
As each season passes
Through wonderland and looking glasses
The secret garden shires beckon's you
Gentle flower, don't fade away
Sweet innocence they're harvesting
In the faith of golden dreams
Where one love lives eternally 
Let the children remember the sun
Let them dance let them soar
For their lives have begun 
Let the children engender the rain
As the river runs through fields 
Forever subsiding their pain
Prayer 
Prayer
Prayer 
Let the children bring the light
They are the truth of spirit in flight 
Yes the children engender the rain
As the river runs through life
Healing their pain 
You can trust with your heart but for time
Sweet angels, conceive you have
Forever and always believed Prayer 
Prayer
Prayer
Prayer
