A million stars light
This beautiful night
This is not a night to die
Let me sing and dance
Beneath the sky
I have such love to give...to give
I want a chance to live

Live
For the one I love
Love
As no one has loved
Give
Asking nothing in return

Free free to find my way
Free to have my say
Free to see the day

Live like I used to be
Like wild but free
For the life in me

Live
For the one I love
Love
As no one has loved
Give
Asking nothing in return

This world tears us apart
We're still together in my heart
I want the world to hear my cry
Even if I have to die
Love will not die
Love will change the world

Live
For the one I love
Love
As no one has loved
Give
Asking nothing in return

And love until love wears  me away
I'll die and I know my love will stay
And I'll know I know my love will stay
