John E. McCollum/Len Doolin
I've never seen blue eyes filled with so much love
I never thought I'd find out what I found in your touch
Someone up there must like me 'cause I'm
Lookin' at the proof there's no doubt about it
Heaven sent me you
Heaven sent me you to make my life complete
An angel from above to watch over me
What makes it even better
Is you feel the same way too
There's no doubt about it Heaven sent me you
Every moment that we share will live forever in my mind
Every memory that we make
Are sure to outlast time
I know when I hold you close I'm holdin'
Love that's true
There's no doubt about it
Heaven sent me you
Heaven sent me you to make my life complete
An angel from above to watch over me
What makes it even better
Is you feel the same way too
There's no doubt about it Heaven sent me you
There's no doubt about it Heaven sent me you
