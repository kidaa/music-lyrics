Johnny McRae/Steve Clark
Let me tell you 'bout a lady that I know
Who stood tall and proud beside me
Down many a dead end road
Never asking more than I could give
And never once complaining
About the way we had to live
Well she never showed a sign of losing hope
Though a million dreams and promises
Have all gone up in smoke
She hides her disappointment out of love
And if I laid the whole world at her feet
It wouldn't be enough
She's the rock I lean on through it all
Everytime I stumble
Everytime I fall
And though she's never shown it
I've known it from the start
Everytime I fall it breaks her heart
Everytime I fall
It breaks her heart
Now let me tell you about the million silent tears
I've found hidden on her pillow
In the mornings through the years
Somehow I'm still a hero in her eyes
But to tell the truth
I can't give you one good reason why
She's the rock I lean on through it all
Everytime I stumble
Everytime I fall
And though she's never shown it
I've known it from the start
Everytime I fall it breaks her heart
Everytime I fall
It breaks her heart
