I been down on my luck
I been down on my knees
Well I been downtown
And I been down on the farm
I can't be satisfied
But I'm gonna have to find
A way to kick back and
Take off the edge
Now there's a little gal I know
Just south of Tupelo
Her hair is dark and her legs are long and tan
She rubs my back just right
Till way up in the night
She knows how to
Take off the edge
I've been laid up with the flu
Laid off a time or two
I've been uptight
And I've been up a creek
I'm gonna take my bamboo pole
And head out to the fishing hole
Don't you know it helps to
Take off the edge
Now there's a little gal I know
Just south of Tupelo
Her hair is dark and her legs are long and tan
She rubs my back just right
Till way up in the night
She knows how to
Take off the edge
Now it's morning once again
Oh, Lord I just punched in
And I can't hardly wait till quitting time
Gonna get that big brown jug
All I need is a little slug
Just another way to
Takin' off the edge
Now there's a little gal I know
Just south of Tupelo
Her hair is dark and her legs are long and tan
She rubs my back just right
Till way up in the night
Well she knows how to
Take off the edge
Oh she sure knows how to
Take off the edge
