Richard Fagan/Steve O'Brien
All week long I been workin' that nine to five
Dreamin' in color but livin' in black and white
Monday to Friday ain't nothing but shades of gray
But tonight I'm gonna party
All my blue collar blues away
I'm a paint the town redneck when I get my paycheck
You ought to see my Chevy van go
Headin' for the bright lights, I'll be painting all night
I'm a honky tonkin' Michelangelo
Picasso with a pool stick
Too loose with a two step
Rollin' till my green's all gone
I'm a paint the town redneck
Honey wanna come along
We can get there early
And draw us a pitcher of beer
Do a little dancin' and make the blues disappear
Brushin' up against each other in the neon light
You can be my Mona Lisa and I'll make you smile tonight
I'm a paint the town redneck when I get my paycheck
You ought to see my Chevy van go
Headin' for the bright lights, I'll be painting all night
I'm a honky tonkin' Michelangelo
Picasso with a pool stick
Too loose with a two step
Rollin' till my green's all gone
I'm a paint the town redneck
Honey wanna come along
I'm a paint the town redneck
Honey wanna come along
