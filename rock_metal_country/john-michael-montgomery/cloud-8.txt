I hear 'em laughing on cloud 9
In a world so happy just above mine
No one's leaving like you left me
They got each other got all they need, but
Here on cloud 8
A lotta nothing's going on
I'm just drifting day to day
Out here on my own
While up on cloud 9
I hear 'em party all the time
They don't hear my heart break
Down here on cloud 8
We almost made it up where they are
But losing your love
Brought me down hard
Now I'm just hanging, just getting by
Where expectations aren't that high, but
Here on cloud 8
A lotta nothing's going on
I'm just drifting day to day
Out here on my own
While up on cloud 9
I hear 'em party all the time
They don't hear my heart break
Down here on cloud 8
While up on cloud 9
I hear 'em party all the time
They don't hear my heart break
Down here on cloud 8
They don't hear my heart break
Down here on cloud 8
