Jimmy Stewart/George Teren
Got some cash in my pocket
And it's burning a hole
Got the boss on my back
And it's getting real old
This week's been hell
But I'll party it out of my mind
From Friday at five
Till Sunday at closing time
Ain't a punching no clock
Ain't a making no plans
Need a girl on my arm
And a beer in my hands
I'm tight as drum
But I'm gonna cut loose and unwind
From Friday at five
Till Sunday at closing time
Got some pretty little women waiting on me
To shake up this sleepy old town
That's one job I take seriously
I wouldn't dream of letting them down
Got a call from my ex
And she's asking for more
I'm late with the rent
And the wolf's at the door
But thats gonna be
The furthest thing from my mind
From Friday at five
Till Sunday at closing time
Got some pretty little women waiting on me
To shake up this sleepy old town
That's one job I take seriously
I wouldn't dream of letting them down
It might take me all week
To get back on my feet
But I know I'll be alright
From Friday at five
Till Sunday at closing time
From Friday at five
Till Sunday at closing time
