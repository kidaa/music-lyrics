Jess Brown/Jim Denton
I don't have a lot to show
For these years of hard work
If you look at what I own
Still she's always telling me
To hold on to my dreams
Even when my hope is gone
Some may say that dreaming's just for fools
And there are times I thought that might be true
But she thinks I could rope the moon
In her eyes there is nothing I can't do
When I think it's out of reach
She's the reason I still try
She thinks I could rope the moon
When I look at the sky
But can't see through the clouds
She shows me the brightest stars
If I think of coming back
'Cause I'm having my doubts
She tells me I've come so far
Nothing in this world comes easily
But I can't lose with her right next to me
'Cause she thinks I could rope the moon
In her eyes there is nothing I can't do
When I think it's out of reach
She's the reason I still try
She thinks I could rope the moon
Oh she thinks I could rope the moon
