Monty Holmes/Michael Huffman/Donny Kees
I knew I'd found my life's callin'
When you spoke my name
From that moment on, the reason I was born
Became so very plain
Now my heart and soul's, one and only goal
Is to bring you happiness
Lovin' you, is what I do the best
Some may live to change the world
And that's alright with me
My hat's off to those chosen few
Who rewrite history
But just to make you smile
That is how I'll measure my success
'Cause lovin' you is what I do the best
It's a lucky man who understands
Where his true talents lie
And the first time I held you
I realized
That there's one thing I do better
Than all the rest
Lovin' you is what I do the best
Lovin' you is what I do the best
