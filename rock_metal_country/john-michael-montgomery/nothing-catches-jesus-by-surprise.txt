Catching Babe Ruth catching Roger Marist
The way you caught my eye in Paris, Tennisee.
Fell in seduction; Well I'm seduced.
You sell a war then we sell the truth.  
It's the truth.
So baby just close your eyes nothing catches Jesus by surprise
Confusin' love for heated passion,
Got what I want but no satisfaction.
Aint it funny how things can change.  
We're amazed how they stay the same.
So baby just close your eyes nothing catches Jesus by surprise
[musical interlude]
You look so pretty when you smile.
I haven't seen that for a while.
Talk about trouble, we've had our share.
It's a wonder we're still here.
I don't know why I make you cry
It's a part of me I don't like at all.
So baby just close your eyes nothing catches Jesus by surprise
Baby just close your eyes nothing catches Jesus by surprise
