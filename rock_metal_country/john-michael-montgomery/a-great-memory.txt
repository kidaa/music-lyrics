Dean Dillon/Trey Bruce
I'm not one to take chances
I've always played it safe
But girl I've been out on a limb
Since I saw your smiling face
I feel like I'm walking a tightrope
When I'm out walking with you
It's a dangerous liason
I've got my heart into
'Cause we're not a sure thing
Too soon to tell if we're the real thing
But this time it's worth taking a chance
On you and me
But if doesn't work out
Should you decide to walk out
Well that's all right with me
'Cause girl I know you'd be
A great memory
Some folks would die for this moment
But I've lived for this moment in time
The love you bring may be a fleeting thing
But oh right now it's mine
If I should wind up lonely
Well I won't mind being alone
'Cause if it works out that you leave me
Least I'll have you to look back on
'Cause we're not a sure thing
Too soon to tell if we're the real thing
But this time it's worth taking a chance
On you and me
But if doesn't work out
Should you decide to walk out
Well that's all right with me
'Cause girl I know you'd be
A great memory
Yeah that's all right with me
'Cause girl I know you'd be
A great memory
