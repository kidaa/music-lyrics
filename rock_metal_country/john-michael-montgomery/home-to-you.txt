John Michael Montgomery 
Verse 1. 
I get up and battle the day 
Things don't always go my way 
It might rain but that's okay 
I get to come home to you 
Verse 2. 
Sometimes life may get me down 
And I get tired of getting kicked around 
I feel lost in this maddening crowd 
But I get to come home to you 
Chorus: 
You are my best friend 
And you are where my heart is 
And I know at the day's end 
I get to come home to you 
Verse 3. 
Hanging out in our old sweatshirts 
You let me complain about a hard day's work 
I don't know what I did to deserve 
To get to come home to you 
Repeat Chorus 2 times 
Ending: 
Yes I get to come home to you 
Oh I love coming home to you
