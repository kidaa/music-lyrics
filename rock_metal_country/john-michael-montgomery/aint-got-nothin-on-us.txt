Wendell Mobley/Jim Robinson
Well they say the Grand Canyon is a sight to see
But it's just a big ditch next to you and me
Ooo baby ain't got nothing on us
There's earth shaking power in the space shuttle
Well I feel that every time we cuddle
Ooo baby ain't got nothing on us
I stop I stare
Sometimes I can't believe my eyes
My jaw just drops
Our love has got me mesmerized
I hear there's seven wonders in this big old world
Well don't they know that number 8 you and me girl
Ooo baby ain't got nothing on us
They stop they stare
Sometimes they can't believe their eyes
Their jaws just drop
Our love has got them mesmerized
Well I've read about Romeo and Juliet
Wish I could tell Shakespeare I ain't impressed
Ooo baby ain't got nothing on us
I'm telling you baby
Ain't got nothing on us
