Steve Seskin/Mark D. Sanders
If you've got faith
And you believe in what you're living for
You can stand your ground when the devil's at your door
And a little hope can help you when the road is getting rough
But there's nothing quite like life if you've got love
If you've got love you can move a mountain
A little bit further down the line
You can do it all at once or one rock at a time
You can turn an ordinary picture into a priceless work of art
It's what you can do if you've got love in your heart
Now there's nothing like a real good friend
To tell your troubles to
But there's just so much a real good friend can do
'Cause it takes another's touch to chase the darkest blues away
If you've got love you've got what it takes
If you've got love you can move a mountain
A little bit further down the line
You can do it all at once or one rock at a time
You can turn an ordinary picture into a priceless work of art
It's what you can do if you've got love in your heart
If you've got love you can move a mountain
A little bit further down the line
You can do it all at once or one rock at a time
You can turn an ordinary picture into a priceless work of art
It's what you can do if you've got love in your heart
It's what you can do if you've got love in your heart
If you've got love you can move a mountain
Further down the line
You can do it all at once or one rock at a time
You can turn a picture into a priceless work of art...
