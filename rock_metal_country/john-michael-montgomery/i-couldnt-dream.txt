When we're this close I can almost
Hear your heart beat
As you softly breathe lyin' here with me
Your skin's like a canvas
Being painted by the moonbeams
Truly a masterpiece
To you it comes naturally
I couldn't dream a love better than this
Could never imagine such a kiss
Or the way your body feels in my arms
Old Mister Sandman I'll resist
'Cause if I were to sleep look at all I'd miss
I couldn't dream a love better than this
It's getting late
But I don't want to close my eyes
I don't care about the time
Or the world outside
We're movin' to the music playin' in our minds
The mood's just right for staying up all night
I couldn't dream a love better than this
Could never imagine such a kiss
Or the way your body feels in my arms
Old Mister Sandman I'll resist
'Cause if I were to sleep look at all I'd miss
I couldn't dream a love better than this
I've had my fantasies
But none compare to reality
I couldn't dream a love better than this
Could never imagine such a kiss
Or the way your body feels in my arms
Old Mister Sandman I'll resist
'Cause if I were to sleep look at all I'd miss
I couldn't dream
I couldn't dream a love better than this
I can't get no sleep
I couldn't dream a love better than this
