David Wills/Rick West/James Dean Hicks
Packed an old cane pole
Crossed the shoulder through the woods
To the fishing hole
I tried to keep up the best I could
He answered with love
All the questions of his little man
Daddy taught me about life
In words I could understand
You gotta roll up your sleeves
Put your back into your work son
Always believe in the good Lord's way
You gotta hold your mouth right
When your going for the big one
Once you get a line on love
Don't let it get away
Driving my old car
That we worked on after school
He's a football star
And his daddy's a proud old fool
It's a brand new world
Full of girls and teenage dreams
When he asks for my advice
The answer's still the same
You gotta roll up your sleeves
Put your back into your work son
Always believe in the good Lord's way
You gotta hold your mouth right
When your going for the big one
Once you get a line on love
Don't let it get away
Once you get a line on love
Don't let it get away
