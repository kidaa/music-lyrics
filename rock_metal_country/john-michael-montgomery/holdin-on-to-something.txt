There's a little girl
Wanna make her mine
What she wants I don't know
If red means stop
An' green means go
Her light is always yellow
I'm wrapped around her finger
She's slipping through my hands
Every time I think I got her
I gotta think again...I'm
Holdin' on to something
That keeps letting me go
Just a whole lotta heartache
At the end of my rope
I fall a little harder every time I drop
But I keep reaching 'cause I can't stop
Holdin' on to something that keeps letting me go
She calls me on the phone
Says she's all alone
Felling kinda lonely
Says she can't wait
So don't be late
I promise her I won't be
Ten minutes later I'm standing at her door
She's saying, ";Never mind, I ain't lonely anymore";...I'm
Holdin' on to something
That keeps letting me go
Just a whole lotta heartache
At the end of my rope
I fall a little harder every time I drop
But I keep reaching 'cause I can't stop
Holdin' on to something that keeps letting me go
I fall a little harder every time I drop
But I keep reaching 'cause I can't stop
Holdin' on to something that keeps letting me go
Just a whole lotta heartache
At the end of my rope
Holdin' on to something
That keeps letting me go
