Randy Archer/Freddy Weller
She's not much for thrills
And says things with fancy frills
Don't turn her on
She seems so content working hard
To make our house a home
She's steady as a rock
Standing by me
Even when I don't succeed
Lord I wish I could afford
The things she swears
She don't really need
She don't need a band to dance
It don't take wings for her fly
Our love's gonna grow
If there ain't much do si do
It's still gonna be alright
We make such pretty music
That you can tell at just a glance
When I take the notion
She seconds that emotion
She don't need a band to dance
She didn't say a thing
When we had to pawn the ring
To pay the rent
What I make in overtime
Stacked against the bills
Don't make a dent
Just when I think I let her down
And failed to be the man I oughta be
She still sees the bright side
Of everything including me
She don't need a band to dance
It don't take wings for her fly
Our love's gonna grow
If there ain't much do si do
It's still gonna be alright
We make such pretty music
That you can tell at just a glance
When I take the notion
She seconds that emotion
She don't need a band to dance
She don't need a band to dance
