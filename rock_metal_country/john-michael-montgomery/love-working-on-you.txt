Jim Collins/Craig Wiseman
You woke up this morning
Changes were taking place
You looked in the mirror
A smile was all over your face
'Cause out of nowhere
Someone was there
Who dared to climb
Those walls you made
It's exciting, a little frightening
But girl don't you be afraid
That's just the love working
Love working on you
That's just the love working
Working on pulling you through
Can't even remember
All the sorrow that you left behind
It's a brand new day
There's a bright new way
And your tears have turned into wine
You never forget
When your eyes met
Or just how clearly you could see
Where the turns are deep in your heart
That lead you to believe
That's just the love working
Love working on you
That's just the love working
Working on pulling you through
All of the while you felt forsaken
And all of the while
Love's been waiting, waiting
Suddenly you see how it could be
If we all only felt this way
And for a while girl you can see this world
Looking through the eyes of fate
That's just the love working
Love working on you
That's just the love working
Working on pulling you through
That's just the love working
Love working on you
That's just the love working
Working on pulling you through
That's just the love working on you
That's just the love working
Working on pulling you through
