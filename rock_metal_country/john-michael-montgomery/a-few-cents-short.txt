John Michael Montgomery
Looking for spare change
To put gas in my car
But what I've found
Won't get me very far
Seems lately the low times
Have hit me pretty hard
'Cause I'm a few cents short
From getting to where you are
I'm a few cents short
Of holding you in my arms
And a few cents short
Of keeping us from falling apart
Ain't it funny how the money
Can change our lives
'Cause I'm a few cents short
From losing you tonight
So I walked to a pay phone down the road
But a few dimes and a nickel is all I had
The operator wants more money
To place my call
But I'm a few cents short
If that don't beat it all
I'm a few cents short
Of holding you in my arms
And a few cents short
Of keeping us from falling apart
Ain't it funny how the money
Can change our lives
'Cause I'm a few cents short
From losing you tonight
I'm a few cents short
Of holding you in my arms
And a few cents short
Of keeping us from falling apart
Sure is funny how the money
Can change our lives
'Cause I'm a few cents short
From losing you tonight
Yes I'm a few cents short
And I'll be losing you tonight
