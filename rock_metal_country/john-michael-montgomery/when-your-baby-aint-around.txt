Stan Munsey Jr./Bob Alan
I don't recall the icebox ever humming quite so loud
That clock upon the wall, sounding like a crowd
My that dog is restless
He don't ever settle down
Now ain't it strange what occupies your mind
When your baby ain't around
When your baby ain't around
I swear the moon and stars won't shine
And nights get longer all the time
I'm so lonesome missing you
If you wanna know the truth
I never thought I'd ever be this down
That's all my body's got a mind to do
Now that my baby ain't around
I don't recall this bedroom ever being quite so large
Or this big old mattress ever sleeping quite so hard
My the days come early
When your sleep is less than sound
Dreams don't seem to matter much at all
When your baby ain't around
When your baby ain't around
I swear the moon and stars won't shine
And nights get longer all the time
I'm so lonesome missing you
If you wanna know the truth
I never thought I'd ever be this down
That's all my body's got a mind to do
Now that my baby ain't around
When your baby ain't around
I swear the moon and stars won't shine
And nights get longer all the time
I'm so lonesome missing you
If you wanna know the truth
I never thought I'd ever be this down
That's all my body's got a mind to do
Now that my baby ain't around
Well, that's all my body's got a mind to do
Now that my baby ain't around
Now that my baby ain't around
Now that my baby ain't around
Now that my baby ain't around
My baby baby ain't around
Now that my baby ain't around
