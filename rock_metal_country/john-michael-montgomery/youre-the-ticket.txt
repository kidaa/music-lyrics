I wanna be the one sittin' next to you
On your mama's front porch swing
Feel like the guy that gets the girl
On a forty-foot silver screen
I wanna steal a kiss when we stop
At the top of a great big ferris wheel
I wanna know how good that feels
I wanna be a red Corvette
Rolling down a two-lane road
With the top rolled back and no speed limit
I wanna be a midnight plane
Headin' down to Key Biscayne
Livin' life and lovin' every minute
And you're the ticket
I wanna be the kid in the candy store
With a new twenty dollar bill
Wanna walk in the sand holdn' your hand
With nothin' but time to kill
Roll the dice when I need a seven
And know that I can't lose
Girl you make every dream come true
I wanna be a red Corvette
Rolling down a two-lane road
With the top rolled back and no speed limit
I wanna be a midnight plane
Headin' down to Key Biscayne
Livin' life and lovin' every minute
And you're the ticket
I wanna be a red Corvette
Rolling down a two-lane road
With the top rolled back and no speed limit
I wanna be a midnight plane
Headin' down to Key Biscayne
Livin' life and lovin' every minute
I said a red Corvette
Rolling down a two-lane road
With the top rolled back and no speed limit
I wanna be a midnight plane
Headin' down to Key Biscayne
Livin' life and lovin' every minute
And you're the ticket
