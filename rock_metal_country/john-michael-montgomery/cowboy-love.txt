Bill Douglas/Jeff Wood
You drive a baby blue Beamer
I drive a pickup truck
I'm a member of the good ol' boys
You're a member of the Country Club
You keep turnin' me down when I ask you out
But I ain't givin' up
I'm gonna show you darlin' a little cowboy love
Let me broaden your horizons
Teach you 'bout the finer things in life
Like some late night horseback ridin'
Sippin' on some southern homemade wine
If a little two steppin', star gazin', breathtakin', lovemakin'
Is what your dreamin' of
Then let me show you darlin' a little cowboy love
You need a little adventure
To ignite your world
I can picture you in cowboy boots
I can picture you a country girl
Once you give me a try then you'll know why
You can't get enough
So let me show you darlin' a little cowboy love
Let me broaden your horizons
Teach you 'bout the finer things in life
Like some late night horseback ridin'
Sippin' on some southern homemade wine
If a little two steppin', star gazin', breathtakin', lovemakin'
Is what your dreamin' of
Then let me show you darlin' a little cowboy love
Underneath the midnight moonlight
Cuddled up real tight
Cozied down by a fire
Listenin' to some George Strait, George Jones
Country love songs you'll change your mind
Well let me broaden your horizons
Teach you 'bout the finer things in life
Like some late night horseback ridin'
Sippin' on some southern homemade wine
If a little two steppin', star gazin', breathtakin', lovemakin'
Is what your dreamin' of
Then let me show you darlin' a little cowboy love
Let me show you darlin' a little cowboy love
