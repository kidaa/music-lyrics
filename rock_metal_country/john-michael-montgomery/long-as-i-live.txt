Rick Bowles/Will Robinson
The world's been spinning 'round since time began
An' when it stops, it's out of my hands
So I could swear forever for all it's worth
Or give you every day I have on Earth
Long as I live
Long as I breathe
With every heartbeat
I'll need you near me
I won't leave you behind
'Til the Lord says it's time to go with him
I'm yours long as I live
No matter if there's mountains you can't move
Or harder times then you thought you'd go through
And the weight of your world's too much to bear
Just remember I'll always be there
Long as I live
Long as I breathe
With every heartbeat
I'll need you near me
I won't leave you behind
'Til the Lord says it's time to go with him
I'm yours long as I live
The moon and stars aren't mine to give
Neither is eternity
But I'll give you a promise tonight
That I can keep
Long as I live
Long as I breathe
With every heartbeat
I'll need you near me
I won't leave you behind
'Til the Lord says it's time to go with him
I'm yours long as I live
I'm yours long as I live
