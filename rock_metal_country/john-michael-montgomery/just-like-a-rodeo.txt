Roger Brown/Tommy Conners
Boots in the stirrups out of the gate trying to hold the reins
Praying that I can just sit tight, man this love is strange
Up like a rocket spinning 'round like a top
My strength is fading fast
I should have known when I climbed on
My next breath could be my last
Somedays I'm in the saddle
Somedays I get thrown
Somedays I hold on for dear life
This love is sure 'nough just like a rodeo
Eight short seconds lasts a long long time
My life flashed before my eyes
Ain't never been bucked like this before
But I got to thank you for the ride
Somedays I'm in the saddle
Somedays I get thrown
Somedays I hold on for dear life
This love is sure 'nough just like a rodeo
Somedays I'm in the saddle
Somedays I get thrown
Somedays I hold on for dear life
This love is sure 'nough 
Somedays I'm in the saddle
Somedays I get thrown
Somedays I hold on for dear life
This love is sure 'nough just like a rodeo
Just like a rodeo
