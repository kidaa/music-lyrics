John Michael Montgomery/David Lee/Johnny Park/Elbert West
I've crashed and burned my old Firebird
And walked away without a scratch
And I've had my share of backwoods barroom brawls
Been kicked and cussed and busted up
But it was nothin' I couldn't patch
With a Band-Aid or a shot of alcohol
But this one's gonna leave a mark
One that time won't heal
Her good-bye cut like a knife
Right through this man of steel
Thought that I was tough enough
I could just shake it off
But even when I pretend it doesn't hurt at all
I know deep down in my heart
This one's gonna leave a mark
Lovers came and went but never made a dent
But none were quite like her
I was a fool to not beg her to stay
Filled with pride I just stood by
And never said one word
But I knew the moment that she walked away
This one's gonna leave a mark
One that time won't heal
Her good-bye cut like a knife
Right through this man of steel
Thought that I was tought enough
I could just shake it off
But even when I pretend it doesn't hurt at all
I know deep down in my heart
This one's gonna leave a mark
Thought I was Superman
With a heart of stone and I couldn't feel
Now here I am
Standing all alone and here's the deal
This one's gonna leave a mark
One that time won't heal
Her good-bye cut like a knife
Right through this man of steel
Thought that I was tought enough
I could just shake it off
But even when I pretend it doesn't hurt at all
I know deep down in my heart
This one's gonna leave a mark
I've crashed and burned my old Firebird
And walked away without a scratch
