Nettie Musick/Tony Ramey
Well I don't wanna hear last call
And I don't wanna look at the clock on the wall
Let's lose track of time while we're dancing this close
And I don't really care if no one's around
We can just stay right here until the moon goes down
If it were left up to me, I would never let go
But if this is a dream then I don't wanna wake up
And see the sun shine again
As long as you're in my arms
I don't want this song to end
Let me look in your eyes and count the stars
Let me hold you tight next to my heart
And I'll whisper I love you for the rest of my life
Let's make believe the music plays
For just you and me could make the world go away
In perfect time you will always be mine
But if this is a dream then I don't wanna wake up
And see the sun shine again
As long as you're in my arms
I don't want this song to end
Yeah if this is a dream then I don't wanna wake up
And see the sun shining in
As long as you're in my arms
I don't want this song to end
Now if you're in my arms
I don't want this song to end
