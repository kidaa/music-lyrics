I know he gave you every reason
To lose your faith in love
Give me the chace I'll find the pieces
To a heart that's given up
You say there's nothing I can do
But no one's ever too far gone
It's a heartache talking when
You say you'll never love again
And I can prove you wrong
I can prove you wrong
I know I can make you see
That you're right where you belong
When you're right here with me
If I could wrap these arms around you
You won't even know he's gone
But if you're still afraid
Love always ends that way
I can prove you wrong
I can show you what I'm saying
Is so much more than empty words
And if you want me here I'm staying
But I'll walk away if you prefer
A broken heart takes time to heal
And right now yours is not that strong
You say there's no one left for you
But if you want me to
I can prove you wrong
I can prove you wrong
I know I can make you see
That you're right where you belong
When you're right here with me
If I could wrap these arms around you
You won't even know he's gone
But if you're still afraid
Love always ends that way
I can prove you wrong
But if you're still afraid
Love always ends that way
I can prove you wrong
