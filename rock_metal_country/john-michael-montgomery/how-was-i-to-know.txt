Blair Daly/Will Rambeaux
Well I hoped and I prayed, I loved you from afar
I cried, and I dreamed, wished on every star
But nothin' I'd do got me closer to you
So I locked all my feelings inside
Then one night across a crowded room
You looked my way, your eyes held something new
You walked right up to me and smiled tenderly
And your words came as such a surprise
Well how was I to know
You never let it show
What a beauty like you might see
In a poor boy like me
How could I have seen
You walk out of my dreams
Shine your light on my sleepin' heart
And into my soul
How was I to know
You took my hand and led me out the door
We talked and we laughed
'Bout all the times before
When two lonely people so much in love
Passed like ships in the night
Well how was I to know
You never let it show
What a beauty like you might see
In a poor boy like me
How could I have seen
You walk out of my dreams
Shine your light on my sleepin' heart
And into my soul
How was I to know
How could I have seen
You walk out of my dreams
Shine your light on my sleepin' heart
And into my soul
How was I
How was I to know
Oooh
Oooh
Ooooooooh Oh Oh
