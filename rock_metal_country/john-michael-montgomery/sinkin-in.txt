I've been blown away, I've been swept off my feet
Lost at love because I wasn't ready
So it's safe to say, I've got just what I need
Fallin' for you was so slow and steady
Love is sinkin' in, bit by bit
Drop by drop, please don't stop
'Til my heart is overflowing
Can't help, thinkin' this, is the one
And from the way it's goin'
This time it's deeper than it's ever been
When two people care, and they just take their time
Love can be a whole lot more than magic
When you're in my arms, and you whisper
You're mine
I can't believe just how good I have it
Love is sinkin' in, bit by bit
Drop by drop, please don't stop
'Til my heart is overflowing
Can't help, thinkin' this, is the one
And from the way it's goin'
This time it's deeper than it's ever been
