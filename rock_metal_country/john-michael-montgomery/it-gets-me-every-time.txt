A short red dress don't turn my head
At least that's true unless it's you that's wearin' it
Glamour girls, high heels and pearls
They're a dime a dozen in this world
But let me tell you
When I see you I go crazy
There's just something about you baby
Can't help myself you drive me out of my mind
Can't explain there's no use tryin'
Plain as day there's no denyin'
What you've got, it gets me every time
Don't want no part of no fancy car
All I need's a way to get me where you are
Some folks dream of the finer things
But I dream of you 'cause there's nothin' finer to me
Let me tell you
When I see you I go crazy
There's just something about you baby
Can't help myself you drive me out of my mind
Can't explain there's no use tryin'
Plain as day there's no denyin'
What you've got, it gets me every time
There's a lot of things that can tempt a man to fall
But girl to me they don't mean nothin' at all
No no no no
Let me tell you
When I see you I go crazy
There's just something about you baby
Can't help myself you drive me out of my mind
Can't explain there's no use tryin'
Plain as day there's no denyin'
What you've got, it gets me every time
Yeah, what you've got, it gets me every time
Girl, what you've got, it gets me every time
