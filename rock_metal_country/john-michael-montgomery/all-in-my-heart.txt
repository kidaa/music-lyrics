I sit here tonight
And look in your eyes
For that old familiar flame
That love that burns
Makes my wolrd turn
Two hearts beating the same
Is it all in my mind
Or is it harder to find
I feel like I'm in the dark
I thought it was real
But I'm starting to feel
Like it must be all in my heart
I'm a fool for believing
But I just keep dreaming
While we just keep drifting apart
Trying to make something
Where there's really nothing
I guess it's all in my heart
I keep telling myself
There's something else
I could do
To find that spark
But wherever it lies
It's not in your eyes
I guess it's all in my heart
I'm a fool for believing
But I just keep dreaming
While we just keep drifting apart
Trying to make something
Where there's really nothing
I guess it's all in my heart
Just trying to make something
Where there's really nothing
I guess it's all in my heart
