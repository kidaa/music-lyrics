J.B. Rudd/Vip Vipperman
He's got lucky arms
He gets to hold her
The way I know I never will again
They're dancing close
With her head on his shoulder
Lucky arms, lucky heart, lucky him
They don't see me standing in these shadows
She don't know how bad my heart still aches
He's holding on to everything I let go
Sure is making good off my mistakes
He's got lucky arms
He gets to hold her
The way I know I never will again
They're dancing close
With her head on his shoulder
Lucky arms, lucky heart, lucky him
Before too long the music will stop playing
He'll take her hand and then he'll take her home
And I can just imagine what he's saying
The way he's smiling I can tell he knows
He's got lucky arms
He gets to hold her
The way I know I never will again
They're dancing close
With her head on his shoulder
Lucky arms, lucky heart, lucky him
Lucky arms, lucky heart
He ought to thank his lucky stars
Lucky arms, lucky heart, lucky him
