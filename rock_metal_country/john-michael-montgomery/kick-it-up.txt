Well I work six days out of seven
Waiting all week for Saturday night
Going out to neon heaven
Punch the clock on party time
Jamming this old pickup across the county line
Ain't it good to be alive
Kick it up
Tell the boys in the band
Play it hot 'cause I came in here to dance
Kick it up
Give that country girl a whirl
My boots are gonna lose the blues when they turn those guitars up
Kick it up
Got my paycheck in my pocket
Darling we'll spend every dime
And when this bar starts rocking
We'll show them all just how to unwind
Don't worry bout your troubles
Leave 'em at the door
And I'll meet you out on the floor
Kick it up
Tell the boys in the band
Make it smoke 'cause she came in here to dance
Kick it up
Give that country girl a whirl
My boots are gonna lose the blues when they turn those guitars up
Kick it up
Kick it up
When the boss man gets you down
Kick it up
If you're tired of the runaround
Kick it up
Yeah we know Monday morning will be here before too long
So until the night is gone
Kick it up
Tell the boys in the band
Play it hot make it smoke 'cause we came here to dance
Kick it up
Give that country girl a whirl
My boots are gonna lose the blues when they turn those guitars up
Kick it up
Oh kick it up
Kick it up kick it up
Kick it up kick it up
Kick it up
Kick it up kick it up
Kick it up
Kick it up
