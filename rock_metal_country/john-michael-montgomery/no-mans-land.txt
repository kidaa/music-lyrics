That house on the hill is long gone
Now she's living in a trailer with an Astroturf lawn
Got three little kids and no one to help
Trying to be Momma and Daddy all by herself
It's hard to hold down the fort when you're holdin' down a job
She'd rob Peter to pay Paul but he's already been robbed
She gets the food on the table and the clothes off the lines
She'd break down and cry but she doesn't have time
She got to be strong, life goes on
Though it's nothin' like she had planned
She's gonna be o.k. gonna find a way
Living in no man's land
Every now and then late at night
She thinks of how it would feel to hold someone tight
And there's a guy down at work he keeps callin' her up
But she ain't ready for none of that stuff
She's still sifting through the ashes of a love that's been and gone
Looking for a clue, trying to find out what went wrong
It ain't always easy, but she knows she's gotta try
Every time she looks into her babies' eyes
She got to be strong, life goes on
Though it's nothin' like she had planned
She's gonna be o.k. gonna find a way
Living in no man's land
She got to be strong, life goes on
Though it's nothin' like she had planned
She's gonna be o.k. gonna find a way
Living in no man's land
No man's land
