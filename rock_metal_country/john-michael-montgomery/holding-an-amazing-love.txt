Another guy in line on highway 9 in a rush
Clockin in and out again, I guess I'm just
An average man, but these calloused hands
Are holding an amazing love
I have seen treasured dreams turn to dust
That fade away like yesterday that I'll never touch
But fortune's been kind cuz these arms of mine
Are holding an amazing love
So just hold me closer and tell me you love 
And that everything's alright 
For the weight of the world rolls off my shoulders
Whenever I look in your eyes
Just another guy rolling in the drive in a rush
Standin at the door, is what he's livin for and needs so much 
Just an average man, but these calloused hands
Are holding an amazing love
I'm just an average man, but these calloused hands
Are holding an amazing love
