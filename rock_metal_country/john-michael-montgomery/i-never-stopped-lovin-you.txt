I guess everybody goes to the grocery store - even me
There's no tellin' who in the world there you're gonna see
Lost in space at the cash-only aisle number three
I came face-to-face with an old memory
Caught by surprise I felt I was gasping for air
Paper or plastic can't you see man I don't really care
She hadn't noticed me and I thought I'd leave it that way
Then her eyes met mine and from that point there was no escape
I said it's wonderful to see you
This is sure a nice surprise
Your little girl is lovely
No doubt she's got your eyes
Yeah, it looks like it might rain today
But I guess we're overdue
Oh and by the way - I never stopped lovin' you
I remember where you got that sweatshirt you're wearin'
Do you?
I won it at the county fair back in '92
Yeah, I'm still playin' softball with the same old bunch
In a lot of way things haven't changed very much
I said it's wonderful to see you
This is sure a nice surprise
Your little girl is lovely
No doubt she's got your eyes
Yeah, it looks like it might rain today
I guess we're overdue
Oh and by the way - I never stopped lovin' you
