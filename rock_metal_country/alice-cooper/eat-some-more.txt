Sixty million tons of meat
Spoiling in the stinking heat
Train full loads of moldy bread
Millions will still go unfed
Acres full of dying wheat
Burning brightly at our feet
A billion tons of roasted fish
Some with nothing on their dish
We can't see we're going blind
We're just dying on the vine
We're all sinking from the weight
Open wide and salivate
Do you like the taste?
Stuff it in your face
Its not nice to waste
We're not happy 'til we're choking
So we eat some more
Throw up on the floor
Go back to the store
We're so hungry
So pathetic
Lots of melting cheddar cheese
Spreading instant meat disease
Rotting veggies on the ground
Where hungry little kids are found
Worms in fruit an ugly sight
They're begging for a single bite
Our garbage dumps are mountains high
While other people sadly die
We can't see we're going blind
We're just dying on the vine
We're all sinking from the weight
Open wide and salivate
Do you like the taste?
Stuff it in your face
Its not nice to waste
We're not happy 'til we're choking
So we eat some more
Throw up on the floor
Go back to the store
We're so hungry
So pathetic
We can't see we're going blind
We're just dying on the vine
We're all sinking from the weight
Open wide and salivate
Do you like the taste?
Stuff it in your face
Its not nice to waste
We're not happy 'til we're choking
So we eat some more
Throw up on the floor
Go back to the store
We're so hungry
So pathetic
