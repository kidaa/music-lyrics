I'm dressed in black
I'm heart attack
And my draw is lightning quick
If you're looking for a man with a magic hands
I can really do the trick
And if you see me on the street
And you're burnin'from the heat
There's a fire down below 
You be the target on the bed
I'll be shooting hot lead
Let me take control
You're scared little girl in this big, bad town
So easy to sink, so easy to drown
Pull my trigger, I get bigger
Then I'm lots of fun
I'm your gun
I'm your gun, gun, gun
Bite my bullet
Push and pull it
Tell me I'm the one
I'm your gun
I'm your gun, gun, gun
Hold on steady, always ready, yeah
Well, I'm as hard as they come
I'm a hit and run
I'm a pistol packin'boy
Better walk real slow
I'm on the edge, y'know
And I'm easily annoyed
If someone's giving you trouble
I'll be there on the double
Just call me on the line
I've got the muscle I can flex
It'll fog your little specs
Till you think you're going blind
I know these streets like scars on my back
And I stay as loaded as this gun on my back
Pull my trigger, I get bigger
Then I'm lots of fun
I'm your gun
I'm your gun, gun, gun
Bite my bullet
Push and pull it
Tell me I'm the one
I'm your gun
I'm your gun, gun, gun
Squeeze it tighter
Aim and fire, yeah
Hold on steady, always ready
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Pull my trigger, I get bigger
Then I'm lots of fun
I'm your gun
I'm your gun, gun, gun
Rub my barrel
Straight and narrow
Dress up like a nun
I'm your gun
I'm your gun, gun, gun
Load my clip and lick your lips
This is gettin'fun
I'm your gun
I'm your gun, gun, gun
