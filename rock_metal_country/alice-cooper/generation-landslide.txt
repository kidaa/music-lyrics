Please clean the plates, dear
The Lord above can see ya
Don't you know people are starving in Korea?
Alcohol and razor blades are straight pins and needles
Kindergarten people-they use'em, they need'em
Over-indulging machineswere their children
there wasn't a way down on Earth to cool'em
'Cause they look just like humans at Kresges and Woolworths
But decadent brains were ruling the streets
Saying generation landslide closed the gap between'em
And I laugh to myself at the men and the ladies
Who never conceived of us billion dollar babies
militant mothers hiding in their basement
Using pots and pants as their shields and their helmets
Molotov milk bottles haved from pink high chairs
While Mothers' Lib burned son's hours
But she owns a Maserati that's a gift from his father
Stopped at full speed at a hundred miles per hour
The Colgate invicible shield finally got'em
