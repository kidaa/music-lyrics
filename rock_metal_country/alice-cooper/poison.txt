Your cruel device
Your blood, like ice
One look could kill
My pain, your thrill

I want to love you but I better not touch Don't touch
I want to hold you but my senses tell me to stop
I want to kiss you but I want it too much Too much
I want to taste you but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison running through my veins
You're poison, I don't want to break these chains

Your mouth, so hot
Your web, I'm caught
Your skin, so wet
Black lace on sweat

I hear you calling and it's needles and pins And pins
I want to hurt you just to hear you screaming my name
Don't want to touch you but you're under my skin Deep in
I want to kiss you but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison running through my veins
You're poison, I don't wanna break these chains
Poison

One look could kill
My pain, your thrill
I want to love you but I better not touch Don't touch
I want to hold you but my senses tell me to stop
I want to kiss you but I want it too much Too much
I want to taste you but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison running through my veins
You're poison, I don't wanna break these chains
Poison

I want to love you but I better not touch Don't touch
I want to hold you but my senses tell me to stop
I want to kiss you but I want it too much Too much
I want to taste you but your lips are venomous poison, yeah
I don't want to break these chains
Poison, oh no
Runnin' deep inside my veins,
Burnin' deep inside my veins
It's poison
I don't wanna break these chains
Poison
