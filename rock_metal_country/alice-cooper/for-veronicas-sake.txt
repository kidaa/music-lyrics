Alice Cooper / Bernie Taupin / Dick Wagner
I got my name and number
I got my bed assigned
I got a dog in the city pound
That I left behind
I'm strapped down and wild-eyed
She's locked up in a pen
She needs somebody to feed her
And I'm her only friend
So for Veronica's sake I gotta get out of here
Yeah for Veronica's sake, she can get pretty weird
Yeah for Veronica's sake I gotta get myself out of here
We both been put in cages
We got our shots and tags
I got my sweatin' fist to shake
She's got her tail to wag
She has to bark and whimper
While I could scream and shout
The clock above the psycho ward
Says time is running out
So for Veronica's sake I gotta get out of here
Yeah for Veronica's sake, she can get pretty weird
Yeah for Veronica's sake I gotta get myself out of here
And I can see her howling all night at the lonely moon
They're going to give her the gas if I don't get there soon
I gotta get there soon
For Veronica's sake I gotta get out of here
Yeah for Veronica's sake, she can get pretty weird
