Hello! Hooray! Let the show begin
I've been ready
Hello! Hooray! Let the lights grow dim
I've been ready
Ready as theis audience that's coming here to dream
Loving every second, every moment, every scream
I've been waiting so long for this thing to come
Yeah - I've been thinking so long I was the only one
Roll out! Roll out your American dream and its rescuit
I've been ready
Roll out! Roll out your circus freaks and hula hoops
I've been ready
Ready as theis audience that's coming here to dream
Loving every second, every moment, every scream
I've been waiting so long for this thing to come
Yeah - I've been thinking so long I was the only one
I can stand here strong and thin
I can laugh when this thing begins
God, I feel so strong
I feel so strong
I'm so strong
I feel so strong
So strong
God, I feel so strong
