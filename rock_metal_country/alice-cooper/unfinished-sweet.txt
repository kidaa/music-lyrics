Candy everywhere , got chocolate in my hair
Aching to get me
Stickly sweet suckers in the Halloween air
Aching to get me
Saint Vitus dance on my morals tonight
Aching to get me
Aching to get me, get me oh ...
Take it to the doc, I guess he ought to know
La, la, la, da
Which ones can stay , which one gotta go
He looks in my mouth and then he starts to gloat
He says me teeth are O.K.
But my gums got to go
Oh oh ...
I come off the gas but I'm still seeing spies
Aching to get me
I can see them all through a glassy pair of eyes
Aching to get me
De Sade's gonna live in my mouth tonight
La, da, da, da, da
And the rotten tooth fairy is satisfied
La, da, da, da, da
