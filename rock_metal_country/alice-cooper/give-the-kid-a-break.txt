Don't know why I'm down here
Must be something I said
Or some small I small imperfection
In my soul or in my head
Don't know why I'm down here
Don't deserve to roast or bake
I'm fighting off slanderous allegations
Why don't you give the kid a break
Don't you think maybe we could talk this over
You're a reasonable man
Could we discuss my grave situation
I'm a miserable man
And I'm in the frying man
Give the kid a break
Give me one good reason why I should
All, right, all right, so I made a few mistakes
But listen for Heaven's sake
Watch your language ,Kid
OK, OK, don't get hot
Don't question my judgement
He only reaped what he sowed
He cast his pearls before swine
And that's good enough for me
I don't want to talk it over
Even tho' I'm a resonable man
Sonny, come over here
Looks like you're in no position to bargain
You're a convicted man
You're right in the frying pan
Give the kid a break
Please, give me a kid of break
Give the kid a break
Nah, nah, I don't think so, man
Come on, you know I got what it takes
Can't you give me a break
Sure thing kid, when Hell freezes over
Give the kid a break
Hey, you guys, I thought you were on my side
No they don't
Give the kid a break
Yeah, well thanks a lot, pals
Listen boss, maybe we can make a little deal
Isn't there anything I can say
Of some kind of fine I can pay
Something
Don't know why I'm down here
Must be something I said I'm sorry
Or some small imperfection
In my soul or in my head
It might be some infection
It might be a small imperfection or a clear case of misdirection
It might be a small imperfection
In my soul or in my head
Give the kid a break
