We're so young and pretty
We're so young and clean
So many things
That we have never seen
...from Ohio
Sell this damn old store
Big Apple dreamin
On a wooden floor
Skyscrapers
And subways and stations
Starin' up
At the United Nations
New York is waiting
For you and me, baby
Waiting to swallow us down
New York, we're coming
To see what you're made of
Are you as great as you sound
Heard about them massages
And all those dirty shows
Well, I read somewhere
Some places never close
While we waste time on yokels
Comin' through the door
Big Apple dreamin'
On a wooden floor
New York is waiting
For you and me, baby
Waiting to swallow us down
New York, we're coming
To see what you're made of
Are you as tough as you sound
Yeah, New York is waitin', baby
Waitin' to swallow us down
New York, we're coming
To see what you're made of
Can't be as tough as you sound
Oh, New York
Oh New York, we're comin'
Oh we're comin'
To see what you're made of
Oh can't be as good as you sound
Me and my baby, we're comin'
Oh we're comin'
They're waitin' for you and me, baby...
