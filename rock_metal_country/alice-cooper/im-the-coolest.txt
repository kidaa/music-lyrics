You know that I'm the coolest
That's ever come around
You'll notice things get hotter
Whenever I'm in the town
I mean I gotta be the coolest
Who else could it be
Everybody knows who's really cool
Me
Let's face it I'm the greatest
I'm Mr. Number One
My hometown built a statue
To their favorite son
I mean a gotta be the greatest
I'm just a ball of fun
I mean I'm definitely the greatest
I'm also the coolest
You can't leave a package like you
Sitting on no shelf
Let me tell you I'm so cool sonny
I'm gonna save a little for myself
Baby, come over here a minute
Who is the coolest
I mean how to I look
Yea
You can't leave a package like you
Sitting on no shelf
Let me tell you, I'm so cool, sonny
I'm gonna save a little for myself
You know the day I was born
There were these for dudes up on a hill
They said they saw this star
Hanging out over town
And the whole world seemed to stand still
It image the Sunday papers
I guess it provers for sure
I am the coolest
I am the greatest
I am the baddest
I am the smoothest
I'm just the best
Sand dancer come on
Ah yea
