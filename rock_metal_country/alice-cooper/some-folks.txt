Some folks
Love to see red
Some folks
Never talk about it
Some folks
Crave a blue lady
Some folks
Know and still they doubt it
I'm just no good without it
I'm not a man at all
It makes my skin crawl
Baby, baby
Come on and save me, save me,
My, my baby, baby,
Come on and save me now
Some folks
Love to feel pain
Some folks
Wake up every mornin'
Some folks
Live for no reason
Some folks
Die without a warning
I'm just no good without it
I'm not a man at all
It makes my skin crawl
Baby, baby
Come on and save me, save me,
My, my baby, baby,
Come on and save me, save me,
My, my baby, baby,
Come on and save me now
I can't live without it
I just can't live without it
I don't wanna think about it
....
I'm just no good without it
I'm not a man at all
It makes my skin crawl
Baby, baby
Come on and save me, save me,
My, my baby, baby,
Come on and save me, save me,
My, my baby, baby,
Come on and save me, save me,
My, my baby, baby,
Come on and save me, save me,
I can't live without it
I just can't live without it
I don't wanna think about it...
