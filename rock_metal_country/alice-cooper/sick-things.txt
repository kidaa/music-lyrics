Sick things in cars rotate around my stars
Sick things ,my things, my pets, my things
I love you
Things, I see as much as you love me, you things are heavently when you come worship me
You things are chilled with fright for I am out tonight
You tell me where to bite, you whet my appetite
I eat my things
What love it brings
Come here, my things
Don't fear my little things
Sick things in cartridge tapes my stars
Sick things, play things, pretty things, pretty things, my things
