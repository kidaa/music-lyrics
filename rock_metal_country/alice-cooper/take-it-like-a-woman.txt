I bet ya never thought
That it would never turn out like this
Mama's little girl
Daddy's little princess
But somewhere in your fairy tale
Everything went wrong
Now the sun don't shine
The words don't ryhme
You're out of time
You've been beaten down
Kicked around on the ground
But you took it like a woman
Victimized, terrorized, paralyzed
But you took it like a woman
Pushed too far pulled too hard
Deeply scared
I know you must have felt the pain
But you took it like a woman
Ya thought you had your Mr. Right
But he was really Mr. Hyde
Ya gave him your most precious gift
You were his bleeding bride
He tied you up pulled your hair
He slapped your innocent face
Yeah, you were black and blue
He laughed at you
So what'd you do?
Aw you've been beaten down
Kicked around on the ground
But you took it like a woman
Victimized, terrorized, paralyzed
But you took it like a woman
Pushed too far pulled too hard
Deeply scared
I know you must have felt the pain
But you took it like a woman
And so its over
Your fantasy life is finally at an end
And the world above is still a brutal place
And the story will start again
You been beaten down
Kicked around on the ground
But you took it like a woman
Victimized, terrorized, paralyzed
But you took it like a woman
Pushed too far pulled too hard
Deeply scared
I know you must have felt the pain
Felt the pain
I know you must have felt the pain
But you took it like a woman
You took it like a woman
I know you must have felt the pain
You took it like a woman
I know you must have felt the pain
You took it like a woman
I know you must have felt the pain
You took it like a woman
