Don't touch your lips
Don't wear your hair like that
I feel your presence all around me
Don't get too close
Don't move your eyes like that
Because they're deep enough to drown me
It don't get how like this in Heaven
You fool me with your angel face
Your master knows where I'm my weakest
Mercy please, I'm on my knees
You're my temptation
Measure my faith, the devil's awake
He knows you're my temptation
Don't call my name
Don't brush my cheek like that
I curse the day that I found you
Don't touch my skin
Don't dance around like that
I feel damnation all around you
And so I raise my voice to Heaven
Please hide me in some holy place
Protect my soul, I'm only human
Mercy please, I'm on my knees
You're my temptation
Look down and see
Deliver me from my dark sensation
Give me faith, don't let me waste
You're my temptation
Come to me
You're such a liar
Won't you come to me
Move closer to the fire
Just come to me
No, no, no
Won't you come to me I will set you free
No, no, no
Mercy please, I'm on my knees
You're my temptation
Measure my faith, the devil's awake
He knows you're my temptation
Mercy please, I'm on my knees
You're my temptation
Go away in Heaven's name
You're my temptation
Go away, just go away
My dark sensation
