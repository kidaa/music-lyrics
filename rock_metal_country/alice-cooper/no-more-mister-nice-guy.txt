I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing
Until they got a hold of me
I opened doors for little old ladies
I helped the blind to see
I got no friends 'cause they read the papers
They can't be seen with me and I'm getting shot down
And I'm feeling mean
 No more Mister Nice Guy
 No more Mister Clean
 No more Mister Nice Guy
 They say he's sick , he's obscene
I got no friends 'cause they read the papers
They can't be seen with me and I'm getting shot down
And I'm feeling mean
My dog bit me on leg today
My cat clawled my eye
My mom's been thrown out of society circle
My dad's had to hide
I went to church incognito
When everybody rose, the Reserved Smith
He recognized me
