Lay  still,  steven,  and  I'll tell you a bedtime story. I'll tell you a
bedtime  story  that's  not  for all children. It's a very special story, that
only special children will understand. It's a half aware story, and it will be
better  if you close your eyes. It's a story that takes place in a dream, like
other  nightmares you have known. It's a dream that Alice has dreamed. You can
dream  along with him. You can follow Alice down the staircase, deep, down the
stairs to the pit where he doesn't want to go, but he has to.
If  you  go  to  sleep  now, Steven, you can go down the long and endless
staircase  and  sing sweet song to Alice and free him. And if you can't get to
sleep,  Steven  and the middle of night you get out of bed, when everything is
quiet  and the trees are still and the birds are hiding from the dark, you can
lay  down  on  your bedroom floor and press your ear tightly to the boards. If
you  listen very carefully you can hear Alice searching for a way out, forever
chasing rainbows.
Sleep tight, Steven. And have a good night.
