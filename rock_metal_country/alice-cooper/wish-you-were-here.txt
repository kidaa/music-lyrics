I sent you a postcard
Thought it would be funny
Would have sent a souvenir
But they took all my money
It's pretty warm down here but it ain't sunny
And I'm having a Hell of a time, my dear
Wish you were here
I tried to call you
I tried to call you
Long distance operators that only stall you
Besides the damn rates are so high
They just appall you
And I'm having a Hell of time, my dear
Wish you were here
And I'm having a Hell of time, my dear
Wish you were here
It started out on a nice vacation
Left the station right on time
Now it's turned to near frustration
I'm just a prisoner in time
Can't get a ticket to get me home, my dear
And I'm having a Hell of time, my dear
Wish you were here
Having a Hell of time, my dear
Wish you were here
Having a Hell of time, my dear
Wish you were here
Seeing all the sights here
I'm getting lonely
I'd show you all the film I took if they would only get ley me go home
Dear, sincerely
I'm having a Hell of time, my dear
Wish you were here
I'm having a Hell of time, my dear
Wish you were here
I'm having a Hell of time, my dear
Wish you were here
I'm having a Hell of time, my dear
Wish you were here
I'm having a Hell of time, my dear
Wish you were here
I'm having a Hell of time, my dear
Wish you were here
