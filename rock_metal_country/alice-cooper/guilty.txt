Just tried to have fun
Raised Hell and then store
I'm a dirt talking , beer drinking woman chasing minister's son
Slap on the make-up
And blast out the music
Wake up the neighborns with a roal like a teenage heavy metal elephant gun
If you call that guilty then that's what I am
I'm gulty
I'm gulty
Like driving too fast
Love going too far
It seems the law's on my ass everytime I stick it out of the door
If you call that guilty then that's what I am
I'm gulty
I'm gulty
Bad boy on a summer night
When the hearmakes me mean and I want to fight
With me pedal on the metal
And I do what I want to do
Bad girls make me feel all right
When it's hot and tey start screaming in the night
Golly gee, it's wrong be so guilty
I'm guilty
Guilty
I'm guilty
My conscience is on vacation in acute degeneration
Willpower has sunkto an all-time low
If you call that guilty well I guess I am
I'm gulty
I'm gulty
If you call this guilty then that's what I am
I'm gulty, I'm gulty, I'm gulty, I'm gulty
I'm gulty, I'm gulty, I'm gulty, I'm gulty
Well, I'm gulty
Yeah, I'm gulty
I don't care
I'm gulty
I think I have been framed anyway
They said I'm guilty
I'm gulty
They're guilty and everyone is guilty
