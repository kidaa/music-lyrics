I'm not looking
For a warm embrace
I'm not looking
For a friendly face
I've got
Everything I need
I'm not worried
If you're coming back
I'm in a hurry
Cause' I just found out
I've got
Everything I need
I've got
Everything I need
So even if you wanted to

You can't save me
You can't fail me
I'm back up  on my feet baby
In the way down
Is when I found out
That I got everything I need

I'm not looking
For a hand to hold
I'm not waiting
For someone to show
I've got
Everything I need
I never found a wall
I couldn't climb
I never seen a well
As deep as mine
I've got
Everything I need

I've got
Everything I need
So even if you wanted too

It doesn't matter
If I'm qualified
Or if I ever learn
To blow your mind
I've got
Everything I need
I'm not looking
For a place to shine
I wake up
And I'm satisfied
I've got
Everything I need
I've got 
Everything I need
So even if you wanted too
