Well there goes Sally, my old lady 
She gone crazy drawing lines on her face 
And you know I got a feeling that Sally been a'stealing 
'Cause I was hip to this, that you don't trust Skinny Lips 

Sally's got a good heart, raised in a churchyard 
But it ain't ever far from the backyard 
To the boulevard 
Cemetery girls ain't fun 
They don't taste sweet like sugar plums 
She wasn't always like this, but she did have skinny lips 

Well I don't believe it 
She don't, she don't need it from me 
Hey hey hey hey hey hey 

Now I seen her on weekends, my little rose garden 
I say hello to all her friends and the gentlemen 
Now I heard it from a junkie that my old lady 
Wasn't mine but everyone's Skinny Lips 

Well I don't believe it 
She don't, she don't need it from me 
Hey hey hey hey hey hey 

Come on, come on, come on, I need a witness 
Man it shouldn't be like this 
'Cause I know you won't be the pill 
That makes me feel that I'm the best 
Come on, come on Skinny Lips 
Come on and give me just one kiss 
'Cause you know I only got one wish 
I wanna be in love with Skinny Lips 

Well I don't believe it 
She don't, she don't need it from me 
Hey hey hey hey hey hey
