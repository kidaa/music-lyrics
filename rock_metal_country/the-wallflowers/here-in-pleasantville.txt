If you could see yourself
The way that I do
You might change
A thing or two
You wouldn't look so angry
You'd know it doesn't 
Look good on you
So grab your coat
Grab your hat
There ain't no saying
If we're coming back
Cause' something's gone
So terribly wrong
Here in Pleasantville

Do you remember
How we'd stay out so late
We used to have
So much fun
We used  to wish that the morning sun
Just wouldn't ever come
But look at us now
We're tucked in tight
We're just praying for a little light
Cause' something's gone
So terribly wrong
Here in Pleasantville

I need to tell you now
As we leave
That it's much worse
Than you would believe
And no matter how far
You think you've been

The beginning
Is where you are
So I'm using my last match
To put a fire up on every hill
And burn down Pleasantville

We never did learn
How to use our voices
We never thought
That we'd be heard
The only way they ever listen
Is if we sream every word
Caouse' there's nothing
In our walk
That just ain't the kind of luck we've got
So let's move on
Cause' something's gone
So terribly wrong
Here in Pleasantville
