Seen the shadow on my wall
Turn and fall
On broken hands and all
Turn and crawl
Seen that sun gone down
And the waterfall
She stood tall in the fallen rain
Right off an orphan train
She'll run to me again,
I believed,
See how wrong, how wrong you can be.

I know who watches you,
Who watches me 
I know who hears you,
Who hears me 
If my eyes blind,
Who'll see
The best in me 

I hear all the lonely cries
Underneath all these lies
She can't get them by,
Or through me.
See how wrong, wrong you can be.

My honey bee,
Why are you flyin' so far from me 

She keeps her hands so free
And walks through me,
Straight on through the dead of night
Her face is painted white
By these street lights.
They hold you down so tight
And like hounds they bite.

She fell down in her diamond suit
On lonely avenue, her color's only blue
She won't take clues,
See how wrong, how wrong you can be.

My honey bee
What on earth are you trying to do 

And where that hero falls, I held on
I always thought I'd see the lights close on me
And the water freeze, surrounding me.
Look how wrong you can be.

My honey bee
Why are you flyin' so far from me
