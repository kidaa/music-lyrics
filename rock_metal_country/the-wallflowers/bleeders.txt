Once upon a time 
They called me the bleeder
Well swimmin' up this river
With sentimental fever
But this ain't my first ride
It ain't my last try
Just got to keep a-movin' on
If they catch me ever
They'll throw me back forever

[chorus:]
I guess I should be ashamed
But I forget to be vain
Well I did the best I could I guess
But everything just bleeds
They say you're only sad and lonely
And no one is impressed

I sent it off in a letter
I need somethin' better
Than a nail and a hammer 
To put me back together
But this ain't my first ride 
It ain't my last try
Just got to keep a-movin on
Got to keep this together
Maybe next time is never

[chorus]

Sometimes I must confess
I do feel a little over dressed
Sometimes it's hard to tell the wishing from the well
Where you threw the penny and where it fell

I guess I should I should be ashamed
But I forget to be vain
Well I did the best I could I guess
But everything just bleeds
I guess I should be ashamed

But I forget to be vain
Well I did the best I could I guess
But everything just bleeds
They say you're only sad and lonely
And no one is impressed
