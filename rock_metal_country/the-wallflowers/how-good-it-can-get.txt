Slow down
You're breaking up
Use your words
Don't yell so much
I don't understand a word
That you're saying
Now move in 
Come up close
You look like
You've maybe seen a ghost
Tell me
Has someone gotten to you baby
Now open your arms
Pick up your head
Open your eyes
So you can see
What happens next

You won't believe
Just how good it can get
We'll make a lover 
Out of you yet

The fog is so thick
I can't see my hands
It got much worse
Soon as I got in
And I know you're somewhere
Here in the water
It's ten feet deep
And the river won't stop
I'll tell you what's in it
When I make it across
You could make it too
If you let someone help you

But you gotta give in
And you gotta let go
Then you can begin
To come up slow
Like a desert rose

[chorus]

Take a deep breath
And hold it in tight
And put your face up
Right into the light
Can't you feel that full moon
Shining down on you
Help is coming
From the great unknown
Just maybe not
When you needed it most
Cause' I can see you already
Know that you're leaving
But I wish you'd stay
And just let me in
Cause' everything can change
But you gotta be ready
Cause' you won't know when

[chorus]
