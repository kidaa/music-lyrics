Now if there's a smile on my face 
it's only there tryin' to fool the public 
but when it comes down to foolin' you; 
Now honey, that's quite a different subject 

But don't let my glad expression 
give you the wrong impression 
Really I'm sad 
I'm sadder than sad 
You're gone and I'm hurtin' so bad 
Like a clown I pretend to be glad 

Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than 
the tears of a clown 
when there's no one around 

Now if I appear to be carefree 
it's only to camouflage my sadness 
In order to keep my pride I try 
to cover the hurt with a show of gladness 

But don't let my show convince you 
that I've been happy since you 
decided to go 
Oh, I need you so 
I'm hurt and I want you to know 

Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than 
the tears of a clown 
when there's no one around 

Just like Pagliacci did 
I try to keep my sadness hid 
aaargh! I can't remember! It'll come to me and I'll send it 
along. 
But in my lonely room I cry 
the tears of a clown 
when there's no one around
