Whatever I know too much
You won't be anyone
Now tell me what you are thinking of
How could think you'd be enough
It's not that you've stayed too long
It's not that you've done something wrong
It's not your fault
But you embarrass yourself

Hand me down
It's better when you're not around
You feel good
And you look like you should
But you will never make us proud

You've been used by a army of cues
You've been touched by the lips of a queen
Now we've all made good use of you
But you won't be needed again
So don't you move and let someone else in
Make some room for a new harlequin
It's never enough
So don't disappoint us again

Hand me down
It's better when you're not around
You feel good
And you look like you should
But you won't ever make us proud

Hand me down
It's better when you're not around
You feel good
And you look like you should
But you could never make us proud
Hand me down

So look at you with your worn out shoes
Livin' proof evolution's through
We're stuck with you
This revolution's due

Hand me down
It's better when you're not around
You feel good
And you look like you should
But you could never make us proud

Hand me down
It's better when you're not around
You feel good
And you look like you should
But you won't ever make us proud
