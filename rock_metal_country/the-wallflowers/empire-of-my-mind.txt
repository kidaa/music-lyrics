Well, there is trouble in my mind
There is dark
There's dark, and there is light.
I lay our hands over my eyes
As I look deep
Through valleys deep and wide
Across the border line
For the Empire in My Mind

You are the reason I don't sleep
You are the light
That's breaking through the leaves
You know how hard I try
To believe
I have something good inside
Over barricades I climb
For the Empire in My Mind.

I have no love somewhere in time
I've been lifted up
I've looked honor in the eyes
I have no reason; I have no rhyme
I cannot deny
There's a darkness that's inside
I am guilty by design
And now I realize
The temptation's made me blind
To the Empire in My Mind

There is no order
There is chaos
And there is crime
There is no one home tonight
In the Empire in My Mind

There is no distance that I don't see
I do have a will
No limit to my reach
I wish I would; I wish I might
See a line tonight
Separating wrong from right
Some are only born to try
And maybe that's the reason why
I am afraid someday I'll find
There is no Empire in My Mind

There is trouble in my life
There is trouble in my life
