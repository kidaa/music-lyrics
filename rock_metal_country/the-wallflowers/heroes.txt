I, I wish you could swim 
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim 
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together 
We can beat them, for ever and ever. 

We can be Heroes, just for one day. 

I, I will be king 
And you, you will be queen 
Though nothing, nothing will drive them away 
We can be Heroes, just for one day 
We can be us, just for one day 

I, I remember standing, by the wall 
And the guns, shot above our heads 
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall 
And the shame, was on the other side 
Oh we can beat them, for ever and ever 

Then we could be Heroes, just for one day 

We can be Heroes 
We can be Heroes 
We can be Heroes 
We can be Heroes 
Just for one day
