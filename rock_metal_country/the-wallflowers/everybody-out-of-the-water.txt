On your mark
Get set let's go
You got to move on
Before she explodes
Look out the window
Lookout below
Back away from the glass
There she blows
The city's been leveled
Hills are in flames
Streets cracked open
And they're pushin' up clay
Temperature's dropped
Sky is grey
And it ain't even over
Here comes drivin' rain
It ain't me
That you feel
There's something moving
Around in here
That's blood
That's tears
This ain't a warning...

Everybody out of the water
Up on dry land
Take what you can
Cause' you won't be here again
Everybody out of the water

Now I'm treadin' high water
To get back to you
Been looking for a low spot
Or something to cling to
There's too many bodies

There's not enough room
God help me
And God help you
They say nobody panic
Help is on it's way
We're already on it
You've got to be brave
If you can fix it now
Then don't make us wait
Man there ain't nobody coming
Back away from the gates
That bell
That you hear
That's hell
Ringing in your ears
I fear
That my dear
This ain't a warning

[chorus]

Now I'm looking up
And the shit keeps coming
Like shooting ducks
In a barrel of honey
Got to learn how to pray
Love won't be enough
Admit it now
Your information sucks
As I slip
Down in
I think of us someplace
High on  a mountain
Smoke clears
Fog lifts
Little by little
We rebuild again
Till' then

[chorus]
