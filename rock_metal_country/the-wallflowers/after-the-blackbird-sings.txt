I'm finding it hard,
Just to keep up with someone
Who's hangin' onto nothin'
Only to lose what's never mine.

And I'm finding it hard
Just to keep up with something
That's hangin' on to nothin'
To keep all these chains tied up and in line, in line.

Pretty Angel,
She bites the hands of the lion,
Ties it up with ribbon,
Watches as hound dogs
Bang on her drums, drums.

It's so, it's so easy for you to love nobody,
It's so easy for you, 'cause you're not tryin' anymore.

I seen this girl
She had her hands full of lightning,
She rolled it down to me,
A Lolita smile,
With a thorn in her eyes.

Now she, she spun the world,
Up on the edge of a pearl,
A carnivals girl,
Up on a ferris wheel forever, forever.

It's so easy for you to love nobody,
It's so easy for you, 'cause you're not tryin' anymore,
Just don't try anymore.

Now she, she howled like an owl
Only to fall like a sparrow
And lay beside the scarecrow
But after the Blackbird sings
Is the song, the song.

It's just so easy,
It's just so easy for you to love nobody,
It's just so easy for you, 'cause you're not tryin' anymore.
