Never thought that I knew too much 
always thought I knew enough 
Why do you act tough? 
Well maybe I'm just   losing my touch 
And where do we go? 
They keep us on the run 
But    how could we know? 
We'd only just begun 

But look what we've  done 
They knew it all along 
That our chances were none 
In murder one by one 

And do you still have that dream 
Where two lovers play hide  and seek? 
Why would you find it 
Beneath the secrets that I keep? 
So  why do we lie 
And keep it all inside 
When love is implied 
And the heart just goes denied? 

And look what we've done 
They knew it all along 
They're in love with no one 
They murder one by one 

Tie you up with  just one thread 
And seal you in baby's breath 
And beneath your chest/ is a heart that needs a rest 
But I won't let you fall 
They keep us here in  line 
Like two paper dolls 
Her little hand in mine 

And look what we've  done 
They knew it all along 
That our chances were none 
In murder one by one
