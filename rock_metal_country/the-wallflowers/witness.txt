I'm standing outside your window, babe
There you are
Another year, another candle's burning
for the party girl
No one even knows that you're there
Happy birthday, no one cares

You come around here
 you better bring a witness
Everyone in here's on the guest list
Oh no doll, you won't be missed
Keep one eye open while you kiss

Your wishes won't be coming true this year
Now darling, don't you cry
We're gonna teach you everything
You'll learn to get by
Lesson number one,
 homicide... is emotional
 murder's no crimeYou come around here
 you better bring a witness
Everyone in here's on the guest list
Oh no doll, you won't be missed
Keep one eye open while you kiss

Now Sticks and stones, baby, break your bones
but the names in here can kill
We'd let you leave, but no one else wants you
Your ransom was not made
Now, you ain't gotta stand up tall
But, now, baby, you must stand up

You come around here
 you better bring a witness
Everyone in here's on the guest list
Now we've never been so impressed
Keep one eye open while
 while you kiss
