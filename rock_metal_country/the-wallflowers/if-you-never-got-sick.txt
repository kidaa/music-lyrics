That ain't a parachute
That ain't a rip cord
That ain't a body of water
We're headed for
There's so little time left
So much to be done
Even you are gonna need someone
That ain't a trick of light
Or the morning haze
Coming in from the lake
Getting into your eyes
It's the invisible breath
Of a storm on the rise
That I feel whenever you arrive

Now I may not be quick
Maybe never was
But tell me what the hell it is
That you've become

Baby if you never got sick
I wouldn't get to hold you
Baby if you never got sick
I would never get to hold you

This ain't a righteous love
Even a good one
These ain't the kinds of return
That I was thinking of
I'm unbearable now
You ain't seen nothing yet
You'll se me dead
Before you see me quit
That ain't a jug of wine
That you've been drinking from
Now lay back now baby
Let your fever come
I will bury you in
Just to dig you out
I haven't a use
For being proud

[chorus]

I followed you deep into a barren field
There was someone you were running from
When I needed to sleep
That's when you disappeared
But I did get the impossible done
Now I always knew
There was God inside you
I just never did learn which one

[chorus]
