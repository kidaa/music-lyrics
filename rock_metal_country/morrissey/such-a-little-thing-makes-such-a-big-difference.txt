Such a little thing 
Such a little thing 
But the difference it made was grave 
There you go 
Wielding a bicycle chain 
Oh, why won't you change ? 
Change and be nicer ? 
Such a little thing 
A gentle tone of kindness 
Or written words on paper 
- can you write ? 
How I love all of 
The very simple things of life 
God's good air 
How I love all of 
The very simple things of life 
Such a little thing 
A fumbling politeness 
The difference saved me 
Wielding a bicycle chain 
Why won't you change ? 
";I WILL NOT CHANGE 
AND I WILL NOT BE NICE"; 
Most peole keep their brains 
Between their legs 
Don't you find ?
Leave me alone - I was only singing 
Leave me alone because 
I was only singing 
Leave me alone - I was only singing 
Leave me alone 
You have just proved again 
MOST PEOPLE KEEP THEIR BRAINS 
BETWEEN THEIR LEGS
