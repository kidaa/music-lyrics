I'm writing this to say 
In a gentle way 
Thank You - but no 
I will live my life as I 
Will undoubtedly die - alone
I'm writing this to say 
In a gentle way 
Thank You ... 
I will live my life as I ... oh
For whether you stay 
Or stray 
An inbuilt guilt catches up with you 
And as it comes around to your place 
At 5 A.M.; wakes you up 
And it laughs in your face
