My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Please wait ... 
Oh ... 
Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith
