Winter coming 
Winter push on
push on 
Oh, winter push on 
Winter is so long 
Winter moves on
The last night on Maudlin Street
Goodbye house, goodbye stairs
I was born here
And I was raised here, and
...I took some stick here
Love at first sight
It may sound trite
But it's true, you know
I could list the detail
Of everything you ever wore or said
Or how you stood the day
As we spent the last night
On Maudlin Street
";Goodbye house, forever!";
I never stole a happy hour
Around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
Became what you see
Here I am - the ugliest man
Oh, the last night on Maudlin Street
Truly I do love you
Oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep
With that picture of you framed beside my bed
Oh, it's childish and it's silly
But I think it's you in my room, by the bed
...yes, I told you it was silly...
And I know
I took strange pills
But I never meant to hurt you
Oh, truly I love you
Came home late one night
Everyone had gone to bed
But, you know
No-one stays up for you
I had sixteen stitches
All around my head
Oh, the last bus I missed to Maudlin Street
So he drove me home in the Van
Complaining, ";Women only like me for my mind...";
Don't leave your torch behind
A powercut ahead; 1972, you know
And so we crept through the park
No, I cannot steal a pair of jeans off a clothesline
For you
But you ... without clothes
Oh, I could not keep a straight face
Me - without clothes ?
Well, a nation turns its back and gags...
I'm packed
I am moving house
A half-life disappears today
With ";every hand waves me on";
secretly wishing me gone
Well, I will be soon
Ooh, I will be soon
I will be soon
I will be soon
Will be soon, I will be soon
Mmm ... I will be soon, I will be soon
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
They took you away in a police car
Inspector - don't you know ?
Don't you care ?
Don't you know - about Love ?
Your gran died
And your mother died
On Maudlin Street
In pain, and ashamed
With never time to say
those special things ... oh
I took the key from Maudlin Street
Well, it's only bricks and mortar !
Oh, oh, truly I love you
Oh, wherever you are
Wherever you are
Wherever you are
I hope you're singing now
Oh, I do hope 
I hope you're singing now
Oh ...
