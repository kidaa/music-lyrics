Our unsleepable friend 
Gets the message on an ill wind 
";All your friends and your foes 
Would rather die than have to touch you"; 
TO SAY THE LEAST: I'm truly disappointed 
Truly, truly, truly, oh... 
Drank too much 
And I said too much 
And there's nowhere to go - but Down 
Young boy - I wanna help you 
SEE THESE LINES ? : Truly disappointed 
Truly, truly, truly, oh... 
Don't talk to me, no 
About people who are ";nice"; 
'Cause I have spent my WHOLE LIFE 
in RUINS 
Because of people who are ";nice"; 
Oh, this world may lack Style, I know 
Each bud must blossom and grow, oh... 
Young girl, one day you will be old 
But the thing is, I love you NOW 
Mmm ...
This is the last song I will ever sing Yeah! 
No: I've changed my mind again Aaw...
GOODNIGHT
AND THANKYOU
