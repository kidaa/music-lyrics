Churchillian legs 
Hair barely there 
Mmm, the harsh truth of the camera eye 
Your eyes signal pain 
Because of the strain of smiling 
The harsh truth of the camera eye 
Telling you all 
That you never wanted to know 
Showing you what 
You didn't want shown 
My so friendly lens 
It zooms into 
";The inner you"; 
And it tells the harsh truth 
And nothing but 
Laugh with us all now, here 
If you can 
Then take the pictures home 
And scream 
Oh, ooh; telling you all 
That you never wanted to know 
Showing what 
You didn't want shown 
This photographer 
He must have really had it in for you 
";Ooh, I don't want 
To be judged anymore 
I don't want to be judged 
I would sooner be Loved 
I would sooner be 
Just blindly Loved ...";
