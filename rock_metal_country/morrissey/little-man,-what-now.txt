An afternoon nostalgia
Television show
You spoke in silhouette
but they couldn't name you
Though the panel were very polite to you
Oh, but I remembered you
Friday nights, 1969
ATV - you murdered every line
Too old to be a child star
Too young to take leads
Four seasons passed
And they AXED you
Nervous juvenile
WON'T SMILE!
What became of you ?
Did that swift eclipse
Torture you ?
A star at eighteen
And then - suddenly gone
Down to a few lines
In the back page
Of a faded annual
Oh, but I remembered you
I remembered you
