With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am 
And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am 
And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased
