Off the rails I was and 
Off the rails 
I was happy to stay 
GET OUT OF MY WAY 
On the rack I was 
Easy meat, and a reasonably good buy 
A reasonably good buy 
The Piccadilly palare 
Was just silly slang 
Between me and the boys in my gang 
";So Bona to Vada. OH YOU 
Your lovely eek and 
Your lovely riah"; 
We plied an ancient trade 
Where we threw all life's 
Instructions away 
Exchanging lies and digs my way 
Cause in a belted coat 
Oh, I secretly knew 
That I hadn't a clue 
No, no. No, no, no. You can't get there that way. Follow me...
The Piccadilly palare 
Was just silly slang 
Between me and the boys in my gang 
Exchanging palare 
You wouldn't understand 
Good sons like you 
NEVER DO. 
So why do you smile 
When you think about Earl's Court ? 
But you cry when you think of all 
The battles you've fought and lost ? 
It may all end tomorrow 
Or it could go on forever 
In which case I'm doomed 
It could go on forever 
In which case I'm doomed 
Bona Drag ...
