Rock Kilough
Ever want to runaway?
Ever want to leave?
Never want to hang around?
Never want to grieve?
If love turned into labor
I would just resign
Working through the hard times never crossed my mind
And I'm guity of entering and breaking hearts so dear
Guilty of unlawful flight and failing to appear
I've commited all the crimes of love - every felony
Now, I have but once defense - to plead insanity

Where can I surrender?
I'm tired of being free
I want love to come and make a prisioner out of me
Lock me in your velvet cell and throw away the keyEvents have come full circle now
I spend my nights alone
Where love was once so full and free
Love had up and gone
If the Good Lord should see fit to bring
Sweet love my way again
I'll die before I run away
And be the fool I've been

Where can I surrender?
I'm tired of being free
I want love to come and make a prisioner out of me
Lock me in your velvet cell and throw away the key
Lock me in your velvet cell and throw away the key
