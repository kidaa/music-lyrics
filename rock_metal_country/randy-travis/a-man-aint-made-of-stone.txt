I was supposed to be the rock that you could stand on
Stronger than an old oak tree
But all you ever wanted was the one thing I never let you see
The tender side of me
I tried to be a mountain;
Solid and strong
All it took was your leaving to know I was wrong

Chorus:
A man ain't made of stone
A man ain't made of steel
The way I feel right now
I thought I'd never feel
Sometimes all it takes is facing the night alone
And that's when you know a man ain't made of stone

In this world of mine there was no room for weakness
I covered every crack in the wall
But there ain't no way that I can keep this secret
'Cause when you go like cherieko I fall
You thought I wouldn't shatter
Would I even care?
But there's more to what I'm made of
Than this broken heart can bear

Repeat Chorus

Sometimes all it takes is facing the night alone
And that's when you know a man ain't made of stone
That's when you know a man ain't made of stone
