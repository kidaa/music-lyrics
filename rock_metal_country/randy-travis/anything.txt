Ronnie Scaife/Phil Thomas 

I'd do anything if you'd just let me hold you 
I'd do anything to change your mind 
Climb the highest moumain or swim the deepest ocean 
Anything to make you mine 

Anything, anytime 
Day or night, rain or shine 
There ain't nothin?I won't do 
To get to you 

Is there anything I can say to make you love me 
Is there anything I haven't tried 
Well I'd take you 'round the world   
Just to walk you down a dirt road   
Anything to make you mine Anything, anytime 
Day or night, rain or shine 
There ain't nothin?I won't do 
To get to you 

Well I'd give anything if I had you forever 
I'd give anything to see that time 
Well I'd walk upon my hands up the stairway to heaven 
Anything to make you mine

Anything, anytime 
Day or night, rain or shine 
There ain't nothin?I won't do 
To get to you
