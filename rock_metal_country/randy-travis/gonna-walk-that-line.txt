Intro chords: 

I never been too good at doing right
Done mostly wrong most all my life
I never found a place to settle down
Baby I do believe I found it now

CHORUS
I'm gonna walk that line - gonna tote that barge
gonna lift that bale - gonna work real hard
Doin' anything that you want me to
Baby I'm gonna walk that line for youHOOK
Ooooo Im gonna walk that line for you
Ooooo I'm gonna walk that line for you
Do anything that you want me to
Ooooo I'm gonna walk that line for you


Well straight and narrow if ever was my past
Everlasting love never seem to last
I used to be a Tomcat out on the prowl
But baby I'm just your puppy dog now

CHORUS
[repeat HOOK and fade]
