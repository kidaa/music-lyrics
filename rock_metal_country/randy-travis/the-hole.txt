A friend of mine bought himself a shovel
Said Im gonna tunnel me a mine
He set out to be a rich man
Happiness is what he thought hed fine

Got in to deep to see the diamond
Down to dark to see the gold
Now he wont let go of the shovel
And he cant dig out of the hole

Deeper and deeper hes going down
Driving his future right into the ground
He thinks hes closer the further he goes
But hes still on the bottom
And he cant dig out of the hole
I tried to throw the man a life line
I tried to send him down a rope
I dont think he hears me calling
But everyday I pray and hope
Somehow he finally gets the message
Every spade of dirt he throws
Only gets him closer to the devil
And he cant dig out of the hole

repeat chorus:
Maybe we could learn a little lesson
Maybe thisll shine a little light
Cause theirs no healthy way to mess with
The line between wrong and rightUse the one chance youve been given
Cause once your in the ground and cold
Its too late to start livin?
You see you cant dig out of the hole

Repeat chorus:

Its hell on the bottom
And you cant dig out of the hole
