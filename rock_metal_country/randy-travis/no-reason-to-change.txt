I know a man, we call him 'Poor Boy' Jones
He's never been a hundred miles from home
He's got a pretty good farm and a level head
A heart of gold and the bible read

No satellite dish for his T.V. set
And he ain't on line with the internet
He says guitar music entertains us here
And it sounds real good to the untrained ear

And I can't find a reason to change
More of this and more of that
Has never been my game
The way I've got it figured out
I ain't missed a thing
And I can't find a reason to change

Some people like to fly around first class
But a Greyhound bus goes pretty danged fast
Been a whole lot of times when times were lean
A big night out was the Dairy Queen

He says all my children, they believe in God
They can hold their own, they can hold a job
There's a whole lot of colors in the human race
And loving one another makes a better place

And I can't find a reason to change
More of this and more of that
Has never been my game
The way I've got it figured out
I ain't missed a thing
And I can't find a reason to change

No, I can't find a reason to change...
