Dennis Linde 

All you wanted was a one-night stand 
The fire of the wine and the touch of a man 
But I fell in love and ruined all of your plans 
What'Il you do about me 
Imagine the faces on your high-class friends
When I beat on the door and I beg to come in 
Screamin' ";Corne on love me again"; 
What'Il you do about me 

You can change your number, you can change your name  
You can ride like hell on a midnight train 
That's alright mama, that's O.K. 
But what'Il you do about mePicture your neighbors when you try to explain
That good ol' boy standin' out in the rain 
With his nose on the vvindow pane 
Lady, what'Il you do about me 
What in the world are you plannin?to do 
When a man comes over just to visit with you
And I'm on the porch with a 2' x 2'
Tell me what'Il you do about me
You can call your lawyer, you can call the fuzz
You can sound the alarm, wake the neighbors up
Ain't no way to stop a man in love 
What'Il you do about me

All you wanted was a one-night stand 
The fire of the wine and the touch of a man 
But I fell in love and baby here I am 
What'Il you do about me

You can change your number, you can change your name  
You can ride like hell on a midnight train 
That's alright mama, that's O.K. 
But what'Il you do about me
