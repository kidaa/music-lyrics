On the top shelf in the closet,
   in the workshop where he spent his extra time
   Was a dust wooden box _that I had never noticed till that time
   And we set on the table and carefully, we opened up the top
   And stared into the memory_Daddy kept inside the box

   THERE was a letter from mamma, when she went out to Reno
   To help her sister out in 62
   And a flower from Hawaii, when they went on vacation
   It was the first time that my Daddy ever flew

   AND the pocket knife I gave__to him on Fathers day
   Years ago, I thought it had been lost
   We all thought his heart was made from solid rock
   But that was long before we found the box

   I guess we always knew it_but ";I love you"; was hard for him to say
   Some men show it easy and some just never seem to find the way
   BUT that night I began__to see the softer side of some I had lost
   I saw the love he kept inside the first time_we opened up the box

   THERE was a picture that was taken,when he and Mom were dating
   Standing by his 1944, 
   and the faded leather Bible, he got when he was baptised
   I guess no one understood him like the Lord

   AND the poem that he had written, about his wife and children
   The tender words he spoke were quite a shock

   We all thought his heart was made of solid rock
   But that was long before we found the box
   Yes that was long before we found the box
