You've been too gone, too long, 
it's too late to come back now
It's been so long since you walked out my door
now you're just an old song nobody sings anymore
I gotta a new love and she's the true love
but darlin' how could you have known?
Cause you've been too gone, for too long
now it's too late to come back home

You've been a long way, goin' the wrong way
don't even set your suitcase down
You wanted to roam, now you're paying the bills
you're an old rollin' stone who ran over the hills
I had a good cry when you said ";Goodbye";
I didn't wanna let you go
but you've been too gone for too long
now it's too late to come back homeI had a good cry when you said ";Goodbye";
I didn't wanna let you go
but you've been too gone for too long
so why don't you just stay gone?
you've been too gone for too long
now it's too late to come back home
