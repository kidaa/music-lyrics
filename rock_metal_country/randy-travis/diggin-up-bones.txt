Verse 1:
Last night i dug your picture out from my old dresser drawer
I set it on the table and i talked to it 'til four
I read some old love letters right up 'til the break of bone
Yeah i've been settlin' alone diggin' up bones

Verse 2:

Then i went to the jewelery and i found our wedding rings
I've put mine on my finger and i gave yours a flame
I crossed this lonely bedroom of our recent broken home
Yeah tonight i'm settlin' alone diggin' up bones

Chorus:

I'm diggin' up bones,i'm diggin' up bones
Exhuming things that better left alone
I'm resurrecting memories of love that's dead and gone
Yeah tonight i'm settlin' alone diggin' up bones

Verse 3:

And i went to the closet and i found some things in there
Like that pretty neglige that i bought you to wear
And i recall how good you looked each time you had it on
Yeah tonight i'm settlin' alone diggin' up bones

Chorus.

I'm resurrecting memories of love that's dead and gone
Yeah tonight i'm settlin' alone diggin' up bones
Chorus til end.
