Tonight we're gonna tear down the walls  
We're gonna laugh and drink and dance and have a ball 
The good times ain't over after all
And tonight we're gonna tear down the walls 
It seems we let the hard times come between us 
Like a wall around our hearts we couldn't see 
Hard luck and trouble came rainin?down upon us  
They almost got the best of you and me

Once we loved to stay at home and make love 
Now work is all we ever seem to do 
We been spendin?too much time makin?money
I think it's time we had a laugh or two

Tonight we're gonna tear down the walls  
We're gonna laugh and drink and dance and have a ball 
The good times ain't over after all
And tonight we're gonna tear down the walls 
It seems we let the hard times come between us 
Like a wall around our hearts we couldn't see 
Hard luck and trouble came rainin?down upon us  
They almost got the best of you and meYou put your party clothes and makeup
And I'll polish that ol?truck until it shines
Don't worry 'bout a thing 'til monday mornin?
Just leave hard luck and troubles far behind?
 'cause

Tonight we're gonna tear down the walls  
We're gonna laugh and drink and dance and have a ball
The good times ain't over after all
And tonight we're gonna tear down the walls 

The good times ain't over after all
And tonight we're gonna tear down the walls
