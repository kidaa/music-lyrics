Would I
Would I
Would I

Would I go out honky tonkin' with you ever night
Dance every dance til I got them all right
Would I do every step the way you thought I should?
If I had you baby maybe yes I would
Would I

Would I wake up every morning,
bring you breakfast in bed
With the right amount of butter on your toasted bread
Would I fix your brunch, lunch and dinner just as good?
If I had you baby maybe yes I would

Well, if I had you, there'd be nothing you could do or say
To ever make me make you go away
Would I
Would I
Would I

Would I cut my hair and change the way I dressed?
Finally get around to cleaning up this mess?
Would I happily give up my batcholorhood?
If I had you baby maybe yes I would
Would I

Would I tear everybody from my little black book
Tell 'em all I was over the urge to look?
Would I marry you then just to make sure they understood?
If I had you baby maybe yes I would

Well, if I had you, there'd be nothing you could do or say
To ever make me make you go away
Would I
Would I
Would I
If I had you baby maybe yes, yes I would
