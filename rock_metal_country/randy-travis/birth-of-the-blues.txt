Oh they say some people long ago
Were searching for a different tune
One that they could croon as only they can

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that the start of the blues

And from a jail, came the wail
Of a down, hearted frail
And they played that, as part of the blues

From a whippoorwill, way up on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn, till it was worn, into a blue note

And then they nursed it, and they rehearsed it
and sent out the news
That the Southland, gave birth to the blues

 Instrumental 

And then they nursed it, and they rehearsed it
and then they sent out the news
That the Southland, gave birth to the blues...
