I ain't live forever but I've lived e-nough
I grew up with cowboys I watched on T-V
and I've learned to be gentle and I've learned to be tough
my  friends and I sometimes   pre-tended to be
I've found only   two things that last to the end
Years have gone by  but now and     again
One is your heroes the   other your friends
my heart rides the range with my heroes and friends

Your heroes will help you find good in yourself
your friends won't forsake you for somebody else.
They'll both stand beside you thru thick and thru thin
and that's how it goes with heroes and friends
