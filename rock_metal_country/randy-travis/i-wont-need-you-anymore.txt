You're my always and forever.
You're the one that hung the moon. 
After all these nights together
I still get lost in your perfume.
And if I could write a love song,
every line would tell the truth.
It would be a warm and soft one
and my heart would say to you

When you see me walk on water,
when the sea don't reach the shore
when the fires of hell freeze over,
I won't need you anymoreOh, the feelings lay so easy, 
lyin' here the way we are.
No one else could ever hold me
like the heavens hold the stars.

When you see me walk on water,
when the sea don't reach the shore
when the fires of hell freeze over,
I won't need you anymore
I won't need you anymore
