There's a point when you cannot walk away 
There's a darkness that  everyone must face
There are heroes whose   names we never hear

when you have to stand up 
straight and tall an  mean the words you say
it wants to take what's good and fair and lay it all to waste
a dedicated  army of quiet volun-teers

There's a point you must decide just to do it 'cause it's right
And that  darkness covers everything in sight
reaching  out to feed the hungry reaching out to save the   land

that's when you be-come a point of light
until it meets a   single point of light
reaching out to    their fellow    men.

All it takes is a point of light a ray of hope in the dar-kest night.
If you see what's wrong and you try to make it right

you will be a point of light.

There are dreamers who are making dreams come true
taking time to teach the children there's nothing they can't do.
Giving shelter to the homeless giving hope to those without.
Isn't that what this land's all about.
One by one form the mountains to the sea points of light
are calling out to you and me
All it takes is a point of light a ray of hope in the dar-kest night.
If you see what's wrong and you try to make it right

you will be a point of light.
