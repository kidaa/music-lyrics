Dirt road in the twi-lght,  woods so cool and dark.
Up a-head pale ne-on,  somewhere a dog barks,
Honky-tonk moon,  keeps shining on my ba-by and me

Breaking up the pool balls,  chalk-ing up the cues
Juke box pumping soft-ly,   lazy sum-mer blues
Honky-tonk moon,  keeps shining on my ba-by and me


Chorus

Through the blue smok-y haze,   all through the haze 
Trouble seems to melt a - way.............
My heart's on a roll,     I'm easy in my soul
There's no hur-ry,  no wor-ry,  things are go-in' my way

My arms a-round my ba-by,  shuf-flin' on the floor
Cig-a-rettes and saw-dust,  squeak-y old screen door.
Honk- Tonk Moon,  keeps shin-in on my ba-by and me.

Out-side the dark is fal-ling,  stars are twinkling bright
That old Hoot Owl is calling,  every-things all right
Honk- Tonk Moon,  keeps shin-in on my ba-by and me.
Honk- Tonk Moon,  keeps shin-in on my ba-by and me.
