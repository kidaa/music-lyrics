She Sure Did Like To Run 
Walt Aldridge/Bobby Tomberlin 

She made her exit a month ago tomorrow 
Called up her mama and asked if she could borrow 
Enough money to leave for awhile 
Mama said you always were impulsive child 
She bought a ticket at the Greyhound station 
Said she needed a permanent vacation 
Ran out of money by Santa Fe 
Hitchhiked the rest of the way 

And she blew into town with a runaway heart 
Like a Santa Ana blowin' down Ocean Boulevard 
Everybody said she was a restless one 
Never knew where she was going but 
She sure did like to run 

She took a job with a bucket and a wet mop 
Saved her pay checks and bought an old ragtop 
She'd crank it up and let her hair down 
They'd hear her coming for miles around 

And she blew into town with a runaway heart 
Like a Santa Ana blowin' down Ocean Boulevard 
Everybody said she was a restless one 
Never knew where she was going but 
She sure did like to run 

Last time I saw her she was letting the top down 
She wouldn't tell me but I think she was south bound 
She waved good-bye and looked back and smiled 
And took off after the call of the wild 

And she blew out of town with a runaway heart 
Like a Santa Ana blowin' down Ocean Boulevard 
Everybody said she was a restless woman 
Never knew where she was going 
She never knew where she was going 
Never knew where she was going 
But she sure did like to run
