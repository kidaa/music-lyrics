You Make Me Feel 

How I ever made it to you heaven only knows 
With the doors and the windows to my inside closed 
I don't now how you got in 
But I'll never let you out again 

Chorus 

Cause you make me feel every single drop of rain 
My heart's revealed every time I hear your name 
I feel your touch in the sunlight on my skin 
The subtle brush of your kisses in the wind 
You take my dreams and you make them even more 
You make me feel like I never loved before 
You lift me high light me on fire 
You set me free you let me see 
You make me feel 

Now it seems like everything you do surprises me 
I never thought I'd ever really love reality 
But you gave me a taste for love 
That I couldn't imagine of 

Chorus 

I feel your touch 
The subtle brush 
And you take my dreams and make them even more 
You make me feel like I never loved before 
You lift me higher, light me on fire 
You set me free 
You make me feel 
You make me feel
