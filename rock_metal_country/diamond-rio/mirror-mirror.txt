Mirror, Mirror, on my wall, 
Tell me, who is the loneliest fool of all 
No, wait a minute, I believe I see 
The answer staring back at me 

Spent most of the morning laying in bed 
Lunch was a black coffee and three cigarettes 
They say it will kill me, but I've got a hunch 
That this broken heart's gonna beat 'em to the punch 

Mirror, Mirror, on my wall, 
Tell me, who is the loneliest fool of all 
No, wait a minute, I believe I see 
The answer staring back at me 

Yes, I'm the one who swore she would stay 
Right up to the moment the U-Haul drove away 
She didn't leave a table; she didn't leave a chair 
But she knew what she was doing when she left you hanging there 

Mirror, Mirror, on my wall, 
Tell me, who is the loneliest fool of all 
No, wait a minute, I believe I see 
The answer staring back at me 

No, wait a minute, I believe I see 
The answer staring back at me
