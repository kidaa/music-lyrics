It Does Get Better Than This 

Sunset, a clear blue lake 
Fishing with the boys 
A weekend hanging out with my best friends 

Tall tales and ice cold beer 
Well, I can't blame you guys 
For saying this must be the living end 

CHORUS 

Hold on, it does get better than this 
If you were me 
You couldn't disagree 
'Cause I've held her oh so tight 
She's kept me up all night 
I've tasted her kisses sweet as wine 
Sure, this is a real good time 
But pardon me boys 
It does get better than this 

Cool night, by the fire 
At least a million stars 
A cooler full of fat catfish to fry 
Back slapping, telling jokes 
And howling at the moon 
I hear you saying, Ain't this 
the life but 

CHORUS 

She showed me what the 
good life really means 
I know you've had a love like hers 
yeah, in your dreams 

CHORUS 

Oh I'm telling you now boys 
It does get better than this.
