That's What I Get For Lovin' You
Kent Blazy/Neil Thrasher 

I start every day with a smile on my face 
And the feel of a kiss on my lips 
When the world plays to rough I can find a healin' touch 
Life's never been better than this 

That's what I get for lovin' you 
Heaven's right here in my hands 
A dream that is real and a heart that beats true 
That's what I get for lovin' you 

There was a time I walked outside the lines 
I only thought of myself 
Then you sat me down turned my head around 
Now I put you before everything else 

That's what I get for lovin' you 
Heaven's right here in my hands 
A dream that is real and a heart that beats true 
That's what I get for lovin' you 

Love is a feelin' I never knew much about 
Forever's a word I never said until now 

That's what I get for lovin' you 
Heaven's right here in my hands 
A dream that is real and a heart that beats true 
That's what I get for lovin' you 

That's what I get for lovin' you 
Heaven's right here in my hands 
A dream that is real and a heart that beats true 
That's what I get for lovin' you
