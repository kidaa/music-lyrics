I'm Already Gone 

I suppose I could stop it now 
Say I didn't need it anyhow 
Just walk away and let it go 
Tip my hat and try to play it cool 
Keep myself from being made a fool 
I could pretend you don't already know that 

Chorus 

I'm already gone 
I never thought I'd cross over the line 
But it's way too late 
Your love is just too strong 
And I'm already gone 

There's no doubt about how I feel 
Both my hands are off the wheel 
So now it's really up to you 
This is something that I've never done 
You know I've always been the first to run 
Girl this time there's nothing I can do 
'Cause 

Chorus 

Bridge: I tried too hard to keep the walls from fallin 
I found a hiding place and told my heart to wait 
But 

Chorus
