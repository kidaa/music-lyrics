I Was Meant To Be With You 

It started out when Adam 
first laid his eyes on Eve 
Something passed between them 
that came down through history 
Carried by an angel 
Whispered on the Breeze 
It waited till the time was right 
Then it found you and me 

CHORUS 

It must be written on a block of stone 
Buried by sand in an ancient land 
Carved upon the side of the oldest tree 
It must be more than just a dream come true 
Yes I believe the good Lord always knew 
I was meant to be with you 

Standing here beside you 
In my heart I know 
This love that we were meant to share 
Began so long ago 
As sure as rain was made to fall 
And mountains made to stand 
I was born to be with you 
There was nothing left to chance 

CHORUS 

From the beginning to the end of time 
I was to be yours, you were to be mine
