Kentucky Mine 

His eyes are greener than the meadows 
His hair is greyer than a ghost 
His lungs are blacker than the shadows 
That dance in circles down below 

You see them every Monday morning 
Electric halos light their way 
Five days of widows mourning 
But Friday rolls the stone away 

Chorus 

Kentucky mine, doing time 
Never see the light of day 
Kentucky mine, stand in line 
Just to dig your own grave 

From coal dust they make a living 
To coal dust they will return 
The earth is good but unforgiving 
And someone's got to keep the fire burnin' 
Daddy says, Listen to me, 
Do not follow where my footsteps lead 

Chorus 

And everything he said was true 
But what's a Kentucky boy like me to do? 

Chorus
