Sweet Summer 

He had a freezer full of bomb pops 
Push ups, drum sticks and dreamcicles 
And a paint chipped changed box 
Full of sticky quarters, dimes and nickles 
It was automatic when we heard that song 
Run home and get your money before he's gone 

Lookin' underneath the Chrysler in the driveway 
Hey, dad what ya doin' 
The smell of summer twilight 
There's always somebody barbeque'n 
Truth or dare with the kdis on our road 
Hide and seek till your mama called you home 

Chorus 

Sweet summer, yeah I remember that 
Sweet summer, let me take you back 

Her mom and mine were best friends 
And she was the youngest of three daughters 
An angel on a pink Schwinn, my first crush 
Those days were never too long 
And never too hot 
Even though I was out of school 
I was learnin' a lot 

Chorus 

Bridge 

There's not a day that I don't remember 
From the end of May to the first of September 

Chorus
