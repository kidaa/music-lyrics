I'm going out of my mind these days
Like I'm walking 'round in a haze
I can't think straight, I can't concentrate
And I need a shave

I go to work and I look tired
The boss man says son you're gonna get fired
This ain't your style
And behind my coffee cup 
I just smile

Chorus
What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm in
Spending all my time with you
There's nothing else I'd rather do
What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in
'Cause I can't get enough
Can't stop the hunger for your love
What a beautiful, what a beautiful mess I'm in

This morning put salt in my coffee
I put my shoes on the wrong feet
Losing my mind I swear 
You might be the death of me
But I don't care

Repeat chorus

Bridge
Is it your eyes, is it your smile
All I know is that you're driving me wild

Repeat chorus 2x
