That's Just That 

He's not talkin' and she's not speakin' 
And they're not budgin' and that's just that 
He's just fumin' and she's just steamin' 
And they're not listening to the fact 
That hearts are cryin' and love is dyin' 
And neither wants to understand 
Cause he's not talkin' and she's not speakin' 
And they're not budgin' 

1st Chorus 
But they used to stroll in the rain 
Then build a fire and pull the shades 
They kissed their way all through the dark 
She's whisper all her deepest dreams 
He'd tell her she's his everything 
She'd lay her head down on his heart 
They were so in love 
Yeah they were so in love 

He's not talkin' and she's not speakin' 
And they're not budgin' and that's just that 
Hope is crumblin' and walls are tumblin' 
It's all just jumpin right off the tracks 
And doors are slammin' and heels are stampin' 
And they're both walkin' their separate ways 
And he's not talkin' and she's not speakin' 
And they're not budgin' 

2nd Chorus 
But they used to jump in his car 
They're side by side without a care 
Drive till the scenery was right 
Lay on a blanket in the ground 
And watch the clouds blow around 
Just holdin' each other tight 
They were so in love 
Yeah they were so in love 

If he'd start talkin' and she'd start speakin' 
And they'd start budgin' they'd start to see 
That's it's worth keepin' and they're worth savin' 
And they're not far from what they need 
To start forgivin' and start relivin' 
All the lvoe they used to have 
But he's not talkin' and she's not speakin' 
And he's just fumin' and she's just steamin' 
And he's so stubborn and she's not budgin' 
And they're not speakin' and that's just that
