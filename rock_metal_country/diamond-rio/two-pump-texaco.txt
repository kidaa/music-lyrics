Two Pump Texaco 
Michael Dulaney/Neil Thrasher 

He was wipin' motor oil off her dipstick 
She was pullin' on the hair that got caught in her lipstick 
And with the smell of her perfume he forgot the smell of gasoline 
As he was toppin' off her tank she said, "How far to Abilene?" 

He sees 'em come 
He sees 'em go 
From the island of his 
Two pump Texaco 

There's a rusted out Rambler up on the rack 
And a pile of bald Goodyear's out in the back 
He meets families on vacation, bikers and businessmen 
He calls 'em "friend" but he'll probably never see 'em again 
No he won't 

He sees 'em come 
He sees 'em go 
From the island of his 
Two pump Texaco 
He keeps 'em moving 
On down the road 
Come back real soon 
To his two pump Texaco 

He's heard about those big city shop-n-go stations 
With twenty automated self-service machines 
He just feels sorry for them big city people 
They must not know what service really means 
He's got a sign that says 

Last chance stop for at least two hundred miles 
Maps, gas, soda pop, 
Lucky Strikes and Moon Pies 
Yeah, he's a third generation filler-up, full service man 
He thanks the Lord for that "star" in the sky and the grease on his hands 
Yeah he does 

He sees 'em come 
He sees 'em go 
From the island of his 
Two pump Texaco 
It's like a place we used to know 
Come back real soon 
To his two pump Texaco
