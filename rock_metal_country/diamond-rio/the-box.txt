Jack's sittin' back in a pitch black box
When some light shines through a crack in the corner
Will he take the risk break out of this
Place that he hates or will he just sit and wonder
If he springs out there's no doubt that his system might be shocked
But he's afraid what it might take for him to unlock
The box

1st chorus
You can be free if you want to 
Travel outside the lines
If you dare to be individual
No tellin' who's inside
The box

Jacklyn's got green hair, piercings everywhere
She's not scared to be different
She does what she loves above all
There's not any walls in her environment
She's herself no one else she knows you only get one time
To wear your shoes in life and view the world from outside
The box

2nd chorus
You can be free if you want to 
Travel outside the lines
If you dare to be individual
No tellin' who's inside
The box

Repeat chorus

The box 
The box
