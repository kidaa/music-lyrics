Norma Jean Riley 
Monty Powell/Dan Truman/Rob Honey 

Wish I had a car, top rolled down, the music up loud 
Follow that girl all over town and see 
Norma Jean Riley's gonna notice me 
Wish I had a dog, seen her in the park with a puppy on a string 
Looking so cute maybe sooner or later we'd meet 
Norma Jean Riley's gonna talk to me 

Everybody says fool, fool nothin' you can do 
Never gonna see her with the likes of you 
I say watch and see 
Norma Jean Riley's gonna notice me 

Oughta learn to dance, with the hottest moves and the latest styles 
Get her on the dance floor and after awhile you'll see 
Norma Jean Riley's gonna dance with me 

Everybody says fool, fool nothin' you can do 
Never gonna see her with the likes of you 
I say watch and see 
Norma Jean Riley's gonna notice me 

Gonna write a song, sing about her hair, her lips and her eyes 
Bring her to tears with my heartfelt honesty 
Norma Jean Riley's gonna fall for me 

Everybody says fool, fool nothin' you can do 
Never gonna see her with the likes of you 
I say watch and see 
Norma Jean Riley's gonna fall for me 

Everybody says fool, fool nothin' you can do 
Never gonna see her with the likes of you 
I say watch and see 
Norma Jean Riley's gonna marry me
