Hear I Go Fallin' 

Yeah I'm lookin'...Aint' everybody lookin' 
For that one of a kind, one in a million 
Match made in heaven that we all know 
Probably don't exist, what's that... 
Yeah I'm a little jaded, over it, cynical 
Maybe even a litle bitter about all the chances I've missed 

'Cuase I've seen it all come and go before 
I'm sure I'll see it again 
But if I thought for one instant it might be love 
I'd be the first one jumpin' in 

Chorus 

Here I go fallin' 
The minute love starts callin' 
Here I go fallin' 
For all it's worth, for better or worse 
Like I've never been burned and I won't get hurt 

Yeah I know it's kinda fast, I only met her last night 
So what makes me think this one's gonna be any different? 
Let's just say I've got a real good feeling about it 
Is it meant to be? Do I think it's gonna last? 
Don't ask me, I ain't going there, I ain't touching that 
But I'll tell you this 

Everytime I get close to her 
I can't think of nothin' else 
She's in every thought, every dream I ever dream 
I can't stop myself 

Chorus 

It was sure nice talkin' to you but I really gotta run 
'Cause I think I finally found her man---Here she comes 

Chorus
