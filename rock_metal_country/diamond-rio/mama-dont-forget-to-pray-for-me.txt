Mama Don't Forget To Pray For Me 
Larry Shell/Larry Cordle 

Well hello, it's good to hear your voice 
I hate to call so late, but I didn't have a choice 
I'm calling you from Dallas, headed for L.A. 
I wish I had more time to talk, there's so much to say 

No I ain't forgot how I was raised 
But I'm livin' way too fast 
It's a roller coaster ride, up and down 
My new job is going great, I'm headed for the top 
I should be happy but somehow I'm not 
Sometimes I think the devil has got me by the sleeve 
Oh, Mama don't forget to pray for me 

Tell me how is the weather? 
Have you put the garden out? 
Are the dogwoods bloomin' out behind the house? 
No I'm not sick, there's nothin' wrong, don't wake up Dad 
I just thought of you and home and got a little sad 

No I ain't forgot how I was raised 
But I'm livin' way too fast 
It's a roller coaster ride, up and down 
My new job is going great, I'm headed for the top 
I should be happy but somehow I'm not 
Oh, sometimes I think the devil has got me by the sleeve 
Oh, Mama don't forget to pray for me 
Oh, Mama don't forget to pray for me
