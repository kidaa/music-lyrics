The lights of the city 
Look good when you're leaving 
You don't even count what you lost 

The streets and their madness 
Make my heart so sad 
They will never be worth what they cost 

Take me to the mountain 
I want to see the other side 

Oh give me one golden day 
And I won't care where I've been 
Oh let this world slip away 
And I'll start all over again 
I will start all over again 

I'm through with the struggle 
And tired of the trouble 
It's high time I left it behind 

I've walked the mean streets 
Just counting my heartbeats 
It's easy to lose your mind 

I'll break the chains that bind me 
For my soul is deep and wide 

Oh give me one golden day 
And I won't care where I've been 
Oh let this world slip away 
And I'll start all over again 
I will start all over again 

As sure as the sun keeps rising on me 
I'll find a place where I ought to be 

Oh give me one golden day 
And I won't care where I've been 
Oh let this world slip away 
And I'll start all over again 
I will start all over again 
And I won't care where I've been 
Oh let this world slip away 
And I'll start all over again 
I will start all over againOver again
