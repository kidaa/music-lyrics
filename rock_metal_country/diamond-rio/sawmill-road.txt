Sawmill Road 

Me and Billy Joe and Mary Beth 
Were raised up on the path 
of righteousness 
Made a solemn vow that 
we'd always be close 
And never wander far from 
Sawmill Road 

As the years went by the 
world began to change 
One by one we outgrew 
those childhood games 
Momma cooked and cleaned 
and worried 'bout our souls 
We got into beer and cars 
and rock 'n' roll 

Chorus 

We knew Jesus was the answer 
And Elvis was the king 
Blue Suede Shoes and Rock of Ages 
Were the songs we learned to sing 
Innocence went out of style 
And we just watched it go 
Yesterday got left beneath 
The dust on Sawmill Road 

Billy Joe went to Saigon for Uncle Sam 
Now I go to see him, he don't know who I am 
One a year I get a card from Mary Beth 
She's with husband number four somewhere out west 
I still live in this old house where we were raised 
On this red dirt road the county never paved 
Now I watch my kids and worry 'bout their souls 
And pray they'll never wander far from Sawmill Road 

CHORUS 

Me and Billy Joe and Mary Beth 
Were raised up on the path of righteousness.
