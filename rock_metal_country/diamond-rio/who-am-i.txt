Who Am I 
Randy Albright/Debi Cochran 

There must have been some realignment 
Between the sun and the stars 
That changed my fate the day you changed my life 
I was destined to be nobody special 
Till you saw somebody in me 
And made me believe that I could be that lucky guy 
Still it's hard to understand 
How I became the man that I am 

But who am I 
To be loved by you 
The way that I am 
The way that you do 
I don't deserve 
A love this true 
Who am I 
To be loved by you 

You could be waltzing in Paris 
Or sipping champagne on some yacht 
But here you are in my arms tonight 
It's more than my heart can fathom 
That this is where you choose to be 
The rest of your life and the rest of your love is mine 
You say you have no doubts 
Me I'm still trying to figure it out 

But who am I 
To be loved by you 
The way that I am 
The way that you do 
I don't deserve 
A love this true 
Who am I 
To be loved by you 
Who am I 
To be loved by you
