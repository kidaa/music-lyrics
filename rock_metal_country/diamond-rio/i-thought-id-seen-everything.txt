I Thought I'd Seen Everything 
R.J. "Mutt" Lange/Huey Lewis 

Here I am a single guy 
I've seen a lot in this crazy life 
There you are, what can I say 
I guess you took my breath away 
Something in your eyes took me by surprise 
'Cause when I looked at you something you do 
Is telling me more than I ever knew, oh baby 

I thought I'd seen everything, 'til I saw you 
I thought I'd seen everything baby I thought I knew 
Now here I am alone with you 
What am I supposed to do 
Should I stay or should I go 
Something tells me I should know 

It's something in your touch that makes me feel so much 
You took me by surprise I realize 
And now I can't believe my eyes, oh baby 

I thought I'd seen everything, 'til I saw you 
I thought I'd seen everything, baby I thought I knew 
I've been around the world, seen a lot of girls 
In and out of love 'til I had enough 

I thought I had everything, 'til I had you, oh baby 
Baby let your lovin' take me all the way 
I thought I'd seen everything, 'til I saw you 
I thought I'd seen everything, baby I thought I knew 
I thought I'd seen everything, oh baby
