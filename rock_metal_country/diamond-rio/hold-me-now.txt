Hold Me Now
Gordon Kennedy/Tommy Sims 

Oopsie daisy I'm losin' my mind 
Hold me now, hold me now 
Clock on the wall says 
I'm outta time 
Hold me now, hold me now 

I gotta reason but 
I'm all outta rhyme 
Hold me now, hold me now 
Sometimes the answers are just so hard to find 
Hold me now 

When my grip on the day 
Starts slippin' away 
If I'm gonna fall at all 
I'm gonna fall in love with you 

Here I go I'm fallin' again 
Hold me now, hold me now 
It always happens when your love comes in 
Hold me now, hold me now 

My hopes and dreams have been left out in the cold 
Hold me now, hold me now 
Feels like the world is spinnin' outta control 
Hold me now 

When my grip on the day when my grip on the day 
Starts slippin' away starts slippin' away 
If I'm gonna fall at all 
I'm gonna fall in love with you 

Here I go I'm fallin' again 
Hold me now, hold me now 
It all gets better when your love comes in 
Hold me now 

I'm gonna fall in love with you 

Here I go I'm fallin' again 
Hold me now, hold me now 
It always happens when your love comes in 
Hold me now, hold me now 

Here I go I'm fallin' again 
Hold me now, hold me now 
It all gets better when your love comes in 
Hold me now, hold me now 
Hold me now
