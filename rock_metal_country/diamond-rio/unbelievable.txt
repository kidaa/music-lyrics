Unbelievable
Al Anderson/Jeffrey Steele 

She's so kissable, huggable, lovable, unbelievable 
She's a mouthful of anything and everything a man could want 
She ain't typical, she's unpredictable, she's available, it's a miracle 
How my heart stumbled into someone so kissable, huggable, lovable, unbelievable 

Up 'til now my life has been so lonely and boring 
I never thought I would find someone so 

Elegant, intelligent, heaven sent, all my money spent 
I put a big down payment on that itty bitty diamond ring 
She's so beautiful, it's indisputable, it's undeniable, she's got-to-havable 
She's music to my ears, and makes my heart sing, so kissable, huggable, lovable, unbelievable 

There's so many things 
I want to tell her 
Like I love her 
But every time I talk 
I start to stutter 

She's so elegant, intelligent, heaven sent, all my money spent 
I put a big down payment on that itty bitty diamond ring 
She's so beautiful, it's indisputable, it's undeniable, she's got-to-havable 
She's music to my ears, and makes my heart sing, kissable, huggable, lovable, unbelievable 

Kissable, huggable, lovable, unbelievable 
Kissable, huggable, lovable, unbelievable
