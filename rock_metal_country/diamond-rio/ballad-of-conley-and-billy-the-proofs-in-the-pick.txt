Ballad Of Conley And Billy The Proof's In The Picken' 

Screamn' whitewall tires and a guitar by his side 
Billy's got the fever as he rolls on thru the night 
Some were born to listen, some were born to play 
He was lightning on the highstrings and thunder on the bass 

Chorus 

He could play it high, he could play it low 
He could make it cry, he could make it moan 
He knows when push comes to shove 
the proof's in the pickin' 

In a smoky little tavern just off of Bourbon Street 
Tobacco stained fingers waited on the down beat 
Conley was the master, the undisputed king 
He'd ruled the town for thirty years 
with an army of six strings 

Chorus 

Sometimes after midnight Billy drives through New Orleans 
Straight to the French Quarter there's a man he has to see 
The music is a raging like a city that's on fire 
Billy felt just like an altar boy at the feet of a higher power 
Conley watched as Billy walked across the room 
Opened his case and started a tune 
The whole club was silent and the lights were turned down low 
Billy stepped up on the stage and Conley whispered Go son, go  

Chorus 

Conley held his hand up, no one made a sound 
And he handed Bill his old archtop and stepped into the crowd 
Billy played it soft, Billy played it sad 
Then he made it talk and in came the band 
Soon the room was shaking before Billy's wall of sound 
And just a block off Bourbon Street, a new king's been crowned. 

Chorus
