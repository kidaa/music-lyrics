This State Of Mind 

Chorus 

Oh I can't go on living in this state of mind 
It's stay and go crazy or leave it all behind 
One way or another I'm gonna cross that line 
'Cause I can't go on living in this state of mind 

There's no way to avoid her 
Living in this tiny Texas town 
So I'm packing up my broken heart 
Leaving and I pray I don't break down 
Well I really love the Lone Star 
But I can't stand seeing her around 

Chorus 

I'm outside Amarillo 
Feeling better every mile I roll 
And when I hit Glen Rio 
That's as far as her memory will go 
Well, running from a woman 
might sound foolish I know 

Chorus
