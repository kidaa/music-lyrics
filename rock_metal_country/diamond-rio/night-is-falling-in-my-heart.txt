Night Is Falling In My Heart 
Dennis Linde  

Won't you please turn up the lights  
I can't hardly see  
Thank you kindly but that don't help  
Maybe it's just me  
It seems I've had this problem since  
My baby packed up to leave  

CHORUS  

You see she used to be my sunshine  
Now we're far apart  
Night is fallin' in my heart  
Oh, the light is slowly fading  
Skies are growing dark  
Night is fallin' in my heart  

Could you pull those curtains back  
And let the morning in  
What's that you say? Oh is that a fact?  
Well, it still seems mighty dim  
I guess I'll just have to live this way  
Unless my baby come back again  

CHORUS  

And as the last ray of love  
Slowly disappears  
Alone in this endless night  
I just see one thing clear  

CHORUS
