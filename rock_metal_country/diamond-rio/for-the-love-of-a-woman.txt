For The Love Of A Woman 

I walked half way across this town 
Singing in the pouring rain 
I knew someway somehow 
I had to see your smiling face 
Some people need some time 
Some people need their space 
But when you're not in my arms 
You're too far away for 

Chorus 

The love of a woman 
The love of a woman like you 
The love of a woman 
There's nothing so strong and so true 
I prayed to God above 
And I've searched my whole life through 
For the love of a woman 
The love of a woman like you 

My friends all ask me why 
I lay my heart on the line 
But somewhere deep down inside 
They know exactly why 
When it don't go like you plan 
There's nothing that hurts so bad 
But when it works like it should 
There's nothing on earth known to man like 

Chorus 

Tag 
I prayed to God above 
And I've searched my whole life through 
For the love of a woman 
The love of a woman like you 
For the love of a woman 
The love of a woman like you
