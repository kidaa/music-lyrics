This Romeo Ain't Got Julie Yet 

Your mamma thinks I'm lazy, 
your daddy runs down my name 
But you said you'd love me, 
come sunshine or come rain 
Well I'll hold you to it Julie, 
don't you fret and pout 
This story has a happy ending 
even though for now 

CHORUS 

This Romeo ain't got Julie yet 
I love you so and you can bet 
I'd follow you to Timbuktu 
like Scarlett followed Rhett 
But this Romeo ain't got Julie yet 

Just meet me 'round the old man's 
barn 'bout ten o'clock tonight 
I'll have my chevy humming 
and take you for a ride 
Throw the dog a big ole bone 
and make sure your bags are packed 
We're headed for that silver moon 
and may never come back 

CHORUS 

Yeah, I'd follow you to Timbuktu 
like Scarlett followed Rhett 
But this Romeo ain't got Julie yet
