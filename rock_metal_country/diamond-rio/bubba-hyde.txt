Bubba Hyde 
Craig Wiseman/Gene Nelson  

Barney works down at the A P  
He drives a baby blue A.M.C.  
Ain't missed of day of work in 13 years  
He's a fire department volunteer  

He's got a yard that's always just been mowed  
Collected stamps since he was 10 years old  
You've never seen a more regular guy  
But when the sun goes down on Friday night  

Chorus  

Slaps on his Hai Karate after shave  
Puts on his Elvis jacket custom-made  
Gets in his patent leather zebra boots  
Fires up his super sport Malibu  
He burns the rubber 'cross the county line  
A honky tonkin' fool till closing time  
You ought to see him metamorphosize  
From Barney Jekyll into Bubba Hyde  

Monday morning it's a suit and tie  
Attention shoppers there's a two-for-one buy  
Tuesday afternoon he mans the wheel  
Makes his round in the bookmobile  

He's got a Wednesday night canasta game  
Thursday's the tourney at the bowling lanes  
His friends would freak out if they only knew  
The party animal he turns into  

Chorus  

You oughta see him metamorphosize  
From Barney Jekyll into Bubba Hyde
