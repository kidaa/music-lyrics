Hearts Against The Wind 

Hearts that love where no love grows 
Are gifts with no return 
They know the coldest wind that blows 
Where once a fire burned 

Chorus 

So blow... 
Hearts against the wind 
They just blow... 
Hearts that ever break 
They just won't mend 
Without breaking again 

Sow ye not the seeds of doubt 
That fade and fall in time 
For in the end your love will out 
And every star outshine 

Chorus 

So blow... 
Hearts against the wind 
They just blow... 
Hearts that ever break 
They just won't mend 
Without breaking again
