I'm watching you go from room to room
With all your boxes and your broom
Packing up, sweeping out and taking down
From off the wall
Everything that's part of us
Tear my whole world down if you must
Don't even leave one little speck of dust
Make sure you've got it all

Chorus
Take my heart, take my soul
Take it all with you when you go
Just leave the floor here to catch me when I fall
You stole my pride and dignity
You took it all away from me
Take one last look around, girl, before you leave
Make sure you've got it all

Don't even leave one photograph
The memory of one smile or laugh
Check the closet up in the attic and down the hall
Take your time, take your rings
Take the sandbox and the swings
Without a family they're just things
Make sure you've got it all

Repeat chorus

Tag
Take one last look around, girl, before you leave
Make sure you've got it all
