Holdin'
Kelly Garrett/Craig Wiseman 

Parked down on lover's leap 
Steaming up his old heap 
Two lovers stare up at the stars 
Somewhere in the lights below 
Two houses all aglow 
Parents wondering where on earth they are 
'Cause their folks have tried to tell them 
This is way too serious 
And while their mommas are waiting up they're 

Holdin', lovin', kissin', huggin' 
Come whatever may they keep 
Goin', dreamin', smilin', believin' 
That nothin' matters like this love they're holdin' 

A few years and some wedding vows 
A quarter-acre and a little white house 
More than they can well afford 
And those easy payments are getting tough 
All the overtime ain't enough 
Still they couldn't ask for more 
'Cause that old hill that they've been climbin' 
Might be gettin' steep 
Oh, but they don't seem to mind it they keep 

Holdin', lovin', kissin', huggin' 
Come whatever may they keep 
Goin', dreamin', smilin', believin' 
That nothin' matters like this love they're holdin' 

As they rock their newborn baby fast asleep 
They know the most important lesson they can teach 
Keep on 
Holdin', lovin', kissin', huggin' 
Come whatever may they keep 
Goin, dreamin', smilin', believin' 
That nothing matters, like this love 
They're holdin', dreamin', goin', knowin', believin', 
Nothing matters like this love they're holdin' 
Just keep on holdin'
