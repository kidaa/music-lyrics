You Ain't In It 

Some folks said I was getting' well 
But through the tears I couldn't tell 
I could not see past yesterday 
Cause your memory stood there in my way 

A lonely mind plays funny tricks 
Works on things that can't be fixed 
It's bound to dwell on what you miss 
Like a midnight touch or a morning kiss 

Chorus

It's still hard to face a day if you ain't in it 
But I had to draw the line, a million tears 
is a man's limit 
No, I don't expect your memory to let me 
Ever forget it 
But once in a while I live through a minute 
And you ain't in it 

It didn't take a clock to alarm me 
I was always up, I'd never sleep 
Scared to death I'd dream of you 
That's more'n I wanted to put my old 
heart through 

A big dark cloud followed me around 
Didn't dare look up or I'd have drowned 
Thought you took that sun with you 
But today my curtain let a little peep slip through 

Chorus
