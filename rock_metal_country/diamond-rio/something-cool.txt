Something cool, hey, won't you pour me
Something cool, set one up for me
Anything will do
Just make it something cool
Something sad, hey, won't you play me
Something sad, play one that slays me
Play me something blue
To go with something cool

Bridge
There's an old flame burning in me
Like the sun in a July sky
Seems to me, I'm always thirsty 
Since she left me high and dry

Something cool
Something cool

Repeat Bridge

Something cool, hey, won't you pour me
Something cool, set one up for me
Anything will do
Just make it something cool
