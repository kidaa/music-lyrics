She says, you know the monkey bar rules
As she kisses away his playground bruise
You don't have to skip a bar each time
To make it to the other side
She picked him up from out of the sand
Then tied the shoelace that read, Superman

Chorus
We all fall down
It's the gettin' back up that really counts
We live and we learn
To help someone up when it's their turn
In life there's only one guarantee
Your feet won't always be on the ground
'Cause we all fall down

She says I know what you're goin' through
As she talks to the door of her daughter's room
Your heart feels like it's broken in two
But, baby, I'm here for you
The door opened and she stepped inside
She put her arms around her and said, it's ok to cry

Repeat chorus

He's forty-five and his job is gone
Cleans out his desk and he heads on home
Sees his kids out playin' in the yard
It's been a while since he's been hit so hard
He's as scared as a man can be
He tells his wife and she says, honey, look at me

Repeat chorus

We all fall down
But you got to get back up
