What More Do You Want From Me 
Bob Regan/Mark D. Sanders 

I gave you my heart for years and years 
What more do you want from me 
My laughter and my lonely tears 
What more do you want from me 

I've been faithful to you beginning to end 
Isn't that enough 
I gave you my all and I gave it again 
What more do you want 

Oh love, what else could there be 
Oh love, what more do you want from me 

I've been fooled by what I believed was you 
Oh what a sweet disguise 
I pledged my heart forever true 
'Cause I thought it was you in her eyes 

Oh love, what else could there be 
Oh love, what more do you want from me 

Oh give me a clue, what is it with you 
Is there somethin' that I can't see 
What more do you need what more could there be 
What more do you want 

Oh love, what else could there be 
Oh love, what more do you want from me 
Oh love, what else could there be 
Oh love, what more do you want from me 
Oh love, what more do you want from me
