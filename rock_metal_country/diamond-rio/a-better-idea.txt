He hung the moon
Raised the sun
Made the lions walk
And the rivers run
Then he sat down, looked around
And thought a bit
Said, it's all good but that ain't quite it
So with his mighty hand he created man
And then

Chorus
He had a better idea
A much better idea
He made an angel like sweet perfume
A heavenly smile, someone who
Can light up a room with a heart so true
I thank God he created me
But when I look at you I see
He had a better idea

Thought I'd have to face
This world alone
Just walk through life
Without a hand to hold
And I accepted that
I said in fact it might be nice
To live my way
Now that's paradise
Be he knew all along
I was wrong

Repeat chorus 2x

He had a better idea
God had a better idea
