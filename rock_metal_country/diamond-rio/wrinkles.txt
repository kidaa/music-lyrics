Gettin' out of the tub all drawn up like a raisin
Showed my fingers to my Daddy while he was shavin'
Said look at my toes Dad what's wrong with my skin
Will this go away, will I be normal again

Well he picked me up and set me down on the hamper
Wiped off his face while he gave me the answer
For the first time I noticed the lines in his grin
As he dabbed a little foam on the end of my chin, he said

Chorus
Those wrinkles ain't nothin' to be scared of
They're just a product of time and true love
Some are gonna come and go
Some are gonna come and stay
Son, you're still young, you're gonna be ok

Well, I walked down the hall, saw my Mom gettin ready
For a long over due date, dinner with Daddy
She was cussin' those crows feet, didn't know I was listenin'
Started talkin' 'bout her younger years
And how much she missed them and I said

2nd Chorus
Those wrinkles ain't nothin' to be scared of
They're just a product of time and true love
Some are gonna come and go
Some are gonna come and stay
Mom you still look young, you're gonna be ok

As I get a little older, I'm startin' to get a few
And I'm sure I gave Mom and Dad at least one or two
We're all gonna have 'em, there ain't no doubt
But those wrinkles in life ain't nothin' you can't iron out

3rd Chorus
Those wrinkles ain't nothin' to be scared of
They're just a product of time and true love
Some are gonna come and go
Some are gonna come and stay
I still feel young, I'm gonna be ok

Bridge
Those wrinkles ain't nothin' to be scared of
They're just a product of time and true love
