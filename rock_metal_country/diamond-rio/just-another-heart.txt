Just Another Heart 
Skip Ewing/Tim Johnson 

You treat love like a game 
But you don't play by any rules 
You keep an ace held up your sleeve 
For any unsuspectin' fool 
I thought I would be different 
So I did not expect 
That to you I'd be another 
Heart in the deck 

Just another heart 
For you to shuffle around 
Just a little part 
Of a bigger game that's going down 
I don't like this deal 
So I'll get out while I still can 
I don't want to be just another heart in your hand 

Like a riverboat gambler 
Someday you'll lose your touch 
To a smooth operator 
Who cheats you out of love 
When your diamonds turn to teardrops 
When your gold begins to rust 
It's then you will know this feeling of running out of trust I'm 

Just another heart 
For you to shuffle around 
Just a little part 
Of a bigger game that's going down 
I don't like this deal 
So I'll get out while I still can 
I don't want to be just another heart in your hand 

I can't take anymore 
Of what you're not giving me 
I can live with a lot 
But I don't want to be 

Just another heart 
For you to shuffle around 
Just a little part 
Of a bigger game that's going down 
I don't like this deal 
So I'll get out while I still can 
I don't want to be just another heart in your hand 

I don't like this deal 
So I'll get out while I still can 
'Cause I don't want to be 
Just another heart in your hand 

You treat love like a game 
But your don't play by any rules
