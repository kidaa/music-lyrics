In A Week Or Two 
James House/Gary Burr 

In a week or two 
I would have been ready 
I would have known what to say 
But I missed my chance 
When the words "I love you" 
Came just a little too late 

In a week or two 
I was gonna bring you diamonds 
In a week or two 
A long, long string of pearls and 
We would've run down to the river at night 
Sailed away, just me and you 
In a week or two 

A little more time 
Was all I needed 
But somehow Fall became Spring 
But put off today 
What you can do tomorrow 
Sometimes you don't do a thing 

In a week or two 
I was gonna bring you diamonds 
In a week or two 
A long, long string of pearls and 
We would've run down to the river at night 
Sailed away, just me and you 
In a week or two 

These words in my heart never had a chance to be heard 
But I'm telling you now for all that it's worth 

In a week or two 
I was gonna bring you diamonds 
In a week or two 
A long, long string of pearls and 
We would've run down to the river at night 
Sailed away, just me and you 
In a week or two
