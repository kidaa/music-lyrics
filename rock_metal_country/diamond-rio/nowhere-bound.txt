Nowhere Bound 

You save up your money, buy you some shoes 
The highway's calling and she's right on cue 
Just when you thought you had it beat 
You're leaving town on a one-way street 

CHORUS 

It's a hard, hard lesson 
But you're gonna have to learn it 
It's a long cold swim up against the current 
And somewhere down the line 
you're gonna have to turn it around 
'Cause boy right now you're nowhere bound 

Her words still echo thru your mind 
But fade away as you cross the county line 
Running from trouble or from the truth 
It doesn't matter either way you lose 

CHORUS 

Well you walk ten miles just to make new tracks 
But you turn around and find that it's twenty miles back 
And it's never gonna change it you keep leaving 
Your heart's gonna break, but never break even 

Where to now, do you know? 
One thing's for certain 
Gonna reap just what you sow 
And all you planted was heartache and pain 
Don't look now but it looks like rain.
