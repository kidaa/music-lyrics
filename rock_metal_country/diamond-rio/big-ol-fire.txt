One of these days you'll turn around
And wanna get out of this someday town
Well people gonna laugh you know what they'll say
You're never gonna get away
Well there'll be fear and there'll be doubt
But they're just things that'll slow you down
Just put 'em all in a great big pile
And stand back

Chorus
And burn, baby like a big ol' fire
Build it up with your one desire
And one of these days you just might change their minds
Shine the light, blind 'em by
A big ol' fire
A big ol' fire

And one of these days you'll find someone
Who lights you up like the rising sun
But he's been hurt and he won't feel
Like handin' you a heart of steel
Well don't you run now just you stay
'Cause you're the one that can melt away
The loneliness down in his heart
Just take him in your arms

2nd Chorus
And burn baby like a big ol' fire
Build it up with your one desire
And one of these days you just might find the love
You're dreaming of, risin' up a big ol' fire

Bridge
And when you get to where you're goin'
All you'll leave behind is ashes smolderin'
When you find the love you've always wanted
Never let it die

Repeat 1st chorus
