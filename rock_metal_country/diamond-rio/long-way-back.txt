Long Way Back 
Bill Rice/Sharon Rice 

Sitting in a cafe at the corner of Broad and Grand 
Stirring up old memories and the coffee in my hand 
The waitress stopped and asked me 
Honey do you know what you want 
I had to stop myself from telling her the truth 
What I really need is another chance with you 
But this temper train I'm on just ran away too fast 
It's a long, long, way back to you baby 
It's a long, long, way back 

The neon clock is humming showing sign of wear 
I've lost all sense of time since I've been sitting here 
The waitress asked again 
Is there something else you need 
I need to take the hands off that clock above my head 
Reset the time and take back everything I said 
If I could turn around, then I would erase my tracks 
But it's a long, long way back, to you baby 
It's a long, long way back 

It is a lonely road a fool travels down 
I guess I oughta know 'cause that's where I'm headed now 
And it's a long, it's a long, way back 

Sitting at the cafe just Ruby Lee and me 
I get feeling she's waiting on me to leave 
She stopped askin' hours ago if I know what I want 

Yeah but it's a long, long way back, to you baby 
It's a long, long way back 
I miss you darlin' 
It's a long, long way back
