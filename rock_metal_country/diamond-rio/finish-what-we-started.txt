Finish What We Started 

Lyin' on our backs we stared at the stars 
Tryin' to count them or guess how far 
I still remember the way that it felt 
The night we hung our dreams out on Orion's belt 
The moonlight danced out on the water's edge 
We started a walk that hasn't ended yet 

Chorus 

And step by step and mile by mile 
Taking each turn together 
Following the signs that point to forever 
And side by side 
True and tenderhearted 
We'll finish what we started 

The road we have traveled has sometimes been steep 
And we've crossed troubled waters that were raging and deep 
But with memories to lean on and love as our guide 
There's no path too winding, no river too wide 
One foot in front of the other each day 
Keeping a promise that two young lovers made 

Chorus
