She Misses Him On Sunday The Most 
Steven Dale Jones/Bobby Tomberlin 

They were quite a pair 
The way that love should be 
They still held hands 
For the world to see 
She's thankful that she had him all those years 
But she still has days she can't hold back the tears 

She misses their Monday night bowling league 
When they'd wear their matching shirts 
She misses their Wednesday night dinner out 
As soon as he got home from work 
And Saturday morning sleeping late 
Holding each other close 
But she misses him on Sunday the most 

She sits alone on that same old pew again 
His tenor voice still echoes now and then 
It brings back all those memories of him there by her side 
What she'd give for one more Sunday drive 

She misses their Monday night bowling league 
When they'd wear their matching shirts 
She misses their Wednesday night dinner out 
As soon as he got home from work 
And Saturday morning sleeping late 
Holding each other close 
But she misses him on Sunday the most 
But she misses him on Sunday the most
