Oh Me, Oh My, Sweet Baby 

Chorus 

Oh me, oh my, sweet baby said goodbye 
Oh no one else could take her place in my life 
Ooo we had something good 
So tell me why she would 
Go and make me cry, oh me, 
Oh my, sweet baby said goodbye 

I remember how she'd hold me 
And say she'd stay forever true 
Back then the future looked so rosey 
But tonight it's lookin' mighty blue 

Chorus 

Don't know what I didn't give her 
That she gets from someone new 
I only know how much I miss her 
And wish she hadn't broke my heart in two 

Chorus
