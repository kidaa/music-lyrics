I Know How The River Feels 
Steven Dale Jones/Amy Powers 

They say for everyone, there's that certain one 
Out there, somewhere 
I'd been looking hard, searching every heart 
Getting nowhere 
Didn't know I was making my way to you 

Now I know how the river feels 
When it reaches the sea 
And finally finds the place 
It was always meant to be 
Holding fast, home at last 
Knowing the journey's through 
Lying here with you 
I know how the river feels 

Miles of loneliness, now make perfect sense 
Here beside you 
Tears like water fall, it was worth it all 
Just to find you 
And yours are the last arms I'll run to 

Now I know how the river feels 
When it reaches the sea 
And finally finds the place 
It was always meant to be 
Holding fast, home at last 
Knowing the journey's through 
Lying here with you 
I know how the river feels 

Holding fast, home at last 
Knowing the journey's through 
Lying here with you 
I know how the river feels 
Oh, I know how the river feels
