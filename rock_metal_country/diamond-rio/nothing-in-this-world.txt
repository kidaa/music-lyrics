Nothing In This World 

Well since the day the world began 
I know God has had a master plan 
He made a sky to hold the sun 
He made sands to hold the sea 
He made hearts for neverending love 
And he made you for me 

CHORUS 

No hurricane, no driving rain 
Has our kind of power 
No valley wide, no mountainslide 
Can hold a love like ours 
No ocean deep, no fire's heat 
Can break a bond so true 
Nothing, Nothing, Nothing in this world's 
As strong as me and you 

Through all the days and darkest nights 
Our love will be the guiding light 
With every breath I take 
And every day I'm awake 
This love of ours will never fade 
Until the end of time 

CHORUS 

Oh, no love I know of, 
can hold me like you do 

CHORUS 

Strong as me and you 
As strong as me and you.
