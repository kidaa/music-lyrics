Chorus
If you'd like some lovin'
I've got all you'll ever need
Two arms to hold you all night tenderly
If you're lookin' for forever
I'm as far as you need see
If you'd like some lovin'
You'll find it here with me

If you're lookin' to be lonely
I won't be of any help
If you want someone who'll leave you
You better look to someone else

If you'd like some lovin'
I've got all you'll ever need
If you'd like some lovin'
You'll find it here with me

He brought you many heartaches 
He brought you many tears
But what he never brought you 
Darlin' you can find right here

Repeat chorus
If you'd like some lovin'
You'll find it here with me
