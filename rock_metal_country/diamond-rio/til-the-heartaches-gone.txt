'Til The Heartache's Gone  

Let the tears fall like rain  
If that's what it takes  
To wash away your memory  
Let the hurt take its time  
I don't mind waiting  
If that's the way it's gotta be  
I'll keep holdin' on  
'Til the heartache's gone  

All the might have been's  
And the never will be's  
They can never take your place  
But they're all that's left  
Of all that ever mattered to me  
And they fill this empty space  
And I'll keep holin' on  
'Til the heartache's gone  

I'll make believe you still love me  
'Til the heartache's gone  
I'll pretend you still care  
You'll always be here  
'Til the heartache's gone  

Baby I can make it through  
The pain of losing you  
If that's the way it's gotta be  
I'll keep holdin' on  
No matter how long  
'Til the heartache's gone
