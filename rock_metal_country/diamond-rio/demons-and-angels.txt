Demons And Angels 

He swore it was over and all in his past 
A few hours later his hand's 'round a glass 
A voice on the left says, 
  There's peace in the wine 
From the right a voice whispers, 
  Don't do it this time 
When he looks for the answer 
down in his heart 
Demons and angels tear him apart 

She calls his name softly 
as she lies in their bed 
Listens for footsteps and prays for the best 
She knows that he loves her 
knows that he tries 
But if he comes home drinking 
she'll leave him tonight 
She waits for the answer and 
cries in the dark 
while demons and angels tear him apart 

For so long they've fought for his soul 
The whisky and the woman at home 
And they all know he must choose 
the winner alone 

There's not much that's sweeter 
than a new life begun 
Ain't much that's sadder 
than a promise undone 
He stares at the bottle, 
longs for her arms 
while demons and angels tear him apart 

When he looks for the answer down in his heart 
there's demons and angels that tear him apart
