You're Gone 
Jon Vezner/Paul Williams 

I said hello I think I'm broken 
And though I was only jokin' 
It took me by surprise when you agreed 
I was tryin' to be clever 
For the life of me I never 
Would have guessed how far the simple truth would lead 
You knew all my lines 
You knew all my tricks 
You knew how to heal that pain 
No medicine can fix 

And I bless the day I met you 
And I thank God that He let you 
Lay beside me for a moment that lives on 
And the good news is I'm better 
For the time we spent together 
And the bad news is you're gone 

Lookin' back it's still surprisin' 
I was sinking you were rising 
With a look you caught me in mid-air 
Now I know God has His reasons 
But sometimes it's hard to see them 
When I awake and find that you're not there 
You found hope in hopeless 
Your made crazy sane 
You became the missing link 
That helped me break my chains 

And I bless the day I met you 
And I thank God that He let you 
Lay beside me for a moment that lives on 
And the good news is I'm better 
For the time we spent together 
And the bad news is you're gone 
The bad news is you're gone
