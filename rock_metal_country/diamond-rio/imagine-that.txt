What is the world comin' to 
When lovers can't believe 
They got a love comin' true 
Then they up and leave 
They say they will when they won't 
They say I do and then they don't 
That ain't the way it's got to be 
With you and me 

Imagine that, a love that lasts forever 
Imagine that, for all the world to see 
That two people stay together 
The way it ought to be 
Oh imagine that 

I don't intend to change the world 
I couldn't if I tried 
As long as I've got you with me girl 
I'll be satisfied 
Let's do what we can, mean what we say 
We'll just take it day by day 
'Cause I want to prove to everyone 
That it can be done 

Imagine that, a love that lasts forever 
Imagine that, for all the world to see 
That two people stay together 
The way it ought to be 
Oh imagine that 

Do you believe in love enough to go the distance 
Do you believe in love enough to make a stand 
Do you believe enough to handle the resistance 
I believe we can 

Imagine that, a love that lasts forever 
Imagine that, for all the world to see 
That two people stay together 
The way it ought to be 
Oh imagine that 
Oh imagine that 
Imagine that 
Oh imagine that
