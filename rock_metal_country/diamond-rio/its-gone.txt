It's Gone 

I don't know how it happened but it did 
I don't know why it's over but it is 
I don't know where it comes from when it's on 
I don't know where it goes to but It's gone. 

You used to brush my mind with tender thoughts 
We could say it all and never talk 
But lately our love's only flesh and bone 
I don't know where it went to but it's gone 

Chorus

We used to light the darkness up, 
make love without a touch 
Be ourselves and never be alone, 
somethin' lived between us then 
I always thought would never end 
But like the wind I guess it just moved on 
I don't know where it went to 
but it's gone. 

I don't understand it but I know 
The blush of love once bright no longer glows 
and I can't put it back by hangin' on 
I don't know where it went to but it's gone. 

Chorus 

I don't know where it went to but it's gone.
