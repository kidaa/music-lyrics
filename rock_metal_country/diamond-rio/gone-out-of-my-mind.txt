Gone Out Of My Mind 

Your love just came to visit 
Your mem'ry came to stay 
It's a shame that being gone 
Don't mean you went away 
For me it won't be over 
'Til the day I find 
That one of us has gone out of my mind 

I'll give up on loving you 
Or else I'll go insane 
It really makes no difference 
As long as there's no pain 
I know it's just a matter 
Of misery and time 
'Til one of us has gone out of my mind 

Either I'll forget or I'll go crazy 
One way or another 
I'm gonna leave you behind 
I know that I'll be tortured 
By your memory 
'Til one of us has gone out of my mind
