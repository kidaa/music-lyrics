Calling All Hearts Come Back Home 

To the father and the son who never talk, 
come back home 
To the husband and the wife who are both at fault, 
come back home 
Forget the past and start again 
Face to face and make amends 

Calling out around the world 
Every heartbroken boy, every lonely girl 
Take what's right and forgive what's wrong 
I'm calling all hearts to come back home 

From the single mom trying to make ends meet 
daddy come back home 
From the parents of the child living out on the street 
baby come back home 
Forget the past and start again 
Face to face and make amends 

Can I hear an Amen 
Can I hear an Amen 

To every soul who's lost their way, 
come back home 
Yeah the wait is over, today's the day 
come back home  Come back home 

Oh calling out around the world 
Every heartbroken boy, every lonely girl 
Take what's right and forgive what's wrong 
I'm calling all hearts, I'm calling out around the world 

Every heartbroken boy, every lonely girl 
Take what's right and forgive what's wrong 
I'm calling all hearts to come back home
