Walkin' Away 
Annie Roboff/Craig Wiseman 

Sometimes a careless word just rolls right off my tongue 
Now matter what I do it leaves you all undone 
Hey baby no need to go crazy over some little something I've said 
Can't you see you're the keeper of my heart 
Even when I lose my head 

We've still got it good no matter how bad it gets 
Even after all this time the slipper still fits 
Hey just look at how far we've come by choosing to stay 
Baby don't go there love don't get nowhere walkin' away 

Sometimes the whisper of love gets lost in the angry shout 
Even hearts that are in this deep might think about an easy way out 
One honest touch makes those worries just fade like stars at dawn 
These occasional moments of weakness 
Only makes our love more strong 

We've still got it good no matter how bad it gets 
Even after all this time the slipper still fits 
Hey just look at how far we've come by choosing to stay 
Baby don't go there love don't get nowhere walkin' away 

It gets easier all the time 
Oh and harder and harder to leave behind 

We've still got it good no matter how bad it gets 
Even after all this time the slipper still fits 
Hey just look at how far we've come by choosing to stay 
Baby don't go there love don't get nowhere walkin' away 
Baby don't go there love don't get nowhere walkin' away
