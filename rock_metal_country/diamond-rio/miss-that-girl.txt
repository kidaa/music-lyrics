Miss That Girl 
Kenny Mims/Jeff Pennig 

Cold gray dawn, steel blue day sunset rust tonight 
It's the same old picture to a love struck man 
Who's suddenly seen the light 
And I miss that girl 
Yeah I miss that girl 

I guess I moved too slow and thought too fast 
And lost what might have been 
Now I face the pain of a wounded heart 
Dyin' to try again 

But I missed my chance and now she's gone 
Life's too short and the odds too long to miss that girl 
Well I miss that kiss and I miss that smile 
A miss like this is a million miles 
And I miss that girl 
Yeah I miss that girl 

Sometimes I hear that voice and see those eyes 
And I remember when those arms were open wide 
It's like I missed the phone by half a ring 
I missed the point of this whole dang thing 
And I miss that girl 

Yeah I miss that kiss and I miss that smile 
A miss like this is a million miles 
And I miss that girl 
Oh I miss that girl 

Yeah I miss that kiss and I miss that smile 
A miss like this is a million miles 
And I miss that girl 
Oh I miss that girl 
Oh I miss that girl
