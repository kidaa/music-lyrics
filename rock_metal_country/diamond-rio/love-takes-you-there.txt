Love Takes You There 
Mary Ann Kennedy/Christopher Morris/John Nance Sharp 

In a chapel halfway across town 
With a ring two hearts find common ground 
A mother holds her miracle of birth 
In his eyes he sees what dreams are worth 

There's places you'll never find 
Without love as your guide 
To reach the destinations of the heart 
So, if you trust enough to care 
You can go anywhere 
But only love 
Takes you there 

See a couple walking hand in hand 
Sharing a moment only lovers can 
And sitting on a Greyhound all alone 
A soldier with a suitcase heading home 

There's places you'll never find 
Without love as your guide 
To reach the destinations of the heart 
So, if you trust enough to care 
You can go anywhere 
But only love 
Takes you there 

So, if you trust enough to care 
You can go anywhere 
But only love 
Only love takes you there
