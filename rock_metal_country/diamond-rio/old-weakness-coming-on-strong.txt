Old Weakness Coming On Strong 

She's back in town 
Haven't seen her yet 
But I know that that won't last 
Soon I'll turn around 
And be face to face 
With a feeling from my past 

CHORUS 

She's an old weakness 
From a place I fell 
She's an old heartache 
One that time didn't heal too well 
It's an old story 
'Bout a love gone wrong 
Just an old weakness 
Coming on strong 

My hands still shake 
And my heart still aches 
Just knowing she's this close 
Those steel blue eyes 
And the way she smiles 
Are the things I fear the most 

CHORUS 

I know the truth is showing 
I know I should be going home 

CHORUS 

Just an old weakness 
Coming on strong
