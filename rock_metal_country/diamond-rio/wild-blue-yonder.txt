Wild Blue Yonder 

If you need a prison break 
I will be the file in the cake 
We will make a great escape 
Into the wild blue yonder 

If you need to chase the blues 
I will be your running shoes 
We'll double back and leave no clues 
Into the wild blue yonder 

Chorus 

Into the wild blue yonder 
Where we can be free 
Into the wild blue yonder 
I'm takin' you with me 

If you need to fight for love 
I will be your boxing gloves 
Cheering crowds will lift us up 
Into the wild blue yonder 

Chorus 

If you need someone to care 
If life is treating you unfair 
Take my love I'll lead you there 
Into the wild blue yonder 
Into the wild blue yonder
