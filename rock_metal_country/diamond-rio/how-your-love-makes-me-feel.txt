How Your Love Makes Me Feel 
Max T. Barnes/Trey Bruce 

I'm no poet and I know it 
I don't use five dollar words 
This might not sound like much compared to all the pretty things you've heard 
But here's how I'd explain it since you brought it up 
It won't sound like anybody else's version of love 

It's like just before dark 
Jump in the car 
Buy an ice cream and see how far we can drive before it melts kinda feelin' 
That's how your love makes me feel inside 
There's a cow in the road and you swerve to the left 
Fate skips a beat and it scares you to death and you laugh until you cry 
That's how your love makes me feel inside 

It might not be more suitable for greeting cards and such 
But it's a true and honest feeling and if you feel it half as much 
We could go through life together without a worry or a care 
Knowing deep down in our hearts that we've got something special here 

It's like just before dark 
Jump in the car 
Buy an ice cream and see how far we can drive before it melts kinda feelin' 
That's how your love makes me feel inside 
There's a cow in the road and you swerve to the left 
Fate skips a beat and it scares you to death and you laugh until you cry 
That's how your love makes me feel inside 
That's how your love makes me feel 

I have always heard you can't put love into words 

It's like just before dark 
Jump in the car 
Buy an ice cream and see how far we can drive before it melts kinda feelin' 
That's how your love makes me feel inside 
There's a cow in the road and you swerve to the left 
Fate skips a beat and it scares you to death and you laugh until you cry 
That's how your love makes me feel inside 
That's how your love makes me feel inside 
That's how your love makes me feel inside 
That's how I feel 
That's how your love makes me feel
