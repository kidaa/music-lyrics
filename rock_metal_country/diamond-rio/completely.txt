Completely, wanna give my love completely
I'd rather be alone than be in love just half the way
I want to find someone that I can trust
Completely, wanna give my heart completely
To someone who'll completely give their heart to only me
And when I find that one
That's when I'll fall in love

Chorus
Completely
Not half but whole
With heart and soul
Completely
Not in between
But everything
Completely
That's the way it's gotta be
The way I want someone to fall in love with me

Forever wanna feel the word forever
And know there'll be somebody there forever by my side
And when that feeling comes
That's when I'll give my love

Repeat chorus

It's all or nothing at all for this heart of mine
And I won't give up this heart till the day I find
Someone who needs me

Repeat chorus
The way I need someone to fall in love with me
