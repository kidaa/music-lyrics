Is That Asking Too Much 
Donny Lowery/Craig Wiseman 

Some people say there's no American dream 
I hear them talking but they don't say a thing 
I still believe you've got to give it to get 
Baptize your every aspiration in sweat 
I vow my head each night and roll up my sleeves 
'Cause buddy it's a long hard road to Easy Street 
Where all the cars go 

Fast, fast, fast 
When you step on the gas, gas, gas 
Nobody else is gonna pass me up going down the road 
I want a great big house on the hill 
Every pocket full of hundred dollar bills 
Givin' me a thrill, thrill, thrill I ain't never known 

Is that asking too much 
Am I over the line 
Am I way out of touch 
Tell me am I losing my mind 
I know I won't never get enough 
Is that asking too much 

I've never been accused of dreaming too small 
I never saw no shame in wanting it all 
I guess that's just the curse of being born poor 
No matter what you got you always want more 
Everybody wants a lot, a little inside 
I'm not the only one with hungry eyes 
That wants a car that goes 

Fast, fast, fast 
When you step on the gas, gas, gas 
Nobody else is gonna pass me up going down the road 
I want a great bid house on the hill 
Every pocket full of hundred dollar bills 
Man, givin me a thrill, thrill, thrill I ain't never known 

Is that asking too much 
Am I over the line 
Am I way out of touch 
Tell me am I losing my mind 
I know I won't never get enough 
Is that asking too much 

I just wanna go fast, fast, fast 
When I step on the gas, gas, gas 
Nobody else is gonna pass me up going down the road 
I want a great big house on the hill 
Every pocket full of hundred dollar bills 
Man givin me a thrill, thrill, thrill I ain't never known 
When I step on the gas, gas, gas 
You know I wanna go fast, fast, fast 
Nobody better ever pass me up going down the road 
I gotta build me a house on the hill 
Every pocket full of hundred dollar bills 
Man, givin' me a thrill, thrill, thrill I ain't never known 
Now is that asking too much
