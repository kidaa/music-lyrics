I'm Trying 

She said I'm not pointing fingers 
He said yes you are 
'Cause you wouldn't bring it up if you weren't 
If I told you I'd been walking 
Out in the dark night thinking 
Would you take as truth this alcoholic's word 
I can't change what's done is done 
But I can tell you this 
Not a day goes by that I 
Don't curse myself and all my sins 
And I need you to hold on to 
While this part of me is dying 
And though I haven't kicked the demons 
That haunt me 
I'm Trying 
I'm Trying 

She sat down on the floor 
And said I wish I was stronger 
Right now I feel fragile as glass 
I want to believe you 
Believe what's held you has freed you 
And I hate these doubts 
That keep on coming back 
My parent's think I'm crazy 
For staying here this long 
But there's nothing more I want for us 
Than to prove to them they're wrong 
I don't want to be afraid 
I don't want to think you're lying 
And though I haven't found the faith 
That I need 
I'm Trying 
I'm Trying 

He asked do you want me to leave 
'Cause if you do you know I will 
But she said much to his disbelief 
No I love you still 
Oh I love you still 

He said I don't know why I've been the fool 
But I can tell you this 
Not a day goes by that I 
Don't curse myself and all my sins 
Then he dropped down to his knees 
By now they both were crying 
He said I haven't been the man I want to be 
But I'm Trying 
I'm Trying 
I'm Trying believe me 
I'm Trying
