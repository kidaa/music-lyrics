Love A Little Stronger 
Chuck Jones/Billy Crittenden/Gregory Swint 

I don't leave any room for doubt 
When it comes to you and me 
You know all about the way I feel inside 
You know how hard I try 
But that don't mean that I can't 

Love a little stronger, dig a little deeper 
Go a little farther, anything to please you girl 
Tonight I'm gonna start all over 
Show you girl what's in my heart 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, gonna love a little stronger 

You tell me you're the lucky one 
But I see things differently 
I have just begun to show you that you mean 
Everything to me 
I still feel the need to 

Love a little stronger, dig a little deeper 
Go a little farther, anything to please you girl 
Tonight I'm gonna start all over 
Show you girl what's in my heart 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, gonna love a little stronger 

Love a little stronger, dig a little deeper 
Go a little farther, anything to please you girl 
Tonight I'm gonna start all over 
Show you girl what's in my heart 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, gonna love a little stronger 

Love a little stronger, dig a little deeper 
Go a little farther, anything to please you girl 
Tonight I'm gonna start all over 
Show you girl what's in my heart 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, gonna love a little stronger 
Gonna love a little stronger 
Gonna love a little stronger
