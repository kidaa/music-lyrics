I Could Do It With My Eyes Closed 

Moonlight in a dew drop 
Two miles to the ridge top 
One hand on the wheel is probably 
One more than I need 
Bald tires in a dirt rut 
Chauffeur us all the way up 
We've been there enough 
All we gotta do is turn the key 

Chorus

Just like the back of your hand 
I know my way around this land 
Around every curve and bend 
From your heart down to your soul 
There ain't nothin' I can't do 
When it comes to lovin' you 
It's like flying down these old back roads 
I could do it with my eyes closed 

We'll kill the motor when we get there 
I'll pull the ribbon from your hair 
We'll lay up on the hood and I can stare at you all night 
And you'll say when we're over that hill 
Are you gonna love me still 
Well baby you know I will 
It's just like ridin' a bike 

Chorus 

Bridge 
They can't tell us love is blind 
Cause it brought us right where we are tonight 

There ain't nothin' I can't do 
When it comes to lovin' you 
It's like flying down these old back road 
I could do it with my eyes closed 
I could love you with my eyes closed 
I could do it with my eyes closed
