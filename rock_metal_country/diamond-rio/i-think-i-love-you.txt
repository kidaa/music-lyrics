I Think I Love you 

You've got my attention 
In every dimension 
You've made a deep impression 
On my heart tonight 
Looks can be deceiving 
But what I've been receivin' 
Has got me believin' 
Now the time is right 
To tell you 
I've got to tell you 

Chorus 

I think I love you 
I know I need you 
I really want you 
I have to see you 
On a steady basis 
That smile on your face says 
You feel it too 
I think I love you 

It's a win win situation 
I'm way beyond elation 
Full of fascination 
For you here in my arms 
So I've made a life decision 
I'm on a one way mission 
To bring this to fruition 
And give you my heart 
I'll show you 
Baby I'll show you 

Chorus 

I know I need you 
I really want you 
I have to see you 
On a steady basis 
That smile on your face says 
You feel it too 
I think I love you
