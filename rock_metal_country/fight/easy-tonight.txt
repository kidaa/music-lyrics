You were wrong 
You were right
You are gone 
Tonight
You were free 
So alive
You were wrong 
You were right 

You were down 
You could see
You wore hearts
for me
You were sharp 
Sharp as knives
You were wrong 
You were right 

Shot down: said you never had the chance
Took a ride on a suicide romance
Could have sworn there was somebody home
To facilitate the great unknown
Woman, I ain't going to meet you anywhere
Don't know where I'm going yet:
But I sure am getting there 
Shotgun fire: anybody home
I got two dimes in the telephone
Alright: It's not easy tonight 

You were bound 
You were free
You wear black 
for me
You were dark 
Dark as night
You were wrong 
You were right 

Shot down: said you never had the chance
Took a ride on a suicide romance
Could have sworn there was somebody home
To facilitate the great unknown
But woman, I ain't going to meet you anywhere
Don't know where I'm going yet:But I sure am getting there 

Shotgun fire: anybody home
I got two dimes in the telephone
Alright: It's not easy tonight 

She's In. Over my head:and it's not easy it's not easy tonight 

Shotgun fire: anybody home
I got two dimes in the telephone
Alright: It's not easy tonight 

You were free:Now your not:You were free
