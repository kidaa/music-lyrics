I'm Dying, Dying to wake up without you, without you in my head again 
I'm Dying, Dying to forget about you, that you ever lived 
There's a shade come over this heart that's coping with laying down to rest 
I'm Dying to live without you again 

I'm Dying, Dying to find a distraction, get you away from me 
I'm Dying, Dying to reach a conclusion, so that the world can see 
It's the same old story of love and glory that broke before it bent 
I'm Dying to live without you again 

The first time you left I said goodbye 
Now there's not a prayer that can survive 

Dying, Dying to die just to come back so we can meet again 
Dying, Dying to say what I always should have said 
It's a strange emotion this but there's still hope in this 
As long as there's a breath... 
I'm Dying and I can't live without you again 

It's a strange emotion this but there's still hope in this 
As long as there's a breath... 

I'm Dying and I can't live without you 
I'm Dying and I can't live without you again
