No love, no nothin'
Until my baby comes home.
No fun with no one,
As long as baby must roam.

I promised him I'd wait for him
Till even Hades froze.
I'm lonesome, heaven knows,
But what I said still goes.

No love, no nothin'
And that's a promise I'll keep.
No sir, no nothin'
I'm getting plenty of sleep.

My heart's on strike,
And tho' its like
An empty honeycomb,
No love, no sir, no nothin'
Till my baby comes home.
