There's a crack in the hull
Where the penitents used to live
There's a crack in the hull
Where the Penitents used to live
And we can make it right if we row all night
Give all that we can give
There's a crack in the hull
Where the penitents used to live 

There's a leak in the hold
Where the infantry used to sleep
There's a leak in the hold
Where the Infantry used to sleep
And we can make it right if we roll all night
Baby dust off your knees
There's a leak in the hold
Where the infantry used to be 

Little monsters on the table
Crazies here to play
Little monsters in the boat parade 

There's a hole in the hat
Where the captain kept his dreams
There's a hole in the hat
Where the Captain kept his dreams
And we can make it right
If we sail all night
Better pray for a breeze
There's a hole in the hat
Where the captain used to be
