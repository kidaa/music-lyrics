[W]
Took me a while
But I'm finally here
I just wanna testify
Make it crystal clear
See I've been picked out
To be picked on 
Talked about out my friend's mouth
I've been beat down
Til he turned my life around 
turned my life around

[Chorus:]
Seems like I always fall short of bein worthy
Cuz I aint good enough
but he still loves me 
yeah

I aint no superstar
The spotlight aint shinin on me 
no no no no no
cuz I aint good enough
but he still loves me 
Loves me

[B]
I used to wake up some days
and wish I'd stayed asleep 
cuz i went to bed on top of the world
today the world's on top of me 
everybody's got opinions
they share
They aint been in my position
they don't care
that it breaks my heart when I hear what they have to say about me yeah 
what they say

seems like I always fall short fallin short
of bein worthy Lord I aint worthy
Cuz I aint good enough no no
but he still loves me still loves me

[All]
I aint no superstar 
I wanna be for you
The spotlight aint shinin on me 
cuz I aint good enough
but he still loves me 

I'm not perfect
I'm not perfect
Yes I do wrong
yes I do wrong
I'm trying my best
trying my best but
But it aint good enough
just aint good enough
Shunned by the world
If I don't succeed
Cuz I aint good
But he still loves me
I just aint good enough

If you aint worthy just raise your hands
And let me know that you understand
That we are all so blessed 
To be loved, loved

Stand for him or fall for anything
Cause through his eyes we all look the same
What would we do without blame?

Feels like we always fall short
Of bein worthy we are not worthy
Cuz I aint good enough
But he still loves me 
I aint no superstar
I aint no superstar but I wanna be for you Lord
The spotlight aint shinin on me 
Cuz I aint good enough
Oh
But you still love me 

I'm not perfect
Yes I do wrong
I'm tryin my best but

It aint good enough
