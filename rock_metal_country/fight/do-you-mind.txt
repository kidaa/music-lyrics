DO YOU MIND IF I ASK YOU A QUESTION
DO YOU MIND IF I SWEAR NOT TO HURT YOU
DO YOU MIND IF I DON'T PISS ON YOUR BED 

DO YOU MIND IF I BRING HER STILL WITH ME
DO YOU MIND IF I FORGET AND THANK YOU
DO YOU MIND IF I JUGGLE THE MEANING 

DO YOU CARE THAT I ONLY WEAR SILVER
DO YOU CARE THAT SET ONLY STONE
ARE YOU ANGRY THE YOU I'M ADOPTING
IS ONLY A PRETENSE AT HOME 

DO YOU MIND IF I MAKE YOU WEAR EARRINGS
LIKE SHE DID, LIKE YOU DID BEFORE
DO YOU MIND FOR I THINK I STILL LOVE YOU
DO YOU MIND
ALWAYS HAVE
EVERMORE
