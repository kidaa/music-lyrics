There was a time a long, long time ago 
Chevys and levees played on the radio 
No cell phones, just 20,000 lights 
Swaying on a saturday night alright 

Can you imagine that slice of time 
Rock and roll was young 
People stood in line 
To hear music that played into their lives 
That you could carry till the day you die 

Hey man sing me a song 
When we were everyone 
We were more than just a slice of American Pie 

Have you read my blog today 
300 million little USA's 
Your doorstep is just a click away 
We'll get together one of these days 

How can you be as nice as me 
You're not from the same slice as me 
Where do we go from here my friend 
Is this the way our story ends 

Hey man sing me a song 
When we were everyone 
We were more than just a slice of American Pie 

I can't stop singing along.. 
Can you join in... come on 
Are we more than just a slice of American Pie 

We're top down lovers 
It's saturday night 
The band's running 
And it feels so right 
The moon's dancing and the stars are free 
I caught your heart on a summer breeze 
Whatever was or what's meant to be 
Our melodies are memories 

There was a time a long, long time ago 
Chevys and levees played on the radio 
No cell phones, just 20,000 lights 
Swaying on a saturday night alright 

Hey man sing me a song 
When we were everyone 
We were more than just a slice of American Pie 

I can't stop singing along 
Can you join in, come on 
Are we more than just a slice of American Pie 
We're more than a slice 
We're more than just a slice of American Pie
