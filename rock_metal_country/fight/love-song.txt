Put away your tears and your sleepy eyes
Put away that bullshit, Big boys they don't cry to their mama's
:She'll be back soon
Put away your raincoat and make your bed
Take another bullet right to your head
We're going on a picnic and we'll get there soon 

She says:Maybe it's over
He say's: there's plenty more fish in the sea
I say: Don't go away from me: 

Put away your dinner and have a snack
Tie your little brother up in a sack now
We're moving to the country and we'll get there soon she says 

Pack up all the things that you don't deserve
Take another swing: Here comes a curve ball
I bet you can't hit it cause you'll swing to soon 

She says:Maybe it's over
He say's: there's plenty more fish in the sea
I say: Don't go away:
Don't go away
Please don't go away from me: 

Take those damn pictures off that shelf
Put away your mommy you don't need her
I found you a new one: she'll be here soon 

She says:my God it's over
He say's: I found another fish in the sea
I say: why me
Why me
Why me
Why is it me
