Jainy sells for three dimes a night
Morning helps her find her way blind
And I love her more than I can tell
Heaven help me now
Seems I found to find her just as well: 

Jainy Yea:
Jainy Yea 

Jainy takes me three times a night
Morning Saves me and I find my way blind
And she loves me more than she can tell
Heaven help her now
Seems she's found to find me just as well 

Jainy Yea:
Jainy Yea: 

Jainy stares at stars every night
Morning takes her eyes every time
And she'll love you more than you can tell
Heaven help us now
Seems you've finally found us: just as well: 

Jainy Yea:
Jainy Yea: 

She'll be all right
She'll be all right
