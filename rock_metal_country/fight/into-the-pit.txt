A little older, little wiser
With every breath I learn just a little more
And with all I've seen, I've finally made up my mind
Enough of this world
Enough blood in these eyes
So, so, so sick of this life

It's about time that I realized
Release this hate from inside
Enough blood in my eyes

Call it what you will
Call it suicide
Disregard how you feel
I'm just freeing my mind
Clench my teeth as I sleep
So, so, so sick of this life
Cannot take, cannot fake
Can't shake this blood from these eyes

All I have and all I will be
Nevertheless I'll live for all eternity
'Cause you can't erase my words, can't erase my mind
You can't wipe out my thoughts
Can't shake this blood from my eyes
So, so, so don't even try

Just give me one good reason to live
I'll give you three to die
Let's leave this world behind
