I Took her leaving like I did before
I Turned around and I asked for more
And she didn't even mean a thing to me 

I Left my spirit at the chapel door
I Sailed around til I lost the war
And you didn't even think to send a thing 

But I'm alright, alright, I feel alright
I never been better in my life
You know the score 

I'm just fine, I'm fine, feeling fine
A regular sawed off valentine
That nothing more 

I Hit my head upon the chamber door
And all the marbles rolled on the floor
And all the pyschos in the ward start screaming: 

I'm alright, alright, I feel alright
I never been better in my life
You know the score 

I'm just fine, I'm fine, feeling fine
A regular sawed off valentine
That nothing more 

My Baby 

I'm alright, alright, I feel alright
I never been better in my life
You know the score 

I'm just fine, I'm fine, feeling fine
A regular sawed off valentine
That nothing more
