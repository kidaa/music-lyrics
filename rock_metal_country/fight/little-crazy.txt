If I could put you
on top of a cake, I would ice you
and keep you
wrapped up in a box to be near you
If I could... I would...

If I could touch you
again with my fingers so gently
If I could feel you
breathing in time next to me
but the silence surrounds me
flashing memories of you
riding with the moon at night
I never had a chance to say goodbye
goodbye...

Lost forever
lost to another world
Gone forever
but remembered in our thoughts
you are

If I could open
the heavens above, I'd be with you
If I could hold you
again in my arms, I would tell you
that I love you
