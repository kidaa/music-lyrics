There's a bar on my head 
There's a cross for my bed 
There's my heart in my hand 
There's my stick in the sand 

Here where the world starts spinning round 
take a ride and you'll feel what you've never found 
Here when the stars start fading out 
you hear the angels laughing without a sound 

Welcome to the beautiful 

She sits here far away 
in my breast, in my grace 
She's the best the best of me 
She my love, she's my queentalking to me 

And when your world starts spinning down 
take a ride and you'll feel what you never found 
When the stars start fading out 
You hear the angels laughing without a sound 

Welcome to the beautiful 

I met myself just today 
Came alive in my grave 
And I'm the best, the best of me 
For you my love for you I'll be 

When the world starts slowing down 
Take a ride and you'll feel what you never found 
And as the stars are fading out 
I hear the angels laughing without a sound 

Welcome to the beautifulthe beautiful
