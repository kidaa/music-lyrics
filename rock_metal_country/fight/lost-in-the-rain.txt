United in love and freedom
we could make this world worth living in
a place where sun keeps shining
is where your happiness begins.

United in love and friendship
we'll travel horizons far beyond compare
and open the door to ev'ryone
for freedom is for all to share.

Though the road we take maybe hard to climb
together I'm sure that we will find
a guiding star way up above to help us
on our way to love.

United in love and freedom
we could make this world worth living in
a place where sun keeps shining
is where your happiness begins.
