Over by the still she says,
"Man I think you better wait for tomorrow!
Take this pillow for your head
And I'll take you." 

Back against the beast I went
To feel her coming, hot for a follow up
Here comes the sun again:to see me through 

On and on she takes me from you, my love 
On and on she rakes me from you 

Happily I leave her fed
Tonight I swear, I swear on tomorrow:wait
Here comes the sun again
To see me through: 

On and on she takes me from you, my love
On and on she rakes me from you 

Bloody Mary's for all:
Bloody Mary's for all: 

On and on she takes me from you, my love
On and on she rakes me from you 

All of my dreams for you:to follow
All of my dreams for you:to swallow
All of my dreams for you:
