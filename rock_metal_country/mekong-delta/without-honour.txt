Mekong Delta, J. Jenkins
Marching through the jungle
Small change to survive
Shrapnell fire's pounding
Men must leave their lifes 
Corpses fill the graves
They are defaced, they are bloated
Mutilated limbs
And no one knows from whom they are 
Treated as if they're garbage
No one sheds a tear 
They die without honour
Get burried with no name
They die without honour
Everyone's the same 
Back from hell again
Not a chance is given
Screaming from the gutter
Die just like the others 
Corpses fill the graves
They are defaced, they are bloated
Mutilated limbs
And no one knows from whom they are 
Treated as if you're garbage
No one sheds a tear 
They die without honour
Get burried with no name
They die without honour
Everyone's the same
