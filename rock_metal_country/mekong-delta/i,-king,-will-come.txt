Mekong Delta, J. Jenkins
Now it came so far with me
I was really scared ha, ha 
Today I'm risen from this sphere
I was to see it at once
This is my kingdom, I'm bestof it all
Today's messiah, it's me 
I, king, will come beat me on the cross This is why I'm born 
They practice their rites wake up!
Real ridiculous what pope? 
They believe that Jesus enforced all evil
Nothing could harm them no more
But chaos rules, they come from outta space
Come for enslaving the world... ...but 
I, king, will come beat me on the cross
This is why I'm born
