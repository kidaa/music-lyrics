Mekong Delta, J. Jenkins
Screams, lonely in the night
Deadly torture, just remember
War captivity
Fellows on your side 
Blood - spurting out his neck
While his head is rolling to the ground
And his dying corpse's
vincing at my feet 
And the torturer said to me
The next one could be you
And I told him all the things
My comrades planned to do 
Screams, lonely in my room
Wake up in cold sweat like every night
I can't get these things out of my head 
Mad, I got nearly mad
With this lack of sleep I can't get clear
Help me in my pain
I am shell shocked 
Every night it's just the same
I can't rest my soul
I'm the one who is to blame
This nightmare patrol
