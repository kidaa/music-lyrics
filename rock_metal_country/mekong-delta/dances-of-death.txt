A Introduction
B Eruption
C Beyond The Gates
Time - passing as the world
changed its face
Past - all that used to be not a trace
Now - all that was is gone
can't you see
Always questions
What - happened to our world
different now
Why - answers can't be found
tell me now
Now - dissolution is all I see
As I meandered this world I saw strange faces
I've seen some gastly bizarre  phenomenon
Such desolation and pain I can't describe it
But always something was there that led me on
Never saw a place like this
How can such a place exist
Brotherhood of happiness
Inviting me I can't resist
How can such a thing exist
Inviting me I can't resist
Never saw a place like this
Never saw a ...
The priests gave us reason 
Brought hope to our season
They gave us the will to survive
It's healthy and clean here
It's just like a dream here
Just thank the priests you're alive
I had a vision - then  it was gone
Something there I just can't put my finger on
Crys - from the other side
calling me
Lies - message from beyond
curse the priests
Why - I don't understand
Share the feast
Cataclysmic
Dark - figures in the midst
help denied
Death - tightening it's fist
no reply
Rage - tell me what is this
paradox
And as the people all dance in celebration
They seem so happy and so preoccupied
Somehow I don't understand this fascination
I think it all will be clear when I'm inside
Where did all these priests come from
What kind of men have you become
Serve and never question why
Worship Talons from the sky
What lies beyond the golden gate
A journey of uncertain fate
Serve and never question why
Serve and never question why
Question why
It's nicer than nice here
A real paradise here
It's really too good to believe
There's growing in knowing
And that's where I'm going
The gates are prepared to receive,
receive ... me
D Outburst
E Days Of Betrayal
Gates far behind
Priests out of mind
Endless the night
Nocturnal flight
Eyes in the dark
Wait for the spark
Waste everywhere...
Peril in sight
Pray for the light
Phantoms in black
Mutants attack
Bareskin and bone
Hunger the hone
No apathy 
For what I see
The tunnel in the mountainside
Looks like a place to hide
Descending into darkness now
A chamber deep inside
Days of betrayal
Days of betrayal
Days of betrayal
Days of
Automaton
Screen coming on
Ancient machines
What does it mean
Bio chip here
Message of fear
Shocking the view
Morbid and true
A chance to save the human race
Chaos we can avoid
A mighty power out of place  
That has to be destroyed
Days of betrayal
Days of betrayal
Days of betrayal
The end of the begining of,
What is but never really was
Now press on and go beyond
I could try a million times,
And cry until the end of time
But it won't cange a thing
F Restless
G Sanctuary
Don't believe all that you see
'Cause it can never be
Truth could be there in disguise
So never trust your eyes
Wandering aimless through time
Wondering what I will find
So many years on my own
No place I can call home
A dome upon the hill - stare
What can that builing be - sound
I hear a melody - look
That's my philosophy - wait
The truth is for the brave - and 
It's like a tidal wave now
Entities all dressed in white
No end in sight
Some giants, some little ones
Where are they from
Packed inside this mega-dome
Why have they come
Where are all these giants from
Why have they come
My eyes are playing tricks on me
These things I really can't believe
They've got the heads of human men
And the bodies of machines
Who are these android masterminds
And what will all this mean for me
Possessing knowledge so incredible
I know They speak the truth indeed
Can this be a fantasy
Mirage of what I want to see
A sanctuary can it really be
Just follow me - I've got the key
So follow me - You will see
Just follow me - I've got the key
So follow me - You will see
So follow me - I've got the key
You will agree - I guarantee 
Sanctuary
Just follow me - And you will find
Safe  inside - Out of sight - And out of mind
Each of us cell inside 
All satisfied
A body of perfection
And we are one
Entities dressed in white
No end in sight
The place I long to be Sanctuary
The giants paid a high price
For their artificial life
They guard the truths of all mankind you see
So intellect can thrive
Condemned to be the slaves of time they are
They can never touch or feel
Things are never what they seem to be
Eternity to them is real
