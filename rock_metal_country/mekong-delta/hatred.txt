Mekong Delta, J. Jenkins
"Oh, god, I'm so fed up with this conceited talks about right and unright,
with their so called important topics while they cannot even look over the rim of their coffee cups..." 
All they hear is their flesh
talkin' 'bout the daily cash
If I could, b'lieve me, I'd wipe them out 
If I do, with a smile
I would free the world meanwhile
but, the hell, I can't kill them all 
They are ruled by greed talking against walls
Property's their god fight the dumbness 
Lazy bumps without mind
for the real world they are blind
They got heads just to crash in their teeth 
Listen here, there's no place
for this garbage of our race mankind
and what's more, for shame, they rule our land 
Simple minded creeps if they would know
Banal in their deeds I can't get through 
Hatred, hatred, hatred so if you want it
Hatred, hatred, hatred so if you want it
Hatred, hatred, hatred so if you want it
Hatred, hatred, hatred 
Lazy bumps without mind
for the real world they are blind
but, the hell, I can't kill them all 
Listen here, there's no place
for this garbage of our race mankind
and what's more, for shame, they rule our land 
Simple minded creeps talking against walls
They are ruled by greed I can't get through 
Hatred, hatred, hatred so if you want it
Hatred, hatred, hatred so if you want it
Hatred, hatred, hatred so if you want it
Hatred, hatred, hatred I feel pleased to this
