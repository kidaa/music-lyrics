Music by Bjoern Eklund, Lyrics by Bjoern Eklund & Doug Lee
3:17
Transgressor I am
The one
Force of the future
Control
The new ways are stronger
Obey
your Weakness is my power
Downfall
I'm the transgressor - Predecessor
Overstepper  - Strong aggressor
Put your ways behind you -  They only have confined you
They are the chains that bind you - Needn't I remind you
I am the tempter
Extravagant my ways
The world is my
Menagerie
Freedom the dream of
The weak
Knowledge the scheme of
The meek
Boundaries of this world
Behind
Apes walking upright
Mankind
Transgressor born  to lead
I will satisfy your greed
Soon you'll understand
The power I command
Reality is gone
The  new ways are strong
Tansgress
