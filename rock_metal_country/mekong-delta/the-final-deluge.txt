Mekong Delta, J. Jenkins
In this night it happened I
woke up early, I don't know why
The world drowned in an ominous
silence, in a nervous rest... 
And I climbed up the old stairs
to the room of Erich Zann
What I saw, I can't forget 
Through the old window, overdimensional gate
This deluge of music, and Zann laid down his life 
The bow was fiddling with no help
His glassy eyes stared with no life
In whirlwinds of unheard cadences
it came over us blind defenceless 
All I know is I ran in panic
I've never seen this place again
What I saw, I can't forget 
Through the old window, overdimensional gate
Zann gave his life at the final deluge!
