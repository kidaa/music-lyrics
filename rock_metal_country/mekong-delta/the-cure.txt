Mekong Delta, J. Jenkins
When you'll come back home again
Weary from the fight
I will nurse your wounds and I'll
release you from your weights 
You must be hungry and
There's blood upon your hands
So please come in and I will cure your fever 
Why don't you rest your head
You long for warmth I bet
You needn't worry of a thing when I'm near 
He's the cure
I'm the cure
I'm the cure 
What can just light up your heart
When you're in the dark
What just makes privation worth
What's dearer to a man 
To see this face again
To touch this body and
To feel the blood pulsating in your veins 
Your hunger will be fed
For every tear you've shed
You'll get the threefold pay in just one long night 
He's the cure
I'm the cure
I'm the cure
