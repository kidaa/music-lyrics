Mekong Delta, J. Jenkins
All alone, I feel cold inside
Loneliness, I'm the only one to know 
I am one with my armchair
All night I'm playing for you
Though I know you won't thank me
What else is left now to do? 
It is here I will defend you
Near and nearer fight it back
One foot in the grave, I've seen this all before
Memories, memories of tomorrow
One foot in the grave, I've seen this all before
Dear me, memories of tomorrow 
Once I was dead, I know I'll be
I've diffracted it all on myself 
Oh, can't this chalice pass by me
Why can't it be someone else
I've got to pay for the world now
If not, there's no one to do 
It is here I will defend you
Near and nearer fight it back
One foot in the grave, I've seen this all before
Memories, memories of tomorrow
One foot in the grave, I've seen this all before
Dear me, memories of tomorrow
