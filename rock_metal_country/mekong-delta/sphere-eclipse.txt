R. Hubert, R. Hubert
Blind by science, stained by blood
You look down to this global cage
filled up with misery and pain
presented as a coffin for your punishment
While the religion gives the sense
in praying to an imperfect might 
Accepting the mutilated
bodies of little babies
as payment for the luxury of
a so called real and poor church
Somewhere they lost the meaning
twisted it never seeing
there's no justification
for this runaway creation 
Nothing is true and nothing is false
while no one can build or destroy
worlds in less than seven days
Nothing is gained and nothing is lost
It's all a game that has no rules 
Reality is insepted by
reality so all we see is
created by electron waves
that flow out of a living screen
The truth is portrayted just like a show
where hate rules all the winners take nothing 
While a hypocritical humanity
sends frozen kisses to a
tortured people lawn-mowing
the endless mind of
different thoughts projected
by clean white coats in a
castle of science no one
can control and what's more 
Nothing is true and nothing is false
while one can build or destroy
worlds in less than seven days
Nothing is gained and nothing is lost
It's all a game that has no rules
played by men and won by fools
