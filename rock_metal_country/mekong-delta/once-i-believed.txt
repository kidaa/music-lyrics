B. Eklund, Mekong Delta
Here's a wired tale of madness
About what happened to me
I led a live full of luxury
Till I broke down on my knees 
Cadillacs and furcoats
A mansion by the sea
Then lady luck walked away
Left me in misery 
Once I believed
This couldn't happen to me
But now
But now
Everything has changed 
A six inch blade cut through my hand
On that fatal day
Then the doctor told me
Slow death is coming my way 
My woman went away
People ignoring me
Razorblades in my bread
The folks in town wished I was dead 
Once I believed
This couldn't happen to me
But now
But now
Everything has changed 
What they say
They don't want me around in this town
Don't want me
Don't want me 
We don't want you
Don't want me 
Once I believed
This couldn't happen to me
But now
But now
Everything has changed 
What they say
They don't want me around in this town
Don't want me
Don't want me 
We don't want you
Don't want me
