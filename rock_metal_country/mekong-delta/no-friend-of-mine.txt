Lights turned low
Curtains let down
Ain't no one else in sight
Waitin' for you
Just for you
Four walls get closer everyday 
We've been friends for so long
And no one will ever know
Like the phoenix from the ashes
You came to haunt my dreams
And I think I know 
You'll never let me go
You'll never let me go
You're a part of me
You belong to me 
You know my secrets
All my emotions
Nothing I can hide
We'll stay together
Cause we can't stay apart
Though I know someday we are through 
We've been friends for so long
And no one will ever know
Like the phoenix from the ashes
You came to haunt my dreams
And I think I know 
You'll never let me go
You'll never let me go
You're a part of me
You belong to me 
Now you've gone too far
Now you're grown to strong
The ceiling is caving in
You've been here for much too long
Dark walls all around I see
Getting closer, closer to me 
Won't let you go
I got a split up mind 
Can't let you go
Ooh, you drive me insane 
Won't let you go
Please, please let me go 
Can't let you go
Cause you're killing me 
Won't let you go
Why do you do that to me 
Can't let you go
Why don't you set me free 
Won't let you go
I'm paralized in my bed 
Can't let you go
Pain's creeping right through my head 
Won't let you go
Why don't you leave me be 
Can't let you go
You are the death of me
