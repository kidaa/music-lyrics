B. Eklund, Mekong Delta
The old bum over there holds a sign saying
The only way for you to live never stop trying
A little boy hands a note over to me
The message there on that note is simple and clear 
Don't ever leave the path you have been walking on
Don't ever change the ways of getting along 
No chance for you to escape from your destination
Choose between good and bad and make your own decision
Just be true to yourself and things will be comin' 
Don't ever try to make them smile at you
For in return they'll turn their back on you 
A prophecy that's what I say
And you'll find out some day
A chosen one that's what you are
Some day your bound to find your way 
You'll fight in a world that don't seen real
You'll have to fight in that world you don't believe in
Don't you try to resist for things will be comin' 
Hit by a car in the streets of deserted town
Wake up in your dreams wondering where you're around 
I will be lord of this land
I will be ruler of this land
No one can stop me anyway
This will all be mine some day 
And you can't run away
Away from your destiny
Now you can't deny
The part you're bound to play 
Run but you can't get away
Run but you won't change your fate
Don't try to hideaway
I'll wait for you someday
