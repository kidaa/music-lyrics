Mekong Delta, J. Jenkins
Hear them sing the tales of glory
About a man so brave and wise
He subdued the hated tyrant
But he's unlucky, hear his cries 
Why, why, why
All of mine are dead and gone why, why
Oh, my absence was too long why, why, why
Bloody vengeance's what I swear why, why
Heroes grief, it makes me stong! 
In the world's most darkest hour
When he prevents the fall of man
He shakes off the yoke of evil
He is the saviour of all land 
Why, why, why
These betrayers killed my love why, why
But there soon will come the day why, why, why
For their treason they must pay why, why
Heroes grief, it makes me strong!
