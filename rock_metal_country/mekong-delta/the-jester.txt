I'm a member of the motley crew
Pleasing the rich and kings
When I make 'em laugh
Nobody even cares
What's inside my mind
Don't seen to get what I'm looking for
And I can't stand it anymore
Can't you see
Can't you see 
I sit and wait till the big boss's calling me
How I wish I could hideaway
You'll see me smile
But I'm hurt inside
How I wish I could break away
I can't stand it anymore
Don't wanna play the fool no more
Gotta break away
Gotta break away 
When you gaze at me
It's like a look into a mirror
And here is what you're bound to see
Someone like you
Leading a kind
Of life that's killing me
I'm gonna get what I'm yearning for
Break out and play my part no more
Here is what I say
Here is what I say 
Don't drag me down
Don't push me around
Don't drag me down
Don't push me around 
I'm gonna get what I'm yearning for
Break out and play my part no more
Here is what I say
Here is what I say 
Don't drag me down
Don't push me around
Don't drag me down
Don't push me around 
I'll be just what I wanna be
Wanna be disperately
I'll be just what I wanna be
