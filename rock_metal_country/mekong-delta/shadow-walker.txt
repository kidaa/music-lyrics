R. Hubert, R. Hubert
He was thinking it out
and started writing it down
the crazy thoughts in his head
He was on a roll
to find his self control
but it was taking it's toll
instead
Meanwhile outside
as the normal crowd
did their daily thing
they were caught in a swing
when they looked at their leaders
they were full of doubt
He couldn't figure them out 
It was a journey down
into his deepest dreams
against the normal streams
wasn't totally clear
But he knew it was here
what he was trying to be
Yeah
And outside his door
was the camera light
that devouered the night
what a terrible sight
it was spilling grace
and wisdom over the crowd
made them feel so proud 
Walking - a member of the crowd
Talking - chit-chat without a doubt
Feeling - cancelled from the normal life
Living - on the shadow side 
Out of the dark - I will dive into the light
I will - gonna rise up from the crowd
I will - be a star in TV land
That's right - be a hero for a day
I will - gonna fill the headline news
Yes me - with the things that I will do
Solution - for their senseless talk
I will - be a star in TV land

Silent dreamings, silent dreamings 
and with a final thought
of his new glory he sought
he felt the time drawing near
So when he started to dress
he knew he wanted his best
took a look what he had
in here
When everything was in place
he finally put on his face
a last and lovely smile
keep it on for a while
Then he started to stroke
the pistol's cold black cheek
it was shiny and sleek 
Walking - a member of the crowd
Talking - chit-chat without a doubt
Feeling - cancelled from the normal life
Living - on the shadow side 
Out of the dark - I will dive into the light
I will - gonna rise up from the crowd
I will - be a star in TV land
That's right - be a hero for a day
I will - gonna fill the headline news
Yes me - with the things that I will do
Solution - for their senseless talk
I will - be a star in TV land 
So he shot at the light
paralizing the night
with the ordiance of might
it was over so fast
he walked out of the shadows
and then into the past
oh yeah
Then it hit him so hard
like a fallen star
and left a permanent scare
this is what you are
He'd become one of those
that he hated the most
ruling a mindless crowd 
Walking - a member of the crowd
Talking - chit-chat without a doubt
Feeling - cancelled from the normal life
Living - on the shadow side 
Out of the dark - I will dive into the light
I will - gonna rise up from the crowd
I will - be a star in TV land
That's right - be a hero for a day
I will - gonna fill the headline news
Yes me - with the things that I will do
Solution - for their senseless talk
I will - be a star in TV land
