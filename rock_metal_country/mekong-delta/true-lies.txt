"Hello people, this is Jason, back again on channel 5, here are the news:
Mr. President declared his mind for peace and admitted the contra's support -
...All we need is economical development!
A congess member said: "He's wise..." 
All I hear is lies guns for freedom
But they're true lies!
We are goddamn manipulated
We are so guilty at their truth
It's our duty to be true to ourselves 
They move the mountains, the force of nature on it's knees and they are your personal gods
Paper's patient, you can print the way you want it, black on white - the reborn truth
...All we need is economical development!
A congess member said: "He's wise..." 
All I hear is lies guns for freedom
But they're true lies!
We are goddamn manipulated
We are so guilty at their truth
It's our duty to be true to ourselves 
These's danger in their speech, born from unholy greed. Their lies made them believe in it.
