Mekong Delta, J. Jenkins
Brahma made it happen long ago - apemen came
Vishnu had created all we know - he explored
Chakravartin's turning the world's wheel - he found out
Shiva now is coming for the kill - he destroyed 
Shiva's return 
Population's growning day by day - time for war
Chemistry will make us all insane - dead is life
Industry's polluting what we breathe - grass's still green
Nuclear disasters bring disease - don't panic 
Time goes by - It's a daily war
One more crime - Against life itself
Mother earth - Nature don't need men
Shiva's here - We can't survive without her 
Brahma made it happen long ago - you don't need
Vishnu had created all we know - to have fear
Chakravartin's turning the world's wheel - for your soul
Shiva now is coming for the kill - but your health 
Shiva's return
