Searching - for competence
Dreaming - of innocence
Finding - no consequence 
Moving around
Without a doubt
Betray the crowd
Showing ways out 
Breeding - the nothingness
Feeding - the loneliness
Killing - the happiness 
Ruling the lands
Guilty as sin
Talk with their hands
Playing to win 
There's no shame for
Their greed to make more
rules they preyed for
