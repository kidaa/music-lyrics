Sacrifice the innocent
Free the guilty - Where is the sense
Nothing certain, nothing left
You sleep heavy, dream of death 
They kill for gods which they say talk to them
I've seen some pictures we should show to him 
Just talking we all know the ones
Unable to find solutions 
No honour, only in the past
Remember that your vote is cast, vote is cast 
My weary eyes weap so full of pain
I've seen too much, been too much to complain
Promises broken and unfullfilled 
Taxes rising, can't believe
Soon they'll tax the air we breathe
Pay for something, pay again
We're all victims in the end 
Maybe they'll kill us for what we believe
Or what has happened in past centuries 
Unable to find solutions
Just looking at television 
We're getting older, waiting for change
We did not realize the truth once again
Promises broken and unfullfilled
