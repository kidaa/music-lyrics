Music by M.Mussorgski, Lyrics by Bjoern Eklund & Doug Lee
10:20
Subterranean sound of hypernatural voices
Appearance of the spirit of darkness, followed by that of Satan himself
Glorification of Satan and celebration of the black mess the Sabbath revealed
At the night of the orgius the bell of the village church, sounding in the distance, disperses the spirit of darkness
Daybreak
