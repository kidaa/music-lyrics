R. Hubert, R. Hubert
Wading through the oceans of minced dreams
while they puke some little pieces of
surreal truth to feed the stupid crowd
The endless kiss of him that made them proud
so the rigid lens gives you
the perfect view
into the heated
heart of bloody polished steel
and
as they started dancing on mutilated humanity
you can hear them paying homage to their
unknown fear 
See what we have given you
See what we can do for you 
We just do what we are told
We must do what we are told
for religion we are sold
We just do what we are told
for religion we are sold
all we touch is dead and cold 
And while they exorcise what they believe
always flagging honour and justice
vindication for their blinded greed
so that you can play the innocent
'cause you learned how to behave
in a
virtuell world that's
full of mutilated dreams
and
as they started dancing on mutilated humanity
you can hear them paying homage to their
unknown fear 
See what we can give for you
See what we have done for you
all we have is here before you
accept our lives, we must implore you
