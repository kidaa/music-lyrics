Mekong Delta, J. Jenkins
I'm given order to survive
No way to spare the other's life
The battle must be finished now
We'll purificate this damned town 
Kill the enemy 4x 
I've struggled hard without success
I gave them all my very best
The again is now I'm kicked aside
I would be starved if I won't fight 
We embody the depravity
Those ones propriety
They'll curse the day they're born when
We've got them under fire 
Kill the enmy 4x 
repeat first and third verse 
Kill the enemy 4x
