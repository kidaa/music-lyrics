B. Eklund, Mekong Delta
Way back in ancient days
I took the shape of a golden idol
They knelt in front of me
Worshipped me; Prayed to me
I saw the greed in their eyes 
Longing - fame and fortune
Yearning - wine and women
Craving - gold and happiness
Demanding - Eternal life, eternal life 
I saw them burning down
Cities and countries
They killed millions of men
To please me; to calm me down
I saw the greed in their eyes 
Longing - fame and fortune
Yearning - wine and women
Craving - gold and happiness
Demanding - Eternal life, eternal life 
I've been around for so long
Their faith and devotion make me strong 
I saw them burning down
Cities and countries
They killed millions of men
To please me; to calm me down
I saw the greed in their eyes 
Longing - fame and fortune
Yearning - wine and women
Craving - gold and happiness
Demanding - Eternal life, eternal life 
They've prayed at my altar
With heads bowed real low
And I've been around
Where ever they go
Where ever they go
Until the end
The end of time
There's no escape
How I like your
Sacrifices
Ever since time began
Ever since time began
