B. Eklund, Mekong Delta
Ambitious
I am
Gonna save this world
Drums beatin'
Soldiers marchin'
Don't stand in our way
Over the hills
We march
The final showdown is near
I am chosen
To be
Saviour of this world 
Marching on
Through this land
My dreams
They'll all come true
I will never ever fail 
We just do what's right
We will never die 
The world ain't real
The weak one cries
Soon he'll face the truth
Over the hills
We march
The final showdown is here 
Dawn is here
But what I see
I simply can't believe
Soldiers, soldiers, soldiers everywhere
As far as I can see
Billions of enemies
Bound to tear my world apart
Now that I face the facts
I gotta realize
Something must have been wrong from the start
I can see
Them smile at me
I know the end is near
That's the curse of reality 
Curse of reality
