B. Eklund, Mekong Delta
On the air, words of wisdom spread across this land
and nod your heads in faithful trust in me, trust me 
So senseless - there's no doubt about it
So senseless - when you hear the latest news
So senseless - you'll accept my opinion
So senseless - as plain facts and truth 
TV sets and the radio, we bring real life to your homes
This is the question of trust 
Politicians, talking 'bout affairs that don't concern you
Just close your eyes and drift away, trust me 
So senseless - identical faces
So senseless - the same stupid talk
So senseless - let's fight for entertainment
So senseless - then have a drink at the bar 
Switch on the TV and you will find life's so much brighter with us
This is the question of trust 
Question of trust
Question of trust
Question of trust
Question of... 
Switch on the TV and you will find life's so much brighter with us
Come home from work, feeling weary and out. We kill your boredom and thoughts
Pay some more bucks for a fifty-inch screen. Our second hand world will seem real
This is a question of trust
