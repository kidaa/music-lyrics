Tell me your thoughts
I want to live for a day
And the way that we lost
But a ?? under the train
Got crissed not crossed
Left the keys in the car
So the legs have to walk
Desert terrain and the wayward plain
Waiting for rain
And the ?? ain't afraid
Of what pain might be
To the pleasure we knew
Before we had to move on
I did my best for you

Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo

Darker
We dance alone this way
It's getting darker
We dance alone this way

I waited for a fire
To collide with the planet
Tried to get back on the world
As it was turning around
?? pieces
?? crashed
Watching every minute
Of the ?? passed
'Cause motions wearing down
All my thoughts
'Til they're all smoothed out
Like rocks were tossed
Nooks and ??
We descended on the reality
Down below

Darker
We dance alone this way
It's getting darker
We dance alone this way

I'm gonna grab a train
Gonna break the hope
I put the life beating out
Like a stray in a boat
Let the scenery pass
Like a blown-out TV
Thought I saw a ghost
But it might have been me
Might have been the world
That was moving too fast
Caught up in the future
That was coming to pass
Now looking for a place
Where the lights unravel
Last ditch road
Trespassers travel on

Darker
We dance alone this way
It's getting darker
We dance alone this way

We dance alone this way
