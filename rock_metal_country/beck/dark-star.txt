Disappointment condition
A perfunctory prescription
Of an indigent mindset
A beligerant silence
We got all we need
Turning out of a tin can
Thinking about the ??
Of the social hurt
Listen to the noise
On the battery tape deck
A Judas trainwreck
Anonymous suspect
Hovering in carbon monoxide cremations
Loners ??
Of vacant locations
Think tanks empty
International dream bank
Plug in my reactor
To the fallout zone
The enemies' story is a lot like mine
And if you get to the point
Then you had better deny

Dark star ??
Eyes are closing
??
From a sky lit terrain

Autopilot drivers
Riding out on the ice age
Infidels swallowed
In a vanishing point
Ammunition souls shooting
Holes in the ozone
Widows tears
Washing a soldier's bones
Sterilized egos
Delirium seagulls
Punctured by the arrows
Of American eagles
Robot teachers
??
Backspace my brain
My equilibrium gone

Dark star
Just an eye that is closing
??
From a sky lit terrain

One, two
One, two
You know what to do
