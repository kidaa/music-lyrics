Keep on talking like a novacane hurricane
Low static on the poor man's short-wave
Stampede's got to dismantle
Code-red: what's your handle

Mission incredible undercover convoy
Full-tilt chromosome cowboy
X-ray search and destroy
Smoke stack black top novacane boy

Got so low your mom won't drum
Getting late with the suicide beat
Test-tube, still-born and dazed
Chump scum plays in the razor's haze
Got the momentum radioactive
Lowdown

Step aside for the operation
Don't expect to generation
Crying out loud down the turnpike
Hundred hours on the miracle mic
Grinding the gears eighteen wheels
Pigs and robots riding on their heels
Lightblue robot making a sandbox
Diesel infernos burning like drano
Down the horizon purple gasses
Semi-trucks hauling them asses
Novacane, hit the road expressway
Explode

Novacane, novacane
