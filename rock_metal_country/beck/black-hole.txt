Windy
Windy
Looking for a better home
Gotta be
Gotta be 
Running out of lightbulbs
Crowded
Crowded 
Open to a wastecan
Yellow car
Yellow car 
Better be inside there
Wake up
Wake up
Nothing's gonna harm you
Glass wall
Glass wall 
Standing on the furniture
Little boy
Little boy
Laying on a sleeping bag
Watching
Watching
Through the cracks of his eyelids
Stranger
stranger
Feeling like a broken stone
Lost him
Lost him
Standing on the orange chairs
Alphabet
Alphabet
Can't afford a telephone
Black hole
Black hole
Nothing's gonna harm you
