Ahhhhhhhhhh

You only got one finger left and it's pointing at the door
And you're taking for granted what the Lord's made on the floor
So I'm picking up the pieces and I'm putting them up for sale
Throw your meal ticket out the window, put your skeletons in jail

'Cause Lord only knows it's getting late
Your senses are gone so don't you hesitate
To give yourself a call let your bottom dollars fall
Throwing your two bit cares down the drain

Invite me to the seven seas like some seasick man
You will do whatever you please and I'll do whatever I can
Titantic, fare thee well, my eyes are turning pink
Don't call us when the new age gets old enough to drink

'Cause Lord only knows it's getting late
Your senses are gone so don't you hesitate
Move on up the hill there's nothing dead left to kill
Throwing your two bit cares down the drain

Odelay, odelay, odelay, odelay odelay, odelay
Just passing through
Odelay, odelay, odelay, odealy

Going back to Houston
Do the hotdog dance
Going back to Houston
To get me some pants
