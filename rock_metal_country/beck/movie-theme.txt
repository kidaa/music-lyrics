Looking for a ladder
In the stratosphere
So I can be happy
Let my problems melt away

Running on a plane
With a cigarette
I carry my heart
Like a soldier with a hand grenade

Walking down the aisle
Of the supermarket
Looking for the ??
To carry my senses away

Listen to a voice
On the telephone
Somebody's calling
Somebody on the way

Looking for a home
In the magazine page
Wages in my pocket
Gonna buy me anything I need

Thought in my brain
Batting an eye
Washing away
??

I'm not scared
'Cause there's nobody there
Mind is awake
Nothing's gonna lead me astray

Listen to the voice
On the radio wave
Somebody needs you
Somebody who is
On their way
