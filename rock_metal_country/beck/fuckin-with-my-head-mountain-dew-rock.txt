I ain't got no inclination
Give away my sweet sensation 
Sleepin' in an old toolshed 
Scumbag cryin' on his pillow

Oooh...
When you wanna be with me then we will see
Who's fuckin' with my head
Hey hey hey hey
Fuckin' with my head
Hey hey hey hey

Found myself in New Orleans
With a scarecrow in my jeans
Feed my forehead through the ceilin'
Drank my coffee with a hubcap
Yeah

Oooh...
When you want to be with me then we will see
Who's fuckin' with my head
No no no no
Fuckin' with my head
Hey hey hey hey

Devil's got your pantyhose on his head
Oh yeah, and he's robbin' me
But all I got's cornbread
Well, you turn my body into a crutch
And now I'm limpin' all over
When I feel your touch
Oh yeah

Oooh...
Oooh...

Put on my jack-eyed boots
Runnin' wild on the bayou
Now I'm talkin' on a walkie-talkie
Credit card glued to my hand
Feels good

Oooh...
When you wanna be with me then we will see
Who's fuckin' with my head
Hey hey hey hey
No no no no
Fuckin' with my head
Make me feel like an asshole
I ain't got no soul
I ain't got no soul
No no no no
No no no no
No no no no
No no no no
