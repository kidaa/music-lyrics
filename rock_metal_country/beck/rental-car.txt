Hey now girl what's the matter with me 
We're on a back road something to see 
Straight as a razor kickin the dust 
Diggin thru ditches and fallin to rust 

Takin me far 
Far as a rental car can go 

Hey now girl at the end of the road 
Down where the reaper is walkin alone 
Singing a death knell 
Clappin along 
At the end of the night 
There's a road we'll be on 

Takin me far, 
Far as a rental car can go
