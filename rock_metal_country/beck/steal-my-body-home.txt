Put me in a hole in the ground
With the money and the towel
And the women all runnin' around

Can't complain about the mess
Momma killed the only dress
Now she's longin' for the pines

Watch my troubles all unwind
Drinkin' gasoline and wine
Catch a chill off the stove

On the train they cannot feel
Lost my head beneath the wheel
Now she steals my body home

The trees are fake, the air is dead
The birds are stuffed with poison lead
And the ground is much too clean

And if it's only me who's scared
Strap 'em to the electric chairs
Ring the moon like a broken bell

When she drags you from the hill
Daddy's gonna burn down the still
We can watch it from the rooftop

Lay in to the fryin' pan
Now she kisses her own hand
With the fiddle on the fire

I took a leap into the fog
Sleepin' on a hollow log
Now I'm coughin' with no mouth

You can keep yourself inside
But you know you cannot lie
When the devil's your only friend
