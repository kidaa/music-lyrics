They know it's ??
This ?? blindfold
When she crawls from the Himalayan rain
Where the birds of prey are weapons on fire
She's ridin' a landslide down to me
Gettin' the desert under me
Shakin' the dead birds from the trees
Singing the only air we breathe

?? promise in the plate glass summer
Don't call it death ?? plan
She's ridin' a landslide down to me
Sing the shackles off of me
Shakin' the dead birds from the trees
?? the blood that I have ??

Comin' to see herself again
Comin' to sing her song again
Comin' to watch it all
Comin' to see herself again
Comin' to see herself again
Comin' to watch it all
