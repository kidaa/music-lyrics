Ahhh
The information is ravenous
The ticker tape feeds the mind
Looking for a lost transmission
A heaven that we left behind
When the information comes
We'll know what we're made from
And the skyline rising
Highrise eyes see for you

Say hello to a mannequin
The ghost of our lonely tongue
Reaching out ??
I was ?? down below
When the information comes
We'll know what we're made from
The skyline rising
Highrise eyes see for you

She's a sister of ??
A wife of a poisonous tongue
She's the eye of a battle of stones
A sister out of control
When the information comes
We'll know what we're made from
The skyline rising
Highrise eyes see for you
