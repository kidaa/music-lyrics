Two white horses in a line carrying me to my burying 
Ground some need diamonds some need love some need 
Cards some need luck 
Some need dollar bills lining their clothes 
All I need is all I need is two white horses in a line taking 
Me for my farewell ride some may say this might be 
Your last farewell ride 
I don't see the face of 
Kindness I don't hear the 
Mission bells I don't smell 
The morning roses all I see 
Is all I see is 
Two white horses in a line 
Carrying me to my burying ground 
Some may say this might be 
Your last farewell ride
