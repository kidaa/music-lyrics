Come gather round me people,
Here's a story you never heard
'Bout me and my friends
And some things that occured
We thought we'd get some money,
We thought that we might go
Spend a weekend pleasant down in Mexico

I was workin at McDonalds,
Doin' the latenight run
When a car pulled up the drive thru
And pointed out a gun
Said give us all your money
And three big macs to go
I stuffed them all in a bag
And I ducked down below

Well the boss got angry when he found out
I didn't call the police
I guess I was kinda nervous,
There was a warrant out on me
Concernin' some jaywalkin tickets
I couldn't afford to pay
Needless to say I got the axe that same day

Well me bein' outta work just then
I didn't wanna go home
My mom said if I lost this job
I'd have to go out on my own
So I went over to Dave's house
And got really stoned
Called up some girls
But none o' them were home

Steve came over and he brought some alcohol
We're all gettin really depressed
Just starin' at the wall
Thought we'd get some money,
We thought that we might go
Spend a weekend pleasant down in Mexico

Steve's dad had a huntin' rifle
And we went and picked it up
And we stopped into the 7-11 to try our luck
We raised up that huntin' rifle 
But the counter guy just laughed
As he pulled out an uzi
We turned and hauled ass

We were runnin so fast 'til we came
To the McDonalds where I used to work
We walked up to the drive thru
And gave my boss a jerk
said give us all your money
And three big macs to go
And suck on this you weasel
We're goin to Mexico

Down south we all got really wasted,
Dave got a case of the runs
We're all really hungover
And gettin low on funds
Dave and Steve called their parents
And took the bus back home
me, I got a job at McDonalds down in Mexico
