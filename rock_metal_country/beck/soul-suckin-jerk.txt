I got a job making money for the man
Throwing chicken in the bucket 
With the soda pop can 
Puke green uniform on my back
I had to set it on fire
In a vat of chicken fat
I leaped on the counter
Like a bird with no hair
Running through the mini mall in my underwear

I got lost downtown
Couldn't find a ride home
Sun went down I got frozen to the bone 
'til a hooker let me share
Her fake fur coat
As I took a little nap
The cops picked up us both
I tried to explain
I was only trying to get warm 
I knew I never ever
Should have burnt my uniform 
He said:
'Too bad, better bite the bullet hard son' 
I didn't have no teeth so I stole his gun 
And I crawled out the window
With my shadow on a spoon 
Dancing on the roof
Shooting holes in the moon

Get busy, get busy, you know it

I ain't gonna work for no soul suckin jerk 
I'm gonna take it all back
And I ain't sayin jack 
I ain't gonna work for no soul suckin jerk 
I'm gonna take it all back
And I ain't sayin jack

Standing right here with a beer in my hand
And my mouth is full of sand
And I don't understand 
Fourteen days I been sleeping in a barn
Better get a paycheck tattooed on my arm 
Whistlin dixie with the dixie cup filled 
With the barbecue sauce
And the dental floss chill 
Big fat fingers pointing into my face 
Telling me to get busy
Cleaning up this place 
I got bent like a wet cigarette 
And she's coming after me
With a butterfly net 
Ridin on a bloodhound ringing the bell 
Black cat wrapped in the road map to hell

Pencil on my leg and I'm trying not to beg
Taking turns bakin worms
With the bacon and eggs 
Well they got me in a bird cage 
Flappin my jaw like a pretzel
In the stars just waitin to fall 
So give me what I got to get so I can go 
Cause I ain't washin dishes
In the ditch no more

And I ain't gonna work
For no soul suckin jerk 
I'm gonna take it all back
And I ain't sayin jack 
And I ain't gonna work
For no soul suckin jerk 
I'm gonna take it all back
And I ain't sayin jack
