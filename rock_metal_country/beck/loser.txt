In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey
butane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkie
with the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetables
dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
kill the headlights and put it in neutral
stock car flamin' with a loser and the cruise control
baby's in Reno with the vitamin D 
got a couple of couches, sleep on the love-seat 
someone came in sayin' I'm insane to complain
about a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
don't believe everything that you breathe 
you get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
so shave your face with some mace in the dark
savin' all your food stamps and burnin' down the trailer park 

yo. Cut it.

Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me

double-barrel buckshy

Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me

Forces of evil on a bozo nightmare 
ban all the music with a phony gas chamber 
'cuz one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag
one's on the pole, shove the other in a bag
with the rerun shows and the cocaine nose-job
the daytime crap of the folksinger slob
he hung himself with a guitar string
a slab of turkey-neck and it's hangin' from a pigeon wing
you can't write if you can't relate
trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate
and my time is a piece of wax fallin' on a termite
that's chokin' on the splinters

Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me 
get crazy with the cheeze whiz 
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me 
drive-by body-pierce 
yo bring it on down 
soooooooyy.... 
chorus backwards
I'm a driver, I'm the winner; things are gonna change I can feel it 

Soy un perdedor 
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me 
I can't believe you 
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me 
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me 
[repeat] 
Sprechen sie Deutches, baby 
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me 
Know what I'm sayin'
