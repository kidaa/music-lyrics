[ Come on, motherfucker. Put your clothes on, come on. Asshole! 
 You lousy puke! 
 Fuck you! 
 Why don't you call your mommy 
 You're a fucking drunk. 
 Yeah, I'm a fucking drunk... 
 Come on, motherfucker. 
 ...but you're a lousy lowlife who can't do nothin' for himself. 

Acid casualty with a reposessed car
Vietnam vet playin' air guitar

It's just the shit-kickin', speed-takin'
Truck-drivin' neighbours downstairs
Yeah...yeah

Whiskey-stained buck-toothed
Backwards creep
Grizzly bear motherfucker
Never goes to sleep

It's just the shit-kickin', speed-takin'
Truck-drivin' neighbours downstairs 
Oh, yeah...yeah

Belly floppin' naked
In a pool of yellow sweat
Screamin' jackass with a wet cigarette

It's just the shit-kickin', speed-takin'
Truck-drivin' neighbours downstairs

Oh
Oh, my goodness
Oh...
Mmm...

Psychotic breakdown double-edged axe
Growin' hair like a shag rug
On his greasy back

It's just the shit-kickin', speed-takin'
Truck-drivin' neighbours downstairs

Oh my goodness
Oh my goodness

Oh, yeah
Come on, honey
Feel the grease, grease, grease
Come on, honey, feel the grease
Oh, my goodness
Come on, honey, feel the grease
Oh yeah
Come on, lay it on me
Bring it down one more time
Come on, honey...
