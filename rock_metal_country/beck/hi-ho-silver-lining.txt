You're everywhere and no where, baby,
thats where you're at,
Going down a bumpy hillside,
In your hippy hat.
Flying out across the country
And getting fat ?!
Saying everything is groovy
When your tyres are flat

Chorus
And its hi - ho sheffield wednesday
and away you go now baby,
I see your sun is shining
But I wont make a fuss
Though its obvious.

Flies are in your pea soup baby,
They're waving at me
Anything you want is yours now
Only nothing is for free.
Lies are gonna get you some day
Just wait and see.
So open up your beach umbrella
While you are watching TV

Chorus

Instrumental.

Chorus to fade.
