Lord, please don't forsake me
In my Mercedes Benz
All the riches and the ruins
Now we all know how that story ends

Strange apparition
Haunting my brain
Standing on the last legs
Of a dream that walked away

When the Lord rings my front door
And asks me what I got to show
Besides the dust in my pockets
And the things that just eat away my soul

Strange apparition
Haunting my brain
There's some permissions
Of a dream that got cremated

The least I had to lose from
Is the most I seem to care
Anything should make you happy
Nothing could make you scared

We'll be on the shoreline
When that heavy ship goes down
Did you think that you were lucky?
You should see yourself now
