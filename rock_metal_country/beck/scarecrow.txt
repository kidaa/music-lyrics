I'm walkin to the other side 
With the devil tryin to take my mind 
And my soul's just a silhouette 
In the ashes of a cigarette 

Illusions never fake their lies 
Trick cards fool the eye 
Carry zeros over till they add up 
Bury tears in the chapters you shut 
Sometimes the jail can't chain the cell 
And the rain's too plain to tell 
All alone by a barren well 
The scarecrow's only scarin himself 

I've been diggin the ground 
Thru the dust and the clouds 
I see miles and miles 
And the junkyard piles 
I wanted hope from a grave 
I wanted strength from a slave 
What gives you comfort now 
Might be the end of you then 
Crows are pullin at my clothes 
The wind got my fingers froze 
Standing all day keepin watch 
Over all the treasures we lost 
Sometimes the jail can't chain the cell 
And the rain's too plain to tell 
All alone by a barren well 
The scarecrow's only scarin himself
