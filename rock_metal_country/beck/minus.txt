The last survivor of a boiled crap
Another casualty with the casual frown
The janitor vandals they bark in your face
Juveniles with the piles and paste

It's a sensation
A bankrupt corpse
In the garbage classes
With the crutches of frogs

Don't be confused when the fuse is up
And you're taking a leak into your brother's cup
When the cup is filled you can run and be killed
In the billion miles of the muscles that build

Radiation
Feeling the force
Karaoke
Vomiting morons

The scalps of zero hair on the call
Rubbing in a blind man's running mall
With the cancer sores and the robot pants
Throwing imbeciles on the window sills

It's a sensation
A bankrupt corpse
In the garbage classes
With the crutches of frogs

Frogs, frogs, frogs
