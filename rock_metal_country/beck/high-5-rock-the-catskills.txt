High 5, high 5
High 5, high 5

 quot;C'mon on, 8, everybody, c'mon, 7, c'mon, now, 6, 5
Aw, yeah, I like that shit quot;

When I rock it's like a high 5
Want a slap in the face I love the taste
All my days with my wheelchair ways
Watch me die in my suicide high
I don't mean it 'cause I only come on to you
When I step to the room with a powerful motion
Leopard skin let the records spin
'Round and round with the speed of sound

High 5, more dead than alive
Rocking the plastic like a man from the Catskills
High 5, more dead than alive
Rocking the plastic like a man from the Catskills

Rocky mountain low we gotta go
Put that gadget in the random mode
Cripple candy rocking the candy
Rhumba, brickshot, doing the foxtrot
In my car sweating like a dog
Beers and chairs no frontiers
On my way from the 'Frisco Bay
Dixieland, soda-pop man

High 5, more dead than alive
Rocking the plastic like a man from the Catskills
High 5, more dead than alive
Rocking the plastic like a man from the Catskills

Yeah, put that machine in random mode
Talking about popping jugger
Like the last century

 quot;Turn that shit off, man, what's wrong with you
Man, get the other record, damn quot;

High 5, more dead than alive
Rocking the plastic like a man from the Catskills
High 5, more dead than alive
Rocking the plastic like a man from the Catskills
High 5, more dead than alive
Rocking the plastic like a man from the Catskills
High 5, more dead than alive
Rocking the plastic like a man from the Catskills

 quot;Ok, now, do like designer jeans
Everybody, designer jeans, say, say, say, say, say: ooh, la la, sasoon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Everybody
One more time, let me hear you say: ooh, la la, sasoon
Just do it everybody, c'mon
Now I want the ladies
All the ladies, say: Sergio Valente, sing it, girl
Let me hear you say: Sergio Valente
Say: Jordache quot;
