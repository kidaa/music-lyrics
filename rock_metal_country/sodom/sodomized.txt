The first time I've tasted blood
Saw the wide spread dying off
Incurable diseased and on the loose
Remember the atrocities
Stop the painful miseries
Waiting for the dead man's shoes

I need at last your private parts
To satisfy my fucking pride

Magnitude of my oppression
Without pity and compassion
No tenderness within my heart
From the cradle to the grave
A brand of wickedness
Nobody tried to shift my ground

I need at last your private parts
To satisfy my fucking pride

Sodomised
Sodomised
Sodomised
Sodomised

When I look into your face
I want you to deflorate
My heart fulfilled with love
Embodiment of my desire
To find your never ending fire
Agony from aboveI need at last your private parts
To satisfy my fucking pride

Sodomised
Sodomised
Sodomised
Sodomised

Decades of a hundred misconducts
Ain't got no chance to live
A life of intercourse and lust
My eyes reborn of pleasure
Firing squads, cursed forever
Sleep of the just

I need at last your private parts
To satisfy my fucking pride

Sodomised
Sodomised
Sodomised
Sodomised
