2:57
I saw your face in the crowd
Impressed so deep inside my heart
Nothing gonna stop me now
Seduce this little whore

Your soul was dipped in venom
Your dignity with angel's words
Sweetness of your dirty love
That makes me feel so good

Refracting the light of my dreams
Darkening the sun of my hopes
Like silhouette of dissimulation
Like a shadow of damnation

Riding on a train I cannot control
Through all the pain, through all the sorrow
It's just the passion I demand
It's just the road that never endsRefracting the light of my dreams
Darkening the sun of my hopes
Like silhouette of dissimulation
Like a shadow of damnation

You are acting on your playground
To see me creep and crawl
God-awful my dependence
Upon this greedy soul
Lacerated by your passion
The devil seems to be with you
Secret wishes, satisfaction
Emotions of a fool

Refracting the light of my dreams
Darkening the sun of my hopes
Like silhouette of dissimulation
Like a shadow of damnation

Like a shadow of damnation
Like a shadow of damnation
Like a shadow of damnation
