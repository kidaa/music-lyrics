Sitting on a throne of genocide
Our master regal and glory
Subject for suppressions land
Fairness find no place to expand
All his soldiers di to live
In labyrints of death
Buring temples in town of spell
Prepared for damnation to hell

Young blood envoyed
From endless starlight
Behats in right season
For ending the treason

Pretenders to the Throne
Betrayed, forgotten and alone
Pretenders to the Throne
Our mighty child is born

RepeatYou confirm me by oath with magic signs
Possesses from your masterhs brightness
You bring me forms of ever open eyes
Token erect of thorny thigh

In his tyrannical lust
He kills and tortured all who sreams
"In god we trust"
Raise the merciless fight
Against a wird might
Come on, lets overthrow only chance
Change of sovereign is our deliverance

Pretenders to the Throne
