I detest the awful day when you was born
Your mind, your soul genetically deformed
The nature struck back with a fatal mistake
In witness whereof what hell can create

The darkside of the mocking curse
Fervent love your pet averse
Thousands blugeoned lifes
Dastardly cowardice

Cowardice - a freezing touch
Cowardice - bloody embrace

Innocent blood adorns your raping hands
Importunity and lewdness systematically planned
Predominant signs that we have to demoan
Are deeply engraved in yourself to go on

The darkside of the mocking curse
Fervent love your pet averse
Thousands blugeoned lifes
Dastardly cowardice

Cowardice - a freezing touch
Cowardice - bloody embraceThe crunch of the dawn
Victims were found
Salvation in their eyes
Instinctive urge
Tremendous search
Deranged and Paralyzed
Virginal flesh
Summon the death
Perception really numb
A horrible man
The beautiful maid
And then your purge is done

Dewey eyed trusting and kissing the rods
Offering hands to the snapping dogs
Praying for god everyday for his scorn
Why didn't your mother get killed before?

The darkside of the mocking curse
Fervent love your pet averse
Thousands blugeoned lifes
Dastardly cowardice

Cowardice - a freezing touch
Cowardice - bloody embrace

Why didn't your mother get killed before?
