The sons of the night
The god of the light
Escorted by a rolling thunder
There is no grace
There is no guilt
Enflamed by a human wonder

Looking through my eyes
And see the wisdom from above
Execution of my mind
And spiteful symbols all around
Born to be a man
Who has no nature and no name
Can't wait 'til death arise
Spiritual Demise

Lifeless dreams
Racial kings
Absorbing through my eyes
Godlike creatures
False god leaders
Fighting side by side

Looking through my eyes
And see the wisdom from above
Execution of my mind
And spiteful symbols all around
Born to be a man
Who has no nature and no name
Can't wait 'til death arise
Spiritual DemiseGive me the sign that I release
Like words of mystery
Invoking for the breeding madness
Eternal fleshly seed
This hate could fill my perverse heart
Erections now spill blood
This mortal dust that rides the wind
And fire born by sparks

Corrosive sins
Blanched my soul
That hell out of control
With open arms
A peaceful dusk
And satan takes me home

Looking through my eyes
And see the wisdom from above
Execution of my mind
And spiteful symbols all around
Born to be a man
Who has no nature and no name
Can't wait 'til death arise
Spiritual Demise

This hate could fill my perverse heart
Erections now spill blood
This mortal dust that rides the wind
And fire born by sparks
