2:37
Give me a sign that you exist
At the threshold of entrance
I'm filled with hopes and yearning
To find a way beyond the death

Condemned to leave this awful world
Don't try to stop me I'm resolute
To commit suicide
You'll see the murder in my eyes

Something whispering in my ears
"Come on take my hand"
Rising up to the other side
Recovered from the badCondemned to leave this awful world
Don't try to stop me I'm resolute
To commit suicide
You'll see the murder in my eyes

Locked up in a hidden room
I have to pay the price
Carried away by the end of the light
Wonderful to die

Condemned to leave this awful world
Don't try to stop me I'm resolute
To commit suicide
You'll see the murder in my eyes
