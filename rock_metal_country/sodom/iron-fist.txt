Cover : MotrheadDark night nothing to see
Invisible hand in front of me
Scared to death there's some one near
Scared to move but you can't stay here

You know me, evil eye
You know me, prepare to die
You know me, the snakebites kiss
Devils grip, the iron fist

Flying horse don't make a sound
Flying hooves don't touch the ground
Walk in circles loose your tracks
Can't go on but you can't go backYou know me, evil eye
You know me, prepare to die
You know me, you can't resist
Devils grip, the iron fist

Moon eclipse and you know why
Ghost rider in the sky
Beast of evil devil's hound
Tooth and claw they pull you down

You know me, evil eye
You know me, prepare to die
You know me, the snakebites kiss
Devils grip, the iron fist
