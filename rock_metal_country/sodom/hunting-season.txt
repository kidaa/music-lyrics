I was granted no quarter
Because you forgot the rules
The words I said are
Sure to come true
Your empty promises
Treacherous and blind
Your deceitful lies call
The war back to my mind

I learnt a way to survive
The enemy to neutralise
They got no reason
Hunting season

I want to set the world on fire
Like a savage beast - A final desire
I burn my boats surrounded by danger
A soldier in hiding kicked out like a stranger

I learnt a way to survive
The enemy to neutralise
They got no reason
Hunting seasonI avail every chance
It's a pleasure for me
To slay one by one
To fight for liberty
Once a lieutenant in higher service
Now I'm nothing
A man without mercy

I learnt a way to survive
The enemy to neutralise
They got no reason
Hunting season

I want to set the world on fire
Like a savage beast - A final desire
I burn my boats surrounded by danger
A soldier in hiding kicked out like a stranger

I learnt a way to survive
The enemy to neutralise
They got no reason
Hunting season
