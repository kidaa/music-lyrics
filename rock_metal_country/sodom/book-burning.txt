Slashing the wantoness, grudging deeds
With hearts that have no right to beat
Whispering echoes forcasting my fate
From heaven to hell I spirit away
The shadow of wathers haunting my soul
Replacing my life for a handful of gold
The slings and the fetters of outrageous foes
Peremptory baseness where glory once shone

Losing the ground at the end of the light
Beheading myself no more power to fight
Horror beyond the unnatural fear
Reflection of lies so threatening near

Apathetic servants of the mighty evil
Rushing demise, blind decision
Exhaustion of my will
Habitual turning
Lifeless objects, peaceful symbols
Book burningThe scriptures of freedom devoured by fire
Flushes of anger immortal desire
Appeal to the gods is ceasing unheard
Lamentations sounded imploring absurd
My rage unleashed and my glare is reborn
Sunshine removed by a cold winterstorm
Deliver me god from this treacherous crowd
These crystal nights bring the life to nought

Losing the ground at the end of the light
Beheading myself no more power to fight
Horror beyond the unnatural fear
Reflection of lies so threatening near

Apathetic servants of the mighty evil
Rushing demise, blind decision
Exhaustion of my will
Habitual turning
Lifeless objects, peaceful symbols
Book burning
