Dedicated To : Tom's Dad, who died too early
Your soul disappears in eyes of blue
With dignity and lonely lust
The moon is shining bright to you
Angels adore your mortal dust

Welcome to the paradise
Great master's hands will rise
To bring you to the holy place
Eternal life for a human race

Resurrection
Flesh to your bones
Everlasting fortune
You are born

Resurrection
With flowers of gold
Give credence to heaven
Believe in god

Your spirit was willing but your flesh was weak
Don't wanna leave the world of lies
They're standing around when you go to sleep
And give you no chance to say goodbye
