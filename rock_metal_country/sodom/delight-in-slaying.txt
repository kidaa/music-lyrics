Fear neither men nor fates
No laughter of the folk
No power of the heaven
Desolation of the earth
Worship blood and fire
Worship swords and spears
Damn them who have pity
Kill them who have tears

Delight in slaying
Delight in slaying

Find ecstasy in vengeance
The joy of life and death
Raise yourself in pride
With courage and success
Pity not the fallen
You have never known
These evil ones shall cast away
Strike down them hard and low

Delight in slaying
Delight in slaying
Delight in slaying
DelightDespise also the cowards
The liars and the fools
They are the slaves that perish
They are the stupid brood

Delight in slaying
Delight in slaying

I am the god of war
Supreme and terrible one
My judgements true and righteous
Mourning will come
I am the flame that burns
In every heart of man
Revealed are all the secrets
Reborn are all the saints

Delight in slaying
Delight in slaying
Delight in slaying
Delight in slaying
Delight in slaying
Delight
