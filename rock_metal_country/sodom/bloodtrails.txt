Blood...

Far away from native lands
Operation "Desert Shield"
Prevent a war of conquest
Military blockades
Securing the peace
Fighting for aggressor's rest

Beware of this place
The anger is growing again
Your buds lying there
The symptoms are always the same

Concentration of armies
No diplomatic conversation
Belligerents and lack of self control
Interventions by embargoes
There is a crisis brewing
Wanna get the treasure of the soil

Beware of this place
The anger is growing again
Your buds lying there
The symptoms are always the sameBloodtrails - Effervesced till world war III
Bloodtrails - Suicide to kill the enemy
Bloodtrails - No reasons and no common sense
Bloodtrails - Call you to your end

Bloodtrails...
Bloodtrails...
Bloodtrails...


We got orders and inner instruction
By bad educations
Corrupt might took possession of our souls
From land to land
To form new generations
Where shadows join hand
With their own living dead rules

Beware of this place
The anger is growing again
Your buds lying there
The symptoms are always the same

Bloodtrails - Effervesced till world war III
Bloodtrails - Suicide to kill the enemy
Bloodtrails - No reasons and no common sense
Bloodtrails - Call you to your end
