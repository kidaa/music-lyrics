Don't be afraid of any man
No matter what his size
Just call on me, I will be there
And I will equalise

Peacemaker's law
Thumb-buster's draw
Peacemaker's law
A bad boys war

Don't shoot a man into his back
Ignore his warning signs
Give him a chance to turn around
Maybe you will decide

Peacemaker's law
Thumb-buster's draw
Peacemaker's law
A bad boys war

Never face the fact that you
Throw down the gauntlet to me
Your persuasion I don't care
My sight gives you the creepPeacemaker's law
Thumb-buster's draw
Peacemaker's law
A bad boys war

I'm not afraid of you my friend
No matter what your size
Just call to him in time of need
And he will equalise

Peacemaker's law
Thumb-buster's draw
Peacemaker's law
A bad boys war

Peacemaker's law
Peacemaker's law
