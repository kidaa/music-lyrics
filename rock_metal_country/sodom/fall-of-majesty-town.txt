In a realm governed by gods scorn
Absorbed in solitudes deep
Where men and beast are one
Deads disturbed in eternal peace

There is a town of curse
Crueltys bleeding place
Dreadful illumation of lust
Squat behind the gates of proscription

A memorial that never somebody forget
Once by god created and destroyed
Meaned is the majesty town SODOM
Known in all world by reason of force

Fall of majesty town
SODOM and gomorrah
Fire bring it down
Fall of majesty town
A holy place
Deprived by crown

You are residents of evils kingdom
Raise swords in name of satan
Burn all crucifixion
Symbols of wrong oath
Drive lemdness and let em learn the crime
Kill and hate all these which loved you
Use arms of agony and grieve
Follow your leader with incence obedience
Because only known the battles upshotA memorial that never somebody forget
Once by god created and destroyed
Meaned is the majesty town SODOM
Known in all world by reason of force

Repeat

Fall of majesty town
SODOM and gomorrah
Fire bring it down
Fall of majesty town
A holy place
Deprived by crown

The revence came from exception strong power
An indescrible vandalism action
Disperse the place in innumerable bloodspots
Death is unruly and everywhere
Smell of becahed flesh
Controls the occorrence
Feel hudder of hideous inferno
Pray: your thie will be done...
...and in seven days was the town destroyed
