Cover : TankGet down six feet under
I wish she would, your fat blanket mother
She growls and roars like thunder
A mouth so big, the eighth world wonders
She wants me to throw her daughter away
And pick her up instead...

Don't walk away Don't walk away
Don't walk away Don't walk away

Yes another cunning plot, to get me under her covers
Dior stockings and nothing on top
She ain't like a normal mother
I wish I was a million miles away
So I can't hear her say...

Don't walk away Don't walk away
Don't walk away Don't walk awayDon't don't walk away
Don't don't walk away
Don't don't walk away

When will this dreadful nightmare end?
I really don't want another
That fat blanket woman drives me round and bend
How can you get lower when hell is in the gutter
I wish I was a million miles away
So I can't hear her say...

Don't walk away Don't walk away
Don't walk away Don't walk away
Don't walk away Don't walk away
Don't walk away Don't walk away
