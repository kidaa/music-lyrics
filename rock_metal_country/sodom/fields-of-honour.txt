3:23
Living spaces, contaminated
By all the fatal scrap
They'll coming down, materialised
Enchanted by the grace of god

They'll keep their eyes on you
To turn around the fool
Separate the chaft from the wheat
To save you from decease

Escapism, the end of the road
Last judgement's last decree
Lost games, wrong aims
Blue planet only leased

They'll keep their eyes on you
To turn around the fool
Separate the chaft from the wheat
To save you from decease

Falling on the fields of honour
Falling on the fields of honour

Betrayed souls, ruined lives
Common graves, eradication
Waiting for the end of time
In the battle of annihilationThey'll keep their eyes on you
To turn around the fool
Separate the chaft from the wheat
To save you from decease

Falling on the fields of honour
Falling on the fields of honour

Living spaces, deserted
You've lost the chance you've got
Human race, transiency
A thing of the past

They'll keep their eyes on you
To turn around the fool
Separate the chaft from the wheat
To save you from decease

Falling on the fields of honour
Falling on the fields of honour
Falling on the fields of honour
Falling on the fields of honour
