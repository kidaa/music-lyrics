3:01
Unnatural caresses of a man without remorse
He didn't realize the fact that love can't be commanded
Confusion and depravity, rituals of death
Memories linger in his brain; dreams in a bed of nails

Possessed by all the souvenirs
Possessed by crying children
Spreading madness kile disease
Near death experience

Master of disguise

A dirty smile is integrate into killer's face
Bloodshot eyes stare resolutely, watch the victim's race
Welcome to the surgery; hearts will be removed
Raping to find satisfaction; posing like a dog

Hidden deep inside

When the flame of life grows cold and every lie is true
Ride the wings of sacrifice but never play the fool
Incarnation of the evil one; crushing skulls and bones
You don't belong to the human race
No mercy for your soul
