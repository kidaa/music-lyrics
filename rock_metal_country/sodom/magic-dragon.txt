Camp duc lap calm before the storm
They fight with drowsiness
Rubbed their eyes must stay awake
Stared into the darkness

Disastrous noise from far behind
Imminent attack splits their minds
Forces proceed to counter thrust
Without doubt they will rush

Moon cast a shadow menace comes near
Formed as an aeroplane
Take up weapons to defend the boundary line
Do not want to loose the reign

Disastrous noise from far behind
Imminent attack splits their minds
Forces proceed to counter thrust
Without doubt they will rush

Night into day when flare bombs detonate to burn the sky
Our hostile positions are made out there is no place to hide
The AC-47 send their flames from all the barrels
6000 shots per minute to make a hill all level

Magic Dragon
Let sheets of fire hail down the base
Magic Dragon
A crucial test the enemy will never raise
Magic Dragon
Spit tracer bullets expose our hiding place
Magic Dragon
Iron monsters destroy with rage

Pilots circle their machines as eagles in the sky
Navigator tactical warfare they know the reason why
Because their orders are clear: Crush them to win the war

First squadron obey the command: Take off higher
No Vietcong can move in sustained fire
Orders are clear - Win the war
