2:29
Incubation of a mental disease
Transpiration of a spiteful liquid
Coming to terms with the devil
Threatening like the reaper in a saddle

You sow the seeds of discord
You'll reap the fruits of death

He learned to dominate the gamesmanship of war
An outrage, cynic for use all
You are a rusty nail in our coffin
The world's reminding exibition

One man's meat is another ones poison
So kill yourself with tears of joy
We'll never accept to bite the dist like this
Got a mighty weapon to defend us
