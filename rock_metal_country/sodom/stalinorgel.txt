Declaration of war by a madman
Offensive in blizzards and fog
Opening of the conflagration
Thrust to the hostile front

Snowed up Russian winter
There's nothing shining bright
Resistance in December
Against the deadly light

Stalinorgel
Carry the war into the enemy's camp

Vomiting fire - Infernal thunder

Pugnacity and national defense
Grim struggles hand to hand
Curtain of fire at the frontline
Capitulation and retreat out of this land

Snowed up Russian winter
There's nothing shining bright
Resistance in December
Against the deadly light

Arisen through their own fault by assumption of power
The end is immediately near
Red army struck back in triumphant advance
Madman lost the war and disappeared

Snow covered Russian winter
There's nothing shining bright
Resistance in December
Against the deadly light
