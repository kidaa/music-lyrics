At the back of beyond
Where time stands still
In a paradise of love and hate
Like pack of hounds
Invading the land
Girls sell their bodies
Like hot cakes

Unscrupulous deals
With human flesh
To live the life of Riley
Behaving like bulls
In a China chop
Pots of money but nothing to pay

One step over the line
Diseased by genital desire
One step over the line
Out of the frying pan
And into the firePerverse bents
Clever camouflage
Holidays of infanticide
Mistress of lust
Sold down the river
Exploited and eaten alive

One step over the line
Diseased by genital desire
One step over the line
Out of the frying pan
And into the fire

Once bitten twice shy
She takes you for a ride
The money she needs to survive
Death defying
Sexual act
Welcome to the club where you die
