Something big is brewing
You can see it in my eyes
They burn with a beastly hatred
That will be realised

Why are the innocent dead?
Come on god, answer me
Why are the guilty alive?
Don't want to be deceived

They think they are above the law
They're trying to break my spine
Where is justice, where is punishment
Where is the human line

An eye for an eye
Inveterate despite
An eye for an eye
A one man war on crime

As I began to talk to god
I've even lost my mind
I only want to know one thing
What I've done, was it wrong or right

Why are the innocent dead?
Come on god, answer me
Why are the guilty alive?
Don't want to be deceived

They think they are above the law
They're trying to break my spine
Where is justice, where is punishment
Where is the human lineAn eye for an eye
Inveterate despite
An eye for an eye
A one man war on crime

An eye for an eye
Inveterate despite
An eye for an eye
A one man war on crime

A loving husband, devoted father
Till the day the mob opened the fire
Retaliation and vindictiveness
His only mission and ardent desire

Why are the innocent dead?
Come on god, answer me
Why are the guilty alive?
Don't want to be deceived

They think they are above the law
They're trying to break my spine
Where is justice, where is punishment
Where is the human line

An eye for an eye
An eye for an eye
