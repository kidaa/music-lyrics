Show them that you are the master of carnal desire
Confusion in their hateful eyes when they call you a liar
You cannot suppress the reflection of hate and rebirth
With all your strength of you will to escape from this earth

Suicidal justice
Collective instinct of death
Suicidal justice
A war of a man life to waste

This will be the first and the last act inside of your mind
It's useless to save yourself and don't try to hide
You got a message to kill from a higher place
The horrors of war switched off your brain
Take revenge!

You see them on hands and on knees when they crawl from their holes
You've never before seen a life fading so slow this is the time to go
Come on kiss the ground castration of cowards
And feeding the balls to the hounds
