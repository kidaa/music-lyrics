They took the oath of allegiance
Responsible and proud
Sold their soul for native love
In war to stand their ground

Don't bury the hatchet
Get on with your fight
Snipe down the enemies
Put them out of action
Don't look back
The promised words we never forget

Capture the flag
Capture the flag

Departure to conquest the Hamburger Hill
At the risk of our life
Embitters resistance, deadly traps
Rapid fire - Got no chance to dive

Don't bury the hatchet
Get on with your fight
Snipe down the enemies
Put them out of action
Don't look back
The promised words we never forget

Capture the flag
Capture the flag

Hollow bangs and cries of pain
That filled the air with blood
Fleeing in the minefield reign
Encircled by the flank attacks
A game like Russian roulette
Who will survive?
The mine barrier in front of us
Overpowered in running fightArmour-piercing bullets
Slaughtered one by one
Two find a way to hide
The tables are turned
By hopeless defeats
Got the power, got the might

Don't bury the hatchet
Get on with your fight
Snipe down the enemies
Put them out of action
Don't look back
The promised words we never forget

Capture the flag
Capture the flag

Now twenty years later
Sitting by the beer
Remembrance comes awake
Talk about friends
That never came back
Fallen by the war's disgrace

Don't bury the hatchet
Get on with your fight
Snipe down the enemies
Put them out of action
Don't look back
The promised words we never forget

Capture the flag
Capture the flag
Capture the flag
Capture the flag
