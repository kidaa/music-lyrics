They penetrate your skin
No more vitalities
Feeding your mind with fear
Smell of death is coming near
Squeezing out your blood
Life dragging through the mud
Dissection of your brain
Pumpin' up the lead

The suffocate my flame of life
Ceremonial desecration
Death is now so close to me
Liquidation

The sound of ripping fleash
No chance for your defense
Languishing hungry guns
Return the hellish sacred flame
Unyielding hateful wrath
No confidence in god
Another breed behind
They'll leave you where the others lieThe suffocate my flame of life
Ceremonial desecration
Death is now so close to me
Liquidation

Incapability
Escape your destiny
The rhythm of your heart
No more salvation to go on
Trapped in an icecold blaze
Your carcass starts to mate
Love finds a graceful end
The devil incarnates

The suffocate my flame of life
Ceremonial desecration
Death is now so close to me
Liquidation
