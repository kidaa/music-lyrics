Your life is not worth a days purchase
Malodorous flatulence wherever you go
Obese, sweaty and fattened
Like a swine in a prime of grease

Jabba the hut
Jabba the hut
Jabba the hut
Jabba the hut

You try to find a well shaped woman
But your body is a deterrence
This greedy boy escapes from reality
The girl takes the bull by the horns

Jabba the hut
Jabba the hut
Jabba the hut
Jabba the hutWobbling paleface, physical weakness
Smell of perspiration
Disgusting frame, over weight
Dreams of dissipation
Infamous deeds, you can't give up
But she is just a child
Tears of pain that drive you mad
Act of infanticide

Jabba the hut
Jabba the hut
Jabba the hut
Jabba the hut

Untouched victims decoyed with sweets
Reduced to silence or on the run
Too many lives passed  your hand
Your life will pass my hand with the gun

Jabba the hut
Jabba the hut
Jabba the hut
Jabba the hut
