Wars are raging
Under their command
Like a locust plague
Descends upon the land
Sanguinary breeding bad blood
Silent mortified
Man eating crowd
Warning of the end
None can hear the sound
On the day when nature strikes back

Into perdition

Destroyed and defiled
As on a proving ground
infected atomised
Polluted world
Fire spreads at lightning speed
Silent mortified
Man eating crowd
Warning of the end
None can hear the sound
On the day when nature strikes back

Into perditionExterminations
Dying nations
The multitude
They didn't realise
The day when nature takes revenge
Silent mortified
Man eating crowd
Warning of the end
None can hear the sound
On the day when nature strikes back

Into perdition

Wars were raging
Suffocation
Humanoid serpents
Caused by the wasteland
The day when nature takes revenge
Silent mortified
Man eating crowd
Warning of the end
None can hear the sound
On the day when nature strikes back

Into perdition
Into perdition
Into perdition
