My vacant art just imitate
A vacant nameless life
The knowledge of the victory
With vervent demonized

I'll bring up all my biggest guns
For those who never mind
Submission and duplicity
Don't want to lose my stripes

Warwhoops sounds from far beyond
In duration of my sense
My urges are revealed
The trade of war it makes me tense

Abilities to a man
Not firing a shot
Repentence of my inner soul
Can't help me to forget

Warlike ConspiracyNobody hears my inner voice
Imploring to his grace
I turn my servile face to god
But his face was turned away

My comrades diving hand in hand
The bullets struck 'em down
I followed them without a fear
The mating call of war

Warlike Conspiracy

My vacant art just imitate
A vacant nameless life
The knowledge of the victory
With vervent demonized

My comrades diving hand in hand
The bullets struck 'em down
I followed them without a fear
The mating call of war
