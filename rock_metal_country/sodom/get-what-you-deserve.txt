A sudden inspiration, a feeling so strong
Close about me to ride for a fall
My time is passing, my chance is getting low
Incredible hate my cure for tomorrow
I can't forget the day you tapped my vein
You said it's my problem and mine alone
You drew the curtain over me
I heard you laughing when you were gone

Ruled by insanity
Degenerate
I'm coming from behind
The only way

Deprivation of my courage to face life
Displaced by war neurosis
I'll struggle to my feet and fight
Devote my gun to its proper purpose
I can't forget the day you tapped my vein
You said it's my problem and mine alone
You drew the curtain over me
I heard you laughing when you were gone

Ruled by insanity
Degenerate
I'm coming from behind
The only wayUnder suspicion
You'll not escape
Be prepared for the worst
No matter where you hide
You'll come into my sight
You'll get what you deserve!

I'm waiting for the day we meet again
Enraged and full of anger
My rifled barrel shotgun
Say goodbye because I'm your saviour
I can't forget the day you tapped my vein
Now it's your problem and yours alone
I draw the curtain over you
You hear me laughing when I go

Ruled by insanity
Degenerate
I'm coming from behind
The only way

Under suspicion
You'll not escape
Be prepared for the worst
No matter where you hide
You'll come into my sight
You'll get what you deserve!
