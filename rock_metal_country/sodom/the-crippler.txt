Don't believe in rights
There is no such thing
Tearing up the garbage
With pain and suffering

Breaking rules is your desire
You got no sympathy
I'll put you in a wheelchair
That's your penalty

Nothing is secure
Nowhere is safe
Once you cross the line
I will break your spine

The crippler
Broadcast violence
The crippler
Prime time gladiator
The crippler
Bloodsport champion
The crippler
He will take you down

Shattering your kneecaps
The crowd begins to roar
They want more violence
This is a bloody war

Nothing is secure
Nowhere is safe
Once you cross the line
I will break your spineThe crippler
Broadcast violence
The crippler
Prime time gladiator
The crippler
Bloodsport champion
The crippler
He will take you down

Mutilated bodies
Crying out in vain
I will get the trophies
They will not regain

Once you cross the line
I will break your spine

The crippler
Broadcast violence
The crippler
Prime time gladiator
The crippler
Bloodsport champion
The crippler
He will take you down

Adrenaline is pumping
Better you than me
I'm gonna make you bleed
I like brutality

The crippler
Broadcast violence
The crippler
Prime time gladiator
The crippler
Bloodsport champion
The crippler
He will take you down
The crippler
Kicks to the genital
The crippler
Bigfoot in your face
The crippler
Pulling off your fingernails
The crippler
There is no better place
