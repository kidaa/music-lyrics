4:40
Tides of burning blood upon my face
Caressing my soul like a sweet embrace
Passionate, secret and profound
Gleaming eyes of uncharitable love

Shuffling out of mental claws to find a resort
Champagne of desire still oozing from my pores
I cannot resist the guileful brightness in your eyes
And your body with limbs that drags behind

Affectionated wantoness so give me your hand
Never weeping over victims never feeling bad
Inflaming the wish to control your breath
Sequestration from life, conveyance to death

I know that i am guilty but devoutness diarized
God-awful desecration, psychotic homicide
Discovered is my preference for lacerated skin
I hope that rotten bodies don't get buried so deepThat's what an unknown killer diarized

My spirit is casting the pure part of the one
Who brings fatal calamites still before the dawn
I never before felt a kind of compunction
My life is inspired by endless temptation

The day when i'm snatched away from this ground
And veins are exhausted by my bleeding heart
I consider to reap now the fruits of death
Retire with pride to write down my adventures

She followed me trustfully
But wondered where we'd go
I led her to the hidden place
That she had never seen before
My sweet heart
