Born in bad relationships
Growing up in gutters to learn the tricks
At daggers drawn with all the laws
Don't know what the rules are for

Unwanted youth
Unwanted youth
Rebellion to society
Searching for a war
Unwanted youth
Unwanted youth
Cowards of the revolution
Burn them to the bone

Just your breathing call up the enemies
To the battleground in dusty streets
If you will get the upper hand
To save your right that you demand

Crime on rise the gun is your toy
Starting to blast you believe in your way
Fighting with your own insanity
Between the devil and the deep sea
Who promised you it would be easy
Just follow me and you will see
The shattered dreams of an intact world
That seems so empty and absurdUnwanted youth
