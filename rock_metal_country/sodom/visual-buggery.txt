The malediction of a wicked breed
Total exhibition by political supreme
They look away and keep restrained cause money doesn't smell
Don't wanna hear the cries, forever damned in hell

Mind decapitation
TV Strangulation
Insane misdeeds without a trace
Nobody sees your smiling face

Visual Buggery

Barbarically electrified by terror and by pain
Consuming the irreverance, enjoyment for the brain
Depravation of a brutish world where death is still refined
Improving the occasion, corroded from inside

Mind decapitation
TV Strangulation
Insane misdeeds without a trace
Nobody sees your smiling face

Visual Buggery

You lock the doors, still breathing hot
With penchant for decease
Fingers crawling to the place
Where the serpent live
Incinerated feelings, unscrupulously dumped
Fingers crawling to the gun
To seal your morbid fate

Mind decapitation
TV Strangulation
Insane misdeeds without a trace
Nobody sees your smiling face

Visual Buggery
