Born to die in a game
Where there is no return
Try to find a pleasant means of death
All your life you have learnt
Tortured by the world till you
Draw your final breath

Terror, hate
Murder, rape

Through your life trying hard
To find out what it means
Those who know all have lost their mind
Through their eyes we can see
That nothing's to obscene
Empty shells, nothing there
Just bodies left behind

Terror, hate
Murder, rape

In this nightmare life time
You're better off dead
Pain and warfare, sex-crime
You're better off dead

Broken dreams devastated
By your will to live
Ruined by malignance and decay
We're betrayed until
There is nothing more to give
Praying for a final peace
To be there in our gravesTerror, hate
Murder, rape

In this nightmare life time
You're better off dead
Pain and warfare, sex-crime
You're better off dead

Terror, hate
Murder, rape

In this nightmare life time
You're better off dead
Pain and warfare, sex-crime
You're better off dead

In this nightmare life time
You're better off dead
Pain and warfare, sex-crime
You're better off dead

Better off dead
