As we heard the threatening sirens
Warned against the bombing raid
We cowered in a shelter
They left us to our fate

Bombenhagel - Bombenhagel
Bombenhagel - Bombenhagel

Stukas dived to bring is mortal dreed
Bombs fell down as rain
Explosions shook the ground
Debris is buried the dead againBombenhagel - Bombenhagel
Bombenhagel - Bombenhagel

Waiting for the painful decision
Senseless action of Germans on and on
Only suicides delivered is from suffering
What does the future have in store?

Bombenhagel - Bombenhagel
Bombenhagel - Bombenhagel
