I'm a powerkeg, ready to explode
Never admit defeat in the last resort
You better run to set you free
Because my bloodlust jerks my mind to kill

Don't search for help under attack
I bite like a dog perfidious like a rat
My eyes are blind, uncertain way to go
No force on earth can stop me now

Infected victims lumbering you way
You go right off the track, nobody escape
Pugnacious like a beast
Confessions in the dark
Hydrophobia

I want to hear your plaintive screams
That sound's so nice in my wildest dreams
I will never separate the sheep from the goats
Just want to see everyone in hell to roastInfected victims lumbering you way
You go right off the track, nobody escape
Pugnacious like a beast
Confessions in the dark
Hydrophobia

What is the use of your cry for help
Nobody hears the screams when you get scared
I can't explain how good it feels
But the day will come when I have to leave

Infected victims lumbering you way
You go right off the track, nobody escape
Pugnacious like a beast
Confessions in the dark
Hydrophobia
