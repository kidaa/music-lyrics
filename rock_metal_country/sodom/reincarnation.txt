Life on earth for you to know
In peace you live in peace you will go
Behind the scenes of salvation
Nobody knows lust and temptation

The mass begins the spirit appears
The man in black nothing he fears
A fatal disguise is what you call holy
Where is god? I want you to show me.

In the name of the father the son
The holy spirit the show has begun
Thy kingdom come thy will be done
Hallowed be thy name

Go down on your knees
And pray for peace
Join the club of total devotion
Religious faith and social failure
Once you've been trapped
Death is your saviourIn the name of the father the son
The holy spirit the show has begun
Thy kingdom come thy will be done
Hallowed be thy name
