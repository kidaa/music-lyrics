2:25
I'm quite prepared to use what everyone declines
I can't restrained myself
'cause devils in my head tonight
Dullness in my eyes turns all the sunshine into rain
And i deceive myself that i could never fall again

I'm a polytoximaniac
Dangerous and blind
A polytoximaniac
The truth begins to bite
A polytoximaniac
It's all that i can say
A polytoximaniac
From birth 'til my decayIt's not a strong man's act to fall in ecstasy
I like to have a bit of fun also with medicine
I blow my brain out of my head but i don't care
Searching for a secret flavour restless day by day

Sometimes i see reflections in the shade of god
One billion cockroaches are ready to attack
I can't believe my sense it's time to sat goodbye
The golden shot is due, erasure of my mind
