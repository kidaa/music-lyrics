Euthanasia or amnesty
Takes you off the ground
Embrace your hopes
And pray to them
When your smile turns upside down

Silent noise in sleepless nights
Freeze your mind and blood
Think about your morbid life
Is there any god?

No postponement
Death by the law
At zero hour
Stops your beating heart

Your days are numbered
Your fate is sealed
When the bell rings twelve o'clock
Waiting for the message
No governor's reprieve
These guys just doing their jobNo postponement
Death by the law
At zero hour
Stops your beating heart

You have to live on charity
Not die a natural death
That brings your life so close
Of your own wrongful act

Come on man
It's time to go
Deliverance not so far
TV covered
Millions wait
Tonight you are the star
