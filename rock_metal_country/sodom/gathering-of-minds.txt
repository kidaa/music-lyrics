4:16
You try to fly with broken wings
You take off high to avoid the death

Gathering of minds
Gathering of minds

Diseased thoughts, you get scared
Declining years, nuclearised

Gathering of minds
Gathering of mindsPut up a fierce resistance
To the slow decay in you
When you fall into the black hole
Your body and your soul
Vitalities are atrophied
Hopes that fade away
Worthless gets your life
Like driving up foliage

Gathering of minds
Gathering of minds

Gathering of minds
Gathering of minds

You go your way, you are not alone
And ending is your thorny road
