Martydom and servitude
Psychosis of a rabid sickless brood
Esoteric dreams a foreign man
Nocturnal flush, frenzied and rude
Buried in a nameless grave
Stand up again the world to save
The fear of darkness and of death
An ormament wedge
Sigh by prophecy
Bestial thought
Drive me in corupt
Hungry belussions
Inseparable huminilty

So man I came with lance and sword
Lead once more the legions of lord
Thrill with lissome lust of light
Come careing out of the night

Ascent to the virceous circle
In an era of fright and terror
A holy document
Hold in hands of unknown
Eradication, opulence
And parish noise
Mephisto the oppressor
Makes me so I like to feel
But I cant believe its trueProcelytism real

The day when I arrive the paradies
I flog my horse to the hills of violation
Return in my cenotaph to

Procelytism real
