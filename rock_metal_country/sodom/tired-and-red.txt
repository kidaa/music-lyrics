See the gun high velocity
Levelled to my heart
Magazine filled with hollow points
Bullets invented to slaughter
They activate the trigger
I get fired to the wall
Pain is pungent stops my life
Hear the last bell toll

Tired and red the ways I gonna die
Tired and red squirm, to plead to dry
Tired and red confirm by oath the death
Tired and red to my last breath

See the knife flash the sun
The knife that makes me run
Sharp and made of stainless steel
Not wholesome to feel
Stab me to the ground - Why?
Falling down to see the sky
My eyes are closed now day is night
Never wake to see the lightTired and red the ways I gonna die
Tired and red squirm, to plead to dry
Tired and red confirm by oath the death
Tired and red to my last breath

See the chair one thousand volts
Invite to sit down
With closed eyes and fettered limbs
Contacts decorate an iron crown
Overseer turns on the switch
Small sparks squirt out my head
High amperage my body shook
In the claws of death

Tired and red the ways I gonna die
Tired and red squirm, to plead to dry
Tired and red confirm by oath the death
Tired and red to my last breath
