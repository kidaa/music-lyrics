Stunted growth of emotions
Incurable confused
Gazing at her reflections
Mentally abused

You kill the one you love
At the first opportunity
Wistful resolution
Carnal property

The wolf and the lamb

Marauding in the night
Unsuspecting bags never pray
The truth a broken spine
And life will never changeThe wolf and the lamb

Drifting in sea of blood
Shivered to the bone
Accusing words don't reach my ear
Request for death is done

The wolf and the lamb
