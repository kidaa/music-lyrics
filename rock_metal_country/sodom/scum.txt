Do you see
All the dreg of humanity
Rank and file
That looks at me
Creeping out of gloomy holes
Like dirty lousy rats
Soiling up this peaceful place
With all their rotten shit

Scum
Scum

Every inch
Misantrophists
Holding in contempt
The dignity of man
Coloured whipping boys
Victimised by their foolish hate
Defenceless like a toy
When they go to their fateScum

Marching off
With the flags of lies
Get their ashes hauled
In a dreadful fight
Unscrupulous rapes
Beyond the grave
Embodies ghastly sights
Signed by cowardice

Scum
Scum
Scum
