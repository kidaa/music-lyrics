I wanna be a rock'n roll star
I wanna be the one who plays an ace guitar
In every town i want to get my drinks for free
And thousand girls will cry when i have to leave

Hey, hey, hey rock'n roll star

I wanna be the one with preference to fuck
A heavy metal gentleman rising out of ruck
I am so nimble-fingered, rubbing strings so fast
Also between your maiden girlfriends legs

I'll surely never get reduced to penury
Like a poor wretch who's rock'n rolling in money
My childhood dreams, now reality
Until another bastard gets bigger than me
