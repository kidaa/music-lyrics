3:49
On your knees
Praying at the burial ground
Mistrustful eyes of intimacy
Pointing the way to the other side
You hear the screams of a million souls
Unguarded and left to their own resources
Where time turned into a frozen block
And even the water of life

You will die!

Wander in the valleyAs you reach for the sky
With hollow shells of faded dreams
Time bomb ticking has just begun
To make reprisals on what i have done
Like grains of sand that fall from my hand
The fate i feel is drawing near
Shackles in my brain losing so fast
Waiting to unfold

Mummified bodies
Elixir of life wasting away
Perpetual glares of those who are delivered
Entomber in the derbis of honour and blood
A sinful voice that prophesied
Death becomes easy just close your eyes
Incantation of freedom so urgent and true
Your wish is my command
