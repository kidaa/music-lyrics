War!
Nuclear warheads are ready to fight
Total destruction the only might
We are all suicide, without brain
People are running and dying in pain

Burst command til war!

The overkill is near
Nobody feel the heavy fear
Thousand megatons dynamite
Wait to kill one life

Burst command til war!

We live our life in grieved desire
Our hopeless is getting higher
You cry for freedom, but nobody hear you
The end of the world is trueBurst command til war!

War, war, war

Burst command til war
Burst command til war

War!
