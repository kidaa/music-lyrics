2:29
A fateful day when you lost your mind
Pulsing blood but tour body won't die
They hold up the mirror to your face
New definitions to the human race
Preaching charity and mind over matter
Profit by your misadventure
Are you passed away when your lungs are breathing
Time to go when your heart is still beating

Braindead
Braindead
Braindead

Conditioned by vivisection
Cannibalised, no resurrection
Butchers covered by snow-white coats
To save your life and morbid thoughts
Acceptance by forerunners of hell
They know how to do and they do it well
To suppress the lies and all the facts
The truth about your final breath
