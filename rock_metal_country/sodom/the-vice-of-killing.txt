Bad menace
Bloody taste
Hold him in a vicelike grip
Disordered life
A rabid dog
Blinded by deceit

Abhorrence of the paltry and human remains
Moronic sentiments are born to be expectorated
Immacualted beauties just a kind of blasphemy
And everything that moves is all the energy for him

The vice of killing
His soul was crippled in the past
The vice of killing
No therapy will never last

Unsolicited
Change of heart
Inspired by the gloomy legends
Hemorrhage
Pouring out
Just an absurd gadget
Concentrated
Hungry thoughts
Malevolence incurably fused
Terrified
'Cause the truth
Infested with immoral abuse

Abhorrence of the paltry and human remains
Moronic sentiments are born to be expectorated
Immacualted beauties just a kind of blasphemy
And everything that moves is all the energy for himThe vice of killing
His soul was crippled in the past
The vice of killing
No therapy will never last

Dreadful pain
Passed away
Just watching for another game
Segregated from
Normality
Psychotic morbid brain
Mischievous greeds
Strange desire
Craving for the victim's wine
Feasting on
Their despair
Unheard screams adorn his evil shrine

Abhorrence of the paltry and human remains
Moronic sentiments are born to be expectorated
Immacualted beauties just a kind of blasphemy
And everything that moves is all the energy for him

The vice of killing
His soul was crippled in the past
The vice of killing
No therapy will never last
