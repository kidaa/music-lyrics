5:09
I feel a rifle bullet bore into my heart
A sudden impact shock that stops my pulsing blood
I see the glory shining light of paradise
And insincerities, forever left behind

'til death do us unite

I see the mournful flowers fading on my grave
And all my friends are crying to god my soul to save
Hateful faces spitting on my last resting place
And all my foes are praying to hell my mind to take

I hear the echos of your prayers and your lies
Your falseness and your greed mendacious sorry sights
My hopes are buried by my broken dignity
Still god will bless and curse us all
To all eternity
