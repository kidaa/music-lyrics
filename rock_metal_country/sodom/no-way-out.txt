Your touch is like a snakebite kiss
Your love is like a boon
A leader in my haggard dreams
Emotions of a fool

No way out

I'm spoiling you with my prurience
My sadness disappears
The way you told me beside stories
Still pleasant to my earsA willing and addictive girl
Wide open legs so tempting
The gleeming of her greedy eyes
Seduced me to come back

Your touch was like a snakebite kiss
Your love was like a boon
The leader in my haggard dreams
He passes me the gun
