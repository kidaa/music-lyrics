Armed and ready I sit in a room
Vanishing power
A sting in my arm
Blood pours on the floor
Final hour
The one that got me out of the grave
Always there
Don't know what he's aiming at
Do not dare

Never regain...
Tapping the vein

Darkness all around me
I can't see
A door that's never really open
Not for me
The shock of recognition now
I will die
Mind distortion weird thoughts
Tell me why...I'm going insane...
Tapping the vein

Still got my gun my only friend
Through it all
Can't pull the trigger no final shot
Can't you hear my call?
Venomous poison lethal liquid
Pumping through my veins
Physical destruction
Psychic interruption
Dying brain

Never regain...
Tapping the vein
