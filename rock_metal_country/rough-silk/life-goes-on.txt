you got fallen reasons in one blink
you got people always tryin' to think
you got sisters in a traffic jam
my body's like a tram
you got trouble melted by the heat
liberty on dead end street
you got an iron lion sighin' when you're cryin'
and life goes on
on and on - tomorrow I'll be gone
but life goes on
so you were born where the black cats stray
back on your feet - that's the price you got to pay
for daylight dreams in the midnight hour
intelligence is power!
to find a rose way down below
scared to death where egos grow
whenever a wish cuts like a knife
then life goes on
on and on - tomorrow I'll be gone
but life goes on
in this world of my reaction
I can't find a reason why
in this world of disattraction
may the force be with your lie forever
me, myself and I belong together
and life goes on
on and on - tomorrow I'll be gone
but life goes on
