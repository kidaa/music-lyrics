this is the end of love - is this the end?
this is the end!
a little boy stands by the waterfall
- he wants it all
he's tremblin' in his rage
and life soon turns the page
the little boy's now growing older fast
and even though his aims don't last
he's on the run - another one
like all the rest
what are we fightin' for
why do we still want more?
another lie - another battlecry
as time goes by
this is the end of love
this is the end of hope
this is the end and this is the time
and maybe it's just a simple rhyme
this is the end of life
and this is the end of the fight
there's so much we never should understand
and this is the end
the little boy's now grey to pass away
waitin' for his judgement day
- come what may
when dreams decay
and here I stand and watch the waters flow
and still I don't know
where do we go from here?
