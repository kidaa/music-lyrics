Something's evil - in my mind
satisfaction - left behind
words unspoken - driven blind
I've been searching' - you'll never find
darkness rising - blackened sun
painted traces - on the run
loosers - winners - long time done
you're the trigger - I#m the gun!!!
so time will rise and time will fade
a fool once wise beyond the blade
if you don't get payed - you don't get layed!!!
a skeleton once free
tomorrow to see
the lost destiny
from here to eternity
me - a reason to be
burning the key
from here to eternity
silent voices - calling you
violent voices - sad but true
sounds of madness - hurt in vain
praise your sadness - in the falling rain
so time will rise and time fill fade....
a skeleton once free....
don't hear - don't see
don't move - don't be
don't care - don't go
don't try don't know
don't sleep - don't cry
don't leave - don't buy
don't fear yourself
the clock strikes twelve!!!!
a skeleton once free....
from here to eternity
