Soldierboy
was born in vain;
one life insane;
went down the drain
why don't you think?
why don't you ask?
why don't you live
or just say: No?
soldierboy
dead - hypnotized
deaf - paralyzed
forgotten son
war ain't no fun,
grace on the run,
though shalt be done:
a second sun!!!
where the red waters flow
where the dead slaughters go
money's fat daughters know
where the red waters flow
soldierboy
too young to die
too old to cry
too blind to sigh
where do we go?
when will we know?
who told you so?
whose horn will blow?
legions of madness....
where the red waters flow
where the red waters flow....
