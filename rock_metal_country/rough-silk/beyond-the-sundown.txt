Beyond the sundown-you're just a beast without a name
Beyond the sundown-life is more than just a game
Beyond the sundown-mirrors rise and shadows fall
Beyond the sundown-darkness rises after all
Beyond the sundown-You need light and light needs pain
Beyond the sundown-Silence breaks and scars remain
Beyond the sundown-it's your memory and the truth
Beyond the sundown-there ain't nothing left to lose
I walk around in circles-I walk alone and blue
I talk to strange illusions-in need of something true
I've seen a billion faces-I've seen the prince of lies
I've seen a million places branded by the lord of flies
So I won't take your orders-so I won't take your smile
I'd sail across the oceans-I'd walk the endless mile
So all your secret sinners-thou shalt not live in fear!
I won't believe in answers-while somethings always near

Beyond the sundown-I'd be you and you'd be me
Beyond the sundown-every word was like a key
Beyond the sundown-would you lie to me in vain?
Beyond the sundown-just like here and now-insane?
Beyond the sundown
Beyond the sundown-I wouldn't be the one to blame
Beyond the sundown-I wouldn't be your road to fame
Beyond the sundown-you'd be just a waste of time
Beyond the sundown-to break a promise would be a crime
And if I'd say goodbye today
Would there be another way
Would you cry just like a clown
way beyond the last sundown?
And if I'd leave without a word
-Ain't that just a little absurd?-
Would you give the king back his crown
And wait for me beyond sundown?
