this one's dedicated
to those who never give
to those who always take and break
on tears and pain they live
this one's dedicated
to those who never care
to whose who who always preach and lie
and leave you cold and bare
this one's dedicated
to those who make you cry
to those who take your dreams away
and always crucify

born in the age of fireworks
it's a case of do or die
pain causes a hundred reasons
so watch them reasons fly
- walls of never
like a sream of hate in a silent movie
honesty seems out of date
triumph - testament - eliza
raise your glass for those who wait
cause this one's dedicated
to those who still believe
to those who sing and draw and write
who try, protect and weave
- walls of never...
