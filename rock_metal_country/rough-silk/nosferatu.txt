Nosferatu - all the tears and all the pain
Nosferatu - all the years - their graves remain
Nosferatu - would you share a little drink with me
Nosferatu - until the sunlight sets you free
Nosferatu - times have changed and always will
Nosferatu - now you're way too old to kill
Nosferatu - you steel your blood from hospitals
Nosferatu - you're afraid of aids and lonely cells
nights of blood and nights of darkness
nights of passion - nights of hate
nights of rumours . nights of silence
nights of doubt came much too late
nights now fill your heart with sorrow
you can't sleep without your daily wine
so now you're waiting for tomorrow
and the morning sun to shine
Nosferatu - on that hill - alone and grey
Nosferatu - You see the children and not prey
Nosferatu - when the light slowly takes your hand
Nosferatu - burns to ashes in the end
