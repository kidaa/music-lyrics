Where strangers meet and lovers lie
where loosers win and winners cry
down on senseless boulevard
where they run so fast but they won't get far
when the lights go out and the neon signs
promise everything you want between the lines
there's a reason why and a place to hide
welcome to the other side
I don't believe in any word you say
how could it be forever - when dreams decay
you never know who your friends are
you never know who your friends are
you never know who your friends are
....'til you need 'em
now the night after judgement day
four horsemen ride down lost highway
if rains on senseless boulevard
Saint Valentine sleeps in astolen car
the broken promise finds a friend called wine
words of trust are the first in line
Judge says: Son, shoulda know your bride
welcome to the other side
I don' believe....
