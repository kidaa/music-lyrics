I don't know where to go - I don't know what to say.
I don't know why to leave and what I'm gonna see today.
I don't know where you are - I don't know what you've found
But all I know for sure, my dear, is that the truth is gonna burn you down !
Gimme the nightlights !
Gimme the rain !
Gimme the shadows of a faith gone down the drain !
Gimme the reasons !
Gimme a round !
And all I know for sure, my dear, is that the truth is gonna burn you down !
I don't know why we fight - I don't know why we kill.
I don't know who's to blame and why we cheat and and always will.
I don't know who I am and why I was your clown
But all I know for sure, my dear, is that the truth is gonna burn you down.
Gimme the nightlights........
Didn't they tell you 'bout the truth ?
It's harder than the lie.
And after all these one night stands
you just kiss your tears goodbye.
Silent memories hurt my brain
- but your brain is not the thing
- it's the below-the-kidneys-territory
where the bells of fire ring.
So maybe in another world
or in another life
- some other place - some other time
some other one wheel drive.
What you give is what you get
- but what if you only take ?
The wrong way out but the right way in
and another heart to break.
The truth you cannot fake !
Gimme the nightlight...........
