....the lonely road to mystery bay Well, the night was dark and the moon was pale
the saints were searching for the holy grail
I drove real slow in the ultrafast way
and the lonely road to mystery bay
well, it's the goddamned truth - no, it ain't no tale
when the bad stay hungry - then the good ones fail
i've seen too much - that's the price you pay
on the lonely road to mystery bay
suddenly the radio screamed
it was still switched off but, man, it seemed
like a distant kiss of yesterday
on the lonely road to mystery bay
and when the night is over
and they've swallowed your pride
and there ain't no place to hide:
recall - recall - recall - recall

...on the loney road to mystery bay
...on the loney road to mystery bay
recall - recall - recall - the fall - recall the fall
well, the radio ghost said: it's time to go
to the reasons why the grace below
it's not the aim - it's just the way
on the loney road to mystery bay
well, what could I say - what could i do?
lightning flashed and so did you
as i woke up and the light of the day
told me welcome home at mystery bay
and when the night is over
and they've swallowed your pride
and there ain't no place to hide:
recall - recall - recall - recall
