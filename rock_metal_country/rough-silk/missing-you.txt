there's a sign saying phones in rooms
there's a blind man bangin' the drums of doom
there's a barking dog on the telephone line
there's a beggar on the street sayin' I'm doin' fine
there's a cry - there's a cry in the night
another love has died
there's a dream dyin' on second floor
while a businessman waits at the doors
for somemercyfulbody to bring the key
and break the chains of misery
there's a cry... and I'm missing you
and the night comes down and the lights go out
in my bedroom lies a drunken astronaut
and I stare at your picture and wonder why
we had to say goodbye
and I cry
I'm missing you...
