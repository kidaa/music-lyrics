The science of cash
allience of thrash
the razor, the blood and the greed
a fool one I've been
a tool without sin,
the chaser, the mud and the seed
now it's to late
say Hello to your fade
but then kiss your asses goodbye
it won't take too long
and it's only a song
but tomorrow your sorrow won't die
miserey - you'll see - loves company
reality - won't set you free
a system of hate
a price no one payed
the traitors, the lawyers, the lies!
the fire - the flame
the night hides my shame
alone in the - sacrifice
when life and pain unite
words collide
when life and pain unite
my concience - the truth
my spirit you used
for pleasure - for fortune and fame
it's over and out
now fiction rules proud
the inside - me you cannot blame!
when life and pain unite
words collide
when life and pain unite
