you gotta call me when it's dark there
on the wrong side of the moon
and when the toys of love will turn
into evil hounds of doom
when silence is holy
in the cages of light
you will remember
the shadows of the fight
I will be there - after the war
I will be there - forevermore
and I will be there - with the wind and the rain
I will be there - somehow - someway - somewhere
burning in season
of pain and despair
over the mountains where no one seems to care
a new ray of hope will come and light up the night
as long as you need me I will be by your side
I will be there - after the war
I will be there - forevermore
and I will be there - with the wind and the rain
I will be there - somehow - someway - somewhere
someday we'll try
and heaven can wait
reach for the sky - and get away - get away
so I will be there - after the war
I will be there - forevermore
and I will be there - with the wind and the rain
I will be there - somehow - someway - somewhere
