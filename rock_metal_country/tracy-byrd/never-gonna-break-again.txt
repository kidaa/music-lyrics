Seeing you sitting alone
Stranded with your heart broke down
Reminds me of everything
Wrong with the world right now
Seems nobody takes pride
In anything they do or say
They give their word
But it ain't worth very much these days
Maybe Im old school, behind the times
But I still believe if a man does something
He ought to do it right, so

When I make love
It's made to last
And when I build trust
It's built to stand fast
Everything I start
I see it to the end
If you let me fix your heart
It's never gonna break again

Whoever had your heart before
Left it in pretty bad shape
If he gave it the time
And the care it needs
Well, he did it too late
It's gonna take a little work
But it's nothing that I can't do
Piece by piece Ill put it together
Back better than new
And it comes with my
Lifetime guarantee
Just put your heart in my good hands
And, girl, you'll see

When I make love
It's made to last
And when I build trust
It's built to stand fast
Everything I start
I see it to the end
If you let me fix your heart
It's never gonna break againOh, everything I start
I see it to the end
If you let me fix your heart
It's never gonna break again


If you let me fix your heart
It's never gonna break again
