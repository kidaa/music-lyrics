I can't say looking back right now just where our love went wrong
But the hard cold fact is she's not here she's gone
Made me a promise she'd be true till the rivers all ran dry
The rivers still runnin' but she's long said goodbye

That's why I'm down on the bottom
Where the Moccasin's King and the big tall cypress grow
Seems the only place that a country boy can find some peace of mind
And get back up, is on the bottom

Got friends in the world outside but none quite like ol' Cajun Joe
He lives down a slough where the river used to flow
Worked real hard most of his life till the pushin' came to shove
Gave it all he had but he just couldn't rise above

That's why he's down at the bottom
Where the alligator swims and the old grey moss hangs low
Seems the only place that a country boy can find some piece of mind
And get back up, is on the bottom

I can get back up here on the bottom
On the Natchez river bottom
