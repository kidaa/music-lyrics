I could search from now till the end of time
And never find another you
I'm so glad because I know you're mine
Someone to give my love to

Now I believe my love that you're one of a kind
For there's no one else like you
You're the light of my life so let it shine
Someone to give my love to

Chorus
I found happiness is loving you
And I'll do my best to make your dreams come true

I will follow you to the end of the earth For my place will be with you I have taken you for better or worse Someone to give my love to

Repeat Chorus

Days of man and wife time are precious few
I will spend them all with you
Then beyond forever I'll wait for you
Someone to give my love to
