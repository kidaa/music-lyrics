Another fourteen hour day, crisis solved deadline made
I came home like always, tired and beat
Threw dinner in the microwave
Beside it on the counter lay
A letter from my wife addressed to me
It said I know you're workin' hard that's easy to see
Tryin' to provide the best for the kids and me
We've had less to work with 
But we've always worked it out
A house and yard, clothes and cars ain't all it's all about 

It's about time that you're not givin'
Life that you're not livin'
Losin' your focus, not knowin' you don't notice
That our dreams are slowly fading
Are you hearin' what I'm sayin'
Don't you think we're worth the sacrifice
Cause if we are, you need to realize
It's about time 

When you were on a business trip, to bad you had to miss
Your spittin' image hit the winning run
You know he adores you, he was lookin' for you
Remember that you promised him you'd come
Did you know your little girl lost her front tooth today
She put it underneath her pillow
And tried to stay awake
I laid down beside her, didn't want to sleep alone
This is not about ";not loving"; can't you see what's goin' on 

It's about time that you're not givin'
Life that you're not livin'
Losin' your focus, not knowin' you don't notice
That our dreams are slowly fading
Are you hearin' what I'm sayin'
Don't you think we're worth the sacrifice
Cause if we are, you need to realize
It's about time 

I walked up the stairs to find three angels sound asleep
One by one I tucked 'em in and kissed 'em on the cheek
I stood there and thought about how selfish I had been 
And how one day without 'em
Would be more than I could stand
And now I understand 

It's about time I should be givin'
Life I should be livin'
Keepin' my focus and let em know I notice
That the thing that's most important
Is sharing in each moment
Heaven knows they're worth the sacrifice
It's not too late now, that I realize
It's about time 

It's not too late now, that I realize
It's about time
