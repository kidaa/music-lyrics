When we heard that train a comin'
Should've seen old Billy Walker run
I laughed and yelled hey Billy
You're gonna miss all the fun

Between me and that cold water
I bet there was fifty feet of air
When I jumped that bridge was shakin'
But me I wasn't scared
Call me crazy but when the choice was mine
I'd pick crazy every time

chorus
Mama thought she taught me
Better safe than sorry but I guess Ive always 
Been the other kind
I disregard all reason don't look for hidden meaning
And I don't really care if it don't rhyme
Born with a rebel state of mind
I'll pick crazy every timebridge
Between drag racin' cane raisin' girl chasin'
Bootleggin' I like my livin' on edge
Ask me what Id change and Ill say there's one thing
To this day I still regret

She was the best thing I had goin'
That's what Billy Walker said
Nobody else will treat me better 
Love me like she did
All I had to do was walk that line
But Ill pick crazy every time

repeat chorus
