At the time, it seemed like the right thing
Breakin up and goin separate ways
But now I find, I cant keep from wishin
I was back with you in yesterday
Laughin and lovin wild and free
No one else but you and me

I wanna feel that way again
I wanna touch you like I did back then
I wanna hold you in my arms, let a candle burn till dawn
Feel your breath upon my skin
It was the best Ive ever been
I cant believe we let it end
I wanna feel that way again

Holdin hands, walkin down a dirt road
In the dark and knowin everything was right
We would dance, and talk about tomorrow
Our lips would touch and set the night on fire
Back then there was nothin we couldnt do
Believin that dreams come true

I wanna feel that way again
I wanna touch you like I did back then
I wanna hold you in my arms, let a candle burn till dawn
Feel your breath upon my skin
It was the best Ive ever been
I cant believe we let it end
I wanna feel that way again

It was the best Ive ever been
I cant believe we let it end
I wanna feel that way again
