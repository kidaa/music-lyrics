Jeffrey Steele/Al Anderson 

When it rains it pours
And man it's really comin' down 

Feels like the weight of the whole world
Knocked me to the ground 

And that's when she takes me in
And gives me shelter from the storm
Where I'm safe and warm
Lost in her arms
Nothin's wrong anymore 

Ain't it just like a woman to know when
A man needs to be loved 

Life's a race I'll never win
It's enough to drive me crazy
And when the walls start closing in
It never fails to amaze me How one little touch
Or a twinkle in her eye
Brings me to life 
Yeah, she knows the way
To make it alright 

Ain't it just like a woman to know when
A man needs to be loved 

That's when she takes me in
And gives me shelter from the storm
Where I'm safe and warm
Lost in her arms
Nothin's wrong anymore 

Ain't it just like a woman to know when
A man needs to be loved 

Ain't it just like a woman to know when
A man needs to be loved
