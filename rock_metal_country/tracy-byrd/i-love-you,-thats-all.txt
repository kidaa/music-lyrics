I don't need to go on pretending
I don't need the key to your door
Why would I leave goodbye open-ended
That's not what goodbye is for

Now I don't have one thing against you
You're breakin' my heart not the law
The angel I made you into had to fall
I'll miss you I love you that's all

Sometimes I get sentimental
But what would I say if I called
I feel like I'm caught in the middle
Somewhere between flyin' and takin' a fallNow I don't have one thing against you
You're breakin' my heart not the law
The angel I made you into had to fall
I'll miss you I love you that's all

Now I don't have one thing against you
You're breakin' my heart not the law
The angel I made you into had to fall
It's over I love you that's all
I'll miss you I love you that's all
