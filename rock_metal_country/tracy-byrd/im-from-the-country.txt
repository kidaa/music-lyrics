Marty Brown/Richard Young/Stan Webb 

Way back up in the country, back in the hills
Down in the hollows where the folks are real
Livin with the crazzies and the old wildcats
Sawed off shotguns and coonskin caps
Thats where Im from and Im proud to say
Im from the country and I like it that way

Everybody knows everybody, everybody calls you friend
You dont need an invitation, kick off your shoes come on in
Yeah, we know how to work and we know how to play
Were from the country and we like it that way

All day long we work in the fields
Then bring it on home to a home cooked meal
We love ya like Sunday, treat ya like Saturday night
And when the bed gets full we can sleep in the hay hey
Were from the country and we like it that way

Everybody knows everybody, everybody calls you friend
You dont need an invitation, kick off your shoes come on in
Yeah, we know how to work and we know how to play
Were from the country and we like it that way

Everybody knows everybody, everybody calls you friend
You dont need an invitation, kick off your shoes come on in
Yeah, we know how to work and we know how to play
Were from the country
Were from the country
Were from the country and we like it that way
