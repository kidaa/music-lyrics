Don't be afraid darling you can tell me
What it takes to make your world turn
If you're willing there's time
And if you're so inclined
Just give me a sign

I wanna take love lessons baby from you
Whatever it is you want I want to please you
I wanna take love lessons baby real slow
Teach me everything I need to knowTake my hand let's talk about us
Whisper soft what it is you're thinking of
I wanna hold you tight
Won't you show me how tonight
Let's turn down the lights

I wanna take love lessons baby from you
Whatever it is you want I want to please you
I wanna take love lessons baby real slow
Teach me everything I need to know
Teach me everything I need to know
