Shawn Camp/Taylor Dunn 

Whenever I go out
Anywhere in town
I look for a crowd
Where you're not hangin' 'round
Say that I won't give
Your memory any room
But every time I do 

Just when I think I can
Take another's hand
Get on with my life
Won't look back again
Promise I won't keep
Comparin' them to you
But every time I do 

Every time I do, I wish I didn't 
Try to tell myself, but I just don't listen
It's what he can't have back he never learns his lesson
I say I'll forget her
Oh, but I know better
Don't I know by now we don't belong together
Shouldn't get the blues when I think of you
But every time I do When I'm drivin' home
You'd think that I'd have learned
Keep both hands on the wheel
Don't even make that turn
Swear that I won't go
Down Maple Avenue
But every time I do 

Every time I do, I wish I didn't 
Try to tell myself, but I just don't listen
It's a fool who just goes on missin'
What he can't have back he never learns his lesson
I say I'll forget her
Oh, but I know better
Don't I know by now we don't belong together
Shouldn't get the blues when I think of you
But every time I do 

No, I Shouldn't get the blues when I think of you
But every time I do
