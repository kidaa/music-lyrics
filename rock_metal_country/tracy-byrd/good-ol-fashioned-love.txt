Mark Nesler/Tony Martin 

The kind of love that I've been lookin' for
I'm not sure they make it anymore
It's easy to fall for a pretty smile
It works real good for a while
'Til the new wears off
And it starts to fall apart

I want a well-made out-of-style
Good ol' fashioned love
The kind that stays together
When the going gets too tough
I don't want a new love
They just don't last long enough
I want a well-made out-of-style
Good ol' fashioned loveI know it's a rare thing now to find
But I just don't want any other kind
A love like that's worth the sacrifice
If the heart's been broken
I can fix it up
All I need is someone like me

Who wants a well-made out-of-style
Good ol' fashioned love
The kind that stays together
When the going gets too tough
I don't want a new love
They just don't last long enough
I want a well-made out-of-style
Good ol' fashioned love
I want a well-made out-of-style
Good ol' fashioned love
