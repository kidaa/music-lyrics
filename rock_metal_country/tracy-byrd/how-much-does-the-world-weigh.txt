I sat up thinking late last night
Do they have a way to count the stars
Theres a lot of scientific minds
Who claim to know what all the answers are
Well if thats the case
How much does the world weigh
Somebodys probably worked it out
You could look up what the experts say
But all you gotta do is look around
Youd be surprised who knows

Ask that woman trying to make the rent
Pay the bills and feed the kids
Six months ago their daddy walked away
Ask that man whose family stayed around
cause he finally put that bottle down
But now he fights that battle everyday
Hey, how much does the world weigh

Human spirit is a funny thing
How far it bends before it breaks
To keep the world from caving in
How much strength does it take
Dont ask meAsk that couple in the waiting room
The doctors say its still too soon
Its their little girl and all they can do is pray
Ask that little boy whose gotta choose
Mom or dad, either way hell lose
Theyre breaking up and he thinks hes to blame
Hey, how much does the world weigh

Ask that man hanging on the cross
His last breath will save the lost
The answers in the tears on his face
How much does the world weigh
How much does the world weigh
