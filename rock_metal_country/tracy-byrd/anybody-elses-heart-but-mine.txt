Wayland Holyfield/Kent Robbins
She's history
Don't ruin good beer with tears
Get up off those knees
She ain't coming back, Jack
And if you think she will
You're on the wrong track
Hearts get broken every day
And life goes on without her here
It would be so clear if only it was

Anybody else's heart but mine
I'd say hey that's the breaks
It'll mend in time
I'd know just what to do
If it was anybody else's blues
If it was anybody else's heart but mine

Hey what's goin' on
It's a little bit different
When it's my love that's gone
Now old platitudes
Like find somebody else
Now they just won't do
I was so wise when giving free advice
To every body else
But now hearing it myself I wish that it wasAnybody else's heart but mine
I'd say hey that's the breaks
It'll mend in time
I'd know just what to do
If it was anybody else's blues
If it was anybody else's heart but mine

Anybody else's heart but mine
I'd say hey that's the breaks
It'll mend in time
I'd know just what to do
If it was anybody else's blues
If it was anybody else's heart but mine
