I'm face to face with an angel
How'd you get those eyes so blue
You're a vision in white and I've been waitin' all night
Just to have one dance with you
Now all my dreams are comin' true

Chorus
I'm holdin' heaven in my arms tonight
Everything about you is so perfectly right
I've never been there but I think I might
Be holdin' heaven in my arms tonight

I'm not sure where you came from But I thank my lucky stars above That I got the chance to have a dance But one dance just ain't enough I think I'm fallin' in love

Repeat Chorus 2x

I'm holdin' heaven in my arms tonight
