Girl I swear you dang near took my breath
The way you sashayed in this bar all by yourself
You say you've heard about me
And all my ramblin' ways
If I could have a gal like you
I'd change today

I've been called an old tomcat
Been in and out of this and that
I hugged 'em, I kissed 'em, I loved 'em
And I left 'em behind
But I'd do right by you
If you was mine
I'd spend all my time
Walkin' the lineAin't no doubt you've done stoled my heart
I can almost see us walkin' arm in arm
This country boy never dreamed
He'd live to see the day
He'd be willin' to throw
His little black book away

Yeah I've been called an old tomcat
Been in and out of this and that
I hugged 'em, I kissed 'em, I loved 'em
And I left 'em behind
Lord, but I'd do right by you
If you was mine
I'd spend all my time
Walkin' the line

Yeah I've been called an old tomcat
Been in and out of this and that
I hugged 'em, I kissed 'em, I loved 'em
And I left 'em behind My my
Oh but I'd do right by you
If you was mine
I'd spend all my time
Walkin' the line
Yes I would
I'd spend all my time
Walkin' the line
