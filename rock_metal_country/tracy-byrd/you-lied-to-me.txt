Bill Anderson
You looked at me as only you can look at me
You touched my cheek and told me not to cry
But you said you'd found somebody you loved more than me
And you told me I'd forget you by and by

But you lied to me, yes you lied to me
You said time would close the wound that bled inside of me
But every breath I take brings back your memory
You said I'd forget you, but you lied to me

Monday, I said Tuesday you'd be off my mind
Then I gave myself 'til Wednesday then on down the line
Funny how September turns to June so fast
And you told me this pain was not the kind to last

But you lied to me, yes you lied to me
You said time would close the wound that bled inside of me
But every breath I take brings back your memory
You said I'd forget you, but you lied to me

Oh you said I'd forget you, but you lied to me
