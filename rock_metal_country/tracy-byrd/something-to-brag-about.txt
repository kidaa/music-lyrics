Al Anderson / Jeffrey Steele 

I need something to brag about
A new car, a big two story house
I can't win her love without something to brag about 

Well goodness gracious, what's that I see
Over in the corner making eyes at me
I can't stop shaking, she's so fine
But how am  I ever going to make her mine all mine, oh 

I need something to brag about
A new car, a big two story house
I can't win her love without something to brag about
I want to be all she's looking for
It's going to take all I've got and more
I'll be going home alone without something to brag about 

Lord have mercy, here she comes
But it's too late now, I can't turn and run
Well my first impression just might be my last
Well I better hurry up and think of something fast, oh 

I need something to brag about
A new car, a big two story house
I can't win her love without something to brag about
I want to be all she's looking for
It's going to take all I've got and more
I'll be going home alone without something to brag about 

I need something to brag about
