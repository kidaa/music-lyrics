Bill Kenner/L. Russell Brown
Oh wild Billy told me even I would have a chance
If I took a trip down the Georgia highway and asked some girl to dance
Billy said he'd been there - had the best time of his life
He went to stay for the weekend and he came back with a wife

It's 4 to 1 in Atlanta, I'm gonna get lucky tonight
The girls are in my favor and if I play my cards just right
I might find an angel whose fire I can light
It's 4 to 1 in Atlanta and I'm on my way tonight

I can't wait to get there I know she's waiting for me
With eyes as blue as Texas skies like I ain't never seen
And as I think about it my heart starts to pound
I throw this thing into lower gear and crush that hammer down

It's 4 to 1 in Atlanta, I'm gonna get lucky tonight
The girls are in my favor and if I play my cards just right
I might find an angel whose fire I can light
It's 4 to 1 in Atlanta and I'm on my way tonight

Here comes a confrontation with the highway patrol
I hope beneath those flashing lights there's an understanding soul
I've only got one story - I'm a man without love
Can we talk about it ma'am before you write me up

It's 4 to 1 in Atlanta, I'm gonna get lucky tonight
The girls are in my favor and if I play my cards just right
I might find an angel whose fire I can light
It's 4 to 1 in Atlanta and I'm on my way tonight
I'm on my way tonight
