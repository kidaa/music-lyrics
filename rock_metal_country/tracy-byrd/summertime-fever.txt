Well I went to the doctor to tell em the news
I got a fever from my head to my toes
Nurse said sorry but the docs not in
Hes got the fever too its summer again

1st chorus
Longnecks rednecks barbecues
Somethins always goin on
Spreadin like a fire and the mornin news
From your skin right down to your bones
Yachts and the john boats floatin on the river
Everybodys catchin that summertime fever

Mini-skirts and roman sandals
Women so hot lawd they oughta have handles
Fireworks on the fourth of july
Baseball, hot dogs, apple pies2nd chorus
Take off your tops on your t-birds
Cut off your blue jeans peel off your shirts
Yachts and john boats floatin on the river
Everybodys catchin the summertime

repeat 1st chorus

tag
A little suntan oil so you dont blister
Everybodys got that summertime fever
