Pat Terry/Tia Sillers 

She underdressed for the occasion
She wants to go back home and change
A maid of honor wearing waitress shoes, 
Just looks strange
Her little brother's getting married
A spur of the moment kind of thing
And she's giving up her lunch break, 
Holding the ring
She's never been the jealous kind, 
But she can't seem to stop, 
That little voice inside saying, 

I don't have to have it all
I'm not asking for the world
I don't need a star to fall
I just need a little light
Someone shining in my life
'Cause in the dark when you're afraid
A little love can go a long, long way There was a man she met one summer
His memory keeps her up at night
At the time it felt all wrong
But what if it was right? 
Now here she is, throwing the rice
Standing on the sidewalk, 
Trying not to cry thinking 

I don't have to have it all
I'm not asking for the world
I don't need a star to fall
I just need a little light
Someone shining in my life
'Cause in the dark when you're afraid
A little love can go a long, long way 

When it's lonely in your life
And you've almost lost your faith
A little love can go a long, long way
