It's cold this time of year and the people in this city make it colder
They've all forgotten what it means to lend a hand or cry on a shoulder
In this land of opportunity we fight like hell to make an extra dime
It would surely get the best of me without the heaven in my woman's eyes

It's the heaven in my woman's eyes that make life's hell a better place to be
It's the heaven in my woman's eyes that gives the inspiration that I need
Sometimes it seems a man is born to lose no matter how hard he tries
Life on earth would sure be hell without the heaven in my woman's eyes

Simplicity was once a way of life but now it's buried with our past
A dollar used to go a long long way but now it just goes fast
Oh how I wish that I could be as free as our union eagle flies
But the only time I'm free is when I view the heaven in my woman's eyes

It's the heaven in my woman's eyes that make life's hell a better place to be
It's the heaven in my woman's eyes that gives the inspiration that I need
Sometimes it seems a man is born to lose no matter how hard he tries
Life on earth would sure be hell without the heaven in my woman's eyes
Life on earth would sure be hell without the heaven in my woman's eyes
