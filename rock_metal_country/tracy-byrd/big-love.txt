Michael Clark/Jeff Stevens 

You need a man to get lost in 
With a heart big enough to roam 
No more fences for you to look through 
With your heart caught in a strangle hold 
I've got a love full of wide open spaces 

I've got a big love
Wild and free
Room to grow
As big as your dreams
Deep as a river in a raging flood
As endless as the stars above
I've got a big love

When two hearts make a stand together
On the solid rock of trust
They could be a million miles from each other
And still be side by side in love
I want to love you like that foreverI've got a big love
Wild and free
Room to grow
As big as your dreams
Deep as a river in a raging flood
As endless as the stars above
I've got a big love

You never dreamed you could have all you ever wanted
Darlin' you can have it all with me

I've got a big love
Wild and free
Room to grow
As big as your dreams
Deep as a river in a raging flood
As endless as the stars above
I've got a big love
I've got a big love

I've got a big love
I've got a big love
