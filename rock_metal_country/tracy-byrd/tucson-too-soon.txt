Tonight on a plane bound for Dallas
I see the bright lights of Tucson below
Shining on all of the memories
I thought I'd finally let go
It's been almost a year now
Since I told her I could not stay
And this achin' in my heart that I'm feelin' now
Is the price I guess I'll have to pay

For leavin' Tucson too soon
At the time it was something that I just had to do
But tonight face to face with that old desert moon
It seems I left Tucson too soonFrom thirty-five thousand feet up in the sky
The truth becomes clearer you know
'Cause it wasn't till now that I realized
The fool that I was long ago

For leavin' Tucson too soon
At the time it was something that I just had to do
But tonight face to face with that old desert moon
It seems I left Tucson too soon
It seems I left Tucson too soon
