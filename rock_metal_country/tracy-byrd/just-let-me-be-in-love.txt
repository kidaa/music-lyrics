English Version

My breath is short, my heart is beating fast
Every time I smile at her shes smiling back
If Im dreaming, please just let me sleep
Anyone can see that shes too good for me
Oh, give her time, shell find out soon enough
Just let me have and hold her til she does

What weve got going on is so incredible
This chemistry between us feels so wonderful
But knowing me, Ill probably
Find a way to mess it up
Who knows, who cares, right now
Just let me be in love

Dont concern me with reality
Dont convince me shes too heavenly
Forget the future, disregard the past
Those are questions I dont want to ask
To my heart, all that matters is tonight
Just let me live this moment in her eyes

What weve got going on is so incredible
This chemistry between us feels so wonderful
But knowing me, Ill probably
Find a way to mess it up
Who knows, who cares, right now
Just let me be in love

What weve got going on is so incredible

Who knows, who cares, right now
Just let me be in love
Let me be in love
I just want to be in love

Es increible lo que existe entre tu y yo
Este amor entre los dos es Magnifico
Conociendome probablemente voy a perder y pagar
Quien sabe que importa ahora
Solo quiero amar Dejame amar
