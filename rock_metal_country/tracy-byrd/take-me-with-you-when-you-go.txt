Mark Nesler/Jennifer Hanson 

You can settle down in Mexico
Runaway join a circus show
Whatever, baby it's alright with me
Take a walk in the pouring rain
Sky dive from a jet airplane
Love like ours is all about being free 

There's two chairs on the front porch
One's yours and one is mine
Four wheels in the driveway that'll take 
Us across the line
It doesn't really matter if you wanna rock or roll
Just take me with you when you go 

Swim the ocean for a million pearls
Hitchhike all the way around the world
Fly to the moon in a rocketship I don't care
Ride a camel cross the desert sand
Sail away to never never land
Imagination can take you anywhere So be the hero that rides off into the sun
Or a wild raging river always on the run
Change direction like the strong four winds that blow
Just take me with you when you go 

Today, tomorrow and forever 
Every turn you make
I want to be there - I want to be there 

Live like a gypsy - chase your distant dreams
Or get lost in the blues on Bourbon Street
Down in New Orleans
Believe in Heaven if you want to save your soul
Just take me with you when you go
Just take me with you when you go
