Larry Boone/Paul Nelson/Tracy Byrd 

Its an everyday battle
Just tryin' to break even
No, there aint no gettin ahead
When youre just gettin by
But shes standing on the front porch
When I get home in the evening
Thats how I know everythings gonna be all right

Ive crossed rivers with her kisses
Come through hard times with her soft touch
I dont know how but she makes it look easy
Getting me over mountains with her loveThere are days I wanna give up
Declare the world a winner
When the bills and the dog gone boss
Wont cut me no slack
But when were turnin' these lights down
And Im lyin' there with her
There aint a rock on the road of life
I cant get past

Ive crossed rivers with her kisses
Come through hard times with her soft touch
I dont know how but she makes it look easy
Getting me over mountains with her love
Getting me over mountains with her love
