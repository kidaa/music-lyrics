You say you hate to bother me
Baby, I'll be right there
You're having one of those days
I can see right through this phone
Nothing's out of my way
You can't ask too much
I'm just thankful to be
The one you lean on

Chorus:
So lay your troubles on me
It's what I live for
It makes me feel so complete
It's the reason I was born
Baby, what makes love love
And gives my life meaning
Is to be neededI know this ain't easy
Sometimes we try so hard
That we just end up overworked and overwhelmed
That's why I've got this shoulder
And two arms open wide
You won't ever have to do it by yourself

Repeat chorus
