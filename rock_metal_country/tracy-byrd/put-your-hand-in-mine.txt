Skip Ewing/Jimmy Wayne Barber 

He sat up on the bed and he watched me packing
He already knew why I was leavin
I took what I needed but I sure left a lot still hanging
But I figured Id get it come the weekend
He said Daddy when you get there
Are you gonna have a refridgerator
I kinda laughed and said I guess I will
Then he handed me a tracing of his hand
On the back of a piece of paper
And a magnet and my heart stood still when he said 

Put your hand in mine
And Ill be there anytime
When it feels like you could use a friend
Ill be there to lift you up again
You can reach out to me anytime
And put your hand in mine 

I drove past the Hardin Baptist Church
Though it wasnt really on the way to my hotel
Beside me on the seat I was looking at five small fingers
When I heard the chapel bell and it took me 
Back another life ago when our hearts were open
Oh, back when we could still agree
Back when the future that we had was full of hope and
You and I we got down on our knees and said 

Put your hand in mine
And Ill be there anytime
When it feels like you could use a friend
Ill be there to lift you up again
You can reach out to me anytime
And put your hand in mine 

I couldnt even stay away one night
I noticed you left on the light
And Ive only got one thing to say
If youre not too tired and its not too late 

Put your hand in mine
And Ill be here all the time
When it feels like you could use a friend
Ill be here to lift you up again
Would you reach out to me one more time
And put your hand in mine 

Would you reach out to me just one more time
And put your hand in mine
