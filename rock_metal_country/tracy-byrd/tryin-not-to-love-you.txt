I'm doin' the best I can, but Im startin' to understand
The best Ive got ain't getting me anywhere
I'm fightin' with all my might, but when Im alone at night
Your memory is more than I can bear

Chorus:
Tryin' not to love you is like tryin' not to breathe
Somethin' that I haven't learned to do
I can't stop believin' you're everything I need
That's a place my heart just won't go to
Tryin' not to love you

I make it a little while, without thinkin' of your sweet smile
Then suddenly I see you in my mind
Keep tellin' myself you're gone, keep sayin' Im movin' on
But everyday Im falling more behind

Repeat Chorus

Bridge:
You said Id be fine but you were lyin' 
'Cause after all this time it feels like dyin'

Repeat Chorus

I'm tryin' not to love you
