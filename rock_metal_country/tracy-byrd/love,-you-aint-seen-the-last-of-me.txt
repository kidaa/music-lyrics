Kendal Franceschi 

I been losin' my mind
One love at a time
Getting up just to be knocked down
But with all of that pain
I come back again
And I always go one more round 

Women, me and love
We just can't get it right
I might lose the battle 
But I love the fight 

No love, you ain't seen the last of me
I just keep comin' back to see
If I can capture the dream
Yeah love, you done all you can do to me
I don't give up so easily
No, you ain't seen the last of me 

I got a big, long list 
Of all the times I've missed 
When I zeroed in on love
And at times it seems
Like one heartache begins
Where the last one has just left off And tonight it looks like 
Another one is aimed in my heart
And she's lookin' at me
And I'm feelin' that feelin' start 

Oh love, you ain't seen the last of me
I just keep comin' back to see
If I can capture the dream
Yeah love, you done all you can do to me
I don't give up so easily
No, you ain't seen the last of me 

And tonight it looks like 
Another one is aimed in my heart
And she's lookin' at me
And I'm feelin' that feelin' start 

Oh love, you ain't seen the last of me
I just keep comin' back to see
If I can capture the dream
Yeah love, you done all you can do to me
I don't give up so easily
No, you ain't seen the last of me 

Yeah love, you done all you can do to me
I don't give up so easily
No, you ain't seen the last of me
