Joy Swinea/Toni Dae
Right about now she's brushin' her hair
Slippin' on her gown, wishin' I was there
She just hates these lonely nights when I'm gone
Right about now she's turnin' back the sheets
Asking God to watch over me
She'd never dream what I'm thinkin' about right about now

Right about now temptation's knockin' on my door
I'm one step away from doin' what I've never done before
I can hear the devil whisper, go ahead, she'll never find out
But if I did her wrong I could never feel right about now

Right about now she's reachin' for the phone
She knows it's me calling home
I can almost see the smile on her face
Right about now if she only knew
What a lonely man could do
It would break her heart in two right about now

Right about now temptation's knockin' on my door
I'm one step away from doin' what I've never done before
I can hear the devil whisper, go ahead, she'll never find out
But if I did her wrong I could never feel right about now
I can hear the devil whisper, go ahead, she'll never find out
But if I did her wrong I could never feel right about now
