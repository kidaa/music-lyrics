You packed up all my clothes 
And put em by the door
Is this your way of telling me
I dont live here anymore
Youve gone and called a cab
And told me where to go
Two hearts that used to be on fire
Have just gone up in smoke

Now I aint no magician
Cant change the way things are
I cant make you love me
If its not in the cards
I cant wave a magic wand 
And make you want me near
But I can do a hat trick I'll put it on and dissapear

Now I aint gonna crawl
And I wont jump through hoops
To try and make you love me
Like I used to do
You pulled this stunt before
And I kept holding on
But this time when you close the door
Look around and I'll be goneCuz  I aint no magician
Cant change the way things are
I cant make you love me
If its not in the cards
I cant wave a magic wand 
And make you want me near
But I can do a hat trick I'll put it on and dissapear

So I'll just do my  hat trick
 I'll put it on and dissapear
