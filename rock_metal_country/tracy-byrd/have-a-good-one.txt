Have a good one she told me as she walked away
What a fine time to tell me to have a nice day
She's gone now but the words she said still linger on and on
Have a good one, thought I had one, I guess I was wrong

She could have said I'm sorry or darlin' please don't cry
But now there's tears each time I hear that cheerful goodbye
It's over but over and over it echoes all night long
Have a good one, thought I had one, I guess I was wrong

She could have said I'm sorry or darlin' please don't cry
But now there's tears each time I hear that cheerful goodbye
It's over but over and over it echoes all night long
Have a good one, thought I had one, I guess I was wrong
Have a good one, thought I had one, I guess I was wrong
