Gary Scruggs/Shawn Camp 

Used to think that love would be so simple 
Just happy ever after one another
Sometimes it's hot to trot
And sometimes it's the old cold shoulder
Oh, you can't have one without the other, brother
No, you can't have one without the other 

Sometimes you'll think she's sent from heaven
A best friend, confidante and lover 
Oh, there are times that little angel
She ain't nothin' but a devil woman 
Oh, you can't have one without the other, brother
No, you can't have one without the other 

She can be such a good girl
But, she can be so bad
Put you on top of the world
Cut you down so fast
Sometimes she's my baby
Sometimes she's a mother
Oh, you can't have one without the other, brother
No, you can't have one without the other I wouldn't take a million dollars for her
Or pay a single dime for ten more of her
I guess there's a heads and tails
To every lucky silver dollar
Oh, you can't have one without the other, brother
No, you can't have one without the other 

Oh, she can make the time fly
She can be a drag
Put you on cloud nine
Turn to rain so fast
Sometimes she's my baby
Sometimes she's a mother
Oh, you can't have one without the other, brother
No, you can't have one without the other 

Oh, you can't have one without the other, brother
No, you can't have one without the other
