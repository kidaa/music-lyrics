Verse 1:
Little Lady standin next to me 
Isnt she a pretty thing
Im the one who put that ring on her left hand
Another fella can tip his hat
And Im as gentle as a pussycat
But let it go much further than that and hes a dead man

Chorus:
Thats a good way
Thats a real good way
Thats a real good way to get on my bad side

Verse 2:
Politician on my TV
Says hes only lookin out for me
That he knows what the poor man needs in the long run
But every year he gives himself a raise
With a chunk of every buck I make
Now hes talkin like he wants to take my shotgun

Repeat Chorus
Verse 3:
I aint looking for no trouble, dont wanna start no fight
Dont want more than I got comin, I only wanna do whats right
Just treat me like I treat you and well get along just fine
But mister take one step across that line

Repeat Chorus
Bridge:
I like Van Halen and I like George Jones
Charlie Daniels and the Rolling Stones
And Bocephus when he rocks and rolls still kills me
Ought to be a law against cowboy rap
And all that boy band crap
A little sissy in a cowboy hat aint country..but

Repeat Chorus
