I walked in the band just stunk
The singer couldn't carry a tune in a bucket
Was on a mission to drown her memory but
I thought no way with all this raucous

chorus
But after one round with Jose Cuervo
I caught my boots tapping long with the beat
And after two rounds with Jose Cuervo
That band was sounding pretty darn good to me

Then some stranger asked me to dance
And I revealed to her my two left feet
Said don't get me wrong Im glad you asked
But tonight's about me and an old memory

chorus
Then after three rounds with Jose Cuervo
I let her lead me out on the floor
And after four rounds with Jose Cuervo
I was showing off moves never seen beforebridge
Well around five or round six
I forgot what I came to forget
And after round seven or was it eight
I bought a round for the whole damn place

chorus
And after nine rounds with Jose Cuervo
They were countin' me out I was about to give in
And after ten rounds with Jose Cuervo
I lost count and started counting again

tag
One round with Jose Cuervo
Two rounds with Jose Cuervo
Three rounds with Jose Cuervo . . .
