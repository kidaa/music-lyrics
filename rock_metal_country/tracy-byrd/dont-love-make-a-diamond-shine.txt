Craig Wiseman/Mike Dekle 

Tommy and Janey hardly eighteen
Holdin' hands at the jewelry store
Eyes open wide starin' inside
At the ring that they wanted for her
Mister bring it closer mister can we hold it
I think it's gonna fit just fine
As he slipped it on her hand Janey kissed her man
Don't love make a diamond shine

Don't love make a diamond shine
It don't matter if it costs a dime
Dang thing looks like a million bucks
Sittin' on the hand of a girl in love
A perfect fifteen carat is duller than dirt if the heart don't wear it
With three little words it'll knock you blind
Don't love make a diamond shine

There's a rich lady with a new Mercedes
Livin' up in a high rise
She got a big ol' rock on her left hand
That looks cheaper than a Cracker Jack prize
'Cause her man don't know that it ain't the dough
You know all he needs to spend is time
And that big marquis'd be a laser beam
Don't love make a diamond shine

Don't love make a diamond shine
It don't matter if it costs a dime
Dang thing looks like a million bucks
Sittin' on the hand of a girl in love
A perfect fifteen carat is duller than dirt if the heart don't wear it
With three little words it'll knock you blind
Don't love make a diamond shine

Don't love make a diamond shine
It don't matter if it costs a dime
Dang thing looks like a million bucks
Sittin' on the hand of a girl in love
A perfect fifteen carat is duller than dirt if the heart don't wear it
With three little words it'll knock you blind
Don't love make a diamond shine
Don't love make a diamond shine
