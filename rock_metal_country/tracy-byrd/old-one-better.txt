Mark Nesler/Tony Martin 

Well, she said when she left that a change might do me good
So I took her advice and I did the best I could
Ive gone from this to that til Im nothing like I used to be
In fact, everyone says Im a totally different me

Got a new life but I still like the old one better
Its nice but it just wont ever quite be the same
I have everything a man would want but I cant forget her
Oh, I got a new life but I still like the old one better

I pulled up my roots in the country and I moved uptown
Went from a slower pace to running with a faster crowd
I found a sweet young girl to replace all the love we knew
But I guess theres just some things you cant improve

Got a new life but I still like the old one better
Its nice but it just wont ever quite be the same
I have everything a man could want but I cant forget her
Oh, I got a new life but I still like the old one better

I have everything a man would want but I cant forget her
Oh, I got a new life but I still like the old one better

Oh, I got a new life but I still like the old one better
Yeah, I got a new life but I still like the old one better
