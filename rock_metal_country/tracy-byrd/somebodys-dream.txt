There's a burned out farm house down the road
Barn's fallin' in, field's over grown
Keep out signs on a broken fence, passers by say ";what a mess";
It don't cross their mind that not long ago, that was

chorus
Somebody's dream, somebody's hope
Somebody's world, gone up in smoke
Ain't life a twisting, turning, changing machine
They had big plans, they had no doubts, but then the bottom fell out
It fell apart at the seams
You wouldn't know that it used to be
Somebody's dream

He's seventeen his thumbs in the air
Running away to god knows where
And no one wants to pick him up, all they see's a no good punk
The tore up clothes, the cigarette, the hair, ah but that's

chorus
Somebody's dream, somebody's hope
Somebody's world, gone up in smoke
Ain't life a twisting, turning, changing, machine

Girl walks in the pawn shop to sell her wedding ring
Says ";since he left man it don't mean a thing";
She's thinkin' about what happened, thinking what went wrong
Man across the counters thinkin' what price tag he'll put on

Somebody's dream, somebody's hope
Somebody's world, gone up in smoke
Ain't life a twisting, turning, changing machine
She had made plans, had no doubts, she had it figured out
Guess he figured differently 
But still she knows someday she'll be 
Somebody's dream
