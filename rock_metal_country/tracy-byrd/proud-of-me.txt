Tony Martin / Mark Nesler 

As the sun's coming up
She puts coffee on
Love in a cup
She makes it strong
She kisses my cheek
And I'm on my way
With her on my mind
I work hard all day
Just trying to keep 
Her proud of me 

It's hard to believe 
A girl like her fell
For someone with grease
Under his fingernails
And like a tattoo
Soap can't wash off
It's easy to see 
I'm nobody's boss
I'm just trying to keep her proud of me 

Don't know what she sees
In me that she loves
Oh, but I'm gonna do my best 
To see she always does Don't know what she sees
In me that she loves
Oh, but I'm gonna do my best 
To see she always does 

Oh, even though
I can't give her much
But I think that she knows
I'm just trying to keep her proud of me 

As the sun's coming up 
She puts coffee on
