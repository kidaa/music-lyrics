Well my car broke down outside of town
Up ahead I saw a farm
Some white-faced heifers chewing on that cud
Thought cows can't do no harm
Lackin' better sense I jumped the fence
And went crashin' through the corn
>From the corner of my eye
I wondered why
One of them cows had horns

Well he seemed to be approachin' me at quite a rapid pace
Does he want me to pet him or does he just want to race
Next thing I knew the sky's so blue and I'm up above the trees
And I'm face down layin' on the ground starin' up at somebody's knees

And I said with calves like that you gotta be a cowgirl
They don't make calves like that in town
She had a big ol' hat and big blue eyes and blond curls
With calves like that you gotta be a cowgirl

Now I'm her man and she's my girl and we're livin' on the farm
We spend all day makin' hay out behind the barn
Well our little boy wants to grow up and be exactly just like me
But our little girl says hey you'all I wonder what I'll be

And I said with calves like that you gotta be a cowgirl
They don't make calves like that in town
She had a big ol' hat and big blue eyes and blond curls
With calves like that you gotta be a cowgirl

With calves like that you gotta be a cowgirl
They don't make calves like that in town
She had a big ol' hat and big blue eyes and blond curls
With calves like that you gotta be a cowgirl
