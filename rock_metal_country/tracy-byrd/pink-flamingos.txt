Wood Newton/Micki Furhman
I was a rebel in my younger years
I'd...drink with the devil if he bought me a beer
Wore out two pickups just running around
Mama thought I never would settle down
That was before I met sweet Irma Jean
She made a new man outta me

We got pink flamingos in the front yard
Picture window with a view of Wal-Mart
Blue collar heaven domestic bliss
It just doesn't get any better than this
We got pink flamingos, pink flamingos, pink flamingos

Sweet Irma Jean is a den mother now
With a station wagon and a charge account
Bubba Junior pitches for his baseball team
Little sister's running for Rose Bud Queen
And me I'm doing good at the used car lot
Is this a great country or whatWe got pink flamingos in the front yard
Picture window with a view of Wal-Mart
Blue collar heaven domestic bliss
It just doesn't get any better than this
We got pink flamingos, pink flamingos, pink flamingos

People slow down when they drive by
They wave and smile but there's envy in their eyes
We ain't rich and won't be for a while
But no doubt about it baby we got style

With got pink flamingos in the front yard
Picture window with a view of Wal-Mart
Blue collar heaven domestic bliss
It just doesn't get any better than this
