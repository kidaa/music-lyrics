He's driving me out of your mind
You're goin' crazy over him I see the signs
He won't leave you alone he's with you all the time
Driving me out of your mind

Can't he see that you still haven't gotten over me
And you're just not in the mood for company
Is he really fool enough to think he has a chance
Buyin' one red rose and asking you to dance

He's driving me out of your mind
You're goin' crazy over him I see the signs
He won't leave you alone he's with you all the time
Driving me out of your mind

A broken heart like yours can't possibly mend overnight
So why's he out there holding you so tight
Thought I'd have all the time I need to make up for my wrongs
Someone tell me what the hell is going on

He's driving me out of your mind
You're goin' crazy over him I see the signs
He won't leave you alone he's with you all the time
Driving me out of your mind
He won't leave you alone he's with you all the time
Driving me out of your mind
Driving me out of your mind
