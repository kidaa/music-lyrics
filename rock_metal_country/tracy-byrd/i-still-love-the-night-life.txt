Brad Paisley/Kelley Lovelace 

How dare you accuse me of being on a leash
Just because you havent seen me
On the town the last few weeks
You say that girl Im seein has somehow made me change
But I say take a closer look
Deep down Im still the same

Yeah, I still love the night life
Even though Ive settled down
I can have the time of my life
Without leavin the house
We have our own private parties
The good times never end
Yeah, I still love the night life
Its the best its ever been

There may not be a jukebox, but I still love to dance
We two step cross that kitchen floor
Each time we get the chance
From neon light to soft white, sawdust to squeaky clean
Its different circumstances
Ah, but some things never change

Yeah, I still love the night life
Even though Ive settled down
I can have the time of my life
Without leavin the house
We have our private parties
The good times never end
Yeah, I still love the night life
Its the best its ever been

Yeah, I still love the night life
Even though Ive settled down
I can have the time of my life
Without leavin the house
We have our own private parties
The good times never end
Yeah, I still love the night life
Its the best its ever been

Yeah, I still love the night life
Its the best its ever been
