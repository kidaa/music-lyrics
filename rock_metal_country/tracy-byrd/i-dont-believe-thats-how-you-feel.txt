Kostas/Harlan Howard
I don't believe that's how you feel
I don't believe that you don't love me
Guess I must have hurt you bad
I didn't mean to make you sad
And I sure regret the things I told you now

I don't believe that we're all through
I don't believe that's it's all over
Let's forget who's right or wrong
And remember we belong together

Let's forgive and forget and start over
We all make mistakes now and then
I don't want to love any other
I just want to love you againLet's forgive and forget and start over
We all make mistakes now and then
I don't want to love any other
I just want to love you again

I don't believe that's how you feel
I don't believe that you don't love me
Guess I must have hurt you bad
I didn't mean to make you sad
And I sure regret the things I told you now

Guess I must have hurt you bad
I didn't mean to make you sad
And I sure regret the words I told you now
