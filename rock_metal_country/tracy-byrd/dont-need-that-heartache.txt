I hate to say it heart I told you so
You wouldn't listen you just had to go
And take her back again
Knowing you couldn't win
She's put you through all this before
And you don't need that heartache anymore

I feel the hurt that's inside of you
I've seen all the things she's put you through
Now you're alone and ache
She's finally made you break
Your troubles just walked out the door
You don't need that heartache anymore

Maybe in a while you'll feel better
Try real hard to forget her
She ain't worth your teardrops
Or walking the floor
It's gonna take time but I know you'll do it
Come on heart you can get through it
You don't need that heartache anymoreMaybe in a while you'll feel better
Try real hard to forget her
She ain't worth your teardrops
Or walking the floor
It's gonna take time but I know you'll do it
Come on heart you can get through it
You don't need that heartache anymore

Maybe in a while you'll feel better
Try real hard to forget her
She ain't worth your teardrops
Or walking the floor
It's gonna take time but I know you'll do it
Come on heart you can get through it
You don't need that heartache anymore
You don't need that heartache anymore
You don't need that heartache anymore
