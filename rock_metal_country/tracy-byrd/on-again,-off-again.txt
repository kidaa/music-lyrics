Austin Cunningham/Gil Grand 

She locks him out, but leaves the key
Where he knows it'll always be
In their secret place
He comes and goes and she never knows
Just where she stands in this crazy game he plays
He's always been this way

On again, off again
It's breakin' her heart again
The way he runs hot and cold
For her it's gettin' old
One day they're flyin' high
The next day he's sayin' goodbye
If things don't change
She just can't go on loving him
On again, off againShe ain't gettin' any younger
And he ain't gettin' any closer
To buyin' her a ring
And every time she brings it up
He does his dance and tells her anything
To keep her on a string

It's On again, off again
It's breakin' her heart again
The way he runs hot and cold
For her it's gettin' old
One day they're flyin' high
The next day he's sayin' goodbye
If things don't change
She just can't go on loving him
On again, off again

One day they're flyin' high
The next day he's sayin' goodbye
If things don't change
She just can't go on loving him
'Cause forever can't begin 'til this thing ends
This on again, off again
