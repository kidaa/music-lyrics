You need a man with an honest heart
Someone who loves you for who you are
Someone whos promises wont break
Honey Ive got what it takes

You need a man with a tender touch
Two strong arms to wrap you up
And love all your nights away
Baby Ive got what it takes

Girl you can search to the ends of the earth
If thats what you need to do
But under all the stars theres just one heart
Meant for lovin you
And Im gonna prove to you babe
Ive got what it takes

You need a man wholl walk the line
Standin right here by your side
Until his dyin day
Darlin Ive got what it takesGirl you can search to the ends of the earth
If thats what you need to do
But under all the stars theres just one heart
Meant for lovin you
And Im gonna prove to you babe
Ive got what it takes

Girl you can search to the ends of the earth
If thats what you need to do
But under all the stars theres just one heart
Meant for lovin you

Ive got what it takes

And Im gonna prove to you baby
Ive got what it takes

You need a man with an honest heart
Baby I've got what it takes
