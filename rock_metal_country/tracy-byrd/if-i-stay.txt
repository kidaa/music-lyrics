Dean Dillon/Larry Bastian
Lately the ties that bind
Feel like a noose around my neck
Chokin' the life from me
And leavin' my dreams gaspin' for breath
I've lost sight and so have you
Of the man you were attracted to
We lost me somewhere along the way
And I can't live like this no more
Knowing just outside that door
There's a road that leaves this all behind

There's a half a tank of freedom in my Chevy and I'm leavin'
And there's nothin' in this world you can say
So don't insist on standin' in my way
I can't find me if I stay

If you really love me if you care at all
You'll gladly step aside
I've given you the best of me and now the rest of me
Is gonna take a ride
There's a gravel road that turns into a two-lane blacktop highway
That stretches out for miles and miles and miles
And the mileposts and the road signs are pointin' out a white line
To a man I haven't been in quite awhile

There's a half a tank of freedom in my Chevy and I'm leavin'
And there's nothin' in this world you can say
So don't insist on standin' in my way
I can't find me if I stay
I can't find me if I stay
I can't find me if I stay
I can't find me if I stay
