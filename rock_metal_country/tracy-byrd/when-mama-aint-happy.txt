Ever since Monday
I've seen it comin'
When I say what's wrong
She just says nothin'
Well I ain't about to let it go
Cause I've loved her long enough to know

When Mama Ain't Happy, ain't nobody happy
So daddy's gonna make mama happy tonight
I've got a limo waitin' and dinner reservations
A corner table with some candlelight
We're gonna spend some money, I'm gonna call her honey
I wanna see the sparkle back in her eyes
When mama ain't happy, ain't nobody happy
So daddy's gonna make mama happy tonight

I see in those green eyes
Her red-head temper
And she can make July
As cold as December
Well I love her every way she is
But brother I've discovered at times like thisWhen Mama ain't happy, ain't nobody happy
So daddy's gonna make mama happy tonight
I told the babysitter, fix a macaroni dinner
And try to get the kids in bed by nine
We're gonna spend some money, I'm gonna call her honey
I wanna see the sparkle back in her eyes
When mama ain't happy, ain't nobody happy
So daddy's gonna make mama happy tonight

When mama ain't happy, ain't nobody happy
So daddy's gonna make mama happy tonight
