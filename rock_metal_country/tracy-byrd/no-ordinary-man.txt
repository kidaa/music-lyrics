Eight seconds ain't very long to live
But tonight he barely made five
He gave all that he had to give
But the big bull won tonight
He climbs into that old pickup
Black coffee in his hand
Rodeo ain't no ordinary life
But a cowboy ain't no ordinary man

Well he rides just to keep his spirit alive
Makin' money for his wife and kids
He tried other kinds of work
But nothing ever seemed to fit
Oh he loves the smell of a Brahma bull
The feel of leather in his hand
Rodeo ain't no ordinary life
But a cowboy ain't no ordinary man

He's got a gold buckle on his mind
And he don't ride to lose
Tomorrow night he'll nod and yell outside
And they'll turn his future loose
But no matter how bad he hurts
He'll tip his hat to the fans
Rodeo ain't no ordinary life
But a cowboy ain't no ordinary manWell he rides just to keep his spirit alive
Makin' money for his wife and kids
He tried other kinds of work
But nothing ever seemed to fit
Oh he loves the smell of a Brahma bull
The feel of leather in his hand
Well Rodeo ain't no ordinary life
But a cowboy ain't no ordinary man

Well he rides just to keep his spirit alive
Makin' money for his wife and kids
He tried other kinds of work
But nothing ever seemed to fit
Oh he loves the smell of a Brahma bull
The feel of leather in his hand
Well Rodeo ain't no ordinary life
But a cowboy ain't no ordinary
He's an extra ordinary man
