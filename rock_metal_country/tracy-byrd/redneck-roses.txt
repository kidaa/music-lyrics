Tracy Byrd/Byron Hill
Not so long ago
On his way home from work
He'd stop by the side of the road
Step out of that old beat up Ford
That he drove
And he'd walk around
Searchin' the ground
For a handful of wildflower blooms
Thinkin' of where he'd be soon
There with her

She called them redneck roses
'Cause that's what they were
A simple gift of love
From a country boy to his girl
She called them redneck roses
They didn't cost a dime
But they brought a smile to her face
Every time

Now it's years down the line
She sits home alone
It's the usual end of the day
Once again, he's still workin' late
And never callsThey've got a house on a hill
No problems with bills
And a baby that's on the way
But her heart longs for those yesterdays
And his love

She called them redneck roses
'Cause that's what they were
A simple gift of love
From a country boy to his girl
She called them redneck roses
They didn't cost a dime
But they brought a smile to her face
Every time

They could still put a smile on her face
If he only had the time
