Mark Nesler/Tony Martin 

Everybody has a gift thats given to them when they come into this life
Something they can do better than others and never really have to try
For the longest time I didnt know what I was born to do
But the moment that I took you in my arms and held you close to me I knew

For me its you
Just comes naturally
Nobody in the whole wide world
Can love you as good as me
I dont know why
But its so easy to do
Guess the Lord has a way of blessing us all
And for me its you

Some can take a brush and make colors and canvas a work of art
While some can swing a bat and knock a little white ball clear out of the park
And I cant help but notice when one does what they do best
They give it all theyve got and love it with all of their heart and nothing less

For me its you
It just comes naturally
Nobody in the whole wide world
Can love you good as me
I dont know why
Its so easy to do
Guess the Lord has a way of blessing us all
And for me its you

Guess the Lord has a way of blessing us all
And for me its you
