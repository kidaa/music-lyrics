Tracy Byrd C Lyrics as sung.

She comes down from yellow mountain
On a dark, flat land she rides
On a pony she named wildfire
With a whirlwind by her side
On a cold Nebraska night

Oh, they say she died one winter
And there came a killing frost
And the pony she named wildfire
Busted down his stall
And in a blizzard he was lost

She ran calling wildfire
Calling wildfire
Calling wildfireBy the dark of the moon I planted
But there came an early snow
Theres been a hoot owl howling by my window now
For six nights in a row
Shes coming for me I know
And on wildfire were both gonna go

Well be riding with wildfire
Riding with wildfire
Riding with wildfire

On a wildfire were gonna ride
Were gonna leave sod bustin behind
Let these hard times right out if my mind
Riding wildfire
