I've made you mad as hell heard you yell
But I've never seen you crying
It's clear to us it's serious
We've never been this close to dying
We've gotten way too reckless baby
With this love I thought we treasured
If we keep on like this
We just might miss forever

Baby we never thought to swerve
It's like we drove straight into the curve
Baby we better hit the brakes and take it slow
And get these wheels back on the road

Why do I do what I do
When I don't know what I'm doin'
I can see the hurt from the words
That I'm throwing as they hit you
Why can't I just shut my mouth
And take some time to breathe
You'd think I'd know by now
To think before I speak

Baby we never thought to swerve
It's like we drove straight into the curve
Baby we better hit the brakes and take it slow
And get these wheels back on the road

Our first kiss was in the car
How'd we end up where we are
Broken down and worlds apart

Baby we never thought to swerve
It's like we drove straight into the curve
Baby we better hit the brakes
We better take it slow
And get these wheels back on the road

Get these wheels back on the road
