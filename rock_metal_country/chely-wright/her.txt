Just down the street eight city blocks
Right behind the Dairy Queen and the 108 bus stop
There's a little house I can see it in my mind
Oh I should turn around but I keep on driving by 
'Cause you're there with her
And I don't know who's got it worse
Me, you or her 
I've got her number in my book
I've got it memorized don't even have to look
Oh just the thought of dialing makes my heart race
Oh I could call her up but what would I say 
'Cause you're there with her
And I don't know who's got it worse
In this game we all play
Who'll be smart enough to walk away
Me, you or her
There are no rings or vows
Being broken or tossed around
Just three hearts all waiting to see
If you wind up over here with me
Or there with her 
'Cause you're there with her
And I don't know who's got it worse
In this game we all play
Who'll be smart enough to walk away
Me, will it be you, or will it be her
Just down the street eight city blocks
Right behind the Dairy Queen and the 108 bus stop
There's a little house I can see it in my mind
Oh I should turn around but I keep on driving by
