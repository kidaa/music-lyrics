Wouldn't it be cool if all the supermodels tried to look like me
And wouldn't it be cool if someone's character was something you could see
Wouldn't it be cool if I could fly
Get a new perspective from the sky
Ooo wouldn't it be cool

Wouldn't it be cool if I could do long division in my head
Wouldn't it be cool if I didn't have to edit what I said
Wouldn't it be cool if life was fair
When someone says, "I love you" they will always be there

[Chorus:]

If one day you beg and plead for me to take you back
I would be so unaffected I would simply laugh and laugh
Wouldn't it be cool... cool

Wouldn't it be cool if I could catch you at a restaurant with her
And wouldn't it be cool if I was strong enough to muster up the nerve
To tell her all the secrets that we had
Just to see you squirm and feel as bad as I do
Wouldn't it be cool

[Chorus]
