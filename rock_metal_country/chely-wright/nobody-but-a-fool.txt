Nobody but a fool would love you 
After the way you've done me 
Broke every vow you made me, broke every rule 
Who'd lie awake all night, cry til you were out of sight 
Loving you with all her might 
Nobody but a fool 
I don't know what it was that made me trust you like I did 
Stars got in my eyes or either rocks got in my head 
All I know was your two lips kissed me heavenly 
Til yesterday those tender lips kissed goodbye to me 
I put on the saddest song ignore the telephone
I go ahead and cry the make-up from my eyes
I let my mind play tricks and then
I let it fool me once again
Into thinkin' that I'll never be alright
Then when I'm no longer crazy and I'm back to my old self
I realize how good I've always felt 
People tried to tell me how you'd hurt me I suppose 
But I was blind as any bat and deaf as any post 
You clawed me like a tiger, I loved you like a lamb 
And knowing I still do just shows me up for what I am 
Nobody but a fool would love you 
After the way you've done me 
Broke every vow you made me, broke every rule 
Who'd lie awake all night, cry til you were out of sight 
Loving you with all her might 
Nobody but a fool 
Nobody but a fool 
Nobody but a fool
