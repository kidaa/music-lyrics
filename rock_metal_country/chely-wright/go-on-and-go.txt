Chely Wright/Dale Dodson
Don't waste your time givin' me your reasons
Let's skip the ceremony of goodbye
Let's get down to the part where you are leavin'
You can space me all the who, what, whens and whys
Go on and go
Just hit the road
You won't find me standin' in your way
If you're not happy with me
Then I'll gladly set you free
Go on and go away
You want to talk this through to make it easy
A break-up just as painless as can be
And there's that line that you never meant to hurt me
Well, you're just trying to clear your conscience as you leave
Go on and go
Just hit the road
You won't find me standin' in your way
If you're not happy with me
Then I'll gladly set you free
Go on and go away
Go on and go away
