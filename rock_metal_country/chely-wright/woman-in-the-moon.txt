Another lonesome night
Staring at the sky
But it don't help to ease an aching heart
The man up in the moon
Keeps on talking himself blue
And once again I'm left here in the dark
Let me talk to the woman in the moon
I think I need another point of view
That ol' man up there
Doesn't seem to care
Let me talk to the woman in the moon
Heaven's up above
I just want a little love
'Cause I'm so tired of living all alone
Please lend a friendly ear
'Cause I need some help down here
Somebody with a heart to be my own
Let me talk to the woman in the moon
I think I need another point of view
That ol' man up there
Doesn't seem to care
Let me talk to the woman in the moon
I can't help but look up there and wonder
Will I ever hold him in my arms
Please help me with the spell I've fallen under
'Cause I can't seem to find my lucky stars
Let me talk to the woman in the moon
I think I need another point of view
That ol' man up there
Doesn't seem to care
Let me talk to the woman in the moon
Let me talk to the woman in the moon
