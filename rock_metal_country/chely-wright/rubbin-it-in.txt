Track 9 - Time 3:44
Last night, I went out with some old friends
I couldn't help but think of you again
Someone was wearing your cologne
What a cruel way to remind me that you're gone
A couple danced over by the jukebox
Hand in hand, I thought they'd never stop
They played our song again and again
How could anyone be so insensitive
They're laughing at me, I just know it
As if they knew all along I'd blow it
Everywhere I turn, something reminds me of the way things were
I love you, I lost you
I know what a fool I've been
And it seems like the whole world keeps rubbin' it in
Every time I turn on the T.V.
I come across one of our favorite movies
A love story that ends with a kiss
How'd the cable company get in on this
I swear I pass you when I'm on the highway
Since when did everyone drive red Chevrolets
It never really is your car
I think some people have taken this a little too far
They're laughing at me, I just know it
As if they knew all along I'd blow it
Everywhere I turn, something reminds me of the way things were
I love you, I lost you
I know what a fool I've been
And it seems like the whole world keeps rubbin' it in
They're laughing at me, I just know it
As if they knew all along I'd blow it
Everywhere I turn, something reminds me of the way things were
I love you, I lost you
I know what a fool I've been
And it seems like the whole world keeps rubbin' it in
Yeah, it seems like the whole world keeps rubbin' it
