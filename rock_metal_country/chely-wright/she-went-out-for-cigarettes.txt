Track 2 - Time 4:13
He was glued to the TV
When she asked him for the keys
Said, ";I'm going to the market Is there anything you need?";
The first quarter was underway
He never missed a play
She pulled out of the driveway
Took a left at the light
Didn't stop at the market
She just drove right on by
Across the railroad tracks
She never once looked back
She went out for cigarettes
And just kept driving on
He doesn't even know it yet
But she's gone
As far away as she can get
Passed the point of no regret
She went out for cigarettes
And just kept driving on
Half time is over
The sun is sinking low
It's almost time for supper
But there's nothing on the stove
He looks up from his easy chair
He just noticed she's not there
She made a stop at the bank
Took out some cash
Now she's racing down the highway
On a full tank of gas
As fast as she can go
To where she doesn't know
She went out for cigarettes
And just kept driving on
He doesn't even know it yet
But she's gone
As far away as she can get
Passed the point of no regret
She went out for cigarettes
And just kept driving on
She went out for cigarettes
And drove on
