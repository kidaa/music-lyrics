Russel Smith/James H. Brown, Jr.
Sometimes I still think of you 
Love that's gone by and the things I didn't do 
Time heals hearts, so they all say 
Passage of years slowly pulls the pain away 
But there's still a little tenderness left in everything I do 
It's what I learned from loving you 
That's what I learned from loving you 
Times have changed, I have changed, too 
Even my eyes have turned a deeper shade of blue 
Well, I guess it's all that crying they went through 
It's what I learned from loving you 
That's what I learned from loving you 
Well, I had too much to learn to hold on to someone like you 
And it took losing you to make me see 
The man you needed to be 
I don't cry, though we're apart 
And someday soon someone else will need this heart 
And the next time I'm gonna know when a love is true 
It's what I learned from loving you 
That's what I learned from loving you 
That's what I learned from loving you 
That's what I learned from loving you
