Gary Burr/Chely Wright
Track 5 - Time 3:47
Caution's in the wind
The hardest part is through
You don't have to try so hard
To make me fall for you
I've surprised myself
With what I've gone and done
Just today I heard myself
Swear you were the one
Laugh I just have to laugh
I really thought you knew
I can't believe
That your asking me
When I will love you
I already do
I already do
You've been doing fine
Please don't change a thing
It's too good to hide away
So I might as well come clean
I didn't shout it out
But everybody knew
Funny you're the only one
Who didn't have a clue
Laugh I just have to laugh
I really thought you knew
I can't believe
That your asking me
When I will love you
I already do
I already do
I gave you my heart
Can't you feel the power
You want to see the light
Baby the sun's been up for hours
Laugh I just have to laugh
I really thought you knew
I can't believe
That your asking me
When I will love you
I already do
I already do
