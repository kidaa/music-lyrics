We don't ever stay mad for long and I
Guess I've always liked that 'bout us
We usually end up on the floor laughin'
Makin' fun of whatever it was

Passions run high
And it might seem like sometimes
We don't get along but

Baby that's just the way we do it
Fight a little bit but we get through it
Lovin' like this you hold on to it
Baby that's just the way we do it
If we hold back on what we're feelin' we
Run the danger of growin' apart
Everybody knows that's how love goes from
Good to bad in the beat of a heart

As long as we talk
Nobody's walkin' out
Right or wrong

Baby that's just the way we do it
Fight a little bit but we get through it
When you got it like this you hold on to it
Baby that's just the way we do it
