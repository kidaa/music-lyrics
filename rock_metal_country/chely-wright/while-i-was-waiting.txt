Roxie Dean/Gordon Bradberry
I fumbled with a napkin, I had a glass of wine
I was a little early, I had a little time
I sat up at the bar talking to a stranger
It seemed a safe thing to do
While I was waiting, while I was waiting for you 
He said that I was pretty, then he turned back to his beer
And something about this stranger was subtle and sincere
He said he grew up in Memphis, but he didn't like the blues
And our one dance turned into two
While I was waiting, while I waiting for you 
When you walked in the door
When you walked up to him
When you took my hand and said that you were cutting in
This stranger from Memphis was very polite
He said you sure do have a lovely wife
Wife, he thought I was your wife
Well that's what got me thinking, it's like someone slammed the door
You just wanna girlfriend, I want so much more
You ask me what's the hurry? You say let's take our time
Well I say our time it just flew
While I was waiting, while I was waiting
For you to pop the question, for you to make your move
I turned into someone new
While I was waiting, while I was waiting for you
