I heard a real good joke that you would love
And if I'd heard it a few weeks before
I would've reached for the phone and called you up
But we don't do that anymore

I guess we're just old friends who meet like this
In line at the grocery store.
When we say goodbye there is no kiss
'Cause we don't do that anymore

What do I wish I could undo
What do I want to say to you
What did I lose when I gave you back your ring
What did I change by letting go
What do I think I miss the most? everything

When I'm flying high or slip and fall
Hey, that's what a best friend is for
There was a time we shared it all
But we don't do that anymore

What do I wish I could undo
What do I want to say to you
What did I lose when I gave you back your ring
What did I change by letting go
What do I think I miss the most? Everything

The way we laugh
The way we kiss
It just feels wrong to be like this

What do I wish I could undo
What do I want to say to you
What did I lose when I gave you back your ring
What did I change by letting go
What do I think I miss the most? Everything
Ohhh...everything
