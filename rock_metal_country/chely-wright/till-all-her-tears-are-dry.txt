I sat bored at my piano
When he walked into the bar
When he nodded from his table
I said I know just how things are
Cause the only time I see you
Is when you've made your lady cry
And you always say you'll only stay
Till All Her Tears Are Dry
Now for months I've watched you wrestle
With that other side of you
You're scared one day you'll lose your temper
Yes and then you'll lose her too
Oh they say that love is brutal
And for years she's paid the price
It might be too late you best not wait
Till All Her Tears Are Dry
Chorus
You better run to her and fall on your knees
Swear that you'll be the man
She's wanted you to be
Then by the grace of God
She'll let you lay there by her side
And hold her gently
Till All Her Tears Are Dry
Repeat Chorus
Hold her gently
Till All Her Tears Are Dry
