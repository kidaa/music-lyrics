I taught him how to talk to me
I showed him what a woman needs
A hand just to hold in the dark
He used to think it was enough
Sending flowers to show love
Now he knows he's gotta open his heart
And the saddest thing 'bout how it all came down
Is he's not here with me now

I got him ready for you
Look at all the things he can do
You can cry on his shoulder
He might even cry too
He's come a long long way
And it's tragic but true
I guess I've got him ready for you

I wouldn't say I have regrets
'bout the time that we both spent
If the truth be known, I'm a little better too
So when he does the little things, when he treats you like a queen
In a crazy way I'm bearing the rood
Ooh, I feel like I did all the fixing in mud
But you moved into our house of love

I got him ready for you
Look at all the things he can do
You can cry on his shoulder
He might even cry too
He's come a long long way
And it's tragic but true
I guess I've got him ready for you

I don't blame you, I'm not saying you stole him away from me
I just want you to know he's not the man he used to be, yeah

He's come a long long way
And it's tragic but true
I guess I've got him ready for you
I guess I've got him ready for you
