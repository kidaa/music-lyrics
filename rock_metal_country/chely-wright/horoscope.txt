Every morning AS I START MY DAY
I stop off at Ernie's Corner Stand
He sees me comin' from a half a block away
He's got my mornin' paper in his hand 
He probably thinks I read it for the headlines
Just another never-get-enough news junkie
But I round that corner and in no time
Life section D's in hand
The rest is in a garbage can 
I still read your horoscope
'Cause I can't seem to give up hope
I've got to see what's up with Scorpio
Between that and Capricorn maybe I'll know
What you're goin' through
What I should do
Have you found someone new?
Are you going to? 
Today it said that someone from your past
Would give you a call so well, ";hi";
And if you feel old feelings comin' back
Don't be surprised it said you might
I know you probably think I'm crazy
Puttin' stock in the stars and the constellation
Ooh but ever since I lost you baby
It's the only thing that I can do
To feel like I'm keepin' up with you 
I still read your horoscope
'Cause I can't seem to give up hope
I've got to see what's up with Scorpio
Between that and Capricorn maybe I'll know
What you're goin' through
What I should do
Have you found someone new?
Are you going to?
