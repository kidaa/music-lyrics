It's so nice of you to call
To check on me today
It's ironic 'cause after all
You left me this way

You say you'd feel a whole lot better
If I'd at least pick up the phone
'Cause it scares you when you hear my message
"I'm sorry I'm not home"

I'm on the southside of lonesome
Don't know my way back
I am confused and I am broken
Can't believe it hurts this bad

Yeah the southside of lonesome
It's a little hard to find
But you'll know it when you get here
If you haven't lost your mind

I always did kind of wonder
If we ever were to part
Which one of us would be okay
Which one would fall apart

Well I guess I've got my answer now
It's painful and it's clear
I'm goin' places I have never known
God it's worse than I ever feared

I'm on the southside of lonesome
Don't know my way back
I am confused and I am broken
Can't believe it hurts this bad

Yeah the southside of lonesome
It's a little hard to find
But you'll know it when you get here
If you haven't lost your mind

Yeah you'll know it when you get here
If you haven't lost your mind
