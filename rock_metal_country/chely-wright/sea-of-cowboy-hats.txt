I've been out here seven dances in a row 
Yeah the band's so hot they won't play nothin' slow 
Stetsons and Wrangler jears are floodin' through the door 
And it's sink or swim as soon as you hit the floor 
I'm dancin' in a sea of cowboy hats 
Shoulder to shoulder and back to back 
Two steppin' fools as far as the eye can see 
They're ridin' the wave on that sawdust floor 
Rockin' the boat from shore to shore 
So jump right in cause this is where it's at in the sea of cowboy hats 
Feel free to scrape your boots til they've worn holes 
You won't get too far in here with rubber soles 
Yeah the place is packed and we're puttin' on a show 
In over our heads and caught up in the flow 
I'm dancin' in a sea of cowboy hats 
Shoulder to shoulder and back to back 
Two steppin' fools as far as the eye can see 
They're ridin' the wave on that sawdust floor 
Rockin' the boat from shore to shore 
So jump right in cause this is where it's at in the sea of cowboy hats
