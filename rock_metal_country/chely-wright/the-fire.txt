Track 6 - Time 3:05
He's dating a lawyer with a gentle nature
Says she ain't nothin' like me
And there's fire and there's water
And all I can offer
Is a temperment that he don't need
Well he's making his rounds with the well bred in town
Safe and out of harm
Well he can say what he likes water is nice
But it's fire that keeps you warm
Maybe I'm rough around the edges
And stubborn to a fault
Maybe I'm just a little too hardheaded
Stiff backboned and all
Maybe I'm passionate about being passionate
Say what you like boy water is nice
But it's fire that keeps you warm
Well if you know me you know it's true
And you can quote me if you want to
Maybe I'm rough around the edges
And stubborn to a fault
Maybe I'm just a little too hardheaded
Stiff backboned and all
Maybe I'm passionate about being passionate
Say what you like boy water is nice
But it's fire that keeps you warm
Say what you like
When they all turn to ice
It's the fire that you're gonna want
He's dating a doctor with a gentle nature
Says she ain't nothin' like me
And there's fire and there's water and all I can offer
Is a temperment that he don't need
