All the boys he played cards with 
Couldn't wait til he came 
But they haven't seen him 
Since I got his last name 
He plays at home now 
And he always wins 
Those swingin' doors 
Don't do nothin' for him 
Cause he don't do bars anymore 
That ol' jukebox 
Don't turn him on like before 
We dance to our radio 
On our own hardwood floor 
No he don't do bars anymore 
He used to sit on a barstool 
Keepin' sad company 
Now he lays on the couch 
And he watches TV 
When he's wrapped up in my arms 
He knows what he's found 
So don't bother askin' 
For him to come 'round 
Cause he don't do bars anymore 
That ol' jukebox 
Don't turn him on like before 
We dance to our radio 
On our own hardwood floor 
No he don't do bars anymore 
No he don't do bars anymore
