Chely Wright
They're either fallin' in or they're fallin' out 
That's the only kind of love you ever hear about 
But we're somewhere in between 
And it oughta go down in history 
'Cause love is alive with you and me 
And it's a real good place to be 
'Cause we're right in the middle of it 
Yeah, right in the middle of it 
There's no fireworks and no big bouquets 
No hot romance on display 
But we don't think about breakin' up 
We're right in the middle of love 
Yeah, all our friends wonder how we made it last 
We say we're lookin' at tomorrow and not the past 
No, they're never gonna make a movie 'bout us 
'Cause we don't have a Hollywood love 
The credits roll when a movie is through 
But there ain't gonna be an end to me and you 
'Cause we're right in the middle of it 
Yeah, right in the middle of it 
There's no fireworks and no big bouquets 
No hot romance on display 
But we don't think about breakin' up 
We're right in the middle of love 
We're just right in the middle of love 
We're just right in the middle of love
