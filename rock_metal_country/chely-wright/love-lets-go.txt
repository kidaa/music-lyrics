I can't count the times we've sat and cried
Up all night, trying to work it out
But this feels different than it ever was
This is serious
Are we over now

Everything I've ever learned about love
Baby, I've learned it from us

Love can make you really believe
Love can knock you straight to your knees
Love can make you fight for the things you wanna hold
But sometimes, baby, love lets go

You're the only one who ever thought
That I was strong and I liked it
And I'm the only one you'd ever tell
When you needed help, like I did
I know it hurts you to do this to me
But baby, don't stay where you don't want to be

Love can make you really believe
Love can knock you straight to your knees
Love can make you fight for the things you wanna hold
But sometimes, baby, love lets go

Sometimes, baby, love lets go
