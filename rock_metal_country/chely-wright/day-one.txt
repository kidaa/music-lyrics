Wendell Mobley/Marv Green
Woke up this mornin', put the coffe on 
Opened up the blinds and there was the sun 
Now, this ain't just another day 
It's the hardest one I've ever faced 
Minute by minute, tear by tear 
If I can hang on and just be strong 
Tommorow will be here 
The hurtin' won't end, it's only just begun 
But I'll get over you, if I can make it through 
Day one 
I'll jump head-first into my work 
If I stay busy, maybe it won't hurt 
Anything to forget you're gone 
And keep the time from draggin' on  
Someday I'll look back on it all 
And thank God my heart survived the fall 
Minute by minute, I'll be hangin' on 
But I'll get over you, if I can make it through 
Day one 
Yeah, I'll get over you, if I can only make it through 
Day one
