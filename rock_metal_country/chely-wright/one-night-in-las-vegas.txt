Flight 709 pulled up to the gate
An hour and 45 minutes late
And of course our connection was already in the air
Spent a day of our vacation in Chicago O'Hare
And like musical chairs at the baggage belt
We were the last ones standin' there when nothin' came out
Looking back now on our string of bad luck
That just wasn't our day but you know what?

That one night in Las Vegas
Lyin' there with you
Was well worth everything that you and I went through

And so it goes, our life's been that way
Puttin' out fires, takin' it day by day
And look at this year, it's been our hardest one yet
Just when we thought it had gotten bad as it could get
You got transferred to Denver, I stayed behind
Put the house on the market 'bout went outta my mind
And your dad got sick, I've never seen you so scared
We almost didn't make it through the year

But that weekend in the mountains
In a cabin all by ourselves
Makin' that one memory made up for everything else

Oooh me and my insecurities
You and your stubborn pride
If we've learned anything it's there's no winner when we fight

So this mornin' in our kitchen
After talkin' all night long
We finally stopped tryin' to figure out
Who's right and who is wrong
And when you hold me like you're holdin' me
And I kiss your tired face
We know we took the long way here
But wound up in a better place

Baby one night in Las Vegas
Or one weekend in the mountains
Any moment we're together makes up for everything else
