I talk to him everyday 
Even though he's oh-so-far away 
And every night I lay in bed 
And hug the pillow where he laid his head 
And in my dreams I drift back to that high school kiss 
And the night he put his class ring on my hand 
I see our wedding day and it takes my breath away 
Once again, like it did back then 
I'm living on the love her left me 
And he gave me so much love in such a little time 
And that kind of love is hard to find 
One day we'll meet again in that sweet by-and-by 
But till we're back together 
I'm living on the love he left behind 
Our little boy down the hall 
Is trying to teach me how to play baseball 
Yesterday, I got choked up 
When he said, Mommy, You use daddy's glove 
I turned down a thousand bucks 
For his old pick-up truck 
I'm hangin' on to everything that's part of him 
I'll hold him in my heart 
Till I can hold him in my arms 
Once again 
But till then  
I'm living on the love her left me 
And he gave me so much love in such a little time 
And that kind of love is hard to find 
One day we'll meet again in that sweet by-and-by 
But till we're back together 
I'm living on the love he left behind 
But till we're back together 
I'm living on the love he left behind
