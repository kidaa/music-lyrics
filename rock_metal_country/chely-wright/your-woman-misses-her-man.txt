Ed Hill/Mark D. Sanders/Chely Wright
Track 1 - Time 3:03
Lyin' on my back in a cornfield back in Kansas
I think I might'a had my first original thought
Just me and miles of sky
An occasional crow flyin' by
I believe I saw the light Hank Williams saw
Oh the sky is blue 'cause it misses the stars
And my heart understands
To tell you the truth
I've seen 'bout all the blue that I can stand
Your woman misses her man
Your woman misses her man
Way up there there's an airplane full of people
Way down here I wish I was way up there too
Baby I needed to get away
But, baby I need today
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Oh the sky is blue 'cause it misses the stars
And my heart understands
To tell you the truth
I've seen 'bout all the blue that I can stand
Your woman misses her man
Your woman misses her man
Tonight the sky will hold the stars
And I'll hold you here in my heart
Until I'm back there in your arms again
Oh the sky is blue 'cause it misses the stars
And my heart understands
To tell you the truth
I've seen 'bout all the blue that I can stand
Your woman misses her man
Your woman misses her man
Your woman misses her man
