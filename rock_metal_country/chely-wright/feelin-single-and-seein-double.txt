Track 9 - Time 2:31
Well I really had a ball last night
I held all the pretty boys tight
I was feelin' single seein' double
Wound up in a whole lot of trouble
But today I'll face the big fight but
I really had a ball last night
When I came home from work this mornin'
My baby was feelin' low
And he told me what was on his mind
Then he told me where I could go
Well I didn't want to go where he told me to
'Cause the water was cold in the lake
Now there's somethin' fishy 'bout this whole deal
I don't see where I made my mistake
But I really had a ball last night
I held all the pretty boys tight
I was feelin' single seein' double
Wound up in a whole lot of trouble
But today I'll face the big fight but
I really had a ball last night
When I woke up this mornin'
Like me the sun was high
Well I started walkin' the long way home
Just to think of an alibi
Well I couldn't think of a doggone thing
That hadn't already been said
So I guess I better just play it by ear
For I'm already dead
But I really had a ball last night
I held all the pretty boys tight
I was feelin' single seein' double
Wound up in a whole lot of trouble
And today I'll face the big fight but
I really had a ball last night
But today I'll face the big fight but
I really had a ball last night
