I'm not the first to make you cry
I always promise baby this is the last time
You believe in second chances and I love you for that
But I'm on number ninety-nine and you won't take me back

And I can't say I'm sorry
And I can't swear to God I'm gonna change
And I could tell you I will heal the wounds that cut you down
But you've got scars
And I've got scars
Love goes only so far no matter who you are

I had the chance to change your images of trust
Each time you tried before you got tangled up
I couldn't ease the pain of the hurt you'd had before
But I've got history of my own I only hurt you more

And I can't say I'm sorry
And I can't swear to God I'm gonna change
And I could tell you I will heal the wounds that cut you down
But you've got scars
And I've got scars
Love goes only so far no matter who you are

Oh, our past makes up our present
We never really get a brand new start
So you can take your heart and run
But it's gonna leave a mark

And I can't say I'm sorry
And I can't swear to God I'm gonna change
And I could tell you I will heal the wounds that cut you down
But you've got scars
And I've got scars
Love goes only so far no matter who you are
