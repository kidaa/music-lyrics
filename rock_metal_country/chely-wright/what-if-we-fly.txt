Reasons
We've got a million
To stop taking chances
And start playing it safe
Memories
Of old love can haunt you
I should be scared to death
But I can't walk away 
'Cause what if we fly
What if we fly
And dive off the edge of the end of the world as we know it
What if we fly
Have faith enough to think fate might just know where we're going
What if the arms of the wind carry us to the place
We never could find
Yes we might fall
But what if we fly 
Answers
They don't come easy
I don't know what's wrong anymore
But I know when it's right
Only a dreamer
The truest believer
Can let the chains fall to the ground
And take to the sky 
'Cause what if we fly
What if we fly
And dive off the edge of the end of the world as we know it
What if we fly
Have faith enough to think fate might just know where we're going
What if the arms of the wind carry us to the place
We never could find
Yes we might fall
But what if we fly 
I know we might fall
But what if we fly
