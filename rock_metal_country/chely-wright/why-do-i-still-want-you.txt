Track 10 - Time 4:39
There's an old tear stained, worn King James
Bible on my lab
I can hear mama now say it won't let you down
And it never has
So I turned to the Psalms straight to the one
That I can quote by heart
But the words that used to comfort me
Are tearing me apart
He leadeth me through death's dark valley
And by still waters too
Surely goodness and his mercy
Are gonna pull me through
But tonight I've wrestled with the devil
Wrestled with the truth
If the Lord is my shepherd
And I shall not want
Why do I still want you
All my friends say this will end
You're not the one I need
'Cause I'm the kind that loves for life
And you're the kind that leaves
So I've been praying and I've been waiting
For some kind of peace
But you haven't phoned and I'm leaning on
Old Psalms twenty three
He leadeth me through death's dark valley
And by still waters too
Surely goodness and his mercy
Are gonna pull me through
But tonight I've wrestled with the devil
Wrestled with the truth
If the Lord is my shepherd
And I shall not want
Why do I still want you
Yeah tonight I've wrestled with the devil
Wrestled with the truth
If the Lord is my shepherd
And I shall not want
Why do I still want you
