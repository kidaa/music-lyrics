The clock is ticking loud as thunder
In this silent room
The morning comes and I wait to see
If it dawns on you
That I can't make what little love you give me
Be enough
And I'm just a tick away from giving up

[Chorus:]

But it's not too late for you
To turn this thing around
And say the words to keep me here
But do it now
'Cause love is slipping through our hands
One moment at a time
But it's not too late
For you to change my mind

The rings we're wearing on our hands
Are made of the purest gold
But what we're doing to each other
Is getting old
And now, the pedestal I've put you on
Is crumbling, too
But it's in your power to make it good as new

[Chorus]

The clock is ticking loud as thunder
In this silent room
But it's not too late
For you to change

It's not too late for you to change my mind
It's not too late for you to change my mind
