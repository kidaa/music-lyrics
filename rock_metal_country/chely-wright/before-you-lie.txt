Track 8 - Time 3:52
I think I know what you're about to say
I can see it in your eyes and on your face
We swore we never would
So while the words are still unspoken
Don't you think you should
Take a breath
Take a moment
Take your time
Before you lie
'Cause once you do
Love is different
Everything changes
Between you and I
And it gets easier every time
Oh and you can still change your mind
Before you lie
All I ask of you is honesty
We said that's how this love will always be
So careful what you say
'Cause it only takes a half a truth
To throw it all away
Take a breath
Take a moment
Take your time
Before you lie
'Cause once you do
Love is different
Everything changes
Between you and I
And it gets easier every time
Oh and you can still change your mind
Before you lie
It's up to you
This can go go either way
You get to choose
Which road we take
So
Take a breath
Take a moment
Take your time
Before you lie
'Cause once you do
Love is different
Everything changes
Between you and I
And it gets easier every time
Oh and you can still change your mind
Before you lie
Before you lie
Before you lie
