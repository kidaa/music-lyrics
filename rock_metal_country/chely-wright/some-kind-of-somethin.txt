I wouldn't bet the farm on it yet
But I find myself on this dangerous ledge
Don't know if I'm fallin'
Don't know what to call it
But it's just like a red, red wine
Goin' to my head
It's

[Chorus:]

Some kind of somethin'
I've never seen nothin'
That made me feel like this
It's too soon to say forever
But we're only sayin' never
Love's a definite maybe when we kiss
And I've been passin' up every what if
For some kind of something like this

You're like the place between sleep and awake
When dreams still feel real and you just wanna stay
There with your eyes closed
There where the heart knows
Anything can happen
It doesn't need a name
It's just

[Repeat chorus]

Ooo you're underneath my skin
Ooo that's how love begins
With some kind of somethin' like this

[Repeat chorus]

Some kind of somethin' like this
Some kind of somethin' like this
