Kenya Walker/Nick Pellegrino
Track 10 - Time 4:14
People say I care too much
I'm so emotional
A tender soul who's out of control
I've been told a heart like mine
Is truly valuable
Worth even more than diamonds and gold
I'm overloaded with love
I've been saving up
For someone else who can't get enough
I must have a 10 lb. heart
A ton of devotion
And gallons of tears
An old flame still burnin'
From my 19th year
Exploding with passion
And raging romance
Urging me constantly to take one more chance
And let this love inside of me start
Flowing from my 10 lb. heart
I need someone adventurous
This is serious
The timid hearted need not apply
Faithful and available
With some experience
In handling a heavy desire
So now if I've described you
And you need someone who
Can share your dreams and make them come true
Look inside my 10 lb. heart
A ton of devotion
And gallons of tears
An old flame still burnin'
From my 19th year
Exploding with passion
And raging romance
Urging me constantly to take one more chance
And let this love inside of me start
Flowing from my 10 lb. heart
A ton of devotion
And gallons of tears
An old flame still burnin'
From my 19th year
Exploding with passion
And raging romance
Begging me constantly to take one more chance
And let this love inside of me start
Flowing from my 10 lb. heart
Please won't you help this love inside of me start
Flowing from my 10 lb. heart
