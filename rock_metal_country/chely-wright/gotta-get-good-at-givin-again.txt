They married young, right out of school
Back in '78
She rubbed his back, he rubbed her feet
After a long, hard day

Now they're livin' in Beverly Hills
And it's all turned upside-down
He gets a weekly massage, she gets a pedicure
On different sides of town

And they both know they've gotten far
From the way they used to be
She wakes him up in the middle of the night
And cries, baby, listen to me

[Chorus:]

We gotta get good at givin' again
If we wanna have a life like we did back then
We've got a second change to let someone in
Hey, we gotta get good at givin' again
We gotta get good at givin' again

A little girl walks in the park
Holdin' hands with her daddy's mom
She wants to know why that man is asleep
On the bench with the dirty clothes on

Grandma tells the innocent child
It hasn't always been this way
She slips a ten dollar bill in his shopping cart
And whispers, mister, have a good day

[Chorus]

It oughta tell us something
When the ones we should be lovin'
Ain't getting what they need
Don't be afraid to make the first move
Take the lead

[Chorus]

Hey, we gotta get good at givin' again
We gotta get good at givin' again
