There are times I stand in wonder
To look at you and all you are
And I think I can unlock the mystery
Break through your walls and win your heart
I don't mean to scare you
There's no need to be afraid
We can take our time
But I'll take my chance and say

[Chorus:]

Let me love you really love you
Open up your heart and let me in
I don't know who taught you not to trust
I'll be constant as the sun that shines above
Close your eyes and take the fall
If it's really love there's no risk at all
I can love you if you'll only let me in

I see your strength and how you shine
You're a diamand in the rough that should be mine
But you're still fighting an old war
That's left you wounded and left you scarred
You hide your weakness
Behind those walls
You think it's your own secret
But in your eyes I see it all

Let me love you really love you
Open up your heart and let me in
I don't know who taught you not to trust
I'll be constant as the sun that shines above
Close your eyes and take the fall
If it's really love there's no risk at all
Lay down your past and then you can begin
To let me love you really love you
I can love you if you'll only let me in
I can love you if you'll only let me in
