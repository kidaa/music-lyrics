I guess we guess our way through life
How many times do we really know for sure
I was just hoping for the best
Then I woke up in those lovin' arms of yours
What I felt was unmistakable
When I fell for you
It was real...it was magic
It was calm...it was savage
It was cool as a breeze
It was warm to the touch
It was never enough
It was always too much
It did all the things love does
That's how I knew
It was
Who thought that I could laugh so loud
Then turn and cry so many tears
I used to have so many doubts
But one by one you made them disappear
What I found was unbelievable
But I believe it's true
It was real...it was magic
It was calm...it was savage
It was cool as a breeze
It was warm to the touch
It was never enough
It was always too much
It did all things love does
That's how I knew
It was
You asked what I felt when you walked through the door
Was it fear?
Was it clear?
It was all that and more
It was real...it was magic
It was calm...it was savage
It was cool as a breeze
It was warm to the touch
It was never enough
It was always too much
It did all the things love does
That's how I knew
It was
It was
That's how I knew
It was
It was
It was
