I never really partied a lot
Steamed up a few windows, kissing in cars
And that's as dangerous as I got
Didn't drink, didn't smoke
Did I think I could go through this world
Pure as an angel
A girl guarded from danger

It wasn't a lucky strike
Or a different lover every night
Or a heavy metal song that made the warnings come true
There's no whiskey hard enough to do the damage that you've done
By packing up and leaving like you said you'd never do
It wasn't sex, drugs, and rock and roll that got me
It was you, it was you, it was you

I should have been living it up
But I was little miss perfect and still ended up here
Well, I would have had a whole lot more fun
Than this mess that you see
Well, I guess it would be my own bed
That I'd have to lie in
But instead you left me crying

It wasn't a lucky strike
Or a different lover everynight
Or a heavy metal song that made the warnings come true
There's no whiskey hard enough to do the damage that you've done
By packing up and leaving like you said you'd never do
It wasn't sex, drugs, and rock and roll that got me
It was you, it was you, it was you

There's no whiskey hard enough to do the damage that you've done
By packing up and leaving like you said you'd never do
It wasn't sex, drugs, and rock and roll that killed me
It was you, it was you, it was you
It was you, it was you, it was you
