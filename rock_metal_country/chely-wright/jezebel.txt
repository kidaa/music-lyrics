I give him love the best I can
But you don't seem to understand
It's not always deep
But it's always true
And he does not belong to you

Hey I do not forgive and I do not forget
I will fight for love until the death

[Chorus:]

Jezebel, save your charms
He'll be back here in my arms
Oh how quickly you forget
He is not yours yet
He is not yours not yet

Gonna throw on this cotton dress
Put lilac scent on the back of my neck
Walk barefoot down that mountainside
Straight to your door girl you can't hide

'Cause I do not forgive and I do not forget
I will fight for love until the death

[Chorus]

Standing out in the pourin' rain
Callin' out my lover's name
I know he won't leave me in the cold
Send my baby home
Send my baby home

[Chorus]
