It breaks my hear to see 
That you're unhappy here with me 
The hurt you've tried to hide can't help but show 
I could cling to the past 
But I'm afraid it wouldn't last 
And I love you enough to let you go 
Don't think that I'm all through 
Or that I'm givin' up on you 
Our love's the most important thing I know 
But if I set you free 
It just might bring you back to me 
And I love you enough to let you go 
I'll stand and hold the door 
And watch you walk away 
And welcome you back with open arms 
If you come back someday 
But for now it would be wrong 
To keep tryin' to hold on 
And I love you enough to let you go 
I'll stand and hold the door 
And watch you walk away 
And welcome you back with open arms 
If you come back someday 
But for now it would be wrong 
To keep tryin' to hold on 
And I love you enough to let you go
