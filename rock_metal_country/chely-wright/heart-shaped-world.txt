Columbus said the world was round 
Back when everyone said it was flat 
Just between me and you and the man in the moon 
Baby, it ain't anything like that 
'Cause were living in a heart shaped world 
Our head in the clouds, but our feet on the ground 
Yeah, we're living in a heart shaped world 
Don't you know baby, love makes the world go 'round 
Now, satellite pictures sent back to earth 
Shows a big, blue ball floatin out in space 
We've got a vision, yeah, and we're on a mission 
To tell the whole planet it ain't that way 
'Cause were living in a heart shaped world 
Our head in the clouds, but our feet on the ground 
Yeah, we're living in a heart shaped world 
Don't you know baby, love makes the world go 'round 
Don't you know baby, love makes the world go 
Don't you know baby, love makes the world go 'round
