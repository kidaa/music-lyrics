I spent all day long just slavin' in the kitchen
I wanted everything to be just right
Yeah, the table's dressed with all the fancy trimmin's
Won't he be surprised when he comes home tonight

Well, it's half past five but there's no need to worry
There's still lots of time after all he's always late
When he's out with her he's never in a hurry
So, I light a lonely candle and set his plate

Cause tonight he's comin' home to the last supper
He'll break the bread and drink his wine alone
I know God will forgive me
Cause he knows how much I've suffered
Lord, I'd like to have a picture of the last supper
