Wendell Mobley/Stephany Delray
He was a rebel she was born across the tracks
Her parents had his never did
To look at them it didn't fit
Everyone whispered ain't it weird him with her
It'll never work that's what they said
But to this day he takes away her breath 
Love didn't listen
It only hears what it wants to hear
Two hearts beating as one
The odds were against 'em
Oh but they had something on their side
When doubt said it can't be done
Love didn't listen 
Married one summer and it was heaven seven years
Yeah, there were tears but no big deal
They just kept rollin' up love's hill
Then one night it happened, bitter words, slammin' doors
She said divorce he said me too
But even though it sounded like the thing to do 
Love didn't listen
It only hears what it wants to hear
Two hearts beating as one
The odds were against 'em
Oh but they had something on their side
When doubt said it can't be done
Love didn't listen 
It was an obstacle course
Had every negative force
Tellin' them they'll never make it but 
Love didn't listen
It only hears what it wants to hear
Two hearts beating as one
The odds were against 'em
Oh but they had something on their side
When doubt said it can't be done
Love didn't listen
