Ed Hill/Mark D. Sanders
Track 6 - Time 2:41
I'm fallin' head over heals for him
He's callin' me twice a night then callin' again
When I talk he likes to listen
He says I'm the one that he's been missin'
Somebody tell me that he isn't
Just another heartache
Just another heartache
Another bad lie another goodbye
Lookin' for another heart to break
Maybe I'm too cautious for my own good
Maybe he's the real deal knock on wood
All I know is he'll be here in a minute
I hope it's love and I hope he's in it
I'll be over my limit with
Just another heartache
Just another heartache
Another bad lie another goodbye
Lookin' for another heart to break
This better be somethin' more
I wanna be sure that I'm not fallin'
I'm not fallin' for
Just another heartache
Just another heartache
Another bad lie another goodbye lookin' for a
Just another heartache just another heartache
Another bad lie another goodbye lookin' for another heart
Another bad lie another goodbye lookin' for another 
Heart to break
