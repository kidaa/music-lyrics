Track 7 - Time 3:00
It's been a long time comin'
I've been alone so long
My heart is doin' somethin'
Can't put my finger on
I feel it when you touch me
I see it in your eyes
I get the feelin' we're fallin'
Fallin' side by side
Is it love yet
Is it real
'Cause ya know I love the way you make me feel
Oh we took our chance
We took our time
And if it's love boy I won't mind
I'll take all I can get
Is it love yet
My mamma always told me
You'll know when love is true
Sometimes when you're not lookin'
It's sneakin' up on you
Is it love yet
Is it real
'Cause ya know I love the way you make me feel
Oh we took our chance
We took our time
And if it's love boy I won't mind
I'll take all I can get
Is it love 
Is it love yet
Is it real
'Cause ya know I love the way you make me feel
Oh we took our chance
We took our time
And if it's love boy I won't mind
I'll take all I can get
Is it love yet
