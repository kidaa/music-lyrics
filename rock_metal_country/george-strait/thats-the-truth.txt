I said I don't love you, and I ain't never been your fool
That's a lie, and that's the truth
And if it's over makes no difference if we're through.
That's a lie, and that's the truth
Chorus:
I said go on, I'll be just fine
I won't fall apart, or go out of my mind
I said no one could break my heart
But you're living proof
That's a lie, and that's the truth
I don't mind the darkness alone in this room
That's a lie, and that's the truth
I like bein' lonely, yeah, I ain't missin' you
That's a lie, and that's the truth
Repeat Chorus
And if you find somebody
Who says they love you more than I do
That's a lie, and that's the truth
