Well I was out a drinkin' 
With a couple of friends of mine
When the bartender handed me the telephone
Says ";There's a wife on the line.";
I told her I was just a drinkin'
With a couple of buddies I knew
She told me in a few short words 
Just a what she wanted me to do 
She said ";Oh won't you come home and talk to a stranger.
Cause you might even make yourself a friend.";
She said ";Won't you come home and talk to a stranger.
It's the only place in days you haven't been."; 
Well I sat there about an hour
Talkin' with the rest of the guys
When she walked through that front door
She had ";Get home"; in her eyes
She said ";You've danced and talked
With every woman in town but me.
And if you'd just come around the house
You might like my company."; 
She said ";Oh won't you come home and talk to a stranger.
Cause you might even make yourself a friend.";
She said ";Won't you come home and talk to a stranger.
It's the only place in days you haven't been."; 
She said ";Oh won't you come home and talk to a stranger.
Cause you might even make yourself a friend.";
She said ";Won't you come home and talk to a stranger.
It's the only place in days you haven't been.";
