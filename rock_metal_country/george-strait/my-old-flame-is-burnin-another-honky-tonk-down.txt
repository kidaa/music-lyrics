Just a one pump fil-in station
Lord and one old general store
I found her in that wide spot in the road
And the brightest lights she'd ever seen 
Were the headlights on my pickup
Till she saw the lights behind those swinging doors
And everywhere she goes
She leaves the jukebox smoking
Everywhere she's been
There's ashes on the ground
I see the glow in the sky 
Through the teardrops in my eyes
My old flame's out burning
Another honky tonk down
So country, young and pretty
She's never been no where before
And I lost her behind those swinging doors
Now it's just me and my old pickup
Making every joint in town
Cuz tonight she's out somewhere to burn one down
And everywhere she goes
She leaves the jukebox smoking
Everywhere she's been 
There's ashes on the ground
I see the glow in the sky
Through the teardrops in my eyes
My old flame's out burning
Another honky tonk down
My old flame's out burning
Another honky tonk down
