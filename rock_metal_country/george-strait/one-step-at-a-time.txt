I couldn't help but overhear your conversation
When you told her that you owned her heart and soul
You say you've got her wrapped around your finger
But there's something about angels you should know
She'll walk away one step at a time
It'll take you by surprise
you'll think it happened over night
It'll be too late when you realize
Angels don't fly
They just walk away one step at a time
Don't think that I'm trying to mind your business
it's a full time job just trying to mind mine
But I once had an angel just like her
And if I'd treated her right
She'd still be by my side
She'll walk away one step at a time
It'll take you by surprise
you'll think it happened over night
It'll be too late when you realize
Angels don't fly
They just walk away one step at a time
It'll be too late when you realize
Angels don't fly
They just walk away one step at a time
