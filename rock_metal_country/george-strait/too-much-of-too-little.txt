Well here we sit at a table for two
But bottle there's just me and you
She loved me so but I loved her so wrong
I gave her too much of too little too long
So tell me bottle are the things I hear true
That all the answers are in the bottle of you
I need your help this memory's so strong
I gave her too much of too little too long
Sometimes a man can get lost in a world of his own
He'll neglect his real world who's waiting at home
A woman needs her man's love to lean on
I gave her too much of too little too long
I gave her too much of too little too long
