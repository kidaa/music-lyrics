Well I haven't seen her lately
And she never calls
She don't ask my friends about me
Gives no clues at all
That a fire might still be burnin', yeah
I'd say she's about as gone as a girl can get
She don't even show up in my dreams at night
But my stubborn old memory keeps holdin' on tight
Sure makes it hard to forget
She's about as gone as a girl can get
Chorus:
She's out of here
She disappeared without a trace
More or less unimpressed
By the tears on my face
Destination unknown
She just dropped out of sight
Last seen headin' right on out of my life
Like a stranger I ain't never met
She's about as gone as a girl can get
Repeat chorus
Like a stranger I ain't never met
Well I'd say she's about as gone as a girl can get
