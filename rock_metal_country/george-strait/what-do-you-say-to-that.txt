You're like the warm sunshine
I think of you all the time
I've fallen for you and that's a fact
What do yu say to that
You're always in my dreams
I think you know what they mean
My heart knows this is real at last
What do you say to that
chorus:
Life could never be the same without you
Love was never really love without you
Here beside you is really where it's at
What do you say to that
I promis I'll never leave
I'll aways want with me
Loving you won't ever be old hat
What do you say to that
repeat chorus
You're like the warm sunshine
I think of you all the time
I've fallen for you and that's a fact
What do you say to that
My heart knows this is real at last
What do you say to that
