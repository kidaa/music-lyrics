Chorus:
You're right, I'm wrong
I'm here, you're gone
Now I'm the one to blame
That our loves at an end
I lied, you cried
I died inside
Now I'll do anything
To get you back again
Step by step, night after night
I walk the floor till morning light
Your leaving words still haunt my mind
Cause I'm the fool who made you say goodbye
Chorus
Day by day, time after time
I did not see the warning signs
Now my beating heart keeps telling me
It hurts to know that I caused you to leave
Chorus
Yes I'll do anything to get you back again
