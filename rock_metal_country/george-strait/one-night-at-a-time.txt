I'm not yours and baby you're not mine
We've got somethin' and it sure is fine
Let's take our love one night at a time
There's one thing that we both agree
I like you and baby you like me
Let's take our love one night at a time 
All night, love all night, practice makes perfect, 
gonna get it right, gonna get it right, one night at a time
All night, love all night, practice makes perfect,
gonna get it right, gonna get it right, one night at a time 
Oh I think about you all day long
It feels so good it can't be wrong
I've got my fingers crossed that this goes on and on
Tomorrow, well, that's another day,
Come on baby, now what do you say
Lets take our love one night at a time 
All night, love all night, practice makes perfect,
gonna get it right, gonna get it right, one night at a time 
instrumental break 
Oh I think about you all day long
It feels so good it can't be wrong,
I've got my fingers crossed that this goes on and on 
All night, love all night, practice makes perfect, gonna get it right
Gonna get it right, one night at a time
All night, love all night, practice makes perfect,
Gonna get it right, gonna get it right, one night at a time
All night, love all night, practice makes perfect,
Gonna get it right, gonna get it right, one night at a time
