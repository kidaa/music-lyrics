Well her old friend, from her own end of town dropped by today, 
And way down deep inside me something died 
When he came 'round to see her that way. 
Here it comes again, that same old chilly wind 
Will blow like a cold winter squall. 
And I'll begin to feel the chill of an early fall. 
And I'll be drinking again and thinking whenever he calls, 
There's a storm coming on, it won't be too long till the snow falls. 
Oh I'll be sobersome, 
But when October comes and goes and no time at all 
I'll begin to feel the chill of an early fall. 
Oh how quick they slip away, here today and gone tomorrow. 
Love and seasons never stay, bitter winds are sure to follow. 
Now there's no doubt, it's gonna be cold out tonight; 
I've shivered all day, and when I look in her eyes 
Needing to hold her so tight, she just looks away. 
Oh she'll swear that it's true, he's just someone she knew 
Long ago, and I'll know that's not all, 
And I'll begin to feel the chill of an early fall. 
Oh I'll begin to feel the chill of an early fall.
