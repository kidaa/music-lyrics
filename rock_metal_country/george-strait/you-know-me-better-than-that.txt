Baby since you left me I've found someone new
She thinks I'm perfect I swear
SHe likes my body, my class, and my charm
She says I've got a confident air
She respects my ambition, thinks I'm talented too
But she's in love with an image time is bound to see through
Chorus:
You know me better than that
You know the me that gets lazy an fat
How moody I can be
All my insecurities
You've seen me lose all my charm
You know I was raised on a farm
Oh she tells her I'm perfect
And that I love her cat
But you know me better than that
I miss picnics and blue jeans and buckets of beer
Now it's ballet and symphony hall
I'm in culture clean up to my ears
It's like wearn' a shoe that's too small
Oh I caught her with an issue of brides magazine
Starin' at dresses and pickin' out rings
Repeat Chorus
Oh she tells her friends I'm perfect
And that I love that cat
Oh, but you know me better than that
