Oh I know a place called Good Time Charley's
A little four piece band swingin' out of sight
And I'll be here if you want to party
From nine in the morning 'til twelve at night
Two miles from town 'cross the railroad track
Turn right at the light and park in the back
You're always welcome don't forget to drop in
Old Charley done time two years in the pen
Well the beat goes on there's a hardwood floor
And the sound of laughter runnin' out the door
Wall to wall women plenty of ice-cold beer
And thing you're after you can find it here
Two miles from town 'cross the railroad track
Turn right at the light and park in the back
You're always welcome don't forget to drop in
Old Charley done time two years in the pen
