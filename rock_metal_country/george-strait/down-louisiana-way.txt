[chorus]
I'm goin' down Louisiana way
I'm going back as of this very day
Don't worry about me cause I'll be okay
I'm goin' down Louisiana way
I will miss all my old Chicago friends
And think about you San Francisco now and then
I will remember my compadres in L.A.
Look me up down Louisiana way
[chorus]
Don't let your eyes get misty now
We knew the time would come around for me to go
I will miss you
So long friend, quess I'll see you while ago
I might be back sometime, you just never know
I have left a sweetheart north of Whiskey Bay
True love waits down Louisiana way
