She knows she's holdin' someone who don't love her
She knows she's where you could have been
She knows I turn to her because you turned me down
And she knows when you're on my mind again
Every night she opens up the door to heaven
But when you're on my mind I can't go in
And you come runnin' through my mind and I let my memory chase you
She knows when you're on my mind again
Sometimes late at night I hear her crying
She turns to me but you won't let her in
She knows the door is locked but she keeps trying
She knows when you're on my mind again
Every night she opens up the door to heaven
But when you're on my mind I can't go in
And you come runnin' through my mind and I let my memory chase you
She knows when you're on my mind again
