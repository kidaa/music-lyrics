We said goodbye
In Marina Del Rey
";I had a good time";
Was the last thing I heard her say
As I walked away
And on this plane back to Tennessee
My mind comes across her memory
And yesterday
In Marina Del Rey
Chorus:
On a hidden beach under a golden sun
She spread a blanket 
That we laid down on and loved the world away
In Marina Del Rey
And as we looked into each other's eyes
We found our body's lost in paradise
Like castaways
In Marina Del Rey
Like the ocean tides
High and lows
Love sometimes comes and goes away
In Marina Del Rey
And as this plane is touching down
Tears touch my eyes for I have found
My heart has stayed
In Marina Del Rey
Chorus
