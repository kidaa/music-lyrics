Haven't you heard
Haven't you heard
Daddy's gone crazy
Haven't you heard momma is gone
Here I stand with my finger on his door bell
My mind goes back to what I did last night,
You see I finally talked his wife into leaving him
And I am just here to convince my conscious that its all alright
And I can see my old friend just sitting there staring at his little boy
Crying words are welded in my mind,
Haven't you heard
Daddy's gone crazy
Haven't you heard momma is gone
And either way I'm a loser
And I've been crying all night long
MR. haven't you heard
Daddy's gone crazy
Haven't you heard momma is gone
And either way I'm a loser
And I've been crying all night long
MR. haven't you heard.
