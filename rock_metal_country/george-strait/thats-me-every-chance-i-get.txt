Picture a fellow with his boots shined up
A new coat of clean on his pick-up truck
Ringin' your doorbell, thinkin' about love
Hey honey that's me! 
That's me with a capital M
That's me ten times ten
Ain't worked up my courage yet
But that's me every chance I get! 
Picture a fellow at a picture show
His arm around you in the very last row
Stealin' a kiss as the credits roll
Yeah honey that's me! 
That's me with a capital M
That's me ten times ten
Ain't worked up my courage yet
But that's me every chance I get! 
Ah, play it boys! 
I never dealt with such a big deal
How to tell ya how I feel
I'll be your fellow in nothin' flat
Honey just picture that! 
That's me with a capital M
That's me ten times ten
Ain't worked up my courage yet
But that's me every chance I get! 
That's me with a capital M
That's me ten times ten
Ain't worked up my courage yet
But that's me every chance I get! 
Yeah that's me every chance I get.
Honey that's me every chance I get.
