Chorus:
I got a feelin' called the blues
Oh lord since my baby said goodbye
Hey Lord I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sit and sigh 
Oh Lord, The last long day she said goodbye
Hey Lord I thought I would cry
She'll do me 
She'll do you
She's got that kind of lovin'
and lord I love to hear her
when she calls me sweat daddy
Such a beautiful dream
I hate to think it's all over
I lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to you somehow
lord I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
I'm lonesome
I got the lovesick blues
Hey I'm in love 
I'm in love with a beautiful gal
that's whats the matter with me
Hey I'm in love
I'm in love with a beautiful gal 
but she don't care about me
Hey Lord I tried and I tried
to keep her satisfied
but that gal wouldn't stay
and now that she is leavin'
this is all I can say
