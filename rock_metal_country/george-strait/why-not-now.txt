You take it nice and easy
You play it safe 'cause that's what people do today
I guess that's ok
Girl somewhere in your mind
There must be a perfect time to fall in love
But baby I'm burnin' up
So why not now, why not here
Darlin' my heart just ain't too clear
Oh what are we waitin' for
'Cause I've never been so sure
Why not you, why not me
Livin' like we were meant to be
Together, forever
Why not now
Right here in this moment
We could start a love to stand the test of time
Baby you know that's right
No one knows tomorrow
The mornin' sun could rise and take our chance away
Long gone with yesterday...........so
So why not now, why not here
Darlin' my heart just ain't too clear
Oh what are we waitin' for
'Cause I've never been so sure
Why not you, why not me
Livin' like we were meant to be
Together, forever
Why not now
So why not now, why not here
Darlin' my heart just ain't too clear
Oh what are we waitin' for
'Cause I've never been so sure
Why not you, why not me
Livin' like we were meant to be
Together, forever
Why not now
So why not now, why not here
Darlin' my heart just ain't too clear
Oh what are we waitin' for
'Cause I've never been so sure
Why not you, why not me
Livin' like we were meant to be
Together, forever
Why not now
