Without a warning
You're out of control
The ground shakes and the ocean rolls
this is the big one
There's nowhere to run
On the Richter scale of a romance
You hit twelve and you don't stand a chance
This is the big one
I'm falling in love
Chorus:
Now it's beat, beat, beat
My heart's sending out a message
Please, please, please
Don't save me tonight
S.O.S. in this situation means
She's out of sight
No need to panic
I tell myself
But I've never felt this feeling
With anybody else
So, this is the big one
I'm falling in love
Chorus
This is the big one
I'm falling in love
