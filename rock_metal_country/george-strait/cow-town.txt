C'mon along and we'll go down
To a place in Texas called Cow Town
You'll never meet a stranger there
Ev'rybody knows if you're in town
Chorus:
They'll meet you with a smile and a
'Howdy, How you all' and just a little while
You'll get that Texas drawl
The hats are wide and the boots are brown
You'll just love this place called Cow Town
No matter where I may wonder 
No matter where I may roam
There's a place way down yonder
I'm goin there and make it my home 
C'mon along and we'll go down
To a place in Texas called Cow Town 
You'll never meet a stranger there
Ev'rybody knows if you're in town
Repeat Chorus
You'll just love this place called Cow Town
