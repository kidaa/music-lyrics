When did you stop loving me
How long have I been a memory
I've got to know for my own sanity
Tell me when did you stop loving me
Was it that night that you stayed out until dawn
You know that night has haunted me for so long
Or was your love already cold
Tell me please I've got to know
Darling, when did you stop loving me
There was a time when you worshiped where I stood
Heaven knows I'd bring it back if I could
I can tell when we make love
It aint me you're thinking of
Tell me when did you stop loving me
Darling, when did you stop loving me
