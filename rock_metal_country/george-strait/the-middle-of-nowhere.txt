Way out here you can see for miles
If there was anything to be seen
Maybe I could tell the difference between
Where I am and where I've been
So if I stare off in the distance sometimes
And get that far away look in my eye
It's that my baby went and left me out there
All alone in the middle of nowhere
Way out in the middle of nowhere
Oh nobody wants to go there
My baby's gone and she don't care
That I'm out here in the middle of nowhere
Standin' at the edge of the sky
On top of a mountain so tall
Wishing to God I could fly
When I ain't even done climbing the wall
Could you help me let the teardrops roll
Awe anything to cleanse my soul
Or if you've got a single raindrop to spare
Lord I'm out in the middle of nowhere
Way out in the middle of nowhere
Oh nobody wants to go there
My baby's gone and she don't care
That I'm out here in the middle of nowhere
