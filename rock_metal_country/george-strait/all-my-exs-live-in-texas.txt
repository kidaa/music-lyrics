Chorus:
All my ex's live in Texas
and Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be
but all my ex's live in Texas
and that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee
Rosanna's down in Texarkana
wanted me to push her broom
Sweet Eileens in Abilene
She forgot I hung the moon
and Allisons in Galveston
somehow lost her sanity
and Dimples who now lives in Temple's
got the law looking for me
Chorus
I remember that old Frio River
where I learned to swim
but it brings to mind another time
where I wore my welcome thin
By transcendental meditation
I go there each night
but I always come back to myself
long before daylight
All my ex's live in Texas
and Texas is the place Id dearly love to be
but all my ex's live in Texas
therefore I reside in Tennessee
Some folks think I'm hidin'
It's been rumored that I died
but I'm alive and well in Tennessee
