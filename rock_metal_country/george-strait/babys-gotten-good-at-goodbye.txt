What a rotten day
This turned out to be
I still can't believe
She'd leave so easily
She just packed all her things
Threw them into a pile
Then she loaded her car
And said, ";After awhile";
She'd done this before
But this time she didn't cry
Chorus:
That's why I'm sitting on the front steps
Staring down the road
Wondering if she'll come back
This time I don't know
And after she packed
When she looked back
There were no tears in her eyes
And that's got me worried 
Thinking maybe my baby's
Gotten good at goodbye
All the times before
She'd break down and cry
She'd make her threats
But her heart wasn't set on goodbye
She just wanted me to hear
What she had to say
Now I'm lost for words
Since she went away
She may not return
For this time she didn't cry
Chorus
Chorus
