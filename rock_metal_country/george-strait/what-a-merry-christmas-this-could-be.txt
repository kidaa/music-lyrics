[chorus]
What a merry Christmas this could be
If you would just come back to me
And say that you've forgiven me
What a merry Christmas this could be
It was just last Christmas that we quarreled
I knew I was wrong but you'd come back I had not doubt
Now a year has rolled around this Christmas once again
And what I'd give if you'd come walkin' in
[chorus]
[chorus]
What a merry Christmas this could be
