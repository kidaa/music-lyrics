Chorus:
Adalida, pretty little cajun queen
Sweet dixie flower, the belle of the bayou
You're every young man's dream
Adalida, I'd walk through a hurricane
To stand beside you sweet Adalida
I'd swim the Pontchartrain
Oh no, here you comin' down the road
With your cotton dress a swishin', you gettin' some attention
From all the boys in the Thibodaux
Oh my your really feelin' up their eyes
Smilin' and a winkin', I know what they're thinkin'
But I'm the only one who loves you so!
Repeat Chorus
Oh no, the hottest little dish I know
I know you can tell it, you makin' me so jealous
From my head down to my toes
Oh me you could make a redneck green
The way that you're a lookin', you got me cookin'
And I ain't talkin' 'bout Etoufee'
