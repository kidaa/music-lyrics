The laughter is gone
The crying' is over
And I'm not losin' sleep anymore
The walls are all bare
The closet's half empty
The phone doesn't ring like before
I'm done with fallin' apart
I' waitin' for my change of heart
I wake up alone
Knowin' I'm on my own again
Got it all straight in my head
Must be somethin' I missed
As I went down the list
Of the things that I need to forget
Everything's gone
But you haven't left me yet
I painted our room
Replaced all the curtains
And there's a new rug on the floor
Called up the Good Will
Said come and get it
Everything she left behind is yours
I can still see you drivin' away
So why do I still see your face
When.........
I wake up alone
Knowin' I'm on my own again
Got it all straight in my head
Must be somethin' I missed
As I went down the list
Of the things that I need to forget
Everything's gone
But you haven't left me yet
There's not a picture left
Not a stitch of clothes
But there's still something here
And I don't believe in ghosts
I wake up alone
Knowin' I'm on my own again
Got it all straight in my head
Must be somethin' I missed
As I went down the list
Of the things that I need to forget
Everything's gone
But you haven't left me yet
I wake up alone
Knowin' I'm on my own again
Got it all straight in my head
Must be somethin' I missed
As I went down the list
Of the things that I need to forget
Everything's gone
But you haven't left me yet
