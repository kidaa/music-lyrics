Merle Haggard/Terry Gordon
My life's been grand
I been a hand at livin' it up all the way
I've had good times and bad times and hard times and done time
But life's been a blessing every day
My life's been grand
You know I'd write home and tell 'em 
But they wouldn't believe how good my luck's been
And if it ended today I've been all the way
My life's been grand
My life's been grand
