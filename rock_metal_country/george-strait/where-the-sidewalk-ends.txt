Where the sidewalk ends
and the road begins
We said good bye
on a cold dark night
I'm not afraid to go
you bet I'm not
Where the sidewalk ends
you left a lot
Some people leave
and never come back
Some stay in touch
Some loose track
Your mind kept sayin'
come on let's go
You started learnin'
what you don't need to know
Where the sidewalk ends
and the road begins
I'll wait for you
in the cold dark night
You might come back
You had to go
Where the sidewalk ends
I'll never know
Hide from the future
run from the past
I guess I'll stay here
as long as I can last
Whistle still blowin'
but the train is gone
Ain't no wheels
gonna take me from my home
Where the sidewalk ends
and the road begins
We said good bye
on a cold dark night
I'm not afraid to go
you bet I'm not
Where the sidewalk ends
you left a lot
I'm not afraid to go
you bet I'm not
Where the sidewalk ends
you left a lot
Where the sidewalk ends
and the road begins
We said good bye
on a cold dark night
I'm not afraid to go
you bet I'm not
Where the sidewalk ends
you left a lot
Where the sidewalk ends
you left a lot
Where the sidewalk ends
