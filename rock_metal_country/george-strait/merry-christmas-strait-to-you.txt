It's Christmas time
I see the lines of people everywhere
Tryin' to pick out the gifts
That show how much they care
It makes me wish that I could see my friends
On Christmas Day
And fill my list with lots of gifts
But I can only say
[chorus]
Here comes a merry Chritmas strait to you
I hope it cheers you up when you are down and feelin' blue
Right or wrong I'll sing my song
And you will know just who
Sings a merry Christmas strait to you
There's lot of ways to share the days
Of Christmas with your friends
A Christmas card, a tree that stars
And gifts that make you grin
I'd like to share this song with everyone who came our way
Without a doubt the fires not out
It burns for you today
[chorus]
Here comes a merry Christmas
and to all who might of missed us
A very merry Christmas strait to you
