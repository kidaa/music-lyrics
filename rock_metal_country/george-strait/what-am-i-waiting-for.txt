It's six minutes until eleven
The phone rings but it's never you
I won't walk the floor
I'll just watch it
Stood up, impatient, and blue
Chorus:
What am I waiting for?
She might never show
What am I waiting for?
My legs won't let me go
What am I waiting for?
What am I waiting for?
She'll never get here
It's not that I'm worried about her
She'll think of some brand new excuse
So why am I all alone and crazy?
While she's having fun running loose
Chorus
It's six minutes after eleven
But I'm talking about the next day
Our date was just made to be broken
I guess some things just never change
Chorus
What am I waiting for?
What am I waiting for?
What am I waiting for?
She'll never get here
