Some folks got nothing but trouble 
So little joy in their lives
But wherever we go happiness follows
We must be lovin' right
It might be the way I adore you
Or the way that you hold me tight
I don't know the reasons girl I'm believing
We must be lovin' right
All our friends say love fades away with time
But I know their wrong
'Cause they've never known
A love like yours and mine
So if the whole world goes crazy 
Let everyone else fuss and fight
When all is said and done, we'll be the lucky ones
We must be lovin' right
Some folks got nothin' but troubles
So little joy in their lives
But wherever we go happiness follows
We must be lovin' right
We must be lovin' right
