We made it final today
I gave you all I had, you made your get away
all the love we once made
turned to memories today 
I left the courtroom
and went straight to the church
I hit my knees and told God how much I hurt
there's nothing left of my heart
it's going to be so hard to make a new start 
CHORUS
Cause today my world slipped away
we buried the plans that we made
and tonight I'm alone and afraid
cause today my world slipped away 
All my friends say I'll make it alright
I'll recover and start a new life
but that'll be so hard to do
cause livin' ain't worth livin' without you 
REPEAT CHORUS 
Cause today my world slipped away
