is it that time agien, closing time closing in are they turning out the lights 
must i go home? cause her memory is haunting me, waiting there to see i'm not 
known, i know i just can't stand another lonely night this man is going out out 
of his mind since you left me behind, since you left me behind. am i the last 
one here please just one more beer, and i'll be on my way back to the blues. 
back down lonely street, to a house that's steep, with nothing but a line of 
bad news, i know i just can't stand another lonely night this man is going out, 
out of his mind, since you left me behind, since you left me behind.
