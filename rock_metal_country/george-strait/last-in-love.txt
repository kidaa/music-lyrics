Blues outside my door
I don't even know if it's rainin'
But I've been here before
And I don't want to be here anymore
Every now and then
Voices on the wind
Call me back to the first time
Far away and clear
You can hear the teardrops
Fallin' for the last in love
If I let you down
All I can say is I'm sorry
Now it's all over town
So I don't want to hear it from you
Please don't look away
It's hard enought to say
This could go on forever
When the night is clear
I can hear the teardrops
Fallin' for the last in love
Every now and then
Voices on the wind
I may love you always and always
Far away and clear
you can hear the teardrops
Fallin' for the last in love
Callin' for the last in love
Will we always be the last in love
