Some people say I'm one of those guys the blessings of life over looked.
Sometimes I feel like the tattered, torn pages of some old paperback book.
All the places I've played and the money I made, I've still got nothin' to show.
And the only thing I have left in the whole wide world is you.
Chorus
I gave it all I had every night for all these years,
Pourin' out my soul till it was gone.
I spread myself so thin that I'm just barely hangin' on.
But tonight I'm with you, you can carry me through; just love me.
'Cause the only thing I have left in the whole wide world is you.
You put your whole life into something you love, 
But you never get that one big break
That'll take you out of the backstreet bar and put you on center stage
But a million tears and million beers have just about washed me up.
Chorus
The only thing I have left is you.
