Last night I had a dream, dreamt I had it all I had it all
I had one truck, one car
oneboat, one guitar
Bujt all these things wouldn't get me too far
If I didn't have one of you
I lowrk hard every day to bring home all my pay
I got one house, one yard
One dog who likes to bark
We'd be cold, living the dark if I didn't have one of you
One of you is all I want and all I'll ever need
One of you is all ita takes to make my life complete
Chorus:
This is what I have, you have it all
I got one heart, one love
One dream I'm dreaming of
Wouln't have known what to give it all to
If I didn't have one of you
One of you is all I want and all I'll ever need
One of you is all it takes to make my life complete
repeat chours
