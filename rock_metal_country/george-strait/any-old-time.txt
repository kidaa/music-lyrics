Any old time you get lonely,
Nights get cold or love is blue,
Just snuggle up honey; you're my one and only,
Any old time, I'm here for you.
Pay no mind to the hour
Or how far away you may be.
Any old time you can find me, drop in a dime
and there I'll be.
Any old time you start missin'
Somebody to hold, to keep you company,
I'll be willin' when you want my kissin',
Any old time, just call on me.
Pay no mind to the hour
Or how far away you may be.
Any old time you can find me, drop in a dime
and there I'll be.
