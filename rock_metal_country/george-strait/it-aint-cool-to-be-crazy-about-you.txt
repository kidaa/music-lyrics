I thought you and me were something special
Thought you thought that way too
Now I know that this old boy just ain't the
best you think you'll ever do
Chorus:
It ain't cool
to be crazy about you
It ain't suave or debonair
to let you know I care
like I do
It ain't smart
to be so reckless with my heart
I should've known right from the start
I'd end up like a fool
believe me it ain't cool
All of my friends they tried to tell me
what and what not to do
It took a while for them to sell me
but finally they got through
Chorus:
