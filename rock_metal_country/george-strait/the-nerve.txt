I'm glad I had the nerve to talk to you that day
I could just have easily have let you get away
In that crowded airport, far from my hometown
If I had lost my courage then, you wouldn't be around
I'm glad I had the nerve. 
And I'm glad he had the nerve to get down on his knees
And say ";I bought this ring for you, won't you wear it please?";
My daddy sure touched somethin' in my momma's heart somehow
If he hadn't, I sure wouldn't be here with you now
I'm glad he had the nerve. 
Or I never would've lived like this
Or learned like this
Or laughed like this
Or loved like this 
I'm glad he had the nerve to sail across the sea
My great grand-daddy's great grandpa in 1833
He met an indian maiden in the smoky mountain mist
If they hadn't crossed that line, I would not exist
I'm glad they had the nerve. 
And I'm glad he had the nerve, while staring into space
To give this universe a time and a place
With one tiny atom or an Adam and an Eve
However you look at it, whatever you believe
I'm glad he had the nerve. 
Or we never would've live like this
Or learned like this
Or laughed like this
Or loved like this
Thank god he had the nerve. 
And I'm glad I had the nerve to talk to you that day
