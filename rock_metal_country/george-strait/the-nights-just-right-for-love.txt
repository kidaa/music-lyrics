I don't mind the thought of growing old
But I don't Want to lose my sense of humor
I'm okay as long as I can laugh
I don't care if everything goes wrong
Even if it's only for awhile
I'm alright if I can see you smile
You're an old-fashioned girl at home in the modern world
The night's just right for love
If somewhere down the line the wheels come off
You may find me broke down by the highway
I'm alright as long as I can walk
If it comes to pass I'm losing touch
As long as I can feel you close to me
I know I'm where I'm supposed to be
You're an old-fashioned girl at home in the modern world
The night's just right for love
Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I'm not
Maybe this moment is all we have got
I don't think that I'm afraid to die
Still in all I'd rather live forever
See a million full moons rising in the sky
Morning sunlight shining in your eyes
You're and old-fashioned girl at home in the modem world
The night's just right for love
The night's just right for love
