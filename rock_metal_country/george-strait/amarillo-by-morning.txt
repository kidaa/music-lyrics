Amarillo by morning
Up from San Antone
Everything that I've got
Is just what I've got on
When that sun is high 
In that Texas sky
I'll be bucking it to county fair
Amarillo by morning
Amarillo I'll be there
They took my saddle in Houston
Broke my leg in Sante Fe
Lost my wife and a girlfriend
Somewhere along the way
Well I'll be looking for eight
When they pull that gate
And I'm hoping that 
Judge ain't blind
Amarillo by morning
Amarillo's on my mind
Amarillo by morning
Up from San Antone
Everything that I've got
Is just what I've got on
I ain't got a dime
But what I've got is mine
I ain't rich
But Lord I'm free
Amarillo by morning
Amarillo's where I'll be
Amarillo by morning
Amarillo's where I'll be
