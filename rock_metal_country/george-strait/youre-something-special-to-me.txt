As I hold you close tonight, hear what I say. 
There's no doubt, it's love alright 
'Cause I've never felt this way. 
An angel's what you are, and now I see 
You're not just someone else, you're something special to me. 
Chorus: 
Evry man has a dream and you made mine come true. 
How it happened I don't know or care. 
I'm just happy I found you. 
Wrapped in the arms of love is where I'll be 
For all the world to see you're something special to me. 
Repeat Chorus: 
It's all such a mystery, you're something special to me.
