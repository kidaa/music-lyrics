The first time I saw you
You were waitin' tables at the corner diner
I said to myself
Never seen a woman look any finer
From that moment on
I was stone cold gone
You wuld be forever in my mind
Now somewhere in the neon lights
I'm holdin' on for dear life
Rockin' in the arms of your memory tonight
It was San Francisco
Silly sutis and white ties by the bay
You appeared with your papa
Tears were rolin' down your mother's face
Everyone was happy
Showered by well wishers as we drove away
Now somewhere in the neon lights
I'm holdin' on for dear life
Rockin' in the arms of your memory tonight
I'm living but dying
I'm laughing but crying
Somebody tell me it will be alright
I bought it for your birthday
God you looked so lovely in that dress
I took you to a party
Or was it to a night club I forget
Been twenty years and counting
I'm drowning in your love a little more each day
Now somewhere in the neon lights
I'm holdin' on for dear life
Rockin' in the arms of your memory tonight
Now somewhere in the neon lights
I'm holdin' on for dear life
Rockin' in the arms of your memory tonight
