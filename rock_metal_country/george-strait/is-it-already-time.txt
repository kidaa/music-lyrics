The years have been
So good to you and I my friend
They brought us to the Autumn wind
And left the tears behind
And who'd have dreamed
That love could grow so endlessly
And you'd have meant so much to me
Is it already time
Chorus:
And I will always love you so
We'll hold each other close until it's time to go
And we believed we had forever on our side
Is it already time
Chorus
And we believed we had forever on our side
Is it already time
