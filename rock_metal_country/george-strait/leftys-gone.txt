a jukebox introduced us when the 60's was still young, if you got the money 
honey got my nickels one by one, i tried to imatate that song, it's not right 
but lefty's gone, and always late breaks my heart and every song he sang i 
played the part, i heard he was sad and lived alone, it's not right but lefty's 
gone, he played the fair in dallas one year in the cold october rain, some 
folks stayed home in one but he sang just the same, i caught a chill before i 
got home, it's not right but lefty's gone, i heard he was sad and lived alone, 
it's not right but lefty's gone, it don't seem like he was around that long, 
it's not right but lefty's gone.
