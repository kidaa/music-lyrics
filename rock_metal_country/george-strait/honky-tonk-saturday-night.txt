Angels and devils share the same tables
And that's not so wrong if you get it done right.
Halos and horns lock up on the dance floor
On a Honkytonk Saturday Night.
It's a Honkytonk Saturday Night,
It's not who is who, it's who will or who might.
With luck she'll turn on 'fore they turn out the lights
On a Honkytonk Saturday Night.
I played the jukebox, I played some Merle Haggard,
Me and the waitress think he's outta' sight.
Then some folks got thirsty while we were dancin'
On a Honkytonk Saturday Night.
It's a Honkytonk Saturday Night,
It's not who is who, it's who will or who might.
With luck I'll turn her on 'fore they turn out the lights
On a Honkytonk Saturday Night.
With luck I'll take her home 'fore they turn out the lights
on a Honkytonk Saturday Night.
