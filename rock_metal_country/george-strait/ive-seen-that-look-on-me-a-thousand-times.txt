Its four AM and youre just getting in. 
Your first night out- I wont ask where youve been. 
Youre so ashamed and your eyes cant meet mine. 
Ive seen that look on me a thousand times. 
Chorus: 
What makes us do the things we do heaven only knows. 
We think weve got a secret, but it always shows. 
I taught you how to cheat, youre doing fine. 
Ive seen that look on me a thousand times. 
But I still love you and so I pretend 
And hope I never see that look again. 
But if I do I know the fault is mine. 
Ive seen that look on me a thousand times. 
Repeat Chorus: 
Ive seen that look on me a thousand times.
