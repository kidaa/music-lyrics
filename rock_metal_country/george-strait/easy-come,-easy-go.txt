says shes had enough of me
I've had enough of her too
I might as well go on and set her free
she's already turned me lose
no fault no blame nobody done no wrong
thats just the way it sometimes goes
sometimes two people just dont get along
and its time to hit the road 
CHORUS:
       Goodbye
       Farewell
       So long
       Vaya condios
       Goodluck
       Wish you well 
       Take it slow
       Easy come girl, Easy Go
We tried to work it out a hundred times
Ninety-nine it didnt work
I think it's best we put it all behind
Before we wind up gettin hurt
No hard feelins darlin no regrets
No tears and no broken hearts
Call it quits callin off all bets
It just wasnt in the cards
CHORUS
Easy come girl, Easy go
Vaya condios, Good luck
Easy come, Easy go
