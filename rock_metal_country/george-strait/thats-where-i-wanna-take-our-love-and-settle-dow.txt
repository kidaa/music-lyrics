It's a quiet little place tucked away in the hills
Where a crystal clear lake makes it crystal clear
That htere's not another living soul for miles and miles around
That's where I wanna take our live and settle down
There's a giant old oak tree that knows just how to shade
That midday summer sun when it's showin' off it's rays
While I'm making you a momma to mother natures's sound
That's where I wanna take our love and settle down
That's where I wanna raise the babies that we make
And the hell you know we'll raise when they raise cane
That's where I wanna see them laugh and cry and breathe
That honeysuckle air after it rains
And they'll know just what country means
'For they go off to town
That's where I wanna take our love and settle down
