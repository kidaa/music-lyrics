You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not put I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
He's making a list and checkin' it twice
Gonna find out who's knotty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town
He sees you when your sleepin'
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
O you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not put I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
With little tin horns
And little toy drums
Rutty toot, toots and rummy tum, tum
Santa Claus is coming to town
With curly head dogs to cuttle and hug
Elephants, ropes, and kitty card to
Santa Claus is coming to town
The kids and girl and boy land
Will have a jubilee
There gonna fill the toy lad all around with Christmas trees
So you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not put I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is coming
Santa Claus is coming to town
