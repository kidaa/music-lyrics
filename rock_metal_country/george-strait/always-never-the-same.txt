I know why I'm intrigued
You keep surprising me
Somewhere between the lines
There's no way to define
Every move you make
Always never the same
Call me mesmerized
Somewhat hypnotized
Somehow in Conversation
I'm lost in sweet templation
Every word you say
Always never the same
I can't count the ways
You take my breath away
Always never the same
Always never the same
Always never the same
