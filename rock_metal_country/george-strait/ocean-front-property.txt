If you leave me
I won't miss you
and I won't ever take you back
Girl your memory
won't ever haunt me
Cause I don't love you
Now if you'll buy that
Chorus:
Ive got some ocean front property in Arizona
from my front porch you can see the sea
Ive got some ocean front property in Arizona
An if you'll buy that I'll throw the Golden Gate in free
I don't worship
the ground you walk on
I never have and that's a fact
I won't follow or try to find you
Cause I don't love you
Now if you'll buy that
Chorus
Chorus
Yeah if you'll buy that I'll throw the Golden Gate in free
