Give me a bottle of your very best
'Cause I've got a problem I'm gonna drink off my chest
Gonna spend the night gettin' down
'Cause that woman I had wrapped around my finger just come unwound
That woman I had wrapped around my finger just come unwound
She kicked me outta the house and tonight I'm whiskey-bound
I'm gonna be the drunkest fool in town
'Cause that woman I had wrapped around my finger just come unwound
Well she packed my bags and opened up the door
And I got the feeling she didn't want me around no more
She caught me in a lie, I was messin' around
And that woman I had wrapped around my finger just come unwound
That woman I had wrapped around my finger just come unwound
She kicked me outta the house and tonight I'm whiskey-bound
I'm gonna be the drunkest fool in town
'Cause that woman I had wrapped around my finger just come unwound
