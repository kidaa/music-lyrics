1st. verse
well honey don't you worry i don't need no ballroom queen,
though i'll admit she sure know how to fill a pair of jeans,
and i'll admit now darlin she sure showin me her stuff
but honey it ain't nearly enough,
1st. chorus
cause i ain't never seen her patch a pair of ragged britches
stretch a paycheck til it reaches, scratch my back right where it itches
and i aint never seen that and honey til i do 
my heart won't wonder very far from you,
2nd. verse
now honey you know i honor all the hard times we been through
i never could have made it with anyone but you
and i think i know when a lady is really really tough
but she don't show me nearly enough,
2nd. chorus
cause i aint never seen her stay up all night with the baby
calm me down when i get crazy, fix me grits and red eyes gravy
and i aint never seen that and honey til i do
my heart won't wonder very far from you
last chorus
no i aint never seen her make a six room house a castle 
teach the young ones how to wrastle,
straighten out my fish and tackle
and i aint seen that and honey til i do
my heart won't wonder very far from you
no i aint never seen that and honey til i do 
my heart won't wonder very far from you.
