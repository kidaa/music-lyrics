I don't wanna be the kind to hesitate.. be too shy.. wait too late.
I don't care what they say other lovers do,
I just wanna dance with you.
I gotta feelin' that you have a heart like mine,
so let it show, let it shine.
If we have a chance to make one heart of two,
I just wanna dance with you.
Chorus: 
I wanna dance with you.... twirl you all around the floor,
that's what they intended dancing for an I just wanna dance with you.
I wanna dance with you.. hold you in my arms once more,
that's what they invented dancing for... I just wanna dance with you.
I caught you looking at me when I looked at you,
yes I did... ain't that true.
You won't get embarrassed by the things I do,
I just wanna dance with you.
Oh, the boys are playing softly and the girls are too,
so am I and so are you.
If this was a movie we'd be right on cue n' 
I just wanna dance with you. 
Repeat Chorus
Repeat chorus
I wanna dance with you.... twirl you all around the floor,
that's what they invented dancing for an I just wanna dance with you.
I wanna dance with you, hold you in my arms once more...
That's what they intended dancing for, I just wanna dance with you,
I just wanna dance with you, I just wanna dance with you,
Ahhhh..I just wanna dance with you.
