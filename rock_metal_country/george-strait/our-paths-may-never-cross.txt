Lady I know your out there somewhere
Like me your feeling lost
Maybe right now we both need each other
But our paths may never cross
People like us never find each other
Love is our greatest loss
Baby I know you are out there some where
But our paths may never cross
We're to people that should be together
Cause we're lonely at the very same time
but there's a million to many good reasons
why your love can never be mine
maby this song was written for you
listen, don't turn it off
I wish you could learn it
and come sing it with me
but our paths may never cross
I wish you could learn it
and come sing it with me
