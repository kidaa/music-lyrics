I'm not the hero
Who will always save the day
Don't always wear the white hat
Don't always know the way
I may not even be the dream
You wanted to come true
But I'll always be the man in love with you
I'm not the key
That opens every door
Don't have the power
To give you all you want and more
But when you're needing something special
You can hold onto
I'll always be the man in love with you
I could never work miracles
That maybe others who can do what I can't do
But no one else can be
As good as me
In loving you
So when the world won't turn
The way you wish it would
And the dreams you have don't come alive
As often as they should
Remember that there's someone there who's heart is always true
I'll always be the man in love with you
Remember that there's someone there who's heart is always true
Someone there to help you make it through
I'll always be the man in love with you
