I'd rather be home, 
but I make my livin' on the go
Big silver eagle spreads her wings
and drops us at another show
I think about holdin' my baby tonight
as I listin to the big wheels roll
Three days into a six week tour, 
gettin' in the rhythm of the road
We pick and sing, 
say ";goodnight"; then we'll be flyin'
My world's a chain of one-night-stands 
strung together by the center line
I don't know where I'll wake up tomorrow, 
but I can't let the tempo slow
Every town is just another beat, 
livin' in the rhythm of the road
The rhythm of the road's got a mind of its own
If you find it it'll drive you insane
Like the clackity-clack of a railroad track
I'm rattlin' like an old freight train
Towns are flashin' by, the folks are wavin' ";hi";
They all start to look the same
Gotta stop for a minute, be glad I'm in it
Remember just why I came
Those highway signs, Lord, they keep me on the move
I think about givin' it up sometimes, 
and gettin' in a diff'ren groove
But I just let the days slide by, 
get goin' with the flow
A four/four beat's the only time I keep, 
livin' in the rhythm of the road
A four/four beat's the only time I keep, 
livin' in the rhythm of the road
Livin' in the rhythm of the road
