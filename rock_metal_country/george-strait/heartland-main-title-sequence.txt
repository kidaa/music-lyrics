George Jr.:
When you hear twin fiddles and a steel guitar
You're listenin' to the sound of the American heart
And opry music on a Saturday night
Brings a smile to your face and a tear to your eye
Sing a song about the Heartland
The only place I feel at home
Sing about the way a good man
Works until the daylight's gone
Sing the rain on the roof on a summer night
Where they still know wrong from right
Sing a song about the Heartland
Sing a song about my life
George:
There's a place where mornings are an endless blue
And you feel mother nature walk along with you
Where simple people livin' side by side
Still wave to their neighbor when they're drivin' by
Sing a song about the Heartland
Sing a song about the Heartland
Sing a song about my life
