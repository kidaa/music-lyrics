The band had just started when they walked in the door
He sat her at a table and strolled out on the floor
He grabbed the first sweet thang that gave him the eye
And left the door open for the steal of the night
Three dances later she was still in her chair
He was still on the dance floor like he didn't care
So I eased on over, there was no ring in sight
And I found myself facing the steal of the night.
chorus
She was the steal of the night, 
Oh yeah, she was the steal of the night
He long hair flowing and her jeans so tight
I held her close and it felt so right
She was the steal of the night
Oh yeah, she was the steal of the night
He left her lonely and the pickings were right
She was the steal of the night
We danced every slow one the band could play
Was it ever this easy for ole Jesse James
Had the gold in my hands and the banker was blind
Just inches away from the steal of the night
When the band stopped playing we walked to the car
As I closed the door he ran out of the bar
Saw him shaking his fist under the parking lot light
As I strolled away with the steal of the night
repeat chorus
repeat chorus and fade out
