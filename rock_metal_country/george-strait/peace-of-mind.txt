I go anywhere that ol' wind blows
Down a blactop road...anytime
No strings attached, no ties to tie me down
So why hang around, when I can fly
Chorus:
I'm free, free to do as I please
Free to choose, free to be
Just plain me, just plain fine
I'm here then I'm there
Not a care in the world
What a cure for the soul...peace of mind
I go anywhere that ol' wind blows
Down a blacktop road ...anytime
No strings attached, no ties to tie me down
So why hang around, when I can fly
I don't dare slow down for anything
What tomorrow brings suits me fine
And I don't dare look back on yesterday
It's a throw away better left behind
repeat chorus
I go anywhere that ol' wind blows
Down a blacktop road...anytime
No strings attached, no ties to tie me down
So why hang around, when I can fly
So why hang around, when I can fly
