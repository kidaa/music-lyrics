What's goin' on in your world
I hope that you're doin' fine
I just called to say there is not a day
That you don't cross my mind
I just wanted to see if you feel like me
Sorry we said good bye
So what's goin' on in your world
It sure is lonesome in mine
Just tell me that you're happy
And I'll hang up the phone
Just tell me you don't need me anymore
And I'll leave you alone
I just wondered if you had somebody new
After all of this time
So what's goin' on in your world
It sure is lonesome in mine
Just tell me that you're happy
And I'll hang up the phone
Just tell me you don't need me anymore
And I'll leave you alone
I just wondered if you had somebody new
After all of this time
So what's goin' on in your world
It sure is lonesome in mine
What's goin' on in your world
