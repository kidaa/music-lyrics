If you are sincere when you say you don't care
That we should just let the past be,
If the love that we knew don't bother you,
Darlin?you're stronger than me.
And if still loving you means I'm weak, then I'm weak,
And I still fall apart when you speak or we meet.
If the love that we knew don't bother you,
Darlin?you're stronger than me.
If you can have fun with some other one
No thought of what used to be,
If it's easy to say that it's better this way,
Darlin?you're stronger than me.
And if still loving you means I'm weak, then I'm weak,
And I still fall apart when you speak or we meet.
If the love that we knew don't bother you,
Darlin?you're stronger than me.
