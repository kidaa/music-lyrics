Oh how you sparkle
And oh how you shine
That flush on your cheeks
Is more than the wine
And he must do something
That I didn't do
Whatever he's doing
Look's good on you
You look so good in love
You want him
That's easy to see
You look so good in love
I wish
You still wanted me
He must has stolen
Some stars from the sky
And gave them to you
To wear in your eyes
I had my chances
But I set you free
And now I wonder
Why I couldn't see
You look so good in love
You want him
That's easy to see
You look so good in love
I wish
You still wanted me
