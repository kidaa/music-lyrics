Odie Blackman/Jay Knowles
At first she's gonna come on strong
Like She'll love you all night long
Like it's going out of style
Then she'll leave you with a smile
Well you can't help but wonder
Why you can't help but love her
But you can't help love her
And all that hurtin' was more than worth it
It's written all over your face
One day you'll pass her on the street
With that guy you used to be
She'll say hello and walk on by
Then she'll leave you with a smile
Well you can't help but wonder
Why you can't help but love her
But you can't help love her
And all that hurtin' was more than worth it
It's written all over your face
At first she's gonna come on strong
Like She'll love you all night long
Like it's going out of style
Then she'll leave you with a smile
Ah, she's gonna love you
She gonna leave you with a smile
Ah, she's gonna love you
She gonna leave you with a smile
