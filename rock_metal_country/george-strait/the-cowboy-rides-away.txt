I knew the stakes were high right from the start
When she dealt the cards I dealt my heart
Now I just found a game that I can't play
And this is where the cowboy rides away
Chorus:
And my heart is sinking like the setting sun
Setting on the things I wish I'd done
It's time to say good bye to yesterday
This is where the cowboy rides away
We've been in and out of love and in between
And now we play the final showdown scene
And as the credits role a sad song starts to play
This is where the cowboy rides away
And my heart is sinking like the setting sun
Setting on the things I wish I'd done
Oh the last good bye's the hardest one to say
This is where the cowboy rides away
Oh the last good bye's the hardest one to say
This is where the cowboy rides away
