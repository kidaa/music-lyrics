We really shouldn't be doin' this
And we both know why
Just being close enough to think like this
Enough to make you need to lie
This kinds talk will lead us to somewhere
We're gettin' way too close to going there
The farther off the better to resist
We really shouldn't be doin' this
Only an isolated incident
But the acquaintance left me stunned
The first attractions was the hardest hit
I thought I'd ever overcome
This kinds situation has to pass
The chance encounter has to be the last
To take it further we would be remiss
We really shouldn't be doin' this
We'd each be hurting somebody else
If we don't say our good-byes real fast
Won't even think about a farewell kiss
We really shouldn't be doing this
Well........
