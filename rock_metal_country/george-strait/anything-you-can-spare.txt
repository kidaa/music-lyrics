If you have any left of her kisses
When youre through with your latest affair
Dont let them just waste, I know how they taste
Ill take anything you can spare
And if you have a few idle moments
If youre lonely and nobodys there
Ill gladly fill in til you find a new friend
Ill take anything you can spare
Yes, Ill even take some heartaches from you
Though Ive already more than my share
I love you all the time, so baby keep me in mind
Ill take anything you can spare
