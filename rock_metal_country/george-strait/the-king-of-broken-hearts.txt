The King of Broken Hearts doesn't ask much from his friends
And he has quite a few of them
They know he will understand
That's just the way it goes
TheKing of Broken Hearts doesn't know he's a king
He's tryin' to forget other things
Like some old ship at sea
He's walkin' through life alone
He talks to angels
And the stars start to spin
He thinks of troubles that he's gotten in
He recalls how his heart got broken
And how it's still that way
The King of Broken Hearts is so sad and wise
He can smile while he's cryin' inside
We know he'll be brave tonight
Cause he's the King of Broken Hearts
He talks to angels
And the stars start to spin
He thinks of the troubles that he's gotten in
He recalls how his heart got broken
And how it's still that way
The King of Broken Hearts thinks that he's no fool
He's a little like me and you
So what's a King like that supposed to do
With all that blue time
We know he'll be brave tonight
Cause he's the King of Broken Hearts
He's the King of Broken Hearts
