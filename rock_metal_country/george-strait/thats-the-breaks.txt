Well that's just great
Just what I needed
The icing on that cake
You're leavin'
But I give up
Throw up my hands
There's nothing I can say or do
I've done all that I can
That's the breaks
The way the cookie crumbles
What goes around comes around they say
That's the breaks
The way that ol' cookie crumbles
And what's been comin' round
Ain't been goin' my way
Well surprise me
Tell me something new
I know leavin's what I got
Comin' from you
And I'm sorry
You know I am
But one way or another I'll come through
In one piece once again
That's the breaks
The way the cookie crumbles
What goes around comes around they say
That's the breaks
The way that ol' cookie crumbles
And what's been comin' round
Ain't been goin' my way
That's the breaks
The way the cookie crumbles
What goes around comes around they say
That's the breaks
The way that ol' cookie crumbles
And what's been comin' round
Ain't been goin' my way
What's been coming 'round
Ain't been going my way
That's the breaks
