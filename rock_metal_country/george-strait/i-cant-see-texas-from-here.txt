I come and go as I please
From down here, up north and in between
But baby it's a shame, 'cause I always feel the same
When I can't see Texas from here
I can't see Texas from here
No matter how I try, it makes me wanna die
So if you see me looking down, I'm trying not to show this frown
'Cause I can't see Texas from here
I can't say I don't like Tennessee
The people here have all been good to me
So please don't take offense if I start to gettin tense
It's just 'cause I can't see Texas from here
I can't see Texas from here
No matter how I try, it makes me wanna die
So if you see me looking down, I'm trying not to show this frown
'Cause I can't see Texas from here
