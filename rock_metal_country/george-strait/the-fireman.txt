They call me the fireman
That's my name
Makin' my rounds all over town
Puttin' out old flames
Well everybody'd like to have what I've got
I can cool 'em down while they're smolderin' hot
I'm the fireman
that's my name
Last night they had a bad one a mile or two down the road
Well my buddy walked out and left this woman burnin out of control
Well I was down there in 'bout an hour or so
With a little mouth to mouth she was ready to go
I'm the fireman that's my name
They call me the fireman
That's my name
Makin' my rounds all over town puttin' out old flames
Well everybody'd like to have what I've got
I can cool 'em down while they're smolderin' hot
I'm the fireman that's my name...burn 'em up
I've got fire-engine red t-bird automobile
In a minute or less I can be dressed fit to kill
I work twenty-four on and twenty-four off
When they get too hot, they just give me a call
I'm the fireman, that's my name
They call me the fireman, that's my name
Makin my rounds all over town puttin' out old flames
Well everybody'd like to have what I've got
I can cool 'em down while they're smolderin' hot
I'm the fireman, that's my name
They call me the fireman
That's my name.
