At a table for two
With candlelight and wine
That diamond burnin' holes in his pockets
Thinkin' now's the perfect time
When he popped the question he could see
The teardrops fill her eyes
She said I knew this was comin', and I'm sorry
But I hope you realize
Chorus: You can't make a heart love somebody,
You can tell it what to do
But it won't listen at all
You can't make a heart love somebody
You can lead a heart to love
But you can't make it fall.
Then she reached for his hand
And said I want you to know
I've done everything that I know of
To make the feelin' grow
I've begged and I've pleaded with my heart
But there's no gettin' through
My heart's the only part of me
That's not in love with you
You can't make a heart love somebody,
You can tell it what to do
But it won't listen at all
You can't make a heart love somebody
You can lead a heart to love
But you can't make it fall.
You can't make a heart love somebody,
You can tell it what to do
But it won't listen at all
You can't make a heart love somebody
You can lead a heart to love
But you can't make it fall.
You can lead a heart to love
But you can't make it fall.
