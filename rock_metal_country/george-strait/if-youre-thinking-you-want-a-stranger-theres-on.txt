Lately you've been showin' all the signs
of a woman with someone else on her mind
It's not your fault
some nights I've left you alone
and if you're thinking you want a stranger
There's one coming home
Chorus:
If you're thinking you want a stranger
I'll soon be there
You're gonna see a change in me
this time I swear
No more late nights
comin' in at daylight
and no more doin' you wrong
and if you're thinking you want a stranger
There's one coming home
Bought you a silk gown and perfume today
picked up some roses and champagne on the way
Oh I called to ask you to put some soft music on
Cause if you're thinking you want a stranger
There's one coming home
Chorus
If you're thinking you want a stranger
There's one coming home
