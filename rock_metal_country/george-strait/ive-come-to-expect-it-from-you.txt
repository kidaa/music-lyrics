So upset
Nervous wreck
I can't believe she said goodbye
Sit and smoke
Cry and joke
About these tears in my eyes
Chorus:
How could you do what you gone and done to me
I wouldn't treat a dog the way you treated me
But that's what I get 
I've come to expect it from you
A million times
A million lines and I bought 'em every one
You don't care
You rip and tear every dream I've counted on
I guess I should thank my unlucky stars
That I'm alive
And you're the way you are
But that's what I get
I've come to expect it from you
Chorus
I could raise hell
But what the hell it wouldn't do a bit of good
I can leave
My heart agrees it seems to think that I should
There won't be no more next time doing me wrong
You'll come back this time to find that I'm gone
But that's what you get
You should expect that from me
That's what I get
I've come to expect it from you.
