it's dance time in texas and were striking up the band 
let's go honky tonkin' honey take my hand
it's dance time in texas where the wine and music flows
we'll do that texas two step and that old cotton eyed joe
i'll take you honky tonkin' in my old pick up truck
it's dance time in texas and the music lifts you up
it's dance time in texas and were striking up the band
we'll go honky tonkin'honey take my hand
it's dance time in texas where the wine and music flows
we'll do that texas two step and that old cotton eyed joe
now it's time for a slow dance and we're waltzing oh so close
it's dance time in texas and your the one i love the most
it's dance time in texas and were strinking up the band 
we'll go honky tonkin' honey take my hand
it's dance time in texas where the wine and music flows 
we'll do that texas two step and that old cotton eyed joe
