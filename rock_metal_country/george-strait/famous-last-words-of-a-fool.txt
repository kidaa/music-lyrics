I told her I wouldnt miss her at all 
as she walked to the door
I couldn't care less
if she didn't care anymore
and with tears in my eyes, I lied
I was glad we were through
as she drove away cryin' at the famous last words of a fool
famous last words of a fool
famous last words of a fool
";you won't break my heart"; and ";I don't love you";
the famous last words of a fool.
The first night without her would be easy
I kept telling myself
all the while dying
at the thought of her lying somewhere else
there'll be nothing to it
I'll easily find someone new
as my breaking heart echoed the famous last words of a fool
Repeat Chorus 
";You won't break my heart"; and ";I don't love you";
the famous last words of a fool
