Oh how I wish
You could read my mind
cause words can't always tell it
like it is some times
when we're this close
the lights and music glow
why don't we let our feelings 
take us where we want to go
Under these conditions 
There ain't no wrong or right
we're dealing with emotions
that's running wild to night
a man needs a women
a women needs a man
and under these conditions 
hearts get out of hand
You've got those eyes
that won't let go of me
they pull me in and out of touch
with reality
and you got those lips, 
that I just got to taste
I'd love to hear them whisper
darlin take me from this place
Under these conditions 
There ain't no wrong or right
we're dealing with emotions
that's running wild to night
a man needs a women
a women needs a man
and under these conditions 
hearts get out of hand
