Still reelin' from a relationship that left me torn in two
Tryin' to find that first step that leads to someone new
Gettin' me back together, didn't know it could be so hard
But if I'm ever gonna mend this broken heart...
You look like a real good place to start
I need a new beginning, and girl you fit right in
Sometimes a new beginning is found in an old friend
If I'm ever gonna mend this broken heart...
You look like a real good place to start
There've been times when you and him just couldn't get along
I'd hear your knock and let you in, be your shoulder to cry on
And now he's finally left you, and I've find you in my arms
If I'm ever gonna mend this broken heart...
You look like a real good place to start
I need a new beginning, and girl you fit right in
Sometimes a new beginning is found in an old friend
If I'm ever gonna mend this broken heart...
You look like a real good place to start
If I'm ever gonna mend this broken heart...
You look like a real good place to start
