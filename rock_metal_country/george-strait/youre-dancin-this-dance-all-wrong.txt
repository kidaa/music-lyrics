As I waltz in the arms of somebody new
Could it be what I feel may be too much too soon
But the way that you touch me, I want to give in
It's not so easy holding you when
You're dancing this dance all wrong
New steps don't come easy when old memories hang on
I'm finding I'm falling as the music plays on
Keep dancing this dance all wrong
A new partner's touch to an old partner's song
I'm getting the feeling as we dance along 
Two strangers tonight won't be strangers for long
Keep dancing this dance all wrong
You're dancing this dance all wrong
New steps don't come easy when old memories hang on
I'm finding I'm falling as the music plays on
Keep dancing this dance all wrong
You're dancing this dance all wrong
New steps don't come easy when old memories hang on
I'm finding I'm falling as the music plays on
Keep dancing this dance all wrong
