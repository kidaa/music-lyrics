Chorus:
Angel, oh my angel, Angelina
Heaven must be wonderin' where you are
Mornin' finds me prayin' please let me keep her
Each night finds me wishin' on a star
That always, oh always Angelina
You'll be stayin' right here in my arms
Sweetest of the sweet those ruby lips
No other has that touch ooh those fingertips
Bluest of the blue those sparklin' eyes
Like had in glove we fit you know you're just my size
You and all your special ways and means
Oh I love you Angelina
Chorus
You'll be stayin' right here in my arms
I'm back to bein' me
I'm back to bein' nobody
The who I was before I was your used to be
I'm back to bein' me
I'm back to who I was
Before I was the one who fell in love
With the one who never, ever was in love
I'm back to bein' me
These eyes that used to cry myself to sleep
Now they're dry they don't lay me down to weep
For the first time in a long time I like seeing what I see
No thanks to you
I'm back to bein' me
These eyes that used to cry myself to sleep
Now they're dry they don't lay me down to weep
For the first time in a long time I like seeing what I see
No thanks to you
I'm back to bein' me
I'm back to bein' me
I'm back to bein' nobody
The who I was before I was your used to be
I'm back to bein' me
I'm back to who I was
Before I was the one who fell in love
With the one who never, ever was in love
I'm back to bein' me
I'm back to bein' me
I'm back to bein' me
