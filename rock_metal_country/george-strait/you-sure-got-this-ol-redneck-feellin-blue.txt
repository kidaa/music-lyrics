oh,i recall some barroom brawls,that i got myself into
just a stich or two,got me back together
but whats it take to ease the ache,that came with losing you
i thought i was tough,but goodbye is too much
this healing is taking forever
chorus:
woman you sure got this old redneck feeling blue
whats going on inside me i ain't used to going through
this ol country boys hillbilly heart is breaking in two
yea,you sure got this old redneck feeling blue
i've never seen anything,hit me quite like this
you know the pain and lonliness it keeps hanging with me
oh, this good time joe,he took quite a blow
oh, why'd you call it quits,it'll take some time
to mend my mind,and put me out of my misery
chorus:
woman, you sure left this old redneck feelin blue
