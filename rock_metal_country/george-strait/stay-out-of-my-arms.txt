Many times temptation grows so strong
And makes someone go blind to what is wrong
We'll stop now while there's still the strength to see
Turn your eyes and run away from me
Chorus:
Stay out of my arms
Take my advice
It's easy to break the same heart twice
Let's stop the hurt before it starts
Don't follow me, stay out of my arms
I'm sure you'll find someone to have and hold
And keep the promises that you were told
I'd only lead you on and let you down
And hurt you when good memories can't be found
Chorus
Chorus
Don't follow me, stay out of my arms
