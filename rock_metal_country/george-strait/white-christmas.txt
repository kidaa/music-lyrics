I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the one's I use to know
Where the tree top's glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
[chorus]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your day's be merry and bright
And may all your Christmas's be white
[chorus]
And may all your Christmas' be white
