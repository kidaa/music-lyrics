She looked so much like a lady
But she was so much like a child
A devil when she held me close
An angel when she smiled
She always held it deep inside
But somehow I always knew
She'd go away when the grass turned green
And the sky turned baby blue
Chorus:
Baby blue
Was the color of her eyes
Baby blue
Like the Colorado skies
Like a breath of spring she came and left
And I still don't know why
So, here's to you and whoever
Holds my baby blue tonight
She brought color to my life
That my eyes have never touched
When she taught me how to care
I've never cared so much
I try not to think of her
But I fall asleep and do
And go away where the grass turns green
And the sky is baby blue
Chorus
