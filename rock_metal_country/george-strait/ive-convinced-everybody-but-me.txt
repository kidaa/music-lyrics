The guys down at the job all want to know
How things are going since I let you go
I laugh and say my heart aint missed a beat
Ive convinced everybody but me
Chorus
Im all right, Im okay, 
thats what I always say
When they ask me how Im doing without you
I say Im glad Im free and if they all believe
Ive convinced everybody but me
Im the life of the party every night
Nobody knows Im dyin deep inside
I dont hurt at all as far as they can see
Ive convinced everybody but me
Chorus
I smile in every mirror 
Like Im such a happy man
But my heart knows what a liar I am
Chorus
Yes, Ive convinced everybody but me
