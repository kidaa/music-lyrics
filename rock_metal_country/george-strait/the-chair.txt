Well, excuse me, but I think you've got my chair. 
No, that one's not taken, I don't mind 
If you sit here, I'll be glad to share. 
Yeah, it's usually packed here on Friday nights. 
Oh, if you don't mind, could I talk you out of a light. 
Well, thank you, could I drink you a buy? 
Oh, listen to me, what I mean is can I buy you a drink? 
Anything you please. 
Oh, you're welcome, well, I don't think I caught your name. 
Are you waiting for someone to meet you here? 
Well, that makes two of us glad you came. 
No, I don't know the name of the band, but they're good. 
Aren't they, would you like to dance? 
Yeah, I like this song too, it reminds me of you and me. 
Well, baby do you think there's a chance 
That later on I could drive you home? 
No, I don't mind at all. 
Oh, I like you too, and to tell you the truth 
That wasn't my chair after all. 
Oh, I like you too, and to tell you the truth 
That wasn't my chair after all.
