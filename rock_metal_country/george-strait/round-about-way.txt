As far as all my friends can tell I took her leavin' well
That's kinda right
'Cause when I'm out with them
I don't let her memory
rule the night
for the most part I'm okay
but I still miss her in a round about way 
[chorus]
around about the time that midnight rolls around
that's around about the time my tears start fallin' down
cause she's not around
I come unwound and my heart breaks
Yeah, I still miss her in a round about way 
I no longer sit alone for hours by the phone
wishin she would call
and just the other day I took her smilin' face
down off my wall
I've come a long long way
but I still miss her in a round about way 
[chorus]
