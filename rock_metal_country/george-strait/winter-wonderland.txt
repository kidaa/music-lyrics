Sleigh bells ring are ya listin'
In the lane snow is glistnin'
A beautiful sight we're happy tonight
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the blue bird
Here to stay is the new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walkin' in a winger wonderland
[chorus]
In the meadow we can build a snowman
We'll pretend that he's parts and brown
We'll say no man but you can do the job
When you're in town later one we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
Were facin' no frame
The plans that we made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
[chorus]
