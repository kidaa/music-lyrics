You swear you've had enough
You're ready to give up
On that little lie they call love
Then out of the blue clear sky
Fallin' right into your hands
Like rain on the desert sand
It's the last thing you had planned
Out Of The Blue Clear Sky
[chorus]
Here she comes a walkin' talkin' true love
Sayin' I been lookin' for you love
Surprise your new love has arrived
Out of the blue clear sky
Ain't love a funny thing
One day you're givin' up the dream
And the next you're pickin' out a ring
Out of then blue clear sky
[chorus]
Here she comes a walkin' talkin' true love
Sayin' I been lookin' for you love
Surprise your new love has arrived
Out of the blue clear
[chorus]
Out of the blue clear sky
