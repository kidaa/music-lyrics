I know that I surprised you comin' home
It's not my usual time of year
But I've got myself a problem
And I know that I might find the answer here
Remember when I was dad's pride and joy
And your little man
Every time that I got hurt
You were there to give a hand
Youd pick me up and you'd kiss my hurt away
Remember what you'd say
";Boy, you're gettin' more like him each and everyday";
Can we have a talk like it was yesterday
Your boy's back in trouble and he needs you right away
She said she's gonna leave me momma
Nothing on God's green earth will make her stay
I can't live with out her momma
But this time you can't kiss the hurt away
But if I'm so much like my dad
There must've been times you felt her way
So tell me word for word what he said
That always made you stay
She said she's gonna leave me momma
But if I'm so much like my dad
There must've been times you felt her way
So tell me word for word what he said
That always made you stay
Is it already time
