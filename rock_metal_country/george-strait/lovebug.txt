Well I was ruling the roost
Had all the chicks to myself
And suddenly it happened
A funny little feeling I felt
Well I tried to outrun it
But it finally caught up with me
Tell me how can I run
From something I can't see
Chorus:
Oh that teenie, weenie thing
They call the lovebug
Nobody's ever seen it
But it's got the whole world shook up
It all started with a little bitty kiss and a hug
It's the little itty, bitty, teenie, weenie thing
They call the lovebug
Well I always thought that
I had me a pretty good style
But I lost that race
By a good old country mile
With my head held way up high
And it fooled me, hit me
Really took me by surprise
Chorus
Chorus
It's the little itty, bitty, teenie, weenie thing
They call the lovebug
