When it's Christmas time in Texas
It's a very special time for me
In Texas we'll go swingin' 'round the Christmas tree
Dancin' to a Christmas melody
When it's Christmas time in Texas
It might look just like a summer day
There may not be snow in San Antonio
But it's a Texas Christmas to me
[chorus]
When Santa Claus slips over the border
It'll sound a little different when he sings
'Cause he'll hear those twin fiddle's playin'
Christmas songs with a touch of western swing
There may not be snow in San Antonio
But it's a Texas Christmas to me
When it's Christmas time in Texas
I love to hear those Christmas carolers sing
People on the go children's faces all aglow
Grandpa's been chasin' grandma around
Tryin' to catch her neath the mistletoe
Everything is right the lone star shinin' bright
But it's a Texas Christmas to me
Frosty the snowman knew the snow was hot that day
So he said lets run and have some fun before I melt away
Down to the village with a broom stick in his hand
Runnin' here and there all around the square
Sayin' catch me if you can
[chorus]
And here's wishin' you all a merry Christmas
Merry Christmas from Texas and me
