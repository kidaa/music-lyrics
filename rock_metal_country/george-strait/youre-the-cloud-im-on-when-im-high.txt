Sometimes I like a drink 'cause I'm happy, 
When I think of how your love, it's my life.
If you see me light on my feet feeling good inside,
Honey, you're the cloud that I'm on when I'm high.
Chorus
When I'm high, I'm high because you love me,
No matter if I'm sober, or having bourbon with water by.
If you see me light on my feet feeling good inside,
Honey, you're the cloud I'm on when I'm high.
It has always been my style to celebrate,
And what more could I celebrate tonight?
You're sweet love took my soul flying to the sky,
Honey, you're the cloud I'm on when I'm high.
Chorus
