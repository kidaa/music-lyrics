If you got a Cadillac boy
and a 40 room shack boy
A bucket full of money
and a tree full of honey
but if your gettin' no huggin'
no smoochin' or a muggin'
If you ain't lovin'
than you ain't livin'
If youre ridin' on a gravy train
instead of walkin' down lovers lane
You can't make hay boy
cause your goin' the wrong way boy
You gotta get a little honey
it's better than money
If you ain't lovin'
than you ain't livin'
If they call you a big man
cause you got a lot of bottom land
If you're kin to the President
and ya get help from the Government
but if your gettin' no attention
you're better off on a pension
If you ain't lovin
than you ain't livin'
If you got a string of long cards
and your smokin' them four-bit cigars
you ain't so well to do
unless you get a little coochy-coo
it takes a little bit of smackin'
or your lifes lackin'
If you ain't lovin'
