Well now I can see your dancin every dance with her
And it seems to me that your dancin much too close to her
When you sat down at our table 
You sat next to her
But I know that it's true 
She loves me, She don't love you
Chorus:
Let me tell you friend
I'm wise to your lies
You've been tellin me that I'm the guy for her
And every little thing you do and say
Is givin you away
You're in love with her
Well just one more dance with her 
And friend you're gonna see
What it's like to hit the floor
And do a little dance with me
Here's your coat and there's the door
I think you better leave 
Cause she just told me it's true 
She loves me, She don't love you
Repeat Chorus
Well just one more dance with her
And friend you're gonna see
What it's like to hit the floor
And do a little dance with me
Here's your coat and there's the door 
I think you better leave
Casue she just told me it's true 
She loves me, She don't love you
Cause she just told me it's true
She loves me, She don't love you
