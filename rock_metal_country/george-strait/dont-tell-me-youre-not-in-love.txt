I know you're ready you show all the signs
Your eyes sparkle oh how they shine
But you keep saying you can't take another heartache
The way you hold me the way that you move
Your feelings keep showing through
You can't hide it it's written all over your face
Don't tell me you're not in love
When your heart beats like it does
You trembling body tells on you
Each time we touch
You can tell you're afraid
I am too and that's okay
I got eyes I can see
Baby don't tell me you're not in love
Sweet love songs bring you to tears 
Come on baby don't hide your fear
Let your lips say what your heart already knows
Your denial is last thing to fall
The only brick left holding the wall
Don't hold back speak with your heart and your soul
Don't tell me you're not in love
When your heart beats like it does
You trembling body tells on you
Each time we touch
You can tell you're afraid
I am too and that's okay
I got eyes I can see
Baby don't tell me you're not in love
