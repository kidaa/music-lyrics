I had a love and it was all mine
I drove her out, I must've been blind
That's the thoughts of a fool thinking out loud
She loved me so, but I was untrue
She's gone for good, what can I do
That's the thoughts of a fool thinking out loud
There's not a thing that I can say about her
Except I don't know how I'm going to live without her
I had a love and it was all mine
I watched it fade a kiss at a time
That's the thoughts of a fool thinking out loud
That's the thoughts of a fool thinking out loud
