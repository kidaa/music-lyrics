I'm gonna stuff my present up your chimney 
And the melted snow will make it all wet 
Cuz it's gonna be one of those Christmas days 
Spent in bed 
I will be your little drummer boy 
I'll beat it till you feel no pain 
Cuz baby you're my Christmas joy 
When you're sucking on my candy cane 
It's gonna be one of those Christmas days 
We spend in bed 
It's gonna be one of those Christmas days 
We spend in bed 
Merry Christmas!
