The chromosome divides, multiply and thrive 
And the strong survive, and the strong survive 
And a spaceman fucked an ape 
Then cut out on the date 
And now it's much too late 
The space ship has escaped 
Let it go 
We're lacking something good, something good 
Is this all for nothing 
Good, something good 
Boom tick tick and who skipped the long play 
Boom tick tick 
The chromosome divides, multiply and thrive 
And the strong survive, yeah the strong survive 
And the grandson of an alien wears his snakeskin boots 
And shows his reptile roots 
He shows his reptile roots 
We're lacking something, something good 
Something good, yeah 
Is this all for nothing 
Show me the goods, something good 
Boom tick tick and who skipped the long play 
Who skipped the record and who amped what you say 
I want to sing a song that's my own 
I want to be the DJ 
We're lacking something, something good 
Something good, yeah 
Is this all for nothing 
Boom tick tick 
Show me the goods, something good 
The chromosome divides, multiply and thrive 
And the strong survive, yeah the strong survive 
The chromosome divides, multiply and thrive 
And the strong survive, and the strong survive 
And it's all right, it's all right, yeah 
It's a long night, a long night 
A long night, it's a long night...
