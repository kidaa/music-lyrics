Nothing much matters to me so I don't see why 
I should hold so tightly to a memory that I can't speak of 
I think about it nightly how you opened up your life for me 
Why are you still lonely 
Though I'm not the type who begs 
I'm thinking how you'd open up you legs 
And I'm farther from you every day 
Farther from you every day 
And a woman talking to herself gathers up the shit she couldn't sell 
Chances don't bode well tomorrow and 
Talking to myself pass by, I miss you 
But not the face you make 
Like when you found me out for the fake I am 
So easily you see through me 
What do you do to me to make me treat you so bad 
I keep hoping that you'll speak to me 
But I'm farther from you every day 
Farther from you every day 
All I think about is waiting and the people we are changing into 
All right, farther from you every day 
There was a sound, but I don't know how it goes 
There was something we went through, blew in from the coast 
You said, you are of the earth and I am of the sky 
I don't even know what the hell that means 
Farther from you every day 
All I think about is waiting and all the people we are fading into 
Farther from you every day 
And I think about you dying years from now never having known 
Who you are 
This could be a big mistake 
Farther from you every day 
All I think about is waiting and all the people we are fading into 
Farther from you every day 
And I think about you dying years from now never having known 
Who you are 
Farther from you every day
