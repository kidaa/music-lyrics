Originally recorded/performed by Johnny Cash

Johnny Cash, Johnny Cash, Johnny Cash, Johnny Cash, 
Johnny Cash trying to calm the criminal
Soothed and imprisoned by a Memphis summer hymnal
With a safety razor and a good man's nightmare
And that long road out of here paved with words that he don't believe
And a bitch of a woman caused the man in black to grieve 
Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down 
I think you only live to see the lights of town 
I wasted my time when I would try, try, try 
'Cause when the lights have lost their glow you'll cry, cry, cry 
Soon your sugardaddies will all be gone 
You wake up some cold day and find you're alone 
You'll call for me but I'm gonna tell you bye, bye, bye 
When I turn around and walk away you'll cry, cry, cry 
You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone 
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own 
You're gonna cry, cry, cry 
I lie awake at night to wait 'till you come in 
You stay a little while and then you're gone again 
Every question that I ask I get a lie, lie, lie 
For every lie you tell you're gonna cry, cry, cry 
You're gonna cry, and then you'll, you'll cry alone 
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own 
You're gonna cry, cry, cry, cry 
When your fickle love gets old, and no one will care for you 
You'll come back for me for a little love that's true 
I'll tell you no and then you'll ask me why, why, why 
When I remind you of all of this you'll cry, cry, cry 
You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you, you'll want me then 
It'll hurt when you think of all the fool you've been 
You're gonna cry, cry, cry, cry 
Cry, cry, cry, cry 
You're gonna cry, cry, cry 
Johnny Cash trying to calm the criminal, soothed and imprisoned by a Memphis 
summer hymnal, with a safety razor... 
It's gonna hurt you, hurt you
