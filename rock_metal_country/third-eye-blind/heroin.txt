I don't know just where I'm going
But I'm gonna try for the kingdom if I can
'Cause it makes me feel like I'm a man
I put a spike into my veins
I'll tell you things aren't quite the same
When I'm rushing on my run
And I feel just like Jesus' son
And I guess that I just don't know
And I guess that I just don't know

I have made a decision
I'm gonna try to nullify my life
'Cause when the blood begins to flow
And you shoot up a dropper's neck 
And I really don't care no more
And I guess that I just don't know
And I guess that I just don't

Heroin, death of me
Heroin

I wish I was born a thousand years ago
I wish I had sailed the darkened seas
On a great big clipper ship
Moving from this here land to that
Over the evils in this town
All the dead bodies piled up on the ground
I lost myself and those around
And I guess that I just don't know
And I guess that I just don't know

Heroin 
Heroin
It's my wife
And it's my life
Heroin will be the death of me
