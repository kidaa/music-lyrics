Yeah, I'll have to do it good,
Have to do it good...

Ha, ha.. ha ha haaaaaaa ha 
Whoa whoa whoa whoa 
Yeah, yeahhoooeeeeeeeee 
Whoa whoa whoa ..... 

OK, here comes the verse 

Easy Rider 
He got brand new cowboy hat and 
He was reincarnated 
Easy Rider 
He's got lots of toys and 
He became a cowboy to get cowgirls 

Yeah yeah yeah yeah ......... 
Yo yo yo........ 

Easy rider has been reincarnated 
And now he has said to Santa Claus 
Happy times are here and all the animals 
Who help him no longer have claws 
On their paws, on their paws, on their paws, paws, paws, on 

Yeah hhoooey 

Easy rider and every one of the helpers 
Have to say that they had a real good time 
No longer will I be so unhappy when it turns into oh happy Christmas times 

Merry Christmas everybody 
I don't hate Christmas anymore 
I don't hate it anymore 

OK
