I want a new girl, the kind everybody wants 
The kind that shout it out and then we laugh it off 
I'll be a terrorist if she will be a looter 
Eye of Fatima painted on her motor scooter and... 
She puts on eye shadow 
A deeper shade, a deeper shade of blue 
And then she gets in bed with you 
I want a new girl 
Who can show me how to have a good time 
And get closer to my life's design 
In the darkness 
Candle light across my face 
I feel myself fall into grace and... 
She puts on eye shadow 
A deeper shade, a deeper shade of blue 
And then she gets in bed with you 
Man, sometimes I get the feeling so left out 
And then I'm here again 
I'm crying in my beer again 
Loneliness closes down like a jail 
This is a lonely tale 
I'm singing in my jail cell 
She's got a smile so wide to ease the pain 
The pain I'm going through 
And then she gets in bed with you 
She's brand new, she's brand new, she's brand new 
We walk Manhattan in a dark silver suit 
In the blowing wind, no demons persecuted 
And in the darkness, candle light across my face 
In my mind I see... 
She's got a smile so wide it eats the pain 
The pain I'm going through 
And then she gets in bed with you 
She's brand new, she's brand new, she's brand new 
Man, sometimes I get the feeling so left out 
But then I'm here again 
I'm crying in my beer again 
Loneliness closes down like a jail 
This is a lonely tale 
This is a jail cell 
She puts on eye shadow 
A deeper shade, a deeper shade of blue 
I'm very pleased with meeting you 
She's got a smile so wide to ease the pain 
The pain I'm going through 
But then she gets in bed with you
