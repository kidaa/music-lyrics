Justice comes into your life and then you'll know 
You'll know 
Justice comes, justice let it come 
I get the justice coming for you and I 
I get the joy joy when it comes my joy, I get the joy joy 
When justice comes to everyone 
Why does a willow weep when all I see's a tree grow 
All in camouflage everyone that I know 
We walk along like sequel in a cameo 
You're got your joy joy 
So find the people of your own 
I'll take in anyone who's taking off their camouflage 
Go on, check it 
I'll take in anyone who's messing up the sabotage 
To yourself don't destroy 
I'll take in anyone who's taking off their camouflage 
Check it 
Gimmie the ball, gimmie it all, big orange ball 
Roll up over fields 
I shame the devil 'cause I throw it down so hard 
I rock the big line, I rock the back yard 
Be a dream in color even on a winter's night 
Get your joy joy no matter who says it's right 
Their cover's blown 
Find the story of your own 
I'll take in anyone who's taking off their camouflage 
I'll take in anyone who's messing up the sabotage 
To yourself don't destroy 
I'll take in anyone who's taking off their camouflage 
Ok, ok, ok 
In the geometry of, prism of my of my eye will flow 
I ask the questions and wonder why 
Only to roll in a big orange ball that floats in a summer sky 
secret words never to be printed 
Take it up from the underground, proactive and soul 
Play a vital role, that's what you are 
Check it, check it, check it 
I'll take in anyone who's taking off their camouflage 
Go on, check it 
I'll take in anyone who's messing up the sabotage 
To yourself don't destroy 
I'll take in anyone who's taking off their camouflage
