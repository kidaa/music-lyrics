I wish you would step back 
From that ledge my friend 
You could cut ties with all the lies 
That you've been living in 
And if you do not want to see me again 
I would understand, I would understand 
The angry boy a bit too insane 
Icing over a secret pain 
You know you don't belong 
You're the first to fight 
You're way too loud 
You're the flash of light on a burial shroud 
I know something's wrong 
Well everyone I know has got a reason 
To say put the past away 
I wish you would step back 
From that ledge my friend 
You could cut ties with all the lies 
That you've been living in 
And if you do not want to see me again 
I would understand, I would understand 
Well he's on the table and he's gone to code 
And I do not think anyone knows 
What they're doing here 
And your friends have left you 
You've been dismissed 
I never thought it would come to this 
And I, I want you to know 
Everyone's got to face down the demons 
Maybe today 
You could put the past away 
I wish you would step back from 
That ledge my friend 
You could cut ties with all the lies 
That you've been living in 
And if you do not want to see me again 
I would understand, I would understand 
I would understand, I would understand 
I would understand, I would understand 
Can you put the past away
