Riding on the road with friends 
And the road trip ends 
The weather changes mood 
Try to keep my jaw from dropping 
When you found out things I wish I'd never knew 
I wish I'd never knew 
And everybody's got a story to tell 
And everybody feels some pain 
So do you 
So do you 
Do you think you are invisible? 
Do you think you are invisible today? 
And everybody's got a letter to write 
And everybody's lost a fight 
So have you 
So have you 
Do you think you are invisible today? 
Tony's only child cries 
And he calms him down the best that he can do 
Tried to make your mother love me 
But she's got other ideas what is good for you 
What is good for you
And everybody's got a story to tell 
And everybody feels some pain 
So do you 
So do you 
Do you think you are invisible? 
And everybody's got a letter to write 
And everybody's lost a fight 
So have you 
So have you 
Do you think you are invisible today? 
Do you think you are invisible today? 
Do you think you are invisible today? 
Do you think you are invisible? 
Whoaaaaaaa-o-o-o 
Whoaaaaaaa-o-o-o o-o-o 
Everybody's got a story to tell 
Everybody feels some pain 
So do you 
So do you 
Do you think you are invisible? 
Everybody's got a letter to write 
Everybody's lost a fight
So do you yeah 
So do you yeah 
So do you whoa 
So do you whoa 
Whoaaaaaaa-o-o-o o-o-o 
Whoaaaaaaa-o-o-o o-o-o o-o-o
I keep on motoring, I keep on motoring 
Motoring with your radio song 
And we can't get along, the motoring song 
Put your radio on
Riding on the road with friends 
And the road trip ends 
When the weather changes mood
Do you think you are invisible?
