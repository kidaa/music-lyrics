She's fogging up the mirror with vapor around her body
Soap glistens in the shower
And I just wanna be right here
Go down on her for an hour
Or maybe stay and let the day just fade away in a wild dedication 
Let the moment of hope take hold and let it run and never look back at the 
damage we've done
But she catches me watching, covers herself with a towel
A little angry, and she only sees a voyeur.
