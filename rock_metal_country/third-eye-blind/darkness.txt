Blue come over 
Born a joneser 
The cops pull out the radar 
And shoot devious grins 
Another day begins 
I want someone to know me 
Maybe tell me who I am 
'Cause I've faced down my demons 
And cried out to a god 
A god I've never seen 
Lights 
And the world darkens around me 
Strange friends all surround me 
New ideas in my head start to burn 
Dropped out of schools 'cause of things that I never learned 
And the world darkens around me 
World darkens around me, yeah 
World darkens around me, yeah 
I want you to love me 
Like you did before you knew me 
And I never thought there'd be any help for somebody like me 
A vacancy 
Say 
'Cause the world darkens around me 
Strange friends all surround me 
New ideas in my head start to burn 
Trust no one, that's the one thing that I've learned 
'Cause the world darkens around me 
World darkens around me, yeah 
Bring me the sun 'cause I slide off the moon 
Bring me the sun 
Slide off the moon 
Yeah you better get home soon 
There's no hope for people like you and me 
There's no hope for people 
Slide off the moon 
Bring me the sun 'cause I slide off the moon 
Bring me the sun 
Slide off the moon
