Tell the truth for once just this time
Knowing we've been through it
Baby's eyes look just like mine
We've both been through it
Tell the truth for once just this time
I didn't know how much you 
Would take from me

When you kiss this little girl around
Give me back mine
Didn't know what we made laying down
One more time
Tell the truth for once just this time
It just seems that things, it could've been different

I can't change it

So alright Caroline
I won't take nothing from you
Alright Caroline
Even if it means the truth
Alright

When you teach this little girl to walk
Another will remind
There's a price to pay for a place safe to hide
From inside
The truth for once just this time
It seems that things, they could've been different

Both of us
Both of us

Alright Caroline
I won't take nothing from you
Alright Caroline
Even if it means the truth
Alright

Time moves faster today, oh
Let's not speak of it 
Some things you cannot mend
And I'm watching her sleep
And it's beautiful
Tell me when I won't be seeing you again

You didn't even ask me 
If it was alright

Alright Caroline
Even if it means the truth
Alright Caroline
Alright

To understand you
I feel you
To claim to understand you
But I feel you

It's gonna take a long time
To grow young again, yeah, I know
It's gonna take a long time
To grow young again, I know
It's gonna take a long, It was alright
To grow young again, It was all right
If it was alright
If it was alright
