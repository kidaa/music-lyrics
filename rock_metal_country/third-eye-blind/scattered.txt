Well the dragonflies float on
And little kids go chasing them
Veiled night time comes along
And the prophet of a discontent is gone 
And the devil smiles as he pulls the wings off
At the one who wrote and forgot the song
Well it's not my fault what you did
And it's not my fault we're young and stupid
Still I'm stuck in this nightmare joke, 
No company, my strings are broke
So I go out looking for the right one
A nice fat girl with a tight one
Cause I, oh I always laugh when I'm hurting.

When I was punk I was way more punk than you
What happened to our little tribe
On a tombstone we'll inscribe
And I, I didn't know my friends would leave me too
And when I sold out
I thought my lies out through and through
Cause I, I, oh I always laughing when I'm hurting

Is anyone sick of being nervous and annoyed
Don't play with pins to fill the void
And I'm paranoid
And the legacy we become
To the high rockets, see the shot gun
With your burger bleeding on the plate
I'm holding out for a different fate

No one's fooling anyone
Everyone struggles inside 
And everyone has lied
Fooling anyone
No one is fooling anyone
No one is fooling anyone
No one is fooling anyone

Turn the music up louder
Spit out the taste of gun powder
We'll have a bonfire
Burn it all down
Let's take it higher
I'm gonna find me a woman who makes my soul feel thick
She says love, I won't feel sick
When you say how ya doing?
We'll say we are fine
Yeah we're fine,
I am fine

Cause I, I, oh I always laugh when I'm hurting
