Click your heels, feel you come for me 
Care free, she's got something big to tell me 
At the ocean, talk back at the ocean 
There's no simple way to let you know 
Funny how she always cried out daddy 
I got a big surprise, she said: 
I'm in trouble now and it cannot wait 
She's ten days late 
Boy your life got complicated 
Well I can't wait, to see this through 
She's ten days late, ten days late 
Low ride bicycles go cruising by 
I laugh, I don't even know why 
Talk back at the ocean 
Consequence and ozone catch a glow 
Oh no baby, oh, no, no 
Give me a minute now to figure out my state 
Oh, I know she's ten days late 
And I don't know where to take it 
But it's still great knowing you 
She's ten days late, ten days late 
Time has come for you to chose 
Baby daddy keep your boo 
Many blessings come to you 
Baby daddy keep your boo 
Baby daddy keep your boo 
Baby daddy keep your boo 
Your eyes look to me for what to do 
I can't lie, uh, uh, I don't know 
At the ocean and, talk back at the ocean 
No ones laughing now what do I say 
You walk away, wait, no, no don't go 
At the ocean and, talk back at the ocean 
Give me a minute now to figure out my state 
She's ten days late 
And I'm never gonna fade it 
I guess I'll always be knowing you 
Knowing you, knowing you 
Crawl up the bedpost
