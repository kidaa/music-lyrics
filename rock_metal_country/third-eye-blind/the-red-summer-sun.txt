there's a big red sky over you and i 
and it's coming and we're pumping over the ground 
in desert air i hope you'll be there 
cause it's coming down 
pumping over ground 
i've seen car wreck kids walk away from it 
laughed from within 
i know these days will end 
it's been a long time a long time 
to walk with the mighty 
i won't be a martyr 
so let me go let me go 
on my own i'll make do with none 
i will blame no one 
slept on packing foam 
i'll make it all my home 
and i'll take on anyone 
it's been a long time a long time 
to walk with the mighty 
i won't be a martyr 
so let me go let me go 
and i'll take on anyone 
these days they're not done 
the red summer sun
