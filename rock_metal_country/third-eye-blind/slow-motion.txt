Miss Jones taught me English 
But I think I just shot her son 
'Cause he owed me money 
With a bullet in the chest you cannot run 
Now he's bleeding in a vacant lot 
The one in the summer where we used to smoke pot 
I guess I didn't mean it 
But man, you shoulda seen it 
His flesh explode 
Slow motion see me let go 
We tend to die young 
Slow motion see me let go 
What a brother knows 
Slow motion see me let go 
Now the cops will get me 
But girl, if you would let me 
I'll take your pants off 
I got a little bit of blow we could both get off 
Later bathing in the afterglow 
Two lines of coke I cut with Drano 
And her nose starts to bleed 
A most beautiful ruby red 
Slow motion see me let go 
We'll remember these days 
Slow motion see me let go 
Urban life decays 
Slow motion see me let go 
And at home 
My sister's eating paint chips again 
Maybe that's why she's insane 
I shut the door to her moaning 
And I shoot smack in my veins 
Wouldn't you 
See my neighbor's beating his wife 
Because he hates his life 
There's a knock to his fist as he swings 
Oh man, what a beautiful thing 
And death slides close to me 
Won't grow old to be 
A junkie wino creep 
Hollywood glamorized my wrath 
I'm a young urban psychopath 
I incite murder for your entertainment 
'Cause I needed the money 
What's your excuse 
The joke's on you 
Slow motion see me let go 
Oh yeah 
Slow motion see me let go 
Slow motion see me let go
