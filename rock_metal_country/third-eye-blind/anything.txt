Anything for you 
Turn my castles blue 
Turn my bones to sand 
Just to see you 
I'll give you anything 
I'll give you anything 
I'll give you anything 
Jackie O with the top down open 
All the words to what's unspoken 
I'll put together everything that's broken 
Just to see you 
I'll give you anything 
I'll give you anything 
I'll give you anything 
Jackie O with the top down open 
A king's horse for what's been broken 
I'll bring back even what's unspoken 
Just to see you 
I'll give you anything 
I'll give you anything 
I'll give you anything
