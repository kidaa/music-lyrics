I believe everything you say 
Cuz' you're not frightened 
the way I've been so 
So I follow you 
Just in case you lose your way 
So glad you let me stay around 
The chain link fence you climbed 
To make forbidden lakes our own 
Your's and mine 
And with ease of the sea gulls 
We cut the engines and cruise high 
In the summer sky 
Now I could speak to everything 
But there's no room for my voice 
When sweet feedback is 
Jumping through the hoop of your ear 
Ring there goes the phone 
And then you're off again 
On what the caller brings 
So I went and trashed myself at the bar 
Confused for nothing 
thinking you'd be there 
I'm so embarrassed cuz it's you 
Who comes to take care of me 
Shambling home again with you to lead 
And it's not the way I want to go 
And I'm mad at you and I'm mad at me 
Talking endlessly, not a kind word to say 
Till your amber beads of wisdom come 
And I want to write it down 
Just the way you said it 
So I could keep it always 
I can't forget the smell 
Of summer trees at midnight 
Bending backwards to please the wind 
You touch the tattoo of the sun 
On a warm belly that once 
carried a baby for a while 
Then let that crackled leather jacket round you fold 
Red face saints monogrammed in gold 
And in this beauty 
I would not go any further 
Cuz I suddenly remembered 
We can't live this way forever 
Idle daylight 
I've never caught you in a lie 
Not until now 
I feel somehow 
The passing of these days gone by 
What will you do when the feeling 
That you have is through 
I need to know 
Cuz I'll never stop hanging on to you 
And it's times like this that I dread 
When there's everything to say 
And nothing left 
To be said 
And it makes me sad
