I couldn't believe it 
Those sapphire eyes 
Brilliant girl with the famous thighs 
And the cameras click and then we are stars 
We're laughing in the back of chauffeured cars 
All the time on the phone and the voice is ours 
Winter blooms with the summer flowers 
I promised you what's ours is ours 
Somewhere backstage with Shawn and Lars 
I go crazy when you walk in the room 
I laugh at myself with the girl on the film 
And the taste of sex couldn't be too soon 
All afternoon and 
LA parties in the phony lands 
Phony grabs with the manicured hands 
I always thought you are pretty like a whip 
I should've watched my step 
Cuz I keep on forgetting myself 
And I keep on forgetting myself 
I keep forgetting myself and 
I keep on forgetting myself 
I keep on forgetting myself 
And I keep on forgetting myself 
Who am I? We both don't know 
Time ticks by, where'd you go? 
You always knew where you were going to 
So sweet for you, said please go with you 
I see you throw down all your cards 
Promises go into shards 
Wait, did...did it go to my head? 
We still sleep with the dogs on the bed 
All these LA parties and the vodka fizz 
This is not my life, or maybe it is 
And I keep on forgetting myself 
And I keep on forgetting myself 
I keep forgetting myself and 
I keep on forgetting myself 
I keep on forgetting myself 
And I keep on forgetting myself 
Who am I? We both don't know 
Time ticks by, where'd you go? 
Oh I make you doubt me 
Oh I...You're better off without me 
You better looking over your shoulder 
Cuz there's someone younger and we're feeling older 
You're crazy and you're never fading 
Don't want to be so complicated 
See my life come undone 
Watch it go and let the damage run 
I'd change the song now if I could 
In the slickness of your blood 
I keep on forgetting myself 
And I keep on forgetting myself 
I keep forgetting myself and 
I keep on forgetting myself where'd you go? 
I keep on forgetting myself 
And I keep on forgetting myself 
Who am I? We both don't know 
Whoa whoa whoa where'd you go? 
Where'd you go now? 
Where'd you go? 
Where'd you go? 
Where did you go? 
Where'd you go? 
Hello, hello, hello.......
