I am made, of a hard skin
So I don't know how so much pain still gets in
Scars between you and me, my friend
Stone thrown, skips across the sea and the smokes shining in

So I go down to the sea 
And I will breathe yeah-yeah 
Take back your piece of me 
I let it bleed yeah-yeah 

I rage, from within 
My bones break
When they mend,
The stone returns again 

So I go down to the sea 
Where I will breathe yeah-yeah 
Take back your piece of me
Let it bleed-bleed yeah-yeah 

Wounds held inside,
Blown open wide
Open wide 

Let it bleed bleed yeah-yeah 

Wounds held inside, they are
Blown open wide

There's the sound
Of the phone, not ringing
It echoes in my home,
Seeing my friends in a crowd of you 
Tell me why I'm so goddamned alone 
And I felt I could do anything that's why
I made you safe with me 
Say it's not there but across the sea
The stone takes a chunk of change from me 

I can wait, for a long time
Step to me, take a step back boy 
Take a chunk of change again

Just let me go down to the sea 
Where I will breathe breathe yeah-yeah 
Take back your piece of me 
Let it bleed bleed yeah-yeah 

Wounds held inside
Blown open wide
Open wide
