The suckers loose themselves 
In the games they learn to play 
Children love to sing but 
Then their voices slowly fade away 
People always take a step away 
From what is true 
That's why I like you around 
I want you 
Oh you do you do... 
You make me want you 
An open invitation to the dance 
Happenstance set the vibe that we are in 
No apology because my urge is genuine 
And the mystery of your rhythm is so feminine 
Here I am and I want to take a hit 
Of your scent cause it bit so deep into my soul 
I want you 
Yeah, you do you do... 
You make me want you 
Oh you do you do... 
Send me all your vampires 
I want you 
And I can't get enough, oh I can't get enough 
And I can't get enough 
The village church yard is filled with 
Bones weeping in the grave 
The silver lining of clouds 
Shines on people Jesus couldn't save 
You want to know how deeply my soul goes 
Deeper than bones 
Deeper than bones 
And I can't get enough 
Oh, I can't get enough 
Oh, I can't get enough 
Oh, I can't get enough 
After we did it by the window sill 
Smoke rings drift into the midnight sky 
Presently in the quilt that your mother made 
A candle burns to fight off the gloom 
I said to live in this way is not for the meek 
And like a jazz DJ you talk me into sleep 
I said there'll be no regrets when the worms come 
And they will surely come 
You do you do... 
Make me want you 
Send me all your vampires 
Yeah you do... 
Make me want you
