There's a big red sky over you and I 
And it's coming down and we're pumping over ground 
In desert air 
I hope you'll be there 
'Cause it's coming down 
Pumping over ground 
I've seen car wreck kids walk away from it 
I laughed from within 
I know these days will end 
It's been a long time, been a long time 
To walk with the mighty 
I won't be the martyr 
So let me go, let me go 
On my own 
I said it's been a long time, been a long time 
To walk with the mighty 
To walk with the mighty 
So let me go, let me go 
On my own 
I'll make do with none 
I will blame no one 
Slept on packing foam 
I'll make it all my home 
I'll take on anyone 
I'll take on anyone 
I'll take on anyone 
I'll take on anyone 
I'll take on, I'll take on anyone, I'll 
I'll take on anyone 
I'll take on anyone 
I'll take on, I'll take on anyone 
I'll take on anyone 
I'll take on anyone, I'll 
It's been a long time, been a long time 
To walk with the mighty 
I won't be the martyr 
So let me go, let me go 
It's a long time, go 
It's been a long time, been a long time 
To walk with the mighty 
I'm gonna walk with the mighty 
Let me go, let me go 
On my own 
I'll take on anyone 
I'll take on, I'll take on anyone 
I'll take on, I'll take on anyone 
I'll take on anyone, I'll 
These days, they're not done 
The red summer sun
