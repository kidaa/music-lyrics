Lead in night at the Laundromat 
And I'm staring at you pulling clothes from a dryer 
And I'm wondering how I got here 
'Cause it seems some how I keep getting stuck in the mire 
I needed this more than I knew 
And I let you down and I said I'm sorry 
But the light, it falls on my castle walls 
And my basketballs pelt me with bricks in my dreams 
Tonight, well maybe 
What you need I hope it finds you 
Oh I might, I might be, well maybe 
Maybe some day you'll get it right 
If I could bottle my hopes in a store bought scent 
They'd be nutmeg peach and they'd pay the rent 
And I'd ride a horse, and I'd teach a course 
On how I go to be a star crossed pimp 
Get up, get up, yeah 
Oh I might, gonna live forever boy 
Tonight, oh you're a clever boy, well maybe 
No you never say goodnight, oh I might 
I might, well maybe 
What you need I hope it finds you 
Are you a clever boy, gonna live forever boy 
Maybe some day you'll get it right 
Oh I might
