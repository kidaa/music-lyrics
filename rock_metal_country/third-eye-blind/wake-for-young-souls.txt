Today I found my soul
I felt it die inside me yeah
I told you life is like dyno
I have your face in a photo in high school
And you were alive
And that's all I had
And I can't remember who I was myself then
And doesn't help
Still I look to you as a friend
To tell me
Who we are now, who we are
It's who we are now, who we are
Where does time go now on the wake for young souls
Another lullaby go sing oh......

Well the wind that blows 
It's blowing colder
And the child that grows
She's growing older
And the friends we know
They are behind us
But the friends we know
They're growing colder so

It's who we are now, who we are
It's who we are now ,who we are
Where does time go now on the wake for young souls
You tell me, who we are now, who we are
It's who we are now, who we are
Oh no now on the wake for young souls

Cycle of the moon brings blood to the woman
And blood of the woman brings birth of a child
The child grew up
He forgetting something
Birth of a child comes someplace while
Living great days with the shade of the wind
Unbodied, unsouled, unhurt, unseen
On the day of the dead like a song in my head
He speak to me in the shape of a dream
Treating natural bowl like the wind that blows
Follow the direction no matter where it goes
So it shall be the earth and the sea 
Let the truth blow like a hurricane through me

I've been cold, if I've spoken in anger
Two have been born
Forgive me 
No I don't see your Mother
Not like before 
Though she hasn't forgotten 
She doesn't like to be reminded anymore 
Annie got married 
It didn't come without tears 
But the day you died I had laughter for these years

So it's who we are now, who we are
It's who we are now, who we are
Where does time go now on the wake for young souls now
It's who we are now, who we are
it's who we are now, who we are
Oh no now on the wake for young souls

All the things we know
They're gonna fall away from me yeah
Like a grain of sand
Slips through a good friend's hand
