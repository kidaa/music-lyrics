Since I was a little kid 
I tried to get out of my head 
Trapped on the playground 
I would stare at the sky 
I didn't even know why 
But daily life it took an evil shape 
Some conformed 
And some tried to escape 
And those are the misfits that I have known 
Like a sock in the eye 
They feel it to the bone 
It's a joke that we all know 
We're the bait in a horror show 
Yeah we are all alone 
In a horror show 
Banish me and mine to outer space 
I'd shoot there in a second 
Just for the breathing space 
I'd put the punks on the moon 
For head-room 
Mods rule the galaxy 
That's the way I think things should be 
The creep in you is the creep in me 
Gravity presses down like a lie 
We want wild sex 
But we don't want to die 
Do you feel there's no where to go 
We're the bait in a horror show 
And we're all alone in a horror show 
Yeah we are all alone in a horror show 
If I spoke in words of only hate 
Tell me would you now 
Could you relate 
And I, I wish I met Lou Reed 
Out on his darkened sea 
'Cause I felt it when his blood would flow 
But it doesn't take a thousand years to know 
That ship burned a long time ago 
And we're all alone in a horror show 
We're all alone 
We're on our own 
In a horror show
