Just arrived Singapore, San Sebastian, Spain, 26-hour trip. 
Salt Lake City, come in spring. 
Over the salt flats a hailstorm brought you back to me.

Over the salt flats a hailstorm brought you back to me. 

Here it comes I'm carried away 
Here it comes I'm carried away 
Here it comes, back, back. 

Departure, Godspeed, bless his heart, good boy. 
What a fuck-up, what a fighter. 
A free-fall, motorcycle, hang-glider, 
Hung on the line like a poison spider. 
Win a eulogy from William Greider, 
Car crash, ptomaine, disposable lighter, 
A bus plunge, avalanche, a vinegar cider. 
Free-fall, motorcycle, hang-glider. 

Here it comes I'm carried away 
Here it comes I'm carried away 
Here it comes, back, back. 

Go, go, go, go, yeah. 

Well, everybody is young forever. 
There's so much to tell you, so little time. 
I've come a long way since the whatever, 
shit, I still see a word, think of you. 
There is so much that I can't do, yeah. 
You will be young forever. 
There's so much that I can't do. 
There is so much that I can't do. 

Here it comes I'm carried away 
Here it comes I'm carried away 
Here it comes, back, back.
