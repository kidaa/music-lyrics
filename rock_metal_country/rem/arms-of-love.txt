Arms Of Love 
Robin Hitchcock - R.E.M.'s version appeared on the CD single for "Man On The Moon." a solo version by Michael Stipe also was included on the 1993 "In Defense of Animals" CD 

Maybe tonight you're achin' 
For someone you're dreamin' of 
Tomorrow you'll be wakin 
Into the Arms, into the arms of Love 

Maybe tonight you're cryin 
Like a poor wounded dove 
Tell me you'll soon be flying 
Into the Arms, into the arms of love 

Maybe tonight you're takin 
You couldn't get enough 
Honey you'll soon be wakin' 
Into the Arms, into the arms of Love 

Maybe the world is falling 
It wasn't strong enough 
Tell me you'll soon be crawling 
Into the Arms, into the arms of Love
