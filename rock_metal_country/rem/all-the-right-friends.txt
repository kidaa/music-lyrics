All The Right Friends 

I know you say 
Maybe some day 
I need never be alone 
I know I say 
It's the right way 
But you'll never be the one 

I've been so alone now 
For a long long, long time 
I don't wanna hang out now 
With the folks that just stopped by 

While you party 
You've been looking 
But your searching never ends 
You've been going 
With the wrong crowd 
You've got all the right friends 

I've been walking alone now 
For a long, long time 
I don't want to spend now 
With the folks...that just aren't 
mine 

I don't wanna be with you anymore 
I just don't want you anymore 
I don't wanna be with you anymore 
I just don't want you anymore 

Rave on! 
Fall to...fall to...fall to...fall too 
Fall to...fall to...fall to...fall too 

I don't wanna be with you anymore 
I just don't want you anymore 
I don't wanna be with you anymore 
I just don't want you anymore 

I know you say 
maybe some day 
I need never be alone 
I know I say it's the right way, 
but you'll never be alone 

I 've been walking alone now 
for a long long time 
I don't gotta hang out 
with the folks that just aren't mine 

I don't wanna be with you anymore 
I just don't want you anymore 
I don't wanna be with you anymore 
I just don't want you anymore
