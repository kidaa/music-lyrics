Yeah, all the stars drip down like butter, 
Wromises are sweet, 
We hold out our pans, lift our hands to catch them. 
We eat them up, drink them up, up, up, up 

Hey, let me in. 
Hey, let me in. 

I only wish that I could hear you whisper down, 
Mister fisherman, to a less peculiar ground. 
He gathered up his loved ones and he brought them all around 
To say goodbye, nice try. 

Hey, let me in. yeah yeah yeah 
Hey, let me in. Let me in. 

I had a mind to try to stop you. Let me in. Let me in. 
I've got tar on my feet and I can't see. 
All the birds look down and laugh at me. 
Clumsy, crawling out of my skin. 

Hey, let me in. yeah yeah yeah 
Hey, let me in. 
Hey, let me in. yeah yeah yeah 
Hey, let me in.
