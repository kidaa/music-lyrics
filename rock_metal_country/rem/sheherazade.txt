Sheherazade

You say you make her feel all right 
She says she wants you, but not tonight 
You know the girl is telling lies 
You try some magic in her eye 

When you not there other guys come sticking around 
And when you ask her what's going on 
She'll only push you around 

Say you don't want to talk about it 
She'll tell you stories...she can bet 

You know the girl ...she's telling lies 
You try some magic in her eyes 

But when you're not there other guys come sticking around 
When you ask her what's going on 
She'll only push you around 
Put you down 

You can say what you want 
but she's SHEHERAZADE 
And you don't mind 
And you call when she calls 
You pay the price 
You're bound to fall 
And all the lies don't matter at all 

You say you don't want to talk about it 
She'll tell you stories 
You can die 
You know the girl is telling lies 
You try some magic in her eye 

But when you're not there other guys come sticking around 
And when you ask her what's going on 
She'll only push you around 
Put you down 

You can say what you want 
She's SHEHERAZADE
