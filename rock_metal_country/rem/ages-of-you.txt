Postcard stowaway within 
Pristine indigo without 
Banded ottoman as such 
Sofa seated one too much 

All along the range all along the range 
Ages of you 

Train pulls over hanging bridge 
Conductor looks up, thinks 
out and down, hands stuck to the left 
to the right, you should fall, 
the horses just don't gossip anymore
