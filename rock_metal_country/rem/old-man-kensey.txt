Old Man Kensey wants to be a sign painter 

First he's got to learn to read 
He's gonna be a clown on TV 
Flexes his elbow taunt and free 
That's my folly, I believe 
Drink up the lake Kensey's awake 
That's my folly, that's my mistake 

Old Man Kensey wants to be a goalie 
First he's got to learn to count 
He's gonna be a clown on a circus mount 
Letters to be signed and dropped off 
Kensey's going far 
John, Bill and Ed, stand on your head 
That's my folly, I'm ready to go 

Old Man Kensey wants to be a dog catcher 
First he's got to learn to stand 
He's gonna be a clown in a marching band 
Letters to be signed ransom greed 
That's my folly, I believe 
Drink up the lake, John, Bill and Ed, 
That's my folly, that's my mistake 
Kensey's awake, stand on your head 
That's my folly, I'm ready to go
