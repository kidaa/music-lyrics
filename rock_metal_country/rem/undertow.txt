I know what I wanted 
I know what I wanted 
I know how I wanted this to be 

You go down to the water 
Drink down of the water 
Walk up off the water, leave it be 

This is not my time, brother 
It is cold in heaven 
And I'm not sprouting wings. 

I'm drowning 
Me 
I'm drowning 
Me, yeah 

Brother can you see those birds 
They don't look to heaven 
They don't need religion, they can see 

They go down to the water 
Drink down on the water 
Fly up off the water, leave it be 

This is not my time, sister 
It is cold in heaven 
And no one's coming after me 

I'm drowning 
Breathing ourselves 
Me 
Breathing ourselves 
I'm drowning 
Breathing ourselves 
Me, yeah 

You know I am tired 
Cold and bony tired 
Nothing's gonna save me, I can see 

I can't say I'm fearful 
I can't say I'm not afraid 
But I am not resisting, I can see 

I don't need a heaven 
I don't need religion 
I am in the place where I should be 

I am breathing water 
I am breathing water 
You know a body's got to breathe 

I'm drowning 
Breathing ourselves 
Me 
Breathing ourselves 
I'm drowning 
Breathing ourselves 
Me, yeah
