It's the End Of the World as We Know It And I Feel Fine  

That's great, it starts with an earthquake, birds and snakes,  
an aeroplane - Lenny Bruce is not afraid.  
Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn,  
world serves its own needs, dummy serve your own needs.  
Feed it off an aux speak,, grunt, no, strength,  
The ladder starts to clatter with fear fight down height.  
Wire in a fire, representing seven games, a government for hire and a combat site.  
Left of west and coming in a hurry with the furies breathing down your neck.  
Team by team reporters baffled, trumped, tethered cropped.  
Look at that low playing! 
Fine, then.  
Uh oh, overflow, population, common food, but it'll do.  
Save yourself, serve yourself. World serves its own needs, listen to your heart 
bleed dummy with the rapture and the revered and the right - right.  
You vitriolic, patriotic, slam, fight, bright light, feeling pretty psyched.  

It's the end of the world as we know it.  
It's the end of the world as we know it.  
It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine.  

Six o'clock - TV hour. Don't get caught in foreign towers. 
Slash and burn, return, listen to yourself churn.  
Locking in, uniforming, book burning, blood letting.  
Every motive escalate. Automotive incinerate.  
Light a candle, light a votive. Step down, step down.  
Watch your heel crush, crushed. Uh-oh, this means no fear cavalier. 
Renegade steer clear! A tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies.  
Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives and I decline.  

It's the end of the world as we know it.  
It's the end of the world as we know it. It's time I had some time alone  
It's the end of the world as we know it It's time I had some time alone and I feel fine.  
I feel fine  

It's the end of the world as we know it. It's time I had some time alone  
It's the end of the world as we know it. It's time I had some time alone  
It's the end of the world as we know it It's time I had some time alone and I feel fine.  

The other night I dreamt of knives, continental drift divide. Mountains sit in a 
line 
Leonard Bernstein. Leonid Brezhnev. Lenny Bruce and Lester Bangs.  
Birthday party, cheesecake, jelly bean, boom!  
You symbiotic, patriotic, slam book neck, right? Right.  

It's the end of the world as we know it. It's time I had some time alone  
It's the end of the world as we know it. It's time I had some time alone  
It's the end of the world as we know it It's time I had some time alone and I feel fine.  

It's the end of the world as we know it.  
It's the end of the world as we know it.  
It's the end of the world as we know it It's time I had some time alone and I feel fine.  

It's the end of the world as we know it. It's time I had some time alone  
It's the end of the world as we know it. It's time I had some time alone  
It's the end of the world as we know it It's time I had some time alone and I feel fine.  

It's the end of the world as we know it. It's time I had some time alone  
It's the end of the world as we know it. It's time I had some time alone  
It's the end of the world as we know it It's time I had some time alone and I feel fine...
