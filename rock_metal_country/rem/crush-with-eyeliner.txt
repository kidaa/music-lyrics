I know you 
I know you've seen her 
She's a sad tomato 
She's three miles of bad road 
Walking down the street 
Will I never meet her 
She's a real woman child 
Oh my kiss breath turpentine 

I am smitten 
I'm the real thing I'm the real thing 
Have you seen her come around 
My crush with eyeliner 

I'm in like. 
I'm in-fatuated. 
It's all too much-the pressure 
She's all that I can take 
What position should I wear 
Cop an attitude - You faker 
How can I convince her - Faker 
That I'm invented too, yeah 

I am smitten 
I'm the real thing I'm the real thing 
We all invent ourselves and, 
Uh, you know me 

She's a sad tomato 
She's three miles of bad road 
She's her own invention 
That gets me in the throat 
What can I make myself be 
Life is strange, yeah life is strange 
What can I make myself be - Faker 
To make her mine 

I am smitten 
I'll do anything I'll do anything 
Oh kiss breath turpentine 
My crush with eyeliner 

I am smitten 
And you know me, yeah 
You know me 
I could be your Frankenstein 
My crush with eyeliner 

I am smitten 
I'm the real thing I'm the real thing 
Won't you be my valentine 
My crush with eyeliner
