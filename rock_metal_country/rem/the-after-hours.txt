The After Hours 
Velvet Underground original - Stipe's variation below. R.E.M. frequently closed Green Tour shows with this song - a live version appears on the CD single for "Losing My Religion" and in the video for "Tourfilm" 

If you close the door 
the night could last forever. 
Say goodbye to now 
and say hello to never. 
I've said it before, I'll say it again. 
You know it can happen to me. 
But if we close the door 
I'll never have to see the world again.
