Moon River 
Jerry Butler. A version by R.E.M. appears on the I.R.S. Years extended version of "Reckoning" in Europe in the early 1990's 

Moon River, wider than a mile 
I'm crossing you in style some day 
You dream maker 
You heartbreaker 
Wherever you're going 
I'm going your way 

Two drifters off to see the world 
There's such a lot of world to see 
We're after the same rainbow's end 
Waitin' round the bend 
My Huckleberry friend 
Moon River and me
