as the sun comes up, as the moon 
goes down 
these heavy notions creep around 
it makes me think 
long ago I was brought into 
this life a little lamb 
a little lamb 
courageous, stumbling 
fearless was my middle name. 
but somewhere there I 
lost my way 
everyone walks the same 
expecting me to step 
the narrow path they've laid 
they claim to 
walk unafraid 
I'll be clumsy instead 
hold my love me or leave me 
high. 

say  keep within the boundaries if you want 
to play.  
say  contradiction only makes it harder.  
how can I be 
what I want to be 
when all I want to do is strip away 
these stilled constraints 
and crush this charade 
shred this sad masquerade 
I don't need no persuading 
I'll trip, fall, pick myself up and 
walk unafraid 
I'll be clumsy instead 
hold my love me or leave me 
high. 

if I have a bag of rocks to carry as I go 
I just want to hold my head up high 
I don't care what I have to step over 
I'm prepared to look you in the eye 
look me in the eye 
and if you see familiarity 
then celebrate the contradiction 
help me when I fall to 
walk unafraid 
I'll be clumsy instead 
hold my love me or leave me 
high. 
walk unafraid 
I'll be clumsy instead 
hold my love me or leave me 
high.
