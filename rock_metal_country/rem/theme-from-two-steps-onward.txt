Theme From Two Steps Onward

If you hear this...look again 
Don't be a stranger 
Don't be a shadow to this boy 

A penny on it's side 
Write a letter...give a call 
Let me know you're alive 
And doing well 
A quarter past three 
The quarter you live in haunts my eyes 

I'm hand over head 
I'm held over hand 
I'm hand over head over heels over you 

Write a letter, give a call 
Let me know you're alive 
And doing well 
It's everything for two 
Don't be a stranger 
Don't be a shadow to this boy 

A quarter past three 
A quarter past... 
The quarter you live in haunts my eyes 

I'm hand over head 
I'm held over hand 
I'm hand over head over heels over you 

Write a letter...give a call 
Let me know you're alive 
And doing well 
It's everything for two 
Don't be a stranger 
Don't be a shadow to this boy 

I'll give you a kiss 
I'll give you a hug 
I'll tell you a secret that's no lie 
Don't be a stranger 
Don't be a shadow 
Don't be a shadow to this boy
