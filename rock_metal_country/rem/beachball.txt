Tonight's alive
The beachball's set to fly
Those well tequilaed guys
Who smile at strangers.

A tes souhaits
A tes amours chri
You give a little squeeze
And dance the rua-rua-rua-rumba
This life is sweet
You're dancing in the street
Who knows who you might meet
Who to find.

The little week ends here
Thursday has an ear
The coffee clash career
She talks to strangers
And kissing by the sea.

A tequila tome
'ti punch, mojito, sling
And dance the rua-rua-rua-rumba
This life is sweet
You're dancing in the street
Who knows who you might meet
Who to find.

We flash the seasoned sky
With starfished butterflies
To cast a spell
And welcome locals
Weekenders and strangers.

You'll do fine.
You'll do fine.
You'll do fine.
