They crowded up to Lenin with their noses worn off 
A handshake is worthy if it's all that you've got 
Metal shoes on wood push through our back 
There's a splinter in your eye and it reads  REACT  

They shifted the statues for harboring ghosts 
Reddened their necks, collared their clothes 
Then we danced the dance till the menace got out 
She gathered the corners and called it her gown 

Please find my harborcoat, can't go outside without it 
Find my harborcoat, can't go outside without it 
They crowded up to Lenin with their noses worn off 
A handshake is worthy if it's all that you've got

There's a splinter in your eye and it reads  REACT , R-E-A-C-T 

They shifted the statues for harboring ghosts 
Reddened their necks, collared their clothes 
Then we danced the dance till the menace got out 
She gathered the corners and called it her gown
