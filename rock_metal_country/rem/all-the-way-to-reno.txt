Humming
All the way to reno
Dusted the non-believers
And challenge the laws of chance

Now sweeter
You're so sugar sweet
You may as well have 'kick me'
Fastened on your sleeve

You know what you are
You're gonna be a star.
You know what you are
You're gonna be a star

Wing is written on your feet
Your achilles heel
Is the tendency to dream
But you've know that from the beginning
You didn't have to go so far
You didn't have to go.

You know what you are
You're gonna be a star.
You know what you are
You're gonna be a star

You know who you are
You know who you are
You know who you are

Humming
All the way to reno
You've written your own directions
And whistles the rules have changed

You know what you are
You're gonna be a star star
You know what you are,
You're gonna be a star star
You know what you are,
You're gonna be a star star
You know what you are,
You're gonna be a star star

Humming
All the way to reno
All the way to reno
All the way to reno
You're gonna be a star
You're gonna be a star
You're gonna be a star
You're gonna be a star
