Sponge

by Vic Chestnutt - from the 1996 "Sweet Relief II" CD benefiting Vic Chestnutt. the song also appeared on the CD single for "How The West Was Won And Where It Got Us" 

pleasure is melting like chocolate 
my blue ribbon gumption is gone 
all my gravy must have soaked into something 
and the world... 
the filthy steps, the cold concrete 
the phony earth below my feet 
the ancient odor of the streets 
yes the world it is a sponge 
and when the crisis passes 
when the coast is clear 
I'll be buffed down to a liquid 
and the world it is a sponge 
throughout this entire ugly outing 
I've been mumbling the convex of what I should be shouting 
but I'll soon be silent you'll soon hear nothing 
'cause the world it is a sponge
