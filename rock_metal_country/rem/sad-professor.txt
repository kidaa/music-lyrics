if we're talking about love 
then I have to tell you 
dear readers, I'm not sure where I'm headed. 
I've gotten lost before. 
I've woke up stone drunk 
face down in the floor. 

late afternoon, the house is hot. 
I started, I jumped up. 
everyone hates a bore. 
everyone hates a drunk. 

this may be a lit invention 
professors muddled in their intent 
to try to rope in followers 
to float their malcontent. 
as for this reader, 
I'm already spent. 

late afternoon, the house is hot. 
I started, I jumped up. 
everyone hates a sad professor. 
I hate where I wound up. 

dear readers, my apologies. 
I'm drifting in and out of sleep. 
long silence presents the tragedies 
of love. note the age. get afraid. 
the surface hazy with attendant thoughts. 
a lazy eye metaphor on the rocks. 

late afternoon, the house is hot. 
I started, I jumped up. 
everyone hates a bore. 
everyone hates a drunk. 
everyone hates a sad professor. 
I hate where I wound up. 
I hate where I wound up
