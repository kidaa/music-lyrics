Movin' through rough waters motel boy, 
And swimming in your sleep. 
How could I be so blind, mis-sighted, 
Not to see there's something wounded deep. 

Anyone could scratch your surface now, 
It's all amphetamine 
You're blasting yourself into the present 
Learn some vast indignity, stay that, 

You say that you hate it 
You want to re-create it 
I've been around, I've been your lover. 
I let it go at Kill Devil Hill, 
You're coming onto something so fast, so numb 
That you can't even feel. 

You're drinking the wrong dream now baby, 
You do-si-do, saddo 
You're you in cartilage, shark-eyed, shock horror, all present tense, 
And boy your blood is running cold. 
Listen, this is now, this is here, this is me, 
This is what I wanted you to see. 
That was then, was that, that is gone, this is past, 
You cast yourself cast, passed by, gone down fast. 

You say that you hate it. 
You want to recreate it. 
I've played this round, I've played your lover. 
I've played it out to the hilt. 
You're comin' on with something so fast, so numb 
That you can't even feel. 

You love it. You hate it. 
You want to re-create it. 
Now, this is here, this is me. 
This is what I wanted you to see. 
That was then, was that, that is gone. 
That is what I wanted you to feel. 

You love it. You hate it. 
You spit it out, the bitter pill. 
I've been around, I've been your lover 
I let it go at Kill Devil Hill. 
You're coming onto something so fast, so numb 
That you can't even feel. 

I've played this round, I've played your lover. 
I've played it out to the hilt. 
You're comin' on with something so fast, so numb 
That you can't even feel. 

you played around, you played me lover, 
I let it go at Kill Devil Hill, 
You're moving so hard, so fast, so numb 
That you can't even feel.
