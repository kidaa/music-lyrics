It's A Free World Baby 
an "Out of Time" outtake, later release as an import B-side for "Drive." Later on the _Coneheads_ soundtrack. 

I was hungry when I said 
I never got to sleep 
You go ahead 
You can get whatever you want 
There's a feeling in my belly 
It's the new tomorrow scene 
It's an interesting job 
It's the fireworks 

CHORUS 
I don't need it I don't need it 
I hit my head he hit his head 
I can't feel anything 
You gave too much away 
You came to say 
It's a free world baby 
And you gave too much away 

get whatever you want 

Me, I'm tired of this candy 
My teeth ache my head 
Boys in bed, girls in bed 
All now go to sleep 
Sleep, sweet dreams 
Wake to a new today tomorrow 

CHORUS 

Boys in bed, girls in bed 
All now go to sleep 
Sleep, sweet dreams 
Wake to a new today tomorrow 
Sleep, sweet dreams 
Wake to a new today tomorrow 

CHORUS 

repeat last verse
