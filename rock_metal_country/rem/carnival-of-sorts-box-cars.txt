There's a secret stigma, reaping wheel. 
Diminish, a carnival of sorts. 
Chronic town, poster torn, reaping wheel. 
Stranger, stranger to these parts. 

Gentlemen don't get caught, cages under cage. Gentlemen don't get caught, 
Boxcars are pulling out of town. Boxcars are pulling out of town. 
Boxcars are pulling out of town. 

repeat 1st verse and chorus 

Cages under, cages under, cages under cage. 
Cages under, cages under, cages under cage. 

repeat chorus 

There's a secret stigma, reaping wheel. 
Stranger, stranger to these parts. 
Chronic town, poster torn, reaping wheel. 
Diminish, stranger.
