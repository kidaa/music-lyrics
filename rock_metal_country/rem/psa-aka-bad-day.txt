Psa A.K.A. Bad Day 
studio demo from "Life's Rich Pageant" sessions 

A public service announcement followed me home the other day, 
I bade it nevermind, go away. 
The shit's so thick, you could stir it with a stick, 
the paper wouldn't lie, we assume the loss to mankind and gloat and jeer with it 

Broadcast me a joyful noise into the times, Lord, 
count your blessings, ignore the lowest fear, well you can't sandblast glisten, 

Radio no, play the game, three words, first one short, 
magazine, book, cinema, N - O - down, 
many fears are gone, step down, step down, 
watch a heel crush, ah this means war 

I saw the light, it can't be right 

Broadcast me a joyful noise into the times, Lord, 
count your blessings, ignore the lowest fear, well you can't sandblast 

It's been a bad day, please don't take my picture, 
It's been a bad day, please 
It's been a bad day, please don't take my picture, 
It's been a bad day, please

Broadcast me a joyful noise into the times, Lord, 
count your blessings, ignore the lowest fear, come one, what more? 

It's been a bad day, please don't take my picture, 
It's been a bad day, please
