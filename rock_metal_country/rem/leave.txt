Nothing could be bring me closer. 
Nothing could be bring me near. 
Where is the road I follow 
Believing, leave. 

It's under, under, under my feet. 
The scene spread out there before me. 
Better I go where the land touches sea. 
There is my trust in what I believe. 

That's what keeps me, 
That's what keeps me, 
That's what keeps me down, 
To leave it, believe it, 
Leave it all behind. 

Shifting the dream 
Nothing could bring me further from my old friend time 
Shifting the dream 
Charging the scene 
I know where I marked the signs 
Suffer the dreams of a world gone mad 
I like it like that and I know it 

I know it well, ugly and sweet 
A temper man who said believe in his dream. 

That's what keeps me 
That's what keeps me 
That's what keeps me down 
I sent it on an airline plane 
I sent it off in an airplane 
That never left the ground. 

That's what keeps me, 
That's what keeps me, 
That's what keeps me down, 
To leave it, believe it. 
Leave it all behind. 

Lift me, lift me, 
I attain my dream. 
I lost myself, I lost them. 
heartache calling me. 
I lost myself in sorrow 
I lost myself in pain. 
I lost myself in gravity, 
Memory, leave, leave. 

That's what keeps me, 
That's what keeps me, 
That's what keeps me down, 
To leave it, believe it, 
Leave it all behind. 

That's what keeps me, 
That's what keeps me, 
That's what keeps me down, 
To leave it, believe it, 
Leave it all behind. 

and if my hands, my eyes are still 
I walk into the scene 
Shoot myself in a different place 
Leavin' 

Longed for this to take me, 
Longed for my release 
Waited for the coming 
Leavin', leave. 

Leave, leave. 
Leavin', leavin'
