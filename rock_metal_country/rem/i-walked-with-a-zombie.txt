I Walked With A Zombie 
R.E.M.'s version of this Roky Erickson tune was featured on the 1990 tribute album "Where The Pyramid Meets The Eye" - this song features all members of R.E.M. taking turns on the repeating refrain, including a rare vocal appearance at the end by Peter Buck 

I walked with a Zombie. 
I walked with a Zombie. 
I walked with a Zombie last night.
