There's a problem, feathers iron 
Bargain buildings, weights and pullyes 
Feathers hit the ground before the weight can leave the air 
Buy the sky and sell the sky and tell the sky and tell the sky 

Don't fall on me What is it up in the air for It's gonna fall 
Fall on me If it's there for long It's gonna fall 
Fall on me It's over it's over me It's gonna fall 

There's the progress we have found when the rain 
A way to talk around the problem when the children reign 
Building towered foresight keep your conscience in the dark 
isn't anything at all melt the statues in the park 
Buy the sky and sell the sky and bleed the sky and tell the sky 

Don't fall on me What is it up in the air for It's gonna fall 
Fall on me If it's there for long It's gonna fall 
Fall on me It's over it's over me It's gonna fall 
Don't fall on me 

Well I could keep it above 
But then it wouldn't be sky anymore 
So if I send it to you you've got to promise to keep it whole 

Buy the sky and sell the sky and lift your arms up to the sky 
And ask the sky and ask the sky 

Don't fall on me What is it up in the air for It's gonna fall 
Fall on me If it's there for long It's gonna fall 
Fall on me It's over it's over me It's gonna fall 

Repeat and fade out
