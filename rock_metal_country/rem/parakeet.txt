you wake up in the morning 
and fall out of your bed 
mean cats eat parakeets 
and this one's nearly dead. 
you dearly wish the wind would shift 
and greasy windows slide 
open for the parakeet 
who's colored bitter lime. 

open the window 
and lift into your dreams 
lately, baby 
you can barely breathe. 

a broken wrist 
an accident 
you know that something's wrong 
you fold the leavings of your past 
no one knows you've gone. 
the sunspot flares of the early 
nineties light up your wings. 
and scan the shortwave radio 
it's tracking outer rings. 

the tectonic dispatcher shifts 
to smooth the ocean floor 
and flattens out to warmer winds 
of Brisbane's sunny shore. 
where buddhas tend to mending wrists 
a tea made from the leaves 
of eucalyptus fragrances 
and coriander seeds. 

you wake up in the morning 
to warm Pacific breeze 
where mean cats chew on licorice 
and cannot climb the trees. 

open your window 
and lift into a dream 
baby, baby 
baby starts to breathe
