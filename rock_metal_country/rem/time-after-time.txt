Ask the girl of the hour by the water tower's watch 
If your friends took a fall, are you obligated to follow 

Time after time after time 
when the bull's on his hooves, when you gather friends by the tower 
If you try to refuse, will they judge your worth by the hour 

If your tired and you're tried you can find me in my room 
You can stay if you want and the third time you can't lose 

Ask the girl of the hour, by the water tower's watch 
We can fight if you want but who will turn out the light
