Hey, Hey, Nadine 
a.k.a. Small Town Girl... 

Pretty blond hair swinging as she walks 
Child-like smile glistens as she talks 
Dangerous eyes in a small town girl 
Seen everything all around the world 

If I could only make her see my way 
Maybe we could spend a while some day 
in a place far away from here 

repeat verse 

Hey, Hey, Nadine 
She's a good girl 
Hey, Hey, Nadine 
She's got me in a whirl 
Hey, Hey, Nadine 
She's okay 

repeat verse 

Hey, Hey, Nadine 
She's a good girl 
Hey, Hey, Nadine 
She's got me in a whirl 
Hey, Hey, Nadine 
She's such a pretty girl
