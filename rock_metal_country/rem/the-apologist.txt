they call me the apologist. 
and now that I'm at peak. 
you know at first it really hurt. 
we joke about these things. 
I've skirted all my differences 
but now I'm facing up. 
I wanted to apologize for 
everything I was. so 
I'm sorry, so sorry... 

did you understand me right 
the people here are good. 
they tell me what I should have done 
and offer what I could. 
I'm good, all is good 
all's well, no complaints. 
when I feel regret, 
I get down on my knees and pray. 
I'm sorry, so sorry... 

I live a simple life 
unfettered by complex sweets. 
you think this isn't me 
don't be weak. 
there I go. 
I'm so sorry. 

thank you for being there for me. 
thank you for listening, goodbye. 
I can forfeit selfishness 
I hope for you that you apply 
this happiness 
this peacefulness 
I'm sorry, so sorry... 

I live a simple life 
unfettered by complex sweets. 
you think this isn't me 
that's so sweet. 
I'm so sorry
