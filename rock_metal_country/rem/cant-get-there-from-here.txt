Cant Get There From Here 

When the world is a monster 
Bad to swallow you whole 
Kick the clay that holds the teeth in 
Throw your trolls out the door 

If you're needing inspiration 
Philomath is where I go 
Lawyer Jeff he knows the low-down 
He's mighty bad to visit home 

I've been there I know the way 
Can't get there from here 
I've been there I know the way 
Can't get there from here 
I've been there I know the way 
Can't get there from here 
I've been there I know the way 

When your hands are feeling empty 
Stick heads jumping off the ground 
Tris is sure to shirr the deers out 
Brother Ray can sing my song 

I've been there I know the way 
Can't get there from here 
I've been there I know the way 
Can't get there from here 
I've been there I know the way 
Can't get there from here, here, here 
I've been there I know the way 

Hands down, Calechee bound 
Land-locked, kiss the ground 
The dirt of seven continents going 
round and round 
Go on ahead Mr. Citywide 
hypnotize, suit and tied 
Gentlemen testify 

If the world is a monster 
Bad to swallow you whole 
Philomath they know the low-down 
Throw your trolls out the door 

I've been there I know the way 
Can't get there from here 
I've been there I know the way 
Can't get there from here 
I've been there I know the way 
Can't get there from here 
I've been there I know the way 
Can't get there from here 
I've been there I know the way 
Can't get there from here 
I've been there I know the way 
Can't get there from here 
I've been there I know the way 
Can't get there from here 
I've been there I know the way 

Thank you, Ray
