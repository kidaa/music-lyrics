Narrator

When I was watching TV back in '73 
A skinny old man sure appealed to me 
His name by now, I'm sure you know 
The man who played a starring role in Jacques Cousteau 

And ever since then I've written the dude 
Dreaming of swimming around the 
coral reef 
I'd even bought my camera and my scuba gear 
If only Jacques had called to stop a career 

I wanna be a narrator 
For the Jacques Cousteau show 

Swimming under water with my microphone 
I'd record noises in the aqua-zone 
Chasing down the killer whale that's eating our crew 
Just to bring the story facts back to you 

I wanna be a narrator 
For the Jacques Cousteau show 

I've written the networks, sent my picture too 
Done everything I could possibly do 
I've given up trying to get through to him 
Maybe he knows I don't know how to swim 

I wanna be a narrator 
For the Jacques Cousteau show
