you wanted a challenge that's calling you higher I landed on my feet by crawling I 
remember standing alone trying to forget you idling I hate to admit that that's my 
reference point but there it is you say you want me 

I'm what you found I'm upside down you're in the air you're in the air and I am breathing 

brighten the stars the weather is lifting the heavens love a love like this it's pulling 
you higher twist it and turn this around it lights from within it dribbles your chin now 
brings a smile I'm lost again I'm lost again 

I'm what you found I'm upside down you're in the air you're in the air and I am breathing 
you 

I want the stars to know they've won if only to beguile the sky has opened up again in 
heaven reconciled I want you naked I want you wild I want the stars to know they win 
give me that smile just give it me just turn it on I'm lost again 

I'm what you found I'm upside down you're in the air I'm what you found I'm upside down 
you're in the air I'm what you found I'm upside down you're everywhere you're in the air 
and I am breathing you
