Readying to bury your father and your mother, 
what did you think when you lost another 
I used to wonder why did you bother, 
distanced from one, blind to the other 

Listen here my sister and my brother 
what would you care if you lost the other 
I always wonder why did we bother, 
distanced from one, deaf to the other. 

Oh, oh, but sweetness follows 

It's these little things, they can pull you under. 
Live your life filled with joy and wonder. 
I always knew this altogether thunder 
was lost in our little lives. 

Oh, oh, but sweetness follows. 
Oh, oh, but sweetness follows. 

It's these little things, they can pull you under. 
Live your life filled with joy and thunder. 
Yeah, yeah we were altogether 
lost in our little lives. 

Oh. Oh. Ah. 

Oh, oh, but sweetness follows.
