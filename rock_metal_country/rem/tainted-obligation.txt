Tainted Obligation 
author unknown - performed by the Community Trolls, a.k.a. Michael Stipe and Mathew Sweet 

I saw the shoals at night, with the moon above. 
I felt an obligation, and heard your voice again. 
If you were here once, you were here a hundred times. 
If I reached out tonight, I found I couldn't fight it. 
If you were here once, you were here a hundred times. 
Ohhhhhh 

Best as a wishing star, I saw you better far away, 
and I felt obligation, and heard your voice again. 
Hear the rush of water, passing over the shoals. 
Hear my heartbeat rather, if I reached out tonight. 
If I reach out tonight and find I can't fight it, 
and look to the stars, and wander towards a 

heartfelt obligation, a place that you called home 
and heard your voice again, but it's too late. 
You left long ago, and now you're probably dead and gone, 
and I'm left here with the water and the shoals and a tainted obligation. 
Ohhhhhh
