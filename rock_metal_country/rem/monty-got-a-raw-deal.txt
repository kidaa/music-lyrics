Monty this seems strange to me. 
The movies had that movie thing, 
but nonsense has a welcome ring 
and heroes don't come easy. 

Now, nonsense isn't new to me. 
I know my head, I know my feet, 
but mischief knocked me in the knees. 
Said, Just let go. Just let go. 

I saw the ocean meet the man. 
I saw you buried in the sand. 
A friend was there to hold your hand, 
Said, Walk on by. 

So, I went walking through the street. 
I saw you strung up in a tree. 
A woman knelt there said to me, 
said, Hold your tongue, man. Hold your tongue. 

You don't owe me anything. 
You don't want this sympathy. [waste your breath] 
Don't you waste your breath. [waste your breath] 
for the silver screen. 

That nonsense doesn't mean a thing, 
they tried to bust you in a sting, 
but virtue isn't everything 
so, don't waste time. 

Now, here's a rhyme that you can steal. 
Put this on your reel to reel. 
Mischief threw a rotten deal. 
Monty's laying low, man. 
He is laying low. 
Just let go, y'all. 
Just let go. 

You don't owe me anything. 
You don't want this sympathy. [waste your breath] 
Don't you waste your breath. [waste your breath]
