Have you seen
Have not will travel
Have I missed the big reveal
Do my eyes,
Do my eyes seem empty
I've forgotten how this feels.

I've been high
I've climbed so high
The light, sometimes it washes over me.

Have you been
Have done will travel
I fell down on me knees

Was I wrong
I don't know, don't answer.
I just needed to believe.

I've been high
I've climbed so high
The light, sometimes it washes over me.

So I dive into a pool.
So cool and deep that if I sink I sink,
And when I swim I fly, so high.

What I want
All I really wanted
Just to live my life on high.

And I know
I know you want the same
I can see it in your eyes.

I've been high
I've climbed so high
The light, sometimes it washes over me.

Washes over me
I close my eyes
So I can see
Make my make believe, believe in me.
