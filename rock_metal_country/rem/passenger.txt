Passenger
original by Iggy Pop - Stipe's variation below, as recorded live and on the CD single for "At My Most Beautiful" 

I am the passenger 
and I ride and I ride 
I ride through the city's backside 
and everything will be alright 
and everything is yours and mine tonight.

I am the passenger 
yeah I ride and I ride 
I ride through the city's backside 
I ride through the city at night 
and everything is yours and mine 
and everything is yours and mine 
and everything is yours and mine tonight.

I am the passenger 
yeah I ride and I ride 
I ride through the city at night 
I ride through this torn-down side 
and everything is yours and mine 
mark out what's yours and mine 
we'll make what's yours and mine tonight 
we'll make what's yours and mine tonight 

everything will be alright 
yeah everything will be alright 
everything will be alright tonight.
