Your eyes are burning holes through me. 
I'm gasoline. 
I'm burnin' clean. 

Twentieth century go and sleep. 
You're plasticine. 
That is obscene. 
That is obscene. 

You are the star tonight. 
You shine electric outta sight. 
You light eclipsed the moon tonight. 
Elecrolite. You're outta sight. 

If I ever want to fly. 
Mulholland Drive. 
I am alive. 

Hollywood is under me. 
I'm Martin Sheen 
I'm Steve McQueen 
I'm Jimmy Dean 

You are the star tonight. 
You shine electric outta sight. 
You light eclipsed the moon tonight. 
Elecrolite. 
You're outta sight. 

If you want to fly. 
Mulholland Drive. 
Up in the sky. 
Stand on a cliff and look down there. 
Don't be scared, you are alive. 
You are alive. 

You are the star tonight. 
You shine electric outta sight. 
You light eclipsed the moon tonight. 
Elecrolite. 
You're outta sight. 

Twentieth century go and sleep. 
Really deep. 
We won't blink 

You're eyes are burnin' holes through me. 
I'm not scared 
I'm outta here. 
I'm not scared. 
I'm outta here.
