This is horror movie stuff. 
The muffin is peach, you're 'makin' love'. 
You mean this opera involves handcuffs 
I lay defeated. 
Yeah, sour milk mouth, horseradish sweet. 
She's a girl and she's loving me. 
But distance is my tendency. 
I am defeated. 

have you lost your place 
I wore my doormat face. 
I hung my this or that. 
I laid my welcome mat. 

If I'm your oyster, where's the war 
You leave me gasping, tattered and torn. 
I know you can't find a fork. 
I am just a little acorn. 
Well, acorns grow to mighty trees. 
You've got sauce, but you don't have knees. 
Now look who's asking pretty please. 
I lay defeated. 

Have you lost your place 
I wore my doormat face. 
I hung my this or that. 
I laid my welcome mat. 

Call your bathroom friends around. 
I will fake a little frown. 
I will be your little clown, 
Easily defeated. 
Yeah, shut the door and open wide. 
Seconal and astroglide. 
Fuck with me and traumatize. 
Don't you see I love your hide 
All the beauty that's trapped inside. 
Can't you see I love your hide 
Can't you see I love your hide 
Can't you see it 

have you lost your place 
I wore my doormat face. 
I hung my this or that. 
I laid my welcome mat.
