Mmmm...You're so pretty 
Not to talk to you would be a crime 
Let me put my arms around you 
Just wanna use up a little of your time 

And I'm going... 
Baby baby baby 
Baby baby baby 
Baby baby baby 
Won't you be my girl? 

You're eyes, they're so pretty 
The clothes you wear, so fine 
Won't you come around to my place 
Just wanna use up a little of your time 

And I'm going... 
Baby baby baby 
Baby baby baby 
Baby baby baby 
Won't you be my girl? 

Come on, come on, come on 

[SOLO] 

Baby baby baby 
Won't you be my girl?
