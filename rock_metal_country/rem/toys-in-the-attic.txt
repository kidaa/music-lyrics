Light voices scream nothing seems real's a dream 
Leaving the things that you learned behind 
Leaving the things that you love behind 
All of the things that you learned were real 
Nothing except for the years 
Voices scream, nothing seems real's a dream 
Toys toys toys in the attic 

Light voices scream nothing seems real's a dream 
Leaving the things that you love behind 
Leaving the things that you learned behind 
All of the things that you learned were real 
Nothing except for the years 
Voices scream, nothing seems real's a dream 
Toys toys toys in the attic
