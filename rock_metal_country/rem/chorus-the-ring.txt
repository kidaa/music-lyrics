Chorus   The Ring 

hey there now young one wholly, 
swing along quote the scriptures, 
keep them guessing which pit you crawled from 

just defy it, just deny it, 
was it fun? 
your time has come 
what have you done? 
what have you done? 

that's when the insults start to sting 
you can't remember anything 
the chorus chiming 
the greek chorus, the machine of God, singin' 

it's the poison that in measures 
brings illuminating vision 
it's the knowing with a wink 
that we expect in Southern women 

it's the wolf that knows which root to dig to save itself 
it's the octopus that crawled back to the sea. 

that's when the insults start to sting 
you can't remember anything 
the chorus chiming, the greek chorus, 
the machine of God sing..... 

hammered, shooting plywood in the backyard 
laughing 'cause the racket makes the blackbirds sing 
write the holy terror 
suck the marrow from the bone 
singe your own wings burning books, 
you got the chorus and the ring 

that's when the insults start to sting 
you can't remember anything 
the chorus chiming, the greek chorus, 
the machine sings. 

that's when the insults starts to sting 
you can't remember anything 
the chorus chiming, the greek chorus, 
the machine sings. 

that's when the calibration brittle 
as a stick hits you 
the gold ring in the tar museum 
che quevera wink, 
gold ring 
gold ring. 

sing.
sing.
sing.
sing.
