In the jungle, the quiet jungle, the lion sleeps tonight 
In the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion sleeps tonight 

In the village, the quiet village, the lion sleeps tonight 
In the village, the peaceful village, the lion sleeps tonight 

Hush my darling, don't cry my darling, the lion sleeps tonight 
Hush my darling, don't cry my darling, the lion sleeps tonight
