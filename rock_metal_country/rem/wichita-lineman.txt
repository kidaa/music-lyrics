Wichita Lineman 
a song by Jimmy Webb which was a hit for Glenn Campbell in the 1970's. a live version recorded in 1995 by R.E.M. appeared on the CD single for "Bittersweet Me" 

I am a lineman for the county and I drive the main road 
Searchin' in the sun for another overload 
I hear you singing in the wires I can hear you through the whine 
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line 

I know I need a small vacation but it don't look like rain 
And if it snows that that stretch down south won't ever stand the strain 
And I need you more than want you and I want you for all time 
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line 

And I need you more than want you and I want you for all time 
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line
