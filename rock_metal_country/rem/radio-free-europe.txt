Beside yourself if radio's gonna stay. 
Reason: it could polish up the grey. 
Put that, put that, put that up your wall 
That this isn't country at all 

Raving station, beside yourself 

Keep me out of country in the word 
Deal the porch is leading us absurd. 
Push that, push that, push that to the hull 
That this isn't nothing at all. 

Straight off the boat, where to go 
Calling on in transit, calling on in transit 
Radio Free Europe, radio... 

Beside defying media too fast 
Instead of pushing palaces to fall 
Put that, put that, put that before all 
That this isn't fortunate at all 

Raving station, beside yourself 
Calling on in transit, calling on in transit 
Radio Free Europe, radio... 

Decide yourself, calling all of the medias too fast 

Keep me out of country in the word 
Disappoint is into us absurd 

Straight off the boat, where to go 
Calling on in transit, calling on in transit 
Radio Free Europe
