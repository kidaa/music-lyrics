Everybody here
Comes from somewhere
If they would just as soon forget
In disguise
Disguised as they know you made you feel it
At the summer camp they volunteered
No one saw your face, no one saw your fear
You got apparition just appeared
Took you up and away from this place and shared
Humiliation
Of your teenage station
Nobody cares no one remembers or cares
If your fantasies are
Dressed up in travesties
Enjoy yourself with no regrets

So if you call out safe then I'll stop right away
If the premise buckles and the ropes starts to shake
The details small
And the stories the same
You don't have to explain
You don't have to explain
Humiliation
Of your teenage station

Yeah you cried
You still lie

You realize your fantasies are
Dressed up in travesties
Enjoy yourself with no regrets

Everybody here comes from somewhere
If they would just as soon forget, disguise

There you cried and cry
You still love you still lie
Ah, you cried and you crie
And you cried and you cried

Now there's nothing dark and there's nothing weird
Don't be afraid I will hold you near
From the seance where you first portrayed
An open heart on a darkened stage
Celebration of your teenage station

Sad experience-ly, delirious
Supernatural superserious
Bad experience-ly,delirious
Supernatural superserious
Well
