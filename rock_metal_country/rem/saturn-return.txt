Easy to poke yourself square in the eye
Harder to like yourself, harder to try

These are espouses
Postcards and neoprene
Roses a dollar a stem
Everyone sleeping or pulling the long haul and
Keys/caves in the cooler it's three A.M.
And saturn is beckoning no-one
It's offering up.

Late shift convenience store, burn out the lights
Telescope roof towards the north-western sky
You pulled the ladder and no-ones the wiser
You find your sights and discover

Saturn is orbiting nothing
He's off on its own,
He's breaking from home.

Harder to look yourself square in the eye
Easy to take off...

You found the ladder in the pattern of your wrist
You've seen and you've marked horizions
Mother was difficult, she made you cry
Cover the mirror, look to the sky

You climb into your rocket ship trying
Lift up and hold out your hands.

Saturn is orbiting nothing
He's off on its own
He's breaking from home

Saturn is orbiting nothing
He's off on its own
He's breaking from home

Saturn returns when you chased down, it slows
Throw them into a new gravity

Harder to look yourself square in the eye
Easy to poke yourself, easy as pie
Easy to take off, harder to fly
Harder to wake Galileo.
