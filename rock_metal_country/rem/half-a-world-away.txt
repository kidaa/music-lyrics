This could be the saddest dusk 
I've ever seen 
Turn to a miracle 
high alive 
My mind is racing 
As it always will 
My hand is tired my heart aches 
I'm half a world away here 
my head sworn 
To go it alone 
And hold it along 
Haul it along 
And hold it 
Go it alone 
Hold it along and hold, hold. 

This lonely deep sit hollow 
I'm half a world 
Half the world away 
My shoes are gone 
My life spent 
I had too much to drink 
I didn't think 
and I I didn't think of you 
I guess that's all I needed 
To go it alone 
And hold it along 
Haul it along 
And hold it 
Blackbirds backwards forwards and fall and hold hold. 

Oh this lonely world is wasted 
Pathetic eyes high alive 
blind to the tide that turns the sea 
This storm it came up strong 
it shook the trees 
And blew away our fear 
I couldn't even hear 

To go it alone 
And hold it along 
Haul it along 
And hold it 
To go it alone 
And hold it along 
Haul it along 
To go it alone 
And hold it along 
Haul it along 
And hold it 
Blackbirds backwards forwards and fall and hold hold. 

This could be the saddest dusk 
I've ever seen 
Turn to a miracle 
high alive 
My mind is racing 
As it always will 
My hands tired my heart aches 
I'm half a world away and go
