Untitled Song a.k.a. "So Awake Volunteer" 

This world is big this world is big and so-awake and so-awake 
I stayed up late I stayed up late to hear your voice 
This light is here this light is here to keep you warm to keep you warm 
This song is here this song is here to keep you strong 

I made a list of things to say 
But all I really want to say But all I want 
All I really want to say is That's all I want 
Hold her and keep him strong I made a list of things to say 
While I'm away from here But all I want, that's all I want 
Hold her and keep her strong This world is big and so-awake 
While I'm away from here I stayed up late to hear your voice 
Hold him and keep him strong This light is here to keep you warm 
While I'm away from here This song is here to keep you strong 

I've seen the world and so-awake 
And stay up late to hear me sing keep her strong 
Just hold her 
I've seen the world and so-awake 
And stay up late to hear me sing keep him strong 
Just hold him 
Hold her and keep her strong I've seen the world and so-awake 
While I'm away from here So stay up late to hear me sing 
Hold him and keep him strong I've seen the world and so-awake 
While I'm away from here So stay up late to hear me sing
