I wore the clothes you wanted 
I took your name 
If there is some confusion 
Who's to blame 

I signed your living will 
I smiled your face 
I'm ready to close the book on 
NASA and outer space 

If there is some confusion 
Who's to blame 
Who's to blame 

I sequenced your arrival 
I sealed your fate 
I pushed the button 
And erased your master tape 

I wrote the sales pitch 
I threw the grey switch 
I dragged your big-assed 
Dirty robbed car out of that ditch 

If there is some confusion 
Who's to blame 
Who's to blame 

I crossed your great divide 
I stirred your ocean's tide 
I called your bluff until 
I blew your circuits wide 

I'll be your albatross, 
Devil dog, Jesus Lord 
I don't wanna be Iggy Pop 
But if that's what it takes - me. 

If there is some confusion 
If there is some confusion 
If there is some confusion 
Who's to blame 
Who's to blame
