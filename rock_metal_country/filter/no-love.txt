Love don't love you
Love just haunts your world 
20 years ago you tried to take my eyes
Thought you loved the world 
And I believed the lies

No love 
There's no love at all today
No love 

Well we've crossed a million lines 
And we've lost a million times 
And the disrespect we've earned 
Is the disrespect we've learned 
And we don't give a damn about the love we lost 
We don't give a damn about the dreams we cost 
And on and on and on we go no love

Peace don't live in you
These things are slowly beating through
20 years ago began an odyssey 
20 years ago began the birth of me

No love 
There's no love at all today
No love 

Well we've crossed a million lines 
And we've lost a million times 
And the disrespect we've earned 
Is the disrespect we've learned 
And we don't give a damn about the love we lost 
We don't give a damn about the dreams we cost 
And on and on and on we go no love

I can see you laughing 
You love harassing
The pain you cause me
I don't think you'll know

Well we've crossed a million lines 
And we've lost a million times 
And the disrespect we've earned 
Is the disrespect we've learned 
And we don't give a damn about the love we lost 
We don't give a damn about the dreams we cost 
And on and on and on we go no love
