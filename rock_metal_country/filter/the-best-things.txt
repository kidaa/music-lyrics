Gotta green light gotta green light yeah
But I'm going no where
Gotta green light gotta red light yeah
No cop no stop I don't care
Every one of you could be the same
Every one of you could be play the game
Gotta green light, gotta green light yeah
But ya goin' nowhere

[Chorus:]
You know the best things in life aren't for me
You know the best things in life aren't for free

Gotta a new life, gotta a plight yeah
And it's goin' nowhere
Gotta a moutaintop like a pin drop yeah

No God no thought I don't care
Everyone of you could be the same
Everyone of you can't play this game
Gotta a new life, gotta a plight yeah
And it's going nowhere

[Chorus]

Got a new find got a new crime yeah
And it's goin' nowhere
Like a global path like car crash yeah
No cop no stop he don't care

Every one of you are just the same
Every one of you will play this game
Gotta a new fun, gotta a new crime yeah
And it's goin' nowhere

[Chorus 4 times]
