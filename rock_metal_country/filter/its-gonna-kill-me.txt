This girl's trying to kill me
This girl's trying to kill me
She's my favorite peice of plastic held to my ear
Where do I go
I don't know
Where to play
I don't know
What do I say
Whatever you say yeah
Shuh

[Chorus:]
Yeah
It's gonna kill me
Yeah
It's gonna kill me

And this girl's got a grip- oh where's mine
I spent the night walking home
Spent the last night dreaming
I spent the last night sceaming
What do you need
I don't know
Where do you stay
I don't know
What do you mean
I don't know
Where do you go
I don't know
Shah

[Chorus 2 times]

Oh yeah
Huh, yeah...

[Chorus]
