I'd like to break free from here 
It's gotten clear 
The reasons have smeared 
I'd like to break free from here 
The land of the lonely 
The reasons are phony 

So pray 
For the soldiers of misfortune 
The soldiers of distortion 
Dig a grave 

I'd like to wake up from this dream 
Can't we learn from history? 
Why's it such a mystery? 

I'd like to wake up from this dream 
A world where they don't scream 
A world without misery 

So pray for the soldiers of misfortune 
The soldiers of distortion 
Hold a parade again 

I'd like to wake up 
In a dream 
Where they don't scream 
Without misery 

Pray for the soldiers of misfortune 
For the soldiers of distortion 
Dig a grave 

Pray for the soldiers of misfortune 
For the soldiers of distortion 
So hold a parade 

Over there 
Over there 
I won't come back 
When it's over 
Over there 
Over there 
Over there 
Over there
