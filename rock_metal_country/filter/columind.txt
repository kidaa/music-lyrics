What do you think you did here kid
You're living like some rich kid bitch
The scratch that make you flinch
Tha scratch that you can't itch

What do you think you got done here man
You're putting on a show
What do you think you got done here kid
Did you reach your killing goal

Shame, you got everything,
you want everything
Shame, you need everything,
you kill everything

Oh Christ, look at them bleed
Oh, what makes this sick disease
Oh God, they're on their hands and knees
Oh, look at me, I'm about to be free

Now when it's all over
Listen to this shit man
Now when it's all over
We won't care, we won't care

Shame, you got everything,
you want everything
Shame, you need everything,
you kill everything
