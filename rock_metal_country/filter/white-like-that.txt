one thing is for sure
I don't need it
makes my life a war
what a bore
don't you understand
it wasn't ever my plan
I guess you just can't see
what you do when you blame it all on me

white like that
I'm white like that
It's all the same

said one thing and mean another
who are you gonna lose
who are you gonna choose
what do you think I'm gonna do
what are you thinking

white like that
I'm white like that
It's all the same

who's gonna lose
so who's gonna lose

they call me white trash

white like that
I'm white like that
It's all the same
white like that
I'm white like that
It's all the same game

so who's gonna lose
who's gonna lose
