It's the painful pages of your diary
It's the crying eyes you don't want them to see 
It's the scab that peals and just won't heal
It's the true you and it's just to real

Hey, it hurts you 
Hey, it hurts you

Once you leave there's no re-entry
You know that once you leave it's more then an ending
They'll put the pages back in your bruised book 
They'll put the pages back with rusty hooks
You know that once you leave theres no re-entry 

There's different stages of your misery
It's wishing yourself out of history
The mystery of you is hard to conceal
It's the true you and it's just to real

Hey, it hurts you 
Hey, it hurts you

Once you leave there's no re-entry
You know that once you leave it's more then an ending
They'll put the pages back in your bruised book 
They'll put the pages back with rusty hooks
You know that once you leave theres no re-entry 

Once you leave there's no re-entry
You know that once you leave it's more then an ending
They'll put the pages back in your bruised book 
They'll put the pages back with rusty hooks
You know that once you leave theres no re-entry
