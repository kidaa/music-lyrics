I've been thinking about what you said
It's been going around in my head
I've been thinking about what you were
It's a messy messed up blur

and when the con was over
one thing I learned:

I think you'd be better off if you were dead

think your check might last a year
aint got no worries...
aint got no fear...
you change so fast you're such a creep
you make me feel so very cheap

and when the heist was over
I guess I got burned

I think you'd be better off if you were dead
