Clean
There ain't nobody that's clean
Down in the basement
Down here the saints turn mean

Love
Ain't nobody lovin'
Down here your head stays low
You can't see the skies above

Push me a little bit closer to the man in the mirror

The wake after mistakes
Can you forgive and forget?
The wake after my hate
Do you forgive or regret?

Grow
Ain't nobody growin'
It's hard to remember hope
Your standards just stay low

Change
Ain't nobody changin'
I don't want to stay this way
I can't just stay deranged

Push me a little bit closer to the man in the mirror

The wake after mistakes
Can you forgive and forget?
The wake after my hate
Do you forgive or regret?

The wake after mistakes
Can you forgive and forget?
The wake after my hate
Do you forgive or regret?

Do you forgive and forget?
Do you forgive and forget?
