Come along take a ride 'cross the sky for an hour
Leave your mind take your soul fill the hole with flowers
From the lake through the trees in the streets for the powder
In the creed for the freeze I gotta place this power

'Cuz I am a lie
'Cuz I am a lie
'Cuz I am a lie
'Cuz I am a lie

[Chorus:]
I will lead you for awhile
Take your place to place
Bring you to this pyre
See you face to face

Come along to this flick take your sympathy with your symphony
See this dish a wonderful wish it's the perfect kiss it's the real thing
See the pitch it's the greatest of hits it's the missing with the wishing
At least you caught a smile when you coughed awhile when you did this kissing

'Cuz I am a lie
'Cuz I am a lie
'Cuz I am a lie
'Cuz I am a lie

[Chorus]

I will lead you
I will lead you

See you face to face
Face to face
See you face to face
Face to face
Yeah
See you face to face
Face to face
I see you face to face
Yeah
