What if I could say to you
Of what you wanted
Would not do
What if I could say
Say to you
Of what you wanted
Of what you could do
Huh
Huh
Huh
Huh
What you want
Is something you need
And what you've wanted
Is something I bleed
Could you say to me you love me
And I'm the only one
Could you say to me you love me
That I'm your man
Huh
Huh
Huh
Huh

[Chorus:]
Is this that last time I'll ever see you
Is this the last time I'll ever meet you
Is this the last I'll ever make love to you,
you

Yeah
What did you say girl
I'm not the only one
What did you say girl
I'm not the only one
Huh
Huh
Yeah
What did you say girl
U'm not the only one
What did you say girl
I'm not the only one
What did you say girl
I'm not the only one
What did you say girl
I'm not the only one
Huh
Huh
Huh
Huh...
