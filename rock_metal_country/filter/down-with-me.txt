Pictures hung on the walls 
Depicting a families dream's
Look's like they could come
Right out of some plastic family magazine 
I wish the pictures were true
And the stories they told were real
But I hate to say there was a rage
Somewhere deep inside their cage

Down, going down holding you
I'll take you down, I'll take you
Down, going down holding you
I'll take you down, I'll take you down

The cops show up but there late
They could not stop all that hate
They climbed over the bodies and put
Up that yellow crime scene tape 
And we thought that these people
Lived so calm and seemed fine 
Looks like underneath someone had lived 
With a blackened heart and mind

Down, going down holding you
I'll take you down, I'll take you
down, going down holding you
I'll take you down, I'll take you down

It's so hard to believe 
Then they found a note
It came from a man with a knife 
When they read it it gave them a chill 
If I can't have her then no one will 
Then no one will

Down going down holding you
I'll take you down, I'll take you
Down going down holding you
I'll take you down, I'll take you
Down going down holding you
I'll take you down, I'll take you
Down going down holding you
I'll take you down, I'll take you down
