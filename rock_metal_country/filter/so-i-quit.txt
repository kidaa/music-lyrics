Motherfucker

You got your legal baby
You got your legal good
You got your legal baby
Just like a common whore

You got your legal baby
You got your legal good
You got your legal baby
Just like a common hood

'Cause you don't need to look at me
To make yourself the fool
'Cause you don't need to come to me
To make yourself the fool

So I quit, so I quit, so I quit

You got your legal baby
You got your legal good
You got your legal baby
Just like a common hood

'Cause, you don't need to look at me
To make yourself the fool
'Cause you don't need to come to me
To make yourself the fool

So I quit, so I quit, so I quit

Try to take something from me motherfucker
You're gonna fuckin' die you piece of shit
