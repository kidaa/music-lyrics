Have you ever seen the stars at night and wondered, "Why so bright?"
Have you ever seen the sunset on a cloudy night and wondered, "Why tonight?"

And maybe there's just one time with you I want to remember for eternity.
For eternity.

Photographs taken, like memories of you, they disappear.
Colors of your eyes, they fade with time; they just can't stay clear.

Fades like a photograph...
Just want to bring you back.

Have you ever seen the bottom of the ocean from a plane? What a sight.
Have you ever seen a sunrise in the snow cap mountains? The twilight.

And maybe there's just one time with you I want to remember for eternity.
For eternity

Photographs taken, like memories of you, they disappear.
Colors of your eyes, they fade with time; they just can't stay clear.
Photographs taken, like memories of you, they disappear.
Colors of your eyes, they fade with time; they just can't stay clear.

Fades like a photograph...
Just want to bring you back.
