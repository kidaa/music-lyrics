There isn't enough hot water to be in 
There isn't enough salt lake to to lie in 
There isn't enough sky to fly in 
So softly 
There isn't enough breath to breathe 
Not for me 

Oh God damn me 
Oh God damn me 

There isn't enough snow to see through 
Snows too deep 
There isn't enough fog to see through 
Not through to me 
There isn't enough gain to get from 
Not from me 

Oh God damn me 
Oh God damn me 

Nothing changes 
Nothing we erase 
Nothing to change 
Nothing but me 

Oh God damn me 
Oh God damn me
