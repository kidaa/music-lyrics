did you think about your mother
did you think about your dad
did you think about no other
did you think you'd be so sad

to think you'd be so cold

watch your back and I'll watch mine

did you think about your brother
did you think about your friend
did you think about your inspiration
did you think about the end

to think you'd be so cold

watch your back and I'll watch mine
