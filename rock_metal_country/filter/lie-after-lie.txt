A waste of time, a waste of life, a waste of youth, oh... 
A waste of minds, a waste of life, and where were you? Oh... 
When I look back on this, will I think I missed out? 
Oh, will we end up as life's many wrongs? 
Or will we end up at all? 

Lie, lie after lie 
Lie after lie 
Oh! 

Always a crime, a waste of time, always with you, yeah 
A waste of minds, a waste of life, and where were you? Oh... 
When I look back on this, will I think I missed out? 
Oh, will we end up as life's many wrongs? 
Or will we end up at all? 

Lie, lie after lie 
Lie after lie
