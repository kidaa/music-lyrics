You can never be the same to me 
And you should never hide your shame from me 
Cause you yeah you 
Will always be the blame for me 
That's a perfect creepy game for me 

Can never be the same 
I don't know why 
Can never be the same 
I don't know why 

The truth 
Can break, bruise and lose in you 
This flu 
Is the thing that makes and breaks what's you 
You yeah you 
Will always be the same to me 
You yeah you 
Will always be the same to me 

Can never be the same 
I don't know why 
Can never be the same 
I don't know why
