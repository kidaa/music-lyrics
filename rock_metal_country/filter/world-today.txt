I like the world today
I like the world today
I like the world today
I like the world today

I like the world today
I like the world today
I like it when it's green

I like the world today
I like the world today
Oh what a hell of a price
What a hell of a price

But sometimes it's mean as hell
But sometimes, but sometimes
But sometimes it's mean as can be

I like the world today
I like the world today
I like the world today
When it's green

I like the world today
I like the world today
Hell of a price to pay
It's a hell of a price to pay

And sometimes it's mean
And sometime it's mean
And sometime it's mean

Today
