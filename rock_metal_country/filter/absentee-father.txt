What's with the sweat and nervous smile
Looks like your pain's gonna kill us all
Just like a gun don't care at all
Feel's like your justice it made us fall 

Speechless Jesus
One of these day's we just might need ya
One of these day's we just might need ya

What's it gonna take
Intervene or just come clean 
Where's your graceful hand
Where's the ending, where's your reign
Whats it gonna take
Intervene or just come clean 
Where's your graceful hand
Where's the ending, where's your reign 

What's your face is the common comment now
Revelations' making me bleed out now
Wallow up in your pity party now
Swallow up what little piggies shit

Speechless Jesus
One of these day's we just might need ya
One of these day's we just might need ya

What's it gonna take
Intervene or just come clean 
Where's your graceful hand
Where's the ending where's your reign
What's it gonna take
Intervene or just come clean 
Where's your graceful hand
Where's the ending where's your reign
