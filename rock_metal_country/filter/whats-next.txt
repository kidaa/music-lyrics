They just keep swallowing us 
They just keep hustling us 
They just keep beating us down 
Down 

They just keep holding us back 
Wished I could just see the attack 
They just keep beating us down 
Down 

It's time we took up a stand 
Take a wrong out of our hands 
Because right now we just don't realize 

What's next 
Look what they've done to us 
We don't know who to trust 
Oh 

What's next 
It's just so meaningless 
Wish I was separate in this 
Oh 

Take the soldiers and put them in sand 
Pull the child right from the man 
It's not hard to get swallowed up 
George Bush is f**king us up 

See the lies that he has sewn 
Wash us up then he has us done 
Wash us up then he has us done 
This time he has taken 

What's next 
Look what they've done to us 
We don't know who to trust 
Oh 

What's next 
It's just so meaningless 
Wish I was separate in this 
Oh 

They just keep swallowing us 
We don't know who to trust 
[3x]

They just keep swallowing us 
We've got each other to trust 
[3x]

What's next 
Look what they've done to us 
We don't know who to trust 
Oh 

What's next 
It's just so meaningless 
Wish I was separate in this 
Oh
