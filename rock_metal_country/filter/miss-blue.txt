Could you stay long enough for me to say goodbye
You can be free as long as you're with me
If you could see the real me you'd bleed
If you could see the real me I'd breathe
Could you still Breathe long enough for me
Could you still be long enough for me

[Chorus:]
When do you think I'll be okay
When do you think I'll be okay

If I should stay when do I pray
If I should stay where do I begin
Do you think I should watch you die
Should we close our eyes and say goodbye

[Chorus]

Hey you Miss Blue
You think that I'm well to do
Hey you Miss Blue
I feel in love with you
Hey you Miss Blue
I think about you as true
Hey you Miss Blue
I hate it when you cry
Hey you Miss Blue
I hate it when you say goodbye
Hey you Miss Blue
I hate it when you say goodbye

[Chorus]

You say goodbye
You say goodbye yeah
Don't say goodbye
Say goodbye

Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goddbye...
