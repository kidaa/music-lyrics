Come take me 
To the place of your bereavement 
Let me see 
The scars of your allegiance 
Well it's good to see 
That you're skeptical 
That your mind aint closed 
And your heart is cold 
Yeah yeah 

I'm gonna make you wait 
I'm gonna liberate 
This dream ends now 
I'm gonna fascinate 
I'm gonna change your fate 
This dream ends now 

Come with me 
If you want to see the real thing 
Let me lead 
You'll see what keeps you breathing 
And it's good to see 
When you look at me 
And that I'm the one 
To the tenth degree 
Yeah 

I'm gonna make you wait 
I'm gonna liberate 
This dream ends now 
I'm gonna fascinate 
I'm gonna change your fate 
This dream ends now 

Once I believed 
But I'll never believe you 
[x4] 

I'm gonna make you wait 
I'm gonna liberate 
This dream ends now 
I'm gonna fascinate 
I'm gonna change your fate 
This dream ends now 

I'm gonna make you wait 
I'm gonna liberate 
This dream ends now 
I'm gonna fascinate 
I'm gonna change your fate 
This dream ends now
