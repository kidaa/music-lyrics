I got greed, it's got me
I got freeze, it's on me
I can't breathe, I can't see
I just bleed, I just be

I can't see straight, I can't be straight
I just want a life of my own
I can't live hate, I just won't hate
I just want a life of my own

Yeah, I just want a life of my own
Yeah, I just want a life of my own
Yeah, I just want a life of my own
Yeah, I just want a life of my own

You walk away from me
You walk away from me

My soul leaves, my soul breathes
My heart aches, the ground shakes
You can't beat it, you can't feed it

I can't see see straight, I can't be straight
I just want a life of my own
I can't live hate, I just won't hate
I just want a life of my own

Yeah, I just want a life of my own
Yeah, I just want a life of my own

You walk away from me
You walk away from me
You walk away from me
You walk away from me
