Out in the desert sky tonight
With nothing but my head
Under the watchful eyes you're
You're thinking the thoughts of dread

Wanting to tear myself apart
Running for some rest

Cold thoughts onslaught my head
Cold blood under my skin

Making the dream wash out tonight
With nothing but my drug
Watching the world fall down
At least inside my head

Cold thoughts onslaught my head
Cold blood under my skin

I wish I'd just admit, I wish I'd just admit
I wish I'd just admit tonight
Ask me a question, something that you know
Watch as a lie, watch as a lie is told

Cold thoughts onslaught my head
Cold blood under my skin
Cold thoughts onslaught my head
Cold blood under my skin
