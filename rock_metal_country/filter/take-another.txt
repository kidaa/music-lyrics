said no way
but knew I'd try some day
sad but true
it still won't wash away
and I can't take you with me
I can't tell you what to do
I got a sieve inside me
a pit inside me
I got a nowhere point of view
it makes me wanna
take another piece
take it out on me
my ambition fell and hit the ground
pick those pieces
pick them from the ground
and I can't take you with me
I can't tell you what to do
I got a sieve inside me
I got a pit inside
I got a nowhere point of view
It makes me 
take another piece
take it out on me
