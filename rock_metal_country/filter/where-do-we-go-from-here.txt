Ease 
Had to start telling me 
Won't bring me to my knees 
Scraped up and bruised from your fickelness 
I plead 
Just let me feel some ease from creatures of your greed 
Just let me feel some ease for me

I'm not so glad I met you
It makes me want to go away
I touch
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

Where do we go from here
You know I'm not the only one
Where do we go from here
No, I'm not the only one

These 
Broken dreams are screams to me 
The difference I can't see 
The way you look and talk to me 
You're cursing me I freeze 
The combination of loss, control, loss of soul 
I weaze 
Just give some ease to me

I'm not so glad I met you
It makes me want to go away
I touch
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

Where do we go from here
You know I'm not the guilty one
Where do we go from here
No, I'm not the only one

I touch
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

Where do we go from here
Stop dreamin' 'bout the shiny gun
Where do we go from here
No, I'm not the only one
Where do we go from here
Where do we go from here
Where do we go from here
Where do we go from here
Where do we go...... yeah....
