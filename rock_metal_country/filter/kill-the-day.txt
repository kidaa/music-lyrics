A night turns to daylight 
Daylight brakes you 
You feel lost and lonely 
Your thoughts betrayed you 

It isn't the first time 
It won't be the last 
This crushed up feeling 
Has a place on my crime 

Close your eyes 
The curtains that you like 
Push them away, it's ok 
Kill the day 

And day turns to nighttime 
And the nighttime makes you 
You use a playwright pony 
Your thoughts remake you 

It isn't the first time 
It won't be the last 
This crushed up feeling 
Has a place on my crime 

Close your eyes 
The curtains that you like 
Push them away, it's ok 
Kill the day 

Close your eyes 
The curtains that you like 
Push them away, it's ok 
Kill the day 

Hates you 
Brakes you 
Hates you 
Brakes you 

Close your eyes 
The curtains that you like 
Push them away, it's ok 
Kill the day 

Close your eyes 
The curtains that you like 
Push them away, it's ok 
Kill the day 

Close your eyes 
The curtains that you like 
Push them away, it's ok 
Kill the day
