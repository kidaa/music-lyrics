I'll give you one good tiny reason I think you could believe
I'll give you one good tiny reason I think you could see through it
I'm not the kind of man that thinks the truth could hurt me
I'm not the kind of man that thinks the truth can see me
You know a little bit goes a long way
You know a little bit lasts a long time

And the time has come to undo the wrong I've done

I am a greiving man
I can't believe the things I've done to you
I am a guilty man
And I can't believe the things I've done to you

I give you one good tiny reason to push that big suit too far
I give you one good tiny reason to smash him and his big car
Everybody thinks I'm blue and what everybody think is it's true yeah
And I just can't keep it inside
So you think it's you
So you think it's true
You know a little bit lasts a long time
You know a little bit goes a long way

And the time has come to undo the wrong I've done

I am a greiving man
I can't believe the things I've done to you
I am a beaten man
I can't believe the things I've done to you

I am a blood-soaked man
I can't believe the things I've done to you
I am a guilty man
I can't believe the things I've done to you
And I am a greiving man
I can't believe the things I've done to you
I am a beaten man
I can't believe the things I've done to you
uniteligible gibberish

I tried to pray
I tried to pray
I tried to pray
Yes I will give it a shot
Yes I will give it a shot
Yes I will give it a shot
Shot
