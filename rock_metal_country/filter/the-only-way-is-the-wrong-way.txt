Did you think that I'd disappear 
Did you think that I'd wash away 
Did you think that I'd last this long 
Did you think that I'd get this strong 

Everytime they try to make me change 
they just wear me down with more chains 

And it feels like 
that you with me or against me 
and it feels like 
that your promises are all mine 
and it feels like 
that to push me is to shove me 
and it feels like 
that the only way is the wrong way 

Did you think that I'd could be your cruch 
Did you think that life could mean so much 
Did you think that this could end in birth 
Did you think that this was just plain old luck 

and everytime that try to make me change 
that just wear me down with more chains 

And it feels like 
that you with me or against me 
and it feels like 
that your promises are all mine 
and it feels like 
that to push me is to shove me 
and it feels like 
that the only way is the wrong way 

everytime they try to make me change 
they just wear me down with more chains 

And it feels like 
that you with me or against me 
and it feels like 
that your promises are all mine 
and it feels like 
that to push me is to shove me 
and it feels like 
that the only way is the wrong way 

and it feels like 
that the only way is the wrong way 

and it feels like 
that the only way is the wrong way 

the only way is the wrong way 
the only way is the wrong way
