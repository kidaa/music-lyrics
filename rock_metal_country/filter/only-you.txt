I started to think about becoming extinct by the way that we're going. 
I started to think that we're close to the brink if you don't hurry. 
I started to cry when I thought of the lie that they told you. 
To limit the sky when I look in your eye, I know I can't hold you. 

Only you 
Only you 
Only you 

I'm starting to think that we'll disappear only you. 
I'm starting to think that we'll disappear. 

I started to think that we're missing the link it's begun to unravel. 
I just takes a blink to get out of sync the lines become blurry. 
I look at your smile then I know for awhile that I don't have to worry. 
Cause the world has got you and like oceans are blue we start a new journey. 

Only you 
Only you 
Only you 

I'm starting to think that we'll disappear only you. 
I'm starting to think that we'll disappear. 

Only you 

I'm starting to think that we'll disappear only you. 
I'm starting to think that we'll disappear only you. 
I'm starting to think that we'll disappear.
