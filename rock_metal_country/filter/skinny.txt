So here you are in your small little world
Kept up like a little precious virgin girl
To hear 'bout your grace and your silly face
Wrapped up like a knot in a ball of shoelace
And everytime I talk to you
It sounds like you're caught in a psychological flu

Don't ever let them see you cheat
Don't' Ever let them see you bleed
Don't Ever let them shake your hand
Don't ever let them believe that scam

[Chorus:]
Skinny And it will make you cry
Skinny
And it will make you lie
Skinny
And if it makes you soft inside
Skinny At least you will not die

And if you take a good look at them
All caught up in their graciousless win
Every sin is their seamless smile
Will go on for a countless while
And just because they think they won
It just means that the shit has just begun

Don't ever let them see you cheat
Don't ever let them see you beat
Donn't ever let them shake your hand
Don't ever let them believe that scam

[Chorus]

Yeah, skinny, skinny, huh [8 times]
