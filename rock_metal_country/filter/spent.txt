all my life
all my time
oh it's got a price
oh gonna pay for mine
I know you really care
all my friends they got
old apathy in the brain
they got no ideas in their heads
they got no path that I can see
don't you think that I don't blame them
don't you think that I can't shame them
don't you think that I don't want them
don't you think that I aint one of them
one of them

I know you really care

you're just another x.
