Hey god told us that we made 
a very big sin 
You don't know where 
to begin 

He says turn the other cheek 
but that seems kind of weak 
I just wanna beat up 
beat up the meek 

He says you be a better man 
if you'd stick with the plan 
But I don't think I can 
not with that kind of man 

You love to be cruel 
You love to be cruel 
I'm not a good tool 
Cauz you love to be cruel 

What now 
The cross has been greased 
but I don't feel the heat 
nor the peace in the street 
everybody feels it 
So just bury it in the pit 
with the best of the sick 
ideological shit 

You love to be cruel 
You love to be cruel 
I'm not a good tool 
Cauz you love to be cruel 

You love to be cruel 
You love to be cruel 
You love to be cruel 
You love to be cruel
