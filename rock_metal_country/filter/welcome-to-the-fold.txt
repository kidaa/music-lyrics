You take my money
You think you're great
you think it's funny
I hate your face
Yeah
You got your Jesus
And I got my space
You Got your reasons
And I got my case

[Chorus:]
You just gotta sit yourself down
To contemplate
You get yourself a nice cold beer
And drink yourself away
You're celebrating nothing
And you feel a-okay
You're celebrating nothing
And you feel a-okay

You think yo're precious
And I think you're shit
And I'd kill your father
To destory his seed
Ohhh nothing with ever
Destory your greed

[Chorus]

Now when you break yourself down
And go to this place
You give yourself the reason
To get off your case
And when you break it down yeah
And see through this shit
You give yourself the reason
To live though this
Break down

Mama give me my medicine
Mama give me my medicine
Mama give me my medicine
The one that makes me feel taller
Mama give me my medicine
Mama give me my medicine
The one that makes me feel tall like a tall tree
Mama give me my medicine
That makes me feel like a tall tree
Mama give me my medicine
That makes me feel like a tall tree
Mama give me my medicine
That makes me feel like a tall tree yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]

You're celebrating nothing
and you feel a-okay
you're celebrating nothing
and you feel a-okay

Do do do do do do do do do do do do do
