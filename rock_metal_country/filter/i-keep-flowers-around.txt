I keep the bottles around,
and my head held down,
which is what you do in this place.

I keep the bottles around,
and my spirits down,
as I watch you lie to my face.

Can't you see,
the little things you say to me?
You're not smart enough,
to realize you said, the opposite.

'cause you lie,
to me
[2x]

I keep the flowers around,
and my head held down,
it's just what you do in my place

I keep the flowers around,
and my head held down,
it's the only defense in my case.

'cause I can see,
what the lies have done to me.
I hope love's enough,
for between the lies you seek.

'cause you lie,
to me
[4x]

To me
[4x]

'cause you lie
To me
[2x]
