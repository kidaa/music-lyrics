Here I am once again'
Need a true helping hand, yes I do
I ain't wise, I ain't cool
Lot of times, been a fool
Yes I know, yes I know, sure I know
I'll be back , full attack
With waving flags, standing tall
Thank you God, for my friends;
Fir a fair second chance, thank you all, thank you all
I'm so glad you're around
Always there, when I'm down, knowing you
Got me through
Catch my fall
I'll be back, full attack
With waving flags, standing tall
Thank you all
Never crawl
Stand up tall
