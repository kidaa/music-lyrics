I'm sitting here, in my lighthouse
Breaking waves making soothing sounds
Wondering what I'm here for
Memories coming up ashore

Stars
Shining through the endless dark
It doesn't matter where you are
We're looking at the same old stars
Hollywood, candy playground
Lot's of hope, being kicked around
St. Petersburg, got a great vibe
Hungry hearts, with a lovely smile

Stars
Shining through the endless dark
It doesn't matter where you are
We're looking at the same old stars

Germany, solid home ground
History, being lost and found
Old Japan, land of honor
Had no time, wanting to get closer
