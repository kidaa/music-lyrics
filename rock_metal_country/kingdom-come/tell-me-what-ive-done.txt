The first time I had seen her face
It struck me very hard
As I walked up to ask her out
She got right in my car

A minute later I went on
Do you care for sex
She replied don't hesitate
But only cash or cheques

[Chorus:]
Ohh Tell me what I've done
Im out of luck again
Ohh I only wanna have some fun
Let the dark days end

The bed was rockin very hard
It never felt so great
Sure enough my girl found out
I knew it was too late

She suit me for a broken heart
But nothing I could give
The court of justice figuered out
A poor man's got to live

Ohh Tell me what I've done
Im out of luck again
Ohh I only wanna have some fun
The dark days got to end
