Never thought I'd miss her, it's hurting so much
Never thought I need her, rejected her touch
My heart has caught on fire, I'm losing my mind
I never was a lier, just foolish and blind,
It took a lot of hurting, to understand
I gotta stop pretending, never again
Really wanna talk to you
Gonna let my heart be true
Remembering what you have said
Can't put out and not take back
Aching for the good times, freedom I choose
Fighting all my feelings, thought I won't lose
Can I be forgiven, the pain is too great
I'm begging you to listen, I hope it's not too late
Really wanna talk to you
Gonna let my heart be true
Remembering what you have said
Can't put out and not take back
