You feel the way I do
Love has changed its course
Crashed upon the shore
I can see it in your eyes
I can feel the hurt,
Far beyond the word 'good bye
CHORUS 1
Now that it's over
Now that we're at the end
Can we start over
Back to when we were FRIENDS
Love, more than just your touch
More than just a word
Many times it hurts
I believe in you and I
Think I've found a way,
We can stand the test of time
CHORUS 2 + 3 like CHORUS 1
CHORUS 4
Now that it's over
Now that we're at the end
We can start over
