I can't lie and say I 
Always understand why 
The rain falls on me 
And I have to admit, I feel my faith is gone 
It's easy to believe when sorrow never comes your way 
And when I try to pray, it seems the words they come out wrong 

*Bridge* 
So everything that matters to me 
I give it all to you 
Cuz I'm tired of the way the crying feels 
And just to let you know I have been hurt so many times 
So I pray to God that this time loves for real 
Hmmm... 

Chorus 
So even though I can't see what tomorrow may bring 
I believe in you cuz you believe you believe in me 
And even when the night makes the light hard to see 
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done 

I can't lie and say I 
Always smile but I try 
The tears sometimes they come 
And nothing people say can ease the pain 
Oh but when I close my eyes I see you reaching out for me 
You tell me that this test I'm in, it won't last always 

Chorus 
So even though I can't see what tomorrow may bring 
I believe in you cuz you believe you believe in me 
And even when the night makes the light hard to see 
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done 

And though the seasons may change 
Still your love it remains 
When this world soon shall pass 
We'll be together at lllaaaaaaaaaaaaasssstttttt....... 

Chorus w/ adlibs 
Even though I can't see..... 
what tomorrow may bring......i believe 
I believe in you cuz..... 
oohh cuz you believe in me...yea ohh 
And even when the night makes.... 
the light so hard to see ohhho 
Thy kingdom come oohh yea, Thy will be done 
oh yea...thy kingdom come or thy will be done
