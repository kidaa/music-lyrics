Yesterday I got a page 
And it said that my daddy died
But I couldn't cry
We had a fight long time ago
By the liquor store 
Said I didn't wanna see your face no more
You see I know pops was just a man
But how you hurt someone you love
I don't understand 
So ya'll tell me 
What am I supposed to do Oh

Heaven can you hear me 
Father can you help me
On my knees I'm praying 
Please come through 
My thought is slowly dying 
And though I'm really trying
It's been a while since I last talk to you
Mama said God never makes mistakes 
If that's true then I really need to see your face 
So I'll know 
It's gonna be ok

I pulled up around five 
to the see my people and my mamas House 
To see what they was talking bout
I haven't seen em in a long time 
Baby how you doing fine
Now it's time to tell em 
What's been on my mind
Who was there to wipe the tears away 
And who decided not to show up 
On my wedding day
So ya'll tell me 
What am I supposed to do 
I just need to hear from you

Heaven can you hear me 
Father can you help me 
On my knees I'm praying 
Please come through
My thought is slowly dying 
And though I'm really trying 
It's been a while since I last 
Talked to you 
Mama said God never makes mistakes 
If that's true 
Then I really need to see your face 
So I'll know it's gonna be ok

Living in this world ain't easy
You wanna give up sometimes and 
even though I got my girl beside me
A fathers love is hard to find see
every boy wants his daddy there
Feels like his daddy care
Feel Like his daddy will be there 
I know I gotta keep my mama strong 
I guess you never miss 
Something till it's gone
