Lyrics: Lenny Wolf & Carol Tatum
Ooo, do you feel the danger 
You, cannot fool the maker
Looking up 
To the sky 
Hard to breathe it 
Burns my eyes 
Desert land 
Poison rain 
Can't sit back 
When I know who's to blame 
Ooo, do you feel the danger 
Blackened tides 
On the sand 
Still they rape our 
Holy land 
In our eyes 
So afraid 
Is our future the 
Price they have paid?
Chorus: 
Blood on the land 
Blood on their hands 
Ready to witness the fall of man 
Hiding their eyes 
Telling us lies 
Ready to shatter the dream of man 
Ooo, do you feel the danger 
You, cannot fool the maker 
They will take 
All they can
Then pretend 
They don't understand 
For the lies 
That they tell 
All I know is I'll 
See you in hell
