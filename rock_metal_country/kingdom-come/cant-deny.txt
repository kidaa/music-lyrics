Lyrics: Lenny Wolf s Marty Wolff 

You pretend you're so cool 
It's not you who's the fool 
Says the voice on your shoulder 
You pretend you're so calm 
And you've never been harmed 
But you're crying inside
Chorus: 
Can't deny 
What you find under cover 
What you need's more than a !over 
You would like to believe 
You could never deceive 
Not yourself or another 
When the going gets rough 
You pretend you're so tough 
But you're hurting inside 
What you need is a friend 
You can trust 'till the end 
And you don't need no other 
After all you've been through 
l can see why you choose 
Living life in disguise
