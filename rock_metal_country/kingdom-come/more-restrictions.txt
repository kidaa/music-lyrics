They taught me how to give in to suit them right
While trying to control me, from deep inside

It's no surprise they don't like my type of style
Their fear of law and order, keeps them uptight

[Chorus:]
More restrictions, more convictions
No illusion, more confusion

Don't let whispering liars pollute your mind
While they keep on trying to change your mind

Watch their voices crawling right up your spine
