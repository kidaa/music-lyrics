Do you know why I'm cold as ice
Why we don't seem to harmonize
Don't care to talk
Can't even cry
CHORUS 1
With a glove of stone
You've got no control
All the words you say
Are nothing but lies
I can handle it once or twice
Being stepped on is part of life
But not by you
Don't even try
CHORUS 2 like CHORUS 1
Like a smile in pain
I couldn't reply
Now you wonder what's on my mind
Whether you have been right or wrong
It's up to you
Time to decide
CHORUS 3 like CHORUS 1
All the words you say 
are nothing but lies 
CHORUS 4 like CHORUS 1 
Like smile in pain
I couldn't reply
Like smile in pain
I couldn't reply
It's your choice to change
