Use his name to kill - I don't think so
The grand illusion spilled - to much red flow
Forcing your believe - onto others
Constantly deceive - your own brother
Think you got the call - it's all right then
But bringing us to fall - you're a sick man

Loving, peacefully breathing - something the devil don't know
Better than the global believing - friendship the seed we should sow

Alright to disagree - point your finger
Alright to spread believe - be a bringer

The paradise so close - go ahead now
Which ever way you may go - go along now

Loving, peacefully breathing - something the devil don't know
Better than the global believing - friendship the seed we should sow

The truth is you don't care - you're a stealer
The king of nothing there - a faking healer

Don't you ever learn - form the graveyards
The only deck you play - is the death card

The truth is you don't care
The king of nothing there
The paradise so close
Which ever way you may go
Go along now
