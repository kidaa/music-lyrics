L. Wolf, J. Kottak
Now is the time 
I hear the war, it calls my 
Name 
Lands' far away 
Hoping i'll return the same 
How will I face tomorrow 
How can I face the pain 
How can I face the sorrow 
Fighting in vain 
I've gotta go 
Go and fight someone I 
Don't even know 
I think you know 
They can't wage a war if 
Nobody shows 
Red is the sky 
I hear the guns and 
Shouting pain
Sun doesn't shine 
Shadows cross this bloody 
Rain 
How can we stop the 
Hurting 
How can we love again 
Why is the world still 
Burning 
How can we change 
I've gotta go 
Go and fight someone i 
Don't even know 
I think you know 
They can't wage a war if 
Nobody shows 
Don't wanna go 
Go and fight someone i 
Don't even know 
I think you know 
They can't wage a war if 
Nobody shows
