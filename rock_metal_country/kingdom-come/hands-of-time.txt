Lyrics: Lenny Wolf & Carol Tatum
No more tomorrow 
Is what they talk about 
Everyone borrows 
On time while living in doubt 
Innocent laughter 
Filling the children's eyes 
Don't let disaster 
Destroy the magic of life
Chorus: 
The sun is fading 
Darkness comes in the sky 
I wish we could turn back 
The hands of time 
Why are we destined 
Making the same mistakes 
Especially next time 
It could be far too late 
Living together 
Needing to compromise 
Harder than ever 
To stand the test of time
