Lyrics: Lenny Wolf & Carol Tatum
Come and lay your head 
On my shoulder 
For the world has grown 
So much colder 
l feel you tremble like a frightened child 
1.et me shower you 
With affection 
There's no need for such 
Self-protection 
I feel your body melting into mine
Chorus: 
Talkin 'bout the both of us 
Don't need to cry 
No one can destroy our trust 
No one can replace your touch 
And we know why 
Hound to misery 
And seduction 
There's no need for this 
Self-destruction 
Start reaching out for what is real in life.
