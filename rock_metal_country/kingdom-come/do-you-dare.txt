Make no sound - start to feel
In and out - nothing's real
Love is rising - want to share
Come on out - I'll be there

[Chorus:]
You'd rather hide - behind uniform
Sitting inside - the eye of the storm

Do you care - do you dare
I'm calling you - meet me half way through

The human mind - 's hard to read
Disbelief - killed the seed
Fear is rising - sure you know
The only way - 's to let it go

[Chorus:]

[Double-Chorus:]
love's cool breeze
Make the call - you can't fall
Warm and true - 's what I'll be to you
