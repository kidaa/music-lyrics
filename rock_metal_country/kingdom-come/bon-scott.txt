Stood up spoke his mind
Never pointed finger
Cried out many times
A god's given bringer

Are you digging this
Going back in time
Music old or new
You always come to mind

Bon Scott that it is
Your words never missed
In after life I believe
You ain't no history
Hope you're feeling free

Perfect play on words
Something I could lean on
This song's in return
For helping me ride on

Bon Scott that it is
Your words never missed
In after life I believe
You ain't no history
Hope you like what you see
And feeling free - Yeah
You know the piace you got the key

Bon Scott that it is
Your words never missed
In after life I believe
You ain't no history
Hope you like what you see
And feeling free - Yeah
Bon Scott that it is
The boys keep rocking ot
Singing your songs out loud
