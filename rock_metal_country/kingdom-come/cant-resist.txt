I have never seen her cry
Hasn't shown the slightest smile, oh
Doesn't share her deepest thoughts
She just lets her body talk
CHORUS 1
I can't resist
Gotta go and kiss her
BRIDGE 1
With a scattered mind
Can't see in her eyes of stone
I don't think she's hurt inside,
Just reserved with a sense of pride, oh
Thinking what's gonna make her show
Straight attack's gonna let me know
CHORUS 2
BRIDGE 2
CHORUS 3
CHORUS 4
BRIDGE 3
I just can't resist
Gotta steal a kiss
It's like hit or miss
Got a scattered mind
Oh - Oh - Oh
