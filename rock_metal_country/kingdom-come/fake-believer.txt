You're a great big talker
Tell them what to do
Giving out directions
You don't follow through
You're a great complainer
Haven't done a thing
Good at pointing fingers
Acting like a king
CHORUS 1
Fake believers
Spreading all around
Crave approval
Before they let you down
Counting on emotions
Of the blinded crowd
Making sense means nothing
When you've got no ground
CHORUS 2
Flames are growing
Burning inside out
False and spineless
It's time to throw them out
