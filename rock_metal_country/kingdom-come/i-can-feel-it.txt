Do you know what I would like to do
find a place on earth for just us two
Thinking of our life without tabus
Wouldn't you like to be drifting too

[Chorus:]
I can feel it, feel what you're trying to say
Yes I want you, want you forever to stay

Paved with love I found the perfect match
Trying hard to stay right in my track

I can't relax cause I haven't done a thing
I can't do a thing, cause I just can't relax

[Chorus]

Grow our corn and plant our trees by hand
Let me be your private superman
