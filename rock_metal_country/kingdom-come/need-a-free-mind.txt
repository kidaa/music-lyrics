I've tried to see the good
I gave it all I could
it didn't work my love
not how it should
compromising love
the sadness of your touch
the signs are all so clear
I've had enough

need a free mind
not a lover like you
independent but mine - ooh

[Chorus:]
holding out, waiting for - someone
conquering my heart
nothing's clear, when you're near
like a shadow in the dark

I'm dragging guilt behind
behaving so unkind
it's bringing out the bad
from deep inside

I'm sure not blaming you
nothing you could do
life can take a turn
and often burns
