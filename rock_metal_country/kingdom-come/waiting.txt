Waiting for the good to come
Crying, 's what we've done too long
Hurting, now it has begun

We can't force what's not ment to be

Hating, will be next to come
That's why, we should start to run
Don't cry, 'cause I'm not that strong
Take good care, don't look back my love

[Chorus:]
Never gonna be the same
Gotta leave the house of pain
Why, I really can't explain
Nothing you and I can do

Someone killed our guiding flame
Can't go on by changing names
You and I can only pray
For a sign to come to show our way

For a sign to come, my love
Nothing we can do - ooh
Take good care and don't look back
Wating for the good
