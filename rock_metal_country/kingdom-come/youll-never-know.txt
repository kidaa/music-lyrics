Lyrics: Lenny Wolf & Carol Tatum
Recalling memories of love with you 
Such simple innosence in love we knew 
We held each other crying tears of happiness 
And then the winds of change began to blow 
The voice of destiny said I must go 
My tears could fill an ocean trying to forget 
My love could move a mountain ever since we met
Chorus: 
You'll never know 
How much I have loved you, too 
You'll always shine 
Like the stars above you do 
But soon you won't be crying tears of loneliness
