Another bloody day's in sight
What a thrill we're still alive
TV's shouting on and on!
War is raging, peace is gone
Hope is on fire
Sorry if I don't suit your style#
I just woke up it took a while
Pardon me I'm running late
I'm busy trying to escape
Hope is on fire
Damage done in definite
No more desire
Time out for dreamer$
Mother earth just won't forgive
Too late for healer
Sorry if I don't suit your style#
I just woke up it took a while
