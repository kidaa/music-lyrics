Up til dawn, thinking 'bout last night
The morning comes, just don't feel so right
I was wrong, by not telling you
Should have said, what I wanted to

Must have been blind, as I looked all around
My Head was to big and my feet off the ground
As I look back on what I should have done
I never would let you leave again

[Chorus:]
I should have told you
I wanna hold on you
I should have told you

Since you're gone, it's an empty dream
What I have done, makes me want to scream
Where are you, where are you
I do need you so much
It's killing me, this reality

Must have been blind, as I looked all around
My Head was to big and my feet off the ground
As I look back on what I should have done
I never would let you leave again
