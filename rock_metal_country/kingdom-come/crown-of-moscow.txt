The day I won't forget - so long for it to come
We played the house of houses - the kreml's come undone
A heart felt show it's been - a lot of give and take
So many things I felt - emotions on the break

Leaving through the backdoor - I saw her standing there
Approaching me so gentle - my senses all aware
I hardly can remember - so many days gone by
A spell she put on me - forever in my mind

I'm yearing for the spirit - to come around again
At least I feel alive now - hope is my best friend

The golden crown of Moscow
An angel I have met
A very pure connection
I never will forget

She struck me like a lightning
Such grace so rare to find
One second we were touching
One lifetime in mind

I usually keep distant - and gratefully respect
With her it felt so different - such lasting strong effect
Some of you may wonder - a ghost inside my head
For you really find out - sometimes you must look back

The golden crown of Moscow
An angel I have met
A very pure connection
I never will forget

She struck me like a lightning
Such grace so rare to find
One second we were touching
One lifetime in mind
