Thought your heart was strong and free
Full of joy, like springtime leaves
Then you left, on and on
Disbelief, has taught you wrong
And now the magic's gone, your fear has won

Scared to talk, hiding out
You want my love, but don't know how
The scars you've caused, are hard to count
Love has kept me shut my mouth
I thought that love alone, would break all stone

[Chorus:]
Whenever you cried, you knew it was right
But then all your second thoughts, killed you inside

Loving - ain't no fantasy
Darling - what a tragedy
Warnings - didn't make you see
Frightening - how you're burned in me

You took advise, from so called friends
No surprise, they talked no sense

My past you've said, will catch up strong
The love I feel, will soon be gone

Security you chose, like a plastic rose
