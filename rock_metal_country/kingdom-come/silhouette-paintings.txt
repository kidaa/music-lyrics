Needing to sleep and rest my mind
Sing me a sweet old lullaby
Your soothing voice so clear and free
Hiding in bed just you and me
So many times when I was gone
Yearning for peace it's been so long
Hardly awake I know you're there
Feeling your touch I know you care

The future I don't know - look around
Like catching a rainbow - reaching ground

Somebody's watching me and you
Decisions remain for us to do
Following voices deep inside
The spirit of love is shining bright
Once I look back on what I've done
It's paving my way for things to come
Never quite knew where I belong
I don't remember what was wrong

The future I don't know - look around
Like catching a rainbow - reaching ground
Hiding in dark light - gentle sounds
Silhouette paintings - moving around

Looking for reason full of doubt
Avoiding the pain is no way out
Seeing the good in things I felt
Is making the isolation melt
