The clock is ringing once again
A new day has arrived
Don't care - to get out of bed
Anger is in sight

Hektik, stress, agressive people
I'm gonna face it all
Doing this a lot of years
But why I don't recall

[Chorus:]
Free your mind - burn it out
Lead all fire to your house

I cannot tell you what to do
To help you free your mind
All of you don't call on others
We don't have much time
My hope and faith in humankind
Is fading more and more
Cold behaviour, empty eyes
It seems we're all at war
