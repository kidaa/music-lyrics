L. Wolf, R. Steier, D. Stag, J. B. Frank
Sitting in the dark 
Staring at the sky 
Within all of heavens eyes 
Wondering where and why 
Who brought all of this to 
Life 
Who knows what will come in 
Time 
Ooh, just to know what's 
The reason for making us 
Is what I would like to know 
Ooh, just to know where we 
Go when the earth is cold 
We may never know 
Stargazer 
Stargazer 
Live it out 
Meet the maker 
All the mystery 
Dreams and fantasy 
We touched on our way to 
See 
Living day by day 
Trying to getaway 
Dream on to another space
Ooh, just to know that you 
Are not the only one 
Who is searching on 
Ooh, just to know that 
Beyond there is something 
More 
For the rich and poor 
Stargazer 
Stargazer 
Live it out 
Meet the maker 
Oh, soon you will meet the 
Maker 
Stargazer 
Meet the maker 
Sooner or later 
You meet the maker
