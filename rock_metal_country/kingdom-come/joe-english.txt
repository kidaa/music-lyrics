Rehearsal Room "Hello"

Hello, call me Joe
Got a big mouth, that I know

Used to be a problem, didn't care at all
The only ones I've listened to were John & Paul
Hello I'm just Joe

Disbelieve and hate has risen more and more
Getting out of bed, meant another war
Hello, I'm just your Joe

[Chorus:]
Pardon me for sharing planet earth with you
I didn't mean no harm
To live and let live, is what I'm trying to say
It cannot be that hard

Hello, call me joe
Got a big mouth, now you know - yeah

Once I got a six-string, I could ease my mind
She saved me lot's of trouble, kept me out of sight
Hello, yeah

All the schools around have given up on me
Being left alone is all I've asked to be
Hello, I'm just Joe

Pardon me guys, for being alive
I didn't mean no harm
To live and let live, is what I'm trying to say
It cannot so hard

Hello I'm your Joe...

Helloooooooooooooo... - aaa !!!
