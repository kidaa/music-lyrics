Lyrics Lenny Wolf & Carol Tatum
Now, I have found that the 
Girl I love can't take the downsides 
I wish you'd talk it all out 
For me to understand it 
You always say that the 
Time is wrong to talk about it 
1 don't know how to go on 
If you don't drop your defenses
Chorus: 
Stay 
Can't keep running away 
Just say what you are looking for 
Stay 
'Cause you know if you don't 
Heartache is what you are heading for 
Now is the time, no one else 
Is going to do the talking 
If you just can't take a stand 
You might be better off walking
