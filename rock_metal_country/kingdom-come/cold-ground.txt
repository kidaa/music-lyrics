I don't know what's going on'
I don't know what's right or worng
All my senses turning on 
Don't know what I've become
Blaming fingers everywhere
Pretending they all care'
Faking sorrow while you're falling 
Cause inside they're scared
Empty minds keep on passing by
Lonely eyes going blind
Cold ground
Sad sounds
Angry people's all I see
What a hopeless misery
Fading in the holy#
Thoughts pretending to be free
Broken faith is what we're heading for!
Soon we'll face another wall
Cold ground
Sad sounds, bad signs
Cold ground
