Another day - will always come
Go ahead - take it on
Losing faith - it ain't the same
Like giving up - and putting blame

Don't rely - on anyone
You wanna strike - get it done
It's all about - reducing pain
No risk my friend - you'll never gain

We're all - live on hope
That's why - don't let go
Will it pay - who would know
Borrowed time - the way it goes
