Every time I see your pretty face*
I keep thinking, am I just your slave1
Holding on, holding on, that is all I can do
Every time we get into a fight.
You start crying and run out like a child
Holding on, holding on, that is all I can do
When you return, I will know you have learnt
It's the law of emotions
Holding you in silence, I will never let go
Don't care what it looks like, just because I said so
You will grow, you'll learn to sacrifice.
It ain't easy, I've been there many times
Holding on, holding on, that is all I can do
When you return, I will know you have learnt
Cannot escape, cause it's simply your fate
It's the law of emotions
Holding you in silence, I will never let go
Don't care what it looks like, just because I said so
