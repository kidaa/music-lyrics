Little wild thing 
Hard and cold she seems 
To one who does 
Not know her 
But deep down inside 
She's warm and bright 
I know her 
CHORUS 1 
Little wild thing 
You've got that something 
Little sweet thing 
Misunderstood thing 
She's heard it all 
And built a wall 
To save her 
And she does not like 
For someone to control her 
She ain't no fake 
Just give and take 
I love her 
CHORUS 2 
Such a precious mind 
Is hard to find 
I told her 
She did not reply 
Just gave a sign 
To love her 
CHORUS 3 
Little wild thing 
Little sweet thing 
Little wild thing 
You've got that something 
Little sweet thing
