Thinking what to do
I'm crazy over you
Telling you the truth
I never let you down

[Chorus:]
I'm gonna get you a thousand roses
Let me take you home tonight
No one ever will be as close as - like me
You're gonna love my gentle kisses

Can't believe your touch
Is giving me so much
Think I've said enough
Let me be your star
