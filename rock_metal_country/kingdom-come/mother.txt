When you're down
Nothing shows
Just somehow
She already knows
Magic bounds
Holding tight
Gentle sounds
Taking your side

Mother - she would know
Mother - 's clearing the smoke
Mother - She's a star
Mother - That's what you are

When you're down
She is close
Like the thorn
Protecting the rose

Good advice
Based on love
Helps you rise
When things getting rough

Don't forget
once you part
it's her blood
that's running your heart

When you're out
on your own
save the bridge
that's guiding you home
