We telling lies
Making us cry!
I have tried to find out why
We've got to win
We can't give in
I'm about to lose my mind
I wish I knew, just what to do
But until than I much
Rather be on my own
How long I don't know
Letting time go by
Things we have said
We do regret$
We should all be thinking twice
Before we talk
Before we walk
Into someone else's life
Carry our sound, gentle as clouds
But until than I much
Rather be on my own
How long I don't know
Letting time go by
Heaven's starting to fade
Soon it may be too late
