You're the one, who hides behind your own disguise
You think one of you belongs in every home
I'm the one you blinded, when we were alone
You can't see it's just for you I sing this song

Even though you're crying now, you don't know why
It's obvious, the harmony is already gone
Can't go back, we're wasting time the deed is done
See you later, I don't need you hanging on

Too late, I know your name
We just have lost the spark you played, heavyweight
Much too late, there is no more time, you know
You're not so precious, that I can't let go

Constantly assuring me that I'm the one
While you telling others what a fool I am
Now you finally figuered out, that you were wrong
Can't undo the scars, but now the pain is gone

The well is dry, time to say good bye
You did me wrong, thought I play along
I want out, now, cause you're not what I need
Get away, get away, no one like you is gonna make me bleed

The fire is gone, we've lost the spark
Now I know your name
