Keep it comin', y'all, uh

To all my young brothers and all my young sisters out there
Young fathers, young mothers
This album is dedicated to the family
We're losin' our families and we're told by God to hold it together
For what God has joined together, let no man, let no woman put asunder
Listen to what God says, uh

I'll never let you down
And I'll always be around
Everything you need
Try Me, try Me

I'm by your side
Even all through the night
I'll make everything all right
Try Me, try Me

I'll ease your pain
Just call My name
Whatever you need
Try Me, try Me

I will , I will
Whatever you need

Trust God, y'all
Trust God, y'all, uh

I'll never let you down
I'll always be around
Everything you need

I'm by your side
Even all through the night
I'll make everything all right

I'll ease your pain
Just call My name
Whatever you need

I will , I will
Whatever you need

Keep it comin', y'all, uh

So remember, next time you feel like walking away
God has made a promise to you
He will never leave you nor forsake you
He says this, Try Me, try Me
I don't care how bad things may get
Life could never throw anything at the relationship
That you and God cannot handle
He says, Try Me, try Me

I'll ease your pain
Just call My name
Whatever you need
Try Me, try Me

I will , I will
Whatever you need

Come on, come on

I'll never let you down
And I'll always be around
And everything you need

I'm by your side
Even all through the night
I'll make everything all right

Trust God, y'all, uh

Remember, my friends
There's a three-way partnership
You, your spouse and your God
There's no mountain too high
There's no valley too low
That you and your God cannot make it through
It does not matter what comes your way
You are already a victor
You're already a conqueror
Listen to what God says
He will be there, He will encourage you
He will pull you up
Hold on to her, hold on to him
Hold on to your God
And watch God do it

Watch Him do it
Hang in there, my brother
Hang in there, my sister
And watch God hold on to both of you

I will, I will
Whatever you need
