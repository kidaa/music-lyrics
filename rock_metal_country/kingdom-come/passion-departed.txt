I've tried so many times
Have lied when we were blind 
You act all so concerned 
It seems you'll never learn 
Don't say I'm evil inside 
You just reflect in my eyes 
And now stay out of sight 
I just wanna survive 
CHORUS 1 
We are sinking 
Fear is grinding 
Passion departed 
I'm not a taker 
Nor a heartbreaker 
Love can't be charted 
Please don't act so surprised
You should know what it's like
Sweet talk just does no good
Although I wish it would
CHORUS 2
It's not just who's terrified
Who's spinning round and round inside
I hope the answer will arrive
CHORUS 3
