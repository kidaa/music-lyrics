You think you got some problems
Thinking it's all so bad
The mirror shows a blind man
Got no face, lost his head

Look at you, so dead inside
Sitting home, got do life
Put my fist, right through your mind
Clearing out, the shit inside

You got no own opinion
Drink yourself away instead
You're staring at the green light
Still you would not go ahead

Look at you, so dead inside
Sitting home, got no life
Put my fist, right through your mind
Clearing out, the shit inside

Tried to pray, tried to lie
You ended up, so agonized
No one cares; I've seen it all
Lean on me, stand up tall
