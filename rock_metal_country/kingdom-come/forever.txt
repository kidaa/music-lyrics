So many faces, I've kissed before
Hope and illusion, I fed and ignored
Constantly hunting, craving the new
I've caused so much pain, a sad thing to do
39 seasons it took me to know
'til I figured out, which way I should go
Knowing the way, it sure ain't enough
But having found you, I've changed so much

Rather later, then never at all
I drop my defenses, catch my fall
I'm praying to God, that you're the one
The perfect match, my fear is gone

Nothing else matters, I'll give up control
The time I've wasted, If only I had known
Here I surrender, take my heart
Forever with you, in peace and love

[Chorus:]
A diamond I have found
So innocent and true
An everlasting love
Forever me and you

As simple it may sound
I'm so in love with you
My heart is crying out
Forever me and you
