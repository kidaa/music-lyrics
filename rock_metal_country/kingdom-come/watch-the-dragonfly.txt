There's a free heart - sailing 'round
Another sad heart - 'bout to drown
Throwing anker - in many seas
Couldn't stay there - had to leave

Madness in disguise - I feel it
So much time gone by

Tried the mountain - tried the sea
City high life - casualty
Caught the rainbow - blew my horn
Let the moonglow - guide my call

Madness in disguise - I feel it
So much time gone by
Sparkles left my eye - receding
Watch the dragonfly

On the surface - I can see
Diving deeper - not for me
