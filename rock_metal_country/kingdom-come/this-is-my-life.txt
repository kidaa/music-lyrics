To many years kept passing missing the big sound
To many years I'm coming playing my heart out

Don't ask me why
Got no money
Looking for discounts
Driven inside
Call me dummy
I'm jumping the greyhound

It ain't wrong or right
This is my life
All those signs
Saying Showtime

Now I'm back
I am so glad
Thinking back
Have a good laugh

Never too late
Chasing good times
In through the outdoor
Got a cool band
We're ready
Now heading westbound
