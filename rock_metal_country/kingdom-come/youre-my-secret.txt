Take some time and be all mine
Leave the worries behind
Let me feel the magic touch
I've been missing so much

Still I come and I will go
Like the wind - who knows

[Chorus:]
Let my lovelight cover you slow
Like the rainbow, whereever you go
You're my secret, who needs to know, to know...

Didn't know how strong I feel
Love has found me, it's real
Still I've got to leave you babe
I'll be back if you'll wait

The heart of freedom 's pounding high
Half is yours, half is mine

You're my lovelight
You're my secret
Who needs to know...
