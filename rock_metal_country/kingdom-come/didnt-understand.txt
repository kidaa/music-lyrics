I stood outside your door
remembering times before
I walked your town at night
letting go and cried

[Chorus:]
I didn't understand
It didn't make no sense
true love that's what is was
I've never changed my course

I hung to my dream
nothing's what it seemed
I wished you knew I'm here
to help me wipe my tears

[Chorus]

It ain't no easy walk
you needed much support
I drove a million miles
to catch another smile

[Chorus]

[Chorus-out:]
I know you felt the same
You rather live in pain
