I hear you calling me, saying my child Hold on
And I feel you touching me reminding me to be strong.
Though I must admit its hard for me to see through this hurt and pain.
But in your arms I know I'll be free some day.

Sometimes it seems to me that the power of love is gone
Everyone fights that they want peace, I wonder where we went wrong.
But in my dreams there is a place where the sun last always
I know its hard for you to see but soon there come a day

Chorus:
Love will never end
Broken hearts will mend again mend again
Yesterday has been replaced 
Now we have another chance
To save someone who's lost who's lost
Give them hope no matter the cost
We'll stand together come what may
We'll all be free someday

I know it's not easy, to laugh with tears on your face
But my friend just believe in me I know there's a better place
Where everyone will be the same, and we won't have to cry no more won't have to cry no more
So when this world turns you away
Just know my friend there will be a day

Chorus:
Love will never end
Broken hearts will mend again mend again
Yesterday has been replaced 
Now we have another chance
To save someone who's lost 
Give them hope no matter the cost no matter the cost
We'll stand together come what may come what may
We'll all be free someday

Don't forget without the rain, flowers wither the ground
My friend the clouds won't last always, I promise you 
There will be a day when

Chorus:
Love will never end
Broken hearts will mend again 
Yesterday has been replaced 
Now we have another chance another chance
To save someone who's lost Save someone who's lost
Give them hope no matter the cost 
We'll stand together come what may 
We'll all be free someday 2x's
Free 3x's
We'll all be free someday
