Now I know how it feels
This is not just a dream
All I can see is you
I need to be with you
Angels have come to show
Just which way I should go
All I can see is you
I need to be with you
CHORUS 1
You're the one who changed my life
When you said you'll be all mine
I'm just scared of losing sight
Can't resist it no more
Can't hold back my own thoughts
All I can see is you
I need to be with you
CHORUS 2
You have changed my sense of time
I can't get you off my mind
I'm afraid you're stuck for life
I know,
The past made become my worst enemy
But this time, it's gonna work
CHORUS 3
Repeat chorus 1 + 2
