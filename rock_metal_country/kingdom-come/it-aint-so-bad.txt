Gonna call my friend
Who can understand
When it's rumbling inside
Gonna cruise the town
Throwing thouhgts around
Just my friend and I

's pretty hard at times
Trying to unwind
Finding ways to let go
Need to ease my mind
Keep my head in line
Gotta cool it, I know

[Chorus:]
Hard to hold back - when I'm loosing ground
It ain't so bad - when my friends around
Don't need advise - when I'm feeling down
Just a bit time

Going for a walk
There's no need to tald
Letting spirits come closer
Peace is coming back
Soon I can relax
I can feel it take over
It's taking over
