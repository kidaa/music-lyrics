I wonder who really cares!
What is happening everywhere
TV is bringing the news
More killing, more abuse
BRIDGE 1
We've fought too
We've lied too
We've talked too much
I wonder who I can blame
I just can not call a name
No guilt is crossing
My mind
But sadness deep inside
BRIDGE 2
CHORUS 1
We've chosen to shoot us
And now we're the losers
We're fighting day after day
Taking orders and obey
Deep down we're feeling the same
Distrust and fear of pain
BRIDGE 3
CHORUS 2
We've chosen to shoot us
And now we're the losers
BRIDGE 4
CHORUS 3
We've chosen to shoot us
