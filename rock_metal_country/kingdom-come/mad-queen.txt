You caught me with your eyes
I can feel what's on your mind
Just like a gentle breeze
Touching only when you please
CHORUS 1
Shut down
She's a mad queen
Watch out
She's a love machine
I fall into a trance
Every time I watch you dance
Let's end what you've begun
Sure your love, hat you have done
CHORUS 2
CHORUS 3
CHORUS 4
CHORUS 5
