I can hear the silence, in the dark
Closing in the distance, to my heart.
Now and than a quick glance, to the stars,
Coming of a deep trance, peace at large
Like soothing shelter over me
I have come to love her mystery
Making me surrender, letting go
Guiding me so tender, very slow
When the night is falling
I hear voices calling
Like an aimless shooter
I'm a Twilight Cruiser
