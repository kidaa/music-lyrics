Lyrics: Lenny Wolf & Carol Tatum
Here I am looking for answers 
Driven hard with no thought of surrender 
If I knew where I could find them 
I could spare you the act of a madman
Chorus: 
Shot down 
Scared to fall 
Where do I belong 
Shot down 
Can't recall 
Where did I go wrong 
Winds of war, holy disaster 
If I could I would light it with laughter 
Breathing hard is what I've been doing 
I just hope that no evil is brewing
