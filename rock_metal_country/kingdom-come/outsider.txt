I don't mind
Simple rules so we won't live like cavemen
But I won't
Let them take what is left of my freedom
CHORUS 1
So tired
Worn out
My tears are gone
Outsider
But not the only one
All I hear
's don't do this, don't do that
You're a madman
Had enough
I'm not just their political trash can
CHORUS 2
You may think
I'm a fool who is living in dreamland
Rather that
Than I like you who are walking on quicksand, oh
CHORUS 3
So tired
Worn out
My tears are gone
Outsider
