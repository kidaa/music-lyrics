Living in a strange time
Fake behaviour, sad minds
Friendly words, a warm touch
For a lot of them, it's just too much

Counting on a good friend
Finding grip in quick sand
It doesn't take a wise man
When love takes your cold hand

You've been so unkind
Now you don't feel good
Wish to turn back time
Changing things you should

Waist your time in coolness
And you will not find kindness
The devil does no talking
The lonely keep on walking

Someday - somehow
You'll know - what I've talked about

Time to realign
Take a closer look
Start to undisguise
The pages of your book
