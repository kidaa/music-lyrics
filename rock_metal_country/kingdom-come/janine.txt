I strayed all over town
Memories all around 
Long time since I have seen
My good old friend Janine
Always on my mind
Wondering if she's fine
I called her on the phone
I wish I should have known
Janine...
It happened all so fast
We both had such a blast
I thought it was a dream
The wildest one I've seen
Her body full of life
Got me mesmerized
It shook me very hard 
For the money she had asked
Can't believe what's going on+
Look around what you've become, Janine!
Watch your back and be alert
Cash is ruling our world, Janine
She's putting on a mask
Is loving you for cash!
I told her, please watch out
