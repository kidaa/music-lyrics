Sad songs, strange thoughts, in my head&
Can't laugh, can't cry, going mad 
Don't know, which way to go
No one can help, I know!
Endless questions, coming on 
No direction, what is wrong
Loving, caring, I do
Still I'm feeling so blue
Should have known
I travel in danger zone
Scared to show!
It's not only her, she knows
Hate to see you hurt inside 
Help me fight it by my side";
Sweet words, won't do no good
Should have known
I travel in danger zone
Scared to show!
It's not only her, she knows
Should have known
I travel in danger zone
Scared to show!
It's not only her, she knows
Had my fun
Now it's too late to run
I have lied
