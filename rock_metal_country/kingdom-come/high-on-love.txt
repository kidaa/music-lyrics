Can't believe how much I love you
I just hope that you love me to
I do, I do, I do

When you're gone it's so hard to breathe
Can't deny that it's you I need
It's true, I do, it's true

[Chorus:]
Gonna get high on love
Gonna get high on all your love
As long as you're mine, I know
No one can break me down, it shows

Love your smile and the way you talk
Love your eyes and the way you walk
I do, I do

I'll surrender, I'll give up
Need your kisses and soothing touch
I do, I do, yeah, I do
