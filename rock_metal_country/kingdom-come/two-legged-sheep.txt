The way you look depends on
Where you go, what you do
Sing along the right song
Celebrate your spiritual youth

Don't mind, being you
Follow trends like a sheep would do
Don't think, make no sound
Take no stand, don't you look around

Demanding a solution
Waving with a flag up high

You're hiding your confusion
Shouting words you don't know why

Don't mind, being you
Follow trends like a sheep would do
Don't think, make no sound
Lake no stand, don't you look around

Standing in the fire on your own
Now you're saying if I had only known
Busy making friends they never were
Busy fitting in you were so scared

Looking for direction where to go
Dressing just like them is all you know
Afraid to fee! rejection getting bruised
Never learned to walk in your own shoes

Don't mind, being you
Follow trends like a sheep would do
Don't think, make no sound
Lake no stand., don't you look around
Don't mind
Follow trends
Don't think
Take no stand, don't you look around
