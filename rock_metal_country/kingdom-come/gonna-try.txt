Winds of change is blowing strong, head on
I've ignored whats going on, too long
I can hear a distant voice, saying leave her
While my heart is crying out, I need her

ain't afraid to stand alone
To start over
It's just a shame as time goes by
I'm growing colder

I believe in someone wrong
Is what my friends said
I kept hanging on too long
Now it turned bad

Gonna try -To get away
Gonna cry -Stay away

She has promised on and on
Baby, I'll change
While I'm scared of what will come
With the next page

Now I'm scared of what will come
It's tearing me apart

Gonna smile -Another day
Dynamite -Is in my veins

I don't care who's got the blame
It's just a sad thing
Cannot wait to feel the pain
When she's leaving
