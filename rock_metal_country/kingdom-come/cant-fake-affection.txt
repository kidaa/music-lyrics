While you've given all you can
You were torn between two men
You sent letters full of hope
All afraid to let me go

You have told me on and on
Please be patient, please be strong
All the love I felt inside
Kept me quiet, kept me blind

[Chorus:]
All my attentions
Changing directions
Can't fake affection
Where's no attraction

I don't put the blame on you
You have chosen what to do
No way in and no way out
Signs were clear without a doubt

After all what we've been through
No way back for me and you
Too much damage has been done
What I felt is now all gone
