We've come a real long way to be with you
It's not that easy doing what we do
There are those lonely times and then there's happiness
Now it's lime we gonna do what we do best
Get it on
Get it on

There's an electric feeling in the air
The night is young and there is lots to share
Don't you feel the storm
I feel it raging on and on
Get it on

And now you know what we can do for you
Something has come to life between us, too
The boys are pushing hard and playing out their best
Now it's time to let your body do the rest
Get it on
