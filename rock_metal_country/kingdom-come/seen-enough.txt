Can you see me
Can you feel me
Can you hear me cry

I've been bleeding
I've been waiting
Help me free my mind

Finding you, is all to do

[Chorus:]
I have seen enough
Need a soothing touch
Someone I can trust
Everlasting love

She is out there
I will find her
And I'll stop to run

Think she's close now
's getting warm now
like the rising sun

Shine on me, help me see

Think I'm getting close
Never gave up hope
She will come, I know
I need you so... ...you know
