got it all - everlasting sunshine
can't recall - when I had a bad time
something's wrong it's getting colder
things have changed but it ain't over
need a break - allowing all the changes

[Chorus:]
easy talking hardline
showing off your sharp mind
putting on a sad smile
doesn't help - never mind
take a walk in my shoes
facing all the bad news
all you'd see are stop signs
everlasting red lights

coming down - taking on a hard way
finding out - when to make the right play
sticking to my own commitment
gotta wait - there's gonna be a right time

letting go - believing in a good cause
lot of times I've almost dropped it
my inner voice made me fight it
the call is out - the mission is believing
