[Originally by The Beatles]

Words are flowing out
Like endless rain into a paper cup,
They slither while they pass
They slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind,
Possessing and caressing me
Jai guru deva, om

Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light
Which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe,
Thoughts meander like a restless wind
Inside a letter box
They tumble blindly
As they make their way across the universe

Jai guru deva, om

Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of earth
Are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love
Which shines around me like a million suns
And calls me an and on across the universe

Jai guru deva om

Nothing's gonna change my world

Jai guru deva om
