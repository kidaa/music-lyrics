Look at us, we're so in need
Love can't wait for you to cheat
To spread it's wing of pain and hate
Weak enough we call it fate

Thousand years, we never learned
Signing papers, promising terms

Friends in spirit, that's the key
Sharing pain and victory
It's all in us, slam the bell
Reaching heaven, fighting hell

Hunting you with perfect skills
It sucks you in and breaks your will
Once you're caught into the trap
It spits you out and starts to laugh

Thousand years, we never learned
Signing papers, promising terms

Friends in spirit, that's the key
Sharing pain and victory
It's all in us, slam the bell
Reaching heaven, fighting hell

Diamond rings they come and go
Like Juliette and Romeeo
Starting out, find a friend
A solid base until the end
