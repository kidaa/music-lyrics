Sec your heart, following the line
Promises, another kiss good by

Take a guess, what you brought to life
What a mess, you have left behind

Took a ride, thought I'd never take
Clarified, having set things straight

Who would think
I would ever learn
Removed the sting
I finally came to terms

Go ahead, hammering my mind
Give it up, my heart is turning blind

Loving you,
It's like jumping traps and mines
Leaving you, is keeping me alive
Who would think, I would ever learn
Removed the sting
I finally came to terms

Pardon me, think I've lost my charm
C'est la vie, sure you meant no harm
