The time has come I have to leave again.
I will be back but I just don't know when
My heart is aching every time I leave
I can't explain the force inside of me
I'm trying hard to keep my tears inside
The years have taught me how to ease my mind
I travel high above the clouds.
The sun comes out just as I'm looking out
What have I become
Always on the run
Where do I belong
Always on the run
It's good to know that someone cares
When I'll arrive my friends will all be there
I've done it many times before
Don't know if I can take it anymore
