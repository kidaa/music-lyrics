I've seen a lot of cultures
Have enjoyed their touch
But as we're growing closer
It ain't working much

This ain't a black or white song
Just a thought I had
If you believe that I'm wrong
Give me hope instead

[Chorus:]
History has shown
We just keep colliding
Only rainbows know
Where the future's hiding
