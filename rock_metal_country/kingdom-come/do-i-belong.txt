Lyrics: Lenny Wolf a Carol Tatum
Been so long since I felt so strong 
I'm scared to fall in love 
Many times I've been hurt before 
It seems I can't get enough 
Since your touch put a spell on me 
I cannot ease my mind 
Is it you I've been looking for 
I'm searching deep down inside
Chorus: 
Hit me by surprise 
Right between the eyes 
Do I belong 
Do I belong 
Are you the one? 
Reaching for the sky 
I just hope that in time we'll know 
It's not a fairy tale 
Disbelief, that is all I feel 
I've been through heaven and hell 
Even though after what I know 
I'm breaking down the walls 
Feeling strong whether right or wrong 
I'm going to get through it all
