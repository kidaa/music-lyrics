Sure, I know
How it feels and why you're hurting so
It shows
All I know is that you'll be just fine

I'll be there for you, my friend
Take my helping hand
I will never let you drown
While you're feeling down

No more cry

[Chorus:]
Get up my friend
It's over
Don't set yourself on fire

Don't you hide
Scream it out and free your tortured mind
Take time
That is how - you're gonna grow inside
Don't look down

It's hard to get by
Don't lose it
You'll rise and shine
I know it
