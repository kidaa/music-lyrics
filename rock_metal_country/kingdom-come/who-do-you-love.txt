Who do you love 
Tell me now 
Spit it out 
No more 
Smalltalk 
Shut the door 
Say the words 
Clear the air 
Look inside 
It's right there 
With your eyes 
You can't see 
'Til your heart 
Is set free 
Who do you love 
I believe 
You don't know 
Time's up 
Can't wait 
Anymore 
Say the words 
Clear the air 
Look inside 
It's right there 
With your eyes 
You can't see 
'Til your heart 
Is set free 
Who do you love 
Get it right 
Move along 
It's your show 
Choose now 
And let me know 
Say the words 
Clear the air 
Look inside 
It's right there 
With your eyes 
You can't see 
'Til your heart 
Is set free 
Make the choice 
Wastin' time 
'Cause I won't 
Stand in line
