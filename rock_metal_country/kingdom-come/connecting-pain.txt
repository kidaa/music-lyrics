Hey man, what have you done
Hey man, another run
Lost minds, try to forget
Sad eyes, turning mad

Stealer - take all you can
Healer - ain't your name my man

Cool man, connecting the pain
Cool man, make your claim
Hey man, it's all coming back
Can't hide, by changing flags

Stealer - take all you can
Healer - ain't your name my man
Dealer - spreading the trap
Preacher- cannot save the dead

Go on keep avoiding the truth
Soon you won't be amused
Now you're feeling so tall
That sure ain't your fault
