Lyrics: Lenny Wolf & Carol Tatum
I should go 
Even though 
I've forgiven all the lies 
That you told 
Scared to have you back again 
People just don't change 
After all I know if I pretend 
I'd be lying just the same
Chorus: 
Now you're wondering why 
Things did not turn out right 
Got to change your style 
You're not the only I know 
Long ago 
Should have known 
You were young and scared to be 
On your own 
Tried to luck on me again 
Fooled me for a while 
I can see the games we played before 
And it only makes me smile
