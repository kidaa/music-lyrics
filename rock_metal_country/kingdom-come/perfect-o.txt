Passion rises between us, 
Babe 
Wanna take you in my arms 
Slide your body down on 
Mine 
Come and move me like 
Ocean waves 
Ooh, let go 
I hear you moan 
Oh, perfect 'o' 
Touch the secret inside 
You, babe 
While our bodies shakin' so 
Oh, the way you tease and 
Please 
It's only you I want to rock 
And roll
Ooh, let it go 
I hear you moan 
Oh, perfect 'o' 
Oh yeah 
Perfect'o'
