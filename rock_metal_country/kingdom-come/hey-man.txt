Hey man You're loosing your mind
See how you behave
Why man think for a while
You're digging your own grave
Don't you act so surprised
The dead end has arrived

Loosing touch - you get up tight
Constantly - getting colder
Go ahead - ignore the signs
The devil smiles - on your shoulder

Hey man there's more to be found
If you would just let go
Hey man stop and look around
Watch the flowers grow
