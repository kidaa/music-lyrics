The stars are closing in tonight
I feel so strange deep down inside
I have never felt like this before

Think I'm drifting in and out
Reality is lost and found
Have I finally reached the secret door

[Chorus:]
In search of the light
Just look inside
The mighty old man
Will hold your hand

No one knows the masterplan
Will I see my friends again
Is life the brigde we all are ment to pass

When love has caught you with a smile
You can run a million miles
Faith my friend is gonna make it last

[Chorus 2:]
In search of the light
Just look inside
The mighty old man
Will lend a hand
