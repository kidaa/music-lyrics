Keeping cool inside
I walk the line
People crossing my Sine
I don't mind

Men with a mind
Got a darkroom inside
The fool on the hill
Never wanting to kill

Now 1 can't go on, gotta change what's wrong, inside
Gonna blow the hood, making understood, my fight
Gonna jump the tide, coming back alive, who knows?
Having peace in mind, it's a long long time, ago

The room within, where I've done all my sins
Can't escape anymore, cannot find the door

How I can't go on, gotta change whats wrong, inside
Gonna blow the hood, making understood, my fight
Gonna jump the tide, coming back alive, who knows?
Having peace in mind, it's a long long time, ago

Gonna jump the tide, oohhh
Gonna blow the hood, making understood, my fight
Having peace in mind, it's a long long time, ago
