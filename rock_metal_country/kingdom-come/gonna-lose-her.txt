Invitation to a false solution
Too much sadness, turned to madness
No illusion

White temptation, in a lonely nation
You've been reaching out, now you've lost your ground
Poor sensation

Gonna loose her
Can't control her
ain't no healer
I've tried to help her out

Words of wisdom
Never made you listen
You knew wrong from right
Still you had to try
Sad decision
