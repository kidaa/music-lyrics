Long ago - across the sea
German heart - that was me
took plane - came to see
Young at heart - twenty three
Got a chance - took it on
Wrote a song - called "Get it on"
Got a band - loud and proud
Wrote a smash - just don't know how

[Chorus:]
America - inside my heart
This song's for you - with all my love

Took a break - times have changed
Letting go - re-arrange
Strong belief - riding on
Here we are - KINGDOM COME

I don't care - where you're from
Just be cool - Get it on
