I... have burned my name
I... got no complaint
I... won't rise and shout
I... don't think out loud

A perfect citizen
A war makers dream
Never talk loudly
Avoiding a scene
Right sir, yes mom
Whatever you say
Political dream men
Behave

I... don't take the chance
I... won't raise my hand
I... don't put out blame
I... don't care to gain

A perfect citizen
A war makers dream
Never talk loudly
Avoiding a scene
Right sir, yes mom
Whatever you say
Political dream men
Behave

I... just sit and wait
I... just call it fate
I... have got no grace
I... have got no face

I... won't rise and shout
I... don't think out loud
I... just sit and wait
I... just call it fate
