Flying like a free bird
Worries never known
Drifting in my own world
The clouds i call my home

All the space i care for
Borders out of sight
The sun is taking over
Reflecting my eyes

Never mind me dreaming
Some of you may know
Far behind the sad face
There's fire growing slow

Hard to keep on smiling
When life has come undone
Hope is no illusion
The seed of good to come

Look at me now
I have done allright
It sure would be nice
Had i wings to fly
