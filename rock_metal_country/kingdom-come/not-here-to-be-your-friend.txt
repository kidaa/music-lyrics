Think you got it figured out
The wisdom on your tongue so loud
Thriving on what others do
Pointing fingers, call it news

Once you have left your hole
Your mind is still facing walls
The circle is touching ends
I'm not here to be your friend

Solutions easy come my friend
Show us how and take a stand
But should you try it on your own
You're fading right down to your bones

Once you have left your hole
Your mind is still facing walls
The circle is touching ends
I'm not here to be your friend

Never mind how I show
Don't need to say hello
A calling so hard to find
Once found it never dies
