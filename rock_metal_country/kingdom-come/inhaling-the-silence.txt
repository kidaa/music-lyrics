Let it be - let come undone
Watch the clouds playing with the sun
Butterflies show their lemon wing
Listening to the sparrow sing
Blue sky so inviting
So much beauty rising

Ladybugs tickleling my face
Apple trees reaching into space
The hummingbird hovers in the wind
Wondering what if i where him

Warm light so unwinding
No thought pleasure sighing

Picture yourself right there in garden bloom
Clearing your mind
Nobody there but you - just get in tune
Take all your time

Open land everlasting green
Forever here a picture so serene
Sand of time moving through my hand
Simple life makes a happy man

Warm light so unwinding
No thought pleasure sighing

Picture yourself right there in garden bloom
Clearing your mind
Nobody there but you - just get in tune
Take all your time

Inhaling the silence of our nature's room
Open your eye
Trigger the rythm of a joyful heart
Give it a try
