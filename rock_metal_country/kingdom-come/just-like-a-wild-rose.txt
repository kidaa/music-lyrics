L. Wolf, M. Wolff
Two days in time 
Seems like she's mine 
Now i'm addicted to 
Something inside 
All of her charms 
Wrapped in my arms 
I never knew, I never knew 
I'd see so much and yet be 
Blind 
The storm's coming slow 
She'll love me and go 
She's just like a wild rose 
Electric touch 
Almost too much 
In between love and pain 
Passionate flames 
Never forget 
Ain't finished yet
I never knew, I never knew 
That I could feel so strong 
Inside 
The storm's coming slow 
She'll love me and go 
She's just like a wild rose 
Walking on clouds 
Don't want to come down 
Ain't leaving town 
While she's still around 
The storm's coming slow 
She'll love me and go 
She's just like a wild rose
