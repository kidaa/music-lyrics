Mary Mary thank you
When I look back over my life thank you
And all the times you brought me through thank you
I just wanna say father, thank you

When I was lonely, and needed some one to hold me
You were beside me, when my nights were cold and lonely
You never let me down when no one else could be found I
Always count on you to see me through, I'm telling you that,
You are the reason, I'm alive and I'm still breathing
For me you gave your life and now my life it has no meaning
When I think about your grace, and I finally see your face
There's one thing I need to say, wanna say, yeah

Thank you Lord for loving me
Thank you Lord for keeping me
Thank you Lord for that day you came and broke the chains and set me free
Thank you for another chance, you gave me joy now I can dance
All the people open up your mouth and let me here you say thank you thank you thank you thank you
Thank you lord for one more day, you made the raindrops go away
Thank you 'cause my pain is gone, I know it came to make me strong
Thank you for another chance, you gave me joy now I can dance
All the people open up your mouth and let me here you say thank you thank you thank you thank you
