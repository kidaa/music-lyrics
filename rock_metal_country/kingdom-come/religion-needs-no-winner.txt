Being burned by the flame
I believe it's not the same
A sign of the time
It's a very dangerous game
I simply can't ignore
What's causing so much war
Religion's no excuse
For all the damned abuse

We're shedding blood in vein
So intense, so much pain
The truth we cannot see
An illusion of being free

Believe in something good
You definitely should
Wanna change it, make a deal
Get back to what is real

Cry out - start to conquer your doubts
Reach out - love is showing you how

[Chorus:]
Religion - needs no winner
White pigeon - can't be the sinner
