L. Wolf, D. Stag, J. B frank, M. Wolff
Standing in this garden 
That we shared for years 
Seeing paradise through 
All our dreams and tears 
Scattered seeds along the 
Way and saw them grow 
At times we've seen the 
Mighty mountain walls 
Come and go 
And stll the wind is gonna 
Blow 
Sometimes fast and 
Sometimes slow 
Floating on an ocean, our 
Ship without a sail 
Who are we to try and stop 
What will or won't prevail 
And if we slip into the 
Darkness of a stormy 
Night 
We're only drifting with the 
Tide, my friends 
It's alright 
And still the wind is gonna 
Blow 
Sometimes fast and 
Sometimes slow 
Standing in this garden in a 
Million years 
Others in our place when 
We're no longer here 
Seeking answers in the 
Ashes of our lives 
And they will find their 
Place in time, my friends 
It's alright 
And still the wind is gonna 
Blow 
Sometimes fast and 
Sometimes slow
