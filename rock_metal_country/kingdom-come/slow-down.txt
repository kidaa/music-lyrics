Hasting around, all over town
Living in a rich man's world
And still you feeling down

I'm feeling fine
ain't got no time
Words you're saying on and on
Inside you going blind

Slow down

Look like a clown
Who's going down
You should take some time my friend
And start to look around

Can't get enough
Loosing your touch
Haven't seen the sunset
'Cause you're running far too much

Slow down, slow down
