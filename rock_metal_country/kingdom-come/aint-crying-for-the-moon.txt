Tried to believe in love
Tried to believe in something
It's tearing me all apart
No use to keep pretending
A lone wolf, keeps straying
Can't find a heart to live in
Do I believe in love?
I'm lying, I can't give up

Anybody knowing what to do
Anybody feels the way I do
The end is getting closer far to boon
I ain't crying for the moon

I'm playing the king of heart
Trying to top my scoring
Got no queen in my deck of cards
Wanna stop my dice from rolling
Obsession?
Depression?
My life, a lonely mission
A king without a crown?
Who's the fool, behind this frown?

Anybody knowing what to do
Anybody feels the way I do
The end is getting closer far to soon
Keeping faith in you
Anybody knowing what to do
Looking for the certain kind of you
The end is getting closer far to soon
I ain't crying for the moon

Looking for shelter, helter skelter
Looking for shelter, looking for you

Ready for showdown, fighting my last round
Claiming my steal crown, I'm ready lor you

I ain't crying, for the moon
When I'm calling you
Leave behind the past we knew
Knowing what to do
Mo regrets no substitutes
Nothing i could lose
The wolf is howling at the moon
Having paid my dues
