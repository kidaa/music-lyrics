Everybody needs
Somebody who'll be there
Someone to wipe the tears and make you smile
So if you need someone
That will not judge you when you fall
No matter what you've done
My love will answer when you call

Chorus
So after your heart's been torn in two
And you just don't know what to do
After the rain has come and gone
And the sun still won't shine
After your friends have walked away
And you've run out of words to say
After you've tried everything else
Then try me. Oh yeah

Life can make you cry
And hurt you deep inside
I promise you I know the pain you feel
So if you let me love you 
I can take those clouds away
I'll fill you up with joy 
And all your wrong, I will erase.

Chorus
So after your heart's been torn in two
And you just don't know what to do Uh huh
After the rain has come and gone I know
And the sun still won't shine Shine
After your friends have walked away Un huh
And you've run out of words to say
After you've tried everything else Tried everything else
Then try me. Me

Even though you hurt me 
And sometimes forget my name
My love is unconditional Uh huh
That means that it will never ever change

Chorus
So after your heart's been torn in two
Yeah
And you just don't know what to do You don't know what to do
After the friends has come and gone Yeahand gone
Still won't shine Still wont shine It still wont shine
After your friends have walked away Theyve turned their backs on you
Run out of words to say you dont know what to say
Tried everything else Hey yeah
Tried everything else tried everything else
Tried everything else Oh
Said you can, you can try me 
Try Me Oh
Try me Try me
Try me Reach out your hand 
Try me And Ill be there 
Call me You can call me
Try me
Whatever  So whatever you need
You can try me
Oh
