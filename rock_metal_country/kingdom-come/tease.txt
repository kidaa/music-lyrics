You, make me crazy and I don't know why
You, got me working for another night
You always keep me waiting
You push me to a frenzy
Now I know a better way
I won't take this another day

[Chorus:]
Your special touch, gives me so much
Why do you fight, when it seems so right
You outta know, you gotta take a chance
Why can't you see, someday you will know

Still I wanna tell you, you don't even have a clue
Never was another way
You're missing, what you have today
You're living in another world
Using me for all your thrills
Look at me and face the news
Can't you see, you're gonna loose

You're living in another world
Thinking you're the only girl
Girl, you're just so hard to please
You're nothing but another tease
