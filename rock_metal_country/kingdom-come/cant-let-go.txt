Young at heart you're all confused, I know
That's the reason why you've let me go
Can't forget you, even though I tried
Cannot stop the love I feel inside

Time alone to find out where to go
That is what you needed, now I know
Back then I just never understood
Why you needed time, when things were good

[Chorus:]
I just can't let go, 'cause I need you so
Yes, I do believe in you and I
I do, yes I do, ohh it's true
I love you

You sent letters which put at ease
Lovely notes, which helped me out to breathe
Time is gonna show where you belong
I just hope, it doesn't take too long

I was never hurt like this before
All alone and constantly at war
Peaceful pain is crawling up and down
Scared if you would ever let me drown

I just can't let go, 'cause I need you so
Yes, I do believe in you and I
Never felt so right, from deep down inside
Do I have to burn, for our love to return

It's you that I need, only you
I love you

I need you to get back, baby
I need you to come back, baby

I just can't let go... ...I love you
