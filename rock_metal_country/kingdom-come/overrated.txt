L. Wolf, R. Steier, J. B. Frank
Eyes like a flame 
Looking cut and clean 
She's got her ways 
To twist the magic in my 
Dreams 
She had me living in a cloud 
Until I saw and found out 
She shared her love all 
Over town 
Oh, yeah, i've gotta get out
Overrated, uh-huh 
Overrated 
Oh yes she was 
Overrated, uh-huh 
Overrated 
Took her along 
Walking through the park 
She did not care 
'Bout the beauty of the 
Stars 
I kept on digging deep inside 
To show her wrong and 
What's right 
Too bad she fell so far 
From grace 
Oh yeah, my time was a waste 
Overrated, uh-huh 
Overrated 
Oh yes she was 
Overrated, uh-huh 
Overrated 
She sure was lacking 
Some of that sensitivity 
Oh, yeah 
Overrated, uh-huh 
Overrated 
Oh yes she was 
Overrated, uh-huh 
Overrated
