L. Wolf, M. Wolff
Mean dirty joe 
Where did you go 
Stole your best friends 
Love away 
Left without a sound 
Look at you r face 
Cold hard disgrace 
Guilty of a broken trust 
Oh, took his heart and 
Threw it down 
Mean dirty joe 
Carry that load 
Maybe you regret it now 
Maybe you just don't 
Now you're alone 
Run down the road 
Shouldn't have done that 
Dirty deed 
Oh, now you best keep 
Movin' on 
Where did you go 
Where did you go 
Go 
You're really all alone 
All alone 
Now you cannot go home
