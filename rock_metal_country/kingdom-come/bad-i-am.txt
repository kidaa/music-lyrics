I'm a bad boy
Need a new toy
On my next chase
I need a new taste

Gonna cruise the town
Gonna hunt you down

Got bad behaviour
And don't do favours

[Chorus:]
Now you know just how bad I am
Gonna take as much as I can
I'm a hopeless, dangerous man

Pleasure cruising
Is all I'm doing
Got no trouble in mind
At least not most of the time

But when I'm striking
Fear is rising

Oh yeah, bad news are coming your way...

You're damned right, saying how bad I am
You can't kill the wolf in a man
You can try as hardest as you can

Yes, I know just how bad I am...
