Been looking for some joy to come around
I been praying for some sunshine 
Been looking for a love 
That I could call mine 
See I cried for so long 
Now I'm ready for the tears to be gone 
So , I'm calling you right now 
Cause you said that I could make it
Lord anyhow

So I'm gonna wait On you
Cause I know that you're gonna bring
Me through
I know you're gonna make Me strong
Cause deliverance is coming and
It won't be long
The storm is gonna pass Away
I beleive it's gonna be 
A brighter day
I can finally see  The sun
So I waiting on till 
Thy kingdom come

This world could be cold 
And I can feel the hurting 
In my soul 
But the pain it won't last long
Cause I know that you're gonna make me strong

Weeping may endure for night 
But the lord said it's gonna be alright
