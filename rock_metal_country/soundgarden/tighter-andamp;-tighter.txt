Shadow face
Blowing smoke and talking wind
Lost my grip
Fell too far to start again
A sudden snake
Found my shape and tells the world
Remember this
Remember everything is just black
Or burning sun

And I hope it's a sweat ride
Slip tight for me
Sleep tight for me I'm goneWarm and sweet
Swinging from a window ledge
Tight and deep
One last sin before I'm dead
A sucking holy wind
Will take me from this bed tonight
And blow the wits
Another hits me and I have to say goodbye

And I hope it's a sweet ride
Here for me tonight
Cause I feel I'm going
Feel I'm slowing down
