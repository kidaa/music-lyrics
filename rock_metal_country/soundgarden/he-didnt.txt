He did nothing perfectly
He did nothing quite well
He did nothing perfectly, much better than anyone I've ever seen
He did nothing all the time
He did nothing constantly
He did nothing everyday, more often than anyone I've ever seen

He failed, and he failed miserably
He failed, and he failed quite bad
He failed, and he failed miserably
What's better he never even had to try
