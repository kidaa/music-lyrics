Written by Chris Cornell 

I know youre half awake yeah I know hate
And I know how you do it
Hold it dont it out
Dont get it right or wrong no I dont get it
I know youre afraid half amazed
All insane I know its all a cage
And all arrange and altogether gone


Cause you and me were average
With simple minds and lungs and eyes and skin
You and me were hopeless with nowhere hearts
So tear it out and open it
Im giving blood tonight dont care how dont care why
Im giving blood tonight and I feel just like
I could give it all


Show me and hand me down and hang me up alone
and cold and bury me
Show me and throw me out and hold me down
And air me out and wear me
I know youre half afraid half amazed all insane
I know its all a cage and all a rage
And altogether gone


Come away and come with me and come around and come and see
And cover up and come along before race before the calm
And he walks out and fires the gun happy with the things he won
The head of God on the wall ahead of us the heads of us
