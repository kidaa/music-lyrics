We see you laugh
We see you dance
We take that away
Every day

We see you cry
We turn your head
Then we slap your face

We see you try
We see you fail
Some things never changeWe hear you cry
We hear you wail
We steal that smile from your face

Bow down to live
Your life
Head down, hide that smile
Head high got to smile

Head high like a song you like
