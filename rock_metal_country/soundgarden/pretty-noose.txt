I caught the moon today
Pick it up
And throw it away all right
I got the perfect steal
A cleaner love
With a dirty feel all right
Fallout and take the bait
Eat the fruit
And kiss the snake goodnight


Common ruse dirty face
Pretty noose is pretty hate
And I dont like
What you got me hanging from
Let your motor race
Pick it up
And get this mother gone
Out from and far away
The wooden snake
This thing has got me on


Diamond rope silver chain
Pretty noose is a pretty pain
And I dont like
What you got me hanging from


I dont care what you got
I dont care what you need
I dont want anything
And I dont like what
You got me hanging from
