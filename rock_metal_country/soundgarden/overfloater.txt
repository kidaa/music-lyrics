Come on in and take me on an override
Been stuck inside andup all night at Dave's
Now trouble's far away, and mother in her cage
And nothing's gonna pinch this nerve of mine

I wanna make it right

Close the door and pull the shades
And climb the walls
Feel medicine heal the lines of age
I'm here nd now I'm gone
I'm there and far beyond
And nothing's gonna pinch this nerve of mine
Nothing gonna pinch this nerve of mine

I wanna make it rightI'm on the wire over and higher
Over the pretence over the spire why
On and connected I'm overfloating now
I'm overfloating alone

Hold the potion up
Tear your shadow down
Remember to forget and then rename the shame

I wanna make it right

I'm on the wire over and higher
Over the pretence over the spire why
On and connected I'm overfloating now
I'm overfloating alone
