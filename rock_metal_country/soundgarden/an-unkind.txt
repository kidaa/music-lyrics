We see the vipers of distance
Crawl into our lives everyday
Breeding our Edens of hatred
Pathetically stupid and unkind
We couldn't look a saint in the eyes

On the storm
It's time to go
On the storm
It's time to go

Marching in ines of contradiction
Forgetting the history we make
Loving our hangmen as the penultimate joke
We lack the Moses... to look
A saint in the eye
