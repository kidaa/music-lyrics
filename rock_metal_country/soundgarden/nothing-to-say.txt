Lyrics by Chris Cornell
Music by Kim Thayil 

Someone says my words are out of balance
Nothing to say
Dying words I bury everyday
Nothing to say


Youve got nothing to say, nothing to say
Bog bad words spell it with four letters
Nothing to say
Oh my God, your words are out of balance
Nothing to say


Nothing but one thing
Youve got nothing, nothing to say
