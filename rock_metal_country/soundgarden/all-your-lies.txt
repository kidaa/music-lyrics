All your fears are lies
All your fears are lies
All your fears are lies

All your fears are lies

See through your
Tripless, falling, limping, crawling,
Biting, fighting, back from dying
Endless ending, comprehending
Nothing of the sin she's sinning

Loosely buying your cheating, your lying
Will make it mine
While never crying
Corralled like a cat
With my head in a sack
And I feel like I'm tied to a railroad track
