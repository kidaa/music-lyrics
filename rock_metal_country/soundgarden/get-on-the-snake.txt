Lyrics by Chris Cornell
Music by Kim Thayil 

Get on the snake
With a swarm of motor flys
Get on the snake
Under the cola colored sky


Dont worry, everythings clean
Road worthy, hungry and mean
Get on the snake
Where the metal river bleeds
Get on the snake
Where you never will believe
Hey baby, whats your disease
My hearts bleeding 
Im dying to leave


Get on the snake
Where the water turns to steam
Get on the snake 
With a suicide machine


Dont worry, everythings clean
Road worthy, hungry and mean
Hungry and mean...
Hungry and mean...
