Lyrics by Chris Cornell
Music by Kim Thayil 


They saw you yesterday as you were leaving
Now they run to hunt you down
Dogs lead the chase as you are bleeding
They run to hunt you down


Your narrow escape has wiped the smile from your face
Starved dogs howling, run to hunt you down


You smile as you look in the mirror
Tears have left your eyes
Your face has a different Exterior
Permanent disguise


Your narrow escape has wiped the smile right from your face
Starved dogs howling, run to hunt you down
