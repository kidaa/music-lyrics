Kickstand, you got loose and I threw up
Kickstand, you got the juice to fill my cup
My mother says that it's alright
My mother says that's the only life

So do it right
Do it right
Come stand me up
Come stand me up

Kickstand, I got a saddle made of leather
Kickstand, I got the words to come together
I got the urge to ride your trike
My mother says that's the only life
