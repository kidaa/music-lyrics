The hand of God lays high above me
Ill be good if you really love me
Let me feel your mighty crunch
As you rub me out like water, fire, coal, etc


Let it be known today, if youve got two hands
Youre supposed to pray
Fingers of fire, coal and lead
Fondly love me till Im dead
The hand of God is thick and callous
Bruised and torn from stones and sticks
The hand of God has got a ring about the size of Texas
Made of steel and rust, my fingers smear


Let me try on your hand, and see if it fits
Dont worry I wont touch anything unholy with it
