I can't live when it lives
It won't live if I die
Machine has no heart to give
Heart it takes could be mine

Come on
Come down
Come out from where you hide

Follows me down the river
Shadows me through the sky
A sideways glance in the mirror
Stalemate machine in tie

Come on
Come down
Come out from where you hide
Get up
Get off
Get on with your lifeForever means all is not seen
Always I and I survive
Mercurial mind the fire
Ferrivorous directions and drive

Come on
Come down
Come out from where you hide
Get up
Get off
Get on with your life

Presently, I see myself clearer
Why time I visualize
I spy device in the mirror
Checkmate watch machine die
