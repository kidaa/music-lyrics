I want to be
A cowboy star upon the screen
Oh hey I want to drive
My cowboy car across the scene
Oh hey I want to write
The magazines the housewives read
And I want to be
In control of everything
I want to be KingI want to make the toys
You buy for Christmas Eve
Yeah and I want o be
The father of the ethnic child
Who stars on T.V.
Oh yeah and I, I want to write
The magazines the housewives read
Oh hey and I want all the leaders
Of the Thirld World
To answer to me
I want to be King
I want to be King
So maybe now the Pope
Will bow and kiss my ring
I wanna be King
