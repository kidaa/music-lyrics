I had a dog he was a mix
He loved me like God
But I was just a kid
The kind mother likes
Now I'm big like the sky
And I'm down sized inside
I'll put this all to rest
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy
I'm getting all depressed
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy

I got my father's sense
And my big brother's pants
And I look like a man
And I feel like an ant
Just speck on the ground
Growing like a weed
A fleck of a seedI'll put my hands in flames
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy
Feels like I'm born again
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy

And I'll keep hanging from your hair
And I'll keep playing the sand
Just as long as I can
