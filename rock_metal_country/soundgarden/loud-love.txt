Theres no time to keep it low
Ive been deaf now I want noise
You stay down
But I wont be quiet
Ill hammer on until you fight


Loud Love
Loud Love
Loud Love
Loud Love
If youve got some time to kill
Slow resistance wins the war
Well I know
But thats no way to go
You cant resist the louder pull


Well thats right
I want something to explode
Ive been deaf
Now I want noise
