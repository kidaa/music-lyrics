She don't like to stay out late
She'd rather be at home
Holdin' hands by the fireplace
I wonder if he knows
She likes moonlit walks on a seashore sand
Pickin' up shells with her toes
It's the silly things that make her laugh
I wonder if he knows
I wonder if he knows
Just where her heart has been
I wonder if it shows
She won't let it be broken again
It took a long time to mend
I wonder if he knows
She believes in a wedding band
And that the truth be told
She's gonna need a one-woman man
I wonder if he knows
She can't trust a man who tells a lie
That's farther than she will go
She'll find the strength to say goodbye
Oh, I wonder if he knows
I wonder if he knows
Just where her heart has been
I wonder if it shows
She won't let it be broken again
It took a long time to mend
I wonder if he knows
Oh, I wonder if he knows
