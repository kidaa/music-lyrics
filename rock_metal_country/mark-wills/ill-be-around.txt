Saw your picture in the morning paper
Bet your mama sure is proud
You finally found you a real straight lacer
All your dreams are finally gettin' buttoned down
Girl, you know that I know you too well
Before you cut the cake, before you ring that bell
I'll be around, around about the time
You're wishin' for a Friday evening with the ragtop down
I'll be around, around like a second hand tickin'
In the nick of time, let me make you mine
When you long to feel the wind in your hair
When your choices seem a little too square
I'll be around
I'll be around
Girl, you never did like vanilla
You were more of the rocky road kind
You hated princes and cinderellas
Gravitated more to Bonnies and Clydes
Girl, I wish you happiness
But if you ever find that the show don't fit
I'll be around, around about the time
You're wishin' for a Friday evening with the ragtop down
I'll be around, around like a second hand tickin'
In the nick of time, let me make you mine
When you long to feel the wind in your hair
When your choices seem a little too square
I'll be around
I'll be around
Girl, you know that I know you too well
Before you cut the cake, before you ring that bell
I'll be around, around about the time
You're wishin' for a Friday evening with the ragtop down
I'll be around, around like a second hand tickin'
In the nick of time, let me make you mine
When you long to feel the wind in your hair
When your choices seem a little too square
I'll be around
I'll be around
Girl, I'll be around
