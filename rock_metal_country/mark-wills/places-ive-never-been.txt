I've never the sun set at Montigo Bay
But my heart melts when you look at me that way
And I've never seen the snow fall
From a rocky mountain sky
But I get a chill just by lookin' in your eyes
'Cause you take me places I've never been
I travel the world in your arms and back again
I have no need to wander or go chasing those four winds
'Cause you take me places I've never been
I may never see the wonders on this earth
I may never hold treasures of great worth
I could search the whole world over
But I don't have to go that far
I've got it all right here in my arms
'Cause you take me places that I've never been
I travel the world in your arms and back again
I have no need to wander or go chasing those four winds
'Cause you take me places I've never been
'Cause you take me places I've never been
