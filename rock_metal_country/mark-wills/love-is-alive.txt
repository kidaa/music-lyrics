Steam on the window, the moon is bright
We're just two people holding on tight
This night is young and this feeling is strong
The smile on your face said it all
Love is alive and well tonight
Taking control like a raging fire
Burning its way from your heart to mine
Love is alive
This world is empty and cold at times
But here in your arms I am warm inside
Beyond any feeling I've felt or believed
Bring on tomorow, I can face anything
Love is alive and well tonight
Taking control like a raging fire
Burning its way from your heart to mine
Love is alive
Passion and kisses, and fevered desires
Constantly needing this feeling of ours
Love is alive and well tonight
Taking control like a raging fire
Burning its way from your heart to mine
Love is alive
Out of control like a raging fire
Burning its way from your heart to mine
Love is alive
Oh love is alive
