What am I doin' here starin' at you through these empty eyes
When I disappear, how did I lose this piece of time
I remember your lips pressed against mine
All of the sudden I was lost...
Lost in a kiss
I could feel my mind drift
Off the edge of forever
My heart slips away
To a beautiful place
That I can't resist
Oh, I was lost in a kiss
Whatever you've done to me, is nothin' like I've ever felt before
Right now I can barely breathe
You're everything I'm livin' for
Did you just say something, baby I'm sorry
There for a moment I was lost...
Lost in a kiss
I could feel my mind drift
Off the edge of forever
My heart slips away
To a beautiful place
That I can't resist
Oh, I was lost in a kiss
There's so many places yet to discover
Open your arms and let's get lost...
Lost in a kiss
I could feel my mind drift
Off the edge of forever
My heart slips away
To a beautiful place
That I can't resist
Oh, I was lost in a kiss
I wanna get lost in your kiss
