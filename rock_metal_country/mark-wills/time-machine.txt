Tim Mensy/Monty Criswell/Tony Martin
If I could invent a time machine
I'd go back and change a few things
I'd be there that cold and rainy night
To make sure Patsy Cline didn't fly
And I would divert a Dallas parade
And for a little longer we'd have JFK
And on my way back from the past to the now
I would swing by and stop off at our house
And I wouldn't say what I said on the day you left me
What a better place this world would be
If I had a time machine
Don't know the danger or the consequence
I might create if I altered events
But take a look at this ol' world we've got
You'd have to admit it'd be worth a shot
One stop in New York and Lennon still dreams
Two stops in Memphis and long live two kings
And on my way back from the past to the now
I would swing by and stop off at our house
And I wouldn't say what I said on the day you left me
What a better place this world would be
If I had a time machine
What a better place this world would be
If I had a time machine
A time machine
