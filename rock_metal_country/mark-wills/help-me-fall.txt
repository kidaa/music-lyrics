Skip Ewing/Donny Kees
I've been trying not to love you
I've been putting up a fight
I've been barely holding on
And letting go with all my might
There's a part of me that's empty
I know only love can fill
I'm afraid I'll never find it
And I'm scared to death I will
Help me fall
Help me fall
If you care for me at all
Help me fall
Help me fall
I've been holding conversations
When I haven't said a word
I've been speaking with my silence
And praying that you heard
I'm a walking contradiction
I'd hate to be my heart
It keeps trying not to love you
But it don't know where to start
Help me fall
Help me fall
If you care for me at all
Help me fall
Help me fall
I've got to learn to re-trust
To turn me into us
And I really don't know if I can again
Help me fall
Help me fall
If you care for me at all
Help me fall
Help me fall
I've been trying not to love you
I've been putting up a fight
I've been barely holding on
Letting go with all my might
