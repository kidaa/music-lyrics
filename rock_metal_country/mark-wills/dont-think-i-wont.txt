If you need someone who will promise you blue skies
If you think old-fashioned love's out of style
You've probably got the wrong guy
But if you need someone to walk through the fire for you
I'm just the man to do it, don't think I won't
I mean what I say and I say what I feel
I'll love you 'til my name is carved in stone
Baby don't think I won't, 'cause I will
Your heart's been left to hurt by lovers runnin' scared
But whenever you reach out for me, I'm gonna be there
And if you need someone to spend his life lovin' you
I'm just the man to do it, don't think I won't
I mean what I say and I say what I feel
I'll love you 'til my name is carved in stone
Baby don't think I won't, 'cause I will
I'll love you 'til my name is carved in stone
Baby don't think I won't
Baby don't think I won't, 'cause I will
