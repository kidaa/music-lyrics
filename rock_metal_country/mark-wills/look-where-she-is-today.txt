Ed Hill/Billy Spencer
She could have had anything she wanted
The world lay at her feet
'Cause the oldest son of a well-to-do banker
Offered her easy street
Pearls and diamonds and french perfumes
To take her breath away
Well, she got everything she wanted
Just look where she is today
She's riding in my old car
Sitting right next to me
Inner tubes piled on the top
Headed out to Crooked Creek
Gonna float throgh the afternoon
Hold hands and drift away
Anybody can see she loves me
Look where she is today
She could have had a heart shaped pool
And a yard like a puttin' green
But she likes to feel her toes in the mud
Wearin' her cut-off jeans
She says right beside me
Is where she wants to stay
If you want a good look at a love that's true
Just look where she is today
She's riding in my old car
Sitting right next to me
Inner tubes piled on the top
Headed out to Crooked Creek
Gonna float throgh the afternoon
Hold hands and drift away
Anybody can see she loves me
Just look where she is today
Alright
Gonna float through the afternoon
Hold hands and drift away
Anybody can see she loves me
Just look where she is today
Anybody can see she loves me
Just look where she is today
