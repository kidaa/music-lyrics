Mark Nesler/Tony Martin
Wouldn't wanna go calling this love
That word isn't close enough
To describe what we've got here
My heart is still in one piece
I can eat and I can sleep
I haven't cried one single tear
I never lost my freedom
And I'm too secure to be afraid
This can't be love you're giving me
It feels too good, comes so easy
It's gettin' stronger every day
Like it's never gonna fade away
This can't be love I feel for you
It's nothing like what I've been through
It's gotta be something new
This just can't be love
Every love I knew up until now
Picked me up just to let me down
I've been every shade of blue
I never quite felt sure inside
A little nervous and a little tongue tied
But I can always talk to you
Look at us we're still together
Love's never taken me this far
This can't be love you're giving me
It feels too good, comes so easy
It's gettin' stronger every day
Like it's never gonna fade away
This can't be love I feel for you
It's nothing like what I've been through
It's gotta be something new
This just can't be love
