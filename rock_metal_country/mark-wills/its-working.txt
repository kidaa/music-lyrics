Bob Regan/Max T. Barnes
She don't know how to work on her car
She just steps on the gas and it goes
Me, I'm no technician but a little knob twisting
Puts a song on my radio
And when it comes to love, we're a lot alike, she and I
We don't really know what we're doin'
But we're doin' something right
'Cause it's working
Working like a charm
Working like a dream
Humming like a big well-oiled machine
Chugging right along
Steady and strong and certain
So far, so good, baby knock on wood
It's working
Some folks tear a good love apart
Just to see what makes it tick
And sometimes when they put it back again
The pieces don't want to fit
That don't mean I don't ask every day
Honey, how we doin'
'Cause I love to hear her say
It's working
Working like a charm
Working like a dream
Humming like a big well-oiled machine
Chugging right along
Steady and strong and certain
So far, so good, baby knock on wood
It's working
Chugging right along
Steady and strong and certain
So far, so good, baby knock on wood
It's working like a charm
Working like a dream
Humming like a big well-oiled machine
Chugging right along
Steady and strong and certain
So far, so good, baby knock on wood
It's working
Working like a charm
Working like a dream
Humming like a big well-oiled machine
Chugging right along
Steady and strong and certain
So far, so good, baby knock on wood
It's working like a charm
Working like a dream
Humming like a big well-oiled machine
Chugging right along
Steady and strong and certain
So far, so good, baby knock on wood
It's working
