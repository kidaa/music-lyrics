Love's a gamble every heart will take
You roll the dice in hopes that it won't break
One night I bet on your blue eyes and took a chance
And I won a whole lot more than one night of romance
I held the ace of hearts, that night in the dark
How lucky can one man be
And I hold the winning hand anyway life deals the cards
No way to lose, 'cause, I've got you my ace of hearts
Love's a numbered wheel you have to spin
There's no need for me to spin again
Because lovin' you is paying off more than I knew
I took a little risk, Lord, and hit it big with you
I held the ace of hearts, that night in the dark
How lucky can one man be
And I hold the winning hand anyway life deals the cards
No way to lose, 'cause, I've got you my ace of hearts
I held the ace of hearts, that night in the dark
How lucky can one man be
And I hold the winning hand anyway life deals the cards
No way to lose, 'cause, I've got you my ace of hearts
Oh, now I've got you, my ace of hearts
