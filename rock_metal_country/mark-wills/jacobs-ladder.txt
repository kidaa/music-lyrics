Jacob was a dirt poor farm boy
Raised at the fork in the road in a clapboard house
And Rachael was a land baron's daughter
Born with a silver spoon in her mouth
Her daddy said he wouldn't stand
For Rachael to waste her life with a common man
He tried hard to keep them apart
But you can't draw lines in a young girl's heart
So late one night by the harvest moon
Jacob climed a ladder up to Rachael's room
He knew his place, it was right beside her
Step by step up to her world
Head over heels for a brown-eyed girl
And gettin' caught didn't seem to matter
'Cause heaven was waitin' at the top of Jacob's ladder
It'll be five years September
Since her daddy found a ladder and a note on her windowsill
He swore he'd never forgive them
But nothin' melts a heart like a grandchild will
Now she climbs up on his knee
Says, ";Grandpa, tell a story, the one about me";
He thinks back and his eyes shine
Says, ";Listen Child, once upon a time";
Late one night by the harvest moon
Your daddy climbed a ladder to your mama's room
He knew his place, it was right besde her
Step by step up to her world
Head over heels for my little girl
And here you are, that's all that matters
'Cause heaven was watin' at the top of Jacob's ladder
Oh, an angel was waitin' at the top of Jacob's ladder
