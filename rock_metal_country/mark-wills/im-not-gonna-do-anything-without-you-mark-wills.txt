I'm gonna make you a promise
Starting tonight
If I never do anything else
For the rest of my life
I'm gonna hold somebody
I'm gonna look in someone's eyes
'Til I'm so overcome that I cry
I'm gonna love somebody
More than anybody
Baby, there's so much I wanna do
But I'm not gonna do anything without you
There's no way I'll ever give up
There's no way I'll lose
If I have to sacrifice everything
Then that's what I'll do
I'm gonna hold somebody
I'm gonna look in someone's eyes
'Til I'm so oversome that I cry
I'm gonna love somebody
More than anybody
Baby, there's so much I wanna do
But I'm not gonna do anything without you
This is my dream I live and breathe
All I think about
This is the fire that burns in me
That will never go out
I'm gonna hold somebody
I'm gonna look in someone's eyes
'Til I'm so oversome that I cry
I'm gonna love somebody
More than anybody
Baby, there's so much I wanna do
But I'm not gonna do anything without you
Baby, there's so much I wanna do
But I'm not gonna do anything without you
I'm not gonna do anything without you
Anything without you
