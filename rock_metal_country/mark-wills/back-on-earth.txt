Well I hit the charts and I took a trip
On this silver eagle rocket ship
Hey now look at me I'm hanging with the stars
And I've tried my hardest not to change
But everyone around keeps acting strange
People look at me like I'm a man from Mars
That's what I told her through the sound check noise in Kansas
And the satellite relayed me this reply
Back on Earth
There's a woman who's wishing
An ordinary man was sitting in the kitchen
Drinking her coffee after loving her all night long
Back on Earth
There's a brown-eyed baby
Who's old enough now to tell me all the ways
She's needing her daddy
And wondering when he's coming home
Now I'm out in space here wondering if it's worth
Everything I'm missing
Back on Earth
But I played the show and the crowd went wild
Shared my heart and the good Lord smiled
And I thanked them all for being kind to me
In the morning there's another town
With a hotel room where we touch down
Where I'll face the situation's gravity
As I navigate the Milky Way I contemplate the dues I pay
Could there be another way, God, I love to sing and play
Back on Earth
There's a woman who's wishing
An ordinary man was sitting in the kitchen
Drinking her coffee after loving her all night long
Back on Earth
There's a brown-eyed baby
Who's old enough now to tell me all the ways
She's needing her daddy
And wondering when he's coming home
Now I'm out in space here wondering if it's worth
Everything I'm missing
Back on Earth
I'm up in space here wondering if it's worth
Everything I'm missing
Back on Earth
