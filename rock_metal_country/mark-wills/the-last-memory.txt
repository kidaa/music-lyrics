Tony Martin/Sunny Russ
I remember we were drivin'
I remember what she wore
I remember we were fightin'
Though I can't recall what for
I remember where we were goin'
And I remember I made her cry
I don't know what was so important
That I had to be so right
That's the last memory
That I have of her
Out of so many
That's the one that hurts
Ain't it funny the things that you remember
And the things you don't
'Cause that's the last memory in the world
I'd ever want
I don't know how long I ignored her
While she stared out of her window
But I know which song that they were playin'
When I turned on the radio
We never got where we were goin'
'Cause she told me to take her home
I just sat out in the car
And watched her walk inside alone
That's the last memory
That I have of her
Out of so many
That's the one that hurts
Ain't it funny the things that you remember
And the things you don't
'Cause that's the last memory in the world
I'd ever want
Ain't it funny the things that you remember
And the things that you don't
That's the last memory in the world
I'd ever want
That's the last memory in the world
That'd I'd ever want
