Pat Bunch/Doug Johnson
I got a ";Dear John"; letter in the mail just the other day
I opened it up and there wasn't much left to say
A bus ticket, plane ticket, train ticket
There's about a hundred ways to leave
It ain't her goodbye, it's her gone that's killin' me
'Cause I'm here to tell you
If I learned one thing about love
It ain't the fall that gets you
It's the sudden stop that does
Well I wasn't gonna take this broken heart laying down
So I jumped up, cranked up and headed for the lights of town
In a bright red drop dead tight dress she said, ";Honey come on in";
And head over high heels, here I go again
'Cause I'm here to tell you
If I learned one thing about love
It ain't the fall that gets you
It's the sudden stop that does
Red light green light seat belt real tight
I'm headed straight for the wall
Goin' ninety miles an hour well I'm gonna risk it all
'Cause I'm here to tell you
If I learned one thing about love
It ain't the fall that gets you
It's the sudden stop 
It ain't the fall at all
It's that sudden stop
It ain't the fall that gets you
It's the sudden stop that does
