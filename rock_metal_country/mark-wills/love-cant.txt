Drip, drop, down it came from the
Roof top, morning rain, hope it
Don't stop, it's been a long dry spell, well, I'm
Pretty sure it's a sign we need to
Call work and tell a white lie, sayin'
Head hurts, you're not feeling too well
C'mon baby, let the world carry on without you
Right this minute ain't nobody who needs you more than I do
Hey, we need a little fixing
There ain't nothin' love can't
So what do you say
We pull the covers over
Get a little closer and
Do some catchin' up
A little you know what
It's all about us today
The world can wait
But love can't
Don't you miss having the time for a
Long kiss, you know, the kind where your
Heart skips and leads to other things, why don't I
Lock up, you get the shades, never mind
I don't want to waste
One touch, I'm where I want to be
With you next to me
Hey, we need a little fixing
There ain't nothin' love can't
So what do you say
We pull the covers over
Get a little closer and
Do some catchin' up
A little you know what
It's all about us today
The world can wait
But love can't
Hey, we need a little fixing
There ain't nothin' love can't
So what do you say
We pull the covers over
Get a little closer and
Do some catchin' up
A little you know what
It's all about us today
The world can wait
But love can't
