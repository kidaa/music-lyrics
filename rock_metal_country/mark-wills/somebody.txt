Sam Tate/Annie Tate/Dave Berg
At a diner down on Broadway they make small talk
When she brings his eggs and fills his cup
He jokes about his love life
Tells her he's 'bout ready to give up
That's when she says
I've been there before
Keep on looking 'cause
Maybe who you're looking for is...
Somebody in the next car
Somebody on the morning train
Somebody in the coffee shop
That you walk right by everyday
Somebody that you look at but never really see
Somewhere out there
There's somebody
Across town in a crowded elevator
He can't forget the things that waitress said
He usually reads the paper
But today he reads a strangers face instead
It's that blue-eyed girl
>From two floors up
Maybe she's the one
Maybe he could fall in love with
Somebody in the next car
Somebody on the morning train
Somebody in the coffee shop
That you walk right by everyday
Somebody that you look at but never really see
Somewhere out there
There's somebody
Now they laugh about the moment that it happened
A moment they both missed until that day
When he saw his guture in her eyes
Instead of just another friendly face
And he wonders why
He searched so long
When she was always there
At that diner waiting on
Somebody in the next car
Somebody on the morning train
Somebody in the coffee shop
That you walk right by everyday
Somebody that you look at but never really see
Somewhere out there
There's somebody
Yeah, somewhere out there is somebody
