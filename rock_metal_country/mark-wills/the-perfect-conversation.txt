In the perfect conversation we're standing at the station
And you're begging me, ";please don't go";
You say, ";the only thing that matters in this world
is that we need each other so";
In theperfect conversation without any hesitation
I tell you, I was wrong
I say, ";girl, you know sometimes my faith is weak
and my pride is much too strong";
In this perfect conversation here in my imagination
Somehow I know just when to say what's right
And I know just what I'm losing
Before this train I'm on starts moving
And I'm running though the door to hold you tight
The perfect conversation always ends
Before we say goodbye
All that I can hear now, so loud and so clear now
Are the words I could not seem to find
Everything I didn't say keeps coming back
One mile at a time
In this perfect conversation here in my imagination
Somehow I know just when to say what's right
And I know I'll never leave you
'Cause I know how much I need you
And I tell you that I love you just in time
The perfect conversation always ends
Before we say goodbye
The perfect conversation always ends 
Before we say goodbye
