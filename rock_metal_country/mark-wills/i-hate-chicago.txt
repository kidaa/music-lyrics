Tuesday morning sports page, I've got coffee in my cup
A smile creeps across my face, the Braves beat the Cubs
I hate Chicago
I'm changing planes in Dallas, I ain't going through I'Hare
It's a thousand dollars more I know, but I don't care
I hate Chicago
Sara told me that she only
Needed space to think things out
Then she met some guy named Tony
Guess where they live now
I hear the food is great, I hear the summer sure is nice
It's beautiful at Christmas, there's three more reasons why
I hate Chicago
From their WGN station to their seven feet of snow
The rock band in the 80's to the Oprah Winfrey Show
I hate Chicago
Sara told me that she only
Needed space to think things out
Then she met some guy named Tony
Guess where they live now
Sara used to talk about
How one day we would settle down
Find ourselves an old farmhouse
On the outskirts of a small town
Then she told me that she only
Needed space to think things out
Then she met some guy named Tony
Guess where they live now
That's right I hate Chicago
I hate Chicago
Man, I hate Chicago
