Karen Taylor-Good/Roberta Schiller
He starts your fire then he cools down
He comes by when he wants you then he stops coming round
You say his love's like nothing else, you never felt so much
What you're feeling might be something else
But it don't look like love
'Cause love don't lie
And love don't cheat
Love don't promise what it can't keep
And love ain't someone you always miss
Oh won't you let me hold you
And I will show what love is
I'll build a fire you can't put out
I'll take you higher than you've ever dreamed about
I know it's hard to let him go but is he worth the pain
'Cause even though you say he cares
Love don't look that way
'Cause love don't lie
And love don't cheat
Love don't promise what it can't keep
And love ain't someone you always miss
Oh won't you let me hold you and I will show you that
Love don't lie
And love don't cheat
Love don't promise what it can't keep
And love ain't someone you always miss
Oh won't you let me hold you
And I will show what love is
And I will show you what love is
