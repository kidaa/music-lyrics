He said goodbye - you watched him turn and walk away
Before your eyes - there went the plans you made
His memory rolls down your cheek
In the shadows all alone
Girl take my hand, take one more chance
Let me turn the light back on'cause
Nothing makes you forget about love like love
Makes you forget about, the one who let you down
It's over now, you've cried enough
Give me a little time
And in my arms you'll find
Nothing makes you forget about love like love
A human heart - sometimes can only take so much
Girl let me start - to pick the pieces up
Let's strike a match to the past
And we'll dance inside the flame
Once you feel a love this real
You won't recall his name 'Cause
Nothing makes you forget about love like love
Makes you forget about, the one who let you down
It's over now, you've cried enough
Give me a little time
And in my arms you'll find
Nothing makes you forget about love like love
I know it's hard to reach for someone else
But please close your eyes and trust your heart
And let love do the rest
Nothing makes you forget about love like love
Makes you forget about, the one who let you down
It's over now, you've cried enough
Give me a little time
And in my arms you'll find
Nothing makes you forget about love like love
Nothing makes you forget about love like love
