Because I love you
That's the reason why
'Cause I love you
I'll reach up to the sky
Pull down a fairytale, a wishing well, a magic spell
And give them all to you
Because I love you
All I ever think about is
When I can touch you
'Cause I can't live without 
Your little sweet surprise, your hazel eyes, I'm hypnotized
And there's nothing I can do
Because I love you
I'll always be honestly, willingly, faithful and true
Because I love you
I'm hopelessly, endlessly
Yours, heart and soulfully
And I devotedly
Do it, 'cause I do it, 'cause I do it, 'cause I
Do it, 'cause I love you
Because I need you
Say you'll never go away
Because I want you
Every night and every day
Your little mystery, keeps kissing me, I'm history
And there's nothing I can do
Because I love you
I'll always be honestly, willingly, faithful and true
Because I love you
I'm hopelessly, endlessly
Yours, heart and soulfully
And I devotedly
Do it, 'cause I do it, 'cause I do it, 'cause I
Do it, 'cause I love you
Because I love you
I'll always be honestly, willingly, faithful and true
Because I love you
I'm hopelessly, endlessly
Yours, heart and soulfully
And I devotedly
Do it, 'cause I do it, 'cause I do it, 'cause I
Do it, 'cause I love you
Because I love you
