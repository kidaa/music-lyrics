D. Vincent Williams/Rory Lee
A man is measured these days
By the money he's got
Not sure when it started happening
But that's not the way it's supposed to be I thought
Or maybe I'm a bit old fashioned
'Cause I just wanna
Live my life, raise my kids
Love my wife like my dad did
I may never be a millionaire
But I've got more than enough
I'm a rich man, rich in love
Yeah, a little more money
Lord wouldn't it be sweet
Heaven knows that it could change things
But there's food on out table
And shoes on our feet
So I don't waste my time complaining
I'm just gonna
Live my life, raise my kids
Love my wife like my dad did
I may never be a millionaire
But I've got more than enough
I'm a rich man, rich in love
Live my life, raise my kids
Love my wife like my dad did
I may never be a millionaire
But I've got more than enough
I'm a rich man, rich in love
I'm a rich man, rich in love.
