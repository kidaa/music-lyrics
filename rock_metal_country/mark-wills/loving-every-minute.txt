I was never really breathing
My heart was never really beating
Till you held me in your arms
And every love that didn't last
Every second of my past
Simply disappeared into the dark
Chorus--
And with that first kiss
I felt my life beginning
And the clock just froze
And the world stopped spinning
Now the majic of that moment
is never ending
You made time stand still
And I'm loving every minute
Its a need that never changes.
A passion that is ageless.
It consumes me like it did,
when it was new.
You have led me to a place,
Where everyday's the same
And I'm always falling more
in love with you
Chorus--
And with that first kiss
I felt my life beginning
And the clock just froze
And the world stopped spinning
Now the majic of that moment
is never ending
You made time stand still
And I'm loving every minute
And with that first kiss
I felt my life beginning
And the clock just froze
And the world stopped spinning
Now the majic of that moment
is never ending
You made time stand still
And I'm loving every minute
Oh, oh, oh
And I'm loving every minute
Oh, oh, oh
Loving you baby
