My baby gets me shakin' - she's got a way of makin' me
Feel like I'm still seventeen
She gets me high-she gets me low-and in between
Blue eyes she's got 'em - legs on the bottom
She tippy-toed right out of a dream
She's got it high - she's got it low - and in bewteen
Now I'm higher than a flag on the 4th of July
Low down in love and she's the reason why
She gets a hold of me and takes complete control of me
If you know what I mean
My baby's got me - high-low - and in between
Now baby's got the kind of kiss - you could start a fire with she don't need no gasoline
I'm burnin' high - I'm burnin' low - and in between
I'll find 'er on the second floor 
And chase 'er through the cellar door 
And catch 'er by the washin' machine 
She takes me high - she takes me low - and in between
Now I'm higher than a flag on the 4th of July
Low down in love and she's the reason why
She gets a hold of me and takes complete control of me
If you know what I mean
My baby's got me - high-low - and in between
Now I'm higher than a flag on the 4th of July
Low down in love and she's the reason why
She gets a hold of me and takes complete control of me
If you know what I mean
My baby's got me - high-low - and in between
My baby's got me - high-low - and in between
Well, she's got it high - she's got me low - and in between
