I'm almost new again
I've got this aching heart to feed
Do you ever think of me and smile
Do you get scared anymore when you turn out the lights
How can you sleep so tight without me to say goodnight
I've lost my heart again
I'll miss those brown eyes seeing me
There's nothing more to say from this end - I'll miss you
Do you get scared anymore when you turn out the lights
How do you sleep so tight
With love
Yours truly
