I can't believe it's true.
I can't believe that you
Don't want me anymore.
You're with him,
And you don't even know
That I've been dying all day long
And singing sad, sad songs
And wishing you were gone. 

Is this love
Is this love
Is this love
Or should I close the door 

My eyes are burning in my head
And seeing only red
And wishing you were dead. 

Is this love
Is this love
Is this love
Is this love
Is this love
Or should I,
Or should I, should I,
Should I close the door
Should I close the door Ah, I fooled myself. 

Is this love
Is this love
Is this love
Is this love
Is this love
Or should I,
Or should I,
Or should I, should I,
Should I close the door
