Goodbye, so what, take care now
I hope she takes good care of you
You know I'd wait for you forever
But I've got things to do
I won't step back while you make up your mind
I'll be far gone - enjoy your waste of time
You came back just to check in and see
If you could still fuck me up - you're dead to me
You said just wait and you'd be back for more
Should I be proud that I'm your favorite whore
Ooh, don't go, ooh, don't go, don't go
In another place and time
You will be mine
We'll be so happy
In New York City

Ooh, don't go, ooh, don't go, don't go
In another place and time
You were mine
We were so happy
