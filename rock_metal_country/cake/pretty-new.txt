She can't see in the moonlight
Do you wanna go to Mars wanna go to the Moon
Still she'll drive far to see me
Do you wanna see the stars wanna see them at noon
Risk her life just to breathe me
Do you wanna go to Mars wanna go to the Moon
She'll be strong till the end
Do you wanna see the stars wanna see them at noon
Is this the end?
Who's my mama now, who's my mama now
Not now mother
Who's my mama now I said whoooo
Not now, lord not now
Who's my mama now, who's my mama now
Hold tight father
Who's my mama now I said whoooo
Grab on please stay strong
Head up brother
She's not quite yet gone
She can't do what she used to
Do you wanna go to Mars wanna go to the Moon
Hold my hand cause she wants to
Do you wanna see the stars wanna see them at noon
She can't say what we all know
Do you wanna go to Mars wanna go to the Moon
She'll be strong if you need me
Do you wanna see the stars wanna see them at noon
Do you need me?
Who's my mama now, who's my mama now
Not now mother
Who's my mama now I said whoooo
Not now, lord not now
Who's my mama now, who's my mama now
Hold tight father
Who's my mama now I said whoooo
Grab on please stay strong
Oooaahh
Oooaahh
It's a long road
Tell you right now it's a long road
It's a long road
Sleep tight mother
It's been a long night
