She doesn't care
Whether or not he's an island.
She doesn't care,
Just as long as his ship's coming in.
She doesn't care
Whether or not he's an island.
If they laugh, they make money.
He's got a gold watch.
She's got a silk dress
And healthy breasts
That bounce on his Italian leather sofa. 
She doesn't care
Whether or not he's a good man.
She doesn't care,
Just as long as she still has her friends.
She doesn't care
Whether or not he's an island.
If they laugh, they make money.
He's got a gold watch.
She's got a silk dress
And healthy breasts
That bounce on his Italian leather sofa. 

She's got a serrated edge
That she moves back and forth.
It's such a simple machine.
She doesn't have to use force.
When she gets what she wants
She puts the rest on a tray
In a zip-loc bag. 

She's got a serrated edge
That she moves back and forth.
It's such a simple machine.
She doesn't have to use force.
When she get what she wants
She puts the rest on a tray
In a zip-loc bag in the freezer. 

She doesn't care
Whether or not he's an island.
She doesn't care,
Just as long as his ship's coming in.
