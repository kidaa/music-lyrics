Too much carbon monoxide for me to bear
Too much carbon monoxide for me to bear
Where's the air?
Where's the air?
Where's the air?
After car after bus after car after truck
After this my lungs will be so fucked up
I wish I was in that Mercedes Benz 
Sealed away from my scents
I'd have the music high going 95
Too much too much too much too much
Too much carbon monoxide for me to bear
Too much carbon monoxide for me to bear
Don't you care?
Don't you care?
Don't you care?
After car after bus after car after truck
After this my lungs will be so fucked up
I wish I wasn't just a pedestrian
Breathing all this in
I look up at that grey sky
It makes me want to... ohhhh
Too much too much too much
Too much carbon monoxide for me to bear.
