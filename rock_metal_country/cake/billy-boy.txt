Oh
Oh
Oh paint me with leopard spots
Hey, why not, if that's your scene
That's cool with me
Oh Billy boy
Oh Billy boy
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy
It's just all about you
It's just all about...
Oh what a day, oh what a day
I think I saw you on TV
Yesterday
Oh what a day, oh what a day
I think I saw you on TV
Yesterday
I don't like the idea of you breaking down
and I'm the only one who can help you get back on the road again
Release me
Release me
Release me
Release me
Right on
Oh virtuous one
Right on
Oh virtuous one
Right on
Oh virtuous one
Right on
Oh virtuous one
Right on
How do you like that
How do you like that
Right on
How do you like that
How do you like that
Right on
