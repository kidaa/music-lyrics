You turn the screws, 
You tear down the bridge, 
Flimsy as it is, 
It's business like, 

You shake my hand, 
You break up the band, 
Flimsy as it is, 
It's open mike, 

Punk rock, 
Red white and blue, 

You twist the knife, 
Then go home to kiss your wife, 
A bigger better slice, 
Is what you like, 

You kick the sand, 
You get the upper hand, 
You sell it to Japan, 
It's natural, 

Punk rock, 
Red white and blue, 

You turn the screws, 
It's what you choose to do, 
You think that I, 
Must turn them too, 

You think that I, 
Must be so satisfied, 
I stay inside, 
I wonder why, 

And the cement, 
Makes or gets him, already, 
One good time at a time, 

They're pouring it slowly and steady, 
You're showing me where I can sign, 
What I can expect to find, 

But how can you say, 
You'll be happy, 
When you turn the screws, 

You turn the screws, 
Is what you choose to do, 
You turn the screws, 
Is what you choose to do, 

You think that I, 
Must turn them too, 

You turn the screws, 
Is what you choose to do, 
You turn the screws, 
Is what you choose to do, 

You turn the screws...
