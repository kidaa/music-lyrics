Sixteen miles to go, sixteen long miles to go
Gasping for air, picking at small blisters on my fingertips
Do you wanna go out for a ride
Dress me down, take me out, make me pray
I'll be good, just as sweet as candy
Dress me down
Sixteen miles to go, sixteen long miles to go
Gasping for air, picking at small blisters on my fingertips
Do you wanna know how far I've gone
In the end of it all I see you
In the end of it all I fear you
Will I be fine
Is it too late for sorry now
And am I too late
Am I dead
