It's undeniably lazy
What we do when you're not around
Hospitalize the crazies
Keep the maggots underground
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa-oh
It was a hell of a time, it was a hell of a time
So swell, so swell
It was a hell of a time, it was a hell of a time
So swell, so swell
It was a hell of a time, it was a hell of a time
So swell, so swell
It was a hell of a time, it was a hell of a time
So swell, so swell
It was a hell of a time, it was a hell of a time
So swell, so swell
It was a hell of a time, it was a hell of a time
So swell, so swell
It was a hell of a time, it was a hell of a time
So swell, so swell
It was a hell of a time, it was a hell of a time
So swell, so swell
It's undeniably lazy
What we do when you're not around
Hospitalize the crazies
Keep the maggots underground
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa-oh
