I had a match, 
But she had a lighter, 
I had a flame, 
But she had a fire, 

I was bright, 
But she was much brighter, 
I was high, 
But she was the sky, 

Oh, Baby, I was bound, 
For Mexico, 
Oh, Baby, I was bound, 
To let you go, 

I don't know much about, 
Cinco DeMayo, 
I'm never sure, 
What it's all about, 

But I said I want you, 
And you don't believe me, 
You said you want me, 
But I've got my doubts, 

Oh, Baby,I was bound, 
For Mexico, 
Oh, Baby, I was bound, 
To let you go, 

I had a match, 
But she had a lighter, 
I had a flame, 
But she had a fire, 

I was bright, 
But she was much brighter, 
I was high, 
But she was the sky, 

Oh, Baby, I was bound, 
For Mexico, 
Oh, Baby, I was bound, 
To let you go
