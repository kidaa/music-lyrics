I was the only one
That guy had a gun
Just my luck, I saw it all
I'm not sure but he looked tall
He strolled in, He took aim
Took a shot, Saw them bleed
I could see not that well
But that's how it seemed
Now he's gone, On the run
Don't waste time, Don't look back
You're home free, Was it fun
Was it worth all of that
Look at me I'm the lucky one
Look at me I'm the lucky one
Look at me I'm the lucky one
Look at me I'm the lucky one
He strolled in, He took aim
Took a shot, Saw them bleed
I could see not that well
But that's how it seemed
Now he's gone, On the run
Don't waste time, Don't look back
You're home free, Was it fun
Was it worth all of that
Drop dead
Shock me
Have sense to lock up
Drop dead
Shock me
Have sense to lock - Whoa, oh
I was the only one
Two shots, he dropped the gun
Just my luck, I saw it all
I'm not sure but he looked awful small
He strolled in, He took aim
Took a shot, Saw them bleed
I could see not that well
But that's how it seemed
Now he's gone, On the run
Don't waste time, Don't look back
You're home free, Was it fun
Was it worth all of that
Look at me I'm the lucky one
Look at me I'm the lucky one
