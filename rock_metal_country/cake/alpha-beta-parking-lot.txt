standing in the alpha beta parking lot 
watching the sun set 
I'll never forget 
watching all the reds and oranges slip away 
letting go of yet another dirty day 

breathing in the fumes from so many idling cars 
right beneath the sign w/ the dusty yellow stars 
watching the sun go down 

standing in the alpha beta parking lot 
watching you leave me 
not quite believing 

standing in the alpha beta parking lot 
watching the sun set 
I'll never forget 
breathing in the fumes from so many idling cars 
right beneath the sign w/ the dusty yellow stars 
watching the sun go down
