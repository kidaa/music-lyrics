You're getting sleepy
Very sleepy
Soon you're going to fall asleep...
Just rest relax the drip will drop fast
You lay down, for the first time
I am far away
You say things are not so fine
It's been an awful day
Are you okay?
I wish I could be there
Ten nine eight seven
Six five four three two
- And now you are with me
Always a lead heart - sad - heart
How do you feel
It hurts
On a good day?
It hurts
Is today a good day?
It hurts
