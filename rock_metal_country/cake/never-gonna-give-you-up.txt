Whatever, whatever, girl I'll do  
Forever and ever yeah yeah yeah yeah, I'll see you through  
Because I've got to keep you pleased in every way I can  
I'm gonna give you - all you, as much as you can stand  
I'll make love to you right now, that's all I want to do  
I know you need it girl, and you know I need it, too  

'Cause I've found what the world is searching for  
Here, right here, my dear  
I don't have to look no more  
And all my days, I hope and I pray  
For somemone just like you to make me feel the way you do  

Never never gonna give you up  
I'm never ever gonna stop  
Stop the way I feel about you  
Though I just can't live without you  
I'm never ever gonna quit  
'Cause quittin' just ain't my shit  
Gonna stay right here with you  
Gonna do all the things you want me to  

Whatever you want, girl you've got it  
And whatever you need, i don't want to see you without it  
That's right  
Because you've given me much more than words can ever say  
And oh my dear I'll be right here until my dying day  
I don't know just how to say all the things I feel  
I just know that I love you so when you give me such a thrill  

'Cause I've found what the world is searching for  
Here, right here, my dear  
I don't have to look no more  
And all my days, I hope and I pray  
For someone just like you to make me feel the way you do  

Never never gonna give you up  
I'm never ever gonna stop  
Stop the way I feel about you  
Though I just can't live without you  
I'm never ever gonna quit  
'Cause quittin' just ain't my shit  
Gonna stay right here with you  
Gonna do all the things you want me to  

Never never gonna give you up  
I'm never ever gonna stop  
Stop the way I feel about you  
Though I just can't live without you  
I'm never ever gonna quit  
'Cause quittin' just ain't my shit  
Gonna stay right here with you  
Gonna do all the things you want me to
