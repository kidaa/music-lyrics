Please don't take this day away
While I've just begun
I'll take a walk
Please be listening, I'm okay
If I dont come back
I'll take a walk
Someplace else is where I've gone
Sorry you can't come
Gone for a while
Hello, I'm from somewhere
That's all that's true
Out for a while
I don't miss home
Hello there - now tell me, is it nice to leave me too
