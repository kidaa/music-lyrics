Disempowered
The scattering flock
Dances in a fever
At the Castle Rock

Dust devils cypress
Ripening fruit 
Ascending quick 
Into the authors bathroom

Fon, Jo and Tootsie 
Are out on a wire
Mans tooth junkies 
All full of desire

Meanwhile Rick James takes her new

And there's nothing I can do

Meanwhile Rick James takes her new

And there's nothing I can do

And there's nothing I can say to you

I've got a lot of work to do
I guess I'll leave it up to you

Uninvited 
We'll stay if we want
Searching through your closets 
For your grandfathers gun

We were swimming your kidney,
Kidney shaped pool
Scratching at the bottom 
For another clue, yeah

Fon, Jo and Tootsie 
Are out on a wire
Mans tooth junkies
All full of desire

Meanwhile Rick James takes her new

And there's nothing I can do

Meanwhile Rick James takes her new

And there's nothing I can do

And there's nothing I can say to you

And there's nothing I can do

And there's nothing I can say to you

I've got a lot of work to do

I guess I'll leave it up to you
