I've got a hot rod build for speed
I love you
Turbo gasket bi-carb wheels
My darling
A tank top crew, my own pool cue
I love you
When my parole comes up in June
We'll road trip darling
You don't owe me a thing
You don't owe me a thing
You don't own me
I've been to New York City twice
Been to Oklahoma too
I could tell you some great... Oh my
My guy
I'm gonna paint her stop light green
I love you
You can be my pit-stop queen
My darling
I'll take you to the next state fair
I love you
They've got fancy hair clips there
For angels like you
You don't owe me a thing
You don't owe me a thing
You don't own me
I've been to New York City twice
Been to Oklahoma too
I could tell you some great... Oh my
My guy
