Cool blue reason empties on the page 
Your colleagues are in prison and your enemies enraged 
Cool blue reason comes into your world 
There's two more dead in Texas and it's probably your girls 
Cool blue reason wraps around your throat 
The minutes change like seasons 
Only 8 more hours to go 

Cool blue reason comes into your life 
There's one more dead in Kansas and it's probably your wife 
Cool blue reason I'm just talking to myself 
Cool blue reason I'm just rearranging hell 
I'm just talking to myself 

Cool blue reason wraps around your throat 
The minutes change likes seasons 
Only 8 more hours to go
