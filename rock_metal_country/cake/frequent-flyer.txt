Flying, flying, 'round the room
Up the treetops, to the moon
Sideways flyer, zip, zoom
You have just been ordered
Drop down to the water
You have just been ordered
Up here it's clear
I see my house
There lives my stuff
My life
Swiftly, softly floating down
All above me, skies around
Leave me hanging upside down
Swiftly, softly floating down
Watch the sky fall all around
Leave me hanging upside down
I'll be remembered
I'll be remembered
I'll be remembered
I'll be remembered
I'll be remembered
I'll be remembered
I'll be remembered
I'll be remembered
