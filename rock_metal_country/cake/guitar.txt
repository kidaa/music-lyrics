I'm sitting by the, 
Window of your, 
Thirty-second,
Floor apartment, 

Waiting,
For your, 
Phone calls, 
All to End, 

I'm sitting, 
watching, wind blow,Watching time go, 
Watching cars go by, 

I'm,
Waiting for these, 
Memories to, 
Begin, 

If I, 
Threw my guitar, 
Out the window, 
So far down, 

Would I, 
Start to regret it, 
Or would I smile, 
And watch it slowly fall, fall, fall, 

Garbage trucks, 
And taxi cabs, 
Don't seem like they can, 
Reach me here, 

The clammer, 
Of jackhammers, 
Seems so faint, 

Well, the way you treat me, 
Like the only, 
Slightly brings me down, 
Alot 

I don't think that I'll, 
Ever be the same, 

Yeah, If I, 
Threw my guitar, 
Out the window, 
So far down, 

Would I, 
Start to regret it, 
Or would I smile, 
And watch it slowly fall, fall, fall, 

Fall, fall, fall, 
Fall, fall, fall, 
Fall, fall, fall...
