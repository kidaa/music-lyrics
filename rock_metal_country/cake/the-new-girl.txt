I'm Shy
I play nice
I'm just not bright
I heard
You're adopted
I'm so mad so sad is it so bad to be adopted
I heard
You fell
I'm mad
As hell
It's true
I'm so mad so sad is it so bad to be adopted
The little kiddies they don't like to play
The little kiddies they just run away
The little kiddies they don't like to play
With you
It's true
How come
They hate me
So bad
Cause I'm new?
