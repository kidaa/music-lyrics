When she walks 
She swings her arms, instead of her hips 
When she talks she moves her mouth, instead of her lips 
I've waited for her for so long 
I've waited for her for so long 
I've wondered if I could hang on 
I've wondered if I could hang on 

"Let me go," she said 
"Let me go," she said 
Let me go and I will want you more 
Let me go, let me go 
Let me go and I will want you 

When she wants 
She wants the sun instead of the moon 
When she sees 
She sees the stars inside of her room 
I've waited for her for so long 
I've waited for her for so long 
I've wondered if I could hang on 
I've wondered if I could hang on 

"Let me go," she said 
"Let me go," she said 
Let me go and I will want you more 
"Let me go," she said 
Let me go 
Let me go, and I will want you 

"Let me go," she said 
"Let me go," she said 
"Let me go," she said 
Let me go, let me go
