when you sleep where do your fingers go? 
what do your fingers know 
what do your fingers show 
where do your fingers go 

when you sleep 
do they tremble on the edge of the bed 
or do you fold them neatly by your head 
do they clench like claws against your own skin 
when you're living your day al over again 

when you sleep 
when you sleep where do your fingers go? 
what do your fingers know 
what do your fingers show 
where do your fingers go 

do they play guitar in a latin bar 
are they strangers or lovers 
do they drive your car 
are they swimming submissively 
sex acts of life 
or just cutting through jello with a very sharp knife 

now zeus was a womanizer 
always on the make 
but hera usually punished her that zeus was one to take 

when you sleep where do your fingers go? 

are they pulling out weeds from the dusty soil 
but then never rewarded with the fruits of their toil 
are they scratching their nails on the chalkboards of death 
only seeking attention when everyone in the room has left 

when you sleep 
when you sleep where do your fingers go? 
what do your fingers know 
what do your fingers show 
where do your fingers go 

when you sleep 
do they tremble on the edge of the bed 
or do you fold them neatly by your head
