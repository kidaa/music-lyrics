She likes the finer things
Her mother bought her a diamond ring
She only puts needles in her toes
She can't stay clean
Precious hands, scratched up feet
She blacked out blue
Cracked her head, left for dead
She's gotta lie, she's gotta lie, she's gotta lie sometimes
She likes the latest, she likes the latest clothes
She's outta line, she's outta line, she's outta line this time
She likes the latest, she likes the latest clothes
Now she can fly, now she can fly, so high
Shes' got a craving, she's got a craving soul
Stay high, stay high
Stay high, stay high
Bent backwards on the floor
It's nothing new, she's been there before
I've never seen her sleep so deep
Sweet needle dreams
Precious hands, scratched up feet
Sleep while you can
I'll watch out, I'll lie again
I've gotta lie, I've gotta lie, I've gotta lie sometimes
Blacked out, there goes another morning - I slipped on the bathroom floor
I'm outta line, I'm outta line, I'm outta line this time
Blacked out, I saw my mother crying - I'll lie until there is no more
Now I can fly, now I can fly, now I can fly - It's time!
Blacked out there goes another morning
I made it through another war
