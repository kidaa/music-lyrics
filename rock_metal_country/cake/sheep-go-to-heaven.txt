I'm not feeling alright today, 
I'm not feeling that great, 
I'm not catching on fire today, 
Love has started to fade, 

I'm not going to smile today, 
I'm not gonna laugh, 
You're out living it up today, 
I've got dues to pay, 

When the grave digger puts on the foreceps, 
The stonemason does all the work, 
The barber can give you a haircut, 
The carpenter can take you out to lunch, 

Now, I just want to play on my panpipes, 
I just want to drink me some wine, 
As soon as you're born, you start dying, 
So you might as well have a good time, 

Sheep go to Heaven, 
Goats go to Hell, 
Sheep go to Heaven, 
Goats go to Hell, 

I don't wanna go to Sunset Strip, 
I don't wanna feel the emptyness, 
Old marquees with stupid band names, 
I don't wanna go to Sunset Strip, 

I don't wanna go to Sunset Strip, 
I don't wanna feel the emptyness, 
Old marquees with stupid band names, 
I don't wanna go to Sunset Strip, 

The grave digger puts on the foreceps, 
The stonemason does all the work, 
The barber can give you a haircut, 
The carpenter can take you out to lunch,

I just want to drink me some wine, 
As soon as you're born, you start dying, 
So you might as well have a good time, 

Sheep go to Heaven, 
Goats go to Hell, 
Sheep go to Heaven, 
Goats go to Hell, 

Sheep go to Heaven, 
Goats go to Hell...
