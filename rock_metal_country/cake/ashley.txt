Ashaloo, I've been thinking 'bout you
Little sister been on my mind
Heard you're practicing rebel tactics
You got a lot of me in those eyes
Been a cheat, stolen meat, lied about it later
I kicked a girl - a bitch, a brat named Yolanda Fagin
Don't be like me
Don't be like me - rock on
Killed a bat, skinned a cat, stuffed 'em in a crate
I've hurt some people on the way to being nothing great
Don't be like me
Don't be like me - rock on
Little girl she went to a party
She wore her princess dress and wand
But she forgot to put on her panties - sad, lonely one
Broke in the trailer 'cause someone said so
No sir, I had no idea they were gone
They said a nice policeman brought you home, whoa, oh, oh
Ashley girl, I've been thinking 'bout you
I know you mean well, it just comes out wrong
You brought home a groundhog half dead
Thank god he didn't stink for long
Christened the scooter 'fore someone said so
You fell off in the neighbors flowers
They thought that you had planned it all
Door to door Halloween they caught you
You thought you had done nothing wrong
You were dressed as a hooker all night long
Why don't you look like me
Why don't you look like me
Why don't you look like me
Why don't you look like me
Why don't you look like me
Why don't you look like me
Why don't you look like me
