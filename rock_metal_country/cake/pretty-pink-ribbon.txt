Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd end up just like me
Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd fload down to the sea

Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd say just what you pleased
Without the sticky little kitten
You're ticket could never be free

Without your tight little denum
Your virtues would all go unknown
Without the room that you live in
Your cancer would eat through the bone

Your muscles would bulge underground
Your demons would all be around
Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd end up just like me

Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd end up just like me
Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd burn all these dying leaves

Without the pretty pink ribbon
You would lift this steaming herd
You would kill all the sick ones
You would bury them deep in the earth

Without the tight little denum
Your virtues would all go unknown
Without the room that you live in
Your cancer would eat through the bone

Your muscles would bulge underground
Your demons would all be around
Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd end up just like me
