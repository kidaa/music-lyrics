There was a guy
I used to know
His name is Joe
He used to live across the street
And every day
Joe would say
Do you wanna come out and play?
And I'd say
I'd love to, Joe
But I can't
Wanna know why
I've got a bum leg
Got a bum leg
Got a bum leg
Got a bum leg
I used to know
Her name is Patina
She used to live across the street
And every day
Patina would say
Do you wanna come out and play?
And I'd say
I'd love to, Patina
But I can't
Wanna know why
I've got a bum leg
Got a bum leg
Got a bum leg
Got a bum leg
I used to know
Her name is Sheila
We used to go to Sunday school
And every day
Sheila would say
Do you wanna come out and play?
And I'd say
I'd love to, Sheila
But I can't
Because your dad works for my dad
Your dad works for my dad
Your dad works for my dad
Your dad works for my dad
My dad
My dad
My dad
