Bring some bodies that smell like wine
Bring some fruitcake, bring some fruitcake
La,la,la,la,la,la,la,la
Bring some fruitcake, bring some fruitcake
La,la,la,la,la,la,la,la
I'd kiss a pirate if he'd cry
I'd kiss a pirate many times
Bring some fruitcake, bring some fruitcake
La,la,la,la,la,la,la,la
Just bring some fruitcake, bring some fruitcake
La,la,la,la,la,la,la,la
She's tired of breaking the face just for the sake of it
A little drop of this wine will make sure it hits
I've never been to the race but I imagine it's fun
I imagine it's fun
I'll leave a light on when it's time
Bring some bodies that smell like wine
Bring some fruitcake, bring some fruitcake
La,la,la,la,la,la,la,la
Just bring some fruitcake, bring some fruitcake
La,la,la,la,la,la,la,la
I'd kiss a pirate if he'd cry
I'd kiss a pirate many times
Bring some fruitcake, bring some fruitcake
La,la,la,la,la,la,la,la
Bring some fruitcake, bring some fruitcake
La,la,la,la,la,la,la,la
She's tired of breaking the face just for the sake of it
A little drop of this wine will make sure it hits
I've never been to the race but I imagine it's fun
I imagine it's fun
