Started with a smoke
Uh oh
Oh no
There's a building on fire
The house is on fire - the apartment's on fire
Ooo wow
This is no game little boy
Get your cars - out of the driveway
Ooo wow
Wait in the driveway
The house is on fire - the apartment's on fire
Ooo wow
Looks like you did some damage
Get your car - out of the driveway!

I don't care who you are get out of the way
Did you do this? Did you do this?
We're comin' in - stand back!
It wasn't me I wasn't there I didn't do it
It wasn't me I wasn't there
I like you I like you!
Cross my heart and hope to die
Stick a needle in my eye
I need you I need you now!
Cross my heart and hope to die
Cross my heart and I hope to die
