Music: Marillion Lyrics: Steve Hogarth & John Helmer
Staring out over the bridge
A million photo flashes from the water down below 
Dawn light bouncing through the mist 
The roar of traffic and the crack of police radios
When they ask her name
Would she please explain 
She simply chooses to say ... nothing
