So here I am once more
In the playground of the broken hearts
One more experience, one more entry in a diary, self-penned 
Yet another emotional suicide 
Overdosed on sentiment and pride 
Too late to say I love you 
Too late to restage the play
Abandoning the relics in my playground of yesterday
I'm losing on the swings
I'm losing on the roundabouts 
I'm losing on the swings
I'm losing on the roundabouts 
Too much, too soon, too far to go, too late to play
The game is over, the game is over
So here I am once more
In the playground of the broken hearts
I'm losing on the swings
I'm losing on the roundabouts
The game is over
Yet another emotional suicide 
Overdosed on sentiment and pride
I'm losing on the swings
I'm losing on the roundabouts, roundabouts, the game is over
Too late to say I love you
Too late to restage the play
The game is over
I act the role in classic style 
Of a martyr carved with twisted smile
To bleed the lyric for this song 
To write the rites to right my wrongs 
An epitaph to a broken dream
To exercise this silent scream
A scream that's born from sorrow
I never did write that lovesong
The words just never seemed to flow
Now sad in reflection did I gaze through perfection 
And examine the shadows on the other side of morning 
And examine the shadows on the other side of morning 
Promised wedding now a wake
Promised wedding now a wake, awake
The fool escaped from paradise 
Will look over his shoulder and cry
Sit and chew on daffodils and struggle to answer ";Why?"; 
As you grow up and leave the playground 
Where you kissed your prince and found your frog
Remember the jester that showed you tears, the script for tears
So I'll hold our peace forever when you wear your bridal gown
In the silence of my shame the mute that sang the sirens' song
Has gone solo in the game
I've gone solo in the game, but the game is over
Can you still say you love me
Can you still say you love me 
Can you still say that you love me
Do you love me
Do you love me
Do you love me
Do you love me, the jester's tear
Can you still say you love me
Can you still say you love me
Can you still say that you love me?
The jester's tear, the jester's tear 
Do you love me
