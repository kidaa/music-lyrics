Music: Marillion Lyrics: Steve Hogarth
Maybe you're just too upset inside to give it to me straight 
Maybe you've become too angry and too close to crying to say anything I can understand
Or maybe you're just coming in over my head 
Maybe you're just too upset inside too upset inside
How can it hurt if I don't understand 
How can it hurt if I don't understand 
How can it hurt if I don't understand 
How can it hurt if I don't understand
You're never gonna square with me I know so what is there to say?
There's a million words that we could share tonight 
Why do you walk away? 
And I could write you off and it's over with like a damaged car I can't afford to fix
But everything inside me wants to heal your pain 
You won't explain
You won't explain
How can it hurt if I don't understand
How can it hurt if I don't understand 
How can it hurt if I don't understand 
How can it hurt if I don't understand 
How can it hurt, how can it hurt 
Well I don't understand 
Well I don't understand
Tell me how can it hurt 
Well I don't understand
Tell me how can it hurt 
Well I don't understand
