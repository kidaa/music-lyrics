Music: Marillion Lyrics: John Helmer
I wonder if my ropes still hanging from the tree
By the standing pool where you drank me
And filled me full of thirsty love 
And the memory of water?
Wonder if a king still fishes there
His back toward the burned out air 
His laughing catches singing loud 
The memory of water
Your taste is blood and ecstasy
But I must drink you all alone 
Youre freckled like a speckled egg
A dove but this bird has flown
O stay with me sweet memory
O stay with me
Wonder if my ropes still hanging from the tree
By the standing pool where you drank me 
As pain flows through me like champagne 
Of the memory of water
