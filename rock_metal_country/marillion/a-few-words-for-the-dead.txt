Can you make it on your own
Can you take it by the throat
Make your own luck - learn the skills
Get in early 
For the kill
It carries on
Pick up the weapon
Marry it. Give it your name
Define yourself by it
Take it down the disco
Trigger happy
Pulling power
LadyKiller 
Take em out
See the weirdos
On the hill
Come to get you 
If you stand still 
It carries on..
Somewhere in history
You were wronged
Raise your children
To bang the drum
Tell all your family
Tell all your friends
Teach your brothers
To avenge
It carries on
Or you could LOVE...
You could LOVE
Lie down in the flowers
In the blue of the air
Open your eyes. Why use up your life for anything else?
No need to fight for what everyone has 
What do you need?
It's already there 
It's already there
You could LOVE
So he carried the stars in his pocket
He drank the sunrise till was drunk
He embraced the angels
They swam like little minnows in his blood
Ghosts in his eyes
Out walking beside him
Laughing like children in his mind
They chanted his mantra together
";You could love";
They were happy.
