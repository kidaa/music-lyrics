I was walking in the park 
Dreaming of a spark
When I heard the sprinklers whisper
Shimmer in the haze of summer lawns. 
Then I heard the children singing
They were running through the rainbows. 
They were singing a song for you
Well it seemed to be a song for you
The one I wanted to write for you
Lavenders blue, dilly dilly, lavenders green
When I am King, dilly dilly
You will be Queen
A penny for your thoughts my dear
A penny for your thoughts my dear
I.O.U. for your love
I.O.U. for your love
Lavenders green, dilly dilly, lavenders blue
When you love me, dilly dilly, I will love you
A penny for your thoughts my dear
A penny for your thoughts my dear
I.O.U. for your love
I.O.U. for your love
Lavender dreams dilly, dilly lavender true
When you miss me dilly dilly, I did miss you 
A penny for your thoughts my dear 
A penny for your thoughts my dear
I.O.U for your love
I.O.U. for your love
For your love
 Blue Angel
The sky was Bible black in Lyon
When I met the Magdalene
She was paralyzed in a streetlight
She refused to give her name
And a ring of violet bruises
They were pinned upon her arm
Two hundred francs for sanctuary and she led me by the hand
To a room of dancing shadows 
Where all the heartache disappears 
And from glowing tongues of candles I heard her whisper in my ear
'J'entend ton coeur', 'J'entend ton coeur'
I can hear your heart, I can hear your heart, I can hear your heart
Hear your heart. I hear your heart
