On the rebound, fumbling all the lines 
The light at the end of the bottle - alcoholicalphabet 
Through the looking glass
The proof in my own reflection 
Five senses down and reeling on the Cinderella search
On the rebound, fumbling all the lines
Decay on the vertical hold with a horizontal aim 
Conversation needs translation 
Three dimensions down dissolving on the Cinderella search
Cinderella search
On the rebound, fumbling all the lines 
Dreaming bartenders, bourbon and saxophone
Out of luck, out of charm, out the game of rejections in a cigarette city
Only courting the homing of direction on the Cinderella search
Cinderella search
But the Samaritan of the heartbroken, heartbroken
Swam through the nicotine seize, and we exchanged the kiss of life
Resurrection in a trance, the model, the Grail, in a Marquee of promises I touched the dream
I hold the dream, I have the dream 
To end the Cinderella search
Cinderella search, oh no more, no more!
Exposing bedside manners on a work extension 
Awaiting development with paranoid Polaroid eyes
Polaroid eyes
The footman memorised the number 
But the prince still holds both the slippers
And would you leave a palace for a bedsit 
And Canterbury Tales
Canterbury Tales?
Maybe it was infatuation or the thrill of the chase
Maybe you were always beyond my reach and my heart was playing safe 
But was that love in your eye I saw or the reflection of mine?
Give me time, won't you give me that time!
Welcome back to the circus 
Welcome back to the circus 
Welcome back to the circus
I always use the cue sheets but never the nets
Always the cue sheets but never the nets
Never the nets, never the nets, nevertheless, nevertheless, nevertheless, nevertheless, nevertheless
Welcome back to the circus!
