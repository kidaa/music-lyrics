Music: Marillion Lyrics: John Helmer
Ive been feeling kind of down and loose 
Like a Rosicrucian pope
Head down deep in the womb of time 
Carrying a message of hope 
My hands steady as a hangmans hands 
Surer than the hangmans rope
I could sleep for invisible years 
Carrying a message of hope
For the future
For the future
Carrying a message
Carrying a message
Carrying a message
Message of hope
Ive been feeling kind of down and loose 
Like a Rosicrucian pope
Head down deep in the womb of time 
Carrying a message of hope 
My hands steady as a hangmans hands 
Surer than the hangmans rope
I could sleep for invisible years 
Carrying a message of hope
For the future
For the future
I found a power on a dusty shelf 
Hey!-the languages I learned
Now Im so powerful I hurt myself 
I hurt myself 
I feel kind of limbie brain
Like the library of an astronaut
Found hidden in a pyramid 
Shadowing a body of thought
Carrying a message
Message of hope
Madam Im Adam, Im a palindrome 
Never odd or even any time 
Fishin and smilin like a garden gnome 
Twisting tales and spinning lines
Spinning lines 
Twisting tales 
Why dont we twist like we did last year?
Carrying, carrying a message 
Message of hope
