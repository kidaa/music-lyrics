I found smog at the end of my rainbow
I found my thoughts shift slowly into phase
Declared the constitution of the walkway 
I realise it's time to plan the day, the day
I'm a Market Square Hero gathering the storms to troop 
Cause I'm a Market Square Hero speeding the beat of the streetpulse
Are you following me, are you following me? 
Well suffer my pretty warriors and follow me
I got a golden handshake that nearly broke my arm
I left the ranks of shuffling graveyard people 
I got rust upon my hands from the padlocked factory gates 
Silent chimneys provide the silent steeples 
Cause I'm a Market Square Hero gathering the storms to troop
Cause I'm a Market Square Hero speeding the beat of the streetpulse, the streetpulse
Are you following me? are you following me?
Well suffer my pretty children and follow me, follow me
Change, change, change! 
Change, change, change!
I am your Antichrist show me allegiance
Are you following me
I am your Antichrist pledge to me defiance
Are you following me
Suffer my pretty warriors
Suffer my fallen child
Are you following me
The time has come to conquer and I'll provide your end 
Suffer!
We March!
I give peace signs when I wage war in the disco
I'm the warrior in the ultra violet haze 
Armed with antisocial insecurity 
I plan the path of destiny from this maze
Cause I'm a Market Square Hero gathering the storms to troop 
Cause I'm a Market Square Hero speeding the beat of the streetpulse, the streetpulse
Are you following me? are you following me? 
Well suffer my fallen angels and follow me 
I'm the Market Square Hero
I'm the Market Square Hero
We're Market Square Heroes
We're the Market Square Heroes
Are you following me?
I'm the Market Square Hero!
