Punch and Judy
Punch and Judy
Punch and Judy
Washing machine, pinstripe dream
Stripped the gloss from a beauty queen
Punch and Judy, Judy
Found our nest, in the Daily Express
Met the vicar in a holy vest
Punch and Judy
Punch and Judy
Brought up the children Church of E
Now I vegetate with a colour TV
Worst ever thing that ever happened to me
Oh, for D.I.V.O.R.C.E.
Oh Judy
Whatever happened to pillow fights
Whatever happened to jeans so tight, Friday nights
Whatever happened to lover's lane 
Whatever happened to passion games
Sunday walks in the pouring rain
Punch

Punch and Judy
Punch and Judy
Curling tongs, mogadons, ";I got a headache baby, don't take so long";
Single beds, middle age dread
Losing the war in the Waistlands spread
Who left the cap of the toothpaste tube
Who forgot to flush the loo
Leave your sweaty socks outside the door 
Don't walk across my polished floor, oh Judy
Whatever happened to morning smiles
Whatever happened to wicked wiles, permissive styles
Whatever happened to twinkling eyes
Whatever happened to hard fast drives
Complements on unnatural size

Propping up a bar, family car
Sweating out a mortgage as a balding clerk
Punch and Judy, Judy
World war three, suburbanshee
Just slip her these pills and I'll be free.
No more Judy
Judy, Judy no more! 
Goodbye Judy!
