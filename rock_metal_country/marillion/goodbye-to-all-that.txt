Music: Marillion Lyrics: Steve Hogarth & John Helmer
They try to trace her in the town 
Appeal for information on the local news
Someone must have missed her by now
A mother or a father or a friendly face to talk her down
She's heading for the great escape 
Heading for the rave
Heading for the permanent holiday ...
 i wave
Hold your breath ... 'till you feel it begin ...
Here it comes ... 
Do you feel that?... 
... 'Feel this?
Get used to it ...
She had the face of the statue of liberty
Oh free me
The fire and ice of Amazon and Eskimo 
Take me home
The edge and glance of high fashion 
Ask me about next year ... 
 ii made
Tell me I'm mad
How should I know?
Tell me I'm mad 
I have been here for so long ...
Help me paint a picture 
They say it's a lie
Tell me I'm mad! 
You're a fine one to decide
Burn me in the fires of wild heaven
Like it never would stop 
Tell me I'm mad 
Tell me I imagined that ...
Was it something I didn't say? 
Or was it something I said 
Leave that stuff alone 
Use me instead
I know I'm always falling off the edge of the world 
I got space in my bed
";Off with his head!"; ... ";Clearly, he's mad";
You've got Egypt in your head
I've got a headful of Troy 
Chandeliers and Charlemagne
Fireworks and toys
 iii the opinum den
But you sleep like a ghost with me 
It's as simple as that 
So tell me I'm mad
Roll me up and breathe me in 
Come to my madness
My opium den 
Come to my madness
Make sense of it again 
 iv the slide
Make a drug of my senses
I'll get you out of your head ...
I'm sick for you ...
Love wastes us together 
Love holds us together
Love folds us together 
Flowers ...
 v standing in the swing
I don't know what you're doing here 
When there's murder on the street 
I appreciate your concern 
But don't waste your time on me 
I'm ashes on the water now 
Somewhere far away 
You think you came here just in time
But you're twenty years too late 
You won't have long to wait
Easy
You said I was easy 
This world sharpens teeth 
Eat your words ...
