I am the assassin, with tongue forged from eloquence
I am the assassin, providing your nemesis
On the sacrificial altar to success, my friend
Unleash a stranger from a kiss, my friend
No incantations of remorse, my friend
Unsheathe the blade within the voice, my friend
My friend, my friend, my friend
I am the assassin
Who decorates the scarf with the fugi knot 
Who camouflaged emotion in a thousand yard stare
Who gouged the notches from the family tree 
Who hypnotised the guilt in career rhythm trance
Assassing, assassing, assassing, assassing
Listen to the blade, feel the blade!
Listen as the syllables of slaughter cat with calm precision 
Patterned frosty phrases rape your ears and sow the ice incision
Adjectives of annihilation
Bury the point beyond redemption 
Venomous verbs of ruthless candour 
Plagiarise assassins fervour 
Apocalyptic alphabet casting spell 
The creed of tempered diction
My friend, your friend the assassin
My friend, your friend the assassin
A friend in need is a friend that bleeds
A friend in need is a friend that bleeds
Let bitter silence infect the wound
Let bitter silence infect the wound
I am the assassin, my friend 
I am the assassin, my friend
I am the assassin, my friend 
You were a sentimental mercenary in a free fire zone parading a Hollywood conscience
You were a fashionable objector with a uniform fetish
Pavlovian slaver at the cash till ring of success 
A non com observer
I assassin the collector
Defector
So you resigned yourself to failure, my friend
And I emerged the chilling stranger, my friend
To eradicate the problem, my friend
Unsheathe the blade within the voice, within the voice
Within the voice, within the voice
And what do you call assassins who accuse assassins anyway, my friend?
