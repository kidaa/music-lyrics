Music: Marillion Lyrics: Steve Hogarth
A hundred nights of fun and games 
A thousand empty glasses
I feel it change and stay the same 
As each day passes
They invite me to their gatherings 
In the finer parts of town
They seem attracted to my indifference 
The irony just knocks me out
And I love them as if I love them
And they reciprocate with help
But I look up at these mirrors sometimes 
Oh, and I can't see myself
They say that some are born to burn 
And some are born to give 
They say that people live and learn 
Some people only live and live
You don't know that I come here
If you did you would know why 
So we close our eyes
You didn't notice me
As I passed you on the stairs 
How could you ever guess lookin' at my face 
How closely I share your taste
How well I know your place 
Even the clothes you wear
I've seen them when you're not there
You say that you can win win win
If you know how to play the game
But while you're out there playing you see
There's something you should know 
She spends your money 
She spends your money 
She spends your money 
She spends your money on me
This town has turned me into what I have become
This town dresses you up like a stranger
This town hangs around in the doorway and tells me I'm late
This town takes us down, takes us down
I feel like I'm losing you to this town
