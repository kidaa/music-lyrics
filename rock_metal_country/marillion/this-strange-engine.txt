Music: Marillion Lyrics: Steve Hogarth
There was a boy who came into this world at the hands of a holy woman in a holy place
He wore a red coat and walked a bulldog-saw them reflected in the mirror of the lakes 
Lived in the shadow of the mountains with the smells of disinfectant, dusty old leather and the polished wood of his bed 
No more than a baby feeding swans on the river holding the hands of his mother, and the wax paperbag of yesterdays bread
And his father on the other side of the world 
On the ships railings and some far away tide 
With the silent dry tear of home thoughts from abroad in his far away eyes
In his far away eyes
The smell of the wax on the wooden floor
Mixture of polish and soap 
No children to fear or to play with
Rows of empty hooks for the coats 
An upright piano and the boys in the choir 
Still remind him of just before he was born
Remind him of just before he was breathing
Strange misty visions of God
Turn the cities into families
Into villages of souls 
Hovering in the air while theyre sleeping
With their houses invisible 
Running as fast as I could run
Send to me the ghosts of Christmas 
Whispering: ";Youre the only one";
And ever since I was a boy 
I never felt that I belonged 
Like everything they did to me 
Was an experiment to see
How I would cope with the illusion
In which direction would I jump 
Would I do it all the same 
As the actors in the game 
Or would I spit it back at them 
And not get caught up in their rules
And live according to my own 
And not be used, and not be used
To find the fundamental truths
It was going to take some time
Thirty five summers down the line 
The wisdom of each passing year 
Seems to serve only to confuse
Seems to serve only to confuse
Daddy came out the navy and took us away to his dirty gray home town 
And he worked down on a coal mine for National Service so that he could be around 
There was a magical purple in the chrome of the exhaust of his triumph motor bike
And a warmth of oil and metal and the thrill of the hard corner holding tight
From the horizon
Came home from the navy to the mine
From the horizon
To buried alive 
Took his dream underground 
Buried his treasure in his far away eyes
And one day as the boy lay sleeping in the sunshine of a half remembered afternoon
A cloud of bees with no particular aim, and no brain
Found the boy, decided that his time had come 
Came down out of the sky
Stung him in the face
Again and again
Blue pain
Screaming like baptism 
Intraveinous, Jesus
Like being chosen
Something with no brain
Blue pain from something with no brain
I cant explain 
Its happening again
Oh mummy, daddy, will you sit a while with me 
Oh mummy, daddy, will you jog my memory
Tell me tall tales of Montego Bay, Table mountain, Flying fish, Banana spiders, Pots of paint 
And the sun on the equator 
Setting like an ember thrown to deep water
From crimson to black
But coming back
Tomorrow on the horizon
The blue pain
Fades to a point where it doesnt fade 
It stayed
Blue
Stirred his red coat heart to this strange engine 
This love
This love
This inconvenient, blind, blood-diamond
This puzzle 
This love
This blind
Blood-diamond
This puzzle
I dont understand 
That knows no faith 
And tries and fails
And tries again 
Stares at the sea
The nights dark deep
For one last time 
And bleeds
And bleeds 
And dies for you
And lies 
And is to blame
And is ashamed
And is not the same
This truth
This truth
This truth
This truth
And lies 
And is to blame
And is ashamed
And is true
