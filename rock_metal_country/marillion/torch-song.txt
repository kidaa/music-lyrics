Fish, Steve Rothery, Mark Kelly, Pete Trewavas, Ian Mosley
Read some Kerouac and it put me on the tracks to burn a little brighter now
Something about roman candles fizzing out, shine a little light on me now
Found a strange fascination with a liquid fixation, alcohol can thrill me now
It's getting late in the game to show any pride or shame
I just burn a little brighter now, burn a little brighter now, yeah
Doctor says my liver looks like leaving with my lover, need another 'time out' now 
Like any sort of hero turning down to zero still standing out in any crowd
Pulling seventeen with experience and dreams, sweating out a happy hour
Where you're hiding 29 you know it ain't a crime to burn a little brighter now
Burn a little brighter now, burn a little brighter now, burn a little brighter now
Dr. Finlay: ";And my advice is if you maintain this lifestyle you won't reach 30";
Torch: ";Christ -- it's a romantic way to go really, it's part of the heritage, it's your round i'n'it?
We burn a little brighter now, yeah
Read some Kerouac and it put me on the tracks to burn a little brighter now
It was something about roman candles fizzing out, shine a little light on me now 
Found a strange fascination with a liquid fixation, alcohol thrill me now 
Getting late in the game to show any pride or shame burn a little brighter now
We burn a little brighter now, yeah
Burn a little brighter now, we burn a little brighter now
