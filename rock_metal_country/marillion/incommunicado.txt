Fish, Steve Rothery, Mark Kelly, Pete Trewavas, Ian Mosley
I'd be really pleased to meet you if I could remember your name
But I got problems of the memory ever since I got a winner in the fame game 
I'm a citizen of Legoland travellin' incommunicado 
And I don't give a damn for the Fleet Street afficionados
But I don't want to be the backpage interview
I don't want launderette anonymity 
I want my handprints in the concrete on Sunset Boulevard
A dummy in Tussauds you'll see
Incommunicado, incommunicado, incommunicado, incommunicado
I'm a Marquee veteran, a multi-media bonafide celebrity
I've got an allergy to Perrier, daylight and responsibility
I'm a rootin-tootin cowboy, the Peter Pan, the street credibility
Always taking the point with the dawn patrol fraternity
Sometimes it seems like I've been here before when I hear opportunity kicking in my door
Call it synchronicity call it Deja Vu I just put my faith in destiny -- it's the way that I choose
But I don't want to be a tin can tied to the bumper of a wedding limousine
Or currently residing in the where are they now file a toupet on the cabaret scene
I want to do adverts for American Express cards talk shows on prime time TV
A villa in France, my own cocktail bar and that's where you're gonna find me
Incommunicado, incommunicado, incommunicado, incommunicado
Sometimes it seems like I've been here before when I hear opportunity kicking in my door 
Call it synchronicity call it Deja Vu I just put my faith in destiny -- it's the way that I choose
Incommunicado, incommunicado, incommunicado, incommunicado
It's the only way
Incommunicado, incommunicado, incommunicado, incommunicado
