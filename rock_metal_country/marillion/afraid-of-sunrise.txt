Music: Marillion Lyrics: Steve Hogarth & John Helmer
Dressed in black, no turning back 
We blanked out the Great White Way
Fingers in desires crack
We'd bridge and tunnel into day
Abandoned to the salt of skin 
Abandoned to the highway 
Sand running in the hourglass 
Heat of leather and mirages
So how do we now come to be 
Afraid of sunlight 
So how do we now come to be 
Afraid of sunlight
Dayglo Jesus on the dash 
Scorch marks on the road ahead 
Friendly fire in hostile waters 
Keep the faith, don't lose your head
Don't lose your head
Afraid of sunlight 
So how do we now come to be 
Afraid of sunlight
Agave flower 
Sleeps beside me 
Drivin' on
Nevada's burnin'
Phoenix rising
Drivin' on 
To sunlight
Dayglo Jesus on the dash 
Scorch marks on the road ahead
Friendly fire in hostile waters 
Keep the faith, don't lose your head 
Don't lose your head
So how do we now come to be 
Afraid of sunlight 
How do we now come to be 
Afraid
Afraid of Sunlight
