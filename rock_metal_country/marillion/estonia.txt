Music: Marillion Lyrics: Steve Hogarth
Feeling you shake
Feel your heart break
Thinking If only If only If only If only
And the salt water runs 
Through your veins and your bones
Telling you no not this way, not this way, not this way
And you would give anything
Give up everything 
Offer your life blood away
For yesterday
No one leaves you
When you live in their heart and mind 
And no one dies 
They just move to the other side
When were gone
Watch the world simply carry on 
We live on laughing and in no pain 
Well stay and be happy 
With those who have loved us today
Finding the answer Its a human obsession
But you might as well talk to the stones and the trees and the sea
Cause nobody knows
And so few can see 
Theres only beauty and caring and truth beyond darkness
No one leaves you 
When you live in their heart and mind
And we wont understand your grief
Because time is illusion
As this watery world spins around 
This timeless sun 
Will dry your eyes
And calm your mind
No one leaves you 
When you live in their heart and mind
And no one dies 
They just move to the other side
Watch the world simply carry on 
Its okay, we will stay and be happy
Stay and be happy 
With those who have loved us today
Who loved us today
