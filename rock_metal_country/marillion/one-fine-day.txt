Music: Marillion Lyrics: John Helmer
When we were young we used to say
Things would be different
One fine day
The walls would crumble 
Nations sing as one 
We live in hope, cause so far 
It hasnt come
Listenin to the pouring rain 
Waiting for the world to change
Beginning to wonder if well wait in vain 
For one fine day
Oh, how years change the things for which we strive
A better world.. or just a quiet life
What seemed so simple 
Is still so far away 
Dont hold you breath waitin 
For one fine day
Listenin to the pouring rain 
Waiting for the world to change
Beginning to wonder if well wait in vain
For one fine day
Life is strange 
It can seem youre high and dry
Turn around
You find theres nothing in this world you recognise
Did we fall asleep babe? 
Dreaming that dream babe?
Listenin to the pouring rain...
Did we fall asleep babe? 
Dreaming that dream babe?
