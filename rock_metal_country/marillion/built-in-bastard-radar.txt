Best of three, the angel said 
As daylight burst behind his head 
Jacob all night wrestling with his angel 
Then out into the boul' St. Mich 
He cruises in a new Corniche 
Now doesn't God stand up for B-A-S-T-A-R-D-S 
Baby you can't lose it 
You'd be mad to choose it 
Dont you know he was born to do you down 
You can't cheat your fate girl 
Check the time and date girl 
Don't you know he was born to do you down 
But guys who show how much they care
Try hard to please and get nowhere 
You know that every girl round here got built-in bastard radar 
Baby you can't lose it 
You'd be mad to choose it
Don't you know he was born to do you down 
'Cause what will be will always be
Though stinging kills the honey bee 
You know that every girl on Earth's got built in bastard radar 
I'm singing ";one-two"; in the mike
You know I'm testing 
I'm singing ";Death where is thy sting?"; 
It's only resting 
And thank God every woman knows 
It's piss and wind and fancy clothes 
That make a man a man
Thank God for built-in bastard radar
