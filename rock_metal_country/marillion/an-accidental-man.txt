Music: Marillion Lyrics: John Helmer
I was taught from the much too young
To never give myself away
Yes I was taught for every secret 
Theres a price you have to pay
An accident of gender
An accident of birth 
That holds me to this point of view
This time and place on earth 
This time and place on earth
You ask me how Im feeling 
I only wish you knew
How hard it is for me to share 
Share those kind of things with you
Its not that I dont love you
Its just I cant connect
Cause I was taught from much too young
To shine and not reflect
Im an accidental man
You ask me if Im happy
I only wish I knew
Cause happiness is not something 
That I ever learned to do
Its not that Im complaining 
Its all the same to me 
If everything that happens, happens
Accidentally
Im an accidental man
I was taught for every secret 
Theres a price you have to pay
I was thought from much too young
To never give myself away
I was born to worthy causes
I was born to take the reins
I was taught from much too young
To never give myself away
An accident of gender 
An accident of birth
That holds me to this point of view 
This time and place on earth
So try and understand if 
I dont say all I can 
A stranger to myself I am
An accidental man
Im an accident
Im an accidental man
