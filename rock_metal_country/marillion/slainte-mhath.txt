Fish, Steve Rothery, Mark Kelly, Pete Trewavas, Ian Mosley
A hand held over a candle in angst fuelled bravado 
A carbon trail scores a moist stretched palm
Trapped in the indecision of another fine menu 
And you sit there and ask me to tell you the story so far
This is the story so far
Shuffling your memories dealing your doodles in margins
You scrawl out your poems across a beermat or two
And when you declare the point of grave creation 
They turn round and you to tell them the story so far 
This is the story so far
And you listen with a tear in you eye 
To their hopes and betrayals and your only reply 
Is Slinte Mhath
Princes in exile raising the standard Drambuie 
Parading their anecdotes tired from old campaigns 
Holding their own last orders commanding attention
We sit here and listen to all of the story so far 
This is the story so far
Take it away
Take it away
Take it away 
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
From the dream on the barbed wire at Flanders and Bilston Glen
From a Clydeside that rusts from the tears of its broken men 
From the realisation that all we've been left behind
Is to stand like our fathers before us in the firing line
Waiting on the whistle to blow
We stand here waiting on the whistle to blow 
They promised us miracles, and the whistle still blows 
Broken promises but the whistle still blows 
Waiting on the wistle to blow
We stand here waiting on the wistle to blow
