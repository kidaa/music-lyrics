Music: Marillion Lyrics: Steve Hogarth
On top of the world like a flag on a mountain
Feeling so high you can feel so alone
Unable to breathe at the height that you flew
Staring on clouds with no view of below
On top of a girl like a dream in a hotel 
Falling toward something out of control 
Unable to miss like the man in the tram 
Crashing your car in Amsterdam
He did it without knowing, didn't feel a thing 
Just wrecked it and kept going
The space around the stars is something that you know
A billion miles of darkness left your feeling low 
The space around the stars is something that you know
Everything about you so perfectly restrained 
But everything inside you, bites you 
Bites you
Everybody in the whole of the world, feels the same inside
Everybody in the whole, whole of the, whole of the of the world
Everyone is only everyone else 
Everybody's got to know
Everybody lives and loves and laughs and cries 
And eats and sleeps and grows and dies 
Everybody in the whole of the world is the same this time
Everybody in the whole of the world, feels the same inside 
Everybody in the whole, whole of the, whole of the, whole of the world 
Everyone is only everyone else
Everybody's got to know 
Everybody lives and loves and laughs and cries 
And eats and sleeps and grows and dies
Everybody in the whole of the world
Everybody is the same this time
In the whole of the world
