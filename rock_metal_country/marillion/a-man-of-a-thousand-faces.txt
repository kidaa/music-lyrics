Music: Marillion Lyrics: John Helmer
I'm the man of a thousand faces
A little piece of me in every part I take
I hold the tape for a thousand races 
A different point of view in every speech I make
Cut me a piece of my divided soul
Cry me a river, call it rock and roll 
Speak to a leader with the voice of command 
And when I talk to God I know hell understand
I speak to machines with the voice of humanity 
I'll Speak to the wise with the voice of insanity
Im the man of a thousand faces
A little piece of me in every part I take
I hold the tape for a thousand races 
A different point of view in every speech I make
Cut me a piece of my divided soul 
Cry me a river, call it rock and roll 
Give me an attitude and watch me make it lie
Pass me a microphone
I need to testify
Well I speak to machines with the voice of humanity
Speak to the wise with the voice of insanity 
Speak to the present in the past and future tense 
Speak to a slave with the voice of obedience
Im the man of a thousand ages 
You see my face in the stones of the Parthenon 
You hear my song in the babble of Babylon 
Im the man of a thousand riches
Be my guest at the feast of Satyricon 
You spend the money that my logos printed on
Well I'll speak to machines with the voice of humanity
Speak to the wise with the voice of insanity
Speak to the present in the past and future tense 
Speak to a slave with the voice of obedience
I stole a fire but it burned up much too soon
I took a leap and I landed on the moon
Look at my life and it looks like CNN 
You see something once yknow its gonna come around again
Well Ill speak to machines with the voice of humanity
Speak to the wise with the voice of insanity 
Speak to a woman with the fatal charm of a snake
Forgive like a giver and account for all I take
Yes, I Speak to machines with the voice of humanity 
Speak to the wise with the voice of insanity 
Speak like a leader with the voice of power and command 
And when I talk to God I know hell understand
Cause Im the man of a thousand faces 
Yes Im the man of a thousand faces
I stole a fire but it burned up too much too soon
I took a leap and I landed on the moon..
Voice of command 
Voice of a snake 
Voice of humanity 
Voice of insanity
Voice of command 
Voice of a snake 
Voice of humanity 
Voice of insanity
Voice of command 
Voice of obedience 
Thousand faces
Thousand races 
Cry me a river
Face in the stars
Stones in the Parthenon
Babble of Babylon
Voice of command 
Voice of a snake 
Voice of humanity
Voice of insanity
Thousand faces 
Thousand races 
Cry me a river 
Steal a fire
Face in the stars 
Stones in the Parthenon 
Babble of Babylon 
Landed on the moon
