Curl up tight into a ball
Curl my body against the soil
Staring up here 
At the Cathedral Wall
I will sleep tonight
Be a baby. Forget it all
Be a baby watch the quiet stones
Massive friend Cathedral Wall 
I will sleep tonight
A mother to the living
A mother to the dead
Silent as the moonlight
I come to lay my head
And I won't know you. Anymore
The peckish evening rolls once more
Into the ravenous night
Of hunger pains
That keep our troubled souls awake
A mother to the living
A mother to the dead
My ghost will drink the moonlight
Magic stones My heart and bones
And I won't know you. Anymore
She's cold and she knows peace. Cathedral wall
She's cold. She shows. I borrow
Keep away
Keep you away my love, my love
And pray
I might sleep tonight
The violence of my heartbeat
The violence of the blood
I will sleep with the Cathedral
And, one day, you'll give up
And I will love you
But I won't know you
Anymore
