Heading for the great escape
Heading for the rave
Heading for the permanent holiday 
Heading for the winter trip 
Heading for the slide 
Heading for the dignified walk away 
Heading for the open road
Goodbye to all that 
Heading for the automatic overload 
Standing in the open boat 
Standing in the swing 
Waiting for the ringing and the bright light 
Waiting to be recognised 
Quiet applause will do
They shower you with flowers when they bury you 
You're holding on, you're holding on ... 
I. The Last of You
Just when I thought I'd seen the last of you 
You come here scratchin' at my door 
Your pain and anger's in the howling dark 
Of every corridor I walk 
So tell me more about the love that you rejected 
Tell me more about the trust you disrespected 
I still don't know, why did you hurt the very one 
Why did you hurt the very one 
That you should have protected? 
Heading for the great escape 
Heading for the rave
Heading for the permanent holiday
Heading for the high cloud-nine 
Heaven number seven 
Heading for the long goodbye 
Uncurl the fingers that hold 
Summon the strength to let go 
Out of the tired world 
Out of the upset
Into the sunset
