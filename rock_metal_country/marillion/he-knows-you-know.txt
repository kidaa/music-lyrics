He knows, you know, he knows, you know
Problems, problems, problems, problems
Light switch, yellow fever, crawling up your bathroom wall 
Singing psychedelic praises to the depths of a China bowl
You've got venom in your stomach, you've got poison in your head 
You should have listened to the priest at the confession 
When he offered you the sacred bread
He knows, you know, he knows, you know, he knows, you know
But he's got problems
Fast feed, crystal fever, swarming through a fractured mind 
Chilling needles freeze emotion, the blind shall lead the blind
You've got venom in you stomach, you've got poison in your head 
When your conscience whispered, the vein lines stiffened 
You were walking with the dead
He knows, you know, he knows, you know, he knows, you know 
He's got experience
He's got experience, he knows, you know
But he's got problems
Problems, problems, problems, problems, problems, problems.
He knows... 
Slash wrist, scarlet fever, crawled under your bathroom door
Pumping arteries ooze the problem, through the gap that the razor tore 
You've got venom in your stomach, you've got poison in your head
You should have listened to your analyst questions when yo lay on his leather bed
He knows, you know, he knows, you know, he knows, you know 
But he's got problems
Blank eyes, purple fever, streaming through the frosted pane 
You learned your lesson far to late from the links in a chemist chain 
You've got venom in your stomach, you've got poison in your head 
You should have stayed at home and talked with father
Listen to the lies he fed
He knows, you know, he knows, you know, he knows, you know
But he's got problems 
He knows, you know, he knows, you know, he knows, you know
He's got experience
He's got experience, he knows, you know
He knows, you know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know, you know
Problems, problems, problems, problems, problems, problems
Don't give me your problems
