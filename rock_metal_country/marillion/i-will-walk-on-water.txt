Something is coming out of the rain
Magic, It's happening again
Like the last time 
I don't know how it happens
But I know what to do 
Comin' up from the ground
I think it's you
I will walk on the water
You sent me the red sun and the purple sky 
Cirrus clouds and grins 
Atoms of roses 
The power to do anything
In the chaos of colours
And the fluttering of wings
You carry me up 
And I'm free again
Don't let anyone tell you 
This is impossible 
What we have here is bigger than fear
I will walk on water 
Don't let anyone tell you
This is impossible
Hold on to me
Believe what you see
I will walk on water
