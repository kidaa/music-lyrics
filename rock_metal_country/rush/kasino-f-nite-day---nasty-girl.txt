Nasty
Nasty nasty 
C'mon, uh huh 
You know I like em when they're *nasty* 
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh 

All I ever wanted was a nasty girl 
to make a nigga hot and scream "Don't stop!" when you hit the spot 
Ain't a treat wit me, cos you see me with the Lock 
Ain't gon' leave with me cos you see me in the drop 
Ooh I like that when it takes some game 
justa, get your name, don't you see my chain? 
Got a lotta ice and she like "Yeah that's nice 
You Kasino right?", and I say "Yeah that's right" 
"That was you that I seen on TV last night" 
I say "Yeah", she said "I'm sorry, you ain't my type" 
I want a chick I could holla at, throw a dollar at 
If she wanna come chilly, tell her holla back 
Got the Ac fo' in the lot, tell her follow that 
back to the room, checkout time ain't til noon 
"But I just met you" but it ain't too soon 
Let's play house, you be the wife, I could be the ??? 

Chorus: Nite   Day 

All I ever wanted was a nasty girl 
Someone who can go with the flow with the lights down low, oh 
But she can't be easy, sleasy 
Got to be based with freaky freaky 
*repeat*

Excuse me Miss, you never heard me say I was rich 
I just talk like this and walk like this 
All I ever wanted was a nasty chick 
who gonna strip when I say so, skip when I say go 
Creep when I say no, uhh uhh I ain't think so 
Party just beginnin, I'm thinkin bout it in us 
As I don't drink or smoke, I'm thinkin bout women 
in back of the truck, wit her legs up That's right 
Sittin on 20's and she don't want money 
She knows I'm a freak so she brung a friend for me 
>From around-the-way girls to a Playboy bunny 
Use to be too thin to win but now I'm chubby 
Just like a teddy bear, all the girls love me 
Wanna play wit me, hopin, can't hit me 
If I got enough money maybe she could stay wit me 

Chorus

Tell me the truth, are you waitin after the show? 
Cos you after my doe and an asskissin no 
Let me know, do you want cash from the doe? 
Is it sex or pay cheque you askin me fo'? 
Pretty chick, don't you think that I'm serious? 
I heard a lot about you, ain't you curious? 
How you, shake your hips and you, lick your lips 
Would you, give me a kiss if I give you my chips? 
Ain't that type of girl, let me save you a trip 
What if I was broke, all that I could give you is dick 
I need a girl that's gon' still be, bout it bout it 
No doubt about it, can't live without it 
Sex me in the SC, so well 
she need to ask me how she played, no replay 
Playmate of the month, all she need is a pimp 
I'm like the nastiest nigga since Larry Flynt 

Chorus x2
