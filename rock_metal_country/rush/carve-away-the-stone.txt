You can roll that stone
To the top of the hill
Drag your ball and chain behind you

You can carry that weight 
With an iron will
Or let the pain remain behind you

Chip away the stone
Sisyphus
Chip away the stone
Make the burden lighter
If you must roll that rock alone

You can drive those wheels 
To the end of the road
You will still find the past right behind you
Try to deny 
The weight of the load
Try to put the sins of the past night behind you

Carve away the stone
Sisyhpus
Carve away the stone
Make a graven image
With some features of your own

You call roll the stone
To the top of the hill
You can carry that weight
With an iron will
You can drive those wheels
To the end of the road
You can try to deny
The weight of the load

Roll away the stone
Sisyhpus
Roll away the stone
If you could just move yours
I could get working on my own
