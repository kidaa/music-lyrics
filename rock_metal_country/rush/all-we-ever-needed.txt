A heavy heart I bring
For I am tired Lord
Awaken my lost love for You
Take this heart of stone
And warm this bitter cold
Awaken my lost love for You

Let your children fall down and worship
Fall down and know You
For You are holy
Let Your children rise up before You
Rise and adore You
For You are holy
You are holy

Remind us who we are 
When we have wandered far
Awaken our lost love You
And like the morning star
You chase away the dark
There is no shadow here with You 
With You, Lord

Let Your children fall down and worship
Fall down and know You
For You are holy
Let Your children rise up before You
Rise and adore You
For You are holy

Just a glimpse of You is all we ever needed
Just a touch from You is all we ever needed
Just a glimpse of You is all we ever needed
It's all that we are needing now

Let Your children fall down and worship
Fall down and know You
For You are holy
Let Your children rise up before You
Rise and adore You
For You are holy
