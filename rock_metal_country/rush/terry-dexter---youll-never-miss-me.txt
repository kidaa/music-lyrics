Oh, hey, ooh yeah 

Baby I feel disrespected 
Aren't you playing with my mind, ooh? 
Lately I feel so neglected 
Tell me is it just a waste of my time, ooh 
You're not the same man that I fell in love with 
Cause you used to bring me flowers 
And do that gentle kiss on my head 
When you first met me 
Maybe it's not meant to be 
Cause if you don't show me you love me 
I swear I'm gonna leave 

1 -  You'll never miss me till I'm gone 
     And that's when I'm gonna leave 
     I swear I'm gonna leave 
     And if you don't show me, you love me 
     Baby our love's not meant to be 

Tell me what kind of woman would make sure that you're fed 
Bring your breakfast in bed, beside who? Who? 
I'd made sure the apartment's never dirty 
But when you get home you don't even kiss me, oh yeah 
My friends keep telling me I should leave you alone 
But I just say they don't know you, no, no, no, ooh 
But lately I feel that contradictions and I'm trying 
So what do I do, oh yeah ooh? 

I don't know just what to do 
I don't know just what to do 
Maybe I should just say goodbye to you 

Repeat 1 

You just don't care 
The way you used to 
Cause when it comes to love I'm giving way more than you 
Boy you better listen to what I gotta say 
And show me love 
Or find a girl that's easy to play 

Repeat 1
