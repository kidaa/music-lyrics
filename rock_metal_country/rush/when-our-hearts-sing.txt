You are more than what we can sing
You are God and nothing we bring
Is fit for a King
So, search us and know deep in our souls
We praise You

You are infinite worth
When we've not the words
Our hearts will sing
We are here on the earth
And somehow we 're heard
When our hearts sing to You

You are more than words on our lips
We are poor, with nothing to give
But, we want to bring
More than the song we sing to praise You, we praise You

You are infinite worth
When we've not the words
Our hearts will sing
We are here on the earth
And somehow we 're heard
When our hearts sing to You

It's You we engage
It's You we embrace
When our hearts sing

You are infinite worth
When we've not the words
Our hearts will sing
We are here on the earth
And somehow we 're heard
When our hearts sing to You

You are more than what we can sing
You are God and nothing we bring
