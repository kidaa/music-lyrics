For those who are worn with nothing to bring but empty hands
For those who are weak, for those who can't find the strength to stand

[Chorus:]
Lord we know it's for those You've come
Lord we know it's for those You've given Your Son
Lord we know it's for those who can't come on their own
That You've come, You have come for those

For those who are poor
For those who are broken, those who mourn
For those bound by chains with no way to freedom but for grace
But for grace

[Chorus]

If You are for us, who can be against us
Who can be against Your own 
If You are with us who can separate us
Who can separate Your own

[Chorus]
