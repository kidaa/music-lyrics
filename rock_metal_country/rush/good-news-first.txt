The best we can agree on
Is it could have been worse
What happen to your old
Benevolent universe?
You know the one with stars
That revolve around you
Beaming down full of promises
To bring good news

You used to feel that way
The saddest words you could ever say
But I know you'll remember that day
And the most beautiful words I could ever say

The worst thing about it all
Is that you've never been right
And I'm still not really sure
What started that fight
But I still get this feeling
There's more trouble ahead
So never mind the bad news
Let's have the good news instead

Some would said they never fear a thing
Well I do
And I'm afraid enough for both of us
For me and you
Time, if nothing else, will do it's worst
So do me that favor
And tell me the good news first
