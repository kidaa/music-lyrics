Verse One: 

Nigga no way rap better than, act better, that 
veteran of rap *?ceteran?* 
Brung on, motherfucker sung on, run on 
Come on, go and have fun on, run on 
Immediate considered, no he really ain't 
The main ingredient, comedian, must be obedient 
Reason why the player who away a few, say that too 
cos no one else can talk shit way I do 
School kid, the cool slid 
and I rule wid, still shoot wid my 2, kid 
Ain't no way on Earth to faze Rick, the man plays with wit 
Eras-ed the man amazin the bassin 
Border him, all on ya albums slaughterin 
Better spin like slavery when I order him 
Rejects creep yet keep step 
Every borough, every state, every country in deep check 

Chorus:

Mack all of it, controller shit, catch hold of it 
How you gonna move Slick when cats like solo Rick? 
Accept, yet no chances that they make plans 
to wreck and make a nigga, breakdance the record 
I turned and learned this sequel I burned went 
urgent, mad white people like servin 
Interested with, gets congested with 
clowns, haven't made a record, impress the kid 

Verse Two: 

No entry, let's keep a hood rhymin shit A-party people 
Are you tryin to have yourself a good time or what? 
No stressin you, type of beat bring out the best in you 
Allegeble, ruler came to add a touch of bless onto 
Niggas think they bashin me, his majesty 
of garbage and never were no match for me and actually 
many a girl catch the fever 
and I don't need anyone else rap with either 
If this is based on skill, kill anybody will 
affiliate Rick real to Hicksville 
Same ruler movin cowardness out of this 
Never out powerless, devour this and now it is 
time for one to leave upon impeach 
Help teach all men how to live amongst each KnowI'msayin? 
Although a lotta creep yet keeps 
Every borough, every state, every country in deep check 

Chorus

Verse Three: 

The bounce men, S S sound bend 
Listen up kid, an important announcement 
There's a rapper I know many interested in 
named Rick, no rapper alive could mess with him 
Lace records all audience roar to 
Grand of a show, skill on the dancefloor too 
Freakin awesome, of course I'm married 
High school broads keep your drawers on 
cos this one in perf' case 
Guaranteed to make you break fool at the work place 
Diligent, shout as Mr. Militant 
Allow me to do my thing, it's all brilliant 
Although sometime the reign may slip 
can't skip my part on the hu-man tip 
Ain't shit, you rejects creep yet keep step 
Every borough, every state, every country in deep check 

Chorus
