Just another hunter, like a wolf in the sun
Just another junkie on a scoring run
Just another victim of the things he has done
Just another day -- in the life of a loaded gun

The odds get even; you name the game
The odds get even; the stakes are the same
You bet your life...

Just another winner, pours his life down the drain
Just another island in a hurricane
Just another loser, like a cat in the rain
Just another day -- in the path of a speeding train

The odds get even; you name the game
The odds get even; the stakes are the same
You bet your life...

Just another drunk -- at the wheel of a stolen car

The odds get even; the stakes are the same
You bet your life...
