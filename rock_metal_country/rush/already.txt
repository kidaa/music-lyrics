I try my best to work for Your love
I never rest, hoping You'll want me to 

[Chorus:]
When it's already, it's already, it's already been done
When it's already, it's already, it's already been done

I never stop believing there's more I can do
I just can't resist searching for ways to please You

[Chorus]

There's nothing more there's never less 
It's only You and I am blessed
Well, there's nothing more there's never less
It's only You and I am blessed

[Chorus]
