I'm so far away 
From the only place I know I should be
Find me, take me

[Chorus:]
Come like the day, come chase away this darkness
I've been living here so long and I give up
Come wash away everything I've built between us
And I will sing unending songs of Your love

I cannot find rest
I can't catch my breath from running away
So stop me and take me

[Chorus]

Your love has stolen my heart, Your love has set me apart
Your love is life in my veins and all my mistakes fade away
So find me and stop me, and take me, and save me

[Chorus]
