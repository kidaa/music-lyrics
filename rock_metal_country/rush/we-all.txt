Oh, You are love like we have never known
Before the world was born
You had named us and called us Your own
We are Yours
And we're broken at Your feet

We all, we all, we all fall to the ground
Cause You're right here with us
We all, we all, we all fall to the ground
At the name of Jesus
We all, we all, we all lift up You, now

Oh, it's a wonder that we can engage
The King of Heaven lives
In our hearts and we know Your embrace is this
You have died for us

We all, we all, we all fall to the ground
Cause You're right here with us
We all, we all, we all fall to the ground
At the name of Jesus
We all, we all, we all lift up You, now

Your ways are high
They're not our own
And You are seated at Your throne
And it's Your love that gives us hope
That You will never let us go [REPEAT]

We all, we all, we all fall to the ground

We all, we all, we all fall to the ground
Cause You're right here with us
We all, we all, we all fall to the ground
At the name of Jesus
We all, we all, we all lift up You, now

Oh, you are love like we have never known
Before the world was born
You had named us and called us your own
We are yours
