Well, I'm lookin' at you,
And I'm wond'rin' what you're gonna do.
Looks like you got no friends,
No one to stick with you till the end.

Chorus
Take yourself a friend.
Keep 'em till the end.
Whether woman or man,
It makes you feel so good...
So good!

Yes, you think you're all right,
But now you're lonely ev'ry night.
Well, you need a friend,
Someone on whom you can always depend.

Chorus

Yes, you need some advice,
Well, let me put it to you nice.
I said you need a friend,
Someone who'll stick with you to the end.

Chorus
