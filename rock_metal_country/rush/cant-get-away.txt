I am an arrow, I am a rocket
I am a river and nothing can stop it
Cause You are the target and You are the atmosphere
You are the ocean that keeps pulling me, You're pulling me here

[Chorus:]
And I, can't get away, can't get away
Can't get away, can't get away
I can't get away, can't get away...I keep running into You
[repeat]

I am a beggar, You are the table
I am so helpless, God You are so able
And when I get turned around You change my direction
You're so perfect, I'm so broken, here You come with arms wide open 
Chasing after me down every road
You're always waiting there

[Chorus]

Even when I close my eyes, I can't help but see 
There's no place that I can hide, You're such a part of me
I can't get away cause I keep running into You
I can't get away...

[Chorus]
