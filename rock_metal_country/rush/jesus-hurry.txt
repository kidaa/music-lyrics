There is no lovelier sound
To be lost then to be found 
Even more than we do now, we will rejoice
[repeat]

[Chorus:]
Jesus, hurry come back for us we cannot wait
Jesus, hurry come back, we cannot wait, we cannot wait
[repeat]

We will sing, we will dance to songs about all that You do 
Evermore to be with You is all we want
[repeat]

[Chorus]

Until at last, we see Your face and behold Your glory
Until at last, we see Your face 
We want to see all Your glory, all Your glory

Jesus, hurry come back, hurry come back Lord.. 
I can't wait till You come back for me...

[Chorus]
