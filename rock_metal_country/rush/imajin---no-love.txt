I wanna love you baby repeat 

Chorus:
No love is a real love without you 
No love is a real love without you baby 

Verse 1: 
They say we're too young 
to fall in love 
girl I need your touch 
I just can't get enough 
so hold me, slowly 
no matter what they say 
I was meant for you and you were meant for me 

Chorus:
No love is a real love without you 
No love is a real love without you baby 

Verse 2: 
I never had love to be so true 
I'm so into you 
baby it's everything you do 
I'm losing control 
can't let you go 
baby you should know 
you're everything I need and more 

Chorus:
No love is a real love without you 
No love is a real love without you baby 
I wanna love you baby repeat 

Verse 3: 
Love without you don't mean a thing 
In me you brought a change and my life is not the same 
So don't you go away girl please stay 
I need you by my side 
Now that I realize that
