Sit down honey gotta have us a talk
You man is a little upset
There's a couple of things that's been missing
And I ain't found 'em yet
I ain't pointing no fingers ain't layin?no blame
And I don't wanna lose my cool
But you just don't fool with a country boy's tool
Tool box
Now did I hear you right you loaned 'em out
To the neighbor down the road
Hey I'd just as soon you'd let him have my ole bird dog
Or my favorite fishing pole
Now there's one little lesson that you need to learn
You just don't fool with a country boy's tool
Tool box
It was handed down from my daddy's dad
Back in nineteen forty-two
And they may be rusty and they might be old
But they're kinda like my family jewels
Honey I love you but there's something else too
That I care about a heck of a lot
Oh you just don't fool with a country boy's tool
Tool box
Now I don't wanna hurt your tender heart
And I really do understand
That a friend in need is a friend indeed
And you offered a helping hand
But it something gets broke and it's gotta be fixed
Well I don't blame you know who
'Cause you just don't fool with a country boy's tool
Tool box
It was handed down from my daddy's dad
Back in nineteen forty-two
And they may be rusty and they might be old
But they're kinda like my family jewels
Honey I love you but there's something else too
That I care about a heck of a lot
Oh you just don't fool with a country boy's tool
Tool box
