I've had my back against the wall more times than I can count
Seems I was running into trouble every time I turned around
But now my luck is changing, I've run into a dream come true
I've never been up against anything quite like you
There have been tight situations but baby this is close
You're so soft to touch and you're so easy to hold
For the first time in my life I feel like I just can't lose
And I've never been up against anything quite like you
When the odds are against me I just laugh it off
'Cause nothing is as tough as this love I've come across
When we met head on, you really changed my point of view
I've never been up against anything quite like you
There have been tight situations but baby this is close
You're so soft to touch and you're so easy to hold
For the first time in my life I feel like I just can't lose
And I've never been up against anything quite like you
No, I've never been up against anything quite like you
