Aaron Tippin/Jim McBride
If you're lost and you're alone 
Let me sing you a song 
Oh, you're not the only lonely one tonight 
I know what you're goin' through 
I can sympathize with you 
I've been wakin' in your shoes all my life 
I was born with a broken heart 
Born to lose right from the start 
Raised on hand-me-down blues 
That's why I sing the way I do 
A sad six string and a jukebox voice 
I'm the lonely people's choice 
I was made to play the part 
I was born with a broken heart 
If the sun should ever shine in your life 
Well, friend, that's fine 
And may you leave behind these old troubled times that we've shared 
Oh, but don't look back for me 
I'm where I'm supposed to be 
And anywhere there's a lonely street I'll be there 
I was born with a broken heart 
Born to lose right from the start 
Raised on hand-me-down blues 
That's why I sing the way I do 
A sad six string and a jukebox voice 
I'm the lonely people's choice 
I was made to play the part 
I was born with a broken heart 
Yes, I was made to play the part 
I was born with a broken heart
