Aaron Tippin/Michael P. Heeney
Her last lonely teardrop fell
Along about nine o'clock
His memory was history
Before she hit the parking lot
She busted through them swingin?doors
Sashaying to and fro
She's got a new attitude yes she's over that dude
And she wants the world to know that
Oh yes She feels like a brand new man tonight
She didn't come in here to hang her head and cry
She's through throwing good love away
On some boy that don't treat her right
She feels like a brand new man tonight
Just like a kid in a candy store
She's checking out the merchandise
But she wants to find the keeping kind
Who will keep her satisfied
And he's gotta be strong gotta be tough
And he's gotta have a tender touch
So if you fit the bill brother don't sit still
Come on step right up 'cause
Oh yes She feels like a brand new man tonight
She didn't come in here to hang her head and cry
She's through throwing good love away
On some boy that don't treat her right
She feels like a brand new man tonight
Oh yes She feels like a brand new man tonight
She didn't come in here to hang her head and cry
She's through throwing good love away
On some boy that don't treat her right
She feels like a brand new man tonight
I said she feels like a brand new man tonight
