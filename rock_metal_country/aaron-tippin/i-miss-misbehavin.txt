I used to smoke and stay out late 
Sometimes I drank more that I ate 
I used to think, man, I was bad 
Why, I'd fight at the drop of a hat 
I took a walk on the wild side 
I guess I'm lucky that I survived 
I had some days I can't forget 
And sometimes at night I think about 'em yet 
I miss misbehavin' 
Yeah, I miss misbehavin' 
I've settled down now 
But sometimes I miss misbehavin' 
There was a girl I do recall 
She was as tough as she was tall 
We used to dance to every song 
Lord, we held each other all night long 
She used to call me her honey baby 
I called her my Miss Misbehavin' 
I wonder if she's still around 
And if she's out there misbehavin' now 
I miss misbehavin' 
Yeah, I miss misbehavin' 
I've settled down now 
But sometimes I miss misbehavin' 
Yeah, I've settled down now 
But sometimes I miss misbehavin'
