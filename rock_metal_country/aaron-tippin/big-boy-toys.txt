I'd hook my wagon to my trike and I'd head across the yard 
To my big sandbox where I worked real hard 
Playing all day with my little toy trucks 
Backhoes, bulldozers, earth-moving stuff 
That was my whole life when I was a kid 
But when I grew up, I guess I never really did - I like 
Chorus: 
Big boy toys, motors and lights 
Knobs and switches and four-wheel-drive 
Running up the road or crawling across the farm 
And when they broke down, I jack them up in the yard 
Pull out my tools, my pride and joy 
Man, you gotta love them big boy toys 
Now, sometimes baby just can't understand 
The mud on my boots and the grease on my hands 
I try to explain how it makes me feel 
The awesome power of my hands on the wheel 
If I can't find the words to set things right 
I just scoot over and I lt my baby drive - she likes 
Chorus 
Yeah, its boats and cars, tractors and trucks 
Gasoline and diesel fuel running through my blood - 
I like them 
Chorus 
Man, you gotta live them big boy toys
