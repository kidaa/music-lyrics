I've built a million raving beauties out of pure make-believe
Hopin?my imagination might run away with me
Thought I'd pictured every vision that a man could dream about
Till you walked through those swinging doors
And stepped down off that cloud
What's an angel like you doing in my wildest dreams
A walkin? talkin? lovin?fantasy
Did you come here tonight just to rescue me
What's an angel like you doing in my wildest dreams
I thought I'd died and went to heaven when you sat down next to me
Lord, and I said to myself this is too good to believe
You look like you belong in a Sunday school choir
Instead of in this honky tonk settin?me on fire
What's an angel like you doing in my wildest dreams
A walkin? talkin? lovin?fantasy
Did you come here tonight just to rescue me
What's an angel like you doing in my wildest dreams
Are you just wishful thinkin? a figment of my mind
I'll worry about that tomorrow, right now it's closing time
What's an angel like you doing in my wildest dreams
A walkin? talkin? lovin?fantasy
Did you come here tonight just to rescue me
What's an angel like you doing in my wildest dreams
