Aaron Tippin/Buddy Brock
When I look back on this life and all the things that I have done 
Lord, I've paid some pretty prices for never backing up 
But now that I've had time alone and I've been through every page 
There's only one part of my story that I wish that I could change 
If I had it to do over and I knew then what I know now 
I'd do anything I had to, to keep you from walkin' out 
Your love would be the only reason for anything that I'd undo 
Yes, if I had it to do over, I'd do it over you 
There are bridges I have burned and there are promises I've made 
And the ones that I have broken I'll have to carry to my grave 
And when I stand before the throne and answer for my every deed 
The only one that I'll regret is what I've done to you and me 
If I had it to do over and I knew then what I know now 
I'd do anything I had to, to keep you from walkin' out 
Your love would be the only reason for anything that I'd undo 
Yes, if I had it to do over, I'd do it over you 
Yes, if I had it to do over, I'd do it over you
