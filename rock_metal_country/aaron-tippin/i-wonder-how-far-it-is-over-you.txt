I parked my car beside the highway and I didn't lock the doors
Left a note there with the keys if it cranks, well friend, she's yours
And I struck out across Texas, gonna walk it line to line
Now I'm halfway cross New Mexico, but you're still on my mind
And this road that's going nowhere just leads me on and on
As I ask myself with every step will I ever be alone
I wonder just how far it is over you
Is there no place I go that you don't come too
When I left Tennessee, I thought we were through
Now I wonder how far it is over you
I was deep in California when I finally made a friend
And it was me and that old hobo till you showed up again
Then he ran out of liquor and I've run out of time
I'm standing by the ocean, but you're still on my mind
And I'm staring at the water so blue and deep and wide
Bet a man could lose a memory over on the other side
I wonder just how far it is over you
Is there no place I go that you don't come too
When I left Tennessee, I thought we were through
Now I wonder how far it is over you
I parked my car beside the highway and I didn't lock the doors
Left a note there with the keys if it cranks, well friend, she's yours
