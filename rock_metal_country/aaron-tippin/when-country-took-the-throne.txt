Aaron Tippin/Buddy Brock
Just a skinny little Mississippi railroad man 
That loved to sing and play 
He brought his music from the cotton fields 
To the the hillbilly hall of fame 
Thank God for Jimmie Rodgers 
Chisel his name in the cornerstone 
I just wish he could've lived to see the day 
When country took the throne 
Now a million songs have come and gone 
Since we made that humble start 
About neon nights, everyday life 
Love and broken hearts 
And more and more folks 
Kept tuning in and turning on 
Now I can proudly say that I saw the day 
When country took the throne 
Now from Carolina to California, Texas to New York 
They can't get enough of this country stuff 
And they're screaming for more 
We painted the town with that grand old sound 
And the whole world sang along 
Yes, I was there the day 
When country took the throne 
Now, no one knows what the future holds 
But I bet my best guitar 
There'll be a jukebox jumping on Jupiter 
And a honky-tonk on Mars 
In the last frontier they'll stand and cheer 
The best music ever known 
They'll celebrate that age old day 
When country took the throne 
Now from Carolina to California, Texas to New York 
They can't get enough of this country stuff 
And they're screaming for more 
We painted the town with that grand old sound 
And the whole world sang along 
Yes, I was there the day 
When country took the throne 
I said I was there the day 
When country took the throne
