Girl, I've got scars and I've seen stars 
From men nearly twice my size 
Yeah, life's sticks and stones have broke a few bones 
But I've always survived 
So when I take a look at all I've took 
It don't seem right to me 
How a little bitty woman with just a few words 
Come bring me to my knees 
Sticks and stones wouldn't hurt a bit 
Compared to the cold, cruel words that just leave your lips 
I'd rather you pick up a rock, a stick full of thorns 
Rear back and let 'em fly 
'Cause those sticks wouldn't cut, stones hurt as much 
As the sound of your goodbye 
Yeah, I know I'm the reason you're leavin' 
I'm to blame sure enough 
It's like you say there ain't a woman made 
That can live without true love 
So if it's too late to set things straight 
And there's no forgivin' me 
Then don't say nothin,' just pick you up somethin' 
That'll end this misery. 
Sticks and stones wouldn't hurt a bit 
Compared to the cold, cruel words that just leave your lips 
I'd rather you pick up a rock, a stick full of thorns 
Rear back and let 'em fly 
'Cause those sticks wouldn't cut, stones hurt as much 
As the sound of your goodbye
