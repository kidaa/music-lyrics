It's not my style to dance away the night 
Or go for a walk beneath the full moonlight 
And I don't wish on falling stars 
Or easily give away my heart 
But girl, for you I will 
Can't hide this love that I feel 
Never been the kind of guy 
To fall in head over heels 
But girl, for you I will 
It's not like me at all to talk about 
The likelihood of finally settling down 
Couldn't speak the words ";I love you"; 
Or find the courage to say ";I do"; 
But girl, for you I will 
Can't hide this love that I feel 
Never been the kind of guy 
To fall in head over heels 
But girl, for you I will 
I've never been the kind of guy 
To fall in head over heels 
But girl, for you I will
