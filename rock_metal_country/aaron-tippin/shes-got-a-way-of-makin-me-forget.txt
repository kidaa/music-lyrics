She said when she found me I was barely hanging on
To the memory of a love that had been long gone
There must have been somebody else I don't remember who it is
'Cause she's got a way of makin' me forget
When she takes me in her arms I get lost in time
She takes complete control of my heart and my mind
I'm not haunted by the past old memories or regrets
Oh she's got a way of makin' me forget
She's taught me that tomorrow is a reason to live
Don't blame and accuse just love and forgive
Now every grudge I ever had no longer exists
'Cause she's got a way of makin' me forget
When she takes me in her arms I get lost in time
She takes complete control of my heart and my mind
I'm not haunted by the past old memories or regrets
Oh she's got a way of makin' me forget
Oh she's got a way of makin' me forget
She said when she found me I was barely hanging on
To the memory of a love that had been long gone
There must have been somebody else I don't remember who it is
'Cause she's got a way of makin' me forget
Oh she's got a way of makin' me forget
