Maybe we'll never be seen together
At night on a crowded street
I may never reach across your body
And kill the light when you're asleep
Maybe I'll never watch you dressing
Or sound too familiar on the phone
But I can touch your hand that's against me
And take that moment home
That's as close as I'll get to loving you
Even though there's nothing else I'd rather do
I can dream, I can hope, I can see but still I know
That's as close as I'll get to loving you
I won't be there when you need holding
But I'm sure that he can pull you through
But I can sing this song to everybody
And pretend it's not about you
That's as close as I'll get to loving you
Even though there's nothing else I'd rather do
I can dream, I can hope, I can see but still I know
That's as close as I'll get to loving you
That's as close as I'll get to loving you
Even though there's nothing else I'd rather do
I can dream, I can hope, I can see but still I know
That's as close as I'll get to loving you
That's as close as I'll get to
Yeah that's as close as I'll get to
That's as close as I'll get to loving you
