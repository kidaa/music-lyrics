Somewhere out there in the smoky air 
Where the night is neon blue 
Surrounded by strangers, she don't know the dangers 
One drink could lead her to 
And if she falls, it's all my fault 
For doin' a good woman wrong 
I can't be far behind her 
Oh, Lord, help me find her 
Before my angel is gone 
Looking for my blue angel 
The same one that flew from my arms last night 
If you see my blue angel 
Tell her that heaven without her feels like hell tonight 
Last night when she left I told myself 
That she wouldn't go too far 
Now I'm not so sure how long her tears 
Could last in a stranger's arms 
She's wounded I know and feeling so low 
She could fall at anytime 
I don't know what I'd do if I were to lose 
That precious angel of mine 
Looking for my blue angel 
The same one that flew from my arms last night 
If you see my blue angel 
Tell her that heaven without her feels like hell tonight 
Yes, tell her heaven without her feels like hell tonight
