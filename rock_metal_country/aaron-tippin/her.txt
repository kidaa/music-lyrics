What makes me get up every mornin' 
When I can't find the will 
And what keeps me goin' through the motions 
When all my dreams are standing still 
Why do I try so hard 
How did I get this far 
What is the bottom line each and every time 
I do it for her 
It's all about her 
God knows she gives me more than I deserve 
Every thought I think 
Every breath I breathe 
Everything that I hold dear to me 
Revolves around one simple little word 
Her 
There's times I take it all for granted 
Just how fortunate I am 
God knows it took a better woman, to make me a better man 
Oh, sometimes it don't show 
Don't always let her know 
What I couldn't live without 
I know there ain't a doubt 
I do it for her 
It's all about her 
God knows she gives me more than I deserve 
Every thought I think 
Every breath I breathe 
Everything that I hold dear to me 
Revolves around one simple little word 
Her 
She's my life's work 
And for all that it's worth 
I do it for her 
It's all about her 
Oh God knows she gives me more than I deserve 
Every thought I think 
Every breath I breathe 
Everything that I hold dear to me 
Revolves around one simple little word 
Her 
Talkin' about her.
