Aaron Tippin/Donny Kees
You are the woman
Who started a fire in my soul
And to this day it's still burning out of control
With my final breath your name will cross my tongue
You are the woman there'll never be another one
I've stared into the eyes of strangers
Wondering if I'd ever find you girl
The one that I could build my dreams around
To fill my empty world
And now I look at you and know it's true
My search is finally done
This love that I've held on to for so long
Was meant for only one
You are the woman beautiful woman
God only knows just why you chose to love only me
You are the woman oh precious woman
Right her and now I give this vow
There'll never be another one
Right here and now I give this vow
Oh there'll never be another one
