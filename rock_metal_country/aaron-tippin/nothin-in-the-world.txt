Well, I've moaned the blues since she slammed that door 
Drank and cried and I walked the floor 
And her memory's backed me against the wall 
So tonight I'm gonna end it all 
You can say goodbye to this lonely guy 
Nothin' in the world can save me but a girl 
Help me, help me, I'm about to die 
There's a lovesick man on the prowl tonight 
Don't call the doctor, don't call the law 
When a good lovin' woman can fix it all 
I gotta have another she to rescue me 
Nothin' in the world can save me but a girl 
Well, I know y'all think that I've gone mad 
I'm out huntin' me one like I just had 
It's like grabbin' a hold of a high line wire 
Or jumpin' out of the pan straight into the fire 
Oh, but only a man can understand 
Nothin' in the world can save me but a girl 
Help me, help me, I'm about to die 
There's a lovesick man on the prowl tonight 
Don't call the doctor, don't call the law 
When a good lovin' woman can fix it all 
I gotta have another she to rescue me 
Nothin' in the world can save me but a girl
