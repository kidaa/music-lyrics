You reach out and touch me and tell me you love me 
And promise that you always will 
But as I start to kiss your tender lips 
I wake up to my living hell 
These sweet dreams are killin' me 
Your heavenly memory is pure misery 
I'm losing my mind one night as a time 
These sweet dreams are killin' me 
When sleep comes I hold you just like I used to 
In a world where our love still lives 
But each mornin' I wake as I feel my heart break 
When I lose you all over again 
These sweet dreams are killin' me 
Your heavenly memory is pure misery 
I'm losing my mind one night as a time 
These sweet dreams are killin' me 
These sweet dreams are killin' me 
These sweet dreams are killin' me
