Aaron Tippin/Thea Tippin/Philip Douglas
She was a woman on a mission
Here to drown a man for leavin
So I set her up again to watch him drown
She had just about succeeded
When that low down no goodcheater
Good for nothing came struttin' through the crown
Oh he was layin' it on so thick
He never missed a lick
Professing his never ending love
Oh but I never will forget, when she stood up and said
Well I guess you think we're just goinna kiss and makeup don't ya
That's when she said
Why don't you kiss...kiss this
And I don't mean on my rosy red lips
Me and You, oh we are through
And there's only one thing left for you to do
You just come on over here one last time
Pucker up and close your eyes, and kiss this...good bye
Well the next thing I recall
She had him back against the wall
Chewing him like a bulldog on a bone
She was putting him in his place
And I mean right up in his face
Draggin' him down a list of done me wrongs
It was just about now that the crowd gathered round
They came to watch him pay for his every sin
She called him everything under the sun
And when we thought that she was done
She ran back and she let him have it again
She said...she said
Why don't you kiss...kiss this
And I don't mean on my rosy red lips
Me and You, oh we are through
And there's only one thing left for you to do
You just come on over here one last time
Pucker up and close your eyes, and kiss this...good bye
Kiss this
And I don't mean on my rosy red lips
Me and You, oh we are through
And there's only one thing left for you to do
You just come on over here one last time
Pucker up and close your eyes, and kiss this...good bye
Kiss this
