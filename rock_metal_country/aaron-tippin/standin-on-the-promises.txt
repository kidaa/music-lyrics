Aaron Tippin/Philip Douglas
A million reasons why I could
But only one why I won't
'Cause the one who'd probably never know
Is the reason that I don't
I can't say that I'm not tempted
I'm just like any other man
But when I walk out of here alone woman
I hope you understand
She's standin?on the promises
That she gave to me
So I'm standin?on the promises
I promised her I'd keep
It'd be so easy for anyone
To justify the wrong
Fall right into your arms
And say to hell with being strong
But there's one thing I know for sure
She'd never play this kind of game
And for her faith in out love
I'll do her the same 'cause
She's standin?on the promises
That she gave to me
So I'm standin?on the promises
I promised her I'd keep
Yes she's standin?on the promises
That she gave to me
So I'm standin?on the promises
I promised her I'd keep
