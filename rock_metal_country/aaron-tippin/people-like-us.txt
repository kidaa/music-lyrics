There's a pool hall juke box, sawdust floors
Three plays for a quarter, and we still want more
Yeah there's a reason for fast cars
And that double yellow line
Heartbreak songs and good cheap two dollar wine
'Cause of people like us
There's honky tonk music, long neck bottles
Rusty old pickup trucks
Oh at last call the lights go up
And its all because of people like us
I got a second hand boat, the last numbers in jail
There's second hand smoke, everywhere i exhale
There's greasy little truckstops, all night di
No-tell Motel's and everybody knows why
'Cause of people like us
There's honky tonk music, long neck bottles
Rusty old pickup trucks
Oh at last call the lights go up
And its all because of people like us
'Cause of people like us
There's honkey tonk music, long neck bottles
Rusty old pickup trucks
Oh at last call the lights go up
'Cause of people ... people like us
There's honkey tonk music, long neck bottles
Rusty old pickup trucks
And at last call the lights go up
And its all because of people like us
Late night people like us
Hard lovin people like us
Hahah, just fun lovin people like us
Hillbilly people like us!
