I ain't told nobody 'bout the trouble I've got on me
I keep my tears to myself so no one in the world can see
No I ain't let on the truth to a living soul
So how's the radio know 
How's the radio know she left
How's the radio know I did her wrong
Every record that DJ spins
Is a good-love-gone-bad song
How's the radio know I miss her
And I'd die to tell her so
Oh, how's the radio know 
They played one about a fool chocked up with regret
And then one about a woman that a man won't ever forget
Yeah, back-to-back heartbreakers in a row
How's the radio know 
How's the radio know she left
How's the radio know I did her wrong
Every record that DJ spins
Is a good-love-gone-bad song
How's the radio know I miss her
And I'd die to tell her so
Oh, how's the radio know
