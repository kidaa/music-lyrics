Aaron Tippin/Butch Curry
I've walked the straight and narrow and I've worn a rebel's brand 
Sometimes I've had to go without for bein' my own man 
I've rallied to the cause when I knew the cause was right 
I've cut against the grain, but I've kept my peace of mind 
And I wouldn't have it any other way 
If there's a price for bein' me, that's one I'll have to pay 
I'll take the good and bear the bad until my dyin' day 
I wouldn't have it any other way 
Oh, I wouldn't have it any other way 
I could have taken a beaten path every time trouble starts 
I'd rather take a beatin' than to ever cross my heart 
Stickin' to my guns, can't be sold or bought 
Holdin' to my honor no matter what the cost 
And I wouldn't have it any other way 
If there's a price for bein' me, that's one I'll have to pay 
I'll take the good and bear the bad until my dyin' day 
I wouldn't have it any other way 
Oh, I wouldn't have it any other way 
I wouldn't have it any other way
