It's taken me some time to read the writing on the wall
But I have finaly figured out just what's been going on
And I need to tell you what I've learned before you turn to go
There's things about that other man I think you should know
The man that came between us was looking out for number one
He didn't care how bad he hurt you by the selfish things he'd done
But looking in the mirror, today, I finally came to see
That man that came between us was me
I know I'm sorry don't make up for half the tears you've cried
And I can't promise miracles but I swear to God I'll try
'Cause if you'll give me half a chance I'll love you like I should
Honey, your lovin' man's come home again
And that stranger's gone for good
The man that came between us was looking out for number one
He didn't care how bad he hurt you by the selfish things he'd done
But looking in the mirror, today, I finally came to seed
That man that came between us was me
Oh honey, the man that came between us was me
