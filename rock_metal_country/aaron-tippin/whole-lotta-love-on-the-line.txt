I've called from every run down phone booth in Atlanta, Georgia
Tryin' to find someone to tell me where you'd gone
I begged and pleaded with your mama 'til she gave me this number
Honey, we can work it out
Just come back home
'Cause there's a whole lotta love on the line
And all I need is a chance to change your mind
Don't hang up the phone, 'cause everything's not gone
Think about it, baby
There's a whole lotta love on the line
All this distance that's come between us has gone far enough
And now I know that closer to you is where I belong
And that feelin' I'm feelin' inside is what I'm tryin' to send through these wires
Oh, darling who cares
Who's right or who's wrong
'Cause there's a whole lotta love on the line
And all I need is a chance to change your mind
Don't hang up the phone, 'cause everything's not gone
Think about it, baby
There's a whole lotta love on the line
