Aaron Tippin/Buddy Brock
It was a quarter till three on the day that we met
Exactly nine o' five on the night that she left
Well I tried my best but I still can't forget
How good she used to be
And it's just too bad I've got a good memory
Good memories are hard to leave behind
I've got a bushel basket of 'em running through my mind
I still love her but she don't love me
And it's just too bad I've got a good memory
Lord, it's just too bad I've got a good memory
She had a front page smile and a watch-me walk
Left a love light burning that I can't turn off
Her first impression left a lasting thought
That keeps coming back to me
And it's just too bad I've got a good memory
Good memories are hard to leave behind
I've got a bushel basket of 'em running through my mind
I still love her but she don't love me
And it's just too bad I've got a good memory
Lord, it's just too bad I've got a good memory
And it's just too bad I've got a good memory
Lord, it's just too bad I've got a good memory
