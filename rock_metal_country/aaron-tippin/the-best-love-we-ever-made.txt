Aaron Tippin/Thea Tippin
The first time we went all the way
I can truly say it was way beyond my wildest dreams
And I never can forget that day
We spent tangled up in satin sheets
And I never thought we'd top the time that you and I
Oh, baby that was so sweet
Even though that was incredible now I know
The best was yet to be.
The best love we ever made
Kept us up all night
And it's still growing every day
Right before our very eyes
And we're so amazed we could create
Such a priceless work of art
Oh, the best love we ever made
Is the precious child of ours
The first time our baby cried
I knew our lives were never gonna be the same
In the heart of me, a part of me
Opened up a new kind of love I can't explain
Now all this time I thought
That I was living life for you and me alone
Oh, but holding this miracle
Now I know that I was wrong
The best love we ever made
Kept us up all night
And it's still growing every day
Right before our very eyes
And we're so amazed we could create
Such a priceless work of art
Oh, the best love we ever made
Is the precious child of ours
Oh, the best love we ever made
Is this precious child of ours
