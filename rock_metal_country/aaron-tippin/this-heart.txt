Aaron Tippin/Donny Kees
God gave me the will to survive, a good strong back and a mind 
And all the tough stuff it takes to fill a man's shoes 
Then God put this heart in me for you 
It pushes the blood through my veins 
To swing this nine pound hammer one more day 
But there's only one reason why it beats so true 
God put this heart in me for you 
This heart really don't belong to me 
This heart will be yours eternally 
The man upstairs put it there 'cause 
He knows what to do 
I'd be nothin' but flesh, blood and bones 
If I had to walk through this world alone 
Just a ramblin' fool, a blind, stubborn brute 
Without this heart in me for you 
This heart really don't belong to me 
This heart will be yours eternally 
The man upstairs put it there 'cause 
He knows what to do 
God put this in my for you 
Yes, God put this heart in me for you
