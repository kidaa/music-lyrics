As we passed in the hall 
She said we need to talk 
I can't go on like this another day 
I froze in my tracks 
And a chill ran up my back 
'Cause I knew what she was gonna say 
She said there's someone else 
And I've kept it to myself 
But I can't keep these feelings locked inside 
I need to tell you this 
It's one of your old friends 
One you haven't talked to in a while 
She said I'm leaving 
And there's nothing you can do 
I said I had a feeling you found somebody new 
And I'll bet I can guess his name 
But it's so hard to believe 
'Cause she said you're not even close 
It's someone you don't know 
I'm leaving you for me 
I just stood there at a loss for words 
Tryin' to catch my breath 
'Cause I knew that it was over when 
She said I'm leaving 
And there's nothing you can do 
I said I had a feeling that you found somebody new 
And I'll bet I can guess his name 
But it's so hard to believe 
Oh she said you're not even close 
It's someone you don't know 
I'm leaving you for me 
She said you're not even close 
It's someone you don't know 
I'm leaving you for me.
