Well, down at the factory, I'm never late 
I'm a mild mannered man who pulls his weight 
I give a hundred percent, I don't ever stop 
'Til Friday evening when I punch that clock 
Then I disappear until the weekend's through 
And you'll never guess who I turn into 
I'm a honky-tonk superman 
Ready or not, I'm back again 
Dancing on the tables 
And swinging from the chandeliers 
I'm a honky-tonk superman 
That's who I really am 
A real rebel, dare-devil 
Honky-tonkin' superman 
Everybody's waiting for my next move 
Last night I broke the record for acting a fool 
My favorite waitress said I went a little too far 
When I came roller skating down the top of the bar 
Now, don't blame me for just having fun 
The never should have bet me that it couldn't be done 
'Cause 
I'm a honky-tonk superman 
Ready or not, I'm back again 
Dancing on the tables 
And swinging from the chandeliers 
I'm a honky-tonk superman 
That's who I really am 
A real rebel, dare-devil 
Honky-tonkin' superman 
Hey, look up there on the neon sign 
It's a bird, it's a plane, Lord, he's lost his mind 
Oh, it's just honky-tonk superman 
Ready or not, I'm back again 
Dancing on the tables 
And swinging from the chandeliers 
Whoa, yeah, I'm a honky-tonk superman 
Yeah, that's who I really am 
A real rebel, dare-devil, honky-tonkin' superman 
Yeah, sure enough, real tough, honky-tonk superman
