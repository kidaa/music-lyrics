I wanna be loved by you bayou baby
Nobody else but you bayou baby
I searched this world from end to end
I finally found where I should've always been
Right by you bayou baby
I followed the wind from town to town
Never had a mind of settling down
Falling in love just wasn't my style
But that was before I saw your smile
I wanna be loved by you bayou baby
Nobody else but you bayou baby
I searched this world from end to end
I finally found where I should've always been
Right by you bayou baby
Gonna make my mark stake my claim
Live right here 'til my dying day
Close as I can to wherever you are
'Til the day comes I win your heart
I wanna be loved by you bayou baby
Nobody else but you bayou baby
I searched this world from end to end
I finally found where I should've always been
Right by you bayou baby
I wanna be loved by you bayou baby
Nobody else but you bayou baby
I searched this world from end to end
I finally found where I should've always been
Right by you bayou baby
I wanna be loved by you bayou baby
Nobody else but you bayou baby
I searched this world from end to end
I finally found where I should've always been
Right by you bayou baby
Talkin?'bout right by you bayou baby
Right up against you girl, bayou baby
