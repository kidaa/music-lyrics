She's been staring out the window four nights in a row 
Like a caged up tiger, she's pacing the floor 
And she just can't resist when she feels the pull 
She's got a restless spirit that she can't control 
And when she gets like this, I gotta let her go 
She hears the call of the wild every once in a while 
She lets down her hair, she's gotta get somewhere 
She can turn it loose and howl 
I know what's in store, Katie bar the door 
When she winks at me and smiles 
She's in a foot stompin,' honky-tonkin' 
Love making state of mind 
So excuse me, y'all, I gotta answer the call of the wild 
If there's ever been a lady, well, baby is 
Just more of a woman at times like this 
Now, don't you worry about baby stepping out of line 
Yeah, she drives me crazy, but it suits me fine 
She's hard to handle, so I hold on tight 
And Lord knows I got my hands full tonight 
She hears the call of the wild every once in a while 
She lets down her hair, she's gotta get somewhere 
She can turn it loose and howl 
I know what's in store, Katie bar the door 
When she winks at me and smiles 
She's in a foot stompin,' honky-tonkin' 
Love making state of mind 
So excuse me, y'all, I gotta answer the call of the wild 
I said pardon me, y'all, I gotta answer the call of the wild
