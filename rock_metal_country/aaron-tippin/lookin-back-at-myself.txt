Aaron Tippin/Leigh Reynolds
I put down my razor
Toweled off my face
Thought I saw a new wrinkle
And another strand of gray
That one little scar
Kept catching my eye
Reminding me how time does fly
I was only a kid
When I had that first fight
But I still don't give in
When I believe that I'm right
And at least I can stand here
And like what I see
In the man that kid turned out to be
Lookin?back at myself
It's plain to see
That the cold hands of time
Ain't had much mercy on me
But I played a straight game
With the cards that were dealt
And I can look straight ahead
Lookin?back at myself
Now I ain't been no angel
But I learned right from wrong
Thanks to mamma and a hickory
And a love so strong
Yes she taught the rule
That life is lived by
I ain't forgot what you get
For getting?out of line
Now this old world throws some punches
And I've taken a few
Now my skin's tough as leather
But I've grown strong with the truth
There's been so many times I could've just stepped aside
Ah but then I couldn't stand here with this peace of mind
Lookin?back at myself
It's plain to see
That the cold hands of time
Ain't had much mercy on me
But I played a straight game
With the cards that were dealt
And I can look straight ahead
Lookin?back at myself
Still look straight ahead
Lookin?back at myself
