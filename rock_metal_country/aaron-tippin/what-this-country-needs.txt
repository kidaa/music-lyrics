If I was runnin' this country 
I'd start it over from scratch 
Keep what's good, pile up what's bad 
And then I'd strike the match 
Yeah, we'd go back to the basics 
Of how things ought to be 
Yeah, there'd be a lot of changes 
If it was left up to me 
'Cause what this country needs 
Is a little more steel guitar 
And put a litte fiddle right in the middle 
Straight out of a Texas bar 
And give us a song, we can all sing along 
From sea to shining sea 
Be proud of it and always love it 
That's what this country needs 
Now if you want to hear about livin' 
Just twist that radio dial 
'Til you come to a singer singin' 
What life is all about 
'Cause you can't deny that people still cry 
They laugh and they smile and they hurt 
And that's my humble opinion y'all 
You can take it for what it's worth 
'Cause what this country needs 
Is a little more steel guitar 
And put a litte fiddle right in the middle 
Straight out of a Texas bar 
And give us a song, we can all sing along 
From sea to shining sea 
Be proud of it and always love it 
That's what this country needs 
Yeah, turn it on up and let it ring out 
Across the land of the free 
They ought to build a statue of Hand Williams, Sr. 
In Washington, D.C. 
'Cause what this country needs 
Is a little more steel guitar 
Yeah and put a sawin' fiddle right square in the middle 
Straight out of a Texas bar 
And ya'll give us a song, we can all sing along 
From sea to shining sea 
Be proud of it and always love it 
That's what this country needs 
You just be proud of it and always love it 
And that's what this country needs.
