Don Schlitz/Thom Schuyler
There was a brand new stranger at the old bus station
He said Music City is my destination
He said The whole wide world's gonna sing my song
And you can take that to the bank
I'm on a mission
I'm on a mission
I'm on a mission from Hank
He got a furnished room and a job at the market
He kept a little notebook in his back pocket
And every time you'd see him he was writing a song
And he would never leave one piece blank he'd say
I'm on a mission
I'm on a mission
I'm on a mission from Hank
He sang when no one would listen
So he sang until they hung on every word
Ah then one day his phone started ringing
They said we want you and the songs you've been singing
And the kid said fine, just give me some time
To talk to my patron saint you see
I'm on a mission
I'm on a mission
I'm on a mission from Hank
Yes sir, That night as he laid in the darkness
Ol?Luke the drifter came to him and said
Oh now here's your chance boy go on and take it
You sing from the heart and you're gonna make it
But if anybody tries to change you
Into something that you ain't you tell 'em
I'm on a mission
I'm on a mission
I'm on a mission from Hank
I'm on a mission
I'm on a mission
I'm on a mission from Hank
