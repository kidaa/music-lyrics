One day while bathing in the sea
my talking dolphin spoke to me
he spoke to me in symphony
from freedom's peace beneath the sea
he looked to me eyes full of love
said yes we live behind the sun

Behind the sun

The sun goes up
and the sun gets down
but like the heart of the sun
my heart continues to pound

Now while I shower in the rain
I watch my dolphin swim away
the one who listens to the surf
can feel the pulse beat of the earth
and like my dolphin swims so free
the sun does swim into the sea

Behind the sun

An island flying through the sky
one day your son might ask you why
and if you son should be a girl
she too might ask you of this world
the sun shines sweet upon your beach
and yes my dolphin loves to teach

Behind the sun

The sun goes up
and the sun gets down
but like the heart of the sun
my heart continues to pound
