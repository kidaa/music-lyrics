She's a witch
a bonafide bore
what's more - she snores
and that is a fact
cow eyes lie
yes it's time to resist
how did I ever
get into this
how could I ever
have kissed that bitch
so what if she's
got big tits

She's the kinda girl
who changas her mind really quick
she's the kinda girl who
won't just let things sit

she came like a cat
like a cat to cat nop
she came in my lap
with her womanly hips
when I first met her
I came unglued
I played the part of
a blueblooded fool
I'm through with your sewage
I'm through with your trash
I always knew that I'd
get the last laugh

She's the kinda girl
who changas her mind really quick
she's the kinda girl who
won't just let things sit

like two trains on one track
bound for a crash
two red white and blues we were
destined to clash
I can't fix the future
I can't change the past
like fly by night news
we were not meant to last
I'm through with your bluefish
I'm through with your gash
I'm through being screwed with by
you and your wack attack

Jump back for chump love
you won't be back for cover
but no no no no
I'm no chump love sucker
No chump love sucker

No chump love sucker

I thought that your love
was a matter of fact
but I lost my pride
when I realized that
the smack in my bag
and my baseball bat
was all you were after
boys  you dirty rat 
she's a bitch and a brat
and a living disaster
she thought she was fast
but I was faster
