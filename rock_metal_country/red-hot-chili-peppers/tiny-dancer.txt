Yelled: Here's a song 
Here's a little punk rock song for you 
A little punk rock called 
I think it was written by the Ramones 
In the early 70's 
Maybe before they started 
You know, when it was really hard core back in the old days 
Remember? 

Flea, 
I could have sworn this was the Dead Kennedys 

No no no no no 
I think it was Sham 69 

No, this is the Buzzcocks 

You idiot, you worthless peon 
Don't you know this is one of the 
It must have been, um 
The Sex Pistols 

No, this is Non Non Non 

Hey, it was the Church or the Weirdoz maybe 

Hold me closer tiny dancer 
Count the headlights on the highway 
Lay me down in sheets of linen 
You've had a busy day today
