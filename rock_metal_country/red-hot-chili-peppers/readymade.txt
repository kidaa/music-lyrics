Readymade, Readymade
Steady as the rhythm rolls
Readymade, Readymade
And this is how the story goes

I got a cousin making beats deep down in Arizona
Gonna rock it to her mound in the city of the moaner

Readymade, Readymade
Steady as the rhythm rolls
Readymade, Readymade
And this is how the story goes

And if I give to you my sacred sigh, you got it
And if I stay the course I'll stay the night, come get in

Readymade, Readymade
Getting out to celebrate
Readymade, Readymade
And now it's time to educate

I got a sister makin' babies with a black and decker blowtorch
We gonna frop it all night in the middle of a black hole

Readymade, Readymade
Let 'em out to celebrate
Readymade, Readymade
And now it's time to educate

And I give to you my sacred sigh, you got it
And if I stay the course I'll stay the night, come get in

Readymade, Readymade
Rock it for the circus slave
Readymade, Readymade
Tell them now the love to save

I got a brother makin' trouble in the state of California
Gonna let it all night in the city of Sedona

Readymade, Readymade
Rock it for the circus slave
Readymade, Readymade
Listen but don't be afraid

And if I give to you my sacred sigh, you got it
And if I stay the course I'll stay the night, come get in
