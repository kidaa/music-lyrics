All you slingers and fiends
hide behind your rocks
put down your guard
I'm not here to box
this is no showdown
so throw down your guns
you see it doesn't matter
where you come from
you could be from park ave
or from a park bench
you could be a politican
or a bitchy princess
but if you're lookin' for a fist
and you're lookin' to unite
put your knuckleheads together
make a fist and fight
not to your death
and not to your grave
I'm talking about t hat freedom
fight like a brave

fight like a brave
don't be a slave
no one can tell you 
you've got to be afraid

If you're sick-a-sick'n'tired
of being sick and tired
if you're sick of all the bullshit
and you're sick of all the lies
it's better late than never
to set-a-set it straight
you know the lie is dead
so give your self a break
get it through your head
get if off your chest
get it out your arm
because it's time to start fresh
you want to stop dying
the life you could be livin'
I'm here to tell a story
but I'm also here to listen
no I'm not your preacher
and I'm not your physician
I'm just trying to reach you
I'm a rebel with a mission

fight like a brave
don't be a slave
no one can tell you 
you've got to be afraid

fight like a brave
don't be a slave
no one can tell you 
you've got to be afraid

I'm here today to pump up the uplift mofo party plan
a plan based on a band, a band based on a plan
there should be no.....in the land of lands
it's a hollywood jam

You say you're running and you're running
and you're running afraid
you say you ran across the planet
but you couldn't get away
the fire in your brain
was driving you insane
you were looking for a day
in a life that never came
so don't tell me that
I've got to take a number
cause I've been to that doctor
and believe me that's a bummer
here's a one of a kind
convention of the mind
and don't forget to mention
that it doesn't cost a dime
come as you like
and leave any time
and one more thing
you know it doesn't have to rhyme

fight like a brave
don't be a slave
no one can tell you 
you've got to be afraid...
