persistant mystic faults my vision
its like always this point of collision

its raining in my cranium
my head feels like a stadium

3 pound of love
about to burst
inside my 3 pound 
universe

its raining in my cranium
my head feels like a stadium

these are the melancholy mechanics of my mind

symbols I've been given to express my goal
always come up short
you know they just don't get that low

its raining in my cranium
my head feels like a stadium

these are the melancholy mechanics of my mind

Quick release chemicals strike with incomprehensible precision
Biorganic electronics targeting microscopic destinations of devistation

cleaner than light
meaner than a laser fight in the night 2000
billions of micro maniacs unknown to most as the uncontrollable soldiers
of suffering succotash
instantaneous infiltration leaves me with a case of bustation, frustration,
alone in the constellation of alienation detached from empty conversation
I wait
I wait
for the waaaaaave to break.
