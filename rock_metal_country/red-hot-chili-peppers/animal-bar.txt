Never 21 when everyone's a sailor
Coming up strong with the animal bar
Ever loving more with mr.norman mailer
Turn another page at the animal bar
And it wont be long
No it wont be long
No it wont be long
Because it can't be long

I I I the cry of isolation
I I I the high of meditation
I I I for sweet precipitation
I I I the high of deprivation

And it wont be long
No it wont be long
No it wont be long
Because it can't be long

[Chorus:]
Rain on my frustration
Stake my claim now break this
Wash me down my station
Makes more rain foresaken

In between the sky and every piece of the earth
Runnin' through the mud
I got a feeling of worth

All aboard the ship
'Cause you're gonna need an ark
When the wet comes down
You'll be swimming like a shark
Mopping up the stain and
I'm a little older
The song of rain
At the animal bar

And it wont be long
No it wont be long
No it wont be long
Because it can't be long

I I I the cry of isolation
I I I the high of meditation
I I I for sweet precipitation
I I I the high of deprivation

And it wont be long
No it wont be long
No it wont be long
Because it can't be long

[Chorus]

Raindrops will fall from the sky
Stealing the shape from your eye
Now we can all get some sleep
The water the water the water
Saving us from the heat
Somethings will die in there place
Others will leave little trace
Fire will come find its day
The water the water the water
Washing it all away

[Chorus]
