Close to my skin
I'm falling in
Someone who's been

Sittin' by the phone
I'm left alone
In another zone

John says to live above hell and 
My will is well

No one is waiting 
For me to fail
My will could sail yeah

It's such a waste to be wasted
In the first place
I want to take of
Being face to face with common grace
To mediate on the warmest dream
And when I walk alone I listen
To our secret theme

Your solar eyes are like 
Nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close
That I can see right through
I'd take a fall and you know
That I'd do anything
I will for you

Sailin' for the sun
Cause there is one
knows where I'm from 
I care for you
I really do I really do

Come closer now
So you can lie 
Right by my side

Sittin' alone in the sun
I wrote a letter to you
Getting over myself

Your solar eyes are like 
Nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close
That I can see right through
I'd take a fall and you know
That I'd do anything
I will for you
Your solar eyes are like 
Nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close
That I can see right through
I'd take a fall and you know
That I'd do anything
I will for you

Close to my skin
Someone who's been
I'm falling in

Disasters are
Just another star
Failling in my yard

John says to live above hell
My will is well

Long to be with
Someone to tell
I love your smell
