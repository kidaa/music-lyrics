Stretching out your tightness 
good enough ??? grow

stretching out your tightness
time to open up your whole

when it rains, i let myself get wet
i have always wanted to
give something to my brother

proposing to expose your head
to something that is like no other

hit it

i'll stretch you out
i'll stretch you out my friend
i'll stretch you out

the ??? from ??? intuition is my liquid fare

we are all in favor of the opening

three pounds of love and knowledge are expanding in my skull
truth be told, we let the good times roll

i have always wanted to
receive it and believe it
and its ??? and creating love

tender titilations

i'll stretch you out

i'll stretch you out my friend
i'll stretch you out
i'm a fish and i can swim all day
i can swim in so many ways
make it up as i go along
that way it is never wrong

i'm a bird and i can fly away
i can shift in so many shapes
make it up as i go along
that way it is never wrong

ow

there's a glowing up around the moon it's showing
we want to play in the water that is flowing
very legendary instraplanetary fairy

varied truths
she's making just for you

yes, i have always wanted to
give something to this stranger

m m m moving to approve the grove
a mental transformation
