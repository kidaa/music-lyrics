Bells around St. Petersburg
When I saw you

I hope I get what you deserve
And this is where I find

Smoke surrounds your perfect face
And I'm falling

Pushin a broom out into space
And this is where I find a way

The stadium arcadium
A mirror to the moon
I'm forming I'm warming
State of the art
Until the clouds come crashing

Stranger things have happened
Both before and after noon
I'm forming I'm warming
Pushing myself
And no I don't mind asking
Now

Alone inside my forest room
And it's storming

I never thought I'd be in bloom
But this is where I start

Derelict days and the stereo plays
For the all night crowd
That it cannot phase
And I'm calling

Tedious weeds that the media breeds
But the animal gets what the animal needs
And I'm sorry

And this is where I find

Rays of dust that wrap around
Your citizen

Kind enough to disavow
And this is where I stand
