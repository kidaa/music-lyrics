step right up and listen please
you're gonna get it with the greatest of ease
everybody gather round all aboard the underground
you've got to get in before you get out
and gettin' out is what it's gonna be about 
if you find that you are blind
open your bashful mind
let my band step inside
and take you on a cosmic ride
with honest sounds i'll paint your brain
for in this song i do proclaim
that once aboard this moving train
i'll do my best to ease your pain
slinky as my speech may be 
on this trip you'll ride for free
this axis bold as love you see comes and goes so easily
space is king or so i sing, subway to venus
once aboard and feeling smooth
like a liquid you will ooze
into a state of mind that soothes
aw be my quest inside my grove
cause what i've got to give to you
is gonna make you wiggle like a wiggley worm
cause you deserve to wiggle and squirm
life's too short to be in a hole
so bust into your funkiest stroll
space is king or so i sing, subway to venus
take your body shake it around
do the dog on the ground
and if i can't make you dance
i guess i'll just have to make you piss your pants
space is king or so i sing, subway to venus
