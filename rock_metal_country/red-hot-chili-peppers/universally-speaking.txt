I saw your face
Elegant and tired
Cut up from the chase
Still I so admired
Bloodshot your smile
Delicate and wild
Give me she wolf style
Rip right thru me

[Pre-chorus]
Silveretta the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her ive got her on my mind
Nothing better then feeling is so fine
Simply put I saw love stream flow

[Chorus]
Come on baby 'cause cause there's no name for
Give it up and I got what I came for
Universally speaking
Take it back and you make me nervous
Nothing better then love and service
Universally speaking
Win in the long run

I saw your crime
Dying to get high
Two of a kind
Beat all hands tonight

[Pre chorus]

[Chorus]
