i cry, i cry
i was born in a land, i don't think you understand
god damn what i am
i'm a native of this place, please don't kick me in my face
my race has been disgraced

won't somebody testify, kick a hole right in the sky
testify testify kick a hole right in the sky
slap a liar in his eye, kick a hole right in the sky
testify testify kick a hole right in the sky johnny, 
johnny, johnny
puts us in a pumpkin shell where you keep us very well
it's hell, where i dwell
when history books are full of shit, i become the anarchist
i'm pissed at this
what this country claims to be
it's a lie
no place for me
i bleed
kill my trust if you must
but in my blood there is lust
for life
that's right
apache blood is in my heart thrashing though me like a shark
crashing though the dark
what am i supposed to do
i feel like i'm cut into confused
by rules
do these cultures clash or am i living in the past
i ask please tell me fast
to what do i belong and if i change will i be wrong
i took my foot kicked a hole in the sky
i proceeded to plead fathers help me decide
a jagged flash of light struck me in the eye
i turned around and found that i was still alive
snakes rise high from the purple black sky
the red cloud rains and the black horse rides
then it dawned on my like the mornin' sun
i'm a part of two worlds and the mornin' comes
glowing embers tend to remember when
the power that is peace was treated as a friend
i am a master of and i've got to take action
i'm a man, the animal man
