I think I'll go on a walkabout
And find out what it's all about
Just me and my own two feet
In the heat I've got myself to meet
A detective of perspective I
Need to try to get a bigger eye
I could learn the art of life
On a walk I could find a wife
On a walkabout

You could do it in the city
You could do it in a zone
You could do it in a dessert
You could do the unknown
On a walkabout

High dessert skies are what I spy
So flyyou've got to wonder why
The stingrays must be fat this year
Moving slow in my lowest gear
The digirido original man with a dream
I believe the Aborigine
On a walkabout

You could do it with a shuffle
You could do it with a stroll
You could do it with a stride
You could do it all alone
On a walkabout

I've been sitting far too long
At homeI've got to get along
A walk could cure most all my blues
bare feet or in my two shoe
Bloodwood flowers in my gaze
Walkabout in a sunny daze
On a walkabout

I think I'll go on a walkabout
Find out what it's all about
Just me and my own two feet
In the heat I've got myself to meet
Use your legs to rock it wide
Take a ride to the other side
