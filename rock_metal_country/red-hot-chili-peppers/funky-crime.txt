Why do you do what you do
I do what I want to do 
who said you could do what you do
I told you who told me to
I do what I want to do
I do what I want to do

funky crime funky crime
don't you know funk's colors blind
well I've committed a funky crime
against a state of mind

Hey you mister interview
I don't have to answer you
this is what I grew into
don't judge me and my soul stew
cause funk is my attitude
funk is my attitude

funky crime funky crime
don't you know funk's colors blind
well I've committed a funky crime
against a state of mind

Barriers of race
in the media take place
tellin'you there is no room
for what you do, don't budge
there's no groove to your gloom
who made you the judge
always room for funky tunes
and yes I funk it up

Funky boy
meets a funky girl
make it funky, baby
cause the funk is crazy

Why do you do what you do
I do what I want to do 
who said you could do what you do
I told you who told me to
I do what I want to do
I do what I want to do

funky crime funky crime
don't you know funk's colors blind
well I've committed a funky crime
against a state of mind

Funky crime
funky crime
funky funky crime
the crime is funky
