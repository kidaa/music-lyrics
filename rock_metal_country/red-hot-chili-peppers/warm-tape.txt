Shiver for me girl 
Deliver for me my darling 
Pushin' up to you 
A river that runs right thru you 
Swim for your smile 
In a blue rock quarry 
Make it for me baby 
You won't be sorry 
Shiver for my now 
Deliver for me my darling 

[Chorus:]
Miles and miles of nether worlds I roam 
Settle for love you're never far from home 
Carry me down into the waters of 
Carry me down into the waters of love 
Two of us were made of angels dust 
I've been around 
But not around enough 

Shadow my free form 
A woman that I could keep warm 
Quiver for me girl 
Give me your head and shoulders 
Shot from the pages of love and glory 
Sleeping next to you and I'm in your story 
Shadow my free form 
A woman that I could keep warm 

[Chorus]

Let's go 
I know, I make it for two 
Intuitions only what you take from it 
I know, I make it for two 
You were there and I was fortunate 
I know, I make it for two 

Shiver for me now 
Deliver for me my darling 
A living that I could 
Be giving to you my sweet love 
Swim for your smile 
In a blue rock quarry 
Make it for me baby 
You won't be sorry 
Shot from the pages of 
Love and glory 
Sleeping next to you 
And I'm in your dream 

Settle for love
