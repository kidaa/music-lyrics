Johnny's in the basement mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement thinking about the goverment
the man in the trench coat, badge out, laid off,
says he's got a bad cough: wants to get it paid off

God knows when but you're doin' it again!
you better duck down the alleyway lookin'for a new friend
the man in the coonskin cap by the big pen
wants eleven dollar bills: you only got ten

Look out, kid
Look out, kid, it's somethin' that you did
Look out, kid, 'cause they keep all hid

Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot
talkin' at the heat put plants in the bed but
the phone's tapped anyway, maggie says that many say
they must bust in early may
orders from the D.A.

Walk on your tip toes, don't try  no doz 
better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
keep a clean nose, watch the plain clothes
you don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows

Look out, kid
Look out, kid, it's somethin' that you did
Look out, kid, 'cause they keep all hid

Looks to me like you did
a little to much hittin' kid
you should've took it to the bridge
before you started to skid

Look out, kid
the good god willin', we'll bebop to Bob Dylan
chillin'em, thrillin'em, and red hot killin'em
killin'em

Get sick, get well, hand around a ink well
ring bell, hard to tell if anything is goin' to sell
try hard, get barred, get back, write braille
get jailed, jump bail, join the army, if you fail

But users, cheaters, six time losers
hand around the theatres
girl by the whirlpool lookin' for a new fool
don't follow leaders, watch the parkin' meters

Look out, kid
Look out, kid, it's somethin' that you did
Look out, kid, 'cause they keep all hid
