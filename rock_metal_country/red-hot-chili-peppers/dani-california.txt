Getting born in the state of Mississippi
Papa was a copper and my mama was a hippy
In Alabama she was swinging hammer price
You gotta pay when you pick the panarama
She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the world was your confidant take me for

Black bandana sweet Louisiana
Robbing on a bank in the state of Indiana
She a runner, rebel and a stunner
Coming everyway saying baby what cha gonna
Looking down the barrel of a hop and a forty five

Just another way to survive

California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest.

She's a lover baby and a fighter
should of seen her coming when it got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California
Devils gonna come when I was gonna moan yah
A little lonely she was stealing another breath
I love my baby to death

California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest

Who knew the other side of you
who knew that all this tired to prove
To true to say good bye to you
To true to say, say, say

Was the bater gifted and a made her
One for the now and eleven for the later

Never made it up to Minesota
North Dakota man was a gunning for the quota

Down in the valley she was saving the best for last
It only hurts when I laugh
Gone to bed

California rest in peace
Simultaneous release,
California show your teeth,
She's my priestess, I'm your priest.

California rest in peace
Simultaneous release,
California show your teeth,
She's my priestess, I'm your priest.
