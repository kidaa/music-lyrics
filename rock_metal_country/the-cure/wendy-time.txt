you look like you could do with a friend she said
you look like you could use a hand
someone to make you smile she said
someone who can understand
share your trouble
comfort you
hold you close
and i can do all of these
i think you need me here with you

you look like you do with a sister she said
you look like you need a girl to call your own...
like fabulous! fabulous!
call me fabulous!
and rubbing her hands so slow
you stare at me all strange she said
are you hungry for more
i've had enough i said
please leave me alone
please go

it doesn't touch me at all
it doesn't touch me at all

you know that you could do with a friend she said
you know that you could use a word
like feel or follow or fuck she said
and laughing away as she turned
you've everything but no-one
like the last man on earth
and when i die i said
i'll leave you it all
door closes
leaves me cold

it doesn't touch me at all
it doesn't touch me at all

you really do need a sister she said
you really do need a girl to call your own...
like wonderful! wonderful!
call me wonderful!
and running her hands so slow
you stare at me all strange she said
are you hungry for more
i've had enough i said
please leave me alone
please go
please go
