there's no-one left in the world
that i can hold onto
there is really no-one left at all
there is only you
and if you leave me now
you leave all that we were
undone
there is really no-one left
you are the only one

and still the hardest part for you
to put your trust in me
i love you more than i can say
why won't you just believe
