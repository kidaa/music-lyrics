You wear your smile
Like it was going out of fashion
Dress to inflame
But douse any ideas of passion
You carry your love in a trinket
Hanging round your throat
Always inviting
Always exciting
But I must not take off my coat

Well I'm tired of hanging around
I want somebody new
I'm not sure who I've got in mind
But I know
That it's not you
That it's not you

You ask me questions
That I never wanted to hear
I am the only one
Just until you finish this year
I would murder you
If I had the alibi
Here in my hand
And you just laugh
'cause you don't understand

That I'm tired of hanging around
I want somebody new
I'm not sure
Who I've got in mind
But I know that it's not you
It's not you
It's not you
It's not you
It's not you
It's not you
No it's not you
That it's not you
It's not you
It's not you
