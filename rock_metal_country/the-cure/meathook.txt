I went into the butchers
I said wanted wanted wanted some
Meat
Pass
Me some of that steak over there
It looks so
Sweet

I lost my heart to a meathook

That butcher man was some 
Lady
He really stole my heart
He hung me up on his meathook
A real piece of
Slaughterhouse art

I lost my heart to a meathook

There's a meathook in my heart
Tearing me all apart
Ripping out my insides
But I just can't get away
I can't leave my
Meathook
Lost my heart to a meathook
Lost my heart to a meathook
Meathook
