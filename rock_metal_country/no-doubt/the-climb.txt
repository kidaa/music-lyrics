Step by step 
I've come closer to reaching the top
Every step must be placed so that I don't fall off 
Looking down to see about how much higher I am 
Another cool wind comes through and brushes my skin 
The harder I push the tension does grow 
I gather my thoughts the further and further I go 
With some luck I just might keep on climbing 
So better to climb than to face a fall 
So high the climb 
Can't turn back now
Must keep on climbing up to the clouds 
So high the climb Can't turn back now 
Must keep on climbing up to the clouds 

Pulling myself up by a rope
I better my view 
The only thing in sight is what I must do 
As I turned I could see myself falling 
Which in return save me strength for the climb

So high the climb 
Can't turn back now 
Must keep on climbing up to the clouds
So high the climb 
Can't turn back now 
Must keep on climbing up to the clouds

Although many failed I must now prevail with no question 
Have no time to stop 
Onward to the top of the mountain 
And I can't turn back now 
Its so very high but I can't turn back now 
If I keep it up, I'm gonna make it

I'm so very close can't you see 
So high the climb 
Can't turn back now 
Must keep on climbing up to the clouds 
So high the climb 
Can't turn back now
Must keep on climbing up to the clouds 
I'm getting closer
