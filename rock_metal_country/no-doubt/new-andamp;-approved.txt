New, you're so new, new, you're so new, new, you're so new
New, you're so new, new I've never had this taste in my past

My normal hesitation is gone
And I really gravitate to your will
Are you here to fetch me out?
'Cause I've never had this taste in my mouth

Don't let it go away, this feeling has got to stay
Don't let it go away, this feeling has got to stay
And I can't believe I've had this chance now
Don't let it go away away...away...away...away...

And you're consuming me violently
And your reverence shamelessly tempting me
Who sent this maniac?, 'cause I never had this taste in the past
You're different, you're different from the former
Like a fresh, battery I'm energized by you

Don't let it go away, this feeling has got to stay
Don't let it go away, this feeling has got to stay
And I can't believe I've had this chance now
Don't let it go away away...away...away...away...

Why am I so curious?, this territory is dangerous
I'll probably end up at the start, I'll be back in line with my broken heart
New, you, new
And I never had this taste in the past
And I never had this taste in the past

Don't let it go away, this feeling has got to stay
Don't let it go away, this feeling has got to stay
And I can't believe I've had this chance now
Don't let it go away away...away...away...away...

And I can't believe it, can't believe it, can't believe it, can't believe it
Don't let it go away, this feeling has got to stay
Don't let it go away
New, you're so new, new, you're so new, new, you're so new
New, you're so new, new, you're so new, new, you're so new
New, you're so new, new, you're so new, new
