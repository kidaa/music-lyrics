performed live by No Doubt 

Why must you record my phone calls 
Are you planning a bootleg LP 
You said you've been threatened by gangsters 
Now it's you that's threatening me 

Can't fight corruption with con tricks. 
The youth, they love to commit crime 
I dread, dread to think what the future will bring 
When we're living in gangster times 
Don't call me skaface... 

Don't interrupt while I'm talking 
Or they'll confiscate all your guitars 
A catch-22 says if I sing a tune 
They will make me an overnight star 

Don't offer a single protection 
The youth, they love to commit crime 
I dread to think what the future will bring 
When we're living in real gangster times
