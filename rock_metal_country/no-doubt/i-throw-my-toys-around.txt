I've got no time for fairy stories
I'm not a little girl
So you can leave me all alone
And turn off the lights as well
If you were frightened
Then whistle
But I don't think you'd like it
Such a nice kid

Nobody's looking now nobody's looking
I throw my toys around

Somebody's being very bad
I wonder who it can be
Somebody's going to get in trouble 
I know it isn't me
I'm just a little angel
Bet you don't know what I've done
When your back's turned

Nobody's looking now nobody's looking
I throw my toys around

Pick up those building blocks
Chop off the baby's locks
Swing dolly by the hair
Put down that teddy bear
Slam dunk the happy clown
I throw my toys around
I've got no time for bedtime stories
I'm not a little child
Everything makes me furious
And everything makes me wild
If you were frightened then whistle
And I come running to you
As you boo hoo

Nobody's looking now nobody's looking
I throw my toys around
