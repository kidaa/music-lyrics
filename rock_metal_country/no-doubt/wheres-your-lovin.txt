Yeah..ohhh
Where is your lovin'? 
Where's your lovin'? 

Chorus:
I'm in it for somethin' I think it's your lovin' 
Your huggin' your kissin' your sweet tender lovin' 
The thought of you comin' makes me come a runnin' 
I ran all the way just a pushin' and shovin' 
Where's your lovin'? 
Where's your lovin'? 

I'm really nothin' with you I'll be somethin' 
Because I'd be hummin' instead of just runnin' 
If you could be someone I'd give all my lovin' 
If you give me some back then I would be shinin' 
If you give me some back then I would be shinin' 
Alright!! Hep Hep Alright!! 

Chorus:
I'm in it for somethin' I think it's your lovin' 
Your huggin' your kissin' your sweet tender lovin' 
The thought of you comin' makes me come a runnin' 
I ran all the way just a pushin' and shovin' 
Where's your lovin'? 
Where's your lovin'? 

Mmm..
When will it be? 
Will I see you again? 
A long time from now 
I'll just wait until then 
How soon will it be? 
What time will be chose? 
God only knows how much I love you sooooo 
I love you sooo yeaah ohhhh 
I love you sooooooohh 

Chorus:
I'm in it for somethin' I think it's your lovin' 
Your huggin' your kissin' your sweet tender lovin' 
The thought of you comin' makes me come a runnin' 
I ran all the way just a pushin' and shovin' 
Where's your lovin? 
Where's your lovin? 

Alright!! Hep Hep Alright!! uh-huh! Alright!! Hep Hep
