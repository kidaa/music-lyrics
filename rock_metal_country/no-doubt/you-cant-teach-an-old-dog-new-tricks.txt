At the park you try to teach a dog a brand new trick
You take a ball and toss it far and then you say "go get it"
You know you can't teach an ol' dog new tricks
He only knows what he may
No you can't teach an ol' dog new tricks
He'll only curl his tail and run away

And so you try a new approach, you try to hold and cuddle it
You hope he'll learn it if you try again but he just don't get it
You can't teach an ol' dog new tricks
He only knows what he may
No you can't teach an ol' dog new tricks
He'll only curl his tail and run away
You can't teach an ol' dog new tricks
He only knows what he's trained
No you can't teach an ol' dog new tricks
Not even if you get down and beg
No you can't teach an ol' dog

Remember when you saw him in the window
You bought him from the local pet store
You can't forget the first time you brought him home
You brought him home, he went on the floor
You could have taught him then if you would have known
Party No Doubt!

You can't teach an ol' dog new tricks
He only knows what he may
No you can't teach an ol' dog new tricks
He'll only curl his tail and run away
You can't teach an ol' dog new tricks
He only knows what he's trained
No you can't teach an ol' dog new tricks
Not even if you get down and beg
No you can't teach an ol' dog
No no way
You can't teach an ol' dog new tricks
He'll only curl his tail and run away
