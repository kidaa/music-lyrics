from the "Cellophane Boy" promo CD 

And I'm not the judge or the referree 
And I can't accept, 'cause I am uptight 
And the smoke clying into my eyes are burning 
My concern is I just might get a new life 

And I can't relate to the hypnotist 
And I can't get close, 'cause of plastic wrap 
And I want to have kids, but their father's up inside the clouds 
The distance between us on my mind 

Up until now things have been fine, temporarily 
You're cute, but the circumstances have changed 
Your subtition method crutch 
Your whole protection from your fame 
There's presentation on my ploy 
Is to change my cellophane boy 

Aoh, it's not the 70s 
Let your future fly with me 

Up until now things have been fine, temporarily 
You're cute, but the circumstances have changed 
Your subtition method crutch 
Your whole protection from your fame 
There's presentation on my ploy 
Is to change my cellophane boy 

And I want your habit to be me 
Your harbor and your refugee
