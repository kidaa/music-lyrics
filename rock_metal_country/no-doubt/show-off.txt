I drive in my dad's new car 
This time I've gone too far 
I did not know the price I'd pay 
I smashed up his last years pay 

I'm rappin' with my so-called friends 
Awaitin' for my commands 
The lies are told, they seem to know 
So telling me would be wrongly so 

Chorus:
A different time, a different place, a different look, a different face 
I'm showin' off 
>?? 
I'm showin' off 

It's all over the deed is done 
And that's the price of my own fun 
Took it for granted the way I thought 
And now my confidence just can't be bought 

Chorus:
A different time, a different place, a different look, a different face 
I'm showin' off 
>??  
I'm showin' off 

That's the way it looks when you show off 
That's the way it looks when you show off 
That's the way it looks when you show off 
That's the way it looks when you show off 
That's the way it looks when you show off
