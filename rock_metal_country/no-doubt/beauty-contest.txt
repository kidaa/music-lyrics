from the "Simple Kind of Life" single 

Damsel in distress is quite submissive 
Look how somber my vanity is 
A feminine human creature 
Superficial, seducing detour 
I'm going to the mall for the cookie cutter 
The ugly duckling will always suffer 
Contaminated standards, I try to fight it 
I better get back on my diet 

Obsessed with the beauty contest 
Beauty contest 
How'd my vanity get such a mess? 
Beauty contest 
I'm obsessed 

Reduce myself, I got the strict restrictions 
Not sexy enough without the regulations 
A melting point countdown the fading features 
Born to blossom and bloom to perish 

Obsessed with the beauty contest 
Beauty contest 
Oh, I've got to get out of this mess 
Beauty contest 
I'm obsessed 

And I've fallen, I can't help myself 
I'm feeling envious of all the rest 
You're bringing out the lemming in me 
A victim of the cattle call disease 
Not easy to be me 

I feel so lame 

Obsessed with the beauty contest 
Beauty contest 
How'd my vanity get such a mess? 
Obsessed with the beauty contest 

Obsessed with the beauty contest 
Beauty contest 
I've got to get out of this mess 
Obsessed with the beauty contest 

Obsessed with the beauty contest 
Beauty contest 
How'd my vanity get such a mess? 
Caught up in the beauty contest 
Caught up in the beauty contest 
Caught up in the beauty contest 
Caught up in the beauty contest 
Caught up in the beauty contest 

And I feel so lame 

How'd my vanity get such a mess? 

child My vanity's a mess
