In the quickness of our haste
It seems we forget how to live
The old blueprint
No longer manifests itself
As the correct way to exist
Wipe the grime off the view hole
And please take a closer look
Environmental bandits
Up to their shenanigans
Crooks disguised...
We've got to find another way
To make the world go 'round
Our individual roles we think
Not so important to the plot
The big picture unseen
Leaving life in bewteen
Destroyed and overwrought
There's no need to point the finger
We understand who takes the blame
Delinquents caught
Red-handed in the act
Crooks disguised as you and I
We've got to find another way
To make the world go 'round
You see there's many many many
People in the world
And I'm not sure if I like
What I've heard
I'm not sure if I like
What I'm doing myself
I'm not sure if I like how it turns
Degradation
Violation
Inexcusable exploitation
It's the dawning of a new era
People consiously don't care
How unfair
We've got to find another way
To make the world go 'round
