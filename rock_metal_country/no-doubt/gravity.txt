We're so lucky
Still holding on
Just like Venus in the morning sun
And you and me got gravity

I don't know where all the time went
Light years and so many moons
So many close calls

Now I see a thousand percent
You meant what you said, and it's good
'Cause everybody falls

A million miles and it fades
We're into orbit now we're safe
So don't you let go
Don't ever let me float away

We're so lucky
Still holding on
Just like Venus in the morning sun
And you and me got gravity

When it's feeling like a solar eclipse
And the shit it gets so cold
You think it'll never go

Exploding like a beat-up rocket ship
That's spinning so fast 'round the world
I wish we could make it slow down

A million miles and it fades
We're into orbit now we're safe
So don't let me go
Don't ever let me float away

We're so lucky
Still holding on
Just like Venus in the morning sun
And you and me got gravity

And we're so lucky
Still holding on
Just like Venus in the morning sun
And you and me got gravity

And we can swim the milky way like star-crossed lovers do
I never really thought we'd ever make it out this far, did you?
Leave the story in the sky like star-crossed lovers do
Lets spend a million lost in space, me and you, me and you

And we're so lucky
Still holding on
Just like Venus in the morning sun
And you and me got gravity

And we're so lucky
Still holding on
Just like Venus in the morning sun
And you and me got gravity
