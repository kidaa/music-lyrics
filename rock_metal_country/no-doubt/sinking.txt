You're on a wide open ocean
No one around you for miles
You're thinkin' of drinkin' on water
While you're sailing the Nile
No one to stop you on your way
Flyin' by goes a stork
You decide to bring your oars in now
But accidently knock out the cork

Row your boat to shore
'Cause it is leaking and you're still drinking
Unless you cork the hole
You won't be sailing, you'll be sinking

Not knowin' you're sinkin'
You take out a bottle of rum - yum
Swiggin' a drink to the bottom
The bottle reads 'Van Monchinghum'

Oars back into the water
You think you'll sail on
But you can't 'cause your boat contains
Three and a half gallons

Row your boat to shore
'Cause it is leaking and you're still drinking
Unless you cork the hole
You won't be sailing, you'll be sinking

Row your boat to shore
'Cause it is leaking and you're still drinking 
Unless you cork the hole
You won't be sailing, you'll be sinking

Row, row, row your boat
And sail your ship to shore
You're barely, barely, barely keeping afloat
Well I hope that you won't drink no more

Row your boat to shore
It is leaking and you're still drinking
Unless you cork the hole
You won't be sailing, you'll be sinking

Row, row, row your boat
And sail your ship to shore
You're barely, barely, barely keeping afloat
Well I hope that you won't drink no more

Row, row, row your boat
And sail your ship to shore row row row your
boat
You're barely, barely, barely keeping afloat
you're barely barely barely
Well I hope that you won't drink no more

Row, row, row your boat
And sail your ship to shore row row row your
boat
You're barely, barely, barely keeping afloat
you're barely barely barely
Well I hope that you won't drink no more
