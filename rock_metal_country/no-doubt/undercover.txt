Curiosity
A cat up in a tree
Want you to get me down
But I'm scared of what I'll see
I need a private eye
To see through your disguise
cause I wanna know everything
Oh I'm lookin' down deep inside you
And I want to climb in but I can't do it
I'm so scared of what I might find there
Do you have something to hide and you can't show it?
I think I'm getting hot
Try to connect the dots
You're on your tip-toes
Trying hard not to get caught
Some things are unexplained
Some people can't be tamed
But I wanna know everything
Oh I'm lookin' down deep inside you
And I want to climb in but I can't do it
I'm so scared of what I might find there
Do you have something to hide and you can't show it?
And I want to believe you
I want to believe that you're giving it all up for me
You're so undercover
Keepin' it all hush-hush
What happened to us?
I can't believe, give it up
So I can get your love
I can't believe this
Oh I can't take it
Oh I'm gonna eat you up
I can't believe this
Under the covers
Oh I'm lookin' down deep inside you
And I want to climb in but I can't do it
I'm so scared of what I might find there
Do you have something to hide and you can't show it?
Oh I'm lookin' down deep inside you
And I want to climb in but I can't do it
I'm so scared of what I might find there
Do you have something to hide and you can't show it?
And I want to believe you
I want to believe that you're giving it all up for me
You're so undercover
Keepin' it all hush-hush
Oh I'm looking in your eyes
I wanna to grab you and I can't do it
I wanna take you back to real life
I wanna love you and I hope that I won't prove it
I wanna look down in your eyes
I wanna take off your disguise
