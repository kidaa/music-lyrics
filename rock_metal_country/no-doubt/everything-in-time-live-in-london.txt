Everything I do
Everything is you
Cinderella Hope
And it's all because you made me laugh
Coincidence or fate
Running towards a catastrophe

And everything I chose
Everything for you
And everything always in time will come
And I believe it's all for a reason

She asked how we are
She asked if I was all weird again
And of course I am
But I'm trying really really hard
So I lied to her
And I was wearing this prisoner face
So deep inside she had to know
I'm feeling lost inside the low
Everything always in time will come

Lying in your bed
I am a refugee you try to love
Am I wasting all of your time
And all my cute days on regret?
Is it healthy that we met?

Everything always in time will come

Is it wrong holding on
To my best friend my faded lover?
Who knows?

Coincidence or fate
Running towards what is meant to be
Save me

Everything always in time will show
Then we will know, it will show
Everything always in time will come
And I believe for everything there is a reason
And everything always in time will come
Everything I do
Everything is you
