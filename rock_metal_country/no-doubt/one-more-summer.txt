I've been wasting all this time
But I can't let go
'Cause it's just the way I feel

Getting used to your mistakes
But I can't let go
Do you ever think I'll heal?

You could be right
I could be wrong
Year after year always rewinding where we've gone

One more summer
One more weekend
I'm your lover
You're my weakness

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

In between the longest days
And the shortest nights
It always comes back to you and me

I could be right
You could be wrong
I can't believe it. Has it really been this long?

One more summer
One more weekend
You're my lover
I'm your weakness

I don't think I can change
I can't stay away
One more summer
One more summer

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

You could be right
I could be wrong
Year after year always rewinding where we've gone

I could be right
I could be wrong
Year after year after year after year after year after

One more summer
One more weekend
You're my lover
I'm your weakness

I don't think I can change
And I can't stay away
One more summer
One more summer

One more summer
One more weekend
You're my lover
I'm your weakness

I don't think I can change
And I can't stay away
I don't think I can change
And I can't stay away

One more summer
One more summer
