Sometimes sunshine
Does not want to shine on me
And sometimes I find myself blind
At first I cannot see and then I see it's me
I chose a road when I was young 
In search of fun temptation won
And all my soul I did surrender
If I had a chance to go back now 
Would I redeem my moral vows
Or would I repeat for my own laughter

Sometimes I hide somewhat
Like a bulb behind a shade
And sometimes I ask myself why
Is it 'cause the lights are too bright
Or because my eyes are closed too tight

Sometimes I find myself blind
Don't use my brain don't use my mind 
Distorted feelings always leading my way
But I must forgive myself and let the past lay
down to rest
And I'll be prepared to face myself in another
day - hey

From now on I will behave
But in the back of my mind I will be enslaved
From now on I will behave
But in the back of my mind I will be enslaved

Sometimes sunshine
Does not want to shine on me
And sometimes, sometimes
I get lost, I get lost

I chose a road when I was young
In search of fun temptation won
And all my soul I did surrender
If I had a chance to go back now
Would I redeem my moral vows
Or would I repeat for my own laughter oh hey

From now on I will behave
But in the back of my mind I will be enslaved
From now on I will behave
But in the back of my mind I will be enslaved
From now on hey hey hey yeah
From now on oh hey hey
From now on I will behave
But in the back of my mind I will be enslaved

Sometimes I find myself blind
Don't use my brain don't use my mind
Distorted feelings always leading my way
But I must forgive myself and let the past lay
down to rest
And I'll be prepared to face myself in another
day - hey

From now on I will behave
But in the back of my mind I will be enslaved I
mean it
From now on I will behave 
But in the back of my mind I will be enslaved
woo
From now on - from now on
From now on yeah
Oooh ooh ooh
The back of my mind, the back of my mind, I'll
be enslaved yeah
From now on hey yeah
From now on hoo I mean it I mean it
From now on I will behave I will behave
But in the back of my mind I will be enslaved
