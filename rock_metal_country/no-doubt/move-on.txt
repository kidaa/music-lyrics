Some chickens crossed the road, straying far
from the hen
Five reached the side one step below Zen
One was a female, four were mad-men
Who moved on, moved on moved on
Joined hands and moved on
Standing in line and falling asleep
Building a fence while we're counting the
sheep
We'd let you help out but our project's too deep
Move on, move on, move on
Stay awake, just move on

You have to understand that when it comes to
making music
We meshed the styles of five alive and
intertwined and fused it
Life comes from life and through our strife we
strove to make the sound true
Compelled to spell it out no doubt in search
of what we must do

Our house was too small so we had to move
The neighbors had much doubts so we had to
prove
That our soulful dimensions were true to the
groove
We, moved on, moved on, moved on
To our house in the middle of the street

Water the music, plant the seeds in the pot
Music's the life flowing through... is it not
Don't forget your roots, but also don't rot
Move on, move on, move on
Plant the seeds ond move on

You have to understand that when it comes to
making music
We meshed the styles of five alive and
intertwined and fused it
Life comes from life and through our strife we
strove to make the sound true
Compelled to spell it out no doubt in search
of what we must do

Don't be afraid, let your feelings show
Wear your heart on your sleeve, and let
yourself glow yeah
Don't be afraid, let your feelings show
Wear your heart on your sleeve, your heart on
your sleeve
And let yourself glow yeah
Ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah...
Don't be afraid, let your feelings show
Let yourself glow yeah
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
