By the way, every little thing about her face
Fills him up, the image so pleasing it could never be erased
Here to stay, embedded in his mind, he wishes they could be together
all the time

By the way she says things, the tone, just to hear her voice
He can't explain, the sound so exciting to him a perfect choice
Here to stay, embedded in his mind, he wishes they could betogether all
the time

With a natural way of thinking carefree innocent she's slightly sneaky
Confident and proud from another country has her way lives for today
By the way, she's far away

By the way, holding her, hugging her can feel so warm
Just think about it, two bodies embracing, creating love in this form
Here to stay, embedded in his mind, he wishes they could betogether all the
time

Then she kissed him and she went away
Far across to San Francisco Bay
You'd think that she would think again
And only want to be with him
Regardless of things that pull her far away, she's far away...
