Yeah yay oh

I said I'm starving yeah
I want some Pizza Coke and ice cream popcorn

Marshmallows milkshake and peanuts would be
so great
Pies chips candy apples Twinkies Frosted
Flakes 
And donuts french fries and some chocolate
cake with mustard
Cookies avocados pancakes pineapple juice
Whipped cream on some raw meat
That's not all I could...
Eat

belly
Broccoli sticky syrup churros dipped in sauce
Drippy sloppy joes then I'm full at last
Oh oh oh oh oh oh I'm full at last
And I'm full at I'm really really full at
