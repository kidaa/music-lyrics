Mmmm I'll put up with you in the morning
And I'll put up with you in the night
I'll put up with you anytime
Oh being with you's such a delight

I'll put up with you and your boyfriends
And I'll put up with you and your family
I'll put up with you and the inlaws
If they can put up with me

I'll put up with your complaining
And I'll put up with your needs
I'll put up with you messin' around
You can go but once more with me ?

I'll put up with you and your smoking
And I'll put up with you and your dirty deeds
I'll put up with you and your cussin'
You don't know how happy you would make me

I want you sugar yeah hey woo hoo hoo hoo
And baby I got to - I know I have to

I want you need you so bad
Oh you put up with me ?
Ooh I'll put up
I'll put up, I'll put up, I'll put up

I'll put up with your last name
And I'll put up with you and not kiss my lips
I'll put up with you not missin' me
Though down deep inside I wish you would change
Though down deep inside I wish you would change
Though down deep inside I wish you would change
Though down deep inside I wish you would change
