Can I feel the rhythm of the soundquake? 
See the movement of the ground cuz it will break 
Dance your body all around make your side ache 
Treat your feet to the beat shake shake shake 

Chorus:
Anticipation soundquake! 
Feel the vibration rocking soundquake! 
the nation soundquake! 

I said it... 

Chorus

Can you feel the rhythm of the soundquake? 
Give it all you got cuz it will take 
All the power that your body and soul makes 
Watch the towers crumble to the ground 

Chorus

The earth vibrates such a fast >way?  
Falling rock from above on my brain 
When the soundquake comes don't hes'tate
