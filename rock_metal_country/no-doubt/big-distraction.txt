Your my concentration,
everything else is a bore.
I've got myself snagged on you,
no self control...
Now all that I wanna do,
sleep in the shadow of you
for the rest of my life. 

Now I can chisel,
chisel and build a bomb.
A pain diposited,
from past scars.
'Cause the memories they can sleep,
and we can live comfortably 
for the rest of our lives-

Wrong or right!
Shipwrecked into you,
situation is foolish
but I will fight.
Your my big distraction
or biggest companion,
I'm falling fast
like an avalanche.

Indentured servant,
A slave to a slave.
Thank God for my hopeful heart,
and for mutual feelings.
Well look how it's balanced now,
maybe we'll just settle down
for the rest of our lives-

Wrong or right!
Shipwrecked into you
Situation is foolish,
but I will fight.
Your my big distraction 
or biggest companion,
I'm falling fast
Like an avalanche.

Look how it's balanced now,
Maybe we'll just settle down
For the rest of our lives...lives.

Shipwrecked into you,
situation is foolish
But I will fight.
Your my big distraction
or biggest companion,
I'm falling fast
like an avalache.
