Get on the ball if you love your lover
No gesture too small
Tear down the walls if you love her

Show her, make sure she'll never feel
abandoned

Get on the ball if you love your lover
No gesture too small
Tear down the walls if you love her
Just give it your all

Don't wait too long or she'll be gone fast as a
blink 
Don't wait too long or she'll be gone fast as a
