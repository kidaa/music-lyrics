I've got no time for fairy stories
I'm not a little girl
So you can leave me all alone
And turn off the lights as well

If you were frightened then listen
But I don't think you would like it
Such a nice kid

Nobody's looking now Nobody's looking
I throw my toys around

Somebody's being very bad
I wonder who it could be
Somebody's going to get in trouble
I know it isn't me

I'm just a little angel
But you don't know what I've done
When your backs turned

Nobody's looking now Nobody's looking
I throw my toys around

Pick up those building blocks
Chop off my baby's locks
Swing dolly by her hair
Put down that teddy bear
Slam dunk a happy clown
I throw my toys around

I've got no time for bedtime stories
I'm not a little child
Everything makes me furious
And everything makes me wild

If you are frightened
Then whistle and I'll come running to you
As you boo hoo

Nobody's looking now Nobody's looking
I throw my toys around
Nobody's looking now Nobody's looking
I throw my toys around

I throw my toys around
I throw my toys around
I throw my toys around
I throw my toys around
