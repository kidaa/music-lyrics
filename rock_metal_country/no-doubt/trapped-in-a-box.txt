Trapped in a box of tremendous size
It distorts my vision, it closes my eyes
Attracts filthy flies and pollutes in the skies
It sucks up our lives and proliferates lies 
Trapped in a box
Trapped in a box, four walls as sky
Got a screen for a window about two feet wide
My mind rides and slides as my circuits are
fried
No room for thought, use the box as my guide
Trapped in a box

Ooh trapped in a box
Watch the world as it flocks 
To life's paradox 
And we're all trapped in a box

Oh trapped in a box I'm not alone
I know of others with a box as their home
Light only enters from a crack or a hole
Oh this is not enough for a human to grow
Trapped in a box

Ooh trapped in a box
Watch the world as it flocks 
To life's paradox
And we're all trapped in a box

Always wanting a different view
Instant gratification for you
Reality gone with a single click 
Just hope that that switch won't stick

Ah trapped in a box my life becomes void
And all of the thought for myself's now
destroyed
Controlling my mind, what to eat, what to buy 
Subliminal rules: how to live, how to die
Trapped in a box

Ooh trapped in a box
Watch the, the world as it flocks
To life's paradox
And we're all, we're trapped in a box
Ooh trapped in a box
Watch the world as it flocks
To life's paradox
We're all trapped in a box

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
We're all trapped in a box
