Mr. Trouble never hangs around 
When he hears this mighty sound... 
"Here I come to save the day!" 
That means that Mighty Mouse is on the way. 
Yessir when there is a wrong to right 
Mighty Mouse will join the fight 
On the sea or on the land 
He gets the situation well in hand 
So though we are in danger 
We never despair 
Cause we know that where there's danger 
He is there! 
He is there! 
On the land! 
On the sea! 
In the air! 
We're not worryin' at all 
We're just listenin' for his call 
"Here I come to save the day!" 
That means that Mighty Mouse is on the way!
