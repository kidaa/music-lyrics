All of the D.J.'s surely have taken a lesson 
Start talking trash and I'll come with my Smith and Wesson 

A little competition comes my way 
Bittybye but it always winds up the same 
Ah but the stone that the builder refuse 
Shall be the end corner stone and ah 
There ain't nothin' wrong, ain't nothin' right 
And still I sit and lie awake at night 

Oh all of the D.J.'s surely have taken a lesson 
Try talkin' trash and I'll come with my Smith and Wesson 
Enough D.J.'s come - enough, enough style
But when I bust my lyrics we all know it's wicked and wily 

Ain't nothin' wrong, ain't nothin' right 
And still I sit and lie awake all night 

Oh you finish that with your gat if you wanna walk with me 
You bound to come down with the new style
Rock a rubadub known as reggae music 
You gonna come down with the new lyrics 
Cause it just ain't no thing - oh I said it's been a real long time 

Ain't nothin' wrong, ain't nothin' right 
And still I sit and lie awake all night oh, oh yeah 

Ah Dreddy's got a job to do but he might fulfill his mission 
To see his pain will be his greatest ambition 
We will survive in this world of competition 
Truly God set around the nation - bo bo bo!!!!!!!.......... 

I won't wait so long 
Ooh I said I won't wait so long for you 
Oh oh see now ooh woh 

Stop your messin' around 
Better think of your future 
Time you straighten right out 
Or you'll wind up in jail
