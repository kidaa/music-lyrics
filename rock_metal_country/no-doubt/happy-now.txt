You had the best
But you gave her up
`Cause dependency might interrupt
Idealistic will so hard to please
Put your indecisive mind at ease
You broke the set
Now there's only singles
There's no looking back
This time I meant it

Are you happy now ?
How is st now ?
Are you happy now ?
Are you happy ?

The uncertainty you had of me
Brought clouded shady company
The tenderness habitual
A seldom - fading ritual
You killed the pair
Now only one is breathing
There's no looking back
This time I meant it

Are you happy now ?
How is st now ?
Are you happy now ?
Are you happy ?

No more leaning on your shoulderI won't be there no more bother
If you feel you just might want me
That's to bad I'm not that easy

The contemplator all those years
Now you must adhere
To your new career of liberation
You've been cast all by yourself
You're free at last
You broke the set
Now there's only singles
There's no looking back
This time I meant it

Are you happy now ?
How is st now ?
Are you happy now ?
Are you happy ?

You're by yourself
All by yourself
You have no one else
You're by yourself
