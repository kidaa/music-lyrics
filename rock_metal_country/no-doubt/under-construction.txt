His accent serenades me and presses at the door 
Broken promise to be around for my mind war 
And my accomplishment's interrogating me 
Today's become tomorrow before I wanted it to be 
And desperate discussions 
The start of the destruction 
Our sign, in my mind 
I'll be fine 
I'll be fine 

'Cause I'm under construction everyone 
So you'll have to mind the mess 
I'm under some construction 

I always had to try harder, I never really could keep up 
Sitting in the corner with my illness and bad luck 
But in this humble place I'm feeling like red wine 
And I hope to get better with some time 
I'll be fine 
With some time 
I'll be fine 

'Cause I'm under construction everyone 
So you'll have to mind the mess 
I'm under some construction 

Construction 
Modification 
Motivation 
Of construction 

And the rituals that soothe and disgust me will be gone 
With some time 
I'll be fine 
With some time 
I'll be fine 
I'll be fine 

I'm under construction everyone 
So you'll have to mind the mess 
I'm under some construction 
I'm under construction everyone 
So you'll have to mind the mess 
I'm under some construction 
Under construction 
Construction 
Feel better with some construction
