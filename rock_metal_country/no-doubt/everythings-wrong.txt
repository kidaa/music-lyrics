The bed is made, so is the cake
The frogs are swimming down in the lake
The chairs are stacked and the house is locked
The food is eaten and the boat is docked
The flowers are watered and the glass is filled
The chain is linked, the money's billed
The walls are painted and the bell has rang
What is wrong? Everything!

One, two, three, four
Everything, everything, everything's wrong
Ever stop your bitchin and you want to go on
But if you look at me you laugh and you say
'Why just give me another thing, don't tell me this way'
Everything's wrong
Everything's wrong

Your hat is sewn, the clock is set
The toilet's flushed and the sponge is wet
The lights are on and your shoes are tied
My posters are up and my hair is dyed
The house is built and the records scratched
Your dishes are dirty and your pants are patched
The chrome is shiny and the juice tastes like tang
What is wrong? Everything!

That's all I say, I say no more
So please don't ask for an encore

One, two, three, four
Everything, everything, everything's wrong
Ever stop your bitchin and you want to go on
But if you look at me you laugh and you say
'Why just give me another thing, don't tell me this way'
Everything's wrong
Everything's wrong
Everything's wrong
Everything's wrong
