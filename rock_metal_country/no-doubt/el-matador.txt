Announcer:
Senors and senoritas, welcome to the most anticipated bullfight in Spanish history! 
Today, El Matador Ricardo will face El Toro the bull - the fiercest meanest beast in all of the 
land! 

Matador:
El Matador -comes out of the dust- as the sweet smell of roses and the foul smell of the bulls 
fills the air. 
Today, El Toro faces Don Presarios... 
El Toro the bull -?- -does not think a lot- of the most beautiful woman in all of Spain. 

Chorus: 
I am the matador, and I must fight the bull! 
For my honor, and for my pride! 
It is which I adore, 
And it's so much more than a job 
It's what I live for, it's just a way of life! 

Rosalina: 
Oh Ricardo, don't you love me anymore? 
You cannot fight the bull, for he is fierce and mean 
And he is merciless, 
He will impale you with his horns. 
What about our lives together? 

Chorus: 
I am the matador, and I must fight the bull! 
For my honor, and for my pride! 
It is which I adore, 
And it's so much more than a job 
It's what I live for, it's just a way of life! 

Narrator:
The buzz of nervous excitement fills the stadium, 
As the tension mounts, the crowd rises to their feet. oh! 
The vendors walk the stands, selling at the top of their lungs: 
Popcorn! Peanuts! NACHOS!!! 
The fight begins... 

Assorted Spanish yells 

Fight pause: 
He's got it, he's got it, he's got his pride. 
He's got it, he's got it, deep down inside 
Because the matador, he's got his pride 
The matador, deep down inside 
The matador, he's got his pride 
The matador----------- 

Come on, Fight! Fight! x7 

Narrator: 
It is over. The fight is done. 
But it is not the bull that is the dead one, 
Rosalina lies dead of a broken heart 
The bull and the matador together part.... 

As I left that arena that day, I was confused. 
I saw the matador and I asked him, 'Why did you kill your fiancee?' 

Matador:
I must have done what I have done because today's fight was such a bore, 
I needed to spark up something more... 

Chorus: 
I am the matador, and I must fight the bull! 
For my honor, and for my pride! 
It is which I adore, 
And it's so much more than a job 
It's what I live for, it's just a way of life! 

I am the matador! x7 
I am the matador-e-or-e-or-e-or-e-or-e-or-e-or-e-or!
