originally performed by Donna Summer

I love to love you baby... 

When you're laying so close to me 
there's no place I'd rather you be 
than with me here... 

I love to love you baby... 

Do it to me again and again 
you put me in such an awful spin 
in a spin... 

I love to love you baby... 

Lay your head down real close to me 
soothe my mind and set me free 
set me free... 

I love to love you baby...
