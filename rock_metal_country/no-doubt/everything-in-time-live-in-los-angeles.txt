She asked how we are
She asked If I was all weird again
And of course I am
But I'm trying really hard
So I lied to her
And I was wearing this prisoner face
So deep inside she had to know
Once again I've lost control

For everything, there is a reason
Everything, I hope in time, will come

Lying in your bed
I am a refugee you try to love
But the love that he killed
Keeps coming back and haunting me
Am I wasting all of your time
And all my cute days on regrets?
Is it healthy that we met?

Everything always in time will show
Then we will know it will show
Everything always in time will come

Is it wrong holding in on too much?
To my best friend, my faded lover?
Who knows?

Cinderella Hope
And it's all because he made me laugh
Coincidence or fate
Running towards a catastrophe
Save me

Everything always in time is gone
It'll be gone, we'll be gone
Everything always in time will come
Oh it will come, it will come
For everything there is a reason
I believe for everything there is a reason
And everything always in time will come
