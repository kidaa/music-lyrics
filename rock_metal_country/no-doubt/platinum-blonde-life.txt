I'm closing all the curtains 
So don't you even bother
And I'm calling out the murder
But I'm underneath the covers
But who's fooling who 
With this mood like a train
Watch me roll over
Get out of my way

[Chorus:]
There's a knock on my door
But I'm not gonna open it
I'm gonna close my eyes
And maybe it will go away

I want a platinum blonde life
So I keep bleaching out the colors
I try to do what I oughta
But never drink enough water
Where did my lover go 
I really wish he could stay
I feel it's empty as a widow
I'm gonna sleep it all away

[Repeat chorus]

I'm gonna sleep all trough the day
I'm gonna asleep my life away
I'm gonna sleep all through the day
I'm gonna sleep myself away
I'm gonna close my eyes and maybe it'll go away

[Repeat chorus]

I'm gonna close my eyes and maybe it will go away
