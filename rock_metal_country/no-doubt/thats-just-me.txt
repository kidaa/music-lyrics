You think that I will change 
But you know that will never be 
I'm just that way and that's just me 
Well it's just the way I am 
And I am doing all I can 
Why can't you see I just can't change
Well I could care less what you see 
I'm just nevertheless here for me

You're always getting what you want But you still keep looking 
I guess you're just never getting what you need 
With your eyes wide open 
You still keep looking for your dream 
That's just me

It doesn't matter what you say 
'Cause my confidence will lead the way 
Words will never do, sad but true

Well and if I didn't act this way 
Well it just wouldn't be the same 
That wouldn't do 'cause I'm not you 
I'm not you, no

And I could care less what you see 
I'm just nevertheless here for me

You're always getting what you want 
But you still keep looking 
I guess you're just never getting what you need 
With your eyes wide open 
You still keep looking for your dream 
That's just me 
With your eyes wide open 
You still keep looking for your dream 
That's just me 
That's just me - that's just me

Well it's just the way I am, I am no Larry or a Sam 
Why can't you see, I'm just that way

Well there it is, it's right here, so crystal clear 
Well there it is, it's right here, so crystal clear in front of my face

You're always getting what you want 
But you still keep looking 
I guess you're just never getting what you need 
With your eyes wide open 
You still keep looking 
Eyes wide open, you still keep looking 
With your eyes wide open 
You still keep looking for your dream yeah 
That's just me - hey 
Ah - you're always getting what you want 
But you never get what you need 
You want it 
I guess you just, well you're nevertheless 
Just looking for your dream 
A dream - you're looking for your dream 
You're looking for your dream

I could care less what you see
