I'm the kinda girl that hangs with the guys
Like a fly on the wall with my secret eyes
Takin it in, try to be feminine
With my makeup bag watchin all the sin
Misfit, I sit
Lit up, wicked
Everybody else surrounded by the girls
With the tank tops and the flirty ways

I'm just sippin on chamomile
Watching boys and girls and their sex appeal
With a stranger in the face who says he knows my mom
And went to my high school

[Chorus]
All the boys say,
Hey Baby, Hey Baby, Hey
Girls Say, Girls Say,
Hey Baby, Hey Baby, Hey
Hey Baby Baby
Hey Baby, Hey Baby, Hey
Boys Say, Boys Say
Hey Baby, Hey Baby, Hey
All the boys get the girls in the back

I'm the one they feed upon
Give a bit a star is born
And if you had enough you'll get the pass
And you can tell your friends how you made it back
No matter what they say I'm still the same
Somehow everybody knows my name
And all the girls wanna get with the boys
And the boys really like it

All the boys say,
Hey Baby, Hey Baby, Hey
Girls Say, Girls Say,
Hey Baby, Hey Baby, Hey
Hey Baby Baby
Hey Baby, Hey Baby, Hey
Boys Say, Boys Say
Hey Baby, Hey Baby, Hey
All the boys get the girls in the back

[Bounty Killer]
Check it out, it's Bounty Killer, and No Doubt

Jump on the stage makes me goin crazy
Afterwards myself and one of them gorgeous ladies
There is no need to be actin shady
Comon baby, hey hey baby
[2x]

When you rock your hips you know that it amaze me
Got me off the hook and nothing else don't phase me
Can you be my one and only sunshine lady
If no, no maybe, Hey Baby

[Gwen]
I'm just sippin on chamomile
Watching boys and girls and their sex appeal
With a stranger in the face who says he knows my mom
And went to my high school

[Chorus 2x with some Bounty Killer parts in it]
