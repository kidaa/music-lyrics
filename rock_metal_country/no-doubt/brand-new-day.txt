At the end of the day you are worn out, you are
worn out, and too tired to sleep
But then you do dream of wonderful things
That you might do, right on through to the next
day
And then you wake up
The sun's on your face
You're stretchin' while you're sayin'
It's a Brand New Day!

It's a brand new day and the sky is clear
So let's come together, everybody cheer
Come out people from everywhere
Let's see your faces, the day we'll share
Come on and celebrate a Brand New Day
Everyday!

Call out to the workers and the children in the
schools
It's a day of celebration so put down your tools
and
Celebrate a Brand New Day Everyday!

Come see the mountains and come see the
shores
Mother nature is calling so come climb aboard
and
Celebrate a Brand New Day Everyday! Let's go

At the end of the day there is no doubt you are
worn out
Ooh but then you do dream of wonderful things

Wonderful things you might do

And then you wake up
The sun's on your face 
You're stretchin' while you're sayin'
It's a Brand New Day!

Celebrate a Brand New Day, Everyday!
Celebrate a Brand New Day, Everyday!
