Hey you with the wedding dress on 
Made of white chiffon blowing in the wind 
Hey you with the dreams in your head 
You've been so mislead by your heart's pull 
I know you're waiting for your ship to come in 
You anxiously wait for such a long time 
You're just like my Ken and Barbie Doll 
You dress up and play the game 
You're just like my Ken and Barbie Doll 
You're name will never change 

Hey you with the eyes full of hope 
You think you can rope your desire 
Hey you, you naive thing 
Your patience in time will tire 

I know you're waiting for your tide to roll in 
How did you ever set such high hopes 
You're just like my Ken and Barbie Doll 
You dress up and play the game 
You're just like my Ken and Barbie Doll 

You're name will never change 
You're just like my Ken and Barbie Doll 
In a plastic world of make believe 
You're just like my Ken and Barbie Doll 
You know he's gonna leave
