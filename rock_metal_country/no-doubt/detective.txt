Peek in, sneak about
peek in, sneak about
your broken hearted detective

hey girl save the liar
can't you see his pants on fire
hey girl, save the liar
can't you see his pants on fire

my back it hurts again
it aches like history
cottonmouth and all lit up
your smiling back at me, but

I feel you must have failed me
once again you've let me down
my confidence below my knees
now I need to find you out

[Chorus:]
Peek in, sneak about
I'm gonna snoop and call you out
I've caught you, you're hands are red
Now I'm your broken hearted detective

Hey, hey hey

Hey lover why the gun 
Hold on I'm almost there
It's too late you've killed the trust
Don't act so unaware

Why are you so destructive 
Do you realize what you've done 
you can't bring it back to life now
What are you running from 

[Chorus]

I don't like the way it feels
I just want you to be real

Hey girl, save the liar
Can't you see his pants on fire 
Hey girl, save the liar
Can't you see his pants on fire 

I'm rummaging through your closet
Imagining all the worst thoughts

[Chorus x2]

Peek in, peek in
Peek in, peek in
Peek in, sneak about
I'm gonna snoop and call you out
I've caught you, you're hands are red
Now I'm you're brokenhearted detective
