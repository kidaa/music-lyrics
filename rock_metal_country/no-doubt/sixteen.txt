You've been a juvenile 
With a dolphin smile
With no elbow room 
With your body in bloom 
You've had your little backyard
Protected by big walls 
You didn't dare look over 
'Cause you've been too small 
Now you're finally sixteen 
And you're feeling old 
But they won't believe 
That you've got a soul 

'Cause you're only sixteen 
And you're feeling real 
But you can't seem to cop a feel 
Why do they force us 
Through the metamorphose 

Little butterfly 
No matter how you try 
You'll be segragated
You're gonna be closed off 
You're callow and you're green 

'Cause you're caught between 
You're only sixteen 
Try to cross the line 
But your little wings are intertwined 
You're only sixteen 
And you're such a tease 
And there's nothing you do 

That can really please 
"These children 
They're not really bad most of them 
They're just products 
Of rotten neighborhoods 
And bad family situations" 

You know you can forsake it 
So sit back and take it 
You see you're not just ripe 
So don't try and fight that 
You're only sixteen 

You wanna catch a peek 
But they look at you 
Like you're such a freak 
Well, you're only sixteen 
With a lot to say 
But they won't give you 
The time of day 

You're only sixteen! 
You're only sixteen!! 
You're only sixteen!!! 
You poor little thing
