Your love is like a tidal wave, spinning over my head 
You drown me in your promises, better left unsaid 

You're the right kind of sinner to release my inner fantasies 
The effects of a winner, and you know that you were born to be 
You're my heartbreaker, dream maker, love taker 
Don't you mess around with me 
'Cause you're my heartbreaker, dream maker, love taker 
Don't you mess around, no, no 

Your love has set my soul on fire, burning out of control 
You taught me the ways of desire, now it's taking its toll 

You're the right kind of sinner to release my inner fantasies 
The effects of a winner, and you know that you were born to be 
You're my heartbreaker, dream maker, love taker 
Don't you mess around with me 
'Cause you're my heartbreaker, dream maker, love taker 
Don't you mess around, no, no 

You're the right kind of sinner to release my inner fantasies 
The effects of a winner, and you know that you were born to be 
You're my heartbreaker, dream maker, love taker 
Don't you mess around with me 
'Cause you're my heartbreaker, dream maker, love taker 
Don't you mess around, no, no 

You're my heartbreaker, dream maker, love taker 
Don't you mess around with me 
'Cause you're my heartbreaker, dream maker, love taker, heartbreaker, yeah
