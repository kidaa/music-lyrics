Things can be broken down 
In this world of ours 
You don't have to be a famous person 
Just to make your mark 
A mother can be an inspiration 
To her little son 
Change his thoughts, his mind, his life, 
Just with her gentle hum 
So different, yet so the same 
Two sisters only have their parents to blame 
It's rare that two can get along 
But when they do, they're inseparable 
Such a blessing comes to few 

[Chorus:] 
The sky is full of clouds and 
My world's full of people 
All different kinds with different ways 
It would take a lifetime to explain 
No one's exactly the same 
He and she, two different people 
With two seperate lives 

Then you put the two together 
And get a spectacular surprise 
'Cause one can teach the other 
What she doesn't know 
While still the other fills a place inside 
He never knew had room to grow

[Chorus:] 
Once in a while I sit back 
And think about the planet 
Most of the time I trip on it 
To kick back and think about 
How massive it all is 
And how amy others are on it 

I often think about the world 
In which I live today, of animals and plants 
And nature's gift set in display 
But the most amazing thing 
That I've seen in my time 

Are all the different people 
And all their different minds 
And different ways 
It would take a lifetime to explain 

No one's exactly the same 
So many different people 
So many different kinds 
So many different people 
So many different kinds 

Look at me, I'm a person 
Look at me, I'm my own person 
So many different people 
So many different kinds 
For better or for worse, different people
