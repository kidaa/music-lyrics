Can you hear that whistle
Loud clackety-clack
Well it's calling to me
The station is where it's at
It's coming again now
Chuggin' down that track
Just check your records
Got all my bags packed
You'll always find me waiting for that train to
come through
Come get me, take me, to the land where my
dreams come true
You'll always find me waiting for that train to
come through
Come get me, take me, to the land where my
dreams come true

This time I'll board that train
It won't be long
Check the label on my baggage
Destination in my song
Talk to the conductor
Ooh I save my fare
Yakety-yak for a while
CHOO CHOO!
CHOOECHOO!

You'll always find me waiting for that train to
come through
Come get me, take me, to the land where my
dreams come true
You'll always find me waiting for that train to
come
Come get me, come take me
You'll always find me waiting for that train to
come through
I said come get me, take me, to the land where
your dreams come true I said
I'm waiting, I'm waiting
Come get me, come take me to the land where
my dreams come
Smokestack train is back
That smash attack

Hurry grab my luggage
Hurry grab my bags
It seems the locomotive
Has taken another track
A penny brought by mischief
A penny form of cash
Has been brough up to the railway
We are destined to be a smash!
A smash! Woo!

You will always find me waiting for that train
to come through
Come get me, take me, to the land where my
dreams come true
Always find me waiting for that train to come
Come get me, come take me
You'll always find me waiting for that train to come through
Wrongful manners, tickets for two
I'm waiting for it to show
Ah na na na na na na oh woh woh woh
You'll always find me waiting for that train to
come through
Come get me, come take me
You'll always find me waiting for that train to
come through
I said come get me, take me, to the land where
your dreams come true I said
Ah then you'll always find me, ah then you'll
always find me
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh I said
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh oh
Ah wrongful manner na na na na na na...
