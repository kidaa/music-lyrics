I see you from the distance
From beyond the fence you made
Hiding all your feelings 
Behind your barricade
Oh have you been invaded 
Is this the reason why you hide 
I know just how you're feeling 
I know - let me inside

Open the gate up 
Open the gate up - hurry 
Open the gate up - hurry

I want to get near you 
But you just won't let me in 
'Cause you're so scared of losing 
Everything you've got within

Come on now you can trust me 
Come on and open the door 
'Cause I know just how you're feeling 
I know - I've been there before

Open the gate up 
Open the gate up - hurry 
Open the gate up 
Hurry hurry hurry hurry 
And do it right now 
Do it right now 
Do it right now 
Do it right now - hurry

Do it right now - do it right now 
Do it right now - do it right now 
And do it right now - do it right now 
Do it right now - do it right now 
Hurry

Open the gate up 
Open the gate up - hurry 
Open the gate up 
Hurry hurry hurry hurry 
Open the gate up - open the gate up 
Or I'm gonna knock the damn door down 
Open the gate up - open the gate up 
Or I'm gonna knock the damn door down 
Open the gate up - open the gate up 
Or I'm gonna knock the damn door down 
Open the gate up - open the gate up 
Or I'm gonna knock the damn door down 
Down
