Laughing so hard I've got tears in my eyes
Walk in the park under sapphire skies
Oh I can't believe that you're still around
Almost forgot how you let me down

Crying so deep that I think I might die
Your mistakes I keep in the back of my mind
So hard to let go but I'm coming 'round
The scars are still fragile, don't let me down

So don't blow it, no not a little bit
'Cause now you're all mine
Don't you forget it
Don't blow it, even a little bit
'Cause now you're all mine
Don't you forget it
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down

Time after time it's just too much to take
I've waited so long just to get to this place
And finally it feels like the lost was found
You've got me filled up now don't let me down
Don't let me down

So don't blow it, no not a little bit
'Cause now you're all mine
Don't you forget it
Don't blow it, even a little bit
'Cause now you're all mine
Don't you forget it

So don't blow it, no not a little bit
'Cause now you're all mine
Don't you forget it
Don't blow it, even a little bit
'Cause now you're all mine
Don't you forget it
Don't let me down

So don't blow it, no not a little bit
'Cause now you're all mine
Don't you forget it
Don't blow it, even a little bit
'Cause now you're all mine
Don't you forget it

So don't blow it, no not a little bit
'Cause now you're all mine
Don't you forget it
Don't blow it, even a little bit
'Cause now you're all mine
Don't you forget it

Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
