[Billy] Kill that drummer 
[Gwen Well I've got a friend who's a man 
[Billy] Who's a man? 
[Gwen What man? A man who keeps me from the lonely, the lonely 
He gives me what I need 
[Billy] What you need? 
[Gwen What you got? 
I need it all so badly 

 Anything I want, anything, he gives it to me 
Anything I want, anything, but not ..., he gives it, 
[Both] but not for free 
[Gwen It's hateful, it's hateful 
[Both] And it's paid for, and I'm so grateful to be nowhere 

[Gwen This year I've lost some friends 
[Billy] Some friends? 
[Gwen What friends? I don't know, I ain't even noticed 
You see, I gotta go out again 
[Billy] Again? 
[Gwen] My friend, I gotta go see the madman ? 
 Oh, 
[Both] anything I want, anything, 
[Gwen] he gives it to me 
[Both] Anything I want, anything, but not ..., 
[Gwen] he gives it, but not for free 
It's hateful, it's hateful 
And it's paid for, 
[Both] and I'm so grateful to be nowhere 

[Gwen] Anything I want, anything, he gives it to me 
Anything I want, anything, but not ..., he gives it, but not for free 
It's hateful, it's hateful 
And it's paid for, and I'm so grateful to be nowhere 

 I killed all my nerves 
[Billy] My nerves? 
[Gwen] What swerves? I can't drive so steady 
Oh, I lost my memory, memory 
[Billy] My mind 
[Gwen] Behind 
I can't see so clearly 

 Oh, anything I want, anything, he gives it to me 
Anything I want, anything, but not ..., he gives it, but not for free 
[Billy] It's not for free 
[Gwen] Anything, he gives it to me 
Anything I want, anything, but not ..., he gives it, but not for free 
[Billy] It's not for free 
[Gwen] Anything, he gives it to me, anything, 
[Billy] not for free, 
[Gwen] he gives it to me 
Not for free, not for free, 
[Billy] it's not for free, 
[Gwen] not for free, not for free, 
[Billy] it's not for free, 
[Gwen] not for free 
[Billy] It's not for you, it's for me
