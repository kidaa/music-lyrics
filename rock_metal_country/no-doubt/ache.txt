Woke up this morning and felt no too cool -
ooh ooh ooh ooh
'Cause every time I tried to make my mouth
move - ooh ooh ooh ooh
The pain I'm having is so discomforting 
Please make this suffering go away
Wo wo wo wo I told my mom what I was
feeling
And how long I've been dealing with it
I knew it was coming, but didn't know how
soon
She said I've reached another adolescent
monsoon - oon

OOoo Ahh... the pain is tremendous
Why can't I take it like a man
OOoo Ahh... the pain is horrendous
Why can't you lend a helpin' hand

He was a well-educated man, had his degree in
medicine
I noticed his hairy hands... he was a very, very
hairy man
He looked right down in, shook his head and
then said
"these teeth must be pulled right away hey!"

OOoo Ahh... the pain is tremendous
Why can't I take it like a man
OOoo Ahh... the pain is horrendous
Why can't you lend a helpin' hand
OOoo Ahh... the pain is tremendous
Why can't I take it like a man
OOoo Ahh... the pain is horrendous
Why can't you lend a helpin' hand

He turned around, rolled up his sleeve
I rolled my eyes then suddenly
A horrible pain grew, the next thing that I
knew
The doc had pulled my wisdom teeth... OUT!
Well along with my teeth my money also left
me
As he made out the bill, I was moaning
OOoo Ahh... the pain is tremendous
Where the hell is my prescription.... of
codeine

Ooh but when will I speak, how long until my
mouth feels natural
How long will they bleed, when will they heal,
where's the real meal
How do you feel How do you feel How do
you feel How do you feel
How do you feel How do you feel How do
you feel How do you feel
How do you feel How do you feel How do
you feel How do you feel
How do you feel How do you feel How do
you feel How do you feel

I feel good... I feel great... there's no pain...
there's no ache
I feel good... I feel great... just let me
recuperate
I feel good... I feel great... there's no pain...
there's no ache
I feel good... I feel great... just let me
recuperate

Because the codeine has left me drowsy, leave
me be... just let me sleep!
