performed live by No Doubt 

That's great, it starts with an earthquake. 
Birds and snakes, an aeroplane and Lenny Bruce is not afraid. 
Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn. 
World serves its own needs, dummy serve your own needs. 
Feed it off an aux speak, grunt, no, strength, no, 
Ladder start to clatter with fear fight down height. 
Fire in a wire, representing seven games. 
A government for hire and a combat site. 
Left of west and coming in a hurry, 
With the furies breathing down your neck. 
Team by team reporters baffled, trumped, tethered cropped. 
Look at that low playing! Fine, then. 
Uh oh, overflow, population, common food, but it'll do. 
Save yourself, serve yourself, world serves its own needs. 
Listen to your heart bleed dummy with the rapture. 
And the revered and the right, right. 
You vitriolic, patriotic, slam, fight, 
Bright light, feeling pretty psyched. 

It's the end of the world as we know it. 
It's the end of the world as we know it. 
It's the end of the world as we know it 
But I feel fine. 

Six o'clock - TV hour, don't get caught in foreign towers. 
Slash and burn, return, listen to yourself churn. 
Locking in, uniforming, book burning, blood letting. 
Every motive escalate. Automotive incinerate. 
Light a candle, light a votive. Step down, step down. 
Watch your heel crush, crushed, uh oh, this means no fear cavalier. 
Renegade steer clear! A tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies. 
Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives, I decline. 

It's the end of the world as we know it. 
It's the end of the world as we know it. 
It's the end of the world as we know it. 
I feel fine. 
I feel fine. 

The other night I dreamt of knives, continental drift divide. 
Mountains sit in a line, Leonard Bernstein. 
Leonid Brezhnev, Lenny Bruce and Lester Bangs. 
Birthday party, cheesecake, jelly bean, boom! 
You symbiotic, patriotic, slam book neck, right? Right. 

It's the end of the world as we know it. 
It's the end of the world as we know it. 
It's the end of the world as we know it. 
I feel fine. 

It's time, I spent some time alone. 
It's time, I spent some time alone. 
It's time, I spent some time alone. 

It's the end of the world as we know it. 
It's the end of the world as we know it. 
It's the end of the world as we know it 
I feel fine.
