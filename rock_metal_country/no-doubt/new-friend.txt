Mind my own business
I'm on my journey
And I enough old friends
To keep me company

To say hey what's up
You want to hook up
You wanna hang out with me
Kick back, relax, feel happy and lazy

You sent to me, one time
You come to me, two times
Why me? A-three times

Abracadabra now I've got a new friend
Let me introduce you to my new friend
Whoa, I got a new friend
Let me introduce you to my new friend
Whoa, I got a new friend

Mind my own business,
I'm on my journey

Eye against eye on my journey
We're happily interrupted
Extremes are extremes
With my brand new friend
We test the boundaries
Like a little kitties whiskers cautiously
Experimental expression downward looks
You come and sniff around
I'm not sure what to do
Like a big explosion
Magically look at me
I think I might have found a new friend

Let me introduce you to my new friend
Whoa, I got a new friend
Let me introduce you to my new friend
Whoa, I got a new friend

Mind my own business
I'm on my journey
Ah shit
Mind my own business
I'm on my journey
Ah shit

You sent to me, one time
You come to me, two times
Why me? A-three times

Serial monogamy, I've got a new friend!

[repeat chorus]

Mind my own business
I'm on my journey
And I enough old friends
To keep me company

To say hey what's up,
You want to hook up
You wanna hang out with me
Kick back, relax, feel happy and lazy

It's in my head
It's only in my head
It's in my head
It's only in my head
