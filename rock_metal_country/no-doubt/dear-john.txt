My friend you're gone
Someday I hope we meet again

I look unto the left and then I look unto the right
I see your faded figure almost every single night
Is my imagination playing tricks on me
But in my heart you see, you will always be

My friend, you're gone
Someday I hope we meet again

You're singing in a band with a mic on in your hand
The way that you would sing really made me feel all grand
You left your friends alone right upon this earth
I wish that would've seen how much life was worth

My friend, yeh yeah, you're gone
Someday, someday, someday, now, I hope we meet again

Yeah iyeah, I hope we meet again, now
Hey yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh

Well, Johnny made us laugh but now he made us cry
It couldn't have been that bad to make him want to die
Now it's too late to find your destiny
I wish you would've waited longer here with me

My friend, yeah yeah, you're gone
Someday I hope we meet again
My friend you're gone
Someday, someday, someday, now, I hope we meet again
I hope we meet again
