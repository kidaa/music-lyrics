Baby, baby, baby
I know that I've been mad in love before
but how I can be with you
You really hurt me baby, you really cut me baby
How could you have a day without a night
you're the book that I have opened
and now I've gotten so much more

Baby, baby
The curiousness of your potential kiss
has got my mind and body aching
You really hurt me baby, you really cut me baby
How could you have a day without a night
you're the book that I have opened
and now I've gotten so much more...ohhh
oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Like a soul without a mind, and a body without a heart
and I'm every missing every part..heyyyyeah

Heyyyyiiii,
Like a soul without a mind, and a body without a heart
and I'm every missing every part
Like a soul without a mind, and a body without a heart
and I'm every missing every part
Like a soul without a mind, and a body without a heart
and I'm every missing every part
You really hurt me baby, you really hurt me baby
Like a soul without a mind, and a body without a heart
I'm missing every part
Ohhhh...heyyy
