IT`S TIME TO FACE THE MUSIC
TONIGHT I CAME TO USE IT
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHO YOU`RE GONNA MEET IN THERE

I THOUGHT I`D NEVER FIND HIM
THE DARK AND HANDSOME KIND
I USED TO DREAM OF
AND NOW YOU`RE STADING THERE
THOUGH YOU`RE LOOKING GOOD TO ME
IT DOESN`T MEAN THAT YOU CAN DO AS YOU PLEASE

[CHORUS]
OH BABY YOU`RE THE BEST THING IN MY LIFE
BUT A ONE TRACK MIND IS WHAT YOU GOT
OH BABY YOU`RE MY BEST BET HERE TONIGHT
AND A ONE TRACK MIND IS WORTH ALOT
I`VE GOT NO GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE WELL LAST FOR LONG
BUT THAT`S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME TILL THE RIGHT MAN COMES ALONG

I`VE WAITED FOR A LOVER
THE KIND WHO`LL STAY FOREVER
YOU LOOK TO ME
LIKE THE SORT OF MAN I NEED
IT`S NOT THE BEST SCENARIO
BUT NOW I`VE FOUND YOU I`M NOT LETTING YOU GO

[CHORUS]

OH BABY YOU`RE THE BEST THING IN MY LIFE
BUT A ONE TRACK MIND IS WHAT YOU GOT
OH BABY YOU`RE MY BEST BET HERE TONGHT
AND A ONE TRACK MIND IS WORTH ALOT
FOR THE PERFECT GUY MAYBE I SHOULD HOLDING ON
AND WITH YOU I COULD TILL THE RIGHT MAN COMES ALONG
TILL THE RIGHT MAN COMES ALONG

[CHORUS]
