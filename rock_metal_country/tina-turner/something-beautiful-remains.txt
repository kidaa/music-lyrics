Tears will leave no stains
Time will ease the pain
For every life that fades
Something beautiful remains

We're living in world, stars and dust
Between heaven 'n all that surrounds us
We're travellers here, spirits passing through
And the love we give, is all that will endure
Hey now, what we had is gone
But I still remember you
Just like a rose after the rain
Something beautiful remains

Tears will leave no stains
Time will ease the pain
For every life that fades
Something beautiful remains

Now the darkness falls
sun's going down
one by one, the stars are coming out
tide comes in, washes footprints from the sand
one day ends, a new day must begin
Hey now, though we are apart
You're forever in my dreams
Hey now, love is lost again
What u gonna do about it,
what u gonna say
Something beautiful remains

Tears will leave no stains
Time will ease the pain
For every life that fades
Something beautiful remains

And you wonder sometimes how we carry on
When you've lost the love the knew
But it's alright, it's alright
To your own heart be true

Tears will leave no stains
Time will ease the pain
For every life that fades
Something beautiful remains.
