YOU SAY YOU WANT TO LIVE SOME
MOVE OUT INTO THE FAST LANE
YOU SAY YOU NEED EXCITEMENT
TO MAKE YOU COME ALIVE
SOME PLACE A MILLIONS MILES FROM
THE SHADOWS THAT SURROUND YOU

I LOOK FOR YOUR ATTENTION
YOU`RE LOST OUT IN THE FUTURE
WHERE LOVERS ASK NO QUESTIONS
AND SHADOWS NEVER FALL
SOME PILGRIM BOUND FOR PARADISE
NO COMPROMISE

BUT PARADISE IS HERE
IT`S TIME TO STOP YOUR CRYING
THE FUTURE IS THIS MOMENT
AND NOT SOME PLACE OUT THERE
TONIGHT I NEED YOUR LOVE
DON`T TALK ABOUT TOMORROW
RIGHT NOW I NEED YOUR LOVING
RIGHT NOW GIVE IT TO ME
RIGHT NOW I WANT YOUR LOVING
RIGHT NOW - NOW NOW NOW

YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR NEW PLANS
TO MOVE ON UP THE STAIRWAY
YOU DREAM ABOUT THE HIGHLIFE
THAT`S WAITING FOR YOU THERE
A WORLD OF FAME AND FORTUNE
THAT`S JUST AROUND THE CORNER
BUT I DON`T NEED NO HIGH LIFE
TO MAKE ME FEEL A WOMAN
AND I DON`T NEED TO REACH FOR
NO CASTLES IN THE SKY
JUST PUT YOUR ARMS AROUND ME
DEVOUR ME

'COS PARADISE IS HERE
IT`S TIME TO STOP YOUR CRYING
THE FUTURE IS THIS MOMENT
AND NOT SOME PLACE OUT THERE
TONIGHT I NEED YOUR LOVE
DON`T TALK ABOUT TOMORROW
RIGHT NOW I NEED YOUR LOVING
RIGHT NOW GIVE IT TO ME
RIGHT NOW I WANT YOUR LOVING
RIGHT NOW - NOW NOW NOW
