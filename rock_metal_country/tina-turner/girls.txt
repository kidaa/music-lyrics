GIRLS, WE COME AND WE GO
WE KISS, COME AND WE GO
LIKE A BREEZE, BRUSHING YOUR CHEEK
LIKE PAIN, LIKE TEARS ON THE FACE

GIRLS, WE COME AND WE GO
LIKE SPIRIT, VANISH AT DAWN
MY HEART, SUSPENDED IN TIME
LIKE YOU, VANISH LIKE TEARS ON THE RAIN

GIRLS, WE TAKE OUR LOVES AWAY
LIKE SPIRITS, LIVING SO FAR AWAY
GIRLS, PRETENDING TO BREAK DOWN AND CRY
GIRLS, WHISPERING WIND, WHAT ARE WE GIVING AWAY

WE USED TO BE SO HAPPY
REMEMBER, REMEMBER, SO HAPPY
I NEVER KNEW, HOW LONELY, HOW LONELY
HOW LONELY COULD FEEL

GIRLS, WE COME AND WE GO
WE KISS, COME AND WE GO
LIKE A BREEZE, BRUSHING YOUR CHEEK
LIKE PAIN, LIKE TEARS ON THE FACE

GIRLS, WE TAKE OUR LOVES AWAY
LIKE SPIRITS, LIVING SO FAR AWAY
GIRLS, PRETENDING TO BREAK DOWN AND CRY
GIRLS, WHISPERING WIND, WHAT ARE WE GIVING AWAY

REMEMBER, REMEMBER, SO HAPPY
I NEVER KNEW, HOW LONELY, HOW LONELY
HOW LONELY COULD FEEL
