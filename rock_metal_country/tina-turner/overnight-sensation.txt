WELL I GUESS I`VE BEEN A LONG TIME
WORKING IN THE BACKLINE
TRYIN` TO MAKE A SONG FIT
YOU KNOW IT NEVER WAS MINE
TWO DOLLAR HI-HEEL SHOES AND A HONKY TONK DRESS
IN THE RHYTHM AN THE SOUL REVUES
I HAD A DREAM I GUESS
YES YES

AND I HAD TO BEAT THE STAGEFRIGHT
I HAD TO CRY ALL NIGHT
TRYIN` TO MAKE A SONG FIT
YOU KNOW IT NEVER WAS MINE
I SAID GIRL, GET UP AND GET OUT OF THIS MESS
YOU`RE GONNA BE AN OVERNIGHT SENSATION
BE AN OVERNIGHT SUCCESS

AND ALL THROUGH THE BADLANDS
ROCKING ON THE BANDSTANDS
IT`S SO HARD IN THE BAR BANDS
THAN THERE`S NOONE THERE WHO UNDERSTANDS
AND LADY LUCK`LL PASS HER BY
AND SHE`LL NEVER SAY YES
YOU`RE GONNA BE AN OVERNIGHT SENSATION
GONNA BE AN OVERNIGHT SUCCESS

WELL I USED TO BE A SWEET LITTLE ROCK`N`ROLL SINGER
CHASING AFTER FORTUNE AND FAME
WHAT`S YOUR STORY WHAT`S YOUR PAYOLA
ME I`M IN THE MUSIC GAME

WELL I GUESS I`VE BEEN A LONG TIME
WORKING IN THE BACKLINE
TRYIN` TO MAKE A SONG FIT
YOU KNOW IT NEVER WAS MINE
WHAT CAN I TELL YOU
I MADE A BREAK I GUESS
NOW I`M AN OVERNIGHT SENSATION
I`M AN OVERNIGHT
I`M AN OVERNIGHT SUCCESS
