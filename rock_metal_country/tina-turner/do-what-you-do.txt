When you say the things you say you gotta mean it
and when you do the things you do, it's gotta come from the heart

Something's gone, I can't explain.
The heat is missing from the flame 
can't deny it, there's a link missing from the chain...uhuh
There's something wrong with you and me
when one and one adds up to three
Don't know the reason, but the fact is plain to see ...uhuh

It's the touch that you lose, and the words you don't say
it's the love you refuse, don't you throw it away
When you do what you do that like you to me
don't you know that it ain't enough
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing
when you do what you do without love, without love

I'm gonna paint a picture of you
The only colour I need is blue
You're out of love, baby you know it's true...uhuh
Tell me why and I'll try to understand
Cos I could cry when you do what you do to me
Don't you know that it ain't enough
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing
When you do what you do without love....aaaahhhh
It's the touch that you lose, and the words you don't say
It's the love you refuse, don't you throw it away
When you do what you do what you do to me
Don't you know that it ain't enough
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing
Then you know it's a crime that you're guilty of
When you do what you do without love, without love
Don't know what you're doing, what you're doing with our love

When you do what you it dont' mean a thing
don't mean a thing...do, got to do it with love
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing
don't mean a thing...do it, gotta do it with love
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing
don't mean a thing...do it, gotta do it with love
