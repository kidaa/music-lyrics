YOU MUST UNDERSTAND
THAT THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND
MAKES MY PULSE REACT
THAT IT`S ONLY THAT THRILL
OF BOY MEETING GIRL
OPPOSITES ATTRACT

IT`S PHYSICAL
ONLY LOGICAL
YOU MUST TRY TO IGNORE
THAT IT MEANS MORE THAN THAT

[CHORUS]
OH WHATS LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT
WHAT`S LOVE BUT A SECOND HAND EMOTION
WHAT`S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT
WHO NEEDS A HEART
WHEN A HEART CAN BE BROKEN

IT MAY SEEM TO YOU
THAT I`M ACTING CONFUSED
WHEN YOU`RE CLOSE TO ME
IF I TEND TO LOOK DAZED
I`VE READ IT SOMEPLACE
I`VE GOT CAUSE TO BE

THERE`S A NAME FOR IT
THERE`S A PHRASE FOR IT
BUT WHATEVER THE REASON
YOU DO IT FOR ME

[CHORUS]

I`VE BEEN THINKING OF A NEW DIRECTION
BUT I HAVE TO SAY
I`VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT MY OWN PROTECTION
IT SCARES ME TO FEEL THAT WAY

WHAT`S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT
WHAT`S LOVE BUT A SWEET OLD FASHIONED NOTION
WHAT`S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT
WHO NEEDS A HEART WHEN A HEART CAN BE BROKEN
