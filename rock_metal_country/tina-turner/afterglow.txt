I NEED YOU HERE BESIDE ME TO CHASE THE NIGHT AWAY
I NEED YOUR LOVE TO GUIDE ME SAFE THROUGH ANOTHER DAY
I LIE AN WATCH THE LIGHTS GO DOWN
SAY GOODNIGHT TO ANOTHER TOWN
AND THOUGH IT HURTS TO BE ALONE
I HAVE MY THOUGHTS OF YOU TO KEEP ME WARM

IN THE AFTERGLOW OF YOUR LOVE
DREAMINGS ALL I`M GUILTY OF
EVERYDAY I`M PLAYING TOUGH
BUT READ MY MIND

[CHORUS]
IF YOU COULD SEE ME NOW
JUST LIVING MY LIFE IN A LIMBO
IF YOU COULD SEE ME NOW
THE ME THAT ONLY YOU WOULD KNOWAFTERGLOW
STILL BURNING IN THE AFTERGLOW

WHEN THE BEAT OF THE DRUM HAS FADED
THE SHOW COMES TO AN END
THE STAGE IS CLEARED AND LOADED
AND THE HIGHWAY CALLS AGAIN
I STAND AND WATCH THE LIGHTS GO DOWN

[CHORUS]

STAY WITH ME RIGHT TO THE END
TILL I CAN HOLD YOU AGAIN

[CHORUS]
