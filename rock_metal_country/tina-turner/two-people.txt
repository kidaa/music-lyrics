TWO PEOPLE LIVING ON THE EDGE OF LIFE
ARE PEOPLE RUNNING OUT OF DREAMS AND TIME
I CAN HEAR IT WHEN YOU TELL ME SO
I CAN FEEL IT BUT I CAN`T LET GO

[CHORUS]
TWO PEOPLE GOTTA STICK TOGETHER
LOVE ONE ANOTHER
SAVE IT FOR A RAINY DAY
SOME PEOPLE GOTTA STAY WHATEVER
GIVE ONE ANOTHER
SHELTER ON A RAINY DAY

TWO PEOPLE LIVING IN THE WAY WE DO
ARE PEOPLE TRYING TO KEEP A LOVE ANEW
WHAT TO DO TO MAKE SOME SENSE OF IT
WHAT TO DO TO MAKE THE FEELING FIT

[CHORUS]

I`LL COME RUNNING TO YOUR RESCUE
YOU GOTTA STAND BY ME
THERE`S ALOT OF LOVE BETWEEN US
WE SHOULD NEVER LET GO

[CHORUS]
