I`M A NEW PAIR OF EYES
EVERY TIME I AM BORN
AN ORIGINAL MIND
BECAUSE I JUST DIED
I`M SCANNING THE HORIZON
FOR SOMEONE RECOGNIZING
THAT I MIGHT HAVE BEEN QUEEN
FOR EVERY SUN THAT SETS
THERE IS A NEW ONE DAWNING
FOR EVERY EMPIRE CRUSHED
THERE IS A NEW NATION
LET THE WATERS RISE
I HAVE RIDDEN EACH TIDE
FROM THE GATES OF THE CITY
WHERE THE FIRST BORN DIED

AND I MIGHT HAVE BEEN QUEEN
I REMEMBER THE GIRL IN THE FIELDS WITH NO NAME
SHE HAD A LOVE
OH BUT THE RIVERS WON`T STOP FOR ME

I`M A NEW PAIR OF EYES
AN ORIGINAL MIND
WITH MY SENSES OF OLD
AND THE HEART OF A GIANT
AND I`M SEARCHING THROUGH THE WRECKAGE
FOR SOME RECOLLECTION
THAT I MIGHT HAVE BEEN QUEEN
FOR EVERY SAGE THAT FALLS
THERE IS AN ANCIENT CHILD

AND I MIGHT HAVE BEEN QUEEN
I REMEMBER THE GIRL IN THE FIELDS WITH NO NAME
SHE HAD A LOVE
OOOOOH BUT THE RIVERS WON`T STOP FOR ME
NO, THE RIVERS WON`T STOP FOR ME

I LOOK UP TO THE STARS
WITH MY PERFECT MEMORY
I LOOK THROUGH IT ALL
AND MY FUTURE`S NO SHOCK TO ME
I LOOK DOWN BUT I SEE NO TRAGEDY
I LOOK UP TO MY PAST
A SPIRIT RUNNING FREE
I LOOK DOWN AND I`M THERE IN HISTORY
I`M A SOUL SURVIVOR

A SOUL SURVIVOR
ON THE RIVER
BUT IT WON`T STOP
I`M A SOUL SURVIVOR
ON THE RIVER
BUT IT WON`T STOP
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN QUEEN
I KNOW THE SECRET COMBINATION
I`M A SOUL SURVIVOR
