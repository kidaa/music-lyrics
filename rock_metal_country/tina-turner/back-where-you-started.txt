BABY TELL ME WHAT YOU`RE TRYING TO PROVE
PLAYING GAMES WITH MY HEART
HEY NOW LISTEN - I AIN`T GONNA TAKE IT ONE MORE NIGHT
YOU`RE THE ONE WHO BROKE THE RULES
I`M THE ONE WHO PLAYED THE FOOL
NOW YOU`RE TRYIN` TO TELL ME IT`S ALRIGHT
YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER THAN TO HURT A FRIEND
YOU`LL NEVER GET A CHANCE AGAIN
YOU`LL BE...

[CHORUS]
...BACK WHERE YOU STARTED
I KNOW YOU WON`T ADMIT IT BUT YOU`RE BROKEN HEARTED
BACK WHERE YOU STARTED
YOU THINK IT`S GONNA BE EASY
BUT IT JUST GETS HARDER, HARDER

OOH YOU HAD A WAY WITH WORDS
ONE LOOK AND I WAS UNDER YOUR SPELL
I DIDN`T KNOW SHOULD I GO OR SHOULD I RUN
YOU CAN`T DENY THAT YOU TOLD ME LIES
LOVE `EM AND LEAVE `EM THATS YOUR STYLE
I`M NOT AFRAID TO TAKE LIFE AS IT COMES
YOU PLAY WITH FIRE I GUESS YOU`LL NEVER LEARN
YOU MESS WITH ME BABE YOU`RE GONNA GET BURNED

[CHORUS]
YOU`LL BE
BACK WHERE YOU STARTED
THAN YOU`LL KNOW HOW IT FEELS WHEN YOU`VE BEEN DISCARDED
YOU`LL BACK WHERE YOU STARTED
YOU THINK YOU GOT IT MADE BUT IT WON`T GET YOU FAR
NO IT WON`T GET YOU FAR
BACK WHERE YOU STARTED

WHO`S GONNA HELP YA
THROW YOU A LIFETIME
I`LL TELL YOU ONE THING

YOU`VE REALLY DONE IT THIS TIME
YOU TOOK YOUR ONE CHANCE
AND LET IT SLIP AWAY OH YA

YOU`RE NOT THAT KIND WHO`LL EVER SETTLE DOWN
THE RUMOUR`S GETTING OUT ALL OVER TIME
YOU`LL BE...

[CHORUS]

BACK WHERE YOU STARTED
