[CHORUS]
I CAN`T STAND THE RAIN
AGAINST MY WINDOW
BRINGING BACK SWEET MEMORIES
I CAN`T STAND THE RAIN
AGAINST MY WINDOW
BECAUSE HERE`S NOT HERE WITH ME

HEY WINDOW PAIN
DO YOU REMEMBER
HOW SWEET IT USED TO BE
WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER
EVERYTHING WAS SO GRAND
NOW THAT WE`VE PARTED
THERE`S ONE SOUND THAT I JUST CAN`T STAND

[CHORUS]
