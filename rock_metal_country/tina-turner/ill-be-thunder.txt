THERE`LL BE A STORM ONE NIGHT
THEN I WILL FLY TO YOU FOR SHELTER
SOAKED IN WELCOME RAIN
FALLING TO FORBIDDEN ARMS

TOO BREATHLESS
TOO HELPLESS
TOO RESTLESS TO EXPLAIN
NEEDING YOU...

THERE`LL BE A STORM ONE NIGHT
BY YOU WILL FIND MY PLACE OF HIDING
WE`LL WATCH THE LIGHTS LIKE CHILDREN
LEAVE THE FORTRESS HAND IN HAND

I`LL BE THUNDER
YOU`LL BE LIGHTNING
AND WE`LL COLLIDE ON DRY LAND

THERE`LL BE A STORM ONE NIGHT
AND I WILL FIND NO OTHER RESCUE
LOST AND FAR FROM HOME
CRYING FOR SOME GUIDING LIGHT

TOO RECKLESS
TOO HELPLESS
TO HUNGRY TO REFRAIN
FROM NEEDING YOU

THERE`LL BE A STORM ONE NIGHT
THE WIND WILL DRIVE ME TO YOUR CASTLE
AND YOU`LL IGNITE THE FIRE
JUST AS IF EVERYTHING WERE PLANNED

I`LL BE THUNDER
YOU`LL BE LIGHTNING
AND WE`LL COLLIDE ON DRY LAND

NO BETRAYAL
NO DENIAL, NO NEED TO EXPLAIN
WE`LL COLLIDE
