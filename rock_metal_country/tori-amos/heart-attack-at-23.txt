"I don't know why I did it. 
Took the keys to my brother's car. 
Why should I hang around here anymore? 
Hey, just put my foot on the floor. Yeah." 

Sirens wake me up 
Wake me up with a cry 
Things we do for attention 
Just a little reminder dear 
I am still alive 

So confused 
I almost threw it all away for you 
You took me higher 
And you dropped me lower 
Than I've ever been before 

If I have a heart attack at 23 
I'm loving you too much 
If I have a heart attack at 23 
Wave bye-bye 
You'll miss me 
You'll miss me baby 
If I have a heart attack at 23 

All my friends, yeah 
We waste so much love on our men 
Why can't I be forgiving 
While he been out a-messin' 
With his Argentine baby 

If I have a heart attack at 23 
I'm loving you too much 
If I have a heart attack at 23 
Wave bye-bye 
You'll miss me 
You'll miss me baby 
If I have a heart attack at 23 

I must be dreaming 
We were together 
In a land of scarlet ribbon 
That tied you to me darlin' 

Roll roll roll roll on 
But you know I'm never satisfied 
Roll roll roll roll on 
With all the good things in my life 
Roll roll roll roll on 
I thought I needed you to be strong 
Roll roll roll roll on 
I'll still miss you when I'm gone 

If I have a heart attack at 23 
I'm loving you too much 
If I have a heart attack at 23 
Wave bye-bye 
You'll miss me 
You'll miss me baby 
If I have a heart attack at 23
