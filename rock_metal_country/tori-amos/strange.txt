strange 
thought i knew you well 
thought i had read the sky 
thought i had read a change 
in your eyes to strange 
woke up to a world 
that i am not a part 
except when i can play 
it's stranger 
after all what were you really looking for 
and i wonder when will i learn 
blue isn't red everybody knows this

and i wonder when will i learn 
when will i learn 
guess i was in 
deeper than i thought i was 
if i have enough love 
for the both of us

"just stay" 
you said "we'll build a nest" 
so i left my life
tried on your friends 
tried on your opinions. 
so when the bridges froze 
and you did not come home 
i put our snowflake 
under a microscope 
after all what was i really looking for 
and i wonder when will i learn 
maybe my wish knew better than i did 
and i wonder so strange now 
i'm finally in 
the party has begun 
it's not like i can't feel you still 
but strange what i will leave behind 
you call me one more time 
but now i must be leaving
