Because I like you
'cause I like you
Porcupine
Burrow your way
To freedom

Eat your greens
Feed your head
Mind the doubts
They harvest them
Broccoli
Feed your head
Their ideas
Are fried in fat

This is your posse bonus
This is your extra
This is your posse bonus
'cause I like you

Because I like you
'cause I like you
Porcupine
Burrow your way
To freedom

You say that "you're not bothered
To lie beneath pigs
Then go on Laura
Here's a flower for your grave"

This is your posse bonus

I like you
