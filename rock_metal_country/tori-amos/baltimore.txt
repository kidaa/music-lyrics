It's so nice to live here 
I'm glad this is my home 
I've got a homestead on Baltimore Street 
It's someplace to call my own 

It's all kinds of people 
Familiar places, smiling faces 
I'm proud to say I'm a Baltimorian 
But the 'Birds' are the best 
The best of Baltimore 

We like it here in Baltimore 
There's so much love in Baltimore 
Working hand in hand 
To make this place a better land 
In Baltimore 
Love is what you'll find 
So stop and take the time 
I've got Oriole Baseball on my mind 

We like it here in Baltimore 
There's so much love in Baltimore 
Working hand in hand 
To make this place a better land 
In Baltimore 
Love is what you'll find 
So stop and take the time 
To enjoy the brotherhood of Baltimore 

The sun sets across the bay 
I'm glad I spend my day 
In a working American city 
With all the people who make it that way 
It's time to jump in a taxi 
For Thirty-third Street 
Knowing I'll be watching those 'Birds' go, 
Watching Weaver's Show 

We like it here in Baltimore 
There's so much love in Baltimore 
Working hand in hand 
To make this place a better land 
In Baltimore 
Love is what you'll find 
So stop and take the time 
I've got Oriole Baseball on my mind 
On my mind in Baltimore
