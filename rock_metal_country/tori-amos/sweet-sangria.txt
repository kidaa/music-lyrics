i know 
you know every desperado 
and sharp shooter 
in the west you say 
that i can't see behind 
the mask of those who call themselves 
the good guys 
in this who take and take 
"so are you with me or not you say 
this time decide" 
balmy days sweet sangria 
she's been gone 
have you seen her 
seorita shyly turning away 
leaving me our fading flame 
yeah you think you that 
what you believe in 
it matters now to you and me
what you believe in i'm takin' in 
i said i'm takin' in 
what you believe in 
it matters now to you and me 
before sundown the mexicans leave san antone 
the car will then drop him at the border 
the breaking point 
i know your people have suffered 
time and time again 
but what about i ask you now 
the innocents on both sides 
balmy days so you give me 
a no window i ask you, 
give me a bloodless road 
tell me why does someone have to lose
