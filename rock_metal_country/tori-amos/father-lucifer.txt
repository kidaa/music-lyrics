Father Lucifer
You never looked so sane
You always did prefer the drizzle to the rain
Tell me that you're still in love with that Milkmaid
How's the Lizzies
How's your Jesus christ been hanging

Nothings gonna stop me from floating
Nothings gonna stop me from floating

He says he reckons I'm a watercolour stain
He says I run and then I run from him
And then I run
He didn't see me watching
From the aeroplane
He wiped a tear
And then he threw away our appleseed

Nothings gonna stop me from floating
Nothings gonna stop me from floating

Everyday's my wedding day
Though baby's still in his comatose state
I'll die my own Easter eggs
Don't go yet
Just don't go
And Beenie lost the sunset but that's OK
Does Joe bring flowers to Marilyn's grave
And girls that eat pizza and never gain weight
Never gain weight
Never gain weight
Father Lucifer you never looked so sane
You always did prefer the drizzle to the rain
Tell me that you're still in love with that milkmaid
How's the Lizzies
How's your Jesus Chirst been hanging
