I know what you want 
The magpies have come 

If you know me so well then tell me which hand I use 

Make them go 
Make it go 

Saw her there in a restaurant 
Poppy don't go 
I know your mother is a good one but Poppy don't go 
I'll take you home 
Show me the things I've been missin 
Show me the ways I forgot to be speaking 
Show me the ways to get back to the garden 
Show me the ways to get around the get around 
Show me the ways to button up buttons 
that have forgotten they're buttons 
Well we can't have that forgetting that 
Girls girls what have we done 
What have we done to ourselves 

Driving on the vine over clothes lines 
but officer I saw the sign 

Thought I'd been through this in 1919 
Counting the tears of ten thousand men 
and gathered them all but my feet are slipping 
There's something we left on the windowsill 
There's something we left yes 

We'll see how brave you are 
We'll see how fast you'll be running 
We'll see how brave you are 
Yes, Anastasia 

and all your dollies have friends 

Thought she deserved no less than she'd give 
Well happy birthday 
Her bloods on my hands 
It's kind of a shame cause I did like that dress 
It's funny the things you find in the rain 
The things that you find 
in the mall and in the date-mines 
in the knot still in hair 
on the bus I'm on my way down 
All the girls seem to be there 

We'll see how brave you are 
We'll see how fast you'll be running 
We'll see how brave you are 
We'll see 
We'll see how brave you are 
We'll see how fast you'll be running 
You'll see how brave you are 
Yes, Anastasia 

Come along now little darlin' 
Come along now with me 
Come along now little darlin' 
We'll see how brave you are
