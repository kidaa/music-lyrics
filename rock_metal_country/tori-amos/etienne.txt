Maybe I'm a witch 
Lost in time 
Running through the fields 
Of Scotland by your side 
Kicked out of France 
But I still believe 
Taken to a land 
Far across the sea 

Etienne, Etienne 
Hear the west wind 
Whisper my name 
Etienne, Etienne 
By the morning 
Maybe we'll remember 
Who I am 

Maybe you're the night 
Who saved my life 
Maybe we faced 
The fire side by side 
Here we are again 
Under the same sky 
As the gypsy crystal 
Slowly dies 

Etienne, Etienne 
Hear the west wind 
Whisper my name 
Etienne, Etienne 
By the morning 
Maybe we'll remember 
Who I am 

I close my eyes 
See you again 
I know I've held you 
But I can't remember 
Where or when 

Oh Etienne, Etienne 
Hear the west wind 
Whisper my name 
Etienne, Etienne 
By the morning 
Maybe we'll remember 
Who I am
