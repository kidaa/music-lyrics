I think it's perfectly clear
We're in the wrong band
Ginger is always sincere
Just not to one man
She called me up
And said you know that i'm drowning
It's the dog trainer again
He says that he thinks that she needs more hands

I think it perfectly clear
We're in the wrong band
Senator let's be sincere
As much as you can
He called her up
And he said the new prosecutor
Soon will be wanting a word
So she's got a soft sport for heels and spurs
And there's something believin
In her voice again
Said there's something believin instead of just leavin

And she gets her cigars
From the sweet fat man
I think it's perfectly clear
We're in the wrong band
Heidi shays she'll be sincere
As much as she can
I called her up
And I said you know that I'm drowning
Put on your raincoat again
Cause even the sun's got a price on it
And there's something believin
In her voice again
Said there's something believin instead of just leavin

She said it's time I open my eyes
Don't be afraid to open your eyes
Maybe she's right
Maybe she's right
Maybe she's right
Maybe she's right
