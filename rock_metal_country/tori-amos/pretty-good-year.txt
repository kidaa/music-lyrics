Tears on the sleeve of a man 
Don't wanna be a boy today 
Heard the eternal footman 
bought himself a bike to race 
and Greg he writes letters and burns his CDs 
They say you were something in those formative years 
Hold on to nothing as fast as you can 
Well still pretty good year 

Maybe a bright sandy beach 
is gonna bring you back 
Maybe not so now you're off 
You're gonna see America 
Well let me tell you something about America 
Pretty good year 

Some things are melting now 
Well what's it gonna take till my baby's alright 

And Greg he writes letters with his birthday pen 
Somthimes he's aware that they're drawing him in 
Lucy was pretty your best friend agreed 
Well still pretty good year
