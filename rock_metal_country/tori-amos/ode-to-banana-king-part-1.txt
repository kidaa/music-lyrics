Turning back ten thousand years 
It's all a blur 
Where the taxis go 
Monster man, a willing friend 
Lucy serves the melon cold 
Violent and delicious souls 

Four red trucks dressed illegally 
Mother knows 
How the bugle blows 
Gonna get caught in her rug, babe 

This is not a conclusion 
No revolution 
Just a little confusion 
On where your head has been 

Boats made out of paper float 
Dreams made up 
For the banana king, darling 
Crumbs you have lapped freely 
Oh, devious we all have been 

Violent and delicious souls 

This is not a conclusion 
No revolution 
Just a little confusion 
On where your head has been
