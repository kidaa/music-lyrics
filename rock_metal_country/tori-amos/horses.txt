I got me some horses to ride on to ride on 
They say that your demons can't go there 
So I got me some horses to ride on to ride on 
as long as your army keeps perfectly still 

And maybe I'll find me a sailor a tailor 
and maybe together we'll make mother well 
So I got me some horses to ride on to ride on 
as long as your army keeps perfectly still 
You showed me the meadow and Milkwood and Silkwood 
and you would if I would but you never would 
so I chased down your posies your pansies in my hosies 
then opened my hands and they were empty then 

Off with superfly sniffing a Sharpie pen 
Honey it's Bill and Ben 
Off with superfly counting your bees 
oh me honey like one two three 
The camera is rolling 
It's easy like one two three 

And if there is a way to find you 
I will find you 
but will you find me if Neil 
makes me a tree an afro a pharaoh 
I can't go you said so 
and threads that are golden don't break easily 

So I got me some horses to ride on to ride on 
They say that your demons can't go there 
So I got me some horses to ride on to ride on 
as long as your army keeps perfectly still 
keeps perfectly still 
keeps perfectly still
