"Lies everywhere" 
Said the Father to the son 
You're peppermint breath 
Gonna choke him to death 
Daddy, watch your little black sheep run 
He's got knives in his back 
Everytime he opens up 
You say "He gotta be strong if wou want to be a man" 
Mr. I don't know how you can have 
Sweet dreams 
Sweet dreams 

Land land of Liberty we're run 
By a constipated man 
When you live in the past 
You refuse to see 
When your daughter comes home nine months pregnant 
With five billion points of light 
Gonna shine them on the face of your friends 
They've got the earth in a sling 
The world on her knees 
They've even got your zipper 
Between their teeth 
Sweet dreams 
Sweet dreams 
You say you have 'em 
I say that you're a liar 
Sweet dreams 
Sweet dreams 
Go on and dream 
Your house is on fire 

Well well summer wind 
Been catching up with me 
"Elephant mind missy you don't have 
You're forgettin 
To fly darlin' when you sleep" 
I got hazy lazy susan 
Takin turns all over my dreams 
I got lizards and snakes 
Runnin' through my body 
Funny how they all have my face 
Sweet dreams 
You say you have 'em 
I say that you're a liar 
Sweet dreams 
Sweet dreams 
Go on and dream 
Your house is on fire 
Sweet dreams
