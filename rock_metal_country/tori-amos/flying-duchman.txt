Hey kid 
I've got a ride for you 
They say your brain is a comic book tattoo 
And you'll never be anything 
"What will you do with your life" 
Oh, that's all you hear 
From noon till night 

Take a trip on a rocket ship baby 
Where the sea is the sky 
I know the guy who runs the place 
And he's out of sight 
Flying Duchman 
Are you out there? 
Flying Duchman 
Are you out there? 
Flying Duchman 

Straight suits 
They don't understand 
She tried that one with the alligator boots 
But the other side drew her in 
Heart falling fast 
When she left 
Even the milky way was dressed in black 

Take a trip on a rocket ship baby 
The sea is the sky 
I know the guy who runs the place 
And he's out of sight 
Flying Duchman 
Are you out there? 
Flying Duchman 
Are you out there? 
Flying Duchman 

'Cause they can't see what you're born to be 
They can't see me 
They can't be what they can't believe 
They can't see what you see 

Keep the boys spinning 
In their own little world 
Time up and so we won't say a word 
They keep the boys spinning 
In their own little world 
So afraid he'll be what they never were 

Take a trip on a rocket ship baby 
The sea is the sky 
I know the guy who runs the place 
And he's out of sight 
Flying Duchman 
Are you out there? 
Flying Duchman 
Are you out there? 
Flying Duchman 
'Cause they can't see 
'Cause they can't see 
'Cause they can't see 
Are you still out there?
