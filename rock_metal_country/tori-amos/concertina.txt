clouds descending 
I'm not policing 
what you think and dream 
I run into your thought from 
across the room 
just another trick can I 
weather this 
I've got a fever above my waist 
you got a squeeze box on your knee 
I know the truth is in between the 
1st and the 40th drink 
concertina concertina a chill that bends 
this I swear you're the fiercest calm 
I've been in the soul quake 
happened here in a glass world 
particle by particle she slowly changes 
she likes hanging Chinese paper cuts just 
another fix 
can I weather this 
iiiiiiiiii got my fuzz all tipped to play 
I got a dub on your landscape 
then there's your policy of trancing 
the sauce without the blame too far 
too far too far it could all get way too cheerful 
concertina I know the truth lies in 
between the 1st and 40th drink
