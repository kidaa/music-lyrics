Maybe I'm the afterglow
Cause I'm with the band
you know
Don't you hear the laughter
On the way down
Yes I am the anchorman
Dining here with
Son of Sam
A hair too much to chat of
On the way down
Gonna meet a great big star
Gonna drive his great big car
Gonna have it all here
On the way down
The way down
The way down
She knows
Let's go
The way down
The way down
The way down
She knows
