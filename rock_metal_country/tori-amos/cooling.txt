Maybe I didn't like to hear 
But I still can't believe 
Speed Racer is dead 
So then I thought I'd make some plans 
The fire thought 
She'd really rather be water instead 

And Piggy got a message for me 
From Jesus 
And I've heard every word 
That she was saying 
And I know I have been 
Driven like the snow 

This is cooling 
This is cooling 
This is cooling 
Faster than I can 
This is cooling 
Faster than I can 

So then I tried to make some plans 
The fire thought she'd really rather be water 
Instead
This ocean is wrapped around that pineapple
Tree

And is your place in heaven Worth giving up 
These kisses 
These kisses 

And Piggy got a message for me 
From Jesus 
And I heard every word that she had said 

And I know I have been 
Driven like the snow 

This is cooling 
This is cooling 
Faster than I can 
This is cooling 
Faster than I can 

Yes, this is cooling 
This is cooling
