save you from that evil faith 
Eagles serve yeah uhhuh Mother first 
they turn you into predator but boy I can 
save you from that evil faith 
Arms sold in Balmy cities that may not be with us for long 
save you from that evil faith 
lay back 
Strong Black Vine 
submission 
is my mission for a 
Strong Black Vine

sweet Jesus 
Strong Black Vine 
submission 
is my mission for a 
Strong Black Vine 
your mission

Blown to bits her innocent flesh to dust 
all for a dark god 
all for the love of some evil faith 
Swollen stream 
every drip serpents bliss

Bodies bathe in black gold your pleasure 
Arms sold in Balmy cities that my not be with us for long
