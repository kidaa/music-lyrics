Feeling radical in Cotton
Purified in my Satin
But the bomb of the season
Is a Velvet Revolution

I look at the sky
And feel the tears of the
Prophets crying

I look at the sky
And feel the rain
The rain of tears

Feeling radical in Cotton
Purified in my Satin
But the bomb of the season
Is a Velvet Revolution

All you killers of the children
There's a new Commandment
The true Divine Creator wants a
Velvet Revolution

All you killers of the children
There's a new Commandment
The true Divine Creator wants a

Velvet Revolution
