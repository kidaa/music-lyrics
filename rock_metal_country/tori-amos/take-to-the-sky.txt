This house is like Russia 
With eyes cold and grey 
You got me moving in a circle 
I dyed my hair red today 
I just want a little passion 
To hold me in the dark 
I know I've got some magic 
Buried deep in my heart yeah 

But my priest says 
You ain't saving no souls 
My father says 
You ain't making any money 
My doctor says 
You just took it to the limit 
And here I stand 
With this sword in my hand 
You can say it one more time 
What you don't like 
Let me hear it one more time then 
Have a seat while I 
Take to the sky 

My heart is like the ocean 
It gets in the way 
So close to touching freedom 
Then I hear the guards call my name 

But my priest says 
You ain't taking no souls 
My father says 
You ain't making any money 
My doctor says 
You just took it to the limit 
And here I stand 
With this sword in my hand 
You can say it one more time 
What you don't like 
Let me hear it one more time then 
Have a seat while I 
Take to the sky 

If you don't like me just a little 
Why do you hang around 
There she goes again 
Wearing those purple panties 
There she goes again 
Wearing her heart 
There she goes again 
Why do you 
Take it 
You can say it one more time 
You can say it one more time 
You can say it one more time 
What you don't like 
Let me hear it one more time then 
Have a seat while I 
Take to the sky
