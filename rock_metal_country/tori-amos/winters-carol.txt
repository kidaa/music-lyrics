A winter's carol 
First song of the robin 
A winter's carol 
I go through the land 
And I can hear it 
Ringing out 
Ringing out 
From pine to oak 
Bringing out with the December snow 
Ringing out 
A gift of old 
Wrapped in ribbons of gold 
For the whole world 
For the whole world 
The summer queen 
has been in darkness 
The summer queen 
has been in darkness 
the summer queen 
surrenders to this 
To him she reveals 
the secrets 
To him she reveals 
the Wine Ham secrets 
for a time 
rejoice 
Fire and frosted marriage 
Through a midwinter clearing 
a forest greets the snowy evening 
Year after year, the holly king 
passes the torch as it was intended 
through a midwinter clearing 
a final kiss and a new beginning 
kiss on queen wearing his wreath 
soon with the sun she will reascend 
through a midwinter clearing 
the forest greets a snowy evening 
with wands of yew, the holly king 
passes the torch as it was intended 
passes the torch as it was intended 
A winter's carol 
the song of the robin 
the sun is reborn 
from the starry heavens 
A winter's carol 
echoes the sound of wonder 
and I can hear it 
ringing out 
Ringing out, 
From pine to oak 
Bringing out, with the December snow 
Ringing out 
A gift of old 
Wrapped in ribbons of gold 
For the whole world 
For the whole world 
For the whole world 
Ringing out, 
winter's carol 
Ringing out, 
winter's carol 
Ringing out, 
winter's
