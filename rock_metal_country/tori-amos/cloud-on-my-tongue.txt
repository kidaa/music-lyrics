Someone's knocking on my kitchen door 
Leave the wood outside 
What all the girls here are freezing cold 
Leave me with your Borneo 
I don't need much to keep me warm 

Don't stop now what you're doin 
What you're doin my ugly one 
Bring them all here 
Hard to hide a hundred girls in your hair 
It won't be fair if I hate her, if I ate her 
You can go now 

You're already in there 
I'll be wearing your tatoo 
You're already in there 

Got a cloud sleeping on my tongue 
He goes then it goes and 
kiss the violets as they're waking up 
Leave me with your Borneo 
Leave me the way I was before 

You're already in there 
I'll be wearing your tatoo 
I'm already in 
Circles and circles and circles again 
The girl's in circles and circles and circles again 
Circles and circles and circles again 
The girl's in circles and circles and circles again 

Someone's knocking on the kitchen door 
Leave the wood outside 
All the girls here are freezing cold 
You can go now 
You can go now 

You're already in there 
I'll be wearing your tatoo 
You're already in there 

Thought I was over the brige now 
over the bridge now 
I'm already in 
circles and circles and circles again 
The girl's in circles and circles and 
Got to stop spinning 
Circles and circles and circles again 
The girl's in circles and circles and circles again well
