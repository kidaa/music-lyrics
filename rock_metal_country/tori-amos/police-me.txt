Police me

We've got your own remote viewing
Every cell has been taught to think
Perhaps the answer to the question
Lies in the question
Perhaps you should read my thoughts
Line them up like soldiers

Police yourself
Police youself
Police me

Loaded, full of winter you are
Storming Blackberry girl
Will you strike before he's
Loaded, full of winter you are storming
Blackberry girl will you strike
Before he's loaded
Full of winter you are

Police yourself
Police yourself
Police me

Can they monitor how you think?
They've got their own remote viewing
To get off he cries "slutty goth"
But I'm a brightly colored person

Loaded, full of winter you are
Storming Blackberry girl
Will you strike before he's
Loaded, full of winter you are storming
Blackberry girl will you strike
Before he's loaded

Full of winter you are
Perhaps the answer to the question
Lies in the question
Perhaps you should read my thoughts
Line them up like soldiers

Police yourself
Police yourself
Police me
