I am not you senorita
I am not from your tribe
In the garden I did no crime
I am not your senorita
I am not from your tribe
If you want inside her
Well,
Boy you better make her raspberry swirl
Things are getting desperate
When all the boys can't be men
Everybody knows
I'm her friend
Everybody knows
I'm her man
Things are getting desperate
When all the boys can't be men
Everybody knows
I'm her friend
Everybody knows
I'm her man
I am not your senorita
I don't aim so high
IM my heart I did no crim
If you want inside her well,
Boy you better make her raspberry swirl
Things are getting desperate
When all the boys can't be men
Everybody knows
I'm her friend
Everybody knows
I'm her man
Things are getting desperate
When all the boys can't be men
Everybody knows
I'm her friend
Everybody knows
I'm her man
Raspberry swirl
