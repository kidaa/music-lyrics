Do a dance for me
Baby it is late still you pour me 
a tall one... 
Go on, let the liquid take off what you're on. 

Youve been down before
Boy and I like this
Im in quicksand
I am sinking fast

Perfect, heal it
Because your other half has got himself
A devils excess or Access

Welcome to England, he said
Welcome to my World

You better bring your own sun, sweet girl
You gotta bring your own sun
Dont you forget your
Bring your own sun
Just enough for everyone

Heels on, go on
Bang a tango but do not get tangled
Who can stay strong
When they only give us lies to lean on

When your heart explodes
Is it deathly cold
You must let the colors violate the
Backness the rest
A magic world in parallel
So leave your daily hell

Welcome to England, he said
Welcome to my World

Its not a question, if I can
Fight by your side
And withstand
Anything but
But I forgot
That you said, girl
If you come

You better bring your own sun, sweet girl
You gotta bring your own sun
Dont you forget your
Bring your own sun
Just enough for everyone

Welcome to England
