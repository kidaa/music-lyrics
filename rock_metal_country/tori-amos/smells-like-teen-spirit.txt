Load up on guns and 
Bring your friends 
It's fun to lose 
And to pretend 
She's overboard 
And self assured 
Oh no, I know a dirty word 

Hello hello hello hello 

I'm worse at what I do best 
And for this gift I feel blessed 
Our little group has all it's been 
And always will be until the end 

Hello hello hello hello 

With the lights out it's less dangerous 
Here we are now 
Entertain us 
I feel stupid and contagious 
Here we are now 
Entertain us 
A mulatto 
An albino 
A mosquito 
My Libido 
Yeah
