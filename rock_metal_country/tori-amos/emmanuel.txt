O come, O come, Emmanuel 
And ransom captive Israel 
That mourns in lonely exile here 
Until the Son of God appear 
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel 
Shall come to thee, O Israel 

Long ago the earth lay sleeping 
Waiting for the darkest night 
To bring with it the dove of peace 
Rising on the wings 
Wings of the sun 
Rising on the wings of the sun 

O come, O come, thou Dayspring bright! 
Pour on our souls thy healing light 
Dispel the long night's lingering gloom 
And pierce the shadows of the tomb 
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel 
Shall come to thee, O Israel 
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel 
Shall come to thee, O Israel.
