Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout 
Would not take the garbage out 
She'd scour the pots and scrap the pans 
Candy the yams and spice the hams 
And though her daddy would scream and shout 
She simply would not take the garbage out 
And so it pulled up to the ceilings 
Coffee grounds, potato peelings 
Brown bananas, rotten peas 
Chunks of sour cottage cheese 
It filled the can it covered the floor 
It cracked the window and blocked the door 
With bacon rinds and chicken bones 
Drippy ends of ice cream cones 
Prunes pits, peach pits, orange peel 
Gloppy glumps of cold oatmeal 
Pizza crusts and withered greens 
Soggy beans and tangerines 
Crusts of black burned butter toast 
Grisly bits of beefy roast 
The garbage rolled on down the hall 
It raised the roof, it broke the wall 
Greesy napkins, cookie crumbs 
Glops of gooey bubble gum 
Celaphane from green bologna 
Rubbery blubbery macaroni 
Peanut butter caked and dry 
Curdled milk and crusts of pie 
Moldy melons, dried up mustard 
Egg shells mixed with lemon custard 
Cold french fries and rancid meat 
Yellow lumps of cream-of-wheat 
At last the garbage reached so high 
That finally it touched the sky 
All the neighbors moved away 
And none of her friends would come to play 
And finally Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout 
Said "Okay, I'll take the garbage out" 
Then of course it was too late 
The garbage reached across the state 
From New York to the Golden Gate 
And there in the garbage she did hate 
Poor Sarah met an awful fate 
That I cannot right now relate 
Because the hour is much to late 
The children remember Sarah Stout 
And always take the yummy garbage out
