There was a gambler and a cleaner and a puppeteer 
only the puppet could explain just what he was 
All on a bus we were hopin' to pass the time 
plug my piece in boys then we can drink the wine 
drink the wine drink the wine- 
music, good friends, I'm not dyin' today 
I Amy be 6 feet under full of wonder 
I'm not dyin' today 
Dyin' today 
I'm not dying mister 
today 
Neil is thrilled he can claim he's a mammalian 
"but the bad news," he said "Girl you're a dandelion." 
Dandelion. Hey I need to think about that. 
Yeah, I thought about that and I said, "What the Hell?" 
He said, "Nope, you are Earth bound, blow them seeds away 
maybe one will make a sound." 
Make a sound, Make a sound- 
music, good fiends, 
I'm not Dyin' Today 
may be 6 feet under full of thunder 
I'm not Dyin' Today 
dyin' today 
I'm not dying mister 
today 
So they got us go goin' and comin' 
Cause they make us pay 
if we go or stay 
is he prayin' 
that I'll pop my clogs? 
if they can't prove I'm crazy 
by noon I'll be pushin' up them daises 
Tomorrow, with their Donut ox they'll say "Its sad she's Brown Bread." 
Hey, I got my weapons- 
music, good friend, 
I'm not dyin' today 
I may be 6 feet under 
way down yonder 
I'm not dyin' today 
dyin' 
I'm not dying, sister, take your paws off 
my ankle straps and my mister 
Dyin' Fryin', rather have a lie-in 
I am not blowin' that Gabriell's Trumpet 
i got my own band to play today
