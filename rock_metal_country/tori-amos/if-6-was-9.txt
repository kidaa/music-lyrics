If the sun refused to shine 
I don't how 
I don't mind 

If the mountains fell in the sea 
Let it be 
It ain't me 

Got my own world to live through 
Ain't gonna come near you 

If a 6 turned out to be 9 
I don't know how 
I don't mind 

If the hippies cut off their hair 
I don't care 
I don't care 

I've got my own world to live through 
Ain't gonna come near you 

If the sun refused to shine... 

What child is this... 
What child is this... 
What child is this... 
What child is this... 
What child is this... 
What child is this... 
What child is this... 
What child is this... 
What child is this...?
