from here
no lines are
drawn
from here
no lands
are owned
13,000 and holding
swallowed
in the purring
of her engines
tracking the beacon
here
"is there a signal
there
on the other side"
on the other side
what do you mean 
side of what things
and you said 
and you did 
and you said 
you could find me here 
and you said 
you would find me 
even in death 
and you said 
and you said 
you'd find me 
but i can't see new york 
as i'm, circling down 
through white cloud 
falling out 
and i know 
his lips are warm 
but i can't seem 
to find my way out 
my way out i can't see.
of this hunting ground 
from here crystal meth 
in metres of millions 
in the end all we have, 
soul blueprint. 
did we get lost in it 
do we conduct a search 
for this "from the other side" 
from the other side 
what do they mean 
side of what things... 
and you said. 
you again 
it's you again 
i can't see 
i can't see new york 
from the other side 
from the other side 
i hum from the other side
