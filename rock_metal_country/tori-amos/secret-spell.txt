In one hand dreams a plenty
In her smile a secret spell
There have been disappointments
These she knows all too well

And you losing you
Was not a part of this plan
So
Jumps at three tears at thirteen
Just turn you around for
Eighteen wheels in a high heel
Turn you around
Sold a dream at twenty three
Turn you around
Hold out
You still got your secret spell

At the heart of the matter
Someone wove a secret spell
Mixed with girl not so peaceful
Angel and animal

But me losing you
Was not a part of this plan
So

Jumps at three tears at thirteen
Just turn you around for
Eighteen wheels in a high heel

Turn you around
Sold a dream at twenty three
Turn you around
Hold out
You still got your secret spell

Girl you got to do a 180
Disappointment you know it well
But you losing you
Was not a part of this plan
So

Jumps at three tears at thirteen
Just turn you around for
Eighteen wheels in a high heel
Turn you around
Sold a dream at twenty three
Turn you around
Hold out
Hold out
You still got your secret spell
Girl you got to do a 180
'cause you still got your secret spell
