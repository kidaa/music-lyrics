Some people sing about Deutsche girls 
and girls from California 
they might be alright for a night alright 
but I don't trust them I warn ya 
I've been to the east and I've been out west 
and I've been the world around 
but I ain't seen no one anywhere near 
a girl from London town 

Give me a London Girl every time 
I've got to find one 
I've made up my mind 
give me a London Girl every time 
I want a London Girl 

Marry a girl from London town 
you know that you can trust her 
she'll darn your socks 
and wash you everytime your trousers won't bust 'em yes 
they're all good cooks 
and they've got good looks 
and they won't lead you down 
said I gotta find a London Girl 
if I ever get to have a chance 

Oh give me a London Girl every time 
I've got to find one 
I've made up my mind 
give me a London Girl every time 
I want a London Girl 

London Girls are the best in the world 
there ain't no doubt about it 
If you can't find a girl from La-London town 
you're better off doin' without it 
they don't [create] when you come home late 
and you're crawlin' up the passage floor 
they won't mock about you 
when you're going out with 
the geezer from the house next door 

give me a London Girl every time 
I've got to find one 
I've made up my mind 
I said honey give me a London Girl babe 
every little day 
your legs turn to jelly 
and I got a little smelly 
but I know it's just what I want 

cause I need a London Girl, oh, every time 
they've always got a pound 
to buy their round 
when it's their turn at the bar
