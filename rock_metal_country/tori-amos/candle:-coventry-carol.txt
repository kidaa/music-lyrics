Candle Candle 
Are the children safe now? 
Unlike they were long ago, 
Candle Candle 
are the children safe now? 
Sing their song of long ago 

Candle Candle 
are the children safe now? 
Unlike we were long ago, 
Candle Candle 
Guide us and protect us 
from those in Darkness 
from those in Darkness 

Lully, Lulla 
Thou little tiny child 
By, by, lully lullay 
Thou little tiny child 
By, By, Lully Lullay 

Oh sisters too how may we do 
for to preserve this day 
This poor youngling for whom 
We do sing 
By, By, lully lullay
