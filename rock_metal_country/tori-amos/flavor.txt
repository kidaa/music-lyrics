Back to love the minds 
Cries Below 
Cries Above 
You must pick a side 
Will you choose fear 
Will you choose love 

[Chorus:]
What does it look like 
This orbital ball 
From the fringes of the milky way 
What does it feel like 
This orbital ball 
On The fringes of the milky way 
Raining fla..fla...falavor 
I've seen fla..fla...flavor, flavor, love 

Who's God then is God 
They all want jur..jurisdiction 
In the book of Eris 
Who's God spread fear 
Spread love 

[Chorus:]
What does it look like 
This orbital ball 
From the fringes of the milky way 
What does it feel like 
This orbital ball 
On The fringes of the milky way 
Raining fla..fla...falavor 
I've seen fla..fla...flavor, flavor, love 

Try not to breath when seen 

What does it look like 
This orbital ball 
From the fringes of the milky way 
What does it feel like 
This orbital ball 
On The fringes of the milky way 
Raining fla..fla...flavor 
I've seen fla..fla...flavor 

Spread that fla..fla...flavor 
Flavor 
Flavor 
Flavor
