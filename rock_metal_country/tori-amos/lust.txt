Hey you gender nectar
Sifting through the grain of gold
Tripping at your door is that you.
Alpha in her blood
And when the woman lies
You don't believe her
Rolling and unrolling
Coiling emerging
Running free
Running through the underworld int your room

Is he real or a ghost-lie
She feels she isn't hear
And the veil tears and rages till her voices are remembered
And his secrets can be told

Hey you gender nectar
Crystalline from the vine
You know you'll drink her
Rolling and unrolling
Coiling emerging
Funning free running through
The afterworld intoyour room
So she prays
For a prankster and lust
In the marriage bed
And he waits till she can give
And he waits and he waits
