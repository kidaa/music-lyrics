7 am
So it beings again
1-0 zip favoring familiar silhouettes
Left whips and chains
Behind I'm boycotting trends
It's my new look this season

Riding on backs of palominos
Primed for an attack
It's as good
As good as it gets
With girl disappearing
What on earth's occurring?
'cause she's right in front of me

A girl disappearing
To some secret prison
Behind her eyes she whispers
"Big surprise there was
No protection by this urban light
So I'm running to
A constellation
Where they can still see you"

Envy can spread
Herself so thinly
She slipped in
Before I could notice it

In my own war
Blood in the cherry zone
When they
Pit woman against feminist

Riding on backs of palominos
Ditching the blond shell
Working her hell
On that red carpet

With girl disappearing
What on earth's occurring?
'cause she's right in front of me

A girl disappearing
To some secret prison
But she's right in front of me
A girl disappearing
To some secret prison
Behind her eyes she whispers
"Big surprise there was
No protection by this urban light
So I'm running to
A constellation

Where they can still see you"
Then I'm running too
If that's a consolation

'cause I can still see you
