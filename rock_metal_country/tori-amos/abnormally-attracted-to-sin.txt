Impeccable peccadillo 
You are off your guard 
Pussy will calls there by the church
"Don't go in if you are abnormally attracted to sin" 
Abnormally attracted to sin 
She may be dead to you 
But her hips sway a natural kind of faith 
That could give your lost heart 
A warm chapel 
You'll sleep in her bell tower 
And you will simply wake 
Abnormally attracted to sin 
Abnormally attracted to sin 
Impeccable peccadillo 
I know who you are 
Tales of longing sway 
Lost without a verse 
Hymns of swing lay low there by the church
"Don't go in if you are abnormally attracted to sin'
