Sure that star can twinkle
And you're watching it do
Boy so had boy so hard
But I know a girl
Twice as hard
And I'm sure
Said I'm sure
She's watching it too
No matter what tie she's got in her right dresser
Tied
I know she's watching that star

Gonna twinkle
Gonna twinkle
Gonna twinkle

And last time I knew
She worked at an Abbey in lona
She said "I killed a man T
I've gotta stay hidden in this Abbey"
But I can see that star
When she twinkles
And she twinkles
And I sure can
That means
I sure can

That means
I sure can
So hard
So hard
