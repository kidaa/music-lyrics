Waiting for the phone to ring
Diamond necklace on my shoulder
Waiting for the phone to ring
Lipstick on my naked shoulder
It seems to be my fancy to make it with
Franky and Sue Ann

Over the bridge we go
Looking for love
Over the bridge we go
Looking for love
I'll come running to you, hey baby if you want me
I'll come running to you, baby if you want me

Looking at my hands today
Look to me that they're made of ivory
I had a funny call today
Someone died and someone married
you know that it's my fancy to make it with
Franky and Sue Ann

Over the bridge they go
Looking for love
Over the bridge we go
Looking for love
I'll come running to you, hey baby if you want me
I'll come running to you, baby if you want me

Something's got a hold on me
And I don't know what

Something's got a hold on me
And I don't know what

It's the beginning of a new age
It's the beginning of a new age

It's new age
