Think of me as programmable soda
Too much cherry?
Baby then you can just add cola
Think of me as programmable soda

'Cause you can
Can be a cruel fella
So okay, then I just back off
The vanilla

Think of me as programmable soda
'cause I've come
I've come to accept that
For lovelies you are a fanatic
But I can't
I can't let that throw me
Into a genital panic

Think of me as programmable soda
Too much cherry?
Baby then you can just add cola
Think of me as programmable soda
When you think
And boy when you drink
When you think of me
