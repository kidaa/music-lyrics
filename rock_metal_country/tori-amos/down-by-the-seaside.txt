Down by the seaside 
See the boats go sailin' 
Can the people hear, oh 
What the little fish are sayin' 

Down in the city streets 
See all the folk go racin' 
No time left, no-no 
To pass the time of day 

The people turned away 
The people turned away 

Out in the country 
Hear the people singin' 
Singin' 'bout their progress 
Knowin' where they're goin' 
Oh yeah 

The people turned away 
Yes, the people turned away 

Can you still do the twist 
Do you find you remember things that well 
Some twistin' every day 
Though sometimes it's awful hard to tell 
Yes it is, yes it is 
Yes it is 

Sing loud for the sunshine 
Pray hard for the rain 
And show your love for Lady Nature 
And she will come back again 
Yes she will 

The people turned away 
The people turned away
