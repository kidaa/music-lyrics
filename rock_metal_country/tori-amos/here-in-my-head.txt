In my head I found you there 
And running around and following me 
But you don't, oh, dare, now 
But I find that I have, now 
More then I ever wanted to 

So maybe Thomas Jefferson wasn't born 
In your backyard 
Like you have said and 
Maybe I'm just the horizon you run to when 
She had left you there, you, 
All here in my head and 
Running around and calling me 
Come back 
I'll show you the roses and brush off the snow 
And open their petals again and again 
And you know that apple green ice cream 
Can melt in your hands 
I can't so... 

I, I held your hand at the fair 
And even forgot what time it was 
And even Thomas Jefferson wasn't born 
In your backyard 
Like you have said and 
Maybe I'm just the horizon you run to when 
She has left you and me here alone on the floor 
You're counting my feathers as the bells toll 
You see the bow and the belt and the girl from the south 
All favourites of mine 
You know them all well 
And spring brings fresh little puddles 
That makes it all clear 
Makes it all 
Hey, do you know 
Hey, do you know 
What this is doing to me? 
Here
Here
Here
Here in my head
