I'm glad you're home 
I bet you really missed me 
I guess you did by the look in your eye 
Lay back and relax 
I put away the dishes 
Then you and me can rock-a-bye 

You can ring my bell 
Ring my bell 
You can ring my bell 
Ring my bell 

The night is young 
And full of possibilities 
Come on and let yourself be yourself 
My love for you so long I've been saving 
Tonight was made for me and you 

You can ring my bell 
Ring my bell 
You can ring my bell 
Ring my bell 

Anything you like 
Come on, yeah 
I'm getting over my four-leaf clover 

There was a time, I said to you 
There was a time, I said to you 
When I'm with him, do it to you 
Do it to you, do it, you know 

You can ring my bell 
Ring my bell
