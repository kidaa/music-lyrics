Ophelia your secret is safe 
Ophelia you must break the chain 
Some girls will get their way 
Some fathers will control from the grave 
Ophelia you must remember 

Veronica's America is not like-- 
Is not like Charlotte's, one to savor 
Cosmic flavor 
Then Alison whispers, "remember 
Change waltzes in with her sister Pain 
Waiting for you to send her away 
Wish her well break the chain 
Break the chain" 
I feel you 

Ophelia 
"The Eve of St. Agnes", 
A poem he can't reach you in 
Ophelia you know how to lose 
But when will you learn to choose 
Those men who choose to stay 
Those mothers who won't look the other way 
Ophelia you must remember 

Veronica's America is not like--
Is not like Charlotte's, one to savor 
Cosmic flavor 
Then Alison whispers," remember 
Change waltzes in with her sister Pain 
Waiting for you to send her away 
Wish her well break the chain 
Break the chain" 
I feel you 
Ophelia
