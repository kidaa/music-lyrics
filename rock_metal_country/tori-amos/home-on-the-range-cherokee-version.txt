Oh give me a home 
Where the buffalo roam 
Where the deer and the antelope play 
Where seldom is heard 
A discouraging word 
And the skies are not cloudy all day 

Home on the range 
Where the deer and the antelope play 
Where seldom is heard 
A discouraging word 
And skies are not cloudy all day 

Well Jackson made deals 
A thief down to his heels 
Had a long trail of tears 
The Smokies could hide 
A Cherokee bride 
Her brave was shot yesterday 

Home on the range 
Where the deer and the antelope play 
Where seldom is heard 
A discouraging word 
And skies are not cloudy all day 
Mmm, we know it's not Caroline 
Your home is your home 
The range may be fine 
For some but not in my eyes 

Home on the range 
The Smokies always hide 
Cherokee bride 
But in their eyes 
We know it's not Caroline 

Yes, yes, America 
Hey, America 
Who discovered your ass? 

The white man came 
"This land is my land 
This is your land" they sang 

Home on the range 
Where the deer and the antelope play 
Where seldom is heard 
A discouraging word 
And the skies are not cloudy all day
