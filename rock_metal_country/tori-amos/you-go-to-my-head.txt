Sweet love 
Hello
Make a slave of me 
I should have more control 
Little dove 
Hello
You take full advantage 
Of my open window 

When the cold of the night has washed away 
All I want is to wake in your arms 
And I know that I shouldn't let you stay 
But I'm a lush for your love 

You go to my head 
You go to my head 
You go to my head 
And you know I can never say no 
To you and your friend 

You call 
Oh no you know you want him 
Boy your heart swings in the wind 
From rose to rose 
Honeybee go home please stay 
To that warm nest you left minutes ago 

Yes I understand you give your time 
Can't you see I've given my heart 
All that light in your eyes is from the wine 
I'm such a lush for your love 

You go to my head 
You go to my head 
You go to my head 
And you know I can never say no 
To you and your friend
