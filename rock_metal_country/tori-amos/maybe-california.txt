Hey Mrs. C, please dont jump 
why not? 
Nothing is making sense anymore to me 
I dont know when I stopped making him smile 
Now the kids see me crying all the time 

From one mother to the other 
Theyll never get over this for their lifetime 
All their wishes will be dashed upon those cliffs 
so lets be strong for you and me the night is opening 
Our angels are falling and they will warm us 
She asked right now right here 
Im feeling so mad dear 

Maybe California 
Maybe California 

As mothers we have our troubles 
youll leave them with emptiness for their lifetime 
All their wishes will be dashed upon those cliffs 
So lets be strong you and me the night is opening 
Our angels are falling and they will warm us 
She asked right now right here 
Im feeling so mad dear 

Maybe California 
Maybe California 

Until then there will be starlight shining down 
For every tear and every child
