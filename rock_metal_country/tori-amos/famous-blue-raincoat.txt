It's four in the morning, the end of December 
I'm writing you now just to see if you're better 
New York is cold but I like where I'm living 
There's music on Clinton Street all through the evening. 
I hear that you're building your little house deep in the desert 
you're living for nothing now 
I hope you're keeping some kind of a record 

Yes and Jane came by with a lock of your hair 
she said that you gave it to her 
that night that you planned to go clear 
did you ever go clear? 

the last time I saw you, you looked so much older 
your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder 
you'd been to the station to meet every train 
you came home alone without Lili Marlene. 
and you treated my woman to flake of your life 
and when she came back she was nobody's wife 

well, I see you there with a rose in your teeth 
one more thin gypsy thief 
well, I see Jane's awake 
she sends her regards. 

and what can I tell you my brother, my killer 
what can I possibly say 
I guess that I miss you, I guess I forgive you 
I'm glad you stood in my way. 
if you ever come by here for Jane or for me 
well, your enemy is sleeping and your woman is free 

yes, and thanks for the trouble you took from her eyes 
I thought it was there for good so I never tried. 

and Jane came by with a lock of you hair 
she said that you gave it to her 
that night that you planned to go clear 
sincerely, L. Cohen
