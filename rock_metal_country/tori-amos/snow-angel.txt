When the bell brought in Midwinter 
I waited for a sign 
A shadow, of a wing 
This has always been 

The children know this, 
That she will come to them 
To them 
To them 

Snow Angel, Snow Angel, Snow Angel 
She'll make her way 
And she'll stay 
For a Time, For a time 

In the dark of this Midwinter, 
The moon slipped from night 
A shadow, of a wing 
This has always been 

The Children know this... 

And she'll stay, for a time 
And it's time
