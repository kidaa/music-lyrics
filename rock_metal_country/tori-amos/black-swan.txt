Ride on, ride on 
Friends of the black swan 
Ride on, ride on 
Do you know where she's gone 
Gumdrops and Saturdays 
Did Eric call by the way? 
He knew, he knew 
And he knew where the pillow goes 

Ride on, ride on 
Friends of the black swan 
Ride on, ride on 
You know where she's gone 
Buttercups and fishing flies 
The biggest, thickest ever sky 
I know they know something 
I know, ah! 

Ride on, ride on 
Friends of the black swan 
Ride on, ride on 
You know where she's gone 

Little green men do O.K. 
It's the fairie's revenge they say 
Gumdrops and Saturdays 
Did Eric call by the way? 

Ride on, ride on 
Friends of the black swan 
Ride on, ride on 
You know where she's gone 
Ride on, ride on, ride on
