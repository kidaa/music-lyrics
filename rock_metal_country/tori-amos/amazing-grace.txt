Amazing Grace 
How sweet the sound 
That saved a wretch like me 
I once was lost 
But now I sure is found 
Was blind but now I see 

'Twas grace mother that taught 
My heart to fear 
And grace my fears relieved 
How precious did ever 
Your grace appear 
The hour I first believed 

When we've been there 
Ten thousand years 
Bright shining as his sun 
I know that grace 
Sweet grace has appeared 
And now she'll bring me home
