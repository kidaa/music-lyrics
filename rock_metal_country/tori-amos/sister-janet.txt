Master Shamen 
I have come 
With my dolly from the shadow side 
With a demon and an Englishman 
I'm my mother 
I'm my son 
Nobody else is slipping the blade in easy 
Nobody else is slipping the blade in the marmalade 

All the angels 
All the wizards black and white 
Are lighting candles in our hands 
Can you feel them 
Touching hands before our eyes 
And I can even see sweet Marianne 

Sister Janet 
You have come 
From the woman clothed with the sun 
Your veil is quietly becoming none 
Call the Wanderer 
He has gone 
And all those up there are making it look so easy 
With your perfect wings 
A wing can cover all sorts of things 

All the angels 
All the wizards black and white 
Are lighting candles in our hands 
Can you feel them 
Touching hands before our eyes 
And I can even see sweet Marianne
