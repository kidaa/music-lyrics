carbon made found her at the 
end of a chain "time to race" 
she said "race the downhill" 
behind crystalline irises 
loons can drive 
where the world bleeds white
just keep your eyes on her 
keep 
don't look away 
keep your eyes on her horizon
bear claw free fall 
a gunner's view black and blue 
shred in ribbons of lithium 
blow by blow 
her mind cut in sheets 
layers deep now unravelling 
just keep your eyes on her. 
get me neil on the line 
no i can't hold 
have him read "snow glass apples" 
where nothing is what it seems 
"little sis you must crack this" 
he says to me 
"you must go in again carbon 
made only wants to be unmade" 
blade to ice it's 
double diamond time 
and keep your eyes on her 
on her eyes on her horizon
