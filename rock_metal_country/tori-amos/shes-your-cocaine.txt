She's your Cocaine

Then she says don't control it
Then she says you're controlling
The way she makes you crawl
She's your cocaine your Exodus laughing
And she knows
What you are
So shimmy once and do it again
Bring you sister
Bring you siter if you can't handle it
If you want me to 
Boy I could lie to you
You don't need on of these to let me inside of you
And is it true
That devils end up like you
Something safe for the picture frame
And is it true
That devils end up like you
So tied up you don't know how she came
