Way to go Mr. Microphone 
She us all what you don't know 
Centuries secret societies 
He's our commander still 
Space dog 

So sure we were on something 
Your feet are finally on the ground he said 
So sure we were on something 
Your feet are just on the ground girl 

Rain and snow, our engines have 
Been receiving your 
Eager call 
There's Colonel Dirtyfishydishcloth 
He'll distract her good 
Don't worry so 

And to the one you thought was on your side 
She can't understand 
She truly believes the lie 
Lemon Pie, he's coming through 
Our commander still 
Space dog 
Lines secure 
Space dog 

Deck the halls 
I'm young again, I'm you again 
Racing turtles, the grapefruit is winning 
Seems I keep getting the story twisted 
So where's Neil when you need him 
Deck the halls 
It's you again, it's you again 
Somewhere someone must know the ending 
Is she still pissing in the river now 
Heard she'd gone moved into a trailer park 

So sure those girls 
Now are in the Navy 
Those bombs our friends 
Can't even hurt you now 
And hold those tears 
Cause they're still on your side 
Don't hear the dogs barking 
Don't say you know 
We've gone Andromeda 
Stood with those girls before 
The hair in pairs 
It just got nasty 
And now those girls are gone
