I salute to you Commander
And I sneeze
'Cause I have Now
An Allergy
To your policies it seems

Where have we gone wrong America?
Mr. Lincoln we can't seem
To find you anywhere out of the millions
From the deserts
To the mountains
Over prairies
To the shores
Is this just the Madness of King George
Yo George
Is this just the Madness of King George
Yo George
Well you have the whole Nation
On all fours
