God sometimes you just don't come through
God sometimes you just don't come through
Do you need a woman to look after you
God sometimes you just don't come through

You make pretty daisies pretty daisies
Love I gotta find what you're doing about things
Here a few witches burning 
Gets a little toasty here
I gotta find why you always go when the wind blows
Tell me you're crazy maybe then I'll understand
You got your 9 ironin the back seat
Just in case
Heard you're gone south well
Babe you love your new 4 wheel
I gotta find why you always go when the wind blows

Will you even tell her if you decide to make the sky fall
Will you even tell her if you decide to make the sky

God sometimes you just odn't come through
God sometimes you just don't come through
Do you need a woman to look after you
God sometimes you just don't come through
Do you need a woman to look after you
God sometimes you just don't come through
