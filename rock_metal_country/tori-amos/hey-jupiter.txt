No one's picking up the phone 
Guess it's me and me 
and this little massochist 
She's ready to confess 
all the things that I never thought 
that she could feel 

Hey Jupiter 
nothing's been the same 
so are you gay 
are you blue 
Thought we both could use a friend to run to 
and I thought I 
wouldn't have to be with you 
something new 

Sometimes I breathe you in 
and I know you know 
and sometimes you take a swim 
Found your writing on my wall 
If my heart's soaking wet 
Boy your boots can leave a mess 

Hey Jupiter 
nothing's been the same 
so are you gay 
are you blue 
Thought we both could use a friend to run to 
and I thought you wouldn't have to keep 
with me 
hiding 

Thought I knew myself so well 
all the dolls I had 
Took my leather off the shelf 
Your apocalypse was fab 
for a girl who couldn't choose 
between the shower or the bath 
and I thought I wouldn't have to be with you 
a magazine 

No one's picking up the phone 
Guess it's clear he's gone 
and this little masochist 
is lifting up her dress 
Guess I thought I could never feel the things 
I feel 

Hey Jupiter 
nothing's been the same 
so are you gay 
Are you blue 
Thought we both could use a friend to run to 
Hey Jupiter 
nothing's been the same 
so are you safe 
now we're through 
Thought we both could use a friend to run to 
Hey Jupiter
