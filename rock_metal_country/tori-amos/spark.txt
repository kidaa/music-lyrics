she's addicted to nicotine patches 
she's addicted to nicotine patches 
she's afraid of the light in the dark 
6.58 are you sure where my spark is 
here 
here 
here 

she's convinced she could hold back a glacier 
but she couldn't keep Baby alive 
doubting if there's a woman in there somewhere 
here 
here 
here 

you say you don't want it again 
and again but you don't don't really mean it 
you say you dont want it 
this circus we're in 
but you don't you don't really mean it you don't really mean it 

if the Divine master plan is perfection 
maybe next i'll give Judas a try 
trusting my soul to the ice cream assassin 
here, here, here 
you say you don't want it again 
and again but you don't really mean it 
you say you don't want it 
this circus we're in 
but you don't you don't really mean it you don't really mean it 

how many fates turn around in the overtime 
ballerinas that have fins that you'll never find 
you thought that you were the bomb yes well so did i 
say you don't want it 
say you don't want it 
say you don't want it again 
and again but you don't really mean it 
say you don't want it 
this circus we're in 
but you don't you don't really mean it you don't really mean it

she's afraid of the light in the dark 
6.58 are you sure where my spark is
