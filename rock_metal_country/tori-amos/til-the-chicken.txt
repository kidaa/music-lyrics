So some say she got 
Green enough field 
And some say she got 
Too many strings 
With petticoats out 
And goin' hall gown 

The sweetest nylon 
No not where she's gone 
Gonna raise his tail 
And wraggle his wings 

Some say she got 
Plenty of stockings 
Some say she got 
Some Divas and Kramer 
Why all this spare 
Then shaking her tail 

The sweetest nylon 
No not where he's gone 
Gonna raise his tail 
And wraggle his wings 
Until the little chicken come home
