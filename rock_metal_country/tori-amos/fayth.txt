Make it in the city 
Do what you can 
Wave to the boy with a gun in his hand 
Hey
Lollipop girls pave the street 
Stand in line to be in your limousine 
You took my love 
You took my money 
You took my sex 
Took my love 
Took my money 
Give me 

Fayth
Help me keep myself together 
With a little more Fayth 
With a little more Fayth yeah 
Fayth
I could keep our love together 
With a little more Fayth 
I could wake up and face the day 

How do you keep the romance there 
When a little French maid 
Lives downstairs 
Radio blasts as the baby cries 
Run to the dragon that runs my life 
You took my love 
You took my money 
You took my sex 
Took my love 
Took my money 
Give me 

Fayth
Help me keep myself together 
With a little more Fayth 
With a little more Fayth yeah 
Fayth
I could keep our love together 
With a little more Fayth 
I could wake up and face the day 

I could wake up and face the day 
Maybe I could start again 
Why am I afraid of change 
Maybe Fayth could understand 
Darlin' I remember when 
I held the violets in my hand 
Love can crush, held too tight 
We could bring it back alive 
With a little more 
Fayth

Fayth
I could keep our love together 
With a little more Fayth...
