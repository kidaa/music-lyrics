Hey Hey
She's a Beauty Queen
My sweet bean bag in the street
Take it
Down out to the laundry scene
Don't know why she's in my hand
Can't figure what it is
But I lie again

I got me some horses
To ride on
To ride on
They say that your demons
Can't go there
So I got me some horses
To ride on
To ride on
As longs as your army
Keeps perfectly still
And maybe I'll find me a sailor
A tailor
And maybe together
We'll Make mother well
So I got me some horses
To ride on
To ride on
As long as you army
Keeps perfectly still
You showed me the meadow
And Milkwood
And Silkwood
and you would if I would
But you never would
So I chased down your posies
Your pansies in my hosies
Then opened me hands
And they were empty then

Off with Superfly
Sniffing a Sharpie pen
Honey it's Bill and Ben
Off with Superfly
Counting your bees
Oh me honey like
One two three
The camera is rolling
It's easy like
One
Two
Three
And if there is a way to find you
I will find you
But will you find me if Neil
Makes me a tree 
an afro
a pharaoh
I can't go
You said so
And threads that are golden
Don't break easily
So I got me some horses
To ride on
To ride on
You say that your demons
Can't go there
So I got me some horses
To ride on
To ride on
As long as your army
Keeps perfectly still
Keeps perfectly still
Keeps perfectly still
