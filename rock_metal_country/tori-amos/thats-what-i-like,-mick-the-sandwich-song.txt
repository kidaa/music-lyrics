Cheese and onion sandwiches on derby chinaware 
Fiddles and jigs and Woogie my dog and TV havin' a swear 
Takin' my dad for a pint or two 
A Sunday morning stroll 
Licorice pipes and baggy suits 
Glen Hoddle scorin' a goal 
Catchin' a pike and ridin' my bike on wooden wheels 
And a bowl of eels 
Yes... that's what I like, boy 
That's what I like 

Pie and mash and liquor 
Walking about in the rain 
William Brookes and comical looks 
Pianos, trams and trains 
Colds and cockles and thunderstorms 
Place on the wireless and now 
Grandfather clocks and coke and brandy 
Fountain pens and Pinot and Dante 
That's what I like, I said 
Hey, that's what I like 

Little pubs out in the country 
Mother Pearl and Bernard Faire 
The sound of a banjo 
Barbershop singing and having a kip in the chair 
Burnt on toast 
A beer from the wood and old Jerry Thomas' teeth 
Jerry and Chuck and cannon and ball 
A banjo pickin' Bill Keith 
And old bank loads 
Wood burnin' stoves and Shirley MacLaine 
In "Petticoat Lane" 
That's what I like, I said 
That's what I like, yes boy 
Yes, that's just, ohh 

Bubble and squeak and jumble says Little Richard and Jerry Lee 
Bonfire night and south and that's paddlin' in the sea 
Polished brass and copper 
Salvation Army bands 
Violins and old coat shins and colored elastic bands 
Tea in the mornin' and winter beginnin' and fishin' rods 
And frogs and sparrows are winning 
Yes that's what I like 
Hey that's what I like 

A day at the races 
Cover the bases 
Goin' doin bar-hoppin' in Kent 
A new pair of braces 
Little kids faces sleeping under the tin 
And wagons 
Chickens and pickin' blackberries and swallows and sledges 
And Devon and derries 
And haddock and trotters and horses and knickers 
And swatters and stickers 
And banjo 
And kippers 
Yeah, that's what I like, boy 
That's what I like
