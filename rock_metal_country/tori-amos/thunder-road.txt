The screen door slams 
Mary's dress waves 
Like a vision she dances across the porch 
As the radio plays 
Roy Orbison sings for the lonely 
Hey that's me and I want you only 
Don't turn me home again 
I just can't face myself alone again 

Don't run back inside 
You know just what I'm here for 
You're scared and you're thinking 
That maybe we ain't that young anymore 
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night 
You ain't a beauty, but hey you're alright 
Oh and that's alright, I said, boy, 
That's alright with me 

Oh come take my hand 
Driving out tonight to the promised land 
Oh Thunder Road, oh Thunder Road 
Oh Thunder Road 

Show a little faith, there's magic in the night 
You ain't a beauty, but hey you're alright 
Oh and that's alright 
That's alright with me
