Daisy dead petals 
That is her name 
She's in her phone booth phase, so 
Underneath the shade of a peppermint tray 
She can turn it out 
With a heal on 
She just rides into town 
Knowing what they'll say 
Knowing they're around the corner 
Got a crack in 
Got a crack in some strange places 

Daisy dead petals 
That is her name 
So maybe she tastes like a hamburger maid, well 
These dead petals, honey 
Brought me here 
She said 
These dead petals, honey 
Brought me here 

Dancing on a dime 
Hearing mother cry 
Maybe she's around the corner 
Got a crack in 
Got a crack in some strange places 
On my back with 
On my back with some dirty dishes 

Falling down, falling down 
All over the river 
Falling down, falling down 
Falling down 
Wish what I'm feeling 
Could go on like this forever 
Falling down, falling down 
Falling down 

And since we're down 
Might as well stay 
Might as well fry some eggs 
And wave to the shade of the peppermint tray 
She's a new friend 
Not a skeleton 
To ride into town 
Knowing what they'll say 
Knowing she tastes like a hamburger maid, but 
These dead petals, honey 
Brought me here 
She said 
These dead petals, honey 
Brought me here
