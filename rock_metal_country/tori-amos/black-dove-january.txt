She was a january girl
She never let on how insane it was
In that tiny kinda scary house
By the woods
By the woods
By the woods

Black-dove
Black-dove
You're not a helicopter
You're not a por out either
Black-dove
Black-dove
You don't need a pace ship
They don't know you've already lived
On the other side of the galaxy
The other side of the galaxy
The other side of teh galaxy

She had a january world
So many storms not right somehow
How a lion becomes a mouse
By the woods
By the woods
By the woods
By the woods
By the woods
By the woods
But I have to get to TEXAS
Said I have to get to TEXAS
And I'll give away my blue blue dress

Black-dove
Black-dove
You don't need a pace ship
They don't know you've already lived
On the other side of the galaxy
The other side of the galaxy
The other side of the galaxy

But I have to get to TEXAS
Said I have to get to TEXAS
And I'll give away my blue blue dress

She has a january girl
She never let on how insane it was
In that thing kinda scary house
By the woods
By the woods
By the woods
By the woods
