Standin on a corner in Winslow Arizona
And I'm quite sure I'm in the wrong song
2 girls 65 got a piece tied up in the
Back seat
"Honey we're Recovering Christians"

In the Springtime of his voodoo
He was going to show me spring

And right there for a minute
I know you so well

Got an angry snatch
Girls you konw what I mean
When swivelin that hip doesn't do the trick
Me pureed sanitarily Mr. Sulu
Warp speed
Warp speed
Warp speed
In the Springtime of his voodoo

Every road leads back to my door
Ever road I will follow
Every road leads back to my door
Got all your crosses loaded

And I know she's not that
Foxy
Boys
I said I know she's not that 
Foxy but
You gotta owe something sometimes
You gotta owe
When you're your momma's sunshine
You've got to give something sometimes
When you're the sweetest cherry
In an apple pie
I need some voodoo on these prunes
In the springtime of his voodoo
He was going to show me spring
