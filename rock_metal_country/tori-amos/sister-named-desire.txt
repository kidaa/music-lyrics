Got a sister named Desire 
They don't let you 
Like those little boys 
By their house 
On the backyard swing 
I know of it 'cause 
I thought we told 
Some little sweet stories 
In the parking lot 

They say that girl lost her sway 
The say that girl lost her sway 
That day 

God I'd like to drag him 
For a long way 'cause maybe I 
Then I'd just cry a little tear 
Near him to that sleepy safe place 
And I'm gonna take him by myself 
If I've got to go 
Don't let you know 
Let you know 
Where she goes to with those 
Me as I interfere 

That girl lost her sway 
They say that girl lost her sway 
That day 

Teach me about them old worlds big brother 
And in an elevator 
Where somebody can get out 
With the sound 

They say that girl lost her sway 
Just watch it 
Just watch it slip through my hands, boy 
Watch it go 
Oh, what you know 
I guess 
I see 
Just see 
'Cause she still can sway
