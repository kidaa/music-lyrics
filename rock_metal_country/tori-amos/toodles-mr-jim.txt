Toodles Mr. Jim 
You cherry picker 
Toodles I say, so long 
Hear that your grave's a little warm 
You stickler 
Sing 'em all your happy song 
It's today 
Today Sunday 
By your grave 

I say toodles Mr. Jim 
The cherry picker 
Taught me so well 
How to spell those red in 
Hey
You know she deserved that nose 
Splattered and swattered 
Blood in my hands 
Not a nice day for your little girl 
But you came to my aid instead 

Now it's toodles Mr. Jim 
You cherry picker 
Build that ladder well 
Teach me just where those boys can climb 
When they've got a spell 

Toodles Mr. Jim 
You are my sweet 
Favourite neighbor of them all 
Of them 
Girls go to their parties 
I don't care 
'Cause I'm with you 
Still
