If you don't treat me better 
Baby I'll just run away 
Baby I don't know what drives you 
To play all these silly games 
C'mon baby 
I'm much stronger than you know 
Sometimes
I'm not afraid to let it show 

When will you wake up 
I want you more than the stars and the sun 
But I can take only so much 
Cool on your island 
Is it cool on your island 

I gotta brand new dress babe 
Could it make you wanna try 
I guess I didn't want to notice 
The stars gone from your eyes 
C'mon baby 
I'm much stronger than you know 
Sometimes
I'm not afraid to let it show 

When will you wake up 
I want you more than the stars and the sun 
But I can take only so much 
Cool on your island 
Is it cool on your island 

We could buy an airplane 
Build a home in the sand 
You could tell your secrets 
I could understand 
But then by the morning 
Comes crumblin' down 
And as your leavin' 
Wait

When will you wake up 
I want you more than the stars and the sun 
But I can take only so much 
Cool on your island 
Is it cool, baby 
When will you wake up 
I want you more than the stars and the sun 
But I can take only so much 
Cool on your island 
You're so cool on your island 
Is it cool on your island 
Is it cool baby 

If you don't treat me better 
Baby I'll just run away 
Cool on your island 
If you don't treat me 
One day you'll wake up cold 
Yeah, then you'll know 
You'll know 
You'll know 
You love me
