in my platforms I hit the floor 
fell face down 
didn't help my brain out 
then the baby came before I found 
the magic how to keep her happy 
I never was the fantasy 
of what you want wanted me to be 

Don't judge me so harsh little girl 
so you got a playboy mommy 
but when you tell em my name 
and you want to cross that Bridge all on your own 
little girl they'll do you no harm 
cause they know your playboy mommy 
but when you tell em my name 
from here to Birmingham 
I got a few friends 

I never was there was there when it counts 
I get my way 
you're so like me 
you seemed ashamed 
ashamed that I was 
a good friend of American soldiers 
I'll say it loud here by your grave 
those angels can't ever take my place 

somewhere where the the orchids grow 
I can't find those church bells 
that played when you died 
played Gloria 
talkin' 'bout Hosanah 

don't judge me so harsh little girl 
you got a playboy mommy, come home 
but when you tell them soldiers my name 
cross that Bridge all on your own 
little girl they'll do you no harm 
they know your playboy mommy 
but I'll be home 
I'll be home to take you in my arms
