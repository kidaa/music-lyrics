Dawn Roses, that is what you call 
All the girls in the world 
Even the thorns 
You're surrounded by an army of two 
Who adore you. 

Our joy isn't about a present 
Or a grown-up .....? 
Little boys are getting an honourable mention from me 
But this year I'm thinking 

Shower the world 
Shower the world 
Shower the world with pink if you please 
Shower the world 
Shower the world 

Black satin is what I wore 
That, and our hearts left on the floor 
How was I in that marshmallow snow 
To know my life would change that night 

Our joy isn't about a present 
Or a grown-up .... ? 
Little boys are getting an honourable mention from me 
But this year I'm thinking 

Shower the world 
Shower the world 
Shower the world with pink if you please 
Shower the world 
Shower the world 
Shower the world in pink 

We will paint the town 
Champagne never looked so divine 
On his lips the sweetest words: 
'Love, you've given me quite a ride'.
