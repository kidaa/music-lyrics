if you're a thought 
you will want me 
to think you 
and i did invite 
a guest up until 
you announced 
you had moved in 
"what do you plan to do with all your freedom" 
the new sheriff said, 
quite proud of his badge 
"you must admit the land is now in good hands" 
yes, time will tell 
that you just life your lamp

i will follow her on her path 
scarlet's walk through the voilets 
just tell your gods for me 
all debts are off this year 
they're free to leave 
yes they're free to leave 
leaving terra leaving terra

there was a time 
when i thought 
that her destiny 
should've been mine 
big brave nation 
but instead her medicine 
now forgotten 
"what do you plan to do with all your stories" 
the new sheriff said, 
quite proud of his badge 
we'll weave them through 
every rocket's red glare 
and huddled masses 
you just lift your lamp 
i will follow. 
if you're a thought 
you will want me 
to think you 
and i did and did.
