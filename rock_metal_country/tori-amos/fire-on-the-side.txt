Purple sunset, orange moon 
I'm alone again without you 
I knew someone had to lose 

Kiss goodbye 
Go back to your separate life 
That you have with her 
Ashes blow in the windy sky
Take my heart as you go 

Baby it burns, baby it burns, baby it burns 
To be your fire on the side 
Taste my tears 
See how they burn 
Baby it burns 
To be your fire on the side 

Purple sunset, orange moon 
How can the music play 
When the only band is made of gold 
Wrapped around your hand 
That I used to hold 
Against my chest every night 
But I still can hope 
You will see I'm your home 

Baby it burns, baby it burns, baby it burns 
To be your fire on the side 
Taste my tears 
See how they burn 
Baby it burns 
To be your fire on the side 

I knew someone had to lose 
Kiss goodbye 
Go back to your separate life 
That you have with her 
Take my heart as you go 

Baby it burns, baby it burns, baby it burns 
To be your fire on the side 
Taste my tears 
See how they burn 
Baby it burns 
To be your fire on the side
