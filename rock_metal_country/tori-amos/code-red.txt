Some say that I will and some say I won't
Victory is an elusive whore
She is as easily mine
As she is yours

Slip and slide my way through this charade
I know all the players and I must say
Do this long enough
You get a taste for it

I'll do this last one and I'll grow me some wine
Leave them troubled boys all behind
What you stole, I would have given freely
Code Red you're staring Code Red staring at me

Well sometimes he do and sometimes he don't
Sometimes I love myself best alone
Do this long enough
You get a taste for it

A six pack of Coke and a bottle of Jack
"whatever you do" he said "look after that," yeah well
Being trusted and lusted
It could be worse than that

I'll do this last one and I'll grow me some wine
Leave them troubled boys all behind
What you stole, I would have given freely
Code Red staring Code Red staring

Come on baby I can drink you down
Then I have my job to do and do well
Since you won't give guarantees

I'll be cashing out
I'll do this last one and I'll grow me some wine
Leave them troubled boys all behind
Said I'll do this last one and I'll grow me some wine
Leave them troubled boys all behind

What you stole, I would have given freely
Code Red staring Code Red staring
