Sights and Sounds 
pull me back down 
another year 

I WAS HERE 
I WAS HERE 

Whipping past 
the reflecting pool 
me+you
skipping school 

And we make it up 
as we go along 
We make it up we 
go along 

You said - 
You raced from Langley - 
pulling me underneath 
a Cherry Blossom 
canopy
-Do I Have- 
Of course I have, 
Beneath my raincoat, 
I have your photographs. 
And the sun on your 
Face
I'm freezing that frame 

And somewhere Alfie cries 
and says "Enjoy his every smile 
You can see in the dark 
Through the eyes of Laura Mars" 
How did it go so fast 
you'll say 
as we are looking 
back
and then we'll 
understand
we held gold dust 
in our 
hands

Sights and Sounds 
pull me back down 
another year 

I WAS HERE 
I WAS HERE 

Gaslights
Glow in the street 
flickering past 
Twilight held us 
in her palm 
as we walked along 

And we make it up 
as we go along 
We make it up as we go along 

Letting names 
Hang in the 
Air
What color hair 
auburn crimson 
Autumn knowingly 
Stared
and the day that 
She came 
I'm freezing that 
Frame
I'm freezing that frame 

And somewhere Alfie 
smiles
and says "Enjoy her 
every cry 
You can see in the 
dark
Through the eyes 
Of Laura Mars" 

How did it go so 
Fast
You'll say as we are looking back 
and then we'll understand 
We held gold dust 
in our 
hands

in our 
hands
