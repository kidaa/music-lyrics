Caught a lite sneeze caught a lite breeze
Caught a lightweight lightingseed
Boys on my left side
Boys on my right side
Boys in th emiddle
And you're not here I need a big oan
From the girl zone

Building
tumbling down
Didn't know our love was so small
Coun't stand at all
Mr. St. John just bring you son

The spire is hot
And my cells can't feed
And you still got that Belle dragging your foots
I'm hiding it well Sister Ernestine
But I still got that Belle
Dragging my foots

Right on time you get closer
And closer
Called my name but there's no way in
Use that fame
Rent you wife and kids today
Maybe she will
Maybe she will caught a lite sneeze
Dreamed a little dream
Made my own pretty hate machine
Boys on my left side
Boys on my right side
Boys in the middle and you're not here
Boys in their dresses
And you're not here
I need a big loan from the girl zone
