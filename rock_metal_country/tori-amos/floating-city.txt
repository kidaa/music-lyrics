You went away 
Why did you leave me 
You know I believed you 
Nothing explained 
Where are the answers 
I know I need you 

Tell me 
Is your city paved with gold 
Is there hunger 
Do your people grow old 
Do your governments 
Have secrets that they've sold 

Every night I wait 
Take me away 
To your floating city 
By my window at night 
I see the lights 
To your floating city 
Come and take me away 
I want to play in your 
Floating city yeah 
Floating city yeah 

T.V. turns off 
Any of us that 
Say that we've seen you 
Tell me are we 
The only planet 
That can't conceive you 

Will we be like Atlantis 
Long ago 
So assured that we're advanced 
With what we know 
That our spirit 
Never had time to grow 

Every night I wait 
Take me away 
To your floating city 
By my window at night 
I see the lights 
To your floating city 
Come and take me away 
I want to play in your 
Floating city yeah 
Floating city yeah 

Is it weak to look for 
Saviors out in space 
Little earth she tries so hard 
To change our ways 
Sometimes she must get sick 
Of this place 

Every night I wait 
Take me away 
To your floating city 
By my window at night 
I see the lights 
To your floating city 
Come and take me away 
I want to play in your 
Floating city yeah 
Floating city yeah
