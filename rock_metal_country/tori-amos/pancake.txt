i'm not sure who's fooling who here 
as i'm watching your decay 
we both know you could deflate 
a 7 hurricane 
seems like you and your tribe 
decided you'd rewrite the law 
segregate the mind 
from body and soul 

[CHORUS:]
you give me yours 
i'll give you mine 
cause i can look your god 
right in the eye 
you give me yours 
i'll give you mine 
you used to look my god 
right in the eye 

i believe in defending 
in what we once 
stood for 
it seems in vogue 
to be a closet 
misogynist homophobe 

a change of course in 
our direction 
a dash of truth 
spread thinly 
like a flag 
on a popstar 
on a benzodiazapene 

[CHORUS]

oh zion please 
remove your glove 
and dispel every 
trace 
of his spoken word 
that has lodged 
in my vortex 

i'm not sure who's fooling who here 
as i'm watching your decay 
we both know you could deflate 
a 7 hurricane 
you could have spared 
her - oh but no 
messiahs need 
people dying in their 
name
you say "i ordered you a 
pancake" 
you say "i ordered you a 
pancake"
