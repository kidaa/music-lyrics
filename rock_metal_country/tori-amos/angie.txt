Angie, Angie 
When will those clouds all disappear 
Angie, Angie 
Where will it lead us from here 
With no loving in our souls 
And no money in our coats 
You can't say we're satisfied 
But Angie, Angie 
You can't say we never tried 

Angie, you're beautiful 
But ain't it time we said good-bye 
All the dreams we held so close 
Seemed to all go up in smoke 
Let me whisper in your ear 
Angie, Angie 
Where will it lead us from here 

With no loving in our souls 
And no money in our coats 
You can't say we're satisfied 
Angie
I still love you, baby 
Ev'rywhere I look I see your eyes 
There ain't a woman that comes close to you 
Dry your eyes 
Hey Angie, Angie 
You can't say we never tried 
Angie
I still love you 
Ain't it time we said good-bye
