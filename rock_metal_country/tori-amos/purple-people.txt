Well hey do you do Judo
when they surround you
A little mental yoga
will they disappear

It's grim but never dubious as motives go
One thing she'll always promises 
promises is a show 
Thunder wishes it could be the Snow
Wishes it could be as loved as she can be
These gifts are here 
for her
for you
for me 

I watch me be this other thing and never know
if I'm marooned or where the purple people go
then lily white matricide 
from vicious words
it doesn't leave a scratch 
so therefore no one's hurt 

Thunder wishes it could be the Snow
Wishes it could be as loved as she can be
These gifts are here 
for her
for you
for me

And don't you know
The nurses make it clear
Just when you've escape 
you have yourself to fear
a restaurant that never has to close
Breakfast, every hour
it could save the world 

so hey do you do Judo in your finery
an angel's face is tricky to wear constantly 

Thunder wishes it could be the Snow
Wishes it could be as loved as she can be
These gifts are here 
for her
for you
for me
For her
for her
