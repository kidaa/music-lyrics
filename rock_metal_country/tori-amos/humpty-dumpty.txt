Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall 
Humpty dumpty had a great big fall 
All the kings horses 
And all the kings men 
Couldn't put Humpty together again 

Humpty dumpty and Betty Louise 
Stole a Sony and some Camembert cheese 
She said "Humpty baby, take me 
Oooh, yeah, take me to the river 
'Cause I like the way it runs, yeah, 
Take me to the river 
You know I like the way it runs, yeah" 

He said 
"Everything's going my way" 
He said 
"Maybe it's my lucky day" 
And he said 
"Anything you want 
I can give" 
She said, "I wanna take your picture 
Just for me" 
He said, "Anything" 
She said, "Up there, baby 
Get on the wall babe" 

Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall 
And looked at her as he was falling 
And all the kings horses 
And all the kings men 
Couldn't put Humpty together again 

Hey, Betty Louise 
Hey, Betty Louise 
She said, "I like 
Custard in the summer, honey 
Oh yeah, what it takes to be queen 
Hey, what it takes to be queen 
What it takes to be...oh"
