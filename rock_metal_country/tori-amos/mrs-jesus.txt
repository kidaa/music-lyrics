life lines and suicide crimes -- 
he found me in a state 
grabbed my purse and hitched a ride 
with a mrs. jesus "how you been" 
i've been cruisin' a good invention 
but in some ways 
i don't think it gets any easier
your walking on the water 
bit by far my favourite one, 
but now it seems we're drowning 
in a drop of water love
and even as i'm climbing up the stairs 
i know there's heaven there 
and then empty arms that comes 
with the morning star 
well, made my bed of 
cut roses by understanding 
that the cause 
it just comes first 
with my mrs. jesus 
the gospel changes meaning 
if you follow john or paul 
and could you ever let it be 
the mary of it all 
and even as i'm climbing up the stairs 
well, life lines and suicide crimes
there's the something every day 
and there's someone always paging 
my mrs. jesus 
your walking on the water 
so if you get the jones at the crossroad 
the personals are great 
if you're my way 
let me love you mrs. jesus
