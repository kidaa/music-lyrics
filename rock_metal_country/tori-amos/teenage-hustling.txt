You think you can come around here
All up in his face
All up in my world

You better know you better know you better know
I'm at your door I'm at your door I'm at your door
You better know you better know you better know
I'm at your door I'm at your door I'm at your

You gotta right you gotta right to know
You gotta right you gotta right to know 
Me and my Teenage Hustling

I've been workin' it
Since I'z fourteen
Me and my Teenage Hustling
It's gonna save me
Save me save me save me save me save me
From your dirty dealings
You're a Dirty Girl
You're such a Dirty Girl

You better know you better know you better know
I'm at your door I'm at your door I'm at your door
You better know you better know you better know
I'm at your door I'm at your door I'm at your

Maybe the riddle of this accident
Goes back to your gossip
With a ferocious strategy
You play wounded in his cockpit
But I think that you forgot my days
Of Teenage Hustling
You better know you better know you better know
I'm at your door I'm at your door I'm at your door
You better know you better know you better know
I'm at your door I'm at your door I'm at your

You gotta right you gotta right to know
You gotta right you gotta right to know
You gotta right you gotta right to know

Me and my Teenage Hustling
I've been workin' it
Since I'z fourteen
Me and my Teenage Hustling
I've been workin' it
Since I'z fourteen

But you been skankin' around
With your talentless trash
You only shoot blanks
At your cocksure best
Me and my Teenage Hustling
Me and my Teenage Hustling

It's gonna save me
Save me save me save me save me save me
From your dirty dealings
Now I don't mind a Dirty Girl
I don't mind a Dirty Girl

You better know you better know you better know
I'm at your door I'm at your door I'm at your door

You better know you better know you better know
I'm at your door I'm at your door I'm at your door
