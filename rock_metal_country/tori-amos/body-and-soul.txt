Sweet Communion
Sweet Communion

I have waited all my life
You say you are bonafide
To be my judge
Lay your law down on me love

Seven devils bring them on
I have left my weapons
'cause I think you're wrong
These devils of yours they need love

Come and kneel with me Body and Soul
Come and kneel with me Body and Soul
Body and Soul Body and Soul Body and Soul

Sweet Communion
Sweet Communion
In my temple boy be warned
Violence doesn't have a home now but ecstasy
That's as pure as a woman's gold

Seven devils bring them on
I have left my weapons
'cause I think you're wrong
These devils of yours they need love

Come and kneel with me Body and Soul
Come and kneel with me Body and Soul
Body and Soul Body and Soul Body and Soul

I'll save you from that sunday sermon
Boy I think you need a conversion
Body and Soul

Come and kneel with me Body and Soul
Come and kneel with me Body and Soul
Body and Soul Body and Soul Body and Soul
