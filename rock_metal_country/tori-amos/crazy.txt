not sayin' 
not charmed at all 
not sayin' 
that you weren't worth 
the fall 
and i was alone when 
i knew it was real 
down the canyon 
when i knew i had come 

to the line 
through the dawn 
to the light 
to the turn 
when you said 

you could drive 
all night 
drive all night 

so i let crazy 
take a spin 
then i let crazy 
settle in 
kicked off my shoes 
shut reason out 
he said "first let's just 
unzip your religion 
down" 

found that i 
i craved at all 
saw me melt 
into your 
native shelter 
where you carved my 
name 
paper tigers scare 
and came 

alive 
through the dawn 
to the light 
to the turn 
when you said 

you could drive all night 
all night 
drive all night 

so i let crazy 
take a spin 
then i let crazy 
settle in 
kicked off my shoes 
shut reason out 
he said "first let's just 
unzip your religion 
down" 
so i let crazy 
pull me in 
then i let crazy 
take his spin 
kicked off my shoes 
shut reason out 
he said "first let's just unzip 
your religion down" 
heard that you were once 
"temptation's girl" 

and as soon 
as you have 
rearranged the mess 
in your head 
he will show up looking 
sane 
perfectly sane 
if i know crazy
