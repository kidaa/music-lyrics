Alamo
Heard all about your fandango 
Banged on my knees 
On your bay door 
Only to wake you 
To blues on the way 
Blues on the way 
Blues on the way 

Embarcadere
Figures you'll see me as older 
Twenty-three hours till the border 
Don't think I'll be going 
As fast as I came 
Fast as I came 
Fast as I came 

Tears on my pillow 
Of course they're not mine 
Alter that altar 
Make it a play 
Somebody invent the telephone line 
I'll take my chances 

Alamo
Wish I could do what God does 
Heard that the stars were in order 
God you served out a hand 
With two queen of spades 
And blues on the way 
Blues on the way 

Tears on my pillow 
Of course they're not mine 
Alter that altar 
Make it a play 
Somebody just 
Somebody invent the telephone line 
I'll take my chances
