she was a january girl 
she never let on how insane it was 
in that tiny kinda scary house 
by the woods 
by the woods 
by the woods 

black-dove black-dove 
you're not a helicopter 
you're not a cop out either honey 
black-dove black-dove 
you don't need a space ship 
they don't know you've already lived 
on the other side of the galaxy 
she had a january world 
so many storms not right somehow 
how a lion becomes a mouse 
by the woods 
but i have to get to TEXAS 
said i have to get to TEXAS 
and I'll give away my blue blue dress 
she has a january girl 
she never let on how insane it was 
in that tiny kinda scary house 
by the woods
