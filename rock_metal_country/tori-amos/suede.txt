suede you always felt like suede 
there are days I feel your twin 
peekaboo hiding underneath your skin 
jets. are revving yes revving 
and this. has power over me. not because 
you feel something 
or don't feel something for me 
but because. mass. so big. 
it can swallow swallow her whole star intact. 
call me 'evil' call me 
'tide is on your side' anything that you want. 
anybody knows you can conjure anything 
by the dark side of the moon. boy. and if 
you keep your silence silencer on 
you'll talk yourself right into a job. 
out of a hole into my bayou 
i'm sure that you've been briefed my 
absorption lines. they are frayed and I fear. 
my fear is greater than my faith 
but I walk. the missionary way. 
you always felt like suede 
there are days I am your twin 
peekaboo hiding underneath your skin 
jets. are revving. yes revving from 
an ether twist . 
call me 'evil' little sister. I guess 
i'd do the same. little sister. 
you'll forgive me one day.
