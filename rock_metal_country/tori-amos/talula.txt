Congradulate you 
said you had a double tongue 
Balancing cake and bread 
Say goodbye to a glitter girl 

Talula 
Talula 
You don't want to lose her 
She must be worth losing 
if it is worth something 
Talula 
Talula 
She's brand new now to you 
Wrapped in your papoose 
Your little fig newton 

Say goodbye to the old world 

Ran into the henchman who severed 
Anne Bolyn 
He did it right quickly a merciful man 
She said 1+1 is 2 
but Henry said that it was 3 
So it was 
Here I am 

Talula 
Talula 
I don't want to lose it 
It must be worth losing if it is worth something 
Talula 
Talula 
She's brand new now to you 
Wrapped in your papoose 
your little fig newton 

and Jamaica 
Do you know what I have done 
Mary M weaving on said 
what you want is in the blood of senators 

I got Big Bird on the fishing line 
I got a bit of a shout bit of a shout 
a bit of an angry snout 
He's my faourite hooker of the whole bunch 
and I know about his only bribe 
and how the Russians die on the ice 
I got my rape hot on 
honey but I always could accessorise 
and I never cared too much for the money 
but I know right now 
that it's in God's hands 
but I don't know who the father is 

Talula 
Talula 
I don't want to lose him 
he must be worth losing 
if it is worth something 
Talula 
Talula 
He's brand new now to you 
Wrapped in your papoose 
Your little fig newton
