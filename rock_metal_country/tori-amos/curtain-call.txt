Ebony beauty, passed this shade 
The looking glass, reflects 
Then a voice, calls me back 
This is just circumstance; it is not personal 
Oh no, it never is 
Then you ram your hand in your bag for a little friendly substance 
By the time you're 25, they will say 
You've gone and blown it 
By the time you're 35, I must confide 
You will have, blown them up 
Right on queue, just act surprised, when they invite you to take you, curtain call 
You climbed china's wall; 
You, curtain call 
I've done what I've done, and it has the ultimate consequence 
Then a voice calls me back 
This is not business, no it's more like, spiritual 
It's not what it is 
Then you ram your hand in your bag for a little protection 

By the time you're 25, they will say 
You've gone and blown it 
By the time you're 35, I must confide 
You will have, blown them up 
Right on queue, just act surprised, when they invite you to take you, curtain call 
You've climbed, china's wall 
You, curtain call 
The closed china's wall 
Curtain call 

Ebony beauty, passed this shade 
The looking glass reflects
