Glasses raised we all say cheers 
Could this be the one 
Our new year 

Even after all this time 
I don't know why 
Why you went away 

Lately Im sure it's 
You there waving 
In the distance 
Closer 
The closer I get 
Disappointment 

It is, yes it is 
They just have the same color of your hair 

You're not there 
You're not there 

Every corner that I turn 
I've convinced myself 
One day you'll be there 

Choruses of Auld Lang Syne 
Could this be the year 
Yours and mine 

Lately Im sure it's 
You there waving 
In the distance 
Closer 
The closer I get 
Disappointment 

It is, yes it is 
They just have the same color of your hair 

You're not there 
You're not there 
You're not there 
You're not there 
You're not there 
You're not there 
You're not there 
You're not there 

Glasses raised we all say cheers 
Could this be the one 
This could be the one 
Could this be the one 
Our new year
