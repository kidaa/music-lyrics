Stinky soul  
Get a little lost in my own  
Hey General  
Need a little love in that hole of yours  
So one ways now and Saturdays now  
And our kittens all wrapped in cement  

From cradle to gumdrops  
Got me running girl as fast as I can  
And is it right, Butterfly,  
They like you better framed and dried  

Daddy, dear  
If I can kill one man  
Why not two?  
Well, nurses smile  
When you've got iron veins  
You can't stain their pretty shoes  
And pompoms and cherry blondes  
And the kittens still wrapped in cement  

From God's saviours to gumdrops  
Got me running girl as fast as I can  
And is it right, Butterfly, 
They like you better framed and dried  

Got a pretty pretty garden  
Pretty garden, yes
