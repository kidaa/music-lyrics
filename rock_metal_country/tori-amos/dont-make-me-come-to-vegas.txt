don't make me come to vegas 
don't make me pull you out of his bed 
i am vigilant that it will not be 
you on the menu he's serving up for his friends 
don't make me come to vegas 
don't make me pull him out of your head 
athena will attest 
that it could be done 
and it has been done 
and i think that i am up to it 
and the jacaranda tree 
is telling me of the trouble you're in 
just by the way 
she bends remember dancing and wondering 
as you were swaying 
what kind of woman you'd be 
"what will be will be" over my dead body 
slip through your hand again and again 
slip through your hand again and again
my old flame was a jester and a joker 
and as healer of men, they called him the prince 
prince of black jacks and of women 
and of anything that's slipped into his hands 
"and the ranches and the mustangs" 
and the way you said "you can have all this, except for me--
you see lady luck is my mistress 
and you'll have to play second to her wish" 
and the jacaranda tree 
is telling me it's not over yet, 
just by the way 
she bends "if you come breezin' through" 
you said "i'll know that it's you by the taste on my lips, 
bet on the deserts kiss" 
i could slip through your net 
"over my dead body" slip through your hand 
don't make me come to vegas 
hmmm
