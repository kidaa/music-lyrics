Thoughts right now 
I picked up a magazine 
Ohh here we go 
Fifteen hundred years 
Fifteen hundred years right here 
Burning witches, burning books 
Burning babies and their looks 
Yes, indeed 
Burning everything that's sacred in my genes 

Thoughts right now 
She'd been everybody else's girl 
Thoughts right now 
Now
Thoughts right now 
Right now 
Am I here 
Am I here 
Never here 
I'm never here 
I'm never here 
I'm never here 
Never a bird 
In a flower, in the tree 
In the pain of the respect thereof 
Yes, indeed 

Thoughts right now 
What will become of me 
Become of her 
Become of we, baby 
Yeah
