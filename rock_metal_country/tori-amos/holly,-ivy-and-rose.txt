Lo, how a Rose e'er blooming 
From tender stem hath sprung! 
Of Jesse's lineage coming 
By ancient sibyls sung 

A rose doth bear a flower 
All in the cold midwinter 
And at the midnight hour 

And he waits for who to find 
The heart she left behind 
And he prays she'll find her way 
To be his bride someday 

Ivy 
Of all the trees in the wood 
Holly wants/woos the Rose 
Holly and the Ivy 
When they are both full grown 
Of all the trees in the wood 
Holly bears the crown 
Holly and the Ivy 
The running of the deer 
For his Rose to bloom 
Holly waits every year 

He waits for who to find 
The heart she left behind 
He prays she'll find her way 
To be his bride someday 

Ivy 
Of all the trees in the wood 
Holly wants/woos the Rose 
Holly and the Ivy 
When they are both full grown 
Of all the trees in the wood 
Holly bears the crown 
The holly and the Ivy 
The running of the deer 
For his Rose to bloom 
Holly waits every year 
For his Rose to bloom 
Holly waits every year 
Waits every year 

Lo, how a Rose e'er blooming 
From tender stem hath sprung! 
The frozen air perfuming 
That tiny bloom doth swell 
Its rays the night illuming 
The darkness quite dispel 

O flower beyond compare 
Bloom in our heart's midwinter 
Restore the springtime here.
