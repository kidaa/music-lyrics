If the sun refused to shine 
I would still be lovin' you 
Mountains crumble to the sea 
There will still be you and me 

Kind woman, I give you my all 
Kind woman, nothing more 

Little drops of rain 
Whisper of the pain 
Tears of loves lost in the days gone by 
If my love is strong 
Here there is no wrong 
Together we shall go until we die 
My, my 
Inspiration is what you are to me 
Inspiration, look see 

If the sun refused to shine 
I would still be lovin' you 
Mountains crumble to the sea 
There will still be you and me
