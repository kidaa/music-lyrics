God I love to turn my little blue world 
Upside down 
God I love to turn my little blue world 
Upside down 
Inside my head the noise 
Chatter, chatter, chatter, chatter, chatter 
You see I'm afraid I'll always be 
Still coming out of my mother upside down 

Don't you love to turn this little blue girl 
Upside down 
Oh I know you love to turn this little blue girl baby 
Upside down 
But my heart it says 
You been shatter, shatter, shatter, shatter, shattered 
And I know you're still a boy 
Still coming out of your mother 

But when you gonna stand on your own 
I say the world is sick 
You say "Tell me what that makes us darlin'" 
You see, you always find my faults 
Faster than you find your own 
You say the world is getting rid of her demons 
I say "Baby what have you been smoking?" 
Well I dreamed, I dreamed, I dreamed 
I loved a black boy 
My daddy would scream 
Oh yeah 

Don't you love to turn this little blue girl 
Upside down 
Any kind of touch I think is better than none 
Even upside down 
But you see I'm tangled up 
Got a kitten, kitten, kitten, kitten in my hair 
Cincinnati, I like the word 
It's the only thing we can seem to turn 
Upside down 

Well I found the secret to life 
I found the secret to life 
I'm okay when everything is not okay 
I said I found the secret to life 
I found the secret to life 
I'm okay when everything is not okay 
Is not okay 

Oh, we turn and we turn our little blue world 
Upside down 
I said, don't we love to turn our little blue world baby 
Upside down 
Inside my head a voice 
Chatter, chatter, chatter, chatter, chatter 
And it says "Girl you're all the same 
Still coming out of your mothers 
Still coming out 
of your mothers 
Upside down"
