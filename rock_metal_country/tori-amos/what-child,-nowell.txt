What child is this who, laid to rest 
On Mary's lap, is sleeping? 
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet 
While shepherds watch are keeping? 

This is winter's gift 
This is what begins 

Nowell, Nowell, Nowell 
Every voice was singing 
Nowell, Nowell, Nowell 
Born this day a new Nowell 
Nowell, Nowell 

What child is this who, now awakes 
In every heart, each morning 
From dazzling light, through silver sky 
Bring peace now from creation 

This is winter's gift 
This is what begins 

Nowell, Nowell, Nowell 
Every voice was singing 
Nowell, Nowell, Nowell 
Born this day a new 
Nowell, Nowell, Nowell 
Every voice was singing 
Nowell, Nowell, Nowell 
Born this day a new 
Born this day a new Nowell 
Nowell, Nowell, Nowell.
