me, me... 
me in the corner 
me in the spotlight 
losing my religion 
thought that I heard you laughing 
thought that I heard you sing 
I think I saw you try 
consider this 
consider the lengths that I would go to 
the slip that brought me to my knees 
and I don't know if I can do it 
oh no I said too much 
I set it up 
thought that I heard you laughing 
thought that I heard you sing 
life is bigger 
bigger than you and you are not me 
the lengths that I would go to 
hey, I said too much 
I set it up 
I think I saw you try 
it's me, me... 
me in the corner 
losing my religion 
trying to keep an eye on you 
and I don't know if I can do it 
oh no, I said too much 
I set it up 
thought that I heard you laughing 
thought that I heard you sing 
losing my... 
it's me 
it's me... 
can't you see
