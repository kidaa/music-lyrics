Coughing from the smoke of a black roof chimney 
Marching to the beat of a hot roof o'er me 
Hey, ho, here we go 
We're off to work again 
Bells are ringing 
We are singing 
Joyous in our industry 

I love my job 
He loves his job 
Pull that lever 
Start the engine 
Pump the water, build the pressure 
Push the piston, press the button 
Pump the water, build the pressure 
Push the piston, press the button 
It's the perfect job 

Happy workers 
Happy workers 
Happy workers 

I love my job 
He loves his job 
Pull that lever 
Start the engine 
Pump the water, build the pressure 
Push the piston, press the button 
Pump the water, build the pressure 
Push the piston, press the button 
Pump the water, build the pressure 
Push the piston, press the button 
It's the perfect job 

Happy workers 
Happy workers 
Happy workers 

I love my job 
He loves his job 
Pull that lever 
Sister, start the engine 
Pump the water, yeah 
Honey, build the pressure 
Pump the water, build the pressure 
Push the piston, press the button 
It's the perfect job 

...It's the perfect job
