Standin on a corner in Winslow Arizona 
and I'm quite sure I'm in the wrong song 
2 girls 65 got a piece tied up in the back seat 
'Honey we're recovering Christians' 

In the springtime of his vodoo 
He was going to show me spring 

And right there for a minute 
I knew you so well 
And right there for a minute 
I knew you so well 

Got an angry snatch 
Girl you know what I mean 
when swivelin that hip doesn't do the trick 
Me pureed sanitarily Mr. Sulu 
warp speed 
warp speed 
warp speed 

In the springtime of his vodoo 
In the springtime of his vodoo 

Every road leads back to my door 
[And right there for a minute] 
Every road I will follow 
[I knew you so well] 
Every road leads back to my door 
[And right there for a minute] 
Got all your crosses loaded 

And I know she's not than foxy boys 
I said I know she's not that foxy but 
You gotta owe something sometimes 
You gotta owe when you're your momma's sunshine 
You've got to give something sometimes 
when you're the sweetest cherry in an apple pie 
I need some vodoo on these prunes 

In the springtime of his vodoo 
In the springtime of his vodoo 
He was going to show me spring
