You said you wanted safer ground 
But you got caught up in the river 
I was there to save you boy 
But you'd rather drown 
You said you were unhappy 
But that was alright 
Better than not knowin' 
What's on the other side 
And you know I was always there for you 
And you know I always believed in you 
I guess that wasn't enough 

On the boundary 
On the boundary baby 
On the boundary 
Don't you need my love 
You won't even let me 
Keep from fallin' 
From the boundary 
That divides our love 

I gave you a kingdom 
That you could be lord in 
And we both know you loved 
The taste of my world 
But you ran back to your corner 
Where you trip over your lines 
Look left, look right 
No room to hide 

On the boundary 
On the boundary baby 
On the boundary 
Don't you need my love 
You won't even let me 
Keep from fallin' 
From the boundary 
That divides our love 

I guess that wasn't enough 
I guess I wasn't enough 
On the boundary 
On the boundary baby 
On the boundary 
Don't you need my love 
You won't even let me 
Keep from fallin' 
From the boundary 
That divides our love
