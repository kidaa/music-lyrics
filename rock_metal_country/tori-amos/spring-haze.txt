well I know it's just a spring haze 
but I don't much like the look of it 
and if omens are a god send 
like men breezing in 
certain these clouds go somewhere 
billowing outto somewhere 
n a single engine cessna 
you say we'll never make it there 
all we do is circle it 

uh oh. let go. off on my way 
unsee this eternal wanting. 
let go 
way to go 
so I get creamed 
waiting on Sunday to drown 
waiting on sunday to drown 

and I know it's just a spring haze 
but I don't much like the look of it 
but all we do is circle it 
and I found out where my edge is 
ad it bleeds into where you resist 
and my only way out 
is to go so far in 
billowing out to somewhere 
billowing out luna riviera 
waiting on sunday to land 
waitng on sunday to drown 
why. does. it. always end up like this 
waiting on sunday 
so I get creamed 
waiting for sunday to drown
