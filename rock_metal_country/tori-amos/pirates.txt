Traveled far from my home 
Foreign streets paved with stone 
Deep in my dreams, Moroccan sand 
Now I sail my ship 
On dry land 

There is a light that 
Shines on the frontier 
Pirates yeah 
Pirates
And on a dark night 
When you feel lonely 
And the world just 
Can't understand you 
Pirates yeah 
Pirates
Yeah

Steal the jewel, watch it break 
It cuts with an eye, I can't escape 
The ruby heals, alone I stand 
When I sail my ship 
On dry land 

There is a light that 
Shines on the frontier 
Pirates yeah 
Pirates
And on a dark night 
When you feel lonely 
And the world just 
Can't understand you 
Pirates yeah 
Pirates
There is a light that 
Shines on the frontier 
Pirates yeah 
Pirates
Yeah

There is a light that 
Shines on the frontier 
And baby someday 
We're gonna be there 
Pirates yeah 
Pirates
And on a dark night 
When you feel lonely 
And when the world just 
Can't understand you 
Pirates yeah 
Pirates
There is a light that 
Shines on the frontier 
Pirates yeah 
Pirates
There is a light that 
Shines on the frontier
