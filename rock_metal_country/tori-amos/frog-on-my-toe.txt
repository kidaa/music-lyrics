Poppa I know 
There's a frog on my toe 
Maybe I'll call him Jethro 
Maybe I'll grow up to be 
As wise and as good as he 
And maybe I'll come back 
After you're long gone 

Poppa I'm sure 
The worms have eaten you now 
And Jethro's been on some Frenchy's plate 
Long ago 
Now I'm pretty sure 
That I listen to every word 
'Cause you're still here 
Telling me still 

Slap them boys when they're naughty 
Make them crawl, make you haughty 
Make you strong, little girl 
You paint them toes the reddish colour 
And you know one day 
You're gonna be bigger than a flea 
You're gonna be bigger than that old 
Poison ivy tree 

Now I'm pretty sure 
That I think you'd come and visit 
And talk sometimes 
Kind of like Gidget and 
A funny little chance 
Like an Indian Brave 
He said "We all grew fat 
When the white man came" 
But one day girl 
You're gonna learn to make them crawl 
Make them grow tall 
But have the grace 
To be a lady with disgrace 
And you fry them 'taters 
And you make them with ladies hands 
I know you're my pappy's baby
