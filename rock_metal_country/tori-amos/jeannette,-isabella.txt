Bring your torches 
Bring your torches 

With every candle raised 
With every lantern fly? 
Light after light in every village 
Welcoming home every friend 

Bring your torches 
Bring your torches 
Bring your torches, Jeanette, Isabella 
Bring your torch to the cradle, run 
Bring your torches, Jeanette, Isabella 
Bring your torch to the cradle, run 
Christ is born, O come behold Him, 
Mary calls us to adore Him 
Hush, hush! Such a lovely mother 
Hush, hush! Such a lovely son 

Bring your torches 
Bring your torches 

Wish every light will find its way 
This is what every mother prays 
Night after night 
The lights, they will guide you 
Welcoming home every friend 

Bring your torches 
Bring your torches 
Bring your torches, Jeanette, Isabella 
Bring your torch to the cradle, run 
Through the door we softly pile in? 
To his manger bed we creep 
Torches glow, the Babe discloses 
Fairest snow with cheeks like roses 
Hush, hush! Hush-a-by sweetly smiling 
Hush, hush! Hush-a-by fast asleep 

Bring your torches, Jeanette, Isabella
