Surrender then start you engines
You'll konw quite soon what me mistake
Was
For those on horseback or dog sled
You turn on at the bend in the road
I hear she still grants forgivenesss
Although I willingly forgot her
The offering is molasses and you say
I guess I'm an underwater thing so I
Guess I can't take it personally
I guess I'm an underwater thing I'm
Liquid running
There's a sea secret in me
It's plain to see it is rising
But I must be flowing liquid diamonds
Calling for my soul
At the corners of the world
I know she's playing poker with the rest of the stragglers
Calling for my sould at the corners of the world
I know she's playing poker
And if your friends don't come back to you
And you know this is madness 
A lilac mess in your prom dress
And you say 
I guess I'm and underwater thing
