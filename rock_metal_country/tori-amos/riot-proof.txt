Break the terror
Break the terror
Break the terror Of the urban spell
You know what you know
So you go break the terror
Of the urban spell
This alliance
You say I'm on the threshold
Of greatness girl
So you burn your pagoda
Through the congo
Till there's a broken bond
On the birth of the search
White trash my native son

It will all find its way in time

Blossom, riot proof

You know what you know
So you go chain her to your flow
She bites through your dried lean meant
As she's going to the movie show
In a bath of glitter and a tiny shiver
She crawls through your lava sea
Black sahara I'm stepping in to your space oddity
It will all find its wayd in time

Blossom, riot proof

The sun is warming
My man is moistening
On the bomb
On the bond on the bomb
