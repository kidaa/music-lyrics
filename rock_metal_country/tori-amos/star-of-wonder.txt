We three kings are coming again 
Bearing gifts from the East 
From the East 

Some say a star will rise again 
In the hearts of humankind 
Some say we have been in exile 
What we need is solar fire 

Star of wonder, star of night 
Star of royal beauty 
Westward leading, still proceeding 
A star 
A star of wonder 

We bring gold and myrrh for him 
From the East, frankincense 
From the East 

Some say a star will rise again 
In the hearts of humankind 
Some say we have been in exile 
What we need is solar fire 

Star of wonder, star of night 
Star of royal beauty 
Westward leading, still proceeding 
A star 

Star of wonder, star of night 
Star of royal beauty 
Westward leading, still proceeding 
A star 
A star of wonder 
Of wonder.
