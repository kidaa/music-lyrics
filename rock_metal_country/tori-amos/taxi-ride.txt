lily is dancing 
on the table 
we've all been 
pushed 
too far 
i guess on days 
like this 
you know who your 
friends are 
just another dead fag 
to you that's all 
just another light missing 
on a long taxi ride 
taxi ride 

and i'm down to 
your last cigarette and 
this "we are one" crap 
as you're invading 
this thing you call 
love - she smiles 
way too much but 
i'm glad you're 
on my side, sure 
i'm glad you're on 
my side still 

you think you deserve 
a trust fund 
just because you 
want one 
sure you talk the talk 
when you need to 
i fear 
the whole world is 
starting to 
believe you 
just another dead fag 
to you that's all 
just another light missing 
in a long taxi line 
taxi line 

and i"m down to 
your last cigarette and 
this "we are one" crap 
as you're invading 
this thing you call 
love - she smiles 
way too much but 
i'm glad you're 
on my side, sure 
i'm glad you're on 
my side still
