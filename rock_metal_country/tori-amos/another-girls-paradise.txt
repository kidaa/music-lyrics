you caught me lingering 
in another girl's paradise 
the way she paints the world -- 
i want that in my life emeralds, 
you should know, 
are renting in her meadow 
with a stroke beauty lives 
how could i resist you are desire 
when it all is said said and done 
who can love you and still be standing 
there's mary calling up a storm 
can i take from you and not keep taking 
naked as day Gemma follows him 
does it all come down 
to the thing one girl fears in the night 
is another girl's paradise 
through twists and turns 
Jasmine foxed me in her grove 
arms filled with honey-bells, 
st michaels sanford bloods 
"you have come to discover what you want" 
what i want is not to want what isn't mine 
"but i am desire" when it all is said and done. 
is another girl 
is another girl 
is another girl's paradise
