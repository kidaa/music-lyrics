well he lit you up 
like amber waves in his movie show
he fixed you up real good 
till i don't know you anymore 
from ballet class to a lap dance 
straight to video 
and the pool side news 
was that he would be 
launching you 

[CHORUS:]
into every young man's 
bedroom - you gave it up 
on dvd and magazine - 
you gave it up 
a private rite of passage 
you gave it up 
to every boy's sweet dream 
with their paper cuts 

you said "he's got a 
healing machine 
it glows in the dark 
glows in the dark: 
you say "there's not a lot 
of me 
left anymore - 
just leave it alone. 
but if you're buy, and you have 
the time, tell the northern 
lights to keep shining - lately it seems like they're drowning" 

he cold light you up 
and summon every swan 
or the lakeside 
off to cabo san lucas 
for some optical stimulus 
then you started to guess 
there was someone else 
though his flint glass 
seeing all of you 
immersed in his sepia 

[CHORUS]

so i went by - 
cause i had the time, 
and told the northern lights 
to keep shining 
they told me to tell you - 
they're waving
