That guy swears he will walk
And carries a chip as big as new york
That guy
At night makes me scream
And smashes the best possibilities
That guy
Just brings his war home she cries
Why can't daddy leave his war outside?
That guy
When he wants can love
Like no other love
Until the darkness comes
Do we make up to break up?
Do we break up then wake up?
To cuts instead of kisses
To cuts instead
Instead
Instead
That guy swears he will walk
And carries a chip as big as new york
That guy
Cannot seem to see
There are no other guys
But the one he used to be
Do we make up to break up?
Do we break up then wake up?
To cuts instead of kisses
To cuts instead
Instead
Instead
Will we make up?
Will we break up?
Will I wake up with with
That guy
That guy
That guy
