Won't you smile, you look so shocked, 
put the name-tag on your smock. 
We've come to see ya, 
Eddie Walker. 
And we may pack a little tight, 
the nurse up-front says it's alright. 
And look there's more of us still getting off the bus. 
We wish you'd come back home with us. 
Eddie Walker this is your life. 
This one's you when you were small, 
and you learnt how to walk. 
They pick you up and you keep falling down. 
There you are with Aunt Louise, 
you're bouncing on her knees. 
Remember all those trees behind the garden 
They're gone. 
They all got cut down when she died. 
Eddie Walker this is your life. 
You never had a son or a wife, 
you sure had a hell of a time. 
Eddie Walker this is your life. 
You never had a son or a wife, 
you sure had a hell of a time. 
This one's you and Mary Jo. 
Well she couldn't come, she's says hello. 
No, Eddie Walker, she doesn't hate your guts. 
It's just the whole thing shook her up. 
How they picked you up and you kept falling down. 
Eddie Walker this is your life. 
You never had a son or a wife, 
you sure had a hell of a time. 
Eddie Walker this is your life. 
You never had a son or a wife, 
you never had a reason to cry. 
This whole stack, and all of these, 
for your semester overseas. 
We're gonna leave ya, 
Eddie Walker.
