Oh-oh, Oh! 

It was the start of the show 
Hiroshima 
and the people were shouting my name 
as the house lights came down 
and the spotlight followed me out 
I waved down low to the crowd 
as I busted ass on the front of the stage 

Oh-oh Oh! 
They're watching me, watching me fall 

Maybe it was the course of adrenaline 
as the concrete rose to meet my face 
Maybe it was the sheer embarrassment 
that kept me concious and standing as I 
crawled back on the stage 
and started pounding out the first song 
There was blood on the keyboard... 
..Oh my God. 

Oh-oh Oh! 
They're watching me, watching me fall 
Oh-oh Oh! 
They're watching me, watching me fall 

You wanna see what's in my head? 
You wanna see what's in my head? 
You wanna see what's in my head? 
Check it out 'cause; 
I got pictures of what's in my head 
I got pictures of what's in my head 
They took of me in Tokyo 
And I brought 'em back with me to the USA 

Oh-oh Oh! 
They're watching me, watching me fall 
Oh-oh Oh! 
They're watching me, watching me fall 
Alright, fall!
