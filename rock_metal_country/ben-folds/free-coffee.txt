Called in sick one day 
Stepped out my front door. 
Squinted up at the sky 
and strapped on my backpack. 
Got into a van 
and when I returned I had 
ex-wives and children, 
boxes of photographs 

And they gave me some food 
and they didn't charge me 
and they gave me some coffee 
but they didn't charge me 
and when I was broke I needed it more. 
But now that I'm rich, they give me coffee. 

Eating an ice cream cone 
texting with my thumbs 
flippin' off the asshole 
who pulled into my lane 
life could be longer than it's often cracked up to be 
We all get new cells every seven years. 
I feel seven a day. 
It's a good day to die again 
Now they save me my place 
Over there in the corner 
And I never get tickets 
Yeah, I only get warnings. 
But when I was broke I needed it more 
And now that I'm rich, 
I get free coffee.
