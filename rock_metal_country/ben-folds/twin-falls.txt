Christmas, twin falls, Idaho is her
Oldest memory
She was only two, it's the first time she felt blue

Cafeteria harrison, elementary
Beneath a parachute, I saw her without shoes
Seven up I touched her thumb and she knew it was me
Although she couldn't see, unless of course she peeked

My mom's good she got me out of Twin Falls, Idaho
Before I got too old
But you know how that goes
That's where she still was the summer when she turned 17
1983, three weeks after me

And last I heard, she had twins
Or maybe it was three
Although I've never seen
That don't bother me
