So you wanted to take a break 
Slow it down some, and have some space 

Well fuck you too! 
Give me my money back, 
Give me my money back, you bitch. 
I want my money back and don't forget
And don't forget to give me back my black T-shirt

I wish I hadn't bought you dinner
Right before you dumped me on your front porch
Give me my money back, give me my money back, you bitch
I want my money back and don't forget
And don't forget to give me back my black T-Shirt

So you wanted to take a break
Slow it down some and have some space

Give me my money back, give me my money back, you bitch
I want my money back
I want my money back and don't forget
