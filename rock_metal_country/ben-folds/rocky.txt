We were in a park
and I could jump so far.
Seems that all I'd ever done,
is smoking pot out in the car.
And this fear faded in,
.......in my old school.

He says
"Ben, we both know you're a saint,
I've been running through these fields
it's such a lovely place you drink,
is it your imagination,
it's been years since I've been on my feet?"

Now it's Rocky's day,
and it's on it's way.
Sun won't be coming out today.
Now it's Rocky's day,
and it's time he went away.
Sun won't be coming out today.

Now I recall,
but I don't know who,
told me Rocky was a runner,
won a medal back in school.
Now at Christmas Momma says,
you go up in Rocky's room.
And as we watch the sun go down,
he thanks me for my dreams.
He says "I know you think you are,
but you're not completely free.
The man who's seen the spectre of....
is completely free."

Now it's Rocky's day,
and it's on it's way.
Sun won't be coming out today.
Now it's Rocky's day,
and it's on it's way.
Sun won't be coming out today.

Then he smiled,
and he turned and walked away.
He said over his shoulder,
"I'll be gone when you're awake."

Now it's Rocky's day,
and it's on it's way.
Sun won't be coming out today.
Now it's Rocky's day,
and it's on it's way.
Sun won't be coming out today.
