we're rolling
1, 2, 1 2
sorry, 1 2 3 4

Oh no
Your love just leaves you bruised
If you want to know
You find something to lose

The world won't turn until something breaks
Who will make the first last mistake
You say good things come to those who
Wait

Into the spiral
Your world and my world
It's never final
Love just leaves you bruised

I went because you said you'd be there
A box of candy
Smoke in your hair
And I didn't know
I didn't care
But now I know
Ba ba ba ba baaaaaa
Ba ba ba ba baaaaaa
Ba ba ba ba baaaaaa
Ba ba ba ba
Love just leaves you bruised

Oh no
Did love just leave you screwed
You got to go slow
Cause love just leaves you bruised

Into the spiral
Your world and my world
It's never final
Love just leaves you bruised

I went because you said you'd be there
A box of candy
Smoke in your hair
When I didn't know
I didn't care
But now I know
Ba ba ba ba baaaaaa
Ba ba ba ba baaaaaa
Now I know
Ba ba ba ba baaaaaa
Ba ba ba ba
Love just leaves you bruised

And i've
Got the scars to prove it

I went because you said you were there
A box of candy
Smoke in your hair
Explain it to me
Again and again
Like I care
Ba ba ba ba baaaaa
Ba ba ba ba baaaaa
Like I care
Ba ba ba ba baaaaa
Ba ba ba ba baaaaa
Love just leaves you yeah

The world won't turn until something breaks
Who will make the first last mistake
Good things come to those who wait
Well I can't wait

I went because you said you'd be there
A box of candy
Smoke in your hair
I didn't know
I didn't care
Now I know

Ba ba ba ba baaaaaa [repeat]

extened version
Thats alright
How did that sound?

It was fucking great!
