Won't you smile, you look so shocked, 
Put the name-tag on your smock. 
We've come to see ya
Eddie Walker

And we may pack a little tight
The girl up-front says it's alright. 
And look there's more of us still getting off the bus
We wish you'd come back home with us. 

Eddie Walker this is your life

This one's you when you were small
And you're learning how to walk. 
They pick you up and you keep falling down. 

There you are with Aunt Louise
You're bouncing on her knees
Remember all those trees behind the garden 
They're gone
They all got cut down when she died

Eddie Walker this is your life
You never had a son or a wife
You sure had a hell of a time

Eddie Walker this is your life

This one's you and Mary Jo
Well she couldn't come, she's says hello
No, Eddie Walker, she doesn't hate your guts
It's just the whole thing shook her up
How they picked you up and you kept falling down

Eddie Walker, this is your life

Eddie Walker this is your life
You never had a son or a wife
You never had a reason to cry

This whole stack, and all of these
For your semester overseas
We're gonna leave ya, Eddie Walker
