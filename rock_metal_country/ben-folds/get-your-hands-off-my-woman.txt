You are drunk and surly
In Latino lover mode
We all know what's on your agenda
You've broken the code

Oh, I've got no right to lay claim to her frame
She's not my possession

Get your hands off my woman motherfucker
Get your hands off my woman motherfucker

Octoped, you've got six hands too many
And you can't keep them to yourself
You're too fat and too old to marry
So they left you on the shelf

Oh, I've got no right to lay claim to her frame
But you soiled my obsession

Get your hands off my woman motherfucker
Get your hands off my woman motherfucker
Get your hands off my woman motherfucker
Get your hands off my woman motherfucker
Ow!
Get your hands off my woman motherfucker
Get your hands off my woman motherfucker

Get your hands
Get your hands
Get your hands
Get your hands
Motherfucker
Get your hands
Get your hands
Get your hands
Get your hands
Motherfucker
