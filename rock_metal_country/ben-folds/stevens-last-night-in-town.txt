Everyone gather round now
sing him a song
just in case by tomorrow
it happens he's gone
For two weeks and seven days
Our fair foreign friend
I have this feeling
We might never see Steven again
We thought he was gone
But he's come back again
Last week it was funny
Not the jokes wearing thin
everyone knows now
That every night now
Will be Steven's last night 
in town

He's charmed everyone here
Except for Tamara Easter
Who later revealed to him
Her innermost secrets
Won us over with stories
About Linda McCarthey
Lost points with the ladies
For saying he couldn't love a
woman with cellulite

We were talking bout something
seems like was funny
Then Steven got quiet
I think Steven was mad
Maybe he wasn't mad
But we felt really strange for a moment
then the moment was gone
and forgotten
