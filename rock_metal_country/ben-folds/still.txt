I must give the impression
That I have the answers for everything
You were so disappointed
To see me unravel so easily
It's only change
It's only everything I know
It's only change, and I'm only changing
Lada lada ladadadadada lada ladadadadadada
Lada lada ladadadadada lada ladadadadadada

You want something that's constant
And I only wanted to be me
But watch even the stars above
Things that seem still are still changing

Lada lada ladadadadada lada ladadadadadada
Lada lada ladadadadada lada ladadadadadada
Lada lada ladadadadada lada ladadadadadada
Lada lada ladadadadada lada ladadadadadada
