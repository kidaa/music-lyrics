Lucretia walks into a room.
Because she does it's not the same room
The one she wanted to be in
She says, "Everywhere I go, damn! There I am."
And I just want to walk away
Won't you let me walk away sometimes
Won't you let me walk away

Every one of you is fired

I'm just an ordinary guy
And all I want is to be loved - is that so wrong
Don't think that I don't know what you're saying about me
I hear it all through these thin walls
And I just want to walk away
Won't you let me walk away this time
I just want to walk away

Every one of you is fired
Every one of you is oh oh oh oh
Every one of you is fired, yeah!

Ooh!

I just want to walk away
Won't you let me walk away this time
'Cause I just want to walk away

Every one of you is fired
Every one of you is oh oh oh oh
Every one of you is fired
Every one of you is oh oh oh oh
Fired 

MOTHERF*CKER!
