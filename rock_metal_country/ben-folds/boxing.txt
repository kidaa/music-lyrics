Howard, the strangest thing
Has happened lately when I take a good swing
And all my dreams they pivot and slip
I drop my fists and they're back 
Laughing Howard

My intention's become not to lose what I've won 
Ambition has given way to desperation and I 
Lost the fight for my eyes 

Boxing's been good to me, Howard 
Now I'm told, you're growing old 
The whole time we knew 
In a couple of years I'd be through 
Has boxing been good to you 

Howard, now I confess, I'm scared and lonely and tired 
They seem to think I'm made of clay 
Another day, I'm not cut out for this 
I just know what to say, I say 

Boxing's been good to me, Howard 
Now I'm told, you're growing old 
The whole time we knew 
In a couple of years I'd be through 
Has boxing been good to you 

Well sometimes I punch myself as hard as I can 
Yelling  quot;nobody cares quot; hoping someone will tell me how 
Wrong I am 

Boxing's been good to me, Howard 
Now I'm told, you're growing old 
The whole time we knew 
In a couple of years I'd be through 
Has boxing been good to you 

Has boxing been good 
Has boxing been good to you
