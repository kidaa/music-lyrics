I met this girl, she looked like Axl Rose 
Got drunk and took her home and we slept in our clothes 
And in the morning put my feet on the floor and I thought 
Being awake never felt like this before 

And Julianne y'know she wouldn't approve 
Talked only on the phone 'cause I had nothing to do 
Got rid of Axl by the afternoon 
Being awake never felt so clear and

Blue, that's all I knew 
Guess that I was innocent too 
I sing a song, yeah, and it won't be the blues 

Cos I don't miss Julianne 

My friend she told me she felt sorry for me
She said the truth would come crashing down on me
That I'd be sorry but the truth of it is
That I feel guilty for not giving a shit 

Yahoo, that's all I knew 
Guess that I was innocent too
I sing a song, yeh, and it won't be the blues
I don't miss Julianne

I got my bag of trash, I got my bag of trash 
I drag it up and down, I drag it up and down the road 

How could she miss a man 
Who drags a bag of trash down the road 

This week I feel like I been born again 
I know that Julianne, she would have a fit 
She'd find a reason for the things that I did 
She gave me credit for the things that I've never been

Ohhh, that's what I do, guess I'm inoccent too
I can try hard as I can, but I don't miss Julianne
I can try hard as I can, but I don't miss Julianne
