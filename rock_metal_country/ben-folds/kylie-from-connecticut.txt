It's just a thought, but where did it come from 
What does she do with it if it comes back 
A note from his assistant is there by the telephone 
She wonders again as she turns out the lights 

Kylie is calling from Connecticut 
She says you've got the number 
It says Kylie is calling from Connecticut 
It's back on her mind as she closes her eyes 

She believes there are things you shouldn't know about 
When you've been married for thirty-five years 
And her heart belongs to a man that she hadn't seen 
Since a magical night when the children were small 

Kylie is calling from Connecticut 
She says you've got the number 
It says Kylie is calling from Connecticut 
It's back on her mind as she closes her eyes 

Kylie is calling from Connecticut 
It's probably nothing, yeah nothing at all 
Kylie is calling from Connecticut 
It's back on her mind as she's reading old letters 
That she left in the closet with the pictures she cherished 
She never told a soul for the last thirty years 
Now she closes her eyes
