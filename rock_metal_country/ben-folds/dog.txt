Well my dog wears a path on the same line
And lately i'm thinking i might take his advice
Yeah yeah

Cause he sees through the fence and he thinks i'm free
Well, my brain and his chain look the same to me

All alone with a cage and a headrest
There's a thing I could get off of my chest
Cause I
Want to wear the path that's true
And I
Want to wear the path with you

Out on the cold off the leash four years or more
I don't even know what it was I was waiting for

Well maybe I barked up the wrong tree
That was then, now i'm back
Won't you see me?

Cause I
Want to wear the path that's true
And I
Want to wear the path with you

Oh it's true

I used to be afraid of growing old
And hanging around the same old place
But I got older anyway
So won't you
So won't you
So won't you brush my fears away

My dog wears a path and that's a good sign
Cause my dog wears a path on the same line
same line
All alone in this cage with a headrest
There's a thing I should get off my off chest
I could get off of my chest
Buy a house, go to work in the same car
Feed the dog, put our teeth in the same jar

Want to tell you that I
Want to wear the path that's true
And I
Want to wear the path with you
And I
Want to wear the path that's true

you there?
yeah
what'cha doing?
you didn't even say hello
hello
haha, that's not normal way to answer your phone
