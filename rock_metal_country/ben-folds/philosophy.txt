Won't you look up at the skyline
At the mortar, block, and glass
And check out the reflections in my eyes
You see they always used to be there
Even when this was all was grass
And I sang and danced about a high-rise
And you were laughing at my helmet hat
Laughing at my torch

Go ahead you can laugh all you want 
But I got my philosophy, keeps my feet on the ground
And I trust it like the ground 
And that's why my philosophy
Keeps me walking when I'm falling down
I see that there is evil and I know that there is good 
Yet the in-betweens I never understood 
Won't you look at me I'm crazy 
But I get the job done 
Yeah, I'm crazy but I get the job done 
And I say...
Go ahead you can laugh all you want 
But I got my philosophy, keeps my feet on the ground
And I trust it like the ground
And that's why my philosophy
Keeps me walking when I'm falling down
I pushed you cause I loved you guys
I did not realize you weren't having fun
And I dragged you up the stairs
And I told you to fly 
You were flapping your arms 
When you started to cry, you were too high, too high

You take this all for granted 
You take the mortar, block, and glass 
And you forget the speech that moved the stone 
But it's really not that you can't see
The forest from the trees
You never been out in the woods alone
So you can laugh all you want to
I've got my philosophy, keeps my feet on the ground
And I love you you're my friend 
But you got no philosophy 
And now it's time for the song to end
