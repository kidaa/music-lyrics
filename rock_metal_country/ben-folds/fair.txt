He shouted out his last word
And he stumbled through 
the yard
And she shattered her last 
china plate
And spun off in the car
When he lunged onto the hood 
She stopped to tell him she'd
been wrong
HE was thrown head over heels
Into the traffic coming on
But then
All is fair in love

Did you get my other letters
Sometimes I think I oughta call
Cause you know I often
Wonder if you open them at all
Every couple nights or so 
You know you pop into my
dreams
I just can't get rid of you 
Like you got rid of me
Ohh but I send my best
Cause God knows you've seen
my worst
But then all is fair in love
All this breathing in never
breathing out
I guess she made her way
Through the mob too late to
hear him say

That he'd gotten all he'd
wanted
A crowd to watch him bear the pain
He'd been keeping in
so what
All is fair in love
