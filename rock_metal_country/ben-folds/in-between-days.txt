Yesterday I got so old I felt like I could die
Yesterday I got so old it made me want to cry

So go on
Just walk away
Go on, go on
Your choice is made
Go on, go on
Disapear
Go on, go on
Away from here

And I know it was wrong
When I said it was true
That it couldn't be me and be her
In between
Without you
Without you

Yesterday I got so scared I shivered like a child
Yesterday away from you, it froze me deep inside

Well
Come back, come back
No other way
Come back, come back
I'm back today
Come back, come back
We'll can't you see
Come back, come back
Come back to me

And I know it wrong
When I said it was true
That it couldn't be me and be her
In between
Without you
Without you

Go on
Go on
Go on
Go on

Without you

Go on

Without you
Go on
