Another guilty white boy, won't you turn me in?
Always had it easy, charge me for my sins

Ain't been through the slavery, ain't been through the cotton fields
Through the back of a ....., cos I'm guilty

Ain't been through the slavery, ain't been through the cotton fields
Through the back of a ....., cos I'm guilty

Broken bones and bruises, Daddy brought the ball this far
But living on his shoulders, he passed it with his car

I've been through the little league, a 9 years old in the social arena
Oh baby gonna be an appeal, cos I'm guilty

I've been through the little league, a 9 years old in the social arena
Oh baby gonna be an appeal, cos I'm guilty

Always had it easy my future's in the mail
Every reason to succeed, every chance to fail
Ain't got nothing on nobody, .......
When I found that opportunity, .........
........ World War II, ........ Vietnam
I spent my life ........ .my pals
And now I'm guilty

Ain't been through the slavery, ain't been through the cotton fields
Through the back of a ....., cos I'm guilty

I've been through the little league, a 9 years old in the social arena
Oh baby gonna be an appeal, cos I'm guilty

You wonder why we fall on top of everyone
You wonder why we're no fun
Cos we're guilty
