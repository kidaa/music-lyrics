i thought about sitting on the floor in second grade
i couldn't keep the pace
i thought i was the only one moving in slow motion
while the other kids knew something i did not
but if i acted like a clown
i thought it'd get me through, it did
but that don't work no more
you're not a kid no more
i thought i'd do some travelling
never did

regrets, regrets

i thought about the hours wasted
watching t.v., drinking beer
i thought about the things i thought about
until immobilized with fear
and all the great ideas i had
and how we just made fun
of those who had the guts to try and fail
and then i ended up in jail

regrets, regrets

... but just for a day
seems the police had made a computer mistake
said there must be thousands like me with the same name
anyway, i thought about the things i settled for or never tried
i never visited my grandma even once
when she was sick before she died
so i don't blame you if you never come to see me here again

regrets, regrets...
