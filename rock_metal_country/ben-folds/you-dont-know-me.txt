I wanna ask you - 
Do you ever sit and wonder, 
It's so strange 
That we could be together for 
So long, and never know, never care 
What goes on in the other one's head? 

Things I've felt but I've never said 
You said things that I never said 
So I'll say something that I should have said long ago: 

You don't know me 
You don't know me at all 
You don't know me 
You don't know me at all at all 

You could have just propped me up on the table like a mannequin 
Or a cardboard stand-up and paint me paint me 
Any face that you wanted me 
To be seen. 
We're 
Damned by the existential moment where 
We saw the couple in the coma and 
It was we were the cliche, 
But we carried on anyway. 

So, sure, I could just close my eyes. 
Yeah, sure, trace and memorize, 
But can you go back once you know 

You don't know me 
You don't know me at all 
You don't know me 
You don't know me at all at all 

You don't know me 
You don't know me at all 
You don't know me 
You don't know me 

If I'm the person that you think I am Ah ah ahh 
Clueless chump you seem to think I am Ah ah ahhh 
So easily led astray, 
An errant dog who occasionally escapes and needs a shorter leash, then 
Why the fuck would you want me back?! 

Maybe it's because 

You don't know me at all 

Ahhh ah 
Ahhh ah 

You don't know me, 
you don't know me. 

Ahhh ah 
Ahhh ah 

So, what I'm trying to say is 
What What? 
I'm trying to tell you 
It's not gonna come out like I wanna say it cause I know you'll only change it. 
Say it. 

You don't know me 
You don't know me at all 
You don't know me 
You don't know me at all at all 

You don't know me 
You don't know me at all 
You don't know me 
You don't know me at all at all 

What? 

Mmmm, ohh oh 
Ah ah ah ah ah 
Aha ah ah ah 
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
Aha ah 
Ah ah 
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah 
Oh-oh-oh-oh oh ohh
