Now are you ready to rock
Now brace yourself
Brace your fat asses for some gut wrenching metal

It's time for the ultimate sacrifice
The final hour is approaching
The ultimate sacrifice
The ultimate sacrifice

Oh God

Here I sit broken hearted
Came to shit, but only farted

The ultimate sacrifice
Metal, heavy-metal
It's too late to crawl
It's too late, it's too late
No supper for you

The final hour approaching
The ultimate sacrifice
