Stop the bus 
I wanna be lonely 
When seconds pass slowly 
And years go flying by 
You gotta stop the bus 
We get off here 

Enough's enough
And I'm leaving this factory 
All she wants is food on the table 
And I won't be able to bring it home 

And all I want, come on, 
Is all I need, yeh is free 
'Cos I'm a factory 

Did Mother Nature tell you 
Boy you come and go as you please 
That's what she said to me 
But big brother got the keys 
And I got Jackson Cannery 

Millionaires and mill rats live side by side here
Messed up my brother's mind 
He's far from earth 
Tell me what's he worth

The same as you 
The same as me 
In this factory 

Did Mother Nature tell you 
Boy you come and go as you please 
That's what she said to me 
But big brother got the keys 
And I got Jackson Cannery 

It's four in the morning 
Mother don't know 
That I'm going far away 
She's whispering to the moon 
I hope he don't join you soon 

Baby boss 
Climbs up from his soapbox 
Great Caesar's ghost 
Knows what's best for me 
He says stop the bus 

Did Mother Nature tell you 
Boy you come and go as you please 
That's what she said to me 
Big brother got the keys 
And I got Jackson Cannery 
Big brother got the keys 
And I got Jackson Cannery 
Big brother got the keys 
And I got Jackson Cannery
