goodnight, goodnight sweet baby
the world has more for you
than it seems
goodnight, goodnight
let the moonlight take the lid off your dreams

we took a small flight
in the middle of the night
from one tiny place to another
and my parents they remained
at the shack with lorraine
and my aunt and my grandpa and brother
we walked past the tarmac
and boarded the craft
the rain had me chilled to the bones
just the three of us took flight that night,
uncle richard, me and james earl jones

and the pilot he gave me a blanket
while the tall dark man sang to me in deep rich tones...

goodnight, goodnight sweet baby
the world has more for you
than it seems
goodnight, goodnight
let the moonlight take the lid off your dreams
