Uh-Oh! 

Hey Dr. Yin 
Chain Smoking Chinese centenarian 
Deck my back with Pins 
Connect the Wires that Plug me in 

Uh-Oh! 

Hey love Master Z 
Sexy Online Pyschic Overseas 
When My Bank Card Clears 
Tell Me things I want to Hear 

Yea, Yea 

Well I might Be Dyin' 
Or Maybe I got to much time 
I can't stop my mind 
It's runnin' right 
with these false teeth 
and these plastic knees 
Go Squeak Squeak Squeak 
From the Porch to the street 

Hey Hey Hey Hey 
Hey Hey Hey Hey 

Hey Dr. Jack 
Bend me like a pretzel Till I crack 
All my joints and Bones 
Beat me up and send me home 

Hey 
I've got to much time 
Baby may I might be dyin' 
Got to help me Fallin' Doctor 
Got to Help me Fallin' 

Hey Dr Yang
