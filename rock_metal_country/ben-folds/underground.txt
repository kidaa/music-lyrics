I was never cool in school
I'm sure you don't remember me

And now it's been ten years
I'm still wonderin' who to be
And I'd love to mix in circles
Cliques, and social coteries - that's me
Hand me my nose ring
Can we be happy
Show me the mosh pit
Can we be happy 

We can be happy underground

Who's got the looks, who's got the brains 
Who's got everything 
Now I got this pain in my heart, that's all
Hey you with the long and lonely face
There's got to be something else
Let me tell ya something else
There was a girl who passed me by
She gave a smile but I was shy
And I looked down, so down
Don't look down no no, go go underground

And now there's a place to go
It's the morning now, it's the evening
It's everything
I click my heels and I'm there

Underground, underground
Everything's happy underground
You been kicked around 
Did life bring you down here 

Everything's heavy underground

And we'll be decked in all black and 
Slamming the pit fantastic 
Officer Friendly's little boy's got a mohawk 
And he knows just where we're coming from 
It's industrial, work it underground 
Get down, get down, get down 

Underground, underground 
Everything's happy underground 
You been kicked around 
Did life bring you down here 

Everything's heavy underground

We can be happy, we can be happy
We can be happy underground

We can, we can, we can be

Everythings happy

You been kicked around 
Did life bring you down here 
Everything's happy underground

We can, we can, we can be
Everything
We can, we can, we can be
Everything is
We can, we can, we can be
Underground
We can, we can, we can be
