September '75 I was 47 
inches high
Mom said someday I would have
A badass mother G.I. Joe
for your little minds to blow
I still got beat up after class

Now I'm big and important
one angry dwarf
and 200 solemn face
are you
If you want to see me
check your papers and your T.V.
Look who's tellin' who what to do
Kiss ass my ass good-bye

Don't give me that bullshit
you know who I am
I'm your nightmare little man
Vic you stole my lunch money.
made me cry.
Jane remember second grade
Said you couldn't stand my face
Rather than kiss me you said
you'd rather die

You'll be sorry one day
Yes you will, yes you will
You shouldn't push me around
Cause I will, yes I will
You will be sorry when I'm big
Yes you will be sorry
