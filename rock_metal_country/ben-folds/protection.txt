Tourists wear their wallets in odd places when abroad,
so as not to be ripped off and ways to ..........
Lawyers write some goofy terms in letters to the future,
so as not to be all screwed by........

So will I.

And I guess I will protect myself from you.
Sometimes I get so tickled I just can't talk.
I will protect myself from you.
I'll keep on reminding me,
I'm always free,
I'm always free to walk.

You're not exactly what I'm looking for,
You don't even know that when I've got it straight,
now keep it in mind,
No you're not what I was looking for.
I just need a little more of what you've got.
A little bit dumb, make me laugh.

And I guess I will protect myself from you.
Sometimes I get so tickled I just can't talk.
I will protect myself from you.
I'll keep on reminding me,
I'm always free,
I'm always free to walk.

.......................different country anyway.

Whatever happens between you and me today,
probably will be OK,
but it won't bother me anyway.

And I guess I will protect myself from you.
Sometimes I get so tickled I just can't talk.
I will protect myself from you.
I'll keep on reminding me,
I'm always free,
I'm always free to walk.

Always free.
Free to walk.
You can't hurt me 'cos I don't care about you.
I don't give a shit about you.
