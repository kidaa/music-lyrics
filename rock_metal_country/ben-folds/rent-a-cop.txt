I'm 'trolling food court for girls
Yeah, it's the best job in the world
They know they're safe with me
They love my little mustache
They love a man in uniform
Oh

With my sunglass they can't
See what I'm really looking at
And as they're walking by
I whisper through my doughnut
Hey baby, baby light that ass on fire

How long must this day go on?
I got to stand here two more hours till I
Punch the clock
How long must this day go on?

No kid, they don't give me a gun
I don't get paid enough to run
So you can call me what you want
I'll be hanging at the check out
Checking out your girlfriend
Figure out how she's going to fit all of that
Butt into that underwear - yeah
Yeah

Hey girl if you can't recall
Where you parked your daddy's car
Then I could help you out
All alone in this
Great big mall
Oh

How long must this day go on?
I got to stand here two more hours
Till it's Miller Time
How long must this day go on?
Whoa oh oh, oh oh

I'm 'trolling food court for girls

I whisper through my doughnut
I whisper through my doughnut
I whisper through my doughnut
Hey baby baby, hey baby baby baby
Light that
Light that ass on fire

Alright, that's good
