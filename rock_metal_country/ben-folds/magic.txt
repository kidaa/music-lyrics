from the back of your big brown eyes
i knew you'd be gone as soon as you could
and i hoped you would
we could see that you weren't yourself
and the lines on your face did tell
it's just as well
you'd never be yourself again

saw you last night
dance by the light of the moon
stars in your eyes
free from the life that you knew

you're the magic that holds the sky up from the ground
you're the breath that blows these cool winds 'round
trading places with an angel now
saw you last night
dance by the light of the moon
stars in your eyes
free from the life that you knew
saw you last night
stars in your eyes
smiled in my room
