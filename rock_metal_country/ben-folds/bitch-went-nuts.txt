The answer you seek my son only poses more questions. 
Ask many women why relationship has failed. 
Each woman offer unique reason for demise. 
One woman may say, "man could not commit." 
Or, "man is douche, and is now free to make love to himself instead." 
Another woman may say, "man had changed," 
or even, "man no longer satisfactory lover." 
But my son, ask many men same question all over the world, "why has relationship failed?"
Each man, each time, will give same, simple answer 

The bitch went nuts. 
She stabbed my basketball. 
And the speakers to my stereo. 
She called me 'cunt' 
But nothing prepared me for 
what I found when I came home. 
Oh and I made my own bed. I lie in it. 
You lie in yours. You lie, you lie, in yours. 
But they want more, they're at my door with torches.
Please leave me alone, you know.
Just shut it. Just shut it. Just shut it. 

The bitch went nuts. 
She photoshopped my face 
onto every boy who'd done her wrong. 
And as she burned I telepathically into the brains of all her embittered rooms. 
Oh, now, now they want more. They're at my door with torches.
Scores, and scores, and scores to settle with themselves. 
You would have thought I'd scorned them all. 
They've got a doll of me, they're burnin', they're burnin', they're burnin', they're burnin', they're burnin' their own memories. 

Why do they all go? 
Why do they all go? 

The bitch went nuts, y'all. 
But everyone said she might. 
Holy fucking shit. 
Seriously now. 
Now they want more. They're at my door with torches. 
Scores and scores. 
You would have thought I'd scorned them all. 
They've got a doll of me, they're burnin'. 

Why do they all go?
