Pangs of silence
From the room upstairs
How's the view there
Do you read what they're saying about you
That you're no fun
Since the war was won
In fact, you have become all of the things you've always run away from

Textbook hippie man

Being poor was not such a drag in hindsight
And you wonder why your father was so resigned
Now you don't wonder any more

The ascent of Stan

Textbook hippie man
Get rest while you can

Stan: Once you wanted revolution
Stan: Now you're the institution
Stan: How's it feel to be the man
It's no fun to be the man

And now, watch it all go down
