If there's a God, he is laughing at us 
and our football team. 

Effington could be a wonderful effing place 
I can see it from the highway and I'm wondering 
Are they effing in their yards? 
Effing in their cars? 
Effing in the trailers in the back roads and the parking lots 
of Effington? Making my way to Normal, Illinois. 

Maybe I should ditch this little white rental on the interstate, 
start a new effing life in Effington. 
I could change my name, grow a beard, start a family 
or I could just keep on moving on, moving on, moving on, moving on.... 
and not stop 'til I get to Normal. 

I want to live in Effington. 
I want to die there too. 
Please bury me in Effington 
in Effington, in Effington, oh 

I've got this movie in my mind of Effington 
and the soundtrack to it sounds like this da da da da da da 

I want to live in Effington. 
I want to die there too. 
Please bury me in Effington 
in Effington, in Effington, oh 

If there's a God he is laughing at us 
and our football team. 

And then the people who live in Normal 
can buy the movies that I'll make in Effington 
that's what Normal people do 
Do Normal people do it too? 
Normal people do it, people do it, people do it.... 

I want to live in Effington. 
I want to die there too. 
Please bury me in Effington 
In Effington, in Effington, in Effington, in Effington, in Effington!
