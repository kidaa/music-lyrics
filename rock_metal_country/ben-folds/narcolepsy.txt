i should warn you
i go to sleep
i know you don't
know what i mean
yet
i get upset or happy
i go to sleep
nothing hurts when
i go to sleep
but i'm not tired
i'm not tired

i know it seems that i don't care
but something in me does i swear
i don't remember all last year
i left you awake to cry the tears
while i was dreaming in streams
flowing between the shores
of joy and sadness
i'm drowning
save me
wake me up

i should warn you
i go to sleep
you won't know when i go to sleep
because i'm not tired
i'm not tired
i just sleep
