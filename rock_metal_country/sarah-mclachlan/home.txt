Child walks down to the river's edge
And looks out as far as she can see
And draws each breath as if it were the last
And wipes away the tears across her sleeve
She can see where the river crawls to the sea
Like a baby into mother's care
Somehow the longing is so far away
The innocence so wasted and aware
And look at the child with the dream in her eyes
Holding it deep inside her
Thinking about Home... Home...
So much anger so deeply ingrained
Seemed a burden that was hers alone
She didn't think that there was anything wrong
With wanting a life that she could call her own
How could I explain You would not want to hear
You wouldn't listen if I talked anyway
For you were too weighed down by your own fears
And look at the child with the dream in her eyes
Holding it deep inside her
Home... home... home... home...
