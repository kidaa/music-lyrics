The lake is frozen over
The trees are white with snow
and all around reminders of you
are everywhere i go
oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo
It's late and morning's in no hurry
but sleep won't set me free
I lie awake and try to recall
how your body felt beside me
when silecne gets to hard to handle
and the night too long,
and this is how i see you
in the snow on Christmas morning
Love an happiness surround you
as you throw your arms up to the sky
i keep this moment by and by
oh how i miss you now
my love
merry christmas, merry christmas, merry christmas, my love.
Sense the joy fills the air
and i daydream and i stare
Up at the tree and i see
your star up there,
And this is how i see you
in the snow on christmas morning
love an happiness surround you
as you throw your arms up to the sky
I keep this moment by and by.
