When somebody loved me
everything was beautiful
every hour we spent together
lives within my heart

And when she was sad
I was there to dry her tears
and when she was happy so was I
when she loved me

Through the summer and the fall
we had each other that was all
just she and I together
like it was meant to be
and when she was lonely
I was there to comfort her
and I knew that she loved me

So the years went by
I stayed the same
but she began to drift away
I was left alone
still I waited for the day
when she'd say
I will always love you

Lonely and forgotten
never thought she'd look my way
and she smiled at me
and held me
just like she used to do
like she loved me
when she loved me

When somebody loved me
everything was beautiful
every hour we spent together
lives within my heart

When she loved me...
