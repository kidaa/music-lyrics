[Chorus]
Into the valleys
The shadow of death
Grieves silently across the darkened sea
This is it
We stand alone

We can see it all from here
The starless night across the mountain side
No one left to talk to
There's nothing left to say

[Chorus]

You and me
We stand alone
We can see it all from here
Stretched far and wide

The barren skies
Fighting a silence
From deep inside

[Chorus]

[Repeats verse 2]

Into the valleys
The shadow of death
Grieves silently it's in you and me
It's in you and me
