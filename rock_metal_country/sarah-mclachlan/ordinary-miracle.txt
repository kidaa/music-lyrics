It's not that unusual
When everything is beautiful
It's just another
Ordinairy miracle today

The sky knows when it's time to snow
Don't need to teach a seed to grow
It's just another
Ordinairy miracle today

Life is like a gift, they say
Wrapped up for you everyday
Open up, and find a way
To give some of your own

Isn't remarkable?
Like everytime a raindrop falls
It's just another
Ordinairy miracle today

The birds in winter have their fling
And always make it back by spring
It's just another
Ordinairy miracle today

When you wake up everyday
Please don't throw your dreams away 
Hold them close to your heart
'Cause we are all a part

Of the ordinairy miracle

Ordinairy miracle

Do you want to see a miracle

It seems so exceptional
That things just turn out after all
It's just another
Ordinairy miracle today

The sun comes out and shines some bright
And disappears again at night
It's just another
Ordinairy miracle today

It's just another
Ordinairy miracle today
