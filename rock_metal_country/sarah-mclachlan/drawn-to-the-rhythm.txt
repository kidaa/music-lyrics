When we wore a heart of stone, we wandered to the sea
Hoping to find some comfort there, yearning to feel free
And we were mesmerized by the lull of the night
And the smells that filled the air
And we layed us down on sandy ground. It was cold, but we didn't care

[Chorus]
Yes, we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn into the rhythm of the sea
Yes, we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn into the rhythm of the sea

We fell asleep and began to dream when something broke the night
Memories stirred inside of us - the struggle and the fight
And we could feel the heat of a thousand voices
Telling us which way to go
And we cried out "Is there no escape from the words that plague me so"

And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn into the rhythm of the sea
Yes, we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn into the rhythm of the sea

In the still and the silent dawn another day is born
Washed up by the tireless waves, the body bent and torn
In the face of the blinding sun, you wake only to find
That heaven is a stranger place than what I've left behind

And we are drawn to the rhythm
Drawn into the rhythm of the sea
Yes, we are drawn to the rhythm
Drawn into the rhythm of the sea

And we are drawn to the rhythm
Drawn into the rhythm of the sea
Yes, we are drawn to the rhythm
Drawn into the rhythm of the sea
