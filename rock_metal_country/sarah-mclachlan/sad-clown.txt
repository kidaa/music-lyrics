A time so haunting moonlight in the mist
Lay me down Beside you oh as long as it lasts
From the river comes a Figure drifting slowly by
Trailing long the water, leaving softer than a sigh
Softer than a sigh
All the feelings they remain like a still life
A dying swan song forever lost your cries of glory
The rain is falling down like silence in a shroud
When All that really matters left to lose
I'm all alone
I'm all alone
All the feelings they remain like a still life
A dying swan song forever lost your cries of glory
Walking from the shadows, a fear of sadness grows
Your heart is in your hand your knowing looks
Our Time is gone
My time is gone
Swan's dying song...
