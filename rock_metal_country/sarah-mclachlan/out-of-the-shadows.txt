Crouching down inside a deep ravine
Those angry cries pass quickly by, he can't be seen
So many ways spent hiding in so many undone plans
Forgetting what it's like to fight when no one understands
Close call there in the shadows
There's a fear in the dark
There's one out there
All those memories, pain and anger, flood back one by one
They must be just around the bend, they always come
At night as I lay sleeping they come to me in herds
Their lies remain, the dreams the same, it's only fleeting words
No one calls there in the shadows
There's no end to the dark
But there's one out there, no one but me....
The hours pass so slowly, the life's slipping out of me
No way's the right way. Is there a way out for me
My life's slipping out...
Rising up, the night is done, and now the bright lights come
Held back in my pitied world where everything's undone
A cold wind blows right through me, I'm made a hollow shell
There's nothing left, just ash remains, enrich the soil, no soil, no soil...
Close call there in the shadows
There's an end to the dark
'Cause there's someone out there
Someone like me...
The hours pass so slowly, the life's slipping out of me
No way's the right way, is there a way out for me
The hours pass so slowly
The life's slipping out of me
Is there a way out for me
The hours pass so slowly
The life's slipping out of me
Is there a way out for me
There must be a way out for me...
