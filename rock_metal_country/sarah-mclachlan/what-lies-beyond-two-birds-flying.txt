All of my life I've had a longing for knowledge
And all which lets my thoughts be free
Duties for which I'm destined seem to haunt me
Confusing all I really want to need

And i see you again and I know its true
The dreams that have left me call out once again
Together we'll find the strengths to make love real
Because I wanted to do what I know is true
My thoughts lead me on I only see one way
The way to what lies beyond us now

No I see you again and i know its true
My dreams that have left me call out once again
Together we'll find the strengths to make love real
Because I wanted to do what I know is true
My thoughts lead me on I only see one way
The way to what lies beyond
I will follow my heart
