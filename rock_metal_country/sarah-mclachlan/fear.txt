Morning smiles
like the face of a newborn child,
innocent, unknowing.

Winter's end
promises of a long lost friend.
Speaks to me of comfort

But I fear
I have nothing to give.
I have so much to loose here in this lonely place.
Tangled up in your embrace
There's there's nothing I'd like better than to fall.
But I fear I have nothing to give.

Wind in time
Rapes the flower trembling on the vine
And nothing yields to shelter it from above.
The say temptation will destroy our love.
The never ending hunger

But I fear
I have nothing to give
I have so much to loose here in this lonely place
Tangled up in our embrace
Theres nothing I'd like better than to fall
But I fear I have nothing to give.
I have so much to loose.
I have nothing to give.
We have so much to lose...
