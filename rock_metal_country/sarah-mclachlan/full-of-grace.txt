The winter here's cold and bitter,
it's chilled us to the bone.
We haven't seen the sun for weeks,
too long, too far from home.
I feel just like I'm sinking,
and I claw for solid ground.
I'm pulled down by the undertow,
I never thought I could feel so low,
and, oh, darkness, I feel like letting go.

If all of the strength and all of the courage
come and lift me from this place.
I know I can love you much better than this:
Full of grace, Full of grace, my love.

It's better this way,
I said,
Haven't seen this place before.
Where everything we say and do,
hurts us all the more.
It's just that we stayed too long
in the same old sickly scheme,
and I'm pulled down by the undertow,
I never thought I could feel so low,
and, oh, darkness, I feel like letting go.

If all of the strength and all of the courage
come and lift me from this place
I know I can love you much better than this:
Full of grace, full of grace.

I know I can love you much better than this.

It's better this way.
