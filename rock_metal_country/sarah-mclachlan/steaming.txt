You're always waiting on the tide
It's time you decide
I've walked down long roads that seem to have no end at all
You never wanted time to end
To let my life offend
It's time to realize what hides deep inside your holy eyes
Hold on tight, hold on fast
This ain't the kind that always lasts
If you want me to go just ask me to go, I'll go
All the way my love, over the hills and right on through you
Run away my love, over the hills and right on through you
Over the hills and right on through you
Lying awake in these restless dreams
Life's never what it seems
I've always tried to read your eyes
To get inside that scornful mind
Hold on tight, hold on fast
This ain't the kind that always lasts
If you want me to go just ask me to go, I'll go
All the way my love, over the hills and right on through you
Run away my love, over the hills and right on through you
Over the hills and right on through you
I was with you on that pallet steaming
Spinning 'round in circles dreaming
I was with you on that pallet steaming
Running 'round in circles screaming...
All the way my love, over the hills and right on through you...
Run away my love, over the hills and right on through
All the way my love, over the hills and right on through you...
Run away my love, over the hills and right on through
