Your love in all it's finery 
Tear up the darkness all around me 
Until I can breathe again 
Until I believe again 

Cause I'm a train wreck 
Waiting to happen 
Waiting for someone to come pick me up off the tracks 
A wild fire born of frustration 
Born of a world, oh, that gets me so high 
I've no fear at all 

But your eyes like midnight fireflies 
Light up the trenches where my heart lies 
Until I can see again 
Find my way back again 

Cause I'm a train wreck 
Waiting to happen 
Waiting for someone to come pick me up off the tracks 
A wild fire born of frustration 
born of the one love that gets me so high

I've no fear at all 
To fall so deep into you 
Loose myself completely 
In your sweet embrace 
All my pain's erased 

From your mouth, it's all that I wish 
Mercy of your lips, just one kiss 
Until I can breathe again 
Until I can sing again 

Cause I'm a train wreck 
Waiting to happen 
Waiting for someone to come pick me up off the tracks 
A wild fire born of frustration 
born of the one love that gets me so high

I've no fear at all 
To fall so deep into you 
Loose myself completely 
In your sweet embrace 
All my pain's erased
