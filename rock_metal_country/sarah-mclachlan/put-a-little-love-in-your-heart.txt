Lilith Fair 1999 group closing song

Think of your fellow man
lend him a helping hand
put a little love in your heart

You see, it's getting late
oh please don't hesitate
put a little love in your heart

And the world will be a better place
and the world will be a better place
for you and me, you just wait and see

Another day goes by
still the children cry
put a little love in your heart

If you want the world to know
we won't let hate grow
put a little love in your heart

And the world will be a better place...

Take a good look around
and if you're looking down
put a little love in your heart

I hope when you decide
kindness will be your guide
put a little love in your heart

And the world will be a better place...

Put a little love in your heart each and every day...
