Somewhere deep inside me
I hold a picture of a time long gone
A time of ease and simple pleasures
And days in shadows not so long
Now with my mind I'm struggling
Holding on to what I believe
Listen to the fragments of my thoughts
That leave me broken and deceived
'Cause I don't know the way
He said "I can take you there,
I can show you places where our time has had no ware"
And as we walked the plains
The skies they opened wide
Revealing all the shame for what's been lost inside us all

[CHORUS]

It's a day in the life
In my mind I've seen it all
Sometime soon for all to see
The walls are slowly breaking down
In my mind I've seen it all
And someday we'll be free
We're searching for a message
Or so I thought but so it seems
The ignorance in the myths of others
Is easier to redeem
I've never questioned the answers given
To find the faith that's been lost within
'Cause where I lay my trust in others
Where it lies the ground is thin
'Cause I don't know the way
He said "I can take you there,
I can show you places where our time has had no ware"
And as we walked the plains
The skies they opened wide
Revealing all the shame for what's been lost inside us all

[CHORUS]
[CHORUS]

I know you say you love me
If what you say is true
So show me something that's not deceiving
'Cause I wouldn't lie to you

[CHORUS]
