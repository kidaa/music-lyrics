The next big thing
Life can be so calm
The next big thing
So calm without you
I am waiting for the next big thing
Bring it on quick time to me
I tap my fingers to the same old thing
And dream of better things to see
I couldn't tell you what path it comes by
I couldn't tell you if it's plain to see
I couldn't tell you if it's gonna change the world
But I hope to Hell it's gona chagne me
I am waiting fo rthe next big thing
I'm scared of all that's behind me
All my faith is in the next big thing
It's where I'll hide what you don't see
I couldn't tell you what clothes it wears
I couldn't tell yo if it's black or white
I couldn't tell you if it's gonna change the world
But any change at all would be alright
Round and round the world we go
Back and forth in time
Always looking for the new sensation
Bigger and better every time
So calm without you, without you, without you, without you
