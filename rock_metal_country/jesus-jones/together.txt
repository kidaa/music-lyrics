When the sun's this bright
I have to blind myself with the light
I have to get too close
To the things that hurt me the most
When I'm pushed and pulled without ever knowning...
Why does it seem
I'm falling apart
Just tell me where to start
Show me how we'll be
Together, together
If you fail at so much
Would it hurt to fail again?
And if you've lost your touch
It's time to feel once again
When you're pushed and pulled without ever knowing why
I know
That you're going to save me in the end, in the end
I know
That you're going to save me in the end
So tell me why does it seem
I'm falling apart
Just tell me where to start
Show me how we'll be...
