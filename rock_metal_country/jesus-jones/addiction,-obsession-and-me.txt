It's addiction, it's obsession, it's a need to be me
It's addiction, it's obsession, so I can feel that I'm free
Born in a time that sanctions all desire
I fight my insticts all the way
Drawn to a strom of things I have to have
With patience like other virtues still in the way
I get enough of things to need them more
Like love and destruction to name but two
It's getting harder telling good from bad
With you senses asking was it good for you
It's addiction, it's obsession, it's a need to be me
There's so much I feel I have to have
