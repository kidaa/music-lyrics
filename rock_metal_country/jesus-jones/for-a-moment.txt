Free for a moment, high above
Just for a moment I am in the arms of love
If I could be all that I want to be
The greats of ths world would hang their heads in despair
If you could hear what I want you to hear
You'd think you couldn't breathe without that sound
And there's always something more that I should tell you
More lost that I am found
So I'm trying to clear my head so I'll be 
If I could say all that I want to say
I'd hide in shame for years when I was done
But there's always something more that I should tell you
More lost than I am found
So I'm trying to clear my head so I'll be
And there' sthe rub in being human
It get in the way of all your dreaming
