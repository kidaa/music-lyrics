Well I don't know about you
But there's not alot that I want to do
I could get a job in a bank...
...No I don't think so
But I've seen the ad I want the car
And all the things that make life just fine, don't they?
If you can have it, I can have it
All that's yours can surely be mine
And it's one for the money
To keep up with the Jones'
So you can look around and see you're not alone
Money wasn't meant for the poor
And it's truer now than ever before
You either have it or you don't 
So where do you fit?
It's never never when you need it
Always always when you don't but that's life
And I really wouldn't care if I could only have a share of the good life
And it's one for the money...
All in all, you know it's too easy
