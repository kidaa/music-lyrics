In my life there's a right time and a right place
There is order
There is method well, you know where
There is routine, nothing spare
Catch the light in a different way
And all the bullshit falls away and I
Stare, into a heart of darkness
There is no good, no evil, only me
There is no love, not anymore
I don't think there ever was
As for me, I feel no hate
I may believe in luck
But not in fate
Stare, into a heart of darkness
There is no good, no evil, only me
Stare, into a heart of darkness
There is no good, no evil, only me
On the wall there is a red light
When I close my eyes
I see spirals.
