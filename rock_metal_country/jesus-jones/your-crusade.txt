Include me out
You dig your own grave
You build your own walls
I don't believe enough to believe in you
Oh no, not me, I'm not part of your crusade
Don't need your approval
Your safety in numbers
You stay in your team
I don't care enough to share your dream
Oh no, not me, I'm not part of your crusade
I don't need someone like you
Expecting me to share your views
'Cos I don't expect that what you see has anything to do with me
Oh no, not me, I'm not part of your crusade
