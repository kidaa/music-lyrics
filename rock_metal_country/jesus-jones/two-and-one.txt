everyone's giving a piece of their mind
the deaf, the dumb, the stupid and blind
crushing the words to the people who doubt
with the weight of the hard of the fast
COMING OUT
days that seem clear to me are the days
that you're near to me
everything is fine
and you know the sun will always shine
two and two always equals four
and life is simple when you're sure
the world's on someone else's shoulders
leave it there 'til it gets colder
two and two always equals four
did you never hope for something more?
black and white and wrong and right
real and real and how do you feel?
the louder you shout the better you're heard
the meek shall inherit the earth--THAT'S UBSURD!
the bigger they come, the harder they fall
'til you're big enough you don't fall at all
help, save, change me
you can rearrange me
but never let me say i know
for certain
everything is fine
and you know the sun will always shine
two and two always equals four
and life is simple when you're sure
the world's on someone else's shoulders
leave it there 'til it gets colder
two and two always equals four
did you never hope for something more?
