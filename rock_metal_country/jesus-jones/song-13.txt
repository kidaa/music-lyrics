Never met you, but how I love you so
Never met you, and yet you take up all my time, you know
So say hello to the whole in my world
So say hello to the desperation girl
She's my, She's my, She's my desperation girl
Too much time I have spent alone
And in that time the seeds of something bad were sown
What's going on with the state of my mind
When I look in, it's always her that I find
She's my...
These are desperate signs of desperate times
And desperate times breed desperate minds
