Oh we had some magic and used it all
There's a tinge of regret but not what you'd call real sorrow
Didn't think much, if at all
Whatever the cost we'll pay it all tomorrow
But I'd rather be damned than let you go
And I'd rather be damned 'cos I know
You've gotta get a good thing when you see it
We let our lives slip, just for a while
It took all we had but it made you smile too
And I'd rather be damned than let you go
And I'd rather be damned 'cos I know
You've gotta get a good thing when you see it 
But I'd rather be damned than let you go
And I'd rather be damned 'cos I know
You've gotta get a good thing when you see it
