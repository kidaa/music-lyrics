Compromise and confusion steal us away
When they say ignorance is bliss
It makes it sound too good to miss
How about that?
And the problem with success is you become what you detest
How about that?
So who to believe and who do you trust
Well, it might as well be you
'Cos it seem that no-one else has got a clue
Get it wrong get it right
You can try as hard as you like
But there's no such thing in the world as the right decision
Compromise and confusion steal us away
Now it's okay for you to smoke
Just as long as it's not dope
How about that?
Two wrongs don't make a right
But there's a Gulf where they just might
How about that?
Suspended by trust
Reserved my belief
And did all I could do
In the hope that I might pick up any clues
Get it wrong get it right
You can try as hard as you like
But there's no such thing in the world as the right decision
Compromise and confusion steal us away
When to serve and protect
Means we may just break your neck
How about that?
For every question why
There's an answer on the sly
That few will look in the eye
Get it wrong get it right
You can try as hard as you like
But there's no such thing in the world as the right decision
Compromise and confusion steal us away
