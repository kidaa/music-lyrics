are you satisfied?
do you know what you want?
will it go with you when you die?
oh, the things i could do for you
if you want me to
if you want me to you've lost the point,
start again
all the things you want from me
don't come easily
if i give them away they're worth even less
than they are now
are you satisfied?
do you know what you want?
will it go with you when you die?
when the time's gone by
will you ask why
there was so much left
to try?
how do you do these things?
i don't see any strings
when you pull me in and everything is
all i want from you
here before my eyes
you have set the prize
but as soon as i touch
it always turns to dust
oh, how do you do it?
oh, how do you do it?
all the things i could do for you i could do for you
if you want me to if you want me to
all the things you want from me
don't come easily
are you satisfied?
do you know what you want?
will it go with you when you die?
when the time's gone by
will you ask why
there was so much left
to try?
oh, how do you do it?
how? how do you do it?
oh, how do you do it?
oh, how do you do it?
