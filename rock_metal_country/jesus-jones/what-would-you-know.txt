Now mostly you don't like me
And mostly that's okay
The mouth that launched a thousand words
Has nothing much to say
To say to me
You've been there, seen it, done it all
There no surprise for you
I know you think I waste your time
But I have news for you
Here's news for you
What would you know?
But maybe I should thank you
For all your kind advice
And now I'll return the favor
Don't try to be so nice
Don't waste my time
What would you know?
Your point of view is worthless
'Cause you don't understand
There are so few things worse than 
The cynic's hired hand
what would you know?
