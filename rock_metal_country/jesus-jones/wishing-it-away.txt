Live fast die young, the words of a fool it seems
Hell bent getting there, seeing nothing on the way
Where are you now, when all eyes would be on you
Dumbstruck, disappeared, leaving everything to do
You were wishing it away
Sail up the stream travel so far
But always get out of the boat
Sail up the stream travel far
But always leave the boat
Here in my hands; all that I could wish for
Timebomed, stick around see it all go up in smoke
With these very hands, I'll pull it all apart
I know in the end it'll sound like some sad joke
'Cos I'll be wishing it away
Wishing it away
Wishing it away
Nothing is sacred, not life nor hapiness
Least of all is the world that we live in unless we make it pay
We're wishing it away
