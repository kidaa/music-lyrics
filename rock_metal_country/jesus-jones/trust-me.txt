trust me... i know what i'm doing!
from day one i got things wrong
one day i'll get things right MAYBE
i never thought i knew the answers
while the whole world thinks they might
big headed, wrong-headed
anything under the sun
i'm really no-one
trust me
trust me
trust me
you were pushed away you were lead astray
you were dragged up the garden path
i made damn sure that i never EVER
did things by half
trust me
trust me
trust me
... i know what i'm doing!
trust me
trust me
trust me
trust me
trust me
trust me
trust me
trust me
trust me
trust me
trust me... i know what i'm doing!
