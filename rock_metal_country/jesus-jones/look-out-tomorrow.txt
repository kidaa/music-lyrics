It's OK, it's OK, it's OK
Stand back look out tomorrow
Here comes a man without sorrow
I guess it's OK if today's unlike the rest
And it's OK that I'm not quite at my best
But if you're looking at me to set your mind at ease
Well then there's no way, let's just give it all a rest
I know you and all you're thinking
You know me, you know I'm sinking
Stand back look out tomorrow
Here comes a man without sorrow
Good thing looks are deceiving
Quick smile then I should be leaving
And so it's OK that I shouldn't say a word
And it's OK that what I think is never heard
But I'm looking at you to help me understand why it is OK
That I hide behind these words
I know you and all you're thinking
You know me, you know I'm sinking
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK
But it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK,
