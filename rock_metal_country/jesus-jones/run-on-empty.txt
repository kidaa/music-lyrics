Don't look up too quick
You'll see the sky is falling down on you
And when you run on empty
The ground will wait to swallow you
I have a dream returning every night
The goal is out of reach but still in sight
I'm getting thin but grinning every day
I run on empty too much, it's just my way
And in all your dreams doesn't it seem
That you're wearing lead boots, growing tree routes, caught in quicksand?
I can see ahead the end of the line
This is some kind of meltdown just in time
I see declining empires fade away
The games were getting ugly anyway
