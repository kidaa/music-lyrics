I played with the fire
Stared at the light, screamed at the pain
Pushed to the centre
Took no advice, waited in vain
I questioned it too
Thought about me, thought about you
The corruption between us
The power and lies, dreams come true
I don't know if I care
I can't feel, I can't speak, I can't think
Caught in an idiot stare
I won't let it go
Hold it to me, it's mine to the end
A shadow that hugs me
My black dog, my enemy friend
I don't know if I care
I can't feel, I can't speak, I can't think
Caught in an idiot stare
