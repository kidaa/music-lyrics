can't feel my head, my heart
everything aches and i can't cure it
imagine being afraid to think
sink into to the ground, endure it
i'm mad enough to kill and thrilled
i'm moved enough to cry
too much, too much
let all in
don't let it all pass you by
STRIPPED
STRIPPED, aoh
STRIPPED, oh
everyone is hungry
everyone needs to know
at the end of it all you've got to get what you want
or you'll have nothing else to show
STRIPPED, oh

everyone is hungry

at the end of it all you've got to get what you want---STRIPPED, oh
