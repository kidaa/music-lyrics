Here it comes! Here it comes! Here it comes! Here it Comes!
It's adrenalin for me
That is waiting patiently
For when push comes to shove which it usually does for me
No time here to explain
All the many ways to gain
The sneak-up-behind, jump start your mind for free
And here it comes!
It's a little bit sad
But isn't it fun?
To spend a life chasing chemical #1
Isn't it fun?
The romantics out there say
That emotions aren't this way
But whatever the name, it feels the same to me
And here it comes!
Isn't it fun?
