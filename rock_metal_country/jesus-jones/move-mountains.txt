Mary hangs from the rearview mirror
On the dash her son's come off worse
We've got a carload of faith here 
And we're saved from the world by some verse
Nothing I can do or say
Will ever move people this way
I want it, if it moves mountains
I want it, move mountains for me
You can twist and turn and bend it
'Til its the cruellest shape in the world
But i still want it
The last free thing in the world
