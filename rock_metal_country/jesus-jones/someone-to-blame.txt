Understand that we don't dislike you
Nothing ever goes quite as planned
Well you know that these things happen
So we just know you'll understand
But it's not you fault
We just need someone to blame
You really needn't take it so hard
You know how quickly people forget
We've heard it said that you're no bad loser
So we just know that you'll have no regrets
But it's not your fault
We just need someone to blame
