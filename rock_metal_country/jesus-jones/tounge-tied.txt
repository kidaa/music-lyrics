I'm trapped in words
Held hostage by my friends
Tripped up by meaning
Taking a road just to get to it's end
Tounge tied
It's killing me
I want to see things for the first time
Show you things that are brighter, darker, sharper, softer
But I'm struck dumb and dead
Thoughts like paper over fire
There's a hole in my world
That makes me talk like a liar
Over there I see a fist fight
A woman in a care full of toys smokes a cigarette
Conversations twist and turn
I get the feeling I am learning more than ever before
This is the first time
Tounge tied
It's killing me
