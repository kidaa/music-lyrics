welcome back victoria
since you've gone you know that no-one's really missed you
welcome back victoria
and now your friends watch over everything
that we-ee do
welcome back victoria
so the pendulum swings back
welcome back victoria
you went away, OK
we got a little slack
and once again you'll cover up
what you don't understand
don't close your eyes
you can't hide behind your hands
welcome back victoria
we'll be no threat when we're deaf, dumb and blind
welcome back victoria
clean books, clean screens, clean words,
dirty minds
i am a child of the sixties
and for that i must pay
you wag your finger all you like
i'll tell you something, it's my children
they'll have no choice but to   say
welcome back victoria
i trust your piano legs are covered up again
welcome back victoria
double standards are you forte, now as then
welcome back victoria
we'll tip our tophats   to those who walk the streets, and you know what i mean, now
welcome back victoria
on commercial street  be careful who you meet, but you're alright, jack
welcome back, welcome back, yeah
welcome back, welcome back, eehee hee
