Reason you look for are reasons you find
For climbing a mountain, for taking a gamble, 
to leave it all behind
Motion takes me
I have to have motion, I get release in motion
If I move I'll be fine
I've got to hit the right speed to shake off what I don't need
Be free from my mind
Reasons you look for are reasons you find
I have to have motion, I get release in motion
If I move I'll be fine
