You came at the right time, filled the right space
And ever since then I've seen your true face
You and me, what do we know of each other?
You're a cartoon, the butt of bad jokes
Every picture of you seems out of focus
You're evil personified come to avenge
Our perfect enemy out for revenge
You and me, what do we know of each other?

I, I, I don't believe it
I don't believe it
I, I, I don't believe it
There's nothing here that seems to fit
There no doubt what you did was wrong
You'll get an excuse in this song
But an eye for an eye makes no sense to me
The state of us now is this how it'll always be?
You and me, what do we know of each other?
I, I, I don't believe it
I don't believe it
I, I, I don't believe it
There's nothing here that seems to fit
Who does it serve
To believe every word you heard
To hear without listening
Look without seeing
You came at the right time, filled the right space
And ever since then I've seen your true face
You and me, what do we know of each other?
I, I, I don't believe it
I don't believe it
I, I, I don't believe it
There's nothing here that seems to fit
