I don't mind if I never ever meet you
I love you just the way you seem
And I don't mind all the things they say about you
Jealous words won't spoil this dream
The real world, it comes to get you
I believe in the unknown
So I'm sure you won't disappoint me
These home truths fall on deaf ears
So I know you won't disappoint me
SMile, smile, smile, while the glory days are here
Where's the hurry, worry all next year
And don't mind me 'cause I'm really only looking
It may seem strange, but that's all I want to do
I believe in the unknown...
The real world it comes to get you
There is no way it will forget you
I don't mind if I never ever meet you
I love you just the way you seem
I believe in the unknown...
