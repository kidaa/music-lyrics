if the sun shines today
i think i'll stay here anyway
and if the world makes demands of me
then i'll wait and see
it's at times like these
i do what i please do what i please
and i'm pleased to say
it's like i've always wanted to feel this way
blissed, blissed
when i'm going somewhere, going nowhere
blissed, blissed
when i'm going nowhere, going somewhere
no-one ever else could feel like this
i couldn't settle for less than this
let the feel the air wash over me
let the ground sink beneath my feet
and i expect so much more from today
than just a time between tomorrow and yesterday
blissed, blissed
when i'm going nowhere, going somewhere
blissed, blissed
when i'm going somewhere, going nowhere
there'll be a time when all my dreams come to and end
when i'll run out of postcards for you all to send
but i'll keep with me
all the things i feel and see
blissed, blissed
when i'm going somewhere, going nowhere
blissed, blissed
when i'm going nowhere, going somewhere
