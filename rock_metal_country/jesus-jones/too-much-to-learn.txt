Why don't you let someone be rude to you
Kick you around and say that there is 
Nothing wrong with you that a good kick in the pants wouldn't cure
Haven't you heard that they're all too scared
Yes they're all too scared so no one says there's
Nothing wrong with you that a little bit of truth wouldn't cure
shoot my mouth off
Too much to learn
Don't you know there is 
So much to learn
Don't you know you have
When he's nodding his head it means yes or no
But you'll never know which until you find there's 
Nothing wrong with you that a quick walk down the street wouldn't cure
Shoot my mouth off
Too much to learn...
Didn't you know how much it cost
That the price you pay is when we say there's 
Nothing wrong with you that a jump in the lake wouldn't cure
Too much to learn...
