There was this kid in our neighborhood.
His Pop had named him Renegade.
He lived up to his name
with all the trouble that he made.

One day ol' Renegade Snuck into the Park Theater downtown
For a laugh he set fire to the screen,
burnt the whole damn place to the ground.

He thought that no one would mind,
He did that sort of thing all the time.
But his Pop was waitin' for him.

At age fifteen Renegade,
stole a tow truck from Arnie's Shell
Drove it through the front of a hardware store.
Spent the night in a county jail.

He didn't seem to mind a bit.
He liked the attention he would get.
