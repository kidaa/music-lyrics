Bodacious am a whole lotta' bull over nineteen hundred pounds. He's born in Galry, Oklahoma and he's the baddest sonsabitch around if a Burma bull ever were a super star then Bodacious just might be. He's a cream colored, beefy brawn, full-fledged, four footed bovine celebrity. 

Who's gonna ride Bodacious? Who's gonna tame him down? Look out for Bodacious, he's bound to hold his ground. Here comes Bodacious, ya'll just step aside. Big and bad Bodacious takes a toll from those who ride. 

Young Bo met a man named Tuff Hedeman at the start of his buckin' spree and Tuff became one of the few to make the whistle bkac in Nineteen Ninety Three. 

Tuff tried to ride Bo again at the finals in Nineteen Ninety Five. Bodacious had got a little older and wiser Tuff barely came out alive.
