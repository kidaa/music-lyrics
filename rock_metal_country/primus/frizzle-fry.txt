Hello all you boys and girls.
I'd like to take you to the inside world.
It's quite an irregular place to be.
But never fear you're safe with me.
Well, maybe.
Golden hair of macrame'
Against the face that's cut from stone.
The white porcelain is screaming Ayee
Thank God the the boy is not alone.
I don't believe in Santa Claus.
I don't belive in spite.
I have no use for beauty dolls.
Especially on this night.
I don't believe in miracles.
I don't belive in lies.
I don't belive in hologram
For I am the Frizzle Fry.
Andy's painting green again,
This time they might take him away.
When Barrington starts to breathe again.
It way just take us all away.
I don't believe in charity.
I don't believe in sin.
And if you don't believe in me,
We'll play this tune over again.
I don't believe in pinochle
And I don't beleive I'll try.
I do believe in Captain Crunch
For I am the Frizzle Fry.
