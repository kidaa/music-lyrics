You can have a lolly pop 
a candy bar a jelly bean.
I'll buy you a rainbow 
to hang above your door.
It's pudding time.
Laughter is a sweet
You can't put a price on.
When laughter's all gone
Daddy won't buy you more.
It's pudding time.
It's pudding time children.
Money money money
To buy you things.
Daddy's gonna buy you a 
diamond ring.

Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall
All the kings horses and all the kings men
Couldn't put Humpty together again.San Francisco bay the
Striped bass are dying.
But you're gonna get 
That brand new bike
Oh joy
It's pudding time
It's pudding time children.
