There's a time for lies and a time for truth.
I say, eye for an eye, eye for a tooth.

When I roamed young, I'd scavenge around.
Every nook and cranny of our little town.
It's nice, so nice, to be.

Pull out the cannon boys, steal us some wine.
Puff Tijuana Smalls. Shake hands with beef!

She's so fine, she's so sweet.
Mom and Pop they raised her on huge slabs of meat.

She's fine, a man of nine, Water derby day.
Twenty six pumps on a Crossman, and it's time to play 
It's nice, so nice, to be 

Pull out the cannon boys, steal us some wine 
Puff Tijuana Smalls. Shake hands with beef!
