Part I - Blinded by the Sun 

Bring me back again, I'd really rather not be out here on my own. Someone reel me in, I'm drifting ever farther from my home. 

I remember when I was a baby gazing in amazement at the sky. Sing it twinkle twinkle little baby daddy's gonna learn you to fly... 

high... 

like a coment through the sky. 

Bring me back again, I'd really rather not be out here on my own. I'm drifting with the wind, trying to hold the course that I've been shown. 

I remember when I was a baby staring in amazement at the sun. Better shield your eyes now little baby no one ever said you were the one; no one ever said you were the one who can't be blinded by the sun. I think I'm blinded by the sun. 

Part II - Sanity is Coming to Town 

I like to taunt, I like to tease. I'll bring your psyche to its knees. Juggling. Sanity is coming to your town. 

Who gives a damn what you say, you're pissing all your dreams away. Juggling. Sanity is coming to your town. 

Part III - Pressing Onward Towards the Light 

Pressing onward through the night. Pressing onward towards the light.
