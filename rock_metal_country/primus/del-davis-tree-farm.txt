Del Davis sold a Christmas tree
Stood up to 8 feet tall
Season was lookin' mighty thin
He'd hoped to sell 'em all
  Here he comes with a dollar in his hand
  Represents the epitomized man

The boy liked rock 'n' roll
Seemed that's the way he paid his way
  With the help of Del and them ";Doogs";
  There's a bit more joy this holiday
Here he comes...
