The Earth it did crack open on the day that I was born and a thousand merry pranksters came dancin' through the storm. 

I lay cradle bound a howlin' out my mind not knowin' years to come I'd be shoutin' over din 

I sucked information through the holes in my skull as my belly gurgles hungry my mouth is always full. 

I am Antipop; I'll run against the grain till the day I drop. I am the Antipop; the man you cannot stop. 

As a young man, I plug into the tube, but the stench of all that pretense I cannot muddle through. 

I lay on my back and scan the radio all that comes out my speakers is a steady syrup flow. 

I suck information through the holes in my skull as my belly gurgles hungry my mouth is always full. 

I stood by watching and I seen 'em come and go. I seen 'em make that million then vanish in the snow. 

They come upon you like a pack of rabid hounds as they slobber in your ears and purge you with their sounds. 

Pushing misinformation through the holes in my skull my belly gurgles nauseous and still my mouth is full. 

I am Antipop; I'll run against the grain till the day I drop. I am the Antipop; the man you cannot stop.
