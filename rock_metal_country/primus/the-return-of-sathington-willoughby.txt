Fellow colleges, distinguished members of the press, ladies
and gentlemen:

I would like to take this opportunity to personally and humbly thank
each and every one of you for joining us at this particular event.

It is my hope that we can utilize this meeting of the minds to
successfully convey the essence of our platform to you, a grand and
noble audience.

As I look out among the faces, I reflect, taking console in the words
of Franklin Delano Roosevelt who said, ";We have nothing to fear but
fear itself.";

Paranoia is a disease unto itself, and may I add, the person standing
next to you, may not be who they appear to be, so take precaution.

A mind is a terrible thing to waste, this is true any a young person
has fallen prey, to the substances that alter the perspective Of any
right thinking individual.

The Problem with the youth today is, because of their inexperience
with the world, they cannot attempt to grasp the ideals, set forth by
myself and those who preceded me.

But, as history has shown, they will come around, and embrace our
philosophies and become model citizens in their own right, God bless
this great nation.
