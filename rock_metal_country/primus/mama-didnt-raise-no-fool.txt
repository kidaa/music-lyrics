The best of times, the worst of times, the times you can't ignore. Sometimes you bite the bullet and flip flop on the floor. 

They tell you where to go, and they tell you what to do. They set your face on fire then stomp it out with their shoes. 

I ain't no fool. Mama didn't raise no fool. 

The times I can't complain are the times I do the most. On a diet of black coffee and prozac buttered toast. 

These eunuchs in their prada and Gucci flavored clothes. Wouldn't know a fresh perspective if it bit 'em up on the nose. 

I ain't no fool. Mama didn't raise no fool. 

Don't do as they say, just say as they do. No flavor's quite so bitter as the taste of one's own shoe. 

I ain't no fool. Mama didn't raise no fool.
