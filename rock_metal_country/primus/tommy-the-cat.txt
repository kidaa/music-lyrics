";I remember as it were a meal ago";

Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter
may have nestled its way into his mighty throat.  Many a fat alley rat
had met its demise while staring point blank down the cavernous barrel
of this awesome prowling machine.  Truly a wonder of nature this urban
predator.  Tommy the cat had many a story to tell, but it was a rare
occasion such as this that he did.

";She came slidin' down the alleyway like butter drippin' off a hot
biscuit.  The aroma, the mean scent, was enough to arouse suspicion in
even the oldest of Tigers that hung around the hot spot in those
days.  The sight was beyond belief.  Many a head snapped for double,
even triple, takes as this vivacious feline made her her way into the
delta of the alleyway where the most virile of the young tabbys were
known to hang out.  They hung in droves.  Such a multitude of
masculinity could only be found in one place... and that was
O'malley's Alley.  The air was thick with cat calls no pun intended
but not even a muscle in her neck did twitch as she sauntered up into
the heart of the alley.  She knew what she wanted.  She was lookin'
for that stud bull, the he cat.  And that was me.  Tommy the Cat is my
name and I say unto thee...

Say baby do you wanna lay down by me";
