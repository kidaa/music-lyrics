You're strong, you're stubborn now
In an endless symbolic war
Brave or bored, either/or

Sometimes I ricochet from the past
And at times a future I've already had before
Champion or chore, either/or.

I'll write the pages you rip out
Back in their places again
One day you'll know what you're talking about
I can hardly imagine, but until then I'll be

Filling in these blanks that you create
Every time you win some petty score
Posing as hardcore, oh yeah, either/or

Look at the spin chief, battered and broken
Clutching a plastic rose
We're all in the downpour you carry around for
Trashing a lifestyle you've never known

It's a useful dream that makes
Quite an entertaining show and not much more
Up against and for, either/or
