Won't you let me walk you home from school?
Won't you let me meet you at the pool?
Maybe Friday I can
Get tickets from the dance
And I'll take you
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Won't you tell your dad get off my back?
Tell him what we said 'bout "paint it black"
Rock and roll is here to stay
Come inside now it's ok
And I'll shake you
Ooh ooh ooh

Won't you tell me what you're thinking of?
Would you be an outlaw for my love?
If it's so then let me know
If it's no then I can go
And I won't make you
Ooh ooh ooh
