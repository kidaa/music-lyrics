you'll take advantage 'til you think you're being used
cause without an enemy your anger gets confused
i got stuck on the side you know, i never chose
but it's all about taking the easy way out for you i suppose
there's no escape for you except in someone else
although you've already disappeared within yourself
the invisible man who's always changing clothes
it's all about taking the easy way out for you i suppose
well i don't want you making mistakes 
i wish you luck i really do
but the problem with the puzzle
whatever's left to you
i heard you found another audience to bore
a creative thinker who imagined you were more
a new body for you to push around and pose 
it's all about taking the easy way out for you i suppose
it's all about taking the easy way out for you i suppose
