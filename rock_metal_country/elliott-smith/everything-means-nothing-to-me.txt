someone found the future as a statue in a fountain at
attention looking backward
in a bowl of water wishes with a blue songbird on his
shoulder who keeps singing over everything
everything means nothing to me
i picked up the song and found my picture 
in the paper the reflection in the water shouted
";are you men still trying to salute 
people from a time when he was
everything he's supposed to be?";
everything means nothing to me
