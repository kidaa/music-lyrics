She's shaking down
I'm absent and numb from shock
Reaching around for the hands of the clock
Should've lied
Lit me up, it's my lie
Should've lit me up, it's my lie
Should've lit me up, it's my lie
Should've lit me up
Cupid's trick comes
Down to shake and deal
The stupid kick that makes me real
Should've lied
Lit me up, it's my lie
Should've lit me up, it's my lie
Should've lit me up, it's my lie
Should've lit me up
She's shaking down
It's never over and done.
So, kick me, cane me 
then I'll know
Why
Lit me up, it's my lie
Should've lit me up, it's my lie
Should've lit me up, it's my lie
Should've lit me up
