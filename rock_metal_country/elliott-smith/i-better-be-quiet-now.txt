wish you gave me a number
wish i could call you today,
just to hear a voice. 
i got a long way to go
getting further away.
if i didn't know the difference, 
living alone would probably be ok.
it wouldn't be lonely.
i got a long way to go
getting further away.
a lot of hours to occupy it was easy
when i didn't know you yet,
things i'd have to forget.
but i better be quiet now,
i'm tired of wasting my breath
carrying on, getting upset.
maybe i have a problem,
but thats not what i wanted to say.
i prefer to say nothing.
i got a long way to go
getting further away.
had a dream as an army man with an order
just to march in my place
but a dead enemy
screams in my face
but i better be quiet now, 
i'm tired of wasting my breath
carrying on, not over it yet.
wish i knew what you were doing.
why you want to do it this way.
so i can't go the distance,
i got a long way to go, 
i'm getting further away.
i got a long way to go
getting further away.
