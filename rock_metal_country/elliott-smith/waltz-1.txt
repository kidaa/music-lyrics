everytime the day darkens down and goes away pictures open in my head 
of me and you silent and clich all the things we did and didn't say
covered by what we did and didn't do going through every out i used to
cope to make the repetition stop:
what was i supposed to say?
now i never leave my zone we're both alone i'm going home
i wish i'd never seen your face
