I took you to the train
Stupid shit you displayed
I took pictures in my head
You an opening stare only
Had a little dressy date
Just didn't care
You were all getting drunk instead
Seen how things are hard
Seen how things are hard
I love you though
Seen how things are hard
Seen how things are hard
Well don't you know
Listening to what you thought was a dizzy height
Freaked out and forgot you stay well away from trouble that you caused
Using all your strength to keep the world at an arm's length
And not get upset because something goes wrong
Seen how things are hard
Seen how things are hard
I love you though
Seen how things are hard
Seen how things are hard
Well don't you know
I'm a crap reflection of you
I cant make corrections for you
You have to help me patch things up
Seen how things are hard
Seen how things are hard
I love you though
Seen how things are hard
Seen how things are hard
Well don't you know
Seen how things are hard
Seen how things are hard
I love you though
Seen how things are hard
Seen how things are hard
Well don't you know
No
