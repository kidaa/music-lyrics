One more little one
I'll go down, stay down
Sleep the rest of the day
Dream new music to calm down
Stay down and keep evil away
I can hear you asleep
Changing your shape
Dissolved in some dream
As a new one appears
To take you along where you've never been
One, two, three, four, five, six...
The moonlight tonight seems to belong to me
'Cos even though some can't sleep
They need some company
One hit wouldn't hurt a bit at all
Slow down sleep
What's there to fight?
If it's good shit you won't know
And I won't know the fact that I'm dying
If I seem to be reckless with myself
It's the fault of no one
All things have a place
Under the moon as well as the sun
One more little one
I love you
