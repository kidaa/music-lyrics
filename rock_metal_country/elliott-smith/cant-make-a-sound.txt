i have become a silent movie
the hero killed the clown
can't make a sound
nobody knows what he's doing
still hanging around
can't make a sound 
the slow motion moves me 
the monologue means nothing to me
bored in a role, but he can't stop
standing up to sit back down
and lose the one thing found
spinning the world like a toy top 
till there's a ghost in every town
can't make a sound
eyes locked and shining
can't you tell me what's happening?
why should you want any other, when you're a world within a world?
