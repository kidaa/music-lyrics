i'm a color reporter
but the city's been bled white
and the doctor orders drinks all night to take away this curse
but it makes me feel much worse
bled white
so i wait for the f-train
and connect through a friend of mine
to a yesterdaydream
'cos i'll have to be high to drag the sunset down
and paint this paling town
bled white
so here he comes with the blank expression
especially for me 'cos he knows i feel the same
'cos happy and sad come in quick succession
i'm never going to become what you became
don't you dare disturb me
while i'm balancing my past
'cos you can't help or hurt me
like it already has
i may not seem quite right
but i'm not fucked, no quite
bled white
bled white
