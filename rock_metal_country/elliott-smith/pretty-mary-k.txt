almost forgot
started to say
rode into the sun
asked everyone
haleluja
pretty mary k
i found faith in the infirmary
there's a soldier lying in bed 
with a wound to the head
calling out to pretty mary k
here's what you get 
for things that haven't happened yet
happened upon pretty mary k
but a soldier's uniform
waved me away
walk 'round the door
talked to st. james
though i'm already done
ask everyone
have you seen her
pretty mary k
have you seen her
