activity is killing the actor
and a cop's standing out in the road turning traffic away
there's nothing she could do until after
when his body'd been buried below
way back in the day
oh my nothing else could have been done
made his life a lie 
so he might never have to know anyone
made his life a lie, you know
I told him he shouldn't have sent her
he'd only be making it worse
bothering somebody else
but I he that he'd never forget her
while her memory worked in reverse
to keep her safe from herself
oh my nothing else could have been done
she made her life a lie
so she might never have to know anyone
made her life a lie, you know
what I used to be will pass away and then you'll see
and all I want now is happiness for you and me
what I used to be will pass away and then you'll see
and all I want now is happiness for you and me. . . .
