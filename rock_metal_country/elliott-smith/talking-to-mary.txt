Talking to Mary, you know you don't have to shout
She can hear what you're thinking like you're saying it right out loud

She sees behind that dirty look
It was her that followed down every every stupid turn you took

One day she'll go, I told you so
One day she'll go, I told you so

Saw the one big problem you keep under your hat
And its pretty unlikely that anyone else is cool with that

You got a bus fare in your pocket and more money down in your sock
But I cant tell you how to find her if you wont listen to her talk

One day she'll go, I told you so
One day she'll go, I told you so

Its no problem, I'll just keep quiet if its easier for you
To make believe in that I don't love you as much as I do

One day she'll go, I told you so
One day she'll go, I told you so
I told you so, I told you so
