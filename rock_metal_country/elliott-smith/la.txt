the gentle little elaine,
spinning his hat on a cane
stepping out, out for change
";good morning all, it's a beautiful day";
the generals are winning a war
seemed suicidal before
you came alone, now
i'll protect you, long as you stay
lllllaaaaa
one of a kind
you'll be walking in the sun
living in the day
last night i was about to throw it all away
if patience started a band,
i'd be her biggest fan
look at me, i'm talking to you
i don't want the lead in your play
the star's just a part of the scene
the gentle man in green
paying off, out on the street
i can't go home, it's not on my way
llllllaaaaaa
things are never done, car's parked in the sun
living in the day
last night i was about to throw it all away 4 times
