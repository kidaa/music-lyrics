I met a girl, a snowball in hell
She was hard and as cracked as the Liberty Bell
I got her to come on and move in with me
And I said I'd find a better place we could spend eternity
Don't go down
Don't go down
Stay with me
Baby, stay
Her mama called me a thief
And her dad called himself commander-in-chief
I fought him off with my love
But I knew the sense of worthlessness she'd have to rise above
Don't go down
Don't go down
Stay with me
Baby, stay
Don't go down
Don't go down
Stay with me
Baby, stay
She had a dream, woke up in shock
She had seen her own body outlined in chalk
I split the scene, the globe had been spun
And her ghost leaned down to kiss me with a message from the sun
Don't go down
Don't go down
Stay with me
Baby, stay
Don't go down
Stay with me 
Baby stay
Don't go down
Stay with me
Baby, stay
Stay
