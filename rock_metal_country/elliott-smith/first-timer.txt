You're a first timer, blaming everybody else
For the hard time you give yourself

In the cold riddle where you find yourself not blocked
By a door you locked

But don't get backed into a corner
Talking to yourself
Come on back to me
My pride tomorrow

You feel hollow
And you know it's because you are
Well at least so far

I think of you with hesitation
I think of you too hard
Come on back to me
But don't make me sorry

You're a first timer, blaming everybody else
For the hard time you give yourself
For the hard time you give yourself
