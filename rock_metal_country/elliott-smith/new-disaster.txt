Ghost of your smile is always looking for
New bodies to haunt
And it's been here, it is up here
He's hanging around and he'll float for a while
Gradually gone
It's pleasing and freezing

While I wonder what it is you're after
Keeping company with this disaster

You looked all over town, got turned around
To walk back through the mud
The kind you had left behind you
Everybody's the same in this long knowing game
Where every new blood gets time to become resigned

Now I wonder what it is you're after
Keeping company with this disaster
Why you never try to tame your master

You just blow through the coals
Blow through the coals
Till everyone knows
That your smile is just a ghost
The ghost of your smile was seen on a body in the park
It's old news, you see that it's no use

You're waiting to start, waiting to light
Wait until dark
I told you man
I told you

While I wonder what it is you're after
Keeping company with this disaster
Why you never try to tame your master
