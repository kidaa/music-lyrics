sung by Jim
fall to my bended knees
shoving up till i freeze
falling on down to you
down down down
so choked up in the dust
hand held holy lust
dragging me to her cross
fall fall fall
so i dragged you down
c'mon drag me down
so it seems to be
so it seems to me
that i just cant fail to see
falling on down to you
down down down
everybody's falling on me
and I'm as dead as a christmas tree
