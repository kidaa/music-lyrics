sung by Jim
Fall to her call on a Saturday night
She's got the hip dippin' trick
Of all time done right
She's got her lips sticking tight
To her find tonight
She's keeping time keeping time
With the mystery rhyme
And she's crazy to want me to taunt me
Deep on the scene she is waiting for me
Like a sin scraping skin
She is screaming for me
Hope in hope in the sky she is talking to me
She's keeping time keeping time
With the image of me
It's her way of saying a prayer for me
It's her way of talking to God for me
It's her way of talking to jesus christ
It's her way of talking to jesus
