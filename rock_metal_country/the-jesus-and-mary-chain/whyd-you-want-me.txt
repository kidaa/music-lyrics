Why'd you care why'd you want me there
Why'd you sin why did you let me in
I got no shoes I've always got the blues
I gave myself to drink and drugs and filth
Why'd you care why'd you want me there
I see the gloom and doom in every room
You see the light in every darkened night
So why'd you care why'd you want me there
Why did you sin why'd you let me in
Why'd you want me babe
Why? Why? Why? Why?
