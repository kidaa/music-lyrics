If everybody had an ocean
Across the USA
Then everybody'd be surfin'
Like Californi-a
You'd seem 'em wearing their baggies
? too
Everybody's gone surfin'
Surfin' USA
You'd catch 'em surfin' at ?
Texas County line
Take a trip to the Ocean
You can feel real fine
All over Manhattan
It's the only way
Everybody's gone surfin'
Surfin' USA
We'll all be planning that route
We're gonna take real soon
We're waxing down our surfboards
We can't wait til June
We'll all be gone for the summer
We're on safari to stay
Tell the teacher we're surfin'
Surfin' USA
Surf, baby, surf
Surf that USA
?
All the way to the USA
?
Surfin' USA
