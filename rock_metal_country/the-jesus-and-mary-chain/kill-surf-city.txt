I love baby and she loves me
I lost my baby in the deep blue sea
I'm gonna turn my trick 
Gonna blow your head
???
Til I'm almost dead
I'm gonna kill surf city with a loaded gun
Got to ? surf city like a nuclear bomb
I'm gonna fight surf city, got to get it down
I'm gonna kill kill get it down
I got to get, get, surf city
I hate honey and she hates me 
But that's the way it's supposed to be 
I'm gonna run, gonna run till I hit the sun
Some evil cunt's gonna get my gun
I'm gonna kill surf city, got to get me a gun
Got to fry surf city with a nuclear bomb
Got to get them all day 
?

I'm gonna ?
surf city
Here she comes now

Down to the back where the ? came from
I've gotta sit that mother down
Somebody knows me and I know them
Fuck fuck
