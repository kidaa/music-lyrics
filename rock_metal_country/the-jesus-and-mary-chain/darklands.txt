sung by William
i'm going to the darklands
to talk in rhyme
with my chaotic soul
as sure as life means nothing
and all things end in nothing
and heaven i think
is too close to hell
i want to move i want to go
i want to go
oh something won't let me
go to the place
where the darklands are
and i awake from dreams
to a scary world of screams
and heaven i think
is too close to hell
i want to move i want to go
i want to go
take me to the dark
oh god I get down on my knees
and i feel like i could die
by the river of disease
and i feel that i'm dying
and i'm dying
i'm down on my knees
oh i'm down
i want to go i want to stay
i want to stay
