What if I say
I couldn't take another day
Aw if I told you would you stay
And I've got you
And you've always seen me through
Aw if I told you would you stay
I can't live without you
Now you're gone
Aw is it true
Did I leave you black and blue
I didn't tell you I was real
Gone on so long
It feels so right but wrong
I couldn't tell you what I feel
I can't live without you
But I'll try
You make the comedown easy
You've been a friend
