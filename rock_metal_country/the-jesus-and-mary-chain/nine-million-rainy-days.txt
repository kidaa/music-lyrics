sung by William
nine million rainy days
have swept across my eyes
thinking of you
and this room becomes a shrine
thinking of you
and the way you are
sends the shivers to my head
you're going to fall
you're going to fall down dead
as far as i can tell
i'm being dragged from here to hell
and all my time in hell
is spent with you
i have ached for you
i have nothing left to give
for you to take
i have no more empty heart
or limbs to break
and the way you are
sends the shivers to my head
you're going to fall down dead
as far as i can see
there is nothing left of me
and all my time in hell
was spent with you
