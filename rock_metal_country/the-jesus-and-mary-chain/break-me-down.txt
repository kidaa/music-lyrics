Time to turn completely
To that something I despise
I don't need no easy piece
With that something in her eyes
Something's cracking inside
Something cracks and leaves me cold and weary
Something's cracking inside
And then I make my start and then it's running to me
And I know what it takes to break a man completely
And I know about the taste of pain
And now it's burning through me
And I know
And I see
And I know what it takes to break a man
Time to turn completely [etc]
