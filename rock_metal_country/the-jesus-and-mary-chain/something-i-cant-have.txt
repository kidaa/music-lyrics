You're in my house you're in my face
You made me hate the human race
I got it good I got it strong
I got it down where it belongs
Aw it's sick and oh it's sad
I think you're something I can't have
Penetrate the happy place you got me crawling on my face
Come fly with me come lie with me come die with me
And we could kiss with tongues
I've got no place to go you've got no place to go
Aw it's sick and oh it's sad
I think you're something I can't have
To my head you're going to my head
All the things you said
All the things you swore
Are going to my head
