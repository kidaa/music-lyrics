sung by Jim
sometimes i can fake a smile
but still the world looks down on me
twenty five years of growing old
it just hangs infront of me
i can't see or understand why
pushing up can drag me down
take my time in everything
it breaks me up if i cant sing
i cant see
i cant touch
sometimes in the summer sunshine
the sky falls down on me
always in the dead of darkdays
someone's after me
talking fast I'm walking backwards
and my head is in the trees
you can hang this heavy feeling
hanging down on me
