I'm going back to a happy place
All my life I've lived to taste
Someone else's flavours on my tongue
Cherry take me back to the start of it all
Where everyone's up then everyone falls
Almost could destroy me with her kiss
Oh, I wish that I could feel
And I feel too real
For this grey moat
And me, I'm drifting like the sun
Down on everyone, the TV sky
Save me
Come and save me
Come on touch me
Come on and touch me
Come on hold me
Come on and hold me
I live my life for something I can't see
Let me take you in my summer dream
