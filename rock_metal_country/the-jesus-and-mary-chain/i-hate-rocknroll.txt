I love rock 'n' roll
And all these people with no where to go
I love rock 'n' roll
All these people with nothing to show
I love the BBC
I love it when they're pissin' on me
And I love MTV
I love it when they're shittin' on me
I hate rock 'n' roll
And all these people with nothing to show
I hate rock 'n' roll
I hate it cause its fucks with my soul
Rock 'n' roll hates me
I hate you rock 'n' roll
I hate rock 'n' roll hates me
