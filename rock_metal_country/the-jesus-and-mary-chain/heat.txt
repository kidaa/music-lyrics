If I could live for 100 years
Still I couldn't understand my fears
Never had the time or an easy ride
Kicking up the noise of a suicide
And I see the heat coming down
Heat coming round feels like I'm coming on
Seen what I've seen and it's gone
But I don't know
But I don't know
Yeah I don't know
Tell me what you're saying
All these things I've been praying
Tell me what you're saying
All these things I've been praying
Tell me what you're saying
All these things I've been praying
Tell me what you're saying
All these things I've been praying
