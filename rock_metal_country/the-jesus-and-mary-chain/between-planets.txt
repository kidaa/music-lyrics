sung by Jim
Suicide standing sucking in her cheeks
Too much lips and too much eyes
Hasn't slept for weeks
She don't know just where it goes
Jackie T said she saw death
She's done it fifty ways
But she's been off that medicine
For almost fifteen days
She don't know just where it goes
So turn around and run back where you're from
You can't get on
Don't shake those hips don't bite those lips
Just keep it hid
Come on now you gave it away
And all the friends you had got paid
Come on now you were never that shy
And that's no way for you to say bye bye
Baby you drive me crazy
Don't come around here no more
