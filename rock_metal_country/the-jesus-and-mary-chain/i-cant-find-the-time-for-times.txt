sung by William
I love Beatle John
She loves Beatle Paul
We don't hate the rest
We can love them all
And the way I kissed has gone and messed my life
I was born again
I was born again tonight
Did I try too hard
Did I try too tough
Did I put some in
Did I get enough
I'm a boyfriend and a girlfriend in your eyes
It's a kind of sin
It's a kinder sin to lie
And did I feel you deep inside
And did I feel you deep inside
I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried
Did I feel you deep
I think I'm driving insane
Yeah they do bad drugs
And on Top Of The Pops
I could close my eyes
But the fun might stop
And all those crazy people need crazy times
I can't find the time
I can't find the time for times
And if I took you deep inside
And if I took you deep inside
I'm down and I'm down and I'm down again
I can not be seen
I think I'm driving insane
And did I feel you deep inside
And did I feel you deep inside
I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried
Did I feel you deep
I think I'm driving insane
Get it on
Bible John
Get it on
Now he's gone
All those Christian soldiers could be wrong
I was born again
I was born again tonight
I was born again
I was born again tonight
I was born again
I was born again tonight
