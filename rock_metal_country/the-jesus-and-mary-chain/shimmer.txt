The look behind your eyes
Conceals a thin disguise
If pleasure is my prize
There's pain in paradise
She makes the rivers flow
She looks into my soul
Destruction sets us free
From this forbidden tree
So I don't care
Don't say that I don't care
But you just made me aware
I don't care
Heaven's open gate the Devil's silver eyes
A look that seals my fate
Destruction is my prize
