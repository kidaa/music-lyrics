I wish that you and me would be
Inside of a rubber dream
I wish we'd walk and I wish we'd swing
Down to the sunshine thing
I got you and I want my head
I look like I come in death
I don't doubt your word
I don't doubt your word
And it had to be inside my rubber holy dream
It means, it's good.
And it seems that I should go on
Back to where I've been it seems I've gone
I wish I'd seen it all
Inside my covered hole
I think I seen my head
I think I seen my head
I wish I'd seen the time
I wish I could walk in time
I'm making sense in my own way
