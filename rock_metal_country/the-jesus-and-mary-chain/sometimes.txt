Kid's got something keeps it well hid
One of these days I'm gonna shake off the lid
Dig beneath the dirt maybe scrape beneath the skin
It's getting so bad I think I'd die to get in her
Sometimes you just can't get enough
I got the feeling that I've been here before
I'm on my knees and I'm kissing the floor
I got the feeling that I've crashed in a car
I got the feeling aw babe you're a star
And you understand
Sometimes you just can't get enough
