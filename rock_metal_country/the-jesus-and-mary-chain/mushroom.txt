When I saw, sky's were red
I was born and I was dead
When I saw her mushroom hair
I was born and I was dead
When I saw her mushroom hair
I was born and I was dead
I gotta keep my distance
I gotta keep my distance
Gotta keep my, gotta keep my
Gotta keep my
When I saw, sky's of rain
I was born and I was dead
I gotta keep my distance
I gotta keep my distance
I gotta keep my, I gotta keep my
I gotta keep my
Hey, hey, hey
etc..
