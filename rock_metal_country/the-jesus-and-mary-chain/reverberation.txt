you've finally found
your health was fine
it's strapped inside your skin
you want to leave
but you believe
you won't get back again
you only know
you have to go
this feeling you can't deny
you try and try
you die and die
you're stuck on your own now
reverberation
reverberation
you find ?
it doesn't cease
this deadly irritation
you catch a lie
you stare behind
you're sick with fermentation
you hold your thoughts
your mind is caught
your fixed with fascination
you think you'll die
but can't rely
it's back with devistation
reverberation
reverberation
?
come on
you start to swirl
the downward curl
catches up your feels
?
comes home to you
and downs inside your ?
you start to fight
against a knife
that swings inside your mind
there's something black
that bounces back
and grabs you from behind
reverberation
reverberation
