Chilled to the bone and five miles to home
I'm messing in the dark and feeling all alone
I got ice in my fire got the heat in my wire
Inject a little heat I'm burning up the tyres
Sidewalking sidewalking sidewalking sidewalking
Talking like I'm on and I'm the only one
I'm making like I'm done and staring like a gun
And I gotta get a car and I gotta get a ride
Gotta get a car got jesus on my side
Sidewalking sidewalking sidewalking sidewalking
Messing in the dark and walking all alone
Alone in the streets I know just where I'm going
Sidewalking sidewalking
Chilled to the bone Chilled to the bone
Hot wired heat all the way home
