The wind is screaming around the trees for my Psychocandy
The world is spreading a strange disease for my
Psychocandy
Candy is the baddest seed
She'll take you down and make you eat
Her fish
Her poison fish
Is on her dish
Candy cannot hear or see 
She's in the place she needs to be
She'll take the point to a sharpened blade
And give you something warm to taste
And the world is turning 'round
And on and on and on
And the world is turning 'round
And on and on and on
And the world is turning 'round
And on and on and on
And the world is turning 'round
And on and on and on
And the world is turning 'round
And on and on and on
Psychocandy
And the world is turning 'round
And on and on and on
Psychocandy
And the world is turning 'round
And on and on and on
Psychocandy
And the world is turning 'round
And on and on and on
She's my Psychocandy
And the world is turning 'round
And on and on and on
She's my Psychocandy
And the world is turning 'round
And on and on and on
Psychocandy
And the world is turning 'round
And on and on and on
Psycho
