Some kind a strange kind of feelings coming over me
I bled from the back to the front for the world to see
You gotta run
You gotta stay
Cause I'll be screaming to have had my way
I got my head in the gutter
and it looks as if it's gonna stay
I, just can't take it
I, don't you say it
I, I can't take it, oh
I, fuck me down now
I, run me down now
I, run around now, oh
I now have hit the ground
And just look at what I found
Everything is alright when you're down, hey hey
Strange as it can seem
Like livin' in a scream
Everything is alright when you're down, hey hey
Everything I say is going wrong
