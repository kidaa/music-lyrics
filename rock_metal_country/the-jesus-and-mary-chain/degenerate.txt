sung by William
I was a car smash
She was a car smash
We did the car crash
I said the police
I kiss the police
I killed the police man
My mother kill my darkend soul
My mother kill my darkend soul
My mother lit my darkend soul
I got the stone look
I done the stone truck
I got the stoned look in my eye
Disease yeah
A disease yeah
A disease yeah
My lover touch my darkened soul
My lover touch my darkened soul
My lover lit my darkened soul
And now I know just where to go
I was a whore hound
I was a snake hound
I was a coke hound
I was the bad scene
I was the bad gene
I was the bad dream
My lover touch my darkened soul
My lover touch my darkened soul
My lover lit my darkened soul
And now I know just where to go
