sung by Jim
Crazy I'm halfway to crazy
Suicide could save me
Oh is that much too extreme
It's such a sad and sorry scene
Lovers tongue tied
And tied to the tongue
Making deals going bad by the dawn
Every dog must have it's day
And then it's got to pay and pay
That's me being torn at the seams
Going mad in the middle of a dream
Catch me getting it wrong from the start
Catch me 'cause I'm falling apart
Crazy I'm halfway to crazy
Suicide would waste me
Homicide would break me
Tongue tied and tied to the tongue
Oh is life as bad as dreams
I guess that's just the way it seems
