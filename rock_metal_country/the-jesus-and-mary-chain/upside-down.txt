We're moving 'round and 'round
Can't hear a single sound
And when I hit the ground
I heard a ringing sound
Uh-huh-huh
I heard a ringing sound
And my head hit the ground
Uh-huh-huh
Inside I'm upside down
You live with so much carelessness
'Cause no one takes you serious
That makes you feel so dangerous
You wish you never was
But you can't see
And if you feel there's no one else
That you're all alone, you're by yourself
Your life is like a broken shell
It doesn't really matter to me
Doesn't matter to me
Doesn't matter to me
Knowing you can't see
Inside I feel so bad
So low I feel so sad
Feels like I'm going mad
Best friend I've ever had
Uh-huh-huh
Feels like I'm going mad
Best friend I've ever had
Uh-huh-huh
So low I feel so sad
You live with so much carelessness
'Cause no one takes you serious
And now you think you're dangerous
You never was but you can't see
And if you feel there's no one else
You're all alone and by yourself
Your life is like a broken shell
It doesn't really matter to me
Doesn't matter to me
Doesn't matter to me
Knowing you can't see
Upside down [x 10]
