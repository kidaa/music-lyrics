We've got nothing but that's alright
Nothing could be something if the feelings right
Holding onto something doesn't make it mine
Got to get to heaven but we don't have time
So come on
Bright light city set my soul on fire
Couldn't get me worried couldn't get me higher
Scream for me baby 'cause I'm going down
Got to get to heaven when the sun goes down
So come on
