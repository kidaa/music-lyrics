You must admit that,  
You look like shit  
'Cause you've been awake all week  
Sometimes it's placed that  
You call your gaskets  
Up to your accelerating deep  
You can come down  
You can come down to me 2x  
You tell us no way  
We can't see what you say  
We see it with our own eyes  
Your in so deep that you can't even sleep  
With out even me having to stack up lies  
You've been in a craze for so many days  
You can't even crack a grin  
So how can you stand there  
And tell us that you care  
While your doing your self in  
You can come down  
You can come down to me 2x  
Your spinning your wheels your  
Looking for thrills your  
Burning your bridges down  
Make no mistake  
And take some complaints  
To turn the cycle around  
You had us tricked  
Thought you had it kicked  
Your back on the horse again  
So why should it be that  
We have to see  
What your doing yourself in  
You can come down you can come down to me 2x  
Greg and Paul saying aaahhhh in the background  
Burning your bridges down  
Greg and Paul saying aaahhhh in the background  
Your spinning your wheels your  
Looking for thrills your  
Burning your bridges down  
Make no mistake  
And take some complaints  
To turn the cycle around
