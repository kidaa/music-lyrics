Dear Inez 
Your exterior is so cold 
Your story's been told 
I've heard it before 
You wanna get out 
Don't wanna be down 
Tied to the ground 
You wanna slip out 
You wanna go and have your fun 

You got a son 
You don't want none 
Don't wanna be part 
Your breaking my heart 
As he wanders off 
He ain't got none 

Dear Inez 
The kid is trouble at trouble 
He's gonna push, all around 
You wanna go and do your thing 
You never have a wedding ring 
You got something 

Why's everything so rough 
Why's everything so hard 
Why's everyone so wrong 

It's not me 
You gotta believe 
I know who you love 
I only know how to push and shove 
Give me a break 
All I have I have to take 
Never a hand out 
You think you have me figured out 
This is what I'm all about 
You wanna go and have your fun 
You never think of anyone 
Don't do nothing 

Why's everything so rough 
Why's everything so hard 
Why's everyone so wrong 
So wrong 

Dear Inez 
Your exterior is so cold 
Dear Inez there's something about you 
You wanna go and have your fun 
You got a son 
You don't want none 

I've been there trying and I don't give a damn 
I'm gonna cash my checks 
Money in my hands 
No thanks the world is okay by me 
If your gonna blame it on society
