Steve and Rosie Talking    
Steve: Yo Rosie, what time is it?    
Rosie: I do not know.    
Steve: It's Christmas time girl!    
'Music starting'    
Rosie: Why don't you go shopping,    
you only need the two chestnuts or something like that    
'Cause I'm gettin' nuttin' for Christmas    
Mommy and Daddy are mad    
I'm gettin' nuttin' for Christmas    
'Cause I ain't been nuttin' but bad    
I broke my back on Johnny's head    
Somebody snitched on m    
I hid a frog in sister's bed    
Somebody snitched on me    
I spilt ink on Mommy's rug    
I made Tommy eat a bug    
Bought some gum with a penny slug    
Somebody snitched on me    
Chorus:
I'm gettin' nuttin' for Christmas    
Mommy and Daddy are mad    
I'm gettin' nuttin' for Christmas    
'Cause I ain't been nuttin' but bad    
I put a tack on teacher's chair    
Somebody snitched on me    
I tied a knot in Suzy's hair    
Somebody snitched on me    
I did a dance on Mommy's plants    
Climbed a tree and tore my pants    
Filled the sugar bowl with ants    
Somebody snitched on me    
Chorus 2X    
We ain't gettin' nuttin for christmas    
So you better be good the whole year through    
'Cause if your not, I'm warning you    
You'll get nuttin' for christmas    
Steve and Rosie talking again    
Rosie: Nothing!    
Steve: In a weird crying type voice saying: I love you Rosie    
Rosie: Come over here you big Santa! then Rosie growls
