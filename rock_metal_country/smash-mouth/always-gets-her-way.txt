I know she likes her magazines
Of what they're wearing down in Hollywood
I know she wants green tea ice cream
Just for fun, melting in the sun
She likes her jokes as long as they're bad
And I'll laugh anyway

But I'll never really know her
She told me all I really need to know is that
She'll always get her way
She knows that she will always get away with it

She likes to take me out so I
Can watch her dance with her girlfriends
Cool boys playing pool stop and stare at the way she moves
Dancing Queen is blaring
She likes to know that she will be driving me home
Because I'm too slow

She likes the primetime TV shows
And her secret crush on David Letterman
But she could never let her friends know
She's pure punk rock at a ripe 27
I know these things
I've seen the presets on her car stereo
