A long summers day stetching out the cold
Searching for the answers and some say I'm not alone
Could you tell me where I might find fallen horses their spirits they fly
Blinded by the whiteness staring at the sun
I'm wishing that I had wings so that I could become one
Would you help me if I wanted to die I could ride off with horses tonight
Tell me why
Why oh why
I said why
Why oh why
Now that I've arrived here I know I'm not alone
All my friends among me tell me welcome home
But could you tell me where I might find the one I'm looking for cause her wings have arrived

[Repeat Chorus]
