Who is the man making a scene, fashion of green 
Living it out and living it up to his name 
Who wants some lovers gold, silver tone 
Tipping it out it has claimed to fame 

I'm a mystery man I'm doing what I can 
With a continental international plan 
So
Come on now, it's all now 
This play is here to stay 
Let me break you down, let me make you understand 
Don't you know your history 
I feel it, I mean it 
This play is here to stay 
You're a woman I'm your man, this ain't no mystery 

Who is the guy looking back, coming back 
Making it up so he goes and he knows 
That she'll come around turn up frowned outside down 
Breaking it up before it gets to world 

The keeny causes the girl some danger 
My teeny hangover 
He ain't no stranger to London, Paris, New York and Japan 
I'm bringing home the bacon in a frying pan 
?????? Chinatown 
If you're down then I'm your mystery man
