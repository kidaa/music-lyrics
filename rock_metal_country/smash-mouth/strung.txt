Chorus: 
You think it's fun you think it's fun and games  
Can't tell you 'cause you know everything  
You know right from wrong but you do it anyway  
Can't break away, can't seem to get away from you  
Get away from you, from you, get away from you  
Get away from  

Don't know where you're going  
But you know where you've been  
Time isn't kind now all the years are showing  
You don't think it's broke  
So you don't wanna fix it  
Don't have a clue  
Walk away just forget it's you  
Get away from you, from you, get away from you  
Get away from you  

Chorus 2:  
Caught in the middle  
What's right, what's real  
The grass isn't greener, on your side of the fence  
I tried of this really  
No one can see  
I'm really in for  
A miserable life  

If you can't dance  
Then you can't dance with me  
You better bring your own, I only brought enough for me  
My best friend is my own prophecy  
That's what you get when you come along with me  
Come along with me, come along with
