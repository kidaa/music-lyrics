Making faces from across the room 
Look at me looking at you 
What's your name, my name too 
I'm getting the chills sitting next to you 
Shake myself in your soul 
The blood in your veins 
The smell your clothes 
What am I suppose to do 
There's nothing left for me to choose 
Make my move or walk away 
Once again with out a date 
Is it me or do I smell 
I had a shower the other what the hell, is going on 
Just where do I belong 
I don't really care 

Get outta my hair, get outta my hair 

Smoke my cigarettes and drive my car 
Flick your ashes on my bedroom floor 
Wear my underwear, steal my shirts 
I think it's love and then you burp 
If I died you'd probably spit on my grave 
And date my friends the very next day 
Your always complaining that I'm not home 
When I try to call you on the telephone 
My pants are falling my socks don't fit 
I can't seem to walk with out having to trip over you 
Just what am I gonna do 
I don't really care 

Get outta my hair, get outta my head 

What is said, what is done 
I take it on the run 
I won't apologize 
I won't be telling lies 
How could you, why would you 
Take advantage of and leave me of my love 
Then leave 

Smash my windows and keyed my car 
And outta the blue you send a birthday card 
What's a man suppose to do 
When all I get is grieve from you 
Playing games and trashin' my 
Who could it be 
Hopefully nobody for me 
I don't really care 
Get outta my hair
