The pages of the calendar
Are flyin' off faster as I get old
And if I had a second take
I'd wanna make the same mistakes
Except for the clothes

And the part about the one that got away
When I was blind I fell behind
And here I've gotta stay

And I'm lying here wonderin'
Is it finally sinkin' in
To my weary heart, my foolish pride
And my stubborn head

I woke up on the right side, I woke up on the right side
On the right side of the wrong bed

I'm starin' at the autumn stars
And wondering if you are starin' too
And every little satellite
And aeroplane that passes by
Just leaves me blue

Chasin' my tail like the second hand
Chases those grains of sand
In that television hourglass

And I'm lying here wonderin'
Is it finally sinkin' in
To my weary heart, my foolish pride
And my stubborn head

I woke up on the right side, I woke up on the right side
On the right side of the wrong bed

Chasin' my tail like the second hand
Chases those grains of sand
In that television hourglass

And I'm lying here wonderin'
Is it finally sinkin' in
To my weary heart, my foolish pride
And my stubborn head

I woke up on the right side, I woke up on the right side
On the right side of the wrong bed
On the right side of the wrong bed
