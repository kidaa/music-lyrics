Why the hell we waiting in line? 
A billion cars are front and behind 
We're going the way of the dinosaur 
And only this next time 
And everything will be alright 
If this coffin that I'm in was supplied 
I'd sail on home to my T.V. set 
I'm at Surprano's on at Sunday night I can't spell the T.V. show name, but it's that mob family thing 
Hey you move the car in front of me 
I've got a message for you 
Could you pass it on to the guy sitting in the car in front of you 
Ask him to pass it along 
To...

Chorus:
If we all drive 25 
We're gettin' no where 
If we all drive 75 
We'll get there faster 
If we all drive 105 
We'll get to heaven on time 

Bump all the bump ah, grumps 
All racing to get over the humpth 
And we realize what's on the other side 
And it no wonder why we come undone 
But I don't let it get me down, I just take a look around 
My wind shield is a movie screen 
And everybody's acting like a clown 
Hey you move the car in front of me 
I've got a message for you 
Could you pass it on to the guy sitting in the car in front of you 
Ask him to pass it along 
To...

Chorus

And in the end zone we see a couch 
With our T.V. dinner rights 
So if you see my window rolling down 
I got to change some foul mouth to cut you downside 

Hey you move the car in front of me 
I've got a message for you 
Could you pass it on to the guy sitting in the car in front of you 
Ask him to pass it along 
To...

Chorus
