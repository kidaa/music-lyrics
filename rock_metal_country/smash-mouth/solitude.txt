I lose my solitude  
I see myself in you I don't like what I see  
If my voice like you in sounds  
What the hell is going down  
I'm so pissed off at myself  
In the mirror, it's you that I see  
Staring back at me  
I don't like what I see  
I try to look the other way, and pretend that I'm okay  
But I know it's kinda true  
Look at myself, your just like me  
I've always told myself at you  

I didn't want to be I lose my solitude  
I see myself in you  
I don't like what I see I change but it's a work  
I'm going back down to what is worse  
I can't believe I yelled at you  
You yelled at me can't you see  
We're going no where fast, like a plane will crash  
Like a plane would crash, like a plane will crash  

You always said that you were proud  
Let me lay and rest your doubts  
The critizem I can't take  
But I can't deal with all your hate  
I can't deal with all your hate 2x  
Never seem to ever let up  
All I needed was a friend  
Someone to talk to, someone to turn my thoughts around  
Pick me up when I fall down  
Lead me in the right direction  
Aid me in my ressurection  
You kicked me 'round I try to tell you I've had enough  
Feel my thoughts and feel my soul  
Tell me which way that I should go  
Which way that I should go, I should go  

I lose my solitude  
I see myself in you I don't like what I see  
I lose my solitude  
I see myself in you I don't like what I see
