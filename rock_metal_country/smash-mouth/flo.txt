Your friends keep telling me
I bear a striking resemblance to someone you used to know
But baby's it's me
So why the hell do you keep calling me "Flo"
And I would hope
That you would have the decency to
Let me go
In case of an emergency 

But you keep reassuring me
Telling me to just quit tripping on it
And maybe its me
I guess that I should probably get a grip on it
"But" its hard to do
Every time I see that tattoo
Over your heart
It ain't right I cant even look at you 

Why you doing what you're doing
You should be doing what you want
Who the fuck you think you're fooling
She's the one you want 

Florence if you hear this wont you
Come and take your girlfriend back
She's been calling out your name
Every time were in the sack
She's been a mess since you've been apart
So Flo if you had half a heart
Florence can you hear me
Can you hear me Flo
Florence can you hear
Can you hear me Flo 

Were been going for a while
But lately she's been somewhere else
She don't even smile
And I think its a cry for "help"
And I would pray
That you would have the common courtesy
To take her away
It aint right she don't belong to me 

Why you doing what you're doing
You should be doing what you want
You're the only one your fooling
She's the one the one you want 

Florence if you hear this wont you come and pick your
Girlfriend up
She's been talking in her sleep and I think I've had enough
She's been a wreck since you've been away
So Flo if you have something to say
Florence can you hear
Can you hear me Flo
Florence can you hear
Can you hear me Flo
Florence can you hear
Can you hear me Flo
Florence can you hear
Can you hear me
