Can you hear it? 
Yeah man 

Now I'm the king of the swingers 
Oh, the jungle VIP 
I've reached the top and had to stop 
And that's what's botherin' me 
I wanna be a man, mancub 
And stroll right into town 
And be just like the other men 
I'm tired of monkeyin' around! 

Oh, oobee doo 
I wanna be like you 
I wanna walk like you 
Talk like you, too 
You'll see it's true 
An ape like me 
Can learn to be human too 

Now don't try to kid me, mancub 
I made a deal with you 
What I desire was man's red fire 
To make my dream come true 
Now give me the secret, mancub 
Come on, clue me what to do 
Give me the power of man's red flower 
So I can be like you 

Oh, oobee doo 
I wanna be like you 
I wanna walk like you 
Talk like you, too 
You'll see it's true 
An ape like me 
Can learn to be human too 

Check this out 
Can you hear it? 
Yeah

Get it, papa bear 

Yeah you! 
I wanna be like you 
I wanna walk like you 
Talk like you, too 
You'll see it's true 
Someone like me 
Can learn to be 
Someone like me 
Can learn to be 
Someone like you 
I can learn to be 
Someone like me
