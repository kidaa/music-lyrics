I caught you looking at yourself 
Don't worry about it you look fine 
How did you get your hair so tight 
Kicking things, you might as well fight 
It's January/February you've got a tan 
I've got to hand it to you man 
You're the bull of the ball 
Trying to stand tall 
Thinking you can take them all 

Sorry about your penis 3x 

I caught you looking at yourself 
I bet you got overhead cams 
Personalized plates and all 
Your truck was probably 20 feet tall 
I bet you say you do it a lot 
I bet you don't do it at all 
All the singers booted up 

You might as well fuck a guy up 

Sorry about your penis 3x 
Sorry I'm sorry 
Sorry i'm sorry so sorry 

You don't get it you'll never will 
Flirting with that macho man, overkill 
Seeing everything as if it was a sport 
The only thing you'll win is a case of warts 
Cookie cutter man you all you look a like 
Drink 'em up drink 'em up Fight! Fight! Fight! 
Move it with the man, got a tounge-in-cheek 
Don't re-create please, please, please 

Sorry about your penis 3x
