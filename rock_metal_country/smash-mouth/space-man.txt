you go around your tiny world again
Playing space man in your silver ship
You say you wanna come back down to Earth again
When you're down you find your mind and slip

There you go
Just like all the other times before
Space man, you're lost in space

Anti-gravitation keeps you high above
Like some comet speeding towards the sun
Communication's lost between the ones you love
It's impossible to think that something loves you more than us
