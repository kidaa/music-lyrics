Watching for a sound to lead me to where ever you go 
I can't help it I will always love you 
Chorus: 
It used to be no words could come between us 
Any time was right for secret meetings 
It's different now and when you speak 
Every word means no 2x 

I'm thinking of things that come to life 
Your going through some things so shallow 
Theres nothing to fight 

It used to be no words could come between us 
Any time was right for secret meetings 
It's different now and when you speak 
Every word means no 2x 

I'm a slave I'm anything 
I haven't lost my way 
I'm looking around in directions 
'Cause all I ever thought about was you 
Predicting puts me down on shaky ground 
I keep thinking your looking at me 
Do you want me around 

It used to be no words could come between us 
Any time was right for secret meetings 
It's different now and when you speak 
Every word means no 2x
