Met someone I knew before
The windowpane to the soul
They will never let you down
And we'd know
We've seen each other around

Doing the late night downtown crawl
Deep inside I know I'm sick and tired of it all
It comes too quick and goes too fast
Does anything ever last at all?

We're just looking for a wall to crash into
And me I'd be happy just bumping into you

Here I am and there they go
And if you ask me how I know
The oldest story in the world
Then I hope someday you'll know

That they'll never die if you never grieve
Everybody's moving to a place they gotta leave
So kill your TV and kill your phone
Be quiet and be alone with you

When technology solves apologies I will retire
With records and candles and pencils and cameras
And your soul in my eyes...
