Waking up in the morning  
My X is calling she tells me to get a job  
She tells me that I'm a slob  
But still she's calling  
Until 3 in the morning  
I come home stumbling  
I'm looking for something to eat  
My head is killing me  
It's not as good as it seems  

But I know one thing is true  
Things were better when I had you  

She known each other  
I punched your brother  
Call the police on me  
Your dad's coming after me  
Don't you take my dollar  
Restraining orders  
I keep changing my number  
You putting the blame on me  
I didn't know she was under 18  
She showed me a fake ID  
It's not as good as it looks  
It's not as good as it seems but I know one thing is true  
Things were better when I had you  

But I know one thing is true  
I'm just trying to get rid of you  
Slashing my tires, she broke into my room  
Went through my garbage  
Checking under my covers  
Looking for rubbers  
Investigate my laundry  
Changing my dead bolts  
She threw a brick through my window  
Wrapped it in a letter  
Saying I hate you I'm gonna kill you  
I could never forgive you  
But I know one thing is true to be continued
