Pack it up, pack it in let me begin 
I came to win battle me that's a sin 
I won't tear the sack up 
Punk you better pack up 
Try to play the role and yo the whole crew will act up 
Get up stand up, stand up c'mon throw your hands up 
If you get the feeling, jump across the ceiling 
Once with the funk flow someone's talkin' junk 
Yo I'll bust 'em in the eye and then I'll take the punks home 
Feel it, funk it, amps in the trunk 
And I got more rhymes than there's cops at a dunkin 
Donut shop 
Sure 'nuff I got props 
Kids on the hill, plus my mom and my pops 

I'll serve your ass like Jon MacEnroe 
If your girl steps up I'm smacking the hoe 
Words to your mom I came to drop bombs 
Got more rhymes than the bibles got psalms 
And just like the Prodigal son I've returned 
Anyone stepping to me you'll get burned 
'Cause I've got lyrics But you ain't got none 
If you came to battle bring a shotgun 
But if you do you're a fool 'cause I'll duel to the death 
Try to step to me and take your last breath 
Got the skill come get your fill 
'Cause when I shoot to give I shoot to kill 

I am the cream of the crop I rise to the top 
I never eat a pig, 'cause a pig is a cop 
Or better yet a terminator 
Like Arnold Scwreznegger 
Trying to play me out as if my name was Sega 
But I ain't going out like no punk bitch 
Get used to one style yo and I might switch 
Up up and around then buck buck ya down 
Put out your head and you wake up in the dawn of the dead 
I'm comin' to get ya, I'm comin' to get ya 
Spitting out lyrics 
Homie I'll wet ya
