You better love your mother 
She's the only one you've got 
Yes you better love your mother 
It's now or not 

You better cup your hands with gratitude 
'Cause your harmony is out of tune 
You better cup your hands with gratitude 
You better shake that funky attitude 

You better love your mother 
'Cause you know she's got the blues 
Yes you better love your mother 
'Cause she's warming up to you 

You better cup your hands with gratitude 
'Cause your harmony is out of tune 
You better cup your hands with gratitude 

You better shake that funky attitude 2x 
Just shake that funky attitude 
C'mon and shake that funky attitude 
You better shake that funky attitude 
C'mon and shake that funky attitude
