If you don't wanna be 
Like all the rest of them 
Like all my so called friends 
Walk with me, stand by me 
Take what you want from me 
Get what you feel you need 
If it means that much to 
Take it please 

Chorus: 
If you don't come if you don't go 
If you think there's something I should know 
You can come and share your misery with me 
Yeah with me 

Why don't you understand 
That my hearts lying in your hands 
You squeeze and bleed me dry 
I try to live you want me to die 
If it means that much to you 
If you think there's something I should do 
Take what you want from me 
Get what you need take it please 

If you don't come if you don't go 
If you think there's something I should know 
You can come and share your misery with me 
Yeah with me 

If you don't come if you don't go 
If you think there's something I should know 
You can come and share your misery with me 
Yeah with me 

If you don't come if you don't go 
If you think there's something I should know 
You can come and share your misery with me 
Yeah with me
