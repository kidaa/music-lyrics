We need a new planet
You were a rock but I took you for granite
Ain't that a shame, ain't it a sin?
We added too much baggage when our ship came in

Like a laser beam
You're never what I'm seeing
I ought to better my best behavior
I can't deny I lit the fire
But the twist of fate bridge was gonna burn anyway

Without you, it's no fun
It's like a total eclipse of the sun
Without you it's no wonder
It's like a total eclipse of the sun

It's just that time of the season
I'm getting tongue-tied facing my demons
But I'm free cuz I want you to be
But the twist of fate bridge was gonna burn anyway

We need a new planet
You were a peach but I told you to can it
You weren't the only pig in the pen
We added too much baggage when our ship came in
