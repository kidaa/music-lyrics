I don't love you but I want to
Just give me something that I cant hold on to
Come on baby and speed your lust to me
Here's my number on a cocktail napkin
Think about it like a loaded weapon
Cock the hammer and point that thing at me 

[Chorus:]
Why don't you call [3x]
Kill me for the thrill of it all 

I want someone anyone
Tall ones short ones skinny ones
I want someone anyone 

You spend your nights at home crying
I spend mine death defying
I call it testing morality
So pull the goggles down over your eyes
Say good night to the rest of the barflies
I'm forever yours temporarily 

[Repeat Chorus]

I want someone anyone
Drunk ones spun ones anyone
I want someone anyone 

Fat ones whacked ones give me some
I want someone anyone
Spend some rent one lend me one
Fun ones dumb ones gypsy chicks on rocks
Done ones even chicks with chicken pox 

I want someone anyone [4x]
Drunk ones spun ones give me some
I want someone anyone
Fat ones whacked ones anyone
I want someone anyone
