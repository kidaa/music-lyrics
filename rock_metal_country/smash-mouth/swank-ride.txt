Well there she is undercover 
A wild, wild lover 
Take a ride and show her off like a movie star 
I got all my boys wit' me, Coolio is lookin' spiffy 
And I'm lookin' for a safe spot to park the ride 
I slipped the man a twenty, the keys to a Hunsay 
Have a backin', 45 eating sure's to the wink 
And jumps into the frontseat 
Purring like a kitty, she throws her ass in drive 
You can hear it comin', a big 8 hummin' 
Stereo thumping through American steel 
With the "boom-boom-tick", the bass so sick 
The line so sick, sittin' on stock wheels 
'65 dons-a truck inside, with a hoola-hoop 
Shaking by the dashboard - lights 
I gonna keep the chrome out of the ride 
I gotta keep it clean, I gotta keep it tide Sounds like Steve to me 

CHORUS:
Born in the '60's 
When they still took pride 
Making sure the need-you was a - 
Swank, Swank, Ride 

"Hey you gonna slow that car down?!" 
To the bounce 
I get when I'm waiting at the lights 
The cops, the kids, their checkin' out the ride 
And I, I like the ??? back, but I'm never rocking nice 
But if you wanna drag, I think you better think twice 
A natural born killer's still quick and precise 
And a little bit of this, could you wonder what I got? 
Well it don't stop 
I keep a ???, out of sight 
Far-out green, and berry-white 
'Cause we're on our way up, inspiration calls 
The ladies hit it hard with their sexy charms 
I hit a ??? as it's goin' off 
And I wonder who she likes more - 
Me or the car? 

CHORUS 
Then Coolio raps a bunch of hard to understand crap 
CHORUS And the chorus trails off
