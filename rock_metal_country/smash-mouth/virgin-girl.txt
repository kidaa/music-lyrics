Met a girl last summer 
She was a vir, a virgin girl 
Talked a while on the corner 
She was high, she was really bye, bye 
Had a sandy dress, unshaven legs 
But a beauty you could not face 
And who am I to say that a beauty goes away 
When she smokes the sensi day after day 
My integrity does not agree 

She calls me in the morning 
And says let's go to the ??? 
??????????????? and if you keep the girl 
At least don't eat her keys 
She packs the pipe as much as she can fill 
She boxes it up, she smokes it up 
And says that's good shit 
About this time I start feeling just right 
I'm trying to drive with the contact high 
So pump pump pump pump pump pump 
Pump pump pump pump my brakes 
A style in the make of my in-take 
So what's it do for ya 
What's it prove for ya 
All that she could up with is this 
What'cha got against 
Why you on defense 
Let me tell you something about him 
It's the healing of the nation 
The food of the gods 
The product of your mother 
Of the know you got me wrong 
So roll it up, roll it up 
Stick it in a bomb 
Even make a Jamaican man sing a happy song 
And I don't know what it means 
When they say go long, go long 
But I own every record by "Cheech and Chong" 
It makes me feel so sexy when I'm lying in your arms 
All natural, no need to be alarmed 
When they legalize this shit 
I think about your farm
