Darling, I'm afraid to close my eyes when I'm going to bed
I'm afraid you'll crack the phone down over my head 

Why are all American girls so rough
Damn, that girl can't ever hurt you enough 

Lady lady, you knock me on my knees and I can't stand up
You got the look in your eye and you smack my butt 

Why are all American girls so rough
Why do all American girls act so tough
Why are all American girls so rough 

Darling, I'm afraid to close my eyes when I'm goin to bed
I'm afraid you'll crack the phone down over my head 

Why are all American girls so rough
Damn, that girl can't ever hurt you enough 

Lady lady, you knock me on my knees and I can't stand up
You got that look in your eye and you smack my butt 

Why are all American girls so rough
Why do all American girls act so tough
Why are all American girls so rough 

That hole you're digging in my ribs
It ain't no real wound
So baby take it easy
Let's try to be friends
Why are all American girls so rough
Damn, that girl can't ever hurt you enough 

Lady lady, you knock me down on my knees and I can't stand up
You got the look in your eye, you smack my butt 

Why are all American girls so rough
Why do all American girls act so tough
Why are all American girls so rough
