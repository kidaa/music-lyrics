Simple stages in my mind 
Now I'm running out of time 
I'm wanting to 
I wanna do you 

Taking stock of feelings stored 
Running circles overboard 
I'm wanting to I wanna do you 
O Lisa 
Can you 
Love me again? 
I'll be holding on till then 

Only old enough to tell 
What is right and what is hell 
I'm wanting to 
I wanna do you 

And if this is our last goodbye 
I would love to see you cry 
I'm wanting to 
I wanna do you 

O Lisa 
Can you 
Love me again? 
I'll be holding on till then 
I'll be holding on till then 

O Lisa 
Can you 
Love me again? 
I'll be holding on till then 

And if this is our last goodbye 
I would love to see you cry 
I'm wanting to 
I wanna do you 

I wanna do you 
I wanna do you 
I wanna do you
