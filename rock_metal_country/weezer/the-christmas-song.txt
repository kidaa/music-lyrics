You told me you would be here by my side
Warming my heart on this cold winter's night
Here I sit waiting beside the tree all by myself 

You told me you would move heaven and earth
Cheering my spirits with laughter and mirth
Here I sit waiting beside the tree all by myself 

Oh, could you ever know how much I care
Could you ever know that out somewhere
There's a boy who really hurts 

Since I found you
I found a girl
I found a thorn
I found a queen
Now I am warm 

Oh, could you ever know how much I care
Could you ever know that out somewhere
There's a boy who really hurts 

Since I found you
I found a girl
I found a thorn
I found a queen
Now I am warm 

You told me you would bring presents and treats
Cheering my spirits with homemade sweet meats
Here I sit waiting beside the tree all by myself 

Here I sit waiting beside the tree all by myself
