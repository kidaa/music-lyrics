I can't help my feelings, I'll go out of my mind 
These players come to get me 'cause they'd like my behind 
I can't love my business if I can't get a trick 
Down on Santa Monica where tricks are for kids 

Oh, come on and kick me 
Oh, come on and kick me 
Come on and kick me 
You've got your problems 
I've got my ass wide 
You've got your big G's 
I've got my hash pipe 

I can't help my boogies they get out of control 
I know that you don't care but I want you to know 
The knee-stocking flavor is a favorite treat 
Of men that don't bother with the taste of a teat 

Oh, come on and kick me 
Oh, come on and kick me 
Come on and kick me 
You've got your problems 
I've got my ass wide 
You've got your big G's 
I've got my hash pipe 
I've got my hash pipe 

Oh, come on and kick me 
Oh, come on and kick me 
Come on and kick me 
You've got your problems 
I've got my ass wide 
You've got your big G's 
I've got my hash pipe 
I've got my hash pipe 

I've got my hash pipe 
I've got my hash pipe
