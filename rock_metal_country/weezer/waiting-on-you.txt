Why haven't you called me
Did you forget me
I need to know
When were you intending
To break the silence
And let me know 

Mine is the loneliest of numbers
Now is the loneliest of times
You're 19 days late, but still I sit and wait
Waiting and waiting, waiting and waiting, waiting and waiting
Waiting on you 

Who have you been seeing
That made you forget me
I bet you call him
Where, oh where does he come from
I bet he lives close by
I bet he's just a friend 

Mine is the loneliest of numbers
Now is the loneliest of times
You're 19 days late, but still I sit and wait
Waiting and waiting, waiting and waiting, waiting and waiting
Waiting on you 

Waiting and waiting, waiting and waiting, you've got me waiting
Waiting on you 

I asked you if you'd ever do me harm
You answered, 'Yes, I'll never do you harm'
I asked you if you'd ever do me harm
You answered, 'Yes, I'll never do you harm'
