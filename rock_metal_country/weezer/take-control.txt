Leave me now,
Show me how.

And I won't be ashamed,
Of the things we once made,
And I won't be coming back
'Round here no more.

Lead and try,
Tell me why.

And I won't let you down,
Drag your name all over town,
And I won't be comin' back
'Round here no more.

Yo everyone, everyone,
Everyone I know, 
Take control.

And I won't let you down,
Drag your name all over town,
And I won't be comin' back
'Round here no more.
Yo everyone, everyone,
Everyone I know, 
Take control.
