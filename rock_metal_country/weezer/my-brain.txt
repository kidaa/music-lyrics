My brain is working overtime 
I need something to ease my mind 
'Cause as my thoughts go manic 
I really start to panic 
There's no place to hind behing 
I'm freaking and hallucinating 
Going last when I should wait 
My parents think I'm crazy 
But damn I'm going crazy 
I can't help my mental state 

Nooo 
Oh, I might [he's tripping] 
Take things out [and slipping] 
Take these brains out of my way 

I work into a frenzied fit 
I bite the corners of my lip 
I'm losing my [???] 
My pants don't even fit right 
Take away the the [???] 
Give me something for my hair 
A fresher pair of underwear 
As if I was a no one 
I am [???] 
I just want it, I don't care 

Nooo 
Oh, I might [he's tripping] 
Take things out [and slipping] 
Take these brains out of my way 

I tell the world to [???] 
It's you who decides what sick or healthy 
And all the people I see 
That's making lots of Benji's 
Make me want to [???] myslef 
Start a brand new fashion trend 
Those are for the deeper end 
[???] 
[???] 
[???] 

Nooo 
Oh, I might [he's tripping] 
Take things out [and slipping[ 
Take these brains out of my way 

I don't care
