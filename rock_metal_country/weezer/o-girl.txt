Aaah
O girl, you look sad
Burnt out and half gone mad
Still filling up the place
With tears on your face 

Freaked out and scared to move
You don't wanna have to prove
That you're among the same
Pining away 

O girl, I thought you were cool
Until you tried not to get hurt
But now I see in your eyes
The pain that can't be just mine
You're like me 

O girl, you're trembling
 ...and stumbling
That you're among the same
Please go away 

O girl, I thought you were cool
Until you tried not to get hurt
But now I see in your eyes
The pain that can't be just mine
You're like me
