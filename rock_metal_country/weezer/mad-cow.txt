I'm watching and waiting 
Disintegrating 
I know that you hear me 
If you could come near me 

But no one can save me now 
I'm lost, just like a cow 
Madness burning inside my brain 
My brain 

Falling to pieces 
Breaking the leases 
I know that you hear me 
If you could come near me 

But no one can save me now 
I'm lost, just like a cow 
Madness burning inside my brain 
My brain 

I know that you hear me 
If you could come near me 

But no one can save me now 
I'm lost, just like a cow 
Madness burning inside my brain 

No one can save me now 
I'm lost, just like a cow 
Madness burning inside my brain 
My brain 

Ooooooooooo
