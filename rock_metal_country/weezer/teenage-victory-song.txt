I'm gonna bury you 
I'm gonna bury you 
I dont care what you do 
As long as I approve 

'Cause you dont know the way I feel 
Spinning here inside this wheel 
I've been waiting for so long 
To sing my teenage victory song 

Whoa Lord I'm comin' home 

I'm gonna play all night 
I'm gonna beat you right 
And mash you in the nads 
And kick you outta sight 

'Cause you don't know the way I feel 
Spinning here inside this wheel 
I've been waiting for so long 
To sing my teenage victory song 

Whoa Lord I'm comin' home 

C'mon everybody sing along [sing along] 
Lets make them feel dumb 
'Cause they were wrong [they were wrong] 
We'll dance and sing the night away [night away] 
Say you'll stay 

'Cause you dont know the way I feel 
Spinning here inside this wheel 
I've been waiting for so long 
To sing my teenage victory song 

Whoa Lord I'm comin' home 

C'mon everybody sing along [sing along] 
Lets make them feel dumb 
'Cause they were wrong [they were wrong] 
We'll dance and sing the night away [night away] 
Say you'll stay 

I'm gonna play all night 
I'm gonna beat you right 
And mash you in the nads 
And kick you outta sight 

'Cause you dont know the way I feel
