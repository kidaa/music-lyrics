Amy Moore blew her top
Stole a car, shot a cop
Sped away 2000 miles
Didn't stop until she hit New Orleans 

But that's alright
There's just one thing
Her wedding ring, or anything
She left behind, forgot to pack
How the hell is she gonna get it back 

Paperface
Paperface
I never heard of paperface
Until I moves to the west coast
Where I found that to be smooth
I had to wear a paperface 

That's alright
There's just one thing
How am I supposed to sing
With this thing in my way
With this thing...
In my face
Paperface
Paperface 

Only hope to see
See what's underneath
Only hope to be
The me that's underneath 

Amy Moore blew her top

How the hell is she gonna get it back 

Paperface, paperface, paperface, paperface!
