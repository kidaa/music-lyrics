Crab if you want her
She won't be coming down
Crab if you want her
She won't be coming down

Crab if you need it
She put her knickers on
Crab if you need it
She put her knickers on

She said she's feeling lonely
And I say that's Ok
She won't be coming back 'round here, no way

She said she's feeling lonely
And I say that's Ok
She won't be coming back 'round here, no way

T'aint gonna do no good
Crab at the booty
T'aint gonna do no good

No, crab at the booty
T'aint gonna do no good
