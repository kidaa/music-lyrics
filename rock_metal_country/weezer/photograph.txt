If you want it, you can have it 
But you've got to learn to reach out there and grab it 

'Cause everybody wants some love 
Shooting from the stars above 
And though my heart will break 
There's more that I could take 
I could never get enough 

If you need it, you should show it 
'Cause you might play so monastic that you blow it 

'Cause everybody wants some, ooh 
Something they can barely know 
And though my heart will break 
There's more that I could take 
I could never let it go 

It's in the photograph 
It's in the photograph 
It's in the photograph of love 

'Cause everybody wants a dream 
Something they can barely see 
And though my heart will break 
There's more that I could take 
I could never let it be 

It's in the photograph 
It's in the photograph 
It's in the photograph of love 

If you blew it, don't reject it 
Just sit drawing up the plans and re-erect it 
Just sit drawing up the plans and re-erect it 
Just sit drawing up the plans and re-erect it
