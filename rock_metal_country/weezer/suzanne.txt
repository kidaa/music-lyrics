Suzanne, you're all that I wanted of a girl
You're all that I need in the world
I'm your child, make me blush, drive me wild
Suzanne, you're all that I wanted 

When I met you I was all alone
Cold and hungry cryin' on the phone
You baked me brownies and said, 'Don't you cry'
And gave me the coat off your back 

Suzanne, you're all that I wanted of a girl
You're all that I need in the world
I'm your child, make me blush, drive me wild
Suzanne, you're all that I wanted 

Even Izzy, Slash and Axl Rose
When I call, you put 'em all on hold
And say to me that you'd do anything
And all I can do is say that
I haven't much I can give you in return
Only my heart and a promise not to turn
But I sing to you every day and every night
Suzanne, I'm your man 

Suzanne, you're all that I wanted of a girl
You're all that I need in the world
I'm your child, make me blush, drive me wild
Suzanne, you're all that I wanted
Of a girl
