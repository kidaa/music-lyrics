Woo-hoo hoo-hoo hoo-hoo hoo-hoo hoo-hoo hoo
Hoo hoo-hoo hoo-hoo hoo-hoo hoo-hoo hoo

You wanna cry
When you're dealing with the kids

Woo-hoo hoo-hoo hoo-hoo hoo-hoo hoo-hoo hoo
Hoo hoo-hoo hoo-hoo hoo-hoo hoo-hoo hoo

They know it all
And they're pinning you to boards

It's a game
And you play
But you can't have fun when all they do is say
Lies

They know it all
And they're pinning you to boards

It's a game
And you play
But you can't have fun when all they do is say
Lies
