Hold my head
While trampoline
Finally through the roof
And on to somewhere near
Falling down, Velouria
Her covering, and traveling career
She can really move
Oh Velveteen 

My Velouria, my Velouria
Even I'll adore ya
My Velouria
Even I'll adore ya
My Velouria 

You say to me 'where have you been'
Finally through the roof
And how does lemur's skin, reflect the sea
Velouria, where have you been 

My Velouria, my Velouria
Even I'll adore ya
My Velouria
Even I'll adore ya
My Velouria 

Move away in the shine of the other
Move away in the shine of the other
Move away of in the tides of the summer
Every summer
Every
My Velouria, my Velouria 

Forever green
I know she's here, in California
I can see the tears
of Shastasheen 

My Velouria, my Velouria
Even I'll adore ya
My Velouria
Even I'll adore ya
My Velouria
Even I'll adore ya
My Velouria
Even I'll adore ya
My Velouria
