Thief, of silent dreams
Of golden scenes
Stole away 

All, it was in me
It wasn't me
Who slipped away 

Now I stand with skin and bones
Without a dime to call my home
Only a voice to tell you
Thief, you've taken all that was me 

Rain, It laughed so hard
It cried on me
You rain on me 

Cleanse, cleanse my soul
The soul to be
The me to be 

Now I stand with skin and bones
Without a dime to call my home
Only a voice to scream at you 

Now I stand with skin and bones
Without a dime to call my home
Only a voice to scream at you
Thief, you've taken all that was me
Thief, you've taken all that was me
Thief, you've taken all that was me
Thief, you've taken all that was me 

Now I stand with skin and bones
Without a dime to call my home
Only a voice to scream at you
Thief, you've taken all that was me
Thief, you've taken all that was me
Thief, you've taken all that was me
