Thieves, and pain, and nauseating pills
Lies, and nails, and nauseating pills 

Why am I so hung up on your sister
Why am I so hung up on you mom
I thought that I would never even miss her
I thought that I would never use the bong 

And I never cry like that
And I never swear like that
And I never lose my mind 

Thieves, and pain, and dragon colored tears
Still, remain and cover up the years 

Why am I so hung up on your sister
Why am I so hung up on you mom
I thought that I would never even miss her
I thought that I would never use the bong 

And I never cry like that
And I never swear like that
And I never lose my mind 

Why am I so hung up on your sister
Why am I so hung up on you mom
I thought that I would never even miss her
I thought that I would never use the bong 

And I never cry like that
