Gonna make my move 
Gonna make it stay 
Gonna make it last 
Nevermind the past 
Living for today 

Hey, hey 
You know what you want me to say 
Right, right 
Fight, fight 
We can start a glorious day 

Gonna take my chance 
Gonna rock and dance 
Gonna hit the ground 
With a brand new sound 
Looking for romance 

Hey, hey 
You know what you want me to say 
Right, right 
Fight, fight 
We can start a glorious day 

Glorious children on my mind 
Glorious wastings of my time 
Glorious plans we make up 
Forcing things in line 

Hey, hey 
You know what you want me to say 
Right, right 
Fight, fight 
We can start a glorious day 

Glorious children on my mind 
Glorious wastings of my time 
Glorious plans we make up 
Forcing things in life 

Gonna rock it out 
Gonna scream and shout 

Gonna do it right 
Standing in the light 
Perchin' on the clouds 

Gonna do it right 
Standing in the light 
Perchin' on the clouds 

Gonna do it right 
Standing in the light 
Perchin' on the clouds 

Hey
