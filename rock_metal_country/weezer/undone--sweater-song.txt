I'm me
Me be
Goddamn
I am 
I can
Sing and
Hear me
Know me
If you want to destroy my sweater
Hold this thread as I walk away

Oh no
It go
It gone
Bye-Bye
Who I
I think
I sink
and I die
If you want to destroy my sweater
Hold this thread as I walk away
Watch me unravel I'll soon be naked
Lying on the floor, I've come undone

If you want to destroy my sweater
       [I don't want to destroy your tank-top]
Hold this thread as I walk away
       [Let's be friends and just walk away]
Watch me unravel I'll soon be naked
       [Hate to see you lyin' there in your Superman skivvies]
Lying on the floor, I've come undone
       [Lying on the floor, I've come undone]
