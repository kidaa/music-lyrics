take a listen around you all the people that around in your house,
they've benn wanting to kill you in your sleep,

take a load off and bow down to the others
who love to call you their names

they've been wanting to kill you in your sleep

and all the bull that people sling.
It doesn't matter what they sing.

so jump out, jump out,
get your groove on this one is for you so come on,
get out yer house, girl,
and give me a kiss.

and all the bull that people sling it doesn't matter what they sing

they to call you their names,
