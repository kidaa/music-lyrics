Love barely alive in your arms, slave
Dreams taken too far every night, slave

Who put on your heart
Who put on your heart
Who put on your heart
'Cause I can't change, no

When you're on your own
You can see things
Clear, clear as a bell
And you're free, slave

Who put on your heart
Who put on your heart
Who put on your heart
'Cause I can't change, no

And my girl we'll say good-bye
To the things we'll never try

Who put on your heart
Who put on your heart
Who put on your heart
'Cause I can't change, no

And my girl we'll say good-bye
To the things we'll never try

Love, barely alive
Love, barely alive
Love, barely alive
Slave...
