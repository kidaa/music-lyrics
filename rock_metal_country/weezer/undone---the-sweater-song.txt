If you want to destroy my sweater
Hold this thread as I walk away as I walk away
Watch me unravel, I'll soon be naked
Lying on the floor lying on the floor
I've come undone 

I don't want to destroy your tank-top
Let's be friends and just walk away
It's good to see you lying there in your Superman skivvies
Lying on the floor lying on the floor
I've come undone
