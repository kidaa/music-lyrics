The sea is foaming like a bottle of beer
The wave is coming but I ain't got no fear
I'm waxing down so that I'll go real fast
I'm waxing down because it's really a blast
I'm going surfin cos I don't like your face
I'm bailing out because I hate the race
Of rats that run round and round in the maze
I'm going surfing, I'm going surfing! 

You take your car to work
I'll take my board
And when you're out of fuel
I'm still afloat 

My buddies and their honeys all come along
They seem invincible as they surf along
The sea is rolling like a thousand pound keg
We're going surfing, we're going surfing! 

You take your car to work
I'll take my board
And when you're out of fuel
I'm still afloat 

You take your car to work
I'll take my board
And when you're out of fuel
I'm still afloat 

All along the undertow
Is strengthening it's hold
I never thought it would come to this
Now I can never go home 

All along the undertow
Is strengthening it's hold
I never thought it would come to this
Now I can never go home 

You take your car to work
I'll take my board
And when you're out of fuel
I'm still afloat 

All along the undertow you take your car to work
Is strengthening it's hold I'll take my board
I never thought it would come to this and when you're out of fuel
Now I can never go home I'm still afloat 

You take your car to work
I'll take my board
And when you're out of fuel
I'm still afloat 

You take your car
I'll take my board
You take your car
I'll take my board
Let's go!
