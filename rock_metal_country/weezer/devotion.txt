Suddenly our shortcomings
Don't seem to matter that much
Your IQ is 20 points low
And I'm no Six Foot Hot Look
All American Man
Sad to say I pushed you away
Waiting for 'Mrs. Right'
You never gave up 

Devotion, waiting for me
You'll always be my girlfriend
I too am waiting for you
I'll always be your friend 

I commend your stubborness
Without it we'd never got this far
I am done with perfection
Chasing her leaves me with nothing but pain
Unlike you, she isn't true
She's got her own concerns
You never gave up 

Devotion, waiting for me
You'll always be my girlfriend
I too am waiting for you
I'll always be your friend 

Devotion, waiting for me
You'll always be my girlfriend
I too am waiting for you
I'll always be your friend
