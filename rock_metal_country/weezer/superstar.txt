There used to be a better kind 
of rock and rollin' superstar 
They'd strut around and do their thing 
all I know how to do is sing 

And I don't do that so well 
I never summon things from hell 
I'm just a regular white guy 
who's afraid to rock so hard 
I'd break my guard 
and give myself away 

There used to be a better brand 
of frontman personality
