Let's go away for a while
You and I
To a strange and distant land
Where they speak no word of truth
But we don't understand anyway 

Holiday
Far away
To stay
On a holiday
Far away
Let's go today
In a heartbeat! 

Heartbeat
Heartbeat 

Don't bother to pack your bags
Or your map
We won't need them where we're going
We're going where the wind is blowing
Not knowing where we're gonna stay 

Holiday
Far away
To stay
On a holiday
Far away
Let's go today
In a heartbeat! 

Heartbeat
Heartbeat
Heartbeat
Heartbeat 

We will write a postcard
To our friends and family
In free verse
On the road with Kerouac
Sheltered in his Bivouac
On this road we'll never die... 

Heartbeat
Heartbeat 

Let's go away for a while
You and I
To a strange and distant land
Where they speak no word of truth
But we don't understand anyway 

Holiday
Far away
To stay
On a holiday
Far away
To stay
On a holiday! 

Let's go away
Let's go away
On a holiday
Let's go away
Let's go away
In a heartbeat
