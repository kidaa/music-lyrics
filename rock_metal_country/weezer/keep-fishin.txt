You'll never be
a better kind
if you don't leave
the world behind

waste my days,
drown aways,
it's just the thought of you
in love with someone else
it breaks my heart
to see you hanging from your shelf

you'll never do 
the things you want
if you don't move
and get a job

waste my days,
drown aways,
it's just the thought of you
in love with someone else
it breaks my heart
to see you hanging from your shelf

oh girl 
when I'm in love with you
keep fishin'
if you feel it's true
there's nothing much
that we can do
to save you from yourself

waste my days,
drown aways,
it's just the thought of you
in love with someone else
it breaks my heart
to see you hanging from your shelf

oh girl 
when I'm in love with you
keep fishin'
if you feel it's true
there's nothing much
that we can do
to save you from yourself

you'll never be a better kind
you'll never be a better kind
whoa, ohh...
whoa, ohh...
waste my days,
waste my days...
