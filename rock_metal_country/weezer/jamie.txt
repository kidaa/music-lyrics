Jamie, what you doing now
What you doing now girl
Please, please tell me
Cos I need to know, I need to know now
When I was down, you came to me
And promised you'd always be
By my side, now you're gone
And I'm waiting patiently
Jamie, I want you to know 

Jamie, Jamie, I'm so glad you're mine
We'll be together a long time 

Jamie, what you doing now
He's dialin' your car phone
Please, please be true
You know that I trust you, do that which you must do
When I was down, you came to me
And promised you'd always be
By my side, now you're gone
And I'm waiting patiently
Jamie, I want you to know 

Jamie, Jamie, I'm so glad you're mine
We'll be together a long time 

You've got the Beach Boys, and your firm's got the Stones
But I know you won't leave me alone
Sometimes it seems you're not with me
It hurts me so much, it hurts me so much
Sometimes it seems you're not with me
It hurts me so much, it hurts me so much 

You are the most, you're so rad, you're so fresh
And I'm so glad I am yours, you are mine
Show me where and I will sign
When I was down, you came to me
And promised you'd always be
By my side, now you're gone
And I'm waiting, waiting 

Jamie, Jamie, I'm so glad you're mine
We'll be together a long time 

Jamie, believe me, I won't let you down
Cos you are the best lawyer in town
Sometimes it seems you're not with me
It hurts me so much, it hurts me so much
Sometimes it seems you're not with me
It hurts me so much, it hurts me so much
I love you so much, I love you so much
