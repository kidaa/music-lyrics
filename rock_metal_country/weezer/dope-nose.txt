Debt on my head
Wasting time on my own

Sleep, rescue me
Take me back to my home

For the times that you wanna go and
Bust rhymes real slow
I'll appear, slap you on the face, and
Enjoy the show

Cheese smells so good
On a burnt piece of lamb
Fag of the year
Who could beat up your man

For the times that you wanna go and
Bust rhymes real slow
I'll appear, slap you on the face, and
Enjoy the show

this dope nose

For the times that you wanna go and
Bust rhymes real slow
I'll appear, slap you on the face, and
Enjoy the show

Oh, this dope nose
