I can't help it girl, I'm the preacher's son
I must live for peace till the day is done
But I will never let you go
Once I have got you in my hold
I'm gonna mold ya into something that I like
I can't change my ways, I'm a puppet's fool
If you need a fix, then I'll be your tool
But I will never let you go
Once I have got you in my hold
I'm gonna mold ya into something that I like 

Always take me back
Falling off the track
Always, I'm on fire to be with you tonight and make your body come 

I can't be someone that you wish I was
Just a tag a long, like you too because
But I will never let you go
Once I have got you in my hold
I'm gonna mold ya into something that I like 

Always take me back
Falling off the track
Always, I'm on fire to be with you tonight and make your body come 

I can't be someone that you wish I was
Just a tag a long, like you too because
But I will never let you go
Once I have got you in my hold
I'm gonna mold ya into something that I like 

Always take me back
Falling off the track
Always, I'm on fire to be with you tonight and make your body come 

I can't help it girl
