Just two good old boys everyone now, c'mon, never meaning no harm
Beats all you never saw, been in trouble with the law
Since the day they was born what were they doing man 

Straightening the curves, flattening the hills
Well someday the mountain might get 'em but the law never will 

Making their way, the only way they know how
That's just a little bit more than the law will allow 

Just two good ol' boys, wouldn't change if they could
They're fighting the system like two modern-day Robin Hoods
