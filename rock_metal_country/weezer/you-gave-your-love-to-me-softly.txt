You gave your love to me softly
I heard your heart beating true
Still your Bijon lingers on and on and on
You gave your love to me softly 

When I'm feeling blue and lonely
All I have to do is think of you
We had just one night but it lingers on and on and on
You gave your love to me softly 

La la la you sang to me
Baby don't you cry
Put your arms around me child
And lay with me tonight 

You gave your love to me softly 

La la la you sang to me
Baby don't you cry
Put your arms around me child
And lay with me tonight 

La la la
La la la
La la la la la la la
