I don't want to die
Even though I have to
I just want to live a long, long time 

And I see the gang to which I belong
Time to sing out our happy song
Wouldn't it be a cruel joke
If it's too late to try Why 

I don't wanna grow
Even if it's good growth
I just wanna stay just like this 

And I see the comfortable place to rest
Time to get this shit off my chest
Wouldn't it be a cruel joke
If it's too late to try Why 

And I see the comfortable place to rest
Time to get this shit off my chest
Wouldn't it be a cruel joke if it's true 

And I see the comfortable place to rest
Time to get this shit off my chest
Wouldn't it be a cruel joke
If it's too late to try Why 

Too
Late to try
Too
Late to try
And I never swear like that
And I never lose my mind 

And I never cry like that
And I never swear like that
And I never lose my mind
