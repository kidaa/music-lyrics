Ooo oh oh 
Ooo oh oh 

Any time that you want 
I'll be here in your arms 
Slently holding on To the girl with he charms 
But if there comes a day 
You should turn your heart away 
I'll be down on my knees 
Beggin' for that girl to stay 

Don't let go 
Ooo oh oh 
Don't let go 
Ooo oh oh 

Anything you desire 
I will set at your feet 
With a kiss in the air 
For the gods to receive
But if there comes a day 
You should turn your heart away 
I'll be down on my knees 
Beggin' for that girl to stay 

Confrontations in my mind 
Got me running out of time 

Don't let go 
Ooo oh oh 
Don't let go 
Ooo oh oh 

But if there comes a day You should turn your heart away 
I'll be down on my knees eggin' for that girl to stay 

Don't let go 
Ooo oh oh 
Don't let go 
Ooo oh oh
