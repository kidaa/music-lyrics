Every time that I turn around 
I just see the same old thing 
Beg to try and to bring me back 
To the place I couldn't keep 

But I'm an asshole 
Storm the castle 
Burn the bridges 
Down to the ground 
Take no prisoners 
We're just visiting 
We don't care about anything 

That's the way these modern dukes will go 
It's every man here for himself 

Every time that I turn around 
I just see the same old crap 
Trucks are trying to grease the wheels 
So that they can get laid back 

But I'm an asshole 
Storm the castle 
Burn the bridges 
Down to the ground 
Take no prisoners 
We're just visiting 
We don't care about anything 

That's the way these modern dukes will go 
It's every man here for himself 

I'm an asshole 
Storm the castle 
Burn the bridges 
Down to the ground 
Take no prisoners 
We're just visiting 
We don't care about anything
