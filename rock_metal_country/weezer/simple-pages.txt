Gimme some love, gimme some love, gimme some I want you to know 
Gimme some love, gimme some love, sugar thats the wrong wrong way to go 
Open your arms, open your arms honey, and come right back home to me 
Gimme some love, gimme some love, sugar thats the wrong wrong way to be 

Can't you see 
Where to be this time 
Simple pages on my mind 

Kick it on back, kick it on back, kick it on back to what you know 
Gimme some love, gimme some love, sugar on the hard rock radio 
When they play tunes, when they play tunes, when they play riffs of the hard rock beat 
Gimme some love, gimme some love sugar from the drop with the old school meet 

Can't you see 
Where to be this time 
Simple pages on my mind 

Gimme something I can believe, oh baby 

Can't you see 
Where to be this time 
Simple pages on my mind 

Kick it on back, kick it on back, kick it on back to what you know 
Gimme some love, gimme some love, sugar on the hard rock radio 

So gimme some love 
Gimme some love 
Gimme some love 
Gimme some love 
Gimme some 

Can't you see 
You're just me 
Turn these pages of my mind 
Oh, oh
