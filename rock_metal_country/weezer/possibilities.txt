Give it all away
Give it all away

Oh, oh
Possibilities
Take you home with me
In your arms

I never thought I'd do that
Take me all the way
And let your body stay

Oh, oh
Take me by the hand
Let me be the man in your arms

I never thought I'd do that
Take me all the way
And let your body stay

Oh, you're gone
Oh, you're gone
You're gone, you're gone to stay

I never thought I'd do that
Take me all the way
And let your body stay

Oh, you're gone
Oh, you're gone
You're gone, you're gone to stay

Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh
I need you
I plead you now
Fall together, get up

Yeah, yeah, yeah
