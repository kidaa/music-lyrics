Burning like a thousand suns
Light years flash before my eyes
My hands on the trigger of a smoking gun
Shatterer of worlds I have become!

We'll burn the sun tonight
Light up the skies and watch the flames
We'll burn the sun tonight
Light up the skies and watch the flames
No more days no more nights,
Cause we'll burn the sun

Devastation is calling me
Dare forces conspire against thee
Who will sit on the vacant throne
To govern a kingdom of burning bones
