 MUSIC & LYRICS BY DAVID DEFEIS 
KLYTEMNESTRA:
Guardian of the Lies of Faith
Darker now this Tale of Hate
Look into the Eyes of Death
Buried in another's Flesh

AGAMEMNON:
Fate guide my Hand as I ride Hell's Wind
Hole in the Sky where the Blackest Spirits Rage

ELDERS, KLYTEMNESTRA,
AGAMEMNON & ELEKTRA:
THROUGH THE RING OF FIRE-
THROUGH THE RING OF PAIN
THROUGH THE RING OF FIRE, I AM BORN AGAIN
THROUGH THE RING OF FIRE-
THROUGH THE RING OF PAIN
THROUGH THE RING OF FIRE, I AM BORN AGAIN

KLYTEMNESTRA:
Now you live and now you die
Across the Lake of Gorgon's Eyes
Crimson Blood, a Hero's Quest
Atone for Death with still more Death
Hate guides my Hand as I smile within
Hole in the Sky where the Blackest Spirits Rage

ALL:
THROUGH THE RING OF FIRE-
THROUGH THE RING OF PAIN
THROUGH THE RING OF FIRE, I AM BORN AGAIN
THROUGH THE RING OF FIRE-
THROUGH THE RING OF PAIN
THROUGH THE RING OF FIRE, I AM BORN AGAIN

ELDERS:
Right's on the side of our Twin Thrones of War
Bold are the Crowns in their Hands
Bright are the Signs of the Godhead
Justice is found where the Proud Eagles Reign

ELDERS:
Blind Persuasion, crack the Holy Tearless Eyes
Will the True Kings return, Thunder greets you with a Sword

ELEKTRA:
Guardian of the Lies of Faith
Harken now this Tale of Hate
Noble Deeds were done this Day
Welcome home your King betrayed

KLYTEMNESTRA:
Fate guides my hand as I plunge this Blade
Hole in your Heart where the Blackest Furies Rage

ALL:
THROUGH THE RING OF FIRE-
THROUGH THE RING OF PAIN
THROUGH THE RING OF FIRE, I AM BORN AGAIN
THROUGH THE RING OF FIRE-
THROUGH THE RING OF PAIN
THROUGH THE RING OF FIRE, I AM BORN AGAIN

ELDERS & ELEKTRA:
Hope is Rising with the Sound of our Glory
We will see where we lie

ALL:
AH, AH, AH, AH, AHA AH AH AH, ETC.
