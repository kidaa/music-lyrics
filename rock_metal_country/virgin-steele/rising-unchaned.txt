Piercing the veil of Eternity, lashed by the winds of Hades
Titan fists and Gods collide
From the caves of ice the Midgard Serpent roars
As the stars fall from the sky
War kills we die, with golden tears Odin falls

You're the deliverer-King Unchained
You're the deliverer-King Unchained

With a twilight kiss upon your frozen brow
Golden Dawn when you awake
You're the first and last whose coming was foretold
Crown of Glory, worlds unfold
Come forth arise, twelve Golden Dreams forge the prize

You're the deliverer-King Unchained
You're the deliverer-He Who Reigns

Meeting on the Twilight Bridge, the Giants of Jotenheim align
"against the Hosts of Heaven. The sun turns black and falls,
lightning cracks Bifrost the Rainbow Bridge of three hues,
while time comes to an end.
The wolf Fenrir breaks his chain, Yggdrasil, is laid waste and the
Universe comes crashing down. But after defeat, One will come
beyond the reach of all Evil, greater even than Odin, to create a
new Heaven and Earth set in a Golden Age forevermore."

Don't cry for mercy for you know there will be none
There in your darkness, you've been blinded by the sun
And you'll see me tread the air, crown of fire upon my hair,
you will die
Come forth arise, your time has come, forge the prize

Don't cry for mercy `cause you know there will be none
There in your darkness, you've been blinded by the sun
Crowned in blood I tread the air, worlds are formed within my stare
See them RISE !!!

You're the deliverer-King Unchained
You're the deliverer-King Unchained

You're the deliverer-He Who Reigns !!!
