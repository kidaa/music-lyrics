Music and lyrics: De Feis
Never say ?never'
Keep both your eyes on the flame
The power that lies within you
Comes forth once again

Onward through darkness
Envisions the diamonds beyond
Through burning, deceit and cooruption
The dream still lives on

And you're standing there
Raise your hands
Split the air- tonight!

Action call to arms
I'm fighting for eternity
For honour, for grace and for glory
Immortality
Layer by layer
By mortar, by rampart, by stone
A fortress, a haven for love
I can call my ownAnd you're standinbg there...
Raise your hands
Split the air...
And dream for tomorrow
Take my hand, we'll be free
Ancient kingdoms in the sunset
In the darkness of our years
Never fade

And you're standing there...
Raise your hands
Split the air...
And dream for tomorrow
Take my hands, cross the sea
Raibow castles in the distance
Emerald sands beckon me

Come to me, come to me
Heed the voice that is calling
Come to me, come to me
For thy kingdom
Awaits your crowning
Come to me...
