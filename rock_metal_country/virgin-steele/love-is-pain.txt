Music and lyrics: De Feis
I see the winter in her eyes
As I turn to go
See the pain on her face
A frozen rose

With the toss of her hair
And the bite of her lip
She'll ask me so shy
"Anything left to say?"

And I say 
"No, no baby, not this time
Again-
This time it's over
You've got to learn"

Chorus:
Now, darlin' love is cruel
Darlin' love is blind 
Love is pain
So cry
Shed a tear today
Shed a tear my baby
Love is painI see our love out of reach
Arms intwined with lies
What shattered the night
Still haunts me in the rain

Now you're lost child, lost
Like a ship on the storm
Your distant eyes
Are shadows of others I've known

Bridge & Chorus
I Love you
Love is pain
