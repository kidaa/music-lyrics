This is the land of my beginning,
these are the mountains of my birth
Dark with the blood of desecration,
oh where is she who is my pride
EMELAITH

I hear the Weeping of the Spirits,
dark wings of hated fill the world
I know she's waiting out there somewhere,
beyond the shadows of my eyes
EMALAITH

Is there a Life Among these Ruins,
the charred remains of all my kind
Stung by the Sword of Retribution,
I swear an oath where they have died
I will return to wreak my Vengeance,
let Heaven grant what love does seek
Alive without a breath, reach for the Thorns ofDeath,
a shadow falls
Before my eyes

EMALAITH dies alone in the night,
lost like a child she leaves me
Scars on the wind to hold me inside,
tomorrow belongs to never
I'll tear the walls of Erebus down.

Child of the Desolation, cry to me under stars that have died,
Under skies of Pain we are born.
Ooh yeah, we are one, forever we'll be
Oh my love, we'll defy Death and meet on Holy Ground.

After the darkest treason I, I will arise again !!!

EMALAITH dies alone in the night,
a kiss on the wind she leaves me
Out in the fields where everything dies,
will we be lost forever?
From death and darkness love was born, and love survived
and created Light.

Behold the Kingdom of the Fearless,
who holds the Seven Points ofNight?
Where is the hope of absolution,
beyond the shadow of my sight?
I hear the Weeping of the Spirits,
dark wings of hatred rule the world
But I will rise again, pierced by the Thorns of Death,
beyond the shadow of their eyes.

EMALAITH'S mine, asoul infinite,
the promise of peace is never
The Secret of Death if ours to possess, ours will endure forever
I see the answer burn in your eyes, across the wasteland,
Death into Life
The mighty Spirits crystalize, TheCrown of Glory,
onward we ride !!!

Beyond the shadows of the skies, waiting for the light, It's
over all is gone, Shadows of Mourning ...
