 MUSIC AND LYRICS BY DAVID DEFEIS 
AGISTHOS:
Father I've avenged thee and my brothers
See him there, his Blood runs Red in the bath
A TOKEN OF MY HATRED, your Feast of Flesh I have avenged
Thirteen children slain, vile, unholy Requiem
Blood from the Skies, the Solemn Rains of Hell
Murder, Divine Retribution, Justice for my Tribe
Black Sands of Time, stained forever
I rejoice at your Death... Now I'll be King...
Watch me take her as you die...
