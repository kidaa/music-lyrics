Music: De Feis/Pursino/Cook, lyrics: De Feis
Don't say that you want love 
As you're walking out my door 
Don't say that you need love 
'Cause I can't love you 
Anymore 
Lay down in rapture
In this crowded town of fear
Hang your head in sharne my dear
You gocca roll alone 

Chorus:
Love's gone 
It's gone away 

Highway in starlite 
You shed your blood upon the sun 
You lock your love 
In bitterness 
And now you're left with noone 
God, I loved you one time
When we walked the world alone
The face that love could not 
Forgive 
The heart will turn to stoneChorus 

... I fell you body writhe 
Like a snake in rny arms 
Wrap yourself around me, baby
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah 

Chorus
