I don't take no for answer
I'm not that kind of guy
There's no point in running away
I'm gonna get you anyhow
I can't let you leave me
Cos I've got too much pride
You better believe me
I'll never let you go

Hell highwater
Can't keep me away
I said hell or highwater
I'm gonna make you anyhow

You've been running for too long
Don't you think that it's time that you stop
Chasing dreams that won't come true
Is that what you're all aboutI can't let you leave me
Cos I've got too much pride
You better believe me
I'll never let you go

Cause Hell or highwater
Can't keep me away
I said hell or highwater
I'm gonna make you anyhow
