Music and lyrics: T. Jackson
Get outta my way!

Everybody got somebody
Try to make ya feel real bad
Ain't noone of their business
Talkin' behind your back
Be strong in your self
Stand up, walk away
Nobody gives a damn
For a single thing you say

Chorus:
You got to
Stay on top- never go under
Lightning strikes- before you hear the thunder
Stay on top- never go under
Hold on tight- here comes that thunder

Hide money in your pockets
Be nobody's fool
Always thinking I'm number one
That's my golden rule
Take care of business
Go for it with the best
Be strong enough to take it
Ain't no need to restBad times make you cry
But the good times make you cry
I can't stand it, I can't stand it, no, no
I can't stand it, I can't stand it no more
I can't stand it, I can't stand it- NO
I can't stand it, no more!

Somebody, everybody,
Try to make ya feel real bad
Ain't nobody's business
Talkin' behind your back
Be strong in yourself
Stand up, walk away
Nobody's gonna listen to single word you say

Stay on top!
