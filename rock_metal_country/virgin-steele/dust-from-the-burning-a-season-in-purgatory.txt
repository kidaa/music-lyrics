ENDYAMON: Back from the World between the Worlds There are no Masters that I
serve From Seven Points of Darkness Shining Heavens's Rays, Across the Ocean
floor What once was hidden now is raised
ENDYAMON to Wrapped in the Holy Mists of Time EMALAITH: My Blood is yours
and yours is mine In Seven lives I've known you It always ends the same In
pieces on the ground Between the Ashes and the Flames
ENDYAMON: DUST FROM THE BURNING - Fire and Water DUST FROM THE BURNING -
Sons and Daughters Slay all in sight, grant no respite The Flame of Justice
guides my hand DUST FROM THE BURNING
DUST FROM THE BURNING - Fire and Water DUST FROM THE BURNING - Sons and
Daughters In the Rising of Our Nation only the Strong Survive
Back from the World between the Worlds There are no Masters that I serve From
Seven Points of Darkness Shining Heavens's Rays, Across the Ocean floor What
once was hidden now is raised
DUST FROM THE BURNING - Fire and Water DUST FROM THE BURNING - Sons and
Daughters Slay all in sight, grant no respite The Blade of Justice guides my
hand
And the Day goes on by Caught up in the grip of their Lie Fire and Water,
Proud Sons and Daughters After we die, after we die, only their Fear Remains
