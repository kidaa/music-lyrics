 LYRICS BY DAVID DEFEIS 
KLYTEMNESTRA:
Iron sounds sear the wound,
hungry screams fill the Air
Kindred Blood, Infant Blood, Child-Flesh for their Feast
Judgement Falls on the Son,
Judgement Falls on the King
Storm of Blood,
Raging free, taste the Blood on my hands

KLYTEMNESTRA & AGISTHOS:
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME-Split the Night
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME in the Sky
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME-Rip the Night
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME in the Sky

KLYTEMNESTRA:
Open Veins, Tear his Heart, Rip the eyes from his head
Under God, under Siege bind their Souls to deceit
Vengeance wrought BY THE GODS, Forged in Sin, Forged by Me
Seer and Whore,
Thunder Lord why should I Weep for Thee

KLYTEMNESTRA & AGISTHOS:
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME-Split the Night
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME in the Sky
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME-Rip the Night
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME in the Sky

KLYTEMNESTRA:
Oh! She'll embrace you in Hades!
Black Cloud of Slavery, oh... Silver sided Death

KLYTEMNESTRA & AGISTHOS:
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME-Split the Night
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME in the Sky
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME-Rip the Night
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME in the Sky
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME-Split the Night
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME in the Sky
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME-Rip the Night
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME in the Sky
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME in the Sky, GREAT SWORD OF FLAME!
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME!!!
