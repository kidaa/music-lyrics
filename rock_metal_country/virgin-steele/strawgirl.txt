Eyes blindly starting skyward, gaze fixed on Eternity
What's that mark upon your shoulder, what's that scar on
your arm?
Did you come to see Jesus, do you walk with God?
Do you rest suspended, or tread the Underworld?

I will speak, for you can't, I will tell your story well
I'll reveal your yesterdays
STRAWGIRL lost in the Savage Garden,
Waiting somewhere for someone to call
STRAWGIRL is there a lover who's searching,
crying, no one to notice
you're gone ...

Cold stone supportws your Beauty, night falls anonymous
Shattered light defies the distance, illuminates your loneliness
Did you bear children, do they miss their ma?
Did the blind mask of forgiveness show a truer face by far?
I will speak, for you can't, I will tell your story well
I'll reveal your yesterdays

STRAWGIRL lost in the Savage Garden,
Waiting somewhere for someone to call
STRAWGIRL is there a lover who's searching,
crying somewhere
or is it just me ...
