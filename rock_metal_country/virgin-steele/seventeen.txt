Music: De Feis/Pursino, lyrics: De Feis
Little Janey's got a crazy walk
Rock and roller, leather vixen talk
She moves so fine
Belladonna with an angel heart
Topless dancer, Paris pearls
She's hot!
Underneath the lights

I wanna feel your body burnin' all night long
I want to taste the magic hidden in your charms
Chorus:
Sweet seventeen- age of consent
Seventeen- age of consent
She's seventeen and tight, ah yeah look outMakin' love under the summer night
Bodies sweating into liquid life
Little girl sighs
Slidin' sweeter down her velvet thighs
Leopard movement, animal surprise
Sweet, sweet cries

Slide on, champagne siren, ah it's only sweeter babe..
