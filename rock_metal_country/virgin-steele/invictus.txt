ENDYAMON: I sing of Power, Magick and Faith A Sonnet of Pure Victory A Hymn
to the Spirits of Freedom and Grace And whichever Gods there may be . . .
Manacled, Beaten, Blackened and Burned Cast from the Light of the Goal I'll
never falter, stumble or kneel Thanks to the strength of my Soul
Lashed by the Winds of Fate Stung by the Gods of Hate I'm Rising in Power, I'm
Rising Unchained Call this a Sacred Vow All that I tell you now I may be
Bloody, but I am unbowed I am Power
Harken the Hour, Season and Day Phantom of Dark Misery Summon your Demons,
Hunger and Hate Spirit of Impurity Ravaged by Fire, stripped and enslaved Torn
from the World that I know I'll never cry out, buckle or kneel I am the King
of my Soul
Stung by the Gods of Wrath Blinded by Circumstance I'm Rising in Power, I'm
Rising Unchained All that I tell you now Sure as a Sacred Vow I may be Bloody,
but I am unbowed
THE GODHEAD: Die, fall on your Sword, fall on your knees Die like your Son
nailed to his tree Die by my Hand, die by my Sword Right on this Site,
Vultures defile
ENDYAMON: Die, fall on your Sword, fall on your knees Die in the Sun nailed
to these trees Die by my Hand, die in my Heart Flung from the Heights, forever
fall
I sing of Power, Magick and Might A Sonnet of Pure Victory A Hymn to the
Fearless, the Savage, the Brave The Spirit of our Liberty Total my debts,
tally my sins, charge each offence on my Scroll I'll never alter the course of
my Steele, I am the King of my Soul
Lashed by the Winds of Fate Stung by the Gods of Hate I'm Rising in Power
through Murdering Rain Stronger than Faith allows Braver than Hero's Vows My
Head is Bloody, but I am unbowed I AM POWER, POWER ! ! ! ! ! ! !
