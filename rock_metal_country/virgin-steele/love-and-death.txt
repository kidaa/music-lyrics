Music: De Feis/Pursino/De Martino, lyrics: De Feis
Offer me your mouth my dear
Let me hold communion with your flesh
Look into my eyes and fear
Follow in the footsteps of the Blest

Come the dawn on judgement day
Will heaven let you in
To walk the ralm of sorrow
Seven deadly sins

Chorus:
Love and death
Love and death
Love and death

Drink the wine of poison fruit
Dance in bitter tears beyond the tomb
Lay with me in pools of blood
Swim the seven seas of rage and ruinAlive for all eternity
To join the Seraphim
To wander in the darkness
For seven deadly sins

Chorus

Pale drenched in moonlight
You're a servant of the damned

Iron wings of ecstasy, a promise in the sand
Time will make you mine
Stolen shades of agony, cut you to the bone
Time will make you mine
Come to dawn on judgement day
Will heaven let you in
To walk the realm of sorrow...
