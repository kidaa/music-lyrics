We are Descendants of the Ancient Ones The Race beyond the Wanderers of Night
Who dwell in the Black Spaces between the Stars From a Time before Time.
Long before this current Dynasty of Heaven We Reigned And will Reign again . .
. For We contain the Divine Essence, Made from the Flesh, Blood and Bone of a
God Who walked in Flesh, and who cut off his own head . . . Nourished by Fire,
Water, Wind, Wrath, Rage and Tears We Blossom at the Root of the Tree of
Knowledge . . .
We wait and We remember . . . , for the Blood of Man, is . . . THE BLOOD OF
VENGEANCE ! ! ! ! ! ! !
