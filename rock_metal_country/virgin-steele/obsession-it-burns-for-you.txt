Music: De Feis/Pursino, lyrics: De Feis
Ooh we've lost our way...
And now the world slips away...
And shadows fall all around...

Ooh do you see the sun it burns for me
Ooh do you know I'll never let you go
Ooh feel the night, it burns, it yearns, it writhes
Ooh hear the screams as secrets come alive

Ooh you are mine, I possess your flesh unkind
A union of power, your love I will devour
Your hunger gnaws, it grips you in it's claws
Like a raving dog you howl and whine for more

Chorus:
Ride the wind tonight, see the angels fall
Ride the wind tonight, see the angels fall
It burns for you,
It burns for you,
It burns for you...
Ooh do you see the skies are here for me
Ooh do you know from whence this hunger grows
Look in my eyes you'll feel the fever rise
Dance on a knife, I might just take your life!Chorus

Ooh do you hear the shouting in your ear
Ooh do you know ignorance does grow
When love turns to hate it's such an evil fate
Oh don't you wait, go the hours late

Chorus
