Music & Lyrics: D. DeFeis
The rose that you gave me 
Just died today 
I guess you won't be comin' back
And the fire in your eyes 
Has grown colder now 
I guess you won't be comin' back

And I think of all the love 
That's come and gone 
Count the miles child 
Our hearts are made of stone 

Chorus:
Oh, I never believed in "Good-Bye"
So, I'll make love to you - 
One more time 
Baby, Let me kiss you tonite
It's gonna be alright - Stop your Cryin'
Oh, I never believed in "Good-Bye" 

I know the nights are longer now 
I see that shadow on the wall 
And I can tell by the air 
It's grown cold again 
Yes, the winter's comin' onAnd I think of all the time 
We've spent apart 
Count the miles, child 
The silence breaks my heart. 
I still want ya 
By my side
Can we keep our love alive? 

Chorus 

... Baby, let met kiss you tonite 
It's gonna be alright 
Oh, I never believed in "Good-Bye"

The rose that you gave me
Just died today 
I guess you won't be comin' back.
