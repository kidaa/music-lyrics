Music and lyrics: De Feis
Under tortured skies from a land with no sun 
I will come for you
From Seven points of Darkness
beyond the mountains and the ruins 
I will come for you 
Across the Fields of Rage and Yearning 
with Power in my hand 
I will return, I will return 

Once we had beauty our Sun blazcd in passion 
We lived alive 
Far from the reaching of closed minded preaching
We lived and died 

Now all in darkness we wait for the end, 
hunted by men of the cloth 
Murder and torture, they rape and they slaughter 
claiming thr Way of the Cross 

Cast out from Eden baptized inta treason 
with sighless eyes 
lost clouds of reason, false hope burning season 
a godless lie whose god is stronger, who's made by its hand 
primitive blood stains the sand 
murder and torture they're raping your daughter 
drunk with the blood of the lamb 

fair child of the desolation cry to me, 
under stars that have died 
under skies of pain we are born 
yea we are born, forever we'll be 
oh my love I'll defy death and meet on holy ground 

repeat verse one 
Now like the sun, like the wind and the rain 
I'll return like a storm, I will rise once again 
'cross the oceans of time I am called by your voice
I'll return, I will return!!
