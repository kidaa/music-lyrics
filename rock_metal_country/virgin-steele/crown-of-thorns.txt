Music: De Feis/Pursino, lyrics: De Feis
The smell of old velvet
Dampness and gloom
Her sweat covered body
Masturbatin' in her room
I know that you wanna believe
That I sinned and I lied
Let the fire console you tonite
It's your turn to cry- cry, babe.

Alone with the memory
Of the way it might've been
Woman it's crazy
Pride was the sin
A thousand year darkness
A season of pain
With one Judas kiss
You're screaming my name

Chorus:
Wastin' your life away
Baby It's a crown of thorns 
You wear
Crown of thorns
...My, my...

Tracks on the carpet
Cracks in the glass
Seven years spent in torment- alone
Shakin' your ass
You walked out on me
Couldn't see...

That I wasn't to blame
Let the lies and the coke and
The Poison
Shoot into your veins...
...Shoot it babe.

Alone with the memory
Of the way it might've been
Woman it's crazy
Pride was the sin
A thousand year darkness
A season of pain
With one Judas kiss
You're screaming my nameChorus

After the face of beauty
Becomes the face of despair
Bound by the flesh of treason
Under the hunting wings
Oh, Lord...

Alone with the memory
Of the way it might have been
You're fuckin' crazy
Pride was your sin
A thousand year darkness
A season of pain
With blood on your lips...
I'm not to blame..

Chorus

Love lies bleeding... love dies...
...When I was dyin' in the cold by
The side of the road
You were lying in a warm embrace
When I was bleedin' in the rain
On an empty street
You were makin' love to someone else...
Shallow and cruel- you were never true..
What'd I ever do to you?
..Oh, I don't need you...
Wear your crown.. fuck off
...Your house is empty- open..
...Open to the wind and rain...
