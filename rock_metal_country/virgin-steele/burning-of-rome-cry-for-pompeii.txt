Music: De Feis/Pursino, lyrics: De Feis
Far from paradise
Where the winds of war
Are blowing freely
In my tired eyes
Run the bloody hosts
Of Ares' slaughter
Face to face- with fear and death and hate
Time to say goodbye- draw your last breath
For I conquer

When I die
In your arms
One child born
To carry on

Darling don't delay
For they're rushing
From a thousand thrones now
Cry another day
When the memory
Brings you back the vision
Tonight I die- but my life is in you
On my way- but I want to touch you, want to love you...

When I die
In your arms
One child born
To carry onChorus:
One nation, one kingdom, one child survives
One nation, one kingdom, one child survives
I'll meet you again through the eyes of our son
Remember to tell him the price we had to pay
And cry for Pompeii- cry for pompeii!

Repeat first strophe
When I die
In your arms
One child born
To carry on

Chorus

I'll meet you again through the eyes of our son
I'll return
Open the gates, I'm coming home tonight
Black tears will fall and the flames will crack the sky
Oh I see you cry...
I'm calling you... open... I'm coming home...
