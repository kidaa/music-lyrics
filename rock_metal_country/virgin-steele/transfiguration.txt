Rain falls, a lost voice calls, the day dies alone
Red blood slowly dripped down, stopped, sighed,
fell to the fround
Mixed with earth and became mud black blood
Rain from Heaven fills the seas of Hell

Cold rain runs from the sky
Blood is the secret, the bond between lives
Cold reign drowning the world, till the word was made flesh
Lips red, to alter led, with heart light, eyes bright
Now heart dead, eyes closed to bier led, lips white
Mixed with earth and became mud black blood
Rest in darkness, till we rise again

Cold rain runs from the sky
Death is a secret a fate between lives
Cold reign, timeless it falls, till the world is made whole

fallin' fallin' over me drowning in the cold rain
