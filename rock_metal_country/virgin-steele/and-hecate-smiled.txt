 MUSIC AND LYRICS BY DAVID DEFEIS 
ELDERS:
Bride of Lawless lies sent Ten Thousand Men to Die
Prophecies un-met still cry
Cold we understand Blood and Fear still walk the Land
Looking for the Scars we hide from ourselves

I see the Fire spreading, I see the Towers Burn
I hear the Voices calling, I see the King's return
Did they Die for God and Glory, Drowned in Mist, cast from the Light
Trapped inside the Line of Fire, Vale of Tears, Passage of Shame
On this Day of Doom!
