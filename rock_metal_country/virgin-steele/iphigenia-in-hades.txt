 MUSIC AND LYRICS BY DAVID DEFEIS 
KLYTEMNESTRA:
One Child cries in the Depths of Hades
Baring her breast for her Father to see
There will be Love under the soil
One child cries to Eternity's Sky
Bound on the Altar the Winds Sacrifice
Merciless eyes, cruel faces smile

One child forced through the Dark Halls of Stone
Greeting her Father with Blood on her lips
Knowing he'll stay under the soil... Revenge
AHHH
And now this shall pass for my Judgement...
