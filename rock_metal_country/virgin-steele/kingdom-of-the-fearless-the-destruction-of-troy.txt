 MUSIC & LYRICS BY DAVID DEFEIS 
AGAMEMNON:
No Country, no Law, no Religion, no more
No God, no Light, no Power, this Night
Lord Priam you stand Horizons once Grand
I Slay, I Crush your Towers to Dust
Broken under Lash and Sword, on the Black Horizon Shine your Graves

KINGDOM OF THE FEARLESS-Kingdom of Gods
Light up the Sky, Light up the World as we run
KINGDOM OF THE FEARLESS-Kingdom of Gods
Light up the Sky, Burning the World as we run

Great Violence withstands the Blood commands
The Angel of Death, Black Wings caress
Your Kingdom of Lies, Immortal Youth dies
A Lion of Ruin, a Whirlwind of Doom
Broken under Lash and Sword, on this Dark Horizon Shine your Graves

KINGDOM OF THE FEARLESS-Kingdom of Gods
Light up the Sky, Light up the World as we run
KINGDOM OF THE FEARLESS-Kingdom of Gods
Light up the Sky, Burning the World as we

Ride down the Centuries into the Sun
Cursing the Dark, cursing the Light
Bronze wielding Sons of War, Fame Forged in Fear
I will be there, I will not cower
Flames of Violence soothe the Breast of Honour Burned
Into the Valley, into the Valley we cry again!!!

Die... to Kill... Your Daughter's now mine
Your're Flesh for the worms
In Bondage you weep/my Hatred will never die
Cry... the Blood Burns Black... in Fury
I will Fear no Man, for I am a God!!!


No Country, no Law, no Religion, for sure!
No Life, no Faith, no Quarter, Death waits
Lost Season in Shame, your People in Chains
For Honour, for Zeus, for Xenia, for Truth
To the Underworld advance, or the Dark Ships waiting
Cry your last!

KINGDOM OF THE FEARLESS-Kingdom of Gods
Light up the Sky, Light up the World as we run
KINGDOM OF THE FEARLESS-KINGDOM OF GODS
Light up the Sky, Light up the World as we
Ride like Thunder down from the Plains
Over the Mountains Bronze Shield and Flame
None can withstand Hatred Un-Masked
In Blood shall pay!!!

I kill you all... die, by the Blood of the Gods
By the Blood on my Sword... you sleep in Hell
DIE, DIE, DIE!!!!!!!
