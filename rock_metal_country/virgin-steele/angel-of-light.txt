Music and lyrics: De Feis
Hurling down with thunder from on high
An ancient evil steals across the sky
Flaming power, death is in his wake
The lord of hell returns to rend and rape

Watch the lights as they devour you
A blazing presence rips you through and through
Blinded by such beauty, caught to unaware
You're stripped and burning
In his fiery stare

Howling furies shrieking backwards lies
Phantom armies summoned by their cries
Nothing equals this astounding sight
of the Beast unveiled in this unholy light

Watch the lights as they devour you
A blazing presence rips you through and through
Blinded by such beauty, caught so unaware
You're stripped down and burning in his fiery stare

Angel of light descends on the Earth
To chanllenge the might of the Son
The Angel of light descends on the Earth
To take back the crown from the one"No mercy doth the Dragon bring
Harken now his beating wings
Fire dances on the air
The seventh serpent leaves his lair
Invoking all the hounds of Hades
The shrouded angels meet his gaze
Spouting flames upon the wise
The legions steal into the skies"
....to fly, to fly...

Crushing, burning, locked in wars embrace
The desolate one meets with his fiery fate
His armies smitten by the sword of Him
Our Lord of Lords, the holy King of Kings

No more fear of phantoms of the night
Rejoice in the city of unending light
No more tears or dying, on his throne he's shining
Raise the chalice for eternity

Angel of light descends on the Earth
And dies by the roar of the Lamb
The Angel of light descends on the Earth
And is crushed by the might of the Lamb
