 MUSIC BY DAVID DEFEIS & EDWARD PURSINO * LYRICS BY DAVID DEFEIS 
AGAMEMNON:
I return to the Land of my birth and I Thank the Gods Belief
With Golden Songs and Sacred Vows
Through Eons Forge the Millennium,
how the Spear Faction Blazed
I released the Titan's Pain at last
BY THE FLAMES OF THE BLACK STAR!

On this Mountain peak where we live,
I resume my Rule decreed
By Zeus and Father handed down
The Victory now here is mine,
Judgements price for shameless theft
Exacted and Immortalized...
BY THE FLAMES OF THE BLACK STAR
BY THE STRENGTH OF HERAKLES ARMS

KLYTEMNESTRA:
FLAMES OF THE BLACK STAR Burn in Hades
FLAMES OF THE BLACK STAR-Shine tonight
FLAMES OF THE BLACK STAR-Kill with Fire
FLAMES OF THE BLACK STAR-Shine...
to the Edge of the World

ATHENA:
The Hammer of Zeus splits the Sky, cracks the Dark in two
Is there one among you who can see the Truth
In the Distance Black Rivers flow
A Final Warning spoken from the Tomb
You live by the Violence and the Soul of the Sun
Time has no meaning when the Slaughters begun

KLYTEMNESTRA:
Rising up in Power, Rage is on my side
Brazen Gift of Ancient Madness
The Eyes of the World are fastened today
The Gods are not blind, they will be consoled
An Ocean of Grieving can never return
You're never forgiven, your Destiny's earned
The Darkness within is taking my hand
You're never forgiven, struck in the Eyes of the World
Binding your Soul to Hades, FLAMES OF THE BLACK STAR!

ATHENA:
You live by the Violence and the Soul of the Sun
They'll be no Tomorrow when the End has Begun
The Eyes of the World are Bleeding Today
The Crimes of Tomorrow are born here in pain

KLYTEMNESTRA:
If Terror is scheming, your Freedom is Burned
You're never forgiven, your Destiny's earned

ATHENA:
The Edge of the World awaits, Silent and Proud are the Will
Sowing the Seeds of Violence

KLYTEMNESTRA:
FLAMES OF THE BLACK STAR Burn in Hades
FLAMES OF THE BLACK STAR-Shine tonight
FLAMES OF THE BLACK STAR-Kill with Fire
FLAMES OF THE BLACK STAR-Blind Blind Blind
FLAMES OF THE BLACK STAR-Shine in my Soul
FLAMES OF THE BLACK STAR-Shine in my Soul
