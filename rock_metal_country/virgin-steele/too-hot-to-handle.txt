Music: De Feis/Pursino, lyrics: De Feis 
C'mon get naked 

I love ya, babe 

Open up your eyes 
And let your love out 
Open up your heart 
I'm comin' round now 

Oooh, give it all you got 
Love you 'til the mornin' child
I won't ever leave ya 
Shake it on top 
Wild on the killing floor
I know how to please ya 
And your world is comin' down
Love that one-track-mind 
Get it on - on - on... 

Chorus:
Too HOT to handle 
Ready for the nite time comin' 
She's an angel of mercy 
Too HOT to handle 
Ready for the nite time comin'
She's a run-away child Like a savage flower
Forbidden style 
You got the look of freedom
And it makes you wild 

Repeat Pre-Chorus 

'She walks the nite on violent 
whispers, 
Ravishing the moon-drunk cities
Passion and restraint are at war 
Within me. 
If I can't posses your body tonite
I'll go insane, child. 
Bare beauty on an unmade bed... 
Cirl, show your love' 

Chorus
