 MUSIC AND LYRICS BY DAVID DEFEIS 
KASSANDRA:
Children forlorn, victims of the Daimon within
Oaths made in Violence, punishment in turn
There is no Light to guide me on my long and painful Road
I wait in Silence, I wait for Death with the last of this Day's Sun...

Broken Wings, Blood freed upon the air
A Trampled Marriage Bed
The Father sees, his Gods cry out, the Flesh spills down
And Judgement Kills the Crime

Gods of the Dead bring me my Life back again
I'm fallin', I'm callin'
Gods of the Dead don't let me die unavenged
I'm fallin', I'm callin'
I won't be here to see them Mourning... Enter the Night...

Emblems of Prophecy, I throw them all away
Drink the Fire of the Pitiless God...
When the Blood of Death has fallen, who can call it back
To the Form that it once held

Gods of the Dead bring me my Life back again
I'm fallin', I'm callin'
Gods of the Dead don't let me die unavenged
I'm fallin', I'm callin'
And the Dead will taste a deeper Treasure than Youth or Life

Bury me beside the Endless Sea, raise my Ashes to the Wind
Remember me when Falls another Life, Quench my Funeral Pyre with Wine ...
