Music and lyrics: De Feis
Another night on the Highway, smell of hate in the air 
Another Season of knowing that there's nobody there 
so you race down the runway, leaving hope on the rails 
with a spike in your memory and the marks of the nails 

Chorus:
Gold and silver shed a light that's blinding hot and cold 
you're bleeding, you're bleeding 
red and flowing like a wine for crying young or old 
like blood and gasoline

As you rust in the mirror, as your face starts to go
you can count every mile on your barren soul 
in the scream of the engine, sing your final song 
blackened and burned what was young and strong 

Chorus

Faster and faster a nightmare we ride
who'll take the reins when the miracle dies 
faster and faster till everything dies 
killing is our way of keeping alive 

Another night on the Highway, Blood and Dust in the air 
New disease or addiction that brings that hip Death Stare
In the media madness where they proclaim you a King 
First they crown and annoint you 
then makc you dance on a string
