You better take time and listen to what I say
We're giving you fair warning cos we've got something to say
Hand to hand, face to face
We'll meet you on stage anytime, anyplace

We want to take you to the time of your life
We wanna show you all that we got
Are you ready cos we're leaving tonight?
Our destination is Metal City!

We used to be nice but times got tough don't you know
We paid some dues got burned a few, now we want action
Blow by blow, axe by axe
When we come to your town, you now we're gonna kick ass

We want to take you to the time of your life
We wanna show you all that we got
Are you ready cos we're leaving tonight?
Our destination is Metal City!
