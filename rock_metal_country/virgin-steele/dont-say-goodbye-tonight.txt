There's danger, charging the air tonight
A feeling of hopeless despair
Oh my love it's not the first time
I've felt the tremors of hate

Jealousy is on the rise
I can see the snake in your eyes
The time has come for us to aim for the heart

I'm begging you
Don't say goodbye tonight love
Don't say goodbye to my love
Don't say goodbye I need you to stayLost, gone in an instant
An angry word, then the crash of the door
Oh, it's too late you're lost to the nightwind
The black sky cries out your name

And it seems like it's happened before
And it's bound to a thousand times more
When will we ever learn, learn how to love?
