The mark of war is upon me the taste of blood's on my tongue
I'm the ruler of nations, I am second to none
Like a rainbow on fire, my axe gleams in the sun
Blinding my enenies when the battles begun

They'll see us fly on wings of glory, for the twilight hour's come
Here we ride on wings of fire, staring straight into the sun

The dark host marches eternal it's the last Great War
Spreading scenes of destruction unequaled before
Threre will be no winner, all are destined to die
And from the ashes a new world a vision of Light

Wath us fly on wings of glory, for the twilight hour's come
Here we ride on wings of fire, for the judgement of the Gods

A circle of fire Loki sings
A chorus of lies, the crownless King
Who rides on the wind, who rides on the sky?
Be gone

A circle of fire loud we sing
The Warhammer rides, the crownless King
Who writes on the wind the whisper of Life

Watch us fly on wings of glory, for the twilight hour's come
Here we ride on wings of fire, for the judgement of the Gods
