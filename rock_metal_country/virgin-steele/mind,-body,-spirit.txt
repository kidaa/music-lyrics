ENDYAMON: On the Bridge of Hades, searching for a Sign On the brink of
Knowledge, there's no time Shadow of the Horseman who is sworn to rise Seven
are now waiting in the Skies Warring Angels forage, Scavengers of Pain I am
born to Power, Courage is my Name
HUMANITY: Rise on the Wings of Truth, to the Sun We know that Forever lives
inside . . . MIND, BODY, SPIRIT . . . All are One
ENDYAMON: Rising like a Tower, Fortune's Torch revives Slicing every Rule
that will divide Who will hold the Red Queen when misfortune cries Seven Bands
are waiting in the Sky
Murder and Fire and Pain is the Sign Swollen with Power your Blood is my Wine
And I know !
HUMANITY: Rise on the Wings of Doom, to the Sun We know that Forever lives
inside . . . MIND, BODY, SPIRIT . . . All are One
MIND, BODY, SPIRIT . . . All are One ! ! !
ENDYAMON: Prizing only Valor Numen steal the Light On the brink of Knowledge
Burning Bright Shadow of the Horseman who is sworn to rise Sin and Death are
waiting in the Skies Murder and Fire and Pain is the Sign Swollen with Power
your Blood is my Wine And I know !
HUMANITY: Rise on the Wings of Death, to the Sun We know that Forever lives
inside . . .
ENDYAMON: I see my Vision, I see the Line Circling onward, looking for Nine
I know the answer is not to be found Searching in Darkness with eyes of the
blind And in the Morning, Two will remain To carry us onward, to Guard the
Flame That we know . . . There'll be time . . . for All . . , for All We don't
need you, we're fine on our own We don't want you, leave us alone . . .
Fortune is Fire as Numen we Shine Invoking the Power, your Blood is my Wine
and I know . . . The Mind is a Tower, the Body sublime The Soul is the Power,
your Blood is my Wine and I know . . . Leave us alone ! ! !
