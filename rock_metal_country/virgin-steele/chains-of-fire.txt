Music: De Feis/Pursino, lyrics: De Deis
Eyes of fire, lips of scarlet flame
Woman of darkness and heat you can't be tamed
Everything you do just turns me on
Fatal beauty- innocence
Locked in Ecstasy..

Chains of fire
Chains of fire

I can't get enough of your sweet charms
Drunk on love you tremble in my arms
A heated look of sensuality
Taste of heaven on your skin
Burn in love with me...Chorus:
Chains of fire- I'm a prisoner of desire woman
Chains of fire- the night's alive, the dark is burning
Chains of fire- we're bound by love my wanton child
Chains of fire- burn in love with me
Chains of fire, chains of fire

Let me feel, all your warmth child
Let me in babe, oh...
Chains of fire!!
