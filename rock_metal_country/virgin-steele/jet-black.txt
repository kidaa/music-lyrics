Music: De Feis/Pursino, lyrics: De Feis
Naked as an angel
Stone love eye to eye
Six gun singing' stranger
Dust raised, born to die
Funeral train comin'
In the hours of the damned
Lock your daughters weeping
Keep'em from this voodoo man

Chorus:
Jet Black- black as the river flown
Black as my heart on a night of love
Jet Black- under the burning sky

Black is the love the we used to share

Hidin' on the outside
The kill completes the chase
Sidewalk screamin' rat race
Ev'ry fuckin' day
Runnin' from the wreckage
Of this burned out paradise
Our love becomes a weapon
My eyes reflect the night

Chorus 
Black is the space between the stars...Oh, you got it right now
Blood and gasoline
Crucify my spirit
Don't gimme your prayers

Watch her walk... see the silence
Watch the venom drip...
...Drip from her legs
Like diamonds.. like wine
Cool child... let it go...

Chorus
She's got the eyes I wanna roll
Jet Black- you got my heart
You got my soul- I wanna love
Jet Black- black as the night

Black is the way..
The world will end.
