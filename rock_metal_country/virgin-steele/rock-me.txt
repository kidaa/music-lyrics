Music: De Feis/Pursino, lyrics: De Feis
Chorus:
I know you wanna rock me
I know you wanna scream

You're standing there
You're an angel of desire
With your blonde hair
And your pouting hungry eyes
Hey, you're not shy
You're ready for some action
Sweet little nymph
There's fire in your eyes

Chorus

Tonight I'm yours
Come take me if you want me
I'll do anything
To keep you satisfied
Keep licking your lips
And opens your arms wider
Black leather angel
Princess of the nightChorus

Can ya feel my love
Does it make your body quiver
I'm gonna love you better
Than anybody did before
Right now! So good
The night was made for love
Ohh sweet babe, we're gonna make love all
Tonight
Make love all night tonight

Chorus
