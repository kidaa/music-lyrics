Music and lyrics: De Feis
Gunfire up in heaven no religion here 
raping your salvation, the last sound that you'll hear 
the snap of the noose the crack of the whip 
the hangman's face is torn 
in shameless crucifixion a savage nation's born 

Behold the new messiah, arising from the wound 
in rags of execution freedom is consumned 

You are a rose you are a blade 
I'm down on my knees in the dark in the fiery reign 
life among the ruins 

I've lived among the ruins walked among the dead 
loved among the wreckage beneath a flag of red 
communion of blood so bitter the cup 
a union born of fear 
creation and perdition a world within a tear

Behold the new messiah, arising from his bed 
holier in silence, paler than the dead 

Chorus

Chorus/with - I challenge you to love my bride of pain 

With the dying sun of autumn bathing us in gold 
we walk the desolation hand in hand against the cold 
while rampant runs the reaper all thru the barren plains 
with sycthe in hand he reaches to harvest the last remains 
in agony you stumble with a curse upon your lips you die 
I can't feel you anymore 
vengeance is mine! 

Chorus 2x/with - bare your breast and save this child of pain
life among the ruins
