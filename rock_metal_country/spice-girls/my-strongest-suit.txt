Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere, ooh 
Now I believe in looking like my time on earth is cooking 
With polka-dotted stripes or even checks 
With some glamour guaranteeing 
every fiber of my being Is displayed to quite remarkable effects 
From your cradle via trousseau to your death bed you're on view so 
Never compromise accept no substitute 
I would rather wear a barrel than conservative apparel
Because a dress has always been my strongest suit 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere, ooh 
Staying in or hitting townwards, from the top and working downwards 
I ensure that every stitch is stitched in time 
Whether wig or hat or turban whether clog, boudoir or urban 
Not to strut your stuff outrageously's a crime 
And the few who are invited to my wardrobe are delighted 
As they wander through my things to find a route 
That in negligee or formal I am anything but normal 
Because a dress has always been my strongest suit 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere, ooh 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere, ooh 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere, ooh 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere, ooh 
Now you don't need a recital of the reasons why its vital 
That tonight my droppings will not be subdued 
That from coronet to sandal no one else is worth a candle 
That I couldn't make more impact in the nude 
So bring me out my finest, most audacious, my divinest 
Most revealing, most expensive and to boot 
Most arresting, most heart-stopping, most free-flowing, most eye-popping 
Because a dress has always been my strongest suit 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere, ooh 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere, ooh 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere, ooh 
A dress has always been! 
A dress has always been! 
Strongest Suit!
