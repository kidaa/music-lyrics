This is definitely my most favourite time of the year,
Oh yeah mine too, yes, I think it is
It is mine yeah, 
I reckon Christmas is all right, cause like the football season is still on. 
And you can watch football on Boxing Day when everyone is being really 
boring and, you're fed up of your presents.
Listen right you can do whatever you want at Christmas as long as it's good, man 
Well what I say this Christmas is just do what you want, 
But make sure you do it like a lady!
If you can't be good, be careful 
And make sure you get all your pressies off Santa!


Just hear those sleigh bells jing-a-ling-ring-ting-a-ding-a-ling-ding, 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you, 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling you, 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you, 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy, and cozy are we, 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Let's snuggle up together like birds of a feather would be,
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two,
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you,
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 


Remember to go to sleep on Christmas Eve otherwise Santa... 
Or stay up the whole night, 
No! You can't do that 'cause Father Christmas won't come then,
You've gotta go to sleep
Father Christmas doesn't exist now!
Sssssshhhhhh! 
He does Vicki what are you talking about, Vicki that's terrible to say. 
We know cause we went to Lapland and we saw him, 
I know you might not get what you want but you're gonna get a hit in the
face if you don't shut up! 
If not you'll get a bag of soot 


Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy, and cozy are we,

Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you, 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding
