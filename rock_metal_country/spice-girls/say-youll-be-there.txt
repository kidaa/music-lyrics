Say you'll be there
I'm giving you everything, all that joy can bring, this I swear

Last time that we had this conversation, I decided we should be friends
Hey, but now, we're going round in circles, tell me, will this  quot;dj vu quot; never end
Now, you tell me that you've fallen in love, well I never ever thought that would be
Ey, this time, you gotta take it easy throwing far too much emotions at me
But any fool can see they're falling, I gotta make you understand

CHORUS:
I'm giving you everything, all that joy can bring, this I swear
And all that I want from you is a promise you will be there

Say you will be there, yeah.

Ow, say you will be there
Won't you sing it with me

If you put two and two together, you will see what our friendship is for
If you can't work this equation, then I guess I'll have to show you the door
There is no need to say you love me, it would be better left unsaid

CHORUS

Yeah, I want you

INSTRUMENTAL BRIDGE

Any fool can see they're falling, I gotta make you understand

I'll give you everything on this I swear, just promise you'll always be there

CHORUS
repeat and fade out
