She used to be my only enemy and never let me be free
Catching me in places that I knew I shouldn't be
Every other day, I crossed the line, I didn't mean to be so bad
I never thought you would become the friend I never had

Back then, I didn't know why, why you were misunderstood
So now, I see through your eyes, all that you did was love
Mama, I love you, Mama, I care,
Mama, I love you, Mama, my friend
My friend

I didn't want to hear it then but I'm not ashamed to say it now,
Every little thing you said and did was right for me
I had a lot of time to think about, about the way I used to be
Never had a sense of my responsibility

Back then, I didn't know why, why you were misunderstood
So now, I see through your eyes, all that you did was love
Mama, I love you, Mama, I care,
Mama, I love you, Mama, my friend
My friend, you're my friend

But now, I'm sure I know why, why you were misunderstood
So now, I see through your eyes, all I can give you is love
Mama, I love you, Mama, I care,
Mama, I love you, Mama, my friend

Mama, I love you, Mama, I care,
Mama, I love you, Mama, my friend
You're my friend, you're my friend

Whoa whoa whoa whoa, Mama whoa whoa

Mama, I love you, Mama, I care,
Mama, I love you, Mama, my friend
repeat and fade out
