Do you still remember, how we used to be
Feeling together, believing whatever
My love has said to me
Both of us were dreamers
Young love in the sun
Felt like my saviour, my spirit I gave you
We'd only just begun
Hasta Manana, always be mine

Viva forever, I'll be waiting
Everlasting, like the sun
Live forever, for the moment
Ever searching for the one

Yes I still remember, every whispered word 
The touch of your skin, giving life from within harmony
Like a love song that I'd heard harmony
Slippin' through our fingers, like the sands of time
Promises made, every memory saved harmony
As reflections in my mind harmony

Hasta Manana, always be mine Mel B   Mel C

Viva forever, I'll be waiting
Everlasting, like the sun
Live forever, for the moment
Ever searching for the one

ahhhhh

Back where I belong now, was it just a dream
Feelings unfold, they will never be sold harmony
And the secret's safe with me harmony

Hasta Manana, always be mine Mel B   Mel C

Viva forever viva forever, I'll be waiting I'll be waiting
Everlasting everlasting, like the sun like the sun
Live forever live forever, for the moment for the moment
Ever searching ever searching for the one for the one

Viva forever viva forever, I'll be waiting
Everlasting, like the sun
Live forever live forever, for the moment
Ever searching for the one

Viva forever viva forever, I'll be waiting 
Everlasting, like the sun
Live forever live forever, for the moment
Ever searching for the one for the one

Viva forever, I'll be waiting I'll be waiting
Everlasting, like the sun
Live forever live forever, for the moment
Ever searching for the one
