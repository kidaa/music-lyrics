Do you 
Do you think about me 
Do you 
Do you think about me 

Do you think about me 
Do you think about me 
Like I think about you 
Like I think about you 

Do you sometimes 
Stay awake at night 
Do you 
Till the morning light 
Do you 
Cause you don't know what to do 
Do you think about me 

Do you think about me 
Do you think about me 
Like I think about you 
Like I think about you 

And do you talk about me 
oh baby, baby, baby 
Cause I talk about you 
ey hey, eh hey 
Of the passion we once knew 
Do you think about me
