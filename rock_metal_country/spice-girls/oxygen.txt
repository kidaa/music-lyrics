There will come a time 
I know I'm gonna need 
Someone I can trust, someone who'll fight for me 
That's the way I love 

This is my time to work things out 
What I want from this life 
There will be someone out there for me 
That's the way I love 

It doesn't really matter whoever you are 
Don't matter where you go 
Just make sure you're there to answer when love comes around 
Don't be surprised when love knocks at your door 

You're the breath that I take 
You're the smile on my face 
Every time I breath in 
Brings me warmth from within 
When you touch me I start believing 
Loving is like oxygen 

Even when we're so far apart 
I still feel you in my heart 
Cos you've given me the greatest gift of all 
That's the way I love 

The way I love is easy, but could it ever be for me? 
This situation seems so insane 
It's all about feeling without insecurities 
That's the way I love 

It doesn't really matter who ever you are 
Don't matter where you go 
Just make sure you're there to answer when love comes around 
Don't be surprised when love knocks at your door 

You're the breath that I take 
You're the smile on my face 
Every time I breath in 
Brings me warmth from within 
When you touch me I start believing 
Loving is like oxygen 
You're in every breath I take 

Imagine a life without love 
I'd be so afraid so afraid 
Cos the love that we share 
Would be hard to replace 
Baby hold me and never leave me 
This love is my oxygen 
This love is my oxygen 

Open your heart 
Take a deep breath 
Stop searching and start believing 
Make sure you're there to answer when love comes around 
Don't be surprised when true love knocks at your door 

You're the breath that I take 
You're the smile on my face 
Every time I breath in 
Brings me warmth from within 
When you touch me I start believing 
Loving is like oxygen 
You're in every breath I take 

Imagine a life without love 
I'd be so afraid 
Cos the love that we share 
Would be hard to replace 
Baby hold me and never leave me 
This love is my oxygen 
This love is my oxygen
