Now there was a time
when we used to say
that behind every great man
there has to be a great woman. 

Well, in these times of change
you know that it is no longer true.
So we're coming out of the kitchen
'cause theres something we forgot to say to you.


We know sisters are doing it for themselves.
Standing on their own two feet,
Ringing on their own bells. 

Sisters are doing it for themselves. 

Now this is a song to celebrate
the conscious liberation of the female state.
Mother daughters and their daughters too will know
Woman to woman we'll sing it with you.
Now the inferior sex has got a new exterior.
We've got doctors, lawyers politicians too
Oh yeah
Everybody take a look around.
Can you see, can you see, can you see? 

Theres a woman right next to you.
Whoa yeah!
Sisters are doing it for themselves.
Standing on their own two feet.
Ringing on their own bells
Sisters are doing it for themselves 

We ain't makin stories
No we ain't makin plans 

Don't you know that a man 
still loves a woman 
and a woman still loves a man

Now there was a time there was a time

Sisters are doing it for themselves
Standing on their own two feet.
Ringing on their own bells
Sisters are doing it for themselves
Sisters are doing it for themselves
We're doing it, doing it, doing it, doing it
Sisters are doign it for themselves
All of my sisters, all of my sisters
Sisters are doing it for themselves
