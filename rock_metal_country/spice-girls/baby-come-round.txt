Baby come round and remember how it started up 
Cause no one wants to be a one-hit wonder 
Why can't we work it out? Who called who? I before you? 
Who made the move? You know it takes two 
Bumping into you was it all down to me? 
Time for you to come around 
So baby come round, come round, come round 
To my way of loving, oh oh oh 
So baby come round, come round, come round 
To my way of loving, oh oh oh 
Butterflies have passed us by, Gotta get the feeling back 
Taking each other for granted, I know that we can work it out 
I wind you up like a brand new toy, I've had enough, I'm overwound 
Got to give it up, I know your game 
Time for you to come around 
So baby come round, come round, come round 
To my way of loving, oh oh oh 
So baby come round, come round, come round 
To my way of loving, oh oh 
Baby come round, baby come round, 
Baby come round, baby come round oh oh oh 
Baby come round, baby come round 
Come round, come round to my way of loving 
So baby come round, I'll show you what you're missing 
Now or never, I won't hang around forever 
I'll be flying by the seat of my pants you see I've got 
Better thing to do than waste my time looking for you 
It's like this, I'll take you nice and slow 
Unless you don't wanna know, then maybe I'll just let you go 
It takes to get it on and I'll come round and baby 
So baby come round, come round, come round 
To my way of loving, oh oh oh 
So baby come round, come round, come round 
To my way of loving, oh oh 
So baby come round, come round, come round da da da da da da da da 
To my way, to my way da da da da da da da da 
So baby come round, come round, come round da da da da da da da da 
Come round, oh oh oh da da da da da da da da 
REPEAT TO END
