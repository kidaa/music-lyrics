We've got something kinda funny goin' on,
We've got something kinda funny goin' on. 

Wherever you're going, high or low
, Remember to sure enjoy the show,
So climb aboard my journey deep inside,
Better late than dead on time,
Ooh, it's you I know I have got to feed,
Ooh, don't take from me more than you really need,

More than you really need, 

We've got something kinda funny goin' on, 
We've got something kinda funny goin' on. 

Happiness is just a state of your mind,
Keep searching who knows what you may find,
Rules are for fools, and fool's paradise is hard to find,
Play my game or get left behind,
It's you I know that I have got to feed,
Take from me what you feel that you need,
You feel that you need. 

We've got something kinda funny goin' on, 
We've got something kinda funny goin' on. 

You've got it... 
You've got it... 
You've got it... 

Feelin' kinda funny, when I'm with you honey,
Feelin' kinda queezy I ain't that easy.
We've got something kinda funny . . .
