I wanna make you holler
Imagine us together
Don't be afraid to play my game

Boy, don't you hesitate, I won't keep waiting for you
To come and let me take you to my fantasy room
You're gonna like it there and all the things that I do
I'll treat you right all through the night

We can do anything
I'll take you all the places you wanna be
I'll be your fantasy
Everything you want, you will find in me
If you play my game

CHORUS:
I wanna make you holler and hear you scream my name
I'll give you rules to follow so you can play my game
Imagine us together, me driving you insane
You will give in to me, don't be afraid to play my game

So what you gonna do now that I got you with me
You gotta show me, boy, 'cause nothing comes for free
Start from the bottom and work your way up slowly
Don't be afraid to play my game

We can go all night long
Doing things you thought you would never do
I won't tell anyone
What we do, it's just for me and you
So come and play my game

CHORUS 2x

I wanna make you holler
I wanna make you holler, ah ah ah, holler
I wanna make you holler
I wanna make you holler, ah ah ah, holler

We can go all night long
Doing things you thought you would never do
I won't tell anyone
'Cause everything is just between me and you
But you gotta play my game

CHORUS 3x

I wanna make you holler
I'll give you rules to follow
Imagine us together, me driving you insane
You will give in to me
fade out
