There's no place I call height aaah 
There's no mainstream aaah 
There's no happy medium aaah 
There's no in between aaah 
So do your searching, until you're down aaah 
Then realize, you're on home ground aaah 

Sitting' in a white room dreaming of a life 
You have got me thinking, what is paradise? 

Should I take an ocean drive 
Cooling from the sun 
Silver screen got me thinking 
This is how it should be done 

Take me home aaah 
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah aaah 
Take me home aaah 
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah aaah 

Stand together alone, not knowing who you are 
Friendly strangely, strangely friendly 
Would you keep me warm? 

Would you keep me warm? 
You know, you can be your paradise 
A heart to keep me warm 
You can have your own dream life 
Step into your comfort zone 
Comfort zone 

Take me home aaah 
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah aaah 
Take me home aaah 
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah aaah 

Ain*t nobody to take me home 
cause I'm here, yes where I belong 
I'm on leave cause I'm on my way, but my home 
It will always stay [spoken] 

Ain't nobody to take me home 
cause I'm here, yes where I belong 
I'm on leave cause I'm on my way, but my home 
It will always stay [spoken] 

Ain't nobody to take me home 
Cause I'm here, yes where I belong 
I'm on leave cause I'm on my way, but my home 
It will always stay 

So it's all just free falling falls 
Huh, out of time 
You've got yours, I've got mine 
Should all this be so precious 
Maybe I should be a little humble 
Slate to fear, cause I could stumble 
So do your searching until you're down 
Cause you're on home ground 

Take me home aaah 
take, take, take, take me home, take, take take me home 
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah aaah 
Take me home, aaah 
take, take, take, take me home, take, take take me home 
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah aaah
