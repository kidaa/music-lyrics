I'll beep my horn for you 
bumper to bumper
Give way I'm comin' through
I'll beep my horn for you
bumper to bumper
Give way I'm comin' through 

Driving through the city, 
dirty, nitty gritty,
looking for a place to go
Girls are feeling risky,
feelin' kinda frisky,
come on baby let me know 

Pull over, pull over, 
you're driving me reckless
Over the limit,
alright you're gonna get this 

Bumper to bumper, bumper to bumper 
I want to drive your body, all night 
I want a back seat lover, all right 

You know that,
I'll beep my heart for you 
bumper to bumper
Give way I'm coming through
bumper to bumper
I'll beep my heart for you
bumper to bumper
Can't take my eyes off you
bumper to bumper 

Looking but not stoppin', 
only window shoppin', 
less you've got some goods to show
Don't tell us that were dirty, 
only being flirty
Tops off and down and here we go 

Pull over, pull over, 
you're driving me reckless
Over the limit,
alright you're gonna get this 

Bumper to bumper, bumper to bumper
I want to drive your body all night 
I want a back seat lover, all right 

You know that
I'll beep my heart for you 
bumper to bumper
Give way I'm comin' through
bumper to bumper
I'll beep my heart for you
bumper to bumper
Can't take my eyes off you 
bumper to bumper 

Lazy hazy summer days
bump, bump 
Lazy hazy summer days
Lazy hazy summer days
bumper to bumper 

Driving into the sunshine, driving into the sunshine 
lazy hazy summer days, lazy hazy summer days
lazy hazy summer days, lazy hazy summer days
Driving into the sunshine, driving into the sunshine
Driving into the sunshine ahhhh 

You know that
I'll beep my heart for you 
bumper to bumper
Give way I'm coming through
bumper to bumper
I'll beep my heart for you 
bumper to bumper
Can't take my eyes off you
bumper to bumper
repeat
