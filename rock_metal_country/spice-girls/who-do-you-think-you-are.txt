The race is on to get out of the bottom,
The top is high so your roots are forgotten
Giving is good as long as you're getting
What's driving you it's ambition and betting
I said who do you think you are
Ooh-ooh-ooh, some kind of superstar
You have got to swing it, shake it, move it, make it,
Who do you think you are
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it,
Show me how good you are
Swing it, shake it, move it, make it,
Who do you think you are
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it,
Show how good you are.

You're swelling out in the wrong direction,
You've got the bug, superstar you've been bitten,
Your trumpet's blowing for far too long,
Climbing the snake of the ladder, but you're wrong
Who do you think you are
Ooh-ooh-ooh, some kind of superstar
You have got to swing it, shake it, move it, make it,
Who do you think you are
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it,
Show me how good you are
Swing it, shake it, move it, make it,
Who do you think you are
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it,
Show how good you are.

You have got to reach on up, never lose your soul
You have got to reach on up, never lose control

I said who do you think you are
Ooh-ooh-ooh, some kind of superstar
You have got to swing it, shake it, move it, make it,
Who do you think you are
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it,
Show me how good you are
Swing it, shake it, move it, make it,
Who do you think you are
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it,
Show me how good you are.

Swing it, shake it, move it, make it, trust it, use it, prove it, groove it.
