Do you still remember how we used to be
Feeling together, believing whatever
My love has said to me
Both of us were dreamers
Young love in the sun
Felt like my Saviour, my spirit I gave you
We'd only just begun

Hasta maana, always be mine

CHORUS:
Viva forever, I'll be waiting
Everlasting like the sun
Live forever for the moment
Ever searching for the one

Yes, I still remember every whispered word,
The touch of your skin giving life from within
Like a love song never heard
Slipping through our fingers like the sands of time
Promises made, every memory saved
As reflections in my mind

Hasta maana, always be mine

CHORUS

INSTRUMENTAL INTERLUDE

Back where I belong now, was it just a dream
Feelings unfold, they will never be sold
And the secret's safe with me

Hasta maana, always be mine

CHORUS 4x
