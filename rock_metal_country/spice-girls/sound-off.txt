We're the Spice Girls, yes indeed 
Just girl power is all we need 

We know how we got this far 
Strength and courage and a wonderbra 

Could this work with only one? 
Just with me, I'd have no fun 

Could this work with only two? 
We need more for what we do 

Could this work with only three? 
Three's a crowd, bad company 

Could this work with only four? 
No way girl, we need one more 

Listen up, take my advice 
We need five for the power of Spice 

Give it up! 
Give it out! 
Take a stand! 
Better shout!
