Come on, come on 
come on, come on 
come on, come on, come on 

Faster than the first verse 
come on, come on 
come on, come on, come on 
I said... 

Faster than the second verse 
Come on, come on 
come on, come on 
come on, come on, come on 

If you wanna be in my gang, 
my gang, my gang 
if you wanna be in my gang oh yeah 

If you wanna be in my gang, 
my gang, my gang, 
if you wanna me in my gang oh yeah 

I'm the leader, 
I'm the leader, 
I'm the leader of the gang I am 

I'm the leader, 
I'm the leader, 
and there's no one like the girl I am 

I will take you 
High as a kite 
Every single night 

I will make you 
Jump out of bed 
Standing on my head* 

If you wanna be in my gang, 
my gang, my gang 
if you wanna be in my gang oh yeah 

If you wanna be in my gang, 
my gang, my gang, 
if you wanna me in my gang oh yeah 

If you wanna be in my gang, 
my gang, my gang, 
if you wanna me in my gang oh yeah
