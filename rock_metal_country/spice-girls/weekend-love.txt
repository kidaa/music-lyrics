You thought that this was love 
But my plan wasn't that for us 
I thought that you would understand 
I didn't want you for my full time man 

I like the way you made me feel that night 
It's something that I can't deny 
But I've been hurt before 
I can't take it no more 
That's why, that's why 

A weekend love is all it was 
Nothing serious because 
We're playing games we're only young 
Get with it, it was just a weekend love 

Don't you break the rules 
You thought that I would be a fool 
But now that the tables have turned 
This is a lesson you didn't want to learn 

I like the way you made me feel inside 
It's something I just had to try 
But I've been hurt before 
I can't take it no more 
That's why, that's why 

A weekend love is all it was 
Nothing serious because 
We're playing games we're only young 
Get with it, it was just a weekend love 

A weekend love is all it was 
Nothing serious because 
We're playing games we're only young 
Get with it, it was just a weekend love 

Don't try to make me try to believe that you'd never hurt someone 
Now that pain has come back to you 
And if the love you had was true 
And now you don't know what to do 

Everytime I turn around you're standing right there 
I really don't want you and I really don't care 
I can't think about you no no forever 
What we had was good but theres much much better 
You try to blame me, I'll put the blame on you 
You better get with me I can play the game to 
You say you want me back it's a simple fact that 
dragging on my girls on my back like that - yeah 

Spice girls, dark chIld 

A weekend love is all it was 
Nothing serious because 
We're playing games we're only young 
Get with it, it was just a weekend love 

A weekend love is all it was 
Nothing serious because 
We're playing games we're only young 
Get with it, it was just a weekend love 
A little weekend love
