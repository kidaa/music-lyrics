Yes... 
Well if I could stick my pen in my heart 
I would spill it all over the stage 
Would it satisfy, would it slide on by 
Would you think the boy is strange? 
Ain't he strange? 

If I could win ya, If I could sing ya 
A love song so divine 
Would it be enough for your cheating heart 
If I broke down and cried? 
If I cried? 

Spice Girls... 
I said I know it's only rock and roll, but I like it 
I said I know it's only rock and roll, 
But I like it, I like it, yes I do 
Oh well I like it 
I like it 
Said I like it 
I like it 
But you know I like it 

Can't you see 
This this old boy has been lonely 

If I could stick a knife in my heart 
Suicide right on the stage 
Would it be enough for your teenage lust 
Would it help to ease the pain? 
Ease your brain? 

If I could dig down deep in my heart 
Well the feelings would flood on the page 
Would it satisfy ya, would it slide on by ya, 
Would you think the boy's insane? 
He's insane 

I said I know it's only rock and roll, but I like it 
I said I know it's only rock and roll, 
But I like it 
I know it's only rock and roll, but I like it 
Baby I like It 
I said I know it's only rock and roll, 
But I like it, like it, yes I do 
I like it 
I like it, yeah thats right 
I like it it's only rock n roll 

Can't you see 
This this old boy has been lonely 

Do you think that your the only girl around 
I guess you think that your the only girl in town 

I said I know it's only rock and roll, but I like it 
I said I know it's only rock and roll, 
But I like it, I like it, yes I do 
But I like it, 
I like it 
I like it, like it, and thats a fact 
We like it, we like it
