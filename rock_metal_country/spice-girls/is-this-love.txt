Stay with me tonight 
I'll fill you deep inside 
And I'll give you something want a need for 

Just say you'll be with me 
for eternity 
Baby tell me how you feel 
I just need to know 

Is this love 
Is it joy, is it pain, sunshine or is it rain 
Is this love 
Is it joy, is it pain 
Is this love 

Give to me your soul 
and to lose your self control 
And I take you, somewhere that you've never been 

Play your feelings bare 
and tell me that you care 
Baby tell me what you need 
I just need to know 

Is this love 
Is it joy, is it pain, sunshine or is it rain 
Is this love 
Is it joy, is it pain 
Is this love 

Touch me, hold me 
Tell me your feelings, then believe 

Is this love 
Is it joy, is it pain, sunshine or is it rain 
Is this love 
Is it joy, is it pain, sunshine or is it rain 
Is this love 

Is this love 
Is it joy, is it pain, sunshine or is it rain 
Is this love 
Is it joy, is it pain, sunshine or is it rain 
Is this love 

Know we're together, hold me forever 
I'll show you the key to my heart 
Is this love 
Know we're together, hold me forever 
Baby, lets make a start 
Is this love
