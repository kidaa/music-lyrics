If you can't dance, if you can't dance. 
If you can't dance. if you can't dance 
If you can't dance to this you can't do nothing for me baby 
If you can't dance, if you can't dance 
If you can't dance. if you can't dance
If you can't dance to this you can't do nothing for me baby 

Now we got the flavour, the bad behaviour,
the rhythm the melody, the juice for you to savour,
rockin' and vibing somebody is jivin', 
You need to take a tip, sort it out, 
Get a grip whenever I go out wherever it may be,
There never is a Keanu but a dweeb lookin'at me 
but even if I did score he's a loser on the dance floor,
Take a deep breath count 1 2 3. 

Even when his eyes met mine
his slamming shoes were out of time,
Can't you just feel the groove
why don't you move,
it's easy can't you see, 
take my hand and dance with me 

If you can't dance, if you can't dance.
If you can't dance. if you can't dance 
If you can't dance to this you can't do nothing for me baby
If you can't dance, if you can't dance.
If you can't dance. if you can't dance 
If you can't dance to this you can't do nothing for me baby. 

Hey macho
Te vi el otro dia
Me dio mucha, mucha alegria
Eschucha la musica
Ay, madre mia
Hey chico, tu no tienes nada
Que susto, que sueco, que polla, que tieso 
Oh, no me toques 
Ay, que me lo follo 
Venga, venga, marcha salida 
Toma esta musica, me encanta deprisa
Cuidado, cuidado, que chico, que loca,
Toma mi ritmo
Me voy contigo
Hey macho te quiero
Quiero un hombre, necesito, si pero no tu nombre 
Hey macho, Hey macho
Si no bailas esto no puedes nada conmigo.
