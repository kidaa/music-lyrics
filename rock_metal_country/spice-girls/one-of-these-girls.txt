Oooooww 

One of these girls is doin' their own thing
oh uh
One of these girls is just not the same 

We think she's sweet and pretty in pink 
But you better beware, 'cause I ain't what you think 
I'm always searching for a good time, night and day 
She gets down in unusual ways
Gettin' my kicks, being naughty and cheeky
Dream on, babe your just freaky 

Oh when we get together 
We just come as a one
doing mmm, mmm
And a whoa yeah 

One of these girls is doin' their own thing
One of these girls is just not the same
I said, even though we're all doin' our own thing
Can't you see we're all playing a game
oh uh 

Taking pride in myself, in the clothes that I wear
She's only teasin' to make you stare 
She likes to do what the boys do 
Getting dirty on the pitch 
Chatting with the cup crew 

Oh when we get together 
We just come as a one
Doing mmm, mmm,
And a whoa yeah 

One of these girls is doin' their own thing
One of these girls is just not the same
I said, even though we're all doin' our own thing
Can't you see we're all playing a game
oh uh 

Pushin' in the clubs, queue jumping, 
giving all the boys a grief
Giving lots of cheek and attitude, 
keepin' our lovin' brief 

Pushin' in the clubs, queue jumping, 
giving all the boys a grief
Giving lots of cheek and attitude, 
keepin' our lovin' brief 

You think they've got it? 
Well I've got it
You've always got it 
No way, they won't get it
Ah, come on
ohhh 

Oh when we get together, 
we just come as a one
doing mmm, mmm,
and a whoa yeah 

One of these girls is doing their own thing
One of these girls is just not the same
I said, even though we're all doing our own thing
Can't you see we're all playin' a game
playin' that, oh, playin' that, oh 

One of these girls is doing their own thing
One of these girls is just not the same
playin' that, oh, playin' that, oh 
I said, even though we're all doing our own thing
Can't you see we're all playin' a game
playin' that, oh, playin' that, oh 

One of these girls is doing their own thing
One of these girls is just not the same
I said, even though we're all doing our own thing
Can't you see we're all playing a game repeat
