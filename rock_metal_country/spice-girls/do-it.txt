Wey hey, 
Come on, come on, come on 
Come on and do it [x2] 
Hey do it, do it, do it 
It's just another keep your eye fixed on the road 
Do what your mama said 
I will not be told
Keep your mouth shut, keep your legs shut 
Go back in your place 
Blameless, shameless, damsel in disgrace 
Who cares what they say 
Because the rules are for breaking 
I'll tell ya
Who made them anyway 
You gotta show what you feel 
Don't hide 

[Chorus]
Come on and do it 
Don't care how you look, it's just how you feel 
Come on and do it 
You gotta make it real 
Come on and do it 
It's time to free what's in your soul 
You gotta get it right, this time 
Come on freak and lose control 
Remember things like this should be seen and never heard 
Give a little respect to me & it will be returned 
Keep your head down, keep your nose clean 
Go back against the wall 
Girl there's no way out for you 
You are sure to fall 
Who cares what they do
Because it's your's for the taking 
So it's not for you anyway 
Make your own rules to live by 

[Chorus]

You might do the wrong thing for the right reason 
Don't just do the right thing to be pleasing 
Be pleasin 
Baby 
Who cares what they say 
Because the rules are for breaking I'll tell ya
Who made them anyway 
You gotta show what you feel don't hide 

[Chorus]
