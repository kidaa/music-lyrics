If you can't dance, if you can't dance 
If you can't dance, if you can't dance, if you can't dance to this you can't do 
Nothing for me baby. 
If you can't dance, if you can't dance 
If you can't dance, if you can't dance, if you can't dance to this you can't do 
Nothing for me baby. 
Now we got the flavour, the bad behaviour 
The rhythm the melody, the juice for you to savour, 
Rockin and vibin somebody is jivin, 
You need to take a tip, sort it out, 
Get a grip whenever I go out wherever it may be. 
There never is a keanu but a dweeb lookin 
At me but then even if I did score 
He's a loser on the dance floor, 
Take a deep breath count 1 2 3. 
Even when his eyes met mine his 
Slamming moves were out of time. 
Can't you just feel the groove why don't 
You move it's easy can't you see take 
My hands and dance with me. 
If you can't dance, if you can't dance 
If you can't dance, if you can't dance, if you can't dance to this you can't do 
Nothing for me baby. 
If you can't dance, if you can't dance 
If you can't dance, if you can't dance, if you can't dance to this you can't do 
Nothing for me baby. 

[Spanish Rap]

If you can't dance, if you can't dance 
If you can't dance, if you can't dance 
If you can't dance to this you can't do 
Nothing for me baby. 
If you can't dance, if you can't dance 
If you can't dance, if you can't dance 
If you can't dance to this you can't do 
Nothing for me baby.
