Oh when the snowman brings the snow 
Oh well he just might like to know 
He's put a great big smile on somebody's face 

If you jump into your bed 
And you cover up your head 
Don't you lock the doors 
You know that sweet Santa Claus is on the way 

Well I wish it could be Christmas everyday 
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play 
Oh I wish it could be Christmas everyday 
Let the bells ring out for Christmas 

Mel's lines - if she actually knew them! 
When we're skating in the park 
If the storm cloud paints it dark 
Then your rosy cheeks are gonna light my merry way 

Now the frosticals appeared 
And they've frozen up my beard 
And So we'll lie by the fire 
Til the sleep simply melts them all away 

Well I wish it could be Christmas everyday 
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play 
Oh I wish it could be Christmas everyday 
Let the bells ring out for Christmas 

One more time everybody! 

Well I wish it could be Christmas everyday 
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play 
Oh I wish it could be Christmas everyday 
Let the bells ring out for Christmas 

Why don't you give your love, it's Christmas
