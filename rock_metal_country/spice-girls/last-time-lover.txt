Treat me right, all night,
Makes me feel good, like you should 

Listen up I gotta tell you,
About the ins and outs and goings on,
I wouldn't tell just anybody about the fox I'm chasing,
He's resistant and persistent, 
it didn't stop me from homing in,
'Cause I'm choosy not a floozy,
I get my hit and then I run with it, 

Last time lover,
Do you think I'm really cool and sexy,
and I know you want to get with me, 
Last time lover 
Do you wanna be my last time baby,
could it be your first time maybe 

We got up and down to it, 
like the dirty bass in the music, 
I got my major chords strummin',
took some time and then we're really buzzin',
First bite wet my appetite, 
second helping's always better, 
Started getting burning hot,
I found my pride not easy,
slowed it down I said stop. 

Last time lover,
Do you think I'm really cool and sexy,
and I know you want to get with me,
Last time lover 
Do you wanna be my last time baby,
could it be your first time maybe 

Last time lover, treat me right, 
lovin' under cover, all night, 
Last time lover, make me feel good, 
lovin' under cover, like you should, 
Last time lover 
Last time lover, treat me right,
lovin' under cover, all night. 

Cool sexy, ever ready, someone fine, always steady, gentle hands, dirty mind, 
use your head and don't be blind,
Words of love they don't wash with me,
what's the rush no urgency you see,
Crazy boy, potential lover, first and last lover brother 
there ain't no other,
Crazy, sweety, cool but racy, steady ready go, yes! 

Last time lover,
Do you think I'm really cool and sexy,
and I know you want to get with me,
Last time lover
Do you wanna be my last time baby,
could it be your first time maybe 
Last time lover,
repeat verse 

Treat me right, 
lovin' under cover, all night,

Do you think I'm really cool and sexy,
and I know you want to get with me,
Last time lover, make me feel good,
lovin' under cover like you should,

Do you wanna be my last time baby,
could it be your first time maybe
Last time lover, treat me right,
lovin' under cover, all night,
