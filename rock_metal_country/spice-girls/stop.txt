You just walk in, I make you smile
It's cool but
You don't even know me [harmony]
You take an inch, I run a mile
Can't win you're
Always right behind me [harmony]
And we know that you could go and find some other
Take or leave it or just don't even bother
Caught in a craze, it's just a phase
Or will this be around forever

Don't you know it's going too fast oooh, to fast
Racing so heard you know it won't last oooh, won't last
Don't you know why can't you see
Slow it down, read the sign
So you know just where you're going

Stop right now thank you very much
I need somebody with a human touch
Hey you always on the run
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun

Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do always be together

Ba da ba ba
Ba da ba ba
Ba da ba stay that way forever

And we know that you can go and find some other
Take or leave it cos we've always got each other
You know who you are and yes, you're gonna breakdown
You've crossed the line so you're gonna have to turnaround

Don't you know it's going too fast oooh, to fast
Racing so heard you know it won't last oooh, won't last
Don't you know why can't you see
Slow it down, read the sign
So you know just where you're going

Stop right now thank you very much
I need somebody with a human touch
Hey you always on the run
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun

Gotta keep it down honey, lay your back on the line
Cos I don't care about the money, don't be wasting my time
You need less speed, get off my case
You gotta slow it down baby, just get out of my face

Stop right now thank you very much
I need somebody with a human touch
Hey you always on the run
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun

Stop right now thank you very much
I need somebody with a human touch
Hey you always on the run
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun

Stop right now thank you very much
Stop right now
I need somebody with a human touch
We wanna thank, we wanna thank you
Hey you always on the run
Stop right now
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun
Thank you very much, thank you very much
