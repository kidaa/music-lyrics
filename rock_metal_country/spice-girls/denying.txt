Ooh yeah, yeah, come on
You think you're quick
But I'd like to see you keep up with me
You think you're slick
But I'd like to see you pull a trick on me
You think you're so cool
Hey big man you're old school
You think you're smart
But who the hell d'ya think you're talkin' to
Everyone can see who you are
Take a look at yourself
Tell me why keep on denying

Everything you say denying
Everything you do
So be a fool to yourself forever more trying
Any kind of move tell me
So what's it gonna prove
You ain't fooling nobody
You ain't fooling nobody
But yourself Mel B   Victoria

I know you're sweet
But I know you don't wanna be seen that way
Admit defeat, win or lose
Who cares it's just a game you play
I know you need me
If you stay that way it's never gonna be
You've got your style
But I know what you really want from me

Everyone can see who you are
Take a look at yourself
Tell me why keep on denying

Everything you say denying
Everything you do
So be a fool to yourself forever more trying
Any kind of move tell me
So what's it gonna prove
You ain't fooling nobody
You ain't fooling nobody
