Take me away 
Take me away ohhh... 

I couldn't say how it happened 
I couldn't say how the story began 
But just like the music you came in time 

I couldn't hold you forever 
I couldn't change what I feel inside 
But why did you come to my life anyway? 

You bring me joy, and ever pain 
Like sunshine colored by the rain 
Just take my hand, 
Baby you can lift me away 

Take me away, 
I could stay here forever, ohhh... 
Take me away, 
And there's nothing I can do, ohhh... 
So take me away 
Take me away with you... 

I I... couldn't wait for tommrow, 
I I... couldn't stand how our love should be, 
There's somethings in life 
You could never change, 

You took my love 
Knowing you again 
Me sad and bust 
I can never leave without you, love 
Could only mean nothing to me 

Take me away 
I could stay here forever 
Take me away 
And there's  nothing i can do, ohh... 
So take me away 
Take me away with you 

Forever, forever, forever, sweet baby 
Forever, baby, forever ever, forever, 

Take me away 
I could stay here forever 
Take me away, 
And there's nothing I can do, ohh... 

So take me away, take me away, 
Take me away, with you 
Forever, I could stay here forever 
Forever and ever 
And there's  nothing I can do, take me away 

Ohh baby, forever, so take me away, 
Forever, take me away ahh...., 
Take me away, take me away, with you 
Forever, ahh, forever, and ever, 
Take me away, please take me 
Forever forever forever, and ever, and ever 
Take me away
