Bah Hum.. No thats too strong! 
Cause it's my favorite holiday 
But all this years been a busy blur 
Don't think I have the energy 
to add to my already mad rush 
just because it is the season  
the perfect gift for me would be  
completions and connections left from last year  
world tour, aeroplanes and babies.  
Met some guys but never the time  
most of 98 was along those lines.  

so deck the halls and trim those trees 
raise up the cups of Christmas cheer 
I just need to catch my breath  
Christmas with my mates this year 


Calendar picture 
Frozen landscape 
chill this room for twenty four days  
evergreens, sparkling snow, get this winter over with 
flash back to spring time,  
sunny again 
would have been good to go for lunch  
couldn't agree when we were both free  
we tried, we said we'd keep in touch,  
we didn't of course till the summer time, 
out to the beach to his boat could have joined him  
no this time, it was me, sunburn in the third degree 
now the calendars just one page 
and of course I am excited 
tonight's the night but I've set my mind  
not to do too much about it. 


Merry Christmas Merry Christmas 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 
Merry Christmas Merry Christmas 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 


Merry Christmas Merry Christmas 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 
Merry Christmas Merry Christmas 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 


Hardly dashing through the snow 
cause I bundled up too tight  
last minutes have-to-dos 
a few cards, a few calls  
because it's R S V P  
no thanks, no party lads  
it's christmas eve, gonna relax 
turn down all of my invites  
last fall I had a night to myself 
some guy called halloween party  
waited all night for him to show  
this time his car wouldn't go  
forget it, it's cold, it's getting late  
trudge on home to celebrate  
in a quite way I unwind,  
doing christmas right this time  


Merry Christmas Merry Christmas 
But I think i'll miss this one this year 
Merry Christmas Merry Christmas 
But I think i'll miss this one this year 


Tesco has provided me with the world's smallest turkey 
all ready in the oven, nice and hot  
oh damn, guess what I forgot  
so it's on with the boots back out in the snow  
to the army all night garage but when to my wondering eyes should appear  
in the line that guy i've been chasing all year 
spending this one alone he said 
give me a break this years been crazy  
I said me too, but why are you...  
you mean you forgot the papers too  
then suddenly we laughed and laughed  
caught on to what was happening 
Christmas magic's brought this down to a very happy en-ending.  

Merry Christmas Merry Christmas 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 
Merry Christmas Merry Christmas 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 


Merry Christmas Merry Christmas 
But I think I'll miss this one this year
