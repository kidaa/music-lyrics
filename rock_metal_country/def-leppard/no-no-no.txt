Oh yeah 
She was a foxy rocker, a roxy roller 
An unchained sex machine 
Yeah 
Slippin' slidin', electric glidin' 
And boy she was mean, I said mean 
High class dealer, sippin' her tequila 
Comin' on pretty strong 
Real love stealer, rebel rousin' squealer 
She said go but I said no 

I kept saying no, no no no no no 
I kept saying no, no no no no no 

Waiting at the back door 
Couldn't take it anymore 
Didn't know where she'd been 
She looked pretty neat, turnin' on the heat 
And only seventeen, seventeen 
Windin' her up, bringin' her down 
She wanted it just the same 
Said stick around, that's when I found 
I only had myself to blame 

I kept saying no, no no no no no 
I kept saying no, no no no no no 

High class dealer, sippin' on tequila 
Comin' on really strong 
Rhythm stealer, rattle off squealer 
She said go but I said no 

Well I kept saying no, no no no no no 
Well I kept saying no, no no no no no 
Well I kept saying no, no no no no no 

I say no no no 
I say no no no 
I say no no 
No no no no no no no 
No no no no no no no
