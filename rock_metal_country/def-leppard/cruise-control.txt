I close my eyes I bend in prayer
I train my mind to just not care
And to my god I give my soul
I train my mind to cruise control

Daylight shines upon the hour of my faith
I step in to the sun
I shield my eyes from the glory of the morning
And blow it all to kingdom come

I hear my god he calls my name
I must atone all men can change
and for my god I ring the bell
I will condemn the infidel

Daylight shines upon the hour of my soul
I step in to the sun
I shield my eyes from the glory of the morning
And blow it all to kingdom come

So when I was a boy you came to me
I made up my mind
surrender all time and space to him
and blow the world to kingdom come

Daylight shines upon the hour of my faith
I step in to the sun
I shield my eyes from the glory of the morning
And blow it all to kingdom come

And blow it all to kingdom come
