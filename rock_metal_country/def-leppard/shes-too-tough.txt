Black stockings and a high-heeled dress 
Good-looking but her face is a mess 
She's no angel, oh no 
Love loaded she's got plenty to spare 
She'll pull your trigger if only you dare 
She's no angel, oh no 

She's too tough 
Can't help it, She just can't help it 
She's too tough 
Can't help it, She just can't help it 

Hands off, well it's Catch-22 
Y' can't touch if she can't have you 
She's no angel, oh no... 
Whiplash give you six of the best 
Lay back let her mind do the rest 
She's no angel, oh no. 

She's too tough 
Can't help it, She just can't help it 
She's too tough 
Can't help it, She just can't help it 
She's too tough 
Can't help it, She just can't help it 
She's too tough 
Can't help it, She just can't help it
