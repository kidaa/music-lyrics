I'm caught in a dream 
Sometimes it ain't what it seems 
I'm all in a daze 
Can't find my way out of this maze 
I'm looking for clues 
And wanting a change in the rules 
I'm locked in a cage 
Acting out on the wrong stage 

Don't want your sympathy 
Don't need the third degree 
Just got to break away and scream 
I'm caught in a dream 

I'm stood at the edge and I'm looking down 
Caught in the danger zone 
I feel like a king that has lost his crown 
And now I stand here alone 

Don't want your sympathy 
Don't need the third degree 
Just got to break away and scream 
I'M CAUGHT IN A DREAM!!! 

Fractured love, Fractured love 
Iron fist in a velvet glove 
Fractured Love, fractured love 
Cracks in the mirror of this fractured love 

I don't care if you pull down the sky 
Angry passion is a friend of mine 
Reach out for the sky above 
It's just a fractured love 

[Repeat Chorus]

I'm caught in a dream 
Why don't you set me free!! 

[Solo]

Don't want your sympathy 
Don't want your third degree 
Just got to break... 
BREAK AWAY AND SCREAM!!! 

I'm caught in a dream 
Why don't you set me free 

[Repeat Chorus]

Don't give me your fractured love!
