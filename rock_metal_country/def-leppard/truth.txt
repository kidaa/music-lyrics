I've been burning 
And dousing the flames 
I feel the whiplash 
Of the backlash on my face 
I melt to sleep at night 
But I wake to trip the day 

Never for you never for me 
Would I kiss your feet of clay 
I'm still alive and so should I 
Soak up the wave of compromise 

Am I the victim of youth 
Is this the truthh 
Why don't you tell me 
Why don't you tell me 

There's no conscience 
In charity or shame 
The voice deceive me 
But believe me its the same 
I see the black in white 
And the colour in the gray 

Better for me better for you 
Gonna bleach it all away 
I'm still alive and so should I 
Soak up the wave of compromise 

I see the scars, I hear the lies 
So what's the truth 
Why don't you tell me
