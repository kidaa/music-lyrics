I saw you on a screen
And come, a legend, a king
I heard it in a song
That's still goin' strong

A shooting star across the sky
You kiss the earth and say goodbye

Only the good die young
Only the good die young
Crashing into the sun
Only the good die young

You'll always be here

I saw you in a dream
Fallin' apart at the seams
I heard it in your voice
That you had no choice

This genius is a heavy load not sure
That leads you down the lonely road
Where love never dies

Only the good die young
Only the good die young
Crashing into the sun
Only the good die young

??

A shooting star across the sky
You kiss the earth and say goodbye

Only the good die young
Only the good die young
Crashing into the sun
Only the good die young

Only the good die young
Only the good die young
