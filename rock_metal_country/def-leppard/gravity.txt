Can't sleep at night
The darkness enslaves me
I turn out the light
And no one can save me 

So try not to stare 'cause I'm stripped to the bone
It's a trick of the light and I'm lost 

Feel like I'm falling
Gravity is dragging me
My head's about to break
Can't break my fall
Insanity inside of me
It's like I'm wide awake
Feel like I'm falling
Can't recognize
I'm hypnotized
These feelings got me plagued
Can't take it all
This gravity is killing me
I can't stand up from falling down 

I lie to myself
It don't make it easy, easy
If somebody else
Would only believe me 

My sweat soaks the sheets and I'm hung out to dry
It's a trick of the light and I'm lost 

Feel like I'm falling
Gravity is dragging me
My head's about to break
Can't break my fall
This gravity is killing me
I can't stand up from falling down
Feel like I'm falling 

Wake up 

Falling
Don't try to catch me, just let me fall
Eyes wide shut, don't make a sound
Keep falling till I hit the ground 

Feel like I'm falling
Gravity is dragging me
My head's about to break
Can't break my fall
Insanity inside of me
It's like I'm wide awake
Feel like I'm falling
Can't recognize
I'm hypnotized
These feelings got me plagued
Can't take it all
This gravity is killing me
I can't stand up from falling
Feel like I'm falling
Gravity is dragging me
My head's about to break
Can't break my fall
Insanity inside me
It's like I'm wide awake
Feel like I'm falling
Can't recognize
I'm hypnotized
These feelings got me plagued
Can't take it all
This gravity is killing me
I can't stand up from falling down
