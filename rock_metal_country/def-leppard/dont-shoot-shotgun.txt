Run for cover 
Run for cover 
Don't shoot! - Shoot! 
She's so dangerous 
Shotgun! 
Gun! 
Don't shoot shotgun! 

Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right 
Fallin' head over heals at the speed of light 
Hey little miss heaven on earth 
Whoa, won't you walk this way but I see a red alert 
Oh, my senses say keep away 
So don't shoot! 

Don't shoot shotgun 
Dream on nightmare 
Touch 'n' go 
Dove turned destroyer, she cut you up, she's a slave of love 

Run for cover, she's so dangerous 
Undercover, she's so shameless 

Don't shoot shotgun 
You got me bitin' my lip 
Don't shoot shotgun! 
Ya shootin' straight from the hip 

So don't shoot shotgun 
Shoot me, baby! 
Ow! 

Hit 'n' miss, flesh and blood 
She's sweet and indiscreet, she can't get enough 
A little midnight madness 
Oh baby, you can't hide 
So wild 'n' unpredictable 
Step aside 
'Cos you're, you're shooting wide 

Run for cover, she's so dangerous 
Undercover, she's so shameless 

[Repeat Chorus]

Oh 
Shake it, shake it! 
Ah, take this, little hit 'n' miss 

[guitar solo] 

[Repeat Chorus]

Don't shoot it! 
Don't shoot shotgun! 
Shake it, shake it! 
Aw, take this little hit 'n' miss 
Ow! 
Don't shoot shotgun! 
Oh shoot it! 
Don't shoot it! 
Uh, Oh shotgun! 
Shoot me, baby! 
Ow! 
Let it blow!
