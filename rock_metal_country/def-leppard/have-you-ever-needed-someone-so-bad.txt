Here I am, I'm in the wrong bed again 
It's just a game I just can't win 
There you are breathin' soft on my skin 
Still you won't let me in 

Why save your kisses for a rainy day 
Baby let the moment take your heart away 

Have you ever needed someone so bad, yeah 
Have you ever wanted someone 
You just couldn't have 
Did you ever try so hard 
That your world just fell apart 
Have you ever needed someone so bad 
And you're the girl I gotta have 
I gotta have you baby 

There you go, midnight promises again 
But they're broken by the dawn 
You wanna go further, faster every day baby 
But in the morning you'll be gone 
And I'm alone 

[Repeat Bridge]
[Repeat Chorus]

Every dream I dream is like 
Some Kinda rash 'n' reckless scene 
To give out such crazy love 
ou must be some kinda drug 
And if my time don't ever come 
For me you're still the same 
Damned if I don't, damned if I do 
I gotta get a fix on you 

[Repeat chorus]
