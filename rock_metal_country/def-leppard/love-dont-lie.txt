Yeah, whoa 

Time, just watching the time slipping away
Gimme a sign, where do you go when you can't find the way
So we watch and we wait and we crawl and we kneel
If you know who you are then you know how to feel
In time, maybe temptation is all that you need 

Love don't lie, it lifts you up
Takes you higher when high ain't enough
Love don't lie, it's stronger than steel
It's got the heart and emotion to heal
It's not as easy as it seems
When you can't even speak in your dreams
Love don't lie and that's the truth
Look me straight in the eye for the proof
That love don't lie
Yeah, love don't lie 

Out in the cold, with a love that burns like the sun
You've stolen my soul, so justice would seem to be done
So we hope and we pray and we live and we learn
If we know where we are then we know where to turn
In time, maybe persuasion is all that you need 

Love don't lie, it lifts you up
Takes you higher when high ain't enough
Love don't lie, it's stronger than steel
It's got the heart and emotion to heal
It's not as easy as it seems
When you can't even speak in your dreams
Love don't lie and that's the truth
Look me straight in the eye for the proof
That love don't lie 

Love don't lie, it lifts you up
Takes you higher when high ain't enough
Love don't lie, it's stronger than steel
It's got the heart and emotion to heal
Love don't lie, it lifts you up
Takes you higher when high ain't enough
Love don't lie and that's the truth
Look me straight in the eye, straight in the eye for the proof
Love don't lie
Yeah, love don't lie
Oh, oh, love don't lie
Yeah, love don't lie
