You say all I do is think about you
That's right, you're the only thing that's on my mind
Your light, won't you let it shine on me, yeah
All night, hold me tight and don't let go 
'Cause I can't help myself, you know 

It's okay, all right, all good, all right
I know what I got, I know that it's hot
And you're what I want
You're so beautiful
It's okay, all right, all good, all right
One thing on my mind
I'm so in love and so alive
You're so beautiful
Yeah, an angel from the sky
The sparkle in my eye
I can't believe you're mine
Na na na na naaah, na na na naaaah 

Sometimes, I slip and slide through my emotions
So high, take me up and spin me 'round
'Cause I don't wanna come back down 

It's okay, all right, all good, all right
I know what I got, I know that it's hot
And you're what I want
You're so beautiful
It's okay, all right, all good, all right
One thing on my mind
I'm so in love and so alive
You're so beautiful
Yeah, an angel from the sky
The sparkle in my eye
I can't believe you're mine
Na na na na naaah, na na na naaaah 

It's okay, it's all right
You're so beautiful, so beautiful 

I can't believe you're mine
An angel from the sky
The sparkle in my eye
Just barely in time
Na na na na naaah, na na na naaaah 

It's okay, all right, all good, all right
I know what I got, I know that it's hot
And you're what I want
You're so beautiful
It's okay, all right, all good, all right
One thing on my mind
I'm so in love and so alive
You're so beautiful
It's okay, all right, all good, all right
You're under my skin
My head's in a spin
Again and again
You're so beautiful
It's okay, all right, all good, all right
I look in your eyes
I'm so in love and so alive
You're so beautiful
It's okay, it's all right, it's all good, it's all right
You're so beautiful
It's okay, it's all right, it's all good, it's all right
You're so beautiful
