I gave in when you gave out
You showed me the way to love, there ain't no doubt
Always together and never apart
Disappeared, didn't say a word
I slept right through, guess I never heard
Now I'm awake but I wish I was dreamin' 

Everyday, without you in my heart
Everyday, I'm falling apart
And I know you know I think about you everyday 

I woke up and you were gone
Just one night without you, it's too long
Sleepin' with the ghost of you
Dyin' with or without you
Don't wanna feel this way tomorrow 

Everyday, without you in my heart
Everyday, I'm falling apart
And I know you know I think about you everyday 

Don't know what you got until it's gone 

Everyday, everyday, without you in my heart
Everyday, I'm falling apart
And I know you know I think about you
Everyday, till I see you again
Everyday, I'll try to pretend
But I know you know I think about you 
Everyday, out of my head, I've been dazed and confused
Everyday, I'm lost but it's you that I don't want to lose
Everyday, we're torn to giving ourselves to each other
