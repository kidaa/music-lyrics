What can I hear? 
Who can I see? 
What's this I fear that's followin' me? 
It's getting louder. 
It's coming near. 
I can not stand it. 
I'm getting outta here. 

You'd better beware now. 
You'd better take care now. 
The street of the Sinner. 
So you'll never be a winner. 

The rain is falling 
Around my feet 
The night is calling on this well-lit street. 
People in doorways 
Just stand and stare. 
Cast away shadows that really aren't there. 

Repeat Chorus 

Guitar Solo 

What can I hear? 
Who can I see? 
What's this I fear that's followin' me? 
It's getting louder. 
It's coming near. 
I can not stand it. 
I'm getting outta here. 

Repeat Chorus 

You'll never be a winner 
On Heat Street
