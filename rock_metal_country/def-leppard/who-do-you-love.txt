I'm driving off in the rain and snow 
Oh, the jets ain't jumping cause the clouds too low 
I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know 
Ice on the window, the highway's a sea 
Who do you love, is it him or is it me 
Hey hey, I wanna know 

I called Detroit city on the telephone 
Who do you love, who do you love 
The man on the line tells me you ain't home 
Who do you love, who do you love 
I don't know, who's that voice 
What's in a name 
There's a deep red glow in the early morning sky 
Who do you love, better make up your mind 

Don't wanna try love, don't wanna buy love 
I just want your love babe 

Alright 
Oh hey 

Well its five in the morning and the place is dead 
Who do you love, who do you love 
I'm gonna rest my body on an empty bed 
Who do you love, who do you love 
I don't know what's his name, baby 
What's your game 
Make up your mind are you his are you mine 
When I get back I ask you one more time 
Oh hey 
Oh hey
