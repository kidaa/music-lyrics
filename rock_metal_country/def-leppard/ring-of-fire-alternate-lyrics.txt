Thunder, you're tempting me, a feast of spice 
In the night is what I need 
Oooh, I'm ready to roar and I'm ready for more 
And I'm ready to burn like a light into the dawn 

Oh I gotta see the fire in me, turning into ecstasy 
So stick around and settle down enjoy the mystery 
A voice in the wilderness, there's something in the air 
A hidden love, forbidden pleasure, suffer secret pain 

Thunder 
Are you ready, ready for burning 
Feels like fire 
Are you ready, ready for burning 
Ring of fire 

Heartless, so indiscreet, you're stealing up 
From behind a raging heat 

I'm staring into the sun, I'm staring into a gun 
I'm stirring up a storm, turn it on and let it burn 

[Repeat Bridge]

[Repeat Chorus]

Thunder, you tempted me, you cut me up 
Like a knife so tenderly 
Oh I gotta see the fire in me, burning up my ecstasy 
A hidden love, forbidden pleasure, suffer secretly 
Oh no 

[Repeat Chorus]
