Yeah 
Cool woman, cool eyes, 
Got me hypnotized 
So head down, get a rhythm 
Stop your stalling and your bitching 

Rock steady, we're still shaking 
I'm ready for the taking 
So make your move, you might be 
Get ready for the big scene 

Let it rock, yeah, let it roll 
Let it, let it go 
You gotta, let it rock, let it roll 
Yeah just let it go 

Slow down, hold on 
You're too fast, you're too strong 
Take it easy, take it slow 
Make it last, don't let go 

A warm body is one way 
You're not leaving, c'mon stay 
So get down on your knees 
And let me know you're here to please 

Let it rock, yeah, let it roll 
Let it, let it go 
You gotta, let it rock, let it roll 
Yeah just let it go 

Let it go, let it go 
Whoah 
Cool woman, cool eyes, got me hypnotized 
Slow down, hold on 
You're too fast, you're too strong 
I need a woman, I want her to love 
A wound up woman 
And you do what I want, what I want 

Oh yeah 
Slow down, hold on 
You're too fast, you're too strong 
Take it slow, make it last 
Take it easy, not too fast 
And don't let go 

No! Rock steady, we're still shaking 
I'm ready for the taking 
So make your move, you might be 
And get a-ready for the big scene 

Yeah 
Let it rock, yeah, let it roll 
Let it, let it go 
You gotta, let it rock, let it roll 
Yeah just let it go 

Let it rock, yeah, let it roll 
Let it, let it go 
You gotta, let it rock, let it roll 
Yeah just let it go 

C'mon - let it roll, let it go 
Oh yeah Oh!
