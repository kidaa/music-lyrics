I am bad, I am evil 
I am winter, I am pain 
I'll mess up your life 
I'll beat up your wife 
I'll lose all your friends 
And I'll win in the end 

So you play the Joker 
And I'll play the Clown 
And I'll laugh while you're up there 
And I'll laugh when you're down 
Though your screams break the silence 
Oh, they won't make a sound 
Na na na na na na naaa 

I will rise, I will take you 
I will break you, never let you go 
I'll shoot through your veins 
I'll drive you insane 
I'll poison your breath 
And I'll love you to death 

So you be the Joker 
And I'll be the Clown 
And you'll laugh when you're up there 
But you'll cry when you're down 
Though your screams break the silence 
Oh, they won't make a sound 
Na na na na na na naaa 

[Repeat Chorus]

Na na na na na na naaa [x2]
