She's a gold-plated lover 
Twenty-four carat cool 
She can walk on water 
She can walk in my room 

She's a one man woman 
And it's a one man race 
She's got a kiss like fire 
She burns the lips right off my face 

It's finder's keepers 
Loser's gonna weep 
She's personal, property 
Sealed 'n' stamped 
Money in the bank 
She's privateFor my eyes only 

She's personal property 
Personal property 
Personal service, personal touch 
Exclusively mine, thank you so much 
She's a heart stoppin', brain thuddin' 
Blood pumpin', knee tremblin' 
Spine crushin', tongue tyin' 

Personal property 
And she belongs to me 

She won't fall for nothin' 
She's much more than cute 
Don't mind y' window shoppin', that's all right 
But you ain't gonna taste 
My forbidden fruit 

Adios, au revoir, 
Wiedersehen, goodbye 
She's personal property 
Off limits, out of bounds 
Under lock 'n' keyConfidential 
For my eyes only 

[Repeat Chorus]

She's mine, yeah 

Now I don't mind you guys checkin' her out 
You can whistle like a wolf 
Or you can mess around 
But let me tell you the secret 
Of the sweet life 
If you wanna stay healthy, man 
Take my advice 
You better kit the road, Jack 
And don't come back! 

You could be king of the jungle 
Or you could swing in the rain 
But she don't need no monkey, not my babe 
'Cos I'm her Tarzan and she's my Jane 

[Repeat Chorus]

And she's mine 
She belongs to me
