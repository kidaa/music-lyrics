I am all destiny, a trade 
A grain of sand 
I am the lesson to be learned 
I take the throat of innocence 
And leave decay 
I stain the way for all to see 

No fear, no voice, no reason 
In God no guiding light 
When all the guilt that's in your head 
Turns its back and plays for dead 
You scorch the earth and torch the sky 
Conscience low with head held high 

Indulge and multiply 
And sacrifice 
As lack of breath chokes underground 
Divulge degenerate 
The darker side 
From windows watch the screaming sky 

[Repeat Chorus]

When all the guilt that's in your head 
Turns its back and plays for dead 
You scorch the earth and torch the sky 
Conscience low with head held high 

From all the truth comes all the shame 
The curse of flesh just takes its aim 
On hallowed ground and tortured sky 
Walk in fear with spirits high
