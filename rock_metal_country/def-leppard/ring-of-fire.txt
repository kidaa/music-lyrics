Fun girl, you tempted me, a feast of sparks 
in the night is what I need 
Ooh I'm a-ready to roar, and I'm a-ready for more 
And I'm a-ready to burn like the light into the dawn 

Oh I gotta see the fire in me, turning into ecstasy 
So stick around and settle down enjoy the mystery 
A voice in the wilderness, there's somethin' in the air 
A little love won't bring your precious self a secret flame 

Fun girl 
Are you ready, ready for fun girl 
Feels like fire 
Are you ready, ready for fun girl 
Ring of fire 

I left, so indiscreet, you're stealing all of the fire 
electric me 
I'm staring into the sun, I'm staring into a gun 
I'm staring at the sky, turn it out and let it burn 

[Repeat Bridge]

[Repeat Chorus]

Fun girl, you tempted me, ya cut me up 
Like a knife so tenderly 
Oh I gotta see the fire in me, burning up my ecstasy 
A little love won't bring your precious self a secret flame. 
Oh no 

[Repeat Chorus]

Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
Oh
