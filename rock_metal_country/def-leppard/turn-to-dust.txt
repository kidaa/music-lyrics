The concentration drifts 
In and out of me 
Conversation slides away 
Turn and face the change in apathy 
Take a rise to fall 

Won't you save me 
Don't you blame me 
I got the feel that I'm gone - Turn to dust 

Sentence 
Rape me 
Segregate me 
I got the fear that I am gone - Turn to dust 

Slave or sympathy it atrophies 
Save but ancient hearts 
Hiding scars and knives in symphonies 
Still we rise to fall
