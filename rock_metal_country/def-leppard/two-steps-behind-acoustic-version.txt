Walk away if you want to 
it's ok, if you need to 
you can run, but you can never hide 
From the shadow that's creeping up beside you 
There's a magic running through your soul 
But you can't have it all 

Whatever you do 
I'll be two steps behind you 
Wherever you go 
and I'll be there to remind you 
that it only takes a minute of your precious time 
to turn around and I'll be two steps behind. 

Take the time 
to think about it 
Walk the line, you know you just can't fight it 
Take a look around and see what you can find 
Like the fire that's burning up inside me, 
There's a magic running through your soul 
But you can't have it all 

Whatever you do 
I'll be two steps behind you 
Wherever you go 
and I'll be there to remind you 
that it only takes a minute of your precious time 
to turn around and I'll be two steps behind. 

There's a magic running through your soul 
but you, you can't have it all 
Whatever you do 
I'll be two steps behind you 
wherever you go 
and I'll be there to remind you 
that it only takes a minute of your precious time 
To turn around and I'll be two steps behind. 

Two steps behind 
yeah, baby 
two steps behind 
ohh, sugar 
two steps behind
