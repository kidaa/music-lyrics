Lady luck never smiles 
So lend your love to me, awhile 
Do with me what you will 
Break the spell take your fill 

On and on we rode the storm 
The flame has died, the fire has gone 
Oh, this empty bed is a night alone 
I realized that long ago 

Is anybody out there Anybody there 
Does anybody wonder Anybody care 

Oh, I just gotta know 
If you're really there and you really care 
'Cause baby I'm not 

F-F-F-Foolin', Ah F-F-Foolin' 
Not F-F-F-Foolin', Ah F-F-Foolin' 

Won't you stay with me awhile 

close your eyes don't run and hide 
Easy love is no easy ride 
Just wakin' up from what we had 
Could stop good love from going bad
