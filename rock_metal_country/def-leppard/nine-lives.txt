[Tim McGraw]
Is your luck enough
is your touch enough
C'mon girl
can you keep it up
is your bluff enough

[Def Leppard]
Are you tough enough
is your stuff enough
can you start it up
are you sharp enough
let it roll, let em go, let em fly
took a chance on a chance
but the aces were high
get it on, give it up, give it in
you stole the wages of sin
got to be in it to win

[Chorus]
nine lives, nine times to die
I've been bitten once
but I won't be twice shy
nine lives, nine times to die
come on and show me your hand
cause it's your time to cry

Have you lost your touch
are the stakes too much
did you spin the wheel
and could you close a deal.
Yeah, yeah!
let it roll, let em go, give em style
took a chance on a chance
but the deuces were wild
get it on, give it up, give it in
you stole the wages of sin
cause you're in it to win

[Chorus]
Nine lives, nine times to die
I've been bitten once
but I won't be twice shy
nine lives, nine times to die
come on and show me your hand
cause it's your turn to cry

Hey!

Let it roll, let em go, let em fly
took a chance on a chance
but the aces were high
get it on, give it up, give it in
you stole the wages of sin
got to be in it to win

[Chorus]
Nine lives, nine times to die
I've been bitten once
but I won't be twice shy
nine lives, nine times to die
come on and show me your hand
cause it's your turn to cry

Nine lives, nine times to die
I've been bitten once
but I won't be shy twice
Nine lives, nine times to die
It's Russian roulette
With every roll of your dice

And nine lives is all we're gonna get ..
I said all we're gonna get yeah ..
nine lives, nine times to die
you've just bitten less than your nine lives
