Love, love look what you've done to my heart
Oh I should've known from the start
That, you'd go and tear it apart
Oh and now you've deserved me

You never lose, you never fail
You always live to tell the tale
You take me up, you bring me down
Without a touch, without a sound

Love, love why do I keep searching high and low?
You take me in your arms and let me go

Oh how long must it be until you, come run back to me cant you see
I got no release from the pain just to see you again

You never lose, you never fail
You always live to tell the tale
You take me up, you bring me down
Without a touch, without a sound

Love, love why do I keep searching high and low?
You take me in your arms and let me go

Love, love, let me go

[Guitar Solo]

When will love set me free?
When will you come back to me?

Oh love, love why do I keep searching high and low?
You take me in your arms and let me go

Oh love
