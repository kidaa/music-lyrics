Why don't you tell me what's behind the green door 
Why don't you tell me, 'cause I heard it all before 
You know the answers, got 'em under lock and key 
So why don't you tell me, end this misery 

You're a dagger in my side, stripped of all my pride 
I listen at you lie 
Gonna raise my hand, it's time to make a stand 
A voice across the land 
Demands 

Why don't you tell me the truth 
Why don't you tell me the truth 

Why don't you tell me, you got things to say 
Why don't you do it, gonna throw it all away 
Why don't you hear me, when I shout it out so loud 
How do you sleep at night with your head up in the clouds 

You're the devil in disguise, I'm sick of all your lies 
Your hints and alibi's 
Gonna raise my hand, it's time to take a stand 
A voice across the land 
Demands 

Why don't you tell me the truth 
So I can say I've got a question 
Now listen 

Can you tell me what the hell is happening 
Why the sky is falling 
And the heart is calling 
And the youth is stalling 
And it's over and over again 

Come on, come on, come on 
You gotta tell me the truth 
You don't listen, do ya 
The left hand gives 
And the right hand takes away 
That's the law of the jungle 
But you have to learn to play 

Why don't you tell me the truth 
You better tell me the truth 
Come on, why don't you tell me the truth 
You gotta tell me the truth 

You try with all your might 
You never get it right 
Can't see the morning light 
Was never in your sight 

Just like the truth
