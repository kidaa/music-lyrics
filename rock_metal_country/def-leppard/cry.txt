Here comes the flood
Can you feel the love
Washing over you
Like a tidal wave inside of you 

Here comes the night
Can you see the light
Shining like the sun
You wanna hide but it's got you on the run 

Every word you say
Is taking your breath away 

Cry, the demons that you hide
Screaming through the night
They won't forget you
Coming down, coming down, coming down, coming down
Need, the circus you gotta feed
The wound that never heals
It don't let go
Coming down, coming down, coming down, coming down 

She's here again
Your only friend
Watching over you
She never takes her eyes away from you 

She's wide awake
As she lies in wait
Your chosen bride
A mother, a lover, a kick inside 

Every single day
Is taken your breath away 

Cry, the demons that you hide
Screaming through the night
They won't forget you
Coming down, coming down, coming down, coming down
Need, the circus you gotta feed
The wound that never heals
It don't let go
Coming down, coming down, coming down, coming down 

It's been so long, since I've come undone
Slippin' in to my second skin, to my second skin 

Cry, the demons the hide
Screaming through the night
No, they won't forget you
Coming down, coming down, coming down, coming down
Need, the circus you gotta feed
The wound that never heals
It don't let go
Coming down, coming down, coming down, coming down
