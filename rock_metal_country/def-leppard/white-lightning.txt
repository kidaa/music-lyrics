No promises 
No guarantees 
When you come down here you're 
Already on your knees 
You wanna ride White Lightnin', then just sign your name 
If you wanna dance with the devil, you gotta play his way 
Play the game 
You gotta taste that sweetness 
'Cos you can't say no 
But are you ready for the nightmare 
When you can't let go 
Like a soldier of fortune 
When the money runs dry 
You've got rivers of bitter tears 
In your eyes 

You wanna leave but you can't let go 
You wanna stop but you can't say no 
You never laugh about it, you just can't live without it 
You've had enough but you just want more 
You never get what you're looking for 
You never laugh about it 

You've got both ends burning 
Like a moth to a flame 
You're going off the rails 
Like a runaway train 
It's a no-win situation 
And there's no way out 
And no one will ever hear you - Scream and shout 

[Repeat Bridge]

Run - He's coming to claim you 
Run - Nowhere to hide away 
Run - You dance with danger 
Run - Oh you gotta ride 

The White Lightning - On a dead end street 
White Lightning - Where the deadbeats meet 
White Lightning - It's a one way ride 
White Lightning - Oh, there's nowhere to hide 

Such a lonely road you ride 
It's not easy when you don't know why 
Such a heavy load you hide 
You never leave no matter how you try 

Run - He's coming to claim you 
Run - Nowhere to hide away 
Run - You dance with danger 
Run - Oh, you gotta ride 

The White Lightning - On a dead end street 
White Lightning - Where the deadbeats meet 
White Lightning - It's a one-way ride 
White Lightning - Oh there's nowhere to hide 

White Lightning 
Can you feel it - Can you feel it 
White Lightning 
It's so dangerous 
White Lightning 

No promises 
No guarantees 
White Lighning 
When you come down here boy, 
You're already on your knees
