"Are you excitable" 
Stand up, say yeah, stand up 
Stand up, say yeah, stand up, never go down 
Hey! Hey! 
Check it out! 

Ah, this o-o-obsession 
It's gettin' a-invitin' 
A little a X-rated 
A little bit excitin' 

Stand up - stand up 
Say yeah 
Stand up - stand up 
Stand up - stand up 
Say yeah 
Say yeah 

Stand up - C'mon get in the groove 
Ya know I get so - Excitable 
I really get so - Excitable 
I wanna get you - Excitable 

So c'mon, let's go! 
Ah, baby, don't say no 

Oooh 
Ah, this te-temptation 
It gets-a a-outrageous 
Ha! It's such a a sensation 
A little bit co-contagious 

[Repeat Bridge]

[Repeat Chorus]

So baby, let's go! 

[interlude] 

"Are you excitable" - "Are you excitable" 
This o-o-obsession 
Check it out 
Hey! 

Inch by inch, mile by mile, what I do I do in style 
You got your leather, la-lace, long and lean 
Ballistic a lipstick dream machine 

You got to do it! 
Ah, do it, do it! 
Hey, c'mon and do it! 

[Repeat Chorus]

So, c'mon, let's go! 

[Repeat Chorus]

Ya got me shiverin' - Excitable 
Shakin' and shiverin'
