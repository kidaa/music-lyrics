Ooohhhahhhhh

How can I know
How can I see it through your eyes
Now you know
All those promises were lies

You close your eyes
You close your mind
To all you lost
I count the days
I count the ways
I count the cost

All that you are, no conscience
All you believe, no pride
All that you take, no reason
All that you leave, no right
All that you lose, no sorrow
All that you find, no shame
Can't take away the scar you left behind

How do you cry
When you've run right of tears
You justify
But the pain won't disappear

I count the days
I count the ways
I count the cost

All that you are, no conscience
All you believe, no pride
All that you take, no reason
All that you leave, no right
All that you lose, no sorrow
All that you find, no shame
Can't take away the scar you left

You close your eyes
You close your mind
To all you lost
I count the days
I count the ways
I count the cost

All that you are, no conscience
All you believe, no pride
All that you take, no reason
All that you leave, no right
All that you lose, no sorrow
All that you find, no shame
Can't take away the scar you left behind

Ooohhh ahhhhh
