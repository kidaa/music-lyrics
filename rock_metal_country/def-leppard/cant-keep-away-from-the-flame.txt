Lonely, lonely, lonely child 
Crystalline and lace 
Won't you walk me awhile 
Put a smile upon my face 

I don't wanna take your love in vain 
Gonna keep on coming back again 

Beauty leads the full grown child 
A rose among the thorns 
Like a ray of sunshine 
She comes, heaven in my arms 

When I see you smilin' 
It takes away my pain 
Oh, there's no denyin' 
Can't keep away from the flame 

A thousand Indian summers 
Die in desert sands 
The moon and lover's shadows 
They go slippin' through our hands 

I don't wanna take your love in vain 
Gonna keep on coming back again 

When I see you smilin' 
It takes away my pain 
Oh, there's no denyin' 
Can't keep away from the flame 

I don't wanna take your love in vain 
Gonna keep on coming back again 

When I see you smilin' 
It takes away my pain 
Oh, there's no denyin' 
Can't keep away from the flame
