Boy meets girl in prime of life
Blinded by big city lights
I'm on fire and you're the flame
You inspire the road I take
You take me to a better place
You're the sun and I'm the rain 

You're all that I need
To make me believe
I'm over the edge
But I'm not afraid
'Cause I know it's true 

With a girl like you, like you
To be by my side, like you
With a girl like you, like you, like you
Love me for the inside, ahh, like you
With a girl like you, like you
I set the scene to follow, like you
With a girl like you, like you, like you
Love for all tomorrow, ohh, like you
With a girl like you 

You were raised to be so good
I grew up misunderstood
We were distant worlds apart
Feels so right, it's meant to be
Shooting stars and chemistry
They unite a beating heart 

You're pulling me up
I can't get enough
Coming off strong
But I'm not that tough
Well I know it's true 

With a girl like you, like you
To be by my side, like you
With a girl like you, like you, like you
Love me for the inside, ahh, like you
With a girl like you, like you
I set the scene to follow, like you
With a girl like you, like you, like you
Love for all tomorrow, ohh, like you
With a girl like you, you

With a girl like you, like you, like you
To be by my side, like you
With a girl like you, like you
Love me for the inside, ahh, like you
With a girl like you, like you, like you
I set the scene to follow, like you
With a girl like you, like you, like you
Love for all tomorrow, ohh, like you
With a girl like you
