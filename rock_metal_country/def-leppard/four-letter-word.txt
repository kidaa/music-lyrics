Ain't just your kiss, K I S S that I miss
Ain't just the way that you squeeze me tight
If there's a wish at the top of my list
Uh, is that you be there every day and every night 

I found a new four letter word
The sweetest sound that I ever heard
I found a new four letter word
Lust can kinda be nice
But it ain't L O V E, indeedy
All right 

Oh when the rush that I'm dreamin' of's not enough
You touch and I can't control myself
You put the glide back into my stride
Oh yeah, you move me like-a nobody else 

I found a new four letter word
The sweetest sound that I ever heard
I found a new four letter word
Lust can kinda be nice
But it ain't L O V E, oh yeah
Let me spell it out, c'mon 

You're all I'm looking for
You ain't the girl next door
You're really so much more
You put me to shame
And then you walk right in
You know I can't explain
You do that lovin' thing
All over again 

Live life just like a wild ride
More like a landslide
Take me away 

New four letter word
The sweetest sound that I ever heard
I found a new four letter word
The sweetest sound that I ever heard
New four letter word
And baby, the sweetest sound that I ever heard
New four letter word
Hey, lust can kinda be nice
But it ain't L O V E
