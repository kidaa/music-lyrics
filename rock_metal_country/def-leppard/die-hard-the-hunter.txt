Shotgun 
Let's welcome home the soldier boy from Far away, far away 
No angel of mercy just a need to destroy Fire away, fire away 
Let's toast the hero with blood in his eyes 
The scars on his mind took so many lives 
Die Hard the Hunter 

Welcome home soldier boy 
Put down your pistol, yeah, put down your toy 
Yeah, they can take your gun away from you 
But never take away your attitude 
They can't do that, no, they can't do that 

You got no enemy, no front line 
The only battles in the back of your mind 
You don't know how to change from bad to good 
You brought the war to your neighbourhood 

Back in the city, he's a man on the loose 
He is the shadow that's following you 
He takes no prisoners when he's hunting for game 
He's got a bullet and it carries your name 

Die hard Caught in a trap 
Hunter There's no lookin' back 
Die hard He hides in the crowd 
Hunter Die Hard and Proud
