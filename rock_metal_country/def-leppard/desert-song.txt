Dark and dirty 
like you have never seen 
a mind so twisted 
with thoughts so unclean. 
My heart is racing 
all tattered and torn 
I stand here naked 
as the day I was born. 

Over and over I stand 
I'm holding the world in my hand 
I got to believe 

The sky is falling 
on this setting son 
Echoes of silence 
ringing loud and long 
This isolation 
is the king of pain 
A lost horizon 
in an ocean of flames 

Only the lonely will stand 
I'm holding the world in my hand 
I got to believe 

I've been here before, 
but not as I stand here today 
I wait for the dawn 
ready to walk 
into the light
