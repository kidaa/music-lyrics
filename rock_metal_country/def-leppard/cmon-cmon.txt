Baby, baby, won't you give me a good time
Squeeze me, please me, make it feel like the last time
Hold me close and I'll make everything come true
Just let the man in me meet the woman in you

Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
Give back the spark, come light the fuse
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Everybody everywhere

C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon
Give a little, take a little
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon

Give it all you got to give
C'mon c'mon c'mon
Oh, let me hear it everyone
C'mon c'mon

Baby, baby, take the ride of a lifetime
Thrill me, kill me, won't you send me a lifeline
Ready, steady, go wherever you want to
I bet the seven wonders ain't got nothin' on you

Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
Give back the spark, come light the fuse
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Everybody everywhere
