Ooh we ooh 
Ooh wee ooh 
In the beginning 
God made the land 
Then He made the water and creatures, then He made man 

He was born with a passion, love and hate 
A restless spirit with a need for a mate 
But there was somethin' that was missin', somethin' lost 
So he came with the answer, here's what it cost 

One part love, one part wild 
One part lady, one part child 
I give you 

Women! women! - Lots of pretty women 
Men! men! - They can't live without them 
Women! women! - Lots of pretty women 
Men! men! - They can't live without them 

And in the garden, lust began 
The animal instinct, the wanton man 
She fed him with a hunger, an appetite 
And fillin' with emotion he took a bite 

It was one part love, one part child 
One part lover, one part wild 
I give you 

[Repeat Chorus]

Skin on skin 
Let the love begin 
Women! 

[guitar solo] 

It was one part love, one part wild 
One part lover, one part child 
A whole lotta fire, a little bit of ice 
A whole lotta somethin' you can't sacrifice 
I give you 

Hair, eyes, skin on skin 
Legs - Legs 
Thighs - Thighs 

What's that spell 
Spell what's that spell 
What's that spell
What's that spell 
What's that spell
Women, women 
Oh! oh! oh! 
Oh! oh! oh! 

Women - Women 
Women 
Callin' every girl 
Women women 
All around the world 
Women - Women! 
Women 
Oh, we can't live without them 
Women women
