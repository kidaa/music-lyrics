just because
you call my name
I cannot hear
it's not the same
can't close my/you close your eyes
and knock me back
all the things that I had to have/live
and now you...just...fallen...
I can't believe what I had to say
all the things you never say
I'll never be what you want me to be
now I can't disappear
close your eyes and look at me
I can't believe what I cannot see
everything is like you say
change your mind and you'll have to forgive
and I can't disappear
now I can't
now I can't
