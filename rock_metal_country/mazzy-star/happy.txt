fields of light/of life?                    
they hold me inside             
count, my stars, they are lucky, in the sky
there's a time
when you go off the line
and all my things, look like someone else's memories
cold outside, burns a great big hole in my heart
I'll just wait, til you're happy, and your smile makes it right
it makes it right
sleep inside, the ocean has smiles?           
it shimmers and, and it flows/glows, for some people
I know it shines
I know it shines
stay inside
don't the colors make you blind
they hold me inside
count my stars
let them shine
I know they shine
