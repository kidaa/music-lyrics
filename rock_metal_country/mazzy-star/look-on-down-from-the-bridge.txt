look on down from the bridge
there's still fountains down there 
look on down from the bridge
it's still raining, up here
everybody seems so far away from me
everybody just wants to be free
look away from the sky
it's no different when you're leaving home
I can't be the same thing to you now
I'm just gone, just gone
how could I say goodbye
how could I say goodbye
goodbye
maybe I'll just place my hands over you
and close my eyes real tight
there's a light in your eyes
and you know--yeah, you know
look on down from the bridge
I'm still waiting for you
