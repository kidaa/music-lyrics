Oh Mary of Silence
You pick my heart with a smile
Oh sweet Mary
Come inside for a while
Help me get a hold on you
Or I will
I thought of myself beside you
Take me into your skin
Oh, Sweet Mary of Silence
Oh, Sweet Mary of Silence
We have a steady confusion
You're looking at fear
It doesn't seem like the first time
You walked out in a hurry
I look in
In your window
To check my head in your pane
My last thoughts
They come to me
I can't take the pain
Oh, Sweet Mary of Silence
Oh, Sweet Mary of Silence
Help me walk with you
To the sky in ?
Shuddering in myself...myself
Oh where
Oh where
Oh where
Sweet Mary of Silence
Sweet Mary of Silence
Sweet Mary of Silence
