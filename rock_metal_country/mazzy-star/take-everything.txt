I can't believe your thinking
save everyone, inside you
take everything
fake everything
save everything--about me
all of you, all right
just, just because, I want to know 
do you still come last night with clear eyes peeled/pale
you never got there even though you say you will
sorry now that you've fallen from my eyes
that's the truth
why tell me about everything
why tell me about anything
you're just waiting for her to come apart
you're just waiting for her
take everything
fake everything
save everything
