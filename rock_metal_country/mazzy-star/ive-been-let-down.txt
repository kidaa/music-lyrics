I've been let down
and I'm still coming round
I've been pulled down
and I'm still coming round for you
coming round for you
take away everything that feels fine
catch a shape in the circles of my mind
make me feel like I belong to you
make me feel it even if it ain't true
catch a train on a silver afternoon
a thousand miles and I'm gettin' there too soon
take me there, when I should be going home
tell me why I'm still feeling all alone
I've been let down
and I'm still coming round
I've been pulled down
and I'm still coming round for you
coming round for you
