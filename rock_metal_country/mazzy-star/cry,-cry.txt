cry, cry for you
just like you knew I wouldn't do
cry, cry for you
just like a song in the last light
should I bleed/leave it all away
not like the kindness that you gave
that's why it never seems the same
behind your eyes
I stood/stayed behind when no one asked me
and took you home after the fight
I drove my car into city lights
drove down the road that I am on
cry, cry for you
that's what you think I want to be
cry, cry for you
an empty heart that sees me through  
cry, cry for you
just like you knew I wouldn't do
cry cry for you
just like a song in the last light        
cry, cry for you
just like a you knew I wouldn't do
