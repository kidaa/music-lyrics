come up crash with the muses fells dust into ash
come so close that i might see the light inside me i might see
let me hold you tight and arms tight and arms you lost your chance
come so close that i might see the crash of light come down on me
with good luck i'll find the dark stop me now
find me to your heart
let me hold you tight like rain and sunshine on a rainy day
see the lights
come so close that i might see see the light come down on me
searching like the fresh goes by small like wind refuse to die
free me now so i can see the taste of wind who lock me
does the wind indeed like me
does the wind indeed like me
with good luck i find the dark stop me now
find me to your heart
let me hold you tight like rain and sunshine on a rainy day
let me hold you tight and arms tight and arms you lost your chance
come so close that i might see the crash of light come down on me
the crash of light come down on me
the crash of light come down on me
let me hold you tight and arms tight and arms you lost your chance
come so close that i might see the crash of light come down on me
with spin luck i'll find the dark stop me now find me to your heart
the crash of light come down on me
so tonight the crash goes by
small like wind and refuse to die
the crash of light come down on me
come so close that i might see see the light come down on me
i hold you tight like rain
sunshine on a rainy day
sunshine on a rainy day
