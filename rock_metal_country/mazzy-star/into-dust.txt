Still falling
Worthless and on begin
Inside today
Inside me today
Around broken in two
Til you eyes shed
Into dust
Like two strangers
Turning into dust
Til my hand shook away the fear
I could possibly be fading
Or have something more to gain
I could feel myself growing colder
I could feel myself under your fate
Under your fate
It was you breathless and tall
I could fee my eyes turning into dust
And two strangers turning into dust
Turning into dust
