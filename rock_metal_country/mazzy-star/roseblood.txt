everyday you can see
changes in her hair and smile
I can wait a million days
while her smile goes away
sometimes I feel dizzy
by the slices in her hand
secrets in her lipstick mouth
shiny or/shining on never again
shiny or/shining on never again
capture a smile and then that's all
you won't know her so it's ok
funny how things change
