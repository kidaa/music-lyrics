cannot hear what you're saying
could I tell you so
and I can't leave my troubles               
and I'm going home
lie and sleep
under deep
you know
while the cold winter waitin'
while you stumble home
all these things we were searchin'      
now we just don't know
lie and sleep
under deep
I think you know
for the rhymes of an hour
now I'm goin' home
and I can't believe I'm nothin'
cause I'm coming down/back/home?                       
lie and sleep
under deep
do you know
