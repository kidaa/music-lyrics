before I let you down again
I just want to see you in your eyes
I wouldn't have taken everything, out on you
I only thought, you could, understand
they say every man goes blind in his heart,
and they say everybody steals somebody's heart away
and I got nothing more to say about it
nothing more to you or me                  
send me your flowers, of your december
send me your dreams, of your candlelly wine
I got just one thing I can't give you
just one more thing of mine
they say every man goes blind in his heart
and they say everybody steals somebody's heart away
and I've been wondering why you let me down
and I've been taking it all for granted
