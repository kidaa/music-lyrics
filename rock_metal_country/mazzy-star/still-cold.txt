you really had a million hearts to break
now it's time that I??never left you in the moonlight   
how come there's always someone else driving your car
taking you different places, in the sunlight
still cold like the stars
that's just the way you are
still cold like the stars
used to say your heart, felt like a stone
now everything you ever wanted is your own
still cold like the stars
that's just the way you are
still cold like the stars
