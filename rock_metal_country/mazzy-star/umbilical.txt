she should have seen the thing in mother's belly
grew up alongside her sister's...
she reached out for nourishment and falls from her mother's umbilical cord
with her sister in the womb
one day she opens her mouth wide and swallows her surroundings
the red, and orange and the sounds all around her 
now she was in her corner
now she was in her corner
her eyes closed with some kind of complete
happiness
some kind of complete
happiness
now she can walk in the sunlight with a quiet sense of relief inside
now she walks in the sunlight
an extra feeling inside her soul, makes her cry
.....in her mama's belly...opens her...sisters
one day she opens her mouth wide and swallows her surroundings
the red, and orange and the sounds all around her 
in the sunlight...makes it go away
now she was in her corner
in the sunlight
now she was in her corner......she has...........
her eyes closed with some kind of complete
happiness
some kind of complete
happiness
and now she walks in the sunlight with the extra feeling, inside her
now she walks in the sunlight with the extra feeling, inside her
inside her???
