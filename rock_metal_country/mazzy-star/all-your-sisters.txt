and I knew, I was close to you
and I knew
catch me flying, in the sun
catch me drinking, of your wine
I'm gonna put something in you
make the devil feel surprised
all your sisters wanna fly
around my golden sky
around my golden sky
just because you feel, hollow inside--it's real
just because you feel, hollow inside--it's real
I'm gonna put something in you
make the devil feel surprised
make the devil feel surprised
and I knew I was close to you
and I knew                                 
catch me flying in the sun
catch me drinking, of your wine
