Lone child in the wild
A bird that's lost at sea
The words that whisper in the silent film
Say 'tomorrows gone for me'
All night lying with your head in my hands
And I search for reasons why
But if I can't get to it - I can't get through it
All that's gone now - all that's...

The tears of a guy
Is all I ever see
The tears of a guy
So many rivers run to me

Wake up dreaming with the sun in my eyes
Hear me screaming, don't ask why
Some strange music from some sweet soul song
Says I can't feel it - I can't try
Time goes - and the fountain still flows
I'll be watching through fortunate eyes
But I can't get cured - I must endure
All that's gone now - all that's...

The tears of a guy
Is all I ever see
The tears of a guy
So many rivers run to me

Drift by the walls - this way
Babylon - in your eyes
Drift by the walls - this way
Babylon - in your eyes

So many rivers run through me
And we will walk
Oh little angel
It's all I ever see
And we will rise
So many rivers run to me
And we will walk
Oh my little angels
In your eyes
So many rivers run through me
In your eyes
