I want to know where you live
I want to know who you are
I want to see what you see
I want to go where you are

Want to touch what you touch
Want to be where you are
I want to know what city this is
Seems like I'm moving so far

Riot town right noise
A lightning streak
Fate rides up and moves us on
Mother don't weep

I want to see what you see
I want to touch - let me play
I want to try every poison in sight
I want to lie where you lay
Let me see let me see
I want to know what you know
I want to learn what's imprisoning me
Iwant to know let it go

Riot time right noise
Violent times speak
Bottled up - like a fake damnation
Lightning speed
Crackdown backdoors
Meltdown shoes
Bare back riders - a rank outsider
An automatic cruise

I want to touch what you touch
I long to be where you are
I'll always know - you'll let me know all this gets too far
Let me touch. Let me touch
Let me feel what you feel
I want to know how certain this is
I want to know this is real

Riot town, right noise
Lightning streak
Fate rides up and moves us on
Mother don't weep
Crackdown back door
Violent times speak
Fate rides up and moves us on
Lightning streak
