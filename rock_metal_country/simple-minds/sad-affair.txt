I called you last night
But I got no reply
There's something not right
By the look in your eye
Makes me laugh
To walk the path
So many pass this way
It's so unreal
I can't help but feel
I gotta wake you from this daze

Listen to a world of your own
You've got to leave me alone
Sweet mother calling up now
Don't want to speak to no fool
She say I got to look out
For I've got to find the jewels
I have some precious momements
Into the night I stare
To dream of something special
Ooh Another sad affair

When all your trust
Turns to dust
And you're lost for words to say
You've got so much more to see before
You turn to walk away
Listen to a world of your own
You've got to leave me alone.

Ooh another sad affair
Another sad affair
Ooh another sad affair
Another sad affair

It makes me laugh to walk this path
So many pass this way
It's so unreal
I can't help but feel
I gotta wake you from this daze

Listen...
