Rhada come to it
Brother slide through it
Sister rise - don't you care?
Come on taste the mountain air
Innocence comes to chance
The mystery and spirit of romance
Butterflies make you sigh
And Kali-Yuga's miles away

Procession gets in line
With words of wedding day rhyme
It'll make you cry
Kali-Yuga's miles away
And the young girl's eyes are miles away
And the dust still lies miles away

Rhada come to it
Brother slide through it
Sister rise - don't you care?
Come on taste the mountain air
Innocence comes to chance
Mistery, spirit of romance
It'll make you cry
Kali-Yuga's miles away

And the dust will rise miles away
The young girls sigh miles away
And the dust will rise miles away

Don't let me down
Don't let me down

Blossoms cry to it
Chariots take you there
Climbing through mists like marble white stairs
Milliseconds - take a glance
Catch the mystery dance
Never want to lose this chance
Kali-Yuga's miles away

And the dust still rise
And the worlds will rise

Superman v supersoul
Always in control
Superman v supersoul
In control
