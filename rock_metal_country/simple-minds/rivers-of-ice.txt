Don't need the money nothing can buy
All that I feel under the skies
Shadows were falling my heart beat inside
We walk through the fields to the rivers of ice

Days turn to colour and darkness to light
She said I want you I need you I want you in my life
Love in the shadows the blood rushed inside
Carry on little saviour to the end of the line

I get high for ever
Till the river runs dry for every
Ooh for ever

It's been so many years now I still can't forget
Love flew like an eagle in God's wilderness
Shadows were falling oh my heart beat inside
We kissed on the bridge above the river of ice

I get high for ever
The river runs dry for ever
I get high for ever
The river runs dry for ever

Ooh she tells me
Ooh she tells me

Tell the end of the line

Shadows were falling
On rivers of ice
