In passage of time
To a cigarette burn
In the book that I read
To the sentence I learn
Up and down
Going round
Going round 'till we drown again

I'm gonna set myself up
I'm gonna up to the top
Up to the top
To the top
I'm going down to the ground
Going round
Till we drown
Going round till we drown again

Factory
Imitation of life
Factory
We all go out to lunch
A certain raion we know
Has left us unaware
Someone else has taken leave
Someone who did care
Elevators just don't crash
The answer lies within
Elevators Elevators
Answer lies within

To the glittering prize
To the fool in the sky
I've got a jewel in my eye
I'm going up
Coming down
Going round
Till we drown
Going round till we drown again

To the centre of the man
Because he had a plan
He had a plan to escape
But now we've got it on tape
Going up
Coming down
Going around
Going round till we drown again

Factory
Imitation of life
Factory
We all go out to lunch
A certain raion we know
Has left us unaware
Someone else has taken leave
Someone who did care
Elevators just don't crash
The answer lies within
Elevators Elevators
Answer lies within

Factory
Going out to lunch
Factory 
Going out to lunch
