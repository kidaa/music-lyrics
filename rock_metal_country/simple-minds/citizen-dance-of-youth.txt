Citizen
A cure to kill the east
A disease of the west
Romance is no escape
But I'll escape you
The manufacturing sound
Complaining to ourselves
You're cutting up our friends
Making love to our sisters
Another endless day
Another daze
But I'm losing track
The train goes off the rails
Dance Of The Youth
Youth want to dance

Citizen
The tribal war begins
But radio's a God
Industrial money
God is industry
Dance of youth
Citizen you know what we're after
Know what we're after
Know what we're after

Citizen
The state that we've come to love
Love's a crime against the state
I hate the sound of bells
Communications lost
Something we're after
I hate democracy
One more contact lost
Love
A crime against the state
The state we've come to love
Oh electric candle light
What time is it over there
We got to wear a badge
We're losing track of days

Dance of the youth
Youth want to dance

Citizen
I'll share a room with you
You're getting so very thin
Did we ask for this
Are you rationing our water
Dance of the youth
Our food is getting cold
And you're getting colder
I see you
I'm not so unaware
Citizen

Citizen
An American
Got got a camera
Takes a picture
Citizen
Drum
Citizen
Drum
Citizen
Drum
To drum to drum
