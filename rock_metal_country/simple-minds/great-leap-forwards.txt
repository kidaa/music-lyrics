I jumped up like Apollo
Crash landed on my feet
The sun shot like a laser through my brain
A little death had woken up
And put a curse on me
But I knew that that I'd be coming back again
Inspiration, across the nation
There's a poverty of expectation
All I got to do was move ahead

It's a blue sky
It's a while cloud
It's a flame
It's a blue sky
White cloud
Burning flame

I shot back to the mirror
There was nothing left to see
But a phantom with his heartbeat deep inside
I could feel the dust of ages
They were blowing back at me
But I knew that I was born to get it right

Everybody take the great leap forward
Everybody knows the mysteries at hand
If you've been praying all those sweet days for this
Don't you know there is a whole different plan
Sometimes I hear the madman calling
He talks about some dark eternal place
I've been waiting all my lifetime for this moment
And now I've got to find some other ways

One touch ignites this eagle
One kiss for heavens view
I need the flame so I can feel alive
You can tell my little brother
No requiem for me
I knew that I was born to make this flight

Inspiration across the nation
There's a poverty of expectation
All I got to do was move ahead
