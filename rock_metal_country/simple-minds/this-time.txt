What you gonna do about it
How you gonna live without it
Some of us are getting proud
And I don't know if that's allowed

People just can't forget it
This time!
Some of us are getting strong
Never want to wait too long
This time
And now I want to get away
I know what I want and I say what I say
Never want to live without it
This time!

And when the feelings show
I need the time to know
If I'm goin' to get it right
And when the feelings show
I need the faith to know
Well I don't know if I've got the message right

People can't get by without it
This time
Love is gonna get requited
This time
Some of us are getting strong
And I don't know if that's so wrong
Never want to wait to get it
This time

And when the feelings show
Tell me do you know
It I'm gonna get it right
When the light go low
Tell me do you know
Oh, I need to know
If I'm gonna get it right

People go to war to get it
This time
The devil called, better forget it
This time
Never gonna say that's wrong
Cos all I know I can't be wrong
Never go to bed without it
This time

Living in a street ain't easy
This time
Never gonna get it easy
This time
