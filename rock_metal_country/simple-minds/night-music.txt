Can you hear the lone night music
Coming in so near
When I hear the lone night music
Every nightmare crumbles and they disappear
Can you hear the echoes calling
Speaking in verse
When I hear the lone night music
Everything gets stronger and I lose this curse

Help me break the chains that hold me
Keep me from the truth
I want to feel the hands that raise me
From a low down level to the highest roof

Woh oh night music
I hear it now
Night music

I want to catch the rock that's falling
Roll it back up hill
When I hear the strange night music
The whole world's turning and I'm still standing still
I feel it growing deep inside me
Still I'm at a loss
When I hear the strange night music
It's a warning signal there's a bridge to cross

Good news from the next world
Tear yourself apart
X still marks the time and place
To cure your bitter heart
Fell like running water
Water of the soul
Spinning like a spinning wheel
Way beyond control

Spinning like a spinning wheel
Way beyond control

Can you hear the lone night music
Coming in so far
When I hear the lone night music
It's a lonely planet it's a burning star
I want to swim the widest ocean
Diving in so deep
When I hear the lone night music
Coming in so near
When I hear the lone night music
All my nightmares crumble
And they disappear
