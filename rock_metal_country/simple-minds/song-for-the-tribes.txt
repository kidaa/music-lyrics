And from the other side
A sheer white knuckle ride
So young yet feel so stung by the game
I know what's left in a name
With all those national strains

The lion hits the stage
Purple hearts revolving round with purple rage
And we all want to know where the weather goes
And what's in store tomorrow

No we don't need a replacement
The more I see the more I learn
All that time in the basement
I can't wait nor hang around

Language that shocks of the new
With the promise there's nothing to hide
When vultures rise out of the blue
And the circle of fireflies tonight
And all that heavenly light
I can't understand
The coup d'etat that walks inside every man
They all wanna know 'bout the fasion show
Where the Queen will go tomorrow

Tomorrow
Where the Queen will go tomorrow
Where the Queen will go tomorrow

No we don't need a replacement
The more I see the more I learn
All that time in the basement
I can't wait nor hang around

Feel real power in the darkness
The more I see the more I learn
Feel it more than I confess
I can't wait nor hang around

I'll be outside
I'll be outside
Song for the tribes
Song for the tribes
The more I see the more I learn
No we don't need a replacement
The more I see the more I learn
Song for the tribes
Song for the tribes
