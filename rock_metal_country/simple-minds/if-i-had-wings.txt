Open inside something about this pain
There's something about this sweet refrain
Reminds me that you're not there
And if I could care there's something about this curse
Like a needle inside a silken purse
Reminds me of all that you'd bring
If I had wings
I'm still standing

Blue mountain high
Only the fables get to fly
Without these words there's no reason why
It reminds me of all that you bring

If I had wings
Would like to teach myself
If I had wings
Would learn to stir myself
If I had wings
Strapped inside won't be denied

Nightmare brings
All that you said
And if I could fly
Long time saviour
That's the sinner's crime
Well without such trust
I know that I can never find
Never find - Never find - Never find

If I had wings
If I had wings

I'm still standing

Never find - Never find - Never find

Open inside something about this pain
There's something about this sweet refrain
Reminds me that you're not there
And if I could care there's something about this curse
Like a needle inside a silken purse
Reminds me of all that you'd bring
If I had wings
If I had wings
If I had wings
If I had wings
