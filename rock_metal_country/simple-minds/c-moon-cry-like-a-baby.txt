Cry cry cry
Cry like a baby
";C"; Moon ";C"; Moon
So where do you go, up hi under low
The devil I know said, something is missing
Outside it's hot, the first of July
And a look in your eye said, something is missing

Midnight, she cried like a baby
";C"; Moon ";C"; Moon ";C"; Moon
Cry like a baby
Can this be something we can't understand
Could it be the girl can't understand

Where will we go, up hi under low
When the devil I know say, something is missing
Sweet angels sing, about the fast place of things
But our children sing, love will conquer anything

Midnight she cried like a baby
";C"; Moon ";C"; Moon ";C"; Moon
Cry like a baby
Could it be we can't understand
Can it be we can...

Cry, cry, cry, cry like a baby
Midnight cry like a whisper
Scream like a baby
Could this be something we can't understand
Cry like a baby
