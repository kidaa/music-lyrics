South Africa Away to South Africa
Got to say I ain't gonna play Sun City

Chorus:
I ain't gonna play Sun City
I ain't gonna play Sun City
Everybody Say
I ain't gonna play Sun City
No baby
I ain't gonna play Sun City

Relocation to phoney homelands
Separation of families I can't understand
Twenty three million can't vote 'cause they're black
We're stabbing our brothers and sisters in the back I'm gonna say

Out Government tell us ";we're doing all we can";
Constructive engagement is Ronald Reagan's plan
Meanwhile people are dying and giving up hope
This quiet diplomacy ain't nothing but a joke

Chorus:

It's time to accept resposibility
Freedom is a priviledge nobody rides for free
Look around the world baby it cannot be denied
Why we're always on the wrong side

Chorus:

Boputhuswana is far away
But we know it's in South Africa no matter what they say
You can't buy me I don't care what you pay
Don't ask me Sun City 'cause I ain't gonna play

Chorus:

Relocation to phoney homelands
Separation of families I can't understand
Twenty three million can't vote 'cause they're black
We're stabbing our brothers and sisters in the back I'm gonna say

Chorus:
