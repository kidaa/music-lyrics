I look for the answer
I look for the light
I walk on every highway
Still I need you tonight

So let it be love
Lonely love
Let it be love
It's a criminal world

It hits like a bullet
It screams and it hurts
Is it my fascination
Or does love come inspired

Don't hand me down, don't push me down
Don't leave me lying on the frozen ground
You can shelter me with your sweet action
This world is splitting up and it's a chain reaction

It's a criminal world

You move like a vampire
Risen from dust
Is it my fascination

Don't hand me down, don't push me down
Don't leave me lying on the frozen ground
You can shelter me with your sweet action
This world is splitting up and it's a chain reaction
And when you point me to another place
I can turn my back upon this wilderness
And I'll step inside
Step inside
And find you waiting on the other side

It's a criminal world
