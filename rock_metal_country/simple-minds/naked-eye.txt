You can come inside
Come into the Naked Eye

My only world falls in again
I see your face fall in again
It's so dark
I don't know your name
It's so dark
And I don't know your name

Only mirrors lie only mirrors lie now
Only mirrors lie only mirrors lie now
Through the needle's eye
Through the needle's eye now
Only mirrors lie
Lie lie

You can come inside
Come into the naked eye
Naked
Naked

I feel so high
Going up on the wall
And you're down below me
Look all around look all around now
Look all around look all around now

Only mirrors lie only mirrors lie now
Only mirrors lie only mirrors lie now
Through the needle's eye
Through the needle's eye now
Only mirrors lie
Lie lie

You can come inside
Come into the naked eye
Naked
Naked

Just wanted a special view
Just me and you
Just just just the two of us
Just two of us
Going up on the wall
Up on the wall
Going up on the wall
Up on the wall
Naked Eye Naked Eye

What do you see
And what's there to learn
Reading your books
Third diagram
Someone's in the room down below
Someone someone
Someone below
Insects
Cherries
To the cherries
On the wall
Spider
