Ruby says she does not dream
She says she's seen it all before
Outside the night is cold and wet
Don't know if we can take much more

Is there someone?
Someone?

She says:
Someone is calling,
Someone is calling for me.
She says:
I got some feelings so different
No one else can see.
She says
She says

Streets are empty every day
No longer can you see the sun
You're running home before the morning light
There is a new age that has just begun

Is there someone?
Someone?

She says:
Someone is calling,
Someone is calling for me.
She says:
I got some feelings so distant
No one else can see.
She says
She says
