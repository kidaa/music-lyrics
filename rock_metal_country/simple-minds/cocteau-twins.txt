I see them walking
You know they're walking at night
Ohh in the dark you know
They're shining out so bright
Your sarky voices are gonna come on so near
As every picture becomes so clear

You
You come on so sharp
Yet be so nice
Tell me that you're so hot
But you're as cold as ice

There is no cure
You're so blind can't you see?
There is no cure
Can't buy no immunity
There is no cure
So keep your evil from me
There is no cure.

They like to stay
Ooh come on
Come on and stay up so late
You gonna talk of all the things you just wanna hate
You wanna come on
Come on
And make me so mad
Inside your heart
I know it feels so bad
You
You come on so sharp
Yet be so nice
Tell me that you're so hot
But you're as cold as ice

There is no cure
You're so blind can't you see?
There is no cure
Can't buy immunity
There is no cure
So keep your evil from me
There is no cure

Come on and do it
Just what to do it
They're going to do it
Just want to do it

There is no cure...
