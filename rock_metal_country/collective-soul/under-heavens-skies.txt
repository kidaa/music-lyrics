Whenever I taste honey from your lips
It's a moment of purpose only you can give
Whatever I hear whatever I may see
Whatever my cause, dear, I know you'll believe

Cause you're beautiful my love when I close my eyes
yeah you're beautiful my love under heaven's skies

If ever you think careless is the night
I'll comfort you with silence till the morning light
Wherever you turn, wherever you may roam
Whatever you conquer, I'll always be your home
