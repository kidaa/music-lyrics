Hey you're now thirsty 
Walking in the desert all alone 
Hey you're now searching 
Lost in isolation from your soul 
The bullets you bite 
From the pain you request 
You're finding harder to digest 
And the answers you seek 
Are the ones you destroy 
Your anger's well deployed 

Hey why can't you listen 
Hey why can't you hear 
Hey why can't you listen 
As love screams everywhere 

Hey you now hunger 
Feeding your mind with selfishness 
Hey you now wander 
Aimlessly around your consciousness 
Your prophecies fail 
And your thoughts become weak 
Silence creates necessity 
You're clothing yourself 
In the shields of despair 
Your courage now impaired 

You crucify all honesty 
No signs you see do you believe 
And all your words just twist and turn 
Reviving just to crash and burn 
You're fighting till the bitter end 
If only your heart could open up 
And listen
