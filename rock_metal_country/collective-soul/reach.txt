Should I thirst for knowledge
Can I beg you for some water
Should I fight your battles
Can I rest upon your shoulders
I hope I'm able to ride out this storm
So come on Gabriel and blow your horn

Reach, Reach out to me
Can't you see I need you to save me
Yeah, Reach, Reach out to me
Can't you see I need you to hold me

Should I beg for mercy
Can I be the one you treasure
Should I question knowledge
Can I have all of your answers
I hope I'm able to find love today
Can I ask you to light my way

Reach, Reach out to me
Can't you see I need you to guide me
Yeah, Reach, Reach out to me
Can't you see I need you to love me

Take me out of these walls
Take me somewhere I can see
Take me away from it all
Please just reach out to me
