The sky now divides 
To bring you back into the fold 
Welcome home 
Still my need to recognize 
Any comfort you may show 
Only grows 
Guess I'll learn to accommodate 
While my heart just sits and waits 
Maybe God you found 
Maybe is all that you can offer now 

Where am I to take refuge 
When the storms of pain release 
Shelter me 
This blessedness of life 
Sometimes brings me to my knees 
I call on thee 
I have not the words to write 
A Farewell to you tonight 
Maybe God you found 
Maybe is all that you can offer now 

I know hearts are weeping 
While your voice is now singing 
On high, angel on high 

[In memory of Kib Browning]
