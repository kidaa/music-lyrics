She's a picture perfect child
Of innocence.
Searching out in childlike ways
For knowledge.
Now she's questioning her mother
Yeah she's questioning her father
Yeah she's looking for the answers
To the problem that confronts her.

Do you know where the sun goes
When the water falls
Do you know where the rain goes
When the water falls

Though I think her subjects could
Run far and wide.
She has centered on the topic
Of the sky.
Now she's questioning her mother
Yeah she's questioning her father
Yeah she's looking for the answers
To the questions that confront her.
