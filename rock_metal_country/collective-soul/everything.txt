With the faces I now wear 
It's only proof my thoughts 
Have become impaired 
And the courage I shall build 
Stands at distance still 

Everything is physical 
Everything takes precedence 
Everything's admissible 
Everything is evident 

And this comfort I've designed 
Will only stay intact until 
The truth I find 
As some answers fly around 
No cure have I found 

Guide me, save me, teach me 
I need to learn from this 
Hold me, soothe me my Love 

The reflection I now see 
Is always trying to blind 
And discourage me 
But my patience shall prevail 
And myself as well 

Everything is comfortable 
Everything's a brighter shade 
Everything is suitable 
Everything is KOOL-AID
