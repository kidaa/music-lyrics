You pushed me down 
For all the world to see 
I guess that's your price 
For my loyalty 
So while you're tasting sin 
And swallowing pain 
Don't look at me 
To take your blame 

When you're willing to render 
To the guilt you concede 
When truth is your reason 
Then lay that blame on me 
When you unveil a conscience 
And with peace you agree 
When love is your constant 
Then lay that blame on me 

You lay me out 
In hopes that I'd wilt away 
But strength rained down 
And love provided shade 
So while the pageant of lies 
Still glow from your tongue 
Don't blame me for 
Your Kingdom Come 

Question your answers 
Truth has no anger 
Gather up your words 
Redemption now offered
