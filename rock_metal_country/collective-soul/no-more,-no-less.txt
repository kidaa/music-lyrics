Here I lie motionless
Catch me if you can
My properties of no defense
So, strike at your command

But, don't bring me down
All right
Don't bring me down
Cause there's purpose
For this night

Save me come tomorrow
Lead me to my urgency
See I'm no more no less
Of an angel
Than you'd have me be
So let's shake it like this

Steady here I cast my lines
Only to expose
A weaker sense and
No constraint
Now my true self shows

But, don't bring me down
All right
Don't bring me down
Cause there's promise
In the night
