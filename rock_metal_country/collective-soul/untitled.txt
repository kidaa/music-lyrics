Who have I left to please
Take what you've yet to seize.
No more questioning
'Cause love is what love should be.
Unveil to me all that you want me to do.
But why should I stop bearing allegiance to you
See, I don't believe in 
The sorcerers or the preachers.
I just believe in you.
And I don't believe in
the scholars or the wise men.
I just believe in you.

What have I left to prove
I speak all the words you choose.
Confine me in walls of truth
'Cause love does what love should do.
No more sentence. 
All of my pain has been freed.
Why should this end when your 
mercy's all I need
See, I don't believe in
The sorcerers or the preachers.
I just believe in you.
And I don't believe in 
The scholars or the wise men.
I just believe in you.
