She said good day boy, are you ready to shake
I said I love noise and this life that it makes

See I have a line though it's subject to change
I once had a thought but then I gave it away
Yeah sooner or later I'll be perfect to stay

She said good night boy, are you feeling alone
I said I love time but never ever this long

Like the sun surely loves it's newborn days yeah
Like all oceans love their waves I'm perfect to stay
