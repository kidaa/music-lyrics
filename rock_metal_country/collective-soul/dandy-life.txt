Took a walk to a caution scene
Guess I crossed the line somehow
And if I lost some of your hope
I'm sorry for the folly was all mine
And I don't ever really understand
All the things we say
But I try to anyway anyhow
For what's in a day of a dandy life
For what's in a day of this dandy life
Everything, Everything, Everything

Hangin' on every word
My social butterfly
Everyone wants to be loved
Loved in their own way

I can say I spent the night
On the telephone inside
When you said that every single
One of us can find a happy face
So why don't you go try
Try anyway
And I suppose I was born yesterday
'Cause I never thought of things
Quite in that way at all and in that way
For what's in a day of a dandy life
For what's in a day of this dandy life
Everything, Everything, Everything
