I never ever can remember 
All the things that go bump in the night 
Quietness uncovers 
Betrayal now hovers 
And my comfort levels not quite right 
I'd love to stay and evaluate 
But my torture can't wait 
It seems I'm losing ground 
Welcome all to my disciplined breakdown 

I never ever can decipher 
Who listens to the words I say 
While I sense I'm searching 
I never know who's lurking 
To scare my sacred thoughts away 
I'd love to hang and chat a while 
But my mind's become vile 
It seems I'm losing ground 
Welcome all to my disciplined breakdown 

I never ever can contribute 
To finding all the faults that sustain 
Never mind the answers 
To who spreads the cancer 
When the questioning of why remains 
I'd love to sit and rationalize 
But my tongue's become dry 
It seems I'm losing ground 
Welcome all to my disciplined breakdown 

Breakdown Reality 
Breakdown my ability to get it back 
Breakdown honestly 
Breakdown now deliver me 
From all this madness and all this agony
