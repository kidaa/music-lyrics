Got a photograph of a smile
Taken way back when we could smile
Now this plane will take me
Where I don't know
Maybe Tokyo

'Cause there's no memories over Tokyo
And there's no hurting over Tokyo

Got a photograph of some tears
Taken presently with more tears
Now I'll search for happiness
Where should I go
Maybe Tokyo

Attention will this pain go away
My condition oh it's just not the same
