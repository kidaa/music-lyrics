Now I've taken the side
Of a beautiful calm
Can you see this disguise
Fading to a resolve

And there it goes my innocence
While gathering up a compliment
And here I lie with words to swear
There's something more than
The world out there

Hesitation compounds
I've nothing left to sustain
My worries here have allowed
A momentary refrain

And there it goes my innocence
While gathering up a compliment
And here I lie with words to swear
There's something more
Than the world out there
