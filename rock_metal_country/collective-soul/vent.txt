Shut your mouth
My mother said
Don't saddle me
With selfishness

Do you feel your tongue quivering
It's moments like these I revel in

Your conversation never sticks
'Cause no truth in you exists
Yeah you bite before you lick
I love ya 'cause you're such a prick

One more time
Don't fashion me
With stylish word
Of ramblings

Do you feel my pulse lingering
It's moments like these I revel in
