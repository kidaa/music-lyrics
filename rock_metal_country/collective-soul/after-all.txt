We steal to lose every colour
From the sky
Then crawl as a child
While the shadows burn our eyes

We know there's no longer shine
On this burned out rainbow

Lately it seems we've been chasing
What times resolved
Maybe something means nothing here
After all

Whispers are now screams
This conclusion never ends
My pride with your kiss
Even angels can't defend

We know we're running head on
Into our confusion

Still we hide safe behind these crumbled walls
Cause we know there's nothing here after all
