Hey baby are you listening
I've batten all the hatches down
I've taken all of your prescriptions but no remedy I've found

[Chorus:]
Counting the Days yeah
Until some freedom can scream my name
Counting the Days yeah
Until the gods break these chains.

hey baby are you watching
I'm saddling for your side show
I never want to become precious
This life is so touch and go

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Dig it, get it, dig it what your looking for?
Dig it, get it, dig it what your searching for?
Dig it, get it, dig it yeah, dig
Yeah, dig

[Chorus]
