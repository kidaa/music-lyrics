Push me to the left, hold me to the right
I never know where to go
Burning that trail to the promised land
You're moving on out of control
Well I don't want to be some puppet on a string
And I don't want to learn of things you can't explain
And I don't want to have your views on everything
I just want to scream

Scream about hurting
Scream about mercy
Scream about something
Scream about nothing

Drop me in the hills, leave me in the plains
Give me some room to breathe
The words you spill, the moves you make
I find them all hard to believe
Well I don't want to be statistic industry
And I don't want to give when all you share is greed
And I don't want to have one more enemy
I just want to scream

There you go with all your might
Giving promises by decree
Well God is great and God is good
But God you'll never be
Well I don't want to be in your hospitality
And I don't want to live in false reality
See I'm the one obsessed with truth and honesty
I just want to scream
