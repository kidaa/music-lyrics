Yeah you want to
'Cause you say so
'Cause you need to
Yeah you need to need to
I don't want to
I don't have to
But you've got to
Yeah you got to got to

Could you stay in line
Do you follow what I say
Can you read my mind
Then off where you lay

Feel the water rise
Can you swim now on your own
Do you act surprised
When you hear lies you have told

Oh now
Now you're motoring
Oh now
Now you're fluttering
Oh now now
