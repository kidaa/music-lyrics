There she stumbles
Falling to her knees
I think she tripped on reality

I have witnessed
Tragic comedies
That's the world in which she leads

Well I would walk a million miles
To give her all that she needs
But she would walk a million more
To do what she believes

She'll have a perfect day

Troubles blooming
Innocence now fades
But still she's dry through
All the rain

There's no purpose
She has yet to crave
She's like the big dog on parade

Well I would walk a million miles
To give her all that she needs
She would walk a million more
To do well as she pleased

She had a perfect day

I can't figure this one out
I've no words here to explain
She'll just sugar kiss me off
She'll just have another perfect day
