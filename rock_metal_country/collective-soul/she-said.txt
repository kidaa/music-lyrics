She Said 

She said that time is unfair 
To a woman her age 
Now that wisdom has come 
Everything else fades 
She said she realizes 
She's seen her better days 
She said she can't look back 
To her days of youth 
What she thought were lies 
She later found was truth 
She said her daddy had dreams 
But he drank them away 
And her mother's to blame 
For the way she is today 

Life's river shall rise 
She Said 
And only the strong shall survive 
She Said 
But I'm feeling quite weak 
She Said 
Will you comfort and forgive me 
She Said 

She said she's still searching 
For salvation's light 
She said she wishes all day 
And she prays all night 
She said she won't speak of love 
Because love she's never known 
She said it's moments like these 
She hates to be alone 

Forgive me 
She Said 
Forgive me 
She Said
