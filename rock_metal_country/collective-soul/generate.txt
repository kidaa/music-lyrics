Hey you give me no choice
I entertain by the silence
That you created by noise

Hey I'm flirting inside
I need the floor opened up
For the scream I'd now love to shout

I can't convey
I can't relate to the thoughts you now
Generate
I can't contain
I can't explain all the words you now
Generate

Hey I swallowed your pride
To gather up confrontation
That you have so long denied
