Time, you've had more than your share of mine
I'm a criminal with no crime
Sing like a bird that is now released
Like an angel with clip-on wings

Yeah nothing that's etched in stone
See I'm already who's already gone

Love's a joke, love's a tease
Love's a cause I do believe but
Let it run now, let it run out to me

Low I can live in a sinking hole
Cause I'm as high as the grass will grow
Gone like a stage with its curtain drawn
Like the loss as of Babylon

Yeah I can mumble and talk again
But I'm a promise that's never been

Love's a thrill yeah, love's a scene
Love's a reason I believe but
Let it run now, let it run out to me

Yeah I'm coming round, this world loves me now
Feel the rhythm of changes laying down
