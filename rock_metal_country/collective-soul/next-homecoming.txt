I leave the cage wide open 
I give no words of caution dear 
So when you're done revolving 
I only ask your presence here 

So in the morning when I slow 
And the sun soon explodes 
I need the world to be controlled 
And in the evening when I leave 
I need a reason to believe 
In the next homecoming yeah 

I cleared the road wide open 
So put your hand on the wheel and steer 
Don't drain this conversation 
To only fill it back with tears 

So in the morning when I slow 
And the sun soon explodes 
I need the world to be controlled 
And in the evening when I leave 
I need a reason to believe 
In the next homecoming yeah 
Homecoming homecoming homecoming
