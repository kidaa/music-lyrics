Mother and child. 
I'm such a man for short while 
Your promises mean the world just spins faster than me 
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon 

And all of your friends are here are whispering 
I think you left me for their government 
All of your friends I hope are listening 
I wish you'd stop wasting all my energy 

Beauty or Beast beauty or beast 
Who's my character to be? 
I'm now powdering I'm now pouring 
All the makeup that makes me 
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon 

And all of your friends are now whispering 
I think you left me for their government 
All of your friends I hope are listening 
I wish you'd stop sucking out my energy 
And all of your friends are still whispering 
I think you left me for their government. 
All of your friends I hope are listening 
I wish you'd stop wasting all my energy. 

You got it, you got it 
C'mon 

And all of your friends are now whispering 
I think you left me for their government 
All of your friends I hope are listening 
I wish you'd stop sucking out my energy 
And all of your friends are still whispering 
I think you left me for their government 
All of your friends I hope are listening 
I wish you'd stop wasting all my energy. 
I wish you'd stop wasting all my energy. 
I wish you'd stop wasting all my energy.
