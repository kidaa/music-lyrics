In between us 
Good and evil wait 
To lie beside us 
In our bed we make 

In between us 
Caution never heeds 
We prey on weakness 
Then beg for sympathy 

In between words 
Silence parades so confusion is heard 
Our voices afraid 
To speak up and reassure 
So in between words we remain 
In between 

In between us 
Hope we've yet to see 
We long for healings 
But the scars never leave 

Silence fills the void 
Of love and hate 
An effective tool 
When used to separate 
Now separate
