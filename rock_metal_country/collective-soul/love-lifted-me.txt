Wait just a second now
Love's easier Lost than found
So learn baby learn
It's time to up and turn the other way
Yeah peace baby peace
It's past time to release and fly away

Once I was down and couldn't see
Then love lifted me
Yeah love; it was love
I believe that love lifted me

Hush not another sound
Time to move up to higher ground 
Now time baby time
No longer's on our side so make a way 
To ride baby ride
And pull me upon high and fly away

Don't push me, don't shove me
Don't make me go down in flames 
Pull me to safety and help me
To feel no more pain
Come on just lift me up
