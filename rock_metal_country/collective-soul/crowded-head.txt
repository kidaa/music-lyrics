All the words that I want to hear 
Are distorted by your weaknesses and fear 
And your lies that I push away 
I might accept them on your good self pity day 
All of your sadness is crowded in my head 
All of your madness is crowded in my head 

And the peace that I really need 
You substitute it for your policy of greed 
Still your pride always suffocates 
Any truth that your heart might want to make 
All of your sadness is crowded in my head 
All of your madness is crowded in my head 

With all your static 
I can't distinguish between what's being said 
I have no room for this 
You see I'm living with a crowded head 

And the path that I needed shown 
You left me stranded in the darkness all alone 
All the promises you fed to me 
I'm now choking from their taste of cruelty 
All of your sadness is crowded in my head 
All of your madness is crowded in my head
