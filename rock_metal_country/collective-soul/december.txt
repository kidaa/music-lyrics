Why drink the water
from my hand
Contagious as you think I am
Just tilt my sun towards 
your domain.
Your cup runneth over again.

Don't scream about
Don't think aloud
Turn your head now baby 
Just spit me out
Don't worry about
Don't speak of doubt
Turn your head now baby
Just spit me out

Why follow me to higher ground
Lost as you swear I am.
Don't throw away your basic needs,
Ambiance and vanity.

December promise you gave unto me
December whispers of treachery
December clouds are now covering me
December songs no longer I sing
