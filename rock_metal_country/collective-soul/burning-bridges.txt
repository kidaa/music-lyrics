Been thinking a lot about my ways
Guess I'm trying baby
Been searching out a way to say
Guess I'm sorry baby
This time I give all to you
It's time I prove something to you

So I'll lift you up and hold you near
Warm your heart and calm you fears
See I don't want to lose this love I found
So I'll burn my bridges, burn them down

Been hurting a lot without you here
Guess I need you baby
Been sleeping upon a bed of tears 
Guess I miss you baby
This time I give all to you 
It's time I prove something to you

Take all my world and shake it
Take my dear heart and embrace it
Take what I say and listen
My world's changing, changing for you
