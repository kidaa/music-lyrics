Soon a man will kneel to pray
Soon the light will burn our shade
And with the sweet the bitter fades
So my heart and take your place

Cause I will be your force
And I will be your right
And I will watch over you like a satellite

Soon reason will have rhyme
Soon wisdom will imply
And with courage doubt subsides
So take my heart and take my pride

And I will be your side
And I will be your might
And I will watch over you like a satellite

River will flow from scenes unknown
I'll guide you through by the love I'll show
And the stars will wish upon the night
That they could have a guiding satellite
