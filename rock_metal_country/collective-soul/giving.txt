Giving me cause so I may yearn 
Giving me words so I may learn 
I want more I want more 
Giving me thoughts that I may keep 
Giving me dreams so I may sleep 
I want more I want more 
Still all I need is love 
So give me more 

Giving me calm to fall into 
Giving me hope to guide me thru 
I want more I want more 
Giving me light to see thru tears 
Giving me strength to crush my fears 
I want more I want more 
Still all I need is love 
So give me more 

I won't break you down 
I won't bring you down anymore 

Giving me choice so I may seek 
Giving me faith so I'll believe 
I want more I want more 
Giving me breath of your mercy 
Giving yourself to comfort me 
I want more I want more 
Still all I need is love 
So give me more
