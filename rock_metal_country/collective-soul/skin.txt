I'm starting to feel loopy
Your dizziness consumes me

Jesus don't speak English
But I do think I understand
The rhyme and the reason
Of a goody good gentleman
If I were one I swear
I'd still be tasting your skin

The sky tonight is gracious
To rain on me your sweetness

I scream an explanation
Your world is so contagious
