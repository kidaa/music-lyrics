Down by sea
I think I saw yeah yeah yeah yeah 
Our love dissolve

So plant a little seed
Soon it starts growing
Shed a little light
Soon we'll be glowing
Hear a little tune 
Soon we'll start singing
Give a little love
Then love will start breathing

Out by the bay
I long to be yeah yeah yeah yeah
A man of peace
I'm gonna breathe love
Yeah, I'm gonna take a deep breath for you
Come on now people 
Come on now breathe
