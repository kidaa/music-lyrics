Lack of knowledge has a source oh boy
Still my thoughts must run their course oh yeah
And they do

Does my memory comfort you
While your eyes see me through
Well it's 10 years later and still I haven't a clue
Oh I'm crying

Caution breathes a lonely breath oh boy
Love withstands but time must rest oh yeah
And it does

Does my memory comfort you
Your eyes see me through
Well it's 10 years later and still I haven't a clue
Oh it's 10 years later
