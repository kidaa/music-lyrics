There's a way to carry on
To push me out then place me back where I belong
There's a way to make anew
To resurrect the wishes that I wish for you

I'm going on and on
I'm going' for the norm

There's a way 
To say what you say
There's a way 
To say what you say

There's a way to recognize
All the pride that wraps around for my disguise
There's a way to talk me through
To open the silence that belongs to you

I'm diggin' on and on
I'm diggin for the norm

There's a way 
To say what you say
There's a way 
To say what you say

Find some words that you can steal or borrow
Don't give it away
Save 'em up cause there's always tomorrow
