Resonate tones of saving grace
Separate from the gods of hate
Alleviate all our doubting ways
Congregate to more loving days

A collection of peace where we could live
A collection of hope for us to give
A collection of words that mean we care
A collection of love for us to share

Recognize all equality
Vocalize solidarity
Exercise your tranquility
Glamourize all of love's needs
