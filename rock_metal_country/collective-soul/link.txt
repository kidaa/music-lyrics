I'm sleeping to encompass myself 
I wake up then distribute what's left 
With my anger well defused 
The link to love I now may choose 
With my heart no more abused 
The link of love I now may use 

I'm sleeping to develop myself 
I wake up then rel;inquish what's left 
With my anger well diffused 
The link to love I now may choose 
With my heart no more abused 
The link of love I now may use 

I was caught by your lies spinning 
then was saved by truth's opinion 
All's quiet now
