In my silence I would love to forget 
But restitution hasn't come quite yet 
And with one accord I keep moving forth 
I stretch my heart to heal some more 

It used to be all I'd want to learn 
Was wisdom trust and truth 
But now all I really want to learn 
Is forgiveness for you 

As my seasons change I've now grown to know 
When one's heart creates, one's soul doesn't owe 
So I wash away stains of yesterday 
Then tempt my heart with love's display
