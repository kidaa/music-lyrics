Watch my world spin round
It stops for you
I'll give you heaven for a view
I set my sights on high my aim is true
I'd walk on water just for you

All is all I can give you
All is all I can do
All is all I wish for when I'm with you

Come lay your troubles down
Rest here with me
My kingdom is all yours to receive

Well, I'll push the clouds away
So you can have sunshine
I'll give you anything that your heart desires
