Morning like this
Make me feel like I could never float
Glimpses of peace
Portray all that you never could show

I'm not weakened by the fears
That you have applied
See I'm now learning in these walls
That you have supplied
Slow
Slow down boy
Slow down to control
Slow, slow

Clothed in new costumes
That weather your newfound storms
Staring through reason
Content with your newfound decor

I passed the darkened vaults of
Late doorways as if I were a king
Like this I chain a whisper to my faults
