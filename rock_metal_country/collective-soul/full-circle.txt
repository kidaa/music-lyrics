Drowning to discover 
I'd swim but then why bother 
Wrestled with decisions 
And fools with their opinions 
One fine morning I'll awake 
To sleep some more 
To define my premonitions 
Last judgement and conditions 
I'd have to dig in my emotions 
Then relinquish my devotion 
One fine morning I'll awake 
Then hope to learn 
One fine morning I'll awake 
To love's return 

Round and Round and Round 
I believe love goes Round and Round 
Round and Round and Round 
I believe love comes Round and Round 

Singing the rendition 
Of hope in my condition 
Caught up in defending 
That truth is never ending 
One fine morning I'll awake 
Then reaffirm 
One fine morning I'll awake 
To love's return
