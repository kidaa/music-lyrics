All around the world
Everywhere I go
No one understands me
No one knows
What I'm trying to say

No one understands me
They look at me when I talk to them
And they scratch their heads
They go what's he trying to say

But you, you speak my language
Yeah you, you speak my language

All around the world
Everywhere I go
No one understands me
No one knows
What I'm trying to say

Even in my hometown
My friends make me write it down
They look at me when I talk to them
And they shrug their shoulders
They say what's he talking about
