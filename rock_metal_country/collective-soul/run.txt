Are these times contagious
I've never been this bored before
Is this the prize I've waited for
Now as the hours passing
There's nothing left here to insure 
I long to find a messenger

Have I got a long way to run 
Yeah, I run 

Is there a cure among us
From this processed sanity 
I weaken with each voice that sings 
In this world of purchase 
I'm going to buy back memories 
To awaken some old qualities 

Have I got a long way to run
Yeah, I run
