Congratulations, oh baby I'm back again
I'm loaded down with my god and my medicine

I know wisdom is change
So why can't you function that way

Here I am flaunting my self control
'Cause happiness is more than a kiss you know

I'm activating all your promises once again
And pushing forth dear with the rage of my reverence

We could close our eyes
And recklessly run on through
Any space and time
That we choose
