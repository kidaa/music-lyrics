The Hour has Begun
Your eyes have now opened

To a world where madness craves
To A World Where Hope's enslaved
Oh I'll tremble for my love always

Your windows opened wide
Your innocence takes flight

To a world where madness craves
To A World Where Hope's enslaved
Oh I'll tremble for my love always
