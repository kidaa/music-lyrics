I'm going under, I'm suffocating
Drowning but I'm holding on
What keeps me breathing Don't have an answer
I'm drowning but I won't let go

Away now, no way out
Away now, no way out

I've been a walkin' a lonesome highway
I felt as though I had no home
My bed's been taken by another I made the bed, now lie alone

Keep it away now motherfucker, now keep it away
Keep it away now motherfucker, now keep it away

Away now, no way out
Away now, no way out
