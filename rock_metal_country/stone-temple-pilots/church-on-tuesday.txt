And I don't believe it
Is she really gone again
And I don't believe it
Is she really gone again

I'll find a way to you someday
I'll find a way to you someday

Father's always smoking
And your mom's at church on Tuesday
And your brother's always drinking and dyin'

And I don't believe it
Is she really gone again
