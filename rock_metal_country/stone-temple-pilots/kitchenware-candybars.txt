Somebody told me I know where to go
Somebody showed me I was last to know 
Sell me down the river 

What I wanted Is what I wanted 
What I wanted Is what she wanted 


Unfriendly feelings down on wounded knees 
Unfriendly reasons some blind mothers need
Sell me down the river

What I wanted Is what we wanted 
What we wanted Is what she wanted 

You read the words and it sells you life 
They sell their words, but its all a lie 

Somebody told me I know where to go 
Somebody showed me I was last to know 
Sell me down the river 

What I wanted Is what I wanted 
What we wanted Is what we wanted
