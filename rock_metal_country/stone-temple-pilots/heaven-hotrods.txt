You can get it if you really want it 
But you better off just leave it alone 
You won't forget it if you ever had it 
So you're better off just stayin' at home 

She walked in with her alligator sister 
Tryin' to get to Heaven on Sunday 
You'll never get it 
If you never had it 
So better off just leave it alone 

And the dogs came in, 
Just to see her smile 
And the dogs came in, 
Just to see her smile 
Just to see her smile 

You don't get it, no, you won't forget 
So you're better off just leave it alone 
If you don't stop thinkin' 
Soon you will be drinkin' 
And you're better off just stayin' at home 

And the dogs came in, 
Just to see her smile 
And the dogs came in, 
Just to see her smile 
Just to see her smile 

Coming Down 
Mom I'm still healing 
Coming Down 
Oh, and I'm still breathing 
Coming Down
