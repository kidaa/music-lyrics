Its ok its ok ok believe me 
Pins in me pins in me in me you kill me 
The lounge fly the lounge fly the fly you bring me 
I think I'm free but the dogs they wont release me 

Don't have a nickel or a dollar but you feed me 
My bottle's empty but you always refuel me 
I feel I'm sinking but you wont let me drown me 
I wanna fuck I wanna fuck but do you need me 

I can't give What I take away And the other understands 
She said she'd be my woman She said she'd be my man
And I can't live this way 
Please refill my soul

When you grumble, you'll always walk with scum

She said she'd be my woman She said she'd be my man
