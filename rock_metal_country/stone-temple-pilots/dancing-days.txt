Dancing days are here again as the summer evenings grow
I got my flower, I got my power I got a woman who knows. 
You know it's alright I said it's alright 
You know it's all in my heart 
You'll be my only, my one and only Is that the way we should start? 

Crazy ways are evident In the way that you're wearing your clothes 
Suppin' booze is precedent As the evening starts to glow. 
I told your momma I'd get you home 
But I didn't tell her I had no car 
I saw a lion he was standing alone With a tadpole in a jar. 

Dancing days are here again As the summer evening grows
You are my flower, you are my power You are my woman who knows.
