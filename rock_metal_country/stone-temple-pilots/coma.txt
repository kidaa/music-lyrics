Tar and feathers hide your feelings
If you even know the meaning
Your high road is overrated
You left your guru out there hangin'

Don't stay
Don't stay

Your appetite's insatiable
Devouring one thousand souls
It's more or less the same ole story
The princess and the whore. The lady.

Nobody sees it 
Nobody hears it
Nobody breathin' in a coma
So keep your secret
Your perfect secrets
It's just a game but no one's playin'

In a coma lying, waiting
Desire fills the lonely craving
So many trampled-under footwear
But more to fill the trophy cases.
