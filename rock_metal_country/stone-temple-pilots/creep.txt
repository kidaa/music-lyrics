Forward yesterday Makes me wanna stay 
What they said was real Makes me wanna steal
Living under house Guess I'm living I'm a mouse 
All's I gots is time Got no meaning just a rhyme 

Take time with a wounded hand 'cause it likes to heal 
Take time with a wounded hand 'cause I like to steal 
Take time with a wounded hand 'cause it likes to heal, 
I like to steal 

I'm half the man I used to be This feeling as the dawn it fades to gray

Feeling uninspired think I'll start a fire
Everybody run Bobby's got a gun 
Think you're kinda neat then she tells me I'm a creep 
Friends don't mean a thing Guess I'll leave it up to me. 

Take time with a wounded hand 'cause it likes to heal 
Take time with a wounded hand 'Guess i like to steal 
Take time with a wounded hand 'cause it likes to heal,
I like to steal 

I'm half the man I used to be This feeling as the dawn it fades to gray
Angst..
