find you in the dark
read you like a cheap surprise
without shame
sell me out, and frame your name

I can hear when the pig whispers sweetly
jealousy is the weapon you kill me
keep a dime for a truth you might tell
you toed the line, and I know it was mine
couldn't hide, write a wave, ride a lie
let me know, can I friend ask you why

rolling back the days
with my friend I love to play
the "little one"
superman with silver gun

I can hear when the pig whispers sweetly
jealousy is the weapon you kill me
keep a dime for a truth you might tell

wait for me, take a dive take a piece of my life
leave me numb
wait for me, tell a lie, try to take my life
leave me numb
wait for me, take a dive take a piece of my life
leave me numb
close to me, and I'll leave you numb
