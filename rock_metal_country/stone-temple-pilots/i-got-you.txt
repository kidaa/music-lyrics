I got you
But it's the craving for the good life
That sees me through trouble times
When my mind begins to wander to the spoon

And I got you
Because you're there to bend and nurture me through these
Troubled times
'Cause the fix begins to twist my troubled mind

And I got you to paint the sorry on my day
And I got you to paint the roses on my grave
And I got you

I got you
But it's the feeling that I get when you're away
Twist my mind 'cause when I'm alone and cold, I fell like dyin'
And I got you to fill the craving that I get inside my mind
When you're there to fill the space I have inside, I feel like cryin'

And I got you to paint the sorrow on my day
And I got you to paint the roses on my grave
And I got you

All the slippin' that I slap me
I got you, I got you
All the slippin' that I slap me
