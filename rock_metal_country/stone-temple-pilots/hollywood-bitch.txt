You're on the outside
You're lookin' in
You're takin' pictures of what you never been
So kill to kill 
So ya wanna die
You're burnin' slowly - with seven lives

Blow up the bitch with the firecracker smile
Switchblade in her suitcase
Loves to drive 'em wild
So kill to kill
Yeah ya gonna die
Everybody's searchin' - every single night

You'll never keep it 'cause you sold yourself
And by the way
You'll never lose it 'cause you never had it
It's all the same

Rock Star Life - turn on the switch
Hollywood Bitch - so fake that she seems real
She goes again

She's from the "Westside," she's lookin' thin
She fills her body with what she'll never be
So kill to kill - so you wanna die
Everybody's searchin' - every single night
