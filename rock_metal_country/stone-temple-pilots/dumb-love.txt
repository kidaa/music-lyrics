Loud talk, dumb love, lacerator
Come and touch
Bleed to feel, feel to f**k
Keep ya comin', comin' back for more

Alcohol, it's a lie, stimulate a needle in your eye
Let it bleed, blow your mind
Touched myself, nearly went blind

Couldn't find a way to live though the pain
Couldn't find a way
Dumb love
Couldn't find another way to win the race
Couldn't find a way
Dumb love

Couldn't get outta bed
Ten ton bricks layin' on my head
Persecute the crucified
Kill a man for losing his mind

Couldn't find a way to live through the shame
Couldn't find a way
Dumb love
Couldn't find another way to win the race
Couldn't find a way
Dumb love

Come on out, you're comin' home
Deceive yourself, you're all alone 
Come on out, you're comin' home
Deceive yourself, your secret's known

Loud talk, dumb love, lacerator
Come and touch
Bleed to feel, feel to f**k
Keep ya comin', comin' back for more

Alcohol, it's a lie, stimulate a needle in your eye
Let it bleed, blow your mind
Touched myself, nearly went blind

Couldn't find a way to live though the pain
Couldn't find a way
Dumb love
Couldn't find another way to win the race
Couldn't find a way
Dumb love

Couldn't get outta bed
Ten ton bricks layin' on my head
Persecute the crucified
Kill a man for losing his mind

Couldn't find a way to live through the shame
Couldn't find a way
Dumb love
Couldn't find another way to win the race
Couldn't find a way
Dumb love

Come on out, you're comin' home
Deceive yourself, you're all alone 
Come on out, you're comin' home
Deceive yourself, your secret's known
