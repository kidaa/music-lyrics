Christmas time is here 
Happiness and cheer 
Fun for all 
The children call 
Their favourite time of year 

Snowflakes in the air
Carols everywhere 
Golden times and ancients rhymes
Of love and dreams to share


Sleighbells in the Air 
Beauty everywhere 
The yuletide by the fireside 
And joyful memories there 


Christmas time is here 
Memories growing dear 
All that we could always see 
Such memories that be 

Sleighbells in the Air 
Beauty everywhere 
The yuletide by the fireside 
And joyful memories there
