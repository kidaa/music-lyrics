Driving faster in my car,
Falling farther from just what we are 
Smoke a cigarette and lie some more
These conversations kill - Falling faster in my car 

Time to take her home, her dizzy head is conscience laden 
Time to take a ride, it leaves today no conversation 
Time to take her home, her dizzy head is conscience laden 
Time to wait to long to wait to long to wait to long 

Too much walkin' shoes worn thin 
Too much trippin' and my soul's worn thin 
Time to catch a ride it leaves today 
Her name is what it means
Too much walkin' shoes worn thin 


Time to take her home...


Conversations kill
