No you don't get
No you don't want it
No you don't get it, no

No you don't get
No you don't want it
No you don't get it, no

She don't like the way she smiles
He don't like the way she smiles
Son of a bitch
I know what the itch is like
You won't get enough
She don't like the way she smiles
Don't want you
He don't like the way she smiles
Don't need you
She don't like the way she smiles
Can't have you
He don't like the way she smiles
I want

No you don't get it
You'll never get it
No you don't get it
I want to see through you

No you don't get it
You'll never get it
No you don't get it
I want to see through you, Now!
