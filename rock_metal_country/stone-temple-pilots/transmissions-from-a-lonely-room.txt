Miles above your circumstance
There's water on your mind
I've wrestled with convictions
And I've settled with the tide

It's more or less uncertainty
But still you play the game
A pedicure won't change the score
But all of this will fade

So low, better get on
Everything's stopped down
So slow, better get on
Everything's slowed down 

Take a bath with consecrated water 
From the shrine
And wash away the mud of all the
Miles you left behind

Triplicates and wedding rings
Both lethal to obtain
So batten down the credit cards
The devil's in the den
