And I feel that time's a wasted go So where ya going to tomorrow? 
And I see that these are lies to come So would you even care? 

And I feel it, And I feel it 

Where ya going for tomorrow Where ya going with the mask I found 
And I feel, And I feel When the dogs begin to smell her - will she smell alone? 

And I feel so much depends on the weather So is it raining in your bedroom? 
And I see that these are the eyes of disarray Would you even care? 

And I feel it, And she feels it 

Where ya going for tomorrow Where ya going with the mask I found 
And I feel, And I feel When the dogs begin to smell her - will she smell alone? 

When the dogs do find her Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
She'll find it She'll find it 
To find it
