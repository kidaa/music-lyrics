I am smelling like the rose that somebody gave me on my birthday deathbed
I am smelling like the rose that somebody gave me 'cause I'm dead   bloated 

Yeah, and she says it's natural 
I feel I've come of age 
When she peeks I start to run
You can't swallow what I'm thinking 

I am smelling like the rose that somebody gave me on my birthday deathbed
I am trampled under sole of another man's shoes guess I walked too softly

Oh yeah, and she says it's natural
I feel I've come of age 
When she peeks I start to run 
You can't swallow what I'm thinking 

I run through the world thinkin' about tomorrow
I am smelling like the rose that somebody gave me on my birthday deathbed
