Hey everybody where did Mary go 
where did Mary go? and where's my only cigarette? 
Please think for me, I can't bear to 
I'll just lie here for a while 

Wet myself, wet my bed 
I readied it all for her, you know 
Clean sheets, incense and lots of fluffy pillows - now soiled 
Hey, where's my cigarette?

Did you check the bathroom, the bathtub, 
she sleeps there sometimes, 
water cleanses you know, 
washes dirt away, makes new 

maybe she swam away

- ok, alright, now what?
