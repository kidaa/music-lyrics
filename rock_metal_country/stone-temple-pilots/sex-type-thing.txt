I am I am I am I said I wanna get next to you
I said I wanna get close to you 
You wouldn't want me have to hurt you too, hurt you too? 

I ain't I ain't I ain't A buyin' into your apathy
I'm gonna learn ya my philosophy 
You wanna know about atrocity? 

I know you want what's on my mind 
I know you like what's on my mind 
I know it eats you up inside 
I know you know, you know 

I am a man, a man I'll give ya something that ya won't forget 
I said you shouldn't have worn that dress 

I know you want what's on my mind...
Here I come, I come, I come, I come.
