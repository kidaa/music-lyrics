She turned away, what was she looking at
She was a sour girl the day that she met me
Hey! What are you looking at
She was a happy girl the day that she left me
She turned away what was she looking at
She was a sour girl the day that she met me
Hey! What are you looking at
She was a happy girl when she left me

What would you do
What would you do if I followed you
What would you do if I follow

Don't turn away, what are you looking at
He was so happy on the day that he met her
Say, what are you looking at
I was a superman, but looks are deceiving

The rollercoaster rides a lonely one
I paid a ransom note to stop it from steaming
Hey! What are you looking at
She was a teenage girl when she met me

What would you do
What would you do if I followed you
What would you do if I follow

The girl got reasons, they all got reasons

Hey! What are you looking at
She was a happy girl the day that she left me
The day that she left me
She was a happy girl the day that she left me
She was a sour girl the day that she met
The day that she left me
