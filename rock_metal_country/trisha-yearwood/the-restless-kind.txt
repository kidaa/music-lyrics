I was born the restless kind
Settlin' down never crossed my mind
Wild and woolly well I guess that's me
People sure get nervous when a woman's free
I can hold my tongueI can hold my wine
I can hold my own I'm the restless kind
Well I've seen the country and I've been to town
Rode in limousines with the tops rolled down
Walked down the road where the rivers freeze
Whatever it takes 
I do what I please
I can hold my horses
I can hold the line
I can hold my own I'm the restless kind
I was born the restless kind
And I never assume what I'm gonna find
I can stand my ground I can slip through a crack
Just as sure as I leave honey I'll be back
I can hold my temper
I can bide my time
I can hold my own 
I'm the restless kind
