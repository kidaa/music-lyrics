Dreamed of you in my solitude
I told myself way back when
That if my prayers
Could get me there
I'd never let you go again

Darlin' I had lost you once
Thought my world had come to an end
Now in my hands
A second chance
I'll never let you go again

Now and forever more
You can come to me
Baby, run to me
And I'll take you into my arms
I'll never let you go again

Now and forever more
You can come to me
Baby, run to me
And I'll take you into my arms
I'll never let you go again

In my hands
A second chance
I'll never let you go again
