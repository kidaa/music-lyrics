You used to soothe me
You used to swear with
Heart crossed conviction
That you'd be there
Where are you now

Well I'm good-one of a kind
But I would rather be two 
And I still speak my mind
But I miss talking with you
And I could hem and haw
But I'll just cut right through
I don't need nothing baby
Nothing but you

Well, I lit a candle
It's burning still
Most every night on 
My window sill
Where are you now

Well I'm good-one of a kind
But I would rather be two 
And I still speak my mind
But I miss talking with you
And I could hem and haw
But I'll just cut right through
I don't need nothing baby
Nothing but you

Weren't we something back then
Thick as thieves
Who would have ever thought that
You and me
Would let forever come to
Used to be

Well I'm good-one of a kind
But I would rather be two 
And I still speak my mind
But I miss talking with you
And I could hem and haw
But I'll just cut right through
I don't need nothing baby
Nothing but you
