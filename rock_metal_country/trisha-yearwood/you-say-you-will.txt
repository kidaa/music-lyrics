You make me promises that you don't keep
Tears are expensive, honey, words are cheap
You tell me one thing then do something else
And even though I know that all too well

I keep forgiving
I keep forgetting
I keep expecting you to change

You say you will
You say you will
You say you will
But you never do

Love doesn't come with any guarantee
It's give and take a little, that's the key
So I give you every little thing you choose
And you give me back a stack of I.O.U.'s

There seems to be a pattern here
How can I tell if you're sincere

You say you will
You say you will
You say you will
But you never do
