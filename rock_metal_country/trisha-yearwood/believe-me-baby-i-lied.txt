If there ever was a time
That I could use your trust in me
And if there ever was a reason
For me to get down on my knees
And if there's any way if there's any way
That you could love me anyhow
If you ever had much faith in me
I could use a little now

When I said it would suit me fine
If you were out of sight and out of mind
That wasn't me talking
That was my wounded pride
When I said I didn't want your love
And you were no one I was thinking of
Believe me baby I lied

Well I got no good excuses
But I got plenty of regrets
And I wish this was some bad dream
I could wake up and forget
'Cause you're the only one you're the only one
That I could never stand to lose
You're all I've ever wanted
Baby that's the truth

When I said it would suit me fine
If you were out of sight and out of mind
That wasn't me talking
That was my wounded pride
When I said I didn't want your love
And you were no one I was thinking of
Believe me baby I lied

Hey!

When I said it would suit me fine
If you were out of sight and out of mind
That wasn't me talking
That was my wounded pride
When I said I didn't want your love
And you were no one I was thinking of
Believe me baby I lied
Believe me baby I lied
