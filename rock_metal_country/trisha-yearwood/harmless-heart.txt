You said you were afraid to trust 
So sorry for yourself it must be hard 
Living inside your head 
And I'm no angel in disguise 
I've had my share of alibis 
But I was true to you 
I meant every word I said 
What's the use 
You believe whatever you want to 

You can run, you can hide 
Love will still come to find you 
You can turn it away 
Keep romancing your pain 
Your the best at self-defense 
I'd say you've mastered the art 
But baby, mine was a harmless heart 

In your eyes I'm like the rest 
You set me up to fail the test 
And prove that you were right 
Everyone lets you down 
The ghost of all that might have been 
Is tapping on your shoulder 
But you just keep right on movin' 
You never turn around 
If you ever do 
I hope you see that I really loved you 

You can run, you can hide 
Love will still come to find you 
You can turn it away 
Keep romancing your pain 
Your the best at self-defense 
I'd say you've mastered the art 
But baby, mine was a harmless heart 

Your the best at self-defense 
I'd say you've mastered the art 
But baby, mine was a harmless heart 
Baby, mine was a harmless heart
