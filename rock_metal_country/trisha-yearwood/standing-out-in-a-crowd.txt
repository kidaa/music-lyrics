Mother said: "Stand up straight.
"Don't let your classmates make,
"You feel like you don't belong.
"So not like the rest of them, 
"Someday, the best of them,
"Will realize they were wrong."
But in my world, different, an' then lonely
The last place I wanted to be...

Was standing out in a crowd,
Where the spotlight finds you and singles you out.
What are they whisperin' about?
You're thinkin' up ways to take up less space...
I can't see the grace in it...
Standin' out in a crowd. Standing out.

Too short, too tall;
Flower against the wall...
The last one chosen to play.
Too smart, too dumb,
Too strange a place to be from...
Same shoes every day.
With all these ways to be different,
Then maybe that's how you fit in.

By standing out in the crowd,
Where the spotlight finds you and singles you out.
What are they whisperin' about?
You're thinkin' up ways to take up less space...
Instead of embracing it...
Standin' out in a crowd. Standing out.

It's funny how now,
It's not such a bad place to be.
Standing out in a crowd. Standing out in a crowd.
Standing out in a crowd.

Standing out in a crowd, Standing out.
Where the spotlight finds you and singles you out.
What are they whisperin' about?
You're thinkin' up ways to take up less space...
There's no escapin' it...
Standin' out in a crowd. Standing out.
Standin' out in a crowd. Standing out.

Standin' out.
