I'll give my love
To only you
To no one else
It's for only you

You are the world to me
And you will always be
The one who's oh so beautiful
My love will always stay with you

I will be yours, for all of time.
And thank the Lord, that you are mine
For with each breath I take,
I know my love is safe
In the arms of one so wonderful
As long as I can dream, I'll dream for two
For my love is for only you

With each breath I take, I know my love is safe
In the arms of one so wonderful
As long as I can dream, I'll dream for two
For my love is for only you...
