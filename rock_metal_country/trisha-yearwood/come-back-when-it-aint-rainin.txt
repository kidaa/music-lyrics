Can't believe the way I let you use me
Can't believe all the wasted time
For a while baby you confused me
When you said I was your sunshine
But I'm just someone to call
When you need a place to fall

Come back when it ain't raining
Come back when your skies are blue
Come back when it ain't rainin' on you
It ain't rainin' on you

Tell me baby did you have a good time
Out there with your fair weather friends
You get blue when you're drinkin' red wine
Don't call me when the party ends
You think you've got it made
But you're just a sad parade

Come back when it ain't raining
Come back when your skies are blue
Come back when it ain't rainin' on you
It ain't rainin' on you

After the storm rolls by
I'm hanging my heart out to dry

Come back when it ain't raining
Come back when your skies are blue
Come back when it ain't rainin' on you
It ain't rainin' on you
