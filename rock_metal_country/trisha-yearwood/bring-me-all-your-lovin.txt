Please don't bring me flowers
Tied up in a pretty bow
I'd trade a thousand roses
For just one hand to hold

And I don't want no candy
Sugar hurts my teeth
All I want is you tonight
That'd be really sweet

There's nothin' at the five-and-dime that I really need
Your kiss is the only gift that means a thing to me
Bring me all your lovin'
That's somethin' you ain't tried
Bring me all your lovin'
And I'll be satisfied

I don't want a poem
Written fancy on a card
I'd rather have  I love you 
Scribbled on my heart

And I won't wear a new dress
From a downtown store
Wrap me up in your arms
And baby, I'll be yours

There's nothin' at the five-and-dime that I really need
Your kiss is the only gift that means a thing to me
Bring me all your lovin'
That's somethin' you ain't tried
Bring me all your lovin'
And I'll be satisfied

Yeah, bring me all your lovin'
Somethin' you ain't tried
Bring me all your lovin'
And I'll give you all of mine

There's nothin' at the five-and-dime that I really need
Your kiss is the only gift that means a thing to me
Yeah, bring me all your lovin'
Throw your presents in the creek
Bring me all your lovin'
And I'll be tickled pink
