Well, I'm thinkin' everything's alright...
It might be all right for the very first time.
Walkin' with a mate of mine,
Everybody comin' up once in a while.
Tell 'em 'bout the love.
Tell 'em bout you an' me skinny dippin' in the fountain of youth.
Yeah, I'm thinkin' everything's alright... It's alright.
It's alright. Alright. 

Well, I'm thinkin' everything is cool...
Ain't no problem lovin' on you.
Actin' like I got no sense...
Somethin' like this just proves I do.
Here you come again; look at those eyes...
Well, you get the shade, baby, I'll get the lights.
An' I'm thinkin' everything's alright... It's alright.
It's alright. It's alright.
All right.

Feelin' great... more than ok.
Hey, baby, what can I say?
It's alright, its' alright, it's alright. It's alright.
All right.

[Instrumental break]

Well, somethin' like this, you can't ignore...
I'm plannin' on doin' it a whole lot more.
An' I'm thinkin' everything's alright... It's alright.
It's alright. It's alright.

Yeah, feelin' great... more than ok.
Hey, baby, what can I say?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright. It's alright.
Hey, baby, what can I say?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, It's alright.
Yes, it is.
