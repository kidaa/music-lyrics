I told myself I'd stay away...
I got no business 'round here today.
You're so not good for me, and everybody knows,
The way you break my heart again and again.
But before I know, I'm too close
One sweet look...

And then you pull me under,
With a touch that's like no other.
I'm drifting, drowning...
There's nothin' I can do but fall into the river of you.

Well, I thought I saw love's reflection,
Just to feel your cold rejection.
Every tear adds to the water that I keep swimmin' in.
Even I know, I'm a fool; a reckless fool for you.
'Cause I keep comin' 'round here,
Like I got nothin' to lose.

An' you pull me under,
With a touch that's like no other.
I'm drifting, drowning...
There's nothin' I can do but fall into the river of you.

[Instrumental break]

Well, you pull me under,
With a touch that's like no other.
I'm drifting, drowning...
There's nothin' I can do but fall into the river of you.

You pull me under,
With a touch that's like no other.
I'm drifting, drowning...
There's nothin' I can do but fall into the river of you.

Yeah, I fall into the river of you. 

Well, you pull me under,
Fall into the river.
You pull me under.

[To fade]
