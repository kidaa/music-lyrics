You think you got me wrapped around your finger
You treat me like my mama raised a fool
But I'll tell you how you'll feel
When you hear my tires squeal
And I'm gone with somebody new

It's gonna be oh lonesome you
Moaning those all-night blues
Maybe you'll see what it's like to be me
When it's oh lonesome you

My pride is gettin' sore from being stepped on
My heart is weak from swimming through the tears
But my two feet are strong and it won't take'em long
Just to walk on out of here

Then it'll be oh lonesome you
Moaning those all-night blues
Maybe you'll see what it's like to be me
When it's oh lonesome you

It's gonna be oh lonesome you
Moaning those all-night blues
Maybe you'll see what it's like to be me
When it's oh lonesome you
