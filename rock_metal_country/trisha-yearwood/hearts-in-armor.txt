One more day
My heart's in armor
Though I meant to let you in
In an effort not to harm it
I have missed my chance again

I was singing when I freed you
But my pride was just a veil
I pretended not to need you
Now my heart tells a different tale

And every hour that goes by
The harder I become
Because I let that well run dry
Because I left you unanswered

Then like a fool I kept my secret
When it made no sense to try
Now I can no longer keep it
For it's late and the moon is high

And every hour that goes by
The harder I become
Because I let that well run dry
Because I left you unanswered

One more day my heart's in armor
Though I did not see it then
I would finish what you started
If I had that chance again

I would finish what you started
If I had that chance again
