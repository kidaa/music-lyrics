It's been a long rode, but we've got here 
It wasn't easy, but it was true 
And we found out through all the bad times 
It all comes down to me and you 

We held the greatest expectations 
Only to find it was not to be 
All the dreams we left behind us 
Only served to set us free 

We don't need no bag of silver 
We don't need no fields of gold 
Don't it make you high 
And make you wanna fly 
Knowin' we can live on love alone 

We made our break right out of high school 
You went your way and I went mine 
And everything that we went lookin' for 
Was here inside us all the time 

We don't need no bag of silver 
We don't need no fields of gold 
Don't it make you high 
And make you wanna fly 
Knowin' we can live on love alone 

We have shared every tear 
Through the years 
And all the laughter and the pain 
Were a thing we made 

We don't need no bag of silver 
We don't need no fields of gold 
Don't it make you high 
And make you wanna fly 
Knowin' we can live on love alone 

Don't it make you high 
And make you wanna fly 
Knowin' we can live on love alone 

On love alone 

Don't it make you high 

On love alone
