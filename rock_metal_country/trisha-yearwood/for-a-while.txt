Saturday, slept through the morning 
Just let the phone ring, now isn't that strange 
I watched cartoons, poor ole' coyote 
Someone had a worse day than me for a change 

And it made me happy 
It made me smile 
For a while 

You always said my friends are all crazy 
Baby here lately it seems I fit in 
We go out just like the old days 
Try to find new ways to go there again 

And it makes me happy 
It makes me smile 
For a while 

Everything's just fine 
A little ray of sunshine 
I didn't feel the fault line running straight through my heart 
I didn't think about you 
I didn't come unglued 
It's a temporary undo but it's a start 

It's a start 

Late at night I write my own movies 
And I am the star, when I close my eyes 
Except I look at Julia Roberts 
And you're just the poor jerk that I walk on by 

And it makes me happy 
It makes me smile 
For a while 

Everythings just fine 
A little ray of sunshine 
I didn't feel the fault line running straight through my heart 
I didn't think about you 
I didn't come unglued 
It's a temporary undo but it's a start 

Little victories, I'll take 'em 

Everythings just fine 
A little ray of sunshine 
I didn't feel the fault line running straight through my heart 
I didn't think about you 
I didn't come unglued 
It's a temporary undo but it's a start 

It's a start
