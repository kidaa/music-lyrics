I wanna know, who invented the wheel.
Tell me who discovered steel?
It was the wheel an' the steel that caused this pain,
An' made the car that took him away.
I wanna know who invented the wheel.

I wanna know, who found the rock.
Tell me who laid the black top.
It was the rock an' the black top that caused this pain,
And made the road for the car, that took him away.
I wanna know who invented the wheel.

Somebody give me a name,
'Cause I just need someone to blame,
For all of this heartache,
And pain I've been feelin',
Since he had to go,
I wanna know.

I wanna know who invented the time,
I didn't spend when he was mine.
It was all that time I didn't take...
It was the rock and the black top that made the highway,
For the wheel and the steel for the car, that took him away.

Somebody give me a name,
'Cause I just need someone to blame,
For all of this heartache,
And pain I've been feelin',
Since he had to go,
I wanna know.
I wanna know.

I wanna know who invented the wheel.
