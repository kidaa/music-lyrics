I give, cause every road was tough
I give, cause I can't find love
So I live, it's where I was
But in my darkness
You were there to light my way

I'll follow
Follow the winds into tomorrow
I trust where it leads me
And I know, that I'll blow home

I give, cause I tried and failed
I give, to choose someone else
No one lives here
It's what I tell my self
But like a compass you were there to point the way

I'll follow
Follow the winds into tomorrow
I trust where it leads me
And I know, that I'll blow home

Now that I've come to know your love for me
No reason to look any further
Now that the sun has come and set me free
I will stand and take your hand

I'll follow I'll follow
Follow the winds into tomorrow tomorrow
I trust where it leads me
And I know, that I'll blow
I'll follow I'll follow
Follow the winds into tomorrow tomorrow
I trust where it leads me
And I know, that I'll blow home

I'll follow
Follow the wind into tomorrow
Tomorrow
I trust where it leads me
And I know that I'll blow home
Ooh blow home
