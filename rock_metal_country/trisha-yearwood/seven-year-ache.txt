You act like you were just born tonight 
Face down in a memory but feeling alright 
So who does your past belong to today 
Baby you don't say nothing when your feeling this way 

Girls in the bars thinking who is this guy 
But they don't think nothing when they're telling you lies 
You look so careless when they're shooting that bull 
Don't you know heartaches are heros when their pockets are full 

Tell me your trying to cure a seven year ache 
See what else your old heart can take 
The boys say when is he gonna give us some room 
The girls say, God, I hope he comes back soon 

Everybody's talkin' but you don't hear a thing 
Still uptown on your downhill swing 
Boulevards empty why don't you come around 
Baby what's so great about sleeping downtown 

There's plenty of dives to be someone you're not 
Just say you're looking for something you might have forgot 
Don't bother calling to say you're leaving alone 
'Cause there's a fool on every corner when you're trying to get home 

Just tell 'em your trying to cure a seven year ache 
See what else your old heart can take 
The boys say when is he gonna give us some room 
The girls say, God, I hope he comes back soon 

Tell me your trying to cure a seven year ache 
See what else your old heart can take 
The boys say when is he gonna give us some room 
The girls say, God, I hope he comes back soon
