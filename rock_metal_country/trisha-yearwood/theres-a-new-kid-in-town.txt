We're Looking For The King
The New Messiah
We're Following The Star
Shinging Brighter
Old Man Won't You Help Us If You Can
He Shook His Head But Pointed With His Hand

There's A New Kid In Town
And He's Lying In A Manger Down The Road
There's A New Kid In Town
But He's Just Another Baby I Suppose
There's A New Kid In Town
Here In Bethlehem

I See You Travelled Far
Brearing Treasures
You Say These Gifts Are For
The New King's Pleasures
I Have Heard That A King Might Come
But Up 'Til Now There Hasn't Been One

There's A New Kid In Town
And He's Lying In A Manger Down The Road
There's A New Kid In Town
But He's Just Another Baby I Suppose
There's A New Kid In Town
Here In Bethlehem
