Stars would shine on stormy nights
Flowers grew in winter time
Everything seemed possible
When we were in love

When forever was what other people lost
This lonesome valley was what other people crossed
No I couldn't taste the tears other people shed
When goodbye was a word other people said

Rivers flowed, a bridge would burn
The nights would end, the earth still turned
Yesterday was just a song to sing
In the world we knew

When forever was what other people lost
This lonesome valley was what other people crossed
No I couldn't taste the tears other people shed
When goodbye was a word other people said
