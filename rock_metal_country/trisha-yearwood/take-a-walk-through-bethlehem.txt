The city's decorated up for Christmas
All the stores are open late tonight
People hurry through the frozen streets
I take a walk...

Every child has a thousand wishes
Every window has a thousand lights
Every soul has a need for peace
I take a walk...

There's a star that still outshines the night
You can find it if you close your eyes
And see the light

Take a walk through Bethlehem
Come and kneel before the lamb
Good news for every man
Walk through Bethlehem

Every night another TV special
Merchants counting down the shopping days
But something's missing underneath the tree
I take a walk...

'Cause every heart longs for more than tinsel
Something more than just a holiday
Come and celebrate the baby King
Let's take a walk

You don't have to travel anywhere
Faith and hope and love will bring you there
Bring you there

Take a walk through Bethlehem
Come and kneel before the lamb
Good news for every man
Walk through Bethlehem
