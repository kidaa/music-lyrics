I'm catchin' this south bound train
I've had enough of the pouring rain
Chilled to the bone, I have to go
Love was never a friend of mine
The only friend that I have is time
It's down the track, ain't lookin' back
Mexico, O Mexico
I long to see your border town
Mexico, O Mexico
Adios mi corazon
The cars are clickin' the night along
But all I hear is a heartbreak song
Haunting me, relentlessly
Come the morning and I will stand
On the banks of the Rio Grande
A brand new day, wash those tears away
There's nothin' like the feel
Of the steel against the steel
And you can't forget the crying of the rail
There's nothin' like the sight
Of a moonlit desert night
To heal a broken heart that was so frail
