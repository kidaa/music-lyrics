I could talk till I'm blue in the face
You still wouldn't hear a word I say
That television seems to be your life's ambition
Are you ignoring me purposely
Or are you really too blind to see
This neglecting me, baby it's affecting me

I need that boy
The one that chose me over every other choice
And I need that man
Whose heart and soul were in this thing when it began
I need that old friend that I once knew
Baby I need you

Do you remember how it used to be
How it felt when you were holding me
That Chevrolet was like our little get away
All the dreams we used to talk about
Are all the things that we're livin' now
But without the love, baby it just ain't enough

I need that boy
The one that chose me over every other choice
And I need that man
Whose heart and soul were in this thing when it began
I need that old friend that I once knew
Baby I need you

I need that old friend that I once knew
Baby I need you
