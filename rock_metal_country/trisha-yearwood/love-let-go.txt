Since I heard the whistle 
Of a mournful midnight train 
Sing a little duet 
With a siren in the rain 
The sang about true love 
Between the damned and the devout 
And right then for a moment 
The fire in me blew out 

And for a moment I felt my shackled heart unchained 

It was right then...instant liberation 
It was not long...but I was set free 
It was release...for a moment love let go of me 

Once I saw the moon rise 
As the sun climbed into bed 
They both shone on each other 
'Til the sun blushed ruby red 
And then a pair of swallows 
Silhouetted cross its face 
And my heart pirouetted 
Through the twilight with their grace 

And for a moment I was not a prisoner of love 

It was right then...a little liberation 
It was so quick...but I was set free 
It was release...for a moment love let go of me
