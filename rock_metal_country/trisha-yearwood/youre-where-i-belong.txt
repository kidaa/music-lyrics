I am home now, home now
I've been waiting for forever to find you, to find you
I'm not alone now, alone now
'Cause you've taken in my heart from the cold
All I know is everytime I look into your eyes
I know, I know you're where I belong
I belong with you

You're where I belong
And I know it's the truth
You're part of my heart
There's nothing I can do
Oh, you're the one who keeps me warm
My baby, you're where I belong

You're my first taste, first taste
Of the sweetest feeling I've ever known, that I've known
You're my safe place, safe place
From a world that can be so cruel and cold
You're my harbour, you're my shelter
You're that welcome smile
That lets me know I'm home

You're where I belong
I belong with you
You're where I belong
And I know it's the truth
You're part of my heart
There's nothing I can do
Oh, you're the one who keeps me warm
My baby, you're where I belong

You're the one I come to...yeah
To keep me from the cold

You're where I belong
I belong with you
You're where I belong
And I know it's the truth
You're part of my heart
There's nothing I can do
Oh, you're the one who keeps me warm
My baby, you're where I belong

You're where I belong
You're where I belong
I am home now, home now
