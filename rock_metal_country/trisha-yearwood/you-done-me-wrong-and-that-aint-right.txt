The mockingbirds are lovely for this time of year
The one that's up above me sounds so blue and clear
What's he trying to tell me as if it doesn't show
It don't take much to sell me
I plain already know

You done me wrong, and that ain't right
You hit the switch, turned out the light
Another's arms have held you tight
You done me wrong, and that ain't right

Late last Sunday evening as I was out with friends
Drinking some and gambling, and tying up loose ends
Well I heard some conversation that I was not supposed to hear
My congratulations
The situation's clear

You done me wrong, and that ain't right
You hit the switch, turned out the light
Another's arms have held you tight
You done me wrong, and that ain't right
