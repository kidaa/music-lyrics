Don't be afraid to hold me tight
You know I won't brake in two
What we're doing here tonight
Sure beats what we're going through

We both loved and lost before
You know the sadness it can bring
Tonight let's close the door
And hold onto the nearest thing

Let's keep hangin' on
So we won't fall apart
Let's make love tonight
Like we never had a broken heart

Don't be afraid to close your eyes
Pretend I'm someone that you love
And I won't have to tell you lies
'Cause it's not you I'm thinkin' of

Let's keep hangin' on
So we won't fall apart
Let's make love tonight
Like we never had a broken heart

Tonight we'll just pretend
We've been in love right from the start
Let's make love again
Like we never had a broken heart
Let's make love again
Like we never had a broken heart

Don't be afraid to close your eyes
