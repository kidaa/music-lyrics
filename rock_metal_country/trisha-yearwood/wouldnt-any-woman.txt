Baby, I'm just heart and soul, and flesh and bone
I sigh when you kiss me
Cry when you leave me alone
You tell me I'm special, but this time, tell me the truth
The way you love me, wouldn't any woman do

I've tried everything with you, even livin' on faith
Wouldn't any woman
When everybody else knew it was already too late
Wouldn't any woman
I've loved you to the limits of my self-respect
Now, I'm leavin' with what's left
Wouldn't any woman

If I had one wish, I'd only wish you well
Wouldn't tell one story if I had one story to tell
Well, baby, please stay sounds sweet, but way down deep you know
I'm not goin' anywhere, wouldn't any woman go

I've tried everything with you, even livin' on faith
Wouldn't any woman
When everybody else knew it was already too late
Wouldn't any woman
I've loved you to the limits of my self-respect
Now, I'm leavin' with what's left
Wouldn't any woman
