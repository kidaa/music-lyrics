For reasons I've forgotten now
We brought love to an end
Ain't it funny how the little things
Seemed so big back then
Damn the pride that makes me want
To break instead of bend
For reasons I've forgotten now
I lost my one true friend

It's lonely tonight
Lookin' back on yesterday
Seein' the fool I was
Feelin' the price I've paid
And the crazy thing about it is
I don't even remember
Who was right
Who was wrong

For reasons I've forgotten now
We brought love to an end
Ain't it funny how the little things
Seemed so big back then
Damn the pride that makes me want
To break instead of bend
For reasons I've forgotten now
I lost my one true friend
