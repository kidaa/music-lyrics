feat. Garth Brooks

Honey, I know you got a good job
Out there making all that dough
They keep late working that overtime
And I don't ever see you no more
Guess you're not checking your message machine
Seems like you're never in
Oh, but I got a hunch, if we can just do lunch
I can get your attention again
I know you got your schedule and you're keeping it tight
You got something going morning, noon and night
But I got something here I think you're gonna like
Honey, can you squeeze me in

Whoever said it's a man's world
Don't know what he's talking about
You got me working around the clock
Honey trying to figure you out
I know time is money
There's more to life honey
Than how much you can spend
You gotta make a little time for the good times
Honey can you squeeze me in

I got it circled in red on the calendar, baby
You told me that tonight's the night
I've got the Champaign chilled
I've got a gourmet meal, soft music and candlelight
I try to get you on the phone and I get stuck on hold
I guess you keep getting sidetracked
I've been faxing you love notes all day long
I know you got your schedule and your keeping it tight
You got something going morning noon and night
But i got something here I think your gonna like
Honey can you squeeze me in

Who ever said it's a mans world
Sure knows what he's talking about
You got me working around the clock
Honey trying to figure you out
I know time is money
There's more to life honey
Than how much you can spend
You gotta make a little time for the good times
Honey can you squeeze me in

Who ever said it's a mans world
Don't know what he's talking about
You got me working around the clock
Honey trying to figure you out
I know time is money
There's more to life honey
Than how much you can spend
You gotta make a little time for the good times
Honey can you squeeze me in

Let's make a little time for the good times
Honey can you squeeze me in
