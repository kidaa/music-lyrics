Don't come crying to me
It wasn't long ago that you couldn't see
The pain you put me in when you walked out

Don't bring me your rainy day
There's just so much a girl can take
And all the tears in the world won't help you now

I can't tell you it's alright
I won't be holding you tonight
You want the love you threw away
All you're gonna get is a whole lot of pain

Better your heart than mine
Better luck to you the next time
You broke my heart in two
Now it's coming back on you
It's your turn to cry
Better your heart than mine

You come waltzing through my door
Like I ain't been here with you before
Don't tell me that new love done put you down

Don't you tell me it's alright
You won't be holding me tonight
You want the love you threw away
All you're gonna get is a whole lot of pain

Better your heart than mine
Better luck to you the next time
You broke my heart in two
Now it's coming back on you
It's your turn to cry
Better your heart than mine
