Somebody's waiting back home in Dallas
With no idea where she has gone
Got her suitcase all packed up
In the back of the pickup
Got her red knee-high luccheses on
She's on any old two-lane
West bound she knows
'Cause she was chasing her shadow
When the sun finally rose
Man, she's just running
It don't matter where
She figures she'll know where she is when she's there

But she didn't leave nothin' she can't do without
That's enough reason for leavin' no doubt
She rolls down the window, turns up a song
Laughs at the weather and says, hello, I'm gone

She broke down in Lubbock
Got it stuck in reverse
So she hitched down the highway
Her little gun in her purse
Got to the station
Stared at the phone
Found herself thinkin' about calling for home

And she didn't leave nothin' she can't do without
That's enough reason for leavin' no doubt
She dropped in a quarter made herself strong
All that she told him was,  Hello, I'm gone 

Then she called up a tow truck
Said,  Fix up what's wrong
I'm paying in cash boys
Hello, I'm gone
