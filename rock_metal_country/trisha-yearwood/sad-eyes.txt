Every day here you come walkin'
I hold my tongue, I don't do much talkin'
You say you're happy and you're doin' fine
Well go on baby, I got plenty of time, 'cause
Sad eyes never lie
Sad eyes never lie

For a while I've been watching you steady
Ain't gonna move 'till you're good and ready
You show up and then you shy away
But I know pretty soon you'll be
walkin' this way, 'cause
Sad eyes never lie
Sad eyes never lie

Baby, don't you know, I don't care
Don't you know that I've been there
Well if somethin' in the air feels a little unkind
Don't worry darlin', it'll slip your mind

I know you think you'd never be mine
Well that's okay baby, I don't mind
That shy smile's sweet, that's a fact
Go ahead I don't mind the act

Here you come all dressed up for a date
Well, one more step and it'll be too late
Blue, blue ribbon in my hair
You're so sure I'll be standing there
I guess sad eyes never lie
Sad eyes never lie
I guess sad eyes never lie
Sad eyes never lie
