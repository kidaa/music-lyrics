I see you waiting in the shadows
Wonderin' where I've been
Dusty old piano, it's you and me again
My old friend
I'll just have to chance a few lines
Now that we're alone
All that happiness, those silly rhymes
They just don't seem at home now that he's gone

So make it sad, so sad
Like  Faded Love  or  Born To Lose 
Cause it's sad when a love song sings the blues

I see my reflection on the black keys
Where the tears fell from my eyes
I wanna play out every memory
Every last goodbye
Till the whole world cries

So make it sad, so sad
Like  Faded Love  or  Born To Lose 
Cause it's sad when a love song sings the blues
And I don't want to cry alone

Make it sad, so sad
Like  Faded Love  or  Born To Lose 
Cause it's sad when a love song sings the blues
And it's sad when a love song sings the blues
