I think you do, then I think you don't 
Maybe you will, maybe then you won't 
Don't understand, baby why you can't 
Just call it quits if you can't commit 
I know what I want, I know how I feel 
But I don't want your love if it ain't real, no 
I think it's time you made up your mind 
Baby, what's your plan, I need to understand it are you. 

Gonna love me or leave me 
Don't say that you need me 
Not if you really want to let me go 
You don't know how much it hurts me 
Show me some mercy 
Baby just love me or leave me alone 

You needed time so I gave you that 
To figure out where your heart is at 
What do you say, do you go or stay 
Is it no or yes, I shouldn't have to guess if you're 

Gonna love me or leave me 
Don't say that you need me 
Not if you really want to let me go 
You don't know how much it hurts me 
Show me some mercy 
Baby just love me or leave me alone 

You're gonna love me or leave me 
Don't say that you need me 
Not if you really want to let me go 
You don't know how much it hurts me 
Show me some mercy 
Baby just love me or leave me alone
