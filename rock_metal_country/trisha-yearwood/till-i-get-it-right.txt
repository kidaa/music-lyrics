I'll just keep on falling in love
Till I get it right
Right now I'm like a wounded bird
Hungry for the sky
But if I try my wings and try long enough
I'm bound to learn to fly
So I'll just keep on falling in love
Till I get it right

My door to love has opened out
More times than in
And I'm either fool or wise enough
To open it again'
Cause I'll never know what's beyond the mountain
Till I reach the other side
So I'll just keep on falling in love
Till I get it right

If practice makes perfect, then I'm near about as perfect
As I'll ever be in my life
So I'll just keep on falling in love
Till I get it right
