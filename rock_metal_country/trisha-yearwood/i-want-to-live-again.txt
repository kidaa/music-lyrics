Kept my head in the sand so long
It makes a heart real hard to find
I've had enough of a love gone wrong
To last a lifetime
But tear drops on a lonely night
Are never gonna make things right
I've got to get out
From under this cloud

I want to live again
I want to laugh
I want to love
I want to roll those dice
Gonna run the risk
Do the dance
Take a chance
And let the heartache ride
I want to live again

Gonna pull the curtains back
Let a little moonlight in
Run around in a Cadillac
And feel the wheels spin
And when I set my spirit free
I know the past will rest in peace
I don't care what I face
'Cause whatever it takes

I want to live again
I want to laugh
I want to love
I want to roll those dice
Gonna run the risk
Do the dance
Take a chance
And let the heartache ride
I want to live again

Teardrops on a lonely night
Are never gonna make things right
I've got to get out
From under this cloud

I want to live again
I want to laugh
I want to love
I want to roll those dice
Gonna run the risk
Do the dance
Take a chance
And let the heartache ride
I want to live again
