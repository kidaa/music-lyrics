Call me crazy, call me anything you want
I thought that we had something good
Now I find it was only in my mind
Guess I just misunderstood

It seems forever just came to an end
I thought our time had just begun
I will never really understand
Why you would turn from love and run

Fools like me, we never learn
Fools like you are never true

You go your way, baby I'll go mine
I'll go crazy like the wind
I will love you for a long, long time
I'll never have your love again

Fools like me, we never learn
Fools like you are never true
