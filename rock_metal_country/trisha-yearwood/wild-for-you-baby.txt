Struck by the moon, rising too soon
I feel a pain deep inside me
Cold nothern wind, a fist in my chin
Makin' me wild for you baby

What can I do to get back to you
I'm feelin' desperate and lonely
The city's a river of cold misery 
Makin' me wild for you baby

I'm down on my knees
Hear me cry for you baby
Cold misery
I would die for you baby
I pray you will see
These tears I cry

Nights I can't sleep, my tears are cheap
I'm losin' hold of my senses
I can't contain all of this pain
And it's makin' me wild for you baby

I'm down on my knees
Hear me cry for you baby
Cold misery
I would die for you baby
I pray you will see
These tears I cry

Makin' me wild for you baby
Goin' wild for you baby
Hear me cry
Hear me cry
For you baby
