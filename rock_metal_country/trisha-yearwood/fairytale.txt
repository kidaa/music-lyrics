I love Cinderella
'Cause every time that it ends
Somebody gets a fella
Time and again
And the moral of the story is
For everyone there's a love that fits

But it was all
Nothing but a fairytale
Never comin' true
It was all
Nothing but a fairytale
Until I found you

And the one about the rainbow
Every time it's told
Some lucky old so and so
Gets a promised pot of gold
It's some reward for all our time
Something sweet at the end of the line

All of the same stories
All of the same words
All of them told to me
In a way I've never heard
By you
