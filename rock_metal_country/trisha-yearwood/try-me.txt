You don't think you can find true love again... won't you try me?
There's somebody somewhere that you can't forget, so you're not free.
But I don't believe you believe you can ever get by me.
Maybe I could undo all the hurt you've been through...
Try me, try me, try me.

You've got no right to deny a fight till you try me.
Could be all wrong but it could be all right so why don't we?
You need a way to forget yesterday... well that's easy.
If a little heartache is what you need to shake,
Try me, try me, try me.

C'mon now, you got nothin' to lose.
A lifetime of loneliness... what does that prove?
When you count up the odds, there's still no guarantee...
Try me, try me, try me.

When you go to sleep an' you can't find a dream, won't you try me?
A place where you can whisper the secrets you keep... that's what I'll be.
And when you've given up an' there's no one to trust, come and find me.
Then maybe you could leave lonely for good.
Try me, try me, try me.
Try me, try me, try me.
