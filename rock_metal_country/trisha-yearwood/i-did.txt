Did you ever want something so bad
That you could taste it
Did you ever want something
You knew you couldn't have
Well, I did
Did you ever know what it feels like
To get lost in a lover's kiss
Did you ever even want to go there 
Well I did, I did

I took my chances
Laid my heart open wide
I felt the rush, I lost my head
I learned to laugh
Oh but then I learned to cry
I did

Did you ever lose your whole world
And still have no regrets
And did you ever tell yourself
You'd do it all again
Well I did, I did

I took my chances
Laid my heart open wide
I felt the rush, I lost my head
I learned to laugh
Oh but then I learned to cry
I did

Did you ever want something so bad
That you could taste it
I did, I did
