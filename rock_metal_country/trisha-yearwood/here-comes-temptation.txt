When I see you I'm drawn to you
There's a certain look in yours eyes
It's hard to say no to this feeling
No matter how hard I try
Catch me if I'm falling to you
Catch me if I'm breaking away

Oh I'm looking at paradise
Oh I'm looking at paradise
Here comes temptation
Tempting me with you
Here comes temptation
Tempted to get close to you
Here comes temptation
Tempting me with you

If you were to know my secret
I wouldn't feel so shy
Sometimes I think you can see it
It's something I can't hide
All you'd have to do is touch me
And all my resistance would melt away

Oh I'm looking at paradise
Oh I'm looking at paradise
Here comes temptation
Tempting me with you
Here comes temptation
Tempted to get close to you
Here comes temptation
Tempting me with you

I'll have to wait until my chance comes by
I know that you will be mine

Here comes temptation
Tempting me with you
Here comes temptation
Tempted to get close to you
Here comes temptation
Tempting me with you
