It took a while for me to see things as they were 
In the light of truth 
It wasn't you, it was me 
I let myself get used to drowning in the hurt 
Against the wall 
Who'd of thought, it was me 
From there I couldn't even look over my shoulder 
I kicked down all the walls and started all over 

And I don't paint myself into corners anymore 
In a brittle heart of clay 
I threw my brushes away 
The tools of the trade that chained your memory to me 
Are out the door 
I don't paint myself into corners anymore 

When you left you left me with no other choice at all 
But to sink 
To my knees, and cry 
I never knew just how far a soul could fall 
Like a rock 
I couldn't stop, didn't try 
I locked myself behind shades of misery 
But when I let you go, I set myself free 

And I don't paint myself into corners anymore 
In a brittle heart of clay 
I threw my brushes away 
The tools of the trade that chained your memory to me 
Are out the door 
I don't paint myself into corners anymore 

The tools of the trade that chained your memory to me 
Are out the door 
I don't paint myself into corners anymore 

The tools of the trade that chained your memory to me 
Are out the door 
I don't paint myself into corners anymore 

I don't paint myself into corners anymore
