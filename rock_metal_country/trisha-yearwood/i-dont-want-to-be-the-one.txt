Baby, I know something's wrong
'Cause I'm watching the things I say
And it's been this way for too long to be mistaken
I promise myself I won't hide
I'll face what the future brings
Then I let you walk on my pride
And I run from the truth inside
'Cause baby, baby

I don't want to be the one
To say the words  it's over 
Once you let it out, it's done
There's no turning back
I don't want to let you go
Even though my heart cries
There's nowhere left to run
I don't wanna be the one
I don't wanna be the one

Sometimes a moment in time
Can speak like a thousand words
And love I thought was mine is nowhere
My head says I must be blind
But my heart is afraid to see
Maybe I'd rather be blind
I don't want to leave this love behind
Baby, baby

I don't want to be the one
To say the words  it's over 
Once you let it out, it's done
There's no turning back
I don't want to let you go
Even though my heart cries
There's nowhere left to run
After all we've done
I don't wanna be the one
I don't wanna be the one

Baby, I don't want to lose your love
I don't want to be the one
I'm goin' crazy
I don't wanna be the one
