Woke up this mornin', just another day
Got myself out of bed in the usual way
Threw back the curtains and the sun was
shinin'
Well it seems these days
I got such good timin'
Since I let you go
Well what do ya know

Guess I fooled everybody
Said I'd love you till the day that I die
Even if you didn't love me
Sorry baby, I guess I lied
You're gone and I'm still alive
Oh yea

I'm the kind of girl that never fails
To hang on to the past by my fingernails
And I can't help it even I'm amazed
At how much better they look
Painted in pink sorbet
What took me so long
To sing this song

Guess I fooled everybody
Said I'd love you till the day that I die
Even if you didn't love me
Sorry baby, I guess I lied
You're gone and I'm still alive
Oh yea

I said good-bye and I survived
I'm still alive

Since I let you go
Well what do ya know

Guess I fooled everybody
Said I'd love you till the day that I die
Even if you didn't love me
Sorry baby, I guess I lied
You're gone and I'm still alive
Oh yea

I'm still alive Oh yea
Well what do ya know
