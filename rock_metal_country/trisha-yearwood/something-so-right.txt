Words   music By Paul Simon 

You've got the cool water 
When the fever runs high 
You've got the look of lovelight in your eyes 
And I was in crazy motion 
'Til you calmed me down 
It took a little time 
But you calmed me down 

Something goes wrong 
I'm the first to admit it 
First to admit it 
Last one to know 
Something goes right 
Well it's likely to lose me 
It's apt to confuse me 
It's such an unusual sight 
Oh, I can't, can't get used to something so right 
Something so right 

They've got a wall in China 
It's a thousand miles long 
To keep out the foreigners they made it strong 
I've got a wall around me 
That you can't even see 
It took a little time 
To get next to me 

Something goes wrong 
I'm the first to admit it 
First to admit it 
Last one to know 
Something goes right 
Well it's likely to lose me 
It's apt to confuse me 
It's such an unusual sight 
Oh, I swear, I can't get used to something so right 
Something so right 

Some people never say the words "I love you" 
It's not their style to be so bold 
Some people never say those words "I love you" 
Like a child they're longing to be told 

Something goes wrong 
I'm the first to admit it 
First to admit it 
Last one to know 
Something goes right 
Well it's likely to lose me 
It's apt to confuse me 
'cause it's such an unusual sight 
I swear I can't, can't get used to something so right 
Something so right
