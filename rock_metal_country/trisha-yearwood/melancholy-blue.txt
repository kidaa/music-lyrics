Ever since I lost you babe 
I've been here and there 
Looking for some piece of mind, can't find it anywhere 
I went down to Tunica, played me a little blackjack 
Saw a wino on the corner gave my winnings back 

If it was just money 
Baby, I could make it 
But living without you 
Can I take it 
All I see ahead of me 
Is just melancholy blue 
Cause I ain't got no future without you 

I went down to Austin, lots of beautiful people there 
Could have had a better adventure, I just didn't care 
Got a job in California, they sure like my style 
But there's something about that California sun 
Reminds me of your smile 

If it was just money 
Baby, I could make it 
But living without you 
Can I take it 
All I see ahead of me 
Is just melancholy blue 
Cause I ain't got no future without you 

Now and then I go back to Biloxi 
Whenever I feel brave 
Visit that little country church down there 
Lay some flowers on your grave 
You sure got a hold on me, I don't know what to do 
I ain't got no future 
I can't see no future without you
