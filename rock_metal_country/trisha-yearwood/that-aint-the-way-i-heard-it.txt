After you came in late last night
You said you'd been alone
Just needed some room to clear your mind
A little time away from home

Told me you were down on Highway 9
Down by the river bend
But this town has ears and this town has eyes
And a whole lot of so called friends
Oooh that ain't the way I heard it
Oooh that ain't the way I heard it

Don't you think I wanna trust every word you say
Don't you think I wanna look in your eyes
And feel suspicion slip away
When you say you got nothin' to hide
Oooh that ain't the way I heard it
Oooh that ain't the way I heard it

Throw me out a lifeline baby
Offer me a grain of truth
Treat me with a little bit of dignity
I think I deserve that much from you

Gimme one reason for stayin' cool
Tell me they're no good liars
Don't make me play your pathetic fool
Baby, show me that old desire

After you came in late last night
You said you'd been alone
Just needed some room to clear your mind
A little time away from home

Told me you were down on Highway 9
Down by the river bend
But this town has ears and this town has eyes
And a whole lot of so called friends
Oooh that ain't the way I heard it
Oooh that ain't the way I heard it
