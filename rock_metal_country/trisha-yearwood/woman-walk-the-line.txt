Don't bother sittin' at my table
Just because I'm on my own
Yes I'm a woman and I'm lonely
But that don't mean I can't be strong
Once again he's not beside me
And tonight he won't be coming home
So I just need a place to miss my baby
When he goes out to do me wrong

Tonight I want to do some drinkin'
I came to listen to the band
Yes I'm as good as what you're thinkin'
But I don't want to hold your hand
And I know I'm lookin' lonely
But there's nothing here I want to find
It's just the way of a woman
When she goes out to walk the line

Every night's a little longer
Than the one that came before
But when I hear them sing a sad song
I know just what I'm cryin' for
I don't want to stay home waitin'
Don't have to wonder where he's been
He'll be someone else's baby
Before he's in my arms again
