Well it's Christmas time pretty baby
The snow is fallin' on the ground
Yeah, it's Christmas time pretty baby
The snow is fallin' on the ground
Well, you be a real good little baby
Santa Claus is back in town

Got no sleigh with reindeer
Got no sack on my back
You're gonna see me comin'
In a big black cadillac

Well it's Christmas time pretty baby
The snow is fallin' on the ground
Yeah, it's Christmas time pretty baby
The snow is fallin' on the ground
Well, you be a real good little baby
Santa Claus is back in town

Hang up your pretty stockins
Put out the light
Santa Claus is comin'
Down your chimney tonight

Well it's Christmas time pretty baby
The snow is fallin' on the ground
Yeah, it's Christmas time pretty baby
The snow is fallin' on the ground
Well, you be a real good little baby
Santa Claus is back in town
