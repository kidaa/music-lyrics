I'm trying to believe in forever
I'm trying to believe in the little jewel box life we lead
Babe, I get so close sometimes
But all I really know is
I believe that we've been making hard promises to keep

You want me to believe in forever
Do you know how tight I'm holding
Just to keep my grip on yesterday?
I'm trying hard to see the pretty pictures that you paint for me
Do you know how tight I'm holding to hard promises to keep

Promises are like little diamonds
Promises are like little hearts
We meant to give away
I thought you'd want them back someday
I've kept them for you anyway
But I know when I've been given hard promises to keep

Promises are like little diamonds
Promises are like little hearts
We meant to give away
I thought you'd want them back someday
I've kept them for you anyway
But I know when I've been given hard promises to keep
And I know that I've been given hard promises to keep
