If you could read my mind
You'd know how hard I tried
But losing was not my plan
And I can't understand
With all those tears I cried
I should have realized
That I'd never hold you again
And I can't understand

[Chorus:]
I can't understand
Why you left my love behind
I can't understand
But I'll love you 'til the end of time

I search my memory
For the reason you don't love me
You're passing right through my hands
And I can't understand
If love wasn't meant to be
Then why have this hold on me
I tried to be strong, but then
I can't understand

If you could read my mind
Then you'd know how hard I tried
Losing was not my plan
And I can't understand 
So when we meet as friends 
My heart will break again
If that's how the story ends
Then I can't understand

If that's how the story ends
Then I can't understand
