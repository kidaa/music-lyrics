If you can truthfully say
That you've been true just one day
Well that makes one in a row
One in a row, one in a row

And if you can look into my eyes
One time without telling lies
Well that makes one in a row
One in a row, one in a row

Why do I keep lovin' you
After all the things you do?
And just one time
Come into my arms
And be glad that you're in my arms
Well that makes one in a row
One in a row, one in a row

Why do I keep lovin' you
After all the things you do?
And just one time
Come into my arms
And be glad that you're in my arms
Well that makes one in a row
One in a row, one in a row
