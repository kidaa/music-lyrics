What do you do when love comes along 
And offers your heart a chance to move on 
With no guarantees, no safety net 
You trust what you feel, you take that first step 

Just close your eyes 
Reach for the moment 
Before it slips by 
Here is your second chance 
Take it and fly 

The weight of the world, the need to survive 
Has made you believe, that you've got no right 
Then out of the blue, you meet someone 
Who offers a place, warm as the sun 

Just close your eyes 
Reach for the moment 
Before it slips by 
Here is your second chance 
Take it and fly 

Just when you think love is a distant dream 
Oh, fate give you wings 

Just close your eyes 
Reach for the moment 
Before it slips by 
Here is your second chance 
Take it and fly
