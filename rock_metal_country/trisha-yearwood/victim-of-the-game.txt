It took a little time
But I guess you finally learned
That promises get broken
And bridges do get burned
You've been sittin' through the ashes
Just tryin' to find a flame
Holdin' on to nothin'
You're a victim of the game

You were standin' way too close
To see it fall apart
There were things you couldn't hear
'Cause you were listenin' with your heart
You can't say I didn't warn you
Now there's no one else to blame
There's no one quite as blind
As a victim of the game

And it don't matter who you are
It treats everyone the same
All you need's a heart
To be a victim of the game

You know it's really gettin' to you
When you take to tellin' lies
You can try to fool your friends
But you can't look 'em in the eye
There ain't no standin' tall
In the shadow of the shame
When everybody knows
That you're a victim of the game

And it don't matter who you are
It treats everyone the same
All you need's a heart
To be a victim of the game

When I look into your eyes
I can really feel the pain
Starin' in the mirror
At a victim of the game
