If I'd've known the way that this would end 
If I'd've read the last page first 
If I'd've had the strength to walk away 
If I'd've known how this would hurt 

I would've loved you anyway 
I'd do it all the same 
Not a second I would change 
Not a touch that I would trade 
Had I known my heart would break 
I'd've loved you anyway 

It's bittersweet to look back now 
At memories withered on a vine 
Just to hold you close to me 
For a moment in time 

I would've loved you anyway 
I'd do it all the same 
Not a second I would change 
Not a touch that I would trade 
Had I known my heart would break 
I'd've loved you anyway 

Even if I'd seen it comin' 
You'd still have seen me runnin' 
Straight into your arms 

I would've loved you anyway 
I'd do it all the same 
Not a second I would change 
Not a touch that I would trade 
Had I known my heart would break 
I would've loved you anyway 
I would've loved you anyway
