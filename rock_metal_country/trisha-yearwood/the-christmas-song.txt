Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire
Jack Frost Nipping At Your Nose
Yuletide Carols Being Sung By A Choir
And Folks Dresse Up Like Eskimos

Everyboy Knows A Turkey An Some Missletoe
Help To Make The season Bright
Tiny Tots With Their Eyes All Aglow
Will Find It Hard To Sleep Tonight

The Know That Santa's On His Way
He's Loaded Lots Of Toys And Goodies On His Sleigh
And Every Mother's Child Is Gonna Spy
To See If Reindeer Really Know How To Fly

And So I'm Offering This Simple Phrase
To Kids From One To Ninety-Two
Although It's Been Said Many Times Many Ways
Merry Christmas...... To you
