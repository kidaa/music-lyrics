I hear a lonesome dove off in the distance
His cry echoes out through the hills
He's sad that his lover flew off with another
And I know the sorrow he feels

Lonesome dove we're not that different
You sing a sad song but you're not alone
You've been forever forsaken by the one that you love
I know how you feel lonesome dove

I've tried to run from the pain of his memory
But I can't find a place I can hide
And that old lonesome dove is gonna mourn for his love
No matter how far he flies

Lonesome dove we're not that different
You sing a sad song but you're not alone
You've been forever forsaken by the one that you love
I know how you feel lonesome dove
