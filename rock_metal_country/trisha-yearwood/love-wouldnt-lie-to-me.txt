I've played it over in my head
Thought about the words you said
Laid awake in my bed
It's gone, gone, gone

I've tried to make it make some sense
How it came and how it went
It's still the same damn consequence
It's gone, gone, gone

Love shouldn't lie to me
Love couldn't lie to me
Love wouldn't lie to me
But it did

People come and people go
I put on a real good show
How I do it, I don't know
It's gone, gone, gone

It's all hanging by a thread
I try to see a day ahead
I only see the past instead
It's gone, gone, gone

Love shouldn't lie to me
Love couldn't lie to me
Love wouldn't lie to me
But it did

And though
I know
I'll survive

Love shouldn't lie to me
Love couldn't lie to me
Love wouldn't lie to me
But it did
But it did
