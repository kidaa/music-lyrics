Well I drove past your house last night
And I looked in your window
Lately I ain't been feelin' right
And I don't know the cure, no
Still I can't keep from wonderin'
If I still figure in your life

Could you take me back and try me again
Could you try me again

I drove around in this lonesome town
Felt just like a beginner
Friends I saw, they just brought me down
They're so cynical and bitter
Well, I guess I'm just like them now
I never thought I'd turn out like that

Could you take me back and try me again
Could you try me again

Well you say that I cheated
I was not what you needed
Well you're not being kind
When you say you tried
And you know you lied
My hands are tied
Oh, try me again

I'm gonna knock on your door 
'Til you say you'll come back again
And love me some more
Oh, try me again
Could you try me again
Oh, try me again
