It is a reason why I got control
It's the treason, better off alone
Got an answer; individual creed
Got advantage, don't really need 'em

Shouldn't have bothered
Reaching out to fools

They're the patients, conditions; worse
Got the patience, it's in the works
Their impressions are such a waste
My investment is my own fate
