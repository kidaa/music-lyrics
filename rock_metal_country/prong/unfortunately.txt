Confusions born here every day, spinning circles upon my brain. No idea which way to go, roam around without a home. So
fucking lost, invalidated. So brought down demasculated, all the joy just disappeared; another bed full of tears. Coming apart
at the seams, wanna be alone for the rest of my years. Don't come inside, leave it to me to go on unfortunately. Hope
dissolved, degenerated. The negative has penetrated. No wish for sympathy. Its all a mystery to me All my wishes evaporated,
insecurities saturated. So many flaws reappeared. The wrong way I tend to steer.
