You wanna know something
Well I'd give you hell if I could
Still I try so hard not to care
Sold on the excess, chasing the tail to the cage
Joke's on you, you're sliding, of not far to go

You wanna know something
I'd give you hell if I could
You've not far to go
I'd give you hell if I could
I swear you've know far to go

Some are so sad
They pray the bad go away
I itch and sore and still I can't complain
Singing have gun will travel
If all looks so stupid to me
Seconds stutter backward
And not far to go
