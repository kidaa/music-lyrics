Waiting impatiently to put together the facts. Wishing for the best to move slightly against the grain. Upwards. Onwards, I hope
I can rebound and flow. I just hoped for one more chance to prove what I can do. You gotta suffer the facts. You gotta face
the act. The time for this is true. I gotta close the door on you. It's all come into view. I gotta close the door on you. Hating all
similar to all that I've been through. Harping on all particulars that have given me pain. From the onset, the downset, frustration
taken its course. Involving all my bitter thoughts in everything I do.
