you ask for. Being trapped below, is that what you need Careful what you get, it may just get you back. How much more?
Relive the nightmares of the past. Think twice about the ruin that you ask for. Still ignoring all the warnings you see? A lifetime
wronged you. Dark Signs warned you. Feel me self destruct You're gonna get exactly what you're gonna get. You suffer more
and more and then you blame yourself. Those signposts that point to disaster-ignore the signals, you get what you see.
