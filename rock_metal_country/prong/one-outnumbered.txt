what a crying shame talk about pass the buck 
no thought of a change go out 
and get your gun thought we've had out fill of that
they've had enough all of those with good will let the rest
run amok they won't come clean so 
we're bound to lose don't even have
a clue no respect for you dignity 
for whom one more outnumbered bleeding hearts 
that humble to find some shelter from a bloody
shower another cause to blame another soul to judge
