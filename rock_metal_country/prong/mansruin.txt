My whole life counting dimes worried about uncertainty. So I roll the dice before I die, maybe get a little for me. I bet it, bet it
all- Threw everything into a pile. Regret it? Got nothing at all, no guarantees, no pieces of the pie. Got the eyes on you, black
eyes on you-Ruin it for you if they could. Eyes on you, black eyes on you- Mansruin for his own good. High life all the
highlights covered on the plays of the day. Baked out, burnt right out of it, breath fried beyond repair. I tasted it, devoured it,
ballooned right out of sight. A done deal dealt out by fate scored myself a bite of nonlife Fucked out, fucked out of everything,
drained at the end of each day. A red cent, no pennies from heaven taken for a chump for life.
