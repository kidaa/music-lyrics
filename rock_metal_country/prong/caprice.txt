Put me right through the ringer run around with eyes on whatever. Cut me right down to half of a member-Mended back given
no hope. Scheming minds new intentions-leave it broke flat begging for more You've made up your mind Whatever comes to
your head can never rely on nothing Everything points to the wrong direction. Everything leading to any early decline. Can't
take this any longer-I'll tell you right now, hate's on the rise. Just can't deal with anymore wavering-Can't fit into anymore lies.
Take your eyes to a brand new picture. Reach for one more impulse buy. It's me the loser, did everything wrong. Go ahead
with all your craving. Go ahead yearn for more.
