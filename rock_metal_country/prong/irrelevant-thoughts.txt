Look, Listen, Learn

All I've been taught
All that confused me
Irrelevant thoughts
All just to use me
For society's will
Denied my own person
But there's still a will
For my very own lesson

Now I know nothing that my mind can't create
Now they'll know something of the mind they createLook, Listen, Learn
It's time they learn

Rite to my will
Rite to my impulse
Territorial rites
Right to your downfall
