Why should I devalue my position? Do I need to be a part of the fold? Don't need any sort of reason. I'll just go out and follow
my own path. Take note of this: Anyone can trip. Take note of this: You can walk with the best. Walking with the finest. Why
should I sell myself short? Should I lower my ideals and standards? Must I settle for hand me downs? I deserve the best my
mind can do. I can do. I think I know which road to go. It leads up to the very top. I don't need your sense of direction. You
can just stumble on and on.
