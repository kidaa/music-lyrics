more conquest more proud division 
another rape for a strong man it scares you into submission 
now's the time to face the home rule. 
it's our find, 
never give it back our kind 
shut'em out shine a light bring'em out 
take no flight never give in more conquest more
proud division another rape for a strong man it scares you 
into submission now's the time to face the home rule all alone never give
in hold tight what you know birthright gift of pride look down upon your foe
