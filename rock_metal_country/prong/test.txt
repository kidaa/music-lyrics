Lights shine from the burning faces 
I don't care if it blinds me shadows gesture me 
for panic but there's never anywhere to flattered
from media sized rages never to miss the wicked ways 
not so easy to get fooled by emergency broadcast rule it's a relapse! 
a point of collapse! 
god bless my soul it's up to you now crawl on all of us another message 
attempt to scare us again 
rejection of all what is said 
I listen to only what's discordant like the sting of razor sharp glass 
enjoy the scene of torches burning laugh at a poisoned gasp this is only a test 
this is only a test this is only a test sit and watch windows 
the plodding flames lick a dozen stars
discredit any hopeful discerning rejoice the thought of future scars
