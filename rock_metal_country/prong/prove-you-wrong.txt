Diggin' for answers you fall in a hole
Lessons of nonsense shall cast the first stone
Pontifical preachings past now quick to forget 'em
I'm depending on no one I distrust and oppose

Prove you, prove you wrong
You can bet on it, I'll prove you wrong
Prove you, prove you wrong
Depend on it, I'll prove you wrong

Quest for solutions
You ain't gonna get one here
Why waste my breath upon the ears of the deaf man
Skeptic acceptance caution
Fraudulent cause
Dependence on no one best distrust and oppose
