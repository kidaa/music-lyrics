Positively blind
You can't see you're opaque from the light
Looking at the bright can be negative
Road turns only right and runs narrow
You're detoured out of sight
But the first one to arrive at the conclusive

Unaware of signs before you, ignorant of times
Choose to undermine the clear truth
Everything must shine in your life
Polishing your pride
No one can belie optimistic proof

All of those so proud
Just forget about it
Your future's further in doubt
All of those so proud
Won't improve upon it
Their future's further in doubt
