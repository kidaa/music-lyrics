i'll take no blame for some other's mistake 
a fossil of the past continue underrate the ability to end a life 
no stability in opinions not alike someone 
should take me out of your misery 
if i should take it any further, 
i'll end it...you out of this misery. 
you've got life,
blood on our hands, 
this is no life. 
i will not shame for a deed undone 
i'm reaching for the stars 
i spit at the sun. 
i'll take the liberty
to get you off my back 
i want your history taken off the map.
