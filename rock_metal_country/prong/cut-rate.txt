you try to take all the challenge out of all of our lives 
you make it all too predictable with your white wash lives you see, 
you got to show me the torment and all the despair all those bloodless bullet holes 
are more than we can bear with the plastic coverings and
the cut-rate display no renewal of the pleasurable 
with no image of decay you go for the stability and what do you get some real
vivid misfortune a cause now an effect clean sweep
