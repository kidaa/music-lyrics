I just know its all gone wrong, feeling all the pressures can't weather the storm. 'Cause I kept myself in a cage all wound up
and filled up with rage. Forgive oneself of nothing at all-Pounding my head against the wall. Guilt ridden and bound to lose.
Puncture my wounds, won't see the truth. I looked in the mirror, what did I see? One man bitter with apathy. The whole thing
turned out to be a joke. But I'm not laughing. I'm without hope. Its never well thought out, just my instant demise. Haste and
hatred my inner desire. its all so bitter the hurt inside. Haste and hatred my inner desire. Ruptured I've lost it all. My heart
ripped out can't stand at all. 'Cause I've cost my brain to never relax. Picking at all the torturous facts.
