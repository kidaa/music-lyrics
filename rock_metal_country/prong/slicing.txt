Never had a thought so how can you see me? A man without a mind can never judge evenly. Forever passing judgment
compared to a fraud. I'll never pare up. I'll only distort your sight; only distort your sight. It don't matter, knife in your hand. I'll
cut you down with a knife in my head. It don't matter knife in my hand. You can never mend it with a knife in your head. I want
a slice, can I carve evenly? A man with no part moves so passively. Can I cut you up, can I say you're a fraud? You'll never
pare up, I'll only destroy your size.
