Time for double standards
Now who shall be blamed
With the change of weather
Scapegoats are acclaimed
Acts of no reason: populous response
Opinions are like assholes
Everyone's one

All these contradictions
Are bound to confuse
What wrong will you choose?

Can I ask a question?
Or am I out of line
Some more lip service
Will smooth it out nice
