My mind wanders as I,m trying not to fall in love with you
'Cause everytime I wake I ponder on my mistakes of
what I said, it is always my esteem that I sure lose
playing those stupid games as I always end up chasing you

[Chorus]
I can't help myself anymore
rehearsing my thoughts as I,m to scared to come to your door
I pushed it all aside just stand next to you
Now you won't talk to me for something I didn't do
It's not going to work

And I'm trying not to think of you

I'm all confused as I think of the things that I should do

I'm all shook up as I get all nervous inside

My emotions are something that I will always hide
