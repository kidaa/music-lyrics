Now it happens again 
she's cool, she's hot, she's my friend 
try hard when things fall apart 
one excuse breaks my heart 

She's unstoppable, unpredictable 
I'm so jaded, calculated wrong 

Please take, me home 
too late, it's gone 
I bet, you're sad 
this is the best time we ever had 

Try hard when things fall apart 
I guess there's no need to start 
give in, forget the past 
try hard to make these things last 

She's unstoppable, unpredictable 
I'm so jaded, calculated wrong 

please take, me home 
too late, it's gone 
I bet, you're sad 
this is the best time we ever had 

Please take, me home 
too late, it's gone 
I bet, you're sad 
this is the best time we ever had 

Try hard when things fall apart 
ah yes, this breaks my heart 
give in, forget the past 
try hard to make these things best, they last 
go!

She's unstoppable, unpredictable 
I'm so jaded, I calculated wrong 

Mark's wrong 
Travis is wrong 
I'm right 

Please take, me home 
too late, it's gone 
I bet, you're sad 
this is the best time we ever had 

Please take, me home 
too late, it's gone 
I bet, you're sad 
this is the best time we ever had
