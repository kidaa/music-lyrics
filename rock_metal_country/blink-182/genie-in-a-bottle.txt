I'm a genie in a bottle baby, come, come, come on and let me out
I'm a genie in a bottle baby, come, come, come on and let me out
thirteen miles down the road lives a young boy
he's got jet black hair and blue greens eyes and he's mine
and every now and then, he and I, sit together on the porch, 
and I take off his pants and fuck him from behind
and I love him for his heart and soul
and I love his wrinkled scrotum too
so if you see us passing by on some dreary rainy day
take a look at the young boy and his naked asshole
