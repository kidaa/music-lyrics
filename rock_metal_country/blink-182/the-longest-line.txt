In the darkest tunnel it's nice to see a light
not just a headlight
like the one that's heading right for me
it would be nice if things could turn out right
turn out right yeah
don't think I'll ever see the day

I must have done something wrong
or maybe pissed off God
I think of Chinese food when I think of life
that's sweet and sour
my life is sweet as saccharine
you know three week old milk and grapes are not
not the same, no
I am the one Johnny Carcinogen

I must have fucked with some witch
in turn she cursed me, cursed my life
at the end of the longest line
that's where I will always be
if you need to find me, just go to
the end of the longest line

But officer that was a yellow light
the light was red, son
insubordination, reckless driving
I must be wrong, this can't be right
I don't belong, this world is much to dangerous
for someone lacking luck, like me

At the end of the longest line
that's where I will always be
if you need to find me, just go to
the end of the longest line
at the end of the longest line
that's where I will always be
at the end of the longest line
