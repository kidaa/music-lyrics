Seen enough to eye you
but I've seen to much to try you
it's always weirdness while you
dig too much to fry you
the weirdness flows between us
freak scene just can't believe us
why can't it be cool and free us

Seen enough to eye you
but I've seen to much to try you
it's always weirdness while you
dig too much to fry you
the weirdness flows between us
freak scene just can't believe us
why can't it be cool and free us

It's so fucked, I can't believe it
if there's a way I wish I'd see it
how could it work, just can't conceive us
oh what a mess it's just to leave it

Sometimes I don't thrill you
sometimes I think I'll kill you
just don't let me fuck up will you
cause when I need a friend it's still you.
