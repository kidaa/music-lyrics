6 bottles went down the drain, 
one hours waste of time, 
I'd ask if you feel the same, 
still pushing that chance to try, 
your breath in this cool room chill, 
long hair that blows side to side, 
you speak and make time stand still, 
and each time you walk right on by...

Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me, forever and after.

Can't count all the eyes that stare, 
can't count all the things they see, 
she kills with no life to spare, 
just victims are left to bleed, 
one drink and the pain goes down, 
soft shadows lay by her feet, 
lay soft as you slowly drown, 
lay still while you fall asleep. Fall asleep

Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me, forever and after.
And afterand afterand after

Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me
Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me

Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me, forever and after.
Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me, forever and after.

My dearest
I've missed you very very much since that last night we were together
And will hold that night especially in my memories for years to come
I've been turning it over and over in my mind lately
I've read you're letter through at least 4 times
And will probably read it more times before I'm through
I've been sitting here
Looking at you're picture and getting more home sick every minute
I've wanted that picture more than anything else I know of
Except of course you, you're self
I keep thinking of you darling
I keep wishing I could be home with you
I want to leave in the worst possible way so I could come home to see you But:
Things don't look to good on that subject
This war has spoiled a lot of things for everyone I guess
I've never been so lonesome in my life as I am right now
I'm completely lost without you darling
I never realized I could miss anyone person so much
I just hope it won't be too much longer till I'm able to be with you again
And live a sane and normal life.
