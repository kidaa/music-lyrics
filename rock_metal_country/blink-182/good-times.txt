Good times, good times, good times
oh baby, good times

Good Times
any time you meet a payment
good times
any time you feel free
good times
any time you're out from under

Not getting hassled, not getting hustled
keeping' your head above water,
making a wave when you can

Temporary lay offs
good times
easy credit rip offs

scratching' and surviving
good times
hanging in a chow line
good times
aint't we lucky we got 'em
good times
