From the walls of Tokyo
down in London town's a go-go
with the record selection
and the mirror's reflection
I'll be dancing with myself

when there's no one else in sight
in a crowded, lonely night
I wait so long for my love vibration
and I'm dancing with myself

Oh, oh, I'm dancing with myself
Oh, oh, dancing with myself
when there's nothing to lose
and there's nothing to prove
I'll be dancing with myself
Oh, oh, oh, oh

If I looked all over the world
and there's every type of girl
but their empty eyes seem to pass me by
And leave me dancing with myself

So let's sink another drink
cause it'll give me time to think
if I had the chance, I'd ask the world dance
I'd be dancing with myself

Oh, oh, I'm dancing with myself
Oh, oh, dancing with myself
if I had the chance, I'd ask the world dance
I'd be dancing with myself
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh 3x
Marky!
Oh, oh, oh, oh

If I looked all over the world
and there's every type of girl
but their empty eyes seem to pass me by
And leave me dancing with myself

So let's sink another drink
cause it'll give me time to think
if I had the chance, I'd ask the world dance
I'd be dancing with myself

Oh, oh, I'm dancing with myself
Oh, oh, dancing with myself
if I had the chance, I'd ask the world dance
if I had the chance, I'd ask the world dance
if I had the chance, I'd ask the world dance

Oh, oh, oh, oh 9x
yeah, in a sweat 5x, sweat! 10x
