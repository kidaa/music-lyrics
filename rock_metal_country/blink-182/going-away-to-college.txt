Please take me by the hand 
It's so cold out tonight 
I'll put blankets on the bed 
I won't turn out the light 

Just don't forget to 
Think about me 
And I won't forget you 
"I'll write you once a week", she said 

Why does it feel the same 
To fall in love or break it off 
And if young love is just a game 
Then I must have missed the kick off 

Don't depend on me 
To ever follow through on 
Anything, but 
I'd go through Hell for you and 

I haven't been this scared in a long time 
And I'm so unprepared, so here's your valentine 
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody 
This world's an ugly place, but you're so beautiful to me 

I'll think about the times 
She kissed me after class and 
She put up with my friends 
I acted like an ass 

I'd ditch my lecture 
To watch the girls play soccer 
Is my picture 
Still hanging in her locker? 

I haven't been this scared in a long time 
And I'm so unprepared, so here's your valentine 
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody 
This world's an ugly place, but you're so beautiful 

I haven't been this scared in a long time 
And I'm so unprepared, so here's your valentine 
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody 
This world's an ugly place, but you're so beautiful
