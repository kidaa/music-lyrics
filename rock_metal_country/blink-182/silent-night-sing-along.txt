[Mark:] Can we turn off all the lights and have everyone bring up there lighters like its a big rock show, please?
[Mark:] Everyone bring out your lighters cause I know you all smoke pot
[Mark:] Now I want you all to sing along with me...

Silent night
Holy night
All is calm
All is bright
'Round yon virgin
Mother and child
Holy infant 
So tender and mild
