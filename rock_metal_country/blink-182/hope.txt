Why can't you see you torture me?
You're already thinking 'bout someone else
When he comes home you'll be in his arms
And i'll be gone
But i know, my day will come
I know someday, i'll be the only one

You wait for his spark
You know it'll turn you on
He's gonna make you feel
The way you wanna feel
When he starts to lie,
Makes you cry,
You know i'll be there
My day will come
I know someday i'll be the only one

Call me selfish
Call me what you like
I think its right
To want someone for all your own
And not share her love
And i'll have my way
And you won't have a say
Anyway
You don't stand a chance!

You wait for his cock
You know it'll turn you on
He's gonna make you feel
The way you wanna feel
When he starts to lie,
Makes you cry,
You know i'll be there
My day will come
I know someday i'll be the only one

My day will come
I know someday i'll be the only one

You want perfection
See your self-destruction
You don't know what you want
It's gonna take you years to find out!
Not giving up
And when you've had enough
You'll take your bruised little head and
You'll come running right back to me!

I will be the only one,
I will be the only one...
