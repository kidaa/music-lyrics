Its hard to wake up, when the shades have been pulled shut
This house is haunted, its so pathetic, it makes no sense at all
Im ripe with things to say, the words rot and fall away
What stupid poem could fix this home, I'd read it every day

So here's your holiday,
hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away
It was mine, so when your dead and gone,
will you remember this night, twenty years now lost,
it's not right.

Their anger hurts my ear, been running strong for seven years
Rather then fix the problem, they never solve them, it makes no sense at all
I see them everyday, we get along so why can't they
If this is what he wants, and its what she wants,then whys there so much pain

So here's your holiday,
hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away.
It was mine,so when your dead and gone,
will you remember this night, twenty years now lost,
it's not right.

So here's your holiday,
hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away.
It was mine,so when your dead and gone,
will you remember this night, twenty years now lost,
it's not right
it`s not right 
it`s not right
it`s not right
