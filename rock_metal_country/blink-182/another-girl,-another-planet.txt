Always flirt with death
I look ill, but I don't care about it
I can face your threats
Stand up straight & tall and shout about it

I think I'm on another world with you
I'm on another planet with you

You always get under my skin
I don't find it irritating
You always play to win
I don't need rehabilitating

Another girl, another planet
Another girl, another planet

Space travel's in my blood
And there ain't nothing I can do about it
Long journeys wear me out but
I know I can't live without it

Another girl is loving you now
Another planet, is holding you down
Another planet
