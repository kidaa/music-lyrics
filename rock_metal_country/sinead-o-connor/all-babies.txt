All babies are born saying God's name 
Over and over, 
All born singing God's name 
All babies are flown from the Universe 
From there they're lifted by the hands of angels 
God gives them the stars to use as ladders 
She hears their calls 
She is mother and father 
All babies are born out of great pain 
Over and over 
All born into great pain 
All babies are crying 
For no-one remembers God's name 
All babies are born saying God's name 
Over and over, 
All born singing God's name 
All babies are flown from the Universe 
From there they're lifted by the hands of angels 
God gives them the stars to use as ladders 
She hears their calls 
She is mother and father 
All babies are born out of great pain 
Over and over 
All born into great pain 
All babies are crying 
For no-one remembers God's name 

There's only love 
There's only love 
There's only love in this world 
There's only love 
There's only love 
There's only love in this world
