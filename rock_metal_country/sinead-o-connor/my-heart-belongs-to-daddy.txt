While tearing off 
a game of golf 
I may make a play for the caddy 
But if I do 
I don't follow through 
Cause my heart 
belongs to Daddy 
If I invite a boy some night 
To dine on my fine 
finnan haddie 
I just adore his 
asking for more 
But my heart belongs to Daddy 
Yes my heart belongs to Daddy 
So I simply couldn't be bad 
Yes my heart belongs to Daddy 
Lalala, lalala, lalala 
So I want to warn you, laddie 
Tho' I know you perfectly swell 
That my heart belongs to Daddy 
Cause my daddy, he treats me so well
