Young woman with a drink in her hand 
She like to listen to rock and roll 
She moves with the music 
`Cause it never gets old 
It's the only thing 
That never gets old 
Young man in a quiet place 
Got a hawk on his arm 
He loves that bird 
Never does no harm 
It's the only thing 
That never can do no harm 
Must be the only thing 
That never can do no harm 
Sun setting on the avenue 
Everyone walks by 
They live their life under cover 
Being blind 
Being blind 
Being blind
