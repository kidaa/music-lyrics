A Perfect Indian is he 
Remembering him life is sweet 
Like a weeping willow 
His face on my pillow 
Comes to me still in my dreams 
And there I saw a young baby 
A beautiful daughter was she 
A face from a painting 
Red cheeks and teeth aching 
Her eyes like a wild Irish sea 
On a table in her yellow dress 
For a photograph feigned happiness 
Why in my life is that the only time 
That any of you will smile at me 
I'm sailing on this terrible ocean 
I've come for my self to retrieve 
Too long have I been feeling like Lir's children 
And there's only one way to be free 
He's shy and he speaks quietly 
He's gentle and he seems to me 
Like the elf-arrow 
His face worn and harrowed 
Is he a daydreamer like me 
I'm sailing on this terrible ocean 
I've come for my self to retrieve 
Too long have I been feeling like Lir's children 
And there's only one way to be free
