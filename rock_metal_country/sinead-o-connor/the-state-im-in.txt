I'm circling around the Sun 
Hoping for a chance to see 
You above everyone 
To rescue me from this heat 
I'm wating for night to fall 
And it's been days 
Are you sorry yet? 
You took our one and final breath 
When the flag was halfway down 
Just look at me now... 
Oooooh- It's like a breeze blowing deep beneath my skin 
Oooooh- Won't you help me out of the state I'm in 
Oooooh- I can't stand myself since you've been gone 
There's nothing there to lean upon 
Walk into a photograph 
That waiter took so well 
Oooh if I could only laugh 
Like that girl did at some hotel 
I call out to anyone 
But not too loud 
I'm not ready yet 
To share the phone or TV set 
It's long way to come 
Out of this one... 
Oooooh- It's like a breeze blowing deep beneath my skin 
Oooooh- Won't you help me out of the state I'm in 
Oooooh- I can't stand myself since you've been gone 
There's nothing there to lean upon 
And now it seems so fatal 
The last stone we left uncradled 
And I ask you are you sorry yet? 
Are you sorry yet? 
Cuz I may never come 
Out of this one... 
Ooooh- It's blowing deep 
Ooooh- And I can't get out 
Oooooh- No I can't get out, I can't get out 
Ooooh- It's blowing deep beneath my skin 
The state I'm in 
This is the state I'm in 
The state I'm in 
This is the state ... I'm ... in ...
