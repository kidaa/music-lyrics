Afraid, but you will not run 
Alone, thy will be done 
confessed, but you still feel the shame 
Bring me into your arms again 
Heroine 
Heroine 
Heroine 
Heroine 
touch these eyes with a broken smile 
touch my mouth with your furrowed brow 
with my heart feel my shame 
Lead me into rest again 
Heroine 
Heroine 
Heroine 
Heroine 
The night is long, 
but the day will come 
with promises were the chosen one 
Soak the sea 
Sweet tastering 
fall tonight into my arms again 
Heroine 
Heroine 
Heroine 
Heroine 
The night is long 
but the day will come 
with promises were the chosen one 
Soak the sea 
Sweet tastering 
fall the night into the light of day
