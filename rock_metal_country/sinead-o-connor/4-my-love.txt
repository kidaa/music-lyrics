4 my love this night I have 
Your baby in my belly 
All my life I'll love you for 
The life you've given me 
So love no longer be frightened 
I will never leave you 
Sleep safe in the night now love 
Sad dreams never come true 
You'll always find that one who loves you 
You'll always find that one who loves you 
Oh my love your love 4 Ireland 
Will not be in vain 
 4 whomsoever God place 
No man can take away  
So love no longer be violent 
God's children deserve to 
sleep safe in the night now love 
and have their dreams come true 
Ah come back and find 
That one who loves you 
Ah climb back inside 
The one who loves you 
And feel what it's like 
To love one who loves you 
Ah come back and find that one
