You're jealous 
You just can't stand to see me get along without you 
Like I do, you told me to 
Now you're jealous 
You don't know how hard it was to be alone without you 
And wanting you, like I do 
I would have stayed if you'd wanted 
But you said I treat you so badly 
I can't be forgiven 
You know I have done anything 
To make it through with you 
But I don't deserve to be lonely 
Just cuz you say I do 
You're jealous 
You don't know how hard it is to be a woman in love with you 
When you're so cruel, and so jealous 
You don't think about anybody's feelings but your own 
Are you coming home? 
I would have stayed if you'd wanted 
Would have been willing 
But you said I treat you so badly 
I can't be forgiven 
You know I would have done anything 
To make it through with you 
But I don't deserve to be lonely 
Just cuz you say I do 
So if you're gonna go you've gotta go and if you're stayin stay 
Cuz I can't take the pain you keep leavin when you go away 
If you're gonna go you've gotta go and if you're stayin stay 
Cuz I can't take the pain you keep leavin when you go away 
I don't deserve to be lonely 
I don't deserve to cry 
I don't deserve to be lonely
