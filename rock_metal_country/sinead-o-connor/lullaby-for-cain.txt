From the silence, from the night 
Comes a distant lullaby. 
Cry, remember that first cry, 
Your brother's standing by, 
And lot of loved 
Beloved sons of mine. 
Sing a lullaby. 
Mother is close by. 
Innocent days 
Such innocent eyes 
And he stole your brother's life, 
Came home murdered, peace of mind. 
Left you nightmares on the pillow. 
Sleep now 

Soul, surrendering your soul, 
The heart in you not whole 
For love, but love walked on 
Cast into the dawn 
Branded with the mark. 
Oh, shame of Cain. 

From a garden of those light 
To a wilderness of night. 
Sleep now 
sleep now
