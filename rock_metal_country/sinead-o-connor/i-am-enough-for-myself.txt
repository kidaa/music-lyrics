Oh the days are long 
'Til the baby comes 
God will take all fear 
If you say this clear 
I am enough for myself 
I don't need anything else 
I am enough for myself 
I am in your heart 
I only can have that part 
I am in your dreams 
I only can touch these things 
I am who gives the breath 
I am your nakedness 
I am nothing at all 
And I am singing your soul 
I am that am I 
I am that am I 
I am that I am 
I am enough for myself
