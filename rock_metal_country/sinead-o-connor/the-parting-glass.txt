Oh, all the money e'er I had, I spent it in good company. And
all the harm that ever I've done, alas it was to none but me.
And all I've done for want of wit to mem'ry now I can't recall; So
fill to me the parting glass, Good night and joy be with you all.

If I had money enough to spend, and leisure time to sit awhile. There
is a fair maid in this town, that sorely has my heart beguiled. Her
rosy cheeks and ruby lips, I own, she has my heart in thrall; Then
fill to me the parting glass, Good night and joy be with you all.

Oh, all the comrades e'er I had, they're sorry for my going away. And
all the sweethearts e'er I had, they'd wished me one more day to stay.
But since it falls unto my lot, that I should rise and you should not, I
gently rise and softly call, Goodnight and joy be with you all.
