You're near, that moment's here 
I'm almost in your arms 
Tonight, the mood is right 
I'm almost in your arms 
One sigh, one word and I 
Will rush to your embrace 
Say that certain word, 
sigh that certain sigh 
And with all my heart, 
to your arms I'll fly 
It's strange, 
how we are changed 
by the things that seem so small 
One look can write a book 
One touch can say it all 
We know those nights of love 
And now we found our way 
I'm almost in your arms 
to stay 
You're near, that moment's here 
I'm almost in your arms 
Tonight, the mood is right 
I'm almost in your arms 
One sigh, one word and I 
Will rush to your embrace 
Say that certain word, 
sigh that certain sigh 
And with all my heart, 
to your arms I'll fly 
It's strange, 
how we are changed 
by the things that seem so small 
One look can write a book 
One touch can say it all 
We know those nights of love 
And now we found our way 
I'm almost in your arms almost in your arms 
almost in your arms 
to stay
