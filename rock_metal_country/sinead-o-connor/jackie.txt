Jackie left on a cold, dark night 
Telling me he'd be home 
Sailed the seas for a hundred years 
Leaving me all alone 
And I've been dead for twenty years 
I've been washing the sand 
With my ghostly tears 
Searching the shores for my Jackie-oh 
I remember the day the young man came 
He said,  your Jackie's gone 
We got lost in the rain  
And I ran to the beach 
And laid me down  You're all wrong , I said 
And they stared at the sand 
 That man knows that sea 
Like the back of his hand 
He'll be back some time 
laughing at you  
And I've been waiting all this time 
For my man to come 
Take his hand in mine 
And lead me away 
To unseen shores 
I've been washing the sand 
With my salty tears 
Searching the shore 
For these long years 
And I'll walk the seas forever more 
Till I find my Jackie oh 
Till I find my Jackie oh 
Till I find my Jackie oh Jackie oh 
Jackie oh 
Jackie oh
