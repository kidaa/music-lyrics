You had plenty money 
Nineteen fourty one 
You lost it all 
And then, where do you run? 
Why don't you do right? 
Like some other men do? 
Get out of here and 
get me some money too 
Yo'sittin' down wondering 
what it's all about 
If you ain't got no money 
they will put you out 
Why don't you do right? 
Like some other men do? 
Just get out of here and 
get me some money too 
If you had prepared 
twenty years ago 
You wouldn't have wand'ring 
now from do'to do' 
Why don't you do right? 
Like some other men do? 
Get out of here and 
get me some money too 
Why don't you do right? 
Like some other men do? 
Like some other men do? 
Like some other men do?
