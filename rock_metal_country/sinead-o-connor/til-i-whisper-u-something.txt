Sure hate to see u looking so sad 
Delicate man it needn't be that bad 
U sit with me and I will listen 
You'll feel much better when u open 
U said all u want was a good time 
It's a big hill u have to climb 
And u got to be willing 
U stand tall and u be strong 
U have ruthless compassion 
For yourself and everyone 
Yeah it's hard but it can be done 
I know you're every right to feel grief 
You've not had anything that u need 
But u put your head on my shoulder 
'Till I whisper u something 
'Till I whisper u something 
It don't take much to have a good time 
A lot of lovemakingand a little wind 
And u got to be willing 
U stand tall 
U have ruthless compassion 
For yourself and everyone 
Yeah it's hard but it can be done 
U put your head on my shoulder 
'Till I whisper u something 
'Till I whisper u something 
It's a long walk towards a good time 
Like a big hill u have to climb 
And u got to be willing 
It don't take much to have a good time 
A lot of lovemakingand a little wind 
And u got to be willing 
If you've never seen a good time 
If you've never seen a good time 
If you've never seen a good time 
How would u recognise one 
How would u recognise one 
How would u even find one 
How would u, if you've never seen a good time 
If you've never seen a good time 
If you've never seen a good time 
How would u recognise one
