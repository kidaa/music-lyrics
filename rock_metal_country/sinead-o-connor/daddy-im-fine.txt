I was born in Dublin town 
Where there was not too much going on down 
For girls whose only hope 
Was not to find a man who could piss in a pot 
So early I heard my first guitar 
And I knew I wanted to be a big star 
And I told my poor worried father 
Said I ain't gonna go to school no more 
Cuz see I wanna look cool and I wanna look good 
With my hair slicked back and my black leather boots 
Wanna stand up tall with my boobs upright 
And feel real hot when the makeup's nice 
I get sexy underneath the lights 
Like I wanna fuck every man in sight 
Baby come home with me tonight 
Make you feel good make you feel all right 
I'm going away to London 
I got myself a big fat plan 
Gonna be a singer in a rock 'n' roll band 
And I'm gonna change everything I can 
Sorry to be disappointing 
Wasn't born for no marrying 
Wanna make my own living singing 
Strong independent Pagan woman singing 
And I feel real cool and I feel real good 
Got my hair shaved off and my black thigh boots 
I stand up tall with my pride upright 
And I feel real hot when the makeup's nice 
I get sexy underneath them lights 
Like I wanna fuck every man in sight 
Baby come home with me tonight 
Make you feel good make you feel all right 
I'm glad I came here to London 
I've myself some big fat fun 
And I have even made some mon' 
I got the most angelic son 
My baby daughter is golden 
And I do what I like for fun 
And I'm happy in my prime 
Daddy I'm fine I'm fine Daddy I'm fine 
Daddy I'm fine I'm fine Daddy I love you
