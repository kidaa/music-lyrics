I'm feelin' mighty lonesome, 
haven't slept a wink 
I walk the floor and watch 
the door and in between 
I drink black coffee 
Love's hand me down broom 
I'll never know a Sunday 
In this weekday room 
I'm talkin' to the shadows 
One o'clock till four 
And Lord, how slow 
the moments go 
When all I do is pour 
black coffee 
Since the blues caught my eye 
I'm hangin'out on Monday 
my Sunday dreams to dry 
Now a man is born to go a lovin' 
A woman's born to weep and fret 
To stay at home and 
tend her over 
And drown het past regrets 
in coffee and cigarettes! 
I'm moanin' all the mornin' 
And mournin' all the night 
And in between it's nicotine 
And not much heart to fight 
black coffee 
Feelin'low as the ground 
It's drivin' me crazy 
This waiting for my baby 
To maybe come around
