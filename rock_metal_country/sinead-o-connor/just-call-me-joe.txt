We came here across the great divide 
Into the city, slander all eyes 
We found a great love as we fell inside 
They could not touch us as we'd go by 
I've seen you the first time in Trogny's bar 
But I'll see you later, we'll talk of black 
We'll meet up for sure, oh will we not? 
Away from all of the friends that you've got 
Oh no, oh no 
I said don't call me sir 
just call me Joe 
Don't call me lady 
Just call me Joe 
Don't call me mister 
Oh, just call me Joe 
Don't call me sweetheart 
Just call me Joe 
You wear the best clothes that I've ever seen 
I've seen your light and your poetry 
And it's the best thing that there's ever been 
You're both the beauty and the beast 
That's how it is and that's how it end 
Into another city where you live far away 
That's how it is and that's how it end 
You've seen my face but you've never heard my name 
Oh no, oh oh 
I said don't call me sir 
Oh, just call me Joe 
Don't call me lady 
Just call me Joe 
Don't call me mister 
Just call me Joe 
Don't call me sweetheart 
Just call me Joe 

Leslie Winer lyrics: 

 We never said goodbye 
I said carry your purse with you now 
I have regards to you about our night this weekend 
and I'm giving you information, the leaves, the leaves they like your teeth
I'm not going to force you now, 
come on I had this, this annoying dream 
this technology of ours there's this place that is ever so refined that no one knows 
and a storm boomer with light action 
life is the shadow of a fish, 
multiple electrical systems you fly through, 
traffic lights that may open a door, 
a bunch of computer systems as clear as a cut crystal painting 
infinite selections as clear as a crystal ballweapons, tanks, lasers, and aircraft moving 
across the sky, 
huge missles, and nuclear warheads that stand out more than anything 
ultimate satellites, spy cameras, infared sensors, 
you, you can hear the thunder, postive thinking 
and start to say: I'll make more human development practices, 
you don't have to go and stop your field practices 
such as: human rights violations, 
yeah come up and see me sometime 
if you never ever want to intensify all communication, 
listening to what I'm not saying over and over, 
I feel as if some traveller returned
