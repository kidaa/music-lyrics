I have seen the lark soar high at morn 
Heard his song up in the blue 
I have heard the blackbird pipe his note 
The thrush and the linnet too 
But there's none of them can sing so sweet 
My singing bird as you. 

If I could lure my singing bird 
From his own cozy nest 
If I could catch my singing bird 
I would warm him on my breast 
For there's none of them can sing so sweet 
My singing bird as you. 
My singing bird as you. 
My singing bird as you.
