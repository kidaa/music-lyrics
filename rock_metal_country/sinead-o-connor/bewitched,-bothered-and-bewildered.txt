After one whole quart of brandy 
Like a daisy I'll awake 
With no bromo-seltzer handy 
I don't even shake 
Men are not a new sensation 
I've done pretty well I think 
But this half-pint imitation 
Put me on the blink 
I'm wild again 
beguiled again 
a simpering whimpering child again 
bewitched bothered and bewildered 
Am I 
couldn't sleep, and wouldn't sleep 
when love came and told me 
I shouldn't sleep 
Bewiched bothered and bewildered 
Am I 
lost my heart, but what of it? 
he is cold, I agree 
he can laugh, but I love it 
Although the laugh's on me 
I'll sing to him, each spring to him 
And long for the day 
when I'll cling to him, 
Bewitched bothered and bewildered 
Am I. 
He's a fool and don't I know it 
But a fool can have his charms 
I'm in love and don't I show it 
like a babe in arms 
I've sinned a lot 
I mean a lot 
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot 
bewitched bothered and bewildered 
Am I 
I'll sing to him 
Each spring to him 
And worship the trousers 
that cling to him 
Bewitched bothered and bewildered 
Am I 
When he talks 
He is seeking 
words to get 
On his chest 
Harsh until he's speaking 
he's at his very best 
jest again 
oh yes perplexed again 
then, God, I can be oversexed again 
bewitched bothered and bewildered 
Am I
