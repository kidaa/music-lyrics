John I love you 
I'm ever so fond of you 
Will you wait for me 
'Til I am heavenly 
Oh there's much work to do 
But I love you 
Oh you're tender 
Your name's a whisper 
I let tears fall like rain 
Apple-sized they were 
All over her 
And through all of those times 
When you could have died 
This is what you find 
There's life outside your mother's garden 
There's life beyond your wildest dreams 
There hasn't been any explosion 
We're not spinning like Dorothy 
If you look now then you'll see why 
Don't be afraid to cry 
This time don't let yourself fly 
Child 
Pick up those dancing shoes 
Kick off those wedding blues 
These are the ways 
You can choose 
Child you're tender 
Your name's a whisper 
There's life outside your mother's garden 
There's life beyond your wildest dreams 
There hasn't been any explosion 
We're not spinning like Dorothy 
And if you look now then you'll see why 
Don't be afraid to cry 
This time don't let yourself fly 
Child 
Pick up those dancing shoes 
Kick off those wedding blues 
These are the ways 
You can choose 
Child I love you 
I'm ever so fond of you
