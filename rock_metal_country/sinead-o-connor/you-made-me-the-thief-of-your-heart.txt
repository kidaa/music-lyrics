You made me the thief of your heart 
I hope you're happy now... 
...I could never make you so... 
you were a hard man... 
no harder in this world 
you made me cold and you made me hard 
and you made me the thief of your heart 
Winter is cold...oh! 
But you're colder still 
and for the first time 
I feel like you're mine 
I share you with the one who will 
mend what falls apart 
and turn a blind eye 
to the thief of your heart 
Ohhh you lost 
Ohhh you lost all 
you lost all 
you lost all 
I'll never wash these clothes 
I want to keep the stain 
Your blood to me is precious 
nor would I spill it in vain 
your spirit sings 
though your lips never part 
singing only to me 
the thief of your heart 
Ohhh you lost 
Ohhh you lost 
Ohhh you lost all 
lost all 
Ohhh you lost 
Ohhh you lost all 
lost all
