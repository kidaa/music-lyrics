I want to walk 
Into the light 
Day has turned cold 
So hold back the night 
What will become 
Of you and I 
We had a dream 
Don't let it die 
Do you want to be 
Do you want to be 
My dying day 
My darkest hour 
My overdose 
Cuz that's what you'll be 
Just hold back the night 
There was a time 
I'm sure you'll agree 
We saw it all 
A glorious sight 
Everyone's burned 
Everyone's gone 
What we once were 
Now we are not 
So hold back the night
