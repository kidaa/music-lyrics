How insensitive 
I must have seemed 
when he told me 
that he loved me. 
How unmoved and cold 
I must have seemed 
when he said it 
so sincerely. 
Why, he must have asked 
did I just turn and 
stare in icy silence? 
What was I to do? 
What can you do? 
when a love affair is over? 
Now he's gone away 
and I'm alone with 
the memory of 
his last look. 
Vague and drawn 
and sad, I see it still 
All the heartbreak 
of his last look. 
Why, he must have asked 
would I just turn 
and stare in icy silence? 
What was I to say? 
What can you say? 
when a love affair is over? 
Why, he must have asked 
did I just turn 
and stare in icy silence? 
What was I to say? 
What can you say? 
when a love affair is over? 
over 
over
