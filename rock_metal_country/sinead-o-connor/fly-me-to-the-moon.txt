Fly me to the moon 
And let me play 
among the stars 
Let me see what 
spring is like 
on Jupiter and Mars 
In other words, 
hold my hands 
In other words, 
darling kiss me 
Fill my heart with song 
And let me sing for ever more 
You are all I long for 
All I worship and adore 
In other words please be true 
In other words 
Fill my heart with song 
And let me sing for ever more 
You are all I long for 
All I worship and adore 
In other words please be true 
In other words, I love you 
I love you 
I love you 
I love you 
I love you 
I love you 
I love you 
love you
