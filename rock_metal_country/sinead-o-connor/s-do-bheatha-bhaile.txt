Se do bheatha a bhean ba leanmhar!
Welcome Oh woman who was so afflicted
B'e ar gcreach tu bheith i ngeibhinn
It was our ruin that you were in bondage
Do dhuiche bhrea i seilbh meirleach
Our fine land in the possesion of theives
'S tu diolta leis na Ghallaibh.
And sold to the foreigners

Chorus:
Oro, se do bheatha 'bhaile! x3
r! You are welcome home!
Anois ar theacht an tsamhraidh.
Now that summer is coming

Ta Grainne Mhaol ag teacht thar saile,
Grainne Mhaol is coming over the sea
Oglaigh armtha lei mar gharda
Armed warriors along with her as guard
Gaeil iad fein 's ni Gaill na Spainnigh
They are Irishmen, not English or Spanish
'S cuirfid siad ruaig ar Ghallaibh.
And they will rout the foreigners

Chorus

A bhui le Ri na bhfeart go bhfeiceam
May it please the God of Miracles that we may see
Muna mbeam beo 'na dhiaidh ach seachtain
Although we only live a week after it
Grainne Mhaol agus mile gaiscioch
Grainne Mhaol and a thousand warriors
Ag fogairt fain ar Ghallaibh.
Dispersing the foreigners

Chorus
