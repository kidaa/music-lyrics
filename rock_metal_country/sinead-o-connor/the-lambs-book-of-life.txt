Out of Ireland I have come 
Great hatred and little room 
Maimed us at the start 
And now home just breaks my heart 
To America I have come 
I hope to bring your preacherman 
Home to show my people how they can 
Get their names back in the book of the life of the lamb 
I know that I have done many things 
To give you reason not to listen to me 
Especially as I have been so angry 
But if you know me maybe you would understand me 
Words can't express how sorry I am 
If I ever caused pain to anybody 
I just hope that you can show compassion 
And love enough to just please listen 
Out of Ireland I did run 
Great hatred and little room 
Aimed to break my heart 
Wreck me up and me all apart 
To America I have come 
I hope to find a good preacherman 
Who can show me how I can 
Get my name back in the book of the life of the lamb 
I bring these blessings with me 
A strong heart full of hope and a feeling 
That everything in this world would be okay 
If people just believed enough in God to pray 
But the world thinks that sounds crazy 
And that's the thing that makes me sing sadly 
To think that we would leave God so lonely 
To think that we would mess up our destiny 
Out of history we have come 
With great hatred and little room 
It aims to break our hearts 
Wreck us up and tear us all apart 
But if we listen to the Rasta man 
He can show us how it can be done 
To live in peach and live as one 
Get our names back in the book of the life of the lamb
