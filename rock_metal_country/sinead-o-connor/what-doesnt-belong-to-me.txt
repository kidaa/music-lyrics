The woman named Iris gave birth to the goddess 
In her son who can't say his name 
Because of all the pain 
I miss you, but I'm gald you're gone 
I want you but I'm not alone 
I'm haunted by you 
But I'll get you gone if it takes me all my life long 
Take back the pain you gave me 
Take back what doesn't belong to me 
Take back the shame you gave me 
Take back what doesn't belong to me 
I'm Irish, I'm English, I'm Moslem, I'm Jewish,l 
I'm a girl, I'm a boy 
And the goddess meant for me only joy 
And real love requires you, give up those loves 
Whom you think you love best 
Love puts you through the test 
And only loyal love will be me happiness 
Take back the rage you gave me 
Take back the hatred you gave me for me 
Take back the anger that nearly killed me 
Take back what doesn't belong to me 
And real love requires you 
Give up those loves 
That you think you love best 
Love put you through the test 
And only loyal love will bring me happiness 
Take back the pain you gave me 
You take back what doesn't belong to me 
Take back the blame you gave me 
Take back what doesn't belong to me 
Take back what doesn't belong to me 
Take back what doesn't belong to me 
Take back what doesn't belong to me
