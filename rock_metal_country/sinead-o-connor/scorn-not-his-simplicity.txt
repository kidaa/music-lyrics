See the child 
With the golden hair 
Yet eyes that show the emptiness inside 
Do we know 
Can we understand just how he feels 
Or have we really tried 
See him now 
As he stands alone 
And watches children play a children's game 
Simple child 
He looks almost like the others 
Yet they know he's not the same 
Scorn not his simplicity 
But rather try to love him all the more 
Scorn not his simplicity 
Oh no 
Oh no 
See him stare 
Not recognizing the kind face 
That only yesterday he loved 
The loving face 
Of a mother who can't understand 
what she's been guilty of 
How she cried, tears of happiness 
the day the doctor told her it's a boy 
Now she cries tears of helplessness 
and thinks of all the things he can't enjoy 
Scorn not his simplicity 
But rather try to love him all the more 
Scorn not his simplicity 
Oh no 
Oh no 
Only he knows how to face the future hopefully 
Surrounded by despair 
He won't ask for your pity or your sympathy 
But surely you should care 
Scorn not his simplicity 
But rather try to love him all the more 
Scorn not his simplicity 
Oh no 
Oh no 
Oh no
