I'm looking at your soul, your soul, your soul, your soul 
I'm looking at your future, your future, future, future 
As I look into your eyes, these eyes, these eyes, these eyes 
I see another side, side, side, side 
Vampire, you're feed on the life of a pure heart 
Vampire you suck the life of goodness 
Vampire, you're feed on the life of a pure heart 
Vampire you suck the life of goodness 
Turn the lights on 
Let the lights shine bright 
Turn the lights on 
Let the lights shine bright 
You've got to feel yourself and let go 
You got to know you reap what you sown 
You've got to feel something at sometime 
Check the writings on the wall 
And look into the sight 
You're spending all your money on gare that never work 
you're wasting all your energy and everywhere it hurts 
God it really hurts 
yes it really hurts 
you got to know yourself 
Vampire, you're feed on the life of a pure heart 
Vampire, you suck the life of goodness 
Yes 
Vampire, you're feed on the life of a pure heart 
Vampire you suck the life of goodness 
From now on I'll call you England 
From now on I'll call you England 
From now on I'll call you England 
From now on I'll call you England 
See if you spit in the sky 
It will fall in your eye 
You see what goes up must come down 
You will die looking up if you're not looking in 
you've got to know yourself 
I'm looking at your partners and they would never agree 
I'm looking for your justice and it can not be seen 
I'm checking where you're coming from and where you're going to 
I'm checking all off what you have done to see what you can do 
I'm looking at your lawbooks and they were never read 
I'm looking at your lovesquire and they can not be thread 
I'm looking at your empire living on the drears 
You've got to know yourself 
Vampire, you're feed on the life of a pure heart 
Vampire, you suck the life of goodness 
Yes 
Vampire, you're feed on the life of a pure heart 
Vampire you suck the life of goodness 
From now on I'll call you England 
Empire fall man, empire go 
From now on I'll call you England 
There's a lesson to be learned 
Why is it that, you must know 
From now on I'll call you England 
and the rich that you eat is more like food that you fear 
From now on I'll call you England 
gotta see no love anyway you appear 
From now on I'll call you England 
you've got to know yourself 
from now on I'll call you England 
you've got to know yourself
