In this heart lies for you 
A lark born only for you 
Who sings only to you 
My love 
My love 
My love 
I am waiting for you 
For only to adore you 
My heart is for you 
My love 
My love 
My love 
This is my grief for you 
For only the loss of you 
The hurting of you 
My love 
My love 
My love 
There are rays on the weather 
Soon these tears will have cried 
All loneliness have died 
My love 
My love 
My love 
I will have you with me 
In my arms only 
For you are only 
My love 
My love 
My love
