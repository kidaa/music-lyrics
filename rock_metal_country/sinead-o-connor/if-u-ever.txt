The memories u bring 
Make my eyes both sting 
I can't help that pain that's tearing 
At my throat and my chest 
Where everything is kept 
When I start remembering 
How the clothes that u wore 
Made my heart so sore 
I just couldn't think anymore 
Of u once u were gone 
And it's been so long 
I've been carrying on 
And if u ever come home in the night 
Darling I'd treat u right, 
Oh darling I'd treat u right 
U got into your car and drove as far 
As u could and even further 
And no matter how I sang 
I just never can 
Stop needing your hand 
Though got into my own car and drove as far 
As I could so that I might forget u 
I never could, does that I'm no good? 
If it doesn't it should 
But if u ever came home in the night 
Darling I'd treat u right 
Oh darling I'd treat u right 
If u ever came home in the night 
Darling I'd treat u right 
Darling I'd treat u right 
And I'd treat u right
