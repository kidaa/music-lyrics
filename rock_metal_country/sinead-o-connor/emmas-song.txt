The first time I saw you 
I loved you 
I loved you 
Your face blue 
Your eyes too 
Your mouth too 
Your mouth too 
When I heard you 
I wanted you 
Give birth to you 
Give birth to you 
I made love to you 
Made love to you 
The great goddess 
Had us blessed 
The last time I saw you 
I fought with you 
I fought with you 
I didn't mean to 
I didn't mean to 
Oh say you'll see me 
Let me say sorry 
The next time I see you 
I'll love you 
I'll be sweet to you 
I'll take you to 
My healing room 
Oh we both know 
How loneliness goes 
Everytime I see you 
I want you 
I want you 
The more I do 
You hate me to 
But the great goddess 
Had us blessed
