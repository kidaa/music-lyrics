I wanna be loved by you, 
just you and nobody else but you 
I wanna be loved by you 
alone poo poo pi doo 
I wanna be kissed by you 
just you, nobody else but you 
I wanna be loved by you 
I couldn't aspire 
To anything higher 
Then to fill a desire 
to make you my own 
I wanna be loved by you, 
just you and nobody else but you 
I wanna be loved by you 
alone 
I couldn't aspire 
To anything higher 
Then to fill a desire 
to make you my own 
tada tada ta tada 
I wanna be loved by you 
just you, nobody else but you 
I wanna be loved by you 
I wanna be loved by you 
I wanna be loved by you 
Alone
