My love, your love has opened up a world I've never known.
All hope was found; a place I've never dreamed I would go.
Feels like only yesterday.
I had locked my heart away,
Safe behind the castle of stone.
Sure it was me alone.

Only you know how
To hear me through the silence.
You reach a part of me that no-one else can see.
Forever true, there is only me and only you.
Only me and you.

In your faith I trust; with you beside me I am sond and strong.
One truth, two hearts; you took my life and made it beautiful.
So you dare to let me shine,
Even walk a step behind.
Willingly you give yourself to me,
Knowing who I was born to be.

Only you know how ... x 2
