My own love said to me 
 My mother won't mind. 
And my daughters won't slight you 
for your lack of kind . 
He went away from me 
and this he did say 
 It will not be long, Love, 
till our wedding day  
He went away from me 
And he moved through the fair 
And slowly I watched him 
Move here and move there 
He went his way homeward 
with one star awake 
As this swan in the evening 
moves over the lake 
I dreamed last night 
that my own love came in 
He came in so sweetly 
his feet made no din 
He came close beside me 
And this he did say 
 It will not be long Love 
till our wedding day  
It will not be long love 
long love 
long love 
love
