Where's my telephone?

";Is that you baby?";
";Yeah.";

";Got something to tell you.";
";Oh, what?";

I want to see you tonight
I want you to walk in the door
I want you to lay on the floor
Cause tonight's the night
We make love, under a stobe light
Underneath the strobe light

Wanna make love to you under the strobe light
Wanna make love to you under the strobe light
Strobe light - Woah oh oh
Strobe light - Woah oh oh

Yeah!

But the light goes to my head!
Everything I see is redBaby when I kiss your hair
I feel electricity in the air

I'm gonna kiss your eyes
Then I'm gonna kiss your neck
Then I'm gonna kiss your tummy
The I'm gonna kiss your pineapple

Tonight's the night
For love under the light
Strobe light, strobe light
Underneath the strobe light

Wanna make love to you under the strobe light
Wanna make love to you under the strobe light
Strobe light - Woah oh oh
Strobe light - Woah oh oh

Yeah!

I just wanna make love to you
I just wanna make love to you
Underneath the strobe light

Strobe light, strobe light
Strobe light, strobe light
Strobe light
Strobe, strobe, strobe, strobe, strobe light
