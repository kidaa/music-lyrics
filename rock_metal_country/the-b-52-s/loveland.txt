Loveland, Loveland
I got a searchlight, I got a lovelight
Loveland
Beauteous isles of Loveland
Hey, hey I got it
I'm talkin' about love, whoa
Love, love power is the power of the hour, ho
Love, love power is the power of the hour, ho no hoa
I will show you all the shortcuts to Loveland

The Lovelake can get rough
Hey, hey I got it
I'm talkin' about love
Love, love power is the power of the hour, ho
Love, love power is the power of the hour, ho no hoa
Give me, give me your hand
and we'll steer a course to LovelandThe Lovelake can get rough
Air get tense, waves get choppy
Embraces cold and kisses sloppy
Oh baby I got it, and you got it, love
I'm gonna take you to a place where;
But tonight we'll make wooo
Loveland, Loveland, Loveland we got it,
We got it, you wait, I'll open the gate
