5:59
Don't you see the danger
Coming over you
Don't act like a stranger, don't live like a fool
Corruption  --  destruction
It's always the same
Illusion  --  confusion
The world lives in pain
Hideous and hateful, it cuts like a knife
Money and business are counting our lives
Fight to survive  --  the world in desguise
In the hearth of darkness
Fight to survive  --  Sedition will rise
In the dark days of your life
Priests and politicians
Tell us what to do
Words to clean up their 
Never on the loose
Submission  --  Ignition  --  To start a new age
Suspicion  --  Tradicion  --  Releasing the rage
Hideous and hateful, we're darken the sky
No surrender `till we see the light
Fight to survive  --  the world in desguise
In the hearth of darkness
Fight to survive  --  Sedition will rise
In the dark days of your life
