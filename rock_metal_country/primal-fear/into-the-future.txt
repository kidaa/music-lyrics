4:05
Faster and faster, I march on my way
For me there's no limit to see
Harder and harder I push to succeed
I live at the highest degree
Too many years I've wasted
To live in the past
I've started to move and I'm doing it fast
I'm riding into the future
I'm out of hiding again ready to fly
Breaking through boundaries
Destroy what confines
A will that is made out of steel
Na immortal trust
To what's right and what's wrong
I warn you do not cross my wheel
To many years I have wasted
To live in the past
I've started to move and i'm doing it fast
I'm riding into the future
I'm out of hiding again ready to fly
Come with me
I will show you the way
To the place where's your destiny
There's no reason to stay
