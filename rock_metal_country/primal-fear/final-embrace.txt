5:07
I came back tonight
From the field of the fight
They collected parts of death
A dimension unknown
I heared screams `till the dawn
What's the sence behind this mess
I'm feeling so lonely
I'm desperate in the cold
I'm feeling defenceless
Wait for the call ready to fall
What is this my final moment
Is it real or fantasy
Can't ignore my soul is burning
Waiting for the final embrace
This outrage of war
In the name of our god
Killed emotions  --  Every pride
I will fight my own fight
I will break through their lines
Take the last chance to survive
I'm waiting `till midnight
I'll see my final fight
My hate is religion
Pray to the sky  --  ready to die
What is this my final moment
Is it real or fantasy
Can't ignore my soul is burning
Waiting for the final embrace
