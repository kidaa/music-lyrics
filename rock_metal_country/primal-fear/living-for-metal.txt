They Were Comin' To Our City
With A Wall Of Energy
Got Their Records And Went Crazy
This Is How It's Gotta Be
This Heavy Sound Has Got Into Our Veins
It Tore Us All Around, Exploring Our Brains
Living For Metal - You Keep Us Going
Living For Metal - We Hear You Rowing
Metal Is Our Life
Now We're Comin' To Your City
Formed A Band Right On Our Own
All The Fans Are Going Crazy
Playing Metal All Night Long
This Heavy Sound Has Got Into Your Veins
It Tears You All Around It's Getting In Your Brains
Living For Metal - You Keep Us Going
Living For Metal - We Hear You Roaring
Metal Is Our Life
Born To Play The Sound,
Bang To The Beat Which Turns You On
Feel The Shakin' Ground So Stamp Your Feet
And Sing This Song
Living For Metal - You Keep Us Going
Living For Metal - We Hear You Roaring
Metal Is Our Life
