I Never Meant To Hurt You
I Just Let You Know You're The Only One
And Deep In The Night
I Could Not Believe It However I've Trust In You
Deep In My Mind - I'm Leaving This World Behind
Standing Face To Face In This Secret Place
We're Searching For A Way To Live
And You Hold Me Tight, This Moment Can Last Forever
It's Now Or Never
I Was Caught In A Dead End Street
A Look Into Your Eyes Can Heal Me
And After This Moment You Crave Me Something Back
What I Really Need
Deep In My Mind - I'm Leaving This World Behind
Standing Face To Face In This Secret Place
We're Searching For A Way To Live
And You Hold Me Tight, This Moment Can Last Forever
It's Now Or Never
The Sun Was Shining Again
And A Cold Breeze In My Face
I Felt The Blood In My Veins
And I Knew It Was Not Too Late
Deep In My Mind - I'm Leaving This World Behind
Standing Face To Face In This Secret Place
We're Searching For A Way To Live
And You Hold Me Tight, This Moment Can Last Forever
It's Now Or Never
