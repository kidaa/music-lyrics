3:35
From the valley of the darkness
The elder says nobody has returned
It's always been a chalenge for me
To find adventure, to face the fear
I made my mind up to go
I'll give my life just to know
Save a prayer
Beyond imagination
So many signs just tell me to stop
I fell a certain energy
That leads me to the jungle of the dark
Oh my visions getting clear
What is behind eternal fears
Save a prayer
Forgotten land  --  I'm reaching the end  --  it's fading to
Black  --  save me
I made my own great scape
And if you miss me it's too late
Save a prayer
Forgotten land  --  I'm reaching the end  --  it's fading to
Black  --  save me
