3:13
Ticking like a time bomb, I knew the time was right
Dead place of destruction and no paradise in sight
Burning down the seven wonders, trapped in anarchy
And there is no turning back at what we left
Bridge:
Where do we go - destination unknown
Where can we stay - the world's shakin' away
Chorus:
For silver and gold, we're searching for souls
We are the light and we're kissing the day
Silver and gold, your future is sold
The deadzone in flames in the eye of the storm
Like a nuclear reactor your nightmare's getting real
Tanled in a web of darkness time is standing still
Comin' as invaders, sailed the seven seas
Burned and marked forever now - but where...
Bridge:
Where do we go - destination unknown
Where can we stay - the world's shakin' away
Chorus:
For silver and gold, we're searching for souls
We are the light and we're kissing the day
Silver and gold, your future is sold
The deadzone in flames in the eye of the storm
Solo
Chorus:
For silver and gold, we're searching for souls
We are the light and we're kissing the day
Silver and gold, your future is sold
The deadzone in flames in the eye of the storm
For silver and gold, we're searching for souls
We are the light and we're kissing the day
Silver and gold, your future is sold
The deadzone in flames in the eye of the storm
Silver and gold
