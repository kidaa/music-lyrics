Watching this planet
From far outa space
The pearl in a shadow of darkness
A fled into nowhere, without destiny
These human killers, victins won't be seen
About progression - without charity
Nation in fear  --  why are we fighting
Nation in fear
The world in the eyes of a child
One nation  --  one nation in fear
One nation in fear
Two years are gone
Since we've left mother earth
Surrounded by ruins  --  It looks altered
All covered with dust
Surrender to the seer
There's nothing left
Where is our mankind gone
Or where or lonely brothers tired of life
Nation in fear  --  why are we fighting
Nation in fear
The world in the eyes of a child
One nation  --  one nation in fear
One nation in fear
