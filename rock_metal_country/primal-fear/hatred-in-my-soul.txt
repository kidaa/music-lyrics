4:55
They've been hunting me
They have prisioned me
They put torture on my mind
Down in this dark hole, every night alone
A place where generations died
Ain't dead yet, I'm still alive
They gonna pay the price
Hatred in my soul
I'm a beast, come feel my anger
Take my vengeance
And I swear to myself, I gonna get you
You gonna pay for your crime
Voices in my ears, crying out in fear
It's the point of no return
Ain't dead yet  --  I'm still alive
They gonna pat the price
Hatred in my soul
I'm a beast, come feel my anger
Take my vengeance
And I swear to myself, I gonna get you
You gonna pay for your crime
Justice out of our hand
In this god damned land
Now this place is gonna burn
Ain't dead yet, I'm still alive
They gonna pay the price
Hatred in my soul
I'm a beast, come feel my anger
Take my vengeance
And I swear to myself, I gonna get you
You gonna pay for your crime
