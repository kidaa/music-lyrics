See The Reckless Tyrant
That Reigns With The Iron Fist
No Chance For Him To Break You
'Clause You Are A Liberalist
With 1000 Miles An Hour
You Smash Down Every Wall
No Force Will Ever Stop You
No One Will Make You Fall
Be The One To Make Your Dreams Come True
See There's Only One Thing You Must Do
You Have To Fight The Fire
You Are The Hero, You're Born To Win
Take All That You Require
Today You Are Stronger, Than You've Ever Been
Uncompromising Fighter A Warrior Of Liberty
A Smashing Boundless Courage
You Fear No Enemy
Total Subordination
A Thing You Don't Know At All
You'd Rather Be Dead Man
Before You Start To Crawl
Be The One To Make Your Dreams Come True
See There's Only One Thing You Must Do
You Have To Fight The Fire
You Are The Hero You're Born To Win
Take All That You Require
Today You Are Stronger Than You've Ever Been
