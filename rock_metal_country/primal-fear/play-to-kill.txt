If you like the jeopardy and if you
Have the guts
You think your life is boring
You say it drives you nuts
If this is the way you think I've
Got a remedy
Your problems will be blown away
You'll go through agony
A boundless hyper energy
Will smash into your brain
There's no chance for you to stop
The force you can't restrain
Play to kill  --  play to kill
Can't you see that we play to kill
No chance for you to conquer
No chance for you to flee
If you've once been beaten by this
Machinery
The only way for all of you
To live the whole thing through
Is fight the fight beside us
There's nothing else to do
A boundless hyper energy
Will smash into your brain
There's no chance for you to stop
The force you can't restrain
Play to kill  --  play to kill
Can't you see that we play to kill
