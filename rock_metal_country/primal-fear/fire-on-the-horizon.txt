3:30
There Was No Warning, No Sign Of Danger
We Saw Smoke In The Sky And Fear In Their Eyes
We Felt That Something Terrible'ld Come
Saw A Field Of Fire, We're Under The Gun
We Could Not Believe
And Pursued The Scenery
Fire On The Horizon
Fire On The Horizon
We Were Encircled By Machines Never Seen
Death On The Horizon, They Came Out Of The Dawn
All Forces In Trouble, The Nuclear Weapons
Were Everywhere Seen - The State Of Emergency
Fiaht At The Front
The Invaders From Beyond
Fire On The Horizon
Fire On The Horizon
