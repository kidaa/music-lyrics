5:15
This night I died a thousand times
I had some doubts, saw into her eyes
Her gipsy heart just beats in pain
I hold her hand
We walk through the rain
I'm standing here, she's standing there
Uh I can't get her outa my mind
I call her name, she's acting strange
This could be the last time
When the night comes
It's so unreal
When the night comes
It's just a dream
We fight against our deep desires
Her energy can set a heart on fire
What comes around just comes around
She looked into the palm of my hand
She would not tell this hidden spell
But I can't get her outa my mind
She won't reply, the last goodbye
I know, it was the last time
When the night comes
It's so unreal
When the night comes
It's just a dream
When the night comes
