4:38
I'm on my way in a foreign land
The crime rate's up to 25 percent
Dessident people everywhere
And I can't find no comfort here
Bridge:
All alone - no one's there to help me
No control - there's no one I can trust
Chorus:
Cause they were running in the dust - running
Cause they were running in the dust - running
I'm walking through the streets with a stranger's look
Their eyes staring at me as the darkness cooks
They ask me for a dollar a gun behind their back
Their faces switch from friendly to attack
Bridge:
All alone - no one's there to help me
No control - there's no one I can trust
Chorus:
ause they were running in the dust - running
Cause they were running in the dust - running 
Solo
I miss my country, my friends, my family
I will struggle to go home
I'm settled for peace now step out of insanity
But my dream has ended in a blast
Standing here alone in this bloodstained land
As I realized danger's close at hand
A gunshot kills the sound of silence
An angel's life has ended up by violence
Chorus:
Cause they were running in the dust - running
Cause they were running in the dust - running
Cause they were running in the dust
Running in the dust
Dust
