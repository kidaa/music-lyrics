4:25
Out of this world in another dimension
2000 lightyears from home
Defending the faith he fights for a mission
But he is standing alone
Bridge:
Just like an outlaw he's fighting for freedom
Defeating the enemy's pride
Keepin' it all under surveillance tonight
Chorus:
Chainbreaker
He fights for the right
Chainbreaker
Watchin' the dark he supresses the evil
Raisin' the spirit up high
Beware of the dead this place is so lethal
He's livin' a dangerous lie
Bridge:
Just like an outlaw he's fighting for freedom
Defeating the enemy's pride
Keepin' it all under surveillance tonight
Chorus:
Chainbreaker
He fights for the right
Chainbreaker
Devastating disillusion no solution
Everlasting resurrection with dejection
Degradation desperation lost emotion
Aggravation desolation in perfection
Solo
Bridge:
Just like an outlaw he's fighting for freedom
Defeating the enemy's pride
Keepin' it all under surveillance tonight
Chorus:
Chainbreaker
He fights for the right
Chainbreaker
Chainbreaker
Chainbreaker
