4:57
Acceleration - my body's pressed into the seat
Fascination - pipes are glowing in the heat
Am I the fastest one can I improve
Making a late run I still got the groove
Pole Position - I'm on the top prepared to win
Rising tension - the lights are set, the start begins
Smoking Wheels - I'm getting faster, take the lead
Shifting gears - the engines pushed up to top speed
Chorus:
Formula One - the class of kings on highest level
Formula One - come to see me win
Wheels are spinning, on slicks I have the perfect grip
Feel like winning, the fastest lap is now complete
I am the fastest one, taking this race
I'm overtaking, setting the pace
Feel the street - I take the curves, I love to slice
Beat my beat - I'll finish first and take the price
Chorus:
Formula One - the class of kings on highest level
Formula One - come to see me win
Formula One - will get into your blood forever
Formula One - let the show begin
Elated at victory, I stand on the podium
The audience is roaring, they reach out for me
Showers of champagne are running down my neck
In honour of my country they play the nation's song
Solo: Tom / Kai / Tom
Acceleration - my body's pressed into the seat
Fascination - pipes are glowing in the heat
Chorus:
Formula One - the class of kings on highest level
Formula One - come to see me win
Formula One - will get into your blood forever
Formula One - let the show begin
