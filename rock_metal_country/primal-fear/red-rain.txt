Do You Feel I'm Far Away, Please Don't Wait, Well It's Too Late
You Don't See Me - I Believe You Should Awake
There's No More Creeping, There's No Return And No Compromise
You Don't See Me - The Candle Doesn't Burn Anymore
The Room - In Which I Slept Is Dark
No More Tune To Remember - Now I'm Worlds Apart
Red Rain - Running Like Blood From The Wall
As I Needed You Most, There Wa.s No Call
The Time Ran Out - Red Rain Will Fall
Tlie Pain Hurts Deeply, To Hell And Back, I Burned For You
It's Getting Darker, I Don't Forget That Longing To Die
There's A Way Out Even If It Becomes A Nightmare
The Tunnels End - The Candle Doesn't Burn Anymore
The Room - In Which I Slept Is Dark
No More Time To Remember - Now I'm Worlds Apart
Red Rain - Running Like Blood From The Wall
As I Needed You Most, There Was No Call
The Time Ran Out - Red Rain Will Fall
