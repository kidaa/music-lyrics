5:13
Steel and fire
Spreading the holy word
Dirty liars
The truth has never been heared
Are you the one who thinks free
Or do you share this mad insanity
To use a religion  --  increasing the terror
Is much more than just a human error
What are they fighting for
They call it holy war
So many inocent have died
No democracy in the church of blood
There's no democracy
Welcome to the church of blood
Pray salvation
The promissed paradise
Violent nations
Who kill and terrorize
Sowing the seeds of discord
Ready to kill in the name 
Of our lord
Suicide victins setting their signs
Burning their books and the tales
Without rimes
What are they dying for
They call it holy war
So many men have left their lives
No democracy in the church of blood
There's no democracy
Welcome to the church of blood
Oh lord, my god  --  consider all their words thy hands
Have made
Your son  --  you sent him to die
I scare can take it in
That on the cross
My burden gladly bearing
He bled and died to save me
From my sin
