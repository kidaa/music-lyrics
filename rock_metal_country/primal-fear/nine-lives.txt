3:08
Hiding the truth, everlasting youth
Runnin' the thin line till dawn
The impossible waits, the kiss of death
Silence - the secret will hurt
No more time to fulfill
Enter darkness and thrills
Bridge:
I need more time to understand
Till we're reaching the end
Chorus:
Nine lives - you'll never forget
A shadow in white - we hold the night
Will you forgive me
These cat eyes can cure, I know that for sure
The king of the jungle bewares
As I hit the trace, a love's changing face
I'm searching for you everywhere
I will take care - naturally
One more chance - faithfully
Bridge:
I need more time to understand
Till we're reaching the end
Chorus:
Nine lives - you'll never forget
A shadow in white - we hold the night
Will you forgive me
Solo
Chorus:
Nine lives - you'll never forget
A shadow in white - we hold the night
Will you forgive me
Nine lives - you'll never forget
A shadow in white - we hold the night
Will you forgive me
