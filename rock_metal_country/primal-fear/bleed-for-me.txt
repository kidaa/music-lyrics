The Night Was Dark, The Horizon Was Far
I Felt The Wind In My Face
After The Rain, When Death Embraced
And I'm Waiting For The Sunrise
Between Paradise And Suicide
When All Is In Vain...
Can't You See The Anger In Me
There Are Things You Should Know
How Does It Taste, The Smile On My Face
And There's Nothing You Can Do
There Will Be No Tomorrow, When I'm Gone
You Will Sleep In A Bed Of Lies
You Will Wake Up In The Middle Of The Night
You Will Bleed For Me
I Slam The Door And Dust Me Off
When Your Smile Gets Old And Faded
You'll Burn In Flames Forget My Name
When Death Keeps Knocking At Your Door
When All Is Said And Done
And You Can't Breathe No More
You Will Sleep In A Bed Of Lies
You Will Wake Up In The Middle Of The Night
You Will Pray For Mercy And Bleed
You Will Bleed For Me
I Close My Eyes And There Isn't Time For Pain
You'll Go Insane, Like There's A Bullet In Your Brain
You Will Sleep in A Bed Of Lies
You Will Wake Up In The Middle Of The Night
You Will Pray For Mercy And Bleed
You Will Bleed For Me
