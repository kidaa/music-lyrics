Every Night I Dream The Same Old Frightning Nightmare
Calling Out For Answers No One Can Explain.
Voices In The Distance, Can Not Understand Them
Faces Look At Me, They Call Out My Name.
Back To Realtity I Realize It's The Naked Truth
See People Stare At Me - Can't You See That We Went Much Too Far
My Dedication To The Past, I'm Gonna Draw The Line
You Hit Me With An Iron Fist in A Velvet Glove
It's Time To Talk It Over, This Can't Go On No Longer.
Can't You See The Fact That We Are Worlds Apart,
We Better Seperate Ways Or Hate Is Getting Stronger.
Last Chapter In The Act, Two More Broken Hearts.
Your Style Is Killing Me, I Hate The Way You Are
No Step Will We Go On, Can't You See That We Went Much Too Far
My Dedication To The Past, I'm Gonna Draw The Line
You Hit Me With An Iron Fist In A Velvet Glove
There's No Progression From The Past As Time Of Life Goes By
You Hit Me With An Iron Fist In A Velvet Glove
