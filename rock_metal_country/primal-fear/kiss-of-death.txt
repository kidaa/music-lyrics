Your tragedy was to believe me
I had bad feelengs for your relief
You try to offend me, in your selfish way
My agony was not a reason to bertay
You're gonna pay
Dance with the devil - still feel the pain
Suit up for destruction - the kiss of death
No tim for anger, no time for despair
I don't want to see me in tins nightmare
No Chance to hurt me, no chance for tears
All I want to prove your darkest fears
I'll disappear
Dance with the devil - still feel the pain
Suit up for destruction - the kiss of death
Look into the future - it will take your breath
Suit up for destruction -the kiss of death
