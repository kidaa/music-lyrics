Danger, danger the queen's about to kill
There's a stranger, stranger and life's
About to spill
Oh no move me out of harm
I need a spell and a charm
Fly like the wind
I'm no pawn, so be gone
Speed on and on
Kill the king, strike him down
Power power it happens everyday
Power devour all along the way
Oh no move me out of harm
I need a spell and a charm
Fly like the wind
I'm no pawn, so be gone
Speed on and on
Kill the king, strike him down
Treason, treason the spectre looms again
Treason, reason the realm is safe and then
Oh no move me out of harm
I need a spell and a charm
Fly like the wind
I'm no pawn, so be gone
Speed on and on
Kill the king, strike him down
He'll rule no more  --  Strike him down
The people roar  --  Kill the king  --  take his head  --  down
Down, down, down
