3:59
I saw a cadillac driving to the wishing well
A sweet illusion or a secret from hell
I was paralyzed, kinda hypnotized
And the time stood still
Chorus:
If dollars were dirt
Gold and honey
I'll be watching you
If dollars were dirt
Gold and honey
I can see the truth
There's no one scared and nothing left
Was it my lucky day or am I a jerk
Your shadow's still here, do you live in fear
Is this superstition
Chorus:
If dollars were dirt
Gold and honey
I'll be watching you
If dollars were dirt
Gold and honey
I can see the truth
Solo: Tom / Tom & Kai
Your shadow's still here, do you live in fear
Is this superstition
Chorus:
If dollars were dirt
Gold and honey
I'll be watching you
If dollars were dirt
Gold and honey
I can see the truth
If dollars were dirt
Gold and honey
I'll be watching you
If dollars were dirt
Gold and honey
I can see the truth
See the truth
See the truth
