Bursting Metal - Chroming Eagles In The Night
In A Flying Battle - Fighting Monsters Side By Side
Into The Light We Are Guided By Our Own Destiny
Keeping The Course Nothing Can Stop Us At All
Forever We Will Follow The Light
Although We'll Burn in Nuclear Fire
As We Can See On Our Last Flight
It Will Take Us One Step Higher Than We Were
Striking Squadron - Crushing Tanks On Our Trail
There Is No Weapon - Radar Rockets Bound To Fail
Setting The Pace We Deploy To Destroy Our Enemy
Keeping The Course Nothing Can Stop Us At All
Forever We Will Follow The Light
Although We'll Burn in Nuclear Fire
As We Can See On Our Last Flight
It Will Take Us One Step Higher Than We Were
Taking No Prisoners And Bring No Survivor
We Are The Soldiers OF Death
Painful And Cruel We Destroy Our Rival
Violence Is Catching His Breads
Forever We Will Follow The Light
Although We'll Burn in Nuclear Fire
As We Can See On Our Last Flight
It Will Take Us One Step Higher Than We Were
