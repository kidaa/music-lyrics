4:25
In time of greed and jealousy
When clouds fulfill the sky
The rain will fall
It's hding the tears from my eyes
A trip right into fantasy
The colours of my soul
Will take me there
Where confident spirits will flow
Bridge:
Where I can find peace of mind
Chorus:
Take me back where I belong
Give me back my pride
Building castles in the sand
In a place called the promised land
A place of pride and dignity
Where you can find no hate
So stay with me
And join me before it's too late
Come with me in the fantasy
I'll be your guiding light
Just trust your fate
And everything will be allright
Bridge:
Where I can find peace of mind
Chorus:
Take me back where I belong
Give me back my pride
Building castles in the sand
In a place called the promised land
Solo
Chorus:
Take me back where I belong
Give me back my pride
Building castles in the sand
In a place called the promised...
Take me back where I belong
Give me back my pride
Building castles in the sand
In a place called the promised...
Place called the promised...
Place called the promised  land
