6:48
Out here alone, I will wear a thousand faces
I'm still waiting, the master of disguise
Can't you hear me calling in my deepest desperation
I talked to the angles, cause I'd broken every rule
And if you hurt me, there's a way back to you
I found a reason out in this mystery
Bridge:
A touch of heaven
I opened up my soul
Don't leave me waiting
Until my heart is gone
Chorus:
It takes two times
There's no holding back now
Until I found you again
Tears of rage
Into the real world we said our last goodbye
Betrayed ourselves only for our selfish pride
I'm disillusioned, threw my heart into the flame
Bridge:
A touch of heaven
I opened up my soul
Don't leave me waiting
Until my heart is gone
Chorus:
It takes two times
There's no holding back now
Until I found you again
Tears of rage
Solo
Five in the morning, I'd lied to myself
Time to surrender as I see your face
I just want to hold you
I could make you mine again
Bridge:
A touch of heaven
I opened up my soul
Don't leave me waiting
Until my heart is gone
Chorus:
It takes two times
There's no holding back now
Until I found you again
It takes two times
There's no holding back now
Until I found you again
Tears of rage
Tears of rage
