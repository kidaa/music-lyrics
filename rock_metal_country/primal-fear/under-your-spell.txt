5:35
I'm twisted in dreams
I won't forgive
Your secrets were safe so far
As I discovered lies
First it hurts, I'm going insane
I'm slamming against the grain
Where's the faith
Where's the trust
I'm under your spell
Forgive me I still believe
I'm under your spell
I dawn you for taking bad advice
I guess your time was gone
As you want to burst my pride
Deep inside me I feel save
'm slamming against the grain
Where's the faith
Where's the trust
I'm under your spell
Forgive me I still believe
I'm under your spell
Don't you think
I'm staying any longer
The price I payed, Is much too high
Your great deal of morality is over
