3:45
Believer, Deceiver - The Question Is 'Where Is Our God'?
Thunder & Lightning, I See Her Face In The Dawn
No One Can See This, Except My Own Eyes
In This World Of Promises
She Shows Me The Way To The Other Side
And How Long I Could Be Dead
Back From Hell - Where I Discovered The Truth
Can Hear My Final Bell... I'm Back From Hell
Fire, Desire, Her Dark Eyes Are Burning My Soul
Fallen Angel - She Poisons Me Until My Fall
A Temptation Unknown, I Sell My Soul
Riding The Edge Of The Storm
I'm Running Through Hames, Bleeding Again
I Relish This Time And The Pain
Back From Hell - Where I Discovered The Truth
I Can Hear The Final Bell
Back From HeU ' Where I Lost My Faith
Can't You See I'm Back From Hell
