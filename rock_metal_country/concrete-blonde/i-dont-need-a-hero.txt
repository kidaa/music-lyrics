You always said I was a liar
but we burn like a house on fire...
No matter what, you know that to be true.
And everything you gave to me
changed everything I used to be
much more than anyone I ever knew
And I don't need a hero
I don't need a soldier
I did when I was younger -
but now that I'm older
I don't need a father,
I don't wanna be your mother
it's just that anyone of us is half
without another one is you
The colors of that piece of time
are still so fresh inside my mind
and it makes the movie
of my life seem pale -
and all the games I have to play
I got to give a lot of me away
but the part with us
will never be for sale
The words of love have been confused
The ways of love have been abused -
Is this a lottery you win or lose?
I don't know -
It's an endless circle over time
The place inside where I hold and find
your sweet and happy music in my soul
