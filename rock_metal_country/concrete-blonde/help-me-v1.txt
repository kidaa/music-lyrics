Maybe it's just a phase
the days and the nights and the nights and the days
of tossing and turning and buring and churning
Inside my brain
Or, maybe I'm FINALLY insane
but I don't know who to believe anymore
It's like I'm caught in some revolving door
over and Over and OVer and OVER
....teach me how to pray.
....tell me what to say
help me help me help me find my way
I never could play the game
And all their faces look the same
And I won't give up
Won't give in
You know I never want to be like them I'm
Ticking away like time
Out of sync and out of my mind
well I used to know a truth from a lie
just by
looking in your eyes
lies
....carry me away
....farther and farther and farther everyday
help me help me help me find my way
Hanging by a thread
and waves of confusion break down on my head
when I think of all the things you said well the words
fall
dead
....higher every day
....a price i swear i'll never pay no way
help me help me help me find my way
