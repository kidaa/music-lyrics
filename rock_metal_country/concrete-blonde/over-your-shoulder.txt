I watch you eat
I watch you sleep
I see you in between your sheets
Oh! No. There I am.
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
Whatever you say, I'm watching you.
Oh! No. There I am.
Over your shoulder
Over your shoulder
Over your shoulder
Oh! No. There I am again.
My eyes, when you see,
My ears, when you hear
You can't get away from the face in the mirror.
No, no, no, no, no -
There I am.
Wherever you go
However you do it,
baby, I'm the only one true to you
There I am.
Over your shoulder
Over your shoulder
Over your shoulder
Everything we did,
Everything we said,
If ever you're with another
I'll be in your bed
Oh! No. There I am.
Trying to forget my face and my name
As hard as you can.
It won't be the same at all.
