Little Sister
Mama's nest is empty, all the babies grown and gone
And you're talking. I can hear me, you should hear you.
Look into a youger face that used to be my own
Years apart they make it harder to be near you.

All the times you couldn't tell her how you miss her.
But I'm only half a heart away.
Over all the time and distance I am where you are.
And I love you. Above all we're flesh and blood.

All along the way the road gets turned and twisted
And it hurts some, yeah you know it hurts some
Trying to find your way home.
