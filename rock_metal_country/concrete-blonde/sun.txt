part the dark and chase it gone
you're the sweet and sunny one
as bright as any star tonight.
You smile like a beam of light

show me a ray
show me a ray
show me a ray of

Raining for so long, so long
Like a candle blowing in a storm
but you can
Show me a ray
Show me a ray
Show me a ray
Show me a ray
of
