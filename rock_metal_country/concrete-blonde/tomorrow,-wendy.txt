Original Version by Andy Prieboy
It is complete now - two ends of time
are neatly tied
A one-way street, she's walking to the
end of the line
And there she meets the faces she sees in
her heart and mind
They say - goodbye - tomorrow Wendy's
going to die
Underneath the chilly grey November sky
we can make believe
that Kennedy is still alive
We're shooting for the moon and smiling
Jackie's driving by
They say - good try -
tomorrow Wendy's going to die
I told the priest - don't count on
any second coming.
God got his ass kicked the first time he
came down here slumming
He had the balls to come, the gall to die
and then forgive us -
No, I don't wonder why
I wonder what he thought
it would get us - hey hey, good try -
Tomorrow Wendy's going to die
