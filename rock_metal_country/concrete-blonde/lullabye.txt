when the sky has fallen
like a blanket on your shoulder
and the moon is like a mother
looking over you forever
and the dawn is so famaliar
you were meant to be together
like a fog around a mountain - forever
so softly - so sweetly
surrounding you completely
sing you a lullabye - a lullabye to you
lullabye - a lullabye to you
when your breathing is the wind
and your crying is the rain
well i know you will remember
because the music is forever
the living of a lover -
and the loving of another
like a sister to a brother
like a father to a mother
so softly - so sweetly
surrounding you completely
sing you a lullabye - a lullabye
