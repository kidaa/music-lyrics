I hear you're driving
someone else's car now -
She said you came and
took your stuff away.
All the poetry and the trunk
you kept your life in -
I knew that it would
come to that someday
- like a sad hallucination
when I opened up my eyes -
the train had passed the station
and you were trapped inside
and I never wonder where you went
I only wonder why...
Oh Caroline x 4
I hear you're using someone else's number
She said she saw you in the store today
It don't matter whose address
you're listed under
I only know they'll never make you stay
- Like a memory in motion
you were only passing through
but that's all you'll ever do -
there's a dream I have where I sail away
and I'm looking back at you
and I wave goodbye
I wonder why I wonder...
