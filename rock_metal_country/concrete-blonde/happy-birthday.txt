Outside in the hall there's a catfight
It's well after midnight
I guess I'll be allright
I'm laid out on the floor
Drunk and ppor
How much longer how much more
Rock me to sleep
Strong & deep.
The screaming cats they give me the creep
But aside from all that I feel no pain
Staring up at the ceiling stains
...Neon in the window
...Sirens far away
...News on the radio happy birthday happy birthday happy birthday
They're at it again next door
This whole floor I swear
They're out to drive me crazy
Not right now I'm high as a cloud I'm soft and gray and lazy
...Neon in the window
...Sirens far away
...News on the radio happy birthday happy birthday happy birthday
Fly me
out the window.
Somewhere far away
Singing on the radio
