The blackest eyes I've ever seen like moonstones shine
And all the while behind the dancing eyes the boy crying.
He creeps like ivy on the stairs, you know I liked him then
When we would sit and drink for hours and watch the sidewalk spin.
No no no.
I don't wanna hear your secrets.
I don't share your pain.
I don't wanna know about the wrinkles in your bed
And I don't wanna know about the ghost inside your haunted head,
Inside your haunted head.
I don't need your tragedy and I won't share the blame
You can't keep your promises, you just keep naming names
He laid his troubles out to me like a deck of playing cards,
Well don't you know that I can tell the kings and jokers well apart.
No no no.
