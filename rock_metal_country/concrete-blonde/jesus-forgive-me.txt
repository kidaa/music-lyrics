Oh, Jesus, please forgive me for the things I'm about to say
I killed you in my mind today
I cut you up, I watched you bleed
I killed you in my heart today
For everything you did to me
I murdered you a hundred times
I shot you dead and never cried
I killed you in my mind today
I laughed and watched you die
Screaming at me all on fire
Liar, liar, liar
I buried you with my desire
Liar, liar, liar
I buried you so far below
Liar, liar, liar
I hate to see you go
Oh, Jesus, please forgive me
Oh, Jesus, please forgive me
On my knees beside my bed
Liar, liar, liar
I'm sorry for the things I said
Liar, liar, liar
I've washed the sheets a million times
Liar, liar, liar
I'm paying for my crime
Oh, Jesus, please forgive me
Oh, Jesus, please forgive me
Oh, Jesus, please forgive me
Oh, Jesus, please forgive me
Oh, Jesus, please forgive me
Oh, Jesus, please forgive me
I killed you in my mind today
Oh, Jesus, please forgive me
I killed you in my mind today
Somehow
