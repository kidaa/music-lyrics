I was walking down the street early this morning
Past the graveyard, voices whisper to me.
I was walking down the street, early this morning
And the silver tears of rain hung from the leaves
And I swear I heard the voices singing to me...
Singing to the rhythm of the beat of my feet,
I swear I heard the voices singing to me -
Keep on, keep on, keep on.
Still in Hollywood!
oh WOW! Thought I'd be out of here by now.
Still in Hollywood!
My, my I'm running on a wheel and I don't know why
I don't know why.
And on the bus today, I met the queen of L.A. -
At least she said she was and who am I to say?
She was sixty-five and full of life,
She had purple-painted cheeks
And glitter on her eyes
And the troll on the corner, I flipped him a quarter
And he looked at me and smiled.
He wasn't abused, he wasn't confused,
He had nothing to gain and less to lose in Hollywood
oh WOW! Thought I'd be out of here by now.
Still in Hollywood!
My, my I'm running like a rat and I don't know why
And so it's three A.M., I'm out walking again.
I'm just a spot on the sidewalk in a city of sin.
He doesn't give a fuck, he's living under a truck.
You know it coulda been me, guess it's just my luck.
But I swear I hear the voices singing to me -
Keep on, keep on, keep on.
Still in Hollywood...
