The prey of the beast screamed
bloody murder
The line is so fine between
hoping and hurting
Former believers they beg for release
As love looking down on them
smiles and picks his teeth
Trapped in between heaven and hell
he knows all the secrets
and don't want to tell
There's nowhere to run and there's
nowhere to hide
Love knows you all too well
He will find you
Love is the ghost haunting your head
Love is the killer you thought
was your friend
Love is the creature who lives
in the dark
Sneaks up, will stick you
and painfully pick you apart
Love is a poet, love sings the songs
Pointing his finger you follow along
Voice are calling,
the monster wants out of you
paws you and claws you, you try not to fall
Love is the leech, sucking you up
Love is a vampire, drunk on your blood
Love is the beast that will
tear out your heart
Hungrily lick it and
painfully pick it apart
Love is a ghost, haunting your head
Love is the killer you thought
was your friend
Love is the teacher who lives in the dark
Sneak up and stick you
and painfully pick you apart
