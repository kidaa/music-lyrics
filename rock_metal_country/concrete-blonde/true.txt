Well when I've had enough
I'll get a pick-up truck and I'll drive away,
I'll take my last ten bucks just as far as it will go.
Well sometimes I'm easily fooled,
Take a painful step and I get knocked back two.
I do all I can and it's all I can do to be true.
And if I had the choice I'd take the voice I got
Cause it was hard to find.
You know I've come too far to wind up right back where I started.
And they tell me who I should be,
I'll never let those monkeys make a mess of me.
I am who I am and it's all I can do,
But I'm true.
One more sunrise
Open my eyes up - true
One more sunset
Lay my head down - true
They talk you up and then they talk you down
And you begin to doubt.
Sometimes the reasons seem so very far away.
But I'd stop breathing today,
Cause if I can't walk proud, I'd rather walk away.
I do all I am and it's all I can do,
But I'm true.
I'd give all I am and I'd give it to you.
