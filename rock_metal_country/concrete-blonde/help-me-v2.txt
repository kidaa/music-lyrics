your lyrics to ";help me"; are wrong as are most of the ones from FREE, but i
couldn't let you keep the wrong lyrics to the best Concrete Blonde song on
the home page. The lyrics are as follows: 
Maybe it's twist of fate 
but the days and the nites and the nites and days 
are all tossing and turning and turning and burning inside my brain 
maybe i'm finally insane, but i dont know what i believe anymore 
its like im caught in some revolving door going over and over and over and
over and 
teach me how to pray 
tell me what to say 
help me 
help me 
help me find my way 
i never could play their games 
you know that all their faces look the same 
and i wont give up wont give in 
you know i never want to be like them 
well im ticking away like time 
you know im out of synch and im out of my mind 
you know i used to know a truth from a lie just by looking in their eyes 
carry me away 
further and further and further every day 
help me 
help me 
help me find my way 
Im hanging by a thread 
and the waves of confusion fall down on my head 
and when i think of all the things you said 
well the words fall dead 
higher every day 
a price i swore id never pay 
help me 
help me 
help me find my way 
help me find my way, way, way....
