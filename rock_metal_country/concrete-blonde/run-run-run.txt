You go crazy
You get tossed
You go running around 
Until you know you're gonna fall off
He knows what you need he, knows how much, how much you want
Knock familiar,
Welcome in,
Can't believe that you let him
introduce you as a friend.
But you're always polite
in case you need him again
No not again,
No not again.
Can't believe the way I see you
Run, Run, Run,
Can't believe the way you bleed when you
Run, Run, Run,
Are you having fun?
Run-
Hands are shaking. Lips are cracked
You swore I heard you swear that you were
Never coming back, but...
one more time. Just one more night
and once again, you lost the fight 
fight
So fight a little harder now.
Can't believe the way you bleed when you
Run, Run, Run
Can't believe the way you need to
Run, Run, Run
Are you still as young as you started
When you started to run?
Can't believe the way I see you
Run, Run, Run,
Can't believe the way you bleed when you
Run, Run, Run,
Are you having fun?
Run, Run, Run,
`till you drop.
