Like a ghost - is the curtain
in the white light of the morning -
Dancing in the morning
are you there - are you there?
And a shadow - like a sadness
falling all across the garden
Dancing in the garden
are you there, are you there?
Shine on, friend. Goodnight
Why then then darkening of the light
And the leaves at my feet
whisper sounds so familiar -
are you there? Are you there?
Where the clouds pull apart
and the moon changes faces
in the quiet secret places
are you there? Are you there?
