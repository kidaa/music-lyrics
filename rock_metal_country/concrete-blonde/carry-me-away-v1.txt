today i went & bought myself a bottle
...like we used to do
reminded me of you.
today i saw a train roll by a river
blowing off her steam
reminded me of me
that's when i threw the bottle in the river
then i started running for the train
carry me away carry me away
its seven o nine california time
whoever said it was a small world was either a liar or a fool
cause it's not true
and any promise you'd make is as easy to break
as the plastic people on a wedding cake so says you
but you know, i do
time and time and time and time away i hear you thinking
time and time and time and time
we' keep trying crying lying and drinking
carry me away carry me away
