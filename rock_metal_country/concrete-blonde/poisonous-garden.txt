The stars above shine down below
The fever you hold on this night
deathly cold
I can feel from this side of the door
I can feel Eleanor
He said, sun don't rise...
He said sun don't shine
He said don't bring tomorrow
to justify tonight
The moon is full - the stars are bright
and the sky is a poisonous garden
tonight.
Sip your tequila. Give me some time
to unlearn all I've learned for the
spring to unwind
and then came your sweet gentle mouth
I began to move mine.
They knew with the dawn -
They knew with the day
They knew what they had
would be yound naked prey
and attacked from all sides
by a world filled with
poison and hate
Eleanor trembles, Eleanor moans.
Somehow, this body is someone
she always has known
She cries tears on his chest
O so silent and slow -
She said please don't do. Please don't go -
And she cried and she died in his arms
And he cried nevermore
The moon is full, the stars are bright
and the sky is a poisonous garden
tonight.
