There's a crack in the mirror
and a bloodstain on the bed -
There's a crack in the mirror
and a bloodstain on the bed -
O you were a vampire and baby
I'm walking dead
O you were a vampire and baby
I'm walking dead
I got the ways and means
to New Orleans I'm going
down by the river
where it's warm and green
I'm gonna have drink, and walk around
I got a lot to think about oh yeah
There's a rocking chair by the window
down the hall
I hear something there in the shadow
down the hall
O you were a vampire and now I am
nothing at all
O you were a vampire and now I am
nothing at all
They used to dance in the garden in the
middle of the night
They used to dance in the garden in the
middle of the night
They were naked as the day they were
born skin all bone-china white
O you were a vampire
and I may never see the light
