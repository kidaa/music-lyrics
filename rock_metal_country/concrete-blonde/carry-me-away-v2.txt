Today I went & bought myself a bottle,
like we used to do,
reminded me of you.
Today I saw a train roll by the river,
blowing off the steam,
reminded me of me.
That's when I threw the bottle in the river.
That's when I started running for the train.
There's nothing that you need I can't deliver,
carry me away, carry me away.
Make it seven o nine California time,
whoever said it was a small world was either a liar or a fool,
cause it's not true.
And any promise we make is as easy to break
as the plastic people on a wedding cake so says you
but you know, I do.
I hear you thinking,
from far away.
If ya keep lying & crying & trying & drinking,
I'm gonna carry me away, carry me away.
If you think about me,
from far away,
I hope you find it with me or without me.
Carry me away, carry me away,
carry me away, carry me away,
carry me away, carry me away.
