Oh Kim
Your diary said -
The voices calling you from the edge.
They finally called you away -
You know I hear them too,
They're telling me to stay.
Oh Kim
Remember when
We made a million plans and we believed them.
Angry words ring in my head
I'd give every song I got in me
To get it back again.
She said, I could
She said hold on, hold out
Cause it's good.
She said it's right.
She said hold on, hold out
Cause I know that you can fight.
I know you can
You're right again.
There is an easy way
Out of this world.
I'm staying.
I wonder why?
It may be all I have,
But it's mine, it's mine.
