Lord, please don't take me away.

Rabid child stays at home, talks on a CB
Truckers pass calling out their handles to the kid
Chess Piece Face and The Big Duluth call her every day
";Hammer down"; and ";rabbit ears"; are the only words they know

Hammer down
Hammer down, rabbit ears
Hammer down, rabbit ears
Hammer down, rabbit ears, hammer down

If you pass the rabid child say ";hammer down"; for me
The rabid child
The rabid child
The rabid child
