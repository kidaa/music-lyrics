I returned a bag of groceries
Accidently taken off the shelf
Before the expiration date
I came back as a bag of groceries
Accidently taken off the shelf
Before the date stamped on myself

Did a large procession wave their Did a
Torches as my head fell in the basket, large pro-
And was everybody dancing on the casket? cession dance?

Now it's over I'm dead and I haven't done anything that I want now it's over
Or, I'm still alive and there's nothing I want to do

I will never say the word
";Procrastinate"; again; I'll never
See myself in the mirror with my eyes closed
I didn't apologize for
When I was eight and I made my younger brother
Have to be my personal slave

Did a large procession wave their Did a
Torches as my head fell in the basket, large pro-
And was everybody dancing on the casket? cession dance?

Now it's over I'm dead and I haven't done anything that I want now it's over
Or, I'm still alive and there's nothing I want to do

So So I won't
Sit sit at home
And anymore
And and you won't
And see my head in
And the window
And and I won't
And be around
And ever anymore
And and I'll be up there on the wall at the store

I returned a bag of groceries
Accidently taken off the shelf
Before the expiration date
I came back as a bag of groceries
Accidently taken off the shelf
Before the date stamped on myself

Did a large procession wave their Did a
Torches as my head fell in the basket, large pro-
And was everybody dancing on the casket? cession dance?

Now it's over I'm dead and I haven't done anything that I want now it's over
Or, I'm still alive and there's nothing I want to do

Now it's over I'm dead and I haven't done anything that I want now it's over
Or, I'm still alive and there's nothing I want to do
