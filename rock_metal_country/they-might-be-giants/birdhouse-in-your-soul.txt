I'm your only friend
I'm not your only friend
But I'm a little glowing friend
But really I'm not actually your friend
But I am

Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
Who watches over you
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul

I have a secret to tell
From my electrical well
It's a simple message and I'm leaving out the whistles and bells
So the room must listen to me
Filibuster vigilantly
My name is blue canary one note* spelled l-i-t-e
My story's infinite
Like the Longines Symphonette it doesn't rest

Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
Who watches over you
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul

I'm your only friend
I'm not your only friend
But I'm a little glowing friend
But really I'm not actually your friend
But I am

There's a picture opposite me
Of my primitive ancestry
Which stood on rocky shores and kept the beaches shipwreck free
Though I respect that a lot
I'd be fired if that were my job
After killing Jason off and countless screaming Argonauts
Bluebird of friendliness
Like guardian angels its always near

Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
Who watches over you
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul

and while you're at it
Keep the nightlight on inside the
Birdhouse in your soul

Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul

Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch and while you're at it
Who watches over you keep the nightlight on inside the
Make a little birdhouse in your soul birdhouse in your soul

Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul

Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch and while you're at it
Who watches over you keep the nightlight on inside the
Make a little birdhouse in your soul birdhouse in your soul

Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul 




Notes

The Dial-a-Song version has the following significantly altered lyrics:

Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
He watches over you
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul

I have a secret to tell
Out when you're all by yourself
There's a time when even you get up and leave your nothing to dwell
I don't want to talk about that
And no one listens to that
But for the one who does, and she's the one you worry about
Don't you say anything
If you have anything to do with it

Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
He watches over you
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul

I'd like to cover the earth
With a fresh-baked yummy dessert
People couldn't live in it, but I think it's worth the money and hurt
'Cause I couldn't tolerate
All the empty places in the world

Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
He watches over you
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul

Make a little birdhouse in your soul

I don't feel thirty
Give me something to write on
I don't feel three hundred
Give me something to write on
