Long before the screen door slammed, she was out of Xenia
A stranger could have loved that town but she had to leave

I wish I'd gotten to know her before I fell in love
I could say who's to blame, say who's the man in this cautionary tale
But I swore I'd be true and I'll swear and I'll swear 'til Kitten's out of jail

It was like a TV show, the way she stole that car
Easy now to criticize, easy now to talk

I thought my luck was changing, I guess I was wrong
I could say who's to blame, say who's the man in this cautionary tale
But I swore I'd be true and I'll swear and I'll swear 'til Kitten's out of jail

Didn't want to be a slave
Just turned out that way

I wish I'd gotten to know her before I fell in love
I could say she's to blame, say she's the man in this cautionary tale
But I swore I'd be true and I'll swear and I'll swear 'til Kitten's out of jail
