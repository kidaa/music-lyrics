Tippy-toe to the front door, Mother,
'Cause there's a guy with a long, long fuse
And the one thing you can't hide is all the fear you feel inside
As the fuse is spelling out these words

Or else someone's gonna get ya Someone's gonna get ya
Someone's gonna get ya
Hide away folk family
Better hide away

Tippy-toe to the flat-bed, Father,
Because they're pouring out our gasoline
And sadly the cross-eyed bear's been put to sleep behind the stairs
And his shoes are laced with irony

Hide away folk family
Or else someone's gonna get ya Someone's gonna get ya
Someone's gonna get ya
Hide away folk family
Better hide away
