There has been a spacecraft sighted
Flying high above the sky
Sirens declare there's one among us from Venus

Volunteers, we need volunteers
Soldiers to meet them
Have no fear
Have no fear
You will be killed right away

I will date the girl from Venus
Flowers die and so will I
Yes, I will kiss the girl from Venus for science

I'm so brave
I'm so brave
I'll be her love slaveHe's so brave
He's so brave
He'll be her love slave forever

Yes, I will date the girl from Venus
Flowers die and so will I
Yes, I will kiss the girl from Venus for science

Let's get those missiles ready to destroy the universe!
