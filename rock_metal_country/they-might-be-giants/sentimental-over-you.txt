Never thought I'd fall
But now I hear the call
I'm getting sentimental over you
Things you say and do
Just thrill me through and through
I'm getting sentimental over you

Once I wondered why
I'd sit at home and sigh
I'm getting sentimental over you
Words cannot describe
This poetry inside
I'm getting sentimental over you

I thought I was happy, I could live with myself
Now I see that love is all that I'm thinking ofWon't you please be kind
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet and gentle
Be gentle with me
'Cause I'm getting sentimental over you

I thought I was happy, I could live with myself
Now I see that love is all that I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet and gentle
Be gentle with me
'Cause I'm getting sentimental over you
