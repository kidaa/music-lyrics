Which describes how you're feeling all the time
Which describes how you're feeling all the
Feeling all the time
There's this guy in the sky and he makes you want to
Want to make you sigh, like the time
When you felt like you're feeling all the time
And you sighed at the cracks in the ceiling all the time
You said ";I'm feeling fine"; but it didn't really rhyme
It didn't rhyme, overseas

Which describes how you're feeling all the time

It describes how you're feeling

Which describes how you're feeling all the time
When you lie that your life's unappealing all the time
But your lie doesn't rhyme with the word overseas
Overseas there's this guy
Who describes how you're feeling all the time
In his mind he can find how you're feeling all the time
From behind distant lines
Even straighter than his spine
Which is fine
Which is fine
And describes how you're feeling all the time
