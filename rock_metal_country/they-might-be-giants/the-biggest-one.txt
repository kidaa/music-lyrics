The water running down that pipe
Looks like a snake to me
By ";Doc's Sugar Bowl"; my coffee gets cold
Because I don't want to see that
I've got no one to blame but my fat self
I've got no one to blame but my fat self
I'm the biggest one
I'm the biggest one
I've got no one to blame but my fat self

Should have changed that stupid lock
Should have thrown away the key
No, no, not I, I will survive
Right down here on my knees 'cause
I've got no one to blame but my fat self
I've got no one to blame but my fat self
I'm the biggest one
I'm the biggest one
I've got no one to blame but my fat self
