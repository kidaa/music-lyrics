This song is dedicated to all you modern-day troubadors out there
And I think I know who you are

I got to get a job
Got to get some pay
My son's gotta go to art school
He's leaving in three days
And the TV's in Esperanto*
You know that that's a bitch
But alienation's for the rich
And I'm feeling poorer every day
Hey hey hey

Well I ain't feeling happy
About the state of things in my life
But I'm working to make it better
With a six of Miller High Life
Just drinking and a-driving
Making sure my dues get paid
Because alienation's for the rich
And I'm feeling poorer every day
Hey hey hey

Well I ain't feeling happy
About the state of things in my life
But I'm working to make it better
With a six of Miller High Life
Just drinking and a-driving
Making sure my dues get paid
Because alienation's for the rich
And I'm feeling poorer every day
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
