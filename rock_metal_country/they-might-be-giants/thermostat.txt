When the hands that operate the motor lose control of the lever
When the mind of its own in the wheel puts two and two together
When the indicator says you're out of oil should you continue driving anyway?
There's a thermostat that regulates the temperature
That might not be reliable
That should be disconnected

Turn it up, turn it down
Turn it up when the cold brings you down
When the heat bothers you turn it down
Turn it up, turn it down

As I was just saying
As I was just saying
As I was just telling you a minute ago

I was just talking and someone interrupted
Or was it a loud explosion?
Or is the thermostat engulfed in flames
Or is it just me?

Turn it up, turn it down
Turn it up when the cold brings you down
When the heat bothers you turn it down
Turn it up, turn it down

As I was just saying
As I was just saying
As I was just saying

Turn it up, turn it down
Turn it up when the cold brings you down
When the heat bothers you turn it down
Turn it up, turn it down

Turn it up, turn it down
Turn it up when the cold brings you down
When the heat bothers you turn it down
Turn it up, turn it down
