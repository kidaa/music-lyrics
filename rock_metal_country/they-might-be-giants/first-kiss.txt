The morning,
Alarming

I'm asleep but she's talking to me
She's walking round wearing all of my clothes
But we decided long ago 
We'd build a time machine and go

How bout another first kiss, kiss, kiss, yeah 
I want another first kiss 

Other women were too sentimental
Always worrying about their hair
Got tired of wasting all my time
Now I'm not worrying at all

How bout another first kiss, kiss, kiss, yeah 
I want another first kiss, kiss, kiss, yeah
I want another first kissThe clock bends
Shes waiting

I could tell you we belong together
I could tell you you belong with me
But we've run out of things to say
And we'll be happy anyway

So....

How bout another first kiss, kiss, kiss, yeah 
I want another first kiss, kiss, kiss, yeah
I want another first kiss
