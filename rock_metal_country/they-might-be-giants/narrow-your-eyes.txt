I don't want to change your mind
I don't want to think about your mind
They say love is blind
I don't think you're blind
You don't want to understand
And I don't want to shake your father's hand
And walk in the sand
And act like a man

I get on the bus
And ride past our stop
And though I'm late
I can't get off
I just can't bear to tell you some lies
And narrow your eyes
Narrow your eyes

We'll take back every thing we said
Split up all the things and move ahead
Forgot how you said
We'll split the side off the bed

I get on my bike
Ride down our block
Ride through the world
Through the green lights
But when I think of all your advice
I narrow my eyes
narrow my eyesI don't want to change your mind
I don't want to think about your mind
They say love is blind
I don't think you're blind

I get on the bus
Ride past our stop
And though I'm late
I can't get off
I just can't bear to tell you some lies
And narrow your eyes
Narrow your eyes

Now let's toast the sad cold fact
Our love's never coming back
And we'll race to the bottom of a glass
So narrow your eyes
Narrow your eyes
Narrow your eyes
Narrow your eyes
Narrow your eyes
Narrow your eyes
