We're in a road movie to Berlin
Can't drive out the way we drove in
So sneak out this glass of bourbon
And we'll go

We were once so close to heaven
Peter came out and gave us medals
Declaring us the nicest of the damned

Time won't find the lost
It'll sweep up our skeleton bones
So take the wheel and I will take the pedals

We're in a road movie to Berlin
Can't drive out the way we drove in
So sneak out this glass of bourbon
And we'll go 


Notes

The Dial-a-Song version which is closer to the version printed in the Flood liner notes goes as follows:

We're in a road movie to Berlin
Can't drive out the way you drove in
So sneak out this glass of bourbon
And we'll go

We were once so close to Heaven
Peter came out and gave us medals
Declaring us the nicest of the damned

You said you were the king of liars
And I believed you and called you sire
But I realize now that I have been deceived
