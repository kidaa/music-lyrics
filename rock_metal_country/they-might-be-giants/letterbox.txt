I'll never know what you'll find when you open up your letter box tomorrow
'Cause a little bird never tells me anything I want to know, she's my best 
friend, she's a sparrow
And I'll never never know what you never never never want to know when you know 
what you are, O.

If I had a pair of eyes on the back of my head for each time
You forgot to take out all the things you forgot to talk about when you took a 
bite out of my spine,
I would have a lot of eyes on the other side, wouldn't I? Wouldn't that just be 
fine.

Too late or soon to make noise about love and there's no time for sorrow
Run around in the rain with a hole in the brain till tomorrow

I'll never know what you'll find when you open up your letter box tomorrow
'Cause a little bird never tells me anything I want to know, she's my best 
friend, she's a sparrow
And I'll never never know what you never never never want to know when you know 
what you are, O.
