Come on baby turn that frown upside down
Tell me why you ain't been around
What is it brings you down?

We work the hardest to be the smartest we work
We work the hardest to be the smartest we work
We work the hardest to be the smartest we work
We work the hardest to be the smartest we work

And the big big whoredom scared me

No, no, baby I ain't convinced it ain't so bad as you paint it
There's plenty more heads of hair for us out there
We'll strike it rich, a monster switch monster
We'll strike it rich, a monster switch monster
We'll strike it rich, a monster switch monster
We'll strike it rich, a monster switch monster

But the big big whoredom scares me no no it doesn't do that
The big big whoredom scares me no no don't be sad
The big big whoredom scares me please please stop it
The big big whoredom scares me don't don't
The big big whoredom scares me please
The big big whoredom scares me no
The big big whoredom scares me
The big big whoredom scares me
The big big whoredom scares me
