Can I have this last dance, my darling?
Can I have this last dance with you?
I wanna dance the whole night tonight

And can I have this last dance, my darling?
Can I have this last dance with you?
These are the words that he told to the fellow next door

Mainstream, U.S.A.
I flipped that guy the bird
Mainstream, U.S.A.
Is all I wanna say

Mainstream, U.S.A.
I flipped that guy the bird
Mainstream, U.S.A.
Is all I wanna say

We are the world back off, fool
We are I'm talking to you
We are the world back off, fool

Mainstream, U.S.A.
I flipped that guy the bird
Mainstream, U.S.A.
Is all I wanna say 
Mainstream, U.S.A.
I flipped that guy the bird
Mainstream, U.S.A.
Is all I wanna say 



Notes

The lyrics above are as heard on the original Dial-a-Song version. The following verse is tacked on to the end of the LoFi DAS Online version, and is sung superimposed with the first verse in the Then version:

As I rode the subway this morning
There was a man with a boat beside me
And he tapped out rhythms with a smile on his face

And the tip of his finger
That he found on the floor
And these are the words that he told to the fellow next door
