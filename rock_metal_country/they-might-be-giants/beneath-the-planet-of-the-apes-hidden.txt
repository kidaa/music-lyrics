All my friends are beneath the Planet of the Apes
All my friends are 
All my friends are 
All my friends are beneath the Planet of the Apes
And when I get there 
I'll find my friends there
Deep inside the ground
Underneath the town 
Where the apes live
Where the apes live
You can't walk around
Because it is in town
All my friends are 
All my friends are
Beneath the Planet 
Of the Apes
