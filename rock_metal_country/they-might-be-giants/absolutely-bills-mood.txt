I was born in a lighthouse, my mother was the sea
I crawled to school each morning, when it occured to me
That life's just a mood ring we're not allowed to see
And this is what it said to me

My room is comfortably small
With rubber lining the walls
And there's someone always calling my name
He calls when I'm alone
And he calls when I'm not home
And he calls when I'm stuck out in the rain
I'm insane
I'm insane
I'm insane
I'm insane

Now listen all you swingers, don't you try to tag along
I know monkey see, but monkey's dead, for you it would be wrong
Put a dime in my jukebox, you'll only hear this song
And it won't be fun for long

Because my room is comfortably small
With rubber lining the walls
And there's someone always calling my name
He calls when I'm alone
And he calls when I'm not home
And he calls when I'm stuck out in the rain
I'm insane
I'm insane
I'm insane
I'm insane

Thank you
Thank you

My room is comfortably small
With rubber lining the walls
And there's someone always calling my name
He calls when I'm alone
And he calls when I'm not home
And he calls when I'm stuck out in the rain
I'm insane
I'm insane
I'm insane
I'm insane
