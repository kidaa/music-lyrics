I Can Hear You by They Might Be Giants. Made at the Edison Laboratories.

I can hear you
Just barely hear you
I can just barely hear you

This is a warning
Step away from the car
This car is protected by Viper

Guess where I am
I'm calling from the plane
I'll call you when I get there

You won't hear a buzz
But I'm buzzing you in
I'm buzzing you in

What's your order?
I can super-size that
Please bring your car around

I can hear you
Just barely hear you
I can just barely hear you
