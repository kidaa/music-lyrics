No More Mister Nice Guy
I Love the Dead
I've been thinking about it
Now I understand what he said

Ask me now
I understand the words that Alice said
I kick the rocks beneath me
I squint at the sun
Sad, sad, sad, sad
Why must I be sad?
The rows of dandelions growing all around me
Why must I be sad? sad, sad, sad
sad, sad, sad

No one knows these things but me and him
So I'm writing everything down in a spiral notebook
In the hopes that one day
Other people will feel as low as thisAsk me now
I understand the words that Alice said
I kick the rocks beneath me
I squint at the sun
Sad, sad, sad, sad
Why must I be sad?
The rows of dandelions growing all around me
Why must I be sad? sad, sad, sad
