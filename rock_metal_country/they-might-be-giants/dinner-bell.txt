I've been leaving on my things
So in the morning when the morning bird sings
There's still dinner on my dinner jacket
'Til the dinner bell rings

Experimental dog*
Salivating dog
Good dog
Waiting for the dinner bell to do the bell thing waiting for the dinner bell
Dinner bell dinner bell ring

I've been leaving on my things
So in the morning when the morning bird sings
There's still dinner on my dinner jacket
'Til the dinner bell rings

I don't want a pizza, I don't want a piece of experimental dog
Peanut brittle, I don't want a pear.
I don't want a bagel I don't want a bean I wouldn't like salivating dog
A bag of beef or a beer or a
Cup of chowder, corn, cake, or creamed cauliflower cause I'm good dog
Waiting for the dinner bell to do the bell thing waiting for the dinner bell
Dinner bell dinner bell ring

Shoulder, bicep, elbow, arm
Forearm, thumb, wrist, knuckle, palm
Middle, pinky, index, ring
Dinner bell dinner bell ding

I don't know whether I'd rather be having a bottle of vinegar experimental dog
I don't know whether I'd rather be having an egg.
I don't know whether I'd rather be having an order of bacon salivating dog
Or whether I'd rather be having a basket of garlic bread.
I don't know whether I'd rather be having some pie or good dog
Saving my appetite 'cause I'm
Waiting for the dinner bell to do the bell thing waiting for the dinner bell
Dinner bell dinner bell ring

I've been leaving on my things I've been leaving on
So in the morning when the morning bird sings the morning
There's still dinner on my dinner jacket on my
'Til the dinner bell does the bell thing
Dinner bell dinner bell do the bell thing
I'm waiting for the dinner bell to do the bell thing waiting for the ding
Dinner bell dinner bell ding ding ding
Waiting for the dinner bell to do the bell thing waiting for the ding
Dinner bell dinner bell ding ding ding
Waiting for the dinner bell to do the bell thing waiting for the ding
Dinner bell dinner bell ding
