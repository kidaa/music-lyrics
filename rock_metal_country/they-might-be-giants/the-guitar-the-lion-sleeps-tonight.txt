Who's that playing
Hey
The guitar?

Is it Jim?
I don't know
Is it Jim?
I don't know

In the spaceship, the silver space ship, the lion takes control
In the spaceship, the silver space ship, the lion takes control

Hey
Who's that playing
Hey
The guitar?

Hush my darling, be still my darling, the lion's on the phone
Hush my darling, be still my darling, the lion's on the phone

Hush my darling, be still my darling
Hey
Hush my darling, be still my darling
Hey

Turn it up
The guitar
I can't hear
The guitar

In the spaceship, the silver space ship, the lion waves good-bye
In the spaceship, the silver space ship, the lion waves good-bye

Hey
Who's that playing
Hey
The guitar?

Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey

I'd like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and to give thanks in his or her own way

All the people on this earth are truly one
All the people on this earth are truly one

Peace and tranquility
Peace and tranquility
Peace and tranquility
Peace and tranquility
Peace and tranquility
Tranquility base

That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind

All the people on this earth are truly one
All the people on this earth are truly one

Peace and tranquility
Peace and tranquility
Peace and tranquility
Peace and tranquility
Peace and tranquility
Tranquility base

That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind
