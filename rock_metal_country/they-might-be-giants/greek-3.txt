Some notes on how to pronounce certain things:
i, ei, y = pronounced like ee or ea, e.g., feel, read, etc.
ou= pronounced like oo, e.g., fool

Here's a direct retranslation of Greek#3 from Greek back to English. Some people thought it'd be fun to read. The English of course is not correct, but I translated it literally. In Greek too, some things sound weird. Like, the expression with the 'chicken and juice'. Never heard it before!

I just have two songs and a third one when it comes out*
I don't know where I found the body** since then it was there
Now I'm wandering around music's grave
For the two songs and the third one when it comes out

A rich guy told me ";bring a chicken and juice"; !
A poor guy told me that he can't tell
And now I'm waiting like a chicken for God on earth

I just have two songs and a third one when it comes out
I don't know where I found the body since it was there then
Now I'm wandering around music's grave
For the two songs and the third one when it comes out

I went to the White House and asked the rocket !
If he ever had a complex or something of the sort
but he started babbling like he as on TV
";I don't have just two songs
What do you want from me?";

I bought some new, tight bluejeans
and a 'baglama'***
And I told the ladies to be nice to me
So that I won't feel guilty for not going far
For the two songs and the third one when it comes out

* literally 'as soon as' but it would be too long
** literally 'dead body', cadaver
*** a very tiny traditional greek guitar-like instrument, a tiny 'bouzouki'
