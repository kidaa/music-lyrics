Down at the shore there's a place where there's no one vacationing
There's just the sound of the call of the wild overcoming the fear of the unknown

And I've got something to help you understand
Something waiting there beneath the sand
My metal detector
Is with me all of the time

I'm the inspector over the mine

Look past the volleyball look past the ball
Look past the squawking gull look past the gull
Ignore the mountain of discarded falderal

'Cause I've got something to make you understand
Something hidden there underneath the land
My metal detector
Is with me all of the time

I'm the inspector over the mine
Metal detector, watch it shine

Every seashell has a story to tell if you're listening
But underneath every shell there's a story as well if you've heard enough of the sea
Then everything on the top will just suddenly stop seeming interesting
So listen now to the sound of the things that are found underground

Don't need no volleyball don't need no volleyball
Don't need no squawking gull don't need no squawking gull
Don't need to look at any bathing beauty doll don't need to look at any doll

For I've got something to help you understand
Something waiting there beneath the sand
My metal detector
Is with me all of the time

I'm the inspector over the mine

Look past the volleyball look past the ball
Look past the squawking gull look past the gull
Ignore the mountain of discarded falderal

'Cause I've got something to make you understand
Something hidden there underneath the land
My metal detector
Is with me all of the time

I'm the inspector over the mine
Metal detector, watch it shine

Don't need no volleyball don't need no volleyball
Don't need no squawking gull don't need no squawking gull
Metal detector, all the time metal detector all the time
