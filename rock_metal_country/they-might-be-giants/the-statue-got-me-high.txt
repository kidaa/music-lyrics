The statue got me high
The statue got me high
The monument of granite sent a beam into my eye
The statue made me die
The statue made me die
It took my hand it killed me and it turned me to the sky

The stone it called to me
And now I see the things the stone has shown to me
A rock that spoke a word
An animated mineral it can be heard

And though I once preferred a human being's company
They pale before the monolith that towers over me

The statue got me high
The statue got me high
The truth is where the sculptor's chisel chipped away the lie
The statue made me fry
The statue made me fry
My coat contained a furnace where there used to be a guy

The stone it called to me
And now I see the things the stone has shown to me
A rock that spoke a word
An animated mineral it can be heard

And as the screaming fire engine siren filled the air
The evidence had vanished from my charred and smoking chair
And what they found was just a statue
Standing where the statue got me high
And what they found was just a statue
Standing where the statue got me high

And now it is your turn
Your turn to hear the stone and then your turn to burn
The stone it calls to you
You can't refuse to do the things it tells you to

And as the screaming fire engine siren fills the air
The evidence will vanish from your charred and smoking chair
And what they found was just a statue
Standing where the statue got me high
And what they'll find is just a statue
Standing where the statue got you high
