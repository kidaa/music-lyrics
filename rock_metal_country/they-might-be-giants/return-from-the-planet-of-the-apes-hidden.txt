Cornellius Cornellius, I miss you ape
I miss you ape
I miss your toffee cape
I miss your toffee cape, Cornellius, Cornellius, you were my favorite ape
I've got to get back to that crazy planet that they call the planet of the apes
and find Cornellius, my favorite ape
I miss his toffee cape, I say toffee - some would just say tan
but I'm a sophisticated guy so I call it toffee
