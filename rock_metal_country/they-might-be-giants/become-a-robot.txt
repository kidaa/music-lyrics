Here's hoping you don't hoping you don't
Become a robot clang clang
Clang, clang, whoops, too late
Here's hoping you don't hoping you don't
Become a robot clang clang
Clang, clang, whoops, too late

Let's stick together 'cause we're number 8*
Let's stick to numbers 'cause we're great*

Here's hoping you don't hoping you don't
Become a robot clang clang
Clang, clang, whoops, too late

Hey!
Wait!

Here's hoping you don't hoping you don't
Harbor a deathwish* help help
Help, help, help yourself
Here's hoping you don't hoping you don't
Harbor a deathwish* help help
Help, help, help yourself

Hip, hip, horrific are the words we sing
Hip, hip, horrific is our thing

Here's hoping you don't hoping you don't
Become a robot help help
Help, help, help, help
Help, help, help 

Notes
*These lines are disputable. The liner notes to Then: The Earlier Years claim that the lines in the first bridge are as written here, and that in the second verse the line is ";harbor a wishnik."; Many fans claim to hear ";harbor a deathwish"; or ";harbor a penguin,"; but ";deathwish"; seems the most likely. Others hear ";number A/'cause we're gray"; in the first bridge rather than what is printed here.
