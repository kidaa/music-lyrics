Do you smile 'cause I'm funny? said the man
I wasn't joking and I meant the thing I said
Not at all, not at all
Said the woman to the man
I was thinking of an unrelated thing

Unconnected and free
No relationship to anything

How come you never look me in the eye?
Aren't you listening to me said the man
Not at all, not at all
Said the woman to the man
I'm still thinking of an unrelated thingSomewhere other than here
Something else besides the man

Please explain the expression on your face
Then I'll know what's beneath it said the man
No you won't, no you won't
Said the woman to the man
I'll be thinking of an unrelated thing
I'll be thinking of an unrelated thing
