Stomp Box speak my thought
Vent these voices from the dark
Shout Shout Shout Shout
Scream it out
Blast your missive
Tell the wordless message
Little Stomp Box
Tear it from my heart

Stomp Box, voice of fear
Pour the poison in my ear
Kill Kill Kill Kill
Kill me now
Free the demon
Hear the ceaseless screaming
Little Stomp Box
Tear it from my heartStomp Box speak my thought
Vent these voices from the dark
Shout Shout Shout Shout
Scream it out
Blast your missive
Tell the wordless message
Little Stomp Box
Tear it from my heart

Kill Kill Kill Kill
Kill me now
Free the demon
Hear the ceaseless screaming
Little Stomp Box
Tear it from my heart
