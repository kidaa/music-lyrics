As long as I remember -
I was left all by myself
When trouble crossed my way
I stood alone
My old man hit the bottle -
my mom was running scared
The old forgotten prayers turned
to stone
Im searching for identity -
I dont show who I am
The past  has cast a shadow over me
Like a bad religion -
the only one I know
I never had no shelter - never had
a place to go
A bad religion - my life
is make-believe
Bad religion - Im beggin for relief
I tried to break the circle - to
break the vicious spell
But the past is always heavy
on my mind
Im dancing with the devil -
a dangerous romance
A daring way to leave it all behind
Im searching for identity -
I dont know who I am
The past has cast a shadow over me
Like a bad religion -
the only one I know
I never had no shelter
never had a place to go
A bad religion - my life
is make-believe
Bad religion
I need someone to talk to -
someone to understand
I need a friend to lend a helping hand
Im gonna pull myself together -
shed this battered skin
Im ready for the challenge -
this losers out to win
Like a bad religion -
the only one I know
I never had no shelter -
never had a place to go
A bad religion - my life
is make-believe
Bad religion - Im beggin for
relief - bad religion
