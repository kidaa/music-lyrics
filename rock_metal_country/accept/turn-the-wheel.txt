Yeah - watch out !
She got loads o'money
A sugar daddy's car
Diamonds galore money she can burn
I think you know what I mean
Her eyes look from the window
Whats it gonna come down to
In the hush of the night suger daddy's don't know
Even through she tried to play the discreet
I've been yearnin' - I'm down on my bended knees
Wheels are turning - the night time favors me
It makes me feel alright - yeah
Turn the wheel around - everybody shout
Everybody shout out
If it's love that you need from a stranger
Turn around girl I got a word for you
And you know It don't matter what you contain
No it don't matter don't remember your name, no
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey
I know you like it but too blind to see
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey
I gotta know - i gotta know if it pass the test
You know what's gotta be turned around, babe
So take a hold of that wheel - get on back, babe
You gotta fantasy
I've been yearmin' - to put me down on my bended knees
Keep on turnin' -
I never ever knew
