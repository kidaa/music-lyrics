One step forward - two steps back
Living on the edge -
its as simple as that
Im no Mr. Lucky - Ive never been close
Im higher than some -
but Im lower than most
Just when you thought that
youd got it made
The bitch draws blood again
You sow as you reap - the same mistakes
Buddy rings the bell - begin the same
Bad habits - bad habits die hard
Bad habits - bad habits die hard
Im stuck in a rut -
but Im burning inside
I am what I am - just a low-down bum
Always end up in trouble -
just trying to be good
But with tumbling dice -
the sixes will come
Bad habits - bad habits die hard
I know I got a lot of bad habits
- bad habits die hard
I bet you got em too
One step forward - two steps back
I get caught in the middle -
nailed to the rack
Got a load of bad habits -
corrupted within
Im a freak of nature -
full of vices and sins
Just when you thought that youd
got it made
The bitch draws blood again
You sow as you reap -
the same mistakes
Buddy rings the bell - begin the game
Bad habits - bad habits die hard
Bad habits - bad habits die hard
I know I got a lot of bad habits
- bad habits die hard
Everybodys got bad habits -
bad habits die hard
