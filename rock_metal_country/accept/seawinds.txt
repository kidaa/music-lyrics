As I'm walking through the rain
Sit beside the room all night long 
In the grey December morning
I decide to leave my home.................... 
Took a train to nowhere - far away - far away 
Many thousand miles away
When the moon took to the stars
Dreamed about the days - days gone by - days gone by 
In the night, the seawinds are calling
And the city is far far away
Soon the sea turns to darkness
It is night and the seawinds are calling
Seawinds gone, seawinds gone 
Took thousand miles away
When the moon took to the stars
Dreamed about the days - days gone by 
I've been told so many stories
Of dreams my plans have made
So is no illusion - sail away - sail away 
In the night, the seawinds are calling
And the city is far far away
Soon the sea turns to darkness
It is night and the seawinds are calling
Seawinds gone, seawinds gone
