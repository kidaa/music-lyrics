I know the time is right
Blame it n your passionplay
But I know it's just a game
Why don't we fight the fight
Evil it's not here to stay
Broken words are broken ways
I can see it in your eyes
You love the masquerade
And you don't seem to care
Hellhammer - hell - Hellhammer
Living out your fantasy, yeah
Never evr sell your soul
Don't surrender your control
No tenderhearted fools, yeah
Hellhammer - hell - Hellhammer
In your lap of luxury
Hellhammer - hell - Hellhammer
Spread your wings and you'll be free
Hellhammer - hell - Hellhammer
Living on the edge won't save ya
Hellhammer - hell - Hellhammer
Hellhammer
Hold on - on your pwn
All for one - together we make it
You and me - can touch the sky
One for all - in the name of love
Only we can change the world
Make your dreams reality
One foe all - it's the human key
Don't lose control - don't lose your soul
Stop living out you destiny, yeah
Hellhammer - hell - Hellhammer
Living out your fantasy, yeah
Hellhammer - hell - Hellhammer
It's making too long the time has come
Hellhammer ...
