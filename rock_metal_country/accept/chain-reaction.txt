Another lousy night
Out on the tiles again
Tired of the routine                                 					
I never ever get it right
I've been lookin' for some action
To divert my attention
Got no rhyme or a reason
Feel the sign, feel the time, the time of the season
Tonight I'm gonna make the grade
Out of the cold nothing can stop
Nothing gonna stop me now - no !
I know I need chain reactions
I know I need heavy action
I know I need chain reaction
All I'm lookin' for is the attractions -
yeah Another boning day
I couldn'tt take no more
Turnin' down the blue mood
As long as I'm runnin' with the back I know I'm free
Chain reaction - Life atraction
