Im victimized and tantalized
Brutalized and chained
Theyll devastate - intoxicate
Theyre driving me insane - forever
They regulate - investigate
Complicate my life
Everyday insanity
Theres nothing going right -
I mean forget it
Ive been there before
Cant take it no more
Thats why Im like a loaded gun
A man with a mission
Like a loaded gun
Im human ammunition
They mutilate and penetrate
They masturbate my brains
When all I need for sanity
Is love to ease my pain
Im tortured, sick and tired
Im that weapon to be fired
Overloaded - unexploded
Dont you make me cross the final
line
Ive been there before
I cant take it no more
Thats why Im like a loaded gun
Im a man with a mission
Like a loaded gun
You can pull my trigger
Just like a loaded gun
On a social collision
See my eyes - I mesmerize
Read my lips - its time to cut the crap
Ive been there before
I cant take it no more
Thats why Im like a loaded gun
A man with a mission
Like a loaded gun
Im human ammunition
Like a loaded gun
On a social collision
Like a loaded gun
Im ready to explode -
like a loaded gun
