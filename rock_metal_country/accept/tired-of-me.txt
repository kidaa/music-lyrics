But people have ...
and nobody wants you 
... girl riding down highway
Driving passing by ...
got nobody I say 
Tired of me she's got my back to the wall
Tired of me there's nothing at all
Tired of me so I can't call 
Laughing at ... you and your way
But give you freedom, that's what I say
I know, believe what I say 
Tired of me she's got my back to the wall
Tired of me there's nothing at all
Tired of me so I can't call
