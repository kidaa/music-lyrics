Beyond the hill, of fantasy
Ha, tell ya
Take care of you, beware of his magical plan
It hurts, breaks your soul, burns your mind
Never believe, never never
Believe the tales of mystical force 
Please, save us
Bring us his trembling heart
Please, save us
Bring us his trembling heart 
Black hill castle, there in the dark
Hear the thunder, watch the spark
Ha ha ha
Can't you see?
Way of life, It's ...
I saw his sinister face
Speaks your name, don't listen
Otherwise, your part of the scene 
He tears you from the ground and takes you higher and higher.
His magic's all around, his eyes are burning like fire
Repeat 
He tears you............
