They terrorize and
tyrannize democracies
Their narrow minds still nothing
learned from history
The seeds of hate acquired from
their ancestry
Spreading like a cancer in societies
Theyve got the poison inside
Rivers of pesticide
Skin-headed minions -
theyre deaf, dumb and blind
Machind-like in body - robotic in mind
Stone evil - inherited sin
Stone evil - infected from within
They cant leave it -
they cant break the spell
Under orders to obey
It was meant to last a thousand years
It took the world into dismay
Stone evil - stone evil
If youre gonna throw the torch at us
Dont expect to not get burned
Its time to stand - and fight the right
This is the lesson we have learned
Theyre marching to a different
beat and glorify
The darkest times when innocent 
were crucified
They paralize and sterilize the
masses minds
They desecrate mans dignity -
desensitize
Theyve got the poison inside
Rivers of pesticide
Skin-headed minions -
theyre deaf, dumb and blind
Machine-like in body -
robotic in mind - evil
Stone evil - inherited sin
Stone evil - infected from within
Stone evil - inherited sin
Stone evil
