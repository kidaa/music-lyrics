Man he thought the world and just the law was just a lie 
Free me now - free me now - free me now 
Can't you hear the laughter of the devil in the night
Sure there must be soldiers have no fairer place to fight 
Free me now - free me now - free me now 
Killing must be faster of the nation ...
Can't you see the widows - without home and shedding tears 
Free me now - free me now - free me now
