My bones are trembling
Veins are filled with ice
I see you swagger through
Your boots are shiny too
I still feel your torture
Messing up me life
I cannot forget
How you showed me dispise
Deep down in the gravel
I lie and wait for relieve
And I hear the orders you scream
Sounds like a choir to me
Stand tight - all right
And a assume the position - we all stand together
Stand tight - all right
And a assume the position - we all stand together
I know I am unconscious
Just what you like to see
You say you've got to drill me
And you let me kiss your gun
I have to clean your boats
In every way you like
You deny my human right
You don't make it easy
And I am so down
So devoted and humbled to you
What more can a slave remain
Before he floods away
Stand tight - all right
And a assume the position - we all stand together
Stand tight - all right
And a assume the position - we all stand together
Stand tight - all right
- we all stand together
- all right
- we all stand together
- all right
- we all stand together
- all right
- we all stand together
ALL RIGHT!!!
