And holy pray ... before she went to bed
Her body was imaculate, her hair was solid gold
Pretend she's still a virgin for ...
But no one could imagine how the girl would need a man
She dreamed about a better life
So sadly, so sadly 
Take him in my heart
It's a long way to start
With a man who doesn't make sence for you
Take him in my heart
It's a long way to start
If you don't know which way to go 
One morning she was feeling bad and didn't go to school
She went to town to find a man who'd watch her ...
Moving hard and ... she was walking down the street
Suddenly she saw a man, the man she dreamed to meet
Helluva guy, you're looking good - don't you think it's allright
Too lonely now, I need a man so badly - so badly 
Take him in my heart
It's a long way to start
With a man who doesn't make sence for you
Take him in my heart
It's a long way to start
If you don't know which way to go 
Man look in her eyes and took her ... by the hand
I want you here with me, but I can't understand
Why don't you leave your castle and try to live your life
Without a hole ... and doing all that's right
You think you are the greatest and ... is your own
Forever you will feel so good so help me - so help me 
Take him in my heart
It's a long way to start
With a man who doesn't make sence for you
Take him in my heart
It's a long way to start
If you don't know which way to go
