Stand for what you are
Trust in what you're fighting for
No time on looking back
You're on your own
Stand for what you are
Trust in what you're living for
Open up the door on time for looking back
You're on your own
You say that time's been passing by
Feeling there is nothing concrete
Living for the moment
Blinded by your dreams
All you're saying you can't day
It's getting harder every day
You can't change who you are
Something you gotta face
You fell for promises
No one really ever made
Invisible pictures come true
Going through changes
Hoping that they never fade
Hold on don't reach for the stars
Can't spot time's been passing by
It's like living on a one way street
Stop trying to escape from the real world
And hanging by your string
Still you're saying you can't hold on ...
All you're saying you can't day
It's getting harder every day
You can't change who you are
Something you gotta face
You gotta stand for what you are
Trust in what you're fighting for
No time on looking back
You're on your own
You gotta stand for what you are
Trust in what you're fighting for
You gotta face it - make in on your own 2
Stand 4 what u r
