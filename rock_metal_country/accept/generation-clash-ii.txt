Warnings surround you
That life aint long
Same old stories
Youve heard em before
They tell you to listen
To be like theyve been
You carry a burden
Whatever you do
They never approve of
The things that you do
Revolution
In the heart of your home
But what do they do
To comfort you
At times when you dont feel alright
Generation Clash
Generation Clash - you got
the guts to go
Bitching forever
For wasting time
You better not worry
Youre doing alright
They tell you to listen
To be like theyve been
But what do they do
To comfort you
At times when you dont feel alright
Generation Clash
Generation Clash - you got
the guts to go
Generation Clash -
kiss those times goodbye
Generation Clash - you got
the guts to go
Generation Clash
Generation Clash - you got
the guts to go
Generation Clash -
kiss those times goodbye -
the times are gone for good
Generation Clash - you got
the guts to go
Generation Clash - oh its the
generation Clash
Generation Clash - nothing ventured
nothing gained - so get alive
Generation Clash ...
