I just don't believe
How I keep a runnin'
Women keep me lovinn'
Give me all their funnin'
Rock of life seems like a hell of a load
Like a hell of a load
Crazy horse rockin' somehow I belong
Here in the dark of the nihgt
When pushin' comes to showin' you never know
How much a man like me can take
Rock of life seems like a hell of a load
Rock - rock of life
You give me just another - just another
Just another X-T-C
Rats in my callar somehow I belong hore
In the back of the street
Switch blade passion
Why don't you see it for the final scene
Rock - rock of life
It gives me just another - just another
Just another X-T-C
Just another  *2
Just another - X-T-C, yeah !
Aaah - It gives me just another - X-T-C
It gives me just another - X-T-C
X-T-C, babe
It gives me just another - X-T-C
When you hold on
It gives me just a - just a - just another X-T-C
I need Your X-T-C
Need your X-T-C, yeah - when you hold on
When you hold on - to my X-T-C
