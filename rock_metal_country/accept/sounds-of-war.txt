...
Mighty war machines are on their way
I'm ... here no place to stay
Time will come, we'll have to pray
And then the war will come someday
... endless fear
Don't you see that the point is near 
Shooting guns I hear from everywhere louder
Bombs are falling out of ... great power
Tanks are coming, beware of machines
Children are suffering and cry for help
Tanks are coming ...
... houses and everything around
The useless crying, seems to be the end
Seems to be the end of this rotten land 
I was born, tell me why
I was born, tell me why 
Killing children who doesn't know hatred
Torturing people what's all this mess
Tell me the sence of useless life
Killing each other with ... 
I was born, tell me why
I was born, tell me why 
Tanks are coming ...
... houses and everything around
No use crying, seems to be the end
Seems to be the end of this rotten land 
I was born, tell me why
I was born, tell me why
