How about a mega-store
Full of guns to start a war
Were selling toys for fatal games
Well take the credit not the blame
When they shoot the neighbours
Shoot the daughters
Shoot the sisters
Shoot the muthas
Its a billion dollar industry
All in the same name of liberty
Guns r us
Guns r us - big toys buy big toys at
Guns r us
Guns r us
Living out the fantasy
Buy a dozen - get one free
Radar-guided - laser speed
Devastation guaranteed
Then they shoot the neighbours
Shoot the daughters
Shoot the brothers
Shoot the dog
Its a billion dollar industry
A constitutional guarantee
Guns r us
Guns r us - big toys buy big toys at
Guns r us - get a free magazine
with your M-16
Guns r us - its a one-day-sale
Gunned down int he neighbourhood
In the same of brotherhood
Black or white aint worth a dime
Cut em down in zero time

Its a human thrill just to shoot to

Then they shoot the neighbours
Shoot the daughters
Shoot the sisters
Shoot the muthas
Its a billion dollar industry
All in the name of liberty
