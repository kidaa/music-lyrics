Come have some fun, we're gonna run today - run today
Playing on a stage on Sunday night
You'll have a sound that's burning in your brain - in your brain 
Hey little woman Accept tonight
Come rock and roll and feel allright
Hey little woman dance tonight
Hey woman, don't you fight
Hey little woman Accept tonight
Come rock and roll and hold me tight again 
Rockin on stage like a hurricane
Sound goes in your face - right down your mind - down your mind
Come everybody let's move around
Give me all your ... I'll give you ... - give you ... 
Hey little woman Accept tonight
Come rock and roll and feel allright
Hey little woman dance tonight
Hey woman, don't you fight
Hey little woman Accept tonight
Come rock and roll and hold me tight again 
That's rock and roll - that's rock and roll
