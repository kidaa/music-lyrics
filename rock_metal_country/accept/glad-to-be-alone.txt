I don't like such stupid people
With their ...
I don't like your worthless friends
With the talk about their problems
With a can of small talk, they'll feel good
But they are fools 
I don't like to sit beside you
In your brand new car
I don't like to show you need
Every day and night 
You come into my life like someone
Being a star, but you are no more
After a few days with you
I was glad to be alone again 
Glad - so glad - so glad - alone
Glad - so glad - so glad - alone 
If you have to work for nothing
... a day
Tears and sweat I had in future
Not much more to live 
You come into my life like someone
Being a star, but you are no more
After a few days with you
I was glad to be alone again
Glad - so glad - so glad - alone
Glad - so glad - so glad - alone
