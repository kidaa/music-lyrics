Trying to find my ride
C'mon, let's go to town
I wanna live my life 
Lady I'm lovin' you
...
Woman I lose my way
Cause you can't take me high 
Won't you come to me my love - Lady Lou
Won't you come to me my love
Won't you, won't you, won't you 
Yeah I see you, come here to me
I said Lay Lady Lou
Funny, I stand alone
I gave you all my life
Honey don't fool me now
'Cause I don't wanna die 
Won't you come to me my love - Lady Lou
Won't you come to me my love
Don't you want me baby 
Won't you come to me my love - Lady Lou
Won't you come to me my love
Won't you, won't you, won't you 
Won't you come to me my love - Lady Lou
Won't you come to me my love
Don't you want me baby
