The hot music's growing burns, my head's playing tricks
I know it's going, going to my brain
Get burnt up before the feeling
... running through my veins
Flying, dying, crying all night long 
Roll on
Never stop your moving, feel the night no don't lose it
Try ...
Ready for the spark
...
It's too much, much too much
He's the winner, he's the sinner, ... 
Thunder and lightning, ...
Thunder and lightning, stand it if you can
Squeezing and teasing, touch you deep inside
Thunder and lightning, feel it in your mind 
He shows he's plain, ... back to me
..., all he couldn't be
By the way, before ...
...
