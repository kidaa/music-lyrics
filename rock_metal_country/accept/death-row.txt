Im dead meat - you took away my rights
To be a part of your society
A life-time in prison wouldnt justify
You wanna blow away a sucker -
so I have to die
Im still waiting for the final call
I wanna meet my maker -
Im ready to go
Kill me - kill me - kill me -
please, kill me
Give me a reason why youre gonna
let me wait
Some kind of punishment before
you terminate
Youre taking my life for your
peace of mind
So lets go - start the show
Death row - Im ready to go - death row
Let me die - let me go
Death row - Im ready to go - death row
Let me die - let me go - death row
Im a dead man walking so get
outta my face
Rather die like a man than rotting
this way
I hate you and you hate me
You can come and kiss my dignity
Youre taking my life for your
peace of mind
So lets go - start the show
Death row - Im ready to go - death row
Let me die - let me go
Death row - Im ready to go - death row
Im ready to go - death row - death row
Your justice is not mine
You punish a crime with another crime
If you need to kill me for your 
peace of mind
Then lets go - start the show
Death row - Im ready to go - death row
Let me die - let me go
Death row - Im ready to go - death row
Im ready to go - death row - death row
Death row - open up cause here I come
Death row - knock, knock, knocking
Im no heros son
Death row - theres no tears that 
you can sell
Death row - paid my ticket through 
the gates of hell
Death row - death row
Let me die - let me go
Death row - death row
