You wake me up, you make me glad
Even if I'm really out of control
You stand by me when I stumble and fall 
I'm confused tonight - I'm feeling blue
You'll find a way to help me through
Wan't you tonight 'cause I feel time is right
Need your sleazy love deep down inside 
I can't give you nothing but love babe
Tried to change, but it's pretty hard
I wanna be no hero, but I know I would die for you
I wanna be no hero, but I'm ready to fight for you
I wanna be no hero, oh, but I can give you love 
Life is a mess - oh yeah 
I know that living's not easy with me
Watching my love ...
You drived away all my sorrows and pains
My love is strong, more than a game 
I wanna be no hero - need you tonight
I wanna be no hero - stay by my side
I wanna be no hero - need you tonight
I wanna be no hero - oh but I can give you love
