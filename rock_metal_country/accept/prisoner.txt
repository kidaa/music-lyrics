She's a dancer
And she's holdin' on
To dreams of fame
No loser
But in her mind
It's coming apart
It's felony to me
To give it up - she's gonna lose it
Been holding back on love
Pretending there's no way to turn
She's a prisoner
Got a lot to fight for - prisoner
Prisoner - prisoner of fame
Got a lot to fight for - prisoner
She's a dreamer
And I imagine her
That she'll be mine
Chasing a dream
The lights they call
Got no love anymore
'Cause she gave it all
It's insanity to me
To give it up - she's gonna lose it
Back holding back on love
Pretending there's no way to turn
She's a prisoner
Got a lot to fight for - prisoner
Prisoner - prisoner of fame
She's a prisoner
Ooh yeah - prisoner
Prisoner - prisoner of fame
Can't you see what' going on
It's mystic magic
Dancing on air
Some call it tragic
She's fading - fading away again
