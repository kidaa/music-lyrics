Amphetamines and jellybeans
She was pretty in her teens
Waiting for the month of come what May
I smelled you on my shirt today
Of course the hardest part is letting go
But you've got to or you know
You'll end up waiting by the

Phone me once in a while
Let me know you're alright
Tell you again that I'm fine
Then we go about our separate lives

Was it nasty scheme or lazy dreams
I left you cold two blankets deep
This is the last song I'll send your way
I smelled you on my shirt today
Of course the hardest part is letting go
But you've got to or you know
You'll end up waiting by the

Phone me once in a while
Let me know you're alright
Tell you again that I'm fine
Then we go about our separate lives

Phone me tell me that you're waiting
By the phone for me to phone you
Once in a while
Then we go about our separate lives

Phone me once in a while
Let me know you're alright
Tell you again that I'm fine
Then we go about our separate lives
