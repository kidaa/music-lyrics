Gonna get in the car with a smile and the burn that I put on my arm the day you 
went away girl and I probably wont come back around again.
repeat
Gonna drive all night through the red lights flying, over the hill to the 
county line blind, forgetting to forget that you're not mine.

Chorus 1
Kiss your Appocolyps for the last, last time runaway runaway runaway 
I can't find anytime you think it changed your mind, 

Chorus 2
Anytime you want jump back too me anytime, jump back to me anytime, 
jump back to me anytime, come back one more time anytime.

There's a place where I go to take the edge of the day, when the radios up your 
face fades away, flicker flicker dim and fade to black.
With a back pack packed, with a mug and a map. Gonna drive too fast, Gonna not 
look back, light the night with a blow torch and a match.
Chorus 1+2
Got no time reason or rime, not gonna stop, gonna ride all night
repeat three times
Chorus 2without you want
Chorus 1twice
For the last time 4 times
