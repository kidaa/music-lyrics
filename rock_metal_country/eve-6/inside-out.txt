I would swallow my pride I would choke on the
rhines. But the lack thereof would leave me
empty inside I would swallow my doubt turn it
inside out find nothing but faith in nothing.
Want to put my tender heart it in a blender. 
Watch it spin round to a beautiful oblivion.
Rendezvous then I'm through with you I burn 
burn like awicker cabinet chalk white and oh so 
frail I see out time has gotten stale. The tick 
tock of the clock is painful. All sane and logical 
I want to tear it off the wall I hear words and clips 
and phrases I think sick like ginger ale. My stomach
turns and I exhale. So Cal is where my mind
states but it's not my state of mind I'm not as
ugly sad as you. Or am I origami folded up and
just pretend demented as the motives in your
head I alone am the one you don't know you
need me take heed feed your ego. Make me blind
when your eyes close sink when you get close
tie me to the bedpost.
