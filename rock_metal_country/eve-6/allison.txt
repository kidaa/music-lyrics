From a distant start to this here bar
The me, the you, where are we now
Horray the blues of everyone
Allison
Keeps a smile around a while
He took no fright and jettisoned
We'll go tonight to hear him tell
Oh, well
Al-li-son
Al-li-son
And when the planet hit the sun
I saw the face of Allison
Al-li-son
Al-li-son
Al-li-son
