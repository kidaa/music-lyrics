One thousand faces all look the same
They're all so boring mild and tame
Contaminate him knock off his glasses
Teach him to tamper with the cloning
process Pardon me sir can I ask you a
favor Make me a cowboy like my next
door neighbor Pardon me sir can I use
your eraser To remove my brain of
unconventional nature Take my tongue
It's cocked and loaded The board has
dubbed you special student Sit alone sweat
in silence We don't tolerate defiance One
thousand paces lead to the gate They're
all so boring mild sedate You hear me
say this don't make any sense As I hop
up and over the fence Hooked on nico-
tine and phonics Fun like macro eco-
nomics Still and quiet like they taught us
Fun like macro economics Vigilante
thoughts and a cheap guitar I am my own
movie star I don't know you I don't want
to I don't know you I don't want to
