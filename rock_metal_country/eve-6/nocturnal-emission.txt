Well I'm lying in bed sweating staring at the ceiling, in my brain I have painted a beautiful picture of you, I'm not even going to try to fall asleep tonight, I don't want to lost the picture in my mind, in my mind.

[ Chorus ]
Then I close my eyes and quickly drift away  
magically transported to another time and place  
hold away  
magically transported to another time and place  
hold you in my arms and we go whirling through the air  
going all four directions, heading straight for nowhere 
I wake up in cold sweat come to grips with reality  
take a deep breath lay back down wearing my badge of infamy  
when the bulb in my nightlight flickers, flickers, flickers and dies, I'm left alone, staring at my ceiling once again 

[ Chorus ] 

It's my nocturnal emission
