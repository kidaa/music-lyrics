Sunset Strip bitch
He reads women's magazines, swears the truth doesn't phase him
He knows the hottest bras for fall and how to make her fall in love
In four or five days or less, guess it depends on the stars
And how well he has memorized his dating dos and don'ts he says

I'm ready to go
Gonna see my name underneath the stars when I walk the Boulevard
The horoscope today said things would go my way
Sunset Strip bitch

He wines and dines and takes his time between regurgitating lines
Voted most likely to work in the rag he stole from work
Tres Flores in his hair, Old Spice lingers in the air
Gives an extra squirt of shine for sheen and smiles as he says

I'm ready to go
Gonna see my name underneath the stars when I walk the Boulevard
The horoscope today said things would go my way
Sunset Strip bitch

He knows his friends think that he's lame when he tells them he's got game
Shops around for shiny clothes, strikes a super player pose
He reads women's magazines, he slaves to make the scene
Gets the wax ripped off his back, he screams and smiles and he says

I'm ready to go 
Gonna see my name underneath the stars when I walk the Boulevard
This outfit set me back two paychecks and a Cadillac
The horroscope today said things would go my way
