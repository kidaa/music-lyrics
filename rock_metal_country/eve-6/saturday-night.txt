Saturday night burns a redness on my face I tasted you
you tasted my you were never my taste Now you're left
alone with precious thoughts Of half asses half an hour
stops And talk so small I can't remember ever saying a
word Laced with thick naivete Firm delusions can't be
swayed Tell yourself you're happy We both know the
truth It's false behind the dirty talk the dirty sheets the
sexy walk your eyes are closed your heart is open wide
and that's no good There is something up my sleeve
There is nothing in-between You and me that you can't
see So beg my pardon Honesty's a virtue that can hurt
you let it be The thought that counts is counting down
the minutes 'till I leave and when I do you'll be looking
for security in words Though you know that you won't
get it for the better for the worse I apologize for me
Then I'm back in a couple of weeks I'm too weak to help it
Don't know how to end it I apologize for me
