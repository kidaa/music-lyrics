Sitting up once again...In my bedroom
Shaking hand holds ugly head...In my bedroom
Wish I may wish I might...In my bedroom
Have this wish I wish tonight...In my bedroom

[Chorus:]
At night when you turn out the light, think of me, smile and feel all right
And when you lay your head down to sleep, may I be the one who fills your dreams...
Are you lying wide awake...In your bedroom
Are you trying to fall asleep...In your bedroom
Cuz your not thinking about me...In your bedroom
If you were you'd wish those thoughts would leave you...In your bedroom

[Chorus:]
At night when you turn out the light, you wonder what it was you thought you liked.
And you ask yourself what did you see, In an idle hollow fool like me
I'm not the one who fills my dreams.......
