Drag this neurotic to hysterics. Leave him balked
and unfulfilled holding inside outwardly patient
'till the time he'll call it. Alluring exotic 
twisted hero leaving him more lonely.
Still he waits around he's spun around and
left without the power to stop it. Peers don't
know what they can't see. They can't see inside
of me. It's sickening how comforting the privacy
of the mind can be. How much longer will I try
before I realize I'm desperate in the situation
that I'm in again I'm exhausting yet another topic
I've exhausted frequently with no regrets. Abstruse
and lacking rational but making so much sense somehow
a stone has blocked my hourglass no progress made no
time's run out I'd almost rather have the latter
Save myself with sad defeat A stone just broke my 
hourglass I peel the skin that had me trapped.
