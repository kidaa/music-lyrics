If you're doing it for yourself
And you don't care what they think
I can understand having a little fun
It really makes no difference to me

Now you're taking it too far
Why can't you see
That being strung out for two weeks just to
be with them
is being someone you never wanted to be

[Chorus]
I don't care
that you turned your back on me
I do care that your turned your back on you
turned your back on me

Yeah you're doing it for yourself
And you don't care what they think
Cause you're searching for something
That you will never find
Something you'll never reach

[Chorus]

Guess whose making it too far
Why can't you see
That being strung out for two weeks
Just to be with them is being
Someone you never wanted to be......
