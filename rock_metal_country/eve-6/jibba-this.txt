We're slaves to saving time, as if we didn't have enough 
We're slaves to the hormone, we're men and must be tough  
We're slaves to the dollar, and the happiness that it brings 
tradition rules from the start generations running round in rings 

[ Chorus ]
I want out I want to escape the human role 
They teach us we're fulfilled, when we've done what we're told  
Now I feel an emptiness whenever I act out on my own  
Now i'm going to break these binds, and get my life back on track  
fulfill the expectations with others behind, and fulfill my life with what you call crap

[Chorus ]
