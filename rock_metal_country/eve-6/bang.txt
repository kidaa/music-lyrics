The underworld element beckoned in a dream to
Find a sidekick pronto I should 
Think Thelma not Daria
So I search hard and near and far for 
Someone the description called for
Thought seldom not Daria
Found her in a suburban wasteland 
Swaddling clothed and caked in beach sand
At first sight thought that I might turn and 
Run out of fear and intrigue
I stood numb kind of military 
I'd found her I'd keep her

Safe and sound
Don't make a sound
Look up at the sky shit's going down
I heard a bang and stars collided
Her skin drew me in just like a magnet
Little girl my little world is yours

I took a one way highway headed West heaven bound
Never even thought once to turn round
Real life plays tricks on the brain
Pointed fingers were left in the dust and The ones who doubted rusted
We're out of here like Vladimir
Now I'm looking at a picture where I'm right beside you
Eyes shine with a light that binds you
To this fool with Super Glue
From all the way across the nation
You came with just your name and 
Your suitcase I'll keep you

Safe and sound
Don't make a sound
Look up at the sky shit's going down
I heard a bang and stars collided
Her skin drew me in just like a magnet
Little girl my little world is yours

Big bang little girl run away with me
And be my Thelma & Louise
Brush that sand off your ask
Your questions later love me long time
