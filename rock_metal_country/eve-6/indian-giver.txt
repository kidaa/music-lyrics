[Chorus]

You relieve me
You give me
Then you take it
away from my
memory.......

How much more
empty can I feel
Then this feel-
ing of false hap-
piness, so real
You make me
laugh at
My own
stupidity
And when
you're with me
My world's seen
differently

Restore energy
when strength
is gone
And numb me
up when the
pain's too
strong
Stress of life it
last too long
you remove my
strains
And reality
is gone......
[Chorus]
