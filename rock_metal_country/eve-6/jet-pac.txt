You're the one stepping on the back of my shoes
You're the one using me as a muse
You're the one with the jet pack strapped to your back ready to go

It's you and her and nobody else the lights are low and she's so ready 
You're already on your way to the door
You're at the bar the tender gives you a free drink and winks, she's perfect 
You sweat bullets, spill the drink and you leave 
Everyone leaves the party except a gorgeous twenty something, you turn and run
You call me up

You're the one stepping on the back of my shoes
You're the one using me as a muse
You're the one with the jet pack strapped to your back ready to go

So the way you act, is it just an act or some strange courtship ritual
A habitual nervous reaction
Hey it's just me, set yourself free, why don't you let me know what's going on
Inside your cluttered head 

You're the one stepping on the back of my shoes
You're the one using me as a muse
You're the one with the jet pack strapped to your back ready to go

What the hell are you talking about is that what you would say 
If I were to wonder out loud would it make you turn away
Just a curious question

If it was you and me and nobody else would you want me to want to be ready to go
Would you want to take the lights down low

You're the one stepping on the back of my shoes
You're the one using me as a muse
You're the one with the jet pack strapped to your back ready to go

Hey it's just me, set yourself free, why don't you let me know what's going on
Hey it's just me, set yourself free
