It said "Fok Karina" on the wall we were leaning
I get a feeling and she starts to grin
Adjusted my pants as my face turns to red
Foresight is so often blind

Just take the 2 to the 134
But first take the elevator to my floor
It's good to be bad if it's better than bored
Foresight is so often blind
Slur to a favorite rhyme

Girl eyes tend to hypnotize
The trance is so divine
Decide to be the reason why
I stay another night

Vodkareening through the hotel door
Guilty is really a choice and a chore
It's good to be bad if it's better than bored
Foresight is so often blind
Slur to a favorite rhyme and that's when

Girl eyes tend to hypnotize
The trance is so divine
Decide to be the reason why
I stay another night

I took her hand and then an aspirin in the morning
I took her hand and took her home

It said "Fok Karina" on the wall we were leaning on
Afraid of a common phenomenon again

Girl eyes tend to hypnotize
The trance is so divine
Decide to be the reason why
I stay another night
