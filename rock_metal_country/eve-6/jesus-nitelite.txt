Your eyes shine bright like a Jesus nitelite I'd like to
touch your positive vibes Indifferent eyes won't give me
the time May I help put aside your moral fiber You're
dressed in white my face is white I'd like to be a colorful
sight to see I'm only here in a background Here on the
ground lays my head I sleep and then I wake make
sounds and go to bed and wake again The time is right
but I feel all wrong It wastes away until it's gone The
time is right but I feel all wrong It fades away and now
you're gone You're walking by I'm standing by Behind
the light I'm standing by By and by
