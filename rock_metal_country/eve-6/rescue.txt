I rode a western wind with a girl over to her mother's
In the backyard stars shone brighter than the others
That I rarely see through the smog through the haze that covers
The home that I used to live in
Well I kind of sort of knew what was going to happen
When she put her number down on a restaurant napkin
She said goodbye I think the words were when you're back in
Town let's have each other again I'll come around and see you again

Like Jessica Rabbit she collects bad habits gets her drinks for free
Animated vixen stole Cupid's arrow and came to rescue me
In the blink of an eyelid my lid opened up and I could see
That she'd come to rescue me

I tasted southern sin with a girl who was just perfection
Had a two room condo back in a wealthy section
Of the Florida flatlands where she had me kept in
A wicked trance for a day
Well I kind of sort of knew what was going to happen
When she and a friend came and met me in Atlanta
I professed my love in an animalistic manner
Like an endless foreign flick my subtitles were sick

Like Jessica Rabbit she collects bad habits gets her drinks for free
Animated vixen stole Cupid's arrow and came to rescue me
In the blink of an eyelid my lid opened up and I could see
That she'd come to rescue me

Well I kind of sort of saw the sirens coming
She was running toward me wearing almost nothing
And my heart beat skipped when she bent down at the hip
And her lips pressed against mine

Like Jessica Rabbit she collects bad habits gets her drinks for free
Animated vixen stole Cupid's arrow and came to rescue me
In the blink of an eyelid my lid opened up and I could see
That she'd come to rescue me

Here she comes to rescue me
I'm not gonna blink cause I wanna see
I wanna see her come
Here she comes
