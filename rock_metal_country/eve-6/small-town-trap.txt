Suffocate from lack of stimulation Television
time Gonna break with every bead of sweat My
heart rate seems to climb My friend and I stick to
the tired couches Please pass the time I found a
dime under the corner cushion Wishing it was
some place else and so do I Small town trap with
dreams of breaking out Satan's in the living room
choking me with apathy Small town trap with
dreams of breaking out Inspire me cause if you
don't I think I'll dissipate to dust the Liar in me
says something's gonna happen soon because it
must My friend and I stick to the tired couches
Please pass the time I found a dime under the cor-
ner cushion Wishing it was someplace else and
so do I Community immunity is the shot I crave
A sleepless sleep slow motion dream wanna dig
my grave Time ticks away on the longest day
Wanna break away on the longest day
