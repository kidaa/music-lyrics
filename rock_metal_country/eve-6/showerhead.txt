Cheap shot hocked straight to the ear drum Is it
some sick sign of affection Violated and singed
with deceit Disgust from my head to my hands
to my feet Your face it gives foul taste
Whether smiling crying or denying I see your
motives and you're charged with fraud by me So
take the hint and leave I loved you while he was
in you in the shower Did in joy and ecstasy
your eyes begin to water And if I may stop by
when you're living in the next town ten years
down the road A good time for a dime and a
crushed cigarette making bets with your body on
the avenue Look into my eyes you say and you'll
see nothing but sincerity Almost as if you've got
some hope that you'll enlighten me You're a head
case story Just trust me you said
