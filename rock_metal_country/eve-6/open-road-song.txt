Tonight I feel ambitious and so does my foot as it sinks on the pedal I press it to the floor 
I don't need a girl don't need a friend my friend lonesome's unconditional 
We're flying forever bored 
And for a moment I love everything I see and think and feel I love my broken side view mirror 
Cause it's so perfect I'm so perfect you're so perfect you're not here I hear the change in gears 
My pile shakes as I hit eighty on the open road 
This is an open road song 
The night is beckoning although I have nowhere to go but home 
Feels good to be alone
With every turn comes a new frame of mind if I could frame my mind where would it hang 
I crack a window and feel the cool air cleanse my every pore as I pour my poor heart out 
To a radio song that's patient and willing 
My volume drowns it out 
But that's O.K. cause I sound better than him anyway any day yeah my voice is sweet as salt 
I search for comfort and I find it where I've found it many times before 
Times before can be forgotten
