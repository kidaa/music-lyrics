There's a face I know too well I see it every time I look in the mirror 
No I don't kiss and tell I'll tell you after I betrayed you 
Supersonic boy sweating sin 
The pillar that I'm melting on will prove you wrong 
Keep your lips sealed this just in 
You're speeding up the ticker of a walking time bomb 
Time's up stand up face the Muzac Smile wide step outside 
Click your sticks and cast spell that'll suck my saliva like water from a well 
I try to do what's right what's right ain't right enough for you tonight 
I see you're displeased a middle finger response 
I'll try to appease 
I'm sorry don't be mad but ask me what 
I'm sorry for and I won't have an answer 
Look me in the eye and let 'em flow again 
Lies on the rocks with a twist of desperation
