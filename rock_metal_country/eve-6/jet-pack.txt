You're the one stepping on the back of my shoes 
You're the one using me as a muse 
You're the one with the jet pack strapped to your back ready to go 

It's you are her and nobody else 
The lights are low and she's so ready 
You're already on your way to the door 
You're at the bar the tender gives you a free drink 
And when she's perfect you sweat bullets spill the drink and you leave 
Everyone leaves the party except a gorgeous 20-something 
You turn and run 
You call me up 

You're the one stepping on the back of my shoes 
You're the one using me as a muse 
You're the one with the jet pack strapped to your back ready to go 
Ready to go 

So, the way you act is it just an act to some strange courtship ritual? 
A habitual nervous reaction? 
Hey it's just me set yourself free 
Why don't you let me know what's going on 
inside your cluttered head? 

You're the one stepping on the back of my shoes 
You're the one using me as a muse 
You're the one with the jet pack strapped to your back ready to go 
Ready to go 

What the hell are you talking about? Is that what you would say? 
If I were to wonder outloud would it make you turn away? 
Just a curious question to think about. 

If it was you and me and nobody else would want me to want to be ready to go? 
Or would you want to take the lights down low? 

You're the one stepping on the back of my shoes 
You're the one using me as a muse 
You're the one with the jet pack strapped to your back ready to go 
Ready to go 

Hey it's just me set yourself free 
Why don't you let me know what's going on? 

Hey it's just me set yourself free 
Why don't you let me know what's going on? 

Hey it's just me set yourself free 
Why don't you let me know what's going on? 

Hey it's just me set yourself free
