I took a ride to meet an enemy
October light shown bright through the windshield
Right into my eyes where I was silent riding shotgun
Chewing on some sugar free gum
Parallel park and pay the meter
If I die before I leave tell her I'll never leave her
I am fine just a little broken up
OK my nerves have never been so shot

Can't get this shit off my mind
I just want to be alright
So just tell me nothing's wrong
Then get undressed and spend the night

The autumn sun burning logic in my brain
I'm asking why there is pleasure when there's pain
I'm here to pay for my mistakes in a humiliating manner
If there is a next time I'll cover up
I feel alone I feel shaky and uncertain
A kind man shakes my hand and draws the curtain
In a word he saves my life and then I exit out the enter door and smile

Can't get this shit off my mind
I just want to be alright
So just tell me nothing's wrong
Then get undressed and spend the night

I took a ride to meet an enemy
I faced a fear of mine and shivered but didn't blink
I took a ride to meet an enemy to end all the madness
And now I know that I'll be fine
I am fine

Can't get this shit off my mind
I just want to be alright
So just tell me nothing's wrong
Then get undressed and spend the night

Just want to be fine
