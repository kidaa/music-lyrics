Tell those stories to me I'm dying to hear the things you've done and seen 
Farfetched as they may be 
You strike a smile in me
 Your stories ring of perjury 
Construed with self empowering theme 
Suckin' on my brain your the teacher I'm the student 
Turning things around your story's not congruent 
Tabloid decoys pitiful excuses 
Turning things around You're turning things around 
A manic stunning scene I'm taking notes your taking me away into your false reality 
I know you comfort lies in lying to try to make your life make sense 
But you're not making sense I'd say it aloud but I'm not aloud I see your head spin round and round 
Broken record talk tonight skip that needle back and forth on your mind wearing out unconvincing lies 
Like a seedling dropped from an old oak tree your shade don't hide no sun from me 
Fake stories humor me It's graduation time I love you like a mother
