Blemishing mirror fright, gonna take a bit of a fall tonight
Dreamed that I was underneath a naked women saying something that I can't repeat
Awakened by the runway noise, suck it up kid, assume battle poise
It's a lonely time for yours truly I know
I don't need to stay awake

In my nightmare I feel so alive
In my dreamscape escapades 
I make the grade I save the day

Pull here push me there a little lower little closer to the spot that's bare
That's the toy that fills my void it's apparent I've inherited a demon joy
It's a lonely time for yours truly I know
I don't need to stay awake

In my nightmare I feel so alive
In my dreamscape escapades 
I make the grade I save the day
