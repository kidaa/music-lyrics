I turn away and shove my hands deep in my pockets  
I see her face my body aches and I start rotting  
I watch as he stares into eyes that gazed upon me  
Time ticks by I feel like dying and then she calls me 

[ Chorus ]
I think its great that we're so such good friends  
I'm so glad that we're such good friends 
Do you think of me when your being abused  
Thank God I wasn't used.  
Wait by the phone because she said that she would call me  
I know she won't but I still hope it will start ringing 
I'll try to find something to do to pass the time  
I lock my door, pace back and forth my teeth are grinding 

[ Repeat Chorus ]

When he makes you cry do you consider your best interests, 
When he gets high you know your pain is self inflicted 
I watch as he stares into eyes that gazed upon me 
Time ticks my I feel like dying and then she calls me
