Smith

Was many years ago that I left home and came this way
I was a young man , full of hopes and dreams
But now it seems to me that all is lost and nothing gained
Sometimes things ain't what they seem
No brave new world, no brave new world
No brave new world, no brave new world

Night and day I scan the horizon , sea and sky
My spirit wanders endlessly
Until the day will dawn and friends from home discover why
Here me calling , rescue me
Set me free, set me free
Lost in this place , and leave no trace

Chorus:
Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home

One hundred years have gone And men again they came that way
To find the answer to the mystery
They found his body lying where it fell on that day
Preserved in time for all to see
No brave new world , no brave new world
Lost in this place , to leave no trace

What became of the men that started
All are gone and their souls departed
Left me here in this place
So all alone

Chorus:
Stranger in a stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home
