 Harris 

The only place where you can dream
Living here is not what it seems
Ship of white light in the sky
Nobody there to reason why.

Here I am I'm not really there
Smiling faces ever so rare
Lets walk in deepest space
Living here just isn't the place.

REPEAT

Leaves of green grasses twine Girls drinking plasma wine
Look at love a dream unfolds
Living here you'll never grow old.

Stalks of light grow from the ground
When I cry there isn't a sound
All my feelings cannot be held
I'm happy in my new strange world
