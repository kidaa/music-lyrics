 Harris / Smith 

If you're feeling down depressed and lonely,
I know a place where we can go.
22 Acacia Avenue, meet a lady we all know.
So if you're looking for a good time,
And you're prepared to pay the price.
Fifteen quid is all she asks for,
Everybody's got their vice.

If you're waiting for a long time,
for the rest to do their piece.
You can tell her that you know me,
and you might even get it free.
So any time you're down the East End,
don't you hesitate to go,
You can take my honest word for it,
she'll teach you more than you can know.

Charlotte isn't it time you stopped all this mad life.
Don't you ever think about the bad times.
Why do you have to live this way.
Do you enjoy the lay or is it the pay.

Sometimes when you're strolling down the avenue,
The way you walk, it makes men think
of having you.
When you're walking down the street,
Everybody stops and turns to stare, at you.

22, the avenue, that's the place where we all go.
You will find it's warm inside,
the red light's burning bright tonight.
Beat her, mistreat her, do anything that you please.
Bite her, excite her, make her get down
on her knees.
Abuse her, misuse her, she can take all
that you've got.
Caress her, molest her, she always does
what you want.

You're running away, don't you know
what you're doing.
Can't you see it'll lead you to ruin.
Charlotte you've taken your life and
you've thrown it away.
You believe that because what you're earning,
Your life's good, don't you know that you're hurting,
All the people that love you, don't cast them aside.
All the men that are constantly drooling,
It's no life for you, stop all that screwing.
You're packing your bags and you're
coming with me.
