I time when dinosaurs walked the earth 
When the land was swamp adn caves where home 
In an age when prize possession was fire 
To search for landscapes men would roam 

Then the tribes they came to steel the fire 
And the wolves they howled into the night 
As they fought a viscious angry battle 
To save the power of warmth and light 

Drawn by quest for fire 
They searched all through the land 
Drawn by quest for fire 
Discovery of man 

And they thought that when the embers died away 
That the flame of life had burnt and died 
Didn't know the sparks that made the fire 
Were made by rubbing stick and stone 

So they ploughed through forest and swamps of danger 
And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts 
In the search to find another fire 
To regain the power of light and heat 

Drawn by quest for fire 
They searched across the land 
Drawn by quest for fire 
Discovery of man
