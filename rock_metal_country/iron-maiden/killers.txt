 Harris / DiAnno 

You walk through the subway,
His eyes burn a hole in your back.
A footstep behind you,
He lunges prepared for attack.

Scream for mercy,
He laughs as he's watching you bleed.
Killer behind you,
His blood lust defies all his needs.

My innocent victims
Are slaughtered with wrath and despise,
The mocking religion of hatred
That burns in the night.

I have no-one,
Am bound to destroy 
All this greed.
A voice inside me,
Compelling to satisfy me.

I can see,
What a life's meant to be.
You'll never know,
How I came to foresee.
