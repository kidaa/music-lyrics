 Harris 

Walking through the city
Looking oh so pretty
I've just got to find my way,

See the ladies flashing
All their legs and lashes
I've just got to find a way.

Well you see me crawling through
the bushes with it open wide
What you seeing girl
Can't you believe that feeling
Can't you believe it
Can't you believe your eyes
It's the real thing girl.

Got me feeling myself,
and reeling around
Got me talking, but feel like
walking around.

REPEAT
