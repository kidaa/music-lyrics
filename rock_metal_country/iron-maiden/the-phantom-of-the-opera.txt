 Harris 

I've been looking so long for you now,
You won't get away from my grasp
You've been living so long in hiding,
Hiding behind that false mask.

You know and I know that you ain't got
that long to last,
Your looks and your feelings are just the
remains of your past.

Standing in the wings there,
you wait for the curtain to fall
Knowing the terror and holding
you have on us all.

I know that you're going to scratch me
and maim me and maul
You know I'm helpless from your
mesmerising cat call.

CHORUS: Keep your distance,
walk away don't take his bait
Don't you stray, don't fade away.

Watch your step, he's out to get you
Come what may
Don't you stray, from the narrow way.

I'm running and hiding,
in my dreams you're always there
You're the Phantom of the Opera,
you're the devil you're just out to scare.

You damaged my mind and my soul
it just floats through the air
You haunt me, you taunt me, you torture me
back at your lair.
