Harris

If you had the time to lose
An open mind and time to choose
Would you care to take a look
Or can you read me like a book

Time is always on my side
Time is always on my side

Can I tempt you come with me
Be Devil may care fulfill your dream
If I said I'd take you there
Would you go would you be scared

Time is always on my side
Time is always on my side

Don't be afraid you're safe with me Safe as any soul can be.... Honestly
Just let yourself go
