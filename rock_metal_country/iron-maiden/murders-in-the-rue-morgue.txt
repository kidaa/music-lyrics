 Harris 

I remember it as plain as day,
Although it happened in the dark of night.
I was strolling through the streets of Paris,
It was cold, it was starting to rain.

And then I heard a piercing scream,
And I rushed to the scene of the crime.
But all I found was the butchered remains,
Of two girls laying side by side.

CHORUS

Murders in the Rue Morgue,
Someone call the gendarmes.
Murders in the Rue Morgue,
Vite before the killers go free.

There's some people coming down the street,
At last someone's heard my call.
I can't understand why they're pointing at me,
I never done nothing at all.

Well I must have got some blood on my hands,
Because everybody's shouting at me.
I can't speak French so I couldn't explain,
And like a fool, started running away.

CHORUS

Murders in the Rue Morgue,
Someone call the gendarmes.
Murder in the Rue Morgue,
Am I ever going to be free.

And now I've gotta get away from the arms of the law,
All of France is looking for me.
I've gotta find a way across the border for sure,
Down to the South of Italy.

CHORUS

Murders in the Rue Morgue,
Running from the gendarme.
Murders in the Rue Morgue,
I'm never going home.

Well I made it to the border at last
But I can't erase the scene from my mind,
Any time somebody stares at me,
Well I just start running blind.

Well I'm running through the shadows tonight
Away from the staring eyes.
Any day they'll be looking for me
'Cos I know I show the signs of...

Murders in the Rue Morgue,
Running from the gendarmes.
Murders in the Rue Morgue,
Running from the arms of the law.

Murders in the Rue Morgue,
Running from the gendarmes.
Murders in the Rue Morgue,
Am I ever gonna be free.

It took so long and I'm getting so tired,
I'm running out of places to hide.
Should I return to the scene of the crime
Where the two young victims died.

If I could go to somebody for help
To get me out of trouble for sure.
But I know that it's on my mind
That my doctor said I've done it before.

Murders in the Rue Morgue,
They're never gonna find me.
Murders in the Rue Morgue,
I'm never going home.
