Another Prophet of Disaster 
Who says the ship is lost 
Another Prophet of Disaster 
Leaving you to count the cost 
Taunting us with visions 
Afflicting us with fear 
Predicting war for millions 
In the hope that one appears 

No point asking when it is 
No point asking who's to go 
No point asking what's the game 
No point asking who's to blame 
'Cos if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die 
'Cos if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die 

If you're gonna die, die with your boots on 
If you're gonna try, just stick around 
Gonna cry, just move along 
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die 

In 13 the Beast is rising 
The Frenchman did surmise 
Through earthquakes and starvation 
The warlord will arise 
Terror, death, destruction 
Pour from the eastern sands 
But the truth of all predictions 
Is always in your hands 

If you're gonna die, die with your boots on 
If you're gonna try, just stick around 
Gonna cry, just move along 
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die
