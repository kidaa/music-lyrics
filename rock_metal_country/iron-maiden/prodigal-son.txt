 Harris 

Listen to me lamia, listen to what
I've got to say,
I've got these feelings and they
Won't go away.
I've got these fears inside that'll
Bring me to my knees,
Oh help me lamia, or I'm sure
I'll die oh please.

I feel unsettled now I know that
I've done wrong.
I've messed around with mystic things
And magic for far too long.
I feel I'm being paid with this
Nightmare inside me.
The devil's got a hold on my soul,
And he just won't let it be.

I'm on my knees,
Oh help me please.
I'm on my knees,
Help me please.

CHORUS

Oh lamia please try to help me.
The devil's got a hold of my soul,
And he won't let me be.
Lamia I've got this curse,
I'm turning to bad.
The devil's got hold of my soul,
And it's driving me mad.

Repeat.
