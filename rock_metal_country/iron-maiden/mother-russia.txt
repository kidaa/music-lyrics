Mother Russia, how are you sleeping?
Middle Winter, the cold winds blow.
From the trees, the snowflakes drifting.
Twirling 'round, like ghosts in the snow.

Mother Russia, poetry majestic.
Tells the time of a great empire.
Turn around and all my partners,
Are reminiscing an age gone by.

Mother Russia, dance of the tsars.
Hold up your hands, be proud of what you are.
Now it has come, freedom at last.
Turn your entire history, that's your past.

Mother Russia, dance of the tsars.
Hold up your hands, remember who you are.
Can you release, the anger of grief?
Can you be happy now your people are free.
