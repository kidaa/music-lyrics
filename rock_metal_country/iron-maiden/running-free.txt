 Harris / Di'anno 

Just sixteen a pickup truck
Out of money out of luck
I've got no place to call my own
Hit the gas and here I go

CHORUS:
I'm Running Free yeh, I'm Running Free
I'm Running Free yeh, I'm Running Free

Spend the night in an L.A. jail
Listen to the sirens wail
But they ain't got a thing on me
I'm running wild I'm Running Free

CHORUS:
I'm Running Free yeh, I'm Running Free
I'm Running Free yeh, I'm Running Free

Pulled her at the Bottle Top
Whiskey dancing disco hop
And all the boys are after me
And that's the way it's gonna be.

CHORUS:
I'm Running Free yeh, I'm Running Free
I'm Running Free yeh, I'm Running Free
