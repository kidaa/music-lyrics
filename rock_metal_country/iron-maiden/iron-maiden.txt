 Harris 

Won't you come into my room,
I want to show you all my wares,
I just want to see your blood,
I just want to stand and stare.

See the blood begin to flow,
As it falls upon the floor,
Iron Maiden can't be fought,
Iron Maiden can't be sought.

CHORUS: Oh well, wherever,
wherever you are,
Iron Maiden's
gonna get you,
No matter how far,
See the blood flow,
Watching it shed,
Up above my head, Iron Maiden wants
you for dead.
