I was sick of restrictions sick of the boundaries about to close the door
Such a lack of conviction no real connection what should I settle for
But you caught my attention you built on the tension and you left me wanting more
Now I don't know what to do with myself do with myself I don't want nobody else

[bridge]
I let you in I let you in and you infected me
Can't get enough of you 
Can't get enough of you
I breathed you in I breathed you in and now I'm in too deep
Don't think I'm pulling through
Don't think I'm pulling through
Can't get enough of you
Can't get enough of you

[chorus]
You're so contagious Running through my veins
you're so contagious Hangin onto every word
You're so contagious And I can't get away
You're so contagious and now I know for sure there is no cure

I saw your intentions i gave you permission Go ahead and start the war
I was out of addictions by my own admission oh I've been keeping score
but you made an exception you taught me a lesson Who cares where I've been before
You would never leave me all by myself, all by myself you don't want nobody else

[bridge]

[chorus]

I am burning in your fire there is no cure
I have only one desire there is no cure
I can not deny her
Now I don't know what to do with myself, do with myself there is no cure
Now I don't know what to do with myself, do with myself I don't want nobody else

[bridge]

[chorus]

You keep running, you keep running, you keep running through my veins [x4]
You're so contagious, there is no cure, you're so contagious
