Are you having trouble keeping up Seeing this thing through
I want to know who you're running from Me or you
You're too confused to open up Feel the way I do
I want to know who you're thinking of cause I really have no clue

[bridge]
Another game of charades
Don't you know everybody plays
I don't want to lose to you that way
Maybe we'll be different this time around
Maybe we'll be different I don't know
Don't want to strangle this, so I'm holding back for now

[chorus]
Calm down don't take it too far
I know only time can heal scars
So I'm ready when you are When you are
I'm ready when you are
Tied down Don't want any false starts
I can do without the time apart
So I'm ready when you are When you are
I'm ready when you are

Are you having trouble keeping up You know that I will wait
I wonder if it's good enough To make you stay
You're too confused to open up You don't know what to say
Well you can tell me if you think it's love I won't be far away

[bridge]

[chorus]

I want to know if you're thinking of me
I'll be counting the hours even though I know I'm free
Too soon to take a chance No more questions left to ask
I could be anything, but the one thing I'm not sure you want to be

Calm down don't take it too far
I know only time can heal scars
I'm ready when you are When you are
I'm ready when you are
Don't want any false starts
I can do without the time apart
I'm ready when you are When you are
I'm ready when you are

Calm down don't take it too far
I know only time can heal scars
So I'm ready when you are When you are
I'm ready when you are
Calm down Don't want any false starts
I can do without the time apart
So I'm ready when you are When you are
I'm ready when you are

Calm down, I'm ready when you are [x4]
