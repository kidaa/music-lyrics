Everybody turn your cameras on 
look who's on the run, the night is young and this time its more than just for fun

let me know, let me know how far you take it
let me know, let me know I'll watch you break it

[bridge]
Don't you know you're diggin too deep, too deep
tonight there's a little to much for you to hide
when you've had enough to fill the emptyness inside
Don't you know you're diggin too deep, too deep
tonight there's a little to much for you to hide you're fallin into every lie just say goodbye

[chorus]
Curiousity kills what you don't know won't hurt you, what you don't know won't break out so
why do you start
Curiousity kills what you don't know wont burn you, what you don't know won't make it smart

We've reached the end, so I pretend were on again when you know you've found another friend

let me know, let me know how far you take it
let me know, let me know I'll watch you break it

I just can't leave it alone nothing ever stays the same what can I say the seasons change and
I know you must be on your way

let me know, let me know how far you take it
let me know, let me know I'll watch you break it

[bridge]

[chorus]

Somebody pull the world over my eyes
ignorance is bliss I only wish that I'd been blind the evidence was left for me to find
oh I want to let it go I want my peace of mind
they say to me that you should let it die you dont have to know the truth you dont have to
waste your time

[bridge]

[chorus]

Curiousity kills [x3]
