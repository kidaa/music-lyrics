Circling your head contemplating everything you ever said
Now I see the truth I got a doubt
A different motive in your eyes and now I'm out
See you later
I see your fantasy you want to make a reality paved in gold
See inside, inside of our heads
Well that's over
I see your motives inside and decision to hide

[Chorus]
Back off we'll take you on
Headstrong to take on anyone
I know that you are wrong
Headstrong we're Headstrong
Back off We'll take you on
Headstrong to take on anyone
I know that you are wrong
This is not where you belong

I can't give anything away
I won't give everything away

Conclusions manifest your first impressions got to be your very best
I see you're full of shit and that's alright
That's how you play I guess you get through every night
Now that's over
I see your fantasy you want to make it a reality paved in gold
See inside, inside of our heads
Well that's all over
I see your motives inside and decision to hide

[Chorus]

I can't give anything away
I won't give everything away

I know I know all about
I know I know all about
I know I know all about
I know I know all about your motives inside and decision to hide

[Chorus]
