Let's pretend
we're far away
Away from problems
found each day
Silent drift,
echoes fade
Raining softly,
then delay

Will I fall?
If I make a mistake,
Can I make an escape
With you?

[Chorus]
My confidence is draining
My happiness is raining down on me
My ego is craving
Without you,
I'm falling
A step in the door,
Can you hear me calling?
Darling forgive me
Darling, darling, forgive
Will you break me out?
Set me free
Will you take my soul
away from me?
Will you break me out?
Set me free
Will you take my soul
away from me?

Am I lost?
If I stray out too far,
Would you bring me back in
With you?

[Chorus]

Help, I need you
to swallow me up
Help, I need you
to swallow me up

Look inside
To wipe away the rain
Go break me out
And take away the pain
But if you find it in your heart
I'll make you see
If you wanna break me out
And set me free...
