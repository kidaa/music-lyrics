This attraction
Only to appearance
Becoming your religion
Looks are every thing
The only thing
That means something to you

Satisfaction,
Only on the surface
Your eyes are always focused
Go on and let it show
That there is no
Exception to the rule

So fill the empty space!
With another pretty face

[chorus]
Skin Deep
Skin Deep
No one will ever be perfect in your eyes
Skin Deep
Skin Deep
Only scratching the surface for your prize

First impressions
Are over in an instant
You make your decision
Before you speak a word
You end your search
The page already turned

Every conquest
Filled with disappointments
Lacking any substance
Now your out of words
The lines are blurred
Your never gonna learn

So fill the empty space!
With another pretty face

[chorus]
Skin Deep
Skin Deep
No one will ever be perfect in your eyes
Skin Deep
Skin Deep
Only scratching the surface for your prize

Skin Deep
Skin Deep
No one will ever be perfect in your eyes
Skin Deep
Skin Deep
Only scratching the surface for your prize

[chorus]
Skin Deep
Skin Deep
No one will ever be perfect in your eyes
Skin Deep
Skin Deep
Only scratching the surface for your prize

Skin Deep
Skin Deep
No one will ever be perfect in your eyes
Skin Deep
Skin Deep
Only scratching
Only scratching
The surface for your prize
