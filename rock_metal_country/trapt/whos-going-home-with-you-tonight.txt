Don't think we ever really got it right
Both you and I have always kept it bottled up inside
Can you show me what it feels like to give yourself away
Why can't I hold onto you

[bridge]
There is no one around who picks me up when I'm down like you do
and when you can't hear a sound will the silence drown you too

[chorus]
Who's going home with you tonight
was it real or am I part of your collection
have you crossed the line
Who's going home with you tonight
Oh I feel like you're an open invitation
Is this how we say goodbye

Keeping secrets somewhere down below
I wish you had the heart to tell me that you sold your soul
So many things you couldn't let me know
You had to run away
Why can't I hold onto you

[bridge]

[chorus]

Who's going home with you tonight
Who's going home with you tonight
can you tell me what it wrong and what is right
Who's going home with you tonight

Why can't I hold onto you [x3]

It's getting harder to sit here alone
I've been waiting I've been waiting and you still ain't home
I have never ever felt so low
I've been thinking I've been thinking Oh where did you go

[chorus]

Who's going home with you tonight
Who's going home with you tonight
can you tell me what it wrong and what is right
Who's going home with you tonight
