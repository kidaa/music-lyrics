I don't know anything at all and I'm somebody else
It could take years to find you, it could years to find myself
And I don't need to hear your answer I just need you to see
That I think it's time to break down these walls that we throw

Am I still breathing have I lost that feeling
Am I made of glass 'cause you see right through me
I don't know who I am and you're the only one who sees that
I can't ask these questions that cannot be answered today
And even if everything goes wrong and we start to fall apart
I will understand where you are, I will understand this by myself
And I don't need to hear your answer I just need you to feel
Like there are no boundaries at all

And how far have we come, too far to throw away the past
Will you be there waiting for me
I have to ask what we are, if I ask today it just won't last
So I'll be here waiting for you

Will we ever feel this good again - Not today

Will we ever feel this real
again - Not today

Will you ever be mine again - Not today

Will we ever feel this real again - Not today
