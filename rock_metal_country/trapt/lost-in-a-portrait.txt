I analyze everything, I know what you mean
I answer by questioning all that I need
And I want to, to surrender
I want you to see all the sides
All the faces inside of me

I see I'm not perfect, but that's all I see
Lost in a portrait, in a picture of me
This can't be everything I see
That my canvas is incomplete
Your color's everything to me
And my canvas will set me free

My outline is solid and made up of crime 
And the things that you say just burn in my eyes
I want to, to surrender 
I want you to find some comfort 
In the spaces between the lines

I see I'm not perfect, but that's all I see
Lost in a portrait, in a picture of me
This can't be everything I see
That my canvas is incomplete
Your color's everything to me
And my canvas will set me free
This can't be everything I see
That my canvas is incomplete
Your color's everything to me

This can't be everything I see
That my canvas is incomplete
You color's everything to me
And my canvas will set me free
This can't be everything I see
That my canvas is incomplete
Your color's everything to me
You're everything to me
