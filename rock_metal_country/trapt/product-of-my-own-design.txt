I've opened up my eyes, so tell me what I see
I've opened up my mind, so tell me how to think
Use your big words and show me how to speak
You can't live your life through me
I can't believe you think it's that easy

[chorus]
Your walls of pride are only fencing you in
Your ego's been playing games with your head
You're not the mastermind
I am a product of my own design

Following you and your promised guarentees
Free to choose as long as I live your dreams
You say my own weight could never be carried
I'll agree to disagree, I can't believe that you are that naive

You were my eyes
You were my ears
You were my conscience all these years

No more
My vision has never been so clear
Looks like i have no one left to fear
