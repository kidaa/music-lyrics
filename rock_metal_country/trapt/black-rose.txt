I saw you in the garden I wanted you so much
I really thought that you were different Oh I couldn't get enough
I tried to save you from yourself I felt every high and low
now the lows have drowned the highs away now there's no where else to go

[bridge]
Black rose your thorns are cutting into me for the last time
Black rose I saw your petals wilt away I couldn't bring you back to life

[chorus]
You were always where the sun could never go
I never wanted you to have to be alone
But I couldn't find a way to help you grow
Black Rose

You never tell me how you feel and your moods they always change
I really tried to make it real but you never had the faith
I tried to give you something good to take the pain away
I tried to make you understand You don't have to be this way

[bridge]

[chorus]

I'm not the one who hurt you So why are you so scared
I couldn't save you You are who you are
All that you've been put through couldn't be repaired
I couldn't break through we're too far apart
I'm not the one who hurt I'm the only one who cares
I couldn't save you You are who you are
You'll need someone to turn to And I will not be there
I couldn't save you

Everytime I held you I knew that it would hurt
Only through the pain I could find a way to learn

[bridge]

So wilt away couldn't bring you back to life

[chorus]

I'm not the one who hurt you So why are you so scared
I couldn't save you You are who you are
All that you've been put through couldn't be repaired
I couldn't break through we're too far apart
I'm not the one who hurt I'm the only one who cares
I couldn't save you You are who you are
You'll need someone to turn to And I will not be there
I couldn't save you
