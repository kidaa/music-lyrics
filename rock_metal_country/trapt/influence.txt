Liquid courage
Pouring down
Sober surface
Hits the ground

The masquerade has
Started now
And you have faded
Into the crowd

How do you know?
How do you know just who your friends are?
How do you know when you've gone too far
To get high again?

[chorus]
You always feel so alone
The real you is never shown
Who's influence?, Who's influence
Are you under??
Now
So much pressure to fit in
You never know when to begin
Who's influence?, Who's influence
Are you under??
Now

Liquid courage
Pouring down
Sober surface
Can't be found

There's no denial
You can't drown
When nothings final
So turn around

How do you know?
How do you know just who your friends are?
How do you know when you've gone too far
To get high again?

[chorus]
You always feel so alone
The real you is never shown
Who's influence?, Who's influence
Are you under??
Now
So much pressure to fit in
You never know when to begin
Who's influence?, Who's influence
Are you under??
Now

I want this, I want this

I want this I want this
Do I want this? Do i want this?
I want this I want this
Do I want this?!

How do you know?
How do you know just who your friends are?
How do you know when you've gone too far?

[chorus]
You always feel so alone
The real you is never shown
Who's influence?, Who's influence
Are you under??
Now
So much pressure to fit in
You never know when to begin
Who's influence?, Who's influence
Are you under??.........
Now

Who's influence?
Who's influence?
Who's influence are you under??......
Now
