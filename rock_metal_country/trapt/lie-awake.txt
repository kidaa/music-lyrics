If it's not this one won't find another
Cause it's overcoming reason and
Taking me under
It's controlling all of me
Maybe inside I found what I wanted maybe
Just this once I found something greater
Than my life you let me see that light
Lie Awake inside my fears
I'll let you know they'll disappear
Find a way to crawl inside
I want let you know that I want you
The feeling that I get now when I'm around her
Isn't anything that I've f elt before
It's something I can't ignore
Maybe inside I found what I wanted
Maybe just this once I found something
Greater than my life you let me see the light
I'll folow you out into fantasy,
But let me know where we're coming back
I think it's time to let our bodies go
I'll bring it right back to you
Fantasy reality is gone
I don't know where we are now
Lie awake inside my fears they're gone
You took them right back with you
Find a way to crawl inside to find
A way to tell you that I love you
