You don't ever ask me why
you don't read the signs
you give me way too many reasons
for me to wanna get high

Standing tall between my four walls
and I'm about to fall
so look into me eyes and i say it all

[bridge]
I am lost, I am lost
so crucify me on your cross
whats the cost, whats the cost
to erase what I've been taught
Get off my back dont attack
So what if I fell off the tracks
your master plan, don't understand

[chorus]
I'd rather live in my own Wasteland
I'm already gonne 
I'm already gonne
My own wasteland
I don't belong 
I don't belong
My own wasteland

Scream at me until I shut down
Don't hear a sound
can only take so many cheap shots
down on the ground

I gotta go my own way this time
leave you behind
said it all but not enough for your
simple mind

[bridge]

[chorus]

You tell me what you want from me
you never ask me what i need
just let me go just set me free
and turn these nightmares into dreams

[bridge]

I'd rather live in my own Wasteland
And I wont waste another day
it doesn't matter what we say my own wasteland
your memories age 
and with new age
I'd rather die in my own Wasteland

I'm already gonne
I'm already gonne
My own wasteland
I don't belong 
I don't belong
My own wasteland
I'm already gonne
I'm already gonne
My own wasteland
I don't belong 
I don't belong
My own wasteland
