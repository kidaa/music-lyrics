Why don't you let me be
Leave me alone
You start a fire inside that I could never control
You wanna see a reaction

Come on and cut me down
You've gone as far as I'll go
Now you're crossing the line
And I am letting you know
Well here's your reaction

Stand up
I have had enough
Walk away before I finish what you started
Face to face I will put you in your place
End this game before I finish what you started
Face to face everything will change

You planted the seed
How my anger has grown
Got an feeling inside that I can't seem to control
You wanna see a reaction

Come on and cut me down
You've gone as far as I'll go
Now you're crossing the line and I am letting you know
Well here's your reaction

Stand up
I have had enough
Walk away before I finish what you started
Face to face I will put you in your place
End this game before I finish what you started
Face to face everything will change 

Insult
After insult [9x]

Stand up
I have had enough
Walk away before I finish what you started
Face to face I will put you in your place
End this game before I finish what you started
Face to face everything will change

Walk away
Everthing will change
End this game
You wanna see a reaction
You wanna see a reaction
Stand up
