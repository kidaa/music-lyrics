You have a chance to really shine now
Well patience was never one of your true virtues
Stop trying to control everything and f*** what they say, what do you have to prove

So why am I waiting, this time that I'm wasting, if that's what you mean

How will this be when all is said and done, will I know where I'm from remember me
Where will I be, I guess I'm on the run and time is catching up behind me

I'm scared to be the only one who sees
The hourglass run dry 'cause too much time went by
Why do I try to prove that I will be ready for everything thrown at me

These thoughts trickle down, imaginary lines cut through the ground
So why am I waiting, this time that I'm wasting, if that's what you mean
