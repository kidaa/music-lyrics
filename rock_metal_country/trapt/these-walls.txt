Something missing
Left behind
Search in circles
Every time I try
I've been here before
I've seen you before
I can't escape walking through these halls
Hard to find a place where there are no walls
And no lines begging me to cross
Only straight ahead better move along
Like Clockwork
I commit the crime
I pretend to be
everything they like
I've been here before
I've seen you before
And I trade everything for this
And I trade everything for this
Why do I read the writing on the wall
Why do I read the writing on the wall
I won't lose my place in line
I've been here too long and I've spent to much time
I won't lose my place in line
I've been here too long and I've spent too much time
