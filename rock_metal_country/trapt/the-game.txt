How have you been, nice to see you again
How quickly these conversations seem to end
You meet a friend, every now and then
How quickly these relations turn into trends

Put all your walls up and open your windows
And close all your doors
You find yourself standing in front of the mirror
And now you need more

What do you wish for
To catch you as you're falling
So easy to ignore
But now you hear it calling again

I wouldn't want to be you
This lonely game that you play
Between your walls you confuse
Every heart that you break
So afraid that you'll lose
Always a void to replace
I wouldn't want to play you

You try and pretend, the truth is hard to bend
How easy these translations can be read
What if you were led to play a different game instead
How hard these frustrations are to mend

Does it matter to you

Just Wait
