Aren't you bored of all this fake surrounding
I don't see that there is any choice for you
You must think this is all we have now
I don't see why we all move on but you
I'll stay right here for now not very long
Get your head up now don't make me go
Am I wrong to say that I don't miss this 
I was so bored with the old life I used to live
There's changes taking place and they won't overwhelm me I don't see why we all move on but you
It didn't' turn out the way you wanted it
The way you thought it would
But your lost and you'll never leave this precious place without someone to pick you up and show you how
I thought I heard y ou say that you were sick of this place I'm tired or hearing you cry NO
