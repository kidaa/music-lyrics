Hold me under water,
your hands around my neck
are you takin me out on me cause
we have nothing left 
we both went through it no use for regrets 
So young and stupid and we can't forget 

[bridge]
Well I'll see you again 
I will, I will find you 
I'll taste you again
I do, I do love you

Wherever she goes, ever she goes
I'll be wherever she goes, ever she goes
I'll be wherever she goes, ever she goes
I'll be wherever she goes, I'll be

Promising forever, starts with just a hope
staying together, well that's a different rope
do you believe me when I say I'm fine
what are you feelin so deep inside

[bridge]

Wherever she goes, ever she goes
I'll be wherever she goes, ever she goes
I'll be wherever she goes, ever she goes
I'll be wherever she goes, ever she goes
I'll be

who should we blame with our broken hearts
I wont let it tear us apart
you pointed your fingers you made your demands
and now you have left it all in my hands
I'll follow you, I'll follow you and I'll will give you back the feel

Wherever she goes, ever she goes
I'll be wherever she goes, ever she goes
I'll be wherever she goes, ever she goes
I'll be wherever she goes, ever she goes

I'll be wherever you go I'll be
open up to me, tell me what you need
Wherever she goes I'll be
