1...2...3...4...
I found a line and then it grew
I found myself still thinking of you
I felt so empty and now I'm fine
But still it's burning, when will you be mine

[Chorus:]
Too much of the same stories in our lives
I think it's time to change, don't you
Too much of the same stories in our lives
I think it's time for us to walk away from here

Now look at me still in your mind
Our memories so intertwined
Well you broke through and found your way
And so did I no need to stay
The same old pictures, tried and true
Been through there,looking for something new

[Chorus]

Do you remember lying on the beach so late at night
Do you remember running through the sprinklers that night
Do you remember all the songs that I have wrote for you,
all the songs that I have wrote for you

I remember,the way you made me feel when I was with you
I remember,the smile that always brought me back to you 
That look in your eyes I never thought that this could be untrue [x2]

[Chorus]
