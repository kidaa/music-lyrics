Its hard to trust a stranger
You're a stranger to yourself
So who's to blame
Drown away emotion
As you numb yourself from any real
Pain

There's nothing more real
And nothing's what it seems
We're always caught in between
There's nothing left to feel
But still you can not leave
You don't know what you need

I know that you use me to use you
I know that you use me to use you
I know that you use me to use you
To use you
Yeah

Loneliness a ritual
The walls you build around us feel
Safe
Silence is always comfortable
Is this the only reason that you
Stay

There's nothing more real
And nothing's what it seems
We're always caught in between
There's nothing left to feel
But still you cannot leave
You don't know what you need

I know that you use me to use you
I know that you use me to use you
I know that you use me to use you
I know that you use me!

Feel your arms around me
Wondering where this will go
I feel your arms around me
Will you ever want this like i do

I know that you use me to use you
I know that you use me to use you
I know that you use me to use you
I know that you use me!

I know that you use me to use you
I know that you use me to use you
To use you
To use you
To use you.....
