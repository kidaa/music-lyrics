We've been avoiding this for so long 
                     Luxury is temporary than it's gone 
                       I thought that we would happen 
                              I guess I'm wrong 
                              We'll move along 
                         I know this will be awkward 
                              but not for long 
                      Cause soon you'll have a new boy 
                             to sing you songs 

                                   chorus 

                           I will not forgive you 
                         Nor will I accept the blame 
                        I will see you on Good Friday 
                               On Good Friday 

                   I'm sorry I couldn't do this yesterday 
                       and tomorrow I am busy and what 
                              it is I can't say 
                           And Saturday's no good 
                                I got a show 
                        So it's got to be Good Friday 
                             Then it's so long 

                                   bridge 

                    You, You come and go when you please 
                          I know unfulfilled heads 
                              I know you do too 
                         But I, you know I never see 
                               things through, 
                         Never paid attention to you 
                             But honey I tried.
