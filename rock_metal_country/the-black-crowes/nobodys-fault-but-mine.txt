Nobody's fault but mine X 2 
Trying to save my soul tonight 
It's nobody's fault but mine 

Devil he told me to roll X2 
How to roll the log tonight 
Nobody's fault but mine 

Brother he showed me the gong? 
Brother he showed me the ding dong ding dong 
How to roll, the log tonight 
Oh, it's nobody's fault but mine 

Got a monkey on my back. X 2 
Gonna change my ways tonight 
Nobody's fault but mine 
I will get down rollin' tonight 
Nobody's fault
