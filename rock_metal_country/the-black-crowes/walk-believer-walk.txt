Go down go down you stranger
there's something waiting for you
Angels, dolls and honey
Temples and harpoons
You want your main line jesus
Your want your diamond
You want to pull the trigger
And kill the autumn home

So walk believer walk
Straight into the sun
Walk believer walk
Your word ain't ever done

Pray on pray on my brother
Nows the time for due
Black shadow come a creeping
Take the soul right out of you
Can you feel the demons puling
Can you hear the devils sing
Can you taste the poison in your mouth
Feel the weight of his chains

So walk believer walk
Straight into the sun
Walk believer walk
Your word ain't ever done

aaa a a a aaa aaa aaa a a a oo o o aa

So walk believer walk
Straight into the sun
Walk believer walk
Your word aint ever done
