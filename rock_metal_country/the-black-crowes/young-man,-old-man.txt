It's been tough, livin rough 
But you're here stay 
Six feet under the ground 
Is not as hard as it sounds OK 
Gittin' high, seein' with three eyes on a rainy day 
Been dusted, busted, blown away 
Gittin' in your ear, nothin' to fear 
Let the music play 
Big or tall, it's gonna hit you all 
Or get out the way 
Come along baby, soundin' strong baby 
What I say 
We all got lines and at the end 
We all gotta pay 

Chorus: 
Young man crazy 
Old man wise 
Some folks real 
Some just jive 
Young man crazy 
Old man wise 
Sun stars earth 
Moon sky tides 

Murder in mind and this time baby it's for real 
Take the devil aside it's time to make the deal 
Wash the blood if you want 
But the truth you can't conceal 
Gonna roll on driving wheel 

Chorus
