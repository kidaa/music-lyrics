Your words buzz around my head 
You make me feel warm again 
You are my lover, my song, my best friend 
I don't want this to ever end 

You hold my heart in your hands 
Our home is like a promised land 
I just want you, just want you to understand 

Only a fool would let you go 
Only a fool and I should know 
Only a fool would let you go 
I need you so baby please don't go 

When we're lying in our big old bed 
We wake up just to fall asleep again 
When I dream of the time we've spent 
It makes me so happy I just can't quit 

I see the love in your eyes 
It will stay there the rest of our lives 
And after that, and after that 
And over and over and over again
