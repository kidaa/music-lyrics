Well I dream of a lady 
Like an angel comes to me 
And she cools me with water 
Cause I'm scared of the heat 
But when I'm gone lord have mercy on me 
When I'm gone lord have mercy on me 
Well I once held my promise 
In the palm of my hand 
And the twelve unopened letters 
I should rest baby when I can ? 
When I'm gone Lord have mercy on me 
When I'm gone Lord have mercy, baby on me 
Yeah when I'm gone Lord have mercy on me 
Yeah when I'm gone Lord have mercy, oh, on me
