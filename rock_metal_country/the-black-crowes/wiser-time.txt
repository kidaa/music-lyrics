No time left now for shame 
Horizon behind me, no more pain 
Windswept stars blink and smile 
Another song, another mile 
You read the line every time 
Ask me about crime in my mind 
Ask me why another read song 
Funny but I bet you never left home 
Chorus: 
On a good day, it's not every day 
We can part the sea 
And on a bad day, it's not every day 
Glory beyond our reach 
Seconds until sunrise 
Tired but wiser for the time 
Lightning 30 miles away 
Three thousand more in two days 
Chorus
