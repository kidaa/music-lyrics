Hey there buddy 
                              Slow down for me 
                         I'm friendly and I'm clean 
                   I will not rob you or cause you misery 
                        Your wheels sound good to me 
                          I ain't green with travel 
                               As you can see 
                             I only got one bag 
                         If I am trouble drop me off 
                                 In Abilene 
                            I'll pay my gasoline 

                                   chorus 

                            Let me share the ride 
                           Let me share the ride 

                       It's hard living on travel time 
                       Please let me share your ride 

                           I never was a young man 
                               Never felt old 
                           This life is a mystery 
                          My coffee's hot not cold 
                        I'll turn your dashboard gold 
                        Slow down take a look at me 

                      I'm not not running from anything 
                            I've no past to hide 
                       I've got no secrets haunting me 
                              I just easy ride
