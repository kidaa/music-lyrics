Hey boys, buzzin' bee stingin'
Ringing ears never gonna' stop
Stand tall sickness creeping right on
Struttin' blues gonna' find me again

Got my head spinnin' round
Wonderin' when it's gonna stop
Got my head spinnin' round
Wonderin' when it's gonna stop

Out there, breeze is finally blowing
No tellin' when the train pulls in
My baby got her engine hummin'
Struttin' blues gonna' find me again

Got my head spinnin' round
Wonderin' when it's gonna stop
Got my head spinnin' round
Wonderin' when it's gonna stop 

Hey boys, hanging on the corner
Where you hidin' when the lights go dim
This thing lightin' got your thunder want to crack'n
Struttin' blues want to find me again

Got my head spinnin' round
Wonderin' when it's gonna stop
Got my head spinnin' round
Wonderin' when it's gonna stop
