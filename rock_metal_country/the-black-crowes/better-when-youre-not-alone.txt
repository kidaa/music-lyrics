I love you in the worst way 
                             The only way I know 
                       They say the clearer the water 
                           The more that it shows 
                        They say the deeper the river 
                            The stronger the love 
                          Your eyes don't lie to me 
                 And your smile is worth its weight in gold 

                                   Chorus 

                         This Life, this life aches 
                             and this life moans 
                   This life is great, this life is great 
                         And it's better when you're 
                                 not alone, 
                                 not alone 

                        You love me in the worst way 
                            The only way you know 
                      They say the higher the mountain 
                          The more love that grows 
                    They say the stronger the wind blows 
                            The farther we'll go 
                         I hope you don't lie to me 
                      There's nothing better than your 
                                   touch 

                 How many times does this happen two people 
                                like us meet 
                        As I try to be humble and lay 
                             down at your feet
