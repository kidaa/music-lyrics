Here I am 
There I was 
Here I go 
Just follow me 

If it was 
Then it can 
And we know 
How it will be 

When it was 
Just because 
Yes you know 
It's not a dream 

It's just all 
C'mon y'all 
I'll tell you 
What I mean 

When you want to lose your blues 
Go tell the congregation 
When there's nothing left that you can do 
Go tell the congregation 
When you want to tell the truth 
Go tell the congregation 
When the devil's got a hold of you 
Go tell the congregation 

Don't look back 
Stay on track 
It's a fact 
A lesson to me 

Keep in stride 
With your pride 
Now you know 
How strong you can be 

There's no time 
Draw a line 
Yes I know 
That you can know me 

Look alive 
No surprise 
Everybody wants to be free 

"Everything is everything"
