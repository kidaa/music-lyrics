Come on baby say my name 
Well do you want to play a game 
It feels so good it's almost pain 
And every time is always the same 

It could make a man insane 
Well baby that's okay, that's okay 

You're the reason I want to sing 
You make me feel like a king 
I love the sunshine that you bring 
I think I'll buy you a diamond ring 
A diamond ring 
Baby baby say I do 
And I'll spend my life with you 

Baby lay down by my side 
Baby don't you look divine 
The way you smile should be a crime 
You do it to me every time 

It's a feeling that no one could deny 
Baby tell me why 
Tell me why
