What could I do different? 
                         It makes one sober to think 
                            In an age of illusion 
                       It's hard to know when to stop 
                        How could I live indifferent 
                         Believing in time and fate 
                         As long as I have a witness 
                          My name is not at stake 

                                   chorus 

                           Bring on this flowering 
                             Bring on, Bring on 
                           Bring on this flowering 
                     Bring on thou words cannot describe 
                        It's hard waiting for heaven 
                        May your song keep you alive 

                                   chorus 

                       And on the day I said good-bye 
                      My drowning tear catches a light 
                           Like the gift of sight 
                     The baby's eye, darkness into light 
                           I can rest my soul and 
                              walk in the light 
                         I'm positively spring time 
                              The gift of sight 
The baby's eye 
Darkness into light
