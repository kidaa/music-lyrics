Did it make you stop and think 
You're on the brink 
And not to test you 'cause you 
Don't know how far you'd o 
Did you make a big mistake 
You curse your fate 
And you wish you could leave this life 
For just one day 

Welcome to the goodtimes honey 
Did you bring your own parade? 
Welcome to the big time baby 
Time for a serenade 

Did you say you lost your pride? 
You tried to hide 
But you're not strong enough 
To ever get away 

And it only goes to show 
What we all know 
That the tables will surely turn 
For you one day 

It should come as no surprise 
Just realize, that when it all comes down 
Who is really on your side
