You could be so energy 
                                 Electricity 
                           You could be lightening 
                            You could be anything 
                                A masterpiece
                               A revolutionary 
                      You can see what, you want to see 
                             Can you let it be? 
                               Learn or teach 

                                   chorus 

                       I'm only halfway to everywhere 

                           I'm thinking positively
                                 Positively
                              This is possible 
                         They can say right or wrong 
                            Never hear this song 
                           Or look you in the eye 
                        I'm getting rid of negativity 
                             Lose the loss in me 
                              Call it equality 
                         Good luck is a frame of mind 
                              Call it humankind 
                            And say it's destiny
