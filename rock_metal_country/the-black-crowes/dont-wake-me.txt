"Get Chris in here. Hey Chris! Have you got a minute? What?" 
Gonna stop on the dot 
Got hte ground all shaking 
The wink of and eye 
See the noose still swinging 
Feeling tounge tied 
And I'll nver sop falling 
Waste of my time 
And the girls start stalling 
Don't wake me up 
don't wake me 
Sleep walking dry 
Got everybody saking 
Make it all right 
See the old man coming 
The cat in the bag 
She gonna start scratching 
Jakc-kife's fine 
The blood mean's nothin' but 
Don't wake me up 
Don't' wake me 
Don't wake me up 
Don't wake me 
Solo 
Somebody ain't running 
Somebody ain't walking 
_______________talking 
______________________ 
______________________ sorry, no clue 
Gun-filing code ?!?!?! 
And the teeth start scraping 
The grave _______ doves 
And nobody laughing 
Live that life 
Rolling in the backroom 
Thorn stuck in my side 
Someone come and took off ? 
Don't wake me up 
Don't wake me 
Don't wake me up 
Don't wake me
