This is illegal 
                              Thru an evil eye 
                           And I won't deceive you 
                               This I testify 
                         You all know the reason why 
                            I won't enslave you 

                           A little bliss forever 
                         I'm not afraid to love you 
                           A little bliss forever 

                                   Chorus 

                     Look at the world with an evil eye 
                     Your cold heart won't let you cry 
                 Try to make a change in the wink of an eye 
                     Do you have it in you to even try? 

                            Jesus can't save you 
                     Though it's nice to think he'd try 
                          This is not to scare you 
                     This is to make sense of your time 
                        Do prophets speak in rhymes? 
                               Then you die!
