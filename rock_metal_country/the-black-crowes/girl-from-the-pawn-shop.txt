With a pawnshop eyes and a second hand frown 
                         she sat silent at the table 
                 Her boots were brown, should she leave town 
                    To play the role of lover ex-patriot 
               A nod to the waiter,always her flirty behavior, 
                  You know she always gets one on the house 
                      She pulls out a letter from a bag 
                      Under her sweater and before she 
                      reads she straightens her blouse 

         There's a passion in being alone A grace in a loveless time 
                 There's no new cross, there's no new sign 
                     only the sun and the changing tide 

                And out of respect, well really must confess 
                      I never lost your number I never 
                              lost your address 
                      And if we remain friends at best 
                        Sometime later no, no not yet 
                   we'll smile and remember it like this 

                      She put back the letter,one tear 
                     falls like a feather and disappears 
                           on this bar room floor 
                       The gratuity included, you know 
                            the letter concluded 

                              P.S. All my love
