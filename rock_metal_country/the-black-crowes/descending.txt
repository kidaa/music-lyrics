Have mercy baby 
I'm descending again 
Open your eyes 
This time it's sink or it's swim 
No sermons on ascending 
No verdict on deceit 
No selfish memorandum 
No confusion for me 
Chorus: 
Curses 
Curses and clues 
A feast for fools 
Have mercy baby 
And hand me downs 
It was just a few years ago 
You'd hand me ups and map 
Right out of town 
But I would let it slide 
Like mercury 
Silver and quick 
Poisonous and deadly 
So deadly
