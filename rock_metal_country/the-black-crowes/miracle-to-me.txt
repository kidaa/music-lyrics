So come on off of your rooftop 
Come on down to the street 
I've got something to tell you 
You're secret I will keep 
Tell me why have you been crying 
Why won't you look me in the eye 
I'm just trying to help you 
I just need to know why 
Please won't you let me try 

Chorus: 
Be my secret, be my joy 
Be a miracle to me 
Be my lover, be my friend 
Be a miracle to me 

I want to sleep in your moonglow 
In my mind you're smile I keep 
Head over heels I go 
Like a dream from a peaceful sleep 
This time I know I'm in deep 

Chorus
