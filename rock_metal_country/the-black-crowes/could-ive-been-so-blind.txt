How could I've been so blind
So empty that I've never felt warm
Can I spell it out
Turn myself out of my home
Lookin' like a fool
Feelin' even worse than it seems
Tryin' hard as nails
Belevin' only in myself

And now it looks like innocence is gone
I know right and I know what's wrong
Feeling lonely that's the way it goes
Sometimes

But my greatest fear
Paint a smile from ear to ear
Alone and cryin'
Living like this is no better than dying

I tell you baby things are gonna' change
Looking like we were caught out in the rain
Feeling lonely
That's the way it goes
Sometimes

Could I ever have been so blind
Could I ever have been so blind
Could I ever have been so blind
Could I ever have been so blind

Could I ever have been so blind
Could I ever have been so blind

Hardest thing I ever had to do
Was stand up straight and tell it all to you
Look you right in the eye
Tell you baby sorry but I have lied

And now it looks like innocence is gone
I know right and I know what's wrong
Feeling lonely that's the way it goes
Sometimes

Could I ever have been so blind
Could I ever have been so blind
Could I ever have been so blind
Could I ever have been so blind
