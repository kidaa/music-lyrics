Are you feeling me groove ya 
Do it get right to ya 
Do it creep right on up in your bones 
We be frightfully righteous and 
If you don't like us man 
Take your ear holes and go home 
Bye bye go home 

We got just what you need 
We brought you the remedy 

Chorus: 
Come on come on 
Let's get this thing started 
Come on come on 
Everyone 
Come on come on 
You know we're right on it 
Come on come on 
It's on 

We ain't foolin' we ain't playin' 
Lay it down no complaining 
Pick it up and break some for you 
So get on up out your seat 
Because you make this scene complete 
And we really like to stick it to you 
Yes we do 

We got just what you need 
Remember the remedy 

Chorus
