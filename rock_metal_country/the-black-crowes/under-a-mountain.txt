Never a heaven an age old question 
                          Written from a cold place 
                         I feel sour I need a shower 
                         Or just a slap in the face 
                        Circumstance has left romance 
                         And a puzzle in front of me 
                   Who knows the ending, if the truth need 
                bending, A lie is the tool that you'll need 

                                   chorus 

                           So I'm under a mountain 
                           Stuck to this mattress 
                             Perfume and valium 

                  What makes a Sunday different from Monday 
                         Could be a look in her eyes 
                  In need of flattery she changes batteries 
                        So that her light will shine 
                  The words she utters either so flows or 
                                  stutters 
                        They're either silly or wise 
                             Anger with concern 
                             But never to yearn 
Only to be by your side 

                           Lay down with number 13 
                           Its a cold gray shame
