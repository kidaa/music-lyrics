Nebakanzer never knew  
                   He left his needle outside in the rain  
                            And it rusted through  
                          He had twenty-nine blackbirds  
                              but only one flew  
                     Spent most of his time making holes  
                           And licking his wounds  
                          Nebakanezer lost his wife  
                     She took her diamond rings and was  
                            gone before the light  
                        She left one satin shoe and a  
                               very dull knife  
               She left one satin shoe and a very dull knife  

                                   chorus  

                      So tell us what the sorry singer  
                                  might do  
                         All of his friends complain  
                            That they got the flu  
                         They ain't sick in the head  
                       They look like the living dead  
                            And that's not cool
