Got a chainsaw buzzin'
Who's that cussin'
Eyes start blinkin'
The boys all start their wishing

Left holdin' the bag again 
Buring it at both ends
Don't believe she's a friend

Thick, thick   thin
Let it loose now, let it go to the wind

Got my clock tock tickin'
Hear the madame start bitchin'
See the boys itch itchin'
Do girls ever know what they're missin'

But it sounds like shit to me
Last laugh mine will be
I don't believe she is clean

Thick, thick   thin
Let it loose now, let it go to the wind
