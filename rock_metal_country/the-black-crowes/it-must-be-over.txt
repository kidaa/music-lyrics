No matter what road I take 
No matter what laws I break, I still 
I keep singing these songs 
No matter what my mistakes 
No matter how high the stakes, I won't 
I won't ever fold 

And with time you'll see 
You will forget about me 
And I've already disowned you 
From my memory 
Can you see 

I know it must be over 
This love can last no longer 
We both know that it must be over 
Now I see 

No matter what words I write 
No matter no wrong nor right, you still 
You listen anyway 
No matter where I sleep tonight 
No matter if the stars if the stars shine bright, I know 
That I'm on my way 

And with time you'll see 
You will forget about me 
And I've already disowned you 
From my memory 
Can you see 

I know it must be over 
This love can last no longer 
We both know that it must be over 
Now I see 

Alone is just alone 
Tell me what's a happy home 
Tell me what's a wasted year 
When you lose, when you lose all of your fears 
Tell me 

And with time you'll see 
You will forget about me 
And I've already disowned you 
From my memory 
Can you see 

I know it must be over 
This love can last no longer 
We both know that it must be over 
Now I see, now I see, now I.... 

I know, I know that it must over 
This love can last no longer 
We both know that it must be over 
Now I see
