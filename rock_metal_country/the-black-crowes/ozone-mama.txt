It's a trip y'all 
Git hip to this y'all 
It will git ya'll 
Gonna hit y'all 
Never quit y'all 
Right in the middle of our minds 
The bug that bit y'all 
Make ya itch y'all 
Inch by inch y'all 
Til your tall y'all 
See it all y'all 
Near and far y'all 
We won't ever let it drag 
This funny feeling got me reeling 
Like I'm walking on the ceiling 
Do it to me now 

Chorus: 
Ozone mama lay your daddy down 
Under the stars right down on the ground 
Mother nature got me thinking 
'Bout the love that you've been bringin' 
Do it to me now 

C'mon the ride y'all 
We provide y'all 
It's like this y'all 
Never miss y'all 
Git up and go y'all 
Ya never know y'all 
We be the bottom of your bag 
Give a call y'all 
Anytime y'all 
Don't be slow y'all 
Ya gotta know y'all 
On with the show y'all 
Bring it all y'all 
We don't ever have to brag 
Well you got this poor boy thinking 
Your lovin cup I've been drinking 
Do it to me now
