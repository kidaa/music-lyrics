Wake me when the day breaks 
Show me how the sun shines 
Tell me about your heartaches
Who could be so unkind? 
Do you dream to touch me? 
And smile down deep inside 
Or could you just kill me? 
It's hard to make up your mind, sometimes. 

My angels, my devils, my thorn in my pride. 

Are you wanting inspiration
You spill your secrets on me 
Then you tell me with a whisper 
Of things that will never be. 
Do you hear me breathing?
Does it make you want to scream? 
Did you ever like a bad dream? 
Sometimes life is obscene. 

My angels, my devils, my thorn in my pride. 

Lover cover me with your sleep 
Let your love light shine 
Lover cover me with a good dream 
Let your love light shine
