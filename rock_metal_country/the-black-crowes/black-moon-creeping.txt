Sleeping eyes sleep awhile 
And let me get to know your language 
If I believe all I see 
I would hate to be around for the dawn 
Sleeping eyes stay awhile 
And give me some cause to rejoice 
A parody of the scene 
Where my three wishes were granted to me 

What you got buried?  In your backyard 
What secret do you sleep with when the black moon come 

Sleeping eyes please come clean 
I'm not giving you the third degree 
When you live with no man's time 
Ain't it hard to find some peace of mind 
Sleeping eyes don't you cry 
And don't pretend this is not an ending 
Your history yes it seems 
Has been swept out with the leaves
