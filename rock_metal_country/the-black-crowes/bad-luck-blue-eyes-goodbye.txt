With my winter time 
My idols and stage fright 
In another night 
Where the lights are loud and bright 

One dream from waking up saved 
Too shy to hold in the rage 

I know no luxury 
Of knowing what your eyes read 
I know one million ways 
To always pick the wrong thing to say 

A love that you never gave 
Always a time zone away 
It's not out of spite 
I know what's right 

Bad Luck Blue Eyes Goodbye 

Sometimes a memory 
Only sees what it wants to believe 
And what's filled in between 
Are days and nights that don't mean a thing 

Such a simple suicide 
A second chance never tried 
And you don't understand 
I need a helping hand 

So you think that you've seen it all 
Is that a fact? 
So out your mouth a dictionary 
Spouts about this and that 
You got your do's, your don'ts 
Because and why 
I don't trust no one who don't 
Take their own advice 

Bad Luck Blue Eyes Goodbye
