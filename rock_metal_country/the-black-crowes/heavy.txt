Lordy baby could you tell me what's wrong with me 
The way I feel nobody would believe 
All these things that you do 
You know they drive me out of my mind 
And as mean as you are 
You know you are my kind 

They way you put on your clothes 
The way you wiggle your toes 
The way you scratch your nose 
When you watch it grow 

For the first time 
I know you're mine 
And if you want to know 
I'll tell you so 
What can I say 
I just want you to stay 
You're so heavy, you're so heavy 

Lordy baby you do get under my skin 
Who you kidding baby 
You know I'll do it again 
Lordy baby you left me black and blue 
But that's okay because I know that you dig it too 

The way you say hello 
When you dig a hole 
When you wear yellow 
When you play your cello 

The way your story goes 
They way you make me glow 
When you let it snow 
What I knows I knows
