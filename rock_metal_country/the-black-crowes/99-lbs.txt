Twenty-five pounds of pure cane sugar 
She's got in each and every kiss 
You wouldn't know what I'm talking 'bout 
If you never had a love like this 
Well, I don't mean to be frank with you all 
It's a natural fact 
Good things come wrapped up in small, small packages now 
Well you can't argue with that 
Oh, oh, yeah 
Ninety-nine pounds of natural born goodness 
Ninety-nine pounds of soul, oh, oh 
Ninety-nine pounds of natural born goodness 
Ninety-nine pounds of soul 
Twenty-five pounds of tenderness 
She got in each and every touch 
Twenty-five pounds of understanding my woman 
'Cause I was the one running 'round town worrying too much 
Twenty-four pounds of Sunday 
That I can't see, yeah 
And it all adds up to ninety-nine big pounds 
Oh, I'm talking about a feline friend 
Ninety-nine pounds of natural born goodness 
Ninety-nine pounds of soul 
Ninety-nine pounds of natural born goodness 
Ninety-nine pounds of soul 
Ninety-nine pounds of natural born goodness 
Ninety-nine pounds of soul 
Ninety-nine pounds of natural born goodness 
Ninety-nine pounds of soul 
Ninety-nine pounds of natural born goodness 
Ninety-nine pounds of soul 
Ninety-nine pounds of natural born goodness 
Ninety-nine pounds of soul
