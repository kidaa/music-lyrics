From the moment you see 
the moment you breath 
the moment I touch you 

From the moment you crawl 
the moment you fall 
the instant I loved you again 

From the moment of darkness 
the moment of light 
the second I kissed you 

From the moment I enter 
the moment I leave 
In this moment of rapture 

chorus 

One mirror to many gonna tie you up 
A life forever empty has got to be tough 
To many starless night gonna leave you blind 
Can never make it right 

From the moment you stumble 
the moment you run 
In your presence I crumble 
From the moment it happens 
the moment you know 
There's no life without you
