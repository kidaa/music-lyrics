Can't help about the shape I'm in 
I can't sing, I ain't pretty and my legs are thin 
But don't ask me what I think of you 
I might not give the answer that you want me to 
Oh well 

When I talked to God, I knew he'd understand 
He said stick by me and I'll be your guiding hand 
But don't ask me what I think of you 
I might not give the answer that you want me to 
Oh well
