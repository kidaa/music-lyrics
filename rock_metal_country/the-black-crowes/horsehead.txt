Horsehead go you bug eyed 
Horsehead left the day for night 
Horsehead ain't no dragonfly 
Horsehead help you live a lie 

You can not see the hole in front of you 
And I will see you down if you want me to 

You are blessed with just one life 
All you are is what's inside 
If you take, then step aside 
Jesus gave until he died 

Horsehead feel your soul fall 
Horsehead gonna take a die 
Horsehead ain't no good at all 
Horsehead said you're gonna die
