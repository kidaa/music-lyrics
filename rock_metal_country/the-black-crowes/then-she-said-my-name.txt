Let me tell you 'bout the book 
That I've been reading 
It's got all my favorite words 
Let me tell you 'bout who I saw scheming 
Ya better know it's not my girl 

Let me tell ya 'bout what I've been seeing 
It's the window to the world 
Let me tell you 'bout the secret 
I've been keeping 
Said the oyster to the pearl 

Are you sorry? 
No not me 
And tell me why should I be 
Cause I've been knocked right off of my feet 
And no I didn't even miss a beat 

I never thought a love could be like this 
Then she said my name 
Now I'm wrapped around her finger 
I'll never be the same 

So let me tell ya 'bout the joke 
That you've been living 
Said the clown to the fool 
Let me tell you 'bout 
The wheEl that keeps on spinning 
Said the teacher to the school 

Are you worried? 
Well could be, cause I'll tell you what I've seen 
I've weathered storms that would sink most ships 
Yes I know when to button my lip 

Offer me a melody 
Pour a cup of wine 
Spill your deepest memory 
And someday you'll be fine
