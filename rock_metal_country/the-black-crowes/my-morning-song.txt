Dizzy found me last night 
Saw some kind of new light 
I woke up in a whirlwind 
Just you watch my head spin 
The spectacle that made you cry 
It's a thrill a minute plane ride 
It's over time at ring side, no lie 

March me down to the seven seas 
Bury me with a ruby ring 
Kiss me baby on an Easter Sunday day 
Make my haze blow away 

I hide I seek and I find 
Truth in a fable faith in a rhyme 
So why you want to bad talk me 
Are you surprised by what we see? 
Like the tables and the tides turn 
On my bed the emperor worn 
Is that enough for me, could be 

If music got to free your mind 
Just let it go cause you never know, you never know 
If your rhythm ever falls out of time 
You can bring it to me and I will make it alright 
And if your soul is let go 
Oh you never know, no you never know 
And if your heart is beating free 
For the very first time it'll be alright
