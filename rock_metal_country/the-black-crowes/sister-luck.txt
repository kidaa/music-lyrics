Worried sick my eyes are hurting
To rest my head I'd take a life
Outside the girls are dancing
'Cause when you're down it just don't seem right

Feeling second fiddle to a dead man
Up to my neck with your disregard
Like a beat dog that's walking on the broadway
No one wants to hear you when you're down

Sister luck is screaming out 
Somebody else's name
Sister luck is screaming out
Somebody else's name

A flip of a coin
Might make a head turn
No surprise, who sleeps
Held my hand over a candle
Flame burnin' but I never weep

Sister luck is screaming out 
Somebody else's name
Sister luck is screaming out
Somebody else's name

What a shame

Sister luck is screaming out 
Somebody else's name
Sister luck is screaming out
Somebody else's name
