So you found yourself a killer 
The one with blue eyes 
I guess the bloodstains on the blanket don't lie 
Well I guess I saw it comin' 
Like a boy I just kept runnin' 
But through this crime I have survived 

Chorus: 
They're gonna hang you from the cypress tree 
The crowd gonna cheer when they see you swing 
Yeah they're gonna hang you from the cypress tree 
Tell me now do you believe? 

Glory Hallelujah 
I raise my glass up to you 
And I bow my head with utmost respect 
But I think it's only fair to warn you 
That there's a storm that's coming up on you 
And like the wind and the rain 
My words are direct 

Chorus 

It's a funny word 'friends' 
You get beginnings and you got ends 
I guess I'll see you when we're ashes again
