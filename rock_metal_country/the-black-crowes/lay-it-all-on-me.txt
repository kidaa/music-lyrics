Come on down crooked man 
Step on up broken man 
It's okay to cry troubled man 
Just ease your worried mind and rest awhile 

Do you remember when it started 
You had a dream 
Now you never talk about it 
Your fame   riches were everything 
No matter what the cost 
Now you wish you hadn't blown it 

Well lay it all on me 
Lay it all on me 

Come on down crooked man 
Step on up broken man 
It's okay to cry troubled man 
Just ease your worried mind and rest awhile 

I came to see how you were doing 
It's been awhile 
Lookin back over your shoulder 
You were restless and you were wild 
Always running away 
Once was young now is older 

Lay it all on me, lay it all on me 

Come on down crooked man 
Step on up broken man 
It's okay to cry troubled man 
Just ease your worried mind and rest awhile
