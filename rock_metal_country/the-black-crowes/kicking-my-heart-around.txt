Just come out and say it 
Spit the words out of your mouth 
It needs no explaining 
'Cuz we both felt it go south 

Just stop kickin' my heart around 
For the last time 
Stop kickin' my heart around 

Well I told you so 
Not it's time to go 
Got to get this show on the road 
Just stop kickin' my heart around 

In the beginning 
There was no wrong you could do 
Now in this ending 
I can't stand looking at you
