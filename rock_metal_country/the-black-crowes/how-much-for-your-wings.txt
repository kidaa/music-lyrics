                          How much for your wings? 
                          Well it comes and it goes 
                          How much for your wings? 
                            And it's high and low 
                          How much for your wings? 
                             I can name a price 
                          How much for your wings? 
                          Many forget their pride 

                                   chorus 

                      If I were you and and you were me 
                                  we'd know 
                      And could it be what you perceive 
                                  is wrong? 
                     And what I mean what wrong could be 
                                I don't know 
                         I'm not naive but I believe 
                               So I may grow

                         The soul you kiss good-bye 
                          How much for your wings? 
                          Watch the stars collide 

                              How does it feel 
                         When you're the only one?
