What kind of trouble did I get into? 
Gotcha moving, gotcha moving 

Not staying long just passing through 
Keep you rolling, keep you rolling 

I know the chemicals you like too 
Gotcha moving, gotcha moving 
And if you ask me nice 
I'll take you to school 
Keep you rolling, keep you rolling 

I took all I need 
I don't need no more 
Then I'll take what I want 
Until I want some more 

You can't stop 
Or I might pass ya 
If you slow down 
I'll out last ya 
But when you're down 
You won't find me laughing 
Just one question I might ask ya 
It might sound like a disaster 
Can you make this thing go faster? 

I know something baby we can do 
Gotcha moving, gotcha moving 
A pinch, a bite, a lick or maybe two 
Keep you rolling, keep you rolling 

Saw what I came to see 
Don't want to see no more 
I don't think it's diseased 
But is sure is sore
