You come in the room and you close the door 
And you let me see what you're really here for 
Then you lay me down in an unmade bed 
And you show me things that aren't easily said 
Working in circles and twisting away 
Making it hard to breathe 
Touching my skin 
I don't want it to end 
I'm gone and you can't catch me 

Chorus: 
There's no use lying 
Because I've heard all your bullshit before 
You've said your old line for the very last time 
Don't want you round my backdoor 

She says my name and it takes me away 
A kiss on my brow and I'm here to stay 
When the clock chimes twelve 
And we're down on the floor 
She tells me things I've never heard before 
Working in circles and twisting away 
Making it hard to breathe 
Touching my skin 
I don't want it to end 
I'm gone and you can't catch me 

Chorus
