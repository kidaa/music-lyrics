Wanna tell you 'bout the girl I love. 
My, she looks so fine 
An' she's the only one that I've been dreamin' of, 
Maybe someday she will be all mine. 
I wanna tell her that I love her so, 
I thrill with her every touch, 
I need to tell her she's the only one I really love. 

I got a woman, wan' ball all day. 
I got a woman, she won't be true no. 
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time. 
I said I got a little woman and she won't be true. 

On Sunday mornin' when we go down to church 
See the menfolk standin' in line. 
Don't say they come to pray to the Lord 
But when my little girl looks so fine. 
An' in the evenin' when the sun is sinkin' low 
Everybody's with the one they love. 
I walk the town, keep-a searchin' all around, 
Lookin' for my street corner girl. 

I got a woman, wan' ball all day yeah. 
I got a woman, she won't be true no, no. 
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time. 
I said I got a little woman and she won't be true. 

An' in the bars with the men who play guitars, 
Singin', drinkin' and rememberin' the time, 
A-my little lover does a midnight shift, 
She fool around-a all 'a' the time. 
I guess there's just one thing then left for me to do: 
Gonna pack my bags an' move on my way 
A-'cause I got a worried mind sharin' what I thought was mine. 
Gonna leave her where the guitars play. 

I got a woman, she won't be true no, no. 
I got a woman, wanna ball all day-yeah-yeah now, now. 
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time. 
I got a little woman and she won't be true.
