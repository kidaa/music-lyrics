You, with your fast and furlined mind 
With your disregard of time, virtue, horizon 
Here where the angels never sleep 
Where the water's dark and deep 
You breathe molasses 

Chorus: 
Midnight from the inside out 
Turn around and they all fall down 
Screaming red and the lights go out 
Turn around and they all fall down 

You, madness dripping from your tongue 
While starting at the sun 
You speak explosion 
Up, with the flies around the moon 
Needle, mirror, spoon and cotton candy
