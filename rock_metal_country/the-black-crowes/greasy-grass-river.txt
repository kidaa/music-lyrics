Now I'm swimming in the greasy grass river 
On my way to the black pearl sea 
Yeah I'm floating down the greasy grass river 
Come one child come with me 
Life is so easy on greasy grass river 
Just take my hand and we can pretend to be free 
You wanna be 
Free 
Come on with me 

Take me down to the greasy grass river 
Wash my hands where the water is clean 
Lay me down by the greasy grass river 
And unfold my mystery 
The greasy grass river has water that whispers 
Let's listen closely while 
She says she wants to be free 
You wanna be 
Free 
You know what I mean? 

Outro: 
I'm out of my pocket and I'm out on my mind 
I'm out of my pocket and I'm out on my mind 
I'm out of my pocket and I'm out on my mind 
I'm out of my pocket and I'm out on my mind
