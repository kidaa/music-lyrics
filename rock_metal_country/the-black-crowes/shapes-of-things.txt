Shapes of things before my eyes 
Just teach me to despise 
Will time make men more wise 
Here within my lonely frame 
my eyes just heard my brain 
But will it seem the same 

Come tomorrow, will I be older 
Come Tomorrow, may be a soldier. 
Come Tomorrow, may I be bolder than today? 

Now the trees are almost green. 
But will they still be seen? 
When time and tide have been. 
Fall into your passing hands. 
Please don't destroy these lands. 
Don't make them desert sands. 

Chorus 

Soon I hope that I will find, 
Thoughts deep within my mind. 
That won't displace my kind.
