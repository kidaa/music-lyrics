Diamonds hold mirrors
And spoon it holds the stars
It's been a long time baby
Since i've seen the sun rise like this
Make a wish and call it maybe
And give me one more kiss
Ooh, I like it like this
Ooh, I like it like this

Oh josephine
Youre dressed in black
Oh josephine
Your eyes are blue
And I know now
There's no turning back
Oh josephine
What will we do?

It's the dreaming through the come down
Still filling every tape
Come on and touch me baby
Before I turn to rust
I know there ain't no other
It's not a matter of trust
It's just sometimes love ain't enough
Ooh, love ain't enough

Oh josephine
Youre dressed in black
Oh josephine
Your eyes are blue
And I know now
There's no turning back
Oh josephine

What will we do?

For a while I was kneeling in tears and powder
For as well I was strung out beyond my means
Well I lost that love while climbing down the ladder
Just looking for the song to set me free

Waited for redemption
No leaving love behind
You've got to know where you wanna be
It gets cold outside
It's too late to play it safe
So let's let it all ride
Yeah, let's let it all ride
Let it all ride!

Oh josephine
Youre dressed in black
Oh josephine
Your eyes are blue
And I know now
There's no turning back
Oh josephine
What will we do?
Yeah

Oh josephine
Youre dressed in black
Oh josephine
Your eyes are blue
And I know, I know
There's no turning back
Oh josephine
What will we do?
