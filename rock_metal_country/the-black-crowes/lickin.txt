Your eyes they look like two bullet holes 
And you don't ever say maybe 
You knock me out with the way you talk 
I like the way you say "Baby" 
You want a mouthful of scorpio 
Yeah, but my poison be tasty 
You bite my finger and say 'control' 
You won't let me be lazy 

Chorus: 
Night and day like a mule I'm kickin' 
Girl you gonna catch a lickin' 

Fire out of the mouths of babes 
Got you actin' so crazy 
Doorknob queen of the underage 
Got me rantin' and ravin' 
See the bruise you left on my page 
Now the game's getting tricky 
Left alone in my own parade 
While the bomb just keeps tickin' 

Chorus 

Do you want to do it all with me 
Do you want to scream and bleed for me 
You can have all of me, all of me 
Your teeth taste just like razorblades 
Yeah you got my tongue ready 
You fill me up with your politics 
And leave me so heavy
