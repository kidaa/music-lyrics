Down and dirty nappy 
Tired sad nasty 
It's not everlasting 
It's bound to turn around 
Need a little sweetness 
A little reason to your rhyme 
I got something for you 
A little sugar for your mind 
Hear the bells ringing 
Send it down the line 
Thank you for the sharing 
I get you back next time 

Chorus: 
My friend the cosmos is calling 
Sayin' we all should be shining 

Don't you be a stranger 
We like you hanging around 
Be thankful of the laughter 
Praise for the sound 
When you're feelin lonely 
You know just what to do 
Put on track eleven 
Get on with the groove 

Chorus 

Now we've reached the ending 
I'm sad this song is gone 
But we can start at the beginning 
And we can all sing along 

Down and dirty nappy 
Tired sad nasty 
It's not everlasting 
It's bound to turn around
