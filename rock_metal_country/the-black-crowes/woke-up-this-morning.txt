I woke up this morning, my baby was gone 
Woke up this morning, my baby was gone 
I've been so bad, I'm all alone 

I ain't got nobody stayin' home with me 
I ain't got nobody stayin' home with me 
My baby she's gone, I'm in misery 

Well baby, I'm all alone 
Yes baby, I'm all alone 
I ain't got no lovin' 
Since my baby's been gone 
allright

Oh baby, I'm all alone 
Oh baby, I'm all alone 
My baby she's gone, I'm in misery 

Oh baby, I'm all alone 
Oh baby, I'm all alone 
I ain't had no lovin' since my baby's been gone
