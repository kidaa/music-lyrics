Think of me 
I'll think of you 
We better think 
This whole thing through 
Sometimes I'm so clumsy 

You talk to me 
I'll talk to you 
You cut the fat 
And we'll both chew 
You know we're both hungry 

I feel so alive today 
That's all that I wanted to say 
I hope that it stays this way 
If not I will be okay 

Say another prayer 
Save another life 
Kiss me on my head 
And tell me 
Everything's alright 
'Cause I can say it one 
Or I can shout it twice 
All there really is 
Is virtue and vice 
Virtue and vice 

Cry to me 
I'll cry to you 
Sometimes the pain will only do 
You know I'm not kidding 

You laugh with me 
I'll laugh with you 
At all the stupid things we do 
Tomorrow we'll be happy
