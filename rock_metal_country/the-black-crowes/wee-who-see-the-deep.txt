Put forever in your mind
Let go of space and time
Yeah say it is we who see the deep
It is we that the less earn teeth

Do you even know this place
Nowhere is over
To find our way back to grace
Nowhere is nothing at all

Well I have come from a hurricane
A messenger that the temp is praying
Eyes full of sun, hands full of sea
Anyone with the night just to help me see

[Chorus]

I said nowhere is nothing at all
I said nowhere is nothing at al'
I said nowhere is nothing at all
I said nowhere is nothing at all

Nowhere is nothing at all
Well I said nowhere nowhere, nowhere, nowhere, nowhere is nothing at all
I said nowhere is nothing at all
