You know you shook me. You shook me all night long. - X2 
You shook me so hard baby. Baby, baby, please come home. 

I have a bird that whistles and I have birds that sing. - X2 
I have a baby, won't do nothing ...oh, buy a diamond ring. 

I said you shook me, baby. You shook me all night long. -X2 
You shook me so hard, baby. You shook me all night long.
