If you come to my house 
You gonna find me around, Lordy 
Somewhere baby 
Lordy shake 'em on down, Lordy 

If you see my baby, 
Lordy, standin' round 
You know we getting ready now, 
we gonna shake 'em on down, Lordy 

Put your knees together 
Let your backbone move 
Ain't no one in town can 
Shake 'em on down like you---Oh Lord, you 

Going way up on the hill 
Gonna get some ice 
'Fore we get back gonna 
Shake 'em down twice
