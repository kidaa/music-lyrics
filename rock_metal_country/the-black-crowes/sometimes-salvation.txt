To lessen my troubles 
I stopped hanging out with relatives 
And empty saviours like you 
I wish I had a nickel for every miracle 
That you easily tricked me into 

You can lead a horse to water 
But faith is another matter 
So don't you surrender 
Cause sometimes salvation 
In the eye of the storm 

I've no time for accusations 
Or conversations on all the bad, bad things you do. 
Just a note from your jailor 
Drugs and the relations 
To all the people around you 

You can lead a horse to water 
But faith is another matter 
So don't you surrender 
Cause sometimes salvation 
In the eye of the storm 

I've kept secret your superstitions 
And all its twisted wisdom 
That I fell into 

Sister can you try and find me?
