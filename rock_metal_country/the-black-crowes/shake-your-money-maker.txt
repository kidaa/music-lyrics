Shake your moneymaker 
Shake your moneymaker 
Shake your moneymaker 
Shake your moneymaker 
Shake your moneymaker, and then 

I got a girl lives up on the hill 
I got a girl lives up on the hill 
Says she gonna love me but I don't believe she will 

You gotta shake your moneymaker 
Shake your money maker 
Shake your moneymaker 
Shake your moneymaker 
Shake your moneymaker, and then 

I got a girl and she just won't be true 
I got a girl and she just won't be true 
She's locked to the bridge, she won't do a thing I tell her to 

She won't shake her moneymaker 
Won't shake her moneymaker 
She wanna roll her activator 
She won't shake her moneymaker 
She won't shake her moneymaker 
She won't
