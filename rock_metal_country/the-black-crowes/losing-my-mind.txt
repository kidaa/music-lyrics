Every time I fall 
I bring you along 
Because I need you there 
Every time I leave 
For my selfish things 
I know I'm wrong 

No matter what I want to believe 
Nothing like this comes easily 

Chorus: 
I love you, yes I love you 
Even though I know I should stay away 
Because I hate you, yes I hate you 
Even though it looks like I'm going to stay 
And I think that I'm losing my mind 

My time in the dark 
Was tearing me apart 
And that's not okay 
A man of blood and bones 
Alone on his throne 
could walk away 
Oh how your web has been spun 
And I'm out of my mind 
And it ain't no fun
