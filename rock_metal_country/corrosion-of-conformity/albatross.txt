Left behind what a waste of time
Theyre coming to get you,run on
How can i respect your crime
They bought and sold you , run on run on. 
You can call me crazy
You can call me wrong
Cause i was born a liar, albatross
Fly on 
My home is kind man it pays to be blind
I promise to forget you run on
No swallowed pride no conspiracy lined
Broken promise of virtue run on. 
You can call me lazy
But i know where i belong
Cause i was born a liar, albatross
Fly on with your trust in love
From your god above.. . 
I beleive the albatross is me 
I should have seen the sighns
Now the memorys far behind
It was no big loss, fly on albatross
