Invalid at last smothers the working class
nihilist to be turns the scrape into a gash
walking tall and ignorant-this man is now a militant
deceiving the prophets confession to release this endless aggression
One is the soul Amplified Suicide
Keeps the masses terrified
But there's nothing to kill nothing to kill
Nothing left unsaid
Cause the snake has no head
But the body fills with greed and we spill when in need
and all the slaves are on probation growing fat in a comfortable nation
so the snake keeps on recruiting we one more royal shooting
nothing left to lose so we create another wound
One is the soul Amplified Suicide
Keeps the masses terrified
Nothing to kill nothing to kill nothing to kill
Nothing left unsaid
Cause the snake has no head
Fear of death is gain consuming the weak in shame
it's a power we can't see but it leaves ourselves to blame
shameless mourn another day slithering sins fade away
but the snake is just a pawn and remains when we are gone
One is the soul Amplified Suicide
Keeps the masses terrified
Nothing to kill nothing to kill nothing to kill
Nothing left unsaid
Cause the snake has no head
