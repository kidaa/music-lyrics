I've Been Looking For Answers To Set You Free
Black Are The Reasons You Gave Me 
Never, Never Look Back
Just Move, Move Ahead
You Were Lucky, Friend
You Could Be Dead 
Ignore The Future Or Bury Your Head In The Sand
It's A Two-Bit Fantasy That The Man In Your Head Demands
You Can Say It With A Vengeance - You'll Be Back From The Grave
Time Waits For No One - This Has To Be True
Mine Ran Out A Long Time Ago - There's Nothing You Can Do
Never... 
Now You're Lying With A Burden That Rests Upon Your Mind
You Were Lying To Yourself 'Cos You Were Afraid Of What You'd Find
You Can Say It With A Vengeance - You'll Be Back From The Grave
We'll Be Waiting A Long, Long Time Before You're Ever Saved 
Drifting So Far Away - Things Seem So Strange
Thought You Could Escape - Believed Things Would Change
Never... 
Ignore The Future Or Bury Your Head In The Sand
Its A Two-Bit Fantasy That The Man In Your Head Demands
Now You're Lying With A Burden That Rests Upon Your Mind
You Were Lying To Yourself 'Cos You Were Afraid Of What You'd Find
You Can Say It With A Vengeance - You'll Be Back From The Grave
