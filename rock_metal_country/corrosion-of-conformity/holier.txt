Holier, much holier than you were before
No more
Now your purpose, Jesus, flowing in your soul
No more
Feel complete what a nice retreat to the call
No more
The wrath of God will serve you well as bodies fall
In hate
Finding the answers, distoring the question
Ending all possibilities for things to change
Rotting in your empty shell
Writhing in relentless hell
It's death you chose, you chose it well
In your mind you've found it
In my mind, where's your God? He's in your head
In their minds, they've found it
In my mind, where's your God? He's in your head
