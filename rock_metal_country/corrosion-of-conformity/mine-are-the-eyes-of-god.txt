Taught To Believe From The Onset, Of Heaven And Hell And Between
The Institution's Retribution - Damnation From On High
Living And Dying Together Never Did Nothing At All
Except For The Few Who Got Rich Off Of You
And The Rest, They Were Herded Like Sheep 
Chorus
Mine Are The Eyes Of God
And What I See Is Not What Was Meant To Be
Mine Are The Eyes Of God
Mine Are The Eyes
Mine Are The Eyes Of God
Down The Road To Betrayal Of Values They Held To Be True
An Abberration, Deviation To Get To The Spirit Of Life
The Whole Goddamn World Is Riding On Words For Thousands Of Years
It's Just Like The West, To Think It Knows Best
When Answers Are Subject To Change 
Chorus
They Took What Could Have Been
And Turned It Upside Down
They Twisted All Things Seen
What's Lost Must Now Be Found
I Got To See It
Got To Believe It
I Got To Be There 
I Got To See It
Got To Believe It 
Given The Power Of Reason Yet Throwing It All To The Wind
No Solution In Evolution - Only The Blood-Stained Glass
A Soul Full Of Lies In Contention, Begs Sacred Yet Worships Profane
Lose Sight Of The Fact That You're Where It's At Not The Stars, Not The Cross, 
Nor The Moon 
Chorus
