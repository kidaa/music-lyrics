Grace, pride, tell me whats your name?/
Crippled will with tomorrows pill
And i feel no pain but i cant remember

This is not my home
This is not myhome
But the source was always known

Blistered and torn by the pure & reborn
But there re just like us and remember
Man, they cave in...

Wicked goddam bass licks war stone, do you write your name in trust?/
Word to the wise my instincts rise
All your heros are gone and the proud
Ones have turned to dust,.. Seven dust...
You can kill my pride but my heads still
Flying!
