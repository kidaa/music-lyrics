I'm at a loss for words
There are no words to explain
What I am witnessing
Is fucking with my brain
You can see it in my eyes
It will never be the same
It will never, never, never
Be the same
Time to tear down what remains
And start something new
I'm tired of going through the
Motions
Feeling like an empty shell
Drained of all emotions
IO feel nothing at all
I've got to get away
Get out of my way
We were searching thought we
Were on to something
But it disintegrated before
Our eyes
Same old thing in a new
Disguise
Contemplating no violence
Not at peace, trusting sixth
Sense, I need release
Won't cry no tears, I have none
