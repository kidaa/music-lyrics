Is there no one to deliver you from your ignorance?
Maybe you'll look and see thel be no deliverance.
Turn to vulture parasites who pray on lost souls
Suck the blood of hapless fools who give them control! 
No deliverance
Pick your wn deliverance
No deliverance 
Sad domination by those who say more than you'll ever know
To the depths of dogma hollow
It's them you follow.. 
No deliverance! 
Irredemption pure deception won't see what's if or true
Shutter your world and you wont be shut out
The devastating truth
Denial on ontrial like a jumbo cap
Vile brother are you through?? 
No deliverance
Pick your own deliverance
No deliverance 
Sad domination by those who say more than
You'll ever know
To the depths of dogma, hollow
It s them you follow 
Bleeding inside breathing with pride
They tow the line
We feed thecrime with borrowed time select and find
No longer will they know
We amputate the shown...
