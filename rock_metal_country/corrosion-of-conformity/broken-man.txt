Deep in the soul of a man whos seen it all- he stands alone with borrowed t i m 
E
Standing with t wo nothings new but they look at you with broken backs and 
Bleeding minds
And tell you they know even though you fall behind
You,ll be the one who walks the line-standing tall*-
Theyre so fragile, but they always find you when you hide... 
Cause your a broken man in a broken land
And dont they wish they were blessed like you. 
The struggle in side of your mind is a waste of time*-purest thoughts evaporate
Dark clo8ds reveal how you feel in your idle time - your own tail becomes the 
Bait
You dont even know even though your blood flows,
Destroy yourself, your the one you hate - standing tall*-
Theyere so fragile, but they always catch you when your late... 
Cause your a broken man in a broken land,
And dont they wish they were blessed like you. 
Standing tall they look so small with your world upon* their shoulders,
But a broke n man on broken land looks far beyond his brothers... 
Break for the sun your the one, the chosen one, your time is up your time is due
Craked like a w hip from the hand of a broken man* to find out that he,s just 
Like you
But you've seen it all in your mind, youve seeen it all you built it up & they 
Made it fall
Because your killing yourself-your so fragile, but they cannot crush you if you 
Dont crawl.. 
No i'm a broken man in a broken land
Now im a broken man in a broken land... 
And dont they wish they were blessed like you
And dont they wish they were blessed like you
And dont they wish they were blessed like you
And don't theywish they were blessed like you
Adn dont they wish they were blessed like you
Dont they wisht they were
Blessed $$.
