Deafness, silence wait for me.
Like it loud, wide open loud.
Won't turn it down for anything
Never learn, let it burn
Burn my hearing, jar my brain
Never learn, let it burn
Beyond the threshold of pain
Say, I'm on the brink
Can't even think
What you say I'm unaware?
What you say I don't care.
Too loud is an idea
I can't comprehend
What you say I'm unware?
Whay you say I don't care.
