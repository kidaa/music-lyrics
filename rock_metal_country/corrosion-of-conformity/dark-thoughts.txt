Today I woke up happy.
There was something in the back
of my mind.
Creeping depression, manic and black.
No way to get my happiness back.
Dark Thoughts Misery
Dark Thoughts Self pity
Dark Thoughts There are no words
Dark Thoughts There are no words
No energy for suicide.
I'm not that far gone.
I'm caught in between.
No solutions present themselves.
Can't accept reality.
I'm caught in between.
Dull lingering feeling.
Starting at the ceiling.
Hum increases in my brain.
Ringing in my ears
Driving me
