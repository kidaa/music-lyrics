Ultimate, Desolate Condition Of Man
Laid To Waste
Born Again, Dead Again, Once Again
Take Me Out Of This Place
You're In Violation, You Cross The Line
The Line You Found Within Your Mind
And When The Process Comes Undone
You Die Alone, The Vicory's None 
Chorus
Hear The Warning, The End's Beginning
When You Break The Circle, You Have No Right To Live
Its The Breaking Of The Circle Right At The Start
Which Makes This Mother Fall Apart
In This Division Of The Law
You're Driven To The One Last Flaw 
Chorus
Heal These Wounds 
Terminal, Criminal Sedition Of Man
On Earth
Born Again, Dead Again, Once Again
Tyranny Awaits Rebirth
Greed Kills The Need And Bleeds The Lines
Now Your Brilliance No Longer Shines
Charred Remains The Way You Feel
And Still In Time These Wounds Won't Heal
Chorus
When You Kill The Mother, There Is No Other
