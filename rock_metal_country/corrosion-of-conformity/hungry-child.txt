"Looking for answers?" laughed the hungry child
"Pushing your answers leave none desired."
The hungry child worships
Spreading their cancer into unscarred brains
Damaged and unoccupied, ready to train
The hungry child worships
Powerfully twisting words he's resisting
god he's resisting
Powerfully screaming "What is life's meaning?
"We have life's meaning"
The hungry child...worships NO MORE!
