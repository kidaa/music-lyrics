Lost in a dream high and wide
Whatever price to keep it by our side
The steps to the top are very steep
King of the hill when all are fast asleep
but I'm	Stuck in between
and I know you know what I mean
What a pity...Redemption City
Broken hearts toast another round
And drink to the lost there's not a soul to be found
lonely boy says come what may
I hate to see it always end this way...
but I'm Stuck in between
and I know you know what I mean
What a pity...Redemption City
Simple words remind me
Cluttered room haunts me...come back yesterday
The soul is tired and I wanna go home
And close the curtain on everything you've known
But the curtain is high wide and long
And kills the dream, so we sing this simple song
Stuck in between
and I know you know what I mean
What a pity...Redemption City
What a pity
