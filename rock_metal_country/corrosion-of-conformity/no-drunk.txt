Need to drink to fucking think
If you'd think you wouldn't drink
Takes a man to drink so much
A real man doesn't need a crutch
Everybody tells me that it's cool
But I'll just let them play the fool
Drinking a fifth make you brave
It only takes you to an early grave
So go ahead and call me dumb
At least my fucking brains not numb
You can drink yourself to death
I'll keep the liquor off my breath
