When you live your life uptight untrusted
but their blind from the grind but only you can see
when the bones that you own have long been dusted
you realize who you're not supposed to be
I've been told things get better
Isolation grind
My life is Hazy Hazy Hazy
So I'm born again for the last time
when your life was lived fully cocked and loaded
but your soul was empty through and through
it makes me realize maybe you sold it
for the dream of a lifetime or maybe two...YEAH YOU
I've been told things get better
Isolation grind
My life is Hazy Hazy Hazy
So I'm born again for the last time
One last stand for this dying man
can we get a round of sympathy
I think it's too late he was never forward or straight
much like the one watching over me
Dizzy with greed now you've got everything you need
as you cling to the one who stands second to none
walls start to fall at the thought of it all
poorer by dawn then I was at the dawn; I'm gone...TAKE ME
I've been told things get better
Isolation grind
My life is Hazy Hazy Hazy
So I'm born again for the last time
