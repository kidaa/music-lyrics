I've got a positive outlook,
Won't get stuck
Drowning in my surroundings
Never give in never give up
Don't let them scare you
No matter what
Where are you putting your energy?
So much hate and jealousy
All hope is caving in
Patience is growing thin
Got to put it perspective
Got to see your objective
Isn't it what you expected
From something so long neglected
Be calm, be brave
Got to keep yourself alive
As pressure turns to rage
You solder your own cage
That's not for me
