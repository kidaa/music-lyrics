Because you're old and rich
You don't care about this earth
Only about your filthy profits
Poisoned Planet nuclear war
It's not you're problem anymore
The problems belong to your
generation
The consequences to mine
You've spoiled my chances and
robbed me of my time
Bodies piled in rotting heaps
Mass-destruction empty streets
Martial law declared nothing
left to rule
Death will soon come to the
surviving few
Why should we pay the consequences?
