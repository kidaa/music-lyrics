Not so long ago.
The children laughed and played.
Now they're just charred corpses
Annihilated they play no more.
When everything is contaminated
Tell me what is gained.
Tell me who has won when nothing remains?
Burned limless victims of power's abuses
The poison countryside is the result
of a short fuse.
