Burning Tree, Blackened Sky - This Land God Forsaken
A Thousand Men Prepare To Die - Their Spirit Long Been Broken
In Misery, Hear Their Cry - Mouths Hang Wide Open
Flashing Steel, Hot Lead - The White Man Has Spoken
Painted Smiling Face
Pockets Filled, Lust Fulfilled -- The Butchered Knew No Mercy
Painted Smiling Face
Blind Eyes, Closed Hearts - They Do Not Remember
Brutal Past From The Start - No Justice Now Forever
Humankind Is But A Part Yet They Find No Answer
Harmony Is The Art These Men Refuse To Master
Painted Smiling Face
Its Clear, The End Is Near - This Path Leads To Nowhere
Painted Smiling Face 
Yeah, I See You
See Right Through You
And I Hear You
But Your Words Will Never Ring True 
My Mind Is Clearer Now
At Last I Can See All Too Well
Decieving Shades Are Wearing Thin
Humankind Prefers Living In Hell 
Painted Smiling Face
