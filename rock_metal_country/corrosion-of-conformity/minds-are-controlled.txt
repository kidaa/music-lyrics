Television mass mind control
Through cathode rays beliefs
are sold.
Examples of what is correct
and what is not.
Opinions are presented as fact.
Minds are controlled
Death and war are portrayed
realistically.
As not to raise objection to
patriotic slaughter.
If they show realistic gore,
the public will ignore it.
