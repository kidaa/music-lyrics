Beginning of this world selled with mankind
Who built a tool to kill a fool and lead tthe blind
Invent a rule to keep you down &call it sin
Then stand behind the wall and watch the games begin 
Separate by class but keep the middle low
Instill the order with a border justfor show
Give them weapons and let them have their piece of mind
Then tip them off so they can kill whats not their kind 
& watch them shake like you 
If tales come true when judgements due they'll call us all liars
And put us in their hell and set our souls on fire
Remember sin your only friend he brought you through
Hallucenate with hate and watch them shake like you..
