I see the world thru blood shot eyes
Streets filled with blood from distant leis.
The dogs of war never compromise,
No time for re arranging 
"help me jesus , help me clean my wounds"
He said he cannot heal that kind
Bleeding soul becomes a bitter mind
He said it happens every time... 
Thats how the story goes
In the land of a 1000 no,s
Im all over you
In time my mind is changing. 
Black on black gives me a heart attack
And the silence makes it deadly
Some choose to kill with a simple will
I,ve seen them fall fast and steady 
Help me jesus help me clean my wounds
He said he cannot heal that kind
Buck shot through the dome makes a big
Fucking mess,
He said it happens every time... 
Knock it down 
Twist of fate wont give me a break,
& myself im slow and tired
Ive got to rise with these blood shot eyes
But i keep falling when im higher.. 
"help me jesus help me ........"
Cannot heal
Bleeding soul bitter mind
He said it happens every time. 
Thats how the story goes
In the land of a 1000 no s
We are bleeding sins but our
Sins are always fading. 
Knock it down
