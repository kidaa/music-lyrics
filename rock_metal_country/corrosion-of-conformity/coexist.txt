By my looks, by me behavior
Try to classify me, find a label
You judge me as I judge you
Won't live up to your stereotype
Won't live up to your image
You judge me as I judge you
Preconcieved picture of someone like me
You think you know my type
Preconcieved picture of someone like you
Why can't we just give it a chance?
Hate at first sight. You're not alright
I don't care about you laws.
You don't care about my cause.
