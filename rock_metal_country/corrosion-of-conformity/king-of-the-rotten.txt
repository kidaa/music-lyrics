If I was king of all the rotten
stealing filth from those forgotten
would you be my queen of this desperate land, do you give a damn?
What if I had to scold you
listen once but never tried and true
What if I had to trade you for another man, do you think I can?
I won't call on the angels no
beating on the line as I turn to amputate...
I'm bleeding on you
What if you were torn in two
what if I wanted to be like you
what if I was high like an aeroplane, would you look at me the same?
I won't call on the angels no
beating on the line as I turn to amputate...
I'm bleeding on you
If we walked side by side
would you step stab my back and kill my pride
or would you fall ahead, or would you move behind,
tell me what's unkind
Now if I was king of all the rotten
stealing filth from those forgotten
would you be my queen of this desperate land, do you think I give a damn?
I won't call on the angels no
beating on the line as I turn to amputate...
I'm bleeding on you
