Here we go again, infatuation
Touches me just when I
Thought that it would end
Oh but then again it seems
Much more than that but
I'm not sure exactly what you're thinking

Well,I toss and turn all night
Thinking of your ways of effection
But to find that it's not different at all
I throw away my past mistakes
And contemplate my future
That's when I say...
What the hey!

Would I last forever
You and I together, hand and hand
We run away far away
I'm in for nasty weather
But I'll take whatever you can
give that comes my way far away
