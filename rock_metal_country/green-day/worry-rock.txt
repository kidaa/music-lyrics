Another sentimental argument and bitter love. 
freaked without a kiss again and dragged it through the mud. 
Yelling at brick walls and punching windows made of stone. 
The worry rock has turned to dust and fallen on our pride. 

A knocked down dragged out fight. 
Fat lips and open wounds. 
Another wasted night and no one will take the fall. 

Where do we go from here 
And what did you do with the directions 
Promise me no dead end streets 
And I'll guarantee we'll have the road.
