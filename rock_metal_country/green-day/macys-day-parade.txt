Today's the Macy's Day Parade
the night of the living dead is on its way
with a credit report for duty call
it's a lifetime guarantee
stuffed in a coffin 10% more free
Red light special at the mausoleum

Give me something that I need
satisfaction guaranteed to you
what's the consolation prize
economy sized dreams of hope

when I was a kid I thought
I wanted all the things that I haven't got
oh. I learned the hardest way
Then I realized what it took
To tell the difference between
thieves and crooks
A lesson learned to me and you

Give me something that I need
Satisfaction guaranteed
Because I'm thinking about
a brand new hope
the one I've never known
cause now I know
it's all that I wanted

what's the consolation prize
economy sized dreams of hope 
Give me something that I need
Satisfaction guaranteed 
Because I'm thinking about
a brand new hope
the one I've never known
and where it goes
and I'm thinking about
the only road
the one I've never known
and where it goes

Because I'm thinking about 
a brand new hope
the one I've never known 
cause now I know
it's all that I wanted
