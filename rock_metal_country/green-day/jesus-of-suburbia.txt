[Part 1]

I'm the son of rage and love
The Jesus of suburbia 
From the bible of none of the above 
On a steady diet of soda pop and Ritalin 
No one ever died for my sins in hell 
As far as I can tell 
At least the ones I got away with 

And there's nothing wrong with me 
This is how I'm supposed to be 
In a land of make believe 
That don't believe in me

Get my television fix sitting on my crucifix 
The living room or my private womb 
While the moms and brads are away 
To fall in love and fall in debt 
To alcohol and cigarettes and Mary Jane 
To keep me insane and doing someone else's cocaine

And there's nothing wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be
In a land of make believe
That don't believe in me

[Part 2: City Of The Damned]

At the center of the Earth
In the parking lot 
Of the 7-11 were I was taught 
The motto was just a lie 
It says home is where your heart is
But what a shame 
Cause everyone's heart 
Doesn't beat the same 
It's beating out of time 

City of the dead 
At the end of another lost highway 
Signs misleading to nowhere 
City of the damned 
Lost children with dirty faces today 
No one really seems to care 

I read the graffiti 
In the bathroom stall 
Like the holy scriptures of a shopping mall 
And so it seemed to confess 
It didn't say much 
But it only confirmed that
The center of the earth 
Is the end of the world 
And I could really care less 

City of the dead
At the end of another lost highway
Signs misleading to nowhere
City of the damned
Lost children with dirty faces today
No one really seems to careeeeee

[Part 3: I don't care]

I don't care if you don't 
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care
[x4]

I don't careeeeeeeeee

Everyone is so full of shit 
Born and raised by hypocrites 
Hearts recycled but never saved
From the cradle to the grave 
We are the kids of war and peace
From Anaheim to the middle east 
We are the stories and disciples 
Of the Jesus of suburbia 
Land of make believe 
And it don't believe in me 
Land of make believe 
And I don't believe 
And I don't care! 
I don't care! [x4]

[Part 4: Dearly beloved]

Dearly beloved are you listening?
I can't remember a word that you were saying
Are we demented or am I disturbed? 
The space that's in between insane and insecure 
Oh therapy, can you please fill the void? 
Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed 
Nobody's perfect and I stand accused 
For lack of a better word, and that's my best excuse 

[Part 5: Tales of another broken home]

To live and not to breathe 
Is to die In tragedy
To run, to run away 
To find what you believe 
And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies 
I lost my faith to this 
This town that don't exist

So I run 
I run away
To the light of masochist
And I leave behind 
This hurricane of fucking lies
And I walked this line 
A million and one fucking times
But not this time

I don't feel any shame
I won't apologize 

When there ain't nowhere you can go
Running away from pain
When you've been victimized
Tales from another broken home

You're leaving...
You're leaving...
You're leaving...
Ah you're leaving home...
