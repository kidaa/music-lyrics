So tired, tired of waiting, tired of waiting for you.
So tired, tired of waiting, tired of waiting for you.
I was a lonely soul, I had nobody 'till I met you.
But you, keeping me waiting, all of the time
What can I do

It's your life, and you can do what you wanna do.
Do what you like, but please don't keep me waitin'
Please don't keep me waitin',
Cuz im so tired, tired of waiting, tired of waiting for you.
So tired, tired of waiting, tired of waiting for you.
I was a lonely soul, I had nobody 'till I met you.
But you, keeping me waiting, all of the time
What can I do

It's your life, and you can do what you wanna do.
Do what you like, but please don't keep me waitin'.
Please don't keep me waitin'.

Cuz im so tired, tired of waiting, tired of waiting for you.
So tired, tired of waiting, tired of waiting for you.
For you
For you
