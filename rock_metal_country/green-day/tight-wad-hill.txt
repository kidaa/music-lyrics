Cheapskate on the hill 
A thrill seeker making deals 
Suger city urchin wasting time 
Town of lunatics 
Begging for another fix 
Turning tricks for speedballs one more night 

Making your rounds once again 
Turning and empty handed 
Bumming a ride 
Burning day light 
Last up at down 
Tight Wad Hill 

Drugstore hooligan 
Another white trash mannequin 
On display to rot up on the hill 
Living out a lie 
But having the time of his life 
Hating every minute of his existence
