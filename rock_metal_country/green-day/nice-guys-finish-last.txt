Nice guys finish last. 
You're running out of gas. 
Your sympathy will get you left behind. 
Sometimes you're at your best, when you look the worst. 
Do you feel washed up, like piss going down the drain 

Pressure cooker pick my brain and tell me I'm insane. 
I'm so freaking happy I could cry. 
Every joke can have its truth and now the joke's on you. 
I never knew you were such a funny guy. 

Oh nice guys finish last, when you are the outcast. 
Don't pat yourself on the back, you might break your spine. 

Living on command. 
You're shaking lots of hands. 
Kissing up and bleeding all your trust, taking what you need. 
Bit the hand that feeds. 
You kill your memory
