I'm on a sentimental journey
Into sight and sound
Of no return and no looking back or down
A conscientes objector to the
War that's my mind
Leaving in the lurch and I'm
Taking back what's mine

I'm on a mission
Into destination unkown
An expidition
Onto desolation road
Where I'm a...

Castaway - going at it alone
Castaway - now I'm on my own
Castaway - going at it alone
Castaway - now I'm on my own
Lost and found, trouble bound
Castaway

I'm riding on the night train and
Driving stolen cars
Testing my nerves out of the blvd.
Spontaneous combustion in the
Corners of my mind
Leaving in the lurch
And I'm taking back what's mine

I'm on a mission
Into destination unkown
An expidition
Onto desolation road
Where I'm a...

Castaway - going at it alone
Castaway - now I'm on my own
Castaway - going at it alone
Castaway - now I'm on my own
Lost and found, trouble bound
Castaway
