Looking at the clouds in the sky
floating image in my mind
Now I wonder where this place is from

Evidence is everywhere
I start to run, now I'm scared
Strange beings all around.
Everyone come to this place I've found

I'm feeling phyced
walking wonder why
All my joys are open
No more crimes

My eyes are clear and now I'm cured
I only wanna be for sure

Get in my mind and you will find
Mother love from all mankind
