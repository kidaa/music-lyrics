She...
She screams in silence
A sullen riot penetrating through her mind
We...
Wait for a sign
To smash the silence with the brick of self-control

Are you locked up in a world
Thats been planned out for you
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use

Scream at me until my ears bleed
I'm taking heed just for you

She...
She's figured out
All her doubts were someone else's point of view
We...
Walking up this time
To smash the silence with the brick of self-control

Are you locked up in a world
Thats been planned out for you
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use

Scream at me until my ears bleed
I'm taking heed just for you

EHHHHHH,AHHHHHHHHHH!!!

Are you locked up in a world
Thats been planned out for you
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use

Scream at me until my ears bleed
I'm taking heed just for you
