I'm all busted up
Broken bones and nasty cuts
ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
But this time I can't get up
She comes to check on me
MAKING sure I'm on my knees
After all she's the one
Who put me in this STATE

Is she ULTRA-VIOLENT
Is she DISTURBED
I better tell her that I LOVE her
Before she does it all over again
OH GOD,SHE'S KILLING ME!!!

For now I'll lie around
heck, that's all I can really do
She takes good care of me
Just keep saying my LOVE is TRUE

Is she ULTRA-VIOLENT
Is she DISTURBED
I better tell her that I LOVE her
Before she does it all over again
OH GOD,SHE'S KILLING ME!!!

Looking out my window for
Someone that's passing by
No one knows I'm LOCKED in here
All I do is cry

For now I'll lie around
heck, that's all I can really do
She takes good care of me
Just keep saying my LOVE is TRUE
