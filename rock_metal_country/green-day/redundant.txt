We're living in repetition. 
Content in the same old shtick again. 
Now the routine's turning to contention, 
Like a production line going over and over and over, roller 
coaster. 

Now I cannot speak, I lost my voice. 
I'm speechless and redundant. 
'Cause I love you's not enough. 
I'm lost for words. 

Choreographed and lack of passion. 
Prototypes of what we were. 
Went full circle 'til I'm nauseous. 
Taken for granted now. 
Now I waste it, faked it, ate it, now i hate it. 

Now I cannot speak, I lost my voice. 
I'm speechless and redundant, 'cause I love you's not enough. 
I'm lost for words, now I cannot speak.
