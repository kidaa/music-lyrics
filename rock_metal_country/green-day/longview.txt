Sit around and watch the tube,but nothing's on
Change the channels for an hour or two
Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
I'm sick of all the same old shoot
In a house with unlocked doors
And I'm freaking lazy

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so darn bored I'm going BLIND!!!
And I smell like shoot

Peel me off this velcro seat and get me moving
I sure as heck can't do it by myself
I'm feeling like a DOG IN HEAT
Barred indoors from the summer street
I locked the door to MY OWN CELL
And I lost the key

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so darn bored I'm going BLIND!!!
And I smell like shoot

I GOT NO MOTIVATION
WHERE IS MY MOTIVATION
NO TIME FOR THE MOTIVATION
SMOKING MY INSPIRATION

Sit around and watch the phone,but no one's calling
Call me pathetic,call me WHAT YOU WILL
My mother says to get a job
But she don't like the one SHE'S got
When masturbation's lost its fun
You're freaking lazy

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so darn BORED
I'm going blind
And loneliness has to suffice
Bite my lip and close my eyes
I was slipping away to paradise
Some say,"Quit or I'll go BLIND."
But it's just a myth
