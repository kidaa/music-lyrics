Stranded...lost inside myself
My own worst friend
My own closest enemy
I'm Branded...maladjusted
Never trusted anyone
Let alone myself

I must insist
On being a pessimist
I'm a loner in a catastrophic mind

Elected the rejected
I perfected the science of the idiot
No meaning...no healing
Self loathing freak and introverted deviot

I must insist
On being a pessimist
I'm a loner in a catastrophic mind

Stranded...lost inside myself
My own worst friend
My own closest enemy
Elected the rejected
I perfected the science of the idiot

I must insist
On being a pessimist
I'm a loner in a catastrophic mind

I'm gettin' pisst
I'm a worthless pessimist
I'm a loner in a catastrophic mind
