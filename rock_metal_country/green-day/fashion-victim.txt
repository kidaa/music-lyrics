He's a victim of his own time
In his "vintage suit" and tie
He's casualty dressed to the teeth
In the latest genocide
The new seasons come and go
At the dog and pony show
Gonna sit and beg and fetch the names
And fallow the dress codes
WHAT'S IN A NAME...HEY!

She's a scented magazine
Looking sharp and living clean
Living well and dressed to kill
But she looks like hell to me

So when you're dancing throgh your wardrope
Do the anorex - a go-go
Cloaked with style
For pedophiles as the credit card explodes

You auctioned off your life
For the "most" expensive price
Going once...
Going twice...
Now it's gone

You the Crew

You auctioned off your life
For the "most" expensive price
Going once...
Going twice...
Now it's gone

What's in a name, hey
What's in a name, hey
What's in a name
