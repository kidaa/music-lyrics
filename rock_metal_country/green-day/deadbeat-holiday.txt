Wake up, The house is on fire 
And the cat's caught in the dryer 
Philosophy's a liar when 
Your home is your headstone 
"Icon" is the last chance for hope 
When there's no such thing as heroes 
Your faith lies in the ditch that 
You dug yourself in 

Last chance to piss it all away 
Nothing but hell to pay 
When the lights are going down 

Deadbeat Holiday - celebrate your own decay 
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high 
On a noose over your home 

Deadbeat Holiday - get on your knees and pray 
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high 
But at least you're not alone 
Christmas lights in the middle of August 
Grudges come back to haunt us 
Your oldest allies are your long lost enemies 
Grounded in a duplex to find that 
You're living on a landmine 
Vacation hotspots is a cemetery drive 

Last chance to piss it all away 
Nothing but hell to pay 
When the lights are going down 

Deadbeat Holiday - celebrate your own decay 
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high 
On a noose over your home 

Deadbeat Holiday - get on your knees and pray 
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high 
But at least you're not alone 

Last chance to piss it all away 
Nothing but hell to pay when all you 
Want to do is...not to....give up......
