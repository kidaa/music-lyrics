Virginia was a "lot lizard" from F.L.A.
She had a compound fracture in the "trunk"
It started when she run away
Thumbs out out on the interstate
She hitched a ride to misery

"Mr. Whirly" had a catastrophic incident
He fell into the city by the bay
He liquidated his estate
Now he sleeps upon the Haight
Panhanding misery

He's gonna get high
When he's low
The fire burns from better days
And she screems why
I said I don't know
The catastrophic hymnes from yesterday
Of misery

Vinnie was a hustler out of Amsterdam
He ran the drug cartel in "tinseltown"
They found him in a cadillac
Bludgeoned with a baseball bat in the name
Of misery

Gina hit the road to New York City
Mysteriously the night Vinnie croaked
She stopped in Vegas to elope
With Virgina and the dope
And kissed the bride eternally

And they're gonna get high
When they're low
The fire burns from better days
And he screems why
I said I don't know
The catastrophic hymnes from yesterday
Of misery

Hell hounds on your trail now once again..boy
It's groping on your leg until it sleeps
The emptiness will fill your soul with sorrow
Because it's not what ypu make,,,,it's what you leave

And we're gonna get high
When I'm low
The fire burns from better days
And she screems why
I said I don't know
The catastrophic hymnes from yesterday
Of misery
