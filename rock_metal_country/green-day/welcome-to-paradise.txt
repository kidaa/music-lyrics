Dear mother, can you hear me whining
It's been three whole weeks since I have left your home
This sudden fear has left me trembling
'Cause now it seems that I am out here on my own
And I'm feeling so alone

Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
Some call it slums and some call it nice
I want to take you through the waste land
That I like to call my home
Welcome to paradise

A gunshot rings out at the station
Another urchin snaps and left dead on his own
It makes me wonder why I'm still here
For some strange reasons it's now feeling like my home
And I'm never gonna go

Dear mother, can you hear me laughing
It's been six whole months since I have left your home
It makes me wonder why I'm still here
For some strange reason it's now feeling like my home
And I'm never gonna go
