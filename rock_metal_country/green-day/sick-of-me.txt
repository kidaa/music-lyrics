Why can't you just admit it, you've had it, you're 
sick of me
You're fed up with all my bad habits, you're 
sick of me
To your lies you've become so desensitized 
sick of me
Lost regrets and you say that your mad at me 
sick of me
Wonderin' out the door
I am on to you
Your comin' back for more
Am I losing you
Like a dog that just pissed on your barbecue 
sick of me
Losin' faith and you still don't know what to do 
sick of me
Losin' health and now you hate everything and you're 
sick of me
It's a waste but we still keep on tryin' you're 
sick of me
Wonderin' out the door
I am on to you
Your comin' back for more
Am I losing you
So you got your problems
So you got it alright
Do you have a conscience
Do you have a reason
Well I'm sick of you too.
Wonderin' out the door
I am on to you
Your comin' back for more
Am I losing you
