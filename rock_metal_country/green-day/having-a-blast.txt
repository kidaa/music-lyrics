I'm taking all you down with me
Explosives duct taped to my spine
Nothings gonna change my mind

I won't listen to anyone's last words
There's nothing left for you to say
Soon you'll be dead anyway

No one here is getting out alive
This time I've really lost my mind and I don't care
So close your eyes
And kiss yourself goodbye
And think about the times you spent and what they've ment
To me its nothing...

I'm losing all my happiness
The happiness YOU pinned on me
Loneliness still comforts me

My anger DWELLS inside of me
I'm taking it all out on you
And all the shoot you put me through

No one here is getting out alive
This time I've really lost my mind and I don't care
So close your eyes
And kiss yourself goodbye
And think about the times you spent and what they've ment
To me its nothing...

Do you ever thing back to another time
Does it bring you so down that you thought you lost you're mind
Do you ever want to lead a long trail of destruction
and mow down any BULLSHIT that comfronts you
Do you ever build up all the small things in your head
To make one problem that adds up to NOTHING
To me its nothing...
