I was a young boy that had big plans. 
Now I'm just another shootty old man. 
I don't have fun and I hate everything. 
The world owes me, so freak you. 

Glory days don't mean shoot to me. 
I drank a six pack of apathy. 
Life's a bitch and so am I. 
The world owes me, so freak you. 

Wasted youth and a fustful of ideals. 
I had a young and optimisitic point of view. 
Wasted youth and a fustful of ideals. 
I had a young and optimisitic point of view. 

I've decomposed, yet my gut's getting fat. 
Oh my god I'm turning out like my dad. 
I'm just a grouch sitting on the couch. 
The world owes me, so freak you. 

The wife's a nag and the kid's freaking up. 
I don't have sex `cause i can't get it up. 
I'm always rude. 
I've got a bad attitude. 
The world owes, so freak you.
