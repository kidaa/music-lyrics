[VERSE 1:]
This is a public service anouncement, this is only a test
Emergency evacuation process
May Impair your ability to operate machinery
Can't quite tell just what it means to me
Keep out of reach of children, don't you talk to strangers
Get your philoshophy from a bumper sticker

[CHORUS:]
Warning. Live without warning
Say warning. Live without warning
Without. Alright.

[VERSE 2:]
Better homes and safety self communities.
Did you remember to the pay the utility
Caution Police Line You Better Not Cross!
Is it the cop, or am I the one thats really dangerous
Sanitation, expiration date, question everything.
Or shut up and be a victim of authority

[CHORUS:]
Warning. Live without warning
Say warning. Live without warning
Say warning. Live without warning
Say warning. Live without warning
Without. Alright.

[VERSE 3:]
Better homes and saftey shelf communities.
Did you remember to pay the pay the utility
Caution Police Line You Better Not Cross!
Is it the cop, or am I the one that's really dangerous
Sanitation, expiration date, question everything.
Or shut up and be a victim of authority

[CHORUS:]
Warning. Live without warning
Say warning. Live without warning
Say warning. Live without warning
Say warning. Live without warning
