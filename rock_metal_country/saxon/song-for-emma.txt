Emma stands alone tonight
Staring at the stars
Trying to find the reason why
Her world was torn apart
She's sick and tired of trying to keep
The wolves back from the door

She couldn't stand the pain
Tried to come in from the rain
She was a victim of her heart
Is there no one to blame

What happened to the dreams she had
Visions of her life
Now they're only shadows
Fading in the night
She's given up believing
Turned her back and slammed the doorShe couldn't stand the pain
Tried to come in from the rain
She was a victim of her heart
Is there no one to blame
No one to blame
No one to blame
No one to blame

Emma weeps alone tonight
Passion was her crime
No one hears her cry for help
Her back's against the wall
She's standing on the very edge
She's waiting for the fall

She couldn't stand the pain
Tried to come in from the rain
She was a victim of her heart
Victim of her heart

She couldn't stand the pain
Tried to come in from the rain
She was a victim of her heart
Is there no one to blame
