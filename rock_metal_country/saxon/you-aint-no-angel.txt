Who's that girl with her pants on fire?
You can feel the heat when you're standing by her
You look so good with your dress real tight
Does your mother know you're out tonight?
You're just sixteen you're on the loose
Your innocence is no excuse

Your mother thinks you're sweetness
You're Daddy's little girl
You may have been made in Heaven
But you ain't no angel
You ain't no angel

You're coming on strong, you're coming on heavy
Wanna mess with the boys in the back of the Chevy?
Let's take a ride, be my back seat lover
You taste so good, you're just like sugar
Now hold on baby, make it last
Does your Daddy know you're learning fast?Your mother thinks you're sweetness
You're Daddy's little girl
Were you made in Heaven?
'Cos you ain't no angel
You ain't no angel

You ain't no angel
You ain't no angel

Hi boys
What are ya doin' ?
Going for a ride ?
Can I come ?
No, my mother won't mind
I ain't no angel

You ain't no angel
