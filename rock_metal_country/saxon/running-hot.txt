Catch me if you can and tame the beast
Should I leave you burning in the heat
Kick the throttle down, I'm on fire
It turns me on the feel the engine's beat

Take it to the highway
On the open road
I want to feel your power
Screaming into overload
She's running hot
She's hotComing out of nowhere, moving fast
I gotta keep the feeling
Make it last
Let me feel your body
I'll explode
Together we will run to overload

Take it to the highway
On the open road
I want to feel your power
Screaming into overload
She's running hot
She's hot

She's running hot
She's hot
Repeat to end
