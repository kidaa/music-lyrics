Does this town know how to rock

This town knows how to rock
This town knows how to rock
This town knows how to rock
This town knows how to rock

We're gonna Saxonize
You're gonna vandalize your soul
It does no good to sit there
Stand up and rock 'n' roll
We know what your doin' here
We'll start a ballroom blitz
So come on down and rock with us
We'll blow this town to bitsWell I ain't seen a crowd like this
Since nineteen seventy four
I wanna see you rock tonight
We're gonna lock the doors, yaya
This town knows how to rock
This town knows how to rock
This town knows how to rock
This town knows how to rock

I've walked the streets of London
And I've been to Tokyo
I've seen the Coliseum
And I've grasped the Berlin wall
I've heard the bands of Scotland
I've seen the Alpine snow
I've crossed the Mississippi
I've touched the Alamo

Well I ain't seen a crowd like this
Since nineteen seventy four
I wanna see you rock tonight
We're gonna lock the doors, yaya
This town knows how to rock
This town knows how to rock
This town knows how to rock
This town...

This town knows how to rock
This town knows how to rock
This town knows how to rock
This town...
Does this town know how to rock
