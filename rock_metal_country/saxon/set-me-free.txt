Gagged, balled and chained
Feels just the same
Hands on the wall
Maybe you're just playin' games
Set me free

Mauled by a hound
Hangin' around
Is this for real
I don't know when I'll be found
Set me free

Set me free
Set me free from you

Taken by force
By you of course
Far from my bed
I know I'd rather be dead
Set me free

Set me free
Set me free from you

Fire in my brain
Burn me insane
Making your mark
Don't leave me here in the dark
Set me free

Call me a Saint
That's what I ain't
Inside my head
Maybe I'd feel better dead
Set me free

Set me free
Set me free from you

Set me free
