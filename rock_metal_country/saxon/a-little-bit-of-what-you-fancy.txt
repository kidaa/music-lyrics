When I hit the ground, I was on the run
I was born the seventh son the seventh son
I came up fast, just wanting more
Always running from the law from the law
My father said, now slow down son
Life for you has just began that's what he said

A little bit of what you fancy always does you good
A little bit of what you fancy always does you good

Don't stop me now, I'm running wild
I've always been a restless child a restless child
I was born to rock 'n' roll
Mmm, it's in my soul it's in my soul
I've got my Ford, she's long and black
Who needs a fucking Cadillac who needs it

A little bit of what you fancy always does you good
A little bit of what you fancy always does you good

I sleep all day and I'm up all night
I don't get paid, but that's alright I said that's alright
Don't put me down, I've had enough
I'll stand and fight I said I'll stand and fight
When I hit the ground I was on the run
I was born the seventh son

A little bit of what you fancy always does you good
A little bit of what you fancy always does you good

A little bit of what you fancy always does you good
A little bit of what you fancy always does you good
