I'll climb the tallest mountain
I'll swim the deepest sea
I'll do anything, baby
Anything to set you free
If you're lost and I can't find you
Somewhere in the night
If you need me there beside you
To make you feel alright
You're standing in the darkness
I can show you light
Nothing stands between us
That love can't make right

And I'll do it all for you
Yes I'll do it all, I'll do it all for you

When your world is full of sadness
And the feeling goes on and on and on
You know I'll be there
If you're standing on the ledge
And scared of looking down
I'll be there to catch you, if you fall
If you're trapped inside your heartache
And you can't find escape
Come with me and break away
It don't matter what they say

And I'll do it all for you
Yes I'll do it all for you

You know I'll do it all for you, baby
I'll do it all, do it all for you

You know I'll do it all for you, baby
I'll do it all, do it all for you
