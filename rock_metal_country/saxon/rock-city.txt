We've been a long time comin'
But we're here at last

You want it, we got it
You want it, we got it

Drive time, prime time
You're time, my time
You better get ready, ready to rock
rock city, rock city

DJ, VJ
Radio, Video
Crank it up Mama, the time is right
rock city, rock city

AM, FM
It's your choice
Looking for the rockshow, make some noise
rock city, rock city
Play some crazy rock 'n' roll
Don't stop now, just give me moreYou want it, we got it
You want it, we got it

Nightlife, streetlife
My life, your life
Rockin' the airwaves, all night long
rock city, rock city

Hi-fi, Sci-fi
Hear my words
We've been a long time coming
But we're here at last
rock city, rock city

Dream out, scream out
Jam out, rock out
I hear the guitars screaming in my head
rock city, rock city
Play some crazy rock 'n' roll
Don't stop now, just give me more

You want it, we got it
Rock City

You want it, we got it
Rock City
