Life keeps kicking you down
But you come back for more
You take all the knocks
Pick yourself up off the floor
Everyone's looking for someone
To hold in the night
Believe in yourself, stand tall
And take up the fight

We are strong
We will survive
We are strong
We will survive

Somebody gets all the breaks
But it's never you
Maybe today is the day
You'll pull through
Everyone's chasing their dream
At the end of the rainbow
You gotta follow your heart
That's where you have to goWe are strong
We will survive
We are strong
We will survive

Battered and torn
Ride out the storm
Break through the clouds of night
And head on home

Life keeps kicking you down
But you come back for more
You take all the knocks
Pick yourself up off the floor
Everyone's looking for someone
To hold in the night
Believe in yourself, stand tall
And take up the fight

We are strong
We will survive
We are strong
We will survive
