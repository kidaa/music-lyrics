I got my big twin rollin thumping out a tune
Following the headlight coming back to you
I dont need no big jet liner dont need no limousine
All Ive gots my pair of whells satisfaction guaranteed

Chorus
Im on my way Im coming home
Im on my way Im coming home

Thunder down the highway keeping up the pace
Six hundred miles before until I see your face
Gasoline and metal hammer through the night
Eating up the freeway makes me feel alright

Chorus
Guitar solo

Polished steel and leather the rumbling of the pair
Hear the carburettors sucking in the air
Sat around the engine vibrating every bone
Keeping it together blasting my way home !

Chorus
Guitar solo
