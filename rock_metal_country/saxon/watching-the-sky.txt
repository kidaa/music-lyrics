Ever since I was a young boy 
I turned towards the sky
I know there's something out there
A message in the stars
When the night is black
And the dark is dark
I stand and watch your lights
I long to be there with you
And join you in your flights

I've been watching the sky
Waiting for you
I've been watching the sky
Calling to you

I wrote off to the government
For I got no reply
They tell us there's no cover up
But I don't believe their lies
Fifty billion planets
There's gotta be some life
Don't tell me I'm the only one
Standing in the night

I've been watching the sky
Waiting for you
I've been watching the sky
Calling to youI've been watching the sky
Waiting for you
I've been watching the sky
Calling to you

Ever since I was a young boy 
I turned towards the sky
I know there's something out there
A message in the stars
When the night is black
And the dark is dark
I stand and watch your lights
I long to be there with you
And join you in your flights

I've been watching the sky
Waiting for you
I've been watching the sky
Calling to you

I've been watching the sky
Waiting for you
I've been watching the sky
Calling to you

I've been watching
Watching the sky
I've been watching the sky
Waiting for you
I've been watching the sky
Waiting for you
