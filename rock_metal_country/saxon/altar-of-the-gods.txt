Written By : Carter

Come from the woods
Out of the hills
Come from the cities
Down from the moors
Make your way down the golden path
To stand free for the temple

Power is the name
To stay on top your reign
Money rules the game
The winner takes the gain

Come smash the old
Come cut the land
Come carve the stone
Come forge the steel
From out of desolation rise
The symbols of your power  Your towers of steel stand proud
  Cathedrals of a new age
  Let all with greed come worship here
  At the altar of the Gods

Power is the name
To stay on top your reign
Money rules the game
The winner takes the gain

Wall street crash
Financial sting
Live for the dollar
Profit the share
The shame of generations past
Reflected in the city

Power is the name
To stay on top your reign
Money rules the game
The winner takes the gain
