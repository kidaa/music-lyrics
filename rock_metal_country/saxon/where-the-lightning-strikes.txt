Traveling down life's highway
We carry the heavy load
Where will we be, be tomorrow
Somewhere down the road
We won't forget the friends
We made along the way
Soon we'll be together
Together one fine day

Where the lightning strikes
Is where we're gonna be
Stood on the edge of tomorrow
There waits our destiny

I hear the sound of rolling thunder
The beating of a drum
There's many been, been before us
There's many yet to come
We see the day
The new day dawning
It's just begun
We march into the future
Towards the rising sunSee the light,
 hear the thunder,
 the new day

Beyond the wide, the wide horizon
There's many paths to tread
A journey filled, filled with wonder
Is waiting just ahead

Where the lightning strikes
Is where we're gonna be
Stood on the edge of tomorrow
There waits our destiny

Where the lightning strikes
Is where we're gonna be
Stood on the edge of tomorrow
There waits our destiny
