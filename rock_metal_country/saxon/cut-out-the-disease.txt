You make your living from backstabbing
You're just a snake in hand made boots
You slither round like something slimy
Nothing's ever what it seems

Cut out the disease
The lies and deceit
Cut out the disease
The lies and deceit

You circle around just like a vulture
You're waiting for your piece of meat
Beneath your charm there's something hiding
The way you spin your vicious web

Cut out the disease
The lies and deceit
Cut out the disease
The lies and deceit

We did it all - we did it all for you
Did it all - we did it all for youOnce, you were our friend
But you betrayed us in the end

Confrontation was your weakness
Evil lies behind that smile
You slither round like something slimy
You're just a snake in handmade boots

Cut out the disease
The lies and deceit
Cut out the disease
The lies and deceit

Cut out the disease
The lies and deceit
Cut out the disease
The lies and deceit

Once, you were our friend
But you betrayed us in the end
