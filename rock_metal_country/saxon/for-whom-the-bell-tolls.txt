A city divided
The West and the East
Tear down the walls
Give them release
People are marching
They're out in the streets
Shouting for freedom
Shouting for peace

How many more children
Must die on the wall
They'll never be free
Until the bell tollsThe toll of the bell
Is Liberty's song
A city united
Is where they belong
A push of the button
And everything's gone
Total destruction
Comes with the bomb

How many more children
Must die on the wall
They'll never be free
Until the bell tolls

How many more children
Must die on the wall
They'll never be free
