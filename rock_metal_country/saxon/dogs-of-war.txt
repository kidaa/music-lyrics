Come to the reaper sing the song bringing death to everyone
Once the earth was calm and safe but now the lands a battle place
Firing shells into the air where they land no one cares
Now the blood flows like a stream widowmaker reigns supreme

Chorus
Dogs of war
No surrender
Dogs of war
I kill the defender
Dogs of war
Scream in to battle
Dogs of war
Its the day of Jackal

Nothing seems to ease the pain the reapers shadow still remains
Sniper lets the bullet fly in the distance someone die
The down becomes an empty shell come and spend a day in hell
Forgotten what were fighting for no one wins this bloody war

Chorus
Guitar solo

Lay the wreath across the flag fill another body bag
Guard of honour standing proud put your son in to the ground
Did they die for you and me a sacrifice for liberty
A generation dead and gone the reaper sings his deadly song

Chorus repeat
