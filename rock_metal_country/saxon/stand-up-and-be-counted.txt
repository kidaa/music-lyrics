Down, down at the bottom
Ya gotta try to get yourselves up
Ya got nothing to lose when your there
There at the bottom
Ya gotta stand up
Stand up for your rights

We can make it
You can break it
Stand up
Stand up be counted

Out, out in the spotlight
Ya gotta leave, leave your worries behind
Ya got nothing to lose when your there
You be forgotten
Well I'll be damning out lives
While the damn us in hell 

We can make it
You can break it
Stand up
Stand up be countedWe can make it
We can break it
Stand up
Stand up be counted

Down, down at the bottom
Ya gotta leave all your worries behind
Ya got nothing to lose when you're there
There at the bottom
Ya gotta stand up
Stand up for your rights

We can make it
You can break it
Stand up
Stand up be counted

Stand up, stand up!
