We didn't come for their sympathy
We didn't come for their soul
We didn't come for their bigotry
We didn't come for their gold
We never said we were perfect
We'll lay it on the line
They can stick their censorship
Where the sun don't shine

We came here to rock
We came here to rock
We came here to rock
We came here to rock

We didn't come for their apathy
We didn't come for their lies
We didn't come for their strategy
We didn't come for their wives
Don't tell us how to run our lives
We know what's right and what's wrong
They're just a bunch hypocrites
We came for one thing aloneWe came here to rock
We came here to rock
We came here to rock
We came here to rock came here to rock

We didn't come for bureaucracy
We didn't come for their views
We don't need their mentality
We don't need their abuse
We've never worshipped the devil
That's just another lie
We just wanna have some fun
Some fun before we die

We came here to rock
We came here to rock
We came here to rock
We came here to rock

Repeat to end
