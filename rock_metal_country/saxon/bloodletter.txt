You never see him out in the sunlight
He's waiting for the shadows to fall
Moving under cover of darkness
Searching for a victim to maul
Lock up your doors so tightly
Keep all your windows shut
'Cause on this night the blood will flow
Flow before the dawn

In the night wrap up tight
Vampire strikes
Bloodletter

Roaming in the valley of darkness
Never moving far from the grave
Waiting at the edge of your nightmare
Seeking out the blood that he craves
So if your hear a tap on your window
You know that your time has come
On this night the blood will flow
Flow before the dawn

In the night wrap up tight
Vampires bite
Bloodletter, bloodletter

In the night wrap up tight
Vampire strikes
Bloodletter, bloodletter

Scream in the night
Keep out of sightYou never see him out in the sunlight
He's waiting for the shadows to fall
Moving under cover of darkness
Searching for a victim to maul
Lock up your doors so tightly
Keep all your windows shut
'Cause on this night the blood will flow
Flow before the dawn

In the night wrap up tight
Vampire strikes
Bloodletter, bloodletter

Bloodletter

In the night wrap up tight
Vampire strikes
Bloodletter, bloodletter

In the night wrap up tight
Vampire strikes
Bloodletter, bloodletter

Bloodletter
Bloodletter
Bloodletter
