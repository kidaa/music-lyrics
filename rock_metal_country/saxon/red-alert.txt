We were on the Russian border
When the news began to break
Of a nuclear reactor melting down
Sending deadly clouds of dust
Into the atmosphere
Falling down like rain on the ground

We were laying in the sun
Listening to the radio
When someone said you'd better get inside
We didn't know how serious
The situation was
That many people to the North had died

Red alert, red alert
Screaming in my head
There is something I'm not sure of
Going down
Red alert, red alert
Screaming in the night
That fallout seems to follow me around

We made our way to Hungary
Got ready for the storm
Thinking we were safe there
From the storm
But the deadly cloud was high above
Taken by the wind
Spreading like a plague across the land
A threat you couldn't see
Nothing you could feel
But something evil floating in the airLook towards the East
The danger yet to come
For the Earth
We make a silent prayer

Red alert, red alert
Screaming in my head
There is something I'm not sure of
Going down
Red alert, red alert
Screaming in the night
That fallout seems to follow me around

We were on the Russian border
When the news began to break
Of a nuclear reactor melting down

Red alert, red alert
Screaming in my head
There is something I'm not sure of
Going down
Red alert, red alert
Screaming in the night
That fallout seems to follow me around
