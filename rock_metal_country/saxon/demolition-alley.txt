Ive been working all day down on demolition alley
Looking down the barrel of a twelve gauge gun
Digging up rocks in this God forsaken valley
Breaking my back in the mid day sun

Chorus
I served my time I lost my wind
On demolition alley
Demolition alley

Days go by but it feels like a lifetime
Dragging me down like a ball and chain
Doing my time just walking in a straight line
Its the only thing I know just to handle my painChorus
Guitar solo

One of these days Im just gonna have to break free
Taking my chances living on the run
Theres only one man that can ever really stop me
Hes looking down the barrel of that twelve gauge gun

Chorus
Guitar solo
