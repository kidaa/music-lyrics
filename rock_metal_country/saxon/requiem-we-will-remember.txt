Somewhere in the night a candle burns for you
The eternal flame the light keeps shining on
Your music is immortal it stood the test of time
You're gone but not forgotten, you walk with us

We will remember
They were born to rock 'n' roll
We will remember
Woah-oh

This song's a celebration of what you gave to us
The legacy you left still marches on
But still they play your music all around the world
Blasting through the airwaves to the stars

We will remember
They were born to rock 'n' roll
We will remember
Woah-oh

From London to Chicago
From the mountains to the sea
The legacy you left will never dieWe will remember
They were born to rock 'n' roll
We will remember
Woah-oh

We will remember
They were born to rock 'n' roll
We will remember
Woah-oh

From London to Chicago
From the mountains to the sea

We will remember
They were born to rock 'n' roll
We will remember
Woah-oh
