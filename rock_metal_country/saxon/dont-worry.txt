Im leaving this town Im out of the race
Im packing my bags I aint gonna stay
I cant stand the pressure building on me
Dont try to stop me Ive got to break free

Chorus
Take me down to the cool clear water
Dont worry about me
Take my time stay a while
Dont have to worry about a thing
Dont you know
Im going down to the cool clear water
Dont worry about me
I take my time Ill stay a while
Dont have to worry about a thing

They tell you the truth but you know its a lie
Big brother is watching the eye in the sky
Just take your freedom and throw it away
Cause sooner or later were all going to payChorus
Guitar solo

Theyre taxing the rain the water we drink
Just do as youre told theres no time to think
We shouldnt forget what we learnt from the past
Stop looking at life through rose coloured glass

Chorus repeat
Guitar solo
