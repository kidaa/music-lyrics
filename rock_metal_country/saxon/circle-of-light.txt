You're far outside your body now
Looking down you see yourself below
Standing on the precipice
You could be leaving soon
The life you know
Waiting for your guardian
To take you up towards the astro plane

Follow me walking to the circle of light
Follow me this could be the end of your life
Follow me

Floating there above yourself
You watch the doctors try to save your life
Will you live or will you die
Your fate depends upon the surgeon's knife
Detached from all reality
You let yourself be pulled towards the lightFollow me walking to the circle of light
Follow me this could be the end of your life
Follow me, follow me, follow me

You listen to the voices now
They tell you that its not your time to leave
Then suddenly you feel the pain
Your body jerks and you begin to breathe
Through the haze you see the knife
Will this be the one to take your life

Follow me walking to the circle of light
Follow me this could be the end of your life

Follow me walking to the circle of light
Follow me this could be the end of your life
