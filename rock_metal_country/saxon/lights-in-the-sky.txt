Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh

Silver ships across the sky
Something I have never seen before
Was it true or fantasy
I don't know the answers anymore
All I know is what I saw
Something shooting fast across the sky

Did we see a rocket ship from another star
Shooting through our galaxy coming from afar
But I see your lights shining in the sky
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, shining in the sky

Leave your signs across the land
Mysteries, the answers that we seek
Coming from another world
See the circles in the golden wheat
One day soon we'll talk to you
Find out if you come to us in peace

Did we see a rocket ship coming from afar
Shooting through our galaxy from another star
But I see your lights shining in the sky
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, shining in the sky

Silver ships across the sky
Something I have never seen before
Was it true or fantasy
I don't know the answers anymore
All I know is what I saw
Something shooting fast across the sky

Did we see a rocket ship coming from afar
Shooting through our galaxy from another star
But I see your lights shining in the sky
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, shining in the sky
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I see your lights shining in the sky
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, shining in the sky
