Take a giant step for mankind
On a distant lunar sea
As you travel across the universe
Will you take a step, take a step for me
Will you take a step for me

Voyage of an eagle
Blasting to the stars
You take the hopes and dreams of men
To find yourself, to find tranquillity
To find tranquillityTraveled across the universe
And placed the lonely flag
Out there in isolation
At the final, the final frontier
At the final frontier

The world's in celebration
As we wait for your return
You took a giant leap for mankind
On another, on another world
On another world

Take it easy take it slow
Don't go fast don't let go
The eagle has landed
The eagle has landed
The eagle has landed
The eagle has landed
