They land on your shore
Kick down your door
Invaders from over the sea
They rape and they slaughter
Your wives and your daughter
Pillage the wealth from your land
Where do they come from these warrior hoards
When their death and destruction to you
They come with the thunder
To kill and to plunder
Pillage the wealth from your land

So build you defenses against the invader
The tyrant from over the sea
Warrior came, warrior saw, warrior conquered
Warrior came, warrior saw, warrior conquered

The village is peaceful
No sign of danger
People at work in the fields
Then they hit you like lightning
Screaming and fighting
Gunning you down in the wheat
Over the border
The raiding marauder
Carry this wealth to the sea
So you bury your dead 
Put out the fires
But the death will be back with the tideSo build you defenses against the invader
The tyrant from over the sea
Warrior came, warrior saw, warrior conquered
Warrior came, warrior saw, warrior conquered

They land on your shore
Kick down your door
Invaders from over the sea
They rape and they slaughter
Your wives and your daughter
Pillage the wealth from your land
Where do they come from these warrior hoards
When their death and destruction to you
They come with the thunder
To steal and to plunder
Spilling your blood on the ground

So build you defenses against the invader
The tyrant from over the sea
Warrior came, warrior saw, warrior conquered
Warrior came, warrior saw, warrior conquered
Warrior came, warrior saw, warrior conquered
Warrior came, warrior saw, warrior conquered
