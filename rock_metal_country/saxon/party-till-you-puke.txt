Come on everybody
Tonight it's party time
Grab a bottle or a crate
Leave your blues behind
You're gonna need the cavalry
To get you outta here
The last time that we had one
It lasted for a year

We're gonna party
Party till u puke
These people are sick

We're gonna party
Party till u puke
Till u pukeDon't worry about the neighbours
They're blind drunk in the loo
There'll be no trouble from the police
'Cos they're all in here too
We got the music cranked right up
It's blowing off the roof
There's people drinking gasoline
It must be two hundred proof

We're gonna party
Party till u puke
Will someone get me outta here?

We're gonna party
Party till u puke
Till u puke

These people are weird!
