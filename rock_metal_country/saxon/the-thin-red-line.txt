You'd better sleep with your rifle
Keep your powder dry
You'll be fighting for your country
See the colours fly
They'll be coming in the morning boys
You gotta hold the line

You're the men from Harloch
You'll be standing proud
You're the Queen's light infantry
Sing out loud
They'll be coming in the morning boys
You gotta hold the line

You came for the glory
To fight and to die
You stood in the thin red line
Remember the heroes
When stories are told
They died in the thin red line
In the thin red line

Stand steady in the ranks boys
You gotta hold your fire
We'll show 'em what we're made of
When they hit the wire
They'll be coming in the morning boys
You gotta hold the line

You'll be thinking of your loved ones
That you left back there
Then the sound of the bugle
Cuts the cool night air
They'll be coming in the morning boys
You gotta hold the lineYou came for the glory
To fight and to die
You stood in the thin red line
Remember the heroes
When stories are told
They died in the thin red line
In the thin red line

Now you lay with your comrades
Far across the sea
Where you're fighting for the Empire
Did you die for me
They'll be coming in the morning boys
You gotta hold the line

You'd better sleep with your rifle
Keep your powder dry
You'll be fighting for your country
See the colours fly
They'll be coming in the morning boys
You gotta hold the line

You came for the glory
To fight and to die
You stood in the thin red line
Remember the heroes remember the heroes
When stories are told
They died in the thin red line

You came for the glory you came for the glory
To fight and to die
You stood in the thin red line
Remember the heroes remember the heroes
When stories are told
They died in the thin red line
In the thin red line
