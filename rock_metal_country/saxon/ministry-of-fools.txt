Your talking on the TV every single day
Making stupid gestures nothing much to say
Deny responsibility find someone to blame
When it comes right down to it
You're all the fucking same

We're not listening, listening to you
We're not listening, don't tell me what to do
We're not listening, listening to you
We're not listening to the ministry of fools

We listen to your promises they're just a pack of lies
Maneuvering your followers to draw the battle lines
You don't admit to anything you think you'll never fall
But come the revolution you'll be first against the wall

We're not listening, listening to you
We're not listening, don't tell me what to do
We're not listening, listening to you
We're not listening to the ministry of fools

Your talking on the TV every single day
Making stupid gestures nothing much to say
We listen to your promises they're just a pack of lies
Maneuvering your followers you draw your battle lines

We're not listening, listening to you
We're not listening, don't tell me what to do
We're not listening, listening to you
We're not listening to the ministry of fools

We're not listening to the ministry of fools
We're not listening we're not listening
We're not listening to the ministry of fools
We're not listening to the ministry
We're not listening
We're not listening, ministry of fools
We're not listening to the ministry of fools
