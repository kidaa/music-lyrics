We got a 747 coming down in the night			There's a 747 goin' into the night
There's no power, there's no runway lights		There's no power they don't know why
Radio operator try to get a message through		They've no fuel they gotta land soon
Tell the flight deck New York has no lights		They can't land by the light of the moon
There's no power, what do we do				They're overshooting there's no guiding lights
A 747 coming down in the night				Set a course into the night
Try to get a message through				Scandinavian 101
					                For Gods sake get your ground lights on
We were strangers in the night
Both on separate flights				We were strangers in the night
Strangers in the night				        Lost on separate flights
Going nowhere				                Strangers in the night
We were strangers in the night				Going nowhere
Both on separate flights				We were strangers in the night
Strangers in the night			 	        Lost on separate flights
Going nowhere				                Strangers in the night
					                Going nowhere
This is Scandinavian 101
Flight from Hawaii coming out of the sun		Strangers in the night
Kennedy, you should be in sight				We were strangers in the night
We can't see a thing here in the night			Strangers in the night
Navigator says we're on the flight path			We were strangers in the night
There's no radio, no sign of life				Strangers in the night
This is Scandinavian 101				Both on separate flights
For Gods sake get the ground lights on			Strangers in the night
					                Going nowhere
'Cause we were strangers in the night			We were strangers in the night
Both on separate flights				Flight 101
Strangers in the night				        Strangers in the night going nowhere
Going nowhere
We were strangers in the night
Both on separate flights
Strangers in the night
Going nowhere
