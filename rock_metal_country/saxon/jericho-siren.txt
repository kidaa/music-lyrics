Out of the sky came the sound of thunder
Hiding the sun from your sight
Remember the screams of the Jericho siren
Howling like wolves in the night

Attack! They are coming with the dawn
Attack! Your city going to fall
Jericho siren
Jericho siren

Run for your lives run with the refugee
They're pounding you blow after blow
Your country is burning the screams of humanity
Rise from ashes belowAttack! They are coming with the dawn
Attack! Your city going to fall
Jericho siren
Jericho siren

Jericho siren

Out of the sky came the sound of thunder
Hiding the sun from your sight
Remember the screams of the Jericho siren
Howling like wolves in the night

Attack! They are coming with the dawn
Attack! Your city going to fall
Jericho siren
