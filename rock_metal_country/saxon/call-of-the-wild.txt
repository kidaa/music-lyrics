Waiting for the night
Keeping out of sight
You're standing on the streets for kicks
Looking for a thrill
You know you're dressed to kill
You're turning all the young boys on
Treat them all the same
Life is just a game
You're breaking every heart around
Really got it made
Driving me insane
But you're running out of time

It's the call of the wild
Creatures of the night
It's the call of the wild
Calling you tonight

Life is just for fun
Take it on the run
You're trying everything in sight
Living fast and wild
You're a restless child
You're screaming at the night
Fighting fire with fire
Burning with desire
But no one's gonna put you out
Run with the pack
Never lookin' back
But only the strong will surviveIt's the call of the wild
Creatures of the night
It's the call of the wild
Calling you tonight

Waiting for the night
Keeping out of sight
You're standing on the streets for kicks
Looking for a thrill
You know you're dressed to kill
You're turning all the young boys on
Treat them all the same
Life is just a game
You're breaking every heart around
Really got it made
Driving me insane
But you're running out of time

It's the call of the wild
Creatures of the night
It's the call of the wild
Calling you tonight

Repeat to end
