Big wheels are rolling			                     
On thru' the night				                        
We hit the city in the morning		              
No time to eat or sleep			                    
Six concerts in a week
Take the show across the nation		             
Could this be San Antone?			                  
Or am I stood in Rome?			                     
Is the real or am I dreaming?			              
Standing by the backstage door
Just like the one before			                   
We're here to set the spirit free		           

Give us the stage				                         
Turn on the lights				
Fire up the sound				                         
We'll rock the nations			                     

Give us the stage				                         
Turn on the lights
Fire up the sound				                         
We'll rock the nations			                     

Wait for the curtain call			                  
Excitement in the hall
The stage crew ready at their stations		      
The houselights start to dim			               
Another show begins			                        
Now it's time to rock the nations		           
Stand in the flashing lights			               
The music fills the night			                  
The feeling just goes on and on
We take the last encore			                    
The first of many more			                     
The spotlight takes the final bow		           

Give us the stage                    					                               
Turn on the lights                          
Fire up the sound                          
We'll rock the nations                     

Give us the stage                          
Turn on the lights                         
Fire up the sound                          
We'll rock the nations                     

Give us the stage                          
Turn on the lights                         
Fire up the sound                          
We'll rock the nations                     

Give us the stage                          
Turn on the lights                         
Fire up the sound                          
We'll rock the nations                     

Give us the stage                          
Turn on the lights                         
Fire up the sound                          
We'll rock the nations                     

Big wheels are rolling                     
On thru' the night                         
Daylight comes without warning             
North, south, east and west                
We'll put you to the test                  
As we rock across your nation              

Give us the stage                          
Turn on the lights                         
Fire up the sound                          
We'll rock the nations
