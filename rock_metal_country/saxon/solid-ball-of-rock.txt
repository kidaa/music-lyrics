One night in Louisiana down by highway eighty four
You could hear a strange dog howling right outside his mamma's door
The baby was a killer, the cousin was a priest
The baby upped and said, "I play the music of the beast"

The devil in concordia looked down and waved his hand
The boy with jackhawk eyes became the leader of the band
The connoisseur of rhythm, rock 'n' roll and swing
But when it comes to boogie you know that he's the king

Solid ball of rock
Solid ball of rock
Solid ball of rock crashing out of the sky
It's shaking all over but he don't know why

The devil went to Memphis as he flew into the sun
He howled about redemption with a bible and a gun
The preacher beat his cheast and cried, "set my people free"
The killer said "I'll drag ya to the gates of hell with me"

Solid ball of rock
Solid ball of rock
Solid ball of rock crashing out of the sky
It's shaking all over but he don't know why

Solid ball of rock
Solid ball of rock
Solid ball of rock

The killer he was born again and saw gates of hell
The preacher found redemption in a Jacksonville motel
The devil takes the hindmost they're running out of breath
They're gonna have to reckon with the chilling hand of death

Solid ball of rock
Solid ball of rock
Solid ball of rock crashing out of the sky
It's shaking all over but he don't know why

Solid ball of rock
Solid ball of rock
Solid ball of rock crashing out of the sky
It's shaking all over but he don't know why
