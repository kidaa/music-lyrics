See the man in the bookshop
See his withered hand
He walks very slowly never stands in crowds
Children stand and wonder as he turns and walks away
Closely guards the secret
Of the beauty in his eyes

He's the man with the Midas touch
He'll make you burn with just one look
He's the man with the Midas touch
He's got the beauty in his eyes

He looks so innocent
As he shuffles down the street
But he is the holy sentinel
That guards the gates of Hades
To stop the Lord Of Darkness
Coming straight from hell
The bringer of disaster
The one who tolls the bell

He's the man with the Midas touch
He'll make you burn with just one look
He's the man with the Midas touch
He's got the beauty in his eyes

Until the final conflict
He has to walk the earth
To do his master's bidding
And stop the evil force
He waits for Armageddon
The Nazarene will come
Rising from the ashes
Of the fallen world

He's the man with the Midas touch
He'll make you burn with just one look
He's the man with the Midas touch
He's got the beauty in his eyes
Repeat twice to end
