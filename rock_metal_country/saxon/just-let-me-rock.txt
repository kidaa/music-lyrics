Just let me rock rock
Just let me rock rock
Just let me rock rock

You can take away the money
You can take away the gold
You can tell me it's the truth
You know it isn't so

You can say that I'm a vandal
When I ain't done nothing wrong
You can say you've had a good time
When you've really thought it bad

But just let me rock rock
Just let me rock rock
Just let me rock rock
Just let me rock rock
Just let me rock

You can take away the profit
You can give away my share
You can tell me it's a diamond
When it's just a piece of glassYou can tell me I've got nothing
When I hold it in my hand
You can say a scrap of paper
Was a contract that I signed

But just let me rock rock
Just let me rock rock
Just let me rock rock
Just let me rock rock
Just let me rock

You can take away my heroes
You can take away my pride
You can tell me I can trust you
Then take me for a ride

You can say I'm drinking water
When I'm really drinking wine
You can say I'm really clever
Then you laugh behind my back

But just let me rock rock

Just let me rock rock
Repeat to end
