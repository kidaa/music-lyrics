Hey baby, why don't ya come and ride with me
Like a bullet I'm the fastest thing you've ever seen
Hey mamma can you hear the monster scream
Feel the power riding in my mean machine

Just me and my machine out on the highway
Just me and my machine I'll take you tonight
To the redline

Like lighting it's the only way I get my fun
Don't stop me I gotta let my motor run
Sensation running up and down my spine
Celebration streaking past the winning lineJust me and my machine out on the highway
Just me and my machine I'll take you tonight
To the redline

Hey baby, why don't ya come and ride with me
Like a bullet I'm the fastest thing you've ever seen
Hey mamma can you hear the monster scream
Feel the power riding in my mean machine

Just me and my machine out on the highway
Just me and my machine I'll take you tonight
To the redline

To the redline
I'll take ya tonight
To the redline
Redline
