Take it down easy
Take it down low
Slide it to the bottom
And shake it real slow
You move it to the side
And squeeze it real tight
Is there any wonder
I'm losing my sight

Now get me to a doctor
I gotta get a shot
Cause I just can't get enough of you
I'll do anything that you want me to
I just can't get enough of you, oh no
I just can't get enough of you
I'll do anything that you want me to
I just can't get enough of you tonight, oh no

Gotta swing it to the front
Slide it to the back
Grind it real slow
I like it like that
Now turn it round good
Stroke it down bad
Ya giving me a feeling
That I've never hadGet me to a doctor
I'm runnin' too hot
Cause I just can't get enough of you
I'll do anything that you want me to
I just can't get enough of you, oh no
I just can't get enough of you
I'll do anything that you want me to
I just can't get enough of you tonight, oh no

Let me down easy
Let me down slow
Hold me down tight
And never let go

Get me to a doctor
I got it real bad
Cause I just can't get enough of you
I'll do anything that you want me to
I just can't get enough of you, oh no
I just can't get enough of you
I'll do anything that you want me to
I just can't get enough of you tonight, oh no
