Danger inside deep in your mind
Beware of the Beast that's within you
In towers of stone he walks alone
Close to the edge of your dreams

Shrouded in time the end of your line
The curse of the past walks among you
In temples of gold the myth will unfold
Your destiny waits there for you

Unleash the Beast
The time has come
Feel the fire in your soul
It's time
Unleash the Beast

In pages of old when fables were told
Of a time when the beast was among you
In dark gothic rooms you search for the runes
To break from the spell that still binds you

Deep in the mist you just can't resist
To follow the path that will free you
Like grains of sand that slip through your hand
The end of the curse still eludes youUnleash the Beast
The time has come
Feel the fire in your soul
It's time
Unleash the Beast

Unleash the Beast
The time has come
Feel the fire in your soul
It's time
Unleash the Beast
Unleash the Beast

Danger inside deep in your mind
Beware of the Beast that's within you
In towers of stone he walks alone
Close to the edge of your dreams

Unleash the Beast
The time has come
Feel the fire in your soul
It's time

Unleash the Beast
The time has come
Feel the fire in your soul
It's time
Time

Unleash the Beast
