Waaaahhh

Cast your spell in the night
Black hearted woman mystifies
Heart of stone cold as ice
Play the cards roll the dice
You're the devil in disguise
I see the evil in your eyes
I used to love you but now I know
Devil woman ya won't let go

She's a devil, see the devil ride out, waaaahhh
She's a devil, see the devil ride out, ride out

Spin the wheel cast my fate
Wicked body filled with hate
I feel your power in my soul
Trapped inside your crystal ball
Turn the key lock me in
Keep me hungry for your sin
We were lovers from the start
Stop your torture of my heart

She's a devil, see the devil ride out, ride out
She's a devil, see the devil ride out
See the devil ride outSee the devil
See the devil
See the devil, the devil ride out
See the devil, the devil ride out
 Ummm, ya black hearted woman
See the devil, the devil ride out
See the devil, the devil ride out
 You're as cold as ice
See the devil, the devil ride out
See the devil, the devil ride out
 See the devil, the devil ride out
See the devil, the devil ride out
 See the devil ride out

I'm the loser in the game
You're the keeper you got me tamed
You're the priestess with eyes of fire
Now I see you're a liar
I've been a fool I should have known
You were evil up to the bone
Break the spell let me go
It's not a secret anymore

She's a devil, see the devil ride out
She's a devil, see the devil ride out, waaaahhh

She's a devil, see the devil ride out
She's a devil, see the devil ride out

Ride out!
