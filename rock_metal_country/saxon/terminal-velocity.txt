Get your kicks in the edge of the sky
Twenty miles up from the borderline
Feel the rush as your body drops through the air
Take a step right into space
Take the blast right in your face
Ya tumbling down, down towards the ground

Time has come, paid your dues
Take a chance, light the fuse
Step right up, stand in line
In thirty seconds time
Your at terminal velocity
Terminal velocity

Adrenaline rush on a maximum high
Thirty thousand feet to the end of the line
Ya screaming down towards the world below
Push yourself out dive into air
Take a leap the devil may care
Ya ride the wind across the open sky

Time has come, paid your dues
Take a chance, light the fuse
Step right up, stand in line
In thirty seconds time
Your at terminal velocity
At terminal velocityTerminal velocity

Time has come, paid your dues
Take a chance, light the fuse
Step right up, stand in line
In thirty seconds time
Your at terminal velocity
Terminal velocity

Get your kicks in the edge of the sky
Twenty miles up from the borderline
Feel the rush as your body drops through the air
Take a step right into space
Take the blast right in your face
Ya tumbling down, down towards the ground

Time has come, paid your dues
Take a chance, light the fuse
Step right up, stand in line
In thirty seconds time
Your at terminal velocity
At terminal velocity
