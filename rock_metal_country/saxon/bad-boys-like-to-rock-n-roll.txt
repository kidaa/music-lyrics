Step right up and ring the bell
This carousel's going straight to hell straight to hell
When the metal's hot and the music's loud
And your head is spinning round and round round and round

Bad boys like to rock 'n' roll
I said Bad boys like to rock 'n' roll
they like to rock 'n' roll

Hold on tight, don't let go
If you want to rock, just let me know just let me know
Tonight's the night, we're back in town
We're all cranked up and ready to go ready to go

Bad boys like to rock 'n' roll
I said Bad boys like to rock 'n' roll

We'll suck you in and spin you round
We can turn your power on power on
Can't stop now, just feel the rush
Just give me more, can't get enough can't get enough

Bad boys like to rock 'n' roll
I said Bad boys like to rock 'n' roll, don't you know

Bad boys like to rock 'n' roll
I said Bad boys like to rock
Bad boys like to roll
Bad boys like to rock 'n' roll
