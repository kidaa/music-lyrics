Jenny lived at home a perfect little home
She had everything a girl could ever dream of
Only one thing wrong she had a restless heart
She was looking for some love and understanding
Then Billy came along and sang his rebel song
She could see in him something to belive in
And then they fell in love they couldnt help themselves
But will her family understand their reasons

Bridge
Just let your feelings take control of you
Follow your heart and dont let go

Chorus
Two lovers one heartbeat
Keep running keep hiding
Surviving together
Youve got to hold on

She had a blazing row her father threw her out
He didnt understand how much she really loved him
He knew hed gone too far shes never coming back
His stupid pride has sent her running to another
She laid in Billys arms she wished for better times
They made a vow that they would always be together
Hed take her far away shed be his wife one day
She had a dream that theyd be happy ever after

Bridge
Chorus
Guitar solo

They had a perfect life a little baby girl
She was growing up the double of her mother
Only one thing wrong she had a restless heart
She was looking for some love and understanding
The words her father said they echoed in her head
Would she be the one to drive her to another
Would Billy come along and sing his rebel song
Would she see in him something to belive in

Bridge
Chorus repeat
