Tiger Rose let me read some prose to you
just as long as it shows my love any verse will do
Honey, I could make you happy if you'd only let me, heaven knows
My my Tiger Rose

I went to work this morning on the local commuter train or maybe locomotive train
Stopped back early and I peeked through the window pane
There was a man eating from my refrigerator dressed up in my clothes
Why why Tiger Rose?

Called out your name and I kicked down the front door
I grabbed him by my robe and I wrastled him across the floor
I told you you weren't any better than all those other so and so's
Said he wasn't any different than a thousand other Joe Blows
Love disappears so quickly, when it goes it goes
Why why Tiger Rose?

Bye Bye Tiger Rose
So long Tiger, I'm out of here baby
