I had a friend was a big baseball player back in highschool
He could throw that speedball by ya, make you look like a fool
Saw him the other night at this roadside bar I was walking in he was
walking out
We went back inside, sat down, had a few drinks, but all we kept talking
about

Glory Days, yeah they'll pass you by
Glory Days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory Days, glory days

There's this girl that lives up the block, back in school she could turn

all the boys heads
Sometimes on Friday I'll stop by and have a few drinks after she put her
kids to bed
Her and her husband Bobby, well they split up, I guess it's two years gone by
We just sit around talking about the old times, she says when she feels
like crying she starts laughing thinking about

Glory Days...

Think I'm going down to the well tonight and I'm gonna drink till I get`
my fill
I hope when I get older I don't sit around thinking about it, but I probably

will
Yeah just sitting back trying to recapture a little of the glory of
Well the time slips away and leaves you with nothing, mister, but boring 
stories of

Glory Days...

All right boys keep it rocking now
We gonna go home now
Let's go!
