The Skulls met the Pythons
Down at the First Street station
Alliances have been made in alleyways
All across the nation
These boys live off the milk of a silver jet
And the love of sweet young women
Now the Pythons are down from old Englishtown
And they're looking to do some livin'
Well the leader of the Pythons
Is a kid they just call Zero
Now Terry's pop says these kids are some kind of monsters
But Terry says "No, pop, they're just plain heroes"

Zero and Terry they found a love that burnes like wildfire
Now Terry's daddy understood that this Zero was no good
A child, a thief and a liar
Well from out of the darkness that breaks the dawn
Zero rode like twilight
He said "Tonight's the night, Blind Terry, come on"
Terry come on, tonight is the night
Pack your bags, baby

And together they ran like reindeers through the street
Like tomorrow the earth was gonna catch on fire
Now Terry's dad hired some troopers to kill Zero and bring Terry back home
They crawled up in the night
Like firelight

Now snow-white troopers from the council of crime
Rode silver foxes through Terry's field
Oh they met the Pythons down on Route 9 but they refused to yield
The Pythons fought with buzz guns
And the troopers with swords like light
And Zero and Terry they ran away
And the gang fought all through the night

Well now some folks say Zero and Terry got away
Other said they were caught and brought back
But still young pilgrims to this day
Go to that spot way down by the railroad track
Where the Troopers met the Pythons
Old timers cry on a hot August night
If you look hard enough, if you try
You'll catch Zero and Terry and all the Pythons

Oh just hiking them streets of the sky
Just walkin', hiking the streets of the sky
Just hiking the streets of the sky
Hey Zero
