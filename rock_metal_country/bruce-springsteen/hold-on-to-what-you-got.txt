Verse 1:
I worked hard, baby, night and day
The things I had somebody took away
They took away everything I earned
But there's one lesson that'a I have learned

Chorus:
You got to hold on, little girl, to what you've got 4X

Verse 2:
I been pushed and I been knocked down
But I picked myself right back up off the ground
And baby there's one thing that I have found
Fighting's the only way's to stand your ground

Chorus:
You got to hold on, little girl, to what you've got 4X

Bridge:
I've been used, I've been abused
I've had, baby, my regrets
I've been lost, I paid the cost
But there's one thing I ain't gonna forget

Verse 3:
I've heard some hard lines, I've seen some cryin' times
Bad luck and trouble they been friends of mine
Got to stand straight and stare right at your face fate?
And play it hard before it's too late

Chorus:
You got to hold on, little girl, to what you've got 8X
