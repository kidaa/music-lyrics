Woke up this morning, there was a chill in the air
Went to the kitchen, my cigarettes were lying there
Jacket hung on the chair, the way I left it last night
Everything was in place, everything seemed alright

But you were missing, missing

Last night I dreamed the sky went black
You were drifting down, couldn't get back
Lost in trouble, so far from home
I reached for you, my arms were like stone

Oh, but you were missing, missing... missing

Searched for something to explain

In the whispering rain and the trembling leaves
Tell me baby, where did you go
You were here just a moment ago

At nights I still hear your footsteps fall
I can hear your voice moving down the hall
Drifting through the bedroom
I lie awake but I don't move
