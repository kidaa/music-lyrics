I remember how rough your hand felt on mine on my wedding day
And the tears cried onmy shoulder I couldn't turn away
Well so much has happened to me that I don't understand
All I can think of is being five years old following behind you at the 
  beach tracing your footprints in the sand
Trying to walk like a man

By Our Lady Of The Roses we lived in the shadow of the elms
I remember ma draggin' me and my sister up the street to the church whenever
 she heard those wedding bells

Well would they ever look so happy again the handsome groom and his bride
As they stepped into that long black limosine for their mystery ride
Well tonight you step away from me and alone at the alter I stand
And as I watch my bride coming down the aisle I pray for the strength to
 walk like a man

Well now the years have gone and I've grown from that seed you've sown
But I didn't think there'd be so many steps I'd have to learn on my own
Well I was young and I didn't know what to do

When I saw your best steps stolen away from you
Now I'll do what I can
I'll walk like a man
And I'll keep on walkin'
