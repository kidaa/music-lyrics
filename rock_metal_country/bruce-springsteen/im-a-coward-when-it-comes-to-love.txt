I ain't afraid of no lions
I ain't afraid of no grizzly bear
I got in a wrestlin' match with old King Kong
He didn't even muss my hair
There's just one thing in the whole wide world
That make me doubt my stuff

I'm a coward when it comes to love

Now bring down old Hulk Hogan
King Kong Bundy too
Bring down old Big Mike Tyson
I'll show them what a real man can do
They say the tougher' get goin'
Now baby that's when the goin' get tough

But I'm a coward when it comes to love
I'm a coward when it comes to love
I'm a coward when it comes to love

You can bring on a different sexy girl
At every night of the week
Buddy that's okay
But I start tremblin', my knees get weak
Whenever I hear her say
"Do you love me baby?"
"Do you love me baby?"
"Do you love me baby?"

I got a muscle of iron
I got another muscle made of steel
But when we start kissin' 'n' huggin'
You may be the bravest man in the whole wide world
But Buddy, that ain't enough

I'm a coward when it comes to love
I'm a coward when it comes to love
I'm a coward when it comes to love
