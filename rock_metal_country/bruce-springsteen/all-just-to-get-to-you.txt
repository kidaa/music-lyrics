I have stumbled on the plains 
Staggered in the wind 
Stood at a crossroad or two 
Cried to a river 
Swept to the sea 
All just to get to you 

I have flagged a yellow cab 
Hopped a rusty freight 
Sang till my lips turned blue 
Flown a silver bird 
On the tops of the clouds 
All just to get to you 

I ran too hard 
I played too Rough 
I gave my Love 
Not near Enough 
I bled too red 
I cried too blue 
I beat my fist 
Against the moon 
All just to get to you 

I have run from St. Paul 
To Wichita Falls 
Call'd you from sunny Baton Rouge
Hocked everything 
From my watch to my ring 
All just to get to you 

I ran too hard 
I played too Rough 
I gave you Love 
Not near Enough 
I bled too red 
I cried too blue 
I beat my fist 
Against the moon 
All just to get to you 

From the California Shore 
Where the mighty ocean roars 
To the lands of the Hopi and the Sioux
I walked the desert sands 
Crossed the Rio Grande 
All just to get to you 

I have stumbled on the plains 
Staggered in the wind 
Stood at a crossroad or two 
Cried to a river 
Swept to the sea 
All just to get to you
