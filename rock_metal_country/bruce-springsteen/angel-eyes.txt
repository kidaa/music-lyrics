I try to think that love's not around
But still it's unconfortably near
Tonight my heart is losing ground
'Cause my angel eyes ain't here

Angel eyes that devil sent
They glow unbearably bright
And need I say that my love is mis-spent
Mis-spent with angel eyes tonight

So drink up all you people
Order anything you see
Drink up all you happy people
'Cause the drinks and the jokes are on me

Now pardon me man 'cause I've got to run
You see the flags are uncommonly clear
I wanna know who's her new number one
My angel eyes ain't here

Excuse me while I disappear...
