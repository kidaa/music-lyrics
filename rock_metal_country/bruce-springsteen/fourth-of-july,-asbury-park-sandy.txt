Sandy, the fireworks are hailin' over Little Eden tonight,
Forcin' a light into all those stoney faces left stranded on this warm July,
Down in town the circuit's full of switchblade lovers so fast, so shiney, so sharp,
As the wizards play down on Pinball Way on the boardwalk way past dark,
And the boys from the casino dance with their shirts open like Latin lovers on the shore,
Chasin' all them silly New York virgins by the score.

Sandy, the aurora is risin' behind us,

Those pier lights, our carnival life forever,
Oh love me tonight for I may never see you again,
Hey, Sandy girl, my baby.

Now the greasers, they tramp the streets or get busted for sleepin' on the beach all night,
Them boys in their high heels, ah Sandy, their skins are so white,
And me, I just got tired of hangin' in them dusty arcades bangin' them pleasure machines,
Chasin' the factory girls underneath the boardwalk where they all promised to unsnap their jeans,

And you know that tilt-a-whirl down on the south beach drag, I got on it last night and my shirt got caught,
And it kept me spinnin', they didn't think I'd ever get off.

Sandy, the aurora is risin' behind us,
Those pier lights, our carnival life on the water,
Runnin' laughin' underneath the boardwalk with the boss's daughter,
I remember, Sandy girl, my baby.

Sandy, the waitress I was seein' lost her desire for me,
I spoke with her last night, she said she won't set herself on fire for me anymore,

She worked that joint under the boardwalk, 
She was always the girl you saw  boppin' down the beach with the radio,
Kids say last night she was dressed like a star in one of the cheap little seaside bars
And I saw her parked with her loverboy out on the Kokomo,
Did you hear, the cops finally busted Madame Marie for tellin' fortunes better than they do,
For me, this boardwalk life is through, you ought to quit this scene too.

Sandy, the aurora is risin' behind us,

Those pier lights, our carnival life forever,
Oh, love me tonight and I promise I'll love you forever,
Oh, I mean it Sandy girl.
