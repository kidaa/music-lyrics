Crazy Janey and her mission man were back in the alley tradin' hands
`Long came Wild Billy with his friend G-man all duded up for Saturday night
Billy slammed on his coaster brakes and said anybody wanna go on up to Greasy Lake
It's about a mile down on the dark side of Route 88 I got a bottle of rose so let's try it
We'll pick up Hazy Davy and Killer Joe and I'll take you all out to where the gypsy angels go
They're built like light

And they dance like spirits in the night all night in the night all night

Oh you don't know what they can do to you
Spirits in the night, in the night
Stand up now and let it shoot through you

Well now Wild Billy was a crazy cat and he shook some dust out of his coonskin cap
He said  Trust some of this it'll show you where you're at or at least it'll help you really feel it 
By the time we made it up to Greasy Lake I had my head out the window and Janey's fingers in the cake
I think I really dug her `cause I was too loose to fake  said  I'm hurt

  she said  Honey let me heal it  And we danced all night to a soul fairy band
And she kissed me just right like only a lonely angel can

She felt just right just like as sweet as a spirit in the night
In the night baby don't know what she do to you
Spirits in the night, in the night
Stand up now and let her shoot right through you

Now the night grew bright and the stars threw light in Billy and Davy Dancin' in the moonlight
We were down near the water in a stone mud fight Killer Joe'd passed out on the lawn

Well Hazy Davy got really hurt he crawled into the lake in just his socks and  a shirt
Me and Crazy Janey were makin' love in the dirt singin' our birthday songs
Janey said  Hey little brother don't you think it's time now we go 
So we closed our eyes and said goodbye to gypsy angel row felt just right

Together we moved like spirits in the night, all night
Baby don't know what it do to you
Spirits in the night, all night
Stand up now and let it shoot right through you
