The wind and rain slashing at my window pane 
Lightning's flashing, looks like the sky's gone insane 
And it seems like you have lied again 
And now I'm left with the wind and the rain 

Oh, shattered truth, jagged memories heal 
You know it's hard them dreams that just can't come true
How long's it been since I've known you 
Now the wind and rain is my only truth 

Summertime, summertime remembers when you were mine 
And now that's left so far behind 
Can't you see what you've done to my mind 
Now the wind and the rain's forever mine 

Hey, yeah, yeah, ain't time shoring it up 
Oh, the year's have made me far too tough 
And when I started to go, I got rough 
Now the wind and the rain is my only love 
I said the wind and the rain is my only love 
You know the wind and the rain is my only love 

Wintertime 
memories when you were mine 
Oh, let them shine 
Golden moments lost in time 
Now I hear the grandfather's chime 
The wind and rain's forever mine 

The wind and the rain slashing at my window pane 
Seems like you have lied again 
But now I guess that it's just the same 
And I am left with the wind and the rain 

Hasn't time shown you enough 
The years have made me far too tough 
But you know where I stood when the going got rough 
The wind and the rain is my only love 
The wind and the rain is all I love 
The wind and the rain is all I love 
The wind and the rain is all I love 
The wind and the rain is all I love
