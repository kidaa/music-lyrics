I heard the news, there's good rockin' tonight
Gonna hold my baby as tight as I can
Tonight she'll know I'm a mighty man
I heard the news, there's good rockin' tonight

Oh, lead me in the alley behind the barn
Don't be afraid, I'll do you no harm
Baby, bring my rockin' shoes
'Cause tonight I'm gonna rock away all my blues
Have you heard the news, there's good rockin' tonight

Well, Elder Brown, Deacon Jones,
They've left their happy home
They'll be there, just you wait and see
A-jumpin' and a-stompin' at the jubilee
Hey man, there's good rockin' tonight

Sweet Lorraine, Sioux City Sue,
Sweet Georgia Brown, Caledonia, too
They'll be there jumpin' like mad
Hey, sister, ain't you glad
We got the news there's good rockin' tonight
