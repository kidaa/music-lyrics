It was Christmas eve, I was standing in the parking lot of  Fabulous Girls
- Nude, Nude, Nude 
In the car next to me there was a young lady givin' a blow job to a man in
a Santa Claus suit
His beard was crooked, his hat askew embarrassed, I turned to go
When from the back seat of the mazda I heard somebody shout  oh, baby,
don't stop 
And a merry  ho ho ho 

Well I walked inside, I ordered a beer and a double shot of whiskey and in
three minutes I had fallen in love

The DJ announced,  Ladies and gentlemen, from Fort Worth, Texas - lady
Godiva  and I sat and worshipped 'neath the angel above
At the end of her set she brushed her hair came and sat on the stool to my
right and said  will you buy me a drink 
My heart beat fast, my trousers grew tight and wittily I replied  uhh.... 

She showed me a picture of her kid, said during the day she's an art
student
She dances six nights a week for slobs and idiots like this, of course,

present company
excluded

On Donner, on Dancer, on Comet, on Blitzen
I'm lost in the valley of the Supervixens
Worshippin' at the feet of the goddess above
I'm a pilgrim in the temple of love,
Ma just a pilgrim in the temple of love

Well, then Santa came stumblin' in and somebody shouted  hey Santa,
where're your elves 
He sat down on the stool to my left and the bartender took a vodka bottle
off the shelf
He asked if mrs. Claus had called, to tell her he worked the late shift at

the mall and he was sorry, but he just got through
I turned and I asked him  how's the kids this year, Santa 
Beneath his breath he whispered  a merry fuck you 

Well, then the owner came over and
he was a short fat ugly guy with a
funny kind of pushed-in face
He shook my hand and said it was the
first time they ever had a superstar in this place
Lady Godiva bought me a few drinks and words came out
of my mouth what they were I couldn't guess
But it was something about showgirls, lapdancing,

Motley Crew, you can guess the rest

On Donner, on Dancer, on Comet, on Blitzen
I'm lost in the valley of the Supervixens
Worshippin' at the feet of the goddess above
I'm a pilgrim in the temple of love,
Ma just a pilgrim in the temple of love

Well, I walked outside, snow was fallin',
I had some toys to put together, it was Christmas time
Santa followed me into the parking lot and threw up on the hood of the car
next to mine
I gave him my hankerchief, pulled out onto the highway and as I sat at the

light
I swear I saw a sleigh with a dozen reindeer pull out of the parking lot
And cut across to the mall and a voice shouted,  Merry Christmas to all,
you assholes, and a good fuckin' night 

On Donner, on Dancer, on Comet, on Blitzen
I'm lost in the valley of the Supervixens
Worshippin' at the feet of the goddess above
I'm a pilgrim in the temple of love,
Ma just a pilgrim in the temple of love
