The runway rushed up at him, as he felt the wheels touch down
He stood out on the blacktop, and took a taxi into town.
He got off down on Main Street, and went into a local bar
Bought a drink and found a seat in the corner in the dark
She called up her mama to make sure the kids were outa' the house
She checked herself out in the dining room mirror,
and undid an extra button on her blouse
He felt her lyin' next to him and the clock said 4 am
He was starin' at the ceilin' he couldn't move his hands

Oh mama, mama, mama come quick,
I've got the shakes and I'm gonna be sick,
throw your arms around me in the cold dark night,
hey now mama don't shut out the light,
don't you shut out the light,....

Well on his porch they stretched a banner, that said Johnny Welcome Home
Bobby pulled his Ford outa' the garage and they polished up the chrome
His mama said Johnny oh Johnny, I'm so glad to have you back with me
His pa said he was sure they'd give him his job back at the renderin'

factory

Oh mama, mama, mama come quick,
I've got the shakes and I'm gonna be sick,
throw your arms around me in the cold dark night,
hey now mama don't shut out the light,
don't you shut out the light,....

Well deep in a dark forest, a forest filled with rain
Beyond a stretch of Maryland pines there's a river without a name
In the cold black water, Johnson Linnier stands
He stares across the lights of the city and dreams of where he's been.

Oh mama, mama, mama come quick,

I've got the shakes and I'm gonna be sick,
throw your arms around me in the cold dark night,
hey now mama don't shut out the light,
don't you shut out the light,....
