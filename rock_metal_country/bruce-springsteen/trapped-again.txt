Here I am baby, right where you found me
Trying to break these chains that surround me
If I look a little different, it's because I've changed
Half-painted pictures are all that remains

I can't let my past mistakes
Let 'em bring me down
I ain't waitin' on no angel of mercy
I've tried my best and I can't help myself

And I'm trapped again
And I can't get out without losing you
And I'm trapped again
Why can't you feel what I'm going through
I'm trapped again
I need an answer girl, can't you see
I'm trapped again
Come and rescue me

Monday morning came so fast
What a fool to think that dreams would last
Close my eyes and it's still so clear
Remember the night girl, the world disappeared

Can't let the hand of fate
Let it drag me down
I can't get no angel of mercy
I came to stay but I got swept away

And I'm trapped again
And I can't get out without losing you
And I'm trapped again
Why can't you feel what I'm going through
I'm trapped again
I need an answer girl, can't you see
I'm trapped again
Come and rescue me

Can't let the hand of fate
Let it drag me down
I can't get no angel of mercy
I came to stay but I got swept away

And I'm trapped again
And I can't get out without losing you
And I'm trapped again
Why can't you feel what I'm going through
I'm trapped again
I need an answer girl, can't you see
I'm trapped again
Come and rescue me

And I'm trapped again
And I can't get out without losing you
And I'm trapped again
Why can't you feel what I'm going through
I'm trapped again
