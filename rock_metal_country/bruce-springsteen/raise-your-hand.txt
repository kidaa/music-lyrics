If there's something you need
That you just don't have
Well just don't sit there
Feeling bad
Come on now get up
Try and understand
Just raise you hand

Baby here I am
You know I'm standing in line
I wanna give you my love
Please let me try
Come on now get up
Try and understand
Just raise your hand

Hungry Heart

Got a wife and kids in Baltimore Jack
I went out for a ride and I never went back
Like a river that don't know where it's flowing

I took a wrong turn and I just kept going

CHORUS:
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Lay down your money and you play your part
Everybody's got a hungry heart

I met her in a Kingstown bar
We fell in love I knew it had to end
We took what we had and we ripped it apart
Now here I am down in Kingstown again

CHORUS

Everybody needs a place to rest
Everybody wants to have a home
Don't make no difference what nobody says
Ain't nobody like to be alone

CHORUS
