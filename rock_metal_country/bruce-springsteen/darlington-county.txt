Driving into Darlington County
Me and Wayne on the Fourth of July
Driving into Darlington County
Lookin' for some work on the county line
We drove down from New York City
Where the girls are pretty but they just wanna know your name
Driving into Darlington City
Got a union connection with an uncle of Wayne's
We drove eight hundred miles without seeing a cop
We got rock'n'roll music blasting off the t-top

Singing sha-la la, sha la la la la la

sha-la la la la la la
sha-la la, sha-la la la la la
sha-la la la la la la

Hey little girl, standing on the corner
Today's your lucky day for shure, all right
Me and my buddy, we're from New York City
We got two hundred dollars, we want to rock all night
Girl, you're lookin' at two big spenders
Why, the world don't know what me and Wayne might do
Our pa's each own one of the World Trade Centers
For a kiss and a smile I'll give mine all to you

C'mon baby, take a seat on the fender, it's a long night
Tell me, what else were you gonna do
Just me and you, we could ...

Chorus

Little girl, sittin' in the window
Ain't seen my buddy in seven days
County man tells me the same thing
He don't work, and he don't get paid
Little girl, you're so young and pretty
Walk with me and you can have your way
Then we'll leave this Darlington City
For a ride down that Dixie Highway


Chorus

Driving out of Darlington County
My eyes seen the glory of the coming Lord
Driving out of Darlington County
Seen Wayne handcuffed to the bumper of a state trooper's Ford
Chorus
