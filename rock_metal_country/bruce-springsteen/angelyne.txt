He was a bouncer in a joint called Tony's Body Shop
She was a night cashier down at the Stop 'n' Shop
He was kinda good-lookin'
And she was kinda fun
They met 'neath that big oak tree
Out where the river runs

Little Angelyne, little Angelyne
As the sun goes down and the moonlight shines
Back of a greyhound bus sit two lovers entwined
Just Big Bill and little Angelyne

She was just in from Texas, didn't know her way around
So he took her to a roadhouse on the edge of town
In the beerhall light she looked so fine
And so he popped the question that was on his mind

It was a simple affair, only a friend or two
Preacher asked if they did, they said they do
She bought two tickets with her Daddy's American Express
And hopped a greyhound bus in her wedding dress

Little Angelyne, little Angelyne
As the sun goes down and the moonlight shines
Back of a greyhound bus sit two lovers entwined
Just Big Bill and little Angelyne

In a six dollar motel with the honey bun
With seven glorious days in the Nevada sun
He played the tables, she pumped the slots full of dimes
They came back broke but they had a good time

Now many fell apart in the years come and gone
But Big Bill and little Angel they'd last on and on
They held together when the times grew thin
A little boy that looked like her, and a girl that looked like him

So mister don't you pay it no mind
Let the sun go down and the moonlight shine
Back of a greyhound bus sit two lovers entwined
Just Big Bill and little Angelyne

Little Angelyne, little Angelyne
As the sun goes down and the moonlight shines
Back of a greyhound bus sit two lovers entwined
Just Big Bill and little Angelyne

Little Angelyne, little Angelyne
As the sun goes down and the moonlight shines
Back of a greyhound bus sit two lovers entwined
Just Big Bill and little Angelyne
