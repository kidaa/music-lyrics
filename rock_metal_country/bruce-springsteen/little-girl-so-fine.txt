After the music had stopped
I still heard it playing
I moved a little closer to hear
The words she was saying
She said I'll never break your heart
I'll never try to fake it
My love is here for you
All you have to do is take it
Kisses sweeter than wine
My little girl so fine

The night seemed to say it was right
But could I believe her
My heart said, it's time to go
But my eyes wouldn't leave her
There's always somebody trying to break your heart
Somebody trying to take it
My little girl tried so hard
To help me make it
Kisses sweeter than wine
My little girl so fine

Oh, oh, oh, oh, sha la la
Oh, oh, sha la la
So fine
Oh, oh, oh, oh, sha la la
Oh, oh, sha la la
So fine

When we danced
I forgot everything and whispered
Hold me tight
Take a chance
On what tomorrow brings
Won't you be mine, be mine
Be mine tonight

We walked away laughing together
Into the night for ever and ever and ever
Now I know
I'll never break me baby's heart
I'll never try to fake it
I'll give her all my love
All she has to do is take it
Kisses sweeter than wine
My little girl so fine
Kisses sweeter than wine
My little girl so fine
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Kisses sweeter than wine
My little girl so fine

Oh, oh, oh, oh, sha la la
Oh, oh, sha la la
So fine
