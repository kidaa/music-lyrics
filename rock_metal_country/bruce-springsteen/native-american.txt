I am Native American

Ho Ka Hey Wah Nah Steven and Bruce
Ho Ka Hey Wah Nah Woh
Ho Ka Hey Wah Nah
Ho Ka Hey Wah Nah Woh
Ho Ka Hey Wah Nah
Ho Ka Hey Wah Nah Woh

Editors note: the above is war cry of the LakotaSioux meaning
"Let's Go - Now"

Life was forever when we were young Steven
The land was protected for everyone Bruce
Forever as long as the rivers run Both
But now the water no longer comes Steven

And now all that remains Both
Is darkness a poisoned Earth
And now before it's too late
We must provide our own new birth

Chorus:
I am Native American
I am Native American

The question of honor you must decide Bruce
The soul of the nation has been denied Steven
Our dreams have been stolen before our eyes Both
How do you say there's no tomorrow to a child? Bruce

From us there is much to learn Both
There is so much you've forgotten
You can't change me
Try and understand I am proud of who I am

Chorus:
I am Native American
I am Native American

We must try and remember what we're here for Steven
You will suffer the darkness alone no more Bruce
You will have the strength of all of us
gathered here today Both
That is something they can never take away Bruce

Chorus:
I am Native American
I am Native American

Ho Ka Hey Wah Nah Steven and Bruce
Ho Ka Hey Wah Nah Woh
