Where the road is dark, and the seed is sowed
Where the gun is cocked, and the bullet's cold 
Where the miles are marked in the blood and gold 
I'll meet you further on up the road 

Got on my dead man's suit and my smilin' skull ring
My lucky graveyard boots and song to sing 
I got a song to sing to keep me out of the cold 
And I'll meet you further on up the road 

Further on up the road 
Further on up the road 
Where the way is dark and the night is cold 
One sunny morning we'll rise I know 
And I'll meet you further on up the road 

Now I been out in the desert, just doin' my time 
Searching through the dust, looking for a sign 
If there's a light up ahead, well brother I don't know 
But I got this fever burning in my soul 
So let's take the good times as they go
And I'll meet you further on up the road 

Further on up the road 
Further on up the road 
Further on up the road 
Further on up the road

One sunny morning we'll rise, I know 
And I'll meet you further on up the road 
One sunny morning we'll rise, I know 
And I'll meet you further on up the road
