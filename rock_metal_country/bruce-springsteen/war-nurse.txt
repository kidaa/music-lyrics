She was just another war nurse
She could strike a noble pose
Caring for our young boys
When a bullet laid him low
She would have over them cry
And pulled the covers over them when they died
She was just another lonesome lady, lover, sister of the gun
And though friends would call her darling
She was the nurse 'neath the rising sun
She knew no hells or heavens, or harbors or havens
She was every mother, sister, wife and lover
Whose love a soldier boy was savin'
She believed in the birth of the broad sword
She was not a shielded one
Though friends would call her darlin'
She was nurse 'neath the rising sun
She was a soldier's shrapnel sweetheart
Direct from the combat zone
She was the reincarnation of the Virgin Mary
She was the hooker down in San Antone
And though her heart was somewhere in Iceland
Command in the dawn patrol
Blessed in this blood and stitched into these bones
the war nurse left her soul
Blessed in this blood and stitched into these bones
the war nurse left her soul
