Bright light city gonna set my soul gonna set my soul on fire
I gotta whole 'lotta money and it's ready to burn so get those steaks up higher
Well there's a thousand pretty women waitin' there
They're all livin' just a devil may care
And I'm just the devil with love to spare
Viva Las Vegas, Viva las vegas
How i Wish that there were more that 24 hours in the day
Even if there were 40 more i wouldn't go a minute away
Black-Jack, Poker, and the Roullette whell, a fortune won or lost on ev'ry deal
All you need's money and nerve's of steel
Viva Las vegas, Viva Las Vegas Viva Las vegas
with your neon flashing and your one armbandits crashin' all your hopes down the drain
Viva Las Vegas turnin' day into nightime, turnin' night into daytime
If you see it once, you'll never be the same again I'm gonna run I'm gonna have some fun if it costs me my very last dime
If I wind up broke well i'll always remember that I had me a swingin' time
I'm gonna give it everything i got
lady luck let the dice stay hot
Let me shoot a seven with every shot
Viva las Vegas, Viva Las Vegas
Viva Viva Las Vegas!
