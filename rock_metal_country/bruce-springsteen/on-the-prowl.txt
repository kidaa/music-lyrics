Well night after lonely night
My head don't touch the bed
I'm on a two-lane black-top
Cruisin' in my rocket sled
I'm on the prowl
Yeah I'm on the prowl
Well I'm looking for a gal, gal, gal
Hey, hey, hey, I'm on the prowl

There's only one thing that I'm certain
Every mile, mile, mile
Keep a-searchin', serachin', serachin'
For a wild, wild, child
I'm on the prowl
I'm on the prowl
I'm looking for a gal, gal, gal
Hey, hey, hey, I'm on the prowl

They got a name for Dracula
And Frankenstein's son
They ain't got no name now Mister
For this monster thing that I've become
I'm on the prowl
I'm on the prowl
I'm looking for a gal, gal, gal
Hey, hey, hey, I'm on the prowl

I keep lookin'
I keep searchin'
I keep searchin'
I keep searchin'
Only one thing that I'm certain
Every mile, mile, mile
I keep searchin', searchin', searchin', searchin', searchin'

In the morning I check my mirror
And I hang my head and cry
But at night I get a burning, burning, burning deep inside
I'm on the prowl
I'm on the prowl
I'm looking for a gal, gal, gal
Hey, hey, hey, I'm on the prowl

In the morning I check my mirror
And I hang my head and cry
But at night I get a burning, burning, burning, burning, burning. burning

There's only one thing that I'm certain
Every while, while, while
While my heart is hurtin', hurtin'
Every mile, mile, mile
I gotta keep searchin', searchin', searchin', searchin', searchin'
