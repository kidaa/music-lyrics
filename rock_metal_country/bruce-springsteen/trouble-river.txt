There's a river runs through this valley
Cold and deep and black
Comin' like a tombstone shadow across my back

CHORUS
Trouble river, six foot high and risin
Trouble river, I can't keep from cryin'

I woke up last night shakin'
Shakin' from a dream
That all I seen was smiling faces staring back at me

CHORUS

Snakes crawling in the hi house
I'm stuck in muddy ground
Tonight I'm gonna shed this skin
And I'll be breathin' free air now

CHORUS
