She said we could just sleep together
There'd be nothing wrong
We could just hold each other with our clothes on
I went to answer, I don't think we should
Then I heard a voice say, Yeah, I guess we could
She kissed me slightly and said you know sometimes when you're down

It's the little things that count
It's the little things that count
It's the little things

She said it was too late, and I shouldn't try to drive
She unbuttoned my shirt and whispered just close your eyes

Let me take your boots off, you know sometimes when your luck's run out

It's the little things that count
It's the little things that count
It's the little things

Her dress rode slightly as she walked
Then she pulled the covers down

I was so dry, she held a water glass to my lips
Well the polsih on her nail was chipped
She said she had a boyfriend I reminded her of
His hair was the same muddy brown,
she stuck her tongue in my mouth
