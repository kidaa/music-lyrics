Oh, when I was a little kid I never liked to eat,
Mama'd put things on my plate, I'd dump them on her feet,
But then one day she made this soup, I ate it all in bed,
I asked her what she put in it, and this is want she said.

Chorus:
Chicken lips and lizard hips and alligator eyes
Monkey legs and buzzard eggs and salamander thighs
Rabbit ears and camel rears and tasty toe-nail pies
Stir them all together, it's Mama's Soup Surprise.

I went into the bathroom and stood beside the sink,
I said I'm feeling slightly ill, I think I'd like a drink,
Mama said "I've just the thing, I'll get it in a wink,
It's full of lots of protein, and vitamins I think."

Chorus:
Chicken lips and lizard hips and alligator eyes
Monkey legs and buzzard eggs and salamander thighs
Rabbit ears and camel rears and tasty toe-nail pies
Stir them all together, it's Mama's Soup Surprise.
