Well my mother rolled over and died in Michigan
My dog got hit by a truck and I cried in Michigan
I got drunk and puked up my guts in Michigan

But I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright
And man I'm riding here tonight in Michigan

I ran a race and came in dead last in Michigan
Yeah, I shot myself in the ass in Michigan

I was lookin' for someplace to feel free But they busted my for just
being me In Michigan

But alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
And baby I'm riding high tonight in Michigan

I ran into a little bad luck in Michigan
I met a woman 

Baby I'm running late but you got here one hell of a state
In Michigan
Oh Michigan
