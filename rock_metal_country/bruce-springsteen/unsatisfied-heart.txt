Sir I am a pilgrim
and a stranger in this land
once I had a home here
my salvation was at hand
I lived in a house of gold
yeah on the far hill side
I had two beautiful children
and a kind and loving wife

chorus
and you live
with unsatisfied heart, can you live
with unsatisfied heart, can you live
with unsatisfied heart, can you live
with unsatisfied heart

and one day a man came to town
with nothing and nowhere to go
he came to me and he mentioned
something I'd done a long time ago
I allowed him into my home
on his vow that secret wouldn't see the light
at night I lay awake in my wife's arms
she sighed Joe are you alright

chorus

day after day, time
yeah time passed on by
but I could feel myself changing
yeah changing deep inside

one night I woke up
and as my wife did sleep
I got dressed in the darkness
and I fled into the street

chorus
instrumental

night after night
the same dream keeps comin round
I'm standing high on the green hills
on the outskirts of town
the night air fills my lungs
and rustles my shirt
I can see the house where we live
the building where I used to work

as I draw near
the town's lit by a red summer moon
I feel your arms around me
I wake up in this room

chorus
