Here she comes, walking down the street
You know she's walking just like she's walking to come and see
Oh she's so young
And she's so fine
I know what's on your mind, know what you want to do
But if you mess with her, I'm gonna mess with you
You better watch your step, you better stay in line

This little girl is mine, oh oh
This little girl is mine, oh oh
This little girl is mine, this little girl, this little girl is mine
Oh oh this little girl is mine
This little girl is mine, oh oh
This little girl is mine, this little girl, this little girl is mine

Well if the world were mine to do with what I want to do, sir
Well I'd wrap it up in a bow and giver it all to her
Yeah and all of my love, all of the time
You know I'd hold her tight, I'd never let her go
And late at night you know I'd love her so
Yeah I'd treat her right, so she'd never mind
That

This little girl is mine, oh oh
This little girl is mine, oh oh
This little girl is mine, this little girl, this little girl is mine

Hey ! You better watch out
I'm telling you the score
Or you're gonna be sweeping your broken heart up off the floor
Oh and that ain't all
I'm telling you my friend

I know what's on your mind, know what you wanna do
But if you mess with her, I'm gonna mess with you
You like the way she moves, you like to watch her walk
You better listen up, 'cause man this ain't just talk
You better watch your step, you better stay in line

This little girl is mine, oh oh
This little girl is mine, oh oh
This little girl is mine, this little girl, this little girl is mine
Oh oh this little girl is mine
This little girl is mine, oh oh
This little girl is mine, this little girl, this little girl is mine

This little girl is mine, oh oh
This little girl is mine, oh oh
This little girl is mine, this little girl, this little girl is mine
Oh oh this little girl is mine
This little girl is mine, oh oh
This little girl is mine, this little girl, this little girl is mine
