Out where the creek turns shallow and sandy
And the moon comes skimmin' away the stars
When mesquite comes rushin' over the hilltops
Straight into my arms
Straight into my arms

Well I'm ridin' hard carryin' a cache of Rose's
And a fresh map that I made
Tonight I'm gonna give birth naked and bury my old soul
And dance on it's grave
And dance on it's grave

It's been a long time comin', my dear
It's been a long time comin', but now it's here
And now it's here

Well my daddy he was just a stranger
Lived in a hotel downtown
Well when I was a kid he was just somebody
Somebody I'd see around
Somebody I'd see around

Well now down below and pullin' on my shirt
Yeah I've got some kids of my own
Well if I had one wish for you in this god forsaken world kid
It'd be that your mistakes will be your own
That your sins will be your own

It's been a long time comin', my dear
It's been a long time comin', but now it's here
And now it's here

Well out 'neath the arms of Cassiopeia
Where the sword of Orion sweeps
Well it's me and you Rosie cracklin' like crossed wires
You breathin' in your sleep
You breathin' in your sleep

Well there's just a spark of a campfire left burnin'
Two kids in a sleeping bag beside
I reach beneath your shirt put my hands across your belly and feel
Another one kickin' inside
And I ain't gonna fuck it up this time

It's been a long time comin', my dear
It's been a long time comin', but now it's here
It's been a long time comin', my dear
It's been a long time comin', but now it's here
And now it's here
