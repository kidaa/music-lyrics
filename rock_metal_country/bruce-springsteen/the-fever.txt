When I get home from my job I turn on my T.V.
But I can't keep my mind on the show
When I lay down at night, oh I can't get no sleep
So I turn on my radio
But the only sound I hear is you whisperin' in my ear
The words that you used to say
Now my days grow longer
'Cause my love grows stronger
And the fever gets worse 
And I've got the fever for this girl

CHORUS
Got the fever, oh I've got the fever
Nothing that a po' boy can do
When he's got the fever for this girl
Got the fever, oh I've got the fever
Left this little boy blue

I can remember comin' home
See you standin' at the stove
With the dishes on the table
Dinner ready to go
We'll maybe go out to a movie show
Something that you like to see
Well now you are my sun in the morning
And my moon at night
I think about you baby
I feel alright
Now my days grow longer
'Cause my love grows stronger
And the fever gets worse
And I've got the fever for this girl

CHORUS
