Taxicab, taxicab at the light
Won't you take me on a ride
Through this city at night
I got some money and I'm feelin' fine
I ain't no hurry so just take your time

Some people wanna die young and gloriously
Well taxicab driver, hey that ain't me
I got a cute little baby
down at 12th and Vine
And she opens for business just about closin' time

Ah hey hey, ah hey hey
City at night, city at night

I don't believe what I see in this street
I don't know how they can take the heat
Well baby I'm a liar, I'm a cheat
And I don't care
I got my money, I can't take my fare

I'm ridin' tonight, I'm on my way
C'mon baby...
I can take it or live it, when it comes
Got my baby by the light of the sun
You know she brings it with her and then she comes

Hey, hey, city at night
Hey, hey, city at night
Ride on
