Sick at heart and lonely
Deep in dark despair
Thinking one thought only
Where is she, tell me where
And if she says to you
She don't love me
Just give here my message
Tell her of my plea

And I know, if she had me back again
I would never make her sad
I got a heart......full of soul

And I know....

She's been gone such a long time
Longer than I can bear
But if she says she wants me
Tell her that I'll be there
And if she says to you
She don't love me
Just give her my message
Tell her my plea

And I know......
