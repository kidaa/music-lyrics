Oh Baby Doll
They tried to tell me you were deaf and dumb
But I knew they were wrong
You're just a silent one

Oh Baby Doll
They tried to tell me you could not feel
But I found out they tried to conceal
From you, that you were a woman

Well they brought you into their laboratory
And tried to get you to show and tell
They wanted to hear you say that you were sorry
And then they told you that you were conceived in hell

But Baby Doll, you knew
you knew that wasn't true
you knew that it was them
it wasn't you

Oh baby doll
It was so hard to know you
I could not tell, I couldn't show you
But I didn't have to, 'cause you already knew

Oh baby doll
They had to see by touching hands
We had to dance to a silent band
and you surprised me, being so graceful

I know you can't hear these songs I sing
But then they're more for me than they are for you
Because you don't need these songs, babe, like I do
Yeah, you knew the first time that I held you babe
You didn't have to hear how I love

Oh baby doll
They tried to tell me you were deaf and dumb
But I knew that they were wrong
And you were just the lonely one
