Oh Billy stares at Cherry in the hall
And walks out into the rain so blessed and tall
Standin' on the corner with a gun underneath his coat
Beneath the stars on the street
Oh on Lexington Avenue they stand
Velvet aces they case the promised land
Reachin' out across the hoods with both hands
Oh, tryin' to catch a ride

Tonight we're lovers in the cold
Running past the graveyards in the snow
Walking in the street with nowhere to go
And it's no, no, no

Oh and the getaway driver waits outside the store
He pulls away just as Billy runs out the door
Oh and Billy won't run anymore, no, no, no

Oh baby I can't lay the stars at your feet
Oh but I think we could take it all, just you and me
Oh come on, you'll see, there's a lot of room
For you baby, in this front seat

Tonight we're lovers on that road in the snow
Running past the graveyards in the snow
Walking in the street with nowhere to go
And it's oh, oh, oh
