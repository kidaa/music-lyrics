I found me a little girl and I settled down
in a pretty little town
we got married and promised never to part
then I fell victim to a restless heart
and I feel like I'm driving a stolen car
through a pitchblack night and I'm doing my best
to make it through, and I'm just sitting down here at the Staton light
I want to get caught but I never do

At first I thought it was just restlessness
that would fade as time went by
and our love grew deep
but in the end it was something more I guess
that tore us apart and made her weak
And I'm driving a stolen car
through a pitch-black night
I keep telling myself
everything's going to be alright
but I drive by night
and I travel in fear
that in this darkness
I might just disappear.

She asked if I remembered the letters I wrote
when our love was young and we were bold
she said she read those letters last night
and they made her feel 100 years old
there's a river that runs by that little town,
down into the sea
it was there in the shade I laid my body down
as she flowed on so effortlessly
now there'll be dancing tonight down at county line,
there'll be a party out at seven trees
and from these banks I can see those party lights shine
maybe she's there, maybe she's looking for me.

Last night I dreamed I made the call
I swore to return to stay forever more
once again we stood on the wedding steps at Victory Hall
and walked arm in arm through the chapel door
I can remember how good I felt inside
when the preacher said son you may kiss the bride
but as I leaned over to touch those pretty lips
I felt it all slip away through my fingertips
and I'm driving a stolen car
through a pitchblack night
I keep telling myself
everything's going to be allright
but I ride by night and I travel in fear
no matter what I do or where I drive
nobody ever sees me when I ride by.
