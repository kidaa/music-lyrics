41 shots....
and we'll take that ride
'cross this bloody river 
to the other side 
41 shots... cut through the night 
You're kneeling over his body in the vestibule 
Praying for his life 

Is it a gun, is it a knife 
Is it a wallet, this is your life 
It ain't no secret 
It ain't no secret 
No secret my friend 
You can get killed just for living
In your American skin

Lena gets her son ready for school 
She says "on these streets, Charles 
You've got to understand the rules 
If an officer stops you
Promise you'll always be polite, 
that you'll never ever run away
Promise Mama you'll keep your hands in sight"

Is it a gun, is it a knife 
Is it a wallet, this is your life 
It ain't no secret 
It ain't no secret 
No secret my friend 
You can get killed just for living
In your American skin 

Is it a gun, is it a knife 
Is it in your heart, is it in your eyes
It ain't no secret 

41 shots... and we'll take that ride 
'Cross this bloody river
To the other side 
41 shots... got my boots caked in this mud 
We're baptized in these waters and in each other's blood 

Is it a gun, is it a knife 
Is it a wallet, this is your life 
It ain't no secret 
It ain't no secret 
No secret my friend 
You can get killed just for living
In your American skin
