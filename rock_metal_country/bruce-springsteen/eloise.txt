Well what power of God does a nun use
to hold a parish priest
And what makes a good cop
let go a beautiful thief
Oh and how does a queen know
She got hold that man with honey
Oh and what makes an old woman
Give a young man all her money

Well, late in the night
'neath that pale moon light
that power comes over me
And it's old Eloise
