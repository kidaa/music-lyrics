I was out driving, just taking it slow
Looked at my tank it was reading low
Pulled in an Exxon station out on Highway One
Look out!
Help up without a gun
Help up without a gun
Help up without a gun

Some damn fool with a guitar walks in off the street
aint got nowhere to go, aint got nothing to eat
a man with a cigar says "sign here son"
watch out
Help up without a gun
Help up without a gun

Now it's a sin and it oughta be a crime
You know it happens buddy all the time
If I don't break the limit tryin' to have a little fun
Help up without a gun
Help up without a gun
Help up without a gun
Help up without a gun
