Well I found a little girl and I settled down
In a pretty little house in a pretty little town
We got married and promised never to part
Then little by little we drifted from each other's heart
Now I'm drivin' a stolen car on a pitch-black night
And I'm doin' my best to make it through

Well I'm just sittin' down here at the Stanton light
I wanna get caught but I never do
At first I thought it was just restlessness
That would fade as time went by and our love grew deep
But in the end it was something more, I guess
That tore us apart and made us weep
And I'm driving a stolen car waitin' on that little red light
I keep tellin' myself everything's gonna be alright
But I ride by night and I travel in fear
That in this darkness I might just disappear

She asked if I remembered the letters I wrote
When our love was young and we were bold
She said last night she read those letters
And they made her feel a hundred years old

There's a river that runs by that little town
Down into the sea
It was there in the shade I laid my body down
As she flowed on so effortlessly
Now there's a party tonight out at County Line
There'll be dancing down at Seven Trees
From these banks I can see those party lights shine
Mayby she's there, mayby she's looking for me

Last night I dreamed I made the call
I swore to return and stay forever
Once again we stood on the wedding steps at Victory Hall
And walked arm in arm through the chapel door
I can remember how good I felt inside
When the preacher said "Son, you may kiss the bride"
But as I leaned over to touch here pretty lipps
I felt itt all slip away through my fingertips
And I'm driving a stolen car through a pitch-black night
I keep tellin' myself everything's gonna be alright
But I ride by night and I travel in fear
No matter what I do or wher I drive
Nobody ever sees me when I ride by
