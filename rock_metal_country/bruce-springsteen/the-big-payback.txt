I bought a scooter and I rented a shack
Out in the sun, by the railroad track
I got a job and I'm a-breakin' my back
Workin' and workin' for the big payback

I keep a puttin' and a puttin' out
I keep a sweatin' like a hog and all
I work so long that I'm a losin' track
I work so long that I'm a losin' track
Waitin', waitin' on the big payback

Well, it's a wham, bam, thank you ma'am, god damn, ring out Sam
I took on that train rumblin' down this track
They got your neck in the noose, you're draggin' long in back
Chasin' and chasin' the big payback

Oh what my foreman does well I don't know
He just throws me a shovel and yells "Go, Bobby, Go"
Oh well-a all day long he's just a busy wise crack
While I'm sweatin' and sweatin' the big payback

Well, it's a wham, bam, thank you ma'am, god damn, ring out Sam
I took on that train rumblin' down the track
They got your neck in the noose, your hands are tied up in back
And you're a-workin' and workin' for the big payback

I quit that job, and Mister I ain't goin' back
Got me a knife and she's a long and bad
I'll tell you how I make the peace with that man
Down in the alley of the big payback

I go a wham, bam, thank you ma'am, god damn, c'mon man
You're a goin' to that train rumblin' down this track
I got your neck in the noose and I don't give a damn, Jack
I'm on that long lost highway of the big payback
I'm on that long lost highway of the big payback
I'm on that long lost highway of the big payback
