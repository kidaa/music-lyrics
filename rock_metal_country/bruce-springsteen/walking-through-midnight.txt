Well I've been walking through midnight
And there's no trace of dawn
I'm stuck in this moonlight
It's leading me on
My body's on fire
And I can't stand the pain
This burning desire
I feel once again

Now I'm fighting with madness
As I move down the street
Surrounded by sadness
I can't take this heat
The streetlamps are glowing
Like coals in the mist
Their lights keep me moving
I just can't resist

Now there's peace in this valley
But none in my mind
Like a drunk in an alley
I'm stumbling blind
With no destination
At an unholy speed
I must keep on moving
Try to walk off this need
