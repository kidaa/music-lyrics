Sandy the fireworks are hailin' over Little Eden tonight 
Forcin' a light into all those stoney faces left stranded on this warm July 
Down in town the circuit's full with switchblade lovers so fast, so shiny, so sharp 
As the wizards play down on Pinball Way on the boardwalk way past dark 
And the boys from the casino dance with their shirts open like Latin lovers on the shore 
Chasin' all them silly New York virgins by the score 

Sandy, the aurora is risin' behind us 
This pier lights our carnival life forever 
Love me tonight for I may never see you again 
Hey Sandy girl, my baby

Now the greasers they tramp the streets or get busted for sleeping on the beach all night 
Them boys in their high heels, ah Sandy, their skins are so white 
And me I just got tired of hangin' in them dusty arcades bangin' them pleasure machines 
Chasin' the factory girls underneath the boardwalk where they promise to unsnap their jeans 
And you know that tilt-a-whirl down on the south beach drag 
I got on it last night and my shirt got caught 
And they kept me spinnin' 
I didn't think I'd ever get off

Oh Sandy, the aurora is risin' behind us 
This pier lights our carnival life on the water 
Runnin', laughin' 'neath the boardwalk with the boss's daughter 
I remember, Sandy girl, now baby

Sandy, that waitress I was seeing lost her desire for me 
I spoke with her last night, she said she won't set themselves on fire for me anymore 
She worked that joint under the boardwalk, she was always the girl you saw boppin' down on the beach with the radio 
The kids say last night she was dressed like a star in one of them cheap little seaside bars, 
and I saw her parked with Loverboy out on the Kokomo 
Did you hear the cops finally busted Madame Marie for tellin' fortunes better than they do 
For me this boardwalk life for me is through 
You ought to quit this scene too

Sandy, the aurora is rising behind us 
This pier lights our carnival life forever 
Oh love me tonight and I promise I'll love you forever
