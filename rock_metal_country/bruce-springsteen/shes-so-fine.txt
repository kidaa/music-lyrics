Hey baby
Well she's vicious as a razor
Resting on your mainline
She's brutal as an ace
Laid on the table at just the right time
She's like a devil-woman
But she's locked in over-drive
Her eyes are cold stone
But she's backed by a power-glide
She's sweet, she's educated
She knows about history, geometry
She's so fine

Oh she says I ain't got the love
I ain't got the time
Ain't gonna give you no kiss
Ain't gonna hand ya
All I want's a ride, Sweet William
All I want's a ride
And it's oh baby, oh baby
Won't you come, don't you wanna go for a ride?
I'll get in my car and burn it up
Now switch on the radio and turn it up
And we're gonna be burning down a straight load
I want some love and I got to truck along

Well she's vicious as a razor
Resting on your mainline
She's brutal as an ace
Laid on the table at just the right time
She's like a devil-woman
But she's locked in over-drive
Her eyes are cold stone
But she's backed by a power-glide
She's so educated
She's got a nice mama, she got a nice pop
She's so fine

Oh and the boys say she swings a silver rod
The kids call her angel
Some kids call her god down on Lover's Lane
Be my baby
Won't you be my lover
Come on baby
I said hey baby
