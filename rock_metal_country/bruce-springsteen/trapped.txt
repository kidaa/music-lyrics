Well it seems like I'm caught up in your trap again
And it seems like I'll be wearin' the same ol' chains
Good will conquer evil and the truth will set you free
Then I know someday I'll find the key
Then I know somewhere I'll find the key
Well it seem like I've been playin' the game way too long
And it seems the game I played has made you strong
Well when the game is over, I won't walk out a loser
And I know that I'll walk out of here again
And I know that someday I'll walk out of here again

But now I'm trapped...Oh yeah!
Trapped...Oh yeah yeah!
Trapped...Oh yeah!
Trapped...Oh yeah!

Now it seems like I've been sleepin' in your bed too long
And it seems like you've been meanin' to do me harm
But I'll teach my eyes to see beyond these walls in front of me
And someday I'll walk out of here again
Yeah I know someday I'll walk out of here again

Chorus

Well it seem like I've been playin' the game way too long
And it seems the game I played has made you strong

Because I'm trapped...Oh yeah!
Trapped...Oh yeah yeah!
Trapped...Oh yeah yeah!
Trapped...Oh yeah!

I'm trapped...Oh yeah yeah!
Trapped...Oh yeah yeah
Trapped...Oh yeahhhhhh
Trapped....oh yeahhhh
I'm trapped.
