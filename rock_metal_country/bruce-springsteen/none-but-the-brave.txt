Tonight down on Union Street
I'm thinkin' back, baby, to you and me
To the way you used to be
And your words come back to me
From passing cars
Their voices sing out
In empty bars where guitars ring out
We'd be the lucky one to get out

You said, None baby but the brave
No one baby but the brave
Oh strong enough to save something
From what they gave
None baby but the brave
No one baby but the brave

Now in dreams these nights I see you my friend
The way you were back then
Ah, on a night like this
I know that girl no longer exists
Except for a moment in some stranger's eyes
Or in a nameless girl
In cars rushin' by
That's where I find you tonight
And in my heart it still survives
To none, baby, but the brave
No one baby but the brave

Oh strong enough to save
Something from the love they gave
Yeah, none baby but the brave
No one baby but the brave
Now tonight once more I search
Every face on that crowded floor
Looking for I don't know what for
Something that ain't there no more
There's a girl standin' by the band
She reminds me of you
And I asked her to danceAs the drummer counts his play
I take her hand and we move away

And tonight, now I'll see old friends
caught in things they got no chance to win
Just gettin' beaten, and then playin' again
'Till their strength gives out
Or their hearts give in
Who's that man who thinks
he can decide whose dreams will live
And whose shall be pushed aside
Did he ever walk down this streets at night
And looked into the eyes
Baby, of none, baby, but the brave

No one baby but the brave
No, none baby but the brave
No one baby but the brave
No one baby,no one but the brave
