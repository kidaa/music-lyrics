When you dance
I hear the music rocking everywhere
When you dance
I see the lights shining through your hair
When you dance
The band is blowing like a hurricane
When you dance
You look so fine but you don't know my name

Come near baby, don't be afraid
Just one taste won't do
I can't hold back one more day
Sugar I know I got to dance with you

When you dance
Your smile ain't hiding what you're thinking of
When you dance
Your body trembles like you're making love
When you move, baby
My soul is aching and my blood runs hot
Run into me now
My heart is breaking, shaking what you got

Come near baby, don't be afraid
Just one taste won't do
I can't hold back one more day
Sugar I know I got to dance with you

Shake 'em down now

Come near baby, don't be afraid
Just one taste won't do
I can't hold back one more day
Sugar I know I got to dance with you

Oh yeah baby
When you dance
I hear the music rocking everywhere
When you dance, baby
This time you tumble, honey, I don't care
When you dance
