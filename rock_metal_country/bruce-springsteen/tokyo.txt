The moon hung like a shadow on a rung over Shanghai
And the soldier boys were returning home screaming "Bonzai!"
And the kids are still playing their games,
Getting hustled and rustled out in the rain
As I sat inside listening to the broadcast.
Oh save my soul sweet rock and roll 'cuz I'm sinking fast.

And then the band played.
Out of nowhere
Everybody
Everybody

Well now the legendary chaplain of the fighting 51st
Was getting ready to go.
I said "Padre do you know a cheap virgin who likes to tango?"
He said "You can try Linda Lee;
Around the corner and across the sea.
Oh word is out, word is out she's fast."
Oh blow me down now Linda, 'cuz I'm sinking fast.

Yes and them cats are sure getting fat down in the trainyard.
And the sandman brings them dreams they ship out in boxcars.
The union says hold; break out the dice, break out the gold.
It's lunchtime at last.
And old big mama said George Raff's tonight on the late show.
She sits straddling the kitchen chair really gung-ho
She shivers with chills, wet with slotcar thrills
Hypnotically lost in the glass

And we all sighed...
With the sunrise
As we watched the credits pass.
And the little blue dot went away.

And then the morning cloak fell down like a hoax over sleepytown
And garbage truck Big Lenny's out drinking the last round
He hurriedly sipped his beer, and poking fun of the queer
And threatened to kick his ass.

And the bell rang
And the horn blows
And he's outside pumping gas
But things were moving so slow tonight
So the kid goes back inside the station
And turns on the radio to his local AM station

And the band played
Right on the radio
It's on the radio
And he listened to the bass line
And the boys in the band sang
Whoa, whoa whoa-wo
Whoa, whoa whoa-wo
They're so excited about it
Whoa, whoa whoa-wo
Everybody alright
Whoa, whoa whoa-wo
And the band played
Whoa, whoa whoa-wo
and the band played
Whoa, whoa whoa-wo
Everybody
Whoa, whoa whoa-wo
