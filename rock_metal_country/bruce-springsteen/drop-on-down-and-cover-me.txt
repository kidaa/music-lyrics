Times are tough there baby there
It's getting tougher now
This world is rough honey it's
Just getting rougher now

Their on top there baby
Just tryin' to score-well
Seen enough, honey I don't
Wanna see no more
Drop on down and cover me
On down and cover me

Sometimes girl I just wanna
Leave it all behind us, yeah
Hold me in your arms tonight let's
Let our love blind us, yeah

Inside I feel the pain that
The hatred and the sorrow
I wanna shut the light, baby
C'mon and shut the door
Drop on down and cover me
On down and cover

I just wanna close my eyes and
Let your love surround me
I wanna close my heart to
To this world around me

The anger and the heartlessness
All the good things guilty
Come closer baby
Now-closer still now
Drop on down and cover me
On down and cover me
