beginning cut ...kissed the babysitter
She screamed and I told her it was just the beast in me
And on my way out of the house I shot out my TV
I went down to the corner luncheonette and said
Sally "fried peanut butter and banana will do?" I'm turning into Elvis and there's nothing I can do

I threw out my wife and family I took off my wedding ring
I told my friends and neighbors to refer to me now as "King"
I put a chainlink fence around my ranch house and on the gate
a sign that reads "Graceland II"
I'm turning into Elvis and there's nothing I can do

I visited my mama's grave and I headed out to Hollywood and I signed a picture with MGM I play a rebellious beachboy racecar driver who fucks a nun in the end
In the last scene I whip out my big guitar
and show her a little Memphis-style kung-fu
I'm turning into Elvis and there's nothing I can do

But I drove on straight to Vegas and I stopped in the first old stripper bar
Found me a little hooker that looked just like Ann-Margaret
and we rumba'd in my sports car
Well me and my drinking buddies turned my lovin' home into a frikkin' zoo
I'm turning into Elvis and there's nothing I can do

Well he came to me last night in a dream looking just like he did in '57
He said "Son that guitar is a wonderful thing but it can be the living devils' friend
On the other hand there's sex-starved women,
millions of dollars, and anything you want to do."
