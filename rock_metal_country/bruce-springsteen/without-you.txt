Monday, I go to work
Tuesday, can't find my shirt
Wednesday, I'm feeling blue
I'm helpless, darling
Without you, without you
Without you, without you
Thursdays, everything's fine
Friday, I'm out of my mind
Saturday, Sunday too

It's hopeless, darling
Without you, without you
Without you, without you

Each and every night of the week
I toss and turn in my sleep
Worrying if you're all right
Wondering where you are tonight

Monday, I go to work
Tuesday, can't find my shirt
Wednesday, I'm feelin' blue

I'm helpless, darlin'
Without you, without you
Without you, without you
Thursdays, everything's fine

Each and every night of the week
I toss and turn in my sleep
Worrying if you're all right
Wondering where you are tonight

Monday, I go to work
Tuesday, can't find my shirt
Wednesday, I'm feelin' blue

I'm helpless, darlin'
Without you, without you
Without you, without you
Thursdays, everything's fine
Friday, I'm out of my mind
Saturday, Sunday too

It's hopeless, darlin'
Without you, without you
Without you, without you
