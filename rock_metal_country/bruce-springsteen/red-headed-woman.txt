Well brunettes are fine man
And blondes are fun
But when it comes to getting a dirty job done

I'll take a red headed woman
A red headed woman
It takes a red headed woman
To get a dirty job done

Well listen up stud
Your life's been wasted
Til you've got down on your knees and tasted

A red headed woman
A red headed woman
It takes a red headed woman
To get a dirty job done

Tight skirt, strawberry hair
Tell me what you've got, baby, waiting under there

Big green eyes that look like, son
They can see every cheap thing that you ever done

Well, I don't know how many girls you dated, man
But you ain't lived til you've had your tires rotated

By a red headed woman
A red headed woman
It takes a red headed woman
To get a dirty job done
