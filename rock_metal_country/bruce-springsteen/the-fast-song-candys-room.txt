The night rushes in through the door
Kids running across the floor
Those guys aim it'll tear this town down
And blow it into the sea
Man that's alright with me
'Cause I don't care anymore

She, she who is everything
The fever that she brings
She's got everything
And I've got caught
Wasting my life so bad
Just looking for the facts
Sometimes I
Feel like I'm walking dazed
The blood rushes in my veins
I can hear it flow
She lives in a world of dreams come true
But she don't know like I do
Not like I do
'Cause I was nothing
Over and over again
Alone when the nights roll in, without her
She's a miracle in diamond rings
She has men who bring her anything she wants
But they don't see
That what she wants is me
Oh and I want her so
I'll never let her go
Me, walking in the room
Alone when the nights roll in
Without her, without her, without her
