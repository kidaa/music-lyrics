Gray morning sky 
Splits through the shade 
Another day come 
More time to make 
Kids growing up 
Cat's getting fatter 
Lying here with you 
Nothing else matters 

Work hard 
Keep your eyes on the prize 
Wake up 
From the minute you open your eyes
Every muscle 
In your body hurts 
Stop praying for things to get better
Pray they don't get worse 
They don't get worse 

Another thin line 
I don't dare cross 
Another home game 
Another close loss 
Yeah, we'll get by 
We'll get by 
Baby, we'll get by 

The work week 
Time to move on 
Another heartache 
Another dream gone 
A cold day 
Ain't no sun 
No use complaining 
Gotta get the job done 

Yeah, another thin line 
I don't dare cross 
Another home game 
Another close loss 
Yeah, we'll get by 
We'll get by 
Baby, we'll get by 

Well it ain't us ? 
Up on the stocks ? 
I stand below 
You sit pretty on top 
How long 
Before it's my turn 
The bottom line is 
that souls do burn 
souls do burn 
souls do burn 

Money's all gone 
Nothing in the bank 
Somebody gets sick 
Family closes rank 
Before you know it 
Christmas is here 
You wake up 
And it's a new year 
A new year 

Another thin line 
I don't dare cross 
Another home game 
Another close loss 
Yeah, we'll get by 
We'll get by 
Baby, we'll get by
