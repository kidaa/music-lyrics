I ain't lookin' for just excitement
Baby that's just a fact
If you want to get to het heart
You better let her know just where you're at

CHORUS
It ain't written in the sky above
No fortune-teller told me this
You gotta tell her that you love her
Tell her that you need her
And give the girl a great big kiss
Give the girl a great big kiss

Now if you're such a fool you think
It don't matter, baby, what you say
maybe you better tell her how you're feelin'
It ain't gonna happen any other way

CHORUS

Now baby all I wanna do
Is darlin' make sweet love to you

Now I don't know what the meanin' is
Why you wanna hide the things you feel and say
But baby it's just a natural fact
Love was never meant to be that way

CHORUS

Now baby all I wanna do
Is darlin' make sweet love to you
