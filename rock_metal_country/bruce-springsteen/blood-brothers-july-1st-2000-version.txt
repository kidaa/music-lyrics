We played king of the mountain out on the end
The world come chargin' up the hill, and we were women and men
Now there's so much that time, time and memory fade away
We got our own roads to ride and chances we gotta take
We stood side by side each one fightin' for the other
We said until we died we'd always be blood brothers

Now the hardness of this world slowly grinds your dreams away
Makin' a fool's joke out of the promises we make
And what once seemed black and white turns to so many shades of gray
We lose ourselves in work to do and bills to pay
And it's a ride, ride, ride, and there ain't much cover
With no one runnin' by your side my blood brother

On through the houses of the dead past those fallen in their tracks
Always movin' ahead and never lookin' back
Now I'm out here on this road 
Alone on this road tonight 
[I] close my eyes and feel so many 
friends around me 
In the early evening light 
And the miles we have come 
And the battles won and lost 
Are just so many roads traveled 
So many rivers crossed 
And I ask God for the strength 
And faith in one another 
'Cause it's a good night for a ride 
'Cross this river to the other side 
My blood brothers
