Times were tough love was not enough
So you said sorry Johnny I'm gone gone gone
You said my act was funny 
But we both knew what was missing honey
So you let out on your own
Now that pretty form that you've got baby
Will make sure you get along
But you're gonna find our someday honey

When You're alone you're alone
When You're alone you're alone
When You're alone you're alone
When You're alone you ain't nothing but alone

Now I was young and pretty on the mean streets of the dity

And I fought to make'em my home
With just the shirt on my back I left and swore I'd never look back
And man I was gone gone gone
But there's things that'll knock you down you don't even see coming
And send you crawling like a baby back home
You're gonna find out that day sugar

When you're alone...

I knew some day your runnin' would be through
And you'd think back on me and you
And your love would be strong
You'd forget all the bad and think only of all the laughs that we had

And you'd wanna come home
Now it ain't hard feelings or nothin' sugar
That ain't what's got me singing this song
It's just nobody knows baby where love goes
But when it goes it's gone gone

When you're alone...
