I was there
When you needed someone
Look now baby
And see what we have undone
Oh I did most of the talking
But you were the one who lied

Bye bye baby
Our love is tumbling down
I can't be hanging around
Love on the wrong side of town
Oh baby

You were gone
When I needed you by my side
There was no one
To dry the tears from my eyes
Oh you were the one who cheated
But I was the one who cried

Bye bye baby
Our love is tumbling down
I can't be hanging around
Love on the wrong side of town

Bye bye baby
Out love is tumbling down
I can't be hanging around
Love on the wrong side of town

Bye bye baby
Love on the wrong side of town
Bye bye baby
Bye bye darling
Bye bye baby
