Princess Di did find another man
Prince Charles may want to live as a tampon in another woman's
underpants
I know what he feels like
I've been there too
But there'll never be any other for me but you

Will Elizibeth Taylor get married again buddy, that's the question
Poor Larry Fortenski got busted on his harly for illegal weapons
possession
I've been that down, I've been that crazy
I've been that much of a fool
But there'll never be any other for me but you

man, a love that's real
is a love that's hard
like a pit bull on your ass, in a very small back yard
a love that's hard can be a love that's true
but I swear there'll never be any other for me but you

Elvis and Priscilla
Jim Baker and Tammy Fay
Donald and Ivana once swore their love forever and a day
I said those words yes, I meant 'em too
but I swear there'll never be any other for me but you
no baby, there'll never be any other for me but you
