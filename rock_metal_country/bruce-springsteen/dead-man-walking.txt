There's a pale horse comin'
And I'm gonna ride it
I'll rise in the morning
With my fate beside it

I'm a dead man walking
I'm a dead man walking

In Saint james Parish
I was born and Christened
How I've got my story
Well Mister, there ain't no need
for you to listen
It's just a dead man talkin'

I had a job, I had a girl
But between our dreams
and action lie this world

Well, in the deep forest
Theur blood and tears rushed over me

All I could feel was the drugs
and the shotgun
And my fear up inbside me

Like a dead man talkin'

Beneath the summer sky
my eyes went black
Sister, I won't ask for forgiveness,
my sins are all I have

Tonight the clouds above my prison
Move slowly 'cross the sky
There is a new day comin'
And my dreams are full tonight.
