There's a code of silence, 
that we don't dare speak 
There's a wall between us 
So high and so deep 
We keep pretending that there's nothing wrong 
And there's a code of silence that can't go wrong 

Cause the truth's so elusive 
So elusive you see 
That it ain't enough baby, 
To bridge the distance between you and me 
Well, there's a list of grievance a hundred miles long 
There's a code of silence and it can't go on 

Well you walk with your eyes open,
but your lips they remain sealed
All the promises we made are broken 
fearing the truth and feeling the fear 
Now, I need to know now darlin', need to know what's going on

So come on, come on, come on, come on 
come on, come on, come on 

Well you walk with your eyes open, but your lips they remained sealed
All the promises we made are broken 
With the truth fearing revealed 
Now, I need to know now darlin', need to know what's going on 

Come on, come on, come on, come on 
Come on, come on, come on, come on 
Come on, come on, come on, come on 
Come on, come on, come on 

There's a code of silence, that we don't dare speak 
There's a wall between us, so high and so deep 
We keep pretending that there's nothing wrong 
There's a code of silence, and it can't go on 

And it can't go on, and it can't go on 
And it can't go on, and it can't go on
