Once I thought I knew
Everything I needed to know about you
Your sweet whisper, your tender touch
But I didn't really know that much
The joke's on me, but it's gonna be okay
If I can just get through this lonesome day
Lonesome day

Hell's brewing, dark sun's on the rise
This storm'll blow through by and by
House is on fire, viper's in the grass
A little revenge and this too shall pass
This too shall pass, darling
Yeah I'm gonna pray
Right now, all I got's this lonesome day
Lonesome Day

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, yeah
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, yeah
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, yeah
It's alright, it's alright

Better ask questions before you shoot
Deceit and betrayal's bitter fruit
It's hard to swallow come time to pay
That taste on your tongue don't easily slip away
Let kingdom come, I'm gonna find my way
Yeah, through this lonesome day
Lonesome day
Lonesome day
Lonesome day

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, yeah
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, yeah
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, yeah
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, yeah
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, yeah
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, yeah

Lonesome day
Lonesome day
Lonesome day
