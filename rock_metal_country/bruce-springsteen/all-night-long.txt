I was born saved in heaven
It was nothing like the promised land
Raised in a good Christian house
Underneath a good Christian hand
I was schooled down and dirty
Signed a note back to town
It was there that the workers slaved all week
Waiting for payday to come around

Break out, come on if you're coming
Cause baby I just can't stay
I want to take out the walls of this joint
I want to blow this town away

Now I ain't into fast livin'
I ain't into dying young
And I ain't looking to be forgiven
For any of the stupid things that I've done

For the ones who once had a notion
A notion it was good to be alive
Feel the spark, the rush of emotion
I want to break out baby tonight

I want to dream, that I got a place
I want to scream in somebody's face
Make it seem, get out of this muddy race
All night long

Well all little kings lose their thrones tonight
All you little pretty things better learn to sleep alone tonight
It was down in the cool dirty living
With the man with the master plan
Some girl who can beg forgiveness
And a ticket to the promised land

Down where they'll tear your guts out
Making out what you're all about
making while we were blasting like a ??
I want out I want out I want out

Want out to the outside
Well I'm a small fool
I want to shout I'm bound for nothing
I want to shout about something too

For the ones who once had a notion
It ain't no sin to be glad you're alive
I feel the heat, the rush of devotion
I want to tear out baby tonight

I wanna do what ain't ever been done
I wanna win what ain't ever been won
I wanna lose blow it all away
I wanna lose what I've always won
Prove it all night long

I wanna know that I got a place
I wanna go where I can see your face
I wanna rock the roof off this place
I want you to know
I wanna live
