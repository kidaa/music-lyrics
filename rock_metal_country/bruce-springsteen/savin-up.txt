You may have diamonds
You may have pearls
You may think you got it baby
Over all the other girls
But honey you ain't got nothing
And I'll tell you why
If you're empty as a soul can be, baby
Deep down inside

You better start savin' up
For the things that money can't buy
You better start savin' up
For the things that money can't buy
You better start savin' up
For the things that money can't buy
You better start savin' up
For the things that money can't buy

You may have a big backyard
And ruby rings
And my love's just a second-place runner, honey
To your fancy things
But what you got to hold on to
When the lights go down
You come lookin' for me baby
But I ain't nowhere around

You better start savin' up
For the things that money can't buy
You better start savin' up
For the things that money can't buy
You better start

You need a strong man, baby
To love and understand you
A man who ain't afraid, sugar
To get some dirt on his hands for you
And when you're feeling so down-hearted
And all you wanna do is cry
Ah, just come on, take my hand, baby
Together you and I

We could start savin' up
For the things that money can't buy
We'd better start savin' up
For the things that money can't buy
You better start savin' up
For the things that money can't buy
You better start savin' up
For the things that money can't buy
