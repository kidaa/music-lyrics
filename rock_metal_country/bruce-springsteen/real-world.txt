Mister trouble come walkin' this way
Year gone past feels like one long day
But I'm alive and I'm feelin' all right
Well I run that hard road outta heartbreak city
Built a roadside carnival out of hurt and self-pity
It was all wrong well now I'm movin' on

CHORUS
Ain't no church bells ringing
Ain't no flags unfurled
Just me and you and  the love we're bringing
Into the real world
Into the real world

I built a shrine in my heart it wasn't pretty to see
Made out of fool's gold memory and tears cried

Now I'm headin' over the rise
I'm searchin' for one clear moment of love and truth
I still got a little faith
But what I need is some proof tonight
I'm lookin' for it in your eyes

CHORUS

Well tonight I just wanna shout
I feel my soul waist deep and sinkin'
Into this black river of doubt
I just wanna rise and walk along the riverside
And when the morning comes baby I don't wanna hide
I'll stand right at your side with my arms open wide

Well tonight I just wanna shout

I feel my soul waist deep and sinkin'
Into this black river of doubt
I just wanna rise and walk along the riverside
'Til the morning comes
I'll stand right by your side

I wanna find some answers I wanna ask for some help
I'm tired of runnin' scared
Baby let's get our bags packed
We'll take it here to hell and heaven and back
And if love ois hopeless hopeless at best
Come on put on your party dress it's ours tonight
And we're goin' with the tumblin' dice

CHORUS
