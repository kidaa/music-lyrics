Boom boom boom boom
I wanna shoot you right down
Take you in my arms
I'm in love with you
a love that is true
Boom boom boom boom

I need you right now
I mean right now
I don't mean tomorrow
I mean right now
come on come on
I wanna give it up babe

Shake it up babe
Come on and shake
Shake it up babe
Come on come on shake it up babe

I like the way you walk
I like the way you talk
when you walk that walk
and you talk that talk
you knock me out
right over my feet

Shake it up babe
Come on and shake
Shake it up babe
Come on come on shake it up babe

Boom boom boom boom
I wanna shoot you right down
Take you in my arms
I'm in love with you
a love that is true
Boom boom boom boom
