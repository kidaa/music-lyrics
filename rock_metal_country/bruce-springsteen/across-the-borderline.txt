There's a place, so I've been told,
Every street is paved with gold
And it's just across the borderline
And when it's time to take your turn
There's a lesson that you must learn
You may lose more than you'll ever hope to find.

chorus
And when you reach that broken promised land
And all your dreams slip though your hand
You have learned it's too late to change your mind
Cause you pay the price to come so far
Just to wind up where you are
And you're still just across the borderline.

Up and down The Rio Grande
A thousand foot prints in the sand
Reveal a secret no one can define
The river rolls on like a breath
In between our life and death
Tell me who is next to cross that borderline.

chorus
And when you reach that broken promised land
And all your dreams slip though your hand
You'll know it's too late to change your mind
Cause you pay the price to come so far
Just to wind up where you are
And you're still just across the borderline.

In Spanish speaking countries Bruce often sings a part in Spanish: 

hay un lugar donde me han dicho,
todas las calles son hechas de oro
al otro lado de la frontera
Y cuando te toca debes apernder una leccion
podrias perder las que nunca esperabas encontrar
Y cuando llegas al paraiso descrito
donde los suenos se te caen de las manos
sabras que es tarde para cambiar tus deseos
Porque pagaste tanto para llegar tan lejos
solo para terminar en esta tierra
al otro lado de la frontera
