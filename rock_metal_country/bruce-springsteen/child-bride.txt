Well sometimes I dream of getting out of here
Heading down towards them old tracks
I swore I'd come and get there
But I know I ain't never going back

There's nights I can't sleep
No matter how hard I try
So from my window I watch the moonlight
Fall on the far hillside

I imagine I put on my jacket
Go down to this little roadside bar

Pick a stranger and spin around the dance floor
To a Mexican guitar
