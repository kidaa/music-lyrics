Rainy night down in the engine house
Sleepin' just as still as a mouse
A man came along and chase us out in the rain
Well was that a vigilante man?

Stormy days, we pass the time away
Sleeping in some good warm place
A cop come along we give him a little race
Say was that a vigilante man?

Well tell me why does a vigilante man
Tell me why does a vigilante man
Carry that sawed off shotgun in his hands
To shoot his brothers and sisters down that no good vigilante man

Well I ramble around from town to town
Yeah I ramble around from town to town
Yeah and they run us around like a wild herd of cattle lord
is that your vigilante man?

Well tell me why does a vigilante man
Tell me why does a vigilante man
Carry that club in his hands
Would he beat an innocent man down that no good vigilante man
