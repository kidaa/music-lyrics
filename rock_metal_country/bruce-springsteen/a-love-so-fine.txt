Well there's sparklin' angels on your fire-escape tonight
They line them up for you trying to keep you safe
But with them fire alley burglars on a midnight vamp
You lost your heart on Main Street to a beautiful tramp
That's all right, I don't mind
'Cause I got you got a love so fine
A love so fine, me and my baby
A love so fine, me and my baby
A love so fine

The rat's traps are filled with soul crusaders
Everybody's popping and hopping and jumping
At Little Melvin and The Invaders
You're out on the floor and you can't get up
Your baby's out there dancing and struttin' that Continental Strut
She looks so good, she looks so fine she blows your mind
Oh we you got a love so fine
A love so fine
A love so fine
A love so fine

Everybody's reeling when the band hits the ceiling
Don't you know you just wanna go
The boys start joint gets rockin', your knees start knockin'
Everybody party, go
Let's go

The bar's closed down It's 3 o'clock and the bar's closed
You walk to the shady side of town all alone Well you walk along with your
Papa's screaming at you, he wants some cash baby to the dirty side of town
Mama's chewing you me off about hanging out with alley trash
That's all right, oh you don't mind
'Cause you've got a love so fine, oh me and my baby
A love so fine
A love so fine
A love so fine
