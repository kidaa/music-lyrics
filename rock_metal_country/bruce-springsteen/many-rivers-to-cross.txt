There's so many rivers to cross 
and I can't seem to find my way home. 
Wandering, I'm lost 
as I travel as I travel along, the White Cliffs of Dover 
Many rivers to cross 
and it's only my wind that keeps me alive. 
I've been hurt, washed up for years 
and it's only my pride that lets me survive. 

And this loneliness won't leave me alone, 
it's such a drag to be on your own 
my baby left, and she wouldn't say why, 
Now all I do is cry... 

I've got many rivers to cross 
and it's only my wind that keeps me alive 
I've got so many rivers to cross, 
oh, so many rivers to cross...
