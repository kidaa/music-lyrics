Sleepy town ain't got the guts to budge
Baby this emptiness has already been judged
I wanna go out tonight, I wanna find out what I got
You're a strange part of me you're a preacher's girl
And I don't want no piece of this mechanical world
Got my arms open wide and my blood is running hot

We'll take the midnight road right to the devil's door
And even the white angels of Eden with their flaming swords
Won't be able to stop us from hitting town in this dirty old Ford
Well it don't take no nerve when you got nothing to guard
I got tombstones in my eyes and I'm running real hard
My baby was a lover and the world just blew her away

Once they tried to steal my heart, beat it right out of my head
Well baby they didn't know that I was born dead
I am the iceman, fighting for the right to live
I say better than the glory roads of heaven
Better off riding hell-bound in the dirt
Better than bright line of the freeway
Better than the shadows of your daddy's church
Better than the waiting
Baby better off is the search
