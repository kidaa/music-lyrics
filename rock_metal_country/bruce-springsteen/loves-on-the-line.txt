Tell me baby
Have we lost everything that we had before
What do you do in the day
When I walk out the door
I can see you made up your mind
And I know our love's on the line

Love's on the line, our love's on the line
Love's on the line, our love's on the line
Love's on the line, our love's on the line

With each passing day
I gotta watch more and more what I say to you
I can feel your eyes looking through me
As I sit at the table at dinnertime
I can feel our love's on the line

Love's on the line, our love's on the line
Love's on the line, our love's on the line
Love's on the line, our love's on the line

I watch our kids
Growin' up, going to school
Is there anything else for us now
Are we both just fools
Wasting our precious time

At night we lay in bed
But it's like you're not even there
There's something real bad
Going wrong somewhere
Last night I heard you cry
And I know our love's on the line

Love's on the line, our love's on the line
Love's on the line, our love's on the line
Love's on the line, our love's on the line
Love's on the line
