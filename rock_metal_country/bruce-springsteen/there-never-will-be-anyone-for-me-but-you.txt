Princess Di did find another man
Prince Charles may want to live
in another woman's underpants
I know what he feels like
I've been there too
but there will never be any other for me but you

Will Elizabeth Taylor get married again? buddy that's the question
Poor Larry Fertenski busted on his harly for illegal weapons possession
I've been that down, I've been that crazy I've been that much of a fool
But there will never be any other for me but you

Man a love that's real
is a love that's hard
like a pit bull on your ass
in a very small backyard
a love that's hard
can be a love that's true
but there will never be any other for me but you

Elvis and Priscilla
Jim Baker and Tammy Fay
Donald and Ivana once swore their love forever and a day
I said those words
ya I meant 'em too 
but I swear there will never be any other for me but you no, 
baby there will never be any other for me but you
