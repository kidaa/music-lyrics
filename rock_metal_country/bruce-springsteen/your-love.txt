She promises to be yours forever and always
And you're too young to know it don't work out that way
When she kisses you and your heart skips
And you're ten feet off the ground
Soon you'll be crying and that when you'll have found
That

Your love is gonna let you down, boy
Your love is gonna let you down
Your love is gonna let you down, boy
Your love is gonna let you down

Well it's kisses and sweet talk
When she first starts coming round
But soon tears start falling down
You say every day she makes your dreams come true
But soon those very dreams will be the death of you
Well

Your love is gonna let you down, boy
Your love is gonna let you down
Your love is gonna let you down, boy
Your love is gonna let you down

No cold denials, no-one really lied
It was time spent, promise implied
And suddenly you see something new in her eyes
And in that moment you realize

Lately you've been walking the streets at night
Like an empty shadow in the morning light
Like an empty shadow that's suddenly found
That your love is gonna let you down

Your love is gonna let you down, boy
Your love is gonna let you down
Your love is gonna let you down, boy
Your love is gonna let you down
