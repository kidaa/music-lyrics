Night after night
I keep holdin' on
You say you love me
then you leave me so lonely
Well I don't believe
a single thing you're saying
I think its all some evil game
you're playing

Still all day long
all I do is think about you
You've got me believing
That I can't live without you
Well if you want it
Well here is my confession
Baby I can't help it
You're my obsession

Protection
That's what I need
I want protection
Baby from your love
Protection
That's what I need
I want protection
Baby from your love

The phone rings
in the middle of the night
When I pick it up
You won't answer
A knock on the door
I rush down the stairs
When I open up
there's no one there

Out in the darkness
I feel your eyes on me
I lay in bed and
feel your hands upon me
Well is it all
just my imagination
You keep me in doubt
believing I can't live without..

Protection
That's what I need
I want protection
baby from your love
Protection
That's what I need
I want protection
baby from your love

I stand alone at my window
I see you waiting
in the shadows down below
I feel your fingers on my face
I know I wanna stay
but I wanna run away

Protection
That's what I need
I want protection
baby from your love...
