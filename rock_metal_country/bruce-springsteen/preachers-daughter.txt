I got a date with the preacher's daughter
She give me life she bring me water.
Every Sunday I watch her work
Pretty little self in a pretty little church
Daddy gives her nod she takes collection
Daddy gives her nod she kneels by her side.
Well I'd sell my soul for just one touch
The Lord would too if he loved her half as much.

Well I got a date with the preacher's daughter.
Her Daddy say that the boy's no good
Just want to raise them dunes out through the back woods
Well baby better believe what your Daddy say
Just wanna ramrod baby my life away.
It's a long walk to heaven and a road filled with sin
And they better open up the freeway to let me in.

'Cuz I got a date with the preacher's daughter
Well now I don't care what the preacher say
Haaaaayyyy
[IDENTICAL to "Haaaaayyyy, Mona"]
Well now I don't care what the preacher do
Haaaaayyyy
I don't care what the preacher like
Haaaaayyyy
I don't care what the preacher think
Haaaaayyyy
Leads me to water but won't let me drink.
He leads me to water but won't let me drink.
Big Man

[maracas start, music picks up, Bruce starts yelling]

And now it's whole little world? on Saturday night
Two boys fighting in a halo of light
Car door flung open and a radio loud
And everybody shouting and running around.
Two guys bloody and one I don't know
And all little girls shouting "Go Billy go"
Go Billy go.

Well just as I got the preacher's daughter ready for a light
And missed a VH fire? and something ain't right.
And like a she-devil howlin' from the gates of hell
Goddam here come the preacher in his Coupe DeVille
Burnin' up the backroad kicking in the dirt
And oh baby preacher thinks he is church
Well now your lips they shine in the willow mist
And I swear I'd take your daddy on for just one kiss

I got a date with the preacher's daughter
I got a date with the preacher's daughter
And it's haaaaayyyyoooo
I got a date with the preacher's daughter
hmmmmm...
