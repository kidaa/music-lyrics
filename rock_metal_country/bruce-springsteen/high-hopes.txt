Monday morning runs to Sunday night
Screaming slow me down before the new year dies
It won't take much to kill a lovin' smile
And every mother with a baby cryin' in her arms singin
Give me Help, give me Strength
Give a soul a Night of fearless sleep
Give me love, give me peace
Don't you know these days you pay for everything
Got high hopes

Comin' from the cities, comin' from the wild
I see a breathless army breakin' like a cloud
It's gonna smother love it's gonna shoot your hopes
Before the meek inherit they'll learn to hate themselves
Singin'
Give me Help, give me Strength
Give a soul a Night of fearless sleep
Give me love, give me peace
Don't you know these days you pay for everything
Got high hopes

So tell me someone what's the price
I wanna buy some time and maybe live my life
I wanna have a wife I wanna have some kids
I want to look in their eyes and know they're gonna stand a chance
Singin'
Give me Help, give me Strength
Give a soul a Night of fearless sleep
Give me love, give me peace
Don't you know these days you pay for everything
Got high hopes
