where the creek runs shallow and sandy
the moon swoops over the stars
straight into my arms
I'm going to get birth naked and bury my old soul
and dance on it's grave
dance on his grave

It's a long time coming
a long time coming my dear
But now it's here

my daddy was a stranger
lived in a hotel downtown
when I was a kid
he was just somebody I'd see around
somebody I'd see around

It's a long time coming
a long time coming my dear
But now it's here

down below and pulling on my shirt
I got some kids of my own
but if I had one wish kids
that your mistakes would be your own
your sins would be your own

It's a long time coming
a long time coming my dear
But now it's here

I am laying under the arms of Cassiopeia
the sword of Orion sweeps
it's me and you Rosie
crackling like crossed wires
I listen to you breathing in your sleep

the sparks of the fire are left burning
lie 2 kids in sleeping bags

I reach under your shirt and feel your belly
there's another one kicking inside
I promise I ain't going to fuck it up this time
