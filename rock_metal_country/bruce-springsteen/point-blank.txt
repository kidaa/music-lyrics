Do you still say your prayers little darling
Do you go to bed at night
Praying that tomorrow, everything will be allright
But tomorrow's fall in number in number one by one
You wake up and you're dying you don't even know what from

Well they shot you point blank you been shot in the back
Baby point blank you been fooled this time, little girl that's a fact
Right between the eyes baby, point blank
Right between the pretty lies that they tell
Little girl you fell

You grew up where young girls they grow up fast
You took what you were handed and left behind what was asked
But what they asked baby wasn't right
You didn't have to live that live
I was gonna be your Romeo you were gonna be my Juliet
These days you don't wait for Romeo's, you wait on that welfare check
And on all the pretty things that you can't ever have and on all the promises

That always end up point blank, shot between the eyes
Point blank like little white lies you tell to ease the pain

You're walking in the sights, girl of point blank
And it's one false move and baby the lights go out

Once I dreamed we were together again
Baby you and me
Back home in those old clubs the way we used to be
We were standing at the bar it was hard to hear
The band was playing loud and you were shouting something in my ear
You pulled my jacket off and as the drummer counted four
You grabbed my hand and pulled me out on the floor
You just stood there and held me, then you started dancing slow

And as I pulled you tighter I swore I'd never let you go

Well I saw you last night down on the avenue
Your face was in the shadows but I knew that it was you
You were standing in the doorway out of the rain
You didn't answer when I called out your name
You just turned and then you looked away 
Like just another stranger waiting to get blown away

Point blank, right between the eyes
Point blank, right between the pretty lies you fell
Point blank, shot straight through the heart

Yea point blank, you've been twisted up till you've become just another part of it
Point blank, you're walking in the sights
Point blank, living one false move, just one false move away
Point blank, they caught you in their sights
Point blank, did you forget how to love, girl did you forget how to fight
Point blank, they must have shot you in the head
Cause point blank, bang bang baby you're dead
