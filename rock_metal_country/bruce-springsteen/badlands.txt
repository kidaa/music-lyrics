Lights out tonight trouble in the heartland  Got a head-on collision smashin' in my guts man  I'm caught in a crossfire that I don't understand
But there's one thing I know for sure I don't give a damn
For the same old played out scenes I don't give a damn
For just the in-betweens honey I want the heart I want the soul
I want control right now talk about a dream
Try to make it real you wake up in the night
With a fear so real spend your life waiting
For a moment that just don't come

Well don't waste your time waiting

Badlands you gotta live it every day
Let the broken hearts stand
As the price you've gotta pay
We'll keep pushin' till it's understood
And these badlands start treating us good

Workin' in the field till you get your back burned
Workin' `neath the wheels till you get your facts learned
Baby I got my facts learned real good right now
You better get it straight darling 
Poor man wanna be rich, rich man wanna be king

And a king ain't satisfied till he rules everything
I wanna go out tonight, I wanna find out what I got
Now I believe in the love that you gave me
I believe in the faith that could save me
I believe in the hope and I pray that some day
It will raise me above these

Badlands...

For the ones who had a notion, a notion deep inside
That it ain't no sin to be glad you're alive
I wanna find one face that ain't looking through me
I wanna find one place, I wanna spit in the face of these

Badlands...
