Freezin', rests his head on a pillow made of concrete, again
Oh, Feelin' maybe he'll see a little betters any days
Oh, head down, faces that he sees don't look it ain't that
familiar
Oh, girlfriend he can't have when he's happy looks insane, oh
yeah

Even flow
thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know
so he chases them away
someday yet he'll begin his life again
Life againn

Kneelin', looking through the paper though he doesn't know to
read
Prayin', now to something that has never showed him anything
Oh, feelin', understands the weather or that winters on its
way, yeah
Oh, ceilins people fall between all the legal halls of shame

Even flow
thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know
so he chases them away
someday yet he'll begin his life again
Whispering hands, carry him away
him away,  him away
yeah!
woo
oh yeah yeah
