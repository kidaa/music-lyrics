1, 2, 1, 2...
Know a man. His face seemed pulled and tense.
Like he's riding on a motorbike in the strongest winds.
So I approach with tact.
Suggest that he should relax, but he's always moving much too fast.

Said he'll see me on the flipside of this trip he's taking for a ride.
He's been taking too much on.
There he goes with his perfectly unkept clothes.
There he goes.

He's yet to come back but I see his picture.
It doesn't look the same up on the rack.
We go way back.

I wonder about his insides.
It's like his thoughts are too big for his size.
He's been taken, where I don't know.
Off he goes with his perfectly unkept hope.
There he goes.

And now I rub my eyes for he has returned.
Seems my preconceptions are what should have been burned.
For he still smiles. And he's still strong.
Nothing's changed but the surrounding bullshit. That has grown.
And now he's home and we're laughing like we always did my same old, same old friend.
Until a quarter to ten. I saw the strain creep in.
He seems distracted and I know just what is going to happen next.
Before his first step he is off again.
