Consider me an object. Put me in a vacuum.
Free of all conditions. Free of air and friction.

Yeh, I'll be hanging upside down. And there I will swing, for all eternity. 

Feel it rising,... Yeh next stop falling
Feel it rising,... comatose, with no fear of falling.

Consider me an abcess. Leave me in a vacuum.
Blood on all the pistons. Running my transmission.

Feel it rising,... Yeh next stop falling
Feel it rising,... comatose, with no fear of falling.

High above,...I'll break the law,...if it's illegal to be in love,... leave the hatred,.. on the cross.

Yeh, I'll be hanging upside down, and there I will swing.
For all eternity.

Feel it rising,... Yeh next stop falling
Feel it rising,... comatose, with no fear of falling.

Feel it rising,... Yeh next stop falling
Feel it rising.

Something never thought you'd be a part of.
