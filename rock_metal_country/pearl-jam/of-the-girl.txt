oh he deals em off, off the top, ties em off
fills it up, with his past, gets carried away
oh half his life, a hand me down, wasted away
of he fills it up, with the love, of a girl
oh he left it alone, drilled the pain, with money to buy
how he makes his getaway
how he makes his getaway
oh he chose a path, heavy the fall, quarter to four
fills his night, with the thought, of a girl
how he makes his getaway
how he makes his getaway
how he makes his getaway
