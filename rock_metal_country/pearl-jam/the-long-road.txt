And I wished for so long cannot stay 
All the precious moments cannot stay 
It's not like wings have fallen cannot stay 
But still something's missing I cannot say yea 
Holding hands are daughters and sons 
And their faiths are falling down down down down 
I have wished for so long 
How I wish for you today 

Will I walk the long road the long road 
Cannot stay the long road 
There's no need to say goodbye say goodbye 
All the friends and family 
All the memories going round round round 
I have wished for so long 
How I wish for you today 

And the wind keeps roarin' 
And the sky keeps turning grey 
And the sun is setting 
The sun won't rise another day 

I have wished for so long 
How I wish for you today 
I have wished for so long 
How I wish for you today 
Will I walk the long road 
We all walk the long road 
Will I walk the long road 
We all walk the long road 
Will I walk the long road 
Will I walk the long road 
We all walk the long road 
Will I walk the long road 
We all walk the long road 
Will I walk the long road
