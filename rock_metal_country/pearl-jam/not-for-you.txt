Restless soul, enjoy your youth.
Like Muhammad. Hits the truth.
Can't escape from the common rule - if you hate something don't you do it too. Too...

Small my table. A-sits just two.
Got so crowded. I can't make room.
Oh where did they come from? Stormed my room.
And you dare say it belongs to you. To you...

This is not for you. x3
Oh, not for you. Ah you...

My friends call me Ed, they call me.
My friends they don't scream.
My friends don't call.
My friends don't...

All that's sacred comes from youth.
Dedication. Naive and true.
With no power. Nothing to do.
I still remember. Why don't you? Don't you?

This is not for you. x3 
Oh, never was for you. Fuck you.
This is not for you.
Oh, this is not for you. No, no.
This is not for you. Oh, not for you. Oh you...
