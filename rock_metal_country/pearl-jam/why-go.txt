she scratches a letter
into a wall made of stone
maybe someday
another child
won't feel as alone as she does

it's been two years
and counting
since they put her in this place
she's been diagnosed
by some stupid fuck
and mommy agrees
why go home
why go home
why go home...

she seems to be stronger
but what they want her to be is weak
she could just pretend
she could play the game
she could be another clone

why go home

what you taught me
don't come visit
put me here
mommy dear
