Get me outta here... If reality is what I see...

I had a false belief. I thought I came here to stay.
We're all just visiting. All just breaking like waves.
The oceans made me, but who came up with love?
Push me pull me, push me. Or pull me out.

Push me pull me. Or pull me out. x2

So if there were no angels would there be no sin?
Huh, you better stop me before I begin.
But let me say.
If I behave can you arrange a spacious hole in the ground?
Somewhere nice. Make it nice.
Where the land meets high tide.

Push me pull me. Or just pull me out.
Push me pull me.
Push me or pull me. Or pull me out.
Push me pull me, out.

Like a cloud dropping rain I'm discarding all thought.
I'll dry up leaving puddles on the ground.
I'm like an opening band for the sun.

Push me pull me. Or just pull me out.
Push me pull me. Push or pull me out.
Push me pull me. Just pull me out, out, out.
Push me pull me, out.

I've had enough, said enough, felt enough, I'm fine now.
Push me pull me. See ya later...
