Are we bound out of obligation? Is that all we've got?
I get the words and then I get to thinking.
I don't want to think, I want to feel.
And how do I feel? And how do I...

If you're the only one will I never be enough? Yeah.
Hail hail the lucky ones. I refer to those in love. Yeah.

Oh, how I'll love you til the day I die and beyond.
Are we going to the same place? If so can I come?
It's egg rolling thick and heavy. All the past you carry.
Oh, I could be new. You underestimate me.

If you're the only one will I never be enough? Yeah.
Hail hail the lucky ones. I refer to those in love. Yeah.

I sometimes realize I could only be as good as you'll let me.

All hail the lucky ones. I refer to those in love. Yeah.
If you're my only one, so could you only one?
I want to be your one. Enough! You won no one. You're one.
