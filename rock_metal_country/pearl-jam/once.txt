I admit it...what's to say
I'll relive it...without pain
backstreet lover on the side
of the road
I got a bomb in my tmeple
that is gonna explode
I got a .16 gauge buried
under my clothes...I play.
once upon a time I could control myself
once upon a time I could lose myself
oh try and mimic..what's insane
I am in it...where do I stand
indian summer I hate the heat
I got a backstreet lover on the passenger seat
I got my hand in my pocket
so determined
discreet...I pray.

once upon a time I could control myself
once upon a time I could lose myself
once upon a time I could love myself
once upon a time I could love myself

once
once
once
