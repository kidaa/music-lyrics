have a drink they're buying
bottom of, bottle of denial
big guy, big eye, watchin me
have to wonder what it sees
sin...
progress laced with ramifications
freedom's big plunge
pull the innocent from a crowd 
raise the sticks then bring em down
if they fail to obey
oh if they fail to obey
for every tool they lend us
a loss of independence
i pledge my grievance to the flag
cause you don't give blood then take it back again
oh we're all deserving something more
progress, taste it, invest-it-all
champagne breakfast for everyone
break the innocent when they're proud
raise the stakes then bring em down
if they fail to obey
oh if they fail to obey
pledge your grievance to the flag 
aw c'mon, don't give blood then take it back again
oh we're all deserving something more
have a, have a, drink, drink...
have a, have a, drink, drink...
i want to breathe
follow the scene
i want to taste
everyone i see
i want to run when i'm up high
i want to run into the sea
i only want life to be...
i just want to be...
i will feel alive as long as i am free...
