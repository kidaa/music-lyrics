I took a drive today. Time to emancipate.
I guess it was the beatings, made me wise.
But I'm not about to give thanks or apologize.

I couldn't breathe. Holding me down.
Hand on my face. Pushed to the ground.
Enmity gauged. United by fear.
Forced to endure what I could not forgive.

I seem to look away. The wounds in the mirror waved.
It wasn't my surface. Most defiled.

Head at your feet. Fool to your crown.
Fist on my plate. Swallowed it down.
Enmity gauged. United by fear.
Tried to endure what I could not forgive. Yeah.

Saw things... x4 ...clearer. x2
Oh, once you were in my Rearviewmirror.
I gathered speed from you fucking with me.
Once and for all I'm far away.
Hard to believe. Finally the shades are raised. Hey, yea.
Saw things so much clearer once you, once you... Rearviewmirror.
Saw things so much clearer once you, once you... Rearviewmirror.
Saw things so much clearer once you, once you... Rearviewmirror.
Saw things so much clearer once you... Oh yeah.
