you'll be 
going out with radio 
going out with disco
going out like bacchanal
i'll be 
going out with telephone
going out alone
to the radar zone
it's all just inadvertant imitation 
and i don't mean mine
it's all across this nation
if it's just inadvertant simulation 
a pattern in all mankind
what's got the whole world faking
i'll be playing with my magazine
using up my listerine
like ovaltine
and you'll be 
dipping in your battleship
for the latest tip
for the latest dream
it's all just inadvertant imitation 
and i don't mean mine
it's all across this nation
if it's just inadvertant simulation
a pattern in all mankind
what's got the whole world faking
if it's just inadvertant imitation
a pattern in all mankind
what's got the whole world faking
what's got the whole world faking
what's got the whole world faking
