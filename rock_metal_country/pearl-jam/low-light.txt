Clouds roll by.
"Reeling," is what they say.
Or is it just my way?
Wind blows by.

Low light. Sidetracked. Low light.
Can't see my tracks your scent way back.

Can I be here all alone?
Clear a path to my home.
Blood runs dry.

Books and jealousy tell me wrong.
I will feel calm.
Poise blows by.

Low light. Car crash. Low light.
Can wear my mask. Your first my last.

Voice goes by.
Two birds is what they'll see getting lost upon their way.
Wind rolls by.

Low light. Eye sight. Low light.
I need the light. I'll find my way from wrong.
What's real? The dream I see.
