I come from a genius, I am my fathers son,
Yeah, too bad he was a psychopath and now Im the next in line,
Lonely nest, dear mother, yes, surely shes a work of art,
I never got top dollar, but she gave us all a star.

Can I get a reprieve?
This gene pool dont hurt me.
Can I beg a release 
From the volunteer amputee?
From the moment I fell
I called on DNA,
Why such betrayal 
Got me tooth and nail.

Yeah, hows about one conversation with nothing else left to be had,
Oh, is this your long lost son, and hes never had dear old dad,
I forget the insemination and for that Im sposed to be glad,
What a pity you left us so soon to climb your mountain of regret.

Can I get a reprieve?
This gene pool dark and deep.
Can I beg a release?
Can I volunteer amputee?
From the moment I fell
I called on DNA,
Why such betrayal?
Oh I gotta set sail.

Oh real bright light shining as youre trying to breathe in thin air,
Cannot forget youre hiding collected wounds left unhealed,
When every thought youre thinking sinks you darker than the new moon sky,
The faraway lights rising in the whites of your eyes.

Now father youre dead and gone and Im finally free to be me,
Thanks for all your dark gifts for which Ive got no sympathy,
Im living in a walled-up place in the bounds of 5th symphony,
Thanks for this and thanks for that, I gotta let go, learn to see legacy?.

Can I get a reprieve?
This gene pool dont hurt me.
Can I beg a release?
Can I volunteer amputee?
From the moment I fell
I called on DNA,
Why such betrayal 
Oh I gotta set sail.
