If I ever were to lose you
I'd surely lose myself
Everything I have found dear
Ive not found by myself

Try and sometimes you'll succeed to make this man of me
All my stolen missing parts Ive no need for anymore

I believe and I believe cause I can see
Our future days, days of you and me

Back when I was feeling broken
I focused on a prayer, you came deep as in the ocean
Its something I cant hear

All the complexities and games, no one wins but somehow they're still played
All the missing crooked hearts they may die but in us they live on

I believe and I believe cause I can see
Our future days, days of you and me

When The hurricanes and cyclones rage
When winds turn dirt into dust
When floods they came and the tides they raised, ever closer became us

All the promises at sundown, I met them like the rest
All the demons used to come round I'm grateful now they've left

So persistent in my ways, Angel I am here to stay

No resistance, no alarms
Please this is just too good to be gone

I believe and I believe cause I can see
Our future days, days of you and me
You and me
Days of You and Me
