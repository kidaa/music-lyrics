The selfish they are all standing in line.
Faith in their hope and to buy themselves time.
Me, I figure as each breath goes by,
I only own my mind.

The north is to south as the clock is to time.
There's east and there's west and there's everywhere life.
I know I was born and I know that I'll die.
The in between is mine. I am mine.

And the meanings get left behind.
Oh the innocence pass you on time.
Significant between the lines.
There's no need to hide.
We're safe tonight.

The ocean is full cause everyone's crying.
The full moon is looking for friends at high tide.
The sorrow grows bigger when the sorrow's denied.
I only know my mind. I am mine.

And the meanings get left behind.
Oh the innocence pass you on time. 
Significance behind the eyes.
There's no need to hide.
We're safe tonight.
Woooo

And the meanings get left behind.
Oh the feelings get broken with time.
We're all different beind the eyes.
You may need to hide.

And the meanings get left behind.
Oh the innocence pass you on time.
Significancec between the lines.
There's no need to hide.
