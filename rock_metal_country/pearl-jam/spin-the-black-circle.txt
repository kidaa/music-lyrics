See this needle. A-see my hand.
Drop, drop, dropping it down oh so gently.
Well here it comes. I touch the plane.
Turn me up, won't turn you away.

Spin, spin... Spin the black circle.
Spin, spin... Spin the black, spin the black.
Spin, spin... Spin the black circle.
Spin, spin... Whoa...

Pull it out. A-paper sleeve.
Oh my joy. Only you deserve conceit.
I'm so big. A-my whole world.
I'd rather you, rather you than her.

Spin, spin... Spin the black circle.
Spin, spin... Spin the black, spin the black.
Spin, spin... Spin the black circle.
Spin, spin... Whoa... Oh...

You're so warm. Oh, the ritual when I lay down your crooked arm.

Spin, spin... Spin the black circle.
Spin, spin... Spin the black, spin the black.
Spin, spin... Spin the black circle.
Spin, spin...
Spin the black x5 circle.
Spin the black circle. x4
Spin, spin... x6
