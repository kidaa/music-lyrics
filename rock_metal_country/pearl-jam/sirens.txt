Hear the sirens, hear the sirens.

Hear the sirens,
Hear the circus so profound.
I hear the sirens,
More and more in this here town.

Let me catch my breath
To breathe and reach across the bed.
Just to know were safe.
I am a grateful man.

This life has been a light and I can see clear
Oh, I have to take your hand and feel your breath.

For fear that someday we'll be over.
I pull you close. So much to lose
Knowing that nothing lasts forever.
I didnt care before you were here.

I danced with laughter,
With the ever-after
But all things change.
Let this remain.

Hear the sirens
Covering distance in the night.
The sound echoing closer.
Will they come for me next time?

For every choice, mistake I made, is not my plan
To send you in the arms of another man
And if you choose to stay, Ill wait, Ill understand

Oh, its a fragile thing, this life we lead.
If I think too much I cant get overwhelmed by the grace by which we live our lives with death over our shoulders.

Want you to know
That should I go,
I always loved you,
Held you high above too.
I studied your face,
And the fear goes away.

Fear goes away.
Ah, ah, oh, oh
