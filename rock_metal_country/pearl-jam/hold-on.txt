Nothin' left for me...
I can't live down here no more.
I can't fall from a tree,
I got wings, it ain't my fault.
Understand what's right...
It's so hard to be alone.
It's never tight,
It's been so loose for so long.

Hold on...Hold on...

Understand my fear,
I never been this high before.
I can't fall from cheer alone.
It only takes a breath to believe...

I can't face one more day,
I have tried so many ways.
My life work, all I failed.
I can't waste away on zeal...

Hold on...
A voice tells me hold on...
Somewhere I feel...hold on...
Hold on...
