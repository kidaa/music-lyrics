don't it make you smile
don't it make you smile
when the sun don't shine shine at all
don't it make you smile
don't it make you smile
don't it make me smile
when the sun don't shine, it don't shine at all
don't it make me smile
i miss you already... i miss you always
i miss you already... i miss you all day
this is how i feel...
i miss you already... i miss you always
three crooked hearts and swirls all around... i miss you all day
