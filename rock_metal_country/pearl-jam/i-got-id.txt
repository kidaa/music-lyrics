My lips are shakin' my nails are bit off 
Been a month since I've heard myself talk 
All the advantage this life's got on me 
Picture a cup in the middle of the sea 

And I fight back in my mind 
Never lets me be right 
I got memories I got shit 
So don't you go show 
Oh I walked the line when you held me in that night 
I walked the line when you held my hand that night 

An empty shells seem so easy to crack 
Got all these questions don't know who I could even ask 
So I'll just lie alone and wait for the dream 
Where I'm not ugly and your lookin' at me 

And I stayed in bed 
Oh in a little while I'll see you 
If just once I could feel love 
Oh I'd say it like I mean it 
But I walked the line when you held me in that night 
Oh I walked the line when you held my hand that night 
Oh I walked the line when you held me close that night 
I paid the price never held you in real life 
My lips are shakin'
