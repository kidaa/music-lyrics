on the edge
windowsill
ponders his maker
ponders his will
to the street below
he just ain't nothin'
but he's got a great view...

on the edge
know-nothin' town
feelin' quite superior
the aged come
to the sky above
he just ain't nothin'
but he's got a great view...

on the edge of a
christmas clean love
young virgin from heaven
visiting...
to the man above her
she just ain't nothin'...
she doesn't like the view
doesn't like the view
doesn't like the view...
but he sinks himself deep.

can't touch the bottom
in too deep
can't touch the bottom

can't touch the bottom
in too deep
can't touch the bottom

can't touch the bottom
in too deep
can't touch the bottom
can't touch the bottom
deep...
