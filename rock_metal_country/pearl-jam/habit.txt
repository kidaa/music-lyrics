See it happen to a couple of friends.
Seen it happen and the message it sends.
Taking off for what's an obvious fall.
Just to see what all the fuss is about.

It's not your way.
Not your way.
It's not your way.

Another habit says it's in love with you.
Another habit says it's long overdue.
Another habit like an unwanted friend.
I'm so happy with my righteous self.

It's not your way.
Not your way.
It's not your way.

Never thought you'd habit. x3
I never thought you... Never thought you.
Never thought you'd habit. x3
I never thought you... Never never thought you.

Never thought you'd habit. x6
Speaking as a child of the 90's...

Never thought you'd habit. x3
I never thought you... Never thought you.
Never thought you'd habit. x3
I never thought you... Never never thought you.

Never... Never me. Never you. Never me.
