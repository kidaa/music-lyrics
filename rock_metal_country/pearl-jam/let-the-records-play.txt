When the Kingdom comes he puts the records on 
and with his blistered thumb hits play
and with the volume up he goes and fills his cup 
and lets the drummer drum take away the pain, the pain

Breaking, forsaken, whats that youre taken?
Bleeding the feeling, he lets the records play

I should the future dim
The cigarette lights in
the vaporizer green light grim
and when the shot glass talks he goes to listens up
until hes nice and numb again, again

Shaken, the breaking, not one for faking
the reeling is healing, he lets the records play, 
theres wisdom in his ways

Ive been down and I fell so hard and far from grace
Ive been hurt and I still recall the flaws on her face
Ive been off but I'm up on my feet, my feet again

Shaken, forsaken, whats that youre taking?
Oh! The weeding, the feeling, he lets the records play

Shaken but breaking, not one for faking oh!
the reeling is healing, he lets the records play!

Oh, theres wisdom in his ways
