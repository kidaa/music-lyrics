Waiting, watching the clock. It's four o'clock.
It's got to stop. Tell him. Take no more.
She practices her speech as he opens the door, she rolls over.
Pretends to sleep as he looks her over.

She lies and says she's in love with him. Can't find a better man.
She dreams in color, she dreams in red. Can't find a better man.
Can't find a better man. x2
Ohh...

Talking to herself, "There's no one else who needs to know," she tells herself. Oh...
Memories back when she was smooth and strong and waiting for the world to come along.
Swears she knew him now she swears he's gone.

She lies and says she's in love with him. Can't find a better man.
She dreams in color, she dreams in red. Can't find a better man.
She lies and says she still loves him. Can't find a better man.
She dreams in color, she dreams in red. Can't find a better man.
Can't find a better man. x2
Yeah.

She loved him, yeah. She don't want to leave this way.
She feeds him, yeah. That's why she'll be back again.
Can't find a better man. can't find a better man x3
Can't find a better man.
Ohh... ohh...
