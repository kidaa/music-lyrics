Don't you think you oughtta rest?
Don't you think you oughtta lay you head down?
Don't you think you want to sleep?
Don't you think you oughtta lay your head down, tonight.
Don't you think you've done enough?
Oh, don't you think you've got enough? Well, maybe yea.
You don't think there's time to stop.
There's time enough for you to lay your head down, tonight.
Tonight.

Maybe it'll wash away all those yesterdays.

What are you running from?
Taking pills to get along.
Creating walls to call your own.
So no one catches you drifting off and doing all the things that we all do.

Oh, let it wash away all those yesterdays.

All those yesterdays. All those yesterdays. All those yesterdays.
All those paper plates. All those yesterdays. All those yesterdays.
You've got time. You've got time to escape.
There's still time. It's no crime to escape.
It's no crime to escape. x2
There's still time so escape. It's no crime, crime...
All those yesterdays. x9
