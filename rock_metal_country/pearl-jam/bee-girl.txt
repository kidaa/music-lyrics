Bee girl, you're gonna die.
You don't wanna be famous, you wanna be shy.
Do your dances alone in your room.
Becoming a star will become your doom.
Bee Girl, be a girl. [x2]

You know time is long, and life is short.
Begin to live while you still can.
Believe in nothing, believe me, 
Those who can be trusted can change their mind.
When the anxious is the present, unwrap your gifts, take your time.
Everything you imagine needn't be stuck in your mind.
Bee Girl, be a girl... [x2]
