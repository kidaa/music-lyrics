Do you want to hear something sad?
we are but victims of desire
I'm gonna shake this day
I wanna shake this day before I retire

I'm gonna see my friend
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away
I'm sick of everything
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away

Well I said I... I won't be long before we all walk off the wire
Well I'm gonna see my friend, I'm gonna see my friend for what I require
Well I said I will come in quick
don't want my flame to get no higher

I'm gonna see my friend
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away
I'm sick of everything
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away
I'm gonna see my friend
gonna see my friend, make it go away

Want to leave it all.
Want to give it up.
Want to see it go once and for all
Want to view it cho
Want a little bit home
Want to be there...
Hard as a statue, black as a tattoo, never to wash away

Gonna take me an astral plane
I'm gonna tunnel through denial
But I'm gonna shake this day
I wanna shake this day before I retire

I'm gonna see my friend
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away
I'm sick of everything
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away
I'm gonna see my friend
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away
