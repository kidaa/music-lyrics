at home
drawing pictures
of mountain tops
with him on top
lemin yellow sun
arms raised in a V
dead lay in pools of maroon below

daddy didn't give attention
to the fact that mommy didn't care
king jeremy the wicked
ruled his world

Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today

clearly I remember
pickin' on the boy
seemed a harmless little fuck
but we unleashed a lion
gnashed his teeth
and bit the recessed lady's breast

how could I forget
he hit me with a surprise left
my jaw left hurtin
dropped wide open
just like the day
like the day I heard

daddy didn't give affection
and the boy was something mommy wouldn't wear
king Jeremy the wicked
ruled his world

Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
try to forget this...
try to erase this...
from the blackboard.
