It's not all been said, been said and done.
I've never slept in Satan's bed.
Although, I must admit, still visits my place.
Uninvited, as you know he don't wait.
Funny how he always seems to fit in.
Funny how I always want to give in.
Sundays, Fridays, Tuesdays, Thursdays the same.
Sometimes this special guest he don't like to leave.

Already in love. x3
Already...

Who made, who made up, made up the myth that we were born to be covered in bliss?
Who set the standard? Born to be rich.
Such fine examples, skinny little bitch.
Model, role model. Roll some models in blood.
Get some flesh to stick so they look like us.
I shit and I stink. I'm real join the club.
I'd stop and talk but I'm already in love.

Already in love. x3
Already in love... Ah ha ha ha...

Torture follows reward, follows torture, follows reward. Oh, oh my word.

Never shook Satan's hand. Look, see for yourself.
You'd know it if I had that shit don't come off.
I'll rise and fall, let me take credit for both.
Jump off a cliff don't need your help so back off.
I'll never suck Satan's dick.
Again you'd see it, you know, right round the lips.
I'll wait for an angel but I won't hold my breath.
Amagine they're busy. Think I'm doing okay.

Already in love. x6
