Got a car. I got some gas.
Oh, let's get out of here. Get out of here fast.
Ah, everyone's confused so I stay in my room.
If I go, I don't want to go alone.
I hope you got this message. Oh, your not home.
I could be there in ten minutes, or so.
Oh, I got my things.
We'll make it up as we go along.
Oh, with you I could never be alone.
Never be alone.
