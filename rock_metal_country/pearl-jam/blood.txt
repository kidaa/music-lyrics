spin me round, roll me over, fuckin' circus
stab it down, one way needle, pulled so slowly
drains and spills, soaks the pages, fills their sponges
it's my blood
it's my blood
paint ed big...turn ed into...one of his enemies...
it's my blood
it's my blood
it's my blood
stab it down, fill the pages, suck my life out
maker of my enemies...
take...my...
fuck...fuck...fuck...fuck...fuck...fuck...
