there's a light when my baby's in my arms
there's a light when the window shades are drawn
hesitate when i feel i may do harm to her
wash it off cuz this feeling we can share
and i know she's reached my heart, in thin air
byzantine is reflected in our pond
there's a cloud but the water remains calm
reaching in, the sun's fingers clutch the dawn to pass
even out, it's a precious thing to bear
and i know she's reached my heart, in thin air
yes i know she's reached my heart, in thin air
it's not in my past to presume
love can keep on moving in both directions
how to be happy and true is the quest we're taking on together
taking on, on, on, on, on...taking on, on, on, on, on...
there's a light when my baby's in my arms
and i know she's reached my heart, in thin air
and i know she's reached my heart, in thin air
and i know she's reached my heart, in thin air
yes i know she's reached my heart...
