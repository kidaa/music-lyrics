all in all, it's no one's fault
excuses turn to carbon walls
blame it all on chemical intercourse
the swallowed seeds of arrogance
breeding in the thoughts of ten thousand fools that fight irreverance
the full moon is dead skin
the one down here's wearing thin
so set are the ten pins as the human tide rolls in
like a ball that's spinning
bombs dropping down 
overhead, underground
it's instilled...to wanna live
bombs dropping down, please forgive
our hometown in our insignificance
turn the jukebox up he said
dancing in irreverance
play c3, let the song protest
the plates began to shift
perfect lefts come rolling in
i was alone and far away, hey..
when i heard the band start playin'
on the lip...late take off
bombs dropping down
overhead, underground
it's instilled...to wanna live
bombs dropping down, please forgive
our hometown in our insignificance
feel like resonance of distance
in the blood...the iron lies
it's instilled...
to wanna live
bombs dropping down, please forgive
our hometown in our insignificance
oh in our insignificance
