She comes on like a stone
But you dont know where from she was thrown
Like a burning meteor from miles high
Looking for a place to land
She said "Have you got yourself some sand?"
And whatever youd reply she took as yes

Now she comes out the deep
With her newly planted seeds and soon youre
Thrown down on your knees and then youll dig
And then before you know the weeds are obesely overgrown
With all the wild seeds she sows in your sleep

You gotta know youll never let her go
She's a lightning bolt!
Lightning bolt!
Lightning bolt!

Always something and never nothing
Isnt that the way were taught to be to be
Flipping through the worn out pages
And stages when you knew not who to be
Yeah Yeah
Until the lightning strike sets you free

You gotta know youll never let her go
She's a lightning bolt!
Lightning bolt!
Lightning bolt!

The crashing stormy waves erode her shoreline everyday
Until the castle of her ways turns to sand
She holds her lovely breast as her birds fall from her nest
Flying towards the great northwest
And with no repair in sight
There is no god with such might
As you open her world wide with such a view
And your death will soon arrive as she finally decides
That all her problems, they wont die with you

A-yeah! A-yeah! A-yeah!
Never let her go
Shes a lightning bolt
Never let her go
Shes true

She's rock 'n roll
She's a lightning bolt
Uncontrollable
Like you
