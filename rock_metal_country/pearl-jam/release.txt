I see the world
feel the truth
which way to go
windowsill
I see the words
on a rocking horse of time
I see the birds in the rain

oh dear diane
can you see me now
I am myself
like you somehow
I'll ride the wave
where it takes me
I'll hold the pain
release me

oh dear diane
can you see me now
I am myself
like you somehow
I'll wait up in the dark
for you to speak to me
I'll open up
release me
release me
release me
release me
