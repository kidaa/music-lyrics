Keep on locking your doors
Keep on just as before
Pay disasters no mind
Didn't get you this time
No friends left at the crime
Our ship's come in and it's sinking
Of everything that's possible
In the hearts and minds of man
Somehow it is the biggest things
That keep on slipping right through our hands
By thinking we're infallible

Oh we are tempting fate instead
Time we best begin here at the end
Want a third second chance
Put your faith in big hands
Pay no more than a glance
All good things come to an end

This could be good as it gets
How's the view from the fence
You think we've been here before
You are mistaken
Of everything that's possible
In the hearts and minds of man

When progress could be plausible
In the verse we curse ourselves
By thinking we're infallible

Oh we are tempting fate instead
Time we best begin here at the end
Of everything that's possible
In the hearts and minds of man

Somehow it is the biggest things
That keep on slipping right through our hands
By thinking we're infallible

Oh we are tempting fate instead
Time we best begin here at the end
Keep on locking your doors
Keep on building your floors
Keep on just as before
