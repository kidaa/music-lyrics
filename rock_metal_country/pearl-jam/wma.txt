He won the lottery when he was born.
Took his mothers white breast to his tongue.
Trained like dogs. Color and smell.
Walks by me to get to him.

He won the lottery by being born.
Big hand slapped the white male american.
Do no wrong. So clean cut.
Dirty his hands it comes right off.

Do no wrong so clean cut.
Dirty his hands it comes right off.
