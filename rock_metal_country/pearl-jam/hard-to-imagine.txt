Paint a picture forty shades of gray.
Light your pillow. Lay back. Watch the flames.
I'll tell a story but no one would listen that long.

After having seen all that they saw.

It's hard to imagine. It's hard to imagine.
Ohh [x4]

I tried to explain. Somehow.
Things were different then. All is different now.
I tried to explain. Somehow.
Ohh [x4]

Things were different then. All is different now.
I tried to explain. I hope this works. Somehow.
Things were different then. All is different now.
I tried to explain. Oh, somehow.
Ohh [x4]
