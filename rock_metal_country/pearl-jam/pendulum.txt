Can the word sound 
till you've been down so low
The future's bright, 
lit up with no where to go, 
to and fro the pendulum throws

We are here and then we go
my shadow left me long ago

Understand what we don't know
this might pass
this might last
this may go
easy come and easy go
easy left me a long time ago

I'm in the fire but I'm still cold
nothing works works for me anymore

ahh ahh ahh ahh ahhh
to and fro the pendulum throws
