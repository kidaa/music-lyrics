hold on to the thread
the currents will shift
guide me towards you
know something's left
and we're all allowed to dream
of the next time we touch..........

you don't have to stray
two oceans away
waves roll in my thoughts
hold tight the ring...
the sea will rise...
please stand by the shore...
I will be...
I will be...
there once more.........
