Lives opened and trashed. Look ma, watch me crash.
No time to question why'd nothing last.
Grasp and hold on we're dying fast.
Soon be over and I will relent.

Let the ocean swell dissolve way my past.
Three days and maybe longer. Won't even know I've left.
Under your tongue I'm like a tab.
I will give you what you're not supposed to have.
Under my breath I swear by sin.
For better or for worse, a best we began.

Let the sun climb, oh burn way my mask.
Three days and maybe longer. Ahead my skin at last. Shed, shed...

Let the sun shine burn way my mask.
Three days and maybe longer. Won't ever find me here.

Let the ocean dissolve way my past.
Four days and not much longer...

Let my spirit pass. Ooh...
This is... x5
This is my last exit.
