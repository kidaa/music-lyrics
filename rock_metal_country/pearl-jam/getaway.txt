Everyones a critic looking back up the river
Every boat is leaking in this town
Everybody is thinking they can all be delivered sitting in a box like lost and found

But I found my place and its all right
Were all searching for a better way
Get this off my plate
Its all right, I got my own way to believe

Find a lighthouse in the dark stormy weather
We all could use a sedative right now
Holy rollers sitting with their backs to the middle all alone and sinking the bow

and if you want to have to pray, its all right
We all be thinking with our different brain get this off my plate
Its all right, I got my own way to believe, its okay

Sometimes you find yourself having to put all your faith in no faith
Mine is mine and yours wont take its place
Now, make your getaway
Science says were making love like the lizards
Try and say that fossils aint profound
Silence says were not allowed to consider
Silence says stand up sit down youre out

But I found my place
and its all right, Im bearing witness to some better things, get this off my plate
Its all right, Ive got my own way to believe
Its okay, sometimes you find yourself being told to change your ways
Theres no way, mine is mine and yours wont take its place, now make your getaway

Its okay, sometimes you find yourself having to put all your faith in no faith
Mine is mine and yours wont take its place
Now make your getaway, its okay
Sometimes you find yourself being told to change your ways
For gods sake, mine is mine and yours wont take its place

Now, make your getaway
