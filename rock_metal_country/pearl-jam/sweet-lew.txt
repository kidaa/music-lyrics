Power high, power low
You could take 'em all to school
You could fly, wilt the stilt had nothing on you
Lambchops and afro-do, milwaukee bucks and a barbecue
#33 just like you
Sweet lew, how could you?
Sweet lew, makin' me blue
A laker trade their bobby-d for a house, a guru by the sea
A little help from 32, showtime, and worthy
Those were the days, pre-investment spree
Sweet lew, is it true?
Sweet lew, how could you?
I grew up trying to copy you, bruce lee, and a kung-fu
Acta jazzman, yogi too
Little did i know, a loose screw
But you had your own shoe
Build him high, build him tall, a taiku with a basketball
Tear 'em down, one and all
7'2" is a long way to fall
Sweet lew, how's the view?
Sweet lew, how could you?
