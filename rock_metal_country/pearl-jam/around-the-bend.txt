i'm wishing you a-well
mind at peace within your cell
covers up, i cast you off 
i'll be watching as you breathe
i lie still, you move 
i send you off around the bend
i hold your head deep in my arms
my fingertips they close your eyes
off you dream, my little child
there's a sun around the bend yes
there's a sun around the bend
all the evenings close like this
all these moments that i've missed
please forgive me, won't you, dear
please forgive and let me share...
with you around the bend
you're an angel when you sleep
how i want your soul to keep 
on and on around the bend
