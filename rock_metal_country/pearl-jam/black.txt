Sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of plain
Her legs spread out before me as her body holds still
All five horizons revolved around her soul as the earth to the
sun
Now the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn

Oooo, and all I taught her was everything
Oooo, I know she gave me yarn that she wore
And now my bitter hands shake beneath the clouds of what was
everything
All the pictures sent all been washed in black
...tattooed everything

I take a walk outside, I'm surrounded by some kids at play
I can feel their laughter, so why do I sear

And twisted thoughts that spin round my head, I'm  spinnin'
Oh I'm spinnin', how quick a sun can drop away
And now my bitter hands cradle broken glass of what was eve-
rything
All the pictures sent all been washed in black
...tattooed everything
All the love gone bad turned my world to black
Tattooed all I see, all that I am, all that I'll be yeaheah

Uhuh...uhuh...oooh
I know someday you'll have a beautiful life
I know you'll be a sun in somebody else's sky
But why, why, why can't it be...how can I be more
