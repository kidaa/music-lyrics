It's out of my hands making your hands meet. 
????? rises crumbling out of reach. 
It's in the cards of destiny your sanity in tow. 

Designate my luck. Uh resignate. 

This power has no roots to guide. No role. 
Trust me. Rusted minds refuse to go. 
Unwillingness is meaningless to walk away in vain. 

Designate my will. 
Ah, designate my fill. 
Ah resignate. 

My will is crashing. Synapses flashing slow. 
Ah, days like frame by frame. Where do they go? 
Ah yeah, why fight? Forget it. Cannot spend it after I go. 

Roll them high. Throw them again. All god's dice. 

Monkey driven. Call this living? Ha. 
Ah, too much thought it's overwrought a hole. 
Yeah, minding yours what's mine not yours. 
Will finish us off. 

Ah, designate my life. 
Ah, designate my view. 
Ah, resignate my will, my will, my will, I will. 
Resignate my god.
