I'm going to Hollywood
They'll see that I'm so good
I won't care how I feel
And I'll get to fuck Brooke Shields
I'll just sit and grin
The money will roll right in
I would give you some
If you only would have treated my nice
You'll wish that you did
you'll feel pretty stupid
I'll just sit and grin
The money will roll right in
I'll just sit and grin
The money will roll right in
It's fun to be a star
It's nice to have a car
Yeah, you'll have to admit
That I'll be rich as shit
I'll just sit and grin
The money will roll right in
The money will roll right in
