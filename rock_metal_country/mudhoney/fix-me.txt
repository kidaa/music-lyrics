Hi, this is Matt Lukin from Mudhoney, and I like to smoke a lot of pot and listen to Black Flag all the time.
Someday
I'll feel no pain
Someday
I won't have a brain
They'll take away the part that hurts
And let the rest remain
Fix me
Fix my head
Fix me please
I don't want to be dead
Someday
We'll all be rich
Someday
I won't listen to you bitch
I'll turn up the volume
And you can hear all the shit we play just for you
Fix me
Fix my head
Fix me please
I don't want to be dead
Someday
I'll feel no pain
Someday
I won't have a brain
They'll take away the part that hurts
And let the rest remain
Fix me
Fix my head
Fix me please
I don't want to be dead
Fix it
My name is Steve. I'm in Mudhoney. And always wear a helmet.
