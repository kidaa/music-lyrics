Shoot for the stars
My, my how lucky you are
Shoot for the stars
My, my how lucky you are
Shoot for the stars
My, my how lucky you are
Shoot for the stars
My, my how lucky you are
Come on, too cool and collected
Claiming how you're so well connected
With the thousands who've defected
Who turn out to be just as wretched
This living wreck
Will come to crash again
Time it tight and I just might
Come back to what you are
Gnats and bats you're trying to hatch
Snakes and buzzards make no kind of match
What the hell you trying to catch
Trading friends for cold hard cash?
This living wreck
Will come to crash again
Time it tight and I just might
Come back to what you are
Shoot for the stars
My, my how lucky you are
Shoot for the stars
My, my how lucky you are
You got to change your life around
And step up to a higher ground
Shoot for the stars where she's been thrown
That's where your ambition's gone
This living wreck
Has come to crash again
This living wreck
Has come to crash again
This living wreck
Has come to crash again
This living wreck
Has come to crash again
Time it tight and I just might
Come back to what you are
