Pull yourself together
Take a stab at forever
Relax and let yourself go
Put yourself together
Take a shot at forever
Sit back, let the tears flow
No time like he present
To get ripped apart
Got this burning desire
Aiming straight for your heart
Suck you dry
Suck you dry
Can't breath until
I suck you dry
Come a little closer
Before I slide over
Come on, I want you burn
Come a little closer
Before I take you over
Come now, watch my burn
No time like he present
To get ripped apart
Got this burning desire
Aiming straight for your heart
Suck you dry
Suck you dry
Can't breath until
I suck you dry
No time like he present
To get ripped apart
Got this burning desire
Aiming straight for your heart
Suck you dry
Suck you dry
Can't breath until
I suck you dry
