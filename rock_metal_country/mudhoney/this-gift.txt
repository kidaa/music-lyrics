I got something waiting for you, that's right
I got something waiting for you, that's right
Got you crawling up the wall, uptight
Well, I've got something waiting for you, tonight
I got this gift
Gift from God
I got this gift
Gift from God
I got this gift
Gift from God
Pointing my heart at you
At you
This gift's so pure
This gift's so rare
Much too much too much for you to bear
Coming down from above
They all leave her alone
I got this gift
Gift from God
I got this gift
Gift from God
I got this gift
Gift from God
Pointing my heart at you
I got this gift
Gift from God
I got this gift
Gift from God
I got this gift
Gift from God
Pointing my heart at you
At you
At you
