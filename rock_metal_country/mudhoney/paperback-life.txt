All the things you have done
Come back to hurt me
All the guys you have seen
A bag of tricks and me
It's everything you do
My love's too good for you
My love's too good for you
You keep changing your mind
Don't think I'm good enough for you
And with all these griefs
You break a heart in two
You're a mean, mean girl
Please stay out of my world
Please stay out of my world
Ahhhhhhh
All things you have said
To make you be on t.v.
It's like a daytime soap
It's not reality
It's like a dime-store book
A cheap paperback life
A cheap paperback life
