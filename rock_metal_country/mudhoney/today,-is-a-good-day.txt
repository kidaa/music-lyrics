Nothing but dust
Dripping out the pump
The cows are milking blood
God only knows what that is
Raining down from above
Today is a good day
Today is a good day
Today is a good day
Today is a good day
The crops are all diseased
Rotten fish line
the dried river bed
Orphan cries fill the valley
Nearly every mother's dead
I can't help but wonder
Can't help but wonder
Can't help but wonder
Will you be next?
Today is a good day
Today is a good day
I still got you
Today is a good day
Today is a good day
I still got you
Watching you in your fitful sleep
There's one thing I pray
Please, please God
Let tomorrow be as good as today
Today is a good day
Today is a good day
I still got you
Today is a good day
Today is a good day
I still got you
I still got you
I still got you
I still got you
