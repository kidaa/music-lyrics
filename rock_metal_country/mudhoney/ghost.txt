I'm a ghost
I'm driftin' into oblivion
Just a gray, old ghost
And a messy oblivion
Well I've had my hopes
They're not what they used to be
I've had hopes
That's between you and me
I've been thinking
I could find some meaning
I could start believing
'stead of killing time
I've been thiking
Your love could give me meaning
I could start believing
'stead of killing time
I think I could love, if you show me
What your lovin' is
I think you could show me with a little kiss
Just a little kiss
If you're my host
Don't serve me no misery
If you're some host
Don't serve me no misery
'Cause I've had dreams
Sure, they're not what they used to be
Yeah, I've had dreams
But, that's between you and me
I've been thinking
I could find some meaning
I could start believing
'stead of killing time
I've been thinking
Your love could give me meaning
I could start believing
'stead of killing time
I think I could love, if you show me
What your lovin' is
I think you could show me with a little kiss
Just a little kiss
A need a fix and a kiss
Like this
Owwwwww
Well, if you're some queen
Don't delude me with grandeur
If you're some queen
Don't delude me with grandeur
'Cause I've been brought down
By false love's power
I've been knocked to the ground
By false love's power
I've been thinking
I could find some meaning
I could start believing
'stead of killing time
I've been thinking
Your love could give me meaning
I could start believing
'stead of killing time
I think I could love, if you show me
What your lovin' is
I think you could show me with a little kiss
Just give me a kiss
Not a punch and a kick
Owwwwww, fix me
Well, all right
