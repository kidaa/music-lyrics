Allright, look out
I'm sick
I'm so sick
Of getting sick
Everytime I lose my connection
I'm tired
So tired
Of getting up in the morning
For that long uphill walk
To the methadone clinic
There's gotta be an easier way
Now hold on a second
This burnin'
There's a change comin'
My blackened spoon
I suggest to you,
That it takes five seconds
Just five seconds
To put a morphine suppository
All the way inside
Brothers and sisters
Do you know what I'm talkin' about?
I'm talkin about a full on
Motherfucking
