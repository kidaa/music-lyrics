Oh I got these looks
That just won't quit
I got at least
A half of some kind of wit
I got a guitar
Check it out, I'm a star
Hey kids, how would I look on
The cover of Spin?
Well, well
We're all gone
Well, well
Right on, right on, right on
Listen to my songs
I guarantee you'll relate
Look at me
Recognize your face
My daddy's rich
And my mama's good lookin', yeah
Hush little baby
So am I
Well, well
We're all gone
Well, well
Right on, right on, right on
I'm the spokesmodel of your generation, baby
I'll lose my shirt
For ventilation
Thanks to the kids
For making me who I am
Twenty percent of the gross
Goes straight to the man
Well, well
We're all gone
Well, well
Right on, right on, right on
