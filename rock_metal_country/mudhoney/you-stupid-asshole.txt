You take your clothes off
I started to laugh
That's when I knew it was through
Guess although I'll take a bow
There's nothing else to do
You stupid asshole
You know you make me sick
You stupid asshole
Baby suck my dick
One, two, I'm looking at you
And there ain't nothing I miss
Three, four, I'm closing the door
'Cause you no longer exist
Guitar
I hear these words pounding in my brain
I need a girl who puts out
But you don't and it's causing me pain
And it's causing me doubt
You're a stupid asshole
Baby, I'm one, too
You're a stupid asshole
I don't know what to do
One, two, I'm looking at you
And there ain't nothing I miss
Three, four, I'm just a fucking whore
'Cause you no longer exist
'Cause you no longer exist
