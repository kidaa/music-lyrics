When I look in the mirror
In front of me
In any old mirror
That's in front of me
Trouble, trouble
Is all I see
The shadow I cast
Is dark and long
Beware of my shadow
It's dark and long
When I turn your corner
You best be gone
Since the day of my birth
I've known I wasn't right
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm not right
Got something awful
Living inside
Oh look out
Well, I'm at the end of my rope
And the end of my days
At the end of my rope
At the end of my days
Gonna storm the Pearly Gates
And make them pay
