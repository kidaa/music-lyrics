I feel your stare: the eyes of a buzzard
Yeah, I've been there behind the shrike
Got me feelin' like a second cousin
Twice removed as I pass you by
On a real low vibe
The waves are hittin' kind of heavy
Every crash lands amplified
Birds and worms are runnin' 'round frenzied
Back at my place there ain't no time
On a real low vibe
On a real low vibe
I can't feel time
On a real low vibe
