As she withered away before my eyes
I guess I ran away while kneeling at her bedside
I was helpless, all I did was cry
No longer able to hold the tears inside
I thought I was dead when I found her
She saved my life and now she's gone
I thought I was dead when I found her
Where does that leave me now?
I could have died a million times
I'm not sure if I ever did
I'm going to die at least one more time
Still not sure if I've ever lived
I thought I was dead when I found her
She saved my life and now she's gone
I thought I was dead when I found her
Where does that leave me now?
Where does that leave me now?
Everywhere I look I see her face
And I can't get her out of my head
Unless you come over into my place
And lie down in my bed
Baby help me forget
Baby help me forget
Baby help me forget
Baby help me forget
Baby help me forget
Baby help me forget
Baby help me forget
Baby help me forget
