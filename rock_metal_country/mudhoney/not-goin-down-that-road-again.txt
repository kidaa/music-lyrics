I'm not goin' down that road again
Can't [tell] too many times
They're gonna follow you my friend
........ you one more time
Not goin' down that road again
I'm not goin' down that road again
Ain't nothing new to see
You know I followed it to the very end
Nearly ruined me
Not goin' down that road again
I'm not goin' down that road again
Learn my lesson ..................
I've found the way to heaven
But I've been on the road to hell
Not goin' down that road again
Not goin' down that road again
Not goin' down that road again
Not goin' down that road again
Not goin' down that road again
