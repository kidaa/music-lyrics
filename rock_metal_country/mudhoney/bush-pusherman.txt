Every bone
Deal with grease
Every muscle
Quivers before release
My blood-shot eyes
Scan the road
A couple dogs in the corner
Are making drunken love
You have to love me
You have to smile
I hope I don't repulse you
I'm a sensitive guy
Please don't hate me
I never asked to be born there
I know I'm bad, make me
Believe me and understand
If I was a woman
I'd hate me, too
That's why, my fragile flower
I'm just for you
You have to love me
You have to smile
Please don't laugh at my body
I'm a sensitive guy
I'm pushing, pushing the bush
Don't push back
If I happen to wake you
Moving around the bush
Don't wake me
You have to love me
You have to smile
I hope I don't repulse you
I'm a sensitive guy
You have to love me
You have to smile
Please don't laugh at my body
I'm a sensitive guy
