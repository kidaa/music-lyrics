I know you're name
You're stupid, little Bea
You're just fifteen
But baby can't you see
That I
Love
That I'm in love little girl?
Please, please don't ever cheat on me
I'm so lazy
Don't get out of bed until twelve o'clock
Got no time for working
Don't want a job
But you
Know
That I'm in love little girl
Please, please don't ever cheat on me
Please, please don't ever cheat on me
Your mom is out
And your dad is working all night
If he comes home early
There's going to be a big fight
I'm in
Love
Because I love you little girl
Please, please don't ever cheat on me
Please, please don't ever cheat on me
Please, please don't ever cheat on me
Please, please don't ever cheat on me
Please, please don't ever cheat on me
