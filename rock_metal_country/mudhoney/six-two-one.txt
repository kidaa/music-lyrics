Aaah
Well, six long years, with the Devil at my side
There's a lot of things that'll do you no good
As you waste away and here on the couch
Your time spent here is doing no one no good
No good
Confusion reigns
Confusion is king
Confusion is the state you'll find me in
Confusion reigns
Confusion is king
Confusion is the state you'll find me in
Now, I'm not saying that I'm all right
And I'm not saying I can show you the light
'Cause I see darkness day and night
It's been six long years with the Devil at my side
At my side
Confusion reigns
Confusion is king
Confusion is the state you'll find me in
Confusion reigns
Confusion is king
Confusion is the state you'll find me in
