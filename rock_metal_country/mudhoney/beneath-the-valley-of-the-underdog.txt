In the Catholic seamen's club
Every sailor is sacred
In the arcade right next door
All the girls dance naked

Down on my knees scrubbin' the floors
Scratchin' at festering sores
If I'm the guy you're lookin' for
Just look down under some rock
Beneath the valley of the underdog

Spat upon by passers by
The spittin' image of my maker
Even those who once called me "friend"
Were liars, thieves or fakers

And to my love who cast me off
I hope you finally made it
If you ever want to look me up
Just look down under some rock
Beneath the valley of the underdog

Beneath the valley of the underdog
Beneath the valley of the underdog
Beneath the valley of the underdog
Beneath the valley of the underdog
Beneath the valley of the underdog
Beneath the valley of the underdog
