Overdrawn
In need of cash
Not a job in sight
Let's rob this goddamn bank, you know
The next thing I know
We had eleven people sprawled out on the black and white tiled floor
While the manager stuffed our flower pillow cases full of green
Stepping over the unarmed guard
And stepped into daylight
And into a right bad dream, now
Underide
You by my side
Smoking tires
Underide
Underide
You by my side
Underide
Never thought we'd get away with it
Much less get out of that bank alive
From here on out it was just a matter of driving
There weren't limits in my confidence
With a tank full of gas
A trunk full of cash
And two miles to the state line
And a county full of roads to get lost in
We had it made
I was so glad I didn't hear that screech
Because our plan was working
Underide
You by my side
Smoking tires
Underide
Underide
You by my side
Underide
I don't know where a lot of sirens and a sudden lightning storm
The only thing that made any sense was this guy and his fricking face
This guy kept smiling at us
";What are you looking at?
Lets get the fuck out of here,"; she screamed
I pushed the gas pedal out of the bank parking lot
And into the back of a Chevron Tanker
Oh, baby, I lost my head
Oh, baby, I lost my head
Oh, baby, I lost my head
Looking at you
Oh, baby, I lost my head
Oh, baby, I lost my head
Oh, baby, I lost my head
Looking at you
Underide
Flame and fire
Smoking tires
Underide
Underide
You're out of sight
By my side
Underide
