You swear you still got the fire
But when I touch you
You feel so cold
Your as hollow as your burned out eyes
Nothing left
Nowhere to go
Nowhere
Nowhere
Nowhere
You got nowhere to go
Desire burns you from the inside out
How does it feel
Not to feel?
I can't stand it when your around
Reminding me how you used to be
Real
You used to be
You used to be
You used to be
You used to be real
In the blood, it gets in the blood
In the blood, it gets in the blood
In the blood, it gets in the blood
In the blood, it gets in the blood
Woh, oh, oh, oh
Woh, oh, oh, oh
Woh, oh, oh, oh
Woh, oh, oh
It gets in the blood
