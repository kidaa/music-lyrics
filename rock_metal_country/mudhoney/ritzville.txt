Wear my heart on my sleeve
And my head on the curb
Got a sign on my cell that reads ";do not disturb";
Fell asleep in a blizzard sometime last night
Woke up alone, freezing and white
Hey, hey mister chicken where have you been
Hunting for trophies among the evergreens
Going back to Ritzville
Don't ask why
Going back to Ritzville
Don't ask why
Going back to Ritzville
Don't ask why
It's a good a place as any to go and die
It's a good a place as any to go and die
Have you heard of my girl, I mean the other day?
Took her out with the sheriff, had a roll in the hay
In a cell stewing over some bum rap
I say off my girl, along with that sap
They say the headless chickens are taking over
They say I lost mine over a four leaf clover
Going back to Ritzville
Don't ask why
Going back to Ritzville
Don't ask why
Going back to Ritzville
Don't ask why
It's a good a place as any to go and die
It's a good a place as any to go and die
They say you always return to the scene of your crime
Well I'm taking the scene, but I'm not sure if its mine
Going back to Ritzville
Don't ask why
Going back to Ritzville
Don't ask why
Going back to Ritzville
Don't ask why
It's a good a place as any to go and die
It's a good a place as any to go and die
Going back to Ritzville
Don't ask why
Going back to Ritzville
Don't ask why
Going back to Ritzville
Don't ask why
It's a good a place as any to go and die
It's a good a place as any to go and die
