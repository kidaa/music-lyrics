Alone the kitchen with the
Crap in the cupboard
You save for later
For when he leaves you all alone
You're so excited
He's finally gone
You used to miss him
Now you're so turned on
You used to miss him
Now you're so turned on
Pokin' around
Gotten out of hand
I feel for you
I feel for you
Pokin' around
Lover you can't stand
I feel for you
I feel for
I hover above you
Looking over your shoulder
In the dingy kitchen
You're looking so much older
He's out on the town
Looking for you
Living the way you'd like
You make your own truth
Livin' the way you'd like
You make your own truth
Pokin' around
Gotten out of hand
I feel for you
I feel for you
Pokin' around
Wants another hole
I feel for you
I feel for you
Pokin' around
Lover, you can't stand
I feel for you
I feel for you
