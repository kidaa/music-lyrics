Brand New Face
Hey baby, I love your face
I love your face
Baby, baby, I love your face
I love your brand new face
You've never looked better
I've just got to tell you
I love your brand new face
They did a great job on you
I detect a swagger in the way that you walk
And a sass in the way that you talk
Good God, you stop the clock
And you went backwards, around the block
Hey baby, I love your face
I love your face
Baby, baby, I love your face
I love your brand new face
You've never looked better
In fact, you look stellar
I love your brand new face
Must be nice to stop growing old
Too bad they can't give you a soul
What'd they do with the rest of your nose?
I bet that you won't decompose
Owwwww
Hey baby, I love your face
I love your brand new face
Baby, baby, I love your face
I love your brand new face
You never looked better
Ah hell, you look stellar
I love your brand new face
I love your brand new face
I really love your brand new face, yeah
I love your brand new face
