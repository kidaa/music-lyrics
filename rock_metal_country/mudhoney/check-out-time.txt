He checked out
Gone for good
He checked out
Without a doubt
Like a regular guy
Like you and me
Unfinished business
His too small voice
Had died in his head
No one could hear
When it told him loud and clear
It's check-out time
It's check-out time
He was always good
At following directions
He ran them out till the end of the road
He did what he was told
Step by step
He never wondered if he had
Might be wrong it's voice he heard
Was a voice of a liar
He took it in stride
They told him
It's check out time
Check-out time
Check-out time
Check-out time
Check-out time
