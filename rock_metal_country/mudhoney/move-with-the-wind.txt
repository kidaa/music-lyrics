Water is wet
And rocks are hard
But the wind, my friend
Does what it wants
So, I move with the wind
I move with the wind
If I move at all
What do you do with a drunken sailor?
What the hell? How should I know?
What do you do with a drunken sailor
When you don't know what to do with yourself?
I move with the wind
If I move at all
We've run aground
Stuck on these rocks
I guess I'm all wet
That's how I got caught
That's how I got caught
That's how I got caught
Hook, line and sinker
Consider this then think of nothing
Ah, wouldn't that be nice
Close your eyes, feel the ocean rising
Floatin' on a bed of spice
I move with the wind
If I move at all
We've run a ground
Stuck on these rocks
I guess I'm all wet
That's how I got caught
That's how I got caught
That's how I got caught
Hook, line and sinker
