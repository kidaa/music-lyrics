Like stacks and stacks of rats on rafts
Clutchin' anything we can
Like stacks and stacks of rats on rafts
Weight of the world crushin' our backs

Tooth for a tooth
Eye for an eye
You know it's the truth
And this is why

Poisoned water poisons the mind

Backed in the corner
Drinkin' Poisoned Water
Payin' for the sins of our fore-fathers
Who've beaten and cheated and raped our mother
Ever since gettin' kicked out of the garden

Can you see?
Are you blind?
There's no more teeth
And this is why

Poisoned water poisons the mind

Poisoned water poisons the mind
Poisoned water poisons the mind
