If I try I could fly
Right through that window
If I try I could fly
Right through that window
Just can't find my way to the door
When I land I know I will not
Be injured
When I land I know I will not
Be injured
There's no way that
I can hurt any more
Got an open line
Up on the thirteenth floor
Got an open heart
Up on the thirteenth floor
Found an open window
Up on the thirteenth floor
Everything's wide open
Oh, on the thirteenth floor
