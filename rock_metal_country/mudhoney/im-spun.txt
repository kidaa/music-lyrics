I'm spun
I'm spun
I'm spun
I'm spun
Let's get it straight, I'm a ricochet
Oh, bouncing off these walls
I could hit you all
When you see me come
You just better run
Yeah, yeah, the world keeps spinning
It don't affect the way I'm thinking
I'm spun
Out of this skull
I'm spun
Now you're stung
Let's get it straight, I'm a ricochet
Bouncing off these walls
I could hit you all
When you see me come
You'd just better run
Yeah, yeah, the earth spins today
My head spins the other way
Now you see what happened to me
Watch me feeling
Get the feeling
Afraid it's true, it can happen to you
You know it's true, it can happen to you
Never know when you'll snap
Never know when you'll break
Never know when you'll crack
All you know is you can't trust fate
I'm spun
I've come undone
I'm spun
You're overcome
Let's get it straight, I'm a ricochet
Bouncing off these walls
I could hit you all
When you see me come
You better run
I'm spun
