Good morning dear, I think I'm losing it
Can't find my way and I'm, I'm getting used to it
Sun refused to shine on this side of the street
I'm not recognizing anyone I meet
Trying to hide in the shadow of the sun
You're not fooling anyone
Oh, acetone
Won't you ever leave me alone?
Oh, acetone
Oh, acetone
Look at me and answer truthful now
Did you drink that last spoonful down?
She drinks from the bitter cup
I'm trying to get her to give it up
Oh, Lord what have we become?
We're not fooling anyone
Oh, acetone
Why can't she leave you alone?
Oh, acetone
Oh, acetone
My feet are dragging down on this dusty old road
My throat is dry and I'm all alone
I remember when we walked side by side
When I was parched I would drink in your sight
I never meant to make you run
I never meant to hurt anyone
Oh, acetone
Why couldn't you leave us alone?
Oh, acetone
Oh, acetone
Oh, acetone
Why wouldn't you leave us alone?
