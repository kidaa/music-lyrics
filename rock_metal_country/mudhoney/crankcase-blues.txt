Got that crankshaft sticking
Straight into your center line
When the piston goes down
Your blood is sure to poison your mind
Got a broke down engine
But you're not losing any speed
Going downhill so fast
You're sure to burn, sure to burn
Sure to burn and bleed
Fully cranked, weeks at a time
Believing you're some kind of machine
She gave you water
When you asked for gasoline
Got a broke down engine
But you're not losing any speed
Going downhill so fast
You're sure to burn, sure to burn
Sure to burn and bleed
Got a mess of problems
You insist on telling everyone
Too bad, too bad, too bad
Your motor mouth still runs and runs
Got a broke down engine
You're not losing any speed
Going downhill so fast
You're sure to burn, sure to burn
Sure to burn and bleed
