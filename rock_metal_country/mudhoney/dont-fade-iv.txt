My dreams are turned to rust
Leaving nothing, and nothing is enough
Today
Today
So broken up, way down inside
Too hurt to try to hide
Away
Away
I had that dream again last night
That I woke up to everything all right
Dream
Don't fade away
Dream
Don't fade into another shitty day
Out my window it only gets worse
In my mirror it's getting worse
Look away
I had that dream again last night
That I woke up to everything all right
Dream
Don't fade away
Dream
Don't fade into another shitty day
I have this dream every night
The same dream again and again
I dream I'm awake
And everything
Is all right
Dream
Don't fade away
Dream
Don't fade away
Dream
