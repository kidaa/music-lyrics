OK, grunge-masters, here we go
Everybody loves us
Everybody loves our town
That's why I'm thinking lately
The time for leaving is now
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
It's so overblown
Everybody loves us
Man, they give me the creeps
And you're up there shaking and flexing
Display of a macho freak
Now you've got their attention
And you've got so very far
They gave your very own spotlight
Just like some real rock star
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
It's so overblown
Show them, Stevie
You got a sack full of candy
All I got was a rock
They got you by your big business boy
Nice to know you're packing extra socks
Everybody loves us
Everybody's getting kind of old
Couldn't hold a regular job
Long live rock and roll
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
It's so overblown
Overblown
Overblown
Overblown
Overblown
It's all over and done
