This really feels like flying
Am I lighter than air?
Perhaps I'm on the water, floating
God knows this could be anywhere
At least my lungs are still breathing
At least my heart still beats
At least my brain is still thinking
At least that's what I believe
I believe I remember slippin'
Or maybe slidin' or trippin'
The whole damn scene was rippin'
Unstable and bitin' and sickenin'
I believe I remember slippin'
Or maybe slidin' or trippin'
The whole damn scene was rippin'
Unstable and bitin' and sickenin'
Get behind me
Stand back all you devils
Get behind me
Stand back all you devils
Get behind me Good God all mighty
Stand back all you devils
Get behind me Good God all mighty
Stand back all you devils
Get behind me, too
Get behind me
Get behind me
Get behind me
I've passed one hundred thousand houses
Every door wide open
And no place feels like home
How long must I keep going?
