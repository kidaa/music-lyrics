Sweet young thing ain't sweet no more
Sweet young thing ain't sweet no more
Mama found her draped over the toilet bowl
oooh
Mama said, ";child, what you done?";
Mama said, ";child, what you done?";
";Wake up and greet the midday sun";
Sweet young thing ain't sweet no more
Sweet young thing ain't sweet no more
Mama's little pills spilled all over the floor
oooh
oooh, ow, ow, ow
Mama can't handle her on her own
Mama can't handle her on her own
She says, ";You just wait till your father gets home";
