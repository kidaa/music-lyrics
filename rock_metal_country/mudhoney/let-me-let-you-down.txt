Let me let you
Let me let you
Let me let you
Let me let you
Let me let you down
Ooooh
Let me let you down
Ooooh
Let me let you down
Ooooh
Let me let you down
Sitting pretty like a snake in the grass
Got the world within my grasp
All coiled up, ready to strike
Give me a reason not to bite
It's your world, trying hard to fit in
Think I would if I could only shed my skin
Let me let you
Let me let you
Let me let you
Let me let you
Let me let you down
Ooooh
Let me let you down
Ooooh
Let me let you down
Ooooh
Let me let you down
Ooooh
Don't let them tell you you're no fun
Don't let them tell you that you're too young
Don't be afraid now, come a little closer
I'll show you how it's made, I'll make you feel older
I'll give you knowledge beyond your days
Daddy, daddy, wash me down with your sweet tears
Let me let you
Let me let you
Let me let you
Let me let you
Let me let you down
Let me let you down
Let me let you down
Let me let you down
Let me let you down
Let me let you down
Let me let you down
