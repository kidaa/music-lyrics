Running nightly
Through the streets of Jacksonville
Seeking out swampy refuge
In some Florida glade
Oh ain't no refuge
In the Everglades, my friend
No buffalo
Live in the Everglades
Ball-peen hammer
Gunning for my head
Florida buffalo
Long since dead
Squeeze my orange
Until the juice runs down my leg
Caught in the movie house
Orange juice on my leg
Landed in jail
Lost my turn
Let me tell you now
A day without orange juice
Is like a night in jail
Ball-peen hammer
Gunning for my head
Running with orange juice
Dripping down my leg
Ball-peen hammer
Gunning for my head
Florida orange juice
Dripping down my leg
Ball-peen hammer
Gunning for my head
Florida buffalo
Long since dead
