Well, it's 1995, my friend
Now we're closing in on the end
Another year for you and me
Time to recognize what you see
What you looking at
What you looking at
What are you looking at?
What are you looking at?
It's 1995 all right
They say I'm lucky to be alive
Yeah, me and everybody else
Along with you and everybody else
Huh
What you looking at
What you looking at
What the fuck are you looking at?
What are you looking at?
It's getting ugly
