Oh who you drivin' baby? all right
Sing it with me baby, all right
Hoo, hoo, hoo
Now
Now
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey girl
Watch what you're doing
The way you keep running around
Gonna be a ruin
Drivin' reckless in your pinto
Full tank of gas
When you get rear ended, girl
Gonna be a hell of a crash
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Who you drivin' now?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, girl
Wrap him around your finger
All the boys follow you
But you don't got the singer
You're drivin' my T-Bird
But the gauge is on empty
Don't get in, don't look back
You got no fuel left
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Who you drivin' now?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Who you drivin'?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Who you drivin'?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Who you drivin'?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Who you drivin' now?
Now
