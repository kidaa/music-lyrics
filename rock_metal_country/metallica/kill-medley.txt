Kill/Ride Medley

Ride the Lightning

Guilty as charged 
But damn it, ain't right 
There is someone else controlling me 
Death in the air 
Strapped in the electric chair 
This can't be happening to me 
Who made you God to say 
I'll take your life from you! 

Flash before my eyes 
Now it's time to die 
Burning in my brain 
I can feel the flames 

No Remorse

No mercy for what we are doing 
No thought to even what we have done 
We don't need to feel the sorrow 
No remorse for the helpless one 

War without end 
No remorse No repent 
We don't care what it meant 
Another day Another death 
Another sorrow Another breath 
No remorse No repent 
We don't care what it meant 
Another day Another death 
Another sorrow Another breath 

Hit the Lights

No life till leather 
We are gonna kick some ass tonight 
We got the metal madness 
When our fans start screaming 
It's right well all right 
When we start to rock 
We never want to stop again 

Hit the lights 
Hit the lights 
Hit the lights 

You know our fans are insane 
We are gonna blow this place away 
With volume higher 
Than anything today the only way 
When we start to rock 
We never want to stop again 

Hit the lights 
Hit the lights 
Hit the lights 

The Four Horsemen

Time 
Has taken its toll on you 
The lines that crack you face 
Famine 
Your body it has torn through 
Withered in every place 
Pestilence 
For what you have had to endure 
And what you have put others through 
Death deliverance for you for sure 
There is nothing you can do 

Phantom Lord

Sound is ripping through your ears 
The deafening waiting for his whips 
The taste of leather on you lips 
Your bodies waiting for his whips 
The taste of leather on you lips 

Hear the cry of War 
Louder than before 
With this sword in hand 
To control the land 
Crushing metal strikes 
On this frightening night 
Fall onto your knees 
For the Phantom Lord 

Victims falling under chains 
Your hear them crying death pains 
The fists of terrors breaking through 
Now there's nothing you can do 

Hear the cry of War 
Louder than before 
With this sword in hand 
To control the land 
Crushing metal strikes 
On this frightening night 
Fall onto your knees 
For the Phantom Lord 

Fight Fire with Fire

Soon to fill our lungs the hot winds of death 
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath 

Fight fire with fire 
Ending is near 
Fight fire with fire 
Bursting with fear 
Fight fire with fire repeat
