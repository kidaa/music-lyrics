Fuel

Gimme Fuel, 
Gimme Fire, 
Gimme that which I desire, 
Ooh! 

Turn on...I see red 
Adrenaline crash   crash my head 
Nitro Junkie, Paint me dead 
And I see red 

One hundred plus through Black and White 
War Horse, Warhead 
Fuck 'Em Man, white knuckles tight 
Through Black   White 

Ohhh, On I Burn, 
Fuel is pumping engines, 
Burning hard, loose   clean 

And I burn, 
Churning my direction, 
Quench my thirst with Gasoline 

So Gimme Fuel, 
Gimme Fire, 
Gimme that which I desire, 

Hey 

Turn on beyond the bone 
Swallow future, spit out home 
Burn your face upon the crome 
Yeah! 

Take the corner, join the crash, 
Headlights, Headlines 
Another Junkie lives too fast 
Yeah lives way too fast, fast, fast, oohh-aye 

Ohhh, On I Burn 
Fuel is pumping engines 
Burning hard, loose   clean 

And On I burn 
Churning my direction, 
Quench my thirst with Gasoline 

So Gimme Fuel 
Gimme Fire 
Gimme that which I desire 

Yeah-Heah 

White Knuckle Tight! 
solo 

Gimmie Fuel.... On I burn, on and on 
Gimmie Fire.... On I burn, on and on 
My Desire.... 

Ohhh, On I Burn 
Fuel is pumping engines 
Burning hard, loose   clean 

And I burn 
Churning my direction 
Quench my thirst with Gasoline 

Gimme Fuel 
Gimme Fire 
Gimme that which I desire 
Ooh 

On I Burn!
