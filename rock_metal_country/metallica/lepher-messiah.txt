Lepher Messiah

Spineless from the start, sucked into the part 
circus comes to town, you play the lead clown
Please, please 
spreading his disease, living by his story 
Knees, knees 
falling to your knees, suffer for his glory 
You will 

Time for lust, time for lie 
time to kiss your life goodbye 
Send me money, send me green 
Heaven you will meet 
Make a contribution 
and you'll get a better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah 

Marvel at his tricks, need your Sunday fix 
blind devotion came, rotting your brain 
Chain, chain 
Join the endless chain 
Fame, Fame 
Infection is the game, stinking drunk with power 
We see 

Time for lust, time for lie 
time to kiss your life goodbye 
Send me money, send me green 
Heaven you will meet 
Make a contribution 
and you'll get a better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah 

Bow to Leper Messiah 
Witchery, weakening 
Sees the sheep are gathering 
set the trap, hypnotize 
now you follow 

Time for lust, time for lie 
time to kiss your life goodbye 
Send me money, send me green 
Heaven you will meet 
Make a contribution 
and you'll get a better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah 

Lie.
