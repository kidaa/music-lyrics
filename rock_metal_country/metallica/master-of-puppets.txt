Master Of Puppets

End of passion play, crumbling away 
I'm your source of self-destruction 
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear 
Leading on your deaths construction 
Taste me you will see 
more is all you need 
you're dedicated to 
how I'm killing you 

Come crawling faster 
obey your Master 
your life burns faster 
obey your Master 
Master 
Master of Puppets I'm pulling your strings 
twisting your mind and smashing your dreams 
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing 
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream 
Master 
Master 
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream 
Master 
Master 

Needlework the way, never you betray 
life of death becoming clearer 
Pain monopoly, ritual misery 
chop your breakfast on a mirror 
Taste me you will see 
more is all you need 
you're dedicated to 
how I'm killing you 

Come crawling faster 
obey your Master 
your life burns faster 
obey your Master 
Master 
Master of Puppets I'm pulling your strings 
twisting your mind and smashing your dreams 
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing 
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream 
Master 
Master 
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream 
Master 
Master 

Master, Master, Where's the dreams that I've been after? 
Master, Master, You promised only lies 
Laughter, Laughter, All I hear and see is laughter 
Laughter, Laughter, laughing at my cries 
Hell is worth all that, natural habitat 
just a rhyme without a reason 
Neverending maze, drift on numbered days 
now your life is out of season 

Come crawling faster 
obey your Master 
your life burns faster 
obey your Master 
Master 
Master of Puppets I'm pulling your strings 
twisting your mind and smashing your dreams 
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing 
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream 
Master 
Master 
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream 
Master
