Eye Of The Beholder

Do you see what I see?
Truth is an offence
You silence for your confidence

Do you hear what I hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must

Do you feel what I feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express

Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd

Doesn't matter what you see?
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is mad for you my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception

Do you fear what I fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me

Do you choose what I choose?
More alternives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative

Do you need what I need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside to each his own

Do you trust what I trust?
Me, myself and i
Penetrate the smoke screen I see through the selfishlie

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is mad for you my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception

Do you know what I know?
Your money end your wealth
Your silence just to hear your self

Do you want what I want?
Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence lengthen freedom's ring

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is mad for you my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say
