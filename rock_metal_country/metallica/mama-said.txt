Mama Said
Hetfield, Ulrich

Mama she has taught me well
Told me when I was young
Son, your life's an open book
Don't close it fore it's done
The brightest flame burns quickest
Is what I heard they say
A son's heart's owned to mother
But I must find my way

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama let your heart go
Or let this heart be still

Rebel my new last name
Wild blood in my veins
Apron strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
Left home at an early age
Of what I heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what I said is done

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama let your heart go
Or let this heart be still

Never I ask you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still

Mama now I'm coming home
I'm not all you wished of me
But a mother's love for her son
Unspoken, Help me be
I took your love for granted
And all the things you said to me
I need your arms to welcome me
But a cold stone's all I see

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama let your heart go
Or let this heart be still

Let my heart go
Mama let me heart go
You never let me heart go
So let this heart be still

Never I ask you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still
