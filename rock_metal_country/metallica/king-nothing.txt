King Nothing
Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett

Wish I may
Wish I might
Have this wish tonight
Are you satisfied?

Dig for gold
Dig for fame
You dig to make your name
Are you pacified?

All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased

And it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around

Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle crumbled
And you've left with just a name

Where's your crown?
King nothing

Hard and cold
Bought and sold
A heart hard as gold
Are you satisfied

Wish I may
Wish I might
You wish your life away
Are you pacified

All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased

And it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around

Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle crumbled
And you've left with just a name

Where's your crown?
King nothing

I wish I may 
I wish I might
Have this wish I wish tonight

I want the star
i want it now
I want it all and i don't care how

Careful what you wish
Careful what you say
Careful what you wish
You may regret it

Careful what you wish
You just might get it

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around

And it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around

Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle crumbled
And you've left with just a name

Where's your crown?
King nothing

Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle crumbled
And you've left with just a name

Where's your crown?
King nothing
