The Outlaw Torn
Hetfield, Ulrich

And now I wait my whole lifetime
For You
And now I wait my whole lifetime
For You

I ride the dirt, I ride the tide
For you
I search the outside, search inside
For you

To take back what you left me
I know I'll always burn to be
The one who seeks so i may find
And now I wait my whole lifetime

Outlaw of torn
And I'm torn

So on I wait my whole lifetime
For You
So on I wait my whole lifetime
For You

The more I search, the more my need
For you
The more I bless, the more I bleed
For you

You make me smash teh clock and feel
I'd rather die behind the wheel
Time was never on my side
So on I wait my whole lifetime

Outlaw of torn
And I'm torn

Hear me
And if close my mind in fear
Please pry it open
See me
And if my face becomes sincere
Beware
Hold me
And when I start to come undone
Stitch me together
Save me
And when you see me strut
remind me of what left this outlaw torn
