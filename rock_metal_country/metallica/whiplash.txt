Whiplash

Late at night all systems go
You have come to see the show 
We do our best You're the rest 
You make it real you know 
There is a feeling deep inside 
That drives you fuckin' mad 
A feeling of a hammerhead 
You need it oh so bad 

Adrenaline starts to flow 
You're thrashing all around 
Acting like a maniac 
Whiplash 

Bang your head against the stage 
Like you never did before 
Make it ring Make it bleed 
Make it really sore 
In a frenzied madness 
with your leather and your spikes 
Heads are bobbing all around 
It is hot as hell tonight 

Adrenaline starts to flow 
You're thrashing all around 
Acting like a maniac 
Whiplash 

Here on the stage the Marshal noise
is piercing through your ears 
It kicks your ass kick your face 
Exploding feeling nears 
Now is the time to let it rip 
To let it fuckin' loose 
We are gathered here to im and kill 
Cause this is what we choose 

Adrenaline starts to flow 
You're thrashing all around 
Acting like a maniac 
Whiplash 

The show is through the metal is gone 
It is time to hit the road 
Another town Another gig 
Again we will explode 
Hotel rooms and motorways
Life out here is raw 
But we will never stop 
We will never quit 
cause we are Metallica

Adrenaline starts to flow 
You're thrashing all around 
Acting like a maniac 
Whiplash
