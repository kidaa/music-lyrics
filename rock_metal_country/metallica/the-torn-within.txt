The Torn Within
Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett

Forgive me father
For I have sinned
Find me guilty of the life I feel within
And when I'm branded
This mark of shame
Should I look down disgraced
Or straight ahead
And know that you must blame

Chorus:
I am the secret
I am the sin
I am the guilty
And I, I am the thorn within

Forgive me father
For I have sinned
Find me guilty when true guilt is from within
So point your fingers
Point right at me
For I am shadows and will follow me
One and the same are we

Chorus

I do your time
I take your fall
I'm branded guilty
For us all

So point your fingers
Point right at me
For I am shadows and will follow you
One and the same are we

Chorus
