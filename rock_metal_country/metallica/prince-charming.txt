Prince Charming

It's a black cloud over head 
That's me 
And the poison ivy chokes the tree 
Again it's me 
I'm the filthy one on Bourbon Street 
You walk on by 
I'm the little boy that pushes hard 
And makes him cry 

There's a dirty needle in your child 
Ha ha, stick me 
An empty bottles still in hand still dead 
Still me 
I'm the suit and tie that bleeds the street 
And still wants more 
I'm the 45 that's in your mouth 
I'm a dirty, dirty whore 

Yeah look it's me 
The one who can't be free 
Much too young to focus 
But to old to see 

Hey look it's me 
What no one wants to see 
See what you brought this world 
Just what you want you want to see 
Hey ma, hey ma look it's me 

Yeah, he wants to become father now 
Me again me 
The marks inside your arms, spell me 
Spell only me 
I'm a nothing face that plants the bomb 
And stroles away 
I'm the one who doesn't look quite right 
As children play 

Yeah look it's me 
The one who can't be free 
Much too young to focus 
But to old to see 

Hey look it's me 
What no one wants to see 
See what you brought this world 
Just what you want you want to see 
Hey ma, hey ma look it's me 

It's me... 
Solo 1 

Look up to me, 
What to be and what to fear 
Look up to me 
Look it's me, at what you hear 
See right through me 
See the one who can't be free 
See right through me 
Look it's me what no one wants to see 

Hmmm, now, see the black cloud up ahead 
that's me 
And this poison ivy chokes the tree 
Again it's me 
And I'm the filthy one on Bourbon Street 
You walk on by 
I'm the little boy that pushes, pushes 
Makes him cry 

Yeah look it's me 
The one who can't be free 
Much too young to focus 
But to old to see 

Hey, hey, look it's me 
What no one wants to see 
See what you brought this world 
Just what you want you want to see 
Hey ma, hey ma look it's me 

Hey ma, hey ma look it's me
