Ooo Ma
Ooo Pa

Must the show go on?

Ooo Pa take me home,
Ooo Ma let me go.

There must be some mistake,
I didn't mean to let them take,
Away my soul.  
Am I too old?
Is it too late?

Ooo Ma.
Ooo Pa.
Where has the feeling gone?
Ooo Ma.
Ooo Pa.
Will I remember this song?
Ooo
The show must go on.
