Far, far, far away - way
People heard him say - say
I will find a way - way
There will come a day - day
Something will be done. Then at last the mighty ship
Descending on a point of flame
Made contact with the human race
And melted hearts Now, now, now is the time - time
Time to be - be - be awareCarter's father saw him there and
made contact with the human race at Mildenhall.
Knew the Rhull revealed to him the 
glowing soul of Heremond the Wake. 
Oh, my, something in my eye - eye
Something in the sky - sky
Waiting there for me The outer rope rolls early back
The service men were heard to sigh
For there revealed in glowing robes
Was Lucy in the sky
Oh - oh - did you ever know - know
Never ever will they
I cannot say 
Something in his cosmic art
And glowing slightly from his toes
The psychic and the nations fly
