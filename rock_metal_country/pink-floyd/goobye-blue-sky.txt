[Childs voice:]
Look, Mummy. There's an airplane up in the sky.

Did you, did you see the frightened ones
Did you, did you hear the falling bombs
Did you ever wonder why we had to run for shelter,
When the promise of a brave new world,
Unfurled beneath a clear blue sky
Did you, did you see the frightened ones
Did you, did you hear the falling bombs
The flames are all long gone,
But the pain lingers on.
Goodbye, blue sky.
Goodbye, blue sky.
Goodbye.
Goodbye. 

Mother

Mother, do you think they'll drop the bomb
Mother, do you think they'll like this song
Mother, do you think they'll try to break my balls
Ooooowaa Mother, should I build a wall
Mother, should I run for President
Mother, should I trust the government
Mother, will they put me in the firing line
Ooooowaa Is it just a waste of time
Hush, my baby. Baby, don't you cry.
Momma's gonna make all of your nightmares come true.
Momma's gonna put all of her fears into you.
Momma's gonna keep you right here under her wing.
She won't let you fly, but she might let you sing.
Momma's gonna keep Baby cozy and warm.
Oooo Babe.
Oooo Babe.
Ooo Babe, of course Momma's gonna help build a wall.
Mother, do you think she's good enough,
For me
Mother, do you think she's dangerous,
To me
Mother will she tear your little boy apart
Ooooowaa Mother, will she break my heart
Hush, my baby. Baby, don't you cry.
Momma's gonna check out all your girlfriends for you.
Momma won't let anyone dirty get through.
Momma's gonna wait up until you get in.
Momma will always find out where you've been.
Momma's gonna keep Baby healthy and clean.
Oooo Babe.
Oooo Babe.
Ooo Babe, you'll always be Baby to me.
Mother, did it need to be so high
