I am just a new boy,
Stranger in this town.
Where are all the good times?
Who's gonna show this stranger around?

Ooo, I need a dirty woman.
Ooo, I need a dirty girl.

Will some woman in this desert land,
Make me feel like a real man?
Take this rock and roll refugee.
Ooo Babe, set me free.

Ooo, I need a dirty woman.
Ooo, I need a dirty girl.

Ooo, I need a dirty woman.
Ooo, I need a dirty girl.
