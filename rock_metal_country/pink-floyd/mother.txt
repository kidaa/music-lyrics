Mother, do you think they'll drop the bomb?
Mother, do you think they'll like this song?
Mother, do you think they'll try to break my balls?
Ooowaaa, Mother, should I build a wall?

Mother, should I run for President?
Mother, should I trust the government?
Mother, will they put me in the firing line?
Oooowaaa, is it just a waste of time?

Hush, my baby, Baby, don't you cry.
Mamma's gonna make all of your nightmares come true.
Mamma's gonna put all of her fears into you.
Mamma's gonna keep you right here under her wing.
She won't let you fly, but she might let you sing.
Mamma's gonna keep Baby cozy and warm.

Ooo Babe.
Ooo Babe.
Ooo Babe, of course Mamma's gonna help build a wall.

Mother, do you think she's good enough,
For me?
Mother, do you think she's dangerous,
To me?
Mother will she tear your little boy apart?
Oooowaaa, Mother, will she break my heart?

Hush, my baby. Baby, don't you cry.
Mamma's gonna check out all your girlfriends for you.
Momma won't let anyone dirty get through.
Mamma's gonna wait up until you get in.
Momma will always find out where you've been.
Mamma's gonna keep Baby healthy and clean.
Ooo Babe.
Ooo Babe.
Ooo Babe, you'll always be Baby to me.

Mother, did it need to be so high?
