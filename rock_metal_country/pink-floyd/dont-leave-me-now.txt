Ooo, Babe,
Don't leave me now.
Don't say it's the end of the road.
Remember the flowers I sent.
I need you, Babe,
To put through the shredder in front of my friends.
Oh Babe,
Don't leave me now.
How could you go?
When you know how I need you,
To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night.
Oh Babe,
Don't leave me now.
How can you treat me this way?
Running away.
Oh Babe,
Why are you running away?

Ooo, Babe,
Ooo, Babe,
Ooo, Babe,
Ooo.
