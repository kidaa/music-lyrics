Look, Mummy. There's an airplane up in the sky.

Did you, did you see the frightened ones
Did you, did you hear the falling bombs
Did you ever wonder why we had to run for shelter,
When the promise of a brave new world,
Unfurled beneath a clear blue sky

Did you, did you see the frightened ones
Did you, did you hear the falling bombs
The flames are all long gone,
But the pain lingers on.
Goodbye, blue sky.
Goodbye, blue sky.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
