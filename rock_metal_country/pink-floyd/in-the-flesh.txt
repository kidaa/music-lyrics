So ya thought ya might like to,
Go to the show.
To feel the warmth thrill of confusion,
That space cadet glow.
Tell me is something eluding you, Sunshine?
Is this not what you expected to see?
If you wanna find out what's behind these cold eyes,
You'll just have to blow your way through this disguise.
