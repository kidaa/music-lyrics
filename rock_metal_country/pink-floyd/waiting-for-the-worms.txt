Ooo, You cannot reach me now,
Ooo, No matter how you try.
Good bye cruel world, it's over.
Walk on by.

Sitting in a bunker,
Here behind my wall,
Waiting for the worms to come.
In perfect isolation,
Here behind my wall,
Waiting for the worms to come.

Waiting,          to cut out the dead wood.
Waiting,          to clean up the city.
Waiting,          to follow the worms.
Waiting,          to put on a black shirt.
Waiting,          to weed out the weaklings.
Waiting,          to smash in their windows and kick in their doors.
Waiting,          for the final solution to strengthen the strain.
Waiting,          to follow the worms.
Waiting,          to turn on the showers and fire the ovens.
Waiting,          for the queers and the coons and the Reds and the Jews.
Waiting,          to follow the worms.

Would you like to see Britannia,
Rule again, my friend?
All you have to do is follow the worms.
Would you like to send our colored cousins,
Home again, my friend?
All you need to do is follow the worms.
