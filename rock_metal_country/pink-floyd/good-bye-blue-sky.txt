Look, Mummy, There's an airplane up in the sky.

Ooo,
Ooo,
Ooo,

Did, did, did, did, did, you see the frightened ones?
Did, did, did, did, did, hear the falling bombs?
Did, did, did, did, did, ever wonder why we had to run for shelter,
When the promise of a brave new world,
Unfurled beneath a clear blue sky?

Ooo,
Ooo,
Ooo,

Did, did, did, did, did, see the frightened ones?
Did, did, did, did, did, you hear the falling bombs?
The flames are all long gone,
But the pain lingers on.

Good bye, blue sky.
Good bye, blue sky.
Good bye.
Good bye.
