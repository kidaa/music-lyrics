Fuck all that we've got to get on with these
Got to compete with the wily Japanese
There's too many home fires burning
And not enough trees

So fuck all that
We've got to get on with these

Cant stop, lose job, mind gone, silicon, stop bomb
What bomb, get away, pay day, make hay
Break down, need fix, big six
Clickity click, hold on, oh no, brrring bingo!

Make 'em laugh, make 'em cry, make 'em dance in the aisles
Make 'em pay, make 'em stay, make 'em feel ok

Not now John
We've got to get on with the film show
Hollywood waits at the end of the rainbow
Who cares what it's about
As long as the kids go
So not now John
We've got to get on with the show

Hang on John
I got to get on with this
I don't know what it is
But it fits on here like thisss
Come at the end of the shift
We'll go and get pissed
But not now John
I've got to get on with this

Hold on John
I think there's something good on
I used to read books but
It could be the news
Or some other abuse
Or it could be reusable shows

Fuck all that we've got to get on with these
Got to compete with the wily Japanese
No need to worry about the Vietnamese
Got to bring the Russian Bear to his knees

Well, maybe not the Russian Bear
Maybe the Swedes
We showed Argentina
Now lets go and show these

Make us feel tough
And would'nt Maggie be pleased
Nah nah nah nah nah nah!

One, two, three, four

S'cusi dove il bar
Se para collo pou eine toe bar
S'il vous plait ou est le bar
Oi' where's the fucking bar John!
