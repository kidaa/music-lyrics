B.R. Hornsby
We've lived around here most all of our lives
Did most anything we wanted to do
We will celebrate every 4th of July
Just a little tamer than most of the rest of us do
Don't light a match, don't play with fire
Pull down easy on the gas lighter
There's a shelter down at the veteran's hall
Living in the shadow of the hot house ball
We can dance in the streets any night or day
The big ball men built such a nice old park
One day we'll celebrate every halloween
Our faces as masks everyone glow in the dark
Don't light a match, don't play with fire
Step real lightly round the barb wire
Keep the noise down to hear the meltdown call
Living in the shadow of the hot house ball
Temper's hot, better pray for rain
Better watch out now for the gamma rays
Party time at the government gate
Don't light a match, don't play with fire
Pull down easy on the gas lighter
There's a shelter down at the veteran's hall
Living in the shadow of the hot house ball
