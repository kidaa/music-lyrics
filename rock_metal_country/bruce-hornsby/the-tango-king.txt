B. R. Hornsby
Parking lot's full, the crowd's here
All to see and hear the food and beverage seer
Bumpin' time, everyone side to side
Left allemand and do-pah-so time
Here she comes, coming round the bend
Been to the bathroom and she's going back again
Just to give a good cold shoulder next time
Been around town and we're going again
Hallelujah when you get to the end
Summer's come now don't you feel the sting
All going down looking for the tango king
Look at Pete, he's a lounge hand
All want to stand where he stands
Spin that girl neath the colored ball
Fancy plaid man's the envy of all
Been around town and we're going again
Hallelujah when you get to the end
Summer's come now don't you feel the sting
All going down looking for the tango king
All the sounds, and the truth is found with a
drink in hand
Kings of lounge, and button-downs are coming
back again
Coming back again
Been around town and we're going again
Hallelujah when you get to the end
Walk on cut glass wouldn't feel a thing
All going down looking for the tango king
