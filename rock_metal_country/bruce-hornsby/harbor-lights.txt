B. R. Hornsby
Close your eyes and slip away
To the dream of your fancy
Close your eyes and float downstream
To where the marsh grass dances
Take you down where the air is thick
Try to make you shake and shiver
Make you see there will be no tricks
There will be no tricks tonight
Ther will be some tricks tonight
We could go down to the harbor lights
Lay out on the sand on the shore
Let me take you down to the docks at night
Whatever you do I'll do more
Take some hours and waste them away
Let your mind flow freely
Take some time and forget about time
You may find a little feeling
I can see you shining with sweat
Like to make you shake and shiver
We could feel the air so wet
We could feel it all tonight
We could feel it all tonight
We could go down to the harbor lights
Lay out on the sand on the shore
Let me take you down to the docks at night
Whatever you do I'll do more
Take you down where the air is thick
Like to make you shake and shiver
What I'll show you've probably seen
Why not come on again
Why not come see it again
We could go down to the harbor lights
Lay out on the sand on the shore
Let me take you down to the docks at night
Whatever you do I'll do more
