B. R. Hornsby
Well he came to town with a strong pull
Would flash his moves for the worshipful
Shoulder moves from side to side
Go over your head and dot your eyes
Every night about a quarter to ten
>From the middle of June to the summer's end
People would gather from miles around
To see the mighty Rainbow knock 'em down
He'd pull up from around the back
Folk's say, ";There's Rainbow's Cadillac";
Fancy shirts and shorts of plaid
Coat of more colors than Joseph had
Every night about a quarter to ten
>From the middle of June to the summer's end
People would gather from miles around
To see the mighty Rainbow knock 'em down
Take a quarter from the collection plate
Every night he would dominate
Jump to the top and pick off a dime
Throw it down at the proper time
Every night about a quarter to ten
>From the middle of June to the summer's end
People would gather from miles around
To see the mighty Rainbow knock 'em down
