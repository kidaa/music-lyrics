Train rolls by about 3 a.m.
Wakes me from a fitful sleep
Got the urge to jump on board
I believe I'm in a little too deep
Walk the train station
Walking through the park
Looking out for something
Still in the dark
One day you'll see something
Oh, with a familiar ring
It'll be just me moving through
On the way to something
It's your life, it's your world
It's your world, and I'm just passing through
It's your life, it's your world
Your life, and I'm just passing through
Tired and confused, yes I am
Don't see much in the future for me
I'm a vagabond and a drifter
Not so hard to be
Walking down the highway
Walking through the park
Looking out for something
Still in the dark
Don't know what to say when I see you smile
So I guess I'll turn my head and go
On the way to another mile
It's your life, it's your world
It's your world, and I'm just passing through
It's your life, it's your world
Your life, and I'm just passing through
Walking down the highway
Walking through the park
Looking out for something
Still in the dark
Want faith in something
So hard to believe
Maybe one night soon
Maybe you could make me see
It's your life, it's your world
It's your world, and I'm just passing through
It's your life, it's your world
Your life, and I'm just passing through
