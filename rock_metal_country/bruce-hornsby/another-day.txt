Woke up this morning looking at the screen
There's a couple of men talking
I'm not sure what they mean
There's a conversation many men running wild
We learn about the world while they're fighting in the aisles
Here we go
What do you say, what do you know
You've got your life and you watch it away
It's just another day in this old town
So get down
Home Shopping Channel's got us by the eyes
Scrambling to the phones ordering porcelain flies
Talk to the women talk to the wives
Everybody's buying important things for their lives
Here we go
What do you say, what do you know
You've got your life and you watch it away
It's just another day in this old town
So get down
He's a high performance engine with Jesus as the fuel
Old father's handing out forty acres and a mule
Preaching the word of prosperity
Make a little more money they might just put you on t.v.
Here we go
What do you say, what do you know
You've got your life and you watch it away
Ain't no big thing it's just another day
Ain't no big thing so let it ring
Let it ring George
Turn off the lights honey then turn off the set
Life around here don't make a lot of damn sense
As I closed my eyes I saw in my mind
Somebody selling me a nickle for a dime
Here we go
What do you say, what do you know
You've got your life and you watch it away
It's just another day in this old town
So get down, ain't no big thing so let it ring
In this old town so get down
It's another day so go ahead
Go ahead
Everybody go
