I met a fan dancer down in southside Birmingham
She was running from a fat man selling salvation in his hand
She said he's tryin' to save me
But I'm doin' alright, the best that i can
Just a pair of fallen angels tryin' to get through the night
Step by step, one by one, higher and higher
Step by step, one by one, climbing Jacob's ladder
Comin' over the airwaves the man says I'm overdue
Sing a song, send money, join the chosen few
But mister I'm not in a hurry, and I don't want to be like you
All I want from tomorrow is to get it better than today
Step by step, one by one, higher and higher
Step by step, one by one, climbing Jacob's ladder
All I want from tomorrow is to get it better than today
Step by step, one by one, higher and higher
Step by step, one by one, climbing Jacob's ladder
