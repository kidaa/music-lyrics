Well she was so fine
On the first impression
I was taken, taken in by the view
With eyes so soft
And a face so smooth
I found her selling in a fashion booth
All that I said was ";Do you sell suits?";
She said you're a scream and your accent's so cute
Her mother had to meet me, it all sounded funny
But then my friends told me well the girls got money
It's alright, It's okay
Hey don't you worry about a thing
You're the king today but there's a price you may pay
If you take your seat in the royal suite
You might get stranded on easy street
Well she said she was
A good time girl
Laughing laughing a bit too loud
Such a face
The specialist creates
She gets the benefit of the doubt
I know that she wanted more than I could give
But I just had to see how the other half lived
She showed me her friends, she showed me her throne
I didn't sell my soul I just took out a loan
It's alright, It's okay
Hey don't you worry about a thing
You're the king today but there's a price you may pay
If you take your seat in the royal suite
You might get stranded on easy street
She runs to her mother the social x-ray star
She put me at the wheel of her father's new car
She loved how her touch made me want to drive farther
She loved how her money meant she'd tell me how far
It's alright, It's okay
Hey don't you worry about a thing
You're the king today but there's a price you may pay
If you take your seat in the royal suite
You might get stranded on easy street
