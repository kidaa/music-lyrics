B. R. Hornsby/John Hornsby
About this time of evening, out by the bay
They turn the roadlights on the bridge
A diesel rolls in silhouette, eastbound
Lovers glad the sun has set
I'm staring into the twilight
Wishing I could find someone tonight
I know she's out there somewhere
On the western skyline
Lonely women say a prayer
On the western skyline
The rooftops sag on second street
Bachelor's quarters, too much fun,
not enough fun
The kite's still hanging on the wire
Waiting on the wind
Too many dreams, not enough hope
Voices on my radio
Telling me where I should go
I know she's out there somewhere
On the western skyline
Lonely women say a prayer
On the western skyline
They'll set up on the bandstand
When the sailors hear the whistle blow
Underneath the streetlight
Violence in the afterglow
Give me a shiny Cadillac
Close your eyes past that city limits sign
He's got the admiral's daughter in the back
Trying to cross her battle line
As I'm staring into the twilight
Wishing I could be with her tonight
I know she's out there somewhere
On the western skyline
Lonely women say a prayer
On the western skyline
