B. R. Hornsby/John Hornsby
Here I am
I'm in a gaseous haze
Ten lanes and tall boys
Going both ways
El dorado riding on the fringe
Aztec princess take revenge
This ain't my style, this ain't my home
I'm going where it's safe to roam
Take me all the way back
To the wild frontier
Well I'm counting the miles
Seeing her smile in the wild frontier
Electric sun
Electric hair
Leather skin
Leather underwear
She said hey
I'm getting in the biz
Come on over
I'll show you where some action is
This ain't my style, this ain't my home
I'm going where it's safe to roam
Take me all the way back
To the wild frontier
Well I'm counting the miles
Seeing her smile in the wild frontier
