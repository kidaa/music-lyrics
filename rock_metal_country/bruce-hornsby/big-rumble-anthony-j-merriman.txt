B. R. Hornsby
Cocked and ready oh here I stand
Anticipating the laying on of hands
Might be frivolous, may be profound
But it feels like deliverance going down
Hey now, come on around
The big rumble is coming down
Go tell it on the mountainside
Over the hills and across the sky
Hey now, watch out, run
Big rumble is about to come
Go tell it to the people there
Over the hills and everywhere
The young girls screaming as the gym rat speaks
Might see some walk-on on a shooting streak
Big snake charmers and medicine men
Some like Daniels in the lion's den
Hey now, come on around
The big rumble is coming down
Go tell it on the mountainside
Over the hills and across the sky
Hey now, watch out, run
Big rumble is about to come
Go tell it to the people there
Over the hills and everywhere
A man with a ball as a saviour too
A strange conception of the holy truth
The biggest and the baddest of Moses too
Works for some, maybe me and you
Hey now, come on around
The big rumble is coming down
Go tell it on the mountainside
Over the hills and across the sky
Hey now, watch out, run
Big rumble is about to come
Go tell it to the people there
Over the hills and everywhere
