B. R. Hornsby/John Hornsby
There's a man workin' in a field
See's the rain and it's burning
He's saying this can't be real
As he sees the color of the fields turning
Far away the men too busy getting rich to care
Close their eyes and let it all out into the air
Hoping nobody else would care
Look out any window
Look out any open door
Look out any window
See what's going on in the world around you
There's a man working on a boat
Pulling lines from the water
Just trying to stay afloat
Filling the nets is getting harder
Far away they bend the rules so secretly
Close their eyes and let it all out into the sea
Hoping nobady else would see
Look out any window
Look out any open door
Look out any window
See what's going on in the air around you
Far away too many leaders let them get their way
Close their eyes and let it all out into the bay
Say they'll clear it up another day
Look out any window
Look out any open door
Look out any window
See what's going on in the air around you
Look out, look out for the big boys
telling you everything they're gonna do
Look out, look out for the fat cat builder man
turning this into a wasteland
Look out, look out for the back room boys
that say the smokw is gonna blow away
Look out, look out for the men who say it's okay
sitting in a building far away
