B. R. Hornsby/John Hornsby
It came on fast when I heard the blast
And the main generator gave a giant gasp
It was round about midnight, about half past
And the city went black as coal so fast
Oh, what a time
Everybody was fazing, hazing
Oh, what a time
It was time to be amazing
Time to lose all reason or rhyme
What a time
It was bad to worse, as the landlord cursed
And the water tank in the backyard burst
We were slipping and sliding and killing thirst
And we couldn't see a soul doing it in the dirt
Oh, what a time
Everybody was praising, raising
Oh, what a time
It was time to be amazing
Time to lose all reason or rhyme
What a time
A thousand people singing in the dark
Couldn't see a thing
A thousand people singing in the dark
Oh, what a time
Everybody was razing, grazing
Oh, what a time
It was time to be amazing
Time to lose all reason or rhyme
What a time
