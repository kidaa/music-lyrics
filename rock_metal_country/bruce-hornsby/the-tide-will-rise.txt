B. R. Hornsby/John Hornsby
Sometimes I get lucky
Most times I come up short
Got to pull up the lines
Got to move around the bend
They say it's a dying breed
They say it's going to disappear
Nothing I can do, oh but pull up the load again
The tide will rise
And the tide will fall
We'll be out on the water
Before the break of dawn
The tide will rise
And the tide will fall
Oh, we'll be working on the water
When the long, long day is gone
Full moon it was always best
Keep a little and you sell the rest
Living on hope that the seed is sown again
Red sky in the evening
Better times are coming up they say
Well, why do I feel like it's all coming to an end
The tide will rise
And the tide will fall
We'll be out on the water
Before the break of dawn
The tide will rise
And the tide will fall
Oh, we'll be working on the water
When the long, long day is gone
When the seed is broken
Nothing left to grow on
When you lose the seed
It's hard to bring it on back
Never bowed to no one
Always went my own way
Broke down, run around, but I won't run away
And the tide will rise
The tide will rise
And the tide will fall
We'll be out on the water
Before the break of dawn
The tide will rise
And the tide will fall
Oh, we'll be working on the water
When the long, long day is gone
