Well I saw her one day
At the corner cafe
Everybody there knew she's a wonder
I sat there all night
Too shy to say
Honey you could keep me from going under
Oh my my when she walks on by
It's hard not to get lost in the view
How can you know if the feelings a lie
When love comes out of the blue
North, south, east, west
Up, down, all around and all the rest
I'll go anywhere she wants me to go
Of all the girls I've loved she's the best
She's the one
Till the dreaming's done
Well I left in the springtime long, long ago
Funny but I never got to know her
Some people tell me she stayed alone
And if things were different
I'd go and show her
But oh my my when she walks on by
It's hard not to get lost in the view
How can you know if it's truth or a lie
When love comes out of the blue
North, south, east, west
Uptown, downbound, and all the rest
I'll go anywhere she wants me to go
Of all the girls I've loved she's the best
She's the one
Till the dreaming's done
Oh my my when she walks on by
It's hard not to get lost in the view
How can you know if the feelings a lie
When love comes out of the blue
North, south, east, west
Uptown, downtown and all the rest
I'll go anywhere she wants me to go
Of all the girls I've loved she's the best
She's the one
