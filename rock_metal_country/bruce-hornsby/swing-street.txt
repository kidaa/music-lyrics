I heard you say that tonight's the night
You say there's a party going on
I'm in the door lik an old 78 side
And I hear 'em out hitting on a Coleman song
My friend John with a mirror and spoon
Got a belt and a mainline scene
A couple getting off in the back room
Someone's collecting money for the friend in need
Sounds like a good time, a ball to me
Sounds like a place I'd like to be
Theres a little crowd you're gonna want to meet
Oh they got a thing going on swing street
Nice old man in the corner booth
Making time with Jive-time Stu
She makes her sting 'neath the table blue
Says she's an actor but she's hooking
as a sideline too
Oh sounds like a good time, a ball to me
Sounds like a place I'd like to be
Everybody rolls when it's time to meet
Oh they got a thing going on swing street
Got a good thing going down swing street
You say there's nothing but bums around here
Listen to the sound of the cymbal so clear
Cutting contest on the stand
Somebody's trying to blow you away
What makes him swing harder than you do
Oh better hit the woodshed for ninety days
Oh sounds like a good time, a ball to me
Sounds like a place I'd like to be
Theres a little crowd you're gonna want to meet
Oh they got a thing going on swing street
Got a good thing going down swing street
Got a good thing going down swing street
Got a thing going on on swing street
Got a thing going on
Got a thing going on on swing street
