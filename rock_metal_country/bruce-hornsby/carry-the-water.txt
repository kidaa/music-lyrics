B. R. Hornsby
Some live life with eyes that don't see
They look away at the time of your greatest need
Some talk, some'll just do, some turn their back
Turn around and just walk away I know I've done that
Lonely Days and lonely nights
Easy to be cynical never put yourself on the line
I'd like to reach out well why don't I
Take the load up off your back I'd like to try
Let me carry your water
Let me carry the weight
I will bear your burden
Let me carry the load
Working hard sweating all day in the long hot sun
Feel alone with the heavy load you're not the only one
Bossman say time to jump we say how high
If you need a hand getting off your feet baby I'll try
I want to cover you the the sea on the sand
Easy to be cynical never take a stand
Easy for me not to give a damn
I'll ask you to call for me and I'll give you a hand
Let me carry your water
Let me carry the load
I will shoulder your burden
Let me carry the load
Lonely nights and lonely days
You wait for someone to come along and sweep you away
I'll put myself out there it just might feel good
I don't always do that but I think I should
