B. R. Hornsby
She walked into town in a long white gown
And the band played on with no one around
And the rice was gone oh hours ago
And the white wheeled limosine's standing alone
Well they met at the club where the brasses blow
Where the wine did flow oh he moved so slow
But finally one night as the wind stood still
He got up the nerve and she said ";I will";
The day did come and the groomsmen arrived
Came a little early to go over their lines
As they walked to the church on the cobblestones
Was heard in the bushes a moan and a groan
Well she walked into town in a long white gown
And the band played on with no one around
And the rice was gone oh hours ago
And the white wheeled limosine's standing alone
She didn't want to think that she lived a lie
There was always talk of a wandering eye
He'd come to the club and he'd look all around
It took a fair minded man not to wonder aloud
Well she walked into town in a long white gown
And the band played on with no one around
And the rice was gone oh hours ago
And the white wheeled limosine's standing alone
And the father of the bride is drinking so slow...
