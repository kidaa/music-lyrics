Riding in the early evening I'd say
I know of a certain tree
I always asked if you wanted to go
You'd just sit there silently
Now you say come on let's go
You know where you want to be
As I watch you tan in the waters so brown
Desire gets the best of modesty
Walk me down the side of the water
Lay your weary head on me
Lay your clothes up on the table
Wrap your worries round the red cedar tree
It's a special night
Looks like a special night
There'll be some changes made on the water tonight
Go in a boy and come out a man
Looking out at the water
You say ";What do you think?";
Indecision in my face and arms
You say you either swim or you sink
Sliding off sliding on down
Wetness in the evening mist
No ride in the countryside
Ever compared to this
Walk me down the side of the water
Lay your weary head on me
Lay your clothes up on the table
Wrap your worries round the red cedar tree
It's a special night
Looks like a special night
There'll be some changes made on the water tonight
Go in a boy and come out a man
