B. R. Hornsby
Way out here, working on the docks
Everyone sees the long day through
Well what would I do without the nights
and the phone
And the chance just to talk to you
A thousand miles away
What I wouldn't give for only one night
A little relief in sight
Or someday when times weren't so tight
When the day goes down on the
water town
When the sun sinks low all around
That's when I know I need you now
You're what I miss
Every little kiss
Everybody here's a number, not a name
But I guess that's all right with me
As i sit alone after a long day
In the absence of company
Oh I let my mind wander...
A thousand miles away
What I wouldn't give for only one night
A little relief in sight
Or someday when times weren't so tight
When the day goes down on the
water town
When the sun sinks low all around
That's when I know I need you now
You're what I miss
Every little kiss
