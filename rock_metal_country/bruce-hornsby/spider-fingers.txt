B. R. Hornsby
So nice to be here
With all you good people
Is anybody listening
To what we're doing tonight
Could you give us a chance
While you hit the sauce
Might try a little flash up here
Just to get oursleves across
Hit it
Let the spirit linger
Get up
And do the spider fingers
I could show you on a table
I could show you on a chair
I's best shown on the black and whites
I know I could take you there
It's just a little hand trick
A little prestidigitation
Better get out your Hanon
Practice and repitition
We better do something
Before they tell us to get lost
Sometimes you've just got to repeat yourself
Just to get your point across
Hit it, let the spirit linger
Get up, do the spider fingers
A little spider tongue
How long will we be here
Well babe I just don't know
Depends on fate, the luck of the draw
Or maybe a little flashy show
Hit it
Let the spirit linger
Get up
And do the spider fingers
