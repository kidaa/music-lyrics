B. R. Hornsby
You lie over there in a bed with iron rails
Like a frightened child in the cold light, so frail
Things were going so well,just rolling along
Now, just when you think you got it all made,
You think it's all gone
China Doll, I've got something for you
A few good words, a hand to help you get through
May not be much, but now it's all that I can do
Lay down your weary head
Do whatever you gotta do
Put on your strong face when they're in the room
Can't show signs of weakness; an unspoken rule
Put on your strong face, act like nothing's wrong
We can be so helpless, helpless and so strong
China Doll, I've got something for you
A few good words, a hand to help you get through
May not be much, but now it's all that I can do
To ease your worried mind
Do something to get through
We bend and break, so fragile, it's true
I say everything'll be alright but I don't have a clue
They say faith is a crutch, well whatever works for you
In a world where you never know
I'll be there for you,
I'll be there for you...
China Doll, I've got something for you
A few good words, a hand to help you get through
May not be much, but now it's all that I can do
Lay down your weary head
Do whatever you gotta do
