Welcome to the dark side of the 20th century
The world has gone crazy
Tells you tales and show you things you hardly won't believe
Though you gotta face it
I'm watching the screen
I hear what they say
But I don't believe
The words of today
Walking back in history
The wise men prophesied
That hard times were dawning
Read into their tarots
For the future of mankind
And cried out their warnings
I'm watching the screen
I hear what they say
But I don't believe
The words of today
Needles in the dark
There are needles in the dark
Needles in the dark
There are needles in the dark
Wars and religion
Are a threat to planet Earth
The hunger for power
We'll be victims when we're reaching red alert
In the final hour
[Chorus]
Mountains of madness
Will turn into sadness
We'll die
WHY?
Father creator
Look at mother nature
She cries
Oh Lord in the skies
Please take me away
[Chorus]
