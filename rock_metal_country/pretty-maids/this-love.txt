Girl do you remember
Back when we were worlds apart
Those days are over
Now we're standing heart to heart
Even in a summer love
A little rain must fall
But if we still believe in love
Then love will conquer all
I recall I do remember when
But it has changed a lot
Since now and then
[Chorus:]
No one can put out this fire
So close
No one can take this away
This love
Just lift us higher and higher
I know
Without your love
I wouldn't last a single day
Girl I've gone through heartaches
From paradise to pain
I'd go the distance girl
To shield you from the rain
Climb the highest mountains
Sail she seven seas
Just to show you that the river
Runs for you and me
Now this love is like a solid rock
We gotta hold on babe
To what we got
[Chorus]
High on emotion
We want the nights to last forever
Wild-eyed devotion
We'll fly up high and touch the sky
Like a ball and chain
We're linked together
When it all stand still
When there's only you and noone else
And if you want me to I'd swear to you
There ain't no thing that love can't do
It'll take us of the ground
Everywhere and all around
