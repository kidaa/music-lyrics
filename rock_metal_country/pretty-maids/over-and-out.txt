Calling you somewhere
Out on a distant line
I still regret it
But we both had our times
You were everything
I was innocent
I hope that we'll make it some day
You were my master
I was your crawling slave
You were the difference
Between love and hate
You're the only one
I'm the lonely one
I know that we'll make it some day
Oh girl, I'll give you everything a girl can get
It's all over now
Every night when I'm facing the truth
It's over and out
See your shadow will fade
When it's over and out
Now that love's gone away
Over and out
Girl I beg you to stay
Cause I know that we'll make it one day
Locked in this torment
Inside this prison cell
Jailed by the moment
You're giving me hell
Let me out of here
Make me disappear
Are we gonna make it anyway
Oh girl, I'll give you everything a girl can get
It's all over now
Every night when I'm facing the truth
[Chorus]
You say it's over
I'm wasting my time
You say it's over
Baby, love ain't no crime
You say it's over
Ain't giving you up
No way I can stop
I can't break away from these chains
Can't break away
[Chorus]
