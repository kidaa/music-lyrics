Alone in the streets
It's not easy to survive
You gotta walk tall
And carry your weight to stay alive
All night
You have to fight to hold on
You pay the price
And sacrifice to hold on
Hold tight
Hang tough
Don't let them knock you down
Don't ever stop
Hang tough
Don't let them push you around
Stick by your guns
And shoot for the heart
Hang tough
Another tough night in the city
It won't change
You're breaking all the rules
You say it's driving you insane
All night
You have to fight to hold on
You pay the price
And sacrifice to hold on
Hold tight
Hang tough
Don't let them knock you down
Don't ever stop
Hang tough
Don't let them push you around
Stick by your guns
And stand on your own
Hang tough
[Chorus]
