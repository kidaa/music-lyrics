I ain't got no money
No expensive toys
I ain't no jet set junkie
I'm a punky little unemployed
Got no passion wagon
Get no easy rides
But I do have a trick up mu sleeve yeah
And a heart of gold inside
Comes around and goes around
Always changing hands
Now who said money money
What buys you diamond rings
Won't buy you friends
Life ain't easy living
Always strapped for cash
But I don't give up I don't give in
To me it's all a gas
Got no foxy lady
Wear no fancy suit
Money'll change your thinking
and spoil your attitude
Comes around............
Chorus
Now who said money money
Who said money
Well, I just want some simple common sense
Now who said money money
Who said money money
What buys you diamond rings
Won't buy you friends
I'm so cold in hand
Money has power
A stairway to the stars
On the top of the tower
Everything is so God damn bizarre
Comes around and goes around
Money
I say money comes around
Money goes around
Money comes around
[Chorus]
