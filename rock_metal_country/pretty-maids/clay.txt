I've been drifting around this world a stranger
Been lost in empty space
I've been reaching out to find my saving grace
And I've lived a life of no direction
I've walked the endless mile
I was down and out until I met you child
I want you to take me hold me
Shape me as you please
Want you to love me
I'm down on bended knees
I will be clay inside your hands
I long for your embrace
Let the light of love
Shine upon my face
I've been tangled up in disillusion
Been stuck inside this shell
I was blind to anything around myself
And I've been tied up in this no mans land
This empty wilderness
Found the kiss of life in the fire from your breath
[CHORUS]
And finally found that my destiny
Didn't crash on tireless waves
Now that love has been blessing me
I'm unchained
[CHORUS]
