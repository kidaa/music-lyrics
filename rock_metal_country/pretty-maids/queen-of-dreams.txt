The look in her eyes
makes me cold and brings me in despair
I'm paralysed and my soul is lost in the air
She leaves me the fright
and things that I never have seen
so Queen of the night
won't you please take me out of my dreams
She's living the night
but at dawn she flies away
she's living inside
disappears when night turns to day
She leaves me the fright
and things that I never have seen
so Queen of the night
won't you please take me out of my dreams
Queen of the evil dreams
I'm under your spell
queen of the evil dreams
don't leave me in hell
Get out of my dream
to a place where you never can hurt
but I'm gonna scream
'cause I know she'll always return
She leaves me the fright
and things that I never have seen
so Queen of the night
won't you please take me out of my dreams
[Chorus]
[Solo]
She's takin' my love
and bringing me hate
trying to kill and destroy my fate yeah
She's bringin' me pain and evil shame
I'm lost in my dreams I'm caught in the game, yeah
[Chorus]
