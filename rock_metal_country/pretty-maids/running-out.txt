Don't need no one to tell me what to do
I won't let anybody see me through
Won't let them blind my vision
I'll make my own decisions
No one to interrupt my point of view
No way
Oh no
Don't let no one invade my sanity
Or steal away my own humanity
It ain't no false illusion
They'll leave me with confusion
And try to penetrate my privacy
Too late
I'm a free man
Too late
Feels so good inside yeah
Too late
They can't tame me
Too late
Finally see the light
Running out for love
I'm tired of living among this human race
So insecure I feel so out of place
Don't need no constitution
Religious revolution
Don't need no desert wars or money race
Too late.........
Running out for love
Time after time in a world of decline without love
Where do you go when you know
That the crystal has cracked
And there's no turning back no retreat
I close my eyes in the rain and I hope
Running out
Running out
I'm running out
