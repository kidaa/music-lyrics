He's an outlaw
On a dead end street
Has no choice no road to follow
Between the devil and the deep blue sea
Today's like tomorrow
Oh he's building up inside
Danger in the air
One fatal shot in the street fight
[Chorus]
Raise your flag
Show your colour
All you've got is yourself
Don't turn your back
On your brother
Put your trust in nobody else
Under surveillance
Put in the frame
Doing time in a crossbar hotel
Took his freedom
Took his name
Took his ambitions away
No one could hold him down
He couldn't take it any longer
Raised in a criminal play-ground
[Chorus]
Walking the street as soldier
Day in day out
No one to lend a shoulder
Inside outside all the same
[Chorus]
