So many promises
From master to slave
All lies and emptiness
From the cradle to the grave
We don't need words but action
We want it here
We want it now
What do you think they're doing
For you and me
Better save your life from ruin
[Chorus:]
Rise up
Cry out to the nation
Rise up
Break out off your shell
Rise up
TV generation
Rise up
Go out give'em hell
You've got to clean your claws
Don't take no more
Don't have to hide away
From the colour of your skin
And you don't have to bare the cross
And suffer from their sins
Got to believe in something
Though you have faith in nothing
Life's like a bullet to your head
You've got to come out
What's your conclusion
Now do you believe
In a silent revolution
Rise up
Cry out to the nation
Rise up
Break out from your shell
Rise up
TV generation
Rise up
Go out give them hell
Rise up
Don't put your trust in the flames of the flag
Who's gonna wash of he blood form the tracks
When do the lion
Lie down with the lamb
When do we drop down
The guns form our hands
You see we build this world on solid ground
Do you wanna see it all come down
[Chorus]
