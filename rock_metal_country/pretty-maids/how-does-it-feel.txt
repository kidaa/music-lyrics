See her walking in the street
Big city bitter sweet
Into that poisened rain
She's among familiar faces
In this dirty rotten place
Where only lies remain
She's got the heart of an angel
Her soul open wide
But the hunger has waken the devil inside her
What is it like on this trip you're rinin' baby
Now don't you see there's no safety in hidin'
How does it feel
You've been away too long
Out of touch
Left out on your own
How does it feel
Do you see right from wrong
Lady Lust you're a long way from home
Now she finds her way around
At the lost and never found
She's got to go with the flow
There's a rope around her neck
On the road to her regret
She walks the straight and narrow
In the eyes of the world
She's a nobodys job
A broken down girl
She's stuck on the wild side
What's it like on this trip you're ridin' baby
Now don't you see there's no safety in hidin'
Chorus
Somebody said what you give is what you get
But there's some who gets nothing in return
Out of luck
Down on love
She's getting fed up with anything she does
Chorus
