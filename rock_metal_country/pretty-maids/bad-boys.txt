Saturday night
the kids are back
ready to fight
ready to attack

Chorus:
They are bad boys
they are masters of the town
you are they toy
and they will only bring you down
Out in the streets
the battle begins
dirty deeds
the boys are gonna win

Chorus

Bad bad boys
bad bad boys

Morning light
hits your eyes
such a night
can make you cry

Chorus

Bad bad boys
bad bad boys
