Gonna push it to the limit
Fly like a bird
Tale a one-way ticket
Into another world
Got to be close to the edge
Makes you feel alive
The adrenalin flow
Eats you up inside
Won't you tell us what it's like
Tell us how it feels
It's a suicidal ride
Unreal
It thrills you
Gotta feel that rush
Well it could kill you
'Cause it's a lethal lust
Every hour on the hour
You're driven by desire
Closer to the fire
[Chorus:]
Adrenalin junkie
You're burning out fast
You never slow down
Nor save the best for last
The higher you're climbing
The harder you fall
Adrenalin junkie
You want it all
In your eyes the wildfire rage
The inner voice still scream
Like a rocket into space
Always the first in line
You stand up to the test
High speed on borrowed time
Your body never rest
Every hour on the hour
You feel your pulse is rising
No compromising
[Chorus]
Living in the fast lane
Always in the lead
No mountain high enough
To fulfil your needs
There's no limit's you won't pass
No risk you wont take
You're a wave about to crash
A storm about to break
Time and time again
You're feeling the flame that burns within you
You're never gonna stop
Every hour on the hour
Your heart is beating faster
Headin' for disaster
[Chorus]
