Life in the fast lane
Living against the law
Riding the Speedtrain
Life is worth dying for
When I take off from here
The only way is up
My principals are clear
Too much is not enough
'cause anything worth doing
And all that is worthwhile
Is worth overdoing
And this is my style
Dancing on the edge
I feel alive
Chasin' the red light
Drawn by the dangersigns
Spaced out on the wildside
Crossing the dividing line
And when the night rolls on
I need some fuel to run
I'll be the last man standing
When all the rest has gone
[Chorus]
Life in extreeme
It's my playground my scene
I'll enjoy every moment in time
Taking the scars
As I burn out my star
'cause I wont live by others designs
[solo]
I am a firecracker
Ready to explode
And I am blazing
Crazy
Right till the end of the road
[Chorus]
