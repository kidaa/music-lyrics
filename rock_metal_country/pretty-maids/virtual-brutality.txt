Hit without a warning
Comin like a diverbomb
As the twins are falling
Strike upon the Pengaton
Can't believe my eyes
Staring at the T.V. screen
It's gonna be a lie
Murder in extreem
Like a horror movie scene
Virtual brutality
Right in your face
In the heart of the nation
Virtual Brutality
This is no nightmare
It's happening right here and now
Suicidal pilots
Die a matyr for their cause
Sowing fear inside us
And nevermind the human loss
Evil never sleeps
The devil always finds his way
Panic on repeat
Hell on earth today
Terror on display
[Chorus]
Wake up to a new reality
Is it ever gonna be the same again
Penetrated our fragility
And stole away the lives of innocents
What happened to the world we knew so Well
How do we restore ourselves
I guess the winds of time will tell
There will be justice
Togeteher we'll be strong
All for one
[Chorus]
