My friendly host
I am the ghost that breathes inside
of you
I pull the strings make you do
things
you're not supposed to do
I am disgust in diguise
Unleash the fire
set my spirit free
feel my desire
my atrocity
feel me
within you there's some of me
I'm the one that should not be
In ancient times I lost my wings
and from the sky I fell
condemned my blackened soul
to dwell among the dust of hell
I am the monster of lies
Unleash the fire
set my spirit free
feel my desire
my atrocity
flames rising higher
tell me what you see
feel me within you
there's some of me
I'm the one that should not be
The curse of my name
is the course to your pain
can you feel it
I'm in command
I'm the blood on your hands
I've deceived you
[Chorus]
