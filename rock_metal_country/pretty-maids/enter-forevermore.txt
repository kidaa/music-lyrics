Listen to me
There are things that our eyes can't see
Things that our ears can't hear
Something bigger out there
Something divine
Something good that could change our
Minds
There must be something way down the line
To lead us safe from here
And when you dream
When you can't figure out what it means
You know somethings can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind
Whatever brought us here
That gave us the gift of brith
There's more between heaven and earth
More than meets the eye
Ah ah ah ah ah
Enter forevermore
Do you believe
In what is now forever will be
What comes after eternety
Can you comprehend
And here we are
So close and yet so far
At the end or is it all gonna start
All over again
Was it all worth it
Did we deserve it
Enter forevermore
Have we acomplished
Or did we miss it
Enter forevermore
Did we stand up to the test
Did we really do our best
Enter forevermore
