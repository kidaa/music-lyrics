If you're feeling out of nowhere
If you got no place to go
If you're feeling lost and lonely
When you're down the open road
Oh come on join our show
Here we go
Did they preach you words of wisdom
Did they fill your head with lies
Did they try to break the doorways
To the world behind your eyes
Oh, I want to know
We came to rock
We came to rock
We came to rock
We came to rock
Are you burning with the fever
Are you ready to explode
Can you feel the magic power in your heart
When you hear my voice is calling, calling
Oh come join our show
[Chorus]
We are the faces
We are the guardians of the night
We'll rock the ages
It's all right
We've seen the fire
We are defenders of your rights
We'll take you higher
Gonna take you to the sky
We'll rock until the morning light
We'll rock into your soul
We're gonna hit the stars tonight
We came to rock
To rock and roll
[Chorus]
