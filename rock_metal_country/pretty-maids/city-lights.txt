As the night turns everything black
human fear'll come creeping back
tear apart your desperate fright
but as a rescue city light
glimpse of neon hits your eyes
while you get beaten by violent guys
sound of sirens throught the night
but as a rescue city light

Chorus:
If blood's the answer to darkness pain
no one will ever walk the streets again
has told the cops about that dreadful night
but as a rescue city light

Are you hurt some voices mutter
as your blood runs down the gutter
someone saw a face through the night
but as a rescue city light
darkness melt before my eyes
as the last bit of witchcraft dies
killed this nightmare to giant sighs
but as a rescue city light

Chorus

As the morning reaches a point of greed
voices of horror reject my plea
a grand explosion of human fright
but as a rescue morning light
had it all been a game in my mind
a search for thrills that you cannot find
how much more can you stand these nights
but as a rescue morning light

Chorus
