When the picture re-appears
It might be a thousand years
Two young lovers in a world forget
Two young lovers in silhouette
Before the memory fades away
Be so careful what you say
For the picture is placed beside
Take one last look and close your eyes

Fly away
Don't let your feet touch the ground
Fly away
Don't let the world get you down

Now the picture re-appears
It has brought a thousand years
Two young lovers has a world forget
Two broken hearts is all they've got

Chorus
