Don't remember now
Can't recall somehow
Black holes spotting your memory
So you fell from grace
Tears run down your face
See yourself as the enemy
And now you find yourself
Along the road to nowhere
To find the road leads back to you
Into obscurity
Where darkness blinds in despair
You're running scared
Inside the world where you live
You can be who you wanna be
Look in the mirror
See what you wanna see
[Chorus:]
Scream
Until some one hears your calling
Scream
We don't hear nothing at all
Needle kills the pain
Nothing cures the blame
Feel the fear rising from the deep
Better taste of sin
Razor cross your skin
Better pray for your soul to keep
What do your see outside
The windows that surrounds you
Around your twisted human shell
Now do you hear what other people
Say about you
Look at yourself and suffer
Dive into hell you unholy and rotten
Lay down among the abandoned forgotten now
[Chorus]
And when you sleep at night
Your friends will come alive
You cannot run you cannot hide
Escape from who's inside you
Manic depressive gloom
Reflects your mental wounds
It's creeping up behind you
The serpent crawls inside you
Forever to decline you
