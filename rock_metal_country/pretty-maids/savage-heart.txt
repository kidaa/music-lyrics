I walk the lonely plains
Drift into the distance
Out on a rainy shore
Somewhere in time
Recall a thousand names
All of those we're missing
Out there I'm searching for
A little peace of mind
Who am I to rely on a broken dream
Just a loner in the night
Whenever we loose someone
Whenever we say goodbye
And after the fire's gone
When every flame has died
There will beat a savage heart
Another soldier falls
Dies for God and country
When there's no time for talking
Its time for the guns
Out where the wild wind blows
I'm free as a bird
If I could only transfer
Dreams into words
I'm aware; I'll be there, when the morning comes
Guided by the inner light
Whenever we loose someone
Whenever we say goodbye
And after the fire's gone
When every flame has died
There is still a savage heart
We build our world of flesh and blood
Would you really like to know
If there's a place for all of us
All of us
Who am I to rely on a broken dream
Now my world has blown apart
I'm a man with a savage heart
[Chorus]
