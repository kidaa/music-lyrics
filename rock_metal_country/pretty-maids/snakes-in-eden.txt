You are the lust behind the lie
You are the hate that never die
You are suffering and mistery
You are the cycle of my pain
The never ending strain
And bring out the worst in me
And black is your religion
As the darkest night
A cat among the pigeones
Waiting for the strike
You are the poison in the bite
The ragin' jealousy inside
My wraith and my hostility
You are the virus in my veins
The growing cancer in my brain
You are infidelity
I have watched the cities rot
I have seen the nations fall
And I have denied my God
While you misled us all
Search in myself
Got to face my demons
Rising from hell
There are snakes in Eden
You are blasphemy and decadence
The stealer of my innocense
The worm that wrigles around my soul
You have haunted me right since my birth
Created all scum of the earth
And caused this world eternal cold
You are infernal
You are the mentor of my sins
You are the incubus
The evil from within
[Chorus]
