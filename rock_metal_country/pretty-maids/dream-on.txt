Packed my troubles in a suitcase
I was heading for the door thinking
I don't wanna know about it
You said you've had enough
Well I guess baby, I'm out of luck now
I don't wanna know about it
Hey girl, you took my time
Played your tricks
And stole my wine
I don't wanna know about it
Smile and cheat on me
Crazy little woman, are you feeling free now
I don't wanna know about it
You had me waiting
But you deserted me
Anticipating
Love in the first degree
We rode the storm
We got through heavy weather
Who's gonna be the one
To put the pieces back together
Dream on dream on
Desperation taking over
Dream on dream on all night
Dream on dream on
Got a hard time staying sober
Dream on dream on all night
Dream on
Well I've been running from the heartache
Threw your photographs away
Trying to forget is really not tat easy baby
Can't help going insane
Love is going down the drain
I don't wanna know about it
I was waiting
But you deserted me
Anticipating
Love in the first degree
We rode the storm
And got through heavy weather babe
Let's put the pieces back
Back together
[Chorus]
Still feel this temptation
Won't live in isolation
Can't fight it
Your love
Once you chilled me to the bone
Tell me how to break this heart of stone
Break this heart of stone
Tell me how to break it
