Now wait a minute baby
Don't leave me, don't go
We'll work it out like we've done before
Another lonely night
Without you by my side
Can't take it, can't take it no more
A romantic chase
Two hearts out of phase
When love strikes, I'm out of control
Frustrating my mind
You know love is blind
Reflecting what's deep in my soul
The passion that rules
A feeling so strong
I just can't turn away from you
I may be a fool
But this can't go wrong
I was made for you
Love games
Two people together
Love games
Playing to win
Love games
We're dealing forever in sin
Forever in sin
Caught up in the game
And there's no one to blame
Inside this casino of love
Just messing around
With the face of a clown
Playing until I've had enough
You're rolling the dice
I'm stripped by your eyes
I can't stand the way you're teasing
As sly as a snake
You got all that it takes
You'll make a heart stop beating
[Chorus]
Since the first time you touched me
Just one time too much
Brought me down on my knees
Since the first time we kissed
I was more than possessed
I was eager to please
[Chorus]
