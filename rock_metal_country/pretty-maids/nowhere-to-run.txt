Running around the corridors
blood on the walls
blood on the floors
and you brain is full of fear
evil laughs and dreadful cries
nowhere to run nowhere to hide
seems like death is standing near

Chorus:
Nowhere to run
nowhere to run
what the hell is going on

There's killer behind your back
just waiting for attack
and your heart is breating fast
your body's shaking, you're going insane
something's going on in your brain
death will overtake you at last

Chorus

The night is over, the dawn is breaking
all night long you have been waiting
it's clearing up inside your head
you think you're safe, you're feeling high
but you're wrong I'll tell you why
nobody escapes the castle of death

Chorus
