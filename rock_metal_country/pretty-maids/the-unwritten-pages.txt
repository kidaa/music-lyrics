Everyday routine
Just the same old scene
There's no love between us
It's dying
If I will you wont
If you do I don't
Love is skin and bone
Accusation's flying
Now there's nothing that could solve our differencies
And change our acts of no address
We're only suffering from our reality
It's just a game of hit and miss
All the bridges left behind
The bliss we couldn't find
All the unwritten pages
We don't know what is to come
We can not see beyond
The unwritten pages
No more bitter pills
Mental overkill
We just fool ourselves
All this fuzz and fighting
No more vicious words
All they do is hurt
No more throwing dirt
Girl we're sliding
There ain't no cure for all this heartbreak overload
Our lives are left in disarray
We're holding on to something we lost so long ago
We should have gone our separate ways
[Chorus]
Now love is colder
Like the river turning ice
There ain't no feelings to restore
They're gone forevermore
Nothing to work out
Nothing to retain
You see there ain't no common ground
No passion to be found
We ought to know
