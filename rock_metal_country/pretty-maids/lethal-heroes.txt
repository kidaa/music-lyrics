Get a little frightened sometimes
Get a little cold inside
Catching bad news on the radio
Get a little information
There's a lack of destination
With the talk of global arms control
A fatal pollution
A hole in the sky
In Beirut the hate is burning
Islam revolution
And religious fights
There are lethal heroes in time
Are we lethal heroes gone blind
And often I sit and wonder
I clearly hear the thunder
Coming on strongly with the eastern winds
If there's a God in heaven
From whom the Earth was given
Stop this madness that we're living in
While terror and torture
Is raping our lands
Genocide is taking over
The logical sense
Seems out of hand
[Chorus]
When ever you listen
You'll hear the cry of freedom
But it's a long bloody way
Seems out of reach
When do we teach
How to live
Somebody tell me
[Chorus]
