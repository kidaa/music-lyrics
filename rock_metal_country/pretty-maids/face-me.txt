You slag my name
Insult my crowd
You ruin my day
You count me out
You critisize
Antagonize me
You question me
And my integrety
Now tell me who are you tojuge
If I am out of time and out of touch
Now anytime you pick the place
And I'll be there
Come out and face me
You piece of trash
You son of a bitch
Let's take a bout
Come out and face me
I'll kick your ass
And split your lips
I'll punch you out I'll knock you down
You doubt my skills
Well let me tell you
I despice you stilted
Intelect oh yeah
And then again
I'd rather go to hell
Than ride the trend
And prostitute myself
I know the nature of your kind
Is it the envy deep inside
Or just the fact that I've survived
If it's so
[Chorus]
Trendrider can you show the way
I'd try to be hip for one day
And gone tomorrow
You build me up and tear me down
You change the things I say around
You're telling lies you scumbag
Now tell me what
Give you the right
I hate you guts
You God damned parasite
And no one gives a fuck
Of what you think about who you are
Your opinion sucks tabloid superstar
Every word that you wrote just to hurt me
I'll shove 'em down your throat you little piece of shit
[Chorus]
