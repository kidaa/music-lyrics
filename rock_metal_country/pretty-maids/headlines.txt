Out on the edge of a human landslide
Out in the ruins of yesterday
We are true defenders of a new decade
We're gonna fight for our children
And for the children to come
It's a true rebellion
One for all, all for one
I don't know
The story goes
Life is tough
When the odds are low
We'll justify our reasons
For seasons to change
Headlines
Of tomorrow
Headlines
We can follow
Headlines
That won't bring us down
Freedom was born from blood and fire
Somebody said, but I disagree
Some say no news is good news
But it's bad news to me
So tell me what are the chances
Who said a million to one
Gonna break defences
Carry on to prove them wrong
I don't know
The story goes
Life is tough
When the odds are low
We'll justify our reasons
For seasons to change
[Chorus]
We're drowning in a flood of fear
But somehow the wind kind of pushed us this way
And leaves it up to you and me
We need the understanding and sympathy
Who wants to be history
Who cares about..
[Chorus]
