There's something deep within I can't get rid of it
Something inside me causing horror in my head
I'm a stranger to myself
Don't know what I'm doing
Know what I'm doing
Tortured spirit haunting me
Playing with my sanity
Taking over steal my soul
I'm in a mental stranglehold
Don't want to share myself with you or someone else
What kind are you to split my mind and bend my will
Just get out of my life
Now why don't you leave me
why don't you free me
[Chorus]
And when my better part has gone
My alter ego still lives on
we're two persons in one
I can't break the bonds
Tortured spirit haunting me
Playing with my sanity
Taking over steal my soul
I'm in a mental stranglehold
Tortured spirit leave me be
Now tell me what you want from me
Taking over steal my soul
Tortured spirit don't do it oh no
