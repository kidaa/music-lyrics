Don't tell me when you walk away
Just close the door
And leave it all behind
Love's colder than a winter's day
I know the score
Guess you're the hurting kind
Can't you see you turn my life around
Why don't you set your loving free
Don't you know a heart is sacred ground
But love has got a hold on me
And so we had our ups and downs
Been 'round and 'round
Fuzzing and fighting
Thought I was gonna leave this town
This house of pain
In which I'm hiding
I've been down this road some times before
Guess I'm gonna go there again
And a time or two
I've faced the floor
But you've got my mind on the bend
Say the word I long to hear you say
Say the word I hunger for
There'll never be another one
Another one like you
Say the word I wanna hear you say
Say the word come talk to me
Now take me past the point of rescue
Cause love will rescue me
Rescue me
Now woman if you want me to
I'd run to you
To be forgiven
And if I could come across to you
I'd finally have found
My piece of heaven
I would have the will to carry on
I would be determined to be strong
Chorus
Can't you see you turn my life around
Why don't you set your loving free
Don't you know a heart
Is sacred ground
But love has got a hold on me
This could be love
If you could give in to me
We could be good together
Ride the storm
Make our hearts
Beat as one
Chorus
