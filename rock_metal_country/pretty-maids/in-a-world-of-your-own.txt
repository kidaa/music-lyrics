Let your love rain down on me
Be my poet and my preacher
And give me reason to believe
That you'll be there
If I should need you
Here you whisper in the summer wind
I still see you shine in the horizon
Now come to me as my long lost friend
I'll never let you down
[Chorus:]
But you're living in a world of your own
Where innocence glows
So far from this heart of mine
I would travel destinations unknown
To see if you still remember
The promises we once mad
I took the apple form the tree
I was a child for your temptation
Guess I was always meant to be
Heading our for your direction
Like a gypsy or a refugee
I'm rambling around in blind confusion
But nothing ever seems to come
Down my street
I'm just a heartbroken man
[Chorus]
When the fire goes dead
And my world is apart
Will you forgive and forget
Be the light in the dark
Wont you wet my lips
When the bottle runs dry
Tell me is the truth
Just another lie
Like the river untamed
Like a mother and child
Like the wind and the rain
The earth and the sky
Let the colours of love
Float into one
We'll be one
We could be one
[Chorus]
