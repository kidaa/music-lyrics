Hey you could be mine
Does it hurt baby
Lay it on the line
Jealousy burns yeah
Don't hide your fascination
If won't change the way you feel
[Chorus]
Come on tough, come on nasty
Come on babe it's a free ride
Say you will come on catch me
Come on babe we got all night
You know what I want
What I need so make it bleed
Fire all your guns
Shoot at me
Cut my heart out
Make me scream and shout
Leave you in a trail of passion
I got my wicked ways
[Chorus]
Love can be so vain
And baby lock your heart in chains
But in this naughty little game
and love enslaves you
Love will find a way
Love strikes you
Delights you
Excites you so
Come on tough...
