Dreams of a lifetime
Thrills from long ago
These years of joy now have flown
Silhouettes in a mirror
I'll recognise her face
Ten thousand years out in space
She
She meant everything to me
Scarlet woman with eyes of gold
She's out on the edge of my dream
Venus arising
Planet caravans
Create a cosmic romance
Like a touch of her spirit
Voices from the past
Just like a spell that's been cast
I've been walking through tears and pain
Every time I catch her breath
Oh, but I still do remain
In the eye of the storm
In the eye of the storm
Seasons are changing
Winter of my life
The memories still survive
And the dreams of my love
Are coming down like rain
Every time I call out her name
And she
She meant everything to me
Scarlet woman with eyes of gold
She
She's out on the edge of my dreams
In the eye of the storm
In the eye of the storm
Eye of the storm
I am no stranger
No stranger to love any more
I've tried it all
So many times before
And I've been going through changes
But I can't fight this feeling
And I'm still dreaming on
And on and on...
[Chorus]
