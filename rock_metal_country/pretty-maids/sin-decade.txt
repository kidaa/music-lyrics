We break on through
And step into a new decade
With no regrets for the mistakes
We've made
Prophets and preachers warning
There'll be hell to pay
What do we care anyway
Unfaithful children
Whose blood runs cold
All mighty kingdom
Immortal souls
[Chorus]
Figure it out
We're guilty of the crimes that we create
Figure it out
We rush into another sin-decade
The millions living on
The seven deadly sins
Thinking salvation
Must be close at hand
Godforsaken fools
Born to break the rules
Our fate is written in the sand
Unfaithful children.........
[Chorus]
Face Armageddon
You're trapped in the hands of time
Pray for confession
Accused of the fatal crime
[Chorus]
