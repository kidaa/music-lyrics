Wear me out
Stone me in the street
You can tear me down
But you cannot erase my memory
Preach to me
I don't take advice
I don't compromise
I gotta look the devil in the eyes
I know that you'll never see things the way I do
But only fools follow rules
Back off
Do you hear what I say
Back off
Get out of my way
Hang me up
Say I don't belong
Pull the plug
Spit on me but I'll still come on strong
Stab my back
But don't step on my pride
Hit me from behind
In the end the vengeance is mine
And no one really wants you when you don't fit in
For some the streets will never bend
[Chorus]
And if you cross my path
I'll take you off the map and
Terrorize you
Neutralize you
Pulverize you
Hurt you bad
I'll fight with all I got though
Iom right against the odds so
Here am I
All defiant
Out of time
Kicked out of the world
You can't systematize me
I ride against the flow
Your norms don't satisfy me
I want you to know
[Chorus]
