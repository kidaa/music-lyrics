People always blame us for the things we like to do
Ever since we jumped this wild and wacko roundabout
Supersonic youth a restless breed that remains
Our generation's outcast, and we love it loud
If you wanna break up
If you got your mind made up
Cast away your foolish pride
Ready for take off
We're gonna shake it up
You let it rock, we'll let you ride
Rock the house
Push it to the limit
Rock the house
Tonight we're gonna loose control
I don't need no crack to keep my feed above the ground
'Cause I'm all fired up with an electric overdose
I want to hear the sound of screaming guitars
And the pounding beat of drums that goes from head to toe
If you wanna break up
If you got your mind made up
Cast away your foolish pride
Ready for take off
We're gonna shake it up
You let it rock, we'll let you ride
Rock the house
Push it to the limit
Rock the house
Rock it till you loose control
You're gonna loose it
Rock is the drug
We've got enough to share
You want it. We got it
We've got the will to let it roll
[Chorus]
