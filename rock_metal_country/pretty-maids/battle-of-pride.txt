I see their missiles. east and west
and they're pointing straight at you
they are rearming to be the best
and there is nothing you can do
[Chorus:]
I see fire
I see war
and expire no more
I see the danger, hanging over you head
I see the bombs up in the clouds
a press on a button and you'll be dead
and there is no way out
[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Chorus]
In every nation, they are ready to fight
and ready to win
but all in all it's just a battle of pride
and this will be the end
[Chorus]
Look out
