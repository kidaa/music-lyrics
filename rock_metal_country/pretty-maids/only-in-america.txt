In the land of make believe
In America
Go chase you fortune
Suicide on prime tv
Mass hysteria
The U.S. wants you
Malcome X politics
Tricky Dick and dirty trick
Sugar Ray C.I.A. lost in Hollywood
Letterman Disneyland Luther King
And Ku klux clan
Watergate out in space
Armstrong on the moon
Ride on to life
It's what you make it
In Gods country
Eye for an eye
This is only in America
From the pils of dollar bills
To the poor ones in the ghetto nation
And the riches on the hill
Take advantage of illegal aliens
Iron Mike take a bite
Stern is on the air tonight
Al Capone rock'n'roll Elvis is alive
Kennedy for president
Shot in Dallas 1 PM
Liberty LSD
Lucy in the skies
[Chorus]
Sue you out for every course
Hypocrets and foreign wars
Brave new world
Brave new world
[Chorus]
