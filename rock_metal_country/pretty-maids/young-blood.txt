Daddy's girl, she works the night away
Through tears and pain, she makes it day by day
Once her heart was weak
It was aching for more
She was more than complete
Admired and adored
It wouldn't die out
The fire inside her
And still it burns
But the fire has gone
High born, rich man's girl
A white swan in her own little world
Always had more money than sense
She turns her back on those she depended on
It's just a little change of attitude
She never felt this way before
She doesn't know what she'll be going through
She wants more
Young blood
Your future is held
In the hands of a stranger
Young blood
Don't ever give your heart away
Night time, hanging around
Dealing with the wrong guys
On the wrong side of town
A good time on someone's backseat
You've got to get out, but you're dragging your feet
And now you're walking with a bad reputation
Hot gossip going with your name
Two different worlds are such a tough combination
Your heart is bleeding
And you're living in shame
Whatever happened to your dignity
Out where the days have no names
You're left alone with your philosophies
And your dreams
[Chorus]
Another lazy day
Another crazy night
Another lonely heart
Has broken up inside
Hanging on the edge
It ain't funny
But that's how it goes
When you trade love for money
Oh whatever happened to your dignity
Don't look away
[Chorus]
