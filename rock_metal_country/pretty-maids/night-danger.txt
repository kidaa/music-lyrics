Running through the darkness
like a fire in the night
looking for some action
don't know what's in sight
Racing with the devil
in the middle of the row
if you're gonna lose
the devil's gonna take you down there below
The darkness has the power, and it has come to rule
you better pray for your life
an evil circle, you better beware, you better take care
or you're gonna die
you better watch out and don't let it out
[Chorus:]
Night danger, I think it's time to turn
night danger, before you gonna turn
Fighting to survive
in the dark and empty cold
you better beware, your loosin' control
You can't stand the pressure
shock waves rollin' through your brain
your body starts to shiver, you're going insane
The darkness has the power, and it has come to rule
you better pray for your life
an evil circle, you better beware, you better take care
or you're gonna die
you better watch out and don't let it out
[Chorus]
[Solo]
The darkness has the power, and it has come to rule
you better pray for your life
an evil circle, you better beware, you better take care
or you're gonna die
you better watch out and don't let it out
