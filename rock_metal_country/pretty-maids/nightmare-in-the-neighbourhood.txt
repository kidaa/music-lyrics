A roaring silence fills the city
There's a sense of fear
Only the stars are God's eyes
And the moon glows so clear
When your bets are off
It's no pleasure cruise
It takes all your guts
To make it through
Oh yeah
Hear the cries of a woman
A broken-hearted angle
A shotgun rings out
Set fire to the sky
Lovers and gamblers
Trying to make a score
Lowlife adventures
Crash a liquor store
[Chorus]
Nightmare in the neighbourhood
Nasty little neighbours
Nightmare in the neighbourhood
Nightmare in the neighbourhood
Nasty little neighbours
Nightmare in the neighbourhood
In the hour of darkness
We're facing a moment of truth
The world shows its anger
Its pain and its lies
Snowbirds and crackers
Spaced out on dope
Dance on the edge
Of a six feet bungalow
[Chorus]
Trapped in this twisted place
No one will hear your prayers
it fills me with disgrace
Got to get
Got to get out of here
There's a rumour on Main Street
Some one shot the breeze
A young kid had an O.D.
In a shooting gallery
[Chorus]
I'm talking about neighbours
