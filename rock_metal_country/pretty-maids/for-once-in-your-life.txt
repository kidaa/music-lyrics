Hanging by the phone waiting impatiently
I'm in a minor key but still there's no reply
Sitting counting days going through endless nights
But baby still the light of your star fills my sky
Here we are facing trouble again
We've been down this road before
There ain't no point in this struggle my friend
Love will find away
For once in your life
Give in to surrender
Let the tears of your pride
Flow away in the rain
And start all over
All you left was just a bunch of photographs
The slices of the past and now we're worlds apart
But baby your picture makes no substitute
It can't replace the beauty the fire in your heart
And now we're stuck with all the hurting and lies
All the foolish things we say
Maybe we both could need a pair of new eyes
And see things the same now baby
[Chorus]
If love still stand a chance
Life still goes on
In the name of romance
You're still the one
Girl without your love I feel so out of place
A man without a face my heart has broke in two
I'm feeling blue
So girl you've got to give me all your tenderness
You know that one sweet kiss will make my dreams come true
I'm beggin for you
Why don't we break the chain of pain and reach out
For the healing hands of love
And rediscover what it's all about
And let love begin now baby
[Chorus]
Lets start all over
All over again
