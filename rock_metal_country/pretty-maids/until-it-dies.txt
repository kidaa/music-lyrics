Since it began
Since the dawning of days
It's been rearing it's head
Along the way
Ever since man
Crawled out of the sea
We've been pledging our souls
To purgatory
Now ever since we kissed the serpents tongue
Betrayed by lust we await it's coming
Caged in fright of the chosen one
And there ain't no hope until it dies
Into of oblivion
enter the devils womb
unholy origin
come days of doom
no mercy it's breeding fear
our final hour is here
life as we know it has gone forever more
storms are growing
heaven awaits the pure
kneel to pray
this holocaust
we're helpless
defenceless
Death and disorder
plagues and torture
living the undivine
nothing is sacred
terminal hatred
covered in sin
evil intention
holy dimension
purity for the swine
but there ain't no cure
we're in decline
We're stillborn
We're dead meat
We're no one
Until it dies
We're stillborn
We're bad breed
We're no one
Until it dies
Heaven is burning
The sky is fiery red
Souls are yearning
Uprising among the dead
We're faithless
And abandoned
Forsaken generation
Rage and agony
Pain and tragedy
Now insanity reigns
Screaming in anguish
Towering madness
Not of this earth
Death of innocence
Pay your penance
and greet the devil in shame
and there ain't no hope until it dies
[Chorus]
And as I fear this ancient myth
My only comfort is my death
The cross of sin is hard to bare
One day the devil take his share
