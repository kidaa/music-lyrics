Do you know what's up in the sky
a danger to the human race
there should have been a paradise
instead there's a killer out in space
It's made by the human, a dangerous toy
an ironbound demon, built to destroy
It's staring at you day and night
it's hidden but you know it's there
a killer, a nuclear satellite
that can hit you everywhere
It's made by the human, a dangerous toy
an ironbound demon, built to destroy
[Chorus:]
Cold killer, cold killer
cold killer, icecold killer
And it can destroy all life on earth
a menace to peace in our time
a master of the universe
which took all these hopes of mine
It's made by the human, a dangerous toy
an ironbound demon, built to destroy
[Chorus]
Up in the sky you'll see
stars shining bright and free
but don't, don't get fooled by their light
cause maybe there's a killer inside
[Solo]
It's made by the human, a dangerous toy
an ironbound demon, built to destroy
[Chorus]
