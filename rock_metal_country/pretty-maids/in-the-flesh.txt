Me and the boys are bound for trouble
Cruising the city round the midnight hour
Just went out to get a couple
Of whisky shots to light my fire-power
Every now and then
We got a little to go
Every now and then
We got some money to burn
Every now and then
We're getting ready for love
[Chorus]
In the flesh
Here we are and we're for real
Flesh
Come on baby touch and feel
In the flesh
Hearts and engines in the night
In the flesh
Rebels in a sea of light
See we ain't no Valentinos
You see we ain't no blue-eyed Romeos
Hello you sexy ballerina
Little Miss Roundheels, we want you so
Every now and then...
[Chorus]
And we don't need no doctor's orders
Love is like heroin there's much in store
Don't even lock up your daughters
We'll smash the windows and kick the doors
Every now and then...
[Chorus]
