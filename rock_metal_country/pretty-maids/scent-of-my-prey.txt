Walking in a trance tonight
Round the city streets
Looking for some pure delight
To fullfit my needs
My sanity is spilt in two
I'm burning with desire
Girl I got my eyes on you
You're fuel to my fire
Creepin' in on you
You'll never see me coming
Nothing you can do oh no
No one's got a clue
There ain't no point in running
Now can you feel me honey
I can smell you
The scent of my prey
Raised to be a monster
A pervert lunatic
In a psychotic hunger
I twist my strangle grip
Look into my eyes
And tell my what you see
Are you terrified baby
I'll be satisfied
Now you're in my posession
I'll realized my mission
I can smell you
The scent of my prey
Now my head is filled with emptyness
And I don't really recognize myself
Is it true what the paper says
Could it have been me
Little girl don't you sense the danger
Little girl never trust a stranger
Don't take the candy from his hand
And don't you play his game
He'll steal your life away
Baby step inside
I'll take you for a ride
No one hears you cry
No mercy
My kind of pleasure is the key to your pain
[Chorus]
