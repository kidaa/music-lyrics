We seek immortallity
The wish to control
In the face of tecnology
We reach for our goals
We deny the laws of nature
Breaking the genetic rules
Playing god
Playing with fire
Playing god
The quest and desire
Determind to evade our destiny
We're chasing the code of life
We got to explore
In building the perfect tribe
To open new doors
There's no limit to our venture
No cure for our curiosity
[Chorus]
The lust for knowledge like a
Modern day frankenstein
Genious or madness
Where do we draw
The line
Science dreams
We're going off the rails
We hold the future
Of mankind we can't
Afford to fail
[Chorus]
