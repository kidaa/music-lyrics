Jeannie, Jeannie she's running on a thin line
While Danny's looking for an alibi
Little sinners living on the wild side
Face to face
Out of place
Out of time
Out in the streets
With a thousand faces
Where lovers meet
In pleasure and pain
Out of innocence
Two souls crying out
So desperately
In ecstasy
She is the animal
The way she looks at you
She's creeping in on you
He's just a criminal
Ready to strike
How to survive
Can't draw the line
The line between what's wrong or right
Live or die
Partners in crime
And their bridge is burning
A smoky room
In a sleazy hotel
As a man walk out
Another walks in
Law of the jungle
Is no finance, no romance
She can't live without
And she can't live within
She is the animal
The way she looks at you
She's creeping in on you
He's just a criminal
Ready to strike
[Chorus]
So many promises that we've been told
So many things we take for granted
Whenever you find your dreams along these roads
You're out on your own
Don't loose control
Never give it up, don't give it up
Sometimes life is a little bit tough on you
Ain't that the truth Jeannie
She is the animal
The way she looks at you
She's creeping in on you
He's just a criminal
Drifting around like a thief in the night
[Chorus]
