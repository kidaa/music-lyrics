Following my intuition
Guided by my inner vision
Life's to short for intermissions here
Live it to the full extension
Crash into a new dimension
Burning out with no exeption, yeah
There ain't no other life no second chance
I don't believe in miracles
There ain't no mountain high no fellow man
To stop me from this course I've planned
Carpe diem got to cease the day
Live here and now like tomorrow's too late
Carpe diem there's no time to waste
Life is for living no reason to wait
Shinning like a nuclear sun
Shooting like a laser bomb
I just want my share of fun for sure
I feel like flying without feathers
Diving into never never
I wish I could live forevermore
I got to eat up every moment
Won't let a second slip away
Ain't gonna back down I'll be rolling on
Every minute of the day
Just like a highway
Don't know where it ends
Don't know where I'm going
Or where it will lead me
Life still excites me
On dreams I dependbr
My future is glowing
A magical feeling
