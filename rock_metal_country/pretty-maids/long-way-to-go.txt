I met a girl
Who really shook my foundation
You know, that chick
Is really driving me mad
But she lives that life
That she loves to live
Yes she does
She's out on the street
In leather and lace
She's all that I need
I'm in for the chase
And then she turns her back on me
It's like her body's been chained
To my eyes
I'm living in a fantasy
And though you know
That your heart never lies
You know it's sauch a long way to go
It's a long way to go
Such a long way to go
It's a long way to go
Such a long way to go
She knows exactly how to draw
My attention
You know that feeling
Running down your spine
She's dragging my heart around and around
Round and round
She's the one
I'm dreaming of
And now I become
A prisoner of love
I'll catch her smile
While going down
Going down
[Chorus]
Getting closer
Won't be long
She's so hot
I just can't get her out of my head
[Chorus]
