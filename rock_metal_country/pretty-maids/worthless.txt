just another piece of trash in the public eye
Another day of bitterness in the
unemployment lines
The way that people look at you like your not
Even there
You're less than zero and who the hell cares
Cause you're Worthless
Out in the cold
Taintet heart
Tortured soul
Some would rather see you dead no one
Takes your side
And everyday you die a bit just to stay alive
A face without a name
A heart without a home
Your next to nothing
On your own
Worthless
Out in the cold
Taintet heart
Tortured soul
Worthless
No second chance
No way out
Of your no man land
Cause nothing ever seems to come your way
There's only dead horizons
There's only fractured dreams and you can't
Save yourself
from the demons that you're fighting
Yet another casualty
Teated like a dog
There's no mental sanctuary
Drowning in the flood
Mr worthless
Your living a lie
Your future is dead
And your past won't die
And if the sun would ever shine a little light
Upon you
Would you feel love
Would you live on and nevermind the pain
Inside that haunts you
Would it be enough
No faith in life
Hope in sight
Stranded
Abandoned
