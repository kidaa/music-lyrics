I've heard it called by different names
All over the world but it's all the same
There's so many ways to make love
A million ways I've been thinking of
Oh yeah
But there's only one way
There's only one way to rock
So many things can get you high
I'm gonna try them all just once before I die
And you can analyzed the situation
To me it's all just mental masturbation
[Chorus]
Now quickly chack the hands
On the clock it's 8.05 it's time to rock
And this world can disagree
They don't understand how it can be
And it's not my point of veiw
It's a fact and you know that it's true
[Chorus]
