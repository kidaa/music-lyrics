If never I met you
I'd never have seen you cry
if not for a first hello
we'd never have
to say goodbye
If never I held you
my feelings would never show
its time I start walking
but there's so much you'll
never know
I keep telling you hard luck woman
you ain't a hard luck woman
Rags the sailor's only daughter
a child of the water
too proud to be a queen
Rags I really love you I can't
forget about you
you'll be a hard luck woman
baby till you find your man
Before I go let me kiss you
and wipe the tears from your eyes
I don't wanna hurt you girl
you know I could never lie
[Chorus]
don't cry
I'll be packin' my bags
leaving you
Don't cry
I gotta keep on moving
leaving you
