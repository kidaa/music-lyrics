You want me a simple man
To lead you on to the Promised Land
So unreal don't you see
Behind the mask
There's a devil in me
I'm rolling thunder
I'm sun I'm shine
Slowly slipping under
I'm more than meets the eye
[Chorus:]
I love I hate
I swear I lie
I'm just like any other guy
I'm right I'm wrong
A prodigal son
Set souls on fire
I'm no messiah
And you won't like
What you'll find
Sometimes I've got a sick mind of mind
In these arms
You'll be sad
Cause I feel good when you're feeling bad
You see I'm complicated
Not just black and white
I'm devastated
You see I'm Jeckyll and Hyde
[Chorus]
If you step into my world my friend
You'll find another part of me
Gotta sin to be saved
On the other side of life you'll se
[Chorus]
I win I loose
The naked truth
So hard to face
When you can't choose
I've never worn
A crown of thorns
I'm no messiah
