You were raised up from the steam in the city
Where your daddy dragged you 'round from place to place
Now you're a grown-up, a cool guy looking pretty
But the childhood had its mark upon your face
Now you're the hungry one, you want it all
And enough is not enough, you're always coming back for more
When the race is on you roll the ball
You found your heaven behind the backstage door
You're all fed up
With their parental domination
Don't let them wear away your pride
Cut the wire
Jump the gun
There is nothing that's holding you back
Cross the fire
Hit 'n' run
You're forever unchained
Jump the gun
In another town, on another stage
You've been cruising around, for at least a human age
That rock'n'roll was your key to succeed
Your restless soul
Has taken off from the street
So if you like it now
You'll learn to love it later
Stick to your dreams, and go ahead
[Chorus]
And now you're up to front
A youth of desperation
Go out and penetrate their minds
You preach the words
They put them out in circulation
Get out, seek and find
[Chorus]
