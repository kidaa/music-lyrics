I feel like stranded alone
On a desert island
Down and out wounded
In this heart of mine
Your final words still echoes inside
I pick up your letter
See trails of your poisoned pen
But it only reminds me
Of the bitter end
Recall your face and your accusing eyes
And I don't know
How to face a new tomorrow
Now that yesterday seems so faraway
[Chorus:]
Anytime and anywhere
You call me up I'll be right there
To hold your close to keep you safe and warm
And if you find you need someone
To give you strength to carry on
I'll cover you and rest you in my arms
From now until the end of time
You were my precious stone
My pride and joy
But I was nothing but a trouble boy
Who had it all
Then threw it all away
Now good intentions are not enough
But you can count me in
When times get tough
I'll fight for you
Stand up for you
And I'd die for you
Now it seems a long, long time
Since I held you near me
And I feel my heart
Is tangled up in chains
[Chorus]
I never meant to hurt you
I never wanted it to be this way
God I wish you would have stayed
[Chorus]
But I still love you
I'm thinkin' of you
Girl I need you so
And I know
That you're somewhere out there
Girl I need your love
I still need your love
