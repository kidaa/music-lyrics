Something about her
I can't figure out
But there's something that doesn't seems right
something behind that peculiar smile
emotionally crippled inside
The invisible chains that eternally binds you
the strength of your pain will remain to remind you
Once you get burned you get marked for the rest of your life
She's living in shame
she's distressed from the stains
suffer the scars of her youth
if only she could
renounce to her childhood
and run away from the truth
But nobody take a notice
and nobody ever did
[Chorus]
Hurt and absent
And a life in contempt
never no question was asked
now there ain't no hide out
she can't conceal herself
facing the ghost of the past
It's a no one situation
and nobody wants to know
[Chorus]
She believed in love
And now she lives in the non - existence
Like a wounded bird
She's trying to get of
To spread her wings and fly
Fly away
[Chorus]
