Someone dies and as we close our eyes
Another hungry child will starve away
Say a prayer, we've got to be aware
If we're the ones to face another day
When my pleasure turns to pain
When I'm scared
I'm caught in a lifetime
Since the world has gone insane
Try to hold on
Open your eyes
Pay attention
The end is not that far away
Attention
We're heading towards judgement day
Run run away
Identify yourself, dehumanised
Too much computerized
Man of tomorrow
We can't avoid
A worldwide suicide
If we don't
Hold back the fire that's coming on
When my pleasure turns to pain
When I'm scared
I'm caught in a lifetime
Since the world has gone insane
Try to hold on
Open your eyes
[Chorus]
I've seen the new horizons
There is no true escape
There ain't no compromising
Can't pull the breaks
And so we're living in the shadows
Of supernational fools
Who reign and rule
Control our destiny
This is an emergency
It's not the way it's meant to be
[Chorus]
