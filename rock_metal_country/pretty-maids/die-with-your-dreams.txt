Once a child of illusions
once a king but you've lost your
drown
where the walls came tumbling down
now you walk in the shadows
down the boulevard of broken
dreams
losing track floating with the
stream
I know the feeling
your feeling like a stranger in a
strange land
Cause you dno't see there's love
can't feel it enough
your heart is your prison
when there's no light to be seen
that when you die with your
dreams
and loose your religion
You're been looking for an answer
you've been searching for the key
to life
you've been crying in the dead of
night
see you drown is the darkness
in the world so freezin' cold
its like a nail bammered through
your soul
Sometimes it seems
that you're been born under a bad
sign
[Chorus]
Down in the dust
where there's no one to trust
when there's nothing to hold on to
store yourself blind
in the mirrors of time
for the great divine
You can't choose can't break the
chains
there's nothing to lose
and nothing to gain
it's your life your fate has been
sealed
you're alone with your lack of
brief
[Chorus]
