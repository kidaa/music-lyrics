Little darling gonna be a rock and roll star
Little darling gonna play electic guitar
Little darling would like to know you
Pleased to meet you, how do you do
Little darling, little darling, little darling
little darling, little darling gonna love you to night
Little darling gonna shake, shake boogaloo
Little darling can I rattle my bones and dance with you
and later on there'll be some lovin', dovin'
a little kissing, at little hugging, a little holding you
Little darling, little darling, little darling
little darling, little darling gonna love you to night

Little darling I'm gonna miss kissing you
little darling I'm gonna miss missing you
Little darling, little darling, little darling
little darling, little darling, little darling
little darling, little darling gonna love you to night
