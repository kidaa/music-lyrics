So many things I'd like to do
So many dreams yet to come true
So many wasted hours on my tail
So many broken promises
So many lies and sweet regrets
precious moments that went down the drain
but there's no time to loose
no need for bad excuses now
the clock is ticking
all those days are flicking by somehow
and I'm still stranded
but time awaits for no one
time just keeps on going
time awaits for no one
time just keeps on rolling by
so many people that I've hurted
so many visions I've deserted
all those stupid things I've said and done
and so much love I did not give
so much life I never lived
and one to many yesterdays have gone
I can't reset to zero
Can't rewind as years go by
I can't defect from
All the bad reflectionsof my life
So here I'm standing
[CHORUS]
Can't beat the clock
Race against time
It goes on eternally
It never stops
Runs out of line
Oh no
[CHORUS]
