I'm hooked on you; you've got hooks in me
My shooting star my satisfaction guarantee
You've got me blinded
Those bedroom eyes
I shiver and I shake
I'm feeling hypnotized
Mine all mine
Secret love
Mine all mine
Mine all mine
Guardian angel
Mine all mine
[Chorus]
You've got that healing touch
Magic charm
Baby blow me down
Healing touch
Magic charm
Spin my heart around
Love's squeezing tight
Human desire
Sweet tongues of fire
The way you wet your lips oh
The way you shake your hips
Baby babe I like your dirty tricks
So come on
Mine all mine
[Chorus]
Some say you're obscene
Got a nasty reputation
But I'm hungry for you
Don't give a damn
About their stupid conversations
'Cause I do what I do
Got to do it
Mine all mine...
[Chorus]
