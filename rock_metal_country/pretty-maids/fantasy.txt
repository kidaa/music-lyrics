I see the stars are falling down from the sky
in the summerheat
but I don't know the reason why
maybe that's conceit
but I can hear the flowers grow
in the pouring rain
don't ask me why 'cause I don't know
am I going insane

Is this a dream or reality
I don't know what is going on now
is this a nightmare please tell me
where do I belong

Chorus:
Just a fantasy
Just a fantasy
Just a fantasy
Just a fantasy

Now I feel like a burning fire
growing stronger and stronger
telling people their desire
but they ain't got none any longer
I feel like sitting on a purple sky
riding on the wind
flying low and flying high
again and again

Is this a dream or reality
I don't know what is going on now
Is this a nightmare please please tell me
where do I belong
