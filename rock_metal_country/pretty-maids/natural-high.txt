You know this feeling
You've met a girl
you think you're dreamin'
You're on top of the world
It's like a full deck
And another trick of your sleeve
Love can derange you
It's plain to see
How it can change your
Personality
You loose your senses
Your breath and the power of speech
Love makes you strong
Love makes you blind
Love is the key
To make a grown man cry
Love is a healer
Love is a natual high
That's right
Love is magnetic
A sparkling glare
You feel pathetic
When it's not there
That's when you're feling blue
That's when you realize
It's comprehensive
It takes centrol
Makes you dependent
And stirs the soul
You can walk on water
You can ride the skies
[Chorus]
Love is a miracle
Love is alive
Natural high
[Chorus]
