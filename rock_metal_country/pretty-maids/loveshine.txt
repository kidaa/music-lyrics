My baby she's a sexual intellectual
Something special and she's mine
Invaluable unusual amusing
and she's cruzial to my life
She picked me up
Just like an angel out of nowhere
One little miracle
An answer to my prayers
Love shine on me
Lift me up take my heart in your hands
Love shine on me
Never stop cause you're the only one
My rising sun of love
Shine on me
I find her irresistable so magical
So mystical but she's physical
She is
She leaves me in a state of grace
The sparkle on my rainy days
She's my bliss
She takes me unerneath her wings
when I feel blue
My sweet soulsister
Now my heart belongs to you
[Chorus]
When I feel lonely like a sailor lost at sea
She makes me realize what love can be
She's so good to me
Loveshine
[Chorus]
