I wanna taste it
feel it in my bones
gonna reach for the sky
I got wings I can fly on my own
I'll go the distance
you'll never see me crawl
cause I'm over the hill
and I'm in for the thrill of it all
And you know
easy come and easy go
I can feel the fire glow
in my body and soul
Live until it hurts
wanna feel it
fight for all it's worth
take on the world because it's mine
all mine
I ain't gonna sit and waste my time
live until it hurts
spread my wings and
fly like a bird
it's better to burn out than to fade
away
stand up till my dying day
I'm gonna live it up
take it as it comes
have a piece
of the pie
feel like a wild
on the run
I'm gonna walk on
never gonna rest
I'll go for the lot
and you know
I'll stand up to the test
Wanna win gonna put the
wheels in spin
and enjoy the state I'm in
feel the magic
raise some hell
[Chorus]
I'm running with the devil
I'll be kicking up some dust
push it to the limit
cause my motive is my lust
I'm lit up like a rocket
ready for take off tonight
Nothing's gonna stand
in my way
I'll come on strong and live
for today
cause nobody knows what
tomorrow will show
got a hold on life and I can't
let go
[Chorus]
