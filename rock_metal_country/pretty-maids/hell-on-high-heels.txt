I met this girl
she stole my heart
she rocked my world
right from the start
one single look
an instant attraction
and I was hooked for more
But I know
you're foolin around girl
and I know she's pulling tricks on me
but she glows there's something about her
and I am lost in her mystery
But she's hell on high heels
once you're stuck inside her web
she leaves you in a trail of passion
she's drug you just can't quit
and your mind is in a haze
One little touch
one single kiss
a little lust
I can't resist
you know I'm trapped
and once I'm invited
no turning back oh no
Maybe she in just a one night sensation
maybe I'm just a toy for amusement
but it seems like an infatuation
she's a match to my fuse
[Chorus]
She'll eat my heart out
my mean teen queen
lovemashine
heartbreaking soulshakin girl
Uh ske plays a dirty game
I might be lucky and roll a six an the dice
I need her love tonight
need her love
[Chorus]
