Life is running slowly through our hands
Fade away like footsteps in the sand
Passing by us
And all our visions want astray
We're living with the scars of yesterday
To remind us
We look the other way
We're blind to what surrounds us
And no one seems to care
We dream of better days
Cause everyone's got their own cross to bear
Ain't it so
With theese eyes I have seen
Vasted laves and broken dreams
with this heart I have felt
How we seem to please ourselves
We need new dreams tonight
Like the stars nedd the sky
We need love and sympathy
I need you and you need me
Look upon the homeless in the street
See the pain to those in need
All those empty faces
Think about the selfish way we live
How we take and never give
Somehow some things never change
The man behind the fence
He's got nothing left to live for
The wheels are standing still
And the beggar on the bench
Is lost for hope and he knows
It's the loneliness that kills
[Chorus]
Somebody take me and show me the way
To the end of the world where paradise begins
With theese eyes
With this heart
I have seen many lives torn apart
[Chorus]
