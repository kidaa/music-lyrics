Don't ever think you have paid
for the last love by Shelly the Maid
she'll give you all her loving aid
when you need a warm bed - Shelly the Maid

Chorus:
Shelly with her belly filled with joy
she knows how to treat her boy
she'll give you anything right
she won't leave you in the night
'cause she knows when there's money in sight

You'll never see her pale
she'll wear purple red on her toe nail
you don't ever have to be afraid
who'll never let you down - Shelly the Maid
