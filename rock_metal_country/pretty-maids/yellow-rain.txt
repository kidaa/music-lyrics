Tears in his eyes
The fear, oh it never dies
The echoes of the past
Are rolling on and on
For those who were left back
Tomorrow never comes
Oh, it never comes
And after all these years
Something still remains
The forever repercussions
The eternal pain
Another sleepless night
And another break of day
It doesn't matter anymore
His life will fade away
In yellow rain
They crossed the water
Back in '69
They fought for glory
Behind the enemy lines
Fighting for the nations
Pushed into the war
Without not even knowing why
Or what they're fighting for
Oh, oh
Out on the plains
Some are the masters
Some are the slaves
Oh, oh
War is a never-ending mission
You're just a pawn in a game
Where the number is your name
Left home as heroes
Fools when they returned
Blamed for all the damage
And the villages they burned
Betrayed by their leaders
Murderers they were called
Denounced as crazy maniacs
And locked behind the walls
Oh, oh
Out on the plains
Some are the masters
Some are the slaves
Oh, oh
War is a never-ending mission
They are the victims
Doomed to die
In yellow rain
We've seen them dying in the fields
In yellow rain
Just like a knight
Who's in a fight, without a shield
Oh no
Try to forget, but it just won't go
Oh no
Forever in their memories
Oh no
Hell's just some thousand miles away
Oh no no
Oh, oh
Out on the plains
Some are the masters
Some are the slaves
Oh, oh
War is a never-ending mission
They are the victims
Doomed to die
[Chorus]
