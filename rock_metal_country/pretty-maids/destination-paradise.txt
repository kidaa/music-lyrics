Take a little trip with me
Let your spirit wander free
I'll free you from reality
I can take you there
Let me be your Peter Pan
Take you off to neverland
Make you feel like Superman
Make you feel aware
Ignite you exite you
The sails are set for
Destination Paradise kiss the sky
Flying high tonight
On the wings of a dream
Sail away leave today
In a sea of light
And flow with the stream
Once we've made friends
Don't pretend that we won't meet again
I will be tied to your tracks
I can change your attitude
Sweeten up the bitter fruit
Let me put a spell on you
For a little while
You'll be safe in my control
I got you in a stranglehold
I'll free your mind and steal your soul
I can make you smile
Release me and feel me - Let me seduce you
Destination Paradise kiss the sky
Flying high tonight
On the wings of a dream
Sail away leave today
In a sea of light
And flow with the stream
If you want more
I'll be there at the end of the straw
I'm your drug I'm a rock
Cut me up make me in - Take me
Now they say you're sugar free
Won't you drop a line for me
And how is your morality
Now that you've come clean
Do you still have confidence
Can you face the consequence
Don't you see it never ends
It's still the same old scene
I beg you won't let you go
[Chorus]
