Don't try to talk to your mother
she won't understand
she says you're crazy, boy you're runnig wild
don't try to talk to your father
he won't give a damn
saying you're lazy and a problem child
You've got to be strong
if you will survive, stay alive
Well they can kick they can beat
knock us down to the ground
but we will rise and we will march again
cause we are the heat, we are the sound
of rolling thunder in the yeah
And so we are here
and we won't give up, we won't stop
[Chorus:]
Red hot and heavy - the way it's gonna be
Red hot and heavy - now don't you see
Red hot and heavy - we're bringin' you down
so touch the ground
You know the big revolution
it's gonna be so
out in the streets we're gonna shout it out
you know the final solution
it's rock'n roll
that's what we need and we will keep it loud
And so we are here
for a night on town
rock this city down
[Chorus]
[Solo]
