Cover me
Protect me from myself
From my private hell
From depravation
The mirror speaks
But the reflections lie
I see a different I
My condemnation
Oh here it comes again
I'm not what you think I am
I'm mentally subsidin'
I'm loosing it I'm sidin'
I'm not what you think I am
My common sense is broken
Slowly decomposing
Save me from
The suicial threat
The gun against my head
The voices calling me
What am I gonna do to stop myself
From sinking
How am I gonna chase away the
thougts I'm thinking
How am I gonna stop my
Deathwatch ticking
Someone kill the pain
Take it away
[Chorus]
The fragments of my sanity
Is all that is left of me
I'm falling of the track
Over and over again
[Chorus]
