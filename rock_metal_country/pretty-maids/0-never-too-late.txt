No cure for the broken hearted
no hope for the lonely one
now baby ever since we parted
I played a game that
can't be won
But I still believe in love
cause I know it does exits
have you ever tried to need
someone
have you ever tried to feel
a love like this
I know I had my misdemeanours
here I am to count the cost
you say there's a world between us
that I'm one that you just can't
trust
me make it up to you
just gimme one more try
cause I'm drowing in this
lonelines
and my spirit slowly dies
If it can't be love
if you won't let me into heaven
again
girl I want you to
stay by my side
what does it take to be forgiven
my friend
where did I go wrong
I gave too little
and expected too much
I wanna die in your arms
I can't get by without the feel of
your touch
One million little love affairs
babe
still the thorn stuck in your side
I promise you I really swear girl
that part of me is a part of my
life
Can I ever break the walls
the fortress around your heart
cause there's no meaning to it all
when love is torn apart
[Chorus]
And every poisoned word that
has been said the reason to
regret
love is stronger than death
Let's talk it over let the good
times begin let's just get closer
baby
skin on skin till the end
[Chorus]
