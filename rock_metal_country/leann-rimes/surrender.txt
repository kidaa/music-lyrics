There is a white flag rising,
About to catch the wind
And I don't wanna fight it,
Or let you win
Here I stand,
Heart in hand
No it ain't like me,
Don't take it lightly
You know I never Bend
[CHORUS]
Surrender
I'm giving in, givin' up
Surrender
Crossing over the line for your love
If I trust enough,
Then I might just
Fall in to forever
And all I've got to do Is Surrender
I see a white dove flyin,
The clouds have rolled on past
And isn't it surprising,
I feel the peace at last
Got all I need,
Surroundin' me
I'm not afraid to stand up and say,
I will never leave
[CHORUS]
Surrender
I'm giving in, givin' up
Surrender
Crossing over the line for your love
If I trust enough,
Then I might just
Fall in to forever
And all I've got to do is surrender
[CHORUS]
If I trust enough,
Then I might just
Fall into forever
And all I've got to do,
All I've got to do
Baby, All I've got to do,
Is Surrender
Oh Surrender
