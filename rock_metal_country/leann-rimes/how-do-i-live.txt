How do I get through the night without you
If I had to live without you
What kind of life would that be
Oh I need you in my arms need you to hold
You are my world my heart my soul

If you ever leave baby you would take away
Everything good in my life
And tell me now

How do I live without you
I want to know
How do I breathe without you
If you ever go
How do I ever ever survive
How do I how do I oh how do I live

Without you
There would be no sun in my sky
There would be no love in my live
There would be no wonder for me

And I baby I don't know what I would do
I've be lost if I lost you

If you ever leave baby you would take away
Everything real in my life and tell me now

How do I live without you
I want to know
How do I breathe without you
If you ever go
How do I ever ever survive
How do I how do I oh how do I live

Please tell me baby how do I go on

If you ever leave
Baby you would take away everything need you with me
Baby don't you know that you are
Everything good in my life

And tell me now
How do I live without you
I want to know
How do I breathe without you if you ever go
How do I ever ever survive
How do I how do I oh how do I live

How do I live without you
How do I live without you baby
How do I live without you
