one, two, three, ...
You, you've made no mistake
You take everything I ever wanted   into account
When you walk into the room
You give me, reason
Talk in turn, never too late or too soon.

You are, poetry in motion
You inspire, power and devotion
You are, turning all the tide under me
You are, the potential in me

You are...

You are, the first one that I wish to tell 
Everything that matters
Matters because you reflect it back so well

You are, poetry in motion
You inspire, power and devotion
You are, turning all the tide underneath
You are, the potential in me

You are my strongest link
You are, everything I wanted to be, yeah

You are, poetry in motion 
You inspire, power and devotion
You are, turning all the tide underneath
Oh yeah. 

You are, poetry in motion
You inspire, power and devotion
You are, turning all the tide underneath
You are, you are, the potential in me

You are...

You are, you are, you are, you are, you are, you are, you are, you are

You inspire power and devotion
You are, sensual
You touch my hand... [fade out]
