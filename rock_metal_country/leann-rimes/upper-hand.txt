Honey on a teaspoon
Sugar in a bowl
An eager man's always an easy catch
Butter on the skillet
Whisky in a glass 
To start a flame you've got to light a match

Ooh you got what he wants 
You got what he wants
Ooh

Got to get a hold, got to get a hold get a hold of your man
Better get him while, better get him while better get him while you can
Good to be a lion, good to be a lion instead of a lamb
Use what you got take the upperhand

Always be a lady 
But tease him like a tramp
A temptation that's hard to resist
Treat him like a hero 
Let him long to be your slave
Take advantage of your God given gift

Ooh you know what he wants
You know what he wants
ooh

Got to get a hold, got to get a hold get a hold of your man
Better get him while, better get him while better get him while you can
Good to be a lion, good to be a lion instead of a lamb
Use what you got take the upperhand

Generations before will testify it's true
Girl your gonna see how much he really loves you

Got to get a hold, got to get a hold get a hold of your man
Better get him while, better get him while better get him while you can
Good to be a lion, good to be a lion instead of a lamb
Use what you got take the upperhand
