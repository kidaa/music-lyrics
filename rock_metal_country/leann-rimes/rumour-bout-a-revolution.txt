Everybody's talkin bout something
a lot of static and a lot of nothin
pollutin the air with who the hell cares kinda gossip
headlines to spare in our pockets in our pockets
it's a shame but we could all stop it
tell a neighbor tell a friend it ain't a 60's thing
we still need a little help

Rumor bout a revolution
spread a little soul solution
let it stir in the wind
come on let a chance begin
raise a hand not a fist
yeah ignorance ain't bliss if it leaves us in ruins
rumor bout a revolution

Ain't it easy passing judgement
just to entertain ourselves
I'm not here pointing fingers
been guilty myself
you see there's a bigger picture
with a million point of views
well love ain't a color
it's a damn strong mother
and it ain't gonna lie

Rumor bout a revolution
spread a little soul solution
let it stir in the wind
come on let a chance begin
raise a hand not a fist
yeah ignorance ain't bliss if it leaves us in ruins
rumor bout a revolution

Tell a neighbor tell a friend it ain't a 60's thing
we still need a little help

[Repeat Chorus]
