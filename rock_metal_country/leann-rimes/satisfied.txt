Tell me will I ever be the one
To take my hands off the wheel and let it slide
Seems like I've always been the one
That can't sit back and just enjoy the ride
Just enjoy the ride

Feels like I'm on a speed train blowin through the fast lane
And I gotta chase the high
I can't shake it
Need to break it

[Chorus]
Looking for light on rainy days
Needing so much so many ways
Constantly throwing myself in a bind
Oh, I got no time to hesitate
I want it now why should I wait
I've tried but I just can't be satisfied

If you give me everything I want
I still would try to take a little more of you
Feels like I'm on a countdown but I'm gonna burn out
If I don't change my point of view
What do I gotta do
I can't fake it
Need to break it

[Chorus]
Looking for light on rainy days
Needing so much so many ways
Constantly throwing myself in a bind
Oh, I got no time to hesitate
I want it now why should I wait
I've tried but I just can't be satisfied

What is it like on a peaceful day
Just to have stay and watch the world fade away
And what is it like to just slow down
Surrender to the sound of nothing else around

[Repeat Chorus]
