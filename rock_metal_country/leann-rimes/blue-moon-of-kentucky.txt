Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shinin'
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
I said blue moon of Kentucky keep on shinin'
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

[with music]

I said blue moon of Kentucky keep on shinin'
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
I said blue moon of Kentucky keep on shinin'
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

Well is was on one moonlit night
Stars shinin' bright
Whispered all night
Love said goodbye

I said blue moon of Kentucky keep on shinin'
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

[spoken]

Well is was on one lonely night
Stars shinin' bright
Whispered all night
Love said goodbye

I said blue moon of Kentucky
Keep on shinin'
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
