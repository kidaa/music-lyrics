Give me a moment here
Just enough to catch my breath
something is happing here
and it's scaring me to death
you push me to the edge where I want to risk it all again
for the first time in a long time I'm throwing caution to the wind

You can break me down if you want to break me down
doesn't really matter how this crazy thing turns out
cause you take me there
where I lose myself
just for a moment if nothing else
You can break me down if you want to break me down

Yeah it's the strangest thing but it all makes perfect sense
funny how life falls in place when you dare to take a chance
you push me to the edge where I want to risk it all again
so take me where you want to I am willing to give in

You can break me down if you want to break me down
doesn't really matter how this crazy thing turns out
cause you take me there
where I lose myself
just for a moment if nothing else
You can break me down if you want to break me down

You push me to the edge where I want to risk it all again
so take me where you want to I am willing to give in
