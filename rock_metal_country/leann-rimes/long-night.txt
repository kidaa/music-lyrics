Feel the underground breeze as the trains go by
pushing through the crowd to see the sky around you
I blink as the green lights turn to red
every body on the street trying to get ahead surrounded
and when I lose myself in this raging sea
your a beacon of light your the air I breathe

Oh long night
I want you all to myself from now 'til the morning light
maybe we could make a
great escape
run away like thieves and we'll lock the world away
somewhere no one will ever find us on this long night
long night

I got a long ride home to think about things
and the song that the man on the radio sings
is so true, reminds me of you
the way that you know just who I am
when I don't say a word you still understand
it gets through, yeah who knew
it's days like this when I crave you the most
shivers down my spine when your holding me close

Oh long night
I want you all to myself from now 'til the morning light
maybe we could make a
great escape
run away like thieves and we'll lock the world away
somewhere no one will ever find us on this long night
long night

[Repeat Chorus]
