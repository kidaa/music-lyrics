Four o'clock in the morning 
My mind's filled with a thousand thoughts of you 
And how you left without a warning 
But looking back I'm sure you tried to talk it through 

Now I see it clearly 
We're together but living separate lives 

So wanna tell you I'm sorry 
Baby I can't find the words 
But if I could then you know I would yeah 

No I won't let you go know what we can be 
I won't watch my life crashing down on me 
Guess I had it all right there before my eyes 
Girl I'm sorry now you 
Were the last thing on my mind 

You carried me like a river 
How far we've come still surprises me 

And now I look in the mirror 
Staring back is the man 
I used to be 

With you 
How I long for you 

No I won't let you go know what we can be 
I won't watch my life crashing down on me 
Guess I had it all right there before my eyes 
Girl I'm sorry now you 
Were the last thing on my mind 

Girl I'm sorry I was wrong 
Could have been there 
Should have been so strong 
So I'm sorry wooh 

No I won't let you go know what we can be 
I won't watch my life crashing down on me 
Guess I had it all right there before my eyes 
Girl I'm sorry now you 
Were the last thing on my mind
