Sometimes the time comes along
When it's time
Time to move on
You'll still be there
In everything that I do
And wherever I go I'll remember you

Leaving's not leaving
'Cause I'm not leaving you behind
You'll always be with me
Always be with me
Part of my hear from time
Wherever I'm goin'
Even if it's just in my mind
Leaving's not leaving
I'm not leaving you behind

Moments shared there with you
There the best times that I ever knew
They'll still be there
When good-byes are all through
I'll remember those days
I'll remember you

Leaving's not leaving
'Cause I'm not leaving you behind
You'll always be with me
Always be with me
Part of my hear from time
Wherever I'm goin'
Even if it's just in my mind
Leaving's not leaving
I'm not leaving you behind

I'll hold on to the memory
'Cause in my heart you'll be here with me
There's no reason to cry
Good-bye really isn't good-bye

Leaving's not leaving
'Cause I'm not leaving you behind
You'll always be with me
Always be with me
Part of my hear from time
Wherever I'm goin'
Even if it's just in my mind
Leaving's not leaving
I'm not leaving you behind

Leaving's not leaving
I'm not leaving you behind
Not leaving you
I'm not leaving you
No, no, no
I'm not leaving you
No, no, no
Not leaving you
