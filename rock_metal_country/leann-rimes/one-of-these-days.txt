Wish someone would tell me when
I won't think of you again.

I'll get past the emptiness and
Let a little happiness back in.

Pretending that you came,
Leaves me half way there.

One Of These, one Of These Days
I'll be completely over you.
Heaven knows how long it will take.
And One Of These, One Of These Days
I'll find somebody who'll love your memories away
One Of These Days

One Of These Days
Some how, some way

Ever since you've been gone,
Time has a way of dragging on and on.

Friends drive by for company,
But I'm not much company for long.

Oh I'll get past the what was,
If I live long enough

One Of These, One Of These Days
I'll be completely over you.
Heaven knows how long it will take.
And One Of These, One Of These Days
I'll find somebody who'll love your memories away some way
One Of These Days

One Of These Days
Some how, some way

One Of These, One Of These Days
I'll be completely over you.
Heaven knows how long it will take.
And One Of These, One Of These Days
I'll find somebody who'll love your memories away some way
One Of These Days

One Of These Days One Of These Days
One Of These Days Some how, some way
One Of These Days One Of These Days
