I've blamed it, I've cursed it, I've got in its way
God knows how much of it I've thrown away
It's twisted and tangled and hard to define
It keeps coming at me one day at a time

[Chorus]
This life is all that I've got
All the I am
All that I'm not
It's worth all I go through cause this life came with you

You're right beside me to help it make sense
The rock in this ocean that I break against
The dead ends and darkness they don't disappear
But it keeps getting better the longer you're here

[Chorus]
This life is all that I've got
All the I am
All that I'm not
It's worth all I go through cause this life came with you
