I've been catchin' a glance
Do you like what you see
Even across the room
Your eyes been talkin' to me
Easy to tell you've turned some heads in your day
Hopin' you'll choose the next slow dance to walk my way

Nothin' like a good lookin'
Good lookin' man
More about you than meets the eye
I wanna know first hand
Baby, I've got this strong feeling
Strong as a woman ca
I'm lookin' into the face of love
And it's a good lookin' man

How did you guess we'd fit
Right in each other's arms
Talkin' as if we're all alone
Workin' your charm
I'm liking that easy temper
You try not to show
Notice the shyness in the way
You smile real slow

Nothin' like a good lookin'
Good lookin' man
More about you than meets the eye
I wanna know first hand
Baby, I've got this strong feeling
Strong as a woman ca
I'm lookin' into the face of love
And it's a good lookin' man

Come a little closer
Closer yet
The longer I'm with you
The better and better it gets

Nothin' like a good lookin'
Good lookin' man
More about you than meets the eye
I'm findin' out first hand
Baby, I've got this strong feeling
Strong as a woman can
I'm lookin' into the face of love
And it's a good lookin' man

Come a little closer
Closer yet
Ooooh, closer yet
Closer yet
