Busted flat it Baton Rouge, waitin' for a train
When I was feelin' nearly as faded as my jeans
Well, Bobby thumbed a diesel down, just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans.
Well, I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
I was playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues
Windshield wipers slappin' time
I's holding Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew.
Freedom's just another word
For nothin' left to lose
And nothin' ain't worth nothin'
But it ain't free
Feelin' good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
You know, feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and by Bobby McGee.
From the Kentucky coalmine to the California Sun
Where Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
Yea, Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then one day near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
He's looking for that home and I hope he finds it
Yea, I'd trade all of my tomorrows for a single yesterday
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine.
Freedom's just another word
For nothin' left to lose
And nothin' ain't worth nothin'
But it ain't free
Feelin' good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
You know, feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and by Bobby McGee.
