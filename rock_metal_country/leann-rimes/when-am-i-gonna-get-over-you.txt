You told me on the day that you left me
To take real good care of myself.
But it's so hard to do if I can't have
You here to hold me when I want nobody else
When Am I Gonna Get Over You
And stop living in the past
When Am I Gonna Get Over You
When my poor heart beats its last.
Soon you'll wake me and you'll
say I've been dreaming
I'll just have to wait til then.
Until my time here is done and
the angels come to take me.
Then I'll be with you again.
When Am I Gonna Get Over You
And stop living in the past
When Am I Gonna Get Over You
When my poor heart beats its last.
Someday, I may love again but
you'll be with me even then.
When Am I Gonna Get Over You
And stop living in the past
When Am I Gonna Get Over You
When my poor heart beats its last.
You told me on the day that you left me
