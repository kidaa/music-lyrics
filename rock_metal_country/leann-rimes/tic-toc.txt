Come inside my walls of
ecstasy, within me
Close the door and throw away
the key
That's the way you can start by
moving in nice and slow
Taking your time to move 
down low
Cuz everything you do is 
everything I need
Lights are low, so here we go,
let's get busy

Tic Toc
Hands on the clock
Time to make my body rock
Move with me, you get me
So hot that I can't stop
Tic Toc
You got the spot
Here I come ready or not
Move with me, you get me
So hot that I can't stop
Tic Toc Tic Toc baby
Tic Toc Tic Toc baby

You opened up my world to 
paradise, so nice
Feels so good my body 
liquefies
When you touch me I lose
control and start to shake
Your love is so good I ain't
gotta fake
Cuz everything you do is
everything I like
The plot thickens, time's tick'n,
you're my toy tonight

[Chorus]

Tic Toc the clock keeps
on tick'n
Hurry up before it gets too late
Tic Toc the clock keeps on
tick'n
Hurry up before it gets too late

A little to the left
A little to the right
A little bit longer
All the way tonight
I close my eyes, my body 
tenses
Boy your touch hits all my
senses
Don't stop 
Come on
I'm almost there
In the middle of the night
Reality stops
And I'm suspended
In your arms 
As I melt from your touch

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
