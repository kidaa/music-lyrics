I know all about,
Yea about your reputation 
And now it's bound to be a heartbreak situation 
But I can't help it if I'm helpless 
Every time that I'm with you, ah
You walk in and my strength walks out the door 
Say my name and I can fight it any more 
Oh I know, I should go 
But I need your touch just too damn much 
Lovin you, That isn't really something I should do 
I shouldn't wanna spend my time with you ya 
Well I should try to be strong 
But baby you're the right kind of wrong 
But baby you're the right kind of wrong 
Ya, baby you're the right kind of wrong

It might be a mistake 
A mistake I'm makin' 
But what your givin I am happy to be takin 
'Cause all that will make me feel 
The way I feel when I'm in your arms

They say your somethin I should do without 
They don't know what goes on 
When the lights go out 
There's no way to explain 
All the pleasure is worth all the pain 
Lovin you, That isn't really something I should do ya-hey 
I shouldn't wanna spend my time with you ya 
Well I should try to be strong 
But baby you're the right kind of wrong

'Cause every time I run your the one I run to 
Can't do without what you do to me,
