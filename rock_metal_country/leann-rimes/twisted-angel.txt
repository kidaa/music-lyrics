Ever since I was a little child
I was told to do no wrong
The angel in my mama's
precious eyes
Could be a devil with a heart
of stone

I couldn't help myself,
just had to go my way
Now I've got hell to pay

Yeah I'm a twisted angel
Flying wild and free
Yeah I'm a twisted angel
Flying to heaven on a 
broken wing

Back when I was daddy's little girl
He brought me up on the
Rolling Stones
Thrown into the flame,
thrown into the world
That's when I learned how to rock n'roll

Look's like everything
has gone my way
But I've still got hell to raise

[Chorus]

My mama taught me right
But the devil's up my sleeve
It's made me kind of crazy
But it's all right with me

[Chorus]
