You may have a tabloid life
pay for all your friend
You may be a suburban wife 
with your white picket fence
You may be a suit and tie
paying off your high rise rent
When it all comes down
When it all comes down baby
When it all comes down to it

Doesn't everybody want the same thing
to be loved
Doesn't everybody want the same thing
why isn't that enough
Doesn't everybody want the same thing

You may be a night shift waitress
to send your kid through school
You may be a stubborn doctor 
pushing for the cure
You may be a bitter divorce 
wandering what he saw in her
When it all comes down
When it all comes down baby
When it all comes down to it

Doesn't everybody want the same thing
to be loved
Doesn't everybody want the same thing
why isn't that enough
Doesn't everybody want the same thing
