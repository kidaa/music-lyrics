I never meant to cause you any sorrow
I never meant to cause you any pain
I only wanted to one time see you laughing
I only wanted to see you laughing in the Purple Rain
Purple Rain Purple Rain
Purple Rain Purple Rain
Purple Rain Purple Rain
I only wanted to see you bathing in the Purple Rain
I never wanted to be your weekend lover
I only wanted to be some kind of friend
Baby I could never steal you from another
It's such a shame our friendship had to end
Purple Rain Purple Rain
Purple Rain Purple Rain
Purple Rain Purple Rain
I only wanted to see you underneath the Purple Rain
Honey I know, I know, I know times are changing
It's time we all reach out for something new
That means you to
You say you want a leader
But you can't seem to make up your mind
I think you better close it
And let me guide you to the Purple Rain
Purple Rain Purple Rain
Purple Rain Purple Rain
If you know what I'm singing about up here
C'mon raise your hand
Purple Rain Purple Rain
I only want to see you,
only want to see you
In the Purple Rain
