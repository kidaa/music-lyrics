Fear is any army
Fighting against me
Fighting a lost cause
If I could only change their uniform
They'd be soldiers of love
Marching on and on

Love is any army
Waiting for me
Waiting for this girl
If I could only stretch my arms around you
I'd suddenly see
There ain't nothin' wrong with me
Hear

Words fly out
The roof of my mouth
They found a flaw
In my armor
Heart so still
Your beating will
Heal the wars I remember,
remember

Blue is the ocean
Calling me in
Calling me near
If I could only learn
To breathe down here
I know I would be
At home under the sea
Yeah

[Chorus]

I'll bend my sword
Against the world
I'll push on through
In spite of you

Love is an army
Waiting for me
Waiting for this girl
