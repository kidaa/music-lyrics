You've got me wrapped up in you 
Somehow you let me in 
Into your web of bittersweet, of ecstasy and sin 
Feel like an angel falling out from grace 

[Chorus:]
I try to run, but I keep on falling 
And every time I turn around 
I hear your voice and it keeps on calling 
I'm bound, there's no way out 
No way out..... 

You wanted me to want you 
I couldn't help myself 
You became my addiction 
I won't need nothing else 
Feel like I'm trapped inside these walls 
Trying to find my way 

[Chorus]

[Spoken:]
It's like a dream, you can't wake up from.
It's a hunger that can't be satisfied.... 

No matter how I try there's no escape.... 

[Chorus x2]
