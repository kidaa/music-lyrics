Mamma's crying again here baby's no where to be found
the world has gone taken her away
Daddy went and ran off with some white trash half his age
left me at home to pay for his mistakes
My sister held my hand when that bad boy broke my heart
Ain't no miles ain't no man could ever tear us apart

Here I stand on roots that deep
We laugh we cry we hurt we bleed
We're best of friends and worst enemies
We're all to blame, were all the same, make no apologies
This is my family

Can't forget the night that uncle William passed away
we were forced to recognize his weird disease
I ran away and ran around with a man twice my age
ain't it funny how some things never change

Here I stand on roots that deep
We laugh we cry we hurt we bleed
We're best of friends and worst enemies
We're all to blame, were all the same, make no apologies
This is my family

Don't you try to shame my name 
Cause til the death I will defend
Yeah their blood runs through my veins
It's where I start and where I'll end

Here I stand on roots that deep
We laugh we cry we hurt we bleed
We're best of friends and worst enemies
We're all to blame, were all the same, make no apologies
This is my family
