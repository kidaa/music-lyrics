Never seen a sky so blue
I've never been happy with anyone
Like I am when I'm with you, yeah
Look at the sun shining up in the sky
I feel a little closer to heaven, baby
When I'm looking into your eyes

As long as we're together, boy
I'm sittin' on top of the world
Wanna feel this way forever, boy
I'm sittin' on top of the world

Last night I lay in the dark
Tryin' to figure it out
Tryin' to talk to my heart
Now it's morning and I still don't know why
All I know is that you got me feelin' so good, baby
All I know is that it feels the way true love should
Ain't no one luckier than you and I

As long as we're together, boy
I'm sittin' on top of the world
Wanna feel this way forever, boy
I'm sittin' on top of the world

And everybody's got an opinion 'bout how this should be
But they don't understand it
No, no they just can't see
That I belong to you and baby, baby,
Baby, you belong with me

As long as we're together, boy
I'm sittin' on top of the world
Wanna feel this way forever, boy
I'm sittin' on top of the world

Now as long as we're together, boy
I'm sittin' on top...
Said, I'm sittin' on top...
Sittin' on top of the world

My baby loves me
'Cause my baby's so good to me
I know he needs me
'Cause my baby's so good to me

No I've never been happy, baby
Like I am when I get next to you
Yeah...
Mmmm...
