Have no fear
when darkness falls
'cause there's a light that shines
within us all
although this world 
can turn so cold
when we reach inside
we find our warmth

'cause there's a flame that burns
in every heart
and it's the will we have
that lights the spark

[chorus]

once in every lifetime
there's a chance to stand apart
we can show the world 
our very best
reveal what's in our heart
so the story goes and glory
never will end
inspiration lights the fire within

and if we fall
we won't stay down
we will get back up
and use the strength we've found
and we will rise 
like champions
every obstacle
we'll overcome

[repeat chorus]

and if we just stay strong
then our hearts will move us on

[repeat chorus]

each heart there burns desire
inspiration lights the fire within
