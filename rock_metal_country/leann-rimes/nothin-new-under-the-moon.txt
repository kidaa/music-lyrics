Nowhere to go
All night to get there
Another nice try with Mr. Wrong
Late night TV on my horizon
National Anthem and I'm barely hangin' on
Just a typical Saturday night
Feeling like the rest of my life

There was nothin' new under the moon
Same old dance, same old tune
Just wishes on stars that never came true
Just one more night to get through
But there was nothin' new under the moon, 'til you

Hey what a change
Hey what a concept
Here's a true heart wanting mine
News flash, who'd ever thought you could
Have the same feeling at the very same time
Look at what your love's doing to me
I can't believe I used to believe

That there was nothin' new under the moon
Same old dance, same old tune
Just wishes on stars that never came true
Just one more night to get through
There was nothin' new under the moon, 'til you

Nothin' new under the moon
Same old dance, same old tune
Just wishes on stars that never came true
Just one more night to get through
There was nothin' new under the moon, 'til you
Nothin' new under the moon, til you

There was nothin' new under the moon, 'til you
Nothin' new, 'til you
There was nothin' new under the moon, 'til you
