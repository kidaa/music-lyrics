You and I....

There you go again when ya
Rub up my skin
I have to catch my breathe
I began to sweat
Oh..

Lips
Tracing down my neck
And its scaring me to death
How'd you learn to draw me to the cliff
Just to push me off
Just to push me off the edge

Damn I hate the way you know me
And Damn
You kill when you hold me
Like I'm your world
Like this wont hurt
Like a favorite curse hitting every nerve
Damn
I'm fighting and I'm losing and
Damn you
You're pulling and a pushing
I'm wrestling with
I toss and twist
'Til finally I give in
Damn...

I hate being addicted
Only
You would have predicted
That I'd be torn
And worn so thin
You can see right through
You can see right through my soul

Damn I hate the way you know me
And Damn
You kill when you hold me
Like I'm your world
Like this wont hurt
Like a favorite curse hitting every nerve
Damn
I'm fighting and I'm losing and
Damn you
You're pulling and a pushing
I'm wrestling with
I toss and twist
'Til finally I give in

I get wreckless, scared, confused
I feel desperate
So for you
And you know it
You know it
You know it, yes you do

Damn I hate the way you know me
And Damn
You kill when you hold me
Like I'm your world
Like this wont hurt
Like a favorite curse hitting every nerve
Damn
I'm fighting and I'm losing and
Damn you
You're pulling and a pushing
I'm wrestling with
I toss and twist
Baby I give in
Damn...
