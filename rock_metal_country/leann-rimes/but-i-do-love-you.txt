I don't like to be alone at night
And I don't like to hear I'm wrong when I'm right
And I don't like to have the rain on my shoes
But I do love you

I don't like to see the sky painted grey
And I don't like when nothing's going my way
And I don't like to be the one with the blues
But I do love you

I love everything about the way you're loving me
The way you lay your head upon my shoulder when you sleep
And I love to kiss you in the rain
I love everything you do oh I do

I don't like to turn the radio on
Just to find I miss my favourite song
And I don't like to be the lasting news
But I do love you

I love everything about the way you're loving me
The way you lay your head upon my shoulder when you sleep
And I love to kiss you in the rain
I love everything you do oh I do

And I don't like to be alone at night
And I don't like to hear I'm wrong when I'm right
And I don't like to have the rain on my shoes
But I do love you
