I love to sit and watch you work the room
you could have anyone you want to
but I know you know your going home with me
just when I think I've got you figured out
you spin me faster than the speed of sound
but I know you know it makes me want you more
makes me want you more

Boy you're turning me on
I wanna be the bed that you'll be laying on
Yeah, I wanna be yours your anything and everything
I wanna be that song comin through your headphones

Just like the purple ink in your tattoo
that's how close I want to be to you
under your skin I'm playing in your head
playing in your

Am I turning you on
I wanna be the bed that you'll be laying on
yeah, I wanna be yours your anything and everything
I wanna be that song coming through your headphones

I'd let my world revolve around you
I'd whisper sweet things in your ear
I've never loved but I'm about to
can't you feel us going there

[Chorus]
