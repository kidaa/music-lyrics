Hurt me
Why in the world did you hurt me
Just when I thought I'd found someone to trust,
you took away your love and...

Hurt me
I still can't believe you hurt me
Just when I thought it was safe to come in
You let me want you, and need you, and then
You left me, like a child in the rain
Now I'm mending myself of the pain
Oh, you hurt me

Yes, you left me
Like a child in the rain
Now I'm lost in an ocean of pain
Oh, you hurt me
I fell in love and it hurt me
Can't you imagine how I'm feeling now
Oh, will you ever know how
You hurt me.
