If I could smoke a cigarette right now I would
rip out of my skin commit the sins oh I could
if I could break a heart and throw it all away for just one night
my conscience wouldn't care if I just went ahead and wrecked my life

I want to be destructive
trash everything in site
beat the Devil at his game
abuse myself all night
I want to bitch the world out
one loud aching scream
don't want anybody wanting anything from me

I'm sick of being perfect with your perfect little smile
pick a fight with danger be a stranger to myself for a while
I want to come unraveled and have it out with my soul
I'm tired of all the voices telling me which way to go
I wish you'd silence your opinion
that's the last thing that I want to know

I want to be destructive
trash everything in site
beat the Devil at his game
abuse myself all night
I want to bitch the world out
one loud aching scream
don't want anybody wanting anything from me

I'll fell better when I'm sane
but now I want to feel no pain
I'm really sick of thinking
I just want to be destructive

I want to be destructive
trash everything in site
beat the Devil at his game
abuse myself all night
I want to bitch the world out
one loud aching scream
don't want anybody wanting anything from me
