Cross my heart 
And I swear the truth
Love was dead to me til I met you
I spent a lot of time building up these walls
Then you come strutting in
With your wrecking ball
Just another girl defeated
Till you gave me what I needed

Something I can feel
Something I can feel deep down
What did I do to deserve someone who gives me a love
That gets better and better and better

Sometimes I've got to bite my tongue 
It even freaks me out the way I talk you up
Your like a back flip off a trampoline
You just say my name I'm dizzy on my feet
When my day goes numb and empty
You know exactly how to give me

Something I can feel
Something I can feel deep down
Yeah, you know you're striking a nerve
That keeps making this better and better and better
Something I can feel
I never ever need to ask for more no
What did I do to deserve someone who gives me a love
That gets better and better and better

What did I 
What did I do to find someone who gives me a love 
What did I 
What did I do to find someone who gives me a love and

Something I can feel
Something I can feel deep down
Yeah, you know you're striking a nerve
That keeps making this better and better and better
Something I can feel
I never ever need to ask for more no
What did I do to deserve someone who gives me a love
That gets better and better and better
