Mamma's high heels
Cherry lipstick
And a goodwill dress
Play pretending
Dance for the mirror
A ferry tale princess

Pretty things are yours to hold 
My pretty thing soon you will know
That pretty things you think you need are not what make you beautiful
Pretty things will rob you blind 
Pretty things will fade in time
It's what inside that makes you shine
My pretty thing

It's only natural
Tables turning
And gracefully I'll learn
How to cradle 
The one who raised me
Who'll be to fragile for this world

Pretty things are yours to hold 
My pretty thing soon you will know
That pretty things you think you need are not what make you beautiful
Pretty things will rob you blind 
Pretty things will fade in time
It's what inside that makes you shine
My pretty thing

Selfless and faithful
As good as you should be
Open and fearless 
Oh what a gift you gave me

Pretty things are your to hold 
My pretty thing soon you will know
That pretty things you think you need are not what make you beautiful
Pretty things will rob you blind
Pretty things will fade in time
What lived inside of you still shines
My pretty thing
