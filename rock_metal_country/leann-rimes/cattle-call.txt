The cattle are prowlin'

The coyotes are howlin'
Way out where the doggies roam
Where spurs are a jinglin'
And the cowboy is singing
His lonesome cattle call

He rides in the sun
'Til his days work is done
And he rounds up the cattle each fall
Singing his cattle call

For hours he would ride
On the range far and wide
When the night wind blows up and slow
His heart is a feather
In all kinds of weather
He sings his cattle call

He's browned as a fairy
From ridin' the prairie
And he sings with an western drawl
Singing his cattle call
