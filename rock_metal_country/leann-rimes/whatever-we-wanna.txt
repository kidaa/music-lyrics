Meet me for breakfast on an airplane
will crash a party for the Queen of England
show me what what you've got in the parking lot until we get caught

We can do it if we wanna lets go mad
no one's ever gonna stop fun will have
let them stop and stare they must think we care
but all I see is you
we can do it if we wanna gonna do
whatever we wanna

Strip down to nothing in the ocean
buy every bottle of Crystal in San Trope
pass it all around till the sun goes down and we hit the ground

We can do it if we wanna lets go mad
no one's ever gonna stop fun will have
let them stop and stare they must think we care
but all I see is you
we can do it if we wanna gonna do
whatever we wanna

Let them stop and stare they must think we care
but all I see is you

We can do it if we wanna lets go mad
no one's ever gonna stop fun will have
let them stop and stare they must think we care
but all I see is you
we can do it if we wanna gonna do
whatever we wanna
