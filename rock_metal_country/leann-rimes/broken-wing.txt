Today I watched a robin in our front yard
I thought by now that they schoud all be gone
With winter 'round the corner
Snow on it's way
Surely there must be something wrong
Then in that old oak tree I finally saw her
Where she sat gazing down upon her mate
And the song that she was singing
Seemed to say I'll be right here
I'd like to go but your love's made me wait

He's got a broken wing
And that's why he can't fly
She just can't leave him there
So she stays by his side
They're just like you and me
Oh you should've heard her sing
They won't give up
It's just a broken wing

I wish we all could learn
What they seem to have found
To love our families
When trouble comes around
I'll bet that God saw fit
To show them both to me
Him on the ground
Her in that tree

He's got a broken wing
And that's why he can't fly
She just can't leave him there
So she stays by his side
They're just like you and me
Oh you should've heard her sing
They won't give up
She won't give up
They won't give up
It's just a broken wing

Ooooooooh
It's just a broken wing
