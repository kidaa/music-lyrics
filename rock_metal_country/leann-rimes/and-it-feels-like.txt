I remember every touch, every flower, every word you ever said
I remember how we looked at each other the very first time we met
I'll never forget
I remember every smile, every letter, every kiss you gave to me
How we'd talk and you'd hold me for hours until I'd fall fast asleep
You said you would always be there should I need your arms around me
But now that I've fallen to my knees, I don't think you give a damn about me

And it feels like we're running out of time
And it feels like I'm the last thing on your mind
I can touch your skin, I can hear you breathe
Baby will you tell me what's wrong
Cause it feels like you're already gone

Did you leave in the middle of the night and forget to say goodbye?
Did you feel it was time to go but you didn't want to see me cry?
It's harder and harder for me to believe you still love me
Get on with it baby if you're gonna leave
It's not worth saving

And it feels like we're running out of time
And it feels like I'm the last thing on your mind
I can touch your skin, I can hear you breathe
Baby will you tell me what's wrong
Cause it feels like you're already gone

My heart is telling me it's too late to beg you to stay
You wouldn't hear me anyway

And it feels like we're running out of time
And it feels like I'm the last thing on your mind
I can touch your skin, I can hear you breathe
Baby will you tell me what's wrong
Cause it feels like you're already gone

And it feels like we're running out of time
And it feels like I'm the last thing on your mind
I can touch your skin, I can hear you breathe
Baby will you tell me what's wrong
Cause it feels like you're already gone

Cause it feels like it's all gone...
