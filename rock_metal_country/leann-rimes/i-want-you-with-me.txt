When I'm walking down the street
on a quiet afternoon
Or when I hear our favorite song 
and it gets me in the mood
When I don't know who I am 
and the world is not my friend
When I fight my way back up again

Oh, I want you with me every move I make
I want you to see all that I see
Through the laughter and the madness
And every moment in between
Oh, I 
I want you with me

When I tell my daddy bye 
for the very last time
Or when I learn a whole new love
in our babies first cry
When you can tell I've done it all
by the lines on my face
When I start regretting my mistakes

Oh, I want you with me every move I make
I want you to see all that I see
Through the laughter and the madness
And every moment in between
Oh, I 
I want you with me
