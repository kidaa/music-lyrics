Time, sometimes the time just slips away
And your left with yesterday 
Left with the memories 
I, I'll always think of you and smile 
And be happy for the time 
I had you with me 
Though we go our seperate ways 
I won't forget so don't forget 
The memories we made

Please remember, please remember 
I was there for you 
And you were there for me 
Please remember, our time together 
The time was yours and mine 
While we were wild and free 
Please remember, please remember me

Goodbye, there's just no sadder word to say 
And it's sad to walk away 
With just the memories 
Who's to know what might have been 
We'll leave behind a life and time 
I'll never know again

Please remember, please remember 
I was there for you 
And you were there for me
And remember, please remember me

Please remember, please remember 
I was there for you 
And you were there for me 
Please remember, our time together 
The time was yours and mine 
While we were wild and free 
Please remember, please remember me

And how we laugh and how we smile 
And how this heart was yours and mine 
And how a dream was out of reach 
I stood by you, you stood by me 
We took each day and made it shine 
We wrote our names across the sky 
We ride so fast, we ride so free 
And I knew that you had me

Please remember, Please remember
