Well he used to be mine
Not 'til very long ago
I was crazy to ever let him get away
But girl you should know better
Then to go braggin' in my face
So forgive me for what I'm 'bout to say

Big deal
So what? Who cares?
Ya just got lucky that's all it was
Shut up
Don't wanta hear another word about
Candelight and long stem roses
And how you're fallin' head over heels
In love, so what?
Big deal

He's perfect, I heard ya
The first ten times that ya told me
Yeah, yeah, it's amazin' his lovin'
I can't believe I let him go'o'o
I regret it, there I said it
Ya call yourself a friend
But ya just keep rubbin' it in

Big deal
So what? Who cares?
Ya just got lucky that's all it was
I swear if I hear another word about
Candelight or long stem roses
And how you're fallin' head over heels
In love, so what?
Big deal

Congadulations, I'm just so happy for you
I can't contain the way I feel

Big deal, big deal
So what? Who cares?
Ya just got lucky that's all it was
Shut up
Don't wanta hear another word about
Candelight and long stem roses
And how you're fallin' head over heels
In love, so what?
Big deal
