I am here to tell you
We can never meet again
Simple really isn't it
A word or two and then
A life time of not knowing
Where or how or why or when
You think of me or speak of me
Or wonder what be fair
Of someone you once loved so long ago somewhere

Never wonder where to feel
As living shuffles by
You don't have to ask me
And i need not reply
Never know what of my life
From now until I die
I don't think or dream of you
And fail to understand
How a perfect love can becan found and out of hand

Is it written in the stars
Are we paying for some crime
Is that all that we are good for
Just a stretch of mortal time
Is this god's experiment
In which we have no scent
In which we've given paradise
But only for a day

Nothing can be alto
Or there is nothing to decide
No escape no change of heart
No any place to hide

You are all I'll ever want
But this i am denying
Sometimes in my darkest thoughts
I wish i never loved
What it is to be in love
And have that love returned

Is it written in the stars
Are we paying for some crime
Is that all that we are good for
Just a stretch of mortal time
Is this god's experiment
In which we have no scent
In which we are given paradise
But only for a day x3
