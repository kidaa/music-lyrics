Life can put distance between us
Days even years could pass on
But the love that lies between us
Will always be worth holding on

Together forever always
From the dawn 'till the end of the day
No matter how far or where you are
We're together forever always

I could try to forget you
But the memories keep lingering on
And the dreams I dream about you
They always keep me holding on

Together forever always
From the dawn 'till the end of the day
No matter how far or where you are
We're together forever always

Together forever always
From the dawn 'till the end of the day
No matter how far or where you are
We're together forever always

Together forever always
From the dawn 'till the end of each day
No matter how far or where you are
We're together forever always
We're together forever always
