These Arms Of Mine long to hold you again.
Like they did long ago.
The winds of time, if left untamed
Can chill the flame and kill its love
But this love in me still is only to feel
The touch of yours in These Arms of Mine
This love in me still is only to feel
The touch of yours in These Arms of Mine
The touch of yours in These Arms of Mine
