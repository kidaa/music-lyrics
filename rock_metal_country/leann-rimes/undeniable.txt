Being here together
Is like dreaming wide awake
Once you've found perfection
You know it's no mistake
Too many times
I've tried too hard
To make love
Become real
You showed me how
My life can change
When love is meant to be
It's Undeniable
Your love is Undeniable
It's Undeniable.
True love is Undeniable.
It's Undeniable
You can change direction
You can change your mind
Cold sky and close your eyes
But the sun's still gonna shine
'Cause when the magic comes your way
And you say it isn't real
Yeah!
There's no use to try to lie
About the way you make me feel.
It's Undeniable
Your love is Undeniable
It's Undeniable.
True love is Undeniable.
It's Undeniable
I can't turn it down
I can't turn it down
No one else can turn it around
It's the truest thing I've ever found
It's Undeniable
Your love is Undeniable
It's Undeniable.
True love is Undeniable.
It's Undeniable
