I want the truth when the world is lying
I want to live or at least die trying
I want to share my soul cause it heals me every time
I want to scream when there's fear inside
I want to run when I gotta free ride
I want to shed my skin if I feel the urge to fly
I will fall on my face to bruised and broken

To save myself I don't want to save myself
I just want to live out loud feel the rush that's all around
I light the flames to feel the burn trouble everywhere I turn
there's freedom in the lessons learned and beauty when the loves returned

I want to breathe like it's my first breath
I want to bleed when I'm put to the test
I want to dig down deep and find out who I am
and I will love like a love lost to scared and open

Save myself I don't want to save myself
I just want to live out loud feel the rush that's all around
I lite the flames to feel the burn trouble everywhere I turn
there's freedom in the lessons learned and beauty when the loves returned
