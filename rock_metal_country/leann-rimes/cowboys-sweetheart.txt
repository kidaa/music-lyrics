I wanna be a cowboy's sweetheart
I wann learn to rope and ride
I wanna ride through the plains and the desert
Out west of The Great Divide
I wanna hear the coyotes singing
As the sun sets in the west
I wanna be a cowboy's sweetheart
That's the life I love the best.

I wann ride a paint
Moce it at a run
I wanna feel the wind in my face
A thousand miles away from all
Movin' in the cowman's face
I wann pillow my head
Beneath the open sky
As the sun sets in the west
I wanna strum my guitar and  yodel-le-hee-hee 
That's the life I love the best
