And every day begins the same
Get up, go out, come back again
Same old same old
A thousand faces pass you by
You never look into their eyes
You feel so ordinary
They feel so ordinary

Hey...
Everybody's someone
No matter where you come from
There's light in every single star
You're more than who you think you are
And hey
Everybody's someone
And when it's hard to hold on
Remember you are not alone
This house is everybody's home

And every day we seem to chase
The perfect smile, the perfect face
Same old same old
For every one who gets to shine
A million more are left behind
They feel so ordinary
You feel so ordinary

[Chorus]
From a king to a comman man
We're all part of a greater plan

Hey...
There's light in every single star
You're more than who you think you are
And hey
Everybody's someone
And when it's hard to hold on
Remember you are not alone
This house is everybody's home
Hey...
