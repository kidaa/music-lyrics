Up and down the stairs
In and out the door
Walked every inch of the floor
You think you know a place
But there locked in an empty room
Out of the dark comes you

[Chorus]
I feel, I feel, I feel a flood of light fall on my face
I see, I see, I see for the first time
I hurt, I hurt, I hurt so good inside I swear I could die
I love, I love, I love for the first time

What is the fallin'
No - dancin' down my cheek
Why's it hard for me to speak
You think you know a heart
And then it suddenly starts to pound
It literally knocks you down

[Chorus]
I feel, I feel, I feel a flood of light fall on my face
I see, I see, I see for the first time
I hurt, I hurt, I hurt so good inside I swear I could die
I love, I love, I love for the first time
