You never sing for pleasure
You only make the sounds
You never feel the magic
Cause you think the world is round
You never dance in moonlight
You run but you never move
You don't believe in someday
And the truth is what you prove
But it's alright
Just another day
Too many chains around you
You laugh but you never smile
You don't belong in Heaven
But you're here all the while
And it's alright
All right
Just another day
Another day
Another Day to let you down
Another way that they have found
Another Day
Another way
You never sing for pleasure
You only make the sounds
You never feel the magic
You think the world is spinning round
for you
But it's alright
All right
Well it's alright
Just Another Day
