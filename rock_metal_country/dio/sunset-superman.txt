The night has a thousand eyes
But he moves in only places
Where the eyes can never be
The night tells a thousand lies
And when you wake up in the morning
Were you dreaming
Screaming
Tryin to hide your burnin' heart
Before somebody cuts it all away
Sunset superman
Sunset superman
Sunset superman
Somebody start the game
And the dark will just get louder
As it shouts away the light
A shadow without a name
But when he wakes up in the morning
He just won't know
Was he a hero
Trying to hide his burning heart
Before somebody cuts it all away
Sunset superman
Sunset superman
Sunset superman
Anybody can
Sunset superman
The night has a thousand eyes
But he moves in only places
Where the eyes can never be
The night tells a thousand lies
And when you wake up in the morning
Were you dreaming
Screaming
Tryin to hide your broken heart
Before somebody cuts it all away
Sunset superman
Sunset superman
Sunset superman
Sunset superman
Sunset superman
Superman---ooh
Sunset superman
Sunset superman
Sunsetsuperman---ooh
Anybody can
Anybody can
Sunsetsuperman---ooh
Sunset superman
