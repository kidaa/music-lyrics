Dio/Robertson/Bain
Looking on the  ?  side
You're waiting for your life to walk away
Writings on a wall
You just dream forever, forever
Face it - it's another day
And it's gonna be the same tomorrow
The sun is gonna go away
So let it shine on - shine on, yeah, yeah
When you move to the rhythm of shadows
You can hide from the heat of the sun
'Cos If you dance to the beat of the darkness
You burn before the fire's begun
Then comes the night
You come alive
CHORUS:
With night music
It keeps spinning around my head
Night music
It's all the things that you never said
And anywhere you are
There's night music
So open up your arms
Let the night time in
Say the word and it begins
In the night you're the song and the singer
You can choose what the band's gonna play
Write the words under cover of moonlight, oh
Make some magic with the things that you say
Together we can kill the day
CHORUS:
Night music
You're singer  ? ? ? 
Night music
Where's the place we can belong
Here comes the night
You will survive
Dancing in the moonlight
Makes you feel alive
Open your arms
Let it begin
Just open up the magic
Let the night time in
