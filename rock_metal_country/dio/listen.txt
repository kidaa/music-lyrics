I'd hoped you were sorry
For things that you've said
But now disillusion's
All I feel instead
Your head is a mess
And you scream and you shout
'Cos you were born jealous
Forever in doubt

CHORUS:
Listen,
Listen to what I've got to say
Why don't you listen?
Try to see things my way
Now, listen
Why believe I'd deceive you with someone else
Why don't you listen?
Listen
Listen
Listen

Now, I justify and explain
My deeds all day long
But all you can hear are those voices say
I done you wrong
You want to keep me in chains
But I was born free
And I ain't gonna change
