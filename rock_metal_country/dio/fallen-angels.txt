Screaming out alone in the night
Just a time and place
But it's real all right
We are diamonds that shine without fire
We're climbing the stairs
Goind down and never higher
Fallen Angels
Going down
Something came to me in a dream
The crack of a gun and a bloody scream
The I could see the faces and why
I was holding the gun
And the world began to die
It's a criminal world
And we all get to play
You're a criminal
Sins of the children
Never get washed away
We're Fallen Angels
Goin' down
Fallen Angels
Come gather round
Screaming out alone in the night
Just a time and place
But it's real all right
We are diamonds that shine without fire
We are climbing the stairs
Going down and never higher
We're Fallen Angels
Fallen Angels
Fallen Angels
