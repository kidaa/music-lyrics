Hot nights - summer in the city
Just about to smoke and burn
Look out - He's evil but he's pretty
And oh he's gonna twist and turn
He's got the midnight madness
He's got control
He's the King of Rock and Roll
Bad blood - Everybody knows it
But everybody doesn't care
He's got the only way to show it
They want to see it everywhere
He's got to give you fever
He'll scratch your soul
He's the King of Rock and Roll
He's the King of Rock and Roll
Bad boy - Always on the cover
Gettin' the story told
Fast Fast - One way or another
Cause he'll never never never never never get old
He makes a special magic
And you've got control
You are the King of Rock and Roll
He's got the midnight madness
He's got a soul
Cause he's the King of Rock and Roll
The King of Rock and Roll
The King of Rock and Roll
The King of Rock and Roll
The King of Rock and Roll
