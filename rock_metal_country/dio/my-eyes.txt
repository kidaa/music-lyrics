Dio/Robertson/Johansson
My eyes can see inside tomorrow
My eyes can get next to you
Time flies on wings that just get stronger
My eyes are true
My eyes could see the body shakin'
My eyes were clear and bright
Goodbyes are easy to remember
You can see the hurt still there in my eyes
I've fallen off the edge of the world
I've fallen from the top of the mountain
Just to rise again
I've seen it from heaven and hell
I've seen it from the eyes of a stargazer
I want to be invisible
Just get me out of here
Could the dreamer be turning to stone, oh
CHORUS:
Rock and roll eyes
The color of rainbows - believer of lies
Rock and roll eyes, yeah
Don't want to see the end of it all
Just get me outta here
Just get me outta here
Just get me outta here
CHORUS:
Rock and roll eyes
The keeper of rainbows
Collector of lies
Rock and roll eyes
My eyes
Rock and roll eyes
Tell rock and roll lies
And rock and roll lies
Never end
Rock and roll friends
With rock and roll trends
And rock and roll ends
With my eyes
