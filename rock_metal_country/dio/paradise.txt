All my life I struggled to be free
Through heat and thunder
I just tried to be me
I'd rather be alone
Than in bad company
A strong-headed woman
You know I'll always be

But baby now
When you touch me there
And you kiss me there
And you soothe me there
I'm singing like the birds in the trees
When you touch me there
And you kiss me there
And you soothe me there
I shimmer like the moon on the sea

CHORUS:
I'm not so far from Paradise
I'm in Heaven
I'm not so far from Paradise
I'm in Heaven

God knows sometimes it's hard to be alone
And you wonder when
When some soul brother will come along
There were long lone nights
Endless nights where I
Would toss and turn
Ache and burn inside

But baby now
When you touch me there
And you kiss me there
And you soothe me there
I'm singing like the birds in the trees
When you touch me there
And you kiss me there
And you soothe me there
I shimmer like the moon on the sea
