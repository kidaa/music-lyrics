One silver dollar
Bright silver dollar
Changing hands
Changing hands

Endlessly rolling
Wasted or stolen
Changing hands
Changing hands

Spent for a beer his trinket
Won by a gambler's lust
Pierced by an outlaw's bullet
And found in the blood red dust

One silver dollar
One silver dollar
Changing hands
Changing hands

Love is a shining dollar
Bright as a churchbell's chime
Gambled and spent, and wasted
And lost in a dust of time

One silver dollar
One silver dollar
Changing hearts
Changing lives
Changing hands
