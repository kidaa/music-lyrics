You're a dancer
But you're dancing on air
Just a matter of time till you fall
You're a dreamer
One night at the fair
But still you want it all
You're in danger
The last of a line
But the vision lasts forever
So just hold on
You can make it happen for you
Reach for the stars and you will fly
You're Hungry for Heaven
Hungry for Heaven
Hungry for Heaven
But you need a little hell
You're a runner
But you're chasing yourself
Feel the hot breath on your shoulder
You're emotion
Running cold running warm
The young just getting older
We are sunlight
We can sparkle and shine
And our dreams are what we're made of
So just hold on
You can make it happen for you
Reach for the stars and you will fly
You're Hungry for Heaven
Hungry for Heaven
Hungry for Heaven
But you need a little hell
