Wake up Angelita, your mama just turned off the light
Manolo is already waiting by the old water-pipe
Her shoes in one hand she carefully walks down the stairs
Holding her breath 'cause there's danger and love in the air.

Ae ae ae ae ae ae Puerto Rico
Ae ae ae ae ae ae Puerto Rico

Your papa will beat him if he ever finds out
Begging the Virgin won't help when you hear Manolito shout,
Manolito shout
He's already standing under the starlit sky
You run to his arms and you laugh and you cry as he holds you tight

Ae ae ae ae ae ae Puerto Rico
Ae ae ae ae ae ae Puerto Rico

He says he'll be leaving you soon still you beg him to stay
But he wants to make it somewhere in the U.S.A.
And though he'll be far he promises he'll write every day
When time will be right, he'll come back and he'll take you away

Ae ae ae ae ae ae Puerto Rico
Ae ae ae ae ae ae Puerto Rico

Your papa don't like him, he says he's no good
He steals and he fights and he never behaves, like a young man should
Angelita she knows, he's not that bad inside
She takes the medal, she wears on a chain, and presses it into his palm.

Ae ae ae ae ae ae Puerto Rico
Ae ae ae ae ae ae Puerto Rico
