How could she let a man like you
Slip through her fingers?
I guess she didn't know
A good man is hard to find
I would have cherished and treasured that love
If I had been her
I would have thanked the Lord
Every morning for making you mine

CHORUS:
Baby, why don't you spend
An evening of love with me?
A moment of tenderness
Ain't it just what we both need
Let's make it
An evening of love to remember
An evening away from the past
Oh, baby
Maybe tomorrow you'll wake up to find
You don't need her
Maybe you'll realize
You never did
I'm gonna hold you real close to my heart
Say the words that will heal you
I'm gonna show you babe,
Show you how good it can feel
