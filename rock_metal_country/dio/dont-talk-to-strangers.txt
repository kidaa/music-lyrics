Don't talk to strangers
Cause they're only there to do you harm
Don't write in starlight
Cause the words may come out real
Don't hide in doorways
You may find the key that opens up your soul
Don't go to Heaven cause it's really only Hell
Don't smell the flowers
They're an evil drug to make you loose your mind
Don't dream of women cause they only bring you down
Hey you you know me you've touched I'm real
I'm forever the one that lets you look and see and
Feel me I'm danger - I'm the stranger
I I'm darkness I'm anger I'm pain
I am master
The evil song you sing inside your brain
Make you inside
Don't dance in darkness
You may stumble and you're sure to fall
Don't write in starlight
Cause the words may come out real
Don't talk to strangers
Cause they're only there to make you sad
Don't dream of women
Cause they'll only bring you down
