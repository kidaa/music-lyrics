Dio/Robertson/Bain/Appice
It's just a matter of time
He was the victim and he never saw the crime
He had invisible eyes
He told you truth but you were sure of it, lies
CHORUS:
'Cause he was twisted you could see it
He was twisted, all right
He was the fortunate one
He could have pulled the trigger
But he couldn't get the gun
They told him that he was blind
He didn't understand
'Cause he could see them inside
CHORUS:
They were twisted, oh
So Twisted
You could feel it they were
Twisted
Twisted up inside
Look inside any window
Come on and see the show
It's the same generation
They set you free
But they just won't let you go - no
It was a matter of time
They told me I was guilty
So I thought I did the crime
I never learned how to cry
And when I told the truth
They were sure it was a lie
Sure that I would cry
Sure of it
Sure of it 'cause I'm so
Twisted
She's twisted up inside
They're twisted
We're twisted
And when you're twisted
There's just no place to hide away
