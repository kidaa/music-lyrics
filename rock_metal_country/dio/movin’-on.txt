Don't you get tired of playing round
There's no peace of mind
Here to be found
So cold and so blue
This world goes round

CHORUS:
And there's nowhere to run to
Escape to
I'll be movin' on, movin' on
Movin' on

No, tell me no lies
I've seen the truth
Too many times
Your heart can be cruel
But so can mine

CHORUS

I'll be movin' on
Till the tears roll from your eyes
Movin' on
Till my heart has turned to ice
Movin' on
And you're gonna pay the price
