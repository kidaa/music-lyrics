Dio/Robertson
You say you've never seen the light before
Does anyone believe you
Don't let them hear you say anymore
Nothing's really safe around here
We are an imitation of the crown
We never turn the pages
They cannot let your spirit touch the ground
And nothing's gonna change around here, no
Crack in the ceiling
Hole in the wall
They bend you over
But you won't crawl away
You've got two in the bushes
One in the hand
They'd make you over
But they can't understand you
You're always gonna be the wild one
Pretend that all you really feel is pain
Just hide behind some sorrow
How sad
But you'd do it all again
I guess that Nobody changes 'round here
Cat in the cradle
Man in the moon
They'd make you over
But it's too soon to know, no
Smoke in the kitchen
Fire in the hall
The train is coming
And you can hear it calling
You're always gonna be the wild one
Crack in the ceiling
Hole in the wall
They bend you over
But you won't crawl away
You've got two in the bushes
One in the hand
They'd make you over
But they can't understand you
You're always gonna be the Wild One
