Shame on the night
For places I've been
And what I've seen
For giving me the strangest dreams
But you never really know just what they mean
So oh shame on the night
Shame on you
You've stolen the day
Snatched it away
But I saw the sky
An I never want to die
Now you know the reason why
Oh shame on the night
You don't care what you've done
So I think I'd better run
Shame on the sun
For the light you sold
I've lost my hold
On the magic flame
But now I know your name
Oh lord just go the way you came again
Oh shame on the night
You don't care what you've done
So I know I'd better run
Repeat verse 1
You don't care what you've done
Here I go I've got to run
