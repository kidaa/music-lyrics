Here's to you!
Here's to you! Here's to me!
Masters of the universe
The curse of destiny
All for one, it's one for all
Now you can pull the trigger
As we're knocking down on the wall
When you finally shoot too high
The lie will always bring it down
You resurrection angels,
Look what we found
That the wheel goes around
So here's to you!
Come on, raise the dead
Heads will roll
Cancel the infection
We can purify the soul
Do the crime
Then write the law
There's no wrong you can change it where
A change you've never saw
Hey, you desperation angels
Here we found
That they all fell down
So
Here's to me! Here's to you!
Here's to you! Here's to me!
Here's to reason!
Oh
Here's to me! Here's to you!
Raise the dead! Here's to freedom!
