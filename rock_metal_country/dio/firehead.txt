Who's that angry man I see
Is he coming closer
Well I'll just make believe
That I've never been afraid
Crackle, Crackle,
You're all dead
Feel the heat from firehead
>From spooky stories that he's read
They put pictures on his body
Living out a fantasy
To be the last one left alive, hah!
Crackle, Crackle,
You're all dead
Feel the heat from firehead
He's lost the instruction
No control
Suicide fever, he won't be much older
I know, won't go, away
What's that smoke that I can see
Rising from the ashes
Well, it seems that there will always be
Someone just like you
Crackle, Crackle,
And you're all dead
Feel the heat from firehead, firehead, firehead!
