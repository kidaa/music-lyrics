If you ever wake up, baby
Tired of running
If the stars you've been reaching for
Are no longer shining
And the moon makes you blue
You can call on me

For so many years now, darling
You've been walking that wire
Filling your emptiness
A slave to desire
When the dancing needs two
You can call on me

The things that I've said sometimes
Have cut you up
But with the truth in my heart
I could never give up now, baby
And you know wrong or right
You'll find
Life is uncertain, baby
One day you're alone
The party is over
Your friends have gone home
And you're feeling the fool
Baby call on me
And I'll be there for you baby
If it makes you feel blue
You can call on me
And no one's gonna hurt you baby
Whatever you do
You can call on me
Anywhere, anytime, baby
You can call on me
Call on me baby
Call on me baby

The things that I've said sometimes
Have cut you up
With the truth in my heart
I could never give up now, baby
And you know wrong or right
Some time
You can call on me
Call on me
Baby, call on me
