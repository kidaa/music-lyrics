You know the feeling
All alone you back to the wall
And all the doorways 
Are starting to close in front of you
No confusion
Oh no - it came in a spell
Found it in a wishing well
It's a matter of mind
You know you can be free forever
So the next time someone
Points a gun at you
Say Shoot Shoot
I don't care
Shoot Shoot
Hey someone
If your chains are heavy for you
Hey someone
Let it rain
While I show you the way
This could be your lucky day
It's a matter of mind
You know you can be free forever
So the next time someone
Points a gun at you say
Shoot Shoot
I don't care
Shoot Shoot
Shoot Shoot
Anywhere
Shoot Shoot
It's a matter of mind
You know you can be free forever
So the next time someone
Points a gun at you sa
Shoot Shoot
I don't care
Shoot Shoot
Shoot Shoot
Anywhere
Shoot Shoot
Shoot Shoot
