You said a single word
But no one really heard
Sometimes we scream alone
It's always worse at night
When darkness kills the light
We're in the danger zone
You wait with pounding heart
You know it's just the start
Cause you're Breathless, ready to burn
Breathless, willing to learn
Breathless, the circle still turns
You're Breathless
Living inside your mind
Who knows the things you'll find
There could be hell or rainbows
But it's a funny thing
The more you feel the sting
You're just a leaf that the wind blows
You've been this way before
One step and you're through the door
And you're Breathless, ready to burn
Breathless, the circle still turns
Breathless, willing to learn
You're Breathless
Repeat Verse 1
