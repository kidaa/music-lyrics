You'd start the fire
I'd fan the flames
We danced on a wire
Poison running in our veins
Who's to bleed and who's to blame

Blood and thunder
Quick on the draw
Putting me under
Broken dishes on the floor
Burning what we had adored

Well you can call the dogs off, baby
I don't hate you anymore

Always frowning, yeah!
Cursing and howling
Running battle
Drawing guns and crossing swords
Fighting cruel and hopeless wars

Well you can call the dogs off, baby
I don't hate you anymore
Yeah, we can bring the curtain down now, darling
I don't hate you anymore

And it ain't no good
No good fussing about it
No good fussing about it
Ain't just no good
No good fussing about it
No good fussing about it

You'd get suspicious
I'd try to explain
Bitter and vicious
I would strike at you with rage
Like a panther in a cage

You'd persecute me
I'd seek revenge
Always at each other
Counting faults and keeping scores
What was all that fighting for?

Well you can call the dogs off, baby
I don't hate you anymore
