This woman she knows
The story of heartbreak
Beneath the weight of day
She's seen the hate
On people's faces
Dark skin her only disgrace

She cries help me please
Lord help me please

Her children she taught them
How to be proud in the face
Of adversity
She gave them the love, respect and understanding
Showing them
The way to be free

Lord help her please
Lord help her please
Lord, please

She stands tall
High as a mountain
Her heart as deep as the sea
She's known hardship and sorrow
That brought her down on her knees

Lord help her please
Lord help her please
Lord help her please
Lord please
