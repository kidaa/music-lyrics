She heard this song before
Daddy's at the door
Just to say I love you
Please, please, don't let him in
Is it all beginning again tonight?
Somebody make it right!
I say: Give her the gun!
Look at him run away
Give her the gun
Before the next one comes along
And doesn't pay
He, dragged into the cold
Momma sold her soul
For one more ride to heaven
Please, someone let him in
Is it all beginning again tonight
Can anyone make it right?
I say: Give him the gun!
Look at her run away
Oh, give him the gun
Before the next one comes along
And doesn't pay
Simply unforgivable, destruction of the heart
Does anybody tell
Make yourself invisible
Be blinded by the light
We're hiding away, what would they say
Yeah
She played this song before
Daddy's at the door
Just to say hello, ahh
Now, in a different world
Is it all beginning again tonight
Oh, I got to make it right
I say: give her the gun
Look at him run away
Oh, give her the gun
Before the next one comes along
Give her the gun
Look at him falling down
Oh, give her the gun
Before the next one comes along
'Cause it goes round and round and round...
