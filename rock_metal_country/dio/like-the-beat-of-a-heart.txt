Tonight we run
We can hide in the dark
When the moon steals the light from the dying sun
Oh run
It's a better thing than we have ever done
There's a beast that lives inside you
And it's screaming to get out
Like the beat of a heart
Don't look behind
Cause a tear that never dies
Can only make you blind
You've got to try
Cause the future's never never gonna die
There's a beast that lives inside you
And it's screaming to get out
It's a storm that's never ending
It's a truth without a doubt
Tonight we run
We can hide in the dark
Till the moon steals the light from the sun
There's a beast that lives inside you
And it's screaming let me out
It's a storm that's never ending
It's a truth without a doubt
Love can be a whisper
But pain will always
Shout to you
Like the beat of a heart
Like the beat of a heart
Like the beat of a heart
Like the beat of a heart
