Dio/Robertson/Johansson
He's just an ordinary man
Never gonna live forever
So he takes it where he can
Too many nights without a day
For the sake of being clever
He almost lost his way
He always thought that he could fly
Till he was shot down from the sky
You can't walk on water - don't try
You can't walk on water - my my my
They say there's ice inside his veins
He's the man of a thousand faces
Silver spoons and golden chains
He thought his heart was made of steel
But it never started pounding
Till they strapped him to the wheel
He always thought that he could fly
Till he was shot down from the sky
No matter what you try
You can't walk on water - my my
Can't walk on water - don't let me try
Somebody said we'll make him strong
He can give us all the answers
Tell us right and show us wrong
If you believe it, it's no lie
And there is an end to summer
'Cause the winter makes it die
We never looked above his head
And so he missed the things that they said, yeah
He always thought that he could fly
Until they shot him from the sky
CHORUS:
No matter how you try
You can't walk on water
Can't burn the sun
You can't walk on water
Not anyone
You can't, you can't, you can't
You can't, you can't, walk on water
