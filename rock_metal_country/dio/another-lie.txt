She's a rumor in the night
It's crazy
You can see her but she isn't there
She's the stealer of the light
It's crazy
But you go anywhere
It was just a summer night
Maybe
When a shiver cut across the air
Should you run and get away
Maybe
To go where-where-where
She crouches the hunter
Ready to tell you
Another lie
Another lie
You could see the side of someday
Feel the power of the young and strong
You were learning how to fly someway
You were wrong-wrong-wrong
She jumped at the moment
A chance to tell you
Another lie
It was just a summer night
Maybe
When a shiver cut across the air
Should you run and get away
Maybe
To go where-where-where
She jumps at the moment
She crouches the hunter yeah
You look and you know she's telling you
Another lie
Another lie
Why it's crazy
When you feel you're getting stronger
Why it's crazy
All the lies are getting longer
Another lie
Another lie
