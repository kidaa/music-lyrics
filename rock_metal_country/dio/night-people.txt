Do you like the dark
Do you like the way it moves
Do you come alive when neon
Kills the sun
Are you hypnotized
Part of the illusion
Oh, see how they run
It's the mystery
Poetry and passion
Innocence and fashion
Revolution
Evolution ways
Night people
Are you satisfied
With the lessons that you're learning
Is the fire really burning
Do you know
Hey dream child
Promises are spoken
And promises are broken
Electric eyes that never let you
See them in the day
Night people
Night people
Do you like the dark
Do you like the way it moves
Do you come alive when neon
Kills the sunshine
Are you hypnotized
Innocence and fashion
Promises and passion
Evolution
Revolution ways
And everybody stays
Night people
Night people, yeah!
Do you like the dark
Do you like the way it moves
Are you hypnotized
Paralyzed
Revolution
Hey dream child
You got electric eyes
Hey dream child!
