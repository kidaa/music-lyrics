Rain falls
Thunder cracks the air
Lightning from the sky
Everywhere
Stars move
They're shakin' all the earth
Show you what you're worth
Here it comes
When a woman cries
Fire
Burning through your brain
Turn to face the train
Oh oh
Hey it's magic
Said the mother to the child
It's stronger than a smile
Let it go
When a woman cries
When a woman cries, ah
When a woman cries
When a woman cries, ah
Just when you think it's pretend
Here it comes over and over again
And if we should live forever
Maybe we'll still just never know
Oh, rain falls
Thunder cracks the air
Lightning from the sky
Everywhere
Stars move
Shakin' all the earth
Show you what you're worth
Here it comes
When a woman cries
Fire - magic
Shakin' all the earth
When a woman cries
Oh, stars move
Thunder cracks the air
Lightning from the sky
When a woman cries
When a woman cries, ah
When a woman cries, yeah
When a woman cries, ooh
