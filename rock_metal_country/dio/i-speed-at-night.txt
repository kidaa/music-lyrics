Dark touches send rushed through the brain
Black's whiter, burns brighter than the flame
No shadows, just whispers in the wind
No faces, just places to begin
I just come seeking pleasure, I hate the light
I speed at night, at night
My demons, they seem to disappear
No vision, I only see to hear
Protection, I never needed none
Direction, just nowhere near the sun
You've go some stairs to heaven, you may be right
I only know in my world, I hate the light
I speed at night
Repeat Verse 1
You've got some stair to heaven, you may be right
I only know in my world, I hate the light
I speed at night
