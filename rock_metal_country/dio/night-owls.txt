CHORUS:
See all the Night Owls when they gather
'neath the neon lights
They've been sleeping all day long,
now they come alive
See all the Nights Owls when they gather,
dressed up to the nines
They're out to party and
they'll keep it going 'til the morning light

Sundown girls are posing coolly,
looking so divine
Trying to excite and mystify
Sharing juicy secrets
'bout some man to hypnotise
Merry-making sisters, flashing smiles
that hold the sharpness of a knife

CHORUS

Heavy Boys are watching
from the corner of their eyes
Talking of some hero's latest crime
Then they leave the circle
one by one, once in a while
If you want to keep it going
'aint it time that we all had another line

CHORUS

Blue-eyed boy
is taking Cinderella for a ride
Promising a glimpse of paradise
Come into my parlour,
says the spider to the fly
We'll fake the game of passion and
ward off all the nonsense in our lives

'Til the morning light!
