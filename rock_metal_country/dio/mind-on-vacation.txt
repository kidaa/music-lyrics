You're sitting here yakkin'
Right in my face
Guess I'm gonna have to
Put you back in your place
If silence was golden
Boy, you couldn't raise a dime

'Cause your mind is on vacation
And your mouth is working overtime

You're quoting figures
You're dropping names
You're telling stories
All about the dames
You're overlaughing
When things ain't funny
You're trying to sound
Like a whole lot of money
If talk was criminal
You'd be leading a life of crime

'Cause your mind is on vacation
And your mouth is working way overtime

Now life is short
And talk is cheap
Don't go round making promises
You'll never keep
If you don't like the song I'm singing
You gotta grin and bear it
All I can say is
If the shoe fits, honey
You wear it
If you gotta keep on talkin'
Honey please, make it rhyme

'Cause your mind is on vacation
And your mouth is working way overtime
