In the land of the lost horizon
Where the queen lies dark and cold
When the stars won't shine, then the story's told
When the world was milk and honey
And the magic was strong and true
Then the strange ones came and the people knew
That the chains are on
In the land of no tomorrow
Where you pray just to end each day
And your life just slowly melts away
Each day you hear the sand as it moves and whispers
Come and sail on my golden sea
Maybe one day you'll be just like me...and that's free
But still your chains are on
You've seen them walking on the water
You've seen flying through the sky
They were frightening in the darkness
They had rainbows in their eyes
Whe the world was milk and honey
And the magic was strong and true
The the strange ones came and the people knew
That the chains are on
