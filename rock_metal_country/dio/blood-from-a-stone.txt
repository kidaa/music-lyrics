Oh, you've been surprised again
Pulled like a leaf to the waterfall
Everybody's just pretending
I thought that you'd learn by now
Ooh, think about it one more time
What have you got when the god is gone
Clouds don't have a silver lining
And all you ever get is rain
'Cause you can't get blood from a stone
You can't open the door if there's nobody home
They've taken it all so just leave me alone
You can't get blood from a stone
It isn't once upon a time
When nobody falls and the hero flies
That victims got to fit the crime
And nobody goes down with you
You, you!
'Cause you can't get blood from a stone
You can't open the door if there's nobody home
They've taken it all so just leave me alone
You can't get blood from a stone
No, no
'Cause you can't get blood from a stone
You can't open the door if there's nobody home
They've taken it all so just leave me alone
No, you can't get blood from a stone
No blood from a stone
Go on and leave me alone
And I know it's a shock
To learn that you can't
You can't, you can't get blood from a rock
