Dio/Robertson
She never breaks into the conversation
He seems to be the reason why she lives
She tries to be the perfect kind of stranger
But we always seem to love the most
The ones who never give, yeah
CHORUS:
It's between two hearts
A personal situation
Between two hearts
The kind of love with a reputation
We never have to ask her why she's crying
The smile she had's been kicked into a frown
But still it makes her day to be his pleasure
Should we open up her eyes
Can we ever break the spell
No one can tell
CHORUS:
It's between two hearts
A personal combination
Between too hearts
The kind of love with a bad reputation
Put on your party faces and come along
Join in the big parade
Here comes the camera
Do you look as good as your sister
Smile at the animals
They should be the ones in the cages
Turn the pages
Another way to spend a rainy Sunday
Waiting for a call that never comes
The mystery is how she makes her choices
But don't we always choose
The ones who hide the sun
Everyone
CHORUS:
It's between two hearts
Love and desperation
Between two hearts
The kind of love
The kind of love
Between two hearts
A personal situation
Between two hearts
The kind of love with a reputation
