Ronnie James Dio, 1987
Seems like heard this song
At least a thousand times before
He just wanted her but she wants more
So build a wall
Keep it all to herself, ooh
Always never seemed to be too much
Reaching out became a spider's touch
Wrapped in chains
Sad remains
Another victim of
Overlove
Overlove
He was just the devil in a thing disquise
Jealousy behind the greenest eyes
Turn the page
Close the cage
On another victim of
Overlove
Overlove, yeah
Overlove
Overlove
Overlove
Overlove
Mamma never left her baby all alone
Baby never knew when she was grown
Now mamma's gone
And come the dawn
You got another victim of
Overlove
Overlove
Overlove
Overlove, love, love, love, love
Overlove
