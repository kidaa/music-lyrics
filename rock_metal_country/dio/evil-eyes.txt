Hide in the midnight
Turn out the lights, you'll see them anyway
Sail into never, they'll follow wherever you can go
And take you to the places you don't know
It's the call of the city
The way that black's pretty to the purest heart
It's places of pleasure
They promise you treasure if you fly
And then there goes the soul of you and I
Oh do you ever think about
The way I caught the rainbow
I'll be there where fire makes you dance
I'm gonna give you the look
That opens up the skies
I've got Evil Eyes...
Hide in the midnight
Turn out the light, they'll see you anyway
Sail into never, they'll follow wherever you can go
I've got Evil Eyes...
