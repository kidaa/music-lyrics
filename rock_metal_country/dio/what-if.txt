Sometimes, I don't understand
Feels like, I'm living in a world gone mad
Look around, all around it's just the same
People, need love everywhere
Why don't we, ever take the time to care
We're the fools
We're the losers in this game
Where is the tenderness
We've sacrificed to success
Why do some live in greed
While some die in hunger?

CHORUS:
What if everybody, what if everybody
Spoke up with one voice
What if everybody, what if everybody
Cried out with one heart
What if we could change things?

What if everybody, what if everybody
Reached out with one hand
What if everybody, what if everybody
Tried to make that stand
What if we could change things?

Somehow we're blinded and lost
Reap the gains but don't wanna pay the costs
Ain't it time
To find a way to break our chains somehow

Is there a price to pay
To make it better?

CHORUS

Deep down inside
We all want the same
We can make it better
We can make it better
If we try together

CHORUS
