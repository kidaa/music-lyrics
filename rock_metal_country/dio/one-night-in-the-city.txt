Johnny was a dark child
He was promised to us all
But rides in the night, can lift you out of sight
When they call
Sally was a princess
She was chosen for the crown
But chains can't stop the sound
Of one night in the city
One night looking pretty
The someone opened doorways
And Johnny slipped away
Running for the bright, where dark is always light
But there's no day
The princess saw the dark child
And the dark child said her name
Come steal away, we'll play the game
Do you watch, do you see, do you know the people in me
I'm the bite, I'm the bark, I'm the scream
Are you poor, are you sure, are you holy, are you pure
I can tell you tales you just might not believe
One night in the city, one night looking pretty
One night in the city, one night looking pretty
The children shared the wonder
Of the leather and the lace
But one child went away, and one child stayed to play
For one night in the city
