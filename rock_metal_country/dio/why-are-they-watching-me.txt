D/R
He was ready to rock and roll
So ready to lose control
But when a hungry heart
Gets a taste of freedom - you better look out
He was ready to push and shove
Ready to fight for love
But I've seen it before
And it can make you crazy
The eyes are what you see
CHORUS:
Why are they watching me
She was ready to black and white
The colors were just too bright
She loved to fly
But she hated falling
She was caught in the in-between
Her dirty would not come clean
She ran for light
But she just got darkness
Just when you think you're free
The eyes are what you see
CHORUS:
Why are they watching me
Why do they do the things they do
Why are they watching me
Watching you
If only the eyes could see
Then you'd know your destiny
The mind is an enemy
And you just need a friend
Are you ready for rock and roll
Ready to take control
If you see the eyes
Will it make you crazy - crazy
Crazy
CHORUS
