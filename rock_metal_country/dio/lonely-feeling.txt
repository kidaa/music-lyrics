What a lonely feeling
When you're waking in the morning
Your mind in a haze
This lonely feeling
When you're reeling in the evening

I don't know, how long
This is gonna keep on going on
I don't know, how long
This is gonna keep on going on

What a lonely feeling
When you're given up believing
Lost in a maze
This lonely feeling
When your heart and soul is yearning

I don't know, how long
This is gonna keep on going onv I don't know, how long
This is gonna keep on going on

Got to keep on going
Got to keep on going
Got to keep on going
Got to keep on going on x 2

Baby, what are we gonna do
Me and you?
Baby, where will it lead us to
Me and you?

This lonely feeling
When you're reeling in the evening

I don't know, how long
This is gonna keep on going on
I don't know, how long
This is gonna keep on going on

Got to keep on going
Got to keep on going
Got to keep on going
Got to keep on going on x 2
