Can you hear me
Can you see
There's a storm on the edge of the sky
Does it matter
It does to me, I can tell you why
When there's thunder, there should be rain
But it don't always follow the rule
And is the wise man always right? No he can play the fool
It's always a Mystery, not what it seems to be
It's always a Mystery, just like you and me
We are lightning
We are flame
And we burn at the touch of a spark
If there's fire, but no one sees
The there's only the dark
Just imagine, will you try
I can see that you've opened your mind
Silver linings can disappear, but they always shine
It's always a Mystery, not what it seems to be
It's always a Mystery, just like you and me
Chorus Out
