Call him anything you can
A sinner or a saint
Call him a boozer
A winner or a loser
He's still a man

He may be proud
He may be vain
An emperor or a slave
He may be a leader
A liar and a cheater
He's still a man

He may be pulling on the chains
Of power and of fame
He may have lost his dreams
He may have lost his faith
Fearful or brave
He'll meet his fate one day

Call him anything you can
A traitor or a friend
Call him a hero
A nothing or a zero
He's still a man

He may be pulling on the chains
Of power and of fame
He may have lost his dreams
He may have lost his faith
Fearful or brave
He'll meet his fate one day

Call him anything you can
A traitor or a friend
Call him a hero
A nothing or a zero
He's still a man

Call him a hero
A nothing or a zero
He's still a man

He's still a man
Who does the best he can
He's just a man
He's nothing but a man
