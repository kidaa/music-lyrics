Ronnie James Dio, 1987
Two faces
On fire
No traces
Something has swallowed the night
You know that nothing can make it all right
Yeah
Like candy
Emotion
Too much and sugar can turn to sand
You scream but nobody touches your hand
Are we just shouting at the pain
Or do we see just what we are
We're naked in the rain
Naked in the rain
Two children
Guns loaded
Take aim and blow all the dreams away
Too late for anything better to say
Hey
Are we just crazy with the pain
Or do we see just what we are
We are naked in the rain
Naked in the rain
Two faces
No fire
No traces, fever has turned to snow
Hearts break to show you the way as you go, ooh
Are we just running from the pain
Or do we see just what we are
We're naked in the rain
Naked in the rain
Naked in the rain
Naked in the rain
Two children
On fire
Emotion
Burns higher
Guns loaded
Blow all the dreams away
Naked in the rain
Naked in the rain
Frighten by the pain
Naked in the rain
