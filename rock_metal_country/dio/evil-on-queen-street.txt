Dio/Robertson/Cook
Spent the night on the road
And never saw the miles go
Running away
I've got to get free from myself
How stories were made to be told
And here's the one that I know
I can't hide it anymore
There's evil on Queen Street
I saw the house in the dark
It seemed to say "come touch me
I've got a heart
Open the door to my soul"
Climb to the top of my stairs
And look into my windows
I can be your wishing well
There's no evil on Queen Street
Let me in
I can warm in the heat of your fire
It's no permanent sin to be bad
If you're sorry
Let me go - you're a promise that comes from a liar
I don't know - if I ever can wash all the evil away, hey
Struck a match at the dark
It screamed no, no I love you
Together we're strong
You always believed what I'd say, hey
But now the heat of a flame
Starts me to remember
There's no evil - no more evil
No evil on Queen Street
Just smoke in the air
No evil anywhere
No evil on Queen Street
