Boy, you know I heard you talking in your sleep
If I only knew you better
I'd chase away the demons from your dreams
Make them disappear forever

CHORUS:
I wanna get to you
I'm gonna find a way
I wanna get to you
'Cos I care for you
I care for you
I wanna get to you
Every night I pray
I wanna get to you
'Cos I care for you
I really do

In your arms when you're lying next to me
There's so much we can discover
If you put your trust in me you'll see
I will love you like no other

CHORUS

Ain't nobody gonna take me away from you
Ain't nobody gonna take me away x 2

I can feel the pain in you goes deep
Don't pretend it doesn't matter
I'm not afraid to face reality
Let us walk that road together

CHORUS

Ain't nobody gonna take me away from you
Ain't nobody gonna take me away x 2
