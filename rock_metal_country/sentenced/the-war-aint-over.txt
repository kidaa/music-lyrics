music: Tenkula & SENTENCED, words: Jarwa
...hear the sounds of Thunder
feel it come in all its pride.
- and it's all yours!
this tension, this pressure...
sweat and feel the air too thick to breathe!
feel hatred, fear hatred...
wait the chaos that shall breed
- the spawn of WAR!
- the spawn of MAN!
- inside of us all - oh yes! you too...

live in this hell - die in this hell.

Hey! the Beast of War is on the hunt!
the Dove of Peace falls torn apart!
- disillusion!
well, Hey now! What did you expect to see?
the "victory of humanity"?
well, THE WAR AIN'T OVER!!!

"I remember all the hopes I remember all lies
I am "die Erd", I've seen it come and go and stay eternally! WAR!"

live in this hell - so what the hell,
- so let it be,
- die in this hell.

Hey! the Beast of War is on the hunt!
the Dove of Peace falls torn apart!
- disillusion!
well, Hey now! What did you expect to see?
the "victory of humanity"?
well, THE WAR AIN'T OVER!!!

no! Never! Ever! no!
so let it be.
