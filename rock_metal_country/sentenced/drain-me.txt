Always pretending to want you
It's so easy to make you play my game
Always deceiving to get you
So goddamn easy to make you scream my name
No remorse, no repent
Still to you I'm heaven-sent

I don't need a reason to hate you
I don't need a reason to brake you
Just keep that mouth wide open and drain me, my darling
I don't need to care if you want me
I don't need to care if you need me
Just spread that pink wide smile and drain me, my darling

For so many years I've been faking
It's so hard to keep lying and smiling in vain
For so many years I've been taking
Innocence soiled, hey babe, your loss is my gain
No remorse, no repent
Still to you I'm heaven-sent

I don't need a reason to hate you
I don't need a reason to brake you
Just keep that mouth wide open and drain me, my darling
I don't need to care if you want me
I don't need to care if you need me
Just spread that pink wide smile and drain me, my darling
