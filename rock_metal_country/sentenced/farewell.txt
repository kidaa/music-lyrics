music: Laihiala & SENTENCED, lyrics: Laihiala
I've dragged myself through the blood and mud
and with burning eyes pushed the love away'
No, I'm not the kind of man who'd play for keeps'
-The enchantment lies in the moment of goodbyes
For eternity'
-My sun has set down
I dream to flee'
As I suffer "the black" bleed into me
I regret every single day I ever lived in my life
I gave all I had in me' So it's time to say Goodbye
The breath of wind beneath my beating wings
is slowly dying down'
-Yet raging it's final blow!
As it crumbles down' my castle in the air
The relieving words of farewell end my earthly Hell
For eternity'
-My sun has set down
It has ceased to be'
The lightning that once burned in me
I regret every single day I ever lived in my life
