music: Tenkula, Lopakka & SENTENCED, lyrics: Lopakka & Korhonen
Your senseless theories
are rising once again
Causing pain within my mind
- I'm losing the control

But in the kingdom to come
Behind the seven seas...
Beyond the distant valleys...
It's me who decides!!

Your flaming thoughts...
...are tearing my soul apart!
I'm harvesting...
...the sow of your curse again!

You've destined me to suffer...
...as you were the master!
You've taken my inner self...
Confusion will rule till I die!!!
