music: Tenkula & SENTENCED, lyrics: Lopakka
now every single cloud becomes a raging storm
as I go seeking for the one I used to live for'
since your love was taken away
my heart's been beating empty beats
well, it will end tonight'
-the blade shall set me free
a steady hand with this sharpened cold steel
will help me wipe away this pain that I feel
the rain comes falling down
my life flows to the ground
no longer feeling the pain
my flame now fading away
the rain comes falling down
my life flows to the ground
no longer feeling the pain
my flame now fading away
so here I'm lying on these dead and bloody autumn leaves
waiting for death to take me where I want to be'
a steady hand with this sharpened hard steel
will help me wipe away this agony I feel
the rain comes falling down
my life flows to the ground
no longer feeling the pain
my flame now fading away
the rain comes falling down
my life flows to the ground
no longer feeling the pain
these leaves now becoming my grave
no longer feeling the flame
no longer feeling the rain
