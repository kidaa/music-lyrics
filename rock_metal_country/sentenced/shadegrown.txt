music: Tenkula & Sentenced, lyrics: Lopakka
I have dwelled in the dark
so long that I have become the night
Here only the chilling Northwind
can give warmth to my life

There comes the morning light and brings the pain
...slashing my heart
It goes by slowly and makes the pain last forever
...it tears me apart

I'm drowning in this light
I'm dying, it's so bright
I have lived in the shades
- Make the Glow go away

Come cast your shadow over me
and I'll cast mine all over thee
Take me away, into the shades
where there is no light of day
to harm my way

Come with me and we'll flee from this world
across the nightly sky
Believe me, you'll be free
as we take our ride on the darksideI'm drowning in this light
I'm dying, it's so bright
I have lived in the shades
- Make the Glow go away

Come cast your shadow over me
and I'll cast mine all over thee
Take me away, into the shades
where there is no light of day

Come cast your shadow over me
I'll give you immortality
Let's walk away, into the shades
where there is no light of day

To Harm Our Way
