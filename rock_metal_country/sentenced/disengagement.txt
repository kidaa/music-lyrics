music: Tenkula, Lopakka & SENTENCED, lyrics: Lopakka
Darkness fills the life
Covers the tired mind
like the darkest damnation
anxiety, oppression

a wounded soul
manages to escape
from exhausted body,
from the bleeding prison
disengagement, dark visions,
forgotten personality

feeling of loss
nocturnal suffocation
tears like blood
stench of decayed

alone...
without a body
life...
is turned to hellliving in emptiness
torture of the timeless
into the black pieces
of total chaos and sorrow

No blessing
no chances to survive
leads the way
to infernal death
disengagement, dark visions
forgotten personalities

verse III
