What is it that we're struggling for?
I don't quite see it anymore
Life kicks us in the teeth
Yet something makes us crawl back for more...

Blood and tears upon the altars of our lives we shed
Blood and tears until the sweet release we share in death
Hours like days, weeks feel like years
Decades of Tears
Yet somehow...

We'll lose the things we're fighted for
Each rise is followed by a fall
We'll lose the ones we love, the ones we most adore
Yet go on...We go on

Blood and tears upon the altars of our lives we shed
Blood and tears until the sweet release we share in death
Hours like days, weeks feel like years
Decades of Tears
Yet somehow everything seems so worthwhile
For a moment...for a moment...

What is it that we're waiting for?
Looking forward to, preparing for?
Like kicks us in the teeth
Yet something makes us crawl back for more...

Blood and tears upon the altars of our lives we shed
Blood and tears until the sweet release we share in death
Hours like days, weeks feel like years
Decades of Tears
Yet somehow
Blood and tears upon the altars of our lives we shed
Blood and tears until the sweet release we share in death
Hours like days, weeks feel like years
Decades of Tears
Yet somehow everything seems so worthwhile
For a moment everything seems so worthwhile
For a moment...for a moment...
