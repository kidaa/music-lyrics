5:49
Frozen soil... A dim moonlight
I've been... this glorious rid
Raise the arms in victory
I've seen... on this glorious night

I've kept my eyes open wide
Through my dream I was given a hint:
My sky is darker than yours, my star is brighter than yours
A glance to the moonlight shadow reveals the runes of yesterday
I am of Astral Strain, my sky is darker than thine

Die... die... die!
I... I... I... despite
Destroy!

The goals I've set to myself are far beyond mortality
To dominate, desolate everything weak that cannot stand alone

And losers shall drop...
One after one...

I am before all gods
Who art thou to come to me?
You are the great pretender
And you will always be
so die

Frozen time... The astral gate
I've been before on this ground
Open wide before my eyes
I see... on this glorious ride

Now I know...
It was written in the stars that I am the Wrathchild
I laugh as you cry

I am the one who laughs as you cry...
I am the one who laughs for last and laughs forever more

The goals I've set to myself are far beyond humanity
To dominate, desolate everything - I'm heading to immortality!

And losers shall drop...
One after one...
I WON!!!
