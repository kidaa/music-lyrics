In the dark... in death
Eyes can't see... I cannot feel
No voices... no light... no existence
A dreamlike void surrounds me

silence... emptiness...
peace of mind... in death

In emptiness...
I focus mt thoughts on my life
In death I have the time to think of the pastSolitude...
won't break my peace of mind
Because here I must dwell eternally

In memoriam...
For the one that once was me
Entombed remains
A gravestone marks I've passed away...
Sacred... to the memory of myself
