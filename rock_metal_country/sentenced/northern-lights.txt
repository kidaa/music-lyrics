5:17
At the dawn...
The golden moon was shining bright
With the silvery eyes of death

They had seen me salute the flames in the sky

...Northern lights...
...Northern lights...
While you were asleep I was awake to be part of the dark
While you were asleep I was awake to find the truth I had sought for
...through all my life...

Taken by the North wind blow
Into the icy abyss of colours
As I fulfilled my true self
I know your world is not for me

I am not one of them...

Aurora Borealis -
A part of me still in the sky

In the light of the golden moon
In the light of the silvery eyes of the night

I wandered through fire through ice...
To the valley of the shadow of death

...Northern lights...
be part of the dark
While you were asleep I was awake to find the truth I had sought for
...through all my life...

Aurora Borealis -
A part of me still in the sky
