music: Tenkula & SENTENCED, lyrics: Lopakka
Into the life after death
where all is said and done
where sanity is forgotten
where humanity is gone

Into the abyss I fall
Arising Evil is all I see
I hear a blasphemic call
the Touch of Death is all I feel

Rotting Ways to Misery
the earth is burning under my feet

"Sacrifice your soul for me
Against our common enemy... god"Behind the depths of dying
He is whipping my skin
This is the End... of liberty
I am in the fires of evilness

Hell's gates were open for me
they were my destiny
anyone can be chosen
to be His slave

Rotting Ways to Misery
are the chosen one's infernal destiny
