music: Tenkula & SENTENCED, lyrics: Lopakka
I have come a long way where I started from
but I'm still not even close to where I'm going
and now I can no longer see the shine
that has been lighting up my way
I cannot feel its glowing

The fire in my heart is dying
and the zeal I had is gone

This path that I've chosen's a rocky one
Long, hard and frozen it has become
Each turn that I've taken on the way
has only led me back to Hell
I am dying down growing weaker now
It could seem that I'm doing fine
but I'm broken to little pieces deep insideWhy did I ever choose to go this way
The question I keep asking myself all the time
I guess it was my instinct for self-destruction
that pointed me down this way

The fire in my eyes is dying
and the dream I had is gone

This path that I've chosen's a rocky one
Long, hard and frozen it has become
Each turn that I've taken on the way
has only led me back to Hell
I am dying down growing weaker now
It could seem that I'm doing fine
but I'm broken to little pieces deep inside
