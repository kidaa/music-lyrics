music: Tenkula & SENTENCED, lyrics: Lopakka
Again the sky has fallen down on me
Once more a world has crumbled down and over me

And yet in some twisted way
I enjoy my misery
And in some strange way
I have grown together with my agony

I feel home in despair for I dwell in grief
and I feel home when the air's too thick to breathe
and I feel home anywhere human lives are going down the drain

For as long as I remember life has been hard
I guess they have "misery" written somewhere in my stars

For I have mourned for so damn long
that I've forgotten what it was for
Everything has gone so wrong
that I really couldn't think of anything more

I feel home in despair for I dwell in grief
and I feel home when the air's too thick to breathe
and I feel home anywhere human lives are flowing down the drain

I feel home in despair for I dwell in grief
and I feel home when the air's too thick to breathe
and I feel home anywhere the light of day is drowned in heavy rain

Yet I know the worst is still to come
