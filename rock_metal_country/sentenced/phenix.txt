music: Tenkula & SENTENCED, defiance: Teiwaz
burned alive in the flames of love
- the ashes scattered in the wind
fucked up by the unholy trinity;
you, me and our "perfect law"
our perfect love

each time I walk under a moonlit sky
- each time I dream of you
"Death won't tear us 'part but lack of love"
kill all gods and all mother-lovin whores
- my heart is built for War
yet one precious treasure is lost forever more

Fenix, Rising
Fenix...is rising high!

born again in the name of War
born to fight and built to last
from the ashes of our perfect love...
watch me now! I'll be complete!!!

each time I swim in your starry eyes
- each time I drown with you
"Death won't tear us 'part but lack of love"
well, kill your god and your mothafuckin' - Horse
- now Fenix is stronger than ever!
one precious treasure is lost forever more

Fenix, Rising
Fenix...is rising high!

born again in the name of War
born to fight and built to last
from the ashes of our perfect love...
would you die for me like I died for you! huh!
Fenix is rising in the name of War
holding a silver sword upon his mighty head, swearing revenge to
all his enemies - rock 'n roll is the only way to die!!!
watch me riding from our perfect love
watch me now! I'll be complete...
