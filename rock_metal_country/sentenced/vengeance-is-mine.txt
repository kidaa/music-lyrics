I am stunned, you caught me by surprise
It's so damn wrong, you outdid yourselves
Beaten numb, I didn't see you sneaking round the corner, how could I?
There is no sight in my third eye

When I'm done I will hunt you down
One by one I'll blow you all to hell
For you faceless, nameless, cowards, cannot hide
The day of reckoning will arrive

Strike from behind and knock me to the ground
Kick me while I'm down, stab me in the back, you bastards
Tear my heart out of my chest
I rise from the ashes, from these ruins of mine, from the rage
I'm right on your track you bastards
Dozen of eyes for an eye
Vengeance is mine

I have dreams of hammering your skulls
Fantasies of bashing in your brains
Obsessively I am watching, I am stalking, I am following
And then the massacre begins

Strike from behind and knock me to the ground
Kick me while I'm down, stab me in the back, you bastards
Tear my heart out of my chest
I rise from the ashes, from these ruins of mine, from the rage
I'm right on your track, you bastards
Dozen of eyes for an eye
Vengeance is mine

Strike from behind and knock me to the ground
Kick me while I'm down, stab me in the back, you bastards
Tear my heart out of my chest
I rise from the ashes, from these ruins of mine, from the rage
I'm right on your track you bastards
Dozen of eyes for an eye
Vengeance is mine
Dozen of eyes for an eye
Vengeance is mine
Vengeance is mine
