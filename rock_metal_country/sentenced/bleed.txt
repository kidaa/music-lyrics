music: Tenkula & Sentenced, lyrics: Lopakka
Burnt all bridges I have passed
No looking back to the life I once had...
- The hate for myself is all that's left now

"As blood runs down my arms
I feel peace in my heart..."

On my skin, the razor blade is shining bright
The veins show clearly through, my blood is running wild
The deep red flowing within, longing to be free
A little pressure's all it takes to make me bleed...to death
