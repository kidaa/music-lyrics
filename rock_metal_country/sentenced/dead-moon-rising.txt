music: Lopakka/SENTENCED, lyrics: Lopakka
The darkness comes out of her shell
Yet another cold night in Hell with all the pain
The dying light is losing its glow
And my last glimmer of hope now fades away

It is starting to rain again
I'm coming closer to my end with every breath
The creepy shadows are growing pale
And the rising glow brings along the sense of death

I can feel Her presence now

Dead Moon Rising
Bleeding red light over the sea
-I hope this time She came for me
-I hope this time She sets me freeMy wounds are open wide
The freezing wind blows right inside and feels like ice
The eerie glow fires up the sky
And She takes away my sight with Her shine

I can feel Her all around

Dead Moon Rising
Bleeding dead light over the sea
-I hope this time She came for me
-I hope this time She sets me free

Dead Moon Rising
Bleeding dead light over the sea
-I hope this time She came for me
-I hope this time She sets me free
