music: Tenkula & SENTENCED, lyrics: Jarva
First came the wind, dark clouds and the storm
Then came the snow which covered the ground white

We saw them descending from clouds
from the Bloodred Sky
We just stood there and watched
as they came, saw and conquered

This beautiful sight
made us blind
with joy we welcomed the intruder
as immigrants for their dominionlike an epidemic Virus
that spread over our homes
It came like a cold wind
and took away everything

In the ruins we stood
with the living ones
We saw them raping our women
and killing our children

verse IV
