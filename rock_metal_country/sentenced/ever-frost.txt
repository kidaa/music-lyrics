The accusations and the blame
True or false, they seem the same
Filthy fingers, rising rose
And out of shit a flower grows
I'm amazed how damn low
People can go only by being themselves

Those with hearts of Ever-frost
Always know we never lost
Flames rose high...
Not enough to melt the ice
Tiny minds and virtuous whores
Bunch of morons with a cause
"Jesus saves?" - We will piss upon your graves

Three wise men came to the north
On they donkeys they rode forth
Whining I'd committed sins
Moaning I'm to everything
Still amazed how our whole trio on link
Can have only two brain cells

Those with hearts of Ever-frost
Always knowing ever lost
Acid rain, urine on your flames
Urine on your flames

Those with hearts of Ever-frost
Always know we never lost
Flames rose high...
Not enough to melt the ice
Tiny minds and virtuous whores
Bunch of morons with a cause
"Jesus saves?" - We will piss upon your graves

Placid rain, urine on your graves
