The candles have been blown out by the wind

don't be scared, my love, I'm right by your side
I still remember the times I walked alone...dead
until you woke me up and made me come alive
With her love she feeds the fire in my heart
And in her eyes, oh the birth of stars
The sun won't shine on me without your love
...don't you know
The cold wind kills the flame in my heart
...by its blow

She gave me everything I had craved
through the years of pain
the years of pain

With her love she feeds the fire in my heart
Oh she's my only light
In the dark

The sun won't shine on me without your love
...don't you know
The cold wind kills the flame in my heart
...by its blow
