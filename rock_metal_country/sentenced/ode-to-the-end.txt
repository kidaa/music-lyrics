Looking down through clouds of iron
at the shattered remains of the world
New bays on coasts, new land in the sea
Deserts of ash... on Death Row Earth

Open your eyes to realize...
Your source of life exists no more
Pale obsolete is the whole of me
but yet I feel more than ever before

So came our time - the time that lasts forever
and through the death we frolic endlessly
Too many years of pain and sorrow
I hope my life leaves me be... dead

Emotions which I kept are no longer in my head
'cause all the words I said, they showed...
I was dying to be dead

Close your eyes to see why the dark desire
tempts my soul, oh my friend
Come, listen to my mind and feel the fire
This is the Ode to the End

Don't hold your sight - I know there's no heaven
...I believe we all have our personal Hell
and don't be scared, take death with open arms
