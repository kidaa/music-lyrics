6:37
Fire...
Fire... thou of forces the mightiest
Flame... thou of wisdom the greatest
Come forth for thou art needed
Come... I was marked for thee

It was written in the runes crowned in the sands of time
It was whispered from behind the walls of the ancient wind
...The Capture of Fire fulfills thy desire

Oh, hear the words!

Unleash the flame us all to reign
On this victorious ride us all to guide

...And we shall...

Set the world on Fire
Set free the mighty Flame
Let loose the greatest, Blaze
Laugh as our enemies fall

Fire... thou of forces the mighti
Flame... thou of wisdom the greatest
forth for thou art needed
Come... we are marked for thee

Kiss the hidden words...
The words of the ancient wisdom
Piss upon the graves where thy enemies are laid
