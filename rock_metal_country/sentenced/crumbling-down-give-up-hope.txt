music: Tenkula & Sentenced, lyrics: Lopakka
Like roses wither so does hope
as we approach our final fate
A new dawn of man?
Oh no, can't you feel, the End is on its way...

It's all over, said and done, haven't you heard?
We are living our last days in this world
Oh, Give Up Hope, do it now
the world is coming Crumbling Down

we have passed
the point of No Return by far
and swept away the last sheds of hope
A new dawn of man?
Oh no, can't you feel, the End is on its way...

It's all over, said and done, haven't you heard?
We are living our last days on this earth
Oh, your days are over!
Your world is finished!Down down down down
Thy kingdom gone
Down down down down
My kingdom come

This is it
This is the End

Free at last
