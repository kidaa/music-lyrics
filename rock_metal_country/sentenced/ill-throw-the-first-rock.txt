I could hear them speaking of those
"Good Old Days" that never were
Those hollow containers for souls
who no longer live there...
It dwells in my heart, the eternal hate
To get your share just wait and see

There are no strangers in this world
only bastards I haven't met
...and my skeptic way of thinking

turns away the joys they shed
It dwells in my heart, the eternal rage
And now I'll blast it on your face!

I'll throw the First Rock
- Blacken your world and your sun

I'll throw the First Rock
I'll throw the first one
You'll crumble to the ground
