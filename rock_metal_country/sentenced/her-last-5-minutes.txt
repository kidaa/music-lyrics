Must have been a week
Since she drew the curtains down
I don't know if it's night or day
And I don't care
Our hope seems so bleak
But she's pulling through somehow
While I'm trembling in dismay, in despair

I can see you're scared and tired of all this
I can see the torment, the damage it has done
Still we both know what the other alternative is
Not yet, the only one

The good moments are breezed
And there's nothing I can do
When it comes onto her again
And does it worse

She shivers like a leaf
As the waves of pain heave through
The ruthless bringer of the end
Fears, preserved

I can see you're scared and tired of all this
I can see the torment, the damage she has done
Still we both know what the other alternative is
Not yet, the only one

Don't go yet, don't yet go
Not yet, my only one
Don't go yet, I can't let go
Not yet, my only one

"I can't stop the light from flaming the curtains white."
