All these years I've spent fighting the fight
winning my war, showing my might
It was clear to me all the time...
- There's no battle like that of life

Give me War!
I will give you Hell!

I'm the Warrior of Life, I know the Reaper by name
I was born one foot in grave

I'm the Warrior of Life and my blood's running cold
I see pain wherever I go
I've stood up everyone and everything
and walked against the wind
So it is and so it will be
It is the only way... for me
