music: Tenkula & SENTENCED, lyrics: Lopakka
Yet another morning
that feels like this
Yet another life's bitter kiss

It has been like this for I don't know how long
I only know that at some point
it all went wrong

I don't remember much from last night
but still far more than I would like to

I'm floating downstream that damned river again

What can I do now except continue
and open a bottle once more
What can I do now except see this through
and float with the stream, off the shore
- see where the river will take me

When I needed you, you weren't there
now I need booze like I need the air that I breathe

With each drink I'm drifting further away from your world
the further off I get the harder it will be to return

It has been like this for I don't know how long
I only know that at some point
it all went wrong

Floating downstream that damned river again
The river that's distilled from premium grain

What can I do now except continue
and open a bottle once more
What can I do now except see this through
and float with the stream, off the shore
- see where the river will take me
- see where the river will take me
