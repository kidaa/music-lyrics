music: Lopakka & SENTENCED, words: Lopakka
"EVERYMAN, I will go with thee and be thy guide
in thy most need to go by thy side"

grave - home of the brave?

fire...dance with me
for there's time for me and there's time for thee
desire ...rise, my friend
dance with me all the way
then descend

I wake up in the trench
and what a shitty world this is to wake up in...
our troops are only here and there
but the enemy is everywhere

will you be by me?

in the crimson moonlight
the battle is raging at its height
there...somewhere...I bleed and scream
take me over the stream - to my dream

if there's a heaven for the heathen
we'll gather our hearts in the kingdom of gods
and honour grows upon the graves of those
who were put through Hell in the line of fire

will you be by me?
love remainsfire...dance with me
when it's time to scream and when it's time to dream
higher...rise, my friend
dance with me all the way - to the end

lost in the Night Frost
forever lost

the night is still breathing
but I'll pass away, the Flame has ceased
as the others keep on hunting
I'm taken away by the silky breeze...

so if there's a heaven for the heathen
we'll gather our hearts in the kingdom of gods
and silence grows high where the soldiers lie
those who feared no evil and those who did

now set me on
fire...take me high
when it's time to fly and when it's time to die
higher...rise, my friend
dance with me all the way - to the end

lost in the Night Frost
forever lost

...to the end...
