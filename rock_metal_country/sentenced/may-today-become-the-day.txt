"They call themselves my brothers. For me they're just the others."

Rain drums the lifeless ground
Drops as cold as ice
The dawn's breaking, the trench a-shaking...
Their fire hits us all around
And the siren cries
"Forward! Forward!" - We go into attack!

May today become the day...
As I plunge into the gray
Lead is flying, all the signs are there
They all think that I am brave
The strongest link of our chain
But really I've gotta say that ain't how it's like

Closing in, not slowing down
Iron, fire, blood
Our line's breaking and death a-taking...
Our men from all around
Into the pools of mud
Forward, forward... There is no turning back!

May today become the day...
As I plunge into the gray
Lead is flying, all the signs are there
They all think that I am brave
The strongest link of our chain
But really I've gotta say that ain't not how it's like

The fall back -calling as our soldiers keep falling
No, forward, forward! I am not turning back!

May today become the day...
As I plunge into the gray
Lead is flying, all the signs are there
They all think that I am brave
The strongest link of our chain
But really I.. just want a bullet between my eyes
Aim high.
