Since your death
Everything has felt so meaningless and vain
that I've lost the will to live

Love, your death
Ripped my heart right out and since you went away
Life's had nothing more to give

Cross my heart and hope to die
May my end come tonight
Across the dark, into the light
May death again us unite

Love, my fate
Will you wait for me there...where our autumn dawns?
There, beyond the dreary seas

Will you wait?
Will you welcome me into your arms once more?
Where our waters still fall free

Cross my heart and hope to die
May my end come tonight
Across the dark, into the light
May death again us unite

Cross my heart and hope to die
May my end come tonight
I'll depart from this life
May death again us unite

May it come...

My heart went down with you
At your funeral I was buried, too
My life - it ended with yours
And I...exist no more
