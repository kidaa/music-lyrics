On day zero my mother was expecting... the worst
And out of my father's ass I was born, feet first

"Oh, no"

The most horrendous piece of feces ever forced
To be disposed of is what I was created for

Oh, no... I'm sorry that I was born ...so wrong!

When death releases you from me
Just dump my foul remains on some near-by field
- I don't deserve a grave
When you finally get rid of me
Just let my corpse decay ...unburied
- I do NOT deserve the luxury of a grave

My worthlessness is something there is no doubt of:
- I am a waste of the filth I was made out of

How low... I'm sorry I'm still alive ...can I go!?

When death releases you from me
Just dump my foul remains on some near-by field
- I don't deserve a grave
When you finally get rid of me
Just let my corpse decay ...unburied
- I do NOT deserve the luxury of...

Oh, no... a coffin would be way too nice
Oh, no... a see-through plastic bag will do just fine

When death releases you from me
Just dump my foul remains on some near-by field
- I don't deserve a grave
When you finally get rid of me
Just let my corpse decay ...unburied
- I do NOT deserve the luxury of a grave
