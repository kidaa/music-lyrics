now flee...
I flee... back to the time when man was true
I see... life as it was meant for me

On this trail I meet my ancestors
On this trail I find their wisdom
From the wall of frozen time I see my own reflection

Born - in the wrong century
Torn - to a wrong reality

A winter chill - A frozen, dead reality
A blackened will - A strange, macabre certainty

Pagan roots!
Heathen life!if life was... EPIC !

My heart belongs to the past
I feel attraction for the night
my mind to the ancient times
I view this life like a lifeless rock

I want to be trapped under ice
within my peaceful glacial tomb
Far from the epoch of trend
In the Aeon of Frost - In league with the North !

On this trail I meet my ancestors
On this trail I find their wisdom
From the wall of frozen time I see my own reflection

Born - in the wrong century
Torn - to a wrong reality
