music: Jarwa & SENTENCED, words: Jarwa
so came the spring, came the light
and gave farewell to the wintery ice
now all is gone, this is the end.
this snow in May reminds me...

funeral... funeral time again... funeral

so came the Winter and the Summertimes
forever gone as all love for live
blank the shroud upon the ground
the shadows cast so pale...Funeral Spring is now
I watch you bury me down
funeral time again
longing to fly...

Funeral Spring is real
white as the ghostly veil on the ground
funeral time again
someone has died again
funeral time is now
and you bury me down below
funeral time again
I'm longing...to fly...again...
