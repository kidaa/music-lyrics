music: Tenkula & Sentenced, lyrics: Lopakka
No way out of your misery
Alone in pain and agony
Lay depressed and hollow
One thought in your mind
-No Tomorrow

And then you had made up your mind
and thought it was your time
You left this world without shedding a tear
without hope, without fear

So you thought you'd just put your head
into the Noose and let it all go...and so you did
Oh yeah, you did

Now you come haunting every night
Calling my name until I...
wake up feeling this sorrow
One thought in my mind
- I will followI'll drink the booze to depress myself
then I take the rope and express myself
I'll leave this world without shedding a tear
without hope, without fear

Yeah, I think I'll put my head
into the Noose and let it all go...and so I will
Oh yeah, I will

I'll take the rope, just like you
and wherever you are, I'll be too

I think I'll just put my head
into the Noose and let it all go...and so I will
Oh yeah, I will
