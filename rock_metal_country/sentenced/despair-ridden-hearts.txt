All bridges... on fire!
As onward and onward we ride
The smoke rises higher, higher...
Up the ever-darkening sky
So quickly everything swirled; descent of the world
Now it's all a chaotic ruin

Burning eerie, sapphire
The foretoken of closing doom
Glowing dreadful and dire, dire...
Is the ever-haunting moon
So sickly everything twirled; the end of the world
Now it's all a chaotic ruin

We came so far
So deeply wounded and so scarred our despair-ridden hearts
Frail as we are
Firmly united we will stand 'til the world falls apart
