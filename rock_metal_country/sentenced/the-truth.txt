music: Tenkula & SENTENCED, lyrics: Lopakka
At the primitive times
when the earth was born
Generations came and went
lived in ignorance

Somewhere in the Darkness of Time
lies open the ultimate fate of life

0132
"Mullan rakoseen vaivun"

No one can show us the right way
is this enigmatic destiny
This way is going where we are coming from
The Time has come...

verse II
