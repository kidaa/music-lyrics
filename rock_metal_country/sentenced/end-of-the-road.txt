Here we are, now lay the burden down
We're coming to the end of our road
Sorrowful yet glorious somehow
To be humming this one last ode
So calm and still... it wasn't all that bad, or was it now?
Fulfilled... it doesn't only hurt to end it now

The funeral

The memories beneath the dust of years
They seem like those of someone deceased
There's no more to be done, or hoped or feared
Just waiting for the final release
So calm and thrilled... it wasn't all that bad, or was it now?
Still it doesn't only hurt end it now

Is life over, this life's over?
Or has it only just begun?
It grows colder, starts to moulder...
Coming apart yet still not done
Forever one
