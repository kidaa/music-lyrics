music: Tenkula & SENTENCED, lyrics: Lopakka
I have seen my funeral in a thousand dreams
Its beauty'
Now the night descends
and drowns me in this dream once again'
No stars tonight' they all have ceased
No moon tonight to cast its gleam
'just a single flame lighting my journey'
Two at my feet, and two at my head
Two carrying me at where my hands are laid
Endless sleep' giving me peace
and eternally bringing release
Nothing more to be done
Nothing more to be lived for me
All my life I've waited for this eternal night
and now it's time'
soon they'll lower me down deep into the icy ground
Two at my feet, and two at my head
Two carrying me at where my hands are laid
'and once there'll be a time that I have waited for
when the dawn will steal my dreams no more'
Two at my feet, and two at my head
Two carrying me at where my hands are laid
Grave Sweet Grave - welcoming me home
Grave Sweet Grave - I'll be yours till the dawn
