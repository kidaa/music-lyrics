music: Tenkula & SENTENCED, lyrics: Lopakka
I gave and gave - gave all I had
I took and took - all I could grab
I had it all and I had none
Now the game is over and it's all gone

My heart is worn out to keep beating
My lungs exhausted by all this breathing
My mind's too tired to keep grieving

I was against and I was for
I wanted less and wanted more
I won I lost, I lost and won
Now it's all over and I am done

My throat is too sore for more screaming
My eyes too swollen for more weeping
My wounds are too dry for more bleeding
My blood too drained for more streamingMy heart is slowing down

Long short is life is short and long
Strong weak am I am weak and strong
My crop is ready for the Reaping
My being ready for releasing

My heart is slowing down
