last round
looks like i'm in for a fight
knocked down
there is nowhere left to hide
stick 'n' move
when i try to run away
old one two
i only end up face to face

mirror mirror getting clearer

it's just me and my shadow
dancing round the ring
i try to fight it
but then how can i win
when i'm only shadow boxing

time out
i'm looking for a
standing eight
no doubt
my inside has come out to play
bob 'n' weave
it's conscious of my
every move
been deceived
can no longer ignore the truth

mirror mirror getting clearer
split decision blur my vision
