little lamb come out of
the rain
you'll catch your death in
the cold
a helping hand to come ease
the pain
in peace you'll rest in
our fold

i can be a watch
towering light
for those of you who can't see
i'll separate the truth
from the lies
blind faithful come follow me

evilangelist
you name is on my list
i'm your evilangelist
in what god you trust

close your eyes while i
hypnotize
a friend in need to confess
you've been denied the cock
crowed thrice
surrender all you possess

evilangelist
your name is on my list
i'm your evilangelist
i was betrayed by a kiss

so many claim
to come in thy name
promising peace they'll bring
lest ye taste
the fruit of the vine
they're just wolves in
sheep's clothing
