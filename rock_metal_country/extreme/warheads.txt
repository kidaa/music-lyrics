Hey Kid, wanna have some fun
Choose a side and here's your gun

Brought up knowing right from wrong,
squash the meek, inherit the strong

Just try and cross the line,
Don't even bother to waste my time

What's that look in your eyes
It's time I cut you down to size

This world ain't big enough for two,
And I've got my sights on you

WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE,
I'M A WARHEAD, YOU'RE A WARHEAD
A WARHEAD JUST LIKE ME
HE'S A WARHEAD, SHE'S A WARHEAD
WATCH 'EM SCREAM 'N YELL
WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE, A WARHEAD TOO
WHEN I BLOW THEM
STRAIGHT TO HELL

Ramboy, it's us and them
Just like your Daddy in Vietnam
Monkey see, Monkey do,
Your boy's grown up
Just like you

This world ain't
Big enough for two
and I've got my
eye on you

[CHORUS]

I've seen Black heads,
White heads,
Red heads,
Dead heads,
Big heads,
Shit heads,
but, there's no heads
Like WARHEADS!
