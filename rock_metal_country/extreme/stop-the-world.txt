All the world's
a masquerade
made up of fools
and philosophers
Were it to rain
on our charade,
all washes away,
except for our true colors

If any people bothered
looking for truth, please,
STOP THE WORLD
from spinning 'round
instead we choose to follow
footsteps of fools, please
STOP THE WORLD
from spinning 'round
If nothing's new under the sun
for me and you
Won't somebody please...

STOP THE WORLD
STOP THE WORLD
I WANNA GET OFF
STOP THE WORLD
STOP THE WORLD
WHERE THERE IS LOVE

If we forget
yesterday,
We're bound to repeat it
tomorrow
It's not too late
to start today,
Better off safe,
than sorry

Do unto those as you would
do to yourselves, please,
STOP THE WORLD
from spinning 'round
We need more feet to walk
in one another's shoes, please

STOP THE WORLD
from spinning 'round
There's nothing new 
under the sun
for me and you,
Won't somebody please...
