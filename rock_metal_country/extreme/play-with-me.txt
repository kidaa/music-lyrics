Ring around the rosie
Hopscotch, Monopoly
Red light, green light
G. I. Joes and Barbies
Hide and seek, kick the can
Cowboys and Indians
Wiffle ball, paper dolls
Hacky sack and hangman

Do you wanna play with me

Tag you're IT, cops and robbers
Jungle gym, chutes and ladders
Tic tac toe, Mister Rogers
Marco Polo, London bridges
Simon sez, steal the bacon
Time out, trick or treat
Electric company
Olly olly oxen free

Do you wanna play with me

[CHORUS:]
Do you, do you
Wanna, wanna
Play, play with me
Play with me
Do you, do you
Wanna, wanna
Play, play with me
Play with me

Spin the bottle, post office
Kiss and tell, dressin' up
Playin' doctor, peek-a-boo
Two hand touch, cooties
Little League, Looney Tunes
Scissors rock paper, Zoom
Kick ball, stick ball
Kill the guy with the ball

Do you wanna play with me

Buckin' up, recess
Jump rope, relieveo
See saw, sand box
Matchbox, Cheerios
ABC's, spelling bees
Sesame Street, hockey
Duck duck duck duck
Duck duck goose

[CHORUS]

Jack and Suzi
Sittin' in a tree
K-I-S-S-I-N-G
First comes love
Then comes marriage
Then comes Adam
In a baby carriage
