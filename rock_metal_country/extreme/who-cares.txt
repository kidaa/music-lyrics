Tell me, Jesus,
are you angry
One more sheep has,
just gone astray
A hardening of hearts,
turning to stone
Wandering off,
so far from home
So many children,
losing time
Walk in darkness,
looking for a sign
Chasing their rainbows,
the future looks so bright
Slowly we're losing,
Sight of the light

WHO CARES
WHO CARES
WHO CARES
TELL ME WHO CARES
WHO CARES

All alone,
out in the cold
Can't look back,
am I growing old
I chose a path,
is this my fate
Am I finding out,
the truth too late

[CHORUS]

Here I am,
a naked man
Nothing to hide
with empty hands
Remember me,
I am the one
Who lost his way,
your Prodigal Son

WHO CARES
WHO CARES
WHO CARES
TELL ME WHO CARES
WHO CARES

AM I EVER GONNA CHANGE
WILL I ALWAYS STAY THE SAME
SAY ONE THING
THEN I DO THE OTHER
SAME OLD SONG
GOES ON FOREVER
RISE, RISE 'N SHINE
A NEW DAY IS COMING
YES IT IS!
