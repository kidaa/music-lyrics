One day
we'll find the time
to spend, together
until then, My Love

IF I HAD ONE WISH
IT WOULDN'T BE HARD TO CHOOSE
SEVEN SUNDAYS IN A ROW
CAUSE THAT'S THE DAY
THAT I SPEND WITH YOU

Someday soon,
you and I
will hold each other
once again, My Love

IF I HAD ONE WISH
IT WOULDN'T BE HARD TO CHOOSE
SEVEN SUNDAYS IN A ROW
SEVEN SUNDAYS IN A ROW
SEVEN SUNDAYS IN A ROW
CAUSE THAT'S THE DAY
THAT I SPEND WITH YOU

If I had one wish
It wouldn't be hard to choose
