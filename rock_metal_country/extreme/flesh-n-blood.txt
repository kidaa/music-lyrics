Flesh 'N' Blood
A human fascination
Acquired the taste
Right on my face
Naughty
Lost in lust
A hopeless situation
Let the game begin
I'm shirts you're skins
Naughty

These hunger pains
Growing inside me every day
I feel it in my veins
Burning inside me every day

[CHORUS:]
I wanna eat your body
Eat your body
Naughty, Naughty ,Naughty
Talkin' 'bout your body
Flesh, blood
I think I'm in love
Naughty, Naughty,Naughty
Eating up your body

Driving down
A sticky occupation
I need another shot
Of some food for thought
Naughty

These hunger pains
Growing inside me every day
I feel it in my veins
Burning inside me every day

[CHORUS]

Everybody's got a need
Everybody's got to feed
On everybody else's body
Everybody's got a need
Everybody's got to feed
On everybody
