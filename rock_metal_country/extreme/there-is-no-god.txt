so you're a self proclaimed messiah
or maybe a blasphemes liar
a clever hypnotic hoax
a hallowed heretic coax
who tells these stories so old
no, never the same twice told
speaking in distorted thruths
i see that thomas wants some proof
did you come to heal the sick
with one more magician's trick
ye generation seeks a sign
while blind keeps leading the blind

so you say there is no god
just a clever man's charade
a once upon a fairy tales fraud
has god made man or man made god

there is no god

confused thy talk in parables
accused thou walk in parallels
a simple game of simon says
this month's flavor sciences
today's fact, tomorrow's fiction
leave the rest to superstition
if knowledge comes from learning books
wisdom comes from discerning looks
a fool that says there is no god
don't feel for that sorry sod
who needs proof then he'll believe
i wonder if he's been deceived

there is no god
