Ah, look at all
the lonely people,
losing faith,
in a world
full of despair,
no one who cares,
wondering where
GOD disappeared

I, see the pain
in everybody's faces
asking why,
the GOD up in the sky,
didn't say goodbye,
please tell me,
GOD didn't die

PLEASE TELL ME
GOD ISN'T DEAD
PLEASE TELL ME
GOD ISN'T DEAD
PLEASE TELL ME
GOD ISN'T
I WANT TO KNOW
IF HE'S
TELL ME
GOD ISN'T
PLEASE TELL ME
GOD ISN'T DEAD
I WANT TO KNOW
