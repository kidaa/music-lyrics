PEACEMAKER DIE,
Mr. Righteous One
You say you have this plan
If we care to understand

PEACEMAKER DIE,
Mr. Nice Guy
You dare to speak the truth
I'll twist and turn it into lies

Blessed are the warmongers,
Blessed are the warmongers
For they shall be called,
Man-made Gods

PEACEMAKER DIE,
PEACEMAKER DIE,
PEACEMAKER DIE,
I DON'T KNOW WHY
PEACEMAKER DIE,
PEACEMAKER DIE,
PEACEMAKER DIE,
PEACEMAKER DIE,
PEACEMAKER DIE,
I DON'T KNOW WHY

PEACEMAKER DIE,
Mr. Goody Two
Do you really thing the world
Can be Black, White, and Jew

PEACEMAKER DIE,
Mr. Music Man
Don't turn your back on me
Cause I'm the one with the gun

Blessed are the warmongers,
Blessed are the warmongers,
For they shall be called,
Sons of God

I have a dream this afternoon,
That the brotherhood of man,
Will become a reality
In this day, with this faith,
I will go out and,
Carve the tunnel of hope,
Through the mountain of despair
With this faith,
I will go out with you and,
Transform dark yesterdays
Into bright tomorrows
With this faith,
We will be able to achieve
This new day
When all of God's children,
Black men and white men,
Jews and gentiles,
Protestants and Catholics
Will be able to join hands
And sing with the negroes,
In the spiritual of old
Free at last, free at last,
Thank God almighty,
We're free at last.
