respect,
always everybody looking for some
respect,
who do you think you're gonna get it from
respect,
anybody here deserving of none
respect,
tell me what makes you think
you're not the one

no respect, no respect none
no respect, no respect none
no respect, no respect none
no respect, no respect none

respect,
why be concerned with
public adulation
respect,
pat on the back crying
for attention
respect,
finding out what it really
means to me
respect,
honor comes only after
humility
