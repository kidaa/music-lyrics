as for this song
i'll set the mood
there's nothing wrong
prefer solitude
alone to think
of what i don't know
the deeper i sink
the further i'll go

nothing to fear
no need to hide
i'm already there
came in from outside
safe in my nest
home sweet home
no invited guests
i want to be alone

leave me alone
leave me alone
i wish you would
leave me alone
leave me alone
i just want to be alone

it's better this way
no one will get hurt
if you stay away
i won't lose my shirt
if i have become
too defensive
i'm not the one
you have to live with

[chorus]

i want to be, i want to be
i want to be, alone

don't feel sorry
it's not your concern
only the lonely
are the ones who get burned
safe in my nest
home sweet home
no invited guests
i want to be alone
