Don't just sit there
And stare at me
Don't just sit there
And watch me bleed
I'm losing you and you
You're losing me
I'm tired
Of what we are
I'm tired
Of all the pain
I'm losing you and you
You're losing me

Face lies flat
I see my reflection
Download thoughts
But your files
Are corrupted

Don't just sit there
And stare at me
Don't just sit there
And watch me bleed
I'm losing you and you
You're losing me
I'm tired
Of what we are
I'm tired
Of all the pain
I'm losing you
And you
You're losing me

Time stands still
And your frozen
In motion
I held down
Your escape
But you're crashing
You're crashing

Don't just sit there
And stare at me
Don't just sit there
And watch me bleed
I'm losing you and you
You're losing me
I'm tired
Of what we are
I'm tired
Of all the pain
I'm losing you
And you
You're losing me

Don't just sit there
And stare at me
Don't just sit there
And watch me bleed
I'm losing you
And you
You're losing me
I'm tired
Of what we are
I'm tired
Of all the pain
I'm losing you
We're losing
We're losing
We're losing
