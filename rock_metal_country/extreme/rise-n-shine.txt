Dawn wakes the silence,
of a fainted lullaby
Day breaks the eyelid,
from a song sung in my eye

Night rests in peace,
as the sun mourns the sky
All's accounted for sheep,
over a horizon's I

RISE, RISE 'N SHINE
A NEW DAY IS COMING
RISE, RISE IN TIME
FOR EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN

And when you see,
a south wind blow
Forecasting, you will know,
a hot day, will be on the way
Foolish one
You analyze,
the earth and the sky
I ask you why,
you can't analyze the signs,
of the present time

I had a dream,
not unlike the one from old
Of a man king,
whose head was made of gold
Stand castles of sand
weather the sundials rise 'n fall
Chasing wind through your hands,
'til water runs dry the well

DREAM, DANIEL, DREAM
FOR WHAT'S YET TO COME
SEE, DANIEL, SEE
FOR EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN

And in the West,
a cloud appears
For shadows of
a coming shower near,
Oh, so near
Hypocrites
You analyze,
the earth and the sky
I ask you why,
you can't analyze the signs,
of the present time

Vanity,
Yes, all is vanity
Vanity,
Yes, all's futility

For one that dies,
another's born
Where laughter's heard,
comforters mourn
There's a time for
everything

A song for love,
even abhor
An olive branch,
or winter's war
There's a time for
EVERYTHING, UNDER THE SUN
