today don't look so bad
compared to tomorrow
if time is all we have
then we're living on borrowed
yesterday's for fools
who try to remember
the good ol' days
weren't always that
much better

cynical fuck
well i ain't nothing but a
cynical fuck
it don't take much to be a
cynical, all you need is love
all you need is what to be a

and whatever you do
someone's done it first
though it's sad but true
this us just another verse
if you can't take it with you
then what's the use
i never saw a u-haul
being pulled behind a hearse

[chorus]

looks like my brighter side
has gotten a bit darker
i must have stepped over
my four leaf clover
'cause someone drank my
half-filled cup of water
