so tell me what can i do
that you couldn't see through
from the very start
there is only one thing
yet to come from my heart

loving you, unconditionally
loving you, unconditionally
that's what i want to be
what you are to me

can you see why it's so hard
for me to break apart
from all the things i hold
closer to a heart
that has grown, far too cold

loving you, unconditionally
something new
to a heart yet not free
that's what i want to be
what you are to me

and though it seems impossible
when both of my hands are full
that's the only condition
that keeps me
from loving you. . .
