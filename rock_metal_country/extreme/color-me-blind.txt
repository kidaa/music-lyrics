I had a dream,
Last night I was blind
And I couldn't see
Color of any kind

Picture the world, minus a rainbow
When day becomes night, then where will the sun go
Dancing alone, just me and my shadow
Color me blind, so I can see no evil

WHY DO WE DREAM,
IN BLACK AND WHITE
COLOR ME BLIND
WHY DO WE DREAM
IN BLACK AND WHITE
COLOR ME BLIND

I had a dream,
I was looking, over the mountain
But I've, I've yet to see the,
The so-called promised land

Picture the world,
Without any color
You couldn't tell,
One face from the other
I don't understand
Why we fight with our brother
Color me blind
Just to love one another

Color me, color you,
COLOR ME BLIND
