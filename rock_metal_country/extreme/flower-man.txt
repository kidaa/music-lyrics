He speaks of meekness
Being no sign of weakness
Gently placing the flower in the gun
Well intended pacifism a naive idealism
Singing his favourite Lennon song
Bleeding heart insisting preach
The path of least resisting
Milk and honey rolling off of his tongue
War is not he answer turn the other cheek
And offer sacrificing on the altar of love

Flower man
Singing lets all
Give peace a chance
Flower man
Keep your head
Buried in the sand
Flower man
You're my enemy's
Best friend
Flower man
You misguided utopian

Peace in appeasing
Like it's always in season
Never needed to weather the storm
Betting on your better angels
Ignoring human nature in truth
Red tooth and in claw
Lion and lamb lay
In your land of make pretend
Forgetting every soldier and son
Lest you care
To measure all the blood
And the treasure
Must be something worth
Fighting for. No?
Is it worth fighting for?

Flower man singing
Lets all
Give peace a chance
Flower man
Keep your head
Buried in the sand
Flower man
You're my enemy's
Best friend
Flower man
Liberty
Is a well armed lamb

Ladies and gentlemen
I give you flower man

Love is on the way
Love is on the way
Or so they say

He speaks of meekness
Being no sign of weakness
Gently placing
The flower in the gun
Well intended pacifism
A naive idealism
Singing his favourite Lennon song
Bleeding heart insisting preach
The path of least resisting
Milk and honey rolling off
Of his tongue
War is not he answer
Turn the other cheek
And offer sacrificing
On the altar of love

Flower man
Singing lets all
Give peace a chance
Flower man
Keep your head
Buried in the sand
Flower man
You're my enemy's
Best friend
Flower man
Liberty
Is a well armed lamb
