Oh Daddy please,
take me with you
where you going
Oh Daddy please,
come find the time,
come watch us growing
Oh Daddy please,
don't leave there's so
much that we want to
know before you go

I'm in need of someone
to tie my shoe,
or take hold of my hand
when I become afraid
And whose footsteps
will I follow into,
Daddy please,
don't run away

OUR FATHER
FAR FATHER
WELL LET ME TELL YOU 'BOUT
OUR FATHER
FAR FARTHER AWAY...

Oh Daddy please,
I pray every night
the doors will open
Oh Daddy please,
this house is just
a broken home,
left all alone
