so you want me to take it off
just to see what's
underneath my cloth
i'll show you i'm every
inch a man
measure all that you
think you can

i'm more than what
meets the eye
flesh 'n' blood is
often a white lie
by the cover you misjudge
the book
open your mind and take
another look

naked, and i'm unashamed
naked, with no one to blame
naked, ya you want the truth
naked, here's my birthday suit
naked, naked, naked, naked

i pretend to be not anyone
except me and my imperfections
there is nothing i
expect of you
that you wouldn't
expect of me, too

[chorus]

will you excuse me for my ignorance
'cause i can see only one
difference
those of you who seek to find
while all the others choose
to walk 'n' talk blind
