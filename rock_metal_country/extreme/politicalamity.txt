Wars 'n rumors
Of wars, no one knows what for
Toys and soldiers
Deployed, on some foreign shore
Lords and rulers
Destroy, diplomatic rapport

Communists, dictatorships
Democracies, hypocrisies
Ask not what your country can do
To a one world governmental zoo

POLITICAL, POLITICAL
POLITICALAMITY
IT'S AN-AR-CHY
POLITICAL, POLITICAL
POLITICALAMITY

Rich 'n poor
Salute your country's colors
Less is more
When one oppresses the other
Pride 'n power
Decorated upon collars

Donkeys, bears 'n elephants
All paper-trained on parliament
Ask not what your country can do
To a one world governmental zoo
