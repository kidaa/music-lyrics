sun going up,
making its rounds
it keeps on moving,
painting the town
before you know it,
she's sinking low
so tell me something . . .

something i don't already know
i don't know

toward the south,
then turning north
whirlwind spinning,
on a circular course
the answer my friend,
returns to blow
so tell me something . . .

something i don't already know
i don't know
tell me something
i don't know

as for the wise men who pursue
their knowledge
same as the fool, free falling
prey to folly
can only one fate befall
them both
so tell me something . . .

[chorus]

if every song been sung,
under the sun
what's left for me then,
eat drink and have fun
it must go on, as for the show
so tell me something . . .
