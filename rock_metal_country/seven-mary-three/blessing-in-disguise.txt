Everything's a blessing in disguise
You wear yours
I'll wear mine

Everything's a blessing in disguise
Falling to rise

The vanishing me
is aching to be
something you need

She stands at the edge
and pulls me back in
Thin as a strand

and does what she can
to pull me back?inEverything's a blessing in disguise
We've got time

Everything's a blessing in disguise
You're all I want
and maybe you,
You don't make me say it
You don't make me say it

She stands at the edge
and pulls me back in
Thin as a strand
She stands at the edge
and does what she can
