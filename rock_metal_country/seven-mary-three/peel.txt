I'm going back to Virginia
If it's not too late, to make my break
Maybe Carolina
near the company of Grace
If I find New Orleans
you know my will just fades
when I see all my people
on the Esplanade
If the O-town humor
shines on my estate
Let them peel me like an orange
taste the sugar of my?

Going back to beginnings
I'm on call, to tell you all
There's a paranoid loose
in the urban shopping mall
All the perfect people on Orange Ave.
they're all right
All the ugly ones who tried to run you through
they're all rightIf you can stand yourself and sleep tonight
Let them peel you like an orange
taste your shivering insides
