My good looks won't save my kids
from their dad's predicament.
They won't see my face like this
see my face as a shadow

I could be wrong
or I could be strong

The penny-rate my love collects
could set your ass on fire
Instead of praying thankful hallelujahs
on the wire
You turn on your radio regardless
as you start your car
But baby don't believe it
when he tells you who you areHe could be wrong and
you could be strong
You're finding out you're selfish
because you like your happiness
Don't sacrifice it to the average
Keep it for yourself

They'll buy your butterflies 
and price them down
to clean the racks
Until a kid like you
can buy them back

I could be wrong 
or I could be strong
