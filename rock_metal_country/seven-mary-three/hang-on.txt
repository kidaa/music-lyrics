So you're sticky and you're young and your head is like a sponge
Go to keep yourself, keep you from becoming one

Get up off of your knees!

You feel a tick in your stomach and it's eating towards your heart
A subtle, constant shiver from the bottom to the top

Get up off of your knees!
Someone needs to be an anthem for the end of suffering?/P> 

As revealed in the end there are parallels in life
If there's fission in the bomb then there's fission in your mind

Don't melt down on me!
Someone needs to be an anthem for the end of suffering?/P> 

Hang on to me
Don't disintegrate as you're discovering

There's a man in a dream doing laps around a lake
Busy talking to himself livingdying just the same

Don't think he was me!
I believe the middle takes the man out to the edge
and then I don't want to wait

I can be a wall around you, under any covering I'll find you

Hang on to me
Someone needs to be an anthem for the end of suffering?/P> 

Paint the caves of your existence with the colors of your mind
find a color for commitment, one that satisfies

Sounds easy to me!
I can be a wall around you, under any covering I'll find you

Hang on to me
Don't disintegrate as you're discovering

Hang on to me
Someone needs to be an anthem for the end of suffering?
