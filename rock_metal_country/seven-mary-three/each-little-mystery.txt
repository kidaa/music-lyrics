She's got a ticket
but you need more than a ticket to get you there
You need a string of good intentions 
and an easy burn
Maybe some good luck 
with the cash tucked in the back of your pocket
Maybe it's still not enough to ease your pain
you get tired and say fuck it

Each little mystery is safe in your heart
you've got to wonder, is moving on the best that you can do?
Need to have a little conversation
Find the truth behind the questions that are haunting you

She says there's motivation
tucked into the crease between the seats
I looked through the box
for cigarettes, maps, keys
There's so much room in here
you can put your feet straight out the dash
She turns the radio on
pulls me close to hear me laugh

Each little mystery is safe in your heart
you've got to wonder, is moving on the best that you can do?
Need to have a little conversation
Find the truth behind the questions that are haunting you

She rests her hand along the space
between my neckline and my back
I can feel her fingers runnin' through the feelings
I didn't think I had. Like?BR>maybe this road we're on
is the very thing that's come between us
maybe it's the highway
to the very place that might just save us

Each little mystery is safe in your heart
you've got to wonder, is moving on the best that you can do?
Need to have a little conversation
Find the truth behind the questions that are haunting you 

Each little mystery is safe in your heart
you've got to wonder, is moving on the best that you can do?
I hear you've got a little education
It's not enough to satisfy what's haunting you
