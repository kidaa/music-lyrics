What's your mother say?
You never listen to me?
I know you want back in
you don't get it for free

You better read the book, and
hear what they say
Best learn the rules
and sit up straight

What's your daddy say?
You never listen to me?
I know you're trying hard
you don't get a reprieveDid you read good book?
Did you bid good time?
Did you push ahead?
Bet you stood the line.

Liquid used to surround me
my freedom- swimming and drowning
Today we throw it up for sale.
Today we're giving it away

It's the Honey of Generation
makes you forget where you came from.
It's the Honey of Generation
and it's yours...
