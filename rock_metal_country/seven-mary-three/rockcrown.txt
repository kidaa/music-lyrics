Well I haven't seen a doctor
since I can't remember when
But she tells me I've been a talker
since 1976
We went up to the lake and I, I remember
this: my family secret

Pits in my skin where I let you in
This RockCrown never let you downI'm a season in Hell- 20 years
from showing up, down on your scene
without a semblance of what I've seen
Tell me what I've seen
Tell me what I've seen
Enough to make this young man
Filthy. Filthy. Clean...

Pits in my skin where I let you in
This RockCrown never let you down
