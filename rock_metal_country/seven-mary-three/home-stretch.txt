Yeah you in your mother's new shoes
bet you like them as much as her blues
Don't tell anyone - but I plan to move
the first time you look away
Tell me the new apron strings
taste to you, yes
my pretty young things
You tell me that hatred is king
It's to the weak and the manor born

Like a trick that you've fallen for,
you recognize me because:
there's only one sound to love

Bye bye  Bye bye  Bye baby  Good
Bye bye  Bye bye  Bye baby  Good
Bye bye  Bye bye  Bye baby  Good-byeTell me you in your mother's new shoes
bet you like them as much as her blues
Don't tell anyone, but I'm born to move
like the first star you ever saw.

Tell me the new apron strings
trace to you, yeah.
My pitied young things
I tell you that love can be king
It's to the meek and the manner born.

But like a trick that you've fallen for
you recognize me because:
there's only one sound to love
