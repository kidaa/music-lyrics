She calls me Goliath and I wear the David mask
I guess the stones are coming too fast for her now
You know I'd like to believe this nervousness will pass
All the stones that are thrown are building up a wall

I have become cumbersome... to this world
I have become cumbersome... to my girl

I'd like to believe we could reconcile the past
Resurrect those bridges with an ancient glance
But my old stone face can't seem to break her down
She remembers bridges, burns them to the ground

I have become cumbersome... to this world
I have become cumbersome... to my girl

Too heavy too light
Too black or too white
Too wrong or too right
Today or tonite... cumbersome
Too rich or too poor
She's wanting me less
And I'm wanting her more
The bitter taste is cumbersomeNo, yeah! No, no, no!
No, no, no! Yeah!

There is a balance between two worlds
One with an arrow and a cross
Regardless of the balance
Life has become... cumbersome

Too heavy too light
Too black or too white
Too wrong or too right
Today or tonite... cumbersome
Too rich or too poor
She's wanting me less
And I'm wanting her more
The bitter taste is cumbersome

No, yeah! No, no, no!
No, no, no! Yeah!
No, no, no! No, yeah!
Your life has become combersome...
