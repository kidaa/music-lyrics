Do you think that people get tired of themselves?
Is that why the T.V.'s on all the time?
It don't take much to get it right back on track,
but it won't fall from the sky right into your lap.

I've made the most of Luck.
You get a brand new chance
in a brand new town.
And if I don't read what they wrote about me,
I might turn you on to something I've found:

Silence.  Priceless.  Silence.
The only way we talk.What if people get everything they expect?
What becomes of hope?
I'll bet she's a nervous wreck.
What's the genius in a cushion on your couch?
You better find yourself something that drags you out.

I've made the most of Love.
You get a brand new chance in a brand new town.
And if I don't hear what they whisper about me,
I might turn you on to something I've found:

Silence.  Priceless.  Silence.
The only way we talk.
