I know how the good wind blows 
and it gives me my time
Don't let them drag your hatred off the line
I know how the anger goes so I bury mine
You know they had me working overtime

I want no part of your blackheart causes
empty speeches
broken promise

I know how the anger flows so I carried time
Don't let them drag the needle through your dime
I know how the hatred goes so I buried mine
Lucky seven Lucky rolls the dice
Yeah that's right.I want no part of your blackheart causes.
All this preaching and still no progress

What angry blue has got into you?
