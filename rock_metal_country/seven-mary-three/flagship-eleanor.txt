I've got a tricked-out receiver
and I think it's built to win
I've got one chance to receive her voice
translucent, delicate

Breakdown! Breakout! Eleanor
I think your loneliness is code
It symbolizes every man
who's empty as a hole

Eleanor?I'm waiting for you

I've got a number to call you back
but I think ";leave well-enough alone";
I chased a shoestring to a heart-attack
closeted everything I ownCome down! Crash land! Eleanor
I think your loneliness is code
It symbolizes every man
who's empty as a hole

Eleanor?I'm waiting for you

Flagship?
Come down?
Crash land?
         My town? 

Eleanor?
I'm waiting for you
