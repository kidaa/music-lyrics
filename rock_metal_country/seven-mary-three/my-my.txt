"My my stomach hurts again tonite" she says
Crashes on her floor
Cuts what she can't untie
Ties it to a door
And if mercy was a cattle call
She didn't hear
She didn't want to play the role of the fool again
Won't be fooled again

Indifference... as my witness
And I think she'd take me back
She tears down my front door just to... see my photograph

"My my head is getting so confused" she says
What's she trying to do to me?
Put my sticker on her car
Bought a CD
If mercy was a cattle call
She didn't hear
She didn't want to play the role of the fool again
Won't be fooled again

Indifference... as my witness
And I think she'd take me back
She tears down my front door just to... hear my phonograph

It spins...
"I ain't too proud to beg sweet darlin
 Don't you leave my baby don't you go
 I ain't too proud to beg sweet darlin
 Don't you leave me"

"My my skin can't take much more of this" she says
You're scaling over me
Every time I wash it off, I find you underneath
And if mercy was a cattle call
She didn't hear...
She didn't want to play the role of the fool again
Won't be fooled again...
