"Don't go there" I heard her say
"You can't stomach what you're going to see"
It's down there, by the water's edge
Wasted and bloated and waiting for someone else

Funny how, these things come about
When you're tied to the teeth and mouth
No sound or fury, no shot of pain
There was no real reason, no gain

I can't go down, to the water's edge
I didn't do it, I saw who did it
Don't go down, to the water's edge
They did it once and they can do it again

It ain't no secret to me
How she got there down by the stream
'Cause I'd seen her a minute before
The van pulled up and opened the door took all my love

I can't say a single word
About what I saw of her
Her killers, they got their friends
In familiar places, I tell you man

I can't go down, to the water's edge
I didn't do it, I saw who did it
Don't go down, to the water's edge
They did it once and they can do it again

This ain't no fucking game
And I'm feeling so ashamed
Because I didn't do anything
No I didn't do anything
To stop
To stop
To stop
To stop
This... from... happening
I... didn't do... anything

"Don't go down to the water's edge" she said to me
I didn't do it, but I saw who did it see
Don't go down to the water's edge
They did it once, they can do it again

I swear
I swear
I swear
I swear

I didn't do... a thing
I should have done... something
