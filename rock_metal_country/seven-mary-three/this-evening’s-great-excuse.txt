Time will pack a bag on you, my love
organize, re-organize your Luck
Pretty face, a pretty smile,
a pretty shame you can't defile
The message you have made for them to see

And it will be
And it will be
H Y P O C R I S Y  HYPOCRISY

This evening's great excuse is this:
To make your peace.
And make a list
of everything that's trivial and wideHandshake man, how could you be?
A sweeter, softer, gentler king
Spread out for every queen to see

And it will be
And it will be
H Y P O C R I S Y  HYPOCRISY
