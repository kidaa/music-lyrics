"Margaret came to me" was all he said
Before she knew my name she was in my bed
She was only... sweet sixteen
20,000 days younger than me

"Marry me" she said I don't reply
"Daddy said you better, or you'll die"
She wants a house and fifteen kids I guess She does, my love
And I can't find a state we're legal in

Margaret... Margaret... Margaret... Margaret

Margaret feels the world beneath her feet
Shaking like a leaf falls from the tree
She don't care he's ten years older than me
As long as they're together happily She says they will

"Marry me" she said I don't reply
"Daddy said you better, or you'll die"
She wants a house and fifteen kids I guess She does, my love
And I can't find a state we're legal in

Margaret... Margaret... Margaret... Margaret

She was only... sweet sixteen

10: Punch In Punch Out/h3

I wake up
To beat the sun... from her glory
I'm only
One cigarette
Away from mobility
It's always
Punch in punch out
Go to work and go back home
There's only
One chance left
And I know
And I know
Where she is waiting

I wake up
To beat the sun from her glory
I'm only one cigarette away from mobility
It's always
Punch in punch out
Go to work and go back home
There's only one chance left
And I know where she is waiting
