Hey man:
You're so complicated and mean
maybe your system needs adjustment
She is a famous people collector
I'm juggling J-O-B The Judger

Maybe the words don't mean a thing
They never fill the dead man's shoes
Who killed the culture-hero trip?
If it was me then it was you

You can be intimidating when
people think you're complicated
How could you be so in-between?
What they want and what you need";Man, you're so complicated and mean";
The young mustafah cleaner said
";Don't waste your mojo on a curse
Politic your angry reason out of bed";

And if your words mean anything
make them a positive foundation
Back it up with what you do
wring the love out of frustration!

You can be intimidated when
people think you're complicated
How could you be so in-between?
What they want and what you need
