It will take a fancy store
for mom and dad
to forget what they never had

It will only take one moment
to make her believe
she's something worth trying on

A little motivation goes a long way down

I think a cigarette should smoke
like the Devil's holy joke
because he's laid one out on meI think if everybody streamed
from their TVs to your scene
it would be O.K. with me

You can't keep a good thing on a string
You've got to give it room to breath
It may leave an empty space

A little motivation goes a long way down

In every situation, heavy traffic jams his sound
