No communication with you
Words don't believe
the things they mean
mean what you say
say who you are

No communication with you
This silence is thick
but listen close
I'm crawling through
your radio

I can't keep a thought?
Am I?
Chasing you, chasing you out
Chasing you, chasing you out

No communication with you
Tired of things
we can't control
We want them fixed
CompatibleNo communication with you
The moment you leave
the truth explodes
from underneath
her hiding place

I can't keep a thought?
Am I?
Chasing you, chasing you out
Chasing you, chasing you out

It's make believe
It's in your mind
Always in your mind
It's deafening
Distance between
conditioning
You and I

I can't keep a thought?
Am I?
Chasing you, chasing you out
Chasing you, chasing you out
