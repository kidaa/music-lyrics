I think it's bigger than books when
reality steps in

I can feel you pull through me
Reality surely
leaves the choice in our hands

Super-Related and
I can see one Holy-Roller
keeps looking over his shoulder

how to live with mistakes

Super-Related is
like a cosmic communion
It's the colorless union
of all the love in the world

What if we're aeroplanes? I would be a fire in the sky
It's always do or die or hit the?
