Been draggin' this mask
all over town
with my face still in it
No one saw that I did it

Things they've done to me
you would never believe
Believe me they're true
things I've had to do

To get next to you
I need a straight-away ticket
to a southwestern state
Have I broke all the rules that I've made?Been draggin' this past
all over town
with my life still in it
Every single minute

Things I've done to me
You would never believe
Believe me they're true
things I've had to do

To get next to you
I need a straight-away ticket
to a southwestern state
Have I broke all the rules that I've made?
