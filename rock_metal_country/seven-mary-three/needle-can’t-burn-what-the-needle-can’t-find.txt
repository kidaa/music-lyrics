I don't want to spend the rest of my life
starin?at a man,  Looking down a line
what's he say? Not my style?
Just a stylized version of an obsolete file

I don't want to spend the rest of my time
lookin?for the words I'm never going to find
You read them in a book and apply them to your life
but how can I be as pretty as she writes?

I know I'm all right. Because
the needle can't burn what the needle can't find

She don't want to spend the rest of her heart
waste it on a job, and never get a start
Part of her says she should be herself
and part of her says she should be with someone elseI don't want to spend the rest of my life
looking for a girl I'm never gonna find.
Starin?back at me when I come home at night
but how can she be as pretty as I write?

It will be hard, but I know I'm all right,
because the needle can't burn
what the needle can't find
And the money won't save what the money
can't buy

And part of me is safe
And part of me is lies
So be mine tonight.
