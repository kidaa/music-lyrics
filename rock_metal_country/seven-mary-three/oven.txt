Get down and pray to the oven
She thinks that god is there, in there
Do you see Sylvia in the oven?
Colossal Fact, Daddy's ex don't let you read.
Here's what she sees.

In the end her only friend, keeps herself wide open
looks into a higher ground
What did  husband say was found?
She found - a daughter going on with her life
I can't juggle this
I can't juggle this 
I can't juggle this

When it slips she says:
This Kansas wheat won't break me
and another drink won't take me
I can make it if you canStrip it down wide open still
Was your head caught in that pill?
Was your life one big regret?
The smartest man she ever met
was not buried or put up on a cross

And she thinks it's over, still
if that  light won't go on
There's no hope in life at all
if the oven won't burn

This Kansas wheat won't break us
and another drink won't make us free
The oven's wide open, hold your breath and see.
Hold your breath and see...
