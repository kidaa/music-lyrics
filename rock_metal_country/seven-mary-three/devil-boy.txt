I slept through Easter yesterday
Right through Christmas just the same
The priest came up to me all up in arms
He said: "Devil boy, what have you done?"

Hey devil boy
We're gonna blow you're house in
Hey devil boy
What do you think of that?

For heaven's sakes
It's only been 2000 years
I can't wait any longer for you

The Jesuits rolled in their tanks to my front door
While the Capuchins held a love-in on my front porch
The Augustinians kept to themselves, stuck their tongues out in a row
They said, "Devil boy, it's off to hell you go!"

Hey devil boy
We're gonna blow you're house in
Hey devil boy
What do you think of that?

For heaven's sakes
It's only been 2000 years
I can't wait any longer for you

Ans so I'll sit and pray for her to call me there
And I'll burn that bridge a 1000 times, on the cross I bear
Just to wonder if you're listening from a soap box in the sky
To finally realize my price, was it you or I?

Hey devil boy
We're gonna blow you're house in
Hey devil boy
What do you think of that?

For heaven's sakes
It's only been 2000 years
I can't wait any longer for you

For heaven's sakes
I'd give away eternity
If you would come back to me, if you would come back to me
If you would come back to me, if you would come back to me
