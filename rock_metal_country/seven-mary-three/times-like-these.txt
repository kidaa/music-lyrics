A young girl give me a good luck charm.
Put a snake on my neck and a bird on my arm. 
Got one good leg 'cause the other went South.
Got a brand new crutch and a brand new mouth.  

I got a sheriff's name branded where I should have kept clean.
If you get too close you're going to know what I mean.  
And I know when I'm old the only runnin?gonna come.
Away from lips and the fork of my tongue.  

It only gets to me in times like these.
And times like these are getting to me.

Put your hand in the oven there's a heaven inside.
It burns straight through but the devil don't mind.
Because he takes what he wants and he finds what you hide.
And it will buy you a place on the Lower East Side.  

I rolled a number last night and I walked in my sleep.
I could feel all the nerves in the tips of my teeth.
As they crumbled into dust and washed into the sea.
Finally shut my mouth so I could hear myself think.

It only gets to me in times like these.
It only gets to me in times like these.
It only gets to me in times like these.
And times like these are getting to me.
