To be forced under and look up to your home because
We gave our eyes but no one will yes I know because
To heed the cause I will be barred but you won't
We are here to love heart he's up inside We start to cry
Just because I will afford, living in me is so poor
Deliver me----there
To be judged by one or licked by three
And your holes enclose
We gave our eyes but no one will yes I know because
To heed the cause I will be barred but you won't
We are here to love heart it's up inside We start to cry
Just because I will afford, Living in me is so poor
Deliver me----up!!!
Cannont f**k to be me and you won't find me
And you won't find me and you will don't know me--psycho
I don't believe you will find me
And you won't find me and you will so come from--a psycho
I don't believe you will find me
And you won't find me and you will don't quit--psycho
I don't believe you will find me
I'm in trouble because playing god
