I'll stick you a little
enough to take your
oxygen away
then I'll set you on fire
cause I'm on fire
and I'm with you alone
I'm so into this whore
be afraid
I might lose her so forget about me
because I'll stick you
pushed back to square
now that you've kneed her
in the throat
well there you go
cause back in school
we are the leaders
of all so transpose
or stop you life is what you do
all you are to me is meat
now pass the flask
