My knife it's sharp and chrome
Come see inside my bones
All of the fiends are on the block
I'm the new king
I taste the queen
In here we are all anemic
In here anemic and sweet
So go get your knife
And come in
So go get your knife
And lay down
So go get your knife now kiss me
I can float here forever
In this room we can't touch
The floor in here
We're all anemic
In here anemic and sweet so
