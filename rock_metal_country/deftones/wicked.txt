Yo Chuck we got running mixes...in the headphones, Ah ha ha ha Wicked!!!!
Ha Ha 1..2..3 and I come with the wicked style
And you know that I'm from the wicked crew, you act like you knew
But I got everybody jumping to the voodoo you kickin
Wicked rhymes, picket signs, me and my mob got a truck full of 9's
Drop then I'll slay ya
Ready to Buck Buck Buck but it's a must to Duck Duck Duck
Before I bust ya, looking for the one that did it
You want my vote, no your never gonna get it
Cause I'm the one with the phat mad skills
And I won't choke like the Buffalo Bills, Sittin at the pad just chillen
Larry Parker just got 2 million, Oh what a fucking feeling
That nigger done past me the peel, and I slam dunk it like ShaquilleO'neal
Wicked, Wreckin Baby I'll rock that test tube baby

[chorus:]
Cause I'm Wicked, Ice Cube I told you they want some
yes I'm Wicked, Give me the mic and bost off thier crown
yes I'm Wicked, all of them got with this song

My name is Jonathan and Ice Cube we run the town
Don't say nothing just listen got me, got me a plan to break Tyson out of prison
You going my way you get served, still got a deuce then I bunny hop the curb
Nappy head, nappy chest, nappy chin, never seen with a happy grin
Going flat frown cause I'm down, so take a look around
All you see is big black boots, stepin use my steel toe as a weapon
And it's awfully quite you want to  nail onto a the stick
Ah but that's nasty, cause I got a body count like Ice T
From in New York I get them skins, and I ain't talking about pork
Your sly, you pig dig listen from the flow from a so calledcaucasion
Ah your picket signs, You know I was funky ass wisdom picket budget talking chorus
People wanna know how come I got a gat and I'm sitting at the window like Malcolm
Ready to bring that noise and going to get heavy like the Ghetto Boyz
December 29th was power to the people, you'll might just see a sequel
Cause police got equal hate A horse is a pig that don't fly straight
I'm doin Daryl Gates but it's Willie Willams, I'm down with the pilgrims
I'm through with the pig so I think the job is dead, get out...
