This ain't no motherf**kin' stick up just pick up the stick up
And watch it roll real close rolling out of my hand 'til
It cracks to that f**king dome living off the curb
That peels you from the curb a lick rest off
Do you dig many in '93 been making them fools 'bout
Round bumping around me you'll want to run from
Underground at the best walk the live from the verb
On the beats I won't see you f**kin' head
Peers I flow and mother she won't drain herself
And won't be caught in all live in a big world
Began just because
My life is unrise wipe
Lyrical did did
Get straight quickly making fools go down
Bumping around me you'll want to see from
Underground at the best slide five blocks from the verb
On the beats I won't see you fuckin' head
Peers I flow and mother she won't drain herself
And won't be caught in all live in a big world
Began just because
My life is unrise wipe
Lyrical did did
Try to hide!
Unrise! Lyrical!
Unrise! Lyrical!
Began just because
My life is unrise wipe
Lyrical did
Began just because
My life is unrise wipe
Lyrical did did
Wipe Did Wipe Did
