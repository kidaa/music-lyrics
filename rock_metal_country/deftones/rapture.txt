Two different sides
The same kind of thread
Different needle
The world, hey! hey! hey!

It's rapture
But it's a different style
It's rapture
The same kind of thread
Go ahead

I can't
I can't feel like
I can't diffuse
It feels like

What's inside of me?
I will curse you out from me
It's just two different tools, different pieces
Can't choose one
With power

I know where you are now
You twist everything else around
Now you fuck with me

Waste...of time

You said it's worked out, you swear to god!
You said I swear to god, don't want it again!
You said you swear to god, don't want it again!
You said I don't want it again, and you swear to god!

Instead, you just waste
Waste
Waste my time
Instead you just waste
Waste....my time

What takes it away?
I'm the one man suffering
It's just two different views
Different pieces
Can't choose one
With power

I know where you are now
You twist everything else around
Now you fuck with me
Waste of, waste

I can't
I can't feel like
I can't diffuse
It feels like

You said I swear to god, don't want it again!
You said don't want it again, you swear to god!
You said I swear to god, don't want it again!
You said I don't want it again, and you swear to god!

Instead, you just waste
Waste
Waste my time
Instead you just waste
Waste
Waste my time

Two different sides
The same kind of thread
Just different needles
A whole world, hey!

It's rapture
But it's a different style
It's rapture
Same kind of thread
