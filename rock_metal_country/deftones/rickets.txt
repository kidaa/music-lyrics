it's so simple to look at every little thing i do wrong
it's so simple to overlook every little thing i do right
i think too much i feed too much im gone too much 
i skate too much i snore too much im blowin too much, 
i ate too much im way too much too stuck up

you're probably right this time
but i dont want to listen
you're probably this time
but i dont even care

i dream too much i think too much i step too much 
those things too much 
i am too much im pissed too muchi need too muchi kinda want to throw!!

you're probably right this time
but i dont want to listen
you're probably this time
but i dont even care

and if it was mine to say, i wouldn't say it
and if it was mine to say, i wouldn't speak

you're probably right this time
but i dont want to listen
you're probably this time
but i dont even care
and if it was mine to say, i wouldn't say it
