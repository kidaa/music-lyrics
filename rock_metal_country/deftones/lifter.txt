Watch me with your eyes
Been giving god, A pedophile
I want to be just like you
Then I'd be cool, maybe not -- but
We lift our eyes, big suprise
Kiss me goodbye -- Whore
Without you being here I've been giving fear
Been a bore I wish I could feel like you
When I f**k like you - being sore - but
We lift our eyes, Big suprise
Kiss me goodbye
And make you burn all that you worked for
Every knuckle wiped into her
I know if I get more style
I will never get what I want
Inside of her
This gift of mine, resing, restring, unwind, my eyes are closed
A part of me gets pissed, a part of me gets sore
A part of me gets sick, A part of me gets sore
A part of me gets sick, A part of me gets -- Inside, I burn
A part of me gets sore, A part of me gets sick
A part of me gets sore, Sore f**kin Sick
I wave goodbye to you
