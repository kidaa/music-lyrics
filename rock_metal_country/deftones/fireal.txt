We are beggers where blown
and I will meet you fourth floor
Then we'll make-up no...
No fist to f**kin' save you from
You knock me out
I'll take the burden full blown
And I will be there no...
No fist to f**kin' save you from
You knock me out
No fist to fuckin' save you from
I'm going home
Everything felt good
Everything's right at first
When I was cursed Maddog...
Life before I would shine down unshy
It comes from the first one
While I watch you
I want to be much than more
While I watch you
