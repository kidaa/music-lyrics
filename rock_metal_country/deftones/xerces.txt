Universe surrounds,
When you're ready
It waits for us to leave this earth
Come on,
They're calling the name out

I don't know I could stay or leave
Either way
Cause the comet can take us all the way through

Goodbye
Safe, heaven, new
I'll be waiving, goodbye

Return to see everything looks the same
I don't know if the change made was great
Cause the craving remains the same

Goodbye
Safe, heaven, new
I'll be waiving, goodbye

I'll be waiving,

Goodbye...
