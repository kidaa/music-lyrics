Got back out back off the forefront
i never said or got to say bye to
my boy but it's often i try i think
about how i'd be screaming and
the times would be bumping all our
minds would be flowing taking
care of shit like hey holmes what
you needing sometimes life will be
coming off whack and will open
your eyes as i proceed to get
loose i feel you next to me fiending
getting spacey with the common
love of music think of this as the
sun and the mind as a tool but we
could bounce back from this one
with attitude will and some spirit
with attitude will your spirit we'll
shove it aside soulfly fly high so
fly fly free when you walk into this
world walk into this world with
your head up high.
