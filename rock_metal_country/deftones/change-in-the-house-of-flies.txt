I watched you change
into a fly
I looked away you were on fire
and I watched a change in you
it's like you never had
wings now you feel alive
I've watched you change
I took you home
set you on the glass
I pulled off your wings
then I laughed
and I watched a change in you
now you feel alive
now you feel so alive
I've watched you change
like you never had wings
I look at the cross
then I look away
give you the lungs to blow
me away
