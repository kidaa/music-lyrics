I taste you much better
off teeth taste
of white skin on red leather
check the claws we got
night time cavity to come in
downtown pony
work your pitch
I came to in feathers
lie leaves and you
rubbed me together
with claws like we got
night time cavity to come
in downtown pony
work your pitch daytime dancer
I'll come inside
got my teacher
now carve your niche
