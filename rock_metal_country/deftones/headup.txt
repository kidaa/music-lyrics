Got back out, back off the forefront
i never said, or got to say bye to my boy, but
its often i try
i think about how id be screaming
and the times would be bumping
all our minds would be flowing
taking care of shit like, hey holmes what you needing
as lifes coming off whack it will open your eyes 

As i proceed to get loose
You seem to have some doubt
i feel you next to me fiending getting spacey
with the common love of music
think of this as the sun and the mind as a tool
but we could bounce back from this one with attitude will and some spirit
with attitude will and your spirit we'll shove it aside 

soulfly
fly high
soulfly
fly free 

Shut your shit, please say what you will.
I can't think. Sidestep around
I'm bound to the freestyle.
Push down to the ground.
With a nova dash but they watch you.
Now climb up, super slide,
the spirits so low it's coming over you!!! 

soulfly
fly high
soulfly
fly free 

when you walk in to this world
walk in to this world, with your head up high [x4]
Headup, Headup, Headup, Headup, Headup
