Oh, I try 
They can't say I didn't try 
I waited by a small child 
Oh, Tried to leave her 
When she says I'll never love again 
I wave my head in shame 
In memories 
And more 

This love, I share 
I share it, with you 
Drunken 
Water, Water 

Please stay 
I wanna love again 
Only 
Feeling stuck 
Into my shallow public choice 
I wave my head in shame 
In memories 
What for? 

This love, I share 
I share it, with you 
Drunken 
Water, Water 

Stop sittin' and passin' on everything that I'd ever do 
It's not worth to, yeah 

I paid the chance rest by you 
Oh, tell again 

This love, I share 
I share it, with you 
Drunken 
Water, Water 
Oh 

Stop sittin and passin on everything that I'd ever do 
It's not worth to 

I made the chance right by you 
Oh.. Oh Oh!! 
So tired of lettin go 
So tired of lettin go and check 
So tired of lettin go 
I'm so tired 
It's so alright 
Alright
