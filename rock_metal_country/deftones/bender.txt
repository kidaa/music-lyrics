Sweet, contain me around Only To.. I Spit! 

Step on my disease,
So nice to see me bleed
Step on my disease,
I cannot contain 

Slow it Down.. I'm 

So winded,
I've fallen down: again 

Taste.. The numb of my teeth Forever it makes me.. Sick!! 

Step on my disease
So nice to see me bleed
Step on my disease
I cannot contain

Slow it Down.. I'm 

So winded,
I've fallen down: again
I follow the walking dead
Now that you found out somewhat about me,
I wonder how long it will be before you leave

Slow it down.. I'm 

So winded.. 

Slow it down.. 

I've fallen down.. Again 

Slow it Down, I'm 

So winded,
So end it,
I've fallen down.. Again
I follow the walking dead

Spit!
Stupid Fuck..
