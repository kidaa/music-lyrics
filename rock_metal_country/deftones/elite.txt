When you're ripe you'll
bleed out of control
you'll bleed out of control
you like attention
it's proof to you you're alive
stop parading your angles
confused
you'll know when you're ripe
when you're ripe you'll
bleed out of control
you'll bleed out of control
you're pregnant with all this
space thick with honey
but I lost my taste
you're into depression cause
it matches your eyes
stop this faux to be famous
confused
you'll know when you're ripe
