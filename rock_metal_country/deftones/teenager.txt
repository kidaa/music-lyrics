I climbed your arms
then you pulled away
a new cavity moved into
my heart today
the more I scream
the more it seems
that now I'm through
now I'm through
with the new you
I drove you home then
you moved away
new cavity moved into
my heart today
the more she sings
the more it seems that
now I'm through
now I'm through
with the new you
new you
