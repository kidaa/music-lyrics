verse1 
some people think that they can get behind your back 
and they can say whatever they wanna 
but you see i can't let em get away with that 
because it's wrong oh no i'm not gonna 

you can sit and lie in your bed 
you can think and think then come up with an answer 
but people who say foolish things they say 
stupid words that i'd rather not mention 

chorus1 
well it won't get to me the right way is the way 
that i see it won't bring me down it won't 

verse2 
the people learn that the people that think that they can 
get right behind your back and do what they wanna 
oh but you see i can't let em get away with that 
because it's wrong or no i'm not gonna 

you can sit and lie in your bed 
you can think and think then come up with an answer 
but people who say foolish things they say 
stupid words that I'd rather not mention 

chorus2 
well i will not let it be 
judging from the way that i see 
it won't bring me down 
it won't 

bridge 
and they can get behind your back and say what they want 
and think it's right when till the time 
when you get sick of putting up with all them 
well now i'm here in my own mind 
thinking about the way 
i've been accepting these views 
i've always took, am i wasted 

so now i fall down to my death, no 
you came and took it upon your own 
but you can't tame a dog thats dead 
yeah
