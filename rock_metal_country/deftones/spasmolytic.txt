making time in a low rent highrise 
no place to go downtown crushing crucifixion 
particles aching harmful descent take a shot and hide 
subway slam dance stale mattress slow throb bloating 
freshly open grave barefoot beggar 
knotted finger turning pages in a book descending 
no noise the great trees fall 
calmly through the window see backward elevation 
faded spirit of the gold toothed whore 
moon dances wondering how could this ever be 
kicking the habit possesion in the flesh 
loves made up melancholy kicking the habit 
trip back and unleash all anger emerging from 
the waterfall brakh? fork horse rear snorted downward 
a vulgar desire playing cards conjured on fly blown 
dimly lit round a room of shadows claw the side 
phantom pinches waking from a dream half eaten candy 
from some disordered heaven swirling tastes phornicate 
rotted meat a nested virus feels eating dish aging 
she sits alone in the worry shes created more time 
holy hatred kicking the habit
