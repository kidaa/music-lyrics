I've looked outside
But I've never wandered out

I'd like to pull you into me
Intercept you, in between
but I will never walk without, outside

This way, I'll aways stay away from you

I've looked inside
but I never wandered in

I'd like to pull you into me
Intercept you, in between
But I will never wander in, inside

This way, I'll aways stay away from you

Universe, Breaking us down

This way, I'll aways stay away from you
This way, I'll aways stay away from you
yoouuuu, yooouuuu, yoooouuuu....
