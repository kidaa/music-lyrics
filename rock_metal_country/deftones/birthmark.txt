I'd meet you in wrong bury all
Then I would be alright with her
In whole cherished by two
It makes you fly yes I lie
God I'll even lick her f**king picture
In whole drinks won't stain this birth
It's just me I'm born carried lung
Now I could be right with her
In whole cherished by two
It makes you fly yes I lie
Drink one more so I could flow right in her
In whole drinks won't stain this birth
It makes you fly it makes you fly
It makes you fly it makes you fly
Bye I'm gonna ride in the sky
I will ride
Inspite I'll still lie
Inspite I'll still lie
Inspite I'll still lie
Inspite
