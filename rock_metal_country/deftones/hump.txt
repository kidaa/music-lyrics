lately pistols 
and your hair hangs 
blanket over hollow mirror 
we hold black mans hands spy glass 
we carefully mold like water lovers 

no! hear you changing, and i change you, 
tattooed forever make me assist her and i... 

when we lay down by our favorite 
ones who scares me and who could hate her 
likes to degrade our own band aid 
while we disown mother nature 

no! hear you changing, and i change you 
no! and you save me... 

in my room we're can dance on the floor 
in my room we're can dance on my walls 
in my room we're can dance on my bed yeah 
in my room we're gunna dance on my HEAD! 

no! hear you blame me, and i blamed you, 
no! hear you changed me, go! 

no!! hear you blame me, and i blamed you, no!! 
well you changed me, but i made you!! 
remember her...will i stop!?! 
never...will i stop!?!
