Nerve, Here I borned feeding on his lung
Verve, is his curse because he wanted to meet christ alone
Yeah you're no good, we could be so flown
Misunderstood - we could be your god
There in my bones we could be so flown
Misunderstood - because he wanted to meet Christ alone
But you will...
No you will never find me - breach unborn
Never come here watch me burn
Never b*tch cause your scars show
Never will I burn
Under and beneath the floor
Before his face 'cause your no good
We could have been like one
F*ck it
B*tch you feel sore, we could be so flown
Misunderstood, Because he wanted to meet Christ alone
But you will...
No you will never find me - breach unborn
Never sit and watch me burn
Never bitch cause your scars show
Never will I burn, will I burn, will I burn, will I burn
Beg don't even try and you will never
Beg don't even waste your breath
