I'm searching 
Need to find her 
Don't think I know when I'm right beside ya 
Too much social 
I lay down my pride 
From the soul 
Which comes from the inside 

I am? the one who is most high 

Let me ask you 
Cause how's your life? 
I don't know so why must I go 
To the balcony of forgiveness 
And the thought that I must deserve this 
I no lie? 
Just an answer 

I just want what's rightfully mine 

Go! 
Okay! who's the one to say bite the motor white? 
When the body body little chop? 
On the grass hun 
And when you think that you can catch it 
Can I get none 
So on the paw still 
Sing the same note 
And the piece of lock? 
Is where I need you 
I'll just take it 
And like take it 
Shhh... I can. 

This time 
Well I'm buried under the ashes 
All the things that I took for granted 
Do you wonder who wrote the story? 
All have faced the same road before me 

Let me ask just one more time 

Mighty words that try to distract me 
But it's faith that makes us believe thee 
Yes I know but that's not the question 
You're my guide and show me direction 

What we do to hold this time 

Go! 
Okay! who's the one to say bite the motor white? 
When the body body little chop? 
On the grass hun 
And when you think that you can catch it 
Can I get none 
So on the paw still 
Sing the same note 
And the piece of lock? 
Is where I need you 
I'll just take it 
And like take it 
Okay! 

Will I know Untill I dig her? 
When will I know
