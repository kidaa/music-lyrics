I want to sleep if you are awake
Still making believe that you aren't at all crazy
And if you don't believe I think you should
You make me so proud
Still you love to think you have always been this way... but you're all wrong
And you only sleep when you've lost cause
Well I still believe that the cause was always me
And if you don't believe I think you should
You make me so proud
Still you love to think you have always been this way
Well I'd love to think you will someday feel the same
And you love to think it will always...always...
If you still believe it wil always be this way... well you're all wrong
