It's not that I care
truly
but you're that girl
with sharp teeth
who grabs at the walls
and pulls meat down
well here's my new address
6 6 4 oh
I forget
it's not like I care
truly
but you're that girl
with gold teeth
who snaps at the walls
and won't calm down
well here's my new address
6 1 5 oh
I forget
there's all your evidence
now take it home run with it
now write it down
did you get it
well here's my new address
6 6 5 oh
I confess
there's all your evidence
now take it home and have fun with it
