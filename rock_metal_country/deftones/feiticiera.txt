stop I'm drunk
but I'm off my knees
the police stopped chasing 
I'm her new cool meat
she pops the trunk
and she removes me
and a machine that takes
pictures of us
now my jaw and my teeth hurt
I'm choking from gnawing on the ball
and just before I come to move to
the back of the car she makes me
touch the machine
new murderer
first untie me
untie me for now
you said you would, right
and you were right
soon I'll let you go
soon this will be all over
well I hope soon
she sang
so she sang
soon I'll let you go
