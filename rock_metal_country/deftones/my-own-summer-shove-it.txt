hey you, big star, tell me when it's over

hey you, big mood, guide me to shelter
`cause i'm through when the two hits the six and it's summer

cloud
come shove it [x3]
shove shove it [x3]
the sun shove it [x3]
aside shove it aside

i think god is moving it's tongue
there are no crowds in the streets 
and no sun in my own summer 

the shade is a tool, a device, a savior
see, i try and look up to the sky
but my eyes burn 

come shove it [x3]
shove shove it [x3]
the sun shove it [x3]
aside shove it aside
