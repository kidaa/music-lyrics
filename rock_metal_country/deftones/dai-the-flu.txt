i always wondered what it takes fifteen stitches and a soft parody
to make my eyes be like deceit,  believe the sting, proves heart to me

and now i know that you love me
thank god that you love at all
dislocated at the joint timing is everything in the bed
'cause you'll sleep for hours to keep away
then sink the teeth and bat your eyes

now i know that you love me
thank god you love at all

what surprise i was right here going off and going on [repeat]

at least now i know that you love me 
thank god that you love at all 
what surprise i was right here going off going on dai the flu.
