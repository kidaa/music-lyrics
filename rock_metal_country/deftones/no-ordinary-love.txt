I gave you all the love I've got I gave you more than I could give
Gave you love
I gave you all that I had inside and you took my love
You took my love

Didn't I tell you
What I believe
Did somebody say that
A love like ours will last
Didn't I give you all that I got to
Give, Babe

I give you all the love I got I gave you more than I could give
I gave you love
I give you all that I had inside and you took my love
You took my love

I keep trying
I keep trying for you
There's nothing like
You and I
Baby

This is no ordinary love
No ordinary love
Ordinary
This is no ordinary love
No ordinary love
Ordinary love

When you came my way
You brightened every day
With your sweet smile
Ahh

Didn't I tell you
What I believe
Did somebody say that
Love like ours wont' last
Didn't I give you all that I got to
Give, baby

This is no ordinary love
Ordinary love
Ordinary
This is no ordinary love
Ordinary love
Ordinary love

I keep trying

I keep trying
I keep trying for you
There's nothing like
You and I
Baby

This is no ordinary love
No ordinary love
This is no ordinary love
Ordinary love

Keep crying for you
Keep trying for you
Keep crying for you
