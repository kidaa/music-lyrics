i feel soon i will sink into you 
what do you think cause 
there's still blood in your hair 
and i've got the bruise of the year 
but there's something about 
her long shady eyes 
i'm all about her shade tonight 
i hate your tattoos you have weak wrists 
but i'll keep you well it's too bad you're married to me.
