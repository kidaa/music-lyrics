Done feeding, I leaned back head rested on the couch's top
Must leave the house soon mean gone cause my pops he's hot
Grab my blue backpack, My walkman, grip my bicycle
Because I know my friends are waiting at the door
I'm feeling loose like you - Just fucking around and shit
Til that comes fifty-five I'm twenty-six
Let me go I give more
And you know I fold I
Come at me! Come! Come!
My activites don't cross but they create
You know I want to pick you up
But they don't want you to
Asking for it, like we got
Yes we cross but we create
You know I want to pick you up
But they don't want you - so f*ck'em
You let them screw you I thought they knew you
But when you turn your back I know they're gonna do
You had to prove me right and then we did
And that son of a b*tch he swerved almost hit two kids
I'm feeling heartless, I'm feeling hate
So when there's nothin but the real swing in her f*ckin
Rape! No! One! Me! no choice
Let me go I get bored
And you know I'm f*ckin flown!
Come on! Come! Come!
My activities don't cross but they create
You know I want to pick you up
But they don't want you to
Yeah we cross but we create
You know I want to pick you up
But they don't want you - Burn
Let me go I give more
And you know - ohh
So good we could and
We learned to cry and
Lift me up
Come on! Come!
My activities don't cross but they create
You know I want to pick you up
But they don't want you
Dis me court, like we got
Yeah we cross but we cried
You know I want to pick you up
But they don't want you - up!
