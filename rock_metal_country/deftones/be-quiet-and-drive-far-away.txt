This town dont feel mine
I'm fast to get away-FAR 

I dressed you in her clothes
Now drive me far - away, away, away 

It feels good to know your mine
Now drive me far - away, away, away
FAR away
I dont care where just FAR - away [x3]
And I dont care 

FAR - away
And I dont care where just FAR - away [x3]
