I'm searching 
need to find her 
dont think i know when im right beside ya' 
too much social 
i lay down my pride 
from the soul 
which comes from the inside 

I am the one who is most high.......... 

let me ask you Cuz hows your life I dont know 
so why must i go to the balcony of forgiveness 
and the thought that i must deserve this I no lie just an answer 

i just want whats rightfully mine.......... 

go! 
Okay! whos the one to say bite the motor white 
when the body body little chop 
on the grass hun, and when you think that you can catch it can I get none, 
so on the paw still , sing the same note, and the piece of lock 
is where i need you , ill just take it,and like take it, shhh.... i can. 

this time 
well I'm buried under the ashes all the things that i took for granted do you 
wonder who wrote the story all have faced the same road before me 

let me ask just one more time........ 

mighty words that try to distract me but its faith 
that makes us believe thee yes i know but thats not the question your my guide and show me direction 

what we do to hold this time... 

go! 

Okay! 
whos the one to say bite the motor white 
when the body body little chop 
on the grass hun, and when you think that you can catch it can I get none, 
so on the paw still , sing the same note, and the piece of lock 
is where i need you , ill just take it back why wont you see that 
I live in . 

Will i know , untill i dig her.. , when will I know.. when 
will i know......................
