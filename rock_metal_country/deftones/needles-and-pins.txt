How neat. I'm impressed...
how did you come to be so blessed?
You're a star. You blaze...
out like a sharp machine...
Like a whale's moan...
Well I'm here if that's what you want

Here we are - You're pins - I'm needles - Let's play...
Here we are - You want this? - Then come on...
Tune out everyone in the crowd because now it's just me and you
Come fall in love with the sound
Make a pact to each other when no one's around
put the cross between me and you
Who wants to fuck with us now?
