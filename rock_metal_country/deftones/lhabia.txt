somewhere outside there are tricks and evil
holler downstairs while i drive

i want to watch you buttercup
comming through the fog

dying of bordem, i'll try it all

sixteen olive
skin bound by a voice

i dont want to go
but i want it well
at lest you fucking care

dying of bordem, i'll try it all

i'll be faint like a crook
it looks and feels great
but look at what it's doing to you
but thats ok, look how it feels
