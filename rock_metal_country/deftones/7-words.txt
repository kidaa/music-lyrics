I'll never be the same, breaking decency
Don't be tree trunk, don't fall on my living roots
I've been humming too many words, got a weak self esteem
That's been stomped away from every single dream
But it's something else that brought us feaze
Keep it all inside until we feel we can't unleash
I think that you made it up, I think that your mind is gone
I think you shouldn't have glorified, now your wrong
Suck [11x]
They f**k with my head
Suck [10x] b*tch
You and me are here alone face flat along the edge of the glass
But I'm not here to preach, I'm just sick of thugs
My parents made me strong to look up that glass
So why should I try, act like I'm a little pissed off
With all that sh*t that needs to stay back in the shell
Because your punk *ss made it up, your f***ing mind was gone
Shoud've never glorified, now your right
Suck [12x]
They f*ck with my head
Suck [10x]
You don't know me, shut up you don't know me
Squeal like a pig when you big f**kin, big f**kin, ahh!!
Well I'll tell you about my smoke stack
What's coming back jack, We'll turnback
Curse for in their words in their words
Tell them that you f**king heard
I mean, they know that's what's coming nigga and you're a quitter
I thinking 'bout something naughty and won't tell anybody
So thinking of me by now but you go grab it
I'd like to think, for who I down this sh*t
I belong where they be, 'cause we can not get back those lives
We exist to cease, understand
That god hates blacks shades and all the players
Mr. P.I.G cause I f**kin see
Sure already done crushed all of my brothers dignity
And to the jury can't be no turn is all,my skin looks colored
Does that mean I'm burnt
Cause your punk *ss made it up, your f**kin mind was gone
Should've never glorified, WRONG!!
Suck! [12x]
They f*ck with my head
Suck! [10x]
You bad, BOY!
