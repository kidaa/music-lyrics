Remember that one time I bit you on the arm
I was just afraid of solitude and being alone...
I want to be at your house right now, make you stand by the sink,
I swear to keep awake...

I can show you things like fire and more...
Remember the time I kicked the TV over

For months I'm sharing lungs
I can't talk to her
cause she'll throw rocks at me...

I might never see you again
I hope we fix
and stay special cause...
I ain't tryin to start a fight
but if only I could pull you in
for a moment...
I know this pain
that's so sweet
battlestations please guard us...
marry me
but don't lean on me
cause I'll fuck you till the morning
so stay 
Gone!!

For months I'm sharing lungs
I can't talk to her
cause she'll throw rocks at me...

I'll be screaming and all besides
and if you're listening
you'll know
she knows that look when it comes to my music

my lungs are in the top drawer
by now I've got a lover inside of me
as long as we sleep right now
as long as we sleep right now 

For months I'm sharing lungs
I can't talk to her
cause she'll throw rocks at me...
she'll throw rocks at me

For months I'm sharing lungs
I can't talk to her
cause she'll throw rocks at me
