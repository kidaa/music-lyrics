Hey angel Consider Your position
Framed to be consumed Savory Savoring
Your sympathy Hey angel Fly over
And bless me See you feign surprise
I'm all eyes
You're all you
Need to be.
Hey angel Whatever Position
We consider fit To put you in
You'll protest your Complicity
Easy now One hand will wash the other
