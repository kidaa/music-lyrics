So run! 
Right 
Right back to school 
Check it 
Look back I sift through all the cliques 
Roamin' the halls all year, makin' me sick 
While everyone's out tryin' to make the cut. What! 
And when you think you know me right, I switch it up 
Behind the walls, smokin' cigarettes and sippin' vodka 
I profess to catch a cab, ain't noone can stop us 
Give me a break about some other mess what were you 
Go practice everything you got! 

Now push back the square 
Not that you need him 
'Cause you don't 
Well there you go 
Cause back in school 
We are the leaders of it all 

So... 

Stop that... quit 
All that... quit 
Who ruined it 
You did, now grab a notebook and a pen 
Start taking notes, I'm being everyone who's on the top 
You think we're on the same page, but oh, we're not 
I'll be the man watch your back packs and the pencils 
And just like he now 
Flippin' it, why you just keep it simple 
And you just can't go wrong rockin' 
The clothes coppin' the stance 
'Cause really its everything that you got 

Now push back the square 
Not that you need him 
'Cause you don't 
Well there you go 
Cause back in school 
We are the leaders of it all 

Transpose, or stop your lies 
It's what you do 
Transpose or stop your lies 
So run 
So why don't you run, so why don't you run 
So why don't you run back to school 
So why don't you run, so why don't you run 

All you are, now I'm on the next page 
All you are, it's time to close the book up the book up 
All you are, I'm on the next page 
All you are, close the book up now 

Right back to square 
Not that you need him 
'Cause you don't 
Well there you go 
Cause back in school 
We are the leaders of it all 

So... 

Transpose, or stop your lies 
It's what you do 
Transpose or stop your lies 
So run 
So why don't you run, so why don't you run 
So why don't you run back to school 
So why don't you run, so why don't you run
