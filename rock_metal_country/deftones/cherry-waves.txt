A sea of waves
We hug the same plank
Just as I rehearsed over an hour break

The waves suck you in, and you drown

If you'd just stay down with me
I'll swim down with you, you

You hang anchors over my neck
I liked it at first
But the more you laugh - crazy

The waves suck you in, and you drown

If you'd just stay down with me
I'll swim way down with you

Is that what you want?
With you
Is that what you want?

If you'd just stay down with me
I'll swim way down with you

Is that what you want?
With you
Is that what you want?
With you, you
