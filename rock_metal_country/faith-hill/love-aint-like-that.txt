You can't buy it at the store
Try it on for size
Then bring it back if it don't feel right
No love, love ain't like that

You can't trade it in
Like an automobile
That's got too many miles an' rust on it's wheels
No love, love ain't like that

Love ain't that easy to define
You can't build it by design
It takes its own sweet time

It don't fall from the sky
Like a tiny drop of rain
That hits you right between the eyes one day
No love, love ain't like that

You can't put your money down
An' just roll the dice
Think you're gonna win it all some night
No love, love ain't like that

Love ain't that easy to define
You can't build it by design
It takes its own sweet time

You can't buy it at the store
Try it on for size
Bring it back if it don't feel right
No love, love ain't like that

Love, no love, love, love ain't like that
Can't trade it in like an automobile
Too many miles and rust on the wheels
No love, no love no, it ain't like that

Love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Oh love, it ain't like that

It don't fall from the sky
You can't trade it in
Can't buy it at the store
Then take it back again
