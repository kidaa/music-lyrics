When I think back on these times 
And the dreams we left behind 
I'll be glad 'cause I was blessed 
To get to have you in my life 
When I look back on these days 
I'll look and see your face 
You were right there for me 

In my dreams I'll always see you soar above the sky 
In my heart there will always be a place for you 
For all my life I'll keep a part of you with me 
And everywhere I am, there you'll be 

Well you showed me how to feel 
Feel the sky was in my reach 
And I always will remember all the strength you gave to me 
Your love made me make it through 
Oh, I owe so much to you 
You were right there for me 

In my dreams I'll always see you soar above the sky 
In my heart there will always be a place for you 
For all my life I'll keep a part of you with me 
And everywhere I am, there you'll be 

'Cause I always saw in you my light, my strength 
And I want to thank you now 
For all the ways you were right there for me 
You were right there for me 
For always
