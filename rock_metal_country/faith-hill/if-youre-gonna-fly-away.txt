If you're gonna fly away
Don't fly without me
Don't go nowhere
I need you babe

Has the sun gone down on you
Have you given up on truth
I wish I could say hold the right things to make your pain go away
I wish you knew how beautiful you are in every way
When the world is falling down
Just kneel with me and pray

[chorus]

So you take a thousand tears
Hoping to be numb
Lie awake in bed
Counting all that's wrong
No one understands
No one ever will trust me when I tell you
I know just how you feel
You had all these dreams but you're in a small town
Oh,  for you
You had nothing else to do
But use music and music and music and music

[chorus]

Just sing a song for me baby
It's not as bad as it seems, no no no
What matters today won't matter tomorrow
Care all your blessing, settle all your sorrow

[chorus]
