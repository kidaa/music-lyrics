Diggin' around
Feelin' so down
Floatin' around like a feather
Nothin' but me
And all of my dreams
Trying to hold it together
Those were long days
Long days indeed
Could not avoid
I felt no joy
No relief

Everyone knows when that's how it goes it's usually bound to get better
So when you arrived
I looked in your eyes and all I could see was forever
What a fine day
A fine day indeed
When you showed up I fell in love now look at me

I got my baby
I got those good times
Don't lack no sunshine
Baby I got you

Darlin' I find you're blowin' my mind every time that I hold you
Better than gold the deeper we go nobody knows it like I do
These are sweet days
Sweet days indeed
A love that flows will always grow
Now can't you see

I got my baby
I got those good times
Don't lack no sunshine
Baby I got you

Red hot and no blues
Got no more bad news
I got my baby
Baby, I got you

And on and on
Oh what a love affair
And on and on
Oh, I will always be there
Yeah
Oh baby

I got my baby
I got those good times
Don't lack no sunshine
Baby I got you

Red hot and no blues
Got no more bad news
I got my baby
Baby, I got you

I got my baby
I got those good times
Don't lack no sunshine
Baby I got you

Yes, I do
Red hot and no blues
Got no more bad news
