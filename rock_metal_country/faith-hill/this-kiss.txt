It's the way you love me
It's the way you love me
It's the way you love me
It's the way you love me

I don't want another heartbreak
I don't need another turn to cry
I don't want to learn the hard way
Baby hello, oh no, goodbye
But you got me like a rocket
Shooting straight across the sky

It' s the way you love me
It's a feeling like this
It's centrifugal motion
It's perpetual bliss
It's that pivotal moment
It's ah impossible
This kiss, this kiss
Unstoppable
This kiss, this kiss

Cinderella said to Snow White
"How does love get so off course
All I wanted was a white knight
With a good heart, soft touch, fast horse
Ride me off into the sunset
Baby I'm forever yours"

It' s the way you love me
It's a feeling like this
It's centrifugal motion
It's perpetual bliss
It's that pivotal moment
It's ah unthinkable
This kiss, this kiss
Unsinkable
This kiss, this kiss

It's the way you love me
It's the way you love me
It's the way you love me
It's the way you love me

You can kiss me in the moonlight
On the rooftop under the sky, oh
You can kiss me with the windows open
While the rain comes pourin' inside, oh
Kiss me in sweet slow motion
Let's let everything slide
You got me floatin'
You got me flyin'

It's the way you love me
It's the way you love me
It's the way you love me
It's the way you love me

It' s the way you love me
It's a feeling like this
It's centrifugal motion
It's perpetual bliss
It's that pivotal moment
It's ah subliminal
This kiss, this kiss
It's criminal

It' s the way you love me
It's a feeling like this
It's centrifugal motion
It's perpetual bliss
It's that pivotal moment
It's ah subliminal
This kiss, this kiss

It's the way you love me
It's the way you love me
It's the way you love me
It's the way you love me
