Remember when I said the next time would be the last time
That time came this mornin' when you came in
You always had a line to change my mind
So I guess you thought I'd just let you break my heart again

I don't want to stop lovin' you:but I will
I don't like wakin' up alone:but I will
You're the only one who can make my heart stand still
I don't want to let you go:but I will

I could write a book on the innocent looks you're giving me
You've got one for every story you tell
I've seen it all and I'm not gonna fall
For those make believe tears
So, darlin' I will try to make it clear

I don't want to stop lovin' you:but I will
I don't like wakin' up alone:but I will
You're the only one who can make my heart stand still
I don't want to let you go:but I will

You're the only one who can make my heart stand still
I don't want to let you go:but I will
