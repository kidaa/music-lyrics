Tom Hemby/Amy Grant 

Might scare me to death 
Or chill my bones 
Break my heart 
Or warm my soul 
But since I'm here and before I go 
I'm gonna find out who I am 

Late one cold Thanksgiving night 
They welcomed me, another 60's child 
To a family that's holding tight 
That's part of who I am, yeah 

I got a mama who prays for me 
She fights the devil down on her knees 
I can't see all that mama sees 
But it's part of who I am 

She gave me truth and she watched me grow 
I told her lines and I test the rope 
Then I tried a little bit of everything I know 
Just to find out who I am 

Who I am 
Does it matter anyway 
Who I am 
What I've seen along the way 
Who I am 
Changes a little everyday 
With a lot of truth 
And an open heart 
I just want half a chance 
As long as I'm here and before I go 
Just to find out who I am 

Music is my soul's delight 
Comes to me both day and night 
It gives me wings and it gives me flight 
And it's part of who I am 

I hold onto a simple faith 
About the choices and the path I take 
That through the good and the bad mistakes 
I'm gonna find out, yeah 

Who I am 
Does it matter anyway 
Who I am 
What I've lost along the way 
Who I am 
It changes a little everyday 
With a lot of truth 
And an open heart 
I just want half a chance 
As long as I'm here and before I go 
Just to find out 

Did it ever really matter 
In that big forever plan 
Who I am and what I'm here for I don't know 
Is it wrong to want an answer 
Try to understand 

Who I am 
Does it matter anyway 
Who I am 
What I've learned along the way 
Who I am 
It changes a little everyday 
With a lot of truth 
And an open heart 
I just want half a chance 
As long as I'm here and before I go 
Just to find out 
Who I am 

Who I am
