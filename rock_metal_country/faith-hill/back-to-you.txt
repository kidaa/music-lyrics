Baby I'm gonna find my way back to you

I'm lying in dirt watching these shadows dancing across the walls
Nothing to do but think of you and count the tears that fall
Oh how I wish it was real
I wish I could feel you holding me close
Oh I think I know for sure
I should've never let you go

I would walk the world across the sea
A journey beyond the moon
I'll try anything go anywhere
To find my way back to you

I still don't understand the reason
I think I was just afraid what can I say
All I can do is to face the truth
And deal with the mess that I made
Now what I want is a chance to take it back and go home like this oh
Ever since we said goodbye
We have been lost in loneliness

I would walk the world across the sea
A journey beyond the moon
I'll try anything go anywhere
To find my way back to you
Now baby I was wrong now that you're gone
The only thing left to do is spend every day try every way
To find my way back to you

I know that I was a fool to push you away
And if you let me back in your life
Baby I swear all my heart and in your arms I will stay

Baby you're the only one
Baby, journey beyond the moon
I'll try anything go anywhere
To find my way back to you
Baby I was wrong now that you're gone
The only thing left to do is spend every day try every way
To find my way back to you
Find my way back to you
Wanna come back to you

Baby I'm gonna find my way back to you, back to you
