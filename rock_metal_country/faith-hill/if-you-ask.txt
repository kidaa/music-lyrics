Well i've come to know the look on your face
When you're lying about where you've been
Or how much you spent

I know when you will raise your fingers
To your mouth as if to wipe away the shame
It's not a game i know you feel bad

[chorus]
If you ask for my forgiveness
If you call my name i will come
If you ask for my love i will give you some

Someday i know you will understand
Someday you'll finally realize
What you're doing to yourself

[chorus]

We've been dancing to 
That same old song over and over again
I want to be your lover
I don't want to be your policeman

So tonight when you finally make
Your way back to our door
I'll let you sleep it off like i did the night before

When you ask for my forgiveness
When you call my name i will come
When you ask for my love i will give you some

In the morning i will get you up and
I will smile just when you want me to
Cause i'm, i'm all you have
