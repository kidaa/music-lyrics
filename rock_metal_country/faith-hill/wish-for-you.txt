A setting sun that paints a tie-dyed sky
A feather bed, an ancient lullaby
A kiss good night from one whose love is true
That's the kind of day i wish for you

A field of flowers dancing in the spring
A little creek, a tree, an old rope swing
Cotton candy clouds against the blue
That's the kind of day i wish for you

First love with all its storm
Raging like fire within
Tossing your heart to chance 
You swear the dance will never end

But then it does and someone says goodbye
And after all those empty nights you cried
The morning that you wake up good as new
That's the kind of day i wish for you

The faith of knowing deep inside your heart
That heaven holds more than just some stars
Someone's up there watching over you
That's the kind of day i wish for you
