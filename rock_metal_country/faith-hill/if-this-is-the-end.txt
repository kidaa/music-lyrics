Our love is the moon
Our love is the kingdom come
Our love is a flame
Our love is a will be done
Our love is a jewel, a diamond and rough
But you don't want it
You don't wanna take

[Chorus:]
If this is the end
I don't wanna know
This time
If this is the end
I don't wanna go home
This time
If this is the end

Our love is true
Our love is the rising sun
Our love is in bloom
Our love has just begun yeah
Our love is proof of what was yet to come
But you don't want it
You don't wanna take

[Chorus]

It was so easy
We were so young
It's only natural to come undone
At the end of this evening before the rise of the sun
You're coming with me
You're coming with me yeah

[Chorus]

I don't wanna know
I just want you back my side
If this is the end
I don't wanna know
I just want you back
Lord I want you back my side
Oh yeah yeah yeah...
I don't wanna know
I just want you back
