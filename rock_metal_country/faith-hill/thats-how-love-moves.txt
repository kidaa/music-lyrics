It's such a mystery
How you found something in me
That I never knew was there
But you uncovered it so easily
You turn me like the season
And I began to change
You wrapped your arms around me
Now I'll never be the same

That's how love works
That's how love moves
Like a river running through you
Sometimes it lifts you high as Heaven
It consumes you
That's a given
That's how love moves

I've seen walls that could never be broken
Come tumbling down
I've heard the voice of love calling
Without making a sound
See I was touched by an angel
The day you took my hand
You know that you're the miracle
That makes me everything I am

That's how love works
That's how love moves
Like a river running through you
Sometimes it lifts you
As high as Heaven
It consumes you
That's a given
That's how love moves

Sometimes it's a whisper
Sometimes it's a storm
Sometimes it reaches forever
With it's everlasting arm

That's how love works
That's how love moves
Like a river running through you
Sometimes it lifts you
As high as Heaven
It consumes you

That's how love works
That's how love moves
Like a river running through you
Sometimes it lifts you
As high as Heaven
It consumes you
Oh, that's a given
That's how love moves
Baby, yeah
High as Heaven
That's how love moves
As high as Heaven
