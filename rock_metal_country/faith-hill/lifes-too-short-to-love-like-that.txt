Baby we had something goin' wrong
I've never seen nothin' so right go wrong
You used to wanna love me day and night
We used to never wanna leave paradise
Now we sleep at night back to back
Life's too short to love like that

You never wanna kiss me anymore
You run around and I walk the floor
You know I used to mean everyting to you
Not I'm last in line and that just won't do
I feel blue, you feel trapped
Life's too short to love like that

You put me down just to stand me up
Time after time, well enough's enough
I give and give without gettin' back
Life's too short to love like that
Life's too short to love like that

It's way too late for a wake-up call
And I ain't gonna wait for those tears to fall
I used to think we could work things out
But if you don't wanna change then there's no doubt
The fire is out and that's so sad
Life's too short to love like that

You put me down just to stand me up
Time after time, well enough's enough
I give and give without gettin' back
Life's too short to love like that
Life's too short to love like that
