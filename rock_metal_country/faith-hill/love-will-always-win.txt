Hold me like there's no tomorrow 
There can be no sorrow 
Right here where we stand 
Living only for a moment 
All I ever wanted 
Is right here in my hands 

Some will say 
That we're sure to fall 
Try to build their walls 
Between us, yeah 

No way over it 
No way around it, boy 
If we want it 
We have to go through it 
Fight for love 
And the world tries 
To break us down 
But the world will bend 
And the fight will end 
Love will always win 

Hold on 'til we see tomorrow 
There is time to borrow 
'Til we our on own 
Walk on and our hearts will lead us 
But our hearts will need us 
To be steady and strong 

So we can stand 
And face the fire 
Burning higher 
Surrounding us, yeah 

No way over it 
No way around it, boy 
If we want it 
We have to go through it 
Fight for love 
And the world tries 
To break us down 
Oh, the world will bend 
And the fight will end 
Love will always win 

No way over it 
No way around it 
If we want it 
We have to go through it 
Fight for love 
And the world tries 
To break us down 
But the world will bend 
Ooh, and the fight will end 
The world will bend 
And the fight will end 
Love will always win 

Oh, oh, oh, yeah 
Love will always win, ooh 
Oh hoah 
Love will always win, ooh
