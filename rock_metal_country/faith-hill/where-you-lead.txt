Carole King/Toni Stern 

Wanting you the way I do 
I only want to be with you 
And I would go 
To the ends of the earth 
Cause, darling 
To me that's what 
You're worth 

Where you lead, I will follow 
Anywhere that you tell me to 
If you need, you need me to be with you 
I will follow where you lead 

If you're out on the road 
Feeling lonely, and so cold 
All you have to do is call my name 
And I'll be there on the next train 

Where you lead, I will follow 
Anywhere that you tell me to 
If you need, you need me to be with you 
I will follow where you lead 

I always wanted a real home 
With flowers in the window sill 
But if you want to live in New York City 
Honey, you know I will 

I never thought I could get satisfaction 
From just one man 
If anyone can keep me happy 
You're the one who can 

Where you lead, I will follow 
Anywhere that you tell me to 
If you need, you need to be with you 
I will follow 

Where you lead, I will follow 
Anywhere that you tell me to 
If you need, you need to be with you 
I will follow where you lead 
Oh, yes I will 

Oh, I'm gonna follow where you lead 
I'm gonna follow where you lead 
Oh, I'm gonna follow where you lead 
I will follow 
I will follow 

Oh, yes I will
