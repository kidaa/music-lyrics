So much pain and no good reason why 
Cried until the tears run dry 
And nothing else can make you understand 
The one thing that you held so dear 
Is slipping from your hand 
And you say... 

Why, why, why does it go this way 
And why, why, why and all I can say is 
Somewhere down the road 
There'll be answers to the questions 
Somewhere down the road 
Though we cannot see it now 
And somewhere down the road 
You will find mighty arms reaching for you 
And they will have the answers 
At the end of the road, ooh, ooh 

Yesterday I thought I'd seen it all 
I thought I climbed the highest wall 
Now I see the learning never ends 
And all I know to do is keep on walking 
'Round the bend 
Singing....

Why, why, why does it go this way 
Why, why, why and all I can say is 
Somewhere down the road 
There'll be answers to the questions 
Somewhere down the road 
Though we cannot see it now 
And somewhere down the road 
You will find mighty arms reaching for you 
And they will hold the answers 
At the end of the road 
Somewhere, somewhere down 

Somewhere down the road 
There'll be answers to the questions 
Somewhere down the road 
Though we cannot see it now 
And somewhere down the road 
You will find mighty arms reaching for you 
And they will have the answers 
At the end of the road 
They will have the answers 
At the end of the road, yeah 

Somewhere down the road ooh, ooh 
Somewhere, somewhere, ooh 
Somewhere, somewhere 
Somewhere down the road 
Why, why, why 
Mighty arms reaching 
Down the road 
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, ooh
