What if no one would kill for their religion
What if no one ever had to go to war
What if the children of the world made world decisions
Paint-by-number hatred wasn't hanging around anymore

Is everything a-ok in the usa
In the good ole usa
Is everything a-ok in the usa
In the good ole usa

It's like everything and nothing leads to wisdom
It's like no one really means what they say
While we fight for peace & die for our freedom
I guess we'll leave it to our children to find a better way

Is everything a-ok in the usa
In the good ole usa
Is everything a-ok in the usa
In the good ole usa

[repeat chorus]

I know that i, i'm just a dreamer
A common man, schemer
Looking for light
Out of the dark night of my soul

I hear the drums of war, they are a changing
And everybody's getting in the groove
We're laughing and dancing and talking and jammin' and singin'
Oh, we've got nothin' but love to prove, so how about you

Is everything a-ok in the usa
In the good ole usa
Is everything a-ok in the usa
In the good ole usa
