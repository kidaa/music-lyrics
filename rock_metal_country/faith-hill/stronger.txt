This is the window to my heart
I just want us to be for real
There ain't no freedom where we are
Ain't no wishes in these stars
Ain't no reasons to believe
But don't worry baby
Don't you worry
Maybe this is what we need
A little bruise and a little bleeding
Some space that we can't breathe in
Some silence in between

[Chorus:]
So cry for me baby
And I'll cry for you
And we'll both break down and we'll both break through
Find our way you will face the truth
We both will be stronger
And we'll lie down in a loneliness
Wake up with our sad regrets
Even know we don't know it yet
We both will be stronger
We both will be stronger

I can't believe you're really gone now
But I know it's all the best
And I know that we were right
But I still reach for you each night
In midnight it hurts like hell

[Chorus]

So baby

[Chorus]

This is the window to my heart
I just want us to be for real
Baby I'm sorry for the way things are
Get back is always hard
And we both will be stronger
