I've tried with all my mind
But still don't understand why we ever let it get so out of hand
My arms are reaching out and holding on tight
To what it always felt so right
It's hard to figure out the answers to the questions
Wind blow the light as you go on a separate direction

The world is breaking into two
And my heart is turning blue
And you still don't get it, do you, do you
I thought we had all the love to go with for the long run
So before the damage is done
Let's start back over as one

Lights out when every evening used to get so hot
Now we got  that we forgot
How to lock the world away and just get lost in where you're in where I begin
Love is strong but it's so easy to divide
Support I think about
How much is all the life
