[Spoken:]
I love the way you stand in my way
You won't move 'til you get a yes
And how you tell me that my name
It tastes so sweet on your lips
I love the way you hold me with your eyes
Hold me so tight that I can't move
It's like everything I've ever known is alive
And you're the simple truth I know

Is it a dream or is it real
All I know is you make me feel so beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
You make me feel so beautiful Feel like I could die
Beautiful Trust the grant of sky
Beautiful Baby I could cry
You make me feel so beautiful

[Spoken:]
I love how soft you touch my skin
Like you're touch the wings of a butterfly
I wish we could just lock ourselves away in a room
But there was no such thing in this town
I've never let anyone get this close
I've always been afraid
But you break down every wall and you know I feel so safe

Every part of who I am
Is so in love cause what I have is beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
You make me feel so beautiful Feel like I could die
Beautiful Trust the grant of sky
Beautiful Baby I could cry
You make me feel so beautiful
Beautiful...
You make me feel so beautiful When you touch my face
Beautiful When you say my name
Beautiful Always find the way
You make me feel so
Beautiful
