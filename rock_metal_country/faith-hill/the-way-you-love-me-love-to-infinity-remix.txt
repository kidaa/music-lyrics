If I could grant you one wish 
I wish you could see the way you kiss 
Ooh, I love watching you baby 
When you're driving me, ooh, crazy 

Ooh I love the way 
You love the way you love me 
The way that you laugh and breathe and smile 
  When you touch me, drives me wild 
There's nowhere else I'd rather be 
Ooh, to feel the way I feel 
With your arms around me 
I melt and spin and fall again 
I only wish that you could see 
The way you love me love me 
Whoa oh oh, the way you love me love me 

It's not right, it's not fair 
What you're missing over there 
Someday I'll find a way to show you 
Just how lucky I am to know you 

Ooh I love the way 
You love the way you love me 
The way that you laugh and breathe and smile 
  When you touch me, drives me wild 
There's nowhere else I'd rather be 
Ooh, to feel the way I feel 
With your arms around me 
I melt and spin and fall again 
I only wish that you could see 
The way you love me love me 
Whoa oh oh, the way you love me love me 

You're the million reasons why 
There's love reflecting in my eyes 

Ooh I love the way 
You love the way you love me 
The way that you laugh and breathe and smile 
  When you touch me, drives me wild 
There's nowhere else I'd rather be 
Ooh, to feel the way I feel 
With your arms around me 
I melt and spin and fall again 
I only wish that you could see 
The way you love me love me 
Whoa oh oh, the way you love me love me 

Whoa oh oh, the way you love me love me 
Whoa oh oh, the way you love me 
Oh, the way you love me 
The way you love me 
Oh yeah 
Woah yeah 
The way you love me 
Who oh oh, the way you love me 
Whoa oh oh, the way you love me 
Whoa oh oh, the way you love me 
The way you love me
