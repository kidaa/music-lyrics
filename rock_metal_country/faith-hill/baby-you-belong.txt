There's a reason why
You can look up every night
Every star in heaven is in its place
There's a reason why
The ferment pulls up tight
And waves rolling to a shore that always wades
And just like that

[Chorus:]
Baby you belong
Oh, baby you belong
Nothing's ever been so meant to be
You ever felt so right to me
Every single part of me believes
Baby you belong
Oh, baby you belong
There really is no mystery
I think anyone can see
That baby you belong with me

There's a voice in the silence
And I heard it from 
When you came along
I know you by heart
Like a familiar song
Every word is telling me
That the time has finally come
Now here you are
And I know for sure

[Chorus]

Like the sun belongs up in the morning sky
For at least another million reasons why
Yeah...Oh...
