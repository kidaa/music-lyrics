I think I will

What would you say if I said something strange to make a difference
And how you feel
What would you do if I did something out of the blue
To make the world a better place
Oh I think I will

Gonna change for a break
Gonna take your heart and make it mine this time
Oh I, I think I will
I'm gonna run til I find another way to make you mine in time
Oh I, I think I will
I think I will

What would you give if I give you everything
And that's for nothing
How would you feel
What would you think if I thought about doing something good
Yeah just to make you smile
Oh I think I will

Taking it slow
Putting a right goal
More like no other think I will

Oh how positive
I think I will
