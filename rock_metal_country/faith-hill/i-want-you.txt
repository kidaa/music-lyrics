The eagle wants a canyon 
And a place where he can rest his wings a while
The drifter wants a freight train
That will carry him another hundred miles
The lion's only lookin' for something he can sink his teeth into
Oh and i want you

The devil wants a fella 
With a weakness he can wrap his arms around
The champion wants a challenger
Who just might have the strength to take him down
The river wants an ocean to run towards 
And pour its heart into
Oh and i want you

Oh, every time that i'm around you
Oh, i'm on fire when we touch
Oh, when i hold you boy you know
I can't get close enough
Yes i want you

I could cry and say i need you
Tell you that i die when you're not here
I could lie and say i love you
Pour a little poison in your ear
But all i'm gonna give you is
Nothing but the bare and naked truth
Baby i want you
Baby i want you
