It's quiet here tonight
There's a light burnin' far away
It burns in my heart
In the rain, in the dark
Well, this girl's gonna have her day

I've been this alone for so long
I'm beginning to wonder why
I stand in one place
Different name, different face
But no one's gonna see me
Break down and cry

Won't somebody stand by me
Stand by me just one time
Won't somebody stand by me
Stand by me just one time

Lord, I don't understand
What's slipping through these hands
You'd think by now I'd know when to let go
Here I am
Won't somebody stand, stand by me

I'm not bending tonight
But I'm twisted and turned and broken down
I'm starting to know the sound
Of nothing and no one and yet everything

Well, if God's here tonight
Are You here tonight
Maybe You could grab me up
Lord, stand me on my feet
Give me strength and set me free
'Cause I'm not giving in until I've had enough

Won't somebody stand by me
Stand by me just one time
Won't somebody stand by me
Stand by me just one time

Oh, I don't understand
What's slipping through these hands
You'd think by now I'd know when to let go
So here I am
And I'm throwing down my one last hope
Here I am
Won't somebody stand, stand by me

Stand by me, stand by me just one time
Won't somebody stand by me just one time
I don't understand
What's slipping through these hands
You'd think by now I'd know when to let go
Here I am
And I'm throwing down my one last hope

Won't somebody stand by me just one time
Won't somebody stand by me just one time
I don't understand
What's slipping through these hands
You'd think by now I'd know when to let go
Here I am
