You've worn the soles off both your shoes
Walkin' on me like ya do
This ain't what forever's for
And i ain't gonna take it
I ain't gonna take it anymore

I've cried and begged and cursed and prayed
But nothing's worked, nothing's changed
No way i win when you keep score
And i ain't gonna take it
I ain't gonna take it anymore

[Chorus:]
I'm gonna crawl out from this stone that i've been under
To see the light and breathe the air
And you'll have a million reasons why i shouldn't leave you
But for the first time in a long time i don't care

I guess on one hand you should laugh
'cause i've said the same things in the past
But this time one hand's on the door
And i ain't gonna take it
I ain't gonna take it, anymore

[repeat chorus]

Now i can't help but think of you
Lookin' back in my rear view
But i've been down that road before
And i ain't gonna take it
I ain't gonna take it anymore
I ain't gonna take it
I ain't gonna take it anymore
