Didn't I make you feel
Like you were the only man
And didn't I give you everything
That a woman possibly can
Each time I tell myself I think I've had enough
Well I'm gonna show you baby that a woman can be tough
So come on, come on, come on and

Take it
Take another little piece of my heart now baby
I know you will
Break it
Break another little piece of my heart now baby
'Cause you know you got it if it makes you feel good, so good

You're out on the street lookin' good
Baby deep down in your heart you know that it ain't right
No you'll never hear me cryin'
You know I cry all the time
Each time I tell myself that I can't stand the pain
You hold me in your arms and I start singin' once again
So come on, come on, come on and

Take it
Take another little piece of my heart now baby
I know you will
Break it
Break another little piece of my heart now baby
'Cause you know you got it if it makes you feel good, so good

Each time I tell myself that I can't stand the pain
You hold me in your arms and I start singin' once again
So come on, come on, come on

Take it
Take another little piece of my heart now baby
I know you will
Break it
Break another little piece of my heart now baby
'Cause you know you got it if it makes you feel good, so good
