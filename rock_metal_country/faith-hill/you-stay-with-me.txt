Tv flashes down the hall
Painting pictures on the wall
And you're still sleeping on my knees
And in the glow of silver light
I trace the lines above your eyes
Just another wrinkle that you can blame on me

But i can hear the current of the freeway in the distance
If i keep listening
And i wonder if you ever thought of streaming off
Somewhere with it
Am i not what you thought
Will you get tired of what you got

[Chorus:]
If i can't give you anymore
Than weathered ships and distant shores
Would you still be my compass
'cause you keep loving me the same
I don't know how but you still stay with me, baby
You stay with me, baby

Another day, another week
We'll slip back in old routines
'til nights like these come in between
Simple moments in the dark
Ones that life can't tear apart
They come along just when we need

And i still hear the current of the freeway in the distance
But i stop listening
'cause i know you'll stay even though the waves are always shifting

We're fighting our way through
I guess i always knew
