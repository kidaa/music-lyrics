We've got barefoot ladies and tricked out mercedes
And people getting crazy on the boulevard
We've got classic colas and ice cold corona's
And big pool parties in the back yard

[chorus]
Hey that's the way we do it
New friends and blue skies that never end
Hey that's the way we like it
Good times, sunshine and summertime

You'll see straw sombreros and t-top cameros
And stereos blastin' in the parking lot
You'll see rock hard bodies and bikini hotties
And everybody's got it goin' on
And showin' what they've got

[chorus]

Hey everybody can't you feel the rhythm now
Hey everybody don't you want to party
Hey everybody can't you feel the rhythm now
Hey everybody don't you wanna party
[chorus]
