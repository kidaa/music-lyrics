Promise that you always will 
Keep candles lit on the windowsill 
You know I'll be comin' home 

You know I never wanted to go away 
But what am I supposed to say 
When I hear the sounds of the trumpet call 
Who says 

All is fair in love and war 

Your pictures kept close to my heart 
Letters all but fall apart 
Each night I read them over again 

You know I never wanted to go away 
But what am I supposed to say 
When I hear the sounds of the trumpet call 
Who says 

You know I never wanted to go away 
I swear 
Its war
