The praise leaves me
Feeling empty
I wrap it inside
A broken frown...
The dragged realm making deal resting another hell
Time is now and a baby in myself
You think it's over?
I've come to fall back down now
You think it's over?
My time to rise above you...
It's time to rise above you...
We've come...
We've...
Full Circle!
It's time to rise above you...
My time to rise above you...
When I dream
I'm prevising
I'm perfect ending...
I'm perfect now...
Worry more...
Worry more...
Worry freights...
Worry freights...
Wake up time for a simple mani-bullshit...
You think it's over?
I've come to fall back down now
You think it's over?
My time to rise above you...
It's time to rise above you...
We've come...
We've come...
Full Circle!
It's time to rise above you...
My time to rise above you...
My life
Cried at doors...
Cried at doors...
My life
At nothing at all...
Yeah!
You think it's over...
You think it's over!
I've come to fall back down now
You think it's over!
My time to rise above you...
It's time to rise above you...
We've come...
We've come...
Full Circle!
It's time to rise above you...
My time to rise above you...
Rise above you...
Rise!
Rise above you!
Rise! Rise!
Rise above you!
Rise above you!
