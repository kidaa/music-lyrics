Can you see can you see, can you see?
Can't you see, how easily
I'm consumed by you, no I don't need you

Every chance I get to taste the sweat on the back of your neck
I risk a heart attack
And every chance I get to kiss that neck
You know I'll take it, take it
You know I'll break it, break it

Can't you see, how easily
I can be consumed by you, no, so I don't need you

I don't need your love, love, love
I don't need you, no, so I don't need your love
I don't need your love, love, love
I need to break free, your heart strings strangle me
Your heart strings strangle

Well I don't need the way you bleed
The rights and the wrongs from me
Your love is so obscene
And on my heart I leave the blame upon
I know you'll take it, take it
I know you'll break it, break it

Can't you see, how easily
I can be consumed by you, no, so I don't need you

I don't need your love, love, love
I don't need you, no, so I don't need your love
I don't need your love, love, love
I need to break free, your heart strings strangle me
Your heart strings strangle

Can't you see can't you see, can you see me?
Can't you see, my world don't revolve around
Now can't you see can't you see, how easily
I can't be consumed by you, no, so I don't need you

I don't need your love, love, love
I don't need you, no, so I don't need your love
I don't need your love, love, love
I need to break free, free
I don't need your love, love, love
I don't need you, no, so I don't need your love
I don't need your love, love, love
I need to break free, your heart strings strangle me
