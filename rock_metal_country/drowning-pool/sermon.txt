Where was God when I needed a friend
Where was God when I came to an end
Where was God when I lost my mind
Where was God when I couldn't find
Don't want to be up or down
Where was love when I felt like hate
Where was hate when I felt like love
Where were you when you said you'd be there
Where was the fear when I said I was scared

Tell me what you believe 
I'll tell you what you should see 
'Cause I don't know who to trust 
My heart is filled with disgust
I can't take this
Ladies and Gentlemen
May I have your attention
Are you ready for the joke
Are you ready for the great deception
