And just before you fade out to 
I will hold a place for you 

Do you rememeber when we used to 
Do you rememeber when you used to 
Do you remember life 
Well, as you're led out to the slaughter 
You ought to 

Think about your life you wouldn't give it up 
Before you're led off to the slaughter 
You ought to 

And just as soon as you will find 
That all of this became your life 

Do you remember when we used to 
Do you remember when you used to 
Do you remember life 

Before you're led off to the slaughter 
You ought to 

And just as soon as all of this so 
All of this so pure 

Do you ever stop 
Fucking think
