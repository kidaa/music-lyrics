Right now
Here I am understand
With this comes frustration
A better way to follow through
I'm far from done
The truth is right there in front of you
A better way to follow through
I'm far from done
The truth is right there in front of me
Realize through my eyes
I can't speak so damn weak
The face before me shows what my life will be
Everybody knows everyone but me
Better
Follow
The truth is right there in front of you
Better
Follow
The truth is right there in front of me
