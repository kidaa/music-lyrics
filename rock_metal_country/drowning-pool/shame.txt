Straight through you
I burn, I burn
My tongue rhymes one thing, for eager ears to hold on to
You know I'll lie again
You know I'll try again
My words, ripping, tearing, straight through you

I, I turn my back on you and I will, I will, I will shame you, shame you
I, I've got no time for you and I will, I will, I will shame you, shame you

I burn, I burn
Let me touch you, let me get inside you
All I feel, I can make it feel all so real
You know I'll lie again
You know I'll try again
My words, ripping, tearing, straight through you

I, I turn my back on you and I will, I will, I will shame you, shame you
I, I've got no time for you and I will, I will, I will shame you, shame you

No, don't you speak my name
Don't you speak my name, I'm pain
Don't you speak my name, don't you speak my name

I, I turn my back on you and I will, I will shame you, shame you
And I, won't hold against you if you never, never, never speak my name again

I, I turn my back on you and I will, I will, I will shame you, shame you
I, I've got no time for you and I will, I will, I will shame you, shame you

Don't you speak my name, I will shame you, shame you
