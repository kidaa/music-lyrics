My life served on a plate
For all of you to eat
Take my love and hate
But what is this inside of me
Pity me pity me don't you pity me
Under everything something that you can't see
I can't even believe something is wrong with me
You swear that all of this is real
But sometimes I can't seem to feel
Nothing ever satisfies
One day I will realize
Am I really scared of something that I don't know
Do you even care
What is really wrong
