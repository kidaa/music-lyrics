Yeah

Hands raised full of sin, this is where the story began
As my halo, I'm scarred by where I've been

This aint over, till it's over
This aint over, till it's over, yeah

The hell I've been through, I saw my face in the bottom of a bottle
The hell I've gone through, to be reborn, reborn, again
The hell I've been through, shot down, ran through, dragged through
The hell I've gone through, to be reborn, reborn, again, again

Tear away, redefine
Bring me down, this life
Take what's wrong and make it right
Crucified every time I tried

This aint over, roll me over
This aint over, till it's, till it's over

The hell I've been through, I saw my face in the bottom of a bottle
The hell I've gone through, to be reborn, reborn, again
The hell I've been through, shot down, ran through, dragged through
The hell I've gone through, to be reborn, reborn, again, again

This love, this hate, this game
Don't want to remember
Made numb, mute, unreal
I can't forget, I can't forget
No, I won't, I can't forget

Yeah, good god damn
The hell I've been through, I saw my face in the bottom of a bottle
The hell I've gone through, to be reborn, reborn, again
The hell I've been through, shot down, ran through, dragged through
The hell I've gone through, to be reborn, reborn, again, again

Reborn, reborn, yeah I'm reborn again
I won't forget, no
