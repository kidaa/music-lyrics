So you think that you got it all figured out 
I told you, you've got no clue what it is all about 
Now you want to cling to the next big thing 
Be part of the scene and ride the big machine 
Well it aint gonna work out that way 
Now you want to cling to the next big thing 
Be part of the scene and ride the big machine 
Well it aint gonna work out that way 

What, who, where were you when I was down on my luck you know you never gave a fuck 
You just cast me aside 
What who where were when I needed you, 
You know you never came through 
And now you want to come along for the ride 

I told you I know you as well as you think you do 
I'll show you just how easy you are to see straight through 

Now you want to cling to the next big thing 
Be part of the scene and ride the big machine 
Well it aint gonna work out that way 
Now you want to cling to the next big thing 
Be part of the scene and ride the big machine 
Well it aint gonna work out that way 

What, who, where were you when I was down on my luck you know you never gave a fuck 
You just cast me aside 
What ,who, where were when I needed you 
You know you never came through 
And now you want to come along for the ride 

Nothing to me, you're nothing to me [x4]

What, who, where, were you? [x4]

What, who, where were you when I was down on my luck? 
You know you never gave a fuck
You just cast me aside
What ,who, where were when I needed you?
You know you never came through
And now you want to come along for the ride

For the ride [x3]

Now you wanna come along for the ride
