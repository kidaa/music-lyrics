Down too long like I was before
And I've never thought I'd see the day
Can't be wrong 'cause I know the score
And I guess there is no other way
Reminded of you
Reminded
There it is all in black and white
And it looks like that's the way it goes
Doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
'Cause by now I'm sure that I know
Never felt so undecided
Everything I've ever had has been taken away
Little boy so scared and frightened
All of the things that have happened I'm surely to blame
Accept your fate then you'll be well but the truth is that it never ends
You can say that you've been through hell
But you'll always lose another friend
Never felt so unimportant
Everything I've ever said has been taken in vain
Little girl so scared and frightened
All of the things that I do are still subject to change
