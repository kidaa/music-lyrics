Trying to find a way to fight the pain
But it seems, there's no way around it
Reaching for the sun and finding rain
I melt, I'll always be grounded
so much I have brought upon my self
Can't, believe that I'm still here
Looking for a place you know so well
You see, it never resisted
I will break you
I will break you
I will break you
I will break you
break you
break
All this time, I reall though you knew
The game was not meant for winning
explination for the things I do
No, but I'm constanly grinning
I will break you
I will break you
I will break you
I will break you
I will break you
Could you ever recognize this pain
You see, it's so far from over
I don't guess you'll never be the same
You know I'm choking on knowledge
I will break you
I will break you
I will break you
I will break you
I will break you
I will break you
I will break you
I will break you
I will break you
I will break you
I will break you
I will break you
