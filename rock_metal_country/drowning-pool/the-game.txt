Time to play the Game
Time to play the Game
Time to play... THE GAME!

It's all about The Game, before life can rest...
Your failure is my success...
It's all about control... will you make it?
I WILL DELIVER THE PAIN YOU CAN'T TAKE IT!

I'm in control, I Am Your Pain...
After this you won't be the same...
This is My Time, I make the rules.
YOU MESS WITH THIS AND YOU DIE LIKE A FOOL!

Pain!
Here comes the pain!
Pain!
Here comes the pain!
Pain!
Here comes the pain!
Pain!
Here comes the pain!
Time to play the Game!

I am the debt that can't be paid...
You're going down in flames...
This is the time I cannot lose.
LIVE OR DIE YOU'LL HAVE TO CHOOSE!

It's all about me, I am The One...
Soon you'll see there's nowhere to run...
I am the threat that is so real.
THROUGH THE BLOOD AND THE SWEAT, THE PAIN YOU WILL FEEL!

Pain!
Here comes the pain!
Pain!
Here comes the pain!
Pain!
Here comes the pain!
Pain!
Here comes the pain!

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide...
Now it's time to die...
I am the pain, I am The Game...
YOU WON'T FORGET MY NAME!

Time to feel the pain
Time to feel the pain
Time to feel the pain
GO!

TIME TO PLAY THE GAME!
TIME TO PLAY THE GAME!
TIME TO PLAY THE GAME!
TIME TO PLAY THE GAME!

Pain!
Here comes the pain!
Pain!
Here comes the pain!
Pain!
Here comes the pain!
Pain!
Here comes the pain!
Pain!
Time to play the Game!

Time to play the Game!
