Everyday, always the same 
I hear your name and it cuts through me like a chainsaw 
And I fall back into that simple fool you always knew 

And just as soon as I let you back in 
Seems I'm reminded of all of this again 
I can't believe that I let you walk all over me
And I can't believe that you had such a hold on me 

Bringing me down 
You're bringing me down
You're bringing me... 

How much more will it take 
'till I break 
And I dived that stake 
Right into that think that you call your heart 
Hell it's fallen apart 
And I don't think it worked right from the start 

Just as soon as I let you back in 
Seems I'm reminded of all of this again 
I can't believe that I let you walk all over me
And I can't believe that you had such a hold on me 

[x2]
Bringing me down 
You're bringing me down
You're bringing me down, down, down

[x2]
I can't believe that I let you walk all over me 
I can't believe that you had such a hold on me 

[x4]
You're bringing me down
