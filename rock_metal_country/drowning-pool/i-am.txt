I've never felt so alive
I've never had to run and hide
The things I want I cannot have
The things I need are all so bad
What you say
I could've been
I am
You could've been
You are
My best excuse is that I'm drained
From everything that keeps me sane
My sickness keeps me in control
From everything you'll never know
Does it make you happy
Does it make you mad
Why am I still laughing
Look at what you had
Does it make you feel good
Does it make you sick
That you knew that I would
Be the one to trip
No Control
