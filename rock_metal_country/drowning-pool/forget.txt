I can see it your eyes 
Why you're here tonight 
Lookin' for that something sacred you'll never find 
You know there must be some way 
To wash away the pain 
Just like you did your faith 

Forget 
Forget the fear you try to hide 
Forget the pain you keep in side 

And before we all regress 
To this emptiness 
And crawl across the floor Once more 
Scraping our hands and knees 

I know that all of us must feel this way
