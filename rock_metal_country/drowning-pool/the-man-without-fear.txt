GO!!

Can you feel it
The perfect day
Scratch the leaved
The paper tears
The world I'm feeling start giving away
A perfect day
A perfect day

Suddenly your rule the universe
Everything was shapeles is clear now
I visualize with a drop of sound
I am The Man Without Fear

You can't hurt me NO
You can't stop me NO
You can't beat me NO

You can't bring me DOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!

C'mon [X4] Daredevil

Hello lady
She takes my hand
Delicate features in this rain
I lose everything
Can I dream
The voices scream
The voices shout

Suddenly youre shot irreparably
Everything was evil now clear
I hear the darkness without sound
I am The Man Without Fear

You can't bring me DOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!

C'mon [X4] Daredevil

Justice is blind..
I trust you
Justice is blind
I trust you

C'mon [X4] Daredevil

See The Man...Without Fear
See The Man...Without Fear
