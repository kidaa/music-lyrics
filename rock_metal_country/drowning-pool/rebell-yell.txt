Last night a little dancer came dancin' to my door dancin' to my door
Last night a little angel came pumpin round my floor pumpin' round my floor
She said "Come on baby I got a license for love
And if it expires pray help from above" because

In the midnight hour she cried "more, more, more"
With a rebel yell she cried "more, more, more", yeah
In the midnight hour babe she cried "more, more, more"
With a rebel yell she cried "more, more, more, more, more"

She don't like slavery, she won't sit and beg
But when I'm tired and lonely she sees me to bed she sees me to bed
What set you free and brought you to be me babe
What set you free I need you here by me, because

In the midnight hour she cried "more, more, more"
With a rebel yell she cried "more, more, more", yeah
In the midnight hour babe she cried "more, more, more"
With a rebel yell she cried "more, more, more, more, more"

Yeah

I walked the ward for you, babe babe, babe
A thousand miles with you with you
I dried your tears of pain pain, pain
A million times for you for you, for you, for you

I'd sell my soul for you babe babe, babe
For money to burn for you for you, for you
I give you all, and have none, babe
Justa, justa, justa, justa to have you here by me, because

In the midnight hour she cried "more, more, more"
With a rebel yell she cried "more, more, more", yeah
In the midnight hour babe she cried "more, more, more"
With a rebel yell she cried "more, more, more, more, more"

Oh yeah, little baby
Yeah, she want more
More, more, more, more
Oh yeah little angel
Yeah she want more
More, more, more, more.
