Your words have crippled me, crippled me, crippled me
My mind has blinded me, blinded me, blinded me
My world, you, my world comes crashing

You cannot hurt me any more
Stay away from me
You can't control me any more

No, no more, no more
You cannot hurt me, no
No more, no more
You can't control me

You keep on coming around, some day you'll come around
Push a little more you said, push a little more you bled
I feel my tension rising, and I feel my temper rising
Hey Push a little more you said , hey push a little more you bled
My world, you, my world comes crashing

This open heart will blind you
These open scars remind you
You still stand still, you won't promise me, no
This open heart will blind you
These open scars remind you
You still stand still, you won't promise me, no

No more, no more
No more, no more

The more you speak to me, the more you lie to me
The more you lie to me, the tighter this noose gets tied
Push a little more you said, push a little more you bled
I feel my tension rising, and I feel my temper rising
Hey Push a little more you said , hey push a little more you bled
My world, you, my world comes crashing

This open heart will blind you
These open scars remind you
You still stand still, you won't promise me, no
This open heart will blind you
These open scars remind you
You still stand still, you won't promise me, no

No more, no more
No you won't promise
No more, no more, no, no more

My world, you, my world comes crashing

This open heart will blind you
These open scars remind you
You still stand still, you won't promise me, no
This open heart will blind you
These open scars remind you
You still stand still, you won't promise me, no

No more, no more
No you won't promise
No more, no more, no, no more
