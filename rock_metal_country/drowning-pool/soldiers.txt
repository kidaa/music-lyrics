On your feet, who's with me
On your feet, who's with me

One world, made better, in slaight, hard bitter
There is no compromise, your bringing forth your sacrifice

On your feet, who's with me
On your feet, let's go

Every time I see inside you I see myself within you
let's go

whoah, yeaheah This is for the soldiers
whoah, yeaheah This is for the soldiers
whoah, yeaheah This is for the soldiers
all for one, let's go

On your feet, who's with me

Lock tide, old strain, there it goes in vain
There is no compromise, your bringing forth your sacrifice

On your feet, who's with me
On your feet, let's go

Every time I see inside you I see myself within you
let's go

whoah, yeaheah This is for the soldiers
whoah, yeaheah This is for the soldiers
whoah, yeaheah This is for the soldiers
one for all, we're coming

Every time I see inside you I see myself within you, ohh let that fade away
Your pride inside of me, your honor inside me, respect inside of inside of me, go

whoah, yeaheah This is for the soldiers
whoah, yeaheah This is for the soldiers
whoah, yeaheah This is for the soldiers
our soldiers, let's go

whoah, yeaheah This is for the soldiers
whoah, yeaheah This is for the soldiers
whoah, yeaheah This is for the soldiers
all for one, we're coming

Every time I see inside you I see myself within you, ohh let that fade away
Every time I see inside you I see myself within you, ohh let that fade away
