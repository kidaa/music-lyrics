I can feel the rain drops the rain drops
Running down my back, the words you used to ruin me
You ruin me
And I remember the rain in my eyes the day you turned and ran away
You ruin me

I, I feel paralyzed, you leave me here broken
I, I feel paralyzed, you leave me so broken

Can you make the pain stop? the pain stop?
And swallow all those thoughts, you used to have that crippled me
You ruin me
Can you remember the pain in my eyes the day you turned and ran away?
You ruin me

I, I feel paralyzed, you leave me here broken
I, I feel paralyzed, you leave me so broken
You keep me tied down, you're stealing my crown
You leave me hopeless
I, I feel paralyzed

I, I feel paralyzed, you leave me here broken
I, I feel paralyzed, you leave me so broken
You keep me tied down, you're stealing my crown
You leave me hopeless
I, I feel paralyzed
I feel paralyzed
I feel paralyzed
