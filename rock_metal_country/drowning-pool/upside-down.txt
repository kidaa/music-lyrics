Come on
Born to lose maybe, but not through you
Not like you, thank your God, not, you're too confused

Little one what I need aint what you bleed
You've got your words twisted funny
A simple fool aint what I am, nor yesterday
You tend to burn me all so clean
You always point your finger

You've got me hanging upside down
Deep inside you've got me all wrong now
You've got me hanging upside down
On a cross, that's burning, burning

Break my back under the weight of your eyes
Broken by your one-sided compromise, come on
Drop a dime on what you say is everything
Not for you, no time for any saving grace
This fire's burning brighter
The tongue the match that ignites these flames
So quick to point your finger

You've got me hanging upside down
Deep inside you've got me all wrong now
You've got me hanging upside down
On a cross, that's burning, burning

You're not changing me, you got me all wrong now
You're not changing me, you got me all wrong now

Yeah
You got me hanging
Ooh, yeah
You've got me hanging upside down
You've got me all wrong now
You've got me hanging upside down
You've got me all wrong now

You've got me hanging upside down
Deep inside you've got me all wrong now
You've got me hanging upside down
On a cross, that you're burning

You've got me hanging upside down
Deep inside you've got, you got me wrong
You've got me hanging upside down
On a cross, that you're burning

You're not changing me, you got me all wrong now
You're not changing me, you got me all wrong now
