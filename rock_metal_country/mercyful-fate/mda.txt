Satan's veil, the night so red 
Another creature sighted 
The night's alright, The music's loud 
The feeling is so right 
Mission: Destroy Aliens 
Mission: Destroy Aliens 
Mission: Destroy Aliens 
Mission: Destroy 
Someone wishes, dare to learn 
And understand the chance 
About his lair, the king has spoke 
To be in there with him 
Mission: Destroy Aliens 
Mission: Destroy Aliens 
Mission: Destroy Aliens 
Mission: Destroy 
Later on, the cauldron's burning 
Take away their breath 
You can't resist my evil touch 
Nature fights their bearing 
Mission: Destroy Aliens 
Mission: Destroy Aliens 
Mission: Destroy Aliens
