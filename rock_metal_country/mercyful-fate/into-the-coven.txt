Music by Hank Shermann,  Lyrics by King Diamond
Howl like a wolf 
And a witch will open the door 
Follow me and meet our high priestess 

Come, come into my coven 
And become Lucifer's child 

Undress until you're naked 
And put on this white coat 
Take this white cross and go to the middle of the ring 

Come, come into my coven 
And become Lucifer's child 

Now crush it, crush the cross 

Suck the blood f rom this unholy knife 
Say after me:  My soul belongs to Satan 

Now, now you're into my coven 
You are Lucifer's child 
Into the coven
