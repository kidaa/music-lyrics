I heard it... in my sleep last night
I heard it... in your sleep last night
Now I can hear it again, outside the night is sad
I know it's not the wind, outside the night is black
Under our window is the Banshee
Wailing its haunted tune
Under out window is the Banshee
Waitling its haunted tune too soon
I know that, I must tell you a lie
I know that, it could be you and not I
Before the sun is rising, the Banshee cannot stay
Before the night is dying, a life will slip away
Under our window is the Banshee
Wailing its haunted tune
Under out window is the Banshee
Waitling its haunted tune too soon
I must light a fire, to chase away the night
Let us hold each other tight
The cats are gone, I guess... they know
Oh... they know what's gonna come
Solo: Wead
The wailing is so much louder, I need to hold you tight
I can feel you getting colder, is it time for you or I?
Solo: Shermann-Wead
Under our window is the Banshee
Wailing its haunted tune
Under out window is the Banshee
Waitling its haunted tune too soon
Let it be me
