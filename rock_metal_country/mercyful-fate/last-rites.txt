I'm surrounded by darkness,I'm dying in my bed 
I don't know if I'm going to survive 
I open my eyes,but it's so hard to see 
My Last Rites 
I don't believe in heaven,I don' t believe in hell 
So save your god for someone else 
Or save him for yourself 
In a flick of a second I think I saw a priest 
Listening to my breathing getting weaker all the time 
He's mumbling words I don't understand 
My Last Rites 
I don't believe in heaven,I don' t believe in hell 
So save your god for someone else 
Or save him for yourself 
Feeling colder,feeling low 
My blood still running,but running slow 
Oh no...I don't need no priest of yours...oh Christ 
I won't listen to another word from you 
Here I am dying and you act the fool 
I wish you'd come a little closer 
So I can reach your cross and end your prayer here 
I don't believe in heaven,I don' t believe in hell 
So save your god for someone else 
Or save him for yourself
