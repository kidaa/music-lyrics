I'm back again, back in the evil night, and you're waiting
Doomed by the living dead, flames are rising, can't you see you're dying 
The wolves are howlin', a baby's cry in the distance, cold winds 
blowing
in the dead of night, flames are rising, can't you see you're dying
No way to survive this evil night, if the dead won't leave you alone
So just say goodbye to all your holy angels, you're gonna die
Long black hair, face like a dead, I am here, Satan in my head
You can't see nothing but confusing mirrors, now you feel it
It's getting nearer, flames are rising, can't you see you're dying
So dark in your mind, breath of Satan in my back, I can't help you
cause I'm one of the dead, flames are rising, can't you see you're dying
No way to survive this evil night, if the dead won't leave you alone
So just say goodbye to all your fuckin' angels.
