Someone better come and save my life
Someone better kill those evil eyes
Is it in my mind or are they still behind
Turning slowly...I see, I see, I see there's no one there
Someone better tell me what it's all about
In the dying fire, moonlight has struck my eye
Feeling colder...I see, I see, I see the amulet of EVIL
GODS...EVIL GODS
Can you hear the voices in my head...
Can you hear the voices in my head
Can you hear the voices, what they say?
KUTULU...KUTULU...KUTULU...KUTULU...
Traveling for years in the mountain side
Traveling for years to believe in the sign
And I know them well now, all of the Ancient Ones
Turning slowly...I see, I see, I see there's no one there
Someone must have broken the holy seal
'cause I know they're there, just like that fateful night
Feeling colder...I see, I see, I see the amulet of EVIL
GODS...EVIL GODS
Can you hear the voices in my head...
Can you hear the voices in my head
Can you hear the voices, what they say?
KUTULU...KUTULU...KUTULU...KUTULU...
Hear me as KUTULU raises his EVIL head
Drooling for my soul
I must finish this book tonight
Tomorrow...I might be of the dead
I'm burning up...I'm burning up
I wish for you...the GODS will be mercyful
Drooling for my soul
I must finish this book tonight
Tomorrow...I might be of the dead
I'm burning up...I'm burning up
I wish for you...the GODS will be mercyful...
