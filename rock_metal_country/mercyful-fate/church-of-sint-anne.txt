Oh Father...did you speak to God? 
Oh Father...did he speak to you? 
In the Church of Saint Anne 
Oh Father...your eyes could heal the sick 
Yeah,heal the sick 
Oh Father...no one could ever forget 
Oh Father...the night your eyes went black 
In the Church of Saint Anne 
Oh Father...God left you for dead 
It was a black year 
For the Church of Saint Anne 
It was a black year 
When the miracles began 
In the Church of Saint Anne 
The sick got sicker and the well got ill 
Your congregation said you lost ";God's will"; 
You ran to the altar,said another prayer 
You ran to the altar,but God was never there 
So they threw you out,and stoned you down 
Stoned you down to the ground 
It was a black year 
For the Church of Saint Anne 
It was a black year 
When the miracles began in the Church 
Oh Father...betrayed by your own 
Oh Father...did Satan take your soul? 
They found him in the tower 
Hanging from the bell 
A twisted smile on his face 
As if he came straight from Hell 
";If thine eyes deceive thee,pluck them out";
