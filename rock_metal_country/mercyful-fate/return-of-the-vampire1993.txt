VERY SPECIAL GUEST: Lars Ulrich on drums
Music by Hank Shermann; Lyrics by King Diamond
A suicide, the birth of a Vampire
Deep in his lair, gasping for air
Spreaded wings
Fly out at sunset
So high above, back before dawn
Return of the Vampire
Leaving his lair
He's out for blood and it's yours
he will share
Return of the Vampire
Leaving his lair
He's out for blood and it's yours
he will share
There's only one way you can stop him
You gotta trace the Vampire to his lair, oh yeah
And then you gotta drive a stake
Right through the heart of the
living dead, the dead
Oh I can feel something is wrong
Vampire, My shadow is gone
Vampire, I know what you've done
Vampire, My shadow is gone
Vampire, I know what you've done
Solo: Denner
Solo: Shermann
Solo: Denner
Return of the Vampire
Leaving his lair
He's out for blood and it's yours
he will share
Return of the Vampire
Leaving his lair
He's out for blood and it's yours
he will share
A suicide, the birth of a Vampire
