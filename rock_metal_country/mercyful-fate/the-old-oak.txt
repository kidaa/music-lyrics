Music by Hank Shermann; Lyrics by King Diamond
Do you remember the bridge?
The bridge that was standing in ruin
Do you remember the sign?
Demons and witches were doing
They say it's a bad place
They say it's a magic place
Deep down under
The soil of this unholy land
Deep down under
The roots of a tree they have damned
It's the Old Oak Hanging Tree
It's the Old Oak Hanging Tree
Solo: Shermann
Nothing will grow in the ground
The Old Oak is killing it all
If you are ever around
Beware of the Oak and its charm
It's the Old Oak Hanging Tree
It's the Old Oak Hanging Tree
The Old Oak might make you blind
The Old Oak might trick your eyes
Hypnotized.....
It's a bad sign
When the Autumn comes and the leaves
are gone
Oh it's a bad sign
The Oak must feed in order to breed
Bad sign....... Bad sign
It's a bad sign when the Autumn comes
And the leaves are gone
It's a nightmare found
I wonder... what made this magic tree so
Solo: Shermann
Solo: Denner
Hang with me, hang with the hangman
Another season in another century
Hang with me, hang with the hangman
Blood from the madmen we hung in that
tree
Blood to the ground
Blood to the roots.... Red
All around the Old Oak
Deep into the ground they buried them
Indians of ancient times
Saw it as a holy shrine
Can you believe, sacrificing their own
Must have been a mighty GOD
To receive a gift of life
All the people must have known
Happiness would come if sown
Can you believe, sacrificing their own
Solo: Denner
The Old Oak might make you blind
The Old Oak might trick your eyes
Hypnotized.....
Solo: Shermann
No! Don't hang with me
As I go back to the Old Oak tree
