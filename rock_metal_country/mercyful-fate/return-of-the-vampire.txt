And so I saw it 
The birth of a vampire 
Fresh in his lair 
Spreading the veil 
Hell spread his wings 
Leaving at sunset 
Fly high and low 
Back before suns glow 
Return of the vampire 
Leaving his liar or  Leave now hes come 
Sucking your blood through your veins or  I cant go back to that place 
Return of the vampire 
Leaving his liar 
Sucking your blood through your veins 
Theres only one way you can stop him 
You gotta trace the vampire to his liar, oh yeah 
And then you gotta drive the stake 
Right through the heart of the living dead, oh yeah 
Oh I can feel you living again 
Vampire Im losing control 
Vampire just give me your cloak 
Vampire Im losing control 
Vampire just give me your cloak
