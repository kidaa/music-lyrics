Stay away 
I am evil 
Or you will die by tomorrow 
Copulation with a body of woman recently dead 
My ceremonies with all the corpses 
Finding souls so to unlock the coffins 
Its a desecration of souls in their holy lair 
Magic circles drawn after midnight 
Around graves to be opened 
Ill use a wand and bodies rise 
Ill ask the questions and Ill burn the remains 
Its a desecration of souls in their holy lair 
Oh this sacrifice Ive been searching on the night of full moon 
Copulation with a body of woman recently dead 
My ceremonies with all the corpses 
Finding souls so to unlock the coffins 
Its a desecration of souls in their holy lair 
Oh this sacrifice Ive been searching on the night of full moon
