Denner
Solo: S
The girl in the mirror, she's not really there
Only I can see her, in all her misery
Chorus:
The girl in the mirror, she's caught in a spell
The girl in the mirror, between Heaven and Hell
Can't you feel it, those haunting eyes
She's so devine, could be magic of a kind
Chorus
Solo: D
Take a look in the mirror
Deep inside there's a world of its own
Take a look in the mirror
See what you might find
Try to reach my hand
Try to reach through the glass... Try... Try...
'Cause the longest journey is the one on your own
If we break the mirror, do you think they'll let you go
Chorus
