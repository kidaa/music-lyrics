Why am I here, in a quiet mortuary
A lady and man, flowers in their hands
Nobody sees me, I don't understand
Nobody hears me...
Seems like I don't exist
Seems like no one can hear me as I... Scream
I do not feel the way I used to be
Could it really be that the one I see is me
You gotta tell why people come but never stay
Could it really be that the one I see is me
Does it really matter... Do you really care
Why am I here, in a quiet mortuary
Listen to the bell, calling my name
Nobody sees, calling my name
Nobody hears me...As I... Scream
Why do I feel like I've been left behind
Could it really be I'm in the afterlife
You gotta tell me why I feel like I've been left behind
Could it really be I'm in the afterlife
Does it really matter... Do you really care
Solos: S-D
Why do I feel like I've been left behind
Could it really be I'm in the afterlife
You gotta tell why people come but never stay
Could it really be I'm in the afterlife
Does it really matter... Do you really care
