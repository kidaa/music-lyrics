Let's go to the House on the Hill 
Let's go to where time stands still 
If you dare then come with me 
To the House on the Hill and you will see 
Nothing is what it seems In the House on the Hill 
Let's go to the House on the Hill 
Let's go to where time stands still 
While you were asleep 
Another friend of mine has come from the Keep 
The well in the cellar my dear - That's how I keep them near 
In the House on the Hill 
In the House on the Hill 
In the House on the Hill 
In the House on the Hill 
Let's go to the House on the Hill 
Let's go to where time stands still 
In my little shrine 
I keep the stillborn to be born another time 
The souls that God didn't hear - oh I keep them near 
In the House on the Hill 
In the House on the Hill 
In the House on the Hill 
In the House on the Hill 
It is so very strange,to live among the stillborn 
It is so very strange,to keep their souls away from harm 
I was one of the mentally ill,who stayed in a cell of his own 
I was one of the mentally ill,who used to call this home 
Oh you're not alone
