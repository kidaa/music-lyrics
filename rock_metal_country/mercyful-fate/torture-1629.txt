Shermann/Diamond
Anna... was praying to a God
She had betrayed, so they said
Some folk had seen her flying on a broom
All Hallows Eve, under the moon
The inquisitor had left her behind
Gone for a bite, food on his mind
The sun was slowly trying to hide
Behind a town so full of pride
A sight Anna would never see again
Torture in the name of Christ, confess, oh you witch
Torture in the name of Christ, you witch you... confess
Solo: Shermann
Sitting naked on the wooden horse
Weights to her legs, what a holy cross>
Her bloody hands tied to her back
Her golden hair burned to black
Thumbscrews they had used
To crush each tip of her fingers to a pulp
In the torture chamber, she couldn't feel much more
Of anything... anymore
Torture in the name of Christ, confess, oh you witch
Torture in the name of Christ, you witch you... confess
Satan's mark... had slipped away
They already searched her body twice today
And it was all in vain
Oh Anna here they come again
Off the horse, strapado for a friend
Up she goes, higher and higher
Anna's crying, screaming: ";Liars";
Solo: Shermann-Wead
Confess, confess witch
Confess, before you die
";Yes, yes, I am a witch, may Satan take you all";
Solo: Wead
They dropped her from the ceiling
To a foot above the floor
Her ams and legs disjointed
Screams of pain... then finally no... more
