3:56
Up in the hills where the sun goes down
There's an old black church and a broken town
The sun goes down
The trees are dead and the river is dry
And they blame it all on the old belfry
The devils cry
Why? Why? Why? Listen to the bell
Why? Why? Why?
Listen to the bell and it just might tell you why
SOLO: Denner
It's a dark and lonely road to the old belfry
And if you're alone, you'll never survive...No..No..No
Deep...in the shadows
Everywhere I hear the devils cry
Why? Why? Do the devils cry?
Why? Why? Why? Do the devils cry?
SOLO: Shermann
I have seen the gateway that leads beyond
So far away from the burning sun
I've seen the Maker, I've seen the Taker
I've seen whatever you call THEM there
The blazing ruby eyes in the old belfry
Listen to the bell if you wanna know why
You gotta listen to the bell
And then you just might hear the sound of HELL
Why?...Why?...Why?...You gotta tell me why
Why?...Why? Why do the devils cry?
Why?...Why? Why do the devils cry?
