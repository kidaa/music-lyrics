Riding out and summed up for  they know their destination 
Demons and witches and leaving less perceptions 
Breaking religion by burning the cross 
Breaking religion, burning the cross 
Travelling in darkness, afraid of recognition 
Evil ambitions, theyre planning the destruction 
Breaking religion by burning the cross 
Breaking religion, burning the cross 
Oh you gotta see them riding through the darkness and stay in the night 
Unholy light 
You gotta see them riding through the darkness and stay in the night 
Unholy light 
 You gotta see them riding through the darkness and stay in the night 
Yeah

Doomsday reflections 
Above the clouds high in the sky 
Doomsday infections 
In their heads and in their minds 
Doomsday reflections

In their heads and in their minds 
Youll be burning the cross
