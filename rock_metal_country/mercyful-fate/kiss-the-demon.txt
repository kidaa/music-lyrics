Kiss the little Demon, hanging on my wall 
Kiss the little Demon, he will answer your call 
You better watch out...God forsaken heaven 
I am alone in the dark when I call the Demon's name 
I Am...Am I the one who's insane? 
Kiss the Demon,he'll make your wish come true 
Kiss the Demon 
Stick out your tongue and let Him taste a little of your blood 
Kiss the little Demon,hanging on my wall 
Kiss the little Demon,he will answer your call 
Kiss the Demon,he'll make your wish come true 
Kiss the Demon 
Stick out your tongue and let Him taste a little of your blood 
I send you my Demon to blacken his brain 
I send you my Demon to rip out his veins 
Rise from Hell and serve me well 
Rise...Demon rise 
You better watch out...God forsaken heaven 
I am alone in the dark when I call the Demon's name 
I Am...Am I the one who's insane? 
Kiss the Demon,he'll make your wish come true 
Kiss the Demon 
Stick out your tongue and let him taste a little of your life 
A little of your blood 
A little of your soul
