Music & lyrics by King Diamond
Ahh...Egypt...Ahh
Solo: Shermann
O Thou of countless names
Who are one and all things
O Thou of countless names
Without beginning, without end
Ahh...Egypt...Ahh
Osiris...Anubis...The underworld
is yours
Osiris...Anubis...I put my soul
in your hands
O Thou, God of the Dead
Lead my soul to the judgement hall
O Thou, Jackal Head
Weigh my soul, I await your call
Ahh...Egypt...Ahh
Ammit, Eater of the Dead
Is devouring my heart
Will I pass on to Aaru
Or will I be condemned?
Solo: Denner
I'm burning inside to know
I'm burning inside to know
I'm burning inside to know
I must be back on time
But still I want to know
I hope they let me go
I'm from another time
And I must reunite
My body and my soul
I'm burning inside to know
I'm burning inside to know
I'm burning inside to know
Osiris...Anubis...The underworld
is yours
Osiris...Anubis...I put my soul
in your hands
O Thou of countless names
Who are one and all things
O Thou of countless names
Without beginning, without end
Ahh...Egypt...Ahh
Egypt come back to me
Egypt come back to me
Egypt, without beginning or end
