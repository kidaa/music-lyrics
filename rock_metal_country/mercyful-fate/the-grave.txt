There is a cemetary just East of here 
That's where they say the Devil,the Devil is always near 
Come to the Grave 
The Grave that comes alive,The Grave that feeds the night 
Bring your Book of Spells 
Ancient rites,magic signs,bring your sacrifice 
It's time to draw the circle around The Grave 
Now don't you break the circle,tonight is not a game 
Come to The Grave 
Rise evil demon,up into the night 
Is that you...Baphomet,the inverted star 
We visit here at midnight,we stay until the daylight
