D'Angelo/Diamond
You are Selene, the moon in heaven
You are Persephone, Queen of the Underworld
Hecate... darkness and terror of the night
Hecase... oh, the crossroads are thine
You are Diana, you are the hunter of souls
The dogs are howling, we dogs know when you approach
Let us ride with a beast tonight
Let us ride to the crossroads
Let us ride with a beast tonight, oh let us ride
Solo: Shermann
At the crossroads, they buried criminals and suicides
At the crossroads, any traveller could lose a life
A suitable place, for making a pact with the Devil
A suitable place, for us to hold the sabbath
Let us ride with a beast tonight
Let us ride to the crossroads
Let us ride with a beast tonight
Let us ride in the dead of night...
Even you mortals can ride with her at night
And join the night-flying demons, oh you and I
Listen to their tales of wandering ghosts
Listen to their tales of forgotten times
Listen to their tales of the crossroads
Listen to their tales of forgotten lives
