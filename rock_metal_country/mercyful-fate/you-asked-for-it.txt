Oh, Ill tell you everything I do 
Were going to talk at the moon 
Youve said enough, too easily gave up 
Ill smash you, youll look like a stranger 
Youre young and scared 
No one hears, no one cares 
Shout out with your gun 
Its time to surrender 
You still will be burned 
Youre sick and tender 
You asked for it, every time in prayer 
Ill smash you, youll look just like a stranger 
Oh what a love to be young and scared 
No one hears, no one gives 
A damn 
Oh you asked for it, you wont get no mercy X3 
Oh little girl your pain is now 
Your eyes willyour mouth I was not able to figure out this whole line 
Oh little girl youre about to be burned 
Oh little girl come and meet the devil 
Oh Ill tell you everything I do 
Were going to talk at the moon 
You asked for it, every time in prayer 
Ill smash you, youll look just like a stranger 
No one hears 
No one gives 
A damn 
Oh you asked for it, you wont get no mercy X3 
Oh no
