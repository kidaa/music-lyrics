Music by Hank Shermann; Lyrics by King Diamond
";The Rise";
I'm an undertaker
I'm a ghost in the night
I'm a coffin shaker
This graveyard site is mine
Take a look at the sky, see that evil eye
Tonight the moon is cold as ice
Oh yeah...cold as ice...oh yeah
There's a black horse waiting
Will HE be on time?
The graveyard's shaking
Should I turn my eyes and walk away
Take a look at the sky, see that evil eye
Tonight the Headless Rider rides
Midnight...let the churchbell ring
It's midnight, All Hallows Eve
It's midnight, All Hallows Eve
I see him rising from his grave
I see him rising from his grave.......
";The Chase";
On All Hallows Eve, Never to forget
He rides the open field
In search of his head
My GOD, he's so grotesque
Should I stay?
My GOD, a scythe in his hand
NO WAY
He's coming...I'm running
He's coming...I'm running
Deep inside I know I'm the one
He's coming...I'm running
Deep inside I know this is wrong
Help me, I'm falling down
Solo: Shermann
I'm falling down...
I'm looking up...I'm in a grave
";Doomed";
In this hollow grave
I can smell that he's near
Will I ever never make it
Will I shed a tear
Oh it's strange how everything's changing
Now my life is fading away
In this hollow grave
I see a bony hand
Don't you ever never take it
It's the key to his land
Oh it's strange how everything's changing
Now my life is fading away
Solo: Denner
Oh it's strange how everything's changing
Now my life is fading away
NO!
";Epilogue";
The mind in my headless body
Seems to be chained to the inside
I cannot move towards the light...
And as he rides away
Leaving me with this curse
I hear his laughter in the distance
Actually it's my laughter, he stole my head
Does this mean I'll be The One next year???
