There's a little old man...standing by my window
There's a little old man...hiding in the shadows
The univited guest, could never have been a friend
The univited guest, he would never come back again
There's a little old man...I'd say he looks like Misery
There's a little old man...I could really use his company
The univited guest, could never have been a friend
The univited guest, he would never come back again
SOLO: Denner
Come inside...and stay for a little while
Come in from the cold and warm your heart
";You would not know of me...we never met before
The name is Damian and I used to live in this house";

The univited guest, could never have been a friend
The univited guest, he would never come back again
There's a little old man...I'd say he looks like Misery
There's a little old man...I could really use his company
The univited guest, could never have been a friend
The univited guest, he would never come back again
SOLO: Denner
So I said farewell...until we meet again
You can come again my friend, any day you want
I later learned that he was never here
I later learned that he'd been dead a year
The univited
