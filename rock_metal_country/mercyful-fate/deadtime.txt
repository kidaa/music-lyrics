";Lie down in your dead little baby
You know it's getting late
Listen to this deadtime story
And hold on to your head";
And it's wasy past her deadtime...the night has just died
Little blood red Riding Hood was passing through the woods
A basket full of poisoned fruit
She's absolutely way to cute
And it's way past her deadtime...the night has just died
Good Old Nick is in her blood and it makes me feel so hot
Devil eyes, that's no surprise, she's colder than ice
The werewolf is hiding with its yellow glowing eyes
Drooling for some baby blood, he's jumping in the night
And he knows where Red is riding
He knows here Grandma well
That big bad werewolf's got it down, he cannot fail
And it's way past her deadtime...the night has just died
SOLO: Denner
Grandma's waiting in here dead for sweetest little Red
When she ate the werewolf's head, you could not even tell
There is no way out
There is no way out for sweetest little Riding Hood
'cause Granny won't be full
Until Red is dead and gone...Bye, bye
SOLO: Shermann
And it's way past her deadtime...the night has just died
