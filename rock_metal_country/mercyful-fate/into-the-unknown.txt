Darkness we are here tonight to select who's gonna die
Has everyone arrived?
Darkness open wide and let the lights go dim
While I dig into your soul my friend...
Looking for sin...sin...sin. Looking for sin..sin
Oh yeah, You're going into the unknown
Oh yeah, You're going into the unknown
Darkness we are here tonight to select who's gonna die
Has everyone arrived?
Darkness open wide and let the show begin
While we look into the Southern wind
Oh yeah, You're going into the unknown
Oh yeah, You're going into the unknown
SOLO: Shermann
Someone here will not survive the night that's creeping by
This is your time, not mine, for another life...
Don't you see...don't you see
You took a chance, now you must pay, say your last goodbye
This is your time, not mine, for another life...
Now die, die, die...
It is so much colder in here, hold on to your soul my dear
It is so much colder in here, hold on to...Nothing!!!
Who should I let go?  Who needs to know...
SOLO: Shermann
The journey of a lonely soul, now you're on your own...yeah
The maker's waiting down the road, the dying has begun
Now my finger points at you
It is time for you to pay what's due
Now my finger points at you
And you must know...what you never ever knew
Oh yeah, You're going into the unknown
Oh yeah, You're going into the unknown
SOLO: Denner
Now my finger points at you, and you must know...
What you never ever knew
SOLO: Denner
