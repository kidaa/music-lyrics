I sold my soul to you,I sold my soul to the Devil his due 
I...I sold my soul 
I sold my soul,and I sold yours too ";To the Devil we're due"; 
Ohhh...I sold my soul 
That night was the darkest of all 
That night I sold my soul to you...to the Devil his due 
I sold my soul 
No point in turning around,there's no way out of here,no! 
No point in turning around,just live with the fear 
That night was the darkest of all 
That night I sold my soul to you 
To the Devil his due 
So many angels were falling from the sky 
So many angels would have to die... 
A black candle in my hand,a pact between God and man 
Oh your Majesty,this time I have to know 
I sold my soul to you,I sold my soul to the Devil his due 
I...I sold my soul 
I sold my soul,and I sold yours too ";To the Devil we're due"; 
That night was the darkest of all 
That night I sold my soul to you...to the Devil his due 
No point in turning around,there's no way out of here,no! 
No point in turning around,just live with the fear 
That night was the darkest of all 
That night I sold my soul to you 
To the Devil his due 
So many angels were falling from the sky 
So many angels would have to die...
