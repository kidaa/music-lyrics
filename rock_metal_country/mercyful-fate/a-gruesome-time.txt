Music by Michael Denner; Lyrics by King Diamond
Everything is so strange in here
And as I look through your eyes
I can see what you're thinking of me
I am deep inside
Deep inside your head, causing you pain
Deep inside your head, causing you pain
Eternal pain
All your secrets are done my dear
And as I look through your eyes
I can see all the things that you fear
I am deep inside
Deep inside your head, causing you pain
Deep inside your head, causing you pain
Eternal pain
Solo: Shermann
I'm the dreams you don't wanna dream
I'm the things you don't wanna see
I'm the dreams you don't wanna dream
I am the night of sin.....
Solo: Denner
I wanna see you in tears
The end is near.....
I am deep inside
Deep inside your head, causing you pain
Deep inside your head, causing you pain
Eternal pain
I've come to give you a gruesome time
For all the evil you have done
I'll keep a coming until the end
I'll keep a coming back my friend
