Music: Hank Shermann; Lyrics: King Diamond
Solo: H.S.
I forbid you Entrance here, you step on hollow Ground
Don't you see this Chapel
Shut up! Hold your Tongue, they must rest in Silence
It's the Rebirth of the Unborn
Tonight is the Night
The Spirits of the Unborn will play tonight
The Unborn will play tonight
They will dance around the Chapel
It's a Feast for the Dead
They will Make a Fool of the Priest
And the Dead Boy's Choir will sing
A Song for the Dead to whom Life has just begun
Life of the Unborn
This One's for the Unborn
Solo: M.D.
Did you know? 13 Days have come and gone
Since we had the First of June
The Spirits of the Unborn will play tonight
Forgive them, they didn't die
Solo: M.D.
Solo: H.S.
