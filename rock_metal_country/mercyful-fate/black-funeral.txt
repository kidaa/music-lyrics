Music by Hank Shermann,  Lyrics by King Diamond
Bring the black box to the altar 
Now raise your hands and do the sign 
Oh hail Satan, yes hail Satan 
Lay down your swords, the evil star 

It's a black funeral 
She was a victim of my coven 

Open the black box on the altar 
Her blood is still hot, so let it out 
Oh hail Satan, yes hail Satan 
Now drink it, drink, drink, forget that whore 

It's a black funeral 
She was the victim of my coven
