Diamond/Diamond
In the mirror... I have seen HIM
And he scares me
The crature... behind the mask I wear
I know his name is FEAR
In the mirror... he's looking back at me
I have to face him every day
And I know him not so well, his name is FEAR
So deep within, yet so far away
I... wonder, will he always stay
Stay so deep within, deep within my soul
And I know him not so well, his name is FEAR
The man... in the mirror, he scares me
For I know him not so well
The creature... behind the mask I wear
I know his name is FEAR
In the mirror... it's not omy eyes I see
But they are always there
I cannot let it show, NO ONE must ever know
The horror that lies so deep within
Tucked away beneath my skin
And it scares me, yes it scares me
So deep within, yet so far away
I... wonder, will he always stay
Stay so deep within, deep within my soul
And I know him not so well, his name is FEAR
Solo: Wead
No man... nor any book, will ever teach me
What I need to know
No man... nor any book, will ever teach me
What I'm longing for
Only the creature... living inside of me
Could show me the meaning of life
I cannot let it show, NO ONE must ever know
The horror that lives so deep within
Tucked away beneath my skin
And it scares me, yes it scares me
