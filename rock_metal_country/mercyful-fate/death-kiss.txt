Dark lady coming out at night 
Still glory 
Lets those legs on fire 
Shes going to take away your life 
And theres a mess beyond the killing fields 
A shock 
Bells ringing from the city tower 
Its a woman 
People running 
Girl haunted 
Death kiss walking down the long road 
And now shes big enough 
The world is gonna die 
The time it slips away 
You cant stop oh no 
She may give us death kiss 
She may give us a kiss 
Everything is turned upside down 
Theres a child there divine 
Dark lady taking care again, yeah 
Now shes walking back to hell with just her hands 
The time it slips away 
You cant stop oh no 
Its death kiss 
Ah a little child 
Ah shes gonna die 
The child has lost its way 
The child is dead
