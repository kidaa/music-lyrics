Listen, Im a corpse, Im a corpse 
Im a corpse without soul 
Satan, hes taken, hes taken 
He taken his toll 
Listen, Im a corpse, Im a corpse 
Im a corpse without soul 
Satan , hes taken, hes taken 
Hes taken his toll 
I was walking down among the graves 
I heard a cry, my shadow is gone 
Emptiness in my body, life in the cold 
Small black wings on my naked back 
Now guess what I saw on one of those stones 
I saw my soul in a magical haze 
It was all dressed up as corpse in a wedding dress 
Small black wings on my naked back 
Now hear my prayer, begging for mercy 
Im just living to die 
I was walking down among the graves 
I heard a cry my shadow is gone 
Emptiness in my body, life in the cold 
Small black wings on my naked back 
Now guess what I saw on one of those stones 
I saw my soul, in a magical haze 
It was all dressed up as a corpse in a wedding dress 
Small black wings on my naked back 
Listen, Im a corpse, Im a corpse 
Im a corpse without soul 
Satan, hes taken, hes taken 
Hes taken his toll 
Listen, Im a corpse, Im a corpse 
Im a corpse without soul 
Satan, hes taken, hes taken
