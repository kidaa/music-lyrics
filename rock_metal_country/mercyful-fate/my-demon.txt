Diamond
This house is full of hate, this house is full of madness
This house is deep insane, this house was never mine
Chorus:
Deep in the dark you will find us
DEMON and I we are both deep inside
Yes My DEMON and I we are mine

All of the deadle kisses, all of the sick, sick, sickness
All of the broken mirrors, it's here to stay forever
Chorus
Solo: S
Chorus 2:
Come along... Come along, meet
My DEMON... DEMON... My DEMON... DEMON
The poison deep within, I can't let HIM out again
The dark stains on the floor, they won't come off anymore
So here we go again, digging the knife in
Who will be next? Who will be our next guest?
Solo: D
I hate that GOD damn cellar, I wish I never went there
It always was and will be, I cannot make it go away
Chorus 2
The poison deep within, I can't let HIM out again
The dark stains on the floor, they won't come off anymore
So here we go again, be my guest!!!
