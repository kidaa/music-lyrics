I see little demons,are they in my head? 
I see little demons,fightin in my bed 
Why did I go insane? Oh doctor kill the pain 
Screams in the night,I hear another one died 
Was it number 9,or was it me who cried 
Why did I go insane? Oh doctor kill the pain 
When I look in the mirror,my mind goes blank 
My brain is burning up,Insanity... 
When I look in the mirror,my mind is,Dead 
Is it me on the other side? 
I saw the look on your face,the night they took me away 
Not a tear,not a trace,just stood there waving goodbye 
Dead roses in my room,a love that died too soon 
When I look in the mirror,my mind goes blank 
My brain is burning up,Insanity... 
When I look in the mirror,my mind is,Dead 
Sanity turned Insane,I hange myself in a picture frame 
I'm so tired,let me sleep 
I'm counting demons... 
Why did I go Insane? Oh doctor kill the pain 
Oh doctor kill the pain,oh doctor kill the pain
