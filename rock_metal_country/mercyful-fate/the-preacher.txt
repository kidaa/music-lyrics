Shermann
You believe in Heaven
You believe the Devil is here
When you ring your demon bell
You think I'll en up in Hell
Chorus:
Oh yeah you're the Preacher
You're the Devil
You're the Preacher
Hiding in the Underworld, that's you
I can't wait to see your final show
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm gonna miss you so
Solo: S
I believe you're crying
You're not the only one
Have you ever seen the light
I bet you're scared of the night
Chorus
I can't wait to see your final show
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm gonna miss you so
Solos: S,D - S,D
Oh Yeah You're the Preacher
Yes... You're the Devil
You're in the fire
You're such a liar
If you had a soul to sell
I bet you'd end up in Hell
Chorus
I can't wait to see your final show
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm gonna miss you so
