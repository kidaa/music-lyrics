Music: Hank Shermann/Michael Denner; Lyrics: King Diamond
Stay away white Magician, young
Lovers and mourning Wife
You're not welcome on our Land
So I speak for the Dead
Solo: M.D.
Magic Circles drawn after Midnight
Around Graves to be opened
He'll use the Wand to raise a Body
He'll ask the Questions and he'll burn the Remains
It's Desecration of Souls in their holy Lair
Solo: M.D.
Copulation in the Night
Two Shadows upon a Grave
Screams of Pleasure and Screams of Pain
Young Lovers, you must be Insane
It's Desecration of Souls in their holy Lair
So I say again: Stay away, it's Desecration of Souls
Solo: H.S.   Solo: M.D.
Dyin' Flowers upon the Grave
Of a Husband who's lost his Maid
She's there on Duty, and the Tears she cries
They don't belong where the Flowers lie
It's Desecration of Souls in their holy Lair
So I say again: Stay away, it's Desecration of Souls
Solo: M.D.
