Denner/Diamond
Master... You know I nerver pray
Master... Nothing can keep you away
Chorus:
Nightmare be thy name, Nightmare be thy name
The dreams... They always do come true
Second sight, and I don't want to know
Chorus
You got to stop this game... Before I go
In-sane... You drive me insane
You would follow me straight to the grave
And beyond... Oh yes you would
Solo: S/D
In Hell, I see the fate of others
Break the speel, this night has been on forever
Chorus
You got to stop this game... Before I go
In-sane... Before I go insane
