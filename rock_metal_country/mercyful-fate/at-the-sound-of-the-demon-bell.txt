Music by Hank Shermann,  Lyrics by King Diamond
Halloween is the night 
The legend says the ghost will rise 
On Halloween they can't redeem 
A restless soul from an ancient scene 
At the sound of the demon bell 
Everything will burn to Hell 
Rise... rise... rise... It's Halloween 
Rise... rise... The ghost will rise 

Reconciled with the powers of darkness 
He'll uncover a saint 
You won't believe?  See for yourself 

I hear a bell 
A sound from Hell, the demon bell 

I see a lightin' shadow in between the graves 
Swinging his sword of hate towards the gates of Heaven 
";Beelzebub, Astaroth...Bring me the Devil"; 
And as he says these words I can't believe my eyes 

Upon a burnin' cross 
The ";Lord't Jesus, Satan's above 
It must be a shame 
To see the Lord fallin' again 

Now rise, reconcile with the powers of darkness 
Uncover a saint
