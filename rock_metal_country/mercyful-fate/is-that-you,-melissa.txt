Music & Lyrics by King Diamond
Oh...Melissa, You're in my dreams
You're with me every day
Oh...Melissa, could that really be
your voice I hear?
Too soon for you and I
The priest took his sacrifice
And sent you to the other side
Oh...Melissa, You're in my dreams
You're with me every day
Oh...Melissa, do you remember
the time we shared?
Do you remember the magic nights?
I will never forget your smile
Do you remember the love we
had?...
Oh the love we had
Solo: Shermann
";No...Melissa";
You gotta tell me why
";No...Melissa";
I want her by my side
Solo: Shermann
";This is against the rules
there won't be another time";
Melissa tell me why
I wanna know why
";No...Melissa";
You gotta tell me why
";No...Melissa";
I want her by my side
Oh...Melissa, You're in my dreams
You're with me every day
Oh...Melissa, close your eyes
and say goodbye
One last time...we'll kiss goodbye
Solo: Denner
I kiss your soul goodbye
