Music & Lyrics by King Diamond
The mansion was right on the shore
Down by the lake
Nobody had lived here before
But the Devil himself
Thirteen invitations
Sent out through the night
Thirteen invitations
They would all arrive in time
Solo: Shermann
They gathered around the mansion
Thirteen in all
They had the same intention
Never to fall
Thirteen invitations
Sent out through the night
Thirteen invitations
Promising eternal life
So you want to be alive forevermore
I will turn the wheel of time
None of you will ever have to die
I will turn the wheel of time
Turning the wheel
Turning the wheel of time
But first we must play a game
The game of souls
Sit down! Don't move around!
Deal those cards!
They played all night 'till the morning light
And the Devil, he smiled on his own
They played all night for eternal life
Or the chance of losing their souls
High will win, low is the sin
They played all night in the burning light
The thirteen were sharing a nine
High will win, low is the sin
The final card was in the Devil's hand
The King of Diamonds would win
Solo: Denner
Solo: Shermann
They could never leave the mansion
Forever inside
They had lost their souls of creation
But they were alive
Thirteen invitations
Sent out through the night
Thirteen invitations
And the mansion was mine
