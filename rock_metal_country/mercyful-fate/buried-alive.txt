The poison is still in your veins 
The poison I slipped in your drink 
Never saw me,I am but a ghost 
Never saw your dangerous host 
Wake up...You're still alive...Wake up and die 
All you can see in the darkness above 
Is the white in my eyes... 
I'm standing on the edge of your grave 
Looking down 
Into the eyes of a dead... 
Buried alive...Buried alive 
Wake up...You're still alive...Wake up and die 
How does it feel with my foot on your chest? 
How does it feel? 
Tell me and I might forget 
How does it feel to be so out of breath? 
How does it feel? 
Tell me and I might forget... 
Buried alive...Buried alive 
He started struggling,Oh the fool 
Moonlight shining in his drool 
I slammed the shovel straight between his eyes 
";Stay down";,I screamed ";You're here to die"; 
Never saw me,I am but a ghost 
Never saw your dangerous host 
Wake up...You're still alive...Wake up and die 
All you can see in the darkness above 
Is the white in my eyes... 
I'm standing on the edge of your grave 
Looking down 
Into the eyes of a dead... 
Buried alive...Buried alive 
No matter what it is you believe 
You're lucky if you die in your sleep 
";Murder";,he screamed ";Oh why?"; but that's a lie 
You killed me first,so now die 
I'm dead,but you die,I'm gonna bury you alive 
";Murder"; he screamed ";Oh why?";
