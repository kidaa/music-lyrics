Old Nick is by my side, I hear no evil
As I walk into the night, I see no evil
Old Nick is by my side, I feel no evil
Oh... I'm gonna love this night... it's gonna be just fine
The two of us at midnight, a feeling of Hell
The two of us at midnight...
Just him and I, we're gonna spy on God
Old Nick... my imaginary friend
Old Nick is not what they say, here we go again
Through the dark on a snake we ride, the Devil's child
Oh... the moon is bright, she's oh so fine
The two of us at midnight, a feeling of Hell
The two of us at midnight...
Just him and I, we're gonna spy on God
Find out who he really is
Find out who she really is, The Night
Find out if he really is
Find out if she really is, The Night
Solo: Shermann-Wead
Looking through a Demon's eye
We're gonna spy on God
Find out if he really is
Find out if she really is

The two of us at midnight...
Just him and I, we're gonna spy on God
The Night
Find out who he really is
Find out who she really is, The Night
Find out if hee really is
Find out if she really is, The Night...
