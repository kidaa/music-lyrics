All your sins are forgiven 
In the name of Jesus in heaven...Ahhh 
There you stood with your soul in your hand 
Thinking...that God would understand 
Satan take him to where you dwell 
Satan take him to burn in hell 
Always were a believer 
You never thought of God as the Deceiver...Ahhh 
There you stood with your soul in your hand 
Thinking...that God would understand 
Satan take him to where you dwell 
Satan take him to burn in hell 
Burn In Hell...Drown in my wishing well 
Burn In Hell...Drown in my wishing well 
Where is your Jesus now,Jesus in Heaven 
Where is your saviour of all 
He's executing your soul 
Burn In Hell...Drown in my wishing well 
Jesus and Satan hand in hand 
Leading you down the stairway to the damned 
No more pearly gates for you 
Eternal flames,wondering who is who...Ahhh 
Burn In Hell...Drown in my wishing well 
Burn In Hell...Drown in my wishing well 
Where is your Jesus now,Jesus in Heaven 
Where is your saviour of all 
He's executing your soul 
Burn In Hell...Burn In Hell
