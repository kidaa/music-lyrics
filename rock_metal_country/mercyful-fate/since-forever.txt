Diamond/Diamond
On this cold and windy Sunday
I'm sitting here alone... It's Autumn
I'm looking at a yellow picture
You have been gone forever
Oh it's so very hard, growing old on your own, alone
I'm trying to remember... the days...
When we were young
Since forever, I still remember your ways
Since forever, I still remember
I have been reading your letter, over and over again
I can't believe you're gonna be here today
I can't believe... this is Sunday
How nice of you to come, it's been so way too long
Let me get you another glass of wine
To keep our tingues in time
Solo: Wead
Since forever, I still remember your ways
Since forever, I still remember
So many things have never been told
And now the both of us are way too old
Solo: Shermann
Since forever, I still remember your ways
Since forever, I still remember
Like the light of the sun
You used to brightened my day
But darkness ha taken your place
And I can no longer keep it away
Since forever, I still remember your ways
Since forever, I still remember
I ask you for one last time
No there won't be any wine
Just one more time
So you can put flowers on my grave
And then leave again... since forever
