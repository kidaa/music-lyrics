Oh, yeah oh yeah 
Now hear my song 
Sirens calling, people leaving the streets 
The cops are coming, I dont know what I did 
Why dont you get away, leaving my soul alone. Maybe another day, you get a reason too X2 
Oh, yeah oh yeah 
Im running free, they wont get me alive 
No one can see, I did it to survive 
Why dont you get away, leaving my soul alone. Maybe another day you get a reason too X2 
Oh yeah oh yeah 
This is what I did 
I killed a friend, for making love to my girl 
This is the end, a bullet from my gun 
Why dont you get away leaving my soul alone. Maybe another day you get a reason too X2 
I cant belong 
Kill
