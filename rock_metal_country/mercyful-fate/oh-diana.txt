Solo: Wead
Hecate... darkness and terror of the night
Hecate... oh, the crossroads are thine
You are Diana, you are the hunter of souls
the dogs are howling, we dogs know when you approach
Let us ride with a beast tonight
Let us ride to the crossroads
Let us ride with a beast tonight
Let us ride in the dead of night...
To the crossroads... to the crossroads...
We ride to the crossroads, in search of your soul
We ride to the crossroads, in search of your soul...
