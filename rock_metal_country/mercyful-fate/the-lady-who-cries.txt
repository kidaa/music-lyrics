Diamond/Diamond
Many have seen the statue that cries
But only I have seen her at night
Many say that it... is a miracle
Many say that her... tears can heal you, but
When the sun goes down, and my day begins
That's when I saw her change
her tears did turn to blood, just like a miracle
And through her mouth of stone, I saw the fire
From so deep inside, I heard a voice from Hell
";I am the lady who cries, I am he who lights the night";
";I am Lucifer";
Solo: Shermann
Many say that it... is a miracle
Many say ther her... tears can heal you, but
From so deep inside, I hear a voice from hell
";I am the lady who cries, I am he who fights the night";
Solo: Wead
";I'm your eternal friend";
";Let my children come to me at day
Let my children come to me and pray";
Solo: Wead
";They don't know who I am
Or that they worship the Devil
They don't know who I am
They think I'm a miracle...";
