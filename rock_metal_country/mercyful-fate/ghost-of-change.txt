Walking...on a cold and white December night
I hear...the voices from the other side
Calling my name, must be that olden friend
I think she has come to see me once again
Do you...still remember the old oak tree
I...do, the feeling's coming back to me
Calling my name, must be that olden friend
I think she has come to see me once again
SOLO: Shermann
You are the ghost of change, and now we meet again
You are the ghost of change, but I will always be the same
Ghost of change...do you remember my name
Ghost of change...do you remember my name
I took her hand, and then we walked into the night
I took her hand, and then we watched the moon go by
Memories...of long forgotten times
I took a chance to relive my life and then I saw her
She smiled
You are the ghost of change, and now we meet again
You are the ghost of change, but I will always be the same
The same
Walking...on a cold and white December night
I...hear, the voices from the other side
Calling my name, must be that olden friend
I think she has come to see me once again
Ghost of change...do you remember my name
Ghost of change...do you remember my name
SOLO: Denner
You are the ghost of change, and now we meet again
You are the ghost of change, but I will always be the same
