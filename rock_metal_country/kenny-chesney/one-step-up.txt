Woke up this mornin
The house was cold
Checked the furnace she wasn't burnin'
Went out and hopped in my old Ford
Hit the engine but she ain't a turnin
Given each other some hard lessons lately
But we aren't learnin
Same sad story thats a fact
Once step up and two steps back

Heard on a wire outside my motel room but he aint singin
Girl in white outside a church in june
but the church bells they aint ringin'
Sittin here in this bar tonight
and all i'm thinkin is
How the same old story same old act
One step up and two steps back 

Its the same thing night all night
Whos wrong and baby whos right
Another fight and i slam the door on
Another battle and I dirty a little one
When I look at myself I dont see the man I wanted to be
somewhere along the line I slipped off track
livin one step up and two steps back

Theres a girl across the bar
I get the message shes sendin
Mmm she aint lookin too married
We well honey I pretended
Last night I dreamed I held you in my amrs 
the music was never endin 
we danced as the evening sky faded to black
movin one step up and two steps up
one step up and two steps back
one step up and two steps back
one step up and two steps back
One step up and two steps back
one step up and two steps back
one step up and two steps back

ohhh..baby we're movin

One step up and two steps back
One step up and two steps back
One step up and two steps back
mmm..one step up and two steps back
one step up and two steps back
one step up and two steps back
