Well I ain't had nothin' to drink
I knew that's probably what you'd think
If I'd drop by this time of night
Remember way back when
I promised you I'd drop in
At one of those meetings down at the "Y"

They started talkin' about steps you take
Mistakes you make the hearts you break
And the price you pay
I almost walked away

You could hear a pin drop
When this old man
Stood up and said I'm gonna say it again
Like I do every week
For those who don't know me

It's the simple things in life
Like the kids at home and a lovin' wife
That you miss the most, when you lose control
And everything you love starts to disappear
The devil takes your hand and says no fear
Have another shot, just one more beer
Yeah I've been there
That's why I'm here

This old boy stood up in the isle
Said he'd been livin' a life of denial
Then he cried, as he talked about wasted years
I couldn't believe what I heard
It was my life word for word
And all of the sudden, it was clear

It's the simple things in life
Like the kids at home and a lovin' wife
That you miss the most, when you lose control
And everything you love starts to disappear
The devil takes your hand and says no fear
Have another shot, just one more beer
Yeah I've been there
That's why I'm here

I know for us it may be too late
But it would mean the world to me
If you were there when I stand to say

It's the simple things in life
Like the kids at home and a lovin' wife
That you miss the most, when you lose control
And everything you love starts to disappear
The devil takes your hand and says no fear
Have another shot, just one more beer
Yeah I've been there
That's why I'm here

OOH, I've been there
That's why I'm here
