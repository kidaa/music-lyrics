Well I've been lonesome
I've been empty
I've got an aching
Way deep down inside
And I need someone, someone to hold me
Pull down the shades, turn out the light
And love me tonight 

Don't think about tomorrow
It don't matter anymore
We can turn the key
And lock the world outside the door
I need you so now
Come on, let go now
Kick off your shoes, turn out the light
And love me tonight 

Well don't you worry
We're all alone now
So let your hair down
Come sit by my side
And turn off the TV
Put on some music
Pull down the shade, turn out the light
And love me tonight 

Don't think about tomorrow
It don't matter anymore
We can turn the key
And lock the world outside the door
I need you so now
Come on, let go now
Kick off your shoes, turn out the light
And love me tonight 

I need you so now
Come on let go now
Pull down the shades, turn out the light
And love me tonight
