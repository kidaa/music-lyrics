Baby I don't understand 
How just the touch of your hand 
Can make me feel invincible 
Do you know just where you take me 
Do you know how high you make me 
I need your kiss like oxygen 
With your arms all around me 
When your eyes look deep into me 
It's unstoppable 
Baby, anything is possible 
Everything I wanna be 
Any dream I wanna dream 
I can because of your love 
Anywhere I ever go 
With all of my heart I know 
I am the man I am 
Because of your love 
Don't know how I lived before you 
Now I live to explore you 
Take me girl to your secret world 
Or I could swim in your deep blue passion 
Or I could feel your love come crashing 
Over me, endlessly 
Whether you're right by my side 
Or whether you and I 
Are a million miles apart 
I can always feel you in my heart 
Everything I wanna be 
Any dream I wanna dream 
I can because of your love 
Anywhere I ever go 
With all of my heart I know 
I am the man I am 
Because of your love 
Everything I wanna be 
Any dream I wanna dream 
I can because of your love 
Anywhere I ever go 
With all of my heart I know 
I am the man I am - The man I am 
Because of your love 
Oh baby, because of your love...
