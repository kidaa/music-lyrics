She's thinking about what her kids are doing
Five miles away, it's almost time for bed
They're brushing teeth and hearing one more story
And in the mirror she paints her lips bright red
She wishes she could call and say she loves them
But the bossman says no calls go out or in
So she puts on a dress that might feel pretty
If she didn't have to take it off again

She's dancing for the Groceries
She's dancing for the rent
She's dancing for the credit cards
That she's already spent
In sequins and in laces
She's dancing for the braces
So her kids can a perfect smile someday
Smiling While she dances
Is the price she has to pay

They tell her in this job there is no future
So get it while you can Cause looks don't last
There money in those pockets for the take in
If u do it right it makes the time go fast
The music loud the drinks are mostly water
What her name is tonight she cant recall
The business men stair at the single mother
Whose smiling while she's staring at the wall

She's dancing for the Groceries
She's dancing for the rent
She's dancing for the credit cards
That she's already spent
In sequins and in laces
She's dancing for the braces
So her kids can a perfect smile someday
Smiling While she dances
Is the price she has to pay

Someday she'll have a house out in the country
Someday she'll see the other side of dawn
And no one will ever know
But it what's she did before
She just heard the DJ say your on
The lights come up
And they play her song
