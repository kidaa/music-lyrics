Somebody's callin'; callin' my little darlin'  darlin'  tonight.
This time, oh Lord, it aint me. 
Instead of sittin' here a'bawlin', bawlin',
I ought to be a crawlin' back to make things right.
Somebody's callin' my little darlin'  darlin'  tonight.

Well the clock on the wall says its midinght,
And my baby still aint home; where, oh, where can she be?
Well, I got a sneakin suspicion, she aint all alone.
What is this sound I hear a hauntin' me? 

Somebody's callin'; callin' my little darlin'  darlin'  tonight.
This time, oh Lord, it aint me. 
Instead of sittin' here a'bawlin', bawlin',
I ought to be a crawlin' back to make things right.
Somebody's callin' my little darlin'  darlin'  tonight.

Well she used to always be there whenever I would call,
Waitin for me patiently.
Now my fingers are calloused over from dialin' this old phone.
I guess she's over getting over me. 

Somebody's callin'; callin' my little darlin'  darlin'  tonight.
This time, oh Lord, it aint me. 
Instead of sittin' here a'bawlin', bawlin',
I ought to be a crawlin' back to make things right.
Somebody's callin' my little darlin'  darlin'  tonight.

Instead of sittin' here a'bawlin', bawlin',
I ought to be a crawlin' back to make things right.
Somebody's callin' my little darlin'  darlin'  tonight.
