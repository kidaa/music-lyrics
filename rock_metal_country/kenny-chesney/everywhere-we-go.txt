Well I just found this old picture in my wallet
Of you and me, down in Mexico
Just look at us there on that beach, on that blanket
That look on our face says all you need to know

Seems like everywhere we go baby love goes everywhere
Everytime our hearts meet love is all around us
Every road we take darlin' love takes
Every turn, livin' right inside us
I believe love goes
Everywhere we go

Sometimes I dream, we're alone on an island
Nowhere to go, we don't want to leave
All that we have is a world full of time
We spend it all on you and me
It's all that we need

Seems like everywhere we go baby love goes everywhere
Everytime our hearts meet, love is all around us
Every road we take, darlin' love takes
Every turn, livin' right inside us
I believe love goes
Everywhere we go

I'm so alive when I'm near you
This fire in my heart lights the world when I'm with you

Every road we take, darlin' love takes
Every turn, livin' right inside us
I believe love goes
Everywhere we go
I believe love goes
Everywhere we go
Everywhere we go
