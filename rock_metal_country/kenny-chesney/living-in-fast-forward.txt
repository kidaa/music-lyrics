The body's a temple, that's what we're told
I've treated this one like an old honky-tonk
Greasy cheeseburgers and cheap cigarettes
One day they'll get me if they ain't got me yet

'Cause I'm living in fast forward
A hillbilly rock star out of control
I'm living in fast forward
Now I need to rewind real slow

My friends all grew up, they settled down
Built nice little houses on the outskirts of town
They work in their office, drive SUVs
They pray for their babies and they worry 'bout me

'Cause I'm living in fast forward
A hillbilly rock star out of control
I'm living in fast forward
Now I need to rewind real slow

I'm always runnin'
Son of a gunnin'
I've had a good time it's true
But the way I've been goin'
It's time that I toned it
Down just a notch or two

Oh yeah ...

Well I'm living in fast forward
A hillbilly rock star out of control
I'm living in fast forward
Now I need to rewind real slow

Well I'm living in fast forward
A hillbilly rock star out of control
I'm living in fast forward
Now I need to rewind real slow

Yeah I need to rewind real slow
Yeah I still got some miles to go
