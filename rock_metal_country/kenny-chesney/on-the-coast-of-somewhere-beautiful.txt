Knew I could never hold that girl
She was born to see the world
All I got is a picture she mailed me
Barefoot in the snow white sand
A bag of sea shells in her hand
She finally found a paradise it seems

On the coast of somewhere beautiful
Trade winds blowin through her hair
Sunlight dancin on the water 
And I wish I was there
Don't know how I'm goin' to find her
All I know so far
She's on the coast of somewhere beautiful
Runnin' with my heart

Sometimes whne the sun goes down
Shadows fall across this little town
And I close my eyes and I drift away
to another place in another time
When the world was ours and she was mine
I dream of holdin her again someday

On the coast of somewhere beautiful
Trade winds blowin through her hair
Sunlight dancin on the water
And I wish I was there
Dont know how I'm gonna find her
All I know so far
Shes on a coast somewhere beautiful
Runnin with my heart

Dont know how I'm goin to find her
All i know so far
Shes on the coast of somewhere beautiful
Runnin with my heart
Ohh Shes runnin with my heart 
On the coast of somewhere beautiful
