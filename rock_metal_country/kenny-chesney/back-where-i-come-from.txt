In the town where I was raised 
The clock ticks and the cattle graze 
Time passed with Amazing Grace 
Back where I come from 
Now you can lie on a riverbank 
Paint your name on a water tank 
Or miscount all the beers you drank 
Back where I come from 

Back where I come from 
Where I'll be when it's said and done 
I'm proud as anyone 
Back where I come from 

We learned in Sunday school 
Who made the sun shine through 
I know who made the moonshine, too 
Back where I come from 
Blue eyes on a Saturday night 
Tan legs in the broad day light 
TV's, they were black and white 
Back where I come from 

Back where I come from 
Where I'll be when it's said and done 
I'm proud as anyone 
Back where I come from 

Some say it's a backward place 
Narrow minds on a narrow way 
I make it a point to say 
That that's where I come from 

That's where I come from 
Where I'll be when it's said and done 
I'm proud as anyone 
That's where I come from 
Back where I come from 
I'm an old Tennessean 
And I'm proud as anyone 
That's where I come from 
That's where I come from 
That's where I come from
