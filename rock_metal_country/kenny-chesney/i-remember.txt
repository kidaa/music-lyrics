I'm sittin here alone 
Thoughts of you run wild
I'm longin for your touch 
Holded by your smile
No use tryin to erase 
No one could ever take your place 

Well I remember how it used to feel 
back when our love was strong and real 
And I remember tears in your eyes 
As I looked at you and said goodbye 
All I want right now is to forget
Every single thing that I regret 
And drown out these embers..but I remember 

It's yesterday again
Here inside my mind
And I can't find a way 
to leave your love behind
I wanna wake up to the day
Your memory won't stand in my way

Well I remember how it used to feel 
back when our love was strong and real
And I remember tears in your eyes
As I looked at you and said goodbye
All I want right now is to forget
Every single thing that I regret
And drown out these embers..but I remember 

Well I wanna wake up to the day
Your memory won't stand in my way

Well I remember how it used to feel
Back when our love was strong and real
And I remember tears in your eyes
As I looked at you and said goodbye
All I want right now is to forget
Every single thing that I regret
And drown out these embers..but I remember
And I remember..ohhhhhh 
Oh I remember ya baby...
All of you my baby
