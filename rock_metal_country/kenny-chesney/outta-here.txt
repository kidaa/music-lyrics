paradise our final destination, as long as we're outta here

There aint no time like the present day sail, lets cruise all the way down A1A, put the top

long as we're together

South of the border there's a place i know where james taylor sang about mexico and the suns
so hot we'll foget to go home, baby we'll be outta here

Any where you want to go as long as its sunny weather, let the time fly by, i dont mind, as
long we're together

As long as we're outta here, baby lets get outta here

Outta here
