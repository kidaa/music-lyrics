She's got every quality
From A all the way to Z
It's easy to see she's the perfect girl
She's got every single thing
That makes up my wildest dreams
Sometimes I still can't quite believe she's holdin me cause

She got it all
My heart, my soul, my wishes
All of my love, my hugs, my kisses
Everything that means anything at all
All of my life I've spent a hopin'
I could give someone such devotion
Every sweet memory I can recall
She got it all

You know that I admit
That someone to love like this
Only existed in my prayers
Until I saw her face
I knew I'd found the place
Where I could keep my every faith eternally 'cause

She got it all 
My heart, my soul, my wishes
All of my love, my hugs, my kisses
Everything that means anything at all
All of my life I've spent a hopin'
I could give someone such devotion
Every sweet memory I can recall
She got it all

All of my life I've spent a hopin'
I could give someone such devotion
Every sweet memory I can recall

All of my heart, my soul, my wishes
All of my love, my hugs, my kisses
Everything sweet memory I can recall
She got it all

She's got it all
