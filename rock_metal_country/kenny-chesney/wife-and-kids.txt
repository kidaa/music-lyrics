Everybody thinks I've got it all
Nobody really does, do they?
I've got more than I deserve, more than I ever dreamed
But there's always a price you pay
It's been an amazing road
I've been blessed, I know
But at the end of the day I go home alone

I still hope someday I'll have a wife and kids
Smiling faces running to the door when I walk in
Saying "Daddy's home, you were gone too long. What'd you bring me? Swing me. Let me show you what I did"
I still dream about that look on a woman's face
That says I love you through the good, the bad, the sunshine or the rain
Sometimes I wish I had someone to share my life with
Maybe I'll have a wife and kids
Maybe someday....

Maybe I could have a son
Play football in the backyard
Or take my daughter fishin', and when she turns 15 teach her how to drive a car
When I grow old and they've all left home
I want to lay beside my wife and talk about the old times, remember all the good times.

I still hope someday I'll have a wife and kids
Smiling faces running to the door when I walk in
Saying "Daddy's home, you were gone too long. What'd you bring me? Swing me. Let me show you what I did"
I still dream about that look on a woman's face
That says I love you through the good, the bad, the sunshine or the rain
Sometimes I wish I had someone to share my life with
Maybe I'll have a wife and kids
Maybe someday....

Sometimes I wish I had someone to share my life with
Maybe I'll have a wife and kids
Someday...
I'll have a wife and kids
Maybe someday...
