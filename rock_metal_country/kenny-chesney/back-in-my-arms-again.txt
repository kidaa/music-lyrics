People always say that hindsight's 20/20
When it comes to mistakes in love, girl I got plenty
But the one that sticks out the most in my mind
Is the night I left you standing on the front porch crying 
Living for the day I could make it all up to you 

Til your back in my arms, back in my arms again
Til your back in my arms, I'll be oh lonesome 'til then
Now honey I wont' eat, I won't even sleep
I'll be walking these soles off of both of my feet
Til your back in my arms, back in my arms again 

Well I'm getting to know this old town like never before
Walking every street, knocking on every door
Girl, whereever you are, I want you back
I love you baby, and I'm sure 'bout that
Whatever it takes, there's nothing that I won't do 

Til your back in my arms, back in my arms again
Til your back in my arms, I'll be oh lonesome 'til then
Now honey I wont' eat, I won't even sleep
I'll be walking these soles off of both of my feet
Til your back in my arms, back in my arms again 

I must have been a fool, I confess
To ever let you go, now I ain't gonna rest 

Til your back in my arms, back in my arms again
Til your back in my arms, I'll be oh lonesome 'til then
Now honey I wont' eat, I won't even sleep
I'll be walking these soles off of both of my feet
Til your back in my arms, back in my arms again
