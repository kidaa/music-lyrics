There's something sacred when your 17 
'Bout a football jacket and a high school ring 
And it sure looked nice when you wore mine 

That late October at the homecoming dance 
We slipped outside and we took a chance 
In the middle of the night it sure felt right 
We let go right then and there 
We were loved and we were scared 

 For the first time 
Lovin' blind we dove right in 
For the first 
We gave everything and then 
Graduation came 
And our dreams called our names 
With broken hearts we moved on with our lives 
For the first time 

Well I heard the other day 
You're a Sunday school teacher 
Got the PTA, got a real good life 
You're a real good wife 
I'm living in this circus world 
No I ain't married but I got a girl 
And I'm her man and we're making plans 
But I still smile when I think of us 
Together we learned how to love 

For the first time 
Lovin' blind we dove right in 
For the first 
We gave everything and then 
Graduation came 
And our dreams called our names 
With broken hearts we moved on with our lives 
For the first time 

Graduation came 
And our dreams called our names 
With broken hearts we moved on with our lives 
For the first time 

For the first time 
Lovin' blind we dove right in 
For the first time 
We gave everything and then 
For the first time 
We moved on with our lives 
For the first time
