Sometimes they're in a bottle,
Sometimes a pair of high-heel shoes,
Some come rolled in paper
Some have six strings and only play the blues
Once you've met the devil
There ain't no way he'll let you be
When I'm not chasing demons,
There's demons chasing me

Skeletons in closets
Ghosts underneath the bed
They hide out in pictures
And words better left unsaid
They hang around like perfume
And haunt me like an ancient melody
When I'm not chasing demons,
There's demons chasing me

There's things that I can't leave alone
'Cause they won't leave me alone
What I want ain't what I need
Still I reach for the things I crave
Then try to run away
Am I afraid of being free
'Cause when I'm not chasing demons
There's demons chasing me

So roll one up and light it
Pick up my old guitar
I'm playing crossroads
Drinking whiskey from a mason jar
Heartache at my front door
Says she needs my company
When I'm not chasing demons
There's demons chasing me

There's things that I can't leave alone
'Cause they won't leave me alone
What I want ain't what I need
Still I reach for the things I crave
Then try to run away
Am I afraid of being free
'Cause when I'm not chasing demons
There's demons chasing me

When I'm not chasing demons
There's demons chasing me

Demons chasing me [repeats]
