In a little town down south
There's a little clapboard house
With a wolf outside the door
In the bedroom there's a light
That's been staying on all night
For atleast a month or more
The heartaches and the bills keep coming due
And with all they're going through.... 

It's no small miracle that love hangs on
Hearts get weary when hope is gone
In a world where roses wither and die
It's no small miracle when love survives 

It's been uphill for a while
But he still makes her smile
Every now and then
Lately they've been findin' out
It's the little things that count
And they do what they can
He tells her he loves her everyday
She says things will be okay 

It's no small miracle that love hangs on
Hearts get weary when hope is gone
In a world where roses wither and die
It's no small miracle when love survives 

In a world where roses wither and die
It's no small miracle when love survives
