Gonna cash my check before the drive-thru closes
Get my baby a couple Quick Sack roses
Put $5 worth of gas in my pride and joy
Another Friday night in the life of a country boy 

Gonna take her out to the Tasty Freeze then
We'll go dancin' at the American Legion
When ole Bobby does Elvis
You'll swear it was the real mccoy
Another Friday night in the life of a country boy 

Aww there ain't much to do 
In this one life town
But we don't let that 
Slow us down
If it's too quiet
We make our own noise
Now you can bet your boots
By the end of the week
My pretty little girl
Is ready for me
Another Friday night in the life of a country boy 

When we've had enough of that shakin' and a-shoutin'
We go fog up the windows in the Smoky Mountains
We have more fun than a couple of tourists and a Polaroid
Another Friday night in the lift of a country boy 

Aww there ain't much to do 
In this one life town
But we don't let that 
Slow us down
If it's too quiet
We make our own noise
Now you can bet your boots
By the end of the week
My pretty little girl
Is ready for me
Another Friday night in the life of a country boy
