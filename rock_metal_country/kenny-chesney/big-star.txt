She was aware of her insecurities as she took the stage
She was convinced if she got up there that she'd be discovered someday

So she belted it
She hit the high notes fearlessly
Oh she melted them, as she brought them to their feet

She was a big star at Banana Joe's bar where
She sang karaoke everynight
She said if you work hard to get where you are it feels good in the hot spot light 
She was a big star

She made the local cable shows where the camera fell in love with her face
After a couple of weekends the groupies were crawling all over the place
She signed autographs like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt 
and in the aftermath, that small time town was hers

She was a big star at Banana Joe's bar where
She sang karaoke everynight
She said if you work hard to get where you are it feels good in the hot spot light 
She was a big star

She doesn't care anymore that her high school girlfriends cut her down 
They only thought she entertains is where they are and where she is now

All her old neighbors swear their certain she slept her way to the top
She knows you don't get where your going unless you got something they ain't got

So she sings tonight to 20,000 plus and the young girls scream out loud
Man that could be us
She's a big star as she eats caviar just before she performs every night
She says if you work hard to get where you are it feels good in the hot spot light
She's a big star
She's a big star
