Steel drums still ringing in my head
Well I feel pain, So I'm not dead
From the looks of things, it looks like
It got a little crazy last night

Could I get your name again?
Some situation that we're in
Woke up by each others side
It got a little crazy last night

Last thing I remember
I told the bartender it's rum and whatever you have
First one drink, then two then I woke up with you so I know things can't be all that bad
But it's still a little hazy, it got a little crazy last night

Are these your shoes that I have on?
Is this your bed, is this your home?
All I know is, it's not mine
It got a little crazy last night

Last thing I remember
I told the bartender it's rum and whatever you have
First one drink, then two then I woke up with you so I know things can't be all that bad
But it's still a little hazy, it got a little crazy last night

I think I feel a fresh tattoo
What is it of, I wish I knew
It couldn't get more out of sight
It got a little crazy last night

Last thing I remember
I told the bartender it's rum and whatever you have
First one drink, then two then I woke up with you so I know things can't be all that bad
But it's still a little hazy, suns a shady, think she might have paid me, it got a little crazy last night

Got a little crazy
Got a little crazy
