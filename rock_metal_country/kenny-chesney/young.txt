Looking back now, well it makes me laugh 
We were growin our hair, we were cuttin' class 
Knew it all already, there was nothing to learn 
We were strikin' matches just to watch 'em burn 

Listen to our music just a little too loud 
We were hangin' in there with the outcast crowd 
Headin' to the rapids with some discount beer 
It was a long train tussle but we had no fear. 

Man I don't know, where the time goes 
But It sure goes fast, just like that 
We were wanna be rebels who didn't have a clue 
With our Rock n' roll T-shirts, and our typically bad attitudes 
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done 
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly
Young 

Talked a good game when we were out with the guys 
But in the back seat we were awkward and shy 
Girls were a mystery that we couldn't explain 
And I guess there are some things that are never gonna change 

Man I don't know, where the time goes 
But It sure goes fast, just like that 
We were wanna be rebels who didn't have a clue 
With our Rock n' roll T-shirts, and our typically bad attitudes 
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done 
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly
Young 
Young, Young, Yeah Wishin' we were older 
Young, Hey I wish it wasn't over 

Man I don't know, where the time goes 
But It sure goes fast, just like that 
We were wanna be rebels who didn't have a clue 
With our Rock n' roll T-shirts, and our typically bad attitudes 
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done 
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly
Young 
Young, Hey wishin' we were older, wish it wasn't over
