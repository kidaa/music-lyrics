Sunny days seem to hurt the most. 
I wear the pain like a heavy coat. 
I feel you everywhere I go. 
I see your smile, I see your face, 
I hear you laughin' in the rain. 
I still can't believe you're gone. 

It ain't fair: you died too young, 
Like the story that had just begun, 
But death tore the pages all away. 
God knows how I miss you, 
All the hell I've been through, 
Just knowin' no-one could take your place. 
An' sometimes I wonder, 
Who'd you be today? 

Would you see the world? Would you chase your dreams? 
Settle down with a family, 
I wonder what would you name your babies? 
Some days the sky's so blue, 
I feel like I can talk to you, 
An' I know it might sound crazy. 

It ain't fair: you died too young, 
Like the story that had just begun, 
But death tore the pages all away. 
God knows how I miss you, 
All the hell I've been through, 
Just knowin' no-one could take your place. 
An' sometimes I wonder, 
Who you'd be today? 

Today, today, today. 
Today, today, today. 

[Instrumental Break]

Sunny days seem to hurt the most. 
I wear the pain like a heavy coat. 
The only thing that gives me hope, 
Is I know I'll see you again some day. 

Some day, some day, some day.
