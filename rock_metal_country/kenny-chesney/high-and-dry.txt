last night I think I put that homefire out,
I came in late and lit to a cold dark house.
I guess she thinks she's got me good this time
She took all of hers and most of mine. 

She left me High
but I ain't dry
I've got beer
and tears to cry
Well I should be feeling low
Up that creek that we all know
Yeah that woman left me high
but I ain't dry 

Say hey bartender fill 'er up again
let's just keep me in the shape i'm in
and if I can't get her memory to drown
uh oh
Well I'll take it for a swim all over town 

She left me high
but I ain't dry
I've got beer
and tears to cry
Well I should be feeling low
up that creek that we all know
yeah that woman left me high
but I ain't dry 

Well, I should be feeling low
up that creek that we all know
yeah that woman left me high
but I ain't dry
