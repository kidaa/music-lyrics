Spirit walker, spirit walker 
Too much living on the fringe 
Please come here 
And sample my love. 

Spirit walker, desonara ? 
Shields her eye from the sun 
Truns from the wind 
Feeling the burn, from reaching within 

NUrsing around feelings 
Holding the llama's milk and ? 
Puring it thorugh the center 
Can it be all around us 
Coating us with the kind word 
Words are alive with feelings 
I am a lively spirit, I am a lively spirit... 

Spirit walker, happy laugher 
Trying hard to find it all 
Sealing your fate 
Fate will allow 
Have faith in us all 

Spirit walker, spirit walker 
Don't get me wrong 
I'd follow you down 
Just love me back 
And I will respond
