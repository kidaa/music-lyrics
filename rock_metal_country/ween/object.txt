You're just an object to me 
I'd like to get to know you better 
Paste you across my body 
You're just an object to me 

You're just a piece of meat 
And I am the butcher 
I love you better, love you forever 
You're just an object to me 

Why sit in the shade 
Drink what we made from our lovers cup 
Dreams don't always come when you fall asleep 
You're just an object to me 

I'm gonna do something wrong 
Nobody's gonna like it 
But I've got my pride and my time isn't free 
You're just an object to me 

You're just an object to me 
I feel a little better 
They found your sweater 
You're just an object to me
