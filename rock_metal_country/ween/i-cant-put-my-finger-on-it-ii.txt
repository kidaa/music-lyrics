[chanting] 

Is it alive, does it writhe 
Can it survive under the sun? 
I can't put my finger on it 
Is it green, is it red 
Is it alive or is it dead 
I can't put my finger on it 
Scathe with a lathe 
All the days in the past 
I can't put my finger on it 
Is it brown, is it white 
Is it really outta sight 
I can't put my finger on it 

Do you know what I'm saying? 
Do you know what I'm saying, people? 

Can it squeal, does it squirm 
If it's fresh will it burn? 
I can't put my finger on it 
Can it fly, will it try 
If the wings are still wet? 
I can't put my finger on it 
Can it heal, is it real 
Can it feel the threads of time? 
I can't put my finger on it 
Does it glow, will it shine 
Does it leave a trail of slime 
I can't put my finger on it I tell you one time... 

Are you surprised when I touch the dwarf inside? 
Repeat three times 
Repeat first verse 

Ha ha ha...oh yeah, oh yeah!
