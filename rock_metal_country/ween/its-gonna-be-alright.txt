Baby what have I done 
Gone and left you, all alone 
It's hard for me to sing this song 
We've been together for so long 
I think I know what my soul's got to say 
And it won't hurt as bad, someday 

It's gonna be alright, baby 
It's gonna be alright, love 
And if the mist ever lets the sun through 
I'll just hope I did the right thing for me and you 

Guess I'm ruled by my heart 
Built a life and I tore it all apart 
It's just not our time 
But you'll find a new love, and you'll be fine 
So many dark and lonely nights 
But I believe someday I'll see the light It's gonna be alright, baby 
It's gonna be alright, love 
And if the mist ever lets the sun through 
I'll just hope I did the right thing for me and you 
[repeat] 

For me and you
