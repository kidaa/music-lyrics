Take me away to some other land thank you 
I gotta get away from that girl before I go crazy 
She took my love away 
She took it to another man 
Now I gotta get away from that girl 
Before I go craaaazy 

Repeat twice 

Take me, take me away 

Gotta get away 
Crazy 
She took my love away 
Now I gotta get away, oh 

Repeat first verse
