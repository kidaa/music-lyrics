[studio version appears on ";The Pod";] 

Stu's back on stage, ladies and gentlemen, Stu! 
Ha ha ha ha! 
We got Stu back! 
    Reggaejunkiejew! 
I know... I know how you feel 
You want your jew 
He's doin' hard time, fuckin' federal petenen- penitentiary 
Uh oh 

Pork roll egg and cheese on a kaiser bun 
[repeat throughout background of song] 

I met her at the Living Earth Show 
She crossed the room, the lights sank low 
We're together, she really digs me -- she fucks me 
Who could think I could be so happy? 
When I'm cold, I know she's keepin' me warm 
We're together, she really digs me -- she fucks me 

She's in my arms, she's in my heart, yeah 
Pins and needles up and down my spine 
We're together, she really digs me now 
She fucks me, she fucks me 
She fucks me 

She fucks me 
Right on 

She fucks me, D.C. 
On the downlow 
We love you, D.C.
