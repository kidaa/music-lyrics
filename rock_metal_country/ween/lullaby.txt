Floating like a ghost man 
Floating like a baby 
Swaying in a mother's arm 
Sleeping like a baby 

Fans stay all in light, 
And friends day all in hide 

For they talk him up, together 
Together there's life flowing 

Sending for the season 
Flowers for the rapture 
Shield her from the fire 
Flowers for the sleeping 

Fans stay all in light 
And friends stay all in hide 

For they don't get up, together 
Together, there's life flowing 

Soldier, child of honor 
Sleeping like a baby 
Swaying in his mother's arm 
Floating like a ghost man 

Fans stay all in light 
And friends stay all in hide 

Fallen talk it out, together 
Together, there's life flowing.
