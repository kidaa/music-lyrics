[studio version appears on ";Chocolate & Cheese";] 

Alright, this is a song - what the fuck was that? - 
This is from ";Chocolate & Cheese";, this is a - this is a song 
That we wrote uh - 
I don't know, probably when we wrote the rest of the songs 
From ";Chocolate & Cheese"; 
It's about a little boy and his pony 
Yeah! 
Sick little pony, coughing up snot 
And uh- can't seem to diagnose the diagnosis 
Ha, ha, ha! 
It's called ";Mister, Would You Please Help My Pony?"; 
Thank you! By Ween. 

Two Three Four! 

Mister, would you please help my pony? 
He's over there behind the tree 
He's down in the dirt, would ya help him? 
I think it's his lung 

Mister would you please help my pony? 
He's over there lookin' at me 
He's cryin' like a baby, would you help him? 
I think it's his lung 

Mister, would you please help my pony? 
He's down and he ain't gettin' up 
He coughed up snot in the driveway 
And I think his lung's fucked up 

Pony, Pony, Pony 

Mister, would you please help my pony? 
He's over there lookin' at me 
He can't talk because he's a pony 
I think it's his lung 

Mister, would you please help my pony? 
He's down and he ain't gettin' up 
He coughed up snot in the driveway 
And I think his lung's fucked up 

That was pretty good... 
That was one of the better versions of ";Pony"; I've heard all week
