Bop-shoo-wanne-wanne        

Up on the hill, down by the river 
By the ocean, across the field 
By the word of the boognish 
I said, ";Lordy lordy lord, I'm comin' home"; 
Lordy lordy lord, I'm comin' home 

When I was younger my momma told me 
She said ";Gener, I wanna smell it."; 
And then she smelled it and it was smelly 
And she said, ";Lordy lordy lord, I'm comin' home"; 
Lordy lordy lord, I'm comin' home In a dream said he was comin' 
Boognish was risin' up from the mist 
He held the scepter of wealth and power 
And said, ";By god, I've come to take you home."; 
By god, I've come to take you home
