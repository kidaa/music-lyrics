It was a cold, dark night 
No hope in sight 
I left my little hut 
And went to the palm 
To get some guava 

Licking the palm for guava 
Licking the palm for guava 
Yes, when you're old and you're not very young 
Lick the palm for guava 
Lick the palm 
When you're old and you're not very young 
Lick the palm for guava
