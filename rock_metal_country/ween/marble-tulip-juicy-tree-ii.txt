Great...it would be the greatest thing 

I don't know you you are, I don't know who you want to be 
When I carbonate the test tube, then you won't see me 
I've got a twin cab diesel combo, it takes me where I want to go 
And all the nuphies are happy, they know of a fungus that grow 
So when you see Hoecke's mind screw don't come running to me 
'Cause I will scream and set aflame marble tulip juicy tree 

Marble tulip juicy tree -- it's where I want to be 
When I gnaw on the tulip it'll wish that it was me 

Every morning I put my shoes on and I think about she 
Who controls the four seasons inhaling kitties in the see 
It's like a noodle in a salad -- little birdy wants to be set free-ee 
I drill the corpse lobe with my mommy -- marble tulip juicy tree 
So this song's about the loving thing that you are to me 
Just stay away from my adenoids and marble tulip juicy tree 

Marble tulip juicy tree -- it's where I want to be 
When I gnaw on the tulip it'll wish that it was me 

Look now I hold the world in my hands 
Whoo, seems like awakened trance 
Up on the hill, down by the river 
By the ocean across the field 
By the word of the Boognish 
I said, ";Lordy, lord, lord, I'm comin' home"; 
In a dream, said he was coming 
Boognish was risin' 
Up from the mist....... 
[more inaudible ranting] 

Whoo!
