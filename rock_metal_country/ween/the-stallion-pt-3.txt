Mach 10 at sudden speed, flying into the wind now 
I'm flowing at my feet something of likeness to you now 
I spotted you in the sun, I called your name from a distance 
I knew you were the one, I called again 

I do declare I can float in the air 
And with some love from above you must 

Don't caress the weasel and don't fall too soon 
Don't seek the blood from the panther 
Don't take a trip to you soon 
I'm the one helding the time back from the sun 
As I scope the lobe 

I am the one who controls the sun 
And I know that things will pass as time elapse, lapses 

Time elapses through the sound of you 
And the things we could do 
Just think of the master 
Trying to fool the blastman 
Check the cards at the table 
Scream softly you are able 

To see the sign of thineself as throughout the ages of time 
Things you thought weren't going to climb the mountain 

See the sun 
Touch the waves of the Earth 
Feel the grass softly 
And don't think for the one you know 
I am screaming backwards in the sand 

Hey, dude, he's the stallion 
Yo, dude, he's the stallion 
Dude, he's the stallion
