I feel a tick in my head and he's sucking on my head 
In the morning i'll be dead if he doesn't leave my head 
Why can't he go away why does he have to stay 
Maybe he wanna play but I can only say 

That I'll get you, I'll burn you, I'll crush you, I'll flush you down, down 
The toilet where you'll spiral around-round 
Awww, tick -- mmm tick tick tick -- brr tick 

I tried to get rid of my plague but I left some of his leg 
And he grew back pretty quick so I stabbed the little prick 
But now I cut my head -- in the morning I'll be dead 
But even after still he'll find someone to kill 

And he'll get you, I'll burn you, I'll crush you, I'll flush you down, down 
The toilet where you'll spiral around-round 
Awww, tick -- mmm tick tick tick -- brr tick 
Awww, tick -- mmm tick tick tick -- brr tick 
Awww, tick -- mmm tick tick tick -- brr tick
