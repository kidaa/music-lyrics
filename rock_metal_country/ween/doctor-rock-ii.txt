I sit home and make flower bouquets and listen to Joni Mitchell 

Try modulating and articulating all the feelings that I have for you 
Dr. Rock -- help me out for I need to shout it 
Dr. Rock -- quickly Derek run & get your mammy 
There is no denying that you been supplying in a slathering ball of flesh 
Dr. Rock -- come quickly to see the scene 
Dr. Rock -- got everything that you need 

Dont conceal your tragic flaw -- give the Dr. Rock a call 
Dr. Rock -- come quickly to see the scene 
Dr. Rock -- got everything that you need 
You're the apple of my eye -- but with some aid I feel you'll die 
Dr. Rock -- save the soul from a bottomless pit 
Dr. Rock -- and see what you can make of it 

You like the suffocating on a small crustation as you hammered your way to the truth 
Dr. Rock -- was examined by an Indian eye 
Dr. Rock -- another lie that youre going to die 
Try modulating and articulating all the feelings that I have for you 
Dr. Rock -- help me out for I need to shout it 
Dr. Rock -- quick Derek run, get your mammy 

Dr. Rock! Dr. Rock! Dr. Rock! Dr. Rock! 
Ahhhhhh Ahhhh Ahhhh 
Ahhhhhh Ahhhh Ahhhh 
Ahhhhhh Ahhhh Ahhhh 
Dr. Rock!
