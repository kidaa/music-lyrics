Where've you been? 
    I was out with Pat 
Was she shootin' shit?

Talkin' to some joe, hangin' out shootin' shit 
Tries to tell me somethin', I play it off legit 

How did you handle it?

So pleasant when the sails of the seas of orion gently slip 
No more need for God's sorrow, I just play it off legit 

Dude's hounding this bitch, okay, I'm checkin' out the shit laughin' yeah 
Later on I'll fuck her oh man, she knows I'm legit 
She does? I didn't know that That's right From the start

A sexy scorpion that stings her with wit

I'm really not that legit, my mom bought it 
She wasn't playing it off legit either Nah, she knows I'm legit 
Did you clap when you saw her? 
I clapped when I saw her, when I found her, you split 
When I'm on the go, you know I'm legit
