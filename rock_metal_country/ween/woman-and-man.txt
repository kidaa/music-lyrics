Once there was one 
Once there was only one 
A foot, a hand, a tongue 
Talking to no one 
And no one made nothing 
To ease the balance it split in two 
The old line became creation 
And we saw bodies forming 
From rib and from monkey 
Half became the whole 
A race of man and woman 

Woman and man 
Woman and man working together 
I can show you, teach you something 
If you listen, man and woman 
Woman and man working together 

Ocean and land 
Ocean is land covered with water 
I can tell you, in my answer 
If you listen, man and woman 
Ocean is land covered with water 

Killing for life 
Life is a fight, let's fight it together 
I can teach, teach you something 
If you listen, man and woman 
Life is a fight, let's fight it together
