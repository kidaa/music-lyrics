Strap on that there jammy pac 
Get a grip on your soul 
Sip on that there family flask, 
And I'll guide you towards the door 
She don't feed me in the mornin' 
And I can't take no more 
So strap on that there jammy pac, 
And get up off my floor 

Strap on that there jammy pac 
And slide a double dime my way 
Dry off your distributor cap, 
And hip me to the game you play 
She's jonesin' for a jammy 
With a girl that I call Tammy, 
So strap on that there jammy pac, 
It's time for you to pay Strap on that there jammy pac 
She hypnotized one dude 
Stains you like a heart attack 
Van Winkle says ";Fuck you."; 
Never made me no supper 
A boy like me needs it, too 
So strap on that there jammy pac, 
It's time to pay your due
