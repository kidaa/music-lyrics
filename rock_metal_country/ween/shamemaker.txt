When I feel ashamed 
I get so scared 
It makes me wanna hurt you 
Shamemaker 

My body aches 
And I feel alone 
I'm in a very defensive place 
Shamemaker 

Oh oh-oh ooh! 
Feel the feeling oh! 
Process feelings 
Feel it in the belly 
Like a yellow worm with teeth 

Oh oh-oh ooh! 
Bring it down, don't think too much 
Feel the feeling 
Let it have its way til it says good bye 
Go! 

I need to breathe 
Just need to breathe 
Don't walk away 
Shamemaker 

Touch me 
You need to touch me 
But I'm afraid 
Shamemaker 

Oh oh-oh ooh! 
Feel the feeling oh! 
Process feelings 
Feel it in the belly 
Like a yellow worm with teeth 

Oh oh-oh ooh! 
Bring it down dont think too much 
Feel the feeling 
Let it have its way til it says good bye 
Let it have its way til it says good bye 

Let it go 
Shamemaker
