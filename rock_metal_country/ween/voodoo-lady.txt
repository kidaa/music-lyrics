Voodoo Lady 
Shakin' that stick and drivin' me crazy 
Your eyes look red and hazy 
Doin' that stuff that you do 
Messin' me up with your voodoo 

You drive me crazy with that 
Boogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie 
You drive me crazy with that 
Boogie boogie boogie 

Your lips are hot and spicy 
Servin' up red beans and rice 
At midnite she's a-howlin' and stompin' 
Makin' love to the gators in the swampin' 

[chorus] 

I feel you now inside me 
Never once did you deny me 
Doin' that stuff that you do 
Knockin' me out with your voodoo Repeat Chorus 

Voodoo lady, shakin' that stick, drivin' me crazy 
Voodoo lady, oh yeah 

Boogie boogie boogie boogie 
[repeats] 

Repeat first verse 
Repeat Chorus
