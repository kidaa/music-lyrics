As she bounces through the blue sky
Everybody's building up a big blue balloon
They made the string from fairy wings and golden dreams
See how high it goes
No one knows about the blue balloon
She's defied the eyes of all man
Sliding over and down the big blue balloon
Can the father's love reach the child above the clouds
So as to dance the day up high
Way up high, above the blue balloon
Blue, blue balloon
My soul calls to you
See her bounce along the banks of Buckinow
She's a sweet surprise and odd why accepting all
Beating along the paths, boulder caps and icicles
She melts into the earth and blows the air back to the central
Blue balloon
Blue, blue balloon
My soul calls to you
Blue balloon
