Shitting on my face... 
I'll count us in ah, ok 
1, 2, 3, 4 

I heard my brother weepin' in the dead of the night 
I said, ";Dude, man, you feelin' alright"; 
Gener said nothin' and continued to weep 
I caught Papa Gene Ween cryin' in his sleep 

I saw Gener cryin' in his sleep 
I tried to wake him up but he made not a peep 
I saw Gener cryin' in his sleep 

Life at the top can be tough 
Sometimes you think you've seen enough 
But you can find a diamond in the rough 
But when it's time for bed, you shouldn't think about that stuff 

Yeah, I saw Gener cryin' in his sleep 
I tried to wake him up but he made not a peep 
I saw Gener cryin' in his sleep 

Danny! 
Alright! 

[chorus] 

Danny!

Thank you, we're Ween
