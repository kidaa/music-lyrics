When you've had your fun, and your work is done, you must not 
Succumb 
I can feel you breathe, it's like a mega-weedge inside, 
Please don't hide 

So mom, if you please, pass me the pork roll egg and cheese 
If you please, on a kaiser bun 
Mom, if you please, pass me the pork roll egg and cheese 
If you please, on a kaiser bun 

When the guava's drained, Eddie Dingle remains 
But we must further ourselves on 
So dynamic is life, staring into the sight's 
Not right, but wrong in a good way 

So mom, if you please, pass me the pork roll egg and cheese 
If you please, on a kaiser bun 
Mom, if you please, pass me the pork roll egg and cheese 
If you please, on a kaiser bun 

When you've had your fun, and your work is done, you must not succumb 
I can feel you breathe, it's like a mega-weedge inside, 
Please don't hide 

So mom, if you please, pass me the pork roll egg and cheese 
If you please, on a kaiser bun 
Mom, if you please, pass me the pork roll egg and cheese 
If you please, on a kaiser bun 
Mom, if you please, pass me the pork roll egg and cheese 
If you please, on a kaiser bun 

Kaiser bun 
Pork roll egg and cheese 
Zzzz... eeezz..
