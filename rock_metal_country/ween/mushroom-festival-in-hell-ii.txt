We're Ween, it's 1991! 
And we are here to play you music 
Now this song is called ";Mushroom Festival In Hell";. 

The wind is howling and the time is right for fear 
In the emergence in the phosphorescent tears 
And all the hippies gonna lick the mind of god? 
They've already been immersed in the wad 

The wind is howling and the sea is boiling down 
The mind is the water, the mind is the water 
'Cause it's a mushroom festival in hell 
'Cause it's a mushroom festival in hell 

Yeah!
