I'm waving my dick in the wind, waving my dick in the wind 
If it all goes right, I'll be in your arms tonight 
But I'm waving my dick in the wind 

I'm lost in the sauce once again, I'm lost in the sauce once again 
If I make it through the night, everything will be alright 
But I'm lost in the sauce once again 

It's been 97 days since I've laid my head beside you 
And a million miles of highway in between 
There's some red and blue lights that are shinin' right behind me 
And that pig's a pretty mean bastard 

You should have seen old Jimmy Wilson dance 
You should have seen old Jimmy Wilson dance 
Give that boy a dime and you could a chance 
To see old Jimmy Wilson dance 

Dance Jimmy 
    I'm doin' the best I can there, Deaner 
That's it 
    You know I can't really dance like I used to, I mean I try, 
    But I'm an old, old man now 

I've got a real good feelin bout' old Jimmy Wilson 
Sho' nuff' he's got what it takes 
Do another number for me please won't ya Jimmy 
Cause you're a really good dancer 

    Ooh yeah, help me now 

I'm waving my dick in the wind, waving my dick in the wind 
If it all goes right, I'll be in your arms tonight 
But I'm waving my dick in the wind 
Waving my dick in the wind 
Waving my dick in the wind
