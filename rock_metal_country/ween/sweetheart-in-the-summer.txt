She's a sweetheart in the summer 
Summertime is here again 
She's a sweetheart in the summer 
And I hope it never ends 

Winter days that never end 
Frozen nights with you under the covers 
But the lonely time we spend is worth it in the end when summer comes 

Makin' love and holdin' hands 
Rollin' in the sun and sand together 
But every year when summer comes around 
We fall in love again 

She's a sweetheart in the summer 
Summertime is here again 
She's a sweetheart in the summer 
And I hope it never ends 

I'm gonna take you far away 
Pack the car let's get away for a while getaway getaway... 
We'll find a hotel room and call it home for just a couple days 
Love to see your smiling face nothing else is sweeter in the world 
'cause when everything is said and done you will always be my girl 

She's a sweetheart in the summer 
Summertime is here again 
She's a sweetheart in the summer 
And I hope it never ends 

Sweetheart in the summertime 2x 
Uuhuh oh
