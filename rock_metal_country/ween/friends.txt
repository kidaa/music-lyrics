I dreamt of a move 
A great move 
To another place with much more land 
I was driven by car 
And woke before I got there 
I remember the place and it was beautiful 

A friends a friend who knows what being a friend is, talking with a friend. 
As friends we were always so close but so far away... 
Friends in life are special do you want me as your special friend? 
Cause you're the friend that I've been searching for. 

There was more for me 
It would be more open 
Scary to think that I could be happy 
She'd said it was the same road 
But up more, alot more 
Just be patient and we'll get there 

A friends a friend who knows what being a friend is, talking with a friend. 
As friends we were always so close but so far away... 
Friends in life are special do you want me as your special friend? 
Cause you're the friend that I've been searching for. 

I never got there 
But the morning brings light 
And so, I'll keep on looking. 

A friends a friend who knows what being a friend is, talking with a friend.

Friends in life are special do you want me as your special friend?
