Biddley bah boo, biddley bah boo, biddley bah boo bow! 

Mister richard smoker, you're a poopy poker 
Chardonnay & cocaine in the spa 
Cigarettes and coffee breath 
Little boys on crystal meth 
Tonight we'll tango in the street 
You eat dark meat 

Mister richard smoker, you're a chicken choker 
Tonight you're gonna let it all hang out 
Pantyhose and Aqua-Net 
Smoking menthol cigarettes 
Tonight we'll tango in the street 
You eat dark meat 

Biddley bah boo, biddley bah boo, biddley bah boo bow! 
Smoke! 

You eat dark meat 
Biddley bah boo, biddley bah boo, biddley bah boo bow! 

Mister richard smoker, you're an Ono Yoker 
Cognac and black coffee with the boys 
Dancin' in your buster browns 
Whirlin' to the techno sounds 
Your hands are wet, your hair is slick 
You smoke big dick 

Mister richard smoker, you're a velvet coker 
Bruce and Geoff will pick you up at ten 
Goin' out, dancin' in the city 
Friday night, gotta look pretty 
Tonight we'll tango in the street 
You eat dark meat 

Biddley bah boo, biddley bah boo, biddley bah boo bow! 
Biddley bah boo, biddley bah boo, biddley bah boo bow, yeah! 
Biddley bah boo, biddley bah boo, biddley bah boo bow, smoke! 
Biddley bah boo, biddley bah boo, biddley bah boo bow!
