I don't wanna leave you on the farm 
I don't wanna leave you on the farm 
I don't wanna go 
Oh, just so ya know 
I don't wanna leave you on the farm 

Days go by and I'm still high 
But you know I'm thinkin' about you 
Corn's turned brown, leaves fall to the ground 
It's a sound that reminds me of you 

I don't wanna leave you on the farm 
I don't wanna leave you on the farm 
I don't wanna go 
Oh, just so ya know 
I don't wanna leave you on the farm No telephone to call you at home 
I'm alone on the throne 
Go get somethin', hey, thanks for nothin' 
I'll keep truckin' and gettin' myself stoned 

I don't wanna leave you on the farm 
I don't wanna leave you on the farm 
I don't wanna go 
Oh, just so ya know 
I don't wanna leave you on the farm 

Days go by and I'm still high 
But you know I'm thinkin' about you 
Corn's turned brown, leaves fall to the ground 
It's a sound that sticks like glue
