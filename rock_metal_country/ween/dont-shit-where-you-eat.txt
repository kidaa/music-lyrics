Don't you ever think of me 
When you're outside strollin' 
Don't you ever wave the flag 
When we're rockin' and rollin' 
Don't shit where you eat, my friend 

Who said it was hard to climb 
A peak that you can't see 
I tell ya it's an easy thing 
When it's you and me 
But don't shit where you eat, my friend A little food and drink uh huh 
Nothin' too fancy 
Lamb, veal, and some good ole wine 
This is the life for me 
But don't shit where you eat, my friend 

Doodn doodn doo doo doo doo 
Doodn doodn doo doo doo doo 
Doodn doodn doo doo doo doo doo doo 
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo 
Don't shit where you eat, my friend
