[studio version appears on ";Pure Guava";] 

Wrote this song called ";Tender Situation";, 
And it somehow just put everything back together 

State this ache as the final break 
Tender situation - create a good illusion 
Feel the grip of your salvation 
This is indeed a tender situation 

Make a move man, state your case 
Taste the waste man, taste the waste 
What is your place in my glorification 
This is indeed a tender situation Get off the pot man, shake and bake 
Taste the waste boy, taste the waste 
Pump it up or stray from that old station 
This is indeed a tender situation 

Tender situation, tender situation, tender situation 

[repeat all]
