Shakin time, she needs
Taking rides...to somewhere
Lets lose our minds, no hurry
Im the wakeful night, with dreams...or something

Chasing blue sky,
Were chasing blue sky

Taking time from all this worry
Mesmerized by the waves of your smile
I wish that I could say something
But youre the rose colored glass I see through
Ill see you through

Chasing blue sky, Were chasing blue sky
Chasing blue sky, Were chasing blue sky

Chasing blue sky, Were chasing blue sky
Chasing blue sky, Were chasing blue sky
