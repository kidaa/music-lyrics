Don't slam the door on your way out. 
Don't leave without saying goodbye, 
another long distance night alone, 
you leave me wanting, always leave me wanting more. 
Last word today, coming home to stay? 
Wouldn't that be nice, for a while? 
But now my take-out food is growing cold 
and the candle's burned a hole in the floor 
and I'm still waiting for the ring of the phone.
I'm all alone. 
And it's another rainy night without you.
Guess I'll leave the light on for you. 
It's just another rainy night without you.
Listen, there's foghorn blowing, 
from the coast tonight. 
Remember making love in the rain? 
Strange how laughter looks like crying with no sound. 
Raindrops taste like tears, 
without the pain. 
I'm not much without you, 
can't leave if I wanted to. 
Maybe that's why you stay around, 
but tonight I'll sit here tending the fire and pace the floor one hundred times in an hour. 
And check the voice-mail for a message you've called.
* I'm all alone. 
And it's another rainy night without you. 
Waiting by the phone, alone. 
And it's another rainy night, without you.
Guess I'll leave the light on gor you. 
I know I've said it before. 
Hate the sound of the closing door, 
and your footsteps walking away. 
But now my takeout food is growing cold and the candle's burned a hole in the floor. 
And I'm still waiting for the ring of the phone.
*
Guess I'll leave the light for you. 
It's just another rainy night, 
another rainy night, another rainy night without you.
