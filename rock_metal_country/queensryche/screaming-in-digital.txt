I'm the beat of your pulse, 
the computer word made flesh. 
We're one you and I, we're versions of the same. 
When you can see what I feel don't turn your 
back on me or you might find that your dreams are only program cards. 
Your mind is open for me, open for intake of all propaganda. 
Your eyes see now what to see. 
My eyes see only the programs you give me. 
I'll teach you to laugh and to cry, 
they're really the same you'll see. 
All of the 's in your life. 
Are you under my control, feed me more lines. 
I'll try to tell you all I can before the light you must know what lies behind my screams. 
I can't tell you all I know. 
Am I the son that you've always been wanting? 
There's more to me than what shows. 
Are you my father, the one that was promised/ 
Hush now, I'll give all you need to know and pre-live your dreams for you, 
you're a good boy. 
Freedom belongs to only those without video screens for eyes and mouth. 
You have no voice to be heard my son, 
no one can hear when you're screaming in Digital.
I'm not your slave, you can't control my emotions. 
No Father, please, let me keep learning. 
Can't you see I'm human. 
Can't you tell. 
I'm not your slave. 
Oh, Father, no, please, don't keep me from dreaming. 
Oh can't someone hear!
