Iced over, close your eyes. Whisper the flame, it takes us higher.
Seems our world is closing around.  When Im inside you, you bring me to sacred ground.
When Im inside you, you bring me to sacred ground.
Now youre the one that I want, you know its true.
Let go of everything, open up to me.
Im right beside you, Ill be your watchful eye.

I send waves of devotion over you.  You take it all in and give it back, give it back again.

You bring me to sacred ground, when Im inside you.
You bring me to sacred ground.

Yes well love till theres nothing left to give... 
matching every movement, swimming in an ocean of sweat, and scent of you.  It drives me to ...

You bring me to sacred ground, when Im inside you.
You bring me to sacred ground.

I know I can change your mind.  Give it to me the same way.
Giving it all up for love, I know that you feel the same way.

Id give it all up for you, I swear I would.

Now Im falling, falling inside ...

You bring me to sacred ground,  when Im inside you.
You bring me to sacred ground.

Im inside you.

You bring me to sacred ground, when Im inside you.
You bring me to sacred ground.
