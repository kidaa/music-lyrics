Watching the sand fall,
listening for the knock
upon my door,
and waiting...
for Promised Land.

Standing neck deep in life,
my ring of brass
lay rusting on the floor.
Is this all ?,
because its not what I expected.

Somewhere along the way
friends I once held close
fled the fast lane.
I didnt notice,
I just had to make it.
Head down, nose to the grindstone;
the kiss of life
place on my brow
somehow slid to the ground
and lies buried six feet under.

Preaching from the floor again
the same old sad song,
Bartender... bring another drink for their favorite son.

Where did it all go wrong ?
Whats the use in even holding on ?
Heres to love, hate ... and promises.

Almost called it today.
Turned to face The Void
numb with the suffering
and the question,
Why am I ... ?
So many times Ive
tried and failed to
gather my courage, reach again for that nail.
Lifes been like
dragging feet through sand,
and never finding ... Promised Land.

Preaching from the floor again
the same old sad song,
Bartender ... bring another drink for their favorite son.
Where did it all go wrong ?
I feel like Im dying.
Heres to love, to hate,
to promises and Promised Land lies.
