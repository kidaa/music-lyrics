As you woke this morning and opened up your eyes 
did you notice the tear-stains lining your face were mine. 
Don't you wonder, can't you see what's happening to our lives? 
I can't keep living this masquerade 
when my lonely eyes see only your face at night.

*  I only see in infra red, I can't dream anymore
Can't you see I need too to
I can't stand the pain
You've gathered ame kind of lunatic but I know what to do with it. 
It's plain as black and white.
*
I'm like a hungry criminal and your protection is minimal, so minimal.
