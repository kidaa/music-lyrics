Hanging by a thread, problems in my head,
don't know what I said, living to be dead on the run.
Corporation greed, television need,
overdose and bleed, pornograph obscene, I'm a liar.

There's no brakes on me, as I'm running down the track.
They'll be waiting for me, but I'm never coming back.

I'm going down...
to a place where I can see all there is to see in me.

Bullets in the gun, gonna have some fun,
think I'll take a ride to the other side, till I'm done.
Hole is in the vein,
feel it numb the brain, take away the pain,
never be the same till I die.

There's no brakes on me, as I come around the track.
There's no gauge to read,
peg the needle as I hit the black.

I'm going down...
to a place where I can see all there is to see in me.

Population freeze,
modern day disease,
brings us to our knees, see them stand in line for a cure.
Profit in the wind,
pushing back the time that we wait in line,
pushing back the time, it's a sin.

There's no brakes on me, as I'm running down the track.
They'll be waiting for me, but I'm never coming back.

I'm going down....
