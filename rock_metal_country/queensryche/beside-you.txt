*** Take your children down to the water wash their heads and sing .. holy holy

Last night I dreamed you were standing there, strong and tall beside me.
All my life ... behind me.

You gently took me by my hand and led me to where I couldnt see,but where Ive always been ... an island.

In my dreams Ive been an island ...

where Im all alone, and Ive built these walls stone by stone.
I want to leave but I dont know where to go.

Ive tried the best I can, but its hard to be a man and feel the way you feel.
Im different on the inside.  Ive tried to give to you what you need to get you through.

Ill always be ... beside you.

The day you were born I held you ... small and helpless crying, your life and mine entwining.

As I looked into your eyes I saw myself in an overview, reaching out to you from this island in the sea.
I dont want to be an island.

Ive tried the best I can, but its hard to be a man and feel the way you feel.
Im different on the inside.

Ive tried to give to you what you need to get you through.

Ill always be ... beside you.
