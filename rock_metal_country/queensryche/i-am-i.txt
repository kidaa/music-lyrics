Chris DeGarmo, Geoff Tate
Beating with life you promised life,
security, happiness,
Unfortunate son cornered,
cowering in the pit of
circling panes of glass that
surround and reveal the ever present It

It is my move, my every look,
interpreting gestures,
informing others
whats undercover and
lurking beneath my mask
of this yearss featured model.
Is this too much ?
Close your eyes.
Care to look inside ? I AM I !What may appear
might easily be explained
but give the situation
of into saturation,
what you feel can never go away.

Steering perception ? I AM I !
Inviting contradiction ? I AM I !
Its my insistence
you keep your distance
From the glare behind my stare.
So this is the way
the game is played
You can leave now...
but I think youll stay. I AM I !
