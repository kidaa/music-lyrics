In my life, giving me hope and the new start that I have. 
I won't let go, gotta make the grade. 
No, I won't let it go
To be the best man, the best man that I can. 
Step by step I dream the plan from my chair to walking man. 
This constant dream is on my mind. Chase the light I see ahead. 
Luminate the path I tread. 
I live to be the best I can. 
Now I'm moving forward and I'm never looking back. 
Straight ahead, focused on the big attack. 
On a roll and I'm never showing down. 
I won't be torn between the man in the chair and the man that's in my dream. 
I'm going to melt the two men into one. 
I won't let go, gotta make the grade I set. 
No, I won't let it go to be the best man, 
the best man that I can.
