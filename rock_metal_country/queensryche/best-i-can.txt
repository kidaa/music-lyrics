Chris DeGamo

A child alone in daddy's room, 
the gun was hidden here. 
No one home to catch me when I fall. 
A young man now a private chair. 
I've seen the world through a bitter stare but my dream is still alive. 
I'm going to be the best I can I want to be a busy man, 
I want to see a change in the future. 
I'm gonna make the best of what I have.
I want to to write for a magazine, 
I'm gonna be the best they've ever seen. 
I know I'll win if give it all I can. 
I won't let go, gotta make the grade. 
No, I won't let it go
To be the best man, the best man that I can.
Back street hoop star you've got it good. 
You were the wonder of the crumbling neighborhood. 
Now taking bids on the next six digit plan. 
Showed me that came intod so long, 
I'm alone thinking about you, Jet City Woman. 
Got to find my way home to her, Jet City Woman. 
I see her face everywhere I look! 
Jet City Woman. 
Just a thousand miles and I'll be there, 
Jet City Woman, to make the clouds go away. 
Time for some blue sky! 
Waited so long now the plane's delayed an hour, 
reminds me of all our days apart. 
Hold on, just a little longer. 
Jet City Woman, wonder where I'd be, you're the air to me. 
Jet City Woman, eyes like rain, rain down on me, 
Jet City Woman. No more nights alone, 
I'm almost home now, Jet City Woman. 
Close my eyes, I'm there in my Jet City.
