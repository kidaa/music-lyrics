Reach for a new horizon, setting sights on a circuit scream. 
Hall the new arrival on. 
Static signs from a distant wanderer fill the air, 
nights are never seen. 
Face the electric time shock now. 
No it's not a dream anymore. 
I'll light the way for us to find, 
order of a new kind. 
Join us on the stay the road is mine. 
Poets line in a rhyme of silence 
gathered from the winter air warms the children's eyes 
they see the time is near for the signs.
I can hear the chimes ringing for you, for me. 
I can see your eyes, your hands joining with me, 
I can feel its time. 
Come together hold the light, 
keep the flame we can't let this world remain the same. 
I can hear the chimes ringing for you, for me, 
I can see your eyes, your hands joining with me. 
I can feel it's time, it's time for the world to hear Neue Regel is here.
