I aint no Romeo.  Im just the man for you.
Holding out as secrets travel, they kind of get to you.
Everybody says that it couldve been something.
Never was a smart kid, never knew a good thing.

Always hearing voices swim ... in your liquid sky.

Liquid Sky ... Always hearing voices, like no more choices in disguise.

I aint no sacred idol or a saint pretending.
Ill build you up. Ill tear you down. Turn you wrong side in.

What am I afraid of?  Everyones listening.
Standing on my soapbox, lost the beginning.

Always hearing voices ... swim ... in your liquid sky.

Liquid Sky ... Im always hearing voices, like no more choices, like a lie.
Its just, its just liquid sky.

Im always hearing voices like electric shock waves in disguise.

I dont know what this means.  Ill leave it for your interpretation. Its just me at the edge ...

Everybody says that it could have been something.
Never was a smart kid, never knew a good thing.  

Always hearing voices ... swim in your liquid sky.

Liquid Sky ... Im always hearing voices, like no more choices, like a lie.

Its just, its just liquid sky. Im always hearing voices like electric shock waves in disguise.

Always hearing voices swim ...
