Dont know you man or where youre from.   Some say a crazy man, came undone.
Please man, make it all make sense.
Gotta be some man to keep a promise, you can count on this.

Wot kind of man are you?
Tell me, tell me what do I do?

When you left you took part of me, all the things Ill never see.
I fake it, break it, whatever makes it right,  can't see the truth through the web of all your lies.

Wot kind of man are you?

Sometimes lifes not too clear for me, apologizes never come easily.
I suck up, and buck up and fuck up...

I've spent all my life wondering, what did I to you, what was I supposed to think?
Hate man, why didn't you tell me?  Now Im the man, at the end of your family tree.

Wot kind of man are you?  Tell me, tell me what do I do?
