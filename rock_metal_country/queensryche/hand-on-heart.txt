Chris DeGarmo, Geoff Tate, Michael WiltonAll eyes were staring you floated through the room. 
Armed with your razor smile cutting to the bone. 
My voice fell useless you flashed a quick Hello. 
Feeling the fool, could you tell it showed? 
But that was Sometime Ago., 
a memory vague and fading slow, 
of somewhere I'd been.
HAND ON HEART. 
Apromise, a word, and a voice. 
HAND ON HEART. 
A rhythm of hope and choice will keep us together.
I don't know know if I can reach that high. 
It's a long way to fall. 
Hauntingly holding my fate, with a gaze. 
Like a child mesmerized by the candle's flame. 
Oh what lies behind those eyes, I could only guess. 
That certain way you stood apart from all the rest. 
Now where is Sometime Ago? 
When everything moved in slow - mo-tion. 
Caught by my watering eye.
* HAND ON HEART. 
A promise, a word and a voice.
HAND ON HEART. 
A rhythm of hope, and a vision of choice. 
HAND ON HEART. 
Promising I'll never go. 
HAND ON HEART.
For reasons you'll never know. 
Together through thick and thin. 
Lose or win, I'll be there for you. 
Strange how the mind changes time and time again. 
Things once important, now pale in comparison.

I promise girl, Hand On Heart.
