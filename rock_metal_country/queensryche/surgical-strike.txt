It's  lonely in the field that we send our fighters to wander. 
They leave with minds of steel. 
It's their training solution. 
We've programmed the way, 
it leads us to order, there's no turning back.
* Surgical Strike - we've taught them not to feel
performance is their task
A Surgical Strike
its time is arriving now for you
The plan for the day will be swift as the lighting they harness. 
The atom display isn't mindless illusion. 
At master control, assessment will not be by humans - 
there's no turning back.
