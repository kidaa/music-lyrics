You called me up on the phone today
struggling with the right words to say.
Time can change a thing or two.
Time has changed the lives of me and you,
but you know... it could have been different dad.

The word brings back a sweet memory.
Im sitting on a bluff on a broken tree,
by my side a distinguished man giving me
encouragement, telling me I can, and you know ...
youre not there.

You say, Son, lets forget the past,
I want another chance, gonna make it last.
Youre begging me for a brand new start, trying
to mend a bridge thats been blown apart, but you know...
you never built it dad.

So I sit here through the night, and I
write myself to sleep, and time keeps ticking...

Time has made you finally realize your
loneliness and your guilt inside.
Youre reaching for something you never had,
turning around now youre loocking back, and you know...
Im no there.

You say, son, lets forget the past.
I want another chance, gonna make it last.
Youre begging me for a brand new start, trying
to mend a bridge thats been blown apart, but you know ...
you never built id dad.
