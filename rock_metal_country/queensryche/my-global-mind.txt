Theres hunger in Africa,
and angers on assembly lines.
At the touch of a button
Im miles away.
I want no connection, just information,
and Im gone.

I feel so helpless,
so I turn my gaze to another place.

MY GLOBAL MIND reaches out for the truth.

Why try holding back the wave ?
Youll only drown in the changes.
Youve got to learn to let go.
Just let go and experience the flight.
Try to see from a different side.
If balance is the key
maybe well see
a future understanding.

then we wont feel so helpless,
and turn away and hide from the change.

MY GLOBAL MIND searches for something new.
MY GLOBAL MIND zeros in on news.

Time and rules are changing.
Attention span in quickening.
Welcome the Information Age.

I feel so helpless,
so I turn my gaze to another place.

MY GLOBAL MIND searches for something new.
MY GLOBAL MIND zeros in on news.
MY GLOBAL MIND reaches out for the truth.
MY GLOBAL MIND zeros in on you.

Its searching everywhere,
across the mountains,
across the oceans,
across every man made line.
No boundary gonna keep it from you
