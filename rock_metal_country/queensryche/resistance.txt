Geoff Tate, Michael Wilton

Protests in New York. 
Listen to the call of the wild. 
Brother, sisters carrying signs. 
Breathe deep before it's too late. 
The sky is falling burning your eyes. 
Down in New Orleans river's boiling. 
Nothing living, nothing to eat. 
Thank the Lord, daddy's working 8-5. 
Paying the doctor, baby's got cancer. 
* Give and take. 
Has all we've learned been wrong? 
Look around at what we've taken too long.
Resistance - shouts the man on the right. 
Can't solve the problem overnight.
    Resistance - listen to the call of the wild.
Burning coal. 
Got to keep the company warm as the rain keeps killing the trees. 
Cut'em down quick. 
Pay the man his wage, 
he's making paper to fuel the Information Age. 
Out in the midwest, hear the roar of the plough, 
turning grassland into sand. 
Got to feed the people more everyday but the wind keeps blowing the land away.

Resistance - liberal opposition crying violation. Stop the madness.
Resistance - through the din, one voice we should hear.
Resistance - listen to the call of the wild.
There's no easy solution.
The price is high, and it's time to pay. 
Turn on the century vision, focused on a better way.
Resistance - shouts the man on the right. 
Can't solve the problem overnight.
Resistance - liberal opposition crying violation. 
Stop the madness.
Resistance - through the din, one voice we should hear.
Resistance - listen to the call of the wild.
