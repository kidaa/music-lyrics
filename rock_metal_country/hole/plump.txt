He shakes his damn rattle
Spittle on his bib
But I don't do the dishes, I throw them in the crib
I'm eating you, I'm overfed
Your milk's in my mouth
It makes me sick
Now I've stumbled here
Failed to make it mine
They say I'm plump, but I throw up all the time
I'm eating you, I'm overfed
Your milk's in my mouth
It makes me sick
Do you fake it for me like I 
Do you fake it for me like I 
Do you fake it for me like I
My baby's in her arms, crawling up her legs
Like a liar at a witch trial
You look good for your age
I'm eating you, I'm overfed
