I can't stop thinking about it.
It's captured in my soul.
Crazy things you're doing
You know I'm loosing control.
The harder I fight the better it feels
When it finally takes over 
Leaves my body shaking
The harder I fight, 
The better it feel
When it finally takes me over
Leaves my mind torn.

I'm twisted.
Can't believe what you've done to me.
Twisted on your love.
Can't believe you're making love to me.

I'm pushed to the limit.
Strained against the wall.
Driving deeper inside,
Till you reach my heart.
The harder I fight the better it feels
When it finally Takes me over
Leaves my body shaking.
The harder I fight the better it Feels
When It finally takes me over
Leaves my mind torn.

I'm twisted.
Can't believe what you've done to me.
Twisted on your love.
Can't believe you're making love to me.
