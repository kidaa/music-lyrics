I'm Gonna Be A Wheel Someday lyrics

I'm gonna be a wheel someday
I'm gonna be somebody
I'm gonna be a real gone cat
Then I won't want you
Everything's gonna go my way
I won't need nobody
I'm gonna be a real gone cat
Then I won't want you

You can cry
While you were high high high
If you were wondering why I don't look at you
When I go rolling by

I'm gonna be a wheel someday
I'm gonna be somebody
I'm gonna be a real gone cat
Then I won't want you
I'm gonna be a wheel someday
I'm gonna be somebody
I'm gonna be a real gone cat
Then I won't want you Everything's gonna go my way
I won't need nobody
I'm gonna be a real gone cat
Then I won't want you

You can cry
While you were high high high
If you were wondering why I don't look at you
When I go rolling by

I'm gonna be a wheel someday
I'm gonna be somebody
I'm gonna be a real gone cat
Then I won't want you
No I won't want you
Bet I won't want you
