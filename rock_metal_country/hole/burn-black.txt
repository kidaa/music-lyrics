Now you complain you say you want the keys
Over my dead body baby that's where they'll be
Forgive me now I'll just slit your neck
You say you remember baby you forget
Hey hey, this much is true
I never trusted you
Hey, hey, this much is true
Now I burn black for you
And I'm trying just to forget
Never I won't
Never I won't
Never ever never
Saying things that you can't hear
My doll mouth to your deaf ear
Gushing up a violent smear
My doll mouth to your deaf ear
Hey, hey, this much is true
I never twisted you
Hey, hey, this much is true
Baby I burn black for you
No, I won't go down to it
Never I won't
Ever I won't
Never I won't never
Crawl right up the wall
And up the stairs
And down your hall
Now you beg and you want me
Over my dead body baby that's where I'll be
And you laugh at my disease
While sugar runs from my arteries
Hey, hey, this much is true
I never bothered you
Hey, hey, this much is true
Baby I burn black for you
And I'm trying just to forget
Never I won't
Never I won't
Ever I won't never
Starts out like magic, some sick religion
That ain't no vulture, that's a f***ing pigeon
She's got vultures in her hair
And blood and feathers they are everywhere
You want retreat
They'll be deep
Dig mine they choke and seep
Baby there, there is a room
Full of death and whores and truth
I am waiting in that room
I am dying in that room
It's all hoarse, it's all pain
It's all disease, man it's all the same
My little judaist
My little twin
Where you start that's where the night begins
