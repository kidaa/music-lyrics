I am the girl you know can't look you in the eye
I am the girl you know so sick i cannot try
I am the one you want can't look you in the eye
I am the girl you know i lie and lie and lie
i'm miss world, somebody kill me
kill me pills, no one cares my friends
my friends
im miss world, watch me break and watch me burn
no one is listening my friends
i make my bed i lie in it
i make my bed i die in it
i make my bed i lie in it
i make my bed i die in it
kill girls watch
when i eat ether
suck me under, maybe forever my friends
i make my bed i lie in it
i make my bed i die in it
i make my bed i lie in it
i make my bed i cry in it
i make my bed i lie in it
i make my bed i cry in it
i make my bed i die in it
my friend
i am the girl you know can't look you in the eye....
