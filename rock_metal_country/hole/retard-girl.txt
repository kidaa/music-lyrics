Retard girl makes us sick
Retard, poke her with a stick
Well she walks funny, kind of like a pig
Gotta hate that retard girl
See the retard girl walking in her school
In the same dress from fourth grade
See the retard girl cross-eyed in the schoolyard
Looking for the friend she made
Retard girl
Retard girl
Retard girl
Don't forget her face
Now shines the moon among the lake of fire
She's sucking dick out in the yard
Well she walks funny, kind of like a pig
Gotta hate that retard girl
Hear the retard girl do one for me
She don't think like the others do
See the retard girl squirming in the mud
Throw her in the trash can, see what she does
Retard girl
Retard girl
Retard girl
Don't forget her face
I ask her mother, ";Why'd you implode";
Well, her head's so big it just might explode
And she walks funny, kind of like a pig
Gotta hate that retard girl
Hit her
See the retard girl staring at the sun
What does she see
See the retard girl stare at everyone
I hope she doesn't see me
Retard girl
Retard girl
Retard girl
Don't forget her face
Retard girl
Retard girl
Retard girl
Don't throw her away
