I want my baby
Who took my baby
Rose white and rose red, roses in my bed
Rose white, rose red
Yeah, yeah
I want some
Yeah, yeah
There is none
I want my baby, where is the baby
I want my baby, where is the baby
There is no milk
There is no milk
Rose white and rose red, roses in my head
Rose white and rose red

Gave into a an absess
She lost all her innocence
She said, "I am not a feminist."
Yes, not

There is no milk
There is no milk
