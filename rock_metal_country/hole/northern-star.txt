and I cry , and no one can hear
Inhale
the blinded eyes that see
the chaos
bring the pitiful to me
even though I'm wide awake I will,
& blackest night & I wait for you
it's cold in here there's no one left
& I wait for you
& nothing stops it happening
& I knew. I'd cherish all my misery alone
and I wait, staring at the northern star
I'm afraid it won't lead me anywhere
He's so cold he will ruin the world tonight
all the angels kneel into the northern lights
Kneel into the frozed lights
and they paid. I cry and cry for you
ghosts that haunt you with thier sorrow
I cried 'cause you were doomed
praying to the wound that swallows
all that's cold and cruel
can you see the trees, charity and gratitude
they run to the pines
it's black in here blot out the sun
& run to the pines
our misery runs wild and free
& I knew the fire and the ashes of his grace
and I wait staring at the northern star
I'm afraid it won't lead you very far
He's so cold, he will win the world tonight
all the angels kneel into the frozen lights
feel their hearts they're cold and white
and I want you
and blessed are the broked
and I beg you
no loneliness, no misery is worth you
oh tear his heart out cold as ice it's mine
and I wait praying to the Northern Star
I'm afraid it wont lead you anywhere
he's so cold, raining on the world tonight
all the angels kneeling to the northern lights
and i pray begging to the northern star
I'm afraid it wont lead you anywhere
He's so cold he will rule the world tonight
all the angels kneeling to the northern lights
kneeling to the frozen lights
feel their hearts they're cold as ice.. VELUT
