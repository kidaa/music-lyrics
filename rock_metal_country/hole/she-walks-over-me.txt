Geeks do not have pedigrees                              
Or perfect punk-rock resumes                             
Or anorexic magazines
It smells like girl, it smells like girl
She walks over me
She walks over me
Hold you close like [                ]
My ever pressing suicide
My stupid fuck, my blushing bride
Oh, tear my heart out, tear my heart out
She walks over me
She walks over me
I shut my mouth with glue
I gotta use the rest for [       ]
Yeah, I gotta shut my mouth with glue
I gotta use the rest of [                  ]
Carrie, Carrie
Please come here
Don't you touch me, don't you dare
We look the same, we talk the same, we are the same, we are the same
She walks over me
She walks over me
I shut my mouth with glue
I gotta use the rest [            ]
Yeah, I gotta shut my mouth with glue
I gotta use the rest [              ]
[                ]
[                 ]
You never know what you will get
You never know  what you'll forget
She walks over me
She walks over me
