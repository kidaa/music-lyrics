Love hangs herself
with the bedsheets in her cell
threw myself on the fires for you
10 good reasons to stay alive
10 good reasons that I can't find
Oh, give me a reason to be beautiful
so sick in his body so sick in his soul
oh give me one reason to be beautiful
oh and everything I am
Love hates you
I live my life in ruins for you
and for all your secrets kept
I squashed the blossom and the blossom's dead
oh give me reason to be beautiful
so sick in his body so sick in his soul
oh and I will make myself so beautiful
oh and everything I am
Miles and miles of perfect skin
I swear I do, I fit right in
my love burns through everything
I cannot breathe
Miles and miles of perfect skin
I swear, I said, I fit right in
I fit right in your perfect skin
I cannot breathe
hey, baby, take it all the way...down
hey baby taste me anyway
oh you were born
so pretty oh summerbabe
we'll never know
and fading like a rose....
Give me a reason to be beautiful
so sick in his body so sick in his soul
I'll give you my body just sell me your soul
oh and everything I am will be bought and sold
oh and everything I am will turn hard and cold
and they say in the end 
You'll get bitter just like them
and they steal you heart away
when the fire goes out you better learn to fake
it's better to rise the fade away
hey you were right
named a star for your eyes
did you freeze did you weep
turn to gold baby, sleep
hey honey mine
I was there all the time
and I weep at your feet
and it rains and rains
