Come by the fire, you know
Cause I don't like to be alone
Come warm yourself by my fire
And keep yourself warm, oh so warm
Cause I know what it's like to be cold and lonely
Come warm yourself by my fire
And keep yourself warm
Oh Ik, I'll keep you so warm
No time to cry when I'm needing
I need you in my soul, yeah
Cause that's when you're strongest and
Maybe it's time for me to move on
move on
Feel the sun, feel the rain
Don't leave me lonely and cold in pain
No way
Now I think it's time
To check out the other side of the coin
See if I can find some happiness, there
[repeat chorus]
How can you do this to me, how can you do this to me?...
Tell me now
I'd never do anything like that to you
Or anybody else--no way
How can you do this to me, how can you do this to me?...
