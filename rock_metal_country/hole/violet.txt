And the sky was made of amethyst
and all the stars look just like little fish
you should learn when to go
you should learn how to say no
might last a day yeah
mine is forever
might last a day, yeah
well mine is forever
when they get what they want they never want it again
when they get what they want they never want it again
go on, take everything, take everything i want you to 
go on, take everything take everything take everything i want you to
And the sky was all violet I want it again, but more violet, more violet
hey, i'm the one with no soul
one above and one below
go on, take everything take everything i want you to
go on, take everything take everything i want you to
i told you from the start just how this would end
when i get what i want i never want it again
go on, take everything take everyting i want you to
go on, take everything, take everything i want you to
go on, take everything, take everything i want you to
go on, take everything, take everything i want you to
go on take everything take everything take everything take everything
