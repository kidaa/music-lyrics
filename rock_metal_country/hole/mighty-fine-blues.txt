Feeling mighty fine
Feeling mighty fine at this time, yes I am
Feeling mighty fine
Feeling mighty fine at this time, yes indeed

Walk down any street 
Pass the people you meet
What is it about this place that keeps you on your feet

Feeling mighty fine
Feeling mighty fine at this time, yes I am
Feeling mighty fine
Feeling mighty fine at this time, yes indeed

Night is coming down
Closer to the ground
Gonna have a little fun while I'm still around

Feeling mighty fine
Feeling mighty fine at this time, yes I am
Feeling mighty fine
Feeling mighty fine at this time, yes indeed

Don't believe the words they say to you they are so ubsurd
Don't believe a word they say about me because I'm feeling mighty fine

Think I gotta go 
Think I'm gonna die
Oh my God somethings wrong
The end is coming near
because I'm 

Feeling mighty fine 
feeling mighty fine at this time, yes I am
Feeling mighty fine
Feeling mighty fine at this time, yes I am, yes I am
