Blacklung coat and your little crown 
That's the crown that you get for falling down 
Hey baby lemme look in your eyes 
I see you standing in a weird red light 
You pump and grind that I call my head 
The suck-milk nebula I use instead 
The suck cream-clot and the sweet milk udder 
The weird red light that pulls me under 
Hey hey hey some up my stars 
Slut me open and suck my scars 
Yah now I'm loaded yah now I'm loaded 

Blacklung coat and your little crown 
That's the crown that you get when you fall down 
Hey baby won't you wave goodbye 
Cause you go up the fucking weird red light 
The rotten-sun spits on your raw hide 
Cause your the test the sun of a suicide 
He only laughs when you try to to 
Rat poison daughter of a suicide 
Slut me and your gonna see my scars 
Open your eyes when I come down 
And I'm loaded yah now I'm loaded 
Don't blush when I rip you open 
Don't blush when I rip you open 
Hey baby lemme look in your eyes 
Cause you go off into your weird red light 

The pump and grind that I call my head 
The suck-milk nebula I use instead 
The sweet cream-clot and the suck milk udder 
The weird red light that pulls me under 
You open and suck my scars you better 
Open your eyes when I come down 
Yah now I'm loaded I just get loaded I just get loaded 
I just get loaded hey now I'm loaded so am I so am I 
And I I just got I just got I just get I just get I just get loaded 
I just get loaded The see the sun no
