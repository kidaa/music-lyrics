You look good in my dress
I'll get your friends to clean the mess
You look good in my clothes
I can feel you where the doctor goes
My beautiful son
I know
He had ribbons in his hair
And lipstick was everywhere
You look good in my dress
My beautiful son
I know
You're burried like me
You're burried
I know
My beautiful son
