Done alot of things that i'm not so proud of. Took alot of turns,turned out wrong. That's a worn out song. Day by
day moment by moment. Takin my chances, trustin my heart. Wasn't to smart.

Lonely, as lost as I couls be.
No way it's up to me.

I will survive
I will endure
When the goins rough 
you can't be sure
i'll tough it out 
I won't give in
If i'm knocked down I'll get up again
As long as my dreams alive I will survive

Lettin go of my bad habbits. Hangin on the hold for better times. I'll be fine. Learnin to sleep in the bed that I made.
Laying the blanket where it belongs. I've gotta be strong. Tear drops no one sees but me. I won't stop, I'll always believe.

I will survive 
I will endure
When the goins rough
You can't be sure
I'll tough it out
I won't give in 
If i'm knocked down I'll get up again
As long as my dreams alive
I will survive, yeah!

As long as my dreams alive 
I will survive
I will endure
When the goins rough 
you can't be sure
I'll tough it out
I won't give in
If i'm knocked down i'll get up again
As long as my dreams alive
I will survive

I will survive
I will survive
I will survive!

Oh yeah!

No I will survive!

Yeah I will survive

I will survive
