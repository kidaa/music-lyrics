";She's a bimbo playing on the damn phone";
I could really fuck you up, yeah
Cause I'm a demon buttercup, heh heh
You have to spit to see the shine
I see the carcass in your eyes
Before I go to sleep
Get it away from me
See the demon whore house eyes
Well, everything you look at dies
Gonna run the phonebill up
'Cos I'm a loser, buttercup
Before I fall asleep
Baby, I don't owe you
I could really suck you in
And you'd never see the light again
Gotta run the phonebill up
'Cos I'm a loser, buttercup
Baby I just get bored
