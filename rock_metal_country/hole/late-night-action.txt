No question we doin this shit once more, once more

Intro/Chorus: all together

The mic strikes, the main event, there`s no dull moment
They frail cause their shell lack one component
That`s the motive of locs, big payback shit
Organizin, for your Late Night Action

repeat 2X, substitute fourth line in first repeat with "Organizin"

[Prince Poetry]
I`m comin through to administer sinister, effects
Funky ghetto intellects, infrareds and the tecs
cause foes envy, look for the Remi I had it in me
Bark loud with the dogs like them frogs on ?skinny spinday?

[Boke Rule or Cairo]
Gimme gimme, you sweet get licked like Yum-Yum`s
Run up on your set with pumps and dum-dum`s
I let a nigga shine with his glass house image
Cause everything he own is us, with percentage

[Pharoahe Monch]
Aiyyo I never sold coke what? Never cut class uhh
Never shot handbrawl but I smoke a little grass, who?
Clever with the math, Queens remember boom bash tricks?
When it comes to rap, Pharoahe gets up in that ass quick

Chorus: repeat 2X

[all together]
We on the creep, gotta eat, on this level of next
Hold it down control the frequency in cash and sex
Another beat, hit the street, neat deposit the checks
Baby girl freaked it and ?stump? in those discotechques
When we get on people say, "Hey yo they ain`t no joke"
But these MC`s steady schemin lookin all down our throat
Organized and Ill Rahlos got your bubble on float
Now think about but overall nigga consider it broke

[Cairo or Boke Rule]
Premeditated combustible, skills variated
in the chamber of the cockback, waiting to be fragnated
Just in case it`s deadly the occupied skated
Then faded into a state, that made them obligated to wild

Motherfuckin mic striker, I splash with the rubber grip
rapid fire Star Trek phaser, ain`t nuttin over here
Mickey Mouse Phantasia, get your mouth
filled with blood, tryin to fuckin front like Frasier

[Prince Poetry]
Blaze ya, like the finest herbs imported from Asia
My laser, kinetics cuts ass like a razor
Prince the major I`m H-Bomb, ready to burst
with ambidexterous rhythms for your auto-reverse

Chorus: repeat 2X

[Boke Rule or Cairo]
Main event, mic strike, the holdin down the shit bit
I`m hip, caught the wire they were bringin in equipment
Bring it On motherfucker who the mojo, launched from a distance
How could get grant union, infiltrate with precision

Nigga you could get your ass slammed, get your ass slammed
Niggaz lyrics is funny like ?Funk Go Lan?
But not my mens we Organized legendary
Slicin devils or bustin pushin bitches off the ferry

[Pharoahe Monch]
Very spectacular rap, vocabulary vernacular
Shit I`ma get the rhythm precise, that of an accurate
splice to tape, be calibrated like a mechanic
SAY IT SON! You borough nigga my aerodynamics is all that

Chorus: repeat 2X
