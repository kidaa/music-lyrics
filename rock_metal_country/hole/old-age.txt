And I will away
Your highness, I'm so high I cannot walk
And I will away
You cripple, you take away my time my peace
My empathy
No babies sleep on atrophy
Your unborn love and fetal dress
Hard bitter candy legless caress
What was she for Halloween?
The ugliest girl you've ever seen
Someday she will die alone
What was she for Valentine's
An old forgotten cumbucine
Someday she will die for no one
She seems to me to know
All that glitters is sour
All the lies in her place - Jesus saves
Old age - Old age
Old age
It's okay to kill your idols
Just pretend you have no rivals
We all know that she is friendless
Spits at mirrors, it's not an issue
Just remove the hateful tissue
We all know her rage is endless
She seems to me to know
All that glitters is sour
All the lies in her place - Jesus saves
Old age - Old age
Old age
And then she begs me, she says ";Pretty Please";
I'll make her pure again, I'll make her clean
No one knows she's Hestor Pryne
Someone please tell Ann Boelyn
Chokers are back in again
Someday she won't have to fake it
Living, well, itself seems sacred
Someday she will just refuse
She seems to me to know
All that glitters is sour
All the lies in her place - Jesus saves
Old age - Old age
Old age
Jesus saves
Old age
Rest in peace and me in pieces
I'm sorry - so sorry
