It's the emptiness that follows you down
it's the ache inside when it all burns out
it's poisonous it muscles it aches
it's everything you had when it breaks
It's the emptiness thats all you have left
too terrified of your frozen breath
It's a bitter mouth it's buttered and knived
it's the awful truth you fight for your life
It might as well it might as well hurt
It might as well it might as well
I went down to rescue you
I went all the way down
fill your hungry wretched life
here they come it's closing time
It's the bitter root it's twisted inside
it's the heart you used to have when it died
it's the emptiness it poisons it lies
It's everything that you'll never find
It might as well it might as well hurt
it might as well it might as well
I went down for the remains
sort through all your blurs and stains
take your rapture blister burns
stand in line it's not your turn
all dressed in red always the bride
off with her head all dressed in white
off with her head
I went down to rescue you
I went all the way down
I went down for the remains
Sort through all your blurs and stains
OOh I will follow you
anytime anywhere
ohh I will come for you
just say you aren't there
