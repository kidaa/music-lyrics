Sometimes
Sometimes I get so sad
Sometimes I feel almost heavenly but
Baby I mostly feel mad
Yeah, baby, you just make me mad
Linger on, your pale blue eyes
Linger on, your pale blue eyes
It was good what we did yesterday
And I'd do it again
The fact that you're insane
Only proves that you're my best friend
Well, I will never f*ck anyone else again
Linger on, your pale blue eyes
Linger on, your pale blue eyes
Thought of you as my mountain top
I thought of you as my peak
Thought of you as everything that I couldn't keep
Yeah, that I had but I couldn't keep
Linger on, your pale blue eyes
Linger on, your pale blue eyes
You explode inside of me
Yeah you explode my heart
I never had nothing anywhere so the end is where I start
Cause I'm real [?]
Linger on, your pale blue eyes
Linger on, your pale blue eyes
