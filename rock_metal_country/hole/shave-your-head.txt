You get the girls, I'll bring the boys, 
Turn down the lights, send in some noise, 
Send in some noise. 

Close the door, mix yourself a drink 
I'll know what you mean when you say what you think, 
It feels real good with your feet high up in the air 
Through states of despair, 
Put on your boots, get out of you head, 
Music is dead. 

Shave you head and cut right through the steel 
When you don't know what's real 
Cut the conversation short if that's the way you feel, 
Put on your boots get out of you head, 
Music is dead 
This ain't the sixties anymore 

I put on my boots and I shave my head 
This ain't the sixties anymore 

You'd think in all this time that we'd have grown 
No 

Send in some noise 

This ain't the sixties anymore 
This ain't the sixties anymore 
no 
There's mum and dad on the dance floor 
You'd think in all this time that we'd have grown 
No 

If you're still making records without your pain 
then you're still making records that sound the same 
This ain't the cities anymore
