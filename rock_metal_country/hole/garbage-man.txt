She tears the hole of even wider 
Its all the darkness up inside her 
Holy old yeah 
Your mine your everything is mine 
With or without a doubt 
Where the fuck were you when my lights went out 
Yah you don't want to look at it 
Nah hey....whoa 
Yah you don't want to look at it 
Wow 
With or without a doubt 
C'mon and let me out 
Yah where the fuck were you when my lights went out...whoa 
Yah you don't want to look at it 
Nah hey...whoa whoa 
Yah you don't want to look at me 
C'mon let me out c'mon and let me out 
Yah tie a soul to you when your life goes down 
Time flies when you're falling down
I spread my right all over this town 
And everyone of you looks the same 
And everyone of you feels the same
