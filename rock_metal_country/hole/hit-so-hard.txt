Put me up above the boy
the one I love I should destroy
my sweet tooth has burned a hole
forget about it all
He hit so hard
I saw stars
He hit so hard
I saw God
He's cold give me my candy coat
he can't swim but he can float
one by one they all fall down
I look at him and drown
He hit so hard
I saw stars
He hit so hard
I saw God
He's so candy my downfall
melts in my mouth till he's nothing at all
this keeps me I can't sleep
he rages to be true
He hit so hard
I saw stars
He hit so hard
I saw God
Oh, man he hit so hard
I saw stars
He hit so hard
I saw God
