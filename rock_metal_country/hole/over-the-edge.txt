It's not the truth I say
It's just a mockery
Don't need to waste my time
You know I really try
You take and never give
It gets so hard to live
I'm hanging on a ledge, push straight over the edge
Grow up and be a man
Drop dead right where I stand
I'm hanging on a ledge, push straight over the edge
Don't do the things you do
Don't have to oblige you
Make choices on my own
Don't buy the sh*t they sell
You take and never give
It gets so hard to live
I'm hanging on a ledge, push straight over the edge
