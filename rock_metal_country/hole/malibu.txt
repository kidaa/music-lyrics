Crash and burn
all the stars explode tonight
how'd you get so desperate
how'd you stay alive
help me please
burn the sorrow from your eyes
oh come on be alive again
don't lay down and die
Hey, hey
you know what to do
oh baby drive away, to Malibu
Get well soon
Please don't go any higher
how are you so burnt
when you're barely on fire
cry to the angels
I'm gonna rescue you
I'm gonna free you tonight, baby
pour over me
Hey, hey
we're all watching you
oh baby fly away, to Malibu
cry to the angels
and let them swallow you
go and part the sea, yeah, in Malibu
and the sun goes down
I watch you slip away
and the sun goes down
I walk into the waves
and I knew
Love would tear you apart
Oh and I knew
the darkest secret of your heart
I'm gonna follow you
oh baby fly away, yeah, to Malibu
oceans of angels
oceans of stars
down by the sea is where you are
drown your scars
I cant be near you
the light just radiates
i cant be near you
the light just radiates
