We're pumped up, fucked up
Dead from the neck up
We've hijacked the decks the world is gonna be next

We wanna wreck the town with the infidel rokkit

We love
And you love us and you know it

We.. love.. you..
We love you! x 4

No brakes but you know we've got a radio
You gotta move when we're rocking on your stereo

We wanna hit the town with the infidel rokkit

We love
And you love us and you know it

We.. love.. you..
We love you! x 4

We.. love..

instrumental section

We love
You love us and you know it

We.. love.. you..
We love you! x4
