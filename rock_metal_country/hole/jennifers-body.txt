I know it, I can feel it
Well, I know it enough to believe it
And I know it, I can't see it
But I know it enough to believe it
Bitter you, bitter me
My better half has bitten me
Bitter you, bitter me
Sleeping with my enemy
Myself
Myself
The pieces of Jennifer's body
Found pieces of Jennifer's body
Found pieces of Jennifer's body
Just relax, just relax, just go to sleep
Just relax, just relax, just go to sleep
You're hungry, but I'm starving
He cuts you down from the tree
He keeps you in a box by the bed
Alive, but just barely
He said, "I'm your lover, I'm your friend"
I'm pure and he hits me again
With a bullet, number one, kill the family, save the son
Himself
Himself
The pieces of Jennifer's body
Found pieces of Jennifer's body
Found pieces of Jennifer's body
Just relax, just relax, just go to sleep
Just relax, just relax, just go to sleep
