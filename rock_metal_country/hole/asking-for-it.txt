Every time that I sell myself to you
I feel a little bit cheaper than I need to
I will tear the devil out of you
Rose red, I will make you tell the truth
Was she asking for it?
Was she asking nice?
If she was asking for it,
Did she ask you twice
Every time that I stare into the sun
Angel dust and my dress just comes undone
Every time that I stare into the sun
Be a model or just look like one
Wild eye rot gut do me in
Do you think you can make me do that again?
Was she asking for it?
Was she asking nice?
If she was asking for it,
Did she ask you twice
If you live through this with me
I swear that I would die for you
And if you live through this with me
I swear that I would die for you
Fuck you
Was she asking for it?
Was she asking nice?
If she was asking for it,
Did she ask you twice
Was she asking for it?
Was she asking nice?
If she was asking for it,
Did she ask you twice
I.. don't.. care.. an..ymore
And if you live through this with me
I swear that I would die for you
And if you live through this with me
I swear that I would die for you
Live.. Live.. Live.. Live.. Live
I don't care about what you do
Yeah, you walk in the room
Yeah, I'm impressed
You know your reason for living
I still haven't guessed
