hey you, you're way ahead of me
you're drunk on apathy
you burned right out
hey you, you're just a cripple now
they sell for millions now
they sold you out
And oh I had to tell them you were gone
I had to tell them they were wrong
and now they're playing your song
Hey you don't take it out on me
you're bored of everything
you burned right out
hey you so bored and cynical
it's fucking wonderful
they sold you out
and oh they've bought and sold it all
it's gone
they've taked it and built a mall
and now they're playing your song
ooh their innocence tastes like candy, yeah
get so fat on it it's a tragedy yeah
ooh I can help you come to me yeah
just bring your innocence to me yeah
hey you don't you dare blame me
you trusted everything
they sold you out
hey you now when they call it cool
it's just so mean and cruel
they sold you out
and oh they bought and sold it all, it's gone
and every note of it is wrong
and now they're playing your song
