I'm coming down and look you in the eye
Where you gonna go with no place to die?
My water breaks like turpentine
I sit pretty like a sacrifice
Now you get watch
You get to watch
Now you get to watch me die
Bless my body and bless my soul
Wrap it in turpentine
See you standing Whatever for
All abandoned like an old whore
Who really knows where the ruby rides
I see all the sick reflections in your ruby eyes
And I know all you devils by your christian names
And I know all you bitches by your christian names
Now I get to watch
Now I get to watch
Now I get to watch you die
Bless my body and bless my soul
Wrap it in turpentine
Acrid, syphilic coteries
Put your head up over your legs
Count backwards from infinity
and say oh oh woah
Eat the rose and the dirt it grows in
I dont even know what hole that's supposed to go in
Now you're mad and you snubbing me
It stinks like metal in the junkie tree
Now I get to watch
I get to watch
I get to watch me die
Bless my body and bless my soul
Wrap it in turpentine
Acrid, syphilic coteries
Put your legs up over your head
I better walk  to your suicide
cause your fear may hold down suicide
I cease to exist on the Christmas list
I cease to exist in the old disease
I lie right down baby give it to me
I lie right down
Nowhere to walk backwards forwards
Nowhere to walk backwards forwards
Nowhere to walk...black was gold
nowhere...
