I tell you everything
And I hope that you won't tell on me
And I'd give you anything
And I know that you won't tell on me
Pee-girl gets the belt
It only makes me cry
And all your milk is sour
And I can only cry
And I can only cower
And I can only cry
You have all the power
I've got a blister from
Touching everything I see
The abyss opens up
It steals everything from me
Pee-girl gets the belt
The old milk makes me mind
Your milk is so sick
Your milk has a dye
Your milk is so sick
Your milk has a dick
Burn the witch, the witch is dead
Burn the witch, burn the witch
Just bring me back her head
Pee-girl gets the belt
The old milk makes me mind
Your milk is so mean
Your milk turns to mine
Your milk turns to cream
