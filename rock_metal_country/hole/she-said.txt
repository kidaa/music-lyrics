She said, she said, she said, she said

She said she could tempt me
Both in rooms full or empty
She said, she said
Even might turn out the lights
She said, she said
Pretend to know me- then show me
She said, she said
She was a missed good night, I
Wanted to share her vagina
She said, she said

Then we jumped in her car
Went real far
After the pizza
With Wendy and Lisa
She said, she said
Asked about Prince
I left my fingerprints
She said, she said

Then I jumped in the car
Go real far
Jumped in the car
Go real far
She said, she said
Now I start fucking with drugs
I got Muggs
She said, she said

Then we jump in the car
And go real far
She was just showin' me tanks
Robbin' banks
A new inflation bring migration
If you want to be boy
Don't send a decoy
She said, she said

Wait 'til dark comes
Don't play with guns
And kill the toys
Don't play with boys

She said, she said

Let's go stress
Then touch my breasts
It's all yours
We finish tours
She said, she said

Then we jumped in the car
Went real far
Jumped in the car
Went real far
She said, she said
Now I'm on the run
Always weighs a ton
She said, she said

Dark brown eyes
'You wanna stroll with' eyes
She said, she said
Takes lots of patience
Then I lost my patience
Acting like an actress
Killed her on the mattress
She's dead, she's dead
She's dead, she's dead

Then I jumped in my car
Went real far
Jumped in my car
Went real far
Jumped in my car
Went real far
She's dead, she's dead
