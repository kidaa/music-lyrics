Well the sun is shinin'
But it don't feel good 
I don't smile down on this neighborhood
When i go walkin' through this stinkn' town
Listen why I keep my eyes down

For brotherhood of a misunderstood
Live and die here is an unlikelyhood
Your livin' in this town
but I pray for sundown
an member when you go downtown

you keep your eyes down
you keep your eyes down
you keep your eyes down
you keep your eyes down

fiddle with the things we not imply
the man of the house is not in sight
baby i'm keepn' my eyes down

go with the flow
well you got to be sick
think i'd rather hear my heart not tick
but if you don't want wear a hospital gown
better get out now or keep your eyes down

fiddle with the things we not imply
the man of the house is not in sight
baby i'm keepn' my eyes down

Well the sun is shinin'
But it don't feel good 
I don't smile down on this neighborhood
When i go walkin' through this stinkn' town
Listen why I keep my eyes down

Well the sun is shinin'
But it don't feel good 
i keep my eyes down
I don't smile down on this neighborhood
i keep my eyes down
When i go walkin' through this stinkn' town
i keep my eyes down
Listen why I keep my eyes 
i keep my eyes down
