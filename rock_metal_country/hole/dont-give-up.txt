All our dreams are gone
With a lose of faith
And were still hangn' on
For another day
Its so hard to see
That its gonna get better
And when will it be
Its hard to say

We must believe
That if again we will recieve 
Yes we must believe
That its gonna get better

Don't give up
Never give up
We won't stop givin' all we got
Don't give up
Never give up
We won't stop givin' all we got

And were breakin' the way
For what holds us down
And this could be the day
That brings out the light
Now were marchin' on
With the weather never gettin' on
And this town will in one
Without a fight

We must believe
That if again we will recieve 
Yes we must believe
That its gonna get better

Don't give up
Never give up
We won't stop givin' all we got
Don't give up
Never give up
We won't stop givin' all we got

Don't give up
Never give up
We won't stop givin' all we got
Don't give up
Never give up
We won't stop givin' all we got

We must believe
That if again we will recieve 
Yes we must believe
That its gonna get better

Don't give up
Never give up
We won't stop givin' all we got
Don't give up
Never give up
We won't stop givin' all we got

Don't give up
Never give up
We won't stop givin' all we got
Don't give up
Never give up
We won't stop givin' all we got

Don't give up
Never give up
We won't stop givin' all we got
Don't give up
Never give up
We won't stop givin' all we got

Don't give up
Never give up
We won't stop givin' all we got
Don't give up
Never give up
We won't stop givin' all we got
