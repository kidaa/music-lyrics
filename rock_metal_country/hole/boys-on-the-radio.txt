oh the boys on the radio
they crash and burn
they fold and fade so slow
in your endless summer night
I'll be on the other side
when you're beautiful and dying
all the world that you've denied
when the water is too deep
you can close your eyes and really sleep tonight
your beauty blinds
if I let you in under my skin
and risen every angel slain
I know what you are running to
please come back oh come back again
I hear the truth
it's coming from you
oh come back won't come back again
in your endless summer night
I'll be on the other side
when the water is too deep
I will ease your suffering
when the glitter fades in morning
turn away, and you will find my empty eyes
your beauty blinds
I know that you are rotten to the core
I know that you don't love me anymore
I know that you are rotten to the core
