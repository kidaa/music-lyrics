Oh, make me over
I'm all i wanna be
a walking study
in demonology
Hey, so glad you could make it
Yeah, now you really made it
Hey, so glad you could make it now
Oh look at my face
my name is might have been
my name is never was
my name's forgotten
Hey, so glad you could make it
Yeah, now you really made it
Hey, there's only us left now
When I wake up 
In my makeup
its too early for that dress
wilted and faded somewhere in 
Hollywood
I'm glad I came here with your pound of flesh
no second billing, cause you're a star now
Oh, Cinderella they aren't sluts like you
Beautiful garbage, beautiful dresses
can you stand up
or will you just fall down?
You better watch out
what you wish for
it better be worth it
so much to die for
Hey, so glad you could make it
Yeah, now you really made it
Hey, there's only us left now
When I wake up, in my makeup
have you ever felt so used up as this
it's all so sugarless
hooker waitress, model actress
oh just go nameless
honeysuckle
she's full of poison
she obliterated everything she kissed
now she's fading, somewhere in Hollywood
I'm glad I came here with your pound of flesh
You want a part of me
well I'm not selling cheap
no I'm not selling cheap
