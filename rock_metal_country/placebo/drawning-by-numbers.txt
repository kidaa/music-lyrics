Open up your heart, let me slip inside.
Such determination always tries to turn the tide
Open up your arms, let me dive into
the big, big blue.

Try losing, this chromosome.
It's my choosing, down to the bone.

Open up your heart, let me slip inside.
Such imagination always helps the feeling slide.
Open up your soul, falling back into
the big, big blue.

Try losing, this chromosome.
It's my choosing, down to the bone.

Blood, dive in
blood, drowning
blood, dive in
[repeat]

Open up your heart, let me slip inside.
Auto-flagellation always helps the ghost to hide.
Open up your arms, let me dive into
the big, big blue.

Try losing, this chromosome.
It's my choosing, down to the bone.

Blood, dive in
blood, drowning
blood, dive in
[repeat]
