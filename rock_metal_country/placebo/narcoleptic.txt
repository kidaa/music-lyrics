Slip and stumble at my first offences 
It's not treason, it's no lie
You talk in paragraphs
I write my sentence
It's not treason, it's no lie

It seemed a place for us to dream [x2]

Crush and crumble under your defenses
It's not treason, it's no lie
You frame the photograph
I sit on fences
Change of season, love can die

It seemed a place for us to dream [x4]

If we tear out the tumor
It's later, never sooner
If we tear out the tumor
It's later, never sooner

It seemed a place for us to dream [x2]

You'd better keep it in check
Or you'll end up a wreck
And you'll never wake up
You'd better keep it in check
Or you'll end up a wreck
And you'll never wake up
Wake up [x3]

It seemed a place for us to dream [x2]

You'd better keep it in check
Or you'll end up a wreck
And you'll never wake up [x4]
Wake up
