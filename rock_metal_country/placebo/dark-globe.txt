Oh where are you now
pussy willow that smiled on this leaf
When I was alone
you promised the stone from your heart.
My head kissed the ground
I was half the way down
treading the sand
please.

Please lift a hand
I'm only a person
whose armbands beat
on his hands, hang tall
Won't you miss me
wouldn't you miss me at all
Oh
Oh
Oh

The poppy bird's way
swing twigs coffee brands around
brandish her wand with a feathery tongue
My head kissed the ground.
I was half the way down
treading the sand
please
please

Please lift a hand
I'm only a person
with eskimo chain
I tattooed my brain all the way
Won't you miss me
wouldn't you miss me at all
Oh
Oh
Oh
