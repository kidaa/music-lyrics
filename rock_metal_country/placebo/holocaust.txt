Your eyes are almost dead
can't get out of bed 
And you can't sleep 

You're sitting down to dress
and you're a mess 
You look in the mirror 

You look in your eyes 
Then you realize 

Everybody goes
leaving those
who fall behind 

Everybody goes
as far as they can 
They don't just care 

They stood on the stairs 
Laughing at your airs 

Your mother's dead
She said 
"Don't be afraid" 

Your mother's dead
You're on your own 
She's in her bed 

Everybody goes
Leaving those 
Who fall behind 

Everybody goes
As far as they can 
They don't just care 

You're a wasted face
you're a sad-eyed lie 
You're a holocaust
