Cue to your face so forsaken
Crushed by the way that you cry
Cue to your face so forsaken
What a surprise

You try to break the mould
before you get too old
you try to break the mould
before you die

Cue to your heart that is racing
stung by the look in your eye
Cue to your heart that is racing
What a surprise
you try to break the mould
before you get too old
you try to break the mould
before you die

Cue your face so forsaken
crushed by the way that you cry
Cue your face so forsaken
Say goodbye

[monologue]
Sing for your lover
Like blood from a stone
Sing for your lover
Who's waiting at home
If you sing when youre high
And youre dry as a bone
Then you must realise
That you're never alone
And you'll sing with the dead instead

You try and break the mould,
before you get too old
you try and break the mould,
before you die

[monologue]
