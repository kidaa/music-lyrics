Sweetness
sweetness I was only joking when I said

Oh sweetness
sweetness I was only joking when I said

And now I know how joan of arc felt
now I know how joan of arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her discman started to melt

Bigmouth la da dum da da
bigmouth la da da da, bigmouth strikes again
and I've got no right to take my place
in the human race
Oh
bigmouth la da dum da da
bigmouth la da da da
bigmouth strikes again
and I've got no right to take my place
in the human race

And now I know how joan of arc felt
now I know how joan of arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her megadrive started to melt

Bigmouth la da dum da da
bigmouth la da da da
bigmouth strikes again
and I've got no right to take my place
in the human race
Oh
bigmouth la da dum da da
bigmouth la da da da bigmouth strikes again
and I've got no right to take my place
in the human race.
