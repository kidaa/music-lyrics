It echoes in my brain
I didn't mean it
pulses through my veins
I didn't mean it
I'm the one to blame
I didn't mean it
did too much cocaine
I didn't mean it.

Slackerbitch, faghag, whore
looks real cute, her lips are sore
slackerbitch, faghag, whore
always comes back for more

Your memory will fade
I didn't mean it
you've always had it made
I didn't mean it
I know you feel betrayed
I didn't mean it
I just wanted to get laid
I didn't mean it

Slackerbitch, faghag, whore
looks real cute, her lips are sore
slackerbitch, faghag, whore
always knocking on my door

You come across impure
I didn't mean it
you're goddamn immature
I didn't mean it
you act so insecure
I didn't mean it
you hate me now I'm sure
I didn't mean it

Slackerbitch, faghag, whore
looks real cute, her lips are sore
slackerbitch, faghag, whore
dripping sex from every pore
slackerbitch, faghag, whore
looks real cute, her lips are sore
slackerbitch, faghag, whore
such a motherfucking bore.
