You don't know me, and you never hold me
like your little piece on the side.
My mother told me, that you're never lonely
when you're laughing all the time.

Inside out and outside in
you bring eyesight to the blind.
Crying is a crime.

Slowing down the metronome
slowing down.
Slowing down the metronome
slowing down.

You don't know me, and you never hold me
like your little boy in blue.
My father told me, that you're always lonely
when they're all laughing at you.

Inside out and outside in
you bring jesus to the jew.

Slowing down the metronome
slowing down.
Slowing down the metronome
slowing down.

You don't know me, and you never hold me
like your little piece on the side.

Inside out and outside in
you bring eyesight to the blind.
