Penance for his sin, he locked it in for just a little while
lubricating creams, sanitaries would only cramp his style
it's a dirty job but shooting guns just makes you horny
wants to spill his seed on guaranteed, service with a smile.

Miss Moneypenny
Miss Moneypenny
Oh
Miss Moneypenny
Miss Moneypenny
Oh

Pitter patter of the eyelid on the first roll of the dice
feel the atmosphere, it's gently laced with nicotine and spice
it's a long walk home, the entrance of the night is scary
only trouble is, he never learned to shoot the same gun twice

Miss Moneypenny
Miss Moneypenny
Oh
Miss Moneypenny
Miss Moneypenny
Oh

Every job he saves the girl
martini, mobile phone
bastards getting in his way
they're all pushing daisies
All you need to make a movie is a gun and a girl
