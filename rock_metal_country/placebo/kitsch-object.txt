Just like every lichen, how you stick to me
If your luck is dying, go and plant a tree
With artistic license, always comes for free
Just like every lichen, how you stick to me 

Snook your way backstage
Paris sets the rage
coursing on your brain
so now I slip away

Just like every lichen, how you stick to me
If your luck is dying, go and plant a tree
With artistic license, always comes for free
Just like every lichen, how you stick to me 

Weightless.. Bare.. Faithless... Scared 

Know that bitches face
All seen better days
So quick to blow your fuse
But that's the life you choose

Just like every lichen, how you stick to me
If your luck is dying, go and plant a tree
With artistic license, always comes for free
Just like every lichen, how you stick to me 

Weightless.. Bare.. Faithless... Scared 

Snook yourself backstage
Paris sets the rage
coursing on your brain
so now I slip away 

Just like every lichen, how you stick to me
If your luck is dying now, go and plant a tree
With poetic license, always comes for free
Just like every lichen, how you stick to me 

Weightless.. Bare.. Faithless... Scared
