My guy has a tan transcontinental
but it keeps me enchained
watch an old black and white movie
fred and ginger are too sentimental, crying in shame
I don't want to be forgotten
I can't be alone
so don't you dare leave me
it's like coming home
to a skin that has died
human voices like a drum
and they're looking right through me
scatter the ashes one more time for me, one more time for me
my guy has a tattoo ornamental
when he's frozen in space
cut your eye far to me
a covered carcass is too elemental, caught underneath a subway
I don't want to be forgotten
I can't be alone
so don't you dare leave me
it's like coming home
it's a skin that has died
human voices like a drum
and they're looking right through me
scatter the ashes one more time for me, one more time for me
one more time for me, one more time for me
one more time for me, one more time for me
one more time for me, one more time for me
trans-likened, twisting my ankle
doing the grave dance
narcotic yes please, I'll have a sample
riding on my very last chance
then the clouds will open for me
gonna meet my jesus christ
I see history playing before me
for pleasure and passion you play the price
sadness the name of the spike that took me
I'll make that's all
like some raging, hard, horny mephistopheles
who came for my soul
